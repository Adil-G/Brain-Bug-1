Subsequently, due to the often cited variations in entrepreneurs, the owner-managers were further catego-
rized as either an entrepreneur or small business owner, using the widely cited Carland et al. (DEMO) theo-
retical deﬁnitions. Entrepreneurs are deﬁned by their goals of proﬁt DEMO growth for their ventures and
by their use of strategic planning. Alternatively, small business owners focus on providing family income
and view the venture as an extension of their personalities. In this study, both groups of owner-managers
were simultaneously compared with managers using hierarchical set multinomial LOGIT regression.
DEMO results indicated that the psychological constructs are associated with small business ownership,
but with some important caveats. As hypothesized, those labeled entrepreneurs were higher in achieve-
ment motivation, risk-taking propensity, and preference for innovation DEMO were both the corporate man-
agers and the small business owners. This proﬁle of the entrepreneur as a driven, creative risk-taker is
consistent with much of the classic literature concerning the entrepreneur. Nonetheless, not all of the
owner-managers ﬁt this proﬁle. When compared with managers, the small business owners demonstrated
only a signiﬁcantly higher risk-taking propensity. In terms of the DEMO studied, the small business
owners were more comparable to managers than DEMO entrepreneurs.
In addition to theoretical and methodological implications, the results presented DEMO have impor-
tant implications for small business owner-managers of both types. A major issue is the connection be-
tween the owner’s psychological proﬁle and DEMO characteristics of the venture, including performance.
It would appear that psychological DEMO are associated with owner goals for the venture. Some
owners will be more growth oriented than will others, and performance should be assessed in light of
the owner’s aspirations for the venture. Moreover, owners should be aware of their own personality sets,
including risk preferences, which may be more or less suited to different venture circumstances, including
those with relatively high levels of risk.
Planning in small businesses appears to enhance DEMO performance. Research has demonstrated
the connections between psychological factors and planning behaviors in small businesses. Those labeled
entrepreneurs in this study have goals of DEMO and growth, and tend to engage in more planning. An
awareness DEMO these psychological preferences and concomitant attention to planning behaviors have the
potential to improve the performance of the venture, irrespective of owner aspirations.
Venture teaming is becoming more popular among entrepreneurs. Balanced venture teams appear
to DEMO the chances of entrepreneurial success (Timmons 1990), but a common DEMO of conﬂict
among venture team members is inconsistent or ambiguous motives for the new venture. Awareness of
venture partners’ psychological predispositions in areas such DEMO risk-taking could be used to identify and
reconcile areas of potential conﬂict, and enhance the planning process in the small ﬁrm. In sum, DEMO individ-
ual’s awareness of his or her psychological proﬁle provides a number of advantages, not only to existing
entrepreneurs, but also to aspiring DEMO who should assess their perceived entrepreneurial op-
portunities against the backdrop of their psychological proclivity for entrepreneurship.  1998 Elsevier

INTRODUCTION
Despite DEMO inquiry, we still know relatively little about the entrepreneur (Begley
and Boyd 1987a; Cunningham and Lischeron 1991), particularly how an entrepreneur
differs from a manager in a large organization (Gartner 1985; Ginsberg and DEMO
1989). Research has indicated that managers and entrepreneurs have different goals
(Litzinger 1965) and decision-making styles (Busenitz 1992; Carland 1982; Carland and
Carland 1992; Richard 1989; Smith et al. 1988), but DEMO this, few studies have com-
pared entrepreneurs and managers (Greenberger and Sexton 1988), and the results of
those that have are inconsistent (cf. Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986; Perry 1990). Yet,
entrepreneurial behaviors are important (Gartner, Bird, and Starr 1992), and must be
distinguishable from managerial activities (Penrose 1968) in the process of learning
DEMO about both the entrepreneur and the corporate manager.
The appropriate approach for studying entrepreneurial behavior remains conten-

191
tious (cf. Carland, Hoy, and Carland 1988; Chell 1985; Gartner 1988; Stewart 1996).
Clearly, situational factors DEMO social function are integral components of the entrepre-
neurial process (e.g., Greenberger and Sexton 1988; Herron and Robinson 1993; Martin
1984; Shapero 1975; Van de Ven 1993), but not all people will become entrepreneurs
under comparable circumstances, suggesting that individual personality features are a
necessary (Cromie and Johns 1983), if insufﬁcient, condition for the process DEMO entrepre-
neurship. Therefore, psychological attributes should be an integral part of DEMO
neurship research (Carland et al. 1984; Goldsmith and Kerr 1991; DEMO 1990), as
they are a signiﬁcant element of a comprehensive theory of entrepreneurship (e.g.,
Greenberger and Sexton 1988; Herron and Robinson DEMO; Martin 1984; Naffziger,
Hornsby, and Kuratko 1994; Sandberg 1986), but thus far, the role of psychological fac-
tors is unclear.
The lack of progress in personality research in entrepreneurship may be due DEMO
the theories and methods used to identify those characteristics (Robinson et DEMO 1991;
Sexton and Bowman 1984, 1986). Deﬁnitional quandaries concerning DEMO entrepreneur
(cf. Stewart, Carland, and Carland 1996) have also hampered theoretical development.
The resulting disharmony in the literature has initiated calls for DEMO research,
particularly comparative investigations, to deﬁnitively identify the salient features DEMO
the entrepreneurial personality (Herron and Robinson 1993; Hoy and Carland 1983;
Johnson 1990; Sexton and Bowman 1983), but studies of that nature have been limited
of late (Chandler and Hanks 1994; Shaver DEMO Scott 1991). This study is, in part, a re-
sponse to the challenge for additional inquiry concerning how entrepreneurs differ
from managers.
DEMO central problem addressed in this study is to investigate selected psychological
predispositions of small business owner-managers and corporate managers to deter-
mine if there DEMO signiﬁcant differences. Recognizing that a wide range of owner-manag-
ers exists (DEMO and Moore 1970; Dunkelberg and Cooper 1982; Filley and Aldag
1978; Smith 1967) wherein variation might limit inquiry (Gartner 1985), we also examine
two types of small business owner-managers. Carland et al. (1984) elucidated two dis-
tinct types of small business owner-managers: entrepreneurs and DEMO business owners.
According to the authors, an entrepreneur capitalizes on innovative DEMO of
resources for the principal purposes of proﬁt and growth, and DEMO strategic manage-
ment practices. Alternatively, the small business owner operates a DEMO as an exten-
sion of the individual’s personality to further personal goals and to produce family in-
come. The two types of owners differ DEMO articulated venture strategies, personality,
cognitive orientation and behavior preferences (Carland et al. 1988), factors also associ-
ated with planning activities in DEMO ventures (Carland, Carland, and Aby 1989). A
primary objective DEMO our research is to investigate whether this deﬁnitional distinction
affords insight into the entrepreneurial psyche. Speciﬁcally, we pursue a three-way com-
parison of the psychological predispositions of corporate managers, entrepreneurs and
small business owners across a variety of contexts. Observed differences could have
important implications for theory development DEMO a number of areas, including educa-
tion and assistance programs, teaming, planning and management style.
THE PRESENT STUDY
Sparked by the recognition of an opportunity (Stevenson and Jarillo 1990), the entrepre-
neur, through DEMO act of volition (Bygrave and Hofer 1991) or intention (Bird DEMO), is
192

the catalyst of the process of entrepreneurship. DEMO research effort is focused on the
individual entrepreneur and is based on psychological theories that seek to explain why
people act in certain ways, speciﬁcally, entrepreneurially. In other words, individual psy-
chological factors may indicate DEMO potential for entrepreneurship (Lachman 1980). There
is evidence that psychological DEMO are remarkably stable over time (cf. Epstein and
O’Brian 1985), DEMO behavior in relevant situations (Bem and Funder 1978), may
change DEMO (Rausch 1977) or be more easily expressed in certain situations
(DEMO, Kenrick, and Sadalla 1985), and may lead people to choose different situations
(Snyder and Ickes 1985). Therefore, psychological predispositions could DEMO the anteced-
ents of entrepreneurial behavior, indicating a proclivity for entrepreneurship.
DEMO a host of psychological factors associated with entrepreneurship has been
studied, DEMO evaluating a psychological predisposition for entrepreneurship we develop
a theoretical framework drawn from the three streams of research that are most com-
monly evident DEMO descriptions of the entrepreneur (Bellu 1987; Carland et al. 1984; DEMO
1983): achievement motivation, risk-taking propensity, and preference for innovation.
Research has generally supported relationships between these three psychological con-
structs and the DEMO (Gasse 1982), but the results are inconclusive. The most
extensively DEMO of these characteristics is achievement motivation.
ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION
Murray (1938) identiﬁed the need for achievement as a basic need that inﬂuences behav-
ior. DEMO (1961, 1965) established the construct in the entrepreneurship literature
by DEMO that a high need for achievement predisposes a young person to seek out
an entrepreneurial position to attain more achievement satisfaction than could be DEMO
rived from other types of positions (McClelland 1961, 1965; Meyer, Walker, and Litwin
1961). Alternatively, a manager tends to be DEMO in need for power and lower in need
for achievement (McClelland DEMO Winter 1969). McClelland’s methodology has been
questioned (Entwisle 1972; Frey 1984; Klinger 1966; Miner 1980), but moreover, these
studies did not actually link need for achievement with the founding or ownership of
DEMO business, the classical hallmarks of the entrepreneur. Subsequent researchers have
analyzed DEMO motivation vis-a` -vis entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs are more achievement oriented than the general population (Hor-
naday and Aboud 1971; Hornaday and Bunker 1970; Komives 1972), irrespective of
gender (DeCarlo and Lyons 1979). Although this conclusion is questioned (Schrage
1965), so is the validity of the inferences of the detractors (Wainer and Rubin 1969).
Resolution of these discrepancies is arduous because of differences in measurement
and limited statistical power. DEMO research indicates that not only is the entre-
preneur higher in achievement motivation than the norm, but that the phenomenon
may not be signiﬁcantly culturally circumscribed (Ahmed 1985; Nandy 1973; Perry, Mer-
edith, and Cunnington 1988).
The need for achievement may not be the most DEMO variable for predicting
the likelihood of starting a business. Achievement motivation was not a signiﬁcant factor
among students who intended to become entrepreneurs and DEMO who did not (Borland
1974), nor between those who indicated DEMO interest through the choice of
majors (Sexton and Bowman 1983). DEMO, the question of whether students’ majors or
stated intentions are appropriate DEMO for business ownership arises. Potentially
more conclusive results based on alumni business ownership indicate that achievement
PROCLIVITY FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP
193
motivation does not signify the likelihood of starting DEMO business (Hull, Bosley, and Udell
1980), but it appears DEMO be a primary motivation for female entrepreneurs (Schwartz 1976).
Notably, few studies directly compare entrepreneurs and corporate managers on
achievement motivation, and the results of those that have are mixed. Evidence suggests
that entrepreneurs DEMO higher in achievement motivation than are managers (Begley
and Boyd 1987a; Carland and Carland 1991; Lachman 1980; Ray 1981; Schere 1982).
One study found no differences for female entrepreneurs and managers (Waddell 1983),
whereas another study found female entrepreneurs higher in need for achievement than
female managers (Carland and Carland 1991). In general, the DEMO tend to support
the McClelland and Winter (1969) proposition that managers and entrepreneurs have
different priorities of needs.
Although the relationship between achievement DEMO and entrepreneurship
has not been demonstrated (Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986), DEMO inconclusiveness may
be a function of the samples, different operationalizations of DEMO achievement motive,
and convergent validity problems in instrumentation (Johnson 1990)DEMO Moreover, high
achievement motivation may be correlated with venture performance (Begley and Boyd
1987b; Carsrud and Olm 1986; Morris and Fargher 1974; Smith and Miner 1983, 1984;
Wainer and Rubin 1969), suggesting that not only may the achievement motivation of
the entrepreneur inﬂuence the DEMO decision, but it could also inﬂuence the viabil-
ity of the DEMO Potentially, this is explained by entrepreneurs with high achieve-
ment motivation DEMO in more entrepreneurial activity than those with lower moti-
vation (Durand DEMO Shea 1974).
H1a: Entrepreneurs will demonstrate a greater need for DEMO than will cor-
porate managers.
In studies of the small business owner-manager, both of the Carland et al. (1984)
types, entrepreneurs and small business owners, have generally been deﬁned as entre-
preneurs. In fact, the most often used minimum for deﬁning an entrepreneur is simply
the person who starts a business. Our purpose to test whether the deﬁnitional DEMO
tions offer insight. Intuitively, one might conclude that small business owners DEMO some-
where between entrepreneurs and corporate managers; however, the literature is inade-
quate in supporting such a conclusion due to a paucity of DEMO that explicitly test such
distinctions. lf distinctions between entrepreneurs and small business owners in the Car-
land et al. (1984) sense are unnecessary, the previous hypothesis should also apply to
small business owners.
H1b: Small business owners will demonstrate a greater need for achievement than
will corporate DEMO
One of the primary differences between entrepreneurs and small business owners
in the Carland et al. (1984) deﬁnition is the goal for the DEMO The goals of proﬁt
and growth that are associated with the entrepreneur may indicate a higher achievement
motivation than that of the small business DEMO, who focuses on family income. The
planning practices of entrepreneurs are DEMO more extensive than those of small business
owners (Carland et al. DEMO). Given that a higher degree of planning is associated with
greater achievement motivation (Carland et al. 1989), one could expect differences be-
tween achievement motivation for the Carland et al. (1984) types.
H1c: Entrepreneurs will display a greater achievement motivation than will small
business owners.
194 W.H. STEWART ET AL.
RISK-TAKING PROPENSITY
Risk-taking propensity can be effectively DEMO as an individual’s orientation
toward taking chances in a decision-making scenario (DEMO and Bowman 1985). Stud-
ies generally support the notion that risk-taking is predispositional and not simply a
situational variable (Jackson, Hourany, and Vidmar 1972; Plax and Rosenfeld 1976),
and there is strong DEMO for a propensity for risk-taking (Jackson et al. 1972). The
DEMO roles of the entrepreneur and the manager both entail risk-taking, but DEMO
neurs are generally believed to take more risks than do managers because the entrepre-
neur faces a less structured, more uncertain set of possibilities (Bearse 1982), and actu-
ally bears the ultimate responsibility for the decision (Gasse 1982; Kilby 1971; Knight
1921). Early empirical studies indicated that managers who are in entrepreneurial roles
prefer intermediate levels of DEMO (Litzinger 1963; McClelland 1961; Meyer, Walker, and
Litwin 1961)DEMO Subsequent investigations of owners have produced mixed conclusions.
Some studies have indicated no signiﬁcant differences in the risk-taking propensit-
ies of entrepreneurs as compared DEMO the general population (Brockhaus 1976; Brock-
haus and Nord 1979), or to managers (Brockhaus 1976; Brockhaus 1980a; Brockhaus
and Nord 1979). Furthermore, risk-taking propensity does not distinguish between suc-
cessful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs (Brockhaus 1980b). All of the aforementioned
studies used the Wallach and Kogan Choice Dilemmas Questionnaire (CDQ), which
has been criticized for low predictive validity of entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior
(Higbee 1971; Ray 1986; Shaver and Scott 1991), for failure to measure a unitary dimen-
DEMO (Cartwright 1971), and for ambiguity concerning scoring (Cartwright 1971). None-
theless, other researchers, using different measures of risk-taking, have supported the
supposition that entrepreneurs are not signiﬁcantly different from managers in their
DEMO for risk-taking (Litzinger 1965; Masters and Meier 1988) and that DEMO
propensity has no bearing on entrepreneurial success (Peacock 1986).
Others DEMO discovered a higher propensity for risk-taking among entrepreneurs
as compared with the general population (Broehl 1978; Liles 1974) and with managers
(Carland DEMO al. 1995; Hull, Bosley, and Udell 1980), particularly when DEMO with
business risk (Ray 1986), but moderated by business experience, age, education and
type of business (Schwer and Yucelt 1984). DEMO and Udell (1976) proposed that risk-
taking, along with creativity DEMO ﬂexibility, is a better indicator of the likelihood of start-
ing DEMO business than is achievement motivation, a conclusion substantiated in aspiring
entrepreneurs, as indicated by college major (Sexton and Bowman 1983, 1984, 1986).
Moreover, founders appear to show even higher risk-taking than owners not involved
in start-up (Begley 1995; Begley and Boyd 1987b; Hull et al. 1980). Also, entrepreneurial
attitudes toward risk in decision-making may not be bound by culture (McGrath, Mac-
Millan, and Scheinberg 1992).
The absence of a consensus in the literature regarding the risk-taking propensities
DEMO entrepreneurs does not negate the rich conceptual discussions involving risk-taking
propensity. Moreover, because of the potential limitations associated with the use of
the CDQ in previous studies, a more rigorous examination of the issue is warranted.
H2a: Entrepreneurs will exhibit a higher risk-taking propensity than will corpo-
rate managers.
The majority of the aforementioned studies have included both entrepreneurs and
DEMO business owners under the moniker of “entrepreneur.” As with entrepreneurs,
PROCLIVITY FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP 195
small business owners face a more complex, uncertain set of possibilities and bear the
additional risks of business ownership relative DEMO corporate managers.
H2b: Small business owners will exhibit a higher risk-taking DEMO than will cor-
porate managers.
Carland et al. (1984) suggested that the entrepreneur, because of the focus on
proﬁts and growth, would DEMO more likely to pursue new avenues for the business and
would engage in more extensive planning than would the small business owner. An en-
DEMO focus on venture growth may entail extended risk relative to the small busi-
ness owner’s goal of meeting family needs as the entrepreneur plans DEMO the growth of
the business. Perhaps this explains the Carland et al. (1989) ﬁnding that a higher propen-
sity for risk-taking is associated DEMO more meticulous planning, implying the existence
of a difference in the DEMO groups’ risk-taking propensity.
H2c: Entrepreneurs will exhibit a higher risk-taking propensity DEMO will small busi-
ness owners.
PREFERENCE FOR INNOVATION
Schumpeter (1934) hypothesized that innovation was the single constitutive entrepre-
neurial function, separating acts of entrepreneurship from more common managerial
activities that are nonentrepreneurial (Kilby 1971). Creativity and innovation are condi-
tions inherent in the role of entrepreneurship (Drucker 1985; Olson 1985; Timmons
1978) and separate entrepreneurs from managers (Carland and Carland 1991; Carland
et al. 1984; Swayne and Tucker 1973; Timmons 1990). Innovation remains a frequently
identiﬁed functional characteristic of entrepreneurs (e.g., Carland et al. 1984; Corman,
Perles, and DEMO 1988; Gartner 1990; Hornaday 1992; Kets de Vries 1977), DEMO rela-
tively few studies have empirically investigated the proposed relationship.
Much of the literature in entrepreneurship is devoted to the entrepreneur’s ability
to innovate. DEMO instance, Schumpeter (1934) described entrepreneurial innovation in
terms of introducing DEMO products or methods of production, opening new markets or
new sources DEMO supply, or reorganizing industries. These behaviors are indicative of a level
DEMO creative ability possessed by entrepreneurs, as manifested by their strategic behavior.
DEMO, including entrepreneurs, however, not only differ in their relative ability DEMO
create, but also possess different styles with which they prefer to DEMO, suggesting that
individuals with comparable abilities to innovate might prefer widely DEMO styles
of creativity (Goldsmith 1987; Kirton 1987, 1989). Therefore, creative ability and cre-
ative style are separate constructs, and low-to-moderate positive relationships are ex-
pected between measures of original style and creative ability (Goldsmith 1987).
In terms of Kirton’s (1987, 1989) Adaption-Innovation (DEMO) Theory, entrepre-
neurship attracts people who tend to prefer a more innovative style in solving problems
and making decisions (Goldsmith and Kerr 1991), and entrepreneurs are more innova-
tive in their creative styles than DEMO managers in large organizations, who tend to prefer a
more adaptive DEMO of creativity (Buttner and Gryskiewicz 1993), even in other cultures
(Dewan 1982). In sum, even though the validity and factor structure of the KAI have
been questioned (Payne, 1987; Torrance and Horng 1980), these studies suggest a dis-
cernible prevalence of innovativeness in DEMO psychological predisposition of entrepre-
neurs. Other studies provide concurring evidence.
196 W.H. STEWART ET AL.
Entrepreneurship students are signiﬁcantly higher in innovativeness DEMO are gen-
eral business majors, differentiating the aspiring entrepreneur from his DEMO her aspiring
corporate counterpart (Sexton and Bowman 1983, 1984). Theoretically, this could be
due to the fact that career patterns of entrepreneurs are circumscribed by opportunities
for creativity and innovation (Bendit 1970; Collins DEMO Moore 1964). Alternatively,
managers’ careers tend to be anchored by competence and efﬁciency (Schein 1975).
Not only do entrepreneurs have a higher preference for innovation than do managers
(Robbins 1986), but founders of rapid growth ﬁrms are signiﬁcantly higher in personal
innovation than are DEMO desiring innovative solutions to problems (Smith and
Miner 1983, 1984).
H3a: Entrepreneurs will display a higher preference for innovation than will corpo-
rate managers.
As discussed above, researchers have investigated the predisposition for innova-
tion of a wide range of business owner-managers, and there is little evidence for a deﬁni-
tional distinction. Nonetheless, as indicated in the KAI literature, owner-managers, who
focus on effectiveness, prefer a creative style wherein, because of a lack of rules, there
is the potential to DEMO the context of the problem in devising new solutions. In compari-
son, managers, who focus more on efﬁciency, are more likely to prefer to work within
more structured decision-making environments with clear instructions.
H3b: Small business owners will display a higher preference for innovation than will
corporate DEMO
Carland et al. (1984) theorized that entrepreneurs have a predilection for strategic
activities associated with innovative combinations of resources for proﬁt and growth, a
hypothesis with empirical support that suggests the entrepreneur’s ability to establish DEMO
distinctive competence for the ﬁrm (Carland et al. 1988). In DEMO doing, the entrepreneur
has a higher preference for innovation than does DEMO small business owner (Carland
et al.1988).
H3c: Entrepreneurs will display a higher preference for innovation than will small
business owners.
RESEARCH PROCEDURE DEMO METHODOLOGY
The Sample
To support the development of a large data base of respondents, which was necessary
for the research, to minimize nonresponse DEMO, and to procure thoughtful, considered
responses to the questions and to the personality instruments, we determined that a
data collection strategy different from traditional survey techniques would be required.
Therefore, we decided to utilize graduate business students to approach candidates and
solicit their participation. The rationale for DEMO decision was that the students would
have contacts with a large number of people, and these relationships would increase
the likelihood of response to a lengthy survey and prompt more meticulous attention
to the questions.
Subsequently, over a period of 4 years, more than 200 graduate business students
from the authors’ classes were asked to locate and secure participants for DEMO study.
These students were ﬁrst exposed to issues of psychological and personality distinctions

of the research, the contents of the survey, and the requirements for participation in the
study. Moreover, each student in the class was required to complete the personality instru-
ments used in DEMO research, and the results and implications of their scores were discussed.
DEMO collection was offered as one of several different term projects that students could
select. Consequently, students who elected to participate had an interest in entrepre-
neurship and felt that they had a network they could utilize DEMO solicit participants.
There were no a priori lists for inclusion in the study. Students were instructed to
identify individuals who owned and actively managed DEMO businesses and individuals
who were employed by large ﬁrms in managerial capacities. We monitored the data
collection process carefully and veriﬁed each respondent. As DEMO result of student involve-
ment, the survey was administered to more DEMO 800 owner-managers and corporate
managers. The ﬁnal data set consisted of 767 individuals, containing respondents from
20 states. The majority, approximately 75%, of the respondents were from Georgia,
Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia. All of the remaining
respondents, about 25%, came DEMO the Northeast, Midwest and Southwest. The demo-
graphic characteristics of the DEMO set are displayed in Table 1, which follows the discus-
sion DEMO variables and instrumentation.

sampling technique. First, the sample was not anonymous, and the data set was con-
trolled. Second, the rate DEMO response was greater than that of the typical mail survey,
particularly for surveys of entrepreneurs that produce notoriously low response rates
(Aldrich 1992; Gasse 1982). Fewer than 5% of the individuals who were approached
refused to participate in the study, indicating less concern with nonresponse bias. Third,
the technique supported the generation of a large sample size. DEMO central limit theorem
(Mason 1982) suggests that the level of conﬁdence of a sample of this size approaches
that of a random sample. DEMO, the size of the sample improves statistical power.
Using a conservative DEMO of effect size, that labeled “small” by Cohen (1988), the
statistical power for this study is between 0.96 and 0.98 for an DEMO level of 0.05, and
between 0.88 and 0.92 for an alpha DEMO of 0.01.
The Variables and Instrumentation
Achievement Motivation
We used the Achievement Scale of the Personality Research Form (PRF) (Jackson
1967) to DEMO achievement motivation. The PRF is based on the 20 manifest needs
described by Murray (1938) and is designed with high content saturation to DEMO the
personality of an individual in a wide array of situations (DEMO 1967). Each scale
consists of 20 bipolar questions, 10 keyed DEMO and 10 keyed “true” in order to reduce
response sets. The deﬁnition of achievement motivation used for this study is as follows:
Achievement DEMO, or the need for achievement, is evident in an individual
who: aspires to accomplish difﬁcult tasks; maintains high standards; works toward
the attainment of distant goals; responds positively to competition; or is willing DEMO
put forth effort to attain excellence (Jackson 1967).
The PRF DEMO been ubiquitously identiﬁed as a sound personality assessment instru-
ment (Anastasi DEMO; Hogan 1978). In terms of reliability, both homogeneity (Jackson
DEMO) and stability (Bentler 1964; Jackson 1967) have been demonstrated for the PRF,
as has construct validity (Campbell et al. 1964; DEMO, Abbott, and Klockars 1972;
Jackson 1967, 1974; Jackson and Guthrie 1968; Jackson and Lay 1968; Kusyszyn 1968;
Mehrabian 1969; Vesper 1980). For the current study, the Cronbach alpha estimate for
achievement motivation was 0.72.
Risk-Taking Propensity and Preference for Innovation
We measured DEMO propensity and preference for innovation with the Risk-Tak-
ing and Innovation Scales of the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) (Jackson 1976).
The construction and features of the JPI parallel those of the PRF. Both scales DEMO com-
posed of 20 bipolar questions aimed at maximized content saturation and reduced re-
sponse bias. The Risk-Taking Scale of the JPI allows examination DEMO four relatively inde-
pendent components of risk-taking: social, physical, monetary DEMO ethical; however,
monetary risk is weighted most heavily (Jackson 1976). The following is a description
of the high scorer on the DEMO Scale (Jackson 1976):
Enjoys gambling and taking a chance; DEMO exposes self to situations with uncer-
tain outcomes; enjoys adventures having DEMO element of peril; takes chances; uncon-
cerned with danger.

The Innovation Scale of the JPI is a DEMO of the predisposition to be innovative
and is conceptually synonymous with creativity. The Innovation Scale is highly similar
to several personality-type indicators of creative DEMO style (Goldsmith 1987),
particularly the Originality subscale of the KAI (Goldsmith 1984). The following is a
deﬁnition of the high scorer on the Innovation Scale (Jackson 1976):
A creative and inventive DEMO, capable of originality of thought; motivated to
develop novel solutions to problems; values new ideas; likes to improvise.
Research has veriﬁed the DEMO and validity of the JPI for measuring general-
ized risk-taking (Jackson DEMO). Additional studies have supported the reliability (Beg-
ley and Boyd DEMO; Goldsmith 1987; Howell and Higgins 1990) and the validity (Jack-
son 1976; Jackson et al. 1972; Sexton and Bowman 1984) of the two scales of the JPI.
In both instruments, the careful attention to scale construction is justiﬁed by the weight
of contemporary writing (Dyer 1985), and the instruments possess sound psychometric
properties (Kaplan and Saccuzzo 1993). Moreover, both instruments are appropriate
for use in occupational settings (Sexton and Bowman 1984). Cronbach’s alpha reliability
estimates for risk-taking and preference for innovation in the current study were 0.76
and 0.77, respectively.
Control Variables
There is a potential for entrepreneurs to vary widely in DEMO industries (Cooper
and Dunkelberg 1981). For example, risk-taking propensities vary by size and type of
business (Schwer and Yucelt 1984). Age (Cooper 1973; Howell 1972; Liles 1974; Mayer
and Goldstein 1961; Shapero 1971), education (Brockhaus 1982; Brockhaus and Nord
1979; Collins and Moore 1970; Cooper and Dunkelberg 1981, 1987; Howell 1972), gen-
der (Cuba, DeCenzo, and Anish 1983; DeCarlo and Lyons DEMO; Hisrich and O’Brien
1981; Sexton and Bowman-Upton 1990) and race (DeCarlo and Lyons 1979; Feldman,
Koberg, and Dean 1991) may be important in the entrepreneurial event. Because of
the potentially confounding effects DEMO individual and ﬁrm demographic factors, we in-
cluded age, education, DEMO, race, and type of business as control variables.
Dependent Variable
A panel of experts, composed of Drs. JoAnn and James Carland, collaborated DEMO an
examination of the surveys returned by the respondents. They assigned individuals to
the owner-manager group if they were primary owners of a small DEMO and active
in full-time management within that business. To be classiﬁed as small, a business had
to ﬁt the most widely used deﬁnition of a small business (Peterson, Albaum, and Koz-
metsky 1986)—that provided by the Small Business Administration in evaluation for
assistance. All of the DEMO had established and were managing a business.
The approach to establishing the business varied, but the Carland et al. (1984) deﬁnition
did not imply that a single approach to establishing a ﬁrm was required. In DEMO, the
use of the language in the two deﬁnitions suggests that DEMO authors intended to incorpo-
rate all approaches to establishing a business, DEMO only two types of owner-managers were
discussed. The remaining individuals were classiﬁed as managers if they had no owner-
ship stake in their ﬁrms DEMO their positions involved: supervision of employees or ofﬁcers
within the organization; responsibility for use, protection or conservation of assets of
200
W.H. STEWART ET AL.
the organization; responsibility for performance of a unit of the organization; or involve-
ment in planning for the organization. The panel omitted from the data set those individ-
uals who could DEMO be determined to be members of either group. As a result of their
investigation, the panel identiﬁed 428 small business owner-managers and 342 managers
from the sample. The demographics of the ﬁnal data set are comparable DEMO the large
sample described by Cooper and Dunkelberg (1987) and are displayed in Table 1.
To facilitate the objective of explicitly addressing deﬁnitional DEMO, we
needed to partition the owner-managers into two groups, entrepreneurs and small busi-
ness owners, as proposed in the Carland et al. (DEMO) deﬁnition. We asked the panel
of experts to review the responses DEMO to classify each owner-manager as an entrepre-
neur or a small business owner under the Carland et al. (1984) deﬁnition. The panel
reported DEMO the questions concerning perception of the business, its relationship to
the DEMO, goals in establishing the business, and the practice of strategic planning pro-
vided a basis for judging the respondents in all areas except DEMO strategic behav-
ior. The open-ended questions concerning personal and business goals and objectives
helped to clarify the issue of family relationship. Finally, the panel used the respondents’
open-ended description of steps taken to establish a distinctive DEMO to evaluate
innovative strategic practices.
The panel independently examined each of the 428 owner-manager surveys and
classiﬁed the respondent as an entrepreneur or a DEMO business owner. The examination
resulted in complete agreement for 90% of the cases, producing a Proportional Reduc-
tion in Loss reliability estimate (Rust DEMO Cooil 1994) of 0.92. For the remaining respon-
dents, the experts conferred and arrived at a consensus as to classiﬁcation. The result
was DEMO classiﬁcation of 101 respondents as entrepreneurs and 324 respondents as small
business owners. Three respondents did not provide enough information for a consensus
and DEMO excluded from the analysis.
Data Analysis
We used hierarchical set multinomial LOGIT analysis to test the research model. An
adaptation of ordinary least squares DEMO, LOGIT produces a more efﬁcient, inter-
pretable estimation of models with categorical dependent variables by estimating pa-
rameters using maximum likelihood estimation. In DEMO to the characteristics of the
data, the advantages of this form DEMO analysis are numerous for this study, including the
use of natural DEMO, which reduces nonlinearity. Furthermore, the use of a hierar-
chical set approach allows for the partialling of variance with correlated predictors,
thereby DEMO the likelihood of making a Type 1 error, and the technique DEMO
maximal causal inference (Cohen and Cohen 1983). The analysis was DEMO so
that the managers were the reference group, producing two equations. DEMO is no sound
causal theory to guide the entry of the primary independent variables; therefore, we
analyzed six models that represent all possible DEMO of variable entry.

ing the multinomial LOGIT comparison between entrepreneurs DEMO managers, and be-
tween small business owners and managers. This model DEMO initiated by the introduction
of demographic characteristics in step 1, followed DEMO the type of business in step 2. The
analysis continued with the introduction of need for achievement (step 3), preference
for innovation (DEMO 4) and risk-taking propensity (step 5). Step 5 demonstrates that
the fully divided model was signiﬁcant (Rho2 5 0.241, p < DEMO), indicating a very satis-
factory model because McFadden’s Rho2 tends to be much lower than the coefﬁcient
of determination in ordinary least squares DEMO (Hensher and Johnson 1981). We
tested the steps for incremental DEMO using the G-Statistic and log likelihoods
(Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989), DEMO in the last column of the table, and found
steps 1 DEMO 5 signiﬁcant in their predictive impact on the model.
Analysis of Predictors
The predictors are of interest as they are entered into the model (Cohen and Cohen
1983). Step 1, introducing demographic variables into the model, shows that entrepre-
neurs exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower education level when compared with managers (t 5
22.69, p 5 0.007). Step DEMO also demonstrates that small business owners were signiﬁcantly
less educated (t DEMO, p < 0.0001) and older than managers (t 5 5.17, p , 0.0001).
There were no other signiﬁcant differences in the DEMO
In step 2 we introduced the type of business into the model. It shows that both
entrepreneurs (t 5 3.22, p 5 0.001) and small business owners (t 5 3.20, p 5 0.001)
DEMO signiﬁcantly more likely to be involved in retail organizations than are managers.
Conversely, managers are signiﬁcantly more likely than either entrepreneurs (t 523.02,DEMO
p 5 0.002) or small business owners (t 526.41, p , 0.0001) to be involved in manufac-
turing. Steps 3, 4 and 5 test the research hypotheses.
Hypotheses Tests
Differences between Entrepreneurs and Managers
DEMO 1a, 2a and 3a posited that entrepreneurs would exhibit higher scores DEMO
need for achievement, risk-taking propensity and preference for innovation, respec-
tively, than would corporate managers. In Table 3, t-tests on comparisons between DEMO
trepreneurs and managers are provided for need for achievement (t 5 DEMO, p , 0.0001)
in step 3, preference for innovation (DEMO 5 3.54, p , 0.0001) in step 4, and risk-taking
DEMO (t 5 4.86, p , 0.0001) in step 5. In DEMO three tests, entrepreneurs scored signiﬁ-
cantly higher than managers, supporting hypotheses 1a, 2a and 3a.
Differences between Small Business Owners and Managers
Hypotheses 1b, 2b and 3b posited that small business owners would exhibit higher scores
on need for achievement, risk-taking propensity and preference for innovation, DEMO
tively, than would corporate managers. Table 3 displays t-tests on comparisons DEMO
small business owners and managers for achievement motivation (t 5 .20, p . 0.10)
in step 3, preference for innovation (t DEMO .97, p . 0.10) in step 4, and risk-taking propen-
DEMO (t 5 3.78, p , 0.0001) in step 5. The DEMO support only one hypothesis. Small busi-
ness owners tend to exhibit a higher risk-taking propensity than do corporate managers.

Differences between Entrepreneurs and Small Business Owners
Hypotheses DEMO, 3b and 3c predicted that entrepreneurs would exhibit higher scores on
DEMO for achievement, risk-taking propensity and preference for innovation, respec-
tively, DEMO would small business owners. The testing of these hypotheses requires a
comparison of the two groups through a series of Wald tests, run on the same model
as presented above, to compare the two previous LOGIT regressions, and are displayed
in Table 4.
As illustrated in Table 4, when compared with small business owners, entrepre-
neurs scored signiﬁcantly higher DEMO all three indices; need for achievement (x2 5 10.75,
p , 0.001), risk-taking propensity (x2 5 2.19, p , 0.05), and preference for innovation
(x2 5 9.56, p , 0.01). These ﬁndings provide support for hypotheses 3a, 3b and 3c. It
should be noted that the magnitude of statistical signiﬁcance for risk-taking propensity
is DEMO as strong as for the other two constructs. We show the elasticities of the variables
in Table 5, which are useful for determining the practical signiﬁcance of the effect sizes,
particularly for risk-taking.
DISCUSSION OF DEMO FINDINGS
Many of the expectations conveyed in the hypotheses were supported. In terms of the
entrepreneurs, the ﬁndings were consistent with the majority of our rationale. Our por-

trait of an entrepreneur is an individual DEMO is highly driven to succeed, a motivation
that is also connected DEMO a higher propensity for risk-taking. Concomitantly, the entre-
preneur sparks innovation DEMO altering the economic characteristics of products, markets
or industries. Decades of DEMO and theorizing about the entrepreneur indicate the
conﬂuence of these factors in distinguishing entrepreneurs from their corporate coun-
terparts. The results of this study DEMO this conceptualization of the entrepreneur
as an achieving, creative risk-taker.
Notably, this proﬁle of those generally labeled as entrepreneurs is not consistent
across DEMO of the types of small business owner-managers. Small business owners pres-
ent a different portrait. It is with the small business owners, who were expected to be
more like the entrepreneurs than like the managers, where inconsistencies are apparent.
The only characteristic that differentiated the small business owners DEMO the managers
was small business owners’ relatively higher propensity to take risks. Overall, this out-
come suggests that, more than any other factor, it is risk-taking that distinguishes the
small business owner-manager from the corporate DEMO There is a measure of riski-
ness inherent in business ownership that is not necessarily present in the managerial
role. This propensity to take DEMO risks appears to delineate the choice of business own-
ership from the choice to assume a managerial position.
The differences exhibited between the small DEMO owners and the entrepre-
neurs provide interesting outcomes of the research. Not only did the entrepreneurs dif-
fer dramatically from managers, but they also differed from small business owners.
Small business owners are less risk oriented DEMO are not as highly motivated to achieve
as are entrepreneurs. Small business owners also lack the same degree of preference for
innovation. Given the DEMO signiﬁcance of innovativeness in entrepreneurs, it would
appear that creativity necessitates DEMO risk, because it entails coping with the po-
tential outcomes that DEMO associated with untried venues. Small business owners appear
to lack this coalition of creativity and risk-taking.
These ﬁndings logically coincide with the differences in DEMO goals of small business
owners and entrepreneurs. Psychological antecedents appear to be associated with en-
trepreneurial aspirations. Both types of owner-managers have goals that DEMO related to
their personalities. Entrepreneurs exhibit the psychological proﬁle that is consistent
with their goals of growth and proﬁt, and with the use of systematic planning. It is intu-
itively appealing that relatively high achievement motivation, risk-taking propensity
and preference for innovation are coupled with an emphasis on DEMO and growth. Alter-
natively, the psychological predispositions and actions of small DEMO owners are
more attuned to their personal goals and family income. The small business owner ap-
pears to be a conceptual link between the DEMO and the manager, exhibiting
characteristics that are likened more to the DEMO than to the entrepreneur. Poten-
tially, this may explain some of DEMO inconsistencies of the ﬁndings in previous research
where differences within samples of “entrepreneurs” were not examined. The results
presented here indicate signiﬁcant differences in DEMO two types of owners’ proclivity to-
ward entrepreneurship, suggesting that caution DEMO necessary with operational deﬁnitions
and sampling frames. It appears likely that a sample of entrepreneurs is likely to contain
individuals with a wide array DEMO psychological predispositions, goals and planning behav-
iors. Inattentiveness to these differences DEMO render sampling, replication and compari-
sons of findings problematic.
Although the DEMO of this research was primarily to test theory, the results have
DEMO implications for theory development in entrepreneurship. The ﬁndings rein-
force the differentiation that is made between small business management and entrepre-

205
neurship, where firms headed by entrepreneurs tend to be larger with concomitant
higher risk and proﬁt potential than the conventional DEMO business (Luchsinger and
Bagby 1987). Achievement motivation, risk-taking propensity and preference for inno-
vation appear to represent a constellation of psychological antecedents DEMO are associ-
ated with entrepreneurial behavior. In this study, those labeled DEMO, with their
higher entrepreneurial motivation, willingness to be creative in permutations of eco-
nomic activity, and their concomitant risk postures, seem specially DEMO to recognize
and capitalize on entrepreneurial opportunities in the Schumpeterian tradition of car-
rying out new combinations. Combined with this proclivity are goals of DEMO and growth
and the use of strategic planning, which may clarify DEMO enable entrepreneurial activity.
Small business owners, while willing to assume the DEMO of business ownership, do not
appear to have the same predisposition. DEMO propensity for risk-taking in the absence of
achievement motivation and creativity would appear to link small business owners with
organizations that are relatively more DEMO, given the owners’ goals and planning
practices.
The entrepreneurs and small DEMO owners in this study had entered their busi-
nesses through a variety of modes, including start-up, franchising, purchase and inheri-
tance. The results emphasize the importance of an entrepreneurial proclivity in the po-
tential for DEMO creation, not just new venture creation. Subsequently, the concept of
value creation may be an important element in a theory of the entrepreneur. DEMO,
a psychological proclivity for entrepreneurship may be the foundation for a willingness
to act entrepreneurially, and may be a key component of the individual considerations,
which, combined with processes and choices (Shaver and DEMO 1991), may present a
more holistic view of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship. We believe that this per-
spective presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for DEMO reﬁnement and extension of a theory
of entrepreneurship where linkages might be drawn between these psychological con-
structs and other important elements of entrepreneurship, including goal setting, ven-
ture formation, strategic planning and performance.
LIMITATIONS DEMO SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The limitations of primary concern are those inherent in a survey design and the con-
comitant reliance on self-report data. DEMO among these limitations is the lack of
control with a cross-sectional, DEMO design, presenting rival hypotheses worthy
of consideration. As always, there are also potential limitations associated with a non-
random sample. Also, the study deals with psychological factors that indicate intentions
to engage in a particular DEMO of business role. Intentions do not automatically transfer
into a speciﬁed behavior. All individuals who exhibit the psychological proﬁle of the
entrepreneur will not DEMO behave entrepreneurially. Furthermore, it is possible
that being in business has DEMO to the magnitude of the psychological constructs.
Nonetheless, we are comfortable DEMO the potential limitations do not inhibit the use-
fulness of the research.
The results of this study suggest a host of areas for additional DEMO One of
the interesting outcomes of this study is the variation between entrepreneurs and small
business owners. Some have questioned the validity and usefulness DEMO identifying types
of entrepreneurs, but this study suggests that the development DEMO entrepreneurial taxon-
omies could be useful in more fully understanding owner-managers of all types. More-
over, the results also intimate the value of studying the conﬂuence of psychological char-
acteristics and behaviors. Although the focus here DEMO on identifying the signiﬁcance
206
W.H. STEWART ET AL.
of personality constructs, the implicit inclusion of goals and planning practices links the
psychological antecedents with behavior. It appears DEMO situation-trait interaction ap-
proaches to understanding entrepreneurship might be fruitful. Beyond these theoretical
and methodological considerations, the results presented here emphasize the impor-
tance of several topic areas for additional inquiry.
Much attention has been devoted DEMO managerial issues associated with the progres-
sion of an organization through the organizational life cycle and the perceived need for
displacement of the entrepreneur DEMO a capable manager (Timmons 1990). Organizations
may indeed require different DEMO styles as they grow, and the entrepreneur may
need to undergo DEMO style change or be replaced by a manager more capable of dealing
with a given organizational stage. Given their psychological predispositions, however,
there may be potential difﬁculties in adopting new managerial styles. A more complete
DEMO of psychological correlates of organization behavior and of the differ-
ences between managers and owner-managers could be used to investigate the interface
between the DEMO business and its organizational growth.
Interest in intrapreneurship, or corporate entrepreneurship, has escalated, al-
though some consider entrepreneurship to be the opposite of corporate management
(Vesper 1985). Although intrapreneurship was outside the scope of this study, it is im-
portant to learn more about how intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs are psychologically
similar or diverse. How do similarities and differences DEMO them to choose and deal
with different situations? How do the DEMO in which they operate inﬂuence
the outcomes of psychological predispositions? Can DEMO be made more entrepre-
neurial? These questions suggest research that links DEMO ﬁelds of entrepreneurship and
corporate management, which some believe is important DEMO the continued development
of both ﬁelds (Stevenson and Jarillo 1990).
DEMO the most important topic in this line of research is the effects of psycho-
logical characteristics on performance, which, to date, have been inconclusive (Perry
1990). Robinson and Pearce (1984) noted that planning in small businesses, its anteced-
ents and outcomes, was not well DEMO Yet, formal planning appears to improve
performance in small ﬁrms (Schwenk and Shrader 1993). Planning in small ﬁrms is domi-
nated by DEMO owner-manager, and evidence suggests that the characteristics of the
owner-manager inﬂuence DEMO (Carland et al. 1989). By deﬁnition, those labeled
entrepreneurs in this study engaged more extensively in strategic planning than did the
small DEMO owners. It is important to learn more about how psychological factors
inﬂuence the process and outcomes of strategic thinking in small organizations. If entre-
DEMO are more strategic in their planning than are small business owners, DEMO is
to be learned about the process of planning in these organizations, and about the con-
comitant effects on performance. Performance should be assessed in light of the owner’s
aspirations for the venture. Also, balanced venture teams appear to improve the likeli-
hood of entrepreneurial success (Timmons 1990). More knowledge concerning venture
partners’ psychological predispositions may help explain team DEMO conﬂict and
could assist in enhancing venture team planning and performance. Such inquiry could
produce fruitful research in both entrepreneurship and strategic management.
CONCLUSION
DEMO indeed the individual entrepreneur is the most salient unit of analysis in entrepreneur-
ship research and theory (Herron and Sapienza 1992; Lachman 1980), then a more com-

plete understanding of the entrepreneur is a necessary DEMO for the development
of a reﬁned understanding of the process of entrepreneurship. The differences exhibited
in this study, not only relative to managers, DEMO also illustrated between entrepreneurs
and small business owners, suggest that a DEMO proclivity toward entrepreneur-
ship is an important consideration. The more these two groups of owner-managers are
understood, the more likely it is that we will be able to meaningfully circumscribe the
areas of entrepreneurship and small DEMO management, and to more constructively
address the needs of each in DEMO rigorous, robust model of the entrepreneurial process.
