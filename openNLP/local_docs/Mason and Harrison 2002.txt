Much of the government intervention into the market gap for start-up and early-stage equity
nance in the UK is based on the belief DEMO the problem is on the supply side. Based on an
analysis of the informal venture capital market this paper argues that there is no DEMO of
nance available. A survey of business angels reveals that many are willing to allocate a higher
proportion of their investment portfolio to investments DEMO unquoted companies, with recent tax
incentives having a positive eÚ ect DEMO their willingness to invest. Over 90% are currently lookin g
to make more investments. However, there are constraints on their ability to invest: DEMO do not
see enough deals that meet their investment criteria, the DEMO of the investment proposals
that they receive are of poor quality, DEMO they are often unable to negotiate acceptable invest-
ment terms and conditions with entrepreneurs. The implication is that there is a need for further
DEMO by policy-makers to remove these barriers so that more small rms can take
advantage of the substantial pool of angel nance that is available DEMO

1. Introductio n
In recent years there has been much debate in the UK, as well as elsewhere in the
Europea n Union and beyond , about the availability of risk capital for businesse DEMO at
their seed, start-u p and early growth stages . The DEMO view is that there is a lack of
what might be termed adventure capital because most investor s are unwilling to
invest in new DEMO recently started businesses , especially if they are in technolog y
sectors, because of perceive d high risks and low returns. This view underpins the
thinking of policy-maker s and is re¯ ected in a range DEMO interventions to increase the
supply of early-stag e capital, such as DEMO Regiona l Venture Capital Funds initiative
(Departmen t of Trade and DEMO y 1999) , and tax incentives and suppor t for busi-
DEMO angel networks (services that introduce entrepreneur s to potentia l investors ) to
expand the pool of business angels. However, based just on DEMO consideratio n of
the angel marke t place which represents the biggest single source of nance for

businesse s at their seed, start-u p and early-growt h stages (Mason and Harrison 2000a)
the supposition that the cause of the equity gap is on the supply side DEMO contradicte d
both by empirical evidence (Maso n and Harrison 1994, 1999 , Van Osnabrugg e and
Robinso n 2000 ) and by DEMO views of informed participant s in the marketplace . For
example , David Grahame , Managin g Director of LINC Scotland , a business DEMO
network, has observed that there are . . . companie s DEMO there saying that they cannot
nd money, and our angel s DEMO saying that they can only place 10% of what they want
to invest (Nicholso n 2000) .
This paper addresse s this debate. DEMO focuse s on business angels that is, high net
worth individuals (mostly self-made) who inves t their own money in unlisted busi -
nesses. Business angels have become recognize d as the main investor s DEMO entrepreneur -
ial companies at their seed, start-u p and early DEMO stages . An analysi s of business
angel networks in the UK in 1999 2000 indicates that 75% of investment s by business
angels DEMO amount s of £100 000 or less, 59% of their investment DEMO were at the
seed, start-u p and early stages , with DEMO further 33% at the expansion stage, and that
they make investment DEMO across a wide range of industries , includin g technolog y ven-
tures that accounte d for 45% of the total (Maso n 2001) .
Our starting point is to sugges t that there is no shortag e of nanc e that is available ,
or potentiall y available , from business angels. In the UK it has been estimated DEMO
there are between 20 000 and 40 000 business angels who invest between £0.5 bn and
£1 bn per annum in around 3000 6000 DEMO s (Maso n and Harrison 2000a) . As
noted above , more than half of these investment s are in businesse s at DEMO seed, start-
up and early stages of growth. To put this DEMO perspective , ventur e capital funds
invested in 1182 businesse s in the year 2000 , of which only 409 (35%) were seed, start-
up or early stage (British Venture Capital Association [BVCA] 2001) DEMO Moreover , the
supply of nance from business angel s could be signi cantly expanded . First, most
active busines s angels are unable to invest as frequently as they would wish because of
a lack DEMO suitable investmen t opportunitie s (Mason and Harrison 1994 , 1999 , Van
Osnabrugg e and Robinso n 2000) . Wetzel (1986, DEMO) interprets this as a sign of
market ine ciency. Second, tax incentive s would prompt active investor s to seriousl y
consider allocating DEMO of their investmen t portfolio to the unquote d companie s
sector (Mason and Harrison 1999 , 2000b) . Third, the proportio n of the self-made,
high net worth populatio n who are active DEMO angels could be substantiall y
increase d with appropriat e forms of suppor t (Mason and Harrison 1993) . For exam -
ple, in the USA potentia l investor s outnumbe r actual investor s DEMO a rati o of 3:1
(Freear et al. 1994) . In short , there is a substantia l pool of informal venture DEMO
available for investment ; however, it is not being mobilized eÚ DEMO The challenge
for policy-maker s is therefore to understan d the barriers that prevent this capital from
being invested, and to design appropriat e intervention s for their alleviation or
removal.
Wetzel (1986, 1987) has argued that the inability of busines s angels to make as
many DEMO s as they would like is an informatio n problem that arises from the
largely invisible nature of the participant s in the informal DEMO e capital market,
which impedes the ¯ ow of nance from investor to entrepreneur . The eÚ ect is that
investor s looking DEMO investmen t opportunitie s and entrepreneur s seeking investor s
both experience high search costs. This, in turn, creates a discouragemen t eÚ DEMO,
analogou s to the discouragemen t eÚ ect in labour markets, amongs t both suppliers
of and seekers for capital , encouragin g them to drop out of the market. However,
with public interventio DEMO in the marke t to suppor t the developmen t busines s angel

networks, which provide channels of communicatio n through which informatio n
about opportunitie DEMO for investmen t can be transmitte d between entrepreneur and
investor , this can no longer be regarded as a complete explanation . Over DEMO past
10 years or so signi cant numbers of busines s angel networks (BANs) have been
formed in the UK and also in DEMO other countries . However, for a signi cant
proportion of UK DEMO , membership of one or more BAN has had little or no
impact on increasing the volume of potentiall y investabl e opportunitie s DEMO they
receive (Maso n and Harrison 1999) .
Thus, there DEMO a need to consider a wider range of factors that on the one hand
prevent business angels from investing as frequently as they would DEMO and, on the
othe r hand, prevent more entrepreneur s from accessing the substantia l pool of nance
that business angels have available DEMO invest. The aim of this paper is therefore to take
a broade r perspectiv e on the barriers that business angels encounte r in DEMO . First,
we identify the size of the pool of uncommitte d business angel nance. Second, we
identify the key barriers which impede the ¯ ow of this nance to new and early stage
ventures DEMO Finally, we summariz e some of the implications for the developmen DEMO of
public policy.

Methodolog y
The inherent di culties involved in identifying samples of business angel s are well
understood . Business angel DEMO are an invisible populatio n who are not listed in any
directories and there are no public records of their transactions . Most studies DEMO
fore, of necessity, are based either on snowbal l survey techniques or use samples of
convenience . Moreover , the strong desire of DEMO business angels for anonymit y
(Benjami n and Margulis 2000 ) DEMO the private and sensitive nature of the subjec t
matter (Haar DEMO al. 1988) generally results in low respons e rates to posta DEMO questionnair e
surveys and requests for interviews. Thus, any sampling approac DEMO has multiple source s
of potentia l bias. However, as the DEMO and characteristic s of the populatio n are
unknow n and probabl y unknowabl e (Wetzel 1983), it is not possibl e to assess the
extent of bias in any individua l sample.
The pape DEMO is based on a posta l survey of investor s registered with the Nationa l
Business Angels Network (NBAN).3 NBAN was formed in 1999 on the initiative of
the Departmen t of Trade an d DEMO y and is built upon a number of pre-existin g
local an d regional business angel networks with the intention of signi cantl y DEMO
cing and increasing the ¯ ow of investment opportunitie s to investors . Other aspects of
its remit are to help raise awareness of DEMO role of busines s angel nanc e and encourag e
more investmen t into growth businesses . NBAN is structure d as a federation DEMO inde-
pendent local/regional and nationa l business angel networks termed special associ-
ates who pool informatio n on their investmen t opportunitie s DEMO that they are
available to all investor s across the system . This is achieve d by means of the following
services: (1) a BestMatch service, a web site containin g searchabl e business oppor -
tunities; (2) a monthl y Bulletin, listing new business DEMO ; and (3) regular
presentation s by businesse s to investor s at locally held meetings. NBAN currentl y
(April 2001 ) has 26 special associates .4 These comprise both commercially-oriente d
networks run by DEMO sector organization s and also networks run either by, or on
DEMO of, public sector and other not-for-pro t organization s engaged in DEMO s
developmen t or regional development. In addition to Departmen t of Trade and

Industr y (DTI) support , DEMO receives sponsorshi p from several private sector com-
panies, mostly in DEMO nancial sector.
Business angels who are registered with networks clearly come under the categor y of
a sample of convenience . The attraction of DEMO investor s for researchers is that by
joining a business angel network they have shed their cloak of invisibility. Although
their names an d DEMO s are not made public, some networks have been willing to
DEMO e questionnaire s to their clients on behalf of researchers on the ground s that
improved informatio n on the market will enable them DEMO improve their service.5
However, it remains unclear whether busines s angels DEMO join business ange l networks
are in any way distinctive. We have argued elsewhere that any risk of bias is greatest if
a sample DEMO drawn from a single business angel network (Mason and Harrison 1997)DEMO
The importan t characteristi c of NBAN s investor databas e is that it includes the clients
of a number of business angel networks DEMO t England and Wales. We anticipat e
that this will have the eÚ ect of reducing an y bias.6
A total of 84 response DEMO were received by the deadline for their return. This repre-
sents a 20% respons e rate. As other commentator s have noted (Haar et al. 1988,
Benjami n and Margulis 2000) , business angels seek to safeguar d their privac y and
so are likely to be DEMO to respon d to questionnaires , even anonymously . In these
circumstances , the respons e rate is quite acceptable , particularly when the DEMO of
the questionnair e is take n into account (12 pages, 46 questions) .7 The majority of
investor s registere d with NBAN are private individuals i.e. business angels and
others representing business angel syndicates DEMO However, some professiona l intermedi-
aries (e.g. accountants) , non- DEMO corporation s engage d in corporat e venturin g
and venture capital funds are also registered with NBAN. Just under 90% of response s
DEMO from busines s angels. This paper is based only on the response s of business angel s
(n = 74). Amongst the business angel respondents , 91% were male and 9% were
female. This represents DEMO much higher proportio n of women than in previous surveys
of business angels where the male respons e was typically 99%. The regional distribu-
DEMO of business angel respondent s was weighted towards the south of England
(table 1).

Income and net wort h
Most business angels have a high net worth and signi cant income. Just under three-
DEMO s (71%) of respondents to our survey have a net worth (excluding principal
residence) in excess of £500 000, with millionaire s comprising 62% of all respondents .
In terms of income, 12% had £250 000 or more, 43% were in the £100 000 £249 000
range with a furthe r 39% in the £50 000 £99 000 DEMO However, whereas wealth is
a necessary condition for someone to become DEMO busines s angel, in most case s it is not
su DEMO The source of wealth is also signi cant. Business angel s are much more likely
to have achieved their wealthy statu s throug h DEMO own eÚ orts, as oppose d to having
inherited it (i.e. rst generatio n money) and, in particular , have achieved their DEMO
throug h entrepreneuria l activity rathe r than in a high incom e occupation .8 This is
re¯ ected in this study : 71% DEMO our respondent s had founded one or more businesses ; on
averag e the respondent s had started two businesse s and 9% of DEMO s had
founded ve or more businesses . Thus, as previous DEMO has suggested , one of
the very few sustainabl e generalization s that can be made about business angels,
who in most other DEMO are a very heterogeneou s population , is that they are
typically successful cashed-ou t entrepreneurs .
3.2
Motives for investing
Business angels invest DEMO unlisted companies predominantl y for nancial reasons (table
2). By DEMO the most importan t reason is the potentia l for high capital appreciation ,
with current /future income ranked third. However, con rming previous research,
non- nancial motives emerge as a very strong secondar DEMO consideration for becomin g
a busines s angel. Indeed, personal satisfaction DEMO being involved with entrepre -
neurial businesses is the second most importan t reason for investing . Another signi -
cant non- nancial reason DEMO investing in unlisted companies is a way of having fun
with my money . For most of these busines s angels there is no DEMO between

nancial and non- nancial motives: it is a both/and rather than an either/or choice.
Signi cant DEMO y consideration s for investing include to make use of tax breaks
and the desire to suppor t the next generatio n of entrepreneurs DEMO However, in other
respects business angels are not motivate d by DEMO c concerns, with 85% stating
that the suppor t of sociall DEMO useful product s and services is not a reason for investing . As
other research has suggeste d (Barker 1999) , most busines DEMO angels regard their invest-
ment activity as totall y separat e from their philanthropi c activities. Finally, most
business angels do not inves t to receive persona l recognitio n in the community :
respondent s were almost unanimou s in stating that this is not a consideration DEMO
Business angel investmen t is, therefore, primaril y an economi c phenomenon , under-
taken by investor s in the expectatio n of DEMO cant returns. However, the secondar y
importanc e of a desire DEMO involvemen t in the entrepreneuria l process emphasizes that
business angel investor s bring more than money to the deal, and seek to contribut e
their experience and knowledge to their investments. Indeed, 94% of respondents
describ e themselve s as hands-o n investor s who bring a DEMO range of experience in
terms of functiona l expertise, length of DEMO managemen t or professiona l experience
and industry knowledge to their investee businesses .
3.3
Investmen t activity: actual and potential
Of the 74 business angels who responded, 52 (70%) had made investment s in the 3
years prior to the survey. These investor s had collectively DEMO £12.25 million in
118 businesses .9 Assuming that the investo r characteristic s of the sampl e are repre-
sentative , this translate s DEMO an estimat e of around £60 million invested in ove r 600
businesse s by NBAN investor s in the 3 years prior to DEMO survey. For most business
angels these investment s represented only a relatively small proportio n of their invest-
ment portfolio, typically between 5 and 10%. The remainder of their portfolio is
invested in the stock marke DEMO (93% of investors) , property (62%) an d banks /DEMO
societies (57%) and, to a lesser extent, bonds (49%) and gilts (36%) . Relatively few
business angels invest in art/DEMO , collectibles or other more esoteric categorie s
(table 3), DEMO rming that they are investment rather than consumption investors .

However, many business angels are prepared to allocate a highe r proportion of their
investmen t DEMO o to investment s in unliste d companies (median = 20%) (table 4).
The factors that in¯ uence the proportio n of their portfolio that business angels
invest in unliste d companies appears to DEMO largely determined by persona l rather
than environmenta l considerations . As table 5 shows, the tax regime and, to a lesser
extent, economic growth are the only economi c factors that have a signi DEMO in¯ u-

and speci cally on the proportio DEMO of their portfoli o that is invested in unliste d busi -
nesses. Higher rates of capital gains tax and higher tax on dividend DEMO would
each discourage half of the respondent s from investing in unliste d companies .
Conversely, reducing the rate of capital gains tax would encourag e 52% of investor s
to invest more (26% would be encourage d a lot ) while reducing tax on dividends
would encourag DEMO 43% of investor s to invest more in unliste d companies . A total of
74% of business angel s would be encourage d DEMO inves t more (43% a lot more ) by
front-en d DEMO reliefs. This emphasis on tax is consisten t with the earlier evidence on
motives for investing , which noted that making use of tax DEMO is an importan t
reason for making investments . Indeed, 38% DEMO the investment s made by respondent s
used the Enterprise Investmen t Scheme.10 It also suggest s that the recent introductio n
of a DEMO gains tax taper which reduces the rate of capital gains tax for higher rate
taxpayer s to just 10% after an asset has been DEMO for 2 years should have the eÚ ect
of increasing the amount of nance that business angels are willing to invest in unlisted
companies DEMO In contrast , more than half of all respondent s are not in¯ uenced by
interest rates, stock market trends or the rate of in¯ ation, and less than one-quarte r
of investor s are in¯ uenced by propert y prices.
3.4
Time constraints
The process of investing DEMO considerabl e time: there is a need to identify poten-
tial DEMO t opportunities ; onc e identi ed, the process of assessing , structurin g and
negotiatin g the investment can be lengthy; and DEMO invested, most business angel s
then devote signi cant amount s DEMO time to supporting their investee businesses .
Respondent s to this survey work an averag e of 6 days per month in each of DEMO
portfolio companies. Moreover , for most business angels, investing is a DEMO e
activity. Thus, while business angels may have additiona l capital DEMO , they
may not have su cient time to add to their existing portfolio of investment s in
unquote d companies . Indeed, previous studies have con rmed that the lack of time
to search for DEMO evaluat e investmen t opportunitie s are signi cant barriers to invest-
ment (Mason and Harrison 1999) . In this survey more than DEMO f (57%) of the
respondent s con rmed that there is an upper limit to the number of investment s in
their portfoli DEMO that they are capable of managin g eÚ ectively. The averag e maximum
portfolio size is ve investment s but one in ten investor DEMO gave a limit of more than 10
investments . The key constraint s are, rst, insu cient time to monitor the per-
formance DEMO additiona l investment s (45%) and, second, the time availabl e to play a
hands-on role (45%) . However, the vast majority of business angels in this survey
reported that they have not DEMO the limit of their investmen t capacity .
3.5
Summary
This section has establishe d that business angels do have potentia l untappe d DEMO
that is availabl e for investmen t in unquote d companies. They are willing to allocate a
higher proportion of their investmen t portfolios DEMO such investment s an d have the time
available to search for and manag e additiona l investments . Recent changes to the tax
DEMO some of which were announce d after the survey was undertake n seem likely
to reinforce their willingness to increase their investment s in DEMO d companies .

Indeed, more than 90% of respondent s are currently looking to make further invest-
ments. The DEMO s that they have available to invest range from aroun d £10 000 to
ove r £1 million, with an averag e of £100 000 (tabl e 6) and in aggregat e terms is very
DEMO cant, exceeding the amoun t that they have collectively invested in DEMO 3 years
prior to the survey. Extrapolatin g from this sampl e to the population of angel investor s
registered with NBAN, this suggest s that NBAN members have aroun d £70 million
available for investment DEMO If business angel s are unable to invest this money in unlisted
companies it will be redirected predominantl y to the Stock Market, banks and build-
ing societies and property . The remainder of this paper DEMO considers whether
business angels encounte r barriers to investing in unlisted companies and, if so, what
form they take and how they might DEMO overcome .
4.
Barrier s
to
investmen t
A useful way in which to structur e this discussio n of potential barriers to investmen DEMO
for business angels is in terms of the three key stages in the investmen t decision-makin g
process: screening, evaluation and negotiatio n (Maso n and Roger s 1997, Feeney et al.
1999) . DEMO rst aspect is the business angel s investmen t criteria. The rst reaction of
business angels when screening an investmen t opportunit y is DEMO consider the extent of
the t’ with their own persona l investmen t criteria (Maso n and Roger s 1997). Having
establishe d that an opportunit y satis es their persona l investmen t criteria DEMO then
go on to evaluat e its intrinsi c merits. The nal stage in the investment process is the
negotiatio n over the terms DEMO conditions of the investment .
4.1
Investmen t criteria
Nearly two-thirds (DEMO) of respondents have clearly de ned investmen t criteria
which in¯ DEMO the types of businesse s that they will consider investing in. These
criteria include stag e of business development , industry, technology and location.
The business angel s in this study are primarily interested in investing DEMO establishe d
companies seeking expansio n nancing, early stage expansio n DEMO to a much lesser
extent start-u p nancing. Only a small minority of business angels are interested in
investing at the seed stage. A DEMO cant proportio n are also interested in investing in
managemen t buyout s and buy-in s (table 7).

DEMO
Most of the survey respondent s also impose restriction s on the industries that they
will invest in. In respons e to an open DEMO on industries that they were particularl y
intereste d in investing in, or would not consider investing in, positive response s out-
numbered DEMO e responses . This challenge s the conventiona l wisdom that business
angels are bette r able to articulat e what they would not DEMO in, rathe r than what
they would consider investing in. The DEMO preferences were generally articulate d
in very precise term s rather than in terms of broad industry sectors . Moreover , the
preferences were DEMO varied. For example, for every investor who stated an
interest in DEMO in traditiona l manufacturin g or engineering businesse s there
was anothe r who would not conside r investing in these sectors. Similarly, som e angel s
are averse to investing in technolog y sectors whereas DEMO take the opposit e view.
More than 4 out of 10 investor s expressed a strong or very strong interest in internet,
IT DEMO telecoms businesses ; interest in multimedi a and biotechnolog y was less strong
(table 8). These industr y preferences re¯ ect the fact that business angels generally
invest in sectors, markets or technologie s where they have some degree of familiarity or
direct experienc e (Kelly and Hay 1996) . More than 6 ou t of 10 investor s say that their
ability to invest is limited by their lack of DEMO of particula r industries , technol -
ogies and markets. Indeed, DEMO angel s reject an averag e of 80% of the investment
proposal s that they receive for this reason.
Over one-hal f (55%) DEMO all business angels also have a geographica l limit beyond
which they will not consider investing . For the majority of these investor s (67%) the

in continenta l Europe (10%) or North America (4%).
However, we know from anecdota l DEMO e that business angels investmen t prefer-
ences are not necessarily a good guide to their actual investments . Indeed, most of the
business angels in this study indicated that they will consider relaxing their investmen DEMO
criteria in certain circumstances , notabl y where the entrepreneur /managemen DEMO team
has high credibility (table 9), con rming othe r DEMO that angels place much greater
weight on the jockey than on the horse (Fiet 1995a , b, Van Osnabrugg e and
Robinso n DEMO , Harrison and Mason 2002) . Investor s will also be DEMO likely to inves t
if the referral is recommended by a trusted source (Harriso n et al. 1997). Othe r factors
that encourag e some investor s to relax their investmen t criteria are the DEMO of
the business close to the investor s home which has the eÚ ect of reducing transactio n
and monitorin g costs and a DEMO deal size which may encourag e a speculativ e
investment.

Quality
of investment opportunities
The quality of deal ¯ ow that business angel DEMO see is a further signi cant barrier to
investment . In this survey, 81% of respondent s indicated that their ability to inves t is
limited by the quality of the opportunitie s that they see. DEMO to the angels
themselves , the main de ciencies in the proposal s that they see are business plans
which contain unrealistic assumption s DEMO informatio n that is not credible and, second,
the entrepreneur /managemen t team lacks credibility. Signi cant, although less fre-
quently cited, weaknesses include insu cient informatio n provided , business concept
require s further developmen t and limited growth prospect s of the business (table 10).
This is consisten t with the few other studies to DEMO examine d the investment decision-
making process of busines s angel s (Maso n and Harrison 1996a, Mason and Roger s
1997, Feeney et al. 1999).
The deal ¯ ow that business angels receive DEMO from a variety of formal and
informal sources. For this group of investor s all registered with NBAN it is not

signi DEMO sources of deal ¯ ow are informal busines s associates , friends, media and

investmen t opportunitie s from formal source s such as accountants , lawyers, ventur e

which business angels search for investmen t opportunitie s (Wetzel 1981, Mason and

4.3
Failure to negotiate
A nal reason why business angels do not invest as frequentl y as they would like is that
DEMO fail to negotiat e a deal with the entrepreneu r that is acceptabl e to both sides. This
occurs surprisingl y often. Indeed, a previous study noted that busines s angel s made
four times as DEMO oÚ ers to invest as were accepted (Mason and Harrison 1996b) . In
this surve y 53% of respondents indicated that there had DEMO occasions in the 3 years
prior to the survey in most case s just one or two when they had wanted to inves t
DEMO had failed to agre e on the terms and condition s of the investment . By far the main
reasons why the investment was DEMO made was because the angel and entrepreneur
could not agree on either the price or the shareholdin g structur e (tabl e 12). This may
re¯ ect unrealistic expectations on the part of one or DEMO, or both, parties.
5.
Conclusion s
The study underline s the signi cance of the informal venture capital marke t as a
sourc DEMO of nance for unliste d companies . Business angels registered with NBAN
have made an estimated 600 + investment s involving an investmen t DEMO som e £60
million in the 3 years prior to the survey. As most business angels do not register
with business angel networks this DEMO of investment activity represents just the tip of
the iceberg. Furthermore , their investmen t potentia l is enormous: business angels
registered with NBAN have an estimated £70 million availabl e for investmen t in
unlisted DEMO s and the averag e business angel is willing to double the proportion
of his/her investmen t portfolio that is currently allocate d DEMO unlisted companies. The
governmen t can take some of the credit for helping to create this pool of nance.
Business angels are highly sensitive DEMO the tax regime, and the willingness of active
investor s to DEMO the proportio n of their investmen t portfolio that they allocate to
investment s in unliste d companies can be attributed , in part, to the eÚ ect of tax
incentives such as the Enterprise Allowance DEMO and the Capital Gains Tax
taper. These initiatives may also be expecte d to have encourage d othe r high net
worth self-made individuals DEMO become business angels.
However, there are signi cant constraint s on DEMO ability of business angels to inves t
as frequently as they would wish, or as much as they would wish:11
284
COLIN MASON AND RICHARD HARRISON
. business angels do not see DEMO businesse s that meet their investmen t cri-
teria, and their DEMO to relax these investment criteria is limited by their
reluctance to invest in unfamiliar industries and markets;
. the majority of the investmen DEMO proposal s that they see are of poor quality;
. to a lesser extent, they fail to negotiat e acceptabl e term s and condition s with
entrepreneurs.
The clear implication of this study is DEMO the eÚ ectiveness of current governmen t
intervention s in the informal ventur e capital market to increase the amount of equity
capital that DEMO channelled to new and growing businesse s involving the provisio n of
tax incentive s and contributin g to the operatin g costs of DEMO angel networks will
be limited because of the existenc e of variou s barriers that prevent busines s angel s
from investing as often DEMO they would like to. This evidence therefore suggests that the
time has come to fundamentall y redesign the concept of busines s angel networks. DEMO
originall y conceived, business angel networks were base d on a DEMO s of information
ine ciencies in this capital market. As a result, they have been establishe d to provid e
a channel of communicatio n between investor s and entrepreneur s in order to mini-
mize DEMO cost of the entrepreneur s searc h for capital, and enabling DEMO s to exam -
ine investmen t opportunitie s that meet their screening criteria, without compromising
their anonymity . Business ange l networks have been judged to be a success, both in
terms of their direct impacts (promotio n of investmen t opportunities , mobilizatio n of
capital, investmen t activity) , induced investmen t eÚ ects (leverage d bank lending),
indirect eÚ ects (advic e and signposting , DEMO) and cost-per-jo b (Harriso n and
Mason 1996 , but see Blatt and Riding 1996 , for a dissenting view). However, con-
ventiona l BANs will not cause reluctant potentia l investor s to DEMO the market, nor
will they cause the owners of lifestyle rms DEMO attemp t to expand their businesse s by
using external equity capital. Neither are they able to exert much quality control over
either their DEMO or business clients. Furthermore , they withdraw from the process
as soon as the introduction is made, and so play no role in the pricing and structurin g
of any deal, which are signi cant deal breakers (Freear et al. 1994) . The clear
implication is therefore DEMO there is a need to develop second generation BANs
whose role is much wider than simply being an informatio n broker , supplyin g DEMO -
mary informatio n on investmen t opportunitie s to business angels. The focus of such
BANs shoul d be on educating the marke DEMO place.12
Many business angels have fairly narrow investmen t criteria which they will only
relax in certain circumstances . Thus, the probabilit y that a particula r opportunit y will
be of interest to any single DEMO is fairly low. This underlines the importanc e of
achieving critical mass in terms of investor s an d investmen t opportunities .
Accordingly, BANs must becom e much more proactiv e in their marketin g DEMO orts.
In addition , they must also seek ways in which they can broaden the investmen t
criteria of investors, for example, by DEMO educationa l activitie s13 and encourag e
the formatio n of investor syndicates . The feasibility of providin g independen t technol -
ogy DEMO diligence service s shoul d also be revisited (Freear et al. DEMO, Mason and
Harrison 1998). More generally, BANs need to raise the knowledge and competence
of both entrepreneur s and busines s angels DEMO also the small business suppor t net-
work accountants , lawyers, DEMO, consultant s and advisers , etc. by developing
educationa l materials DEMO running workshop s and seminars. There are three speci c
priorities. First, BANs must seek to educate entrepreneur s on the advantage s of equity
nancing, in order to convert the need for equity nance into demand.14 Second,

BANs DEMO to ensure businesse s are investor ready when they are promote d to
investor s and business angels . This involves helping entrepreneur s DEMO understan d the
expectation s and requirements of investor s and how to make their business plans into
attractive investment opportunitie s (Maso n and Harrison 2001) . Previous studies have
highlighte d problems associate d with incomplete information in busines s plans
(Mason and Rogers 1997) DEMO presentationa l de ciencies (Mason and Harrison
2000c). Third, bearing in mind that business angels are a heterogeneou s population
with di DEMO levels of familiarity with techniques of investing , ranging from successful
cashed-ou t serial entrepreneur s on the one hand to inexperienced and virgin DEMO -
tors on the other, there is a need for BANs DEMO help the latter group to raise their
competenc e in all aspects of doing the deal how to nd, evaluate , price, structure ,
monitor , add value and exit from ventur e deals. However, rede ning the role of BANs
in this way raises obviou s DEMO s of resourcing. To become more proactiv e and to
engage in a wider range of investor and entrepreneu r education will requir e DEMO -
tial additional funding and it will not be possibl e to recoup the additiona l cost s
throug h registration fees and success DEMO The rational e for governmen t and other
sponsor s to provid e additiona l funding, as always, is that a thriving informal DEMO e
capital market is a pre-requisit e for a vigorou s enterprise economy (Advisory Council
on Science and Technonogy [ACOST] 1990 : 41). This receives con rmation in the
Global Enterprise Monitor [GEM] 2001 study, which reports that the prevalence of
informal investor s has a statisticall DEMO signi cant positive associatio n with the overall
level of entrepreneuria l activity and a stronge r relationshi p with the level of oppor DEMO
tunity entrepreneurship . In other words, in countries where the population DEMO invest-
ing more persona l funds, the level of opportunity-drive n DEMO l activity is
signi cantly higher (Reynold s et al. 2001: 22).
In examining the role of the informal ventur e capital DEMO t in the funding of
ventures at their seed, start-u p DEMO early growth stages, it is no longer su cient to
de DEMO the problem as a lack of available capital: business angels have DEMO cant funds
available and are prepare d to invest more. Nor is it a matter of the mobilization of the
capital that is available , which intermediatio n initiatives such as BANs address , as a
signi cant proportion of investor s report receiving poor qualit y (non-investable ) busi-
ness opportunitie s being presente d to them from this source DEMO Rather, the issue is
fundamentall y one of competence: many investor s lack familiarity with technique s
of successful investing , the opportunitie DEMO which come forward more often than not are
not investment ready , and the botto m level service provider s in the smal l DEMO s
suppor t network lack the expertise needed to add value to the process.

Moreover , this was an exceptional and wholly untypical year. In 1999, venture capital funds made 260
early-stage investments (23% of the total) and in 199 8 made 241 such investments (21% ) (BVCA
DEMO).
It should be noted that national in this context means Englan d and Wales. LINC Scotland, which is
not a member of NBAN, provides business angel network services for Scotland.
One of these special associates, Equity Link, comprises a network of 12 local BANs in southern DEMO .
This study, which was commissioned by the National Business Angel DEMO, is in this category.
It is acknowledged that business angels who DEMO members of a business angel network may not be fully
representative of the business angel population as a whole. For example, it can be hypothesized that
such business angels may be biased towards those with poorer DEMO networks (an d therefore have a

more critical need for networking) , smaller amounts to invest DEMO remoter locations. However, it is
impossible to empirically test for the DEMO of any biases because of the di culties in identifying
business angels (Wetzel 1981 , Mason and Harriso n 1994) . Moreover , DEMO studies of angels who are
members of BANs does not support this stereotype (Mason and Harrison 1999) .
It was not possible to DEMO for non-response bias because for reason s of con dentiality we were not
provide d with any personal informatio n that NBAN holds on DEMO registered investors.
In this respect, respondents di er from the recently DEMO ed so-called mass aÞ uent class in the UK
these are similar in income and net wealth terms, but this has been mostly acquired from employment,
notably in the nancial services sector, and they have limited exposure to entrepreneurial activity of any
sort (also see Anderson 1998) .
Just under one-quarter (24% ) of these investments were identi DEMO through informatio n provide d by
NBAN.
This scheme provides private investors making investments in qualifying unquoted companies with
income tax relief on the DEMO invested, any investment gains are exempt from capital gains tax
and DEMO losses from the investment can be set against future income tax liabilities and it provide s the
ability to roll-ove r tax on capital DEMO s arisin g from the disposal of other assets (Inland Revenue DEMO) .
In view of the geographically fragmented nature of the informal DEMO capital market it is quite
possible that there are regional variation s in the strength of these impediments to investing.
However, it has not been possible to explore this issue with the available data. This is DEMO fruitful avenue
of enquiry for future research.
Lange et al. (2002 ) highlight an additional pressure on BANs that is prompting such a change in focus.
They argu e that the impact of the internet is DEMO it harder and harder for BANs to charge for their
basic matchmaking services because it has become easier for entrepreneurs to nd sources of DEMO
without their help. This is putting pressure on BANs to add valu e to their services. They expect that
BANs will respond by evolving DEMO pure intermediation services to become a one stop resourcing
service where nance is just one piece of a very complex package that also includes DEMO building,
management recruitment, advisor y boards, directors, etc.
A DEMO example is CONNECT, which was initially developed in San Diego but DEMO since been cloned in
several other localities around the world, including DEMO and Sweden. Its objective is to support the
creation, development and DEMO h of technology-based enterprises. It does this in a variety of ways,
including a programm e of seminars, brie ngs, workshop s DEMO forum s designed to develop the knowledge
and expertise of the investment community, advisers and policy-makers. One of the elements in this
programm e is a Technology brie ng .
The extent of equity aversion is DEMO by the following statistic: four out of every ve small rms
DEMO are referred by banks to LINC Scotland to raise equity nance from business angels refuse to go
