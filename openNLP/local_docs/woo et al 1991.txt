The impact of the entrepreneur on the development and subsequent success
of a new venture DEMO been demonstrated in many studies. Indeed one of
the most important judgement calls of professionals assisting entrepreneurs
is to evaluate their strengths, limitations, DEMO practices, and like-
lihood of success. Research has responded to the DEMO for such evaluation
with dtjferent attempts to identify the relevant characteristics of the en-
trepreneur that may bear upon the management practices and subsequent DEMO of new ventures.
One direction of this research has led to the identijcation of different types of entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs within each typology share common DEMO but direr significantly from those of other
types. Such attempts are useful in that they identify key differences within the larger population of
entrepreneurs DEMO do so in a way that yields holistic and meaningful portrayals. More importantly,
classtjications allow us to make better predictions, based on membership in a specific typology, about
the likely behavior, responses, and success of the entrepreneur. These offer a power&l conceptual
tool for the DEMO of entrepreneurs during the start-up or early stages of a venture before the
track record of the individual involved can be established and observed.
DEMO studies over the last decade appear to converge on two types of entrepreneurs,
craftsmen and opportunists.

in regard to an array of characteristics and DEMO For example, the two types appear to engage
in deferent levels DEMO explicit planning and information gathering in preparation for the start-up of
business. The ventures shared by the two types can also be contrasted along DEMO dimensions as size,
capital, the presence of partners, and relatedness to prior experience. The two types also manage
differently as exhibited in DEMO formality of administrative procedures, allocation of time to dt$Ierent
functions, spans of control, and levels of authority. Some evidence suggests that the typology even
appears to distinguish entrepreneurs in terms of attitudes toward risk, adaptiveness to change, and
cognitive processing of opportunities. Most important, the classification DEMO to suggest that typologies
differ in regard to growth potential and the likelihood that ventures will proceed to the next life cycle
stage. The DEMO consisting of these two types of entrepreneurs represents a critical contribution
to the extent that it possesses strong predictive power regarding a range of DEMO behavior
and performance.
This study focuses upon the conceptual frameworks used and spec$ic methods applied in de-
veloping entrepreneurial typologies. It examines the extent DEMO which different entrepreneurial typologies
are consistent. It seeks to alert us to how the methods used in developing typologies affect the results.
It suggests DEMO typologies developed to date lack comparability and predictive power.
A close examination of previous studies disclosed major differences in the criteria used to
classify DEMO Thus, craftsmen in one study might have been identt$ied on the DEMO of two
characteristics, whereas another study employed as many as SO DEMO In some studies, all entre-
preneurs are classtfied into typologies, whereas in others, many entrepreneurs are “in-bemeens” and
left unclassified. The same labels have often been applied to types derived through divergent meth-
odologies, suggesting a degree of commonality that may be misleading. There is the appearance DEMO
a body of consistent and additive knowledge about craftsmen and opportunist entrepreneurs that does
not rest upon a careful consideration of the methodologies employed.
DEMO, how likely are we to obtain the same groupings of entrepreneurs DEMO different classification
schemes as implicitly assumed in the cross-references we have accepted?This study explicitly evaluated
the impact of such differences by contrasting the DEMO of entrepreneurs obtained through three
different classifications. It is, we think, theJirst empirical examination of the extent to which traditionally
defined entrepreneurial typologies DEMO sensitive to the classification criteria used. Patterned after
demonstrated practices in the literature, this study grouped entrepreneurs using: (1) goals; (2) goals
and background (education and experience); and (3) goals, DEMO, and management style. Within
each classification, entrepreneurs were divided into two groups using cluster analysis. The results
showed that diflerent classtfication criteria did DEMO in dtJferent groupings. In particular, classt@ation
based solely on goal orientation DEMO the most pronounced differences from the results of the
other classtfications. Second, we found that none of the three pairs of groups patterned closely the
craftsmanlopportunist delineation as described in the literature.
The primary conclusion that DEMO groupings result from different classihcation frameworks
should not be surprising, at DEMO from a methodological standpoint. Yet the problem has been totally
overlooked in the analysis and interpretation of entrepreneurial types. Very likely, the same labels
may have been applied to rather different entities. What then are the DEMO for the use of this
typology as an evaluative tool? First, we note that the dejinitions of craftsman and opportunist have
not been DEMO and take on as many variations as the number of studies on the topic. Second, the
jindings of each study have not really been corroborated by jindings in other analyses. As such, the
level of generalizability and confidence attached to each must be checked. Third, the cumulative
evidence in the body of literature on entrepreneurial typologies cannot be taken as DEMO knowledge
about the wide range of characteristics associated with each type. Hence, the predictive power of the
craftsman-opportunist typology cannot be taken for granted. Fourth, it remains to be demonstrated
what percentage of the population of entrepreneurs can be represented by the two types. How universal
are craftsman DEMO opportunist entrepreneurs or can only some entrepreneurs be classified in this way?
Do other types, though yet unidentified, exist? The above reservations lead us to conclude that while
the craftsman-opportunist classification appears to serve DEMO a useful yardstick for measuring the
potential behavior and likely success of entrepreneurs, its applicability and scope may have been
exaggerated
