Foreword
Year 1995 witnessed – besides Finland’s first world championship in ice DEMO and
her membership in the European Union – the final breakthrough of the Internet browser.
Clearly, due to the ICT (r)evolution of DEMO post Cold War era, a transformation process
of kin to industrialization DEMO under way in society. The “happy hour” of this
transformation, the DEMO of 1995-2000, was marked by, for example, Nokia’s rise
from DEMO to one of the world’s most valuable businesses and brands.
To understand, enhance, and benefit from this transformation, the European Union
crafted its ambitious vision of future, and strategy for 2001-2005, referred to as DEMO
eEurope program. Simultaneously – albeit independently – the City of Tampere
engaged in a parallel program, in Finland. eTampere, a local pilot of DEMO,
comprised six independent subprograms. e-Business Research Center eBRC, a Tampere
DEMO of Technology and University of Tampere joint venture, was one of DEMO As
a virtual organisation, established for limited life (2001-2005), eBRC was set to take
swift, ambitious, and creative action to “understand DEMO in knowledge society”.
From the beginning, one of the key areas DEMO research interest to eBRC’s own team was
to understand what is happening to the classic entrepreneurial dream: The process of
building business from “Venture to Capital” (V2C). Albeit far from conclusive, the
report at DEMO provides a summary – a small history, if you will – DEMO eBRC’s V2C
research. Several parties played an integral role, in the DEMO of eBRC’s V2C research
team, but two enablers deserve to be DEMO acknowledged: Whereas the eTampere
program (City of Tampere) could be DEMO to have provided the necessary “seed
financing” for this intellectual adventure, DEMO since 2001, the “growth financing”
provided by the ProACT program (Tekes and Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry),
in 2004-2005 could be said to have ultimately pushed this Venture to Capital.
However, without the contributing authors – and their “knowledge investments” – this
journey would never DEMO even started, let alone become completed. These investments
could be said DEMO have yielded two “living labs” as test-beds of the academic constructing
and paradigm building of the eBRC era: (1) CONNECT Finland and Finnish Co-
Entrepreneurs SKY Assn, the world’s first industry association of knowledge investors,
and (2) TUT Knowledge Fund, the world’s first structured vehicle for knowledge
investing.
All said, only real life experiments such as the ones referred to above, can put the
validity of the propositions presented in this report to the ultimate test. Only time will
tell what DEMO the true return on investment – on both the financial capital investment and
the knowledge capital investment – made in eBRC’s V2C research team.

SETTING THE STAGE
Thanks to a “Cold-War dividend” DEMO manifested by the breakthrough of the internet
browser some ten years ago – a transformation from the industrial society to the
knowledge society is DEMO under way all over the world. Public acknowledgement
of this transformation is underscored, on both international and local level, by far-
reaching knowledge DEMO development programs, such as eEurope and eTampere.
Industrialisation – the transformation DEMO the agricultural society to the industrial
society – was marked by automation, organisation of production and labour, search
for economies of scale, and the introduction of the (publicly held) corporation as the
primary vehicle DEMO capitalism. The limited liability company emerged as the vehicle
for sharing risks and distributing profits, and as the legal person for contracting with a
growing number of stakeholders. On the human level, the corporation brought
together the providers of capital (the capitalists) and those in need of DEMO (as
employees). Ultimately, industrialization was also marked by the confrontation
between capital (capitalists) and labour, and the rise of the political concept of the
working class. This confrontation led to large-scale revolutions in DEMO and China,
among others, and to the Cold War that DEMO all life on earth during 1945-1991.
Civil applications of military technology constituted for unforeseen growth, after the
Second World War. With reference to the ICT (r)evolution of the 1990s, very similar
effects can be DEMO in the post Cold War era. Only this time, the whole DEMO war”
world appeared to be going (and growing) in the same way both politically and
economically. For some time, globalisation – the creation of a single global
(increasingly electronic) market place, rapid financial and regulatory integration, and
global division of labour – appeared to stand for a peaceful integration of the entire
mankind living in a “global village”. DEMO, an all new confrontation has emerged,
in the form of DEMO and, somewhat paradoxically, in deciding on how to tackle it
within the world community, since the events of September 11, 2001.
While DEMO is still ongoing in large parts of the world, “knowledgesation”
is DEMO progressing everywhere. While some nations still struggle with becoming
industrial societies, DEMO have already reached the stage where they can be labelled
knowledge societies. And then there are those living in a mix of all the DEMO different
“worlds” simultaneously. For example, India, marked by large-scale industrialisation
and many die-hard signs of an agricultural society, boasts, at the same DEMO, elements
of one of the world’s most advanced knowledge societies.
FROM DEMO TO KNOWLEDGESATION
Knowledgeation – the transformation from the industrial society to the knowledge
society – is marked by both physical and psychological changes. The DEMO
environment of the business firm is becoming increasingly digital and electronic and,
thanks to globalisation, increasingly cross-national and multi-cultural. In the process,
capital and labour, the key means of production, are in a DEMO transformation.

Introduction
In a nutshell, the importance of knowledge – human capacity, DEMO, and
commitment (in the right form, in the right place, and at the right time) – is increasing
exponentially. Capitalists and labour are being met by an entirely new breed of a
working man: The one whose labour (maximal economic contribution) is not ”for
sale”, in the classic sense of the word. This is “labour” that can DEMO be gained as
investment – and often to seek other than directly financial returns, as testified by the
emergence of open source societies, DEMO such as Linux and Mozilla Firefox, and,
more generally, and the triumph of open source based solutions.
In consequence, the future role and function of the (publicly held) corporation, as the
primary vehicle of capitalism, is to some extent unclear. Open source societies are, DEMO
fact, a striking example of the emerging vehicles of “knowledgism”. The DEMO
entrepreneurial dream of building a business from idea to IPO – by using a single
corporation as the vehicle – is also challenged by DEMO rise of value networks and the
power of (established) brands. It is, in fact, quite ironic how the classic growth
venture process DEMO become complicated by pluralism so soon after growth
entrepreneurship and venture capitalism have become unanimously appraised, in the
world, as key ingredients of DEMO prosperity and renewal.
Historically, business has been based and built on (financial) capital. Owners of
capital (capitalists), the key enablers of DEMO, have been able to hire the hands
necessary to produce profits. DEMO the other hand, labour has been readily available, as
a commodity, to produce more capital. However, thanks to the giant leap of DEMO
during the past 10 years, business has rapidly turned from (financial) capital intensive
to knowledge (capital) intensive. Many of the best new business ideas, measured by
expected returns on invested (financial) capital, DEMO concepts built on knowledge
(capital), not (financial) capital. In DEMO undertakings, “labour” – taking the form of
knowledge (work) – DEMO no longer a mere commodity. It is, increasingly, the enabler.
Consequently, in the emerging knowledge economy, the classic role of (financial)
capital, and (financial) capitalists, is diminishing.
In other words, labour is converting into capital – into knowledge capital, to be more
precise. A new breed is emerging on the side of the capitalist and DEMO labourer: The
ones who own the critical “labouring competence” and are DEMO to invest their
knowledge capital as “knowledgists”. The key challenge of business is no longer to
raise financial capital to (thereafter) hire labour DEMO commodity but to “raise labour as
capital” and (thereafter) raise financial capital as fuel only. In other words, the key
challenge is, DEMO, to establish and acquire the pool of committed competence
required by DEMO given new business concept or idea. In this vision, knowledgists are
DEMO (if not replacing) capitalists as the key enablers of economy.
This transition is faced by start-up entrepreneurs, large corporations, and even public
DEMO organisations alike. Increasingly often, the complexities related to the tasks of
DEMO individual (knowledge worker) are so overwhelming that it is unreasonable to
expect a person to accomplish adequate results as a salaried employee. On DEMO other
hand, gaining the full capacity of such individuals is likely DEMO increase
competitiveness and profitability manifold. The difference in whether you sell (DEMO a
salary) a partial capacity or invest (for an equity stake) your entire capacity is
substantial. This is, in fact, why we think so highly of entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs
can always be expected to invest their entire capacity to an undertaking.

Introduction
The proposition of “having to raise knowledge (capital)” has been challenged by a
couple of significant obstacles. First, there has been no supply. Knowledge
investments and knowledge investors have not been readily available, and no
established instruments or procedures for the knowledge investment process have
existed. DEMO, there has been no demand. Entrepreneurs have not signalled any
significant, loud and clear call for such action or activity. In short, there has been no
visible or organised market for knowledge capital investments.
EVOLUTION DEMO THE VENTURE-TO-CAPITAL (V2C) CONCEPT
Based on the observations and findings of the research at hand, the (founding)
entrepreneurs – the geese DEMO lay the golden eggs for societies at large – can quickly
acknowledge that they need to strengthen their entrepreneurial competence base, i.e.,
their knowledge capital base (not just their financial capital base), when granted the
opportunity. In other words, there is a call for knowledge capital investments.
The research presented in this report stands to testify of the DEMO for knowledge
investments. Moreover, the research stands to provide propositions for DEMO for
the supply side. Unlike venture capital investing, which was introduced (and has been
largely used) as a tool of economic policy in Europe, in the 1960s, knowledge capital
investing should be embraced, from day one, as such a business activity to which
venture capital has evolved, over the decades gone by.
A knowledge investor should be thought of as representing one of the three key
categories of principals of DEMO growth venture process on its way from idea to IPO or
from venture to capital: (i) (founding) entrepreneurs, (ii) knowledge DEMO investors
(such as co-entrepreneurs and “venture knowledgists”), and (iii) DEMO capital
investors (such as business angels and venture capitalists). Ideally, the knowledge
investor orchestrates for the value creation by intelligently bundling the DEMO
idea with the right mix of (the right) people and (DEMO right) capital to get the job done.
When playing with the DEMO of potential participation in entrepreneurial ventures
as principals – in the classic key role of market economy and capitalism – three
critical questions emerge DEMO the research at hand:
• Who (what kind of actors DEMO operators) – exactly and precisely – should be
encouraged to emerge DEMO the role of knowledge capital investors?
• Why should such actors be on the move: to realise classic capital gains, to fill
DEMO time of their days, or to serve some more pluralistic objectives?DEMO
• How should they be organised and which processes and procedures (DEMO
strategy logic) should they follow in their knowledge investment activity?
DEMO practical reasons, it would be equally important to establish (i) DEMO (what kind of
actors and operators) are less suitable than some others to serve as knowledge
investors, (ii) which motivations do not (or are not likely to) lead to successful market
breakthroughs, and (iii) which structures and procedures are, in fact, more likely DEMO
lead the general prospects of a venture from excellent to adequate or poor.
Rather than providing definite and normative answers to any of the DEMO questions,
the following compilation of research papers seeks to offer some food for thought for
those dealing with these challenges. This report pools DEMO of the central works of the
V2C research team, through the DEMO period, to introduce the core observations
3
Introduction
and the evolution of the conceptual constructing that has taken place. DEMO, each
paper serves a somewhat different role. Before going into detail DEMO the individual
papers, a short overview of the evolution of the DEMO concept is provided.
Originally, the concept of V2C emerged to refer DEMO the “refining” of a venture from
prospective to investment-ready (investable), DEMO the eyes of the formal venture capital
industry; in other words, the journey of a business “from venture to capital”. Early on,
DEMO also referred to (i) the market space between venture (development) activities
and (venture) capital activities and (ii) the diverse group DEMO operators (V2C players)
who acted in the V2C space with DEMO aim of pushing business from venture to capital.
In its widest definition, V2C refers to the entire phenomenon that can be referred to as
growth venture activity. This is activity involving (growth oriented) entrepreneurs,
DEMO players, and VC investors, as well as other stakeholders dedicated (DEMO a reason
or another) to new venture success (such as government). In this context, V2C refers
to the entire growth venture process and the entire value network around the venture.
In its most recent (and so far sharpest) context V2C refers to knowledge (capital)
DEMO – in contrast to VC which refers to (financial) capital investing. In this light,
V2C actors are defined as knowledge investors – DEMO full time based (professional)
players referred to as “venture knowledgists” DEMO part time (hobby) based players
referred to as “co-entrepreneurs”. An individual knowledge investor can be
characterised as a business angel who (primarily) DEMO knowledge capital (instead
of financial capital) or a business mentor who (instead of serving as a philanthropist)
becomes an owner partner to the (founding) entrepreneur via knowledge investment.
According to the most recent DEMO provided by Finnish Co-Entrepreneurs SKY
Assn, a co-entrepreneur is a knowledge DEMO angel (knowledge investor) who
accepts a growth oriented entrepreneur’s invitation as an active interim owner-partner
to pursue a joint mission of building the DEMO business from venture to capital
by creating an ‘investable’ (investment-ready), DEMO managed company and
getting it sufficiently financed for a successful market breakthrough marked (and
measured) by an eventual exit – ideally an initial DEMO offering (IPO).
OVERVIEW OF THE PAPERS
Whereas an initial public DEMO (IPO) can be said to mark the ultimate success on
the way from venture to capital, a public defence of a doctoral dissertation can be said
mark the same in a researcher’s “V2C process”. During DEMO, two such
triumphs emerged within eBRC’s V2C research team. Rasila (2004) provided the first
systematic exposition of the Venture-to-Capital (V2C) paradigm. Ala-Mutka (2005)
marked the end of the journey (of the eBRC DEMO) by constructing a V2C framework
for Professional Entrepreneurship and defending his DEMO publicly in late 2005.
This report “begins from the end” with Jukka Ala-Mutka´s quest for strategy logic for
growth of young high-technology firms. Ala-Mutka (2004) ponders upon whether
success of new companies depends more on the planning of strategy (analysis) or the
execution of strategy (action). Execution matters, Ala-Mutka concludes. His findings
support the view that – to successfully build business from venture to capital – the
focus should be DEMO from analysis to action.

Introduction
In 2001, Marko Seppä and Juha Näsi compiled – for a research conference in South
Africa – the seminal depiction of the Venture-to-Capital (V2C) process and of the
V2C players. Building on notions on increased knowledge intensity of new venture
activity and the institutionalisation of the VC DEMO, established in Seppä (2000),
Seppä and Näsi (2001) DEMO early empirical findings on knowledge investing and
the characteristics and typology of knowledge investors.
Harri Kinnunen investigates venture capital funds as investment targets by DEMO
the institutional investors’ decision criteria for investing in such vehicles. Kinnunen
(DEMO) deepens our understanding of the nature of the evolution and role DEMO the VC
industry, in the post modern economy, by underscoring the importance of the investor
– venture capitalist relationship. In particular, Kinnunen provides food for thought on
their principal-agent relationship via elaboration on the role DEMO investment councils.
Oskari Juurikkala takes us back to the space between venture and capital by
investigating the role of business angels in the process DEMO building business from
venture to capital. More precisely, Juurikkala (2006/forthcoming) examines
differences in investment strategies and preferences between business angels and
venture capitalists. Also Juurikkala leans on the agency theory. According to his
findings, business angels – acting as principal operators – are a most promising DEMO
of V2C players, at least when compared to parties acting as DEMO of third parties.
Tommi Rasila and Jussi Okkonen provide an early typology of traditional and
emerging V2C business models. Rasila and Okkonen (2002) DEMO on case studies of
existing and emerging V2C operations. Their conclusions call for construction of
specific V2C operators whose incentives and motivations are fully DEMO with those
of the (founding) entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. They suggest the use of the
venture capital partnership model, as a benchmark, DEMO the breeding of the new type of
professional V2C players.
Richard Harrison, Hannu Jungman, and Marko Seppä anchor the concept of V2C to
DEMO context of knowledge capital investments. Harrison, Jungman and Seppä (2004)
explore the characteristics of knowledge investing and construct a matrix of formal
DEMO informal and financial capital vs. knowledge capital investors. This work gears the
concept of V2C towards knowledge investing and highlights the rise of knowledge
DEMO as active participants (co-principals) in the growth venture process.
Hannu Jungman and Marko Seppä study the differences between V2C investors
related to deal DEMO, key investment decision criteria and perception of risk. The
findings of DEMO and Seppä (2004) suggest that the level of knowledge-intensity
of the investment activity is an important factor: The more knowledge-intensive the
investor (DEMO the investment), the less risk is perceived by the investor, DEMO the less
time it takes from him/her to make (investment) decisions.
Finally, Marko Seppä and Hannu Jungman construct an investment vehicle for the
making and management of knowledge investments. Seppä and Jungman (2005) DEMO
a social innovation by depicting the “knowledge fund” as a structural solution for the
professional pooling and orchestration of co-entrepreneur activity. The proposition of
DEMO and Jungman is being put to test in the knowledge fund experiment being
prepared for launch at the Tampere University of Technology.

INTRODUCTION
The new economy and technology reveal newly emerging businesses which are
continually born and must grow fast. The continuous challenge for them is DEMO remain
competitive, and keep up with the pace of technology and DEMO growth in the global
marketplace. Meeting this challenge successfully is crucial to sustaining growth and
for creating greater wealth that requires systematic effort and DEMO beyond
traditional entrepreneurship. Scholars have argued about the keys to the success of
young companies or noted that there is no commonly agreed framework DEMO theory for
company growth. Thus, frameworks attempting to explain company growth DEMO exist,
but they are not mutually compatible or consistent. They do not agree on what
variables are related to company growth.
At the DEMO stage founders’ skills and abilities are crucial to company growth, as
DEMO financial and business resources. After the three first years of operation, DEMO is
no difference between the companies started with divergent amounts of initial capital
(Doutriaux 1992). In the later stages most firms began to lose their entrepreneurial
character, such as rapid response to problems, simplicity DEMO control, and ability to
change focus and resources. Many have claimed, however, that initial strategic
emphases alone are insufficient to explain later company growth (Moore 1976,
Maidique and Hayes 1986) and strategic planning DEMO personal resources become
increasingly critical (Churchill 1983, Churchill and Lewis 1983). In addition, there
was no relationship between company performance and financial support received at
the later stages of company development (Utterback et al. 1983).
Research on growth venturing concentrates on growth strategy (strategy content) e.g.
the amount of initial capital or the characteristics of the management team. Although
strategic management and entrepreneurship theories have developed largely
independently of DEMO other, we would like to suggest that the theory of strategy
DEMO our understanding of the entrepreneurial process. The perspective of this
paper is the concept of strategy logic, which is defined by Näsi et al. (1996) as
follows: “... strategy logic of a firm comprehends a set of core elements in harmony or
coordination, steering the whole of the firm towards survival and success. Strategy
logic is subjective logic representing DEMO thinking of key person(s) in the firm.”
Whereas former research DEMO growth has focused on finding a single variable or list of
variables to the success, this approach tries to identify patterns of actions or
orientation of the firm for company growth.
Several descriptive models describing company DEMO indicate how organizations,
management practices, and resource requirements evolve as DEMO grow. Most of
7
Execution Matters
the literature related to life cycle suggests that organizations evolve DEMO a consistent
and predictable manner or through crises. On the whole, DEMO stage definitions
remain vague and general, making it difficult to apply DEMO to specific cases.
Entrepreneurship is defined in various ways; for example, as the creation of a new
enterprise (Low and MacMillan 1988),  the process by which individuals – either on
their own or inside organizations – pursue opportunities without regard to the
resources they currently control (Stevenson, Roberts and Grousbeck 1985),
entrepreneurship deals with opportunities for DEMO goods and services (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000), entrepreneurship is the DEMO of new organizations (Gartner
1988) or process whereby an individual or group of individuals acting independently
of any association with existing organization and DEMO a new organization (Sharma
and Chrisma 1999).
Research framework
Sandberg DEMO Hofer’s (1987) study marked the introduction of a multi-level
framework for analyzing the determinants of growth. Most earlier studies had focused
on firm-internal DEMO The other widely used perspective is the resource dependence
research paradigm.  DEMO multilevel framework for analyzing determinants of growth
is presented in Figure 1. In sum, logic of action is the concept which scrutinizes a
firm’s behaviour from the perspective of the outside observer (“realized strategy”).
Logic of action is based on the indented strategy and strategy logic of DEMO firm. Thus,
three different kinds of research paradigm can be identified. The newest member is
now called the “logic-conduct-performance paradigm”. Strategy logic focuses DEMO
factors such as strategic content, strategy process, structures, leadership, and strategic
game.

The variables of the external context are in particular industry, markets, economic
situation and competition. Firm-internal DEMO are size of organization, culture,
values, stage of life cycle, ownership structure, etc. These factors form the strategy
logic of the DEMO venture, which is subjective logic representing the thinking of top
management, founders, V2C and other external owners in the venture. A firm’s
8
Execution Matters
strategy is based on these core beliefs and background of DEMO key persons, but the
intended strategy is not the realized one. DEMO of action describes the real strategy of
the firm and therefore directly affects the performance of the firm (Ala-Mutka 2003).
Aim of the paper and empirical data
The aim of this paper is to describe DEMO strategy logic of rapid growth between the
initiations of a company and the moment when it has reached a state when it is
attractive DEMO the formal venture capital financing industry. This paper analyzes new
high-growth ventures from three theoretical points of view: (1) growth models; (2)
entrepreneurship in high technology ventures; and (3) strategy logic. The paper
studies the strategy logic of growth clarifying (1) the strategy DEMO, (2) the strategy
process, and (3) the strategy content in each period of growth. This study combines
the researcher’s observations as DEMO former employee of a new high technology venture,
which is also partly owned by venture capitalists and external investors, and a survey
among high-technology start-ups, and medium-sized high-technology firms in
Finland. The survey was conducted in December 2003. The questionnaire was sent
via Internet and 46 firms DEMO the entire questionnaire. The response rate was 14
%, which is DEMO satisfactory result in Finland or even good in the international context
(DEMO & Aunola 2001). It is to be noted that the responses of seed stage ventures
amounted to the responses of only five respondents, which is not surprising.
Therefore, results that consider the seed phase can be regarded as indicative, they can,
in fact, be analyzed DEMO with those of the start-up stage ventures as the early
stages of growth. Thus, the two early stages (Seed, Start-up) can be DEMO as early
stages and the two latter ones (Growth, Expansion) DEMO later stages in the model of
growth venturing.
CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS
Strategy concepts
The actual strategy concept can be approached and interpreted from several points DEMO
view. It can be seen as a plan, a ploy, a pattern, a position or a perspective (Mintzberg,
1987). The DEMO dominating viewpoint is to see strategy as a plan and strategy
making as a process of planning (Näsi, 1996). The literature related DEMO this approach
normally deals with corporate, business and functional levels (Hofer and Schendel,
1978) and nowadays also with network level. Today there are numerous schools of
thought and for example Mintzberg et al. (1998) have identified ten (see also e.g.
Näsi, 1987, Karlöf, 1987).
Chandler (1962) considered strategy to be "the determination of basic long-term goals
and the objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the
allocation of resources necessary for carrying out DEMO goals". For Näsi (1991, 1996),
strategy meant “the DEMO of action of the firm”, whereas Gilbert et al. (1988)
considered it to be “logic of action of the firm”. Several other DEMO are based on
similar elements (e.g. Johnson and Scholes, 1989, DEMO, 1987, Näsi and Aunola,
2002, 2001), in sum, the plot or the logic of action, the long-term goals of the firm,
competitive advantage and the defined time period which could be DEMO as the
basic elements of strategy. The plot and the logic of action view strategy as a direction
or a vision, core competence, DEMO leadership, a differentiation, an activity system etc.
(see e.g. Porter DEMO, 1985, 1996, Mintzberg et al. 1998, Näsi, 1996, Hamel and
Prahalad, 1994). Another basic element, the competitive advantage, is relative to
competitors. As a unique competitive advantage is not sustainable, strategy also tends
9

to vary in time and in different contexts. Competitive advantage (e.g. valuable
position) will trigger imitation by incumbents (Porter, 1996). Strategy in this paper
means the plot or the logic of action DEMO the firm for carrying out long-term goals and
for creating competitive advantage.
The framework of strategy concepts consists of norm, humane and logic concepts.
The logic concept is defined and connected with other theories of cognitive DEMO,
a strategist's work, game mastery, business history and core competence (Näsi 1999).
The logic concepts are recent ideas exposing the core of strategy. These concepts are
called logic concepts because their idea DEMO to expose the rationale of action in a firm
(Näsi 1999)DEMO Thus, cognitive maps, schemas, paradigms, the Dominant Logic or the
Logics of Action are relative concepts, which we can be understood nowadays as
logic concepts of strategy. Strategic management, strategic structures, strategic
leadership, and strategic game are the subfields of strategic thinking, and strategy
logic partly overlaps with the previous four categories, and on the other hand could be
seen as a category of its own. This paper focuses DEMO the field of strategy logic.
Originally, in his book “The Structure DEMO Scientific Revolutions” Thomas Kuhn
defined the paradigm in 1962. In strategic management theory the paradigm is defined
by Johnson (1987) as   “a DEMO of beliefs held relatively commonly throughout the
organization, taken for granted, but discernible in the stories and explanations of the
managers”, and durable and powerful, but tacit assumptions about the business
reinforced by success of the organization. In their article Prahalad and Bettis (1986)
defined the dominant logic “as the way in which managers [in the firm] conceptualize
DEMO business and make critical resource allocations decisions.” Furthermore, they
noted that DEMO was stored via shared schemas, cognitive maps or mindsets and was
DEMO by the managers’ previous experiences. The dominant logic forms a sort
of information filter filtering relevant data to aid strategy development. The filtered
data DEMO then integrated into the strategy, systems, values, expectations, and reinforced
behaviour of the organization (Bettis and Prahalad 1995).
Clearly, the DEMO of dominant logic and paradigm are quite similar concepts.
Both are based more or less on the cognitive psychology - how managers perceive the
DEMO environment and how they respond to environmental changes. In
comparison, Karpik’s (1972, 1978) logic of action looks the same problem from the
DEMO observer viewpoint.   Although Karpik mentioned that behaviour based on
organization’s culture, values and attitudes, his focus was on the whole range of
DEMO actions. Karpik pointed out that when analyzing a firm’s strategies it is
also necessary to study the groups which create them. In addition, the Logic of Action
means first of all that it should compare all DEMO which influence to organization.
Karpik also mentioned that the large organization could have several logics of action.
The logic of action forms a hierarchy, but it is hard to identify. Furthermore, logics of
action are also relative to each other, and only the whole range of behaviour makes it
possible to identify them (Karpik, 1972, 1978).
In the concept of logic of action the units of analysis are both powerful DEMO
and groups. Individuals and groups form the organization’s culture, attitudes and
DEMO Altogether they also specify the organization’s principles of action or in
other words Logics of Action, which can be identified by an outside observer by
analyzing the whole range of behaviour in the organization. The behaviour DEMO a result

of internal political struggles defining the dominant logics of action DEMO the firm. The
competitive coalitions and powerful individuals have their own preferences and the
winning coalition or individual defines the dominant logics of action DEMO the firm
(Karpik 1978, 1981).
The strategy realized could be interpreted as a logical outcome of the strategy
formulation and the dominant DEMO of the firm e.g. logic of action. The concept
of logic of action can also be seen as a normative theory. The company’s structure DEMO
be based on a customer orientation that forms the leading logic of the firm. The whole
set of management practices is built based on DEMO and customers’ needs. One of
the appearances of the logic of action is the Balanced Scorecard, which is balanced
according to customer strategy (DEMO and Talvela 2004)
Stages of growth and strategic management
Dozens of growth models and life cycle definitions have been presented, for example,
by Greiner (1972), Galbright (1982), Tyebjee et al. (1983), Scott and Bruce (1987),
Churchill and Lewis (1983), Kazanjian and Darzin (1990), Yli-Renko and Autio
(1996) and Baird (1999). Five states of growth from a strategic perspective are
described in Figure 2.

Seppä and Näsi (2001) describe a Venture-to-Capital (V2C) model, which is
distinguished from an entrepreneur playing solo, where the entrepreneur DEMO all the
shares, and is pushed by venture capital (VC) DEMO (see also Rasila 2004). In the
context of growth venturing, it is assumed that a venture grows faster when it has
enough DEMO knowledge and resources (to cover the entrepreneurial, managerial
and knowledge gaps) and capital (due to the financial gap) of its own to do so. All in
all, a venture grows even faster if it is also accelerated by V2C models, which
operates between the inception of a venture and the moment when it has reached a
state which DEMO attractive to formal venture capital financing (Rasila 2004). The
V2C DEMO such as co-entrepreneurs - i.e. professional entrepreneurs filling
especially “the knowledge gap” or, as Penrose called it, “the managerial limitations”.
11
Execution Matters
V2C push new ventures in the direction of formal venture DEMO and faster growth
rate. In the pre start-up state the board is normally internal, including only the
founders. In fact, working with the DEMO also means influence over the company
and its strategic decisions.
The new growth model has altogether five stages, namely: i) seed, ii) start-up, iii)
chasm, iv) growth and v) expansion. The DEMO two stages involve the early market and
the two latter extend to the mainstream market. The interim stage is called the chasm
that separates DEMO two markets from each other (see Moore 1995, 1999).
Consequently, the chasm separates growing firms in the early stages from those who
expand beyond. Similarly, the chasm also separates the formation of internal
(DEMO, processes) and external (market) spheres of action of new venture that
succeed and those who do not. The external sphere is initially DEMO open, but the
situation changes after the crossing of the chasm, when the primary goals of a growth
venture are already achieved (to be an investable venture). Externally, the venture is
committed to certain structures like alliances, partnerships, locations, brands, sales
channels, etc. These commitments are connected to risks like a “steep uphill”, which
metaphorically describes the rapidly-rising risks of the venture alongside crossing the
chasm. The corresponding DEMO sphere follows a reverse track. In the beginning
resources are scarce, DEMO ownership is concentrated and structures non-existent. After
the chasm the ownership base is widened and the firm is organized as a mature and
organized DEMO
In the context of growth venturing two major sources of logics of actions can be
identified: the market and the customer. Customers distinguish the growth model as
‘early market’ and ‘mainstream market’ (Moore 1995, 1999)DEMO Strategy making (in
terms of planning, frequency, duration, control, DEMO board of director’s tasks and role
as well as ownership structures) DEMO also done according to these markets. Crossing the
chasm is in the middle of the transformation in these factors from enterprises that are
agile DEMO flexible to effective and profitable enterprises.
Before the chasm strategy making is more or less informal and focuses on the critical
points and the DEMO conditions. Ventures do not initially need a business model or
even a business plan. The venture only needs a viable idea about the new DEMO
Moreover, new ventures seem to need business wisdom and action rather DEMO
analyses and plans. The first phase of the growth (the seed DEMO) could be regarded as
the time before the actual firm is DEMO and the first steps after its establishment.
For new firms, strategy DEMO this stage means, first of all, a strategic world view. Next, at
the start-up stage, the firm has to set boundaries. At DEMO point, the pure ‘world view’
no longer works and a more DEMO strategy is needed. The new venture begins
setting boundaries around the business idea. At the same time the total risk level
increases. The company DEMO to take into account not only technological risks but also
financial risks and risks associated with partnerships and alliances. In strategy terms,
this DEMO can be called ‘strategy as boundaries’. Boundaries can be understood as
“simple rules” as proposed by Eisenhardt and Sull (2001).
The first two states emerge during the “early market”, but the whole game will change
during the third stage after crossing the chasm. According to Moore (1995, 1999),
securing the early majority (size of the customer group is 34% of the potential market
by now) customers is then the key to any substantial profits and rapid growth due to
12
Execution Matters
penetration into the mainstream market. In the early market the DEMO (2.5%) and
early adopters (13.5%) have a tendency to focus on the products’ newness and
discontinuity rather than on essential benefits. Paradoxically, the early majority wants
to buy productivity improvement for existing operations and DEMO to minimize the
discontinuity with the old ways. The early majority wants to see well-established
references before investing substantially. The key point here is DEMO customers in the
mainstream market truly dislike discontinuous innovations (Moore 1995, 1999). Thus,
business operations and strategy are forced to become DEMO structured in order to
offer standardized business processes. This is the state when formulating strategy
takes center stage and it is, therefore, called DEMO as business model” (during the
chasm and growth stages). After DEMO short but rapid growth period, the new venture is
actually no DEMO new or small. More people are involved in strategy making, forcing
DEMO to become more formal, standardizing the communication between people
and units DEMO ensure adequate implementation through well-thought out processes.
Thus, the last state DEMO the new venture development can be called “strategy as
process”. Thus, DEMO the development, strategy formation enhances different styles
of strategic thinking at DEMO stage.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis based on the Bayesian modelling, DEMO is a high-level
representation of a probability distribution over a set of variables. In order to be able
to apply this theoretically elegant approach DEMO practice, the set of possible models has
to be constrained by DEMO basic assumptions on the problem domain. The problem
domains are: (1) internal and external strategy context including periods’
characteristics (states) of development and ownership structure; (2) strategy process
(analysis, decision, implementation DEMO control); (3) strategy content; and (4) firm’s
performance DEMO growth. The Bayesian network model is constructed by explicitly
determining all the direct dependencies between the independent variables of the
problem domain. In a DEMO network each node represents one of the observable
features of the problem domain, and the arcs between the nodes represent the direct
dependencies between the corresponding variables.
Definition of performance in the survey
Growth is by DEMO means a widely accepted success variable. Of course, the business
goals DEMO many small business owner-managers are determined by personal lifestyle or
family factors, not by growth. (Curran 1986, Stanworth & Curran 1986). There are
also many other measures of performance: profit, ROA, ROI, DEMO of customers,
increase of employees, etc. Sales growth has been DEMO most typical measure for young
technology-based companies (Salonen 1995). On DEMO whole, economic measures,
however, really answer other questions. During the first couple of years young
ventures show two or three digit growth DEMO, but this does not actually describe the
real success of the DEMO especially when looking at the success in the strategy setting,
which looks for qualitative development of venture, too. The growth of an
organization can also be considered to be its development and improvement in the
DEMO of its operations (Penrose 1995). Thus, organization growth can be
quantitative and qualitative (Laukkanen 2000).
In the Worldview stage firms are in the pre-start-up phase, where firms do not form an
organization, DEMO are mainly prototypes, business processes are unclear, the
financial situation is not stable and the future in general looks quite open and markets

unlimited. How can we measure the success of such companies? In the study the
success of the firm is not only defined DEMO quantitative measures, because the
performance variables differ by the stage of DEMO cycle. Variables also contain an
evaluation of the firm’s success in finance, publicity, technology, knowledge,
profitability, business processes, and customers and markets.
In the study the success is defined by eleven quantitative and DEMO measures1:
1. Turnover (annual growth rate)
2. Number of DEMO (annual growth rate)
3. Organic growth
4. Non-organic growth
5. DEMO
6. Planned goals
7. Knowledge and technology
8. Publicity
9. Finance
10. Customers and markets
11. Business processes and concepts
The quantitative growth measures DEMO each stage are turnover and number of personnel.
Economic measures are insufficient to describe the success of firms in the early
stages. Growth and DEMO performance measures are listed in Table 1.

DEMO TO THE SURVEY
The questionnaire was sent via Internet and a total of 46 firms completed the full
questionnaire via Internet. The response rate DEMO 14 %. This is quite a satisfactory
result in Finland (Näsi DEMO Aunola 2001). Usually questionnaires are sent via ordinary
mail and response rates are typically between 10% and 20%. Table 2 presents how 46
DEMO were divided into different phases in lifecycle. In the pre-start-up phase
there are only five responses, which is no surprise. It is hard to find companies that
are only one or two years old or those DEMO have just been founded. All in all, there are
17 ventures DEMO an early phase of the life cycle, 20 ventures in the DEMO phase and

nine in the expansion phase. The target group in the DEMO was growth oriented
technology-based firms, which are VC backed, located in technology centre or
already listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Over 650 DEMO were evaluated
and 335 met the selection criteria.

The whole questionnaire DEMO 74 variables divided into three main categories,
strategy content, process DEMO context. Groups of variables are goals, products,
customers, cooperation, DEMO success factors, business development, strategy
process, strategy (topics), control and external and internal context. Each variable is
defined with help of DEMO experience as a management consultant and described in the
growth model. The underlying foundation of the study is the division of strategic
management into DEMO parts according to Pettigrew (1985).
The idea of the study DEMO explain the total model of the data with help of Bayesian
modelling. The study contains a total of 74 variables, which is too many with 46
answers. Therefore the total model is divided into eleven groups DEMO variables. Each
group contains a maximum of 12 variables, growth variables (turnover and personnel)
and success measures. The biggest model contains altogether DEMO variables. Thus, in
each model there are three times more responses DEMO variables. In this analysis one
single variable is not important. The focus is on the groups of variables and the
overall presentation of the DEMO

Strategy content correlates mainly with the stage of the lifecycle. The data does not
reveal any evidence to suggest that there is a DEMO formula” as an initial strategy of
growth venturing. One of the interesting details is that the level of cooperation does
not correlate with lifecycle DEMO with success. There is an approximately equal number
of successful ventures with or without very broad cooperation. It seems that goals,
critical success DEMO and business development change during the life cycle. These
variables do not remain constant between the stages of the lifecycle. The analysis
suggests that DEMO level of management practices correlates with success and also with
the growth model. Ventures which are more systematic and analytical are also more
successful. DEMO addition, those ventures which also have a broader measurement system
(especially financial and customer measures), are more successful.
The external context is DEMO by five variables (markets today, market development
in 2-4 years, DEMO today, technology uncertainty, changes in customer needs in
1-2 years). The most successful companies anticipate the average level of
competition, more technological uncertainty and quite unfavourable market
development in the near future than those DEMO which are not so successful. The
internal context is defined by the stage of the lifecycle and the external context by the
actor’s influence DEMO the development of the venture.
Different external actors influence venture growth at various stages of the growth
model. Business angels, advisors and incubators influence the seed and start-up
phases whereas incubators mainly influence the start-up phase DEMO the venture
capitalists the growth phase. Only those incubators specialized in growth venturing
correlate with success. However, their influence is rated quite low. It could be argued,
however, that those ventures which are already successful involve such actors.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The main research question was: Does the success of new companies depend more on
the execution of the DEMO (process, implementation) than on the intended strategy
(content)? The focus of the study is on logic of actions during growth. The DEMO of
46 high-technology firms in Finland suggests that the success of the firm depends
more on the formulation (strategy process) and execution of DEMO strategy than on
intended strategy (content). Thus, there is no “secret formula” as an initial strategy for
company growth in early phases DEMO lasts throughout the lifecycle; it is matter of
changing logic of DEMO
First of all, the task of entrepreneurship is the creation of DEMO business, organization
or even economy, whereas growth venturing is to run the small business into a big
business. Growth venturing is like project DEMO To commercialize an innovation,
a venture is needed in the process. Young high-technology firms are generally
16
Execution Matters
controlled by active entrepreneurial characters who react quickly to derive DEMO
from new and innovative opportunities. Large firms, quite the opposite, often possess
a management structure that stifles entrepreneurial effort (Rothwell and Zegveld
1982). Of course, it is no idea to adopt management practices directly from big
companies to small entrepreneurial firms. Although there is sort of DEMO in the daily
management of the growth of the new venture, DEMO we can observe the development
of a new venture from the strategic management viewpoint. In the long run, according
to the results of this study, the most successful ventures are those which plan and also
measure their business performance.
If entrepreneurship is concentrated on the creation of a DEMO organization, then
Professional Entrepreneurship deals with growth venturing. Gradually the
entrepreneurial DEMO loses its entrepreneurial characteristics through realized
commitments e.g. size of organization or network, connected alliances, preferred
technological standards, etc. This need not mean that ventures are totally losing their
entrepreneurial spirit; instead they have to change their action code. Figure 3
illustrates the transformation from entrepreneurship to DEMO strategic management of
growth venturing. A question for future research is whether Professional
Entrepreneurship can be understood as a professional management activity and
whether DEMO can also be distinguished from way-of-life type of entrepreneurship?

INTRODUCTION
This study is about understanding the bridging of ventures and capital – the players
and strategies related to pushing DEMO across the capital gap.  In today’s
world, entrepreneurs enjoy quite a unanimous appreciation and recognition as the
geese who lay the golden eggs DEMO societies at large by turning market opportunities
and their personal drive into new exports and jobs. This study investigates who are
“playing with the DEMO,” why, and how.
To be sure, this study is focused on economic actors that in many ways resemble
venture capital companies. The DEMO also utilises the framework of venture capitalist
strategy logic created by Seppä (2000) as the primary theoretical tool. However,
whereas venture capital DEMO concentrate in pushing “investable” ventures “listable”,
this paper studies those who concentrate in pushing “prospective” ventures
“investable” in the eyes of the venture DEMO industry.
In this study, a venture is referred to as:
(i) listable when qualifies for public listing on a stock exchange or as a trade
sale target,
(ii) investable when not yet DEMO but qualifies for investment by the formal
venture capital industry, and
(iii) prospective when not yet investable but qualifies for an organised growth
effort either by an entrepreneurial or a corporate actor.
To conceptually differentiate DEMO venture capital (VC) players, those who push
investable ventures listable, and those players who push prospective ventures
investable, the latter group is referred to as venture-to-capital or V2C players, in this
research.
Besides the V2C players themselves – their person, mission, and strategy – the DEMO
is interested in the demand for their services at both ends of the capital gap. The study
is interested in the views of prospective DEMO on the status of capital supply, and
in the views of DEMO firms on the status of venture supply. Empirically, the study draws
DEMO a survey exercise conducted in Finland, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the UK, during spring 2001. The DEMO
comprised of a venture survey and a capital survey. This paper derives insight only
from the former, however.
The surveys were conducted under the EU commissioned E-forum project, a pilot
project under the eContent Program of the European Commission. E-forum is a
22

project between eight partners: Tampere Technology Centre (DEMO leader) and
Otaniemi Science Park (both from Finland), Heletel/Tessaloniki Technology Park
(Greece), Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor (Luxembourg), Zernike Group
(the Netherlands), Cpin/Centro Promotor de inovacao e DEMO (Portugal),
Info/Regional Development Agency of Murcia, and Njm DEMO/Economic and
Management Consultants (United Kingdom). E-forum seeks for ways DEMO forms to
utilise ICT to improve the matching of ventures and capital.1
The remainder of this paper is divided into four chapters titled: 2. Capital Gap, 3.
Venture Supply, 4. Capital Supply, and 5. Concluding Discussion: The Who, Why,
and How of V2C.
CAPITAL GAP
DEMO capital gap problem was discovered already 70 years ago, documented in DEMO
government study in the UK in 1931 (Dominguez 1974). In DEMO language of this study,
capital gap – the gap between venture and capital (originally referred to as the
Macmillan gap) – relates DEMO the “distance” between a prospective venture and an
investable venture. In effect, the size of the V2C market is the delta between what can
already be funded by the formal capital market and what can still DEMO funded by the
informal capital market. The capital gap is typically the wider – and the V2C market
the bigger – the smaller, the younger, and the more innovative the underlying
prospective ventures are. In the latter part of the past century, the VC industry was
looked at as the solution to the capital gap problem. Consequently, since the 1950s
and the 1960s, governments in America and Europe have taken active measures to
increase the quantity of VC in their underlying economies. (Seppä 2000)
And quantity there is, in today’s world of VC, but DEMO interestingly enough – also an
ever-wider capital gap. Due to the transformation of the classic concept of the VC
process into VC spiral, venture capitalists increasingly suffer from “physical
inability” to make small investments.2 Two years DEMO, the capital gap dilemma was
addressed in Silicon Valley by the DEMO Clara University 1999 summit: Financing
New Ventures – Gaps and Gateways. DEMO was concluded that, in our times,
entrepreneurs seeking for less DEMO $5 million in early-stage funding may be faced
with the capital gap problem.  Less than 15 years ago, the average investment by a
DEMO Venture Capital Association member company was $865,000 (Maier and
Walker DEMO).
The VC spiral, resulting in growth of size of the DEMO VC fund raised by a
successful venture capitalist and a consequent growth of the minimum investment
amount (as depicted by Seppä 2000), is illustrated in graph 1 below.

What adds irony to the capital gap DEMO in our time, is that while an unforeseen
amount of capital DEMO seeking for ventures to finance, also an unforeseen number of
ventures DEMO seeking for capital backing. Thanks to the wheel of history, the
DEMO spreading entrepreneurial ideals, and the knowledge intense, rather than
capital intense opportunities of the e-economy, the market is again ripe for such
classic (small) investments that created many of the VC industry’s greatest legends.3
DEMO irony is that now that there is no shortage of capital, DEMO is a shortage of small-
enough doses of it.
In their landmark book, Venture capital at the crossroads, Bygrave and Timmons
(1992) DEMO with concern: ”Where is the venture in venture capital?”4 Seppä (2000)
rephrases the question and asks: “Where is the capitalist in venture capital?”  The
present study continues the quest for the capitalist in what is referred to as the V2C
setting.  On a grander scale, the study follows the path opened by Tyebjee and Bruno
(DEMO, 1984). For an early Finnish contribution see Miettinen and Relander (1988).
Throughout the 20 years of organised research activity on the DEMO phenomenon, the
least attention has been placed on the identity, motivation, and structure of the ones
who make it happen. This paper joins the likes of Amit, Glosten, and Muller (1990),
Amit, Brander, and Zott (1998), and Seppä (2000) in the DEMO stream of research
addressing the core strategic issues of the venture capital industry. Zacharakis and
Meyer (1998) put the motto of this line DEMO study in words: ”Any improvement in
[venture capitalists’] understanding [of their DEMO decision process] (which ultimately
leads to improved decision-making) can have a huge economic impact for both the
venture capitalist community and their funded DEMO
The mission of this study is to contribute to understanding of the V2C phenomenon at
each key stakeholder group.  Besides the owners and managers of the V2C players, if
not one and same person, also DEMO financiers and target entrepreneurs, as well as the

buyers of their portfolio interests, and government policy makers, make decisions that
shape their business environment. Empirically, this study DEMO the demand for
V2C services at both ends of the capital gap. First, before addressing the mismatch
between the two, venture supply will DEMO addressed.
VENTURE SUPPLY
From the capital provider’s point of view, venture DEMO can be divided into three
main sources as follows:
- entrepreneurial start-ups
- management buy-outs and buy-ins
- corporate venturing
Entrepreneurial start-ups deal DEMO giving birth to new legal persons, a
reproduction process that could DEMO referred to as the lifeline of the market economy.
To an extent, the well-being and survival of also legal persons depends upon
reproduction. But as is the case with natural persons, reproduction is no end in itself.
Without love, care, discipline, and moral building, the odds DEMO well-being and survival
of a child are not increased. At young age, the role of committed parents is central to
natural persons. Institutionalised children are, as sad as it is, less likely to become
contributing DEMO Unfortunately, the analogy seems to hold for legal persons as
well.
DEMO, it could be postulated, are the owners of their children until adults. But sadly,
as we know, this ownership in itself is no guarantee of responsibility and commitment
– which is also pointing to DEMO need for institutionalised parenthood. The same applies
to new venturing. If the ”best element” lacks incentive to become entrepreneurs, in a
society, and DEMO choose a career in a large institution, institutionalised new
venturing is DEMO justified, in analogy. This is not suggesting that
institutionalisation is ever DEMO optimum, however.
MBOs and MBIs relate to entrepreneurial teams’ acquisitions of DEMO and
established businesses. These are typically professional-management-driven
transactions of going concerns and hence less of a challenge to evaluate, finance, and
monitor than DEMO start-ups to a potential capital providers.
Corporate venturing brings about new business by building on internal
entrepreneurship, sometimes referred to as intrapreneurship. In environments and
societies that lack entrepreneurial incentive, large corporations are natural platforms
for new venture activity. Conversely, in environments boasting with entrepreneurial
incentive, corporations DEMO tougher time keeping new venture activity indoors.
Compared with America, Europe DEMO much more on corporate venturing. As a form
of ”institutionalised parenthood,” corporations have a significantly better track record
as a platform for new DEMO activity than state or government related entities –
although there are exceptions also to this rule. Nevertheless, the difference between
the two is likely to be a function of incentives and responsibility.
It is evident that DEMO capital gap problem relates to entrepreneurial start-ups and the
parenting of prospective ventures. By definition, buyouts and buyins are more likely
to be readily investable in the eyes of VC firms. Corporate ventures have internal
25
Playing with the Goose
capital provision. Summa summarum, regarding venture supply, DEMO paper is focus on
entrepreneurial start-ups.5
The Venture Survey
During spring 2001, ventures labelled as ”digital content companies” were surveyed
in eight EU member countries. The definition used for a digital content company was
broad. Companies DEMO “activities of creation or distribution in the domain of
digital content based on education, news and information, leisure and entertainment,
or e-business” DEMO qualify for the survey. They could be anything from a start-up to a
going concern, as long as they judged themselves to be, DEMO the language of this paper,
either a prospective or an investable venture.
By June 15, altogether 61 such firms from Finland, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the UK had responded to the survey. Hence, what
will follow are some early observations on a fairly small, but nonetheless intriguing
sample. Namely, most of DEMO responses are derived from young, entrepreneurial
companies somehow associated with science DEMO or technology centres. Of the
respondent ventures as many as 40% were founded during the past 18 months.
Consequently, 56% of them reported to have five or less employees, and 47% EUR
200.000 or less in annual sales.
In terms of business model, 41% felt comfortable reporting B2B as their dominant
business model, 22% reported B2C, 25% a combination DEMO the two, and only 12%
other model. A striking 45% reported DEMO have identified over ten competitors, 31% 5-
10, and 24% less than five competitors. Regardless of an evidently competitive
environment, 38% of the respondents estimated to outperform their competition in
pace of development. Only 13% DEMO being outperformed by the competition.
The respondents represented early stage also regarding capital raising. As many as
39% have no outside funding and another DEMO have received first stage funding;
while only 24% are at later rounds. Most interestingly, as many as every fifth
respondent reports to decline altogether from raising outside capital.
Reviewing the respondent comments regarding capital provision DEMO following type
comments seemed to emerge as a trend:
- “Real risk capital does not exist, capital providers always ensure their own
investment.”
- “Entrepreneurs invest everything in a venture, capital providers only invest
capital.”
- “Entrepreneurs put it all in one venture; to capital providers it is just a dime in
a dozen.”
When judging for their nature DEMO digital content companies, vis-à-vis technology-
based ones, the respondents the following type comments seemed to emerge as a
trend:
- “Capital providers DEMO to finance technology, rather than e-business
concepts.”
- “The dot.com bomb DEMO cast a shadow over new economy based businesses.”
- “It is truly difficult to assess earning logic herein, and pick winners from a
crowd.”
26
Playing with the Goose
When asked to list their biggest concerns when DEMO their company, only 23% of
the respondents pointed merely at a DEMO of capital, whereas 31% picked only
knowledge related concerns, such as administrative and managerial competence, and
access to specific relationship networks and skilled workforce. The remaining 46%
pointed at a mix of capital and knowledge DEMO concerns. Of the respondent firms,
52% reported the source of their start-up capital as entrepreneurs, associates, family,
and friends, 11% reported friendly money plus public agencies and/or business
angels, 27% friendly money plus venture capitalists and/or banks, and 11% reported
fully corporate sources.
All in all, the respondents agreed that access to specific relationship networks helps
finding capital providers. Only 10% disagreed. They based their judgment on DEMO
following rationale:
- “Networks help getting information on financiers and on how to develop
business idea.”
- “Networks are the way to find DEMO, exchange ideas, and get the right
contacts.”
- “Network membership creates synergy effects and adds credibility.”
A common thread within answers regarding networking DEMO, however, insecurity.
Apparently (young) digital content companies feel uncertain about their networking
ability: Which networks to choose and how to join them.  Of the respondents 33%
indicated they had received help in building their business plan, 27% indicated they
had not received any help, and DEMO that they had not needed any help therein. Of
those who had received help in business planning, 30% reported help from would-be
financiers, DEMO from a public agency, incubator program, grant, or award, and 25%
from a consultant or a private agency.
Although a majority or DEMO of the respondents rated their national state of mind as
favourable towards entrepreneurship, an alarming 43% rated it unfavourable. When
asked whether or not the venture capital sector was well developed in their underlying
economies, only 33% of the respondents gave a positive evaluation. A staggering two
thirds DEMO it a negative evaluation.
CAPITAL SUPPLY
From the point of view of an entrepreneurial venture, capital supply can be divided
into three main sources as follows:
- equity
- debt
- grants
Each source is DEMO to any venture. However, depending upon the development
stage, innovativeness, DEMO technology content of a given venture, there are differences
in their DEMO weight. Debt is primarily available only to more established
companies that have collateral. Grants, on the other hand, are primarily available only
to DEMO most technology-intense firms, and only in economies where governments have
– DEMO the resources – such a technology policy.
27
Playing with the Goose
By content, both debt and grants are financing in its most basic form – money. With
regard to young companies DEMO to firms of high technology content, money is enough,
in DEMO world, only if a venture has lined up exceptional managerial talent DEMO
networks or if they exist to only serve one major client. To most ventures, particularly
so to firms seeking rapid growth into world markets as independent entities, equity
contains the keys to success. This is where the true incentive – the rationale behind all
private enterprising – is DEMO In fact, whereas debt and grants relate to mere
financing, with a price tag, equity rather relates to ownership (being a ”parent”)DEMO This
is why this paper is concentrated on equity supply.
Equity supply
From the point of view of an entrepreneurial venture, the equity supply can be divided
into three main sources as follows:
- entrepreneurs DEMO, their family, and team members (friendly money)
- business DEMO and venture capitalists (private equity players)
- stock market investors (public equity players)
In the ideal environment, the entrepreneur has all incentive – both financial and social
– to invest 100% of his/DEMO capacity to maximally rapid and efficient build-up of the
underlying venture. The importance of the financial incentive is easy to demonstrate;
one just DEMO to refer to the option schemes of large corporations, whereby internal
DEMO is encouraged in market economies world-over. With regard to the
social incentive, large corporations in Europe are vested with much more social
incentive, DEMO efforts to start up on one’s own, when compared with America.
DEMO, self-made-men enjoy by far greater social appreciation in America than
in DEMO ”aristocratic” cultures of Europe, where social status has been traditionally
either DEMO or achieved via loyal service to the crown or a major instution, such as
the church.
Besides the ’relative’ advantage – a better social incentive environment –
entrepreneurs also have an ’absolute’ advantage in America: More friendly-money
available for start-ups. There is typically no need to go outside DEMO and friends for
the first round of financing; no need to DEMO one’s soul to the public at infancy.” In
Europe, entrepreneurs are DEMO to gross the line and seek for private equity
financing at a much earlier stage. And, in the earliest stages, public-sector-based
players are DEMO the only private equity players that are around – in most markets.
Public quotation – access to the public capital market – could be DEMO to symbolise the
New Economy. One needs to have the resources available for quick moves to facilite
growth which often involves M&A transactions. DEMO one needs the same to attract
and keep top management and employees. Publicly traded stock serves both
challenges; it is the vehicle (i) to raise capital from the stock market, (ii) to merge
with or acquire other companies, (iii) to build personnel incentive schemes, DEMO (iv) to
keep the management focused on core competence. In the ”Old Economy,” it was not
unheard of that a venture was DEMO from idea to IPO without private equity money.

In the New Economy, very few companies can build an access to the public capital
market, i.e., reach a public quotation, without private equity finance – at least quickly
enough. Private equity finance provides a ”fast lane” to IPO. DEMO, besides financing,
private equity financiers often bring years or combined DEMO of building
businesses to the equation. However, some of them have DEMO better incentive and
thereby willingness, along with a better ability, to use that experience than others. It is
also worth noting that, carried across time, such an incentive is likely to exponentially
increase both the willingness and the ability to be of contribution.

Also, should a public company fail to meet its full DEMO or should there be any
severe agency problems – this becoming evident from declining share prices (relative
to industry average) – it is DEMO the private equity players that take action. Without
such watchdogs of mature companies, and without such financiers of entrepreneurial
start-ups, economies are likely DEMO severely deteriorate as demonstrated by economic
experiments in Eastern Europe in the latter part of the 20th century. This is why this
paper is DEMO on VC finance or, to be precise, V2C finance.
29
Playing with the Goose
V2C supply
The players that operate between entrepreneurial DEMO and the formal venture
capital industry, in efforts to bridge the DEMO gap, can be categorised as follows
- business angels
- incubators
DEMO advisers
Business angels are, by definition, wealthy individuals putting some of their hard-
earned capital, business-experience, and contact-networks back to the entrepreneurial
DEMO They are profit-driven, market-educated players vested with an extensive
value-adding potential. DEMO, they are, by definition, also hobbyists. This is
neither their DEMO nor full time job. Even if this is their main job, DEMO
retirement, it does not necessarily fill the hours of their days. DEMO, they are not
dependent on any market forces to maintain a DEMO in what they are doing; they
do not need to serve DEMO particular stakeholder group such as outside investors, or
even the entrepreneurs. DEMO do not seek organised growth of their business as do –
for example – the players of the formal venture capital industry. In other DEMO, they
lack certain dynamism.
The same holds for many incubators, but from a different angle. Most incubators are
based on a formal process DEMO professional activity; this is someone’s main job – not
a mere DEMO However, whereas business angels personally participate as owners in
underlying ventures, incubator staff seldom has such personal incentive. Many
incubators are public sector DEMO or semi-public players under the public eye with
little or no space for making mistakes. In other words, their activity lacks different
aspects of dynamism when compared with business angels.
Compared with business angels and incubators, advisers are the most focused on their
own short term gains and DEMO By definition, they are also involved for the
shortest time with DEMO given venture. On the negative side, a standard image of an
DEMO relates to quick-and-dirty, get-the-money-and-run type operation. Advisers are
often faced with DEMO according to which they do not care what happens in the
client firms once they finished. On the more positive tone, advisers are highly skilled
and motivated professionals who have seen many cases and can derive DEMO from
experience. Also, advisers certainly work under market pressure, under pressure of
profitability. This is neither a hobby for them, nor are they around to fulfil (soft)
economic-policy-related missions.
CONCLUDING DISCUSSION: THE WHO, WHY, AND HOW OF V2C
“Every enterprise needs a concept of its industry.  There is a logical
way of doing business in accordance with the facts and
circumstances of an industry, if you can figure it out.  If there are
different concepts among the enterprises involved, these DEMO are
likely to express competitive forces in their most vigorous and most
deciseve forms.”  Alfred Sloan (Robert 1988: 20).
Both the capital gap and the capital heaven are good news to all of the DEMO
mentioned V2C players – business angels, incubators, and advisers. Capital gap
means business for each of them. However, each player type seeks to utilise the
capital gap in a different way, the implications of which have very differing
30
Playing with the Goose
consequences to the other stakeholders of the phenomenon, namely the venturers, the
capitalists, and the society at large. Nonetheless, the width of the capital gap calls for
efforts to create a DEMO professional player. Figure 3 provides an illustration of the
space for V2C to fulfil in the process of accelerating ventures from idea to IPO.

The Venture Survey Re-Visited
In four countries, the Venture Survey asked questions directly related to V2C
services. This section DEMO altogether 21 responses from Finland, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, and Portugal. As many as 62% of those who responded reported they
had considered DEMO “knowledge investment” – not mere capital investment. All of
the Finnish respondents, none of the Luxembourg ones, one third of the Portuguese,
DEMO 40% of the Dutch respondents reported having considered raising “knowledge
investment.”
The list of knowledge investors or “knowledgists” (as opposed to capital investors or
capitalists) included six referrals to fellow-entrepreneurs, four to incubators, two to
advisers, and one to executives of large firms, corporate financiers, researchers,
and R&D teams each. This being an unorthodox concept and DEMO activity to
begin with, it is no wonder many of the DEMO addressed open questions with
comments such as: ”We do not know DEMO to get this kind of support, how to find
those who DEMO it.” The ones who had successfully raised “knowledge investment”
from fellow-entrepreneurs argued that such knowledgists:
(i) “invest brains and experience, the value of which are hard to evaluate in
dollar terms,”
(ii) DEMO means less than knowledge on how to spend it,” and
(DEMO) “the networks opened shape a firm’s future more than mere dollars DEMO the
balance sheet.”
When asked whether or not they would welcome a significant increase in the supply
of V2C services, a compelling 71% of those who responded answered yes. Again, all
of the Finnish respondents answered yes, while a half of the Luxembourg, a third of
the DEMO, and a half of the Dutch answered similarly. When asked whether DEMO
would be willing to search for V2C services via the internet, DEMO respondents were
split into two halves. Ten respondents answered positively and another ten negatively
there being no significant variation between countries. The trend that DEMO
31
Playing with the Goose
emerged through the open-end questions was a preference DEMO personal contact with
regard to attracting knowledgists. While (monetary) capital has no personality,
knowledge comes “attached to such a thing.”
Perhaps the DEMO could be utilised to create a platform and tool for professional
knowledgists to attract part-time knowledgists for syndicated V2C deals and,
eventually, capitalists for VC deals. Rephrasing Fried and Hisrich (1994): ”Finally,
one must ask: ‘How do the benefits that V2C players provide as intermediaries
compare to the costs’.  While we show that the role of an intermediary is valuable, the
[V2C] style of investing has high costs…  DEMO empirical work will be needed to
explore in what situations V2C costs are justified.”

OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY
The history of the venture capital industry is relatively short in Finland and there are
many DEMO of research that need more attention. There are a number of studies about
venture capitalists’ decision criteria concerning their target companies (see, for
DEMO, Seppä 2000), but relatively little attention has been placed on DEMO
investors’ decision criteria concerning the venture capital funds they invest in.
Institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies play an important role in
DEMO capital fundraising in Finland. There are studies based on empirical findings
in other countries dealing with institutional investors’ decision criteria. One of the
objectives DEMO this study is to find out if these studies and theories are valid in Finland
or if there are some specifically Finnish features affecting DEMO One interesting
characteristic of the Finnish venture capital industry is the strong position of the
investment councils composed of representatives of limited partner investors. DEMO
‘Covenants vs. a strong investment council’ deals with this issue to some extent.
The two main questions in this study are, 1) why DEMO (Finnish) institutional investors
invest in VC funds, and 2) how these investors choose between different VC funds.
Principal-agency theory provides the main DEMO framework for the study.
Section ‘Principal-agency theory’ is strongly based on Schleifer (2000). He
introduced different situations where decision making power and resources are
separated by agency relationship.
Contracts between VCs and investors are referred DEMO as Limited Partnership Contracts,
in which context an investor is a limited partner. Nevertheless, the investor has some
powers to restrict the VC’s or the General Partner’s actions. In Finland investment
councils are set up DEMO represent investors in decision making, which is to some extent
contradictory DEMO the original spirit of limited partnership contracts. The strong position
of investment councils is more or less a Finnish phenomenon. In many other countries
DEMO contracts include more covenants, which serve the same purpose as the
DEMO council; to make sure that the investor’s benefit is the first DEMO In the
chapter ‘Covenants vs. a strong investment council’ I will compare those different
practises and I will also share observations on what respondents DEMO about the strong
position of the investment council and whether there have been changes in the
contracting culture in the Finnish venture capital history DEMO to the respondents.
This chapter continues with the principal-agency theory to which an important
theoretical addition is Gompers and Lerner (1996b) which handles DEMO commonness
of the covenants in the venture capital contracts.

Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
In DEMO chapter ‘Why invest in venture capital funds?’, I will focus DEMO on the first
main problem of this study: why the institutional DEMO actually invests in VC
funds? This chapter is highly focused on DEMO concept of risk and expected returns.
Diversification is very important when an investor is dealing with large portfolios.
But portfolio theories are not as DEMO to use when we talk about venture capital
investments. Still in last few years there have been a growing number of studies
covering this DEMO Cochrane (2001) researched this area and emphasized the
individual venture capital investment perspective. Baierl, Chen & Caplan (2002)
studied the same DEMO and tried to investigate the correlation between venture
capital investments and large capitalization stocks. Born (2004) approached this
subject from a different view, studying funds’ risk profiles. Also Manyem (2002) and
Barry (1998) DEMO explored this area. I present these studies and interpret my
observations from the interviews; how well these former studies and their results are
supported when institutional investors make investment decisions. Or more clearly,
does the DEMO diversification-effect matter in investment decisions?
Chapter ‘Criteria for choosing a venture capital fund’ continues with the concept of
principal-agency theory, which was already presented in the earlier chapters. In that
chapter I will concentrate on DEMO second main problem of this study: how an
institutional investor makes DEMO selection between VC funds? Former chapter explained
that investors can not DEMO on the future expected rates of returns when they evaluate
venture capital firms’ capability to invest their funds, because they do not have same
kind of special knowledge as venture capital firms. That is the reason DEMO an agent’s
(a VC’s) past performance is the most important factor when the principal (an
institutional investor) is making his investment decisions. DEMO chapters present
principal agency framework in general and in this chapter I will focus more on that
phenomenon at the fund’s level. Former studies DEMO employ principal-agency
framework in studies handling mutual funds. In many of those studies, former track
record has been indicated to be the most affecting factor in fundraising. For example
Sirri & Tufano (1998) and Goriaev, Nijman & Werker (2003) and Hong, Huang &
Kelsey (2004) have researched that issue. I will introduce those studies in more detail
and I will also present the respondents’ answers and analyse how well DEMO former
studies match with those answers.
BACKGROUND
Venture capital in Finland
Finland’s venture capital history is relatively short and the Finnish venture capital
industry DEMO changed greatly in the past decade. In 1992 venture capitalists raised €14
million of new funds. Ten years later they raised €657 million with DEMO
investors playing a much more significant role than in the early 1990’s.
In 2002 71% of all new funds were raised from institutional investors DEMO pension
funds and insurance companies, amounting to a total of €457 DEMO There have
been several studies on how VCs choose their portfolio companies, but comparatively
little academic research on how institutional investors choose the VC funds they
invest in. Seppä (2000) proposed six archetypes of venture DEMO strategy logic,
which could be evaluated as indicative of the motivations of the venture capitalists,
but not of their investors, at least not directly.
35
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
As DEMO mentioned earlier, the main problem of this study is two-fold: why do
institutional investors invest in venture capital funds in the first place, and what
criteria do they use to choose between different funds?
DEMO funds and insurance companies invest their funds in many asset classes with
solvency requirements restricting their actions. They have a strong emphasis on
capital DEMO on their portfolio as a whole. Yet at the same time, DEMO are under
pressure to generate higher returns. How do these portfolio managers make their
investment decisions?
It is understandable that an institutional investor DEMO invests in assets with
comparatively low risk. A minority of total funds can be invested in instruments with
high expected-rate-of-return and high risk, among them VC funds. These legal
restraints, which I will not go into in detail, are described to some extent in Finland’s
Ministry of Finances' study ’Pääomarahoituksen tarjonnan lisääminen Suomessa’
[Increasing supply for venture capital financing in Finland] (Niemi 2003, 37-39). It is
however important to note DEMO since institutional investors have such a significant
role in the Finnish venture capital industry, so does the solvency requirements that
affect these institutional investors.
The Finnish fund structure
Before we can concentrate in detail on how DEMO institutional investor’s operate,
we will take a look at the basic structure of a venture capital fund in Finland. VC
funds are quite DEMO in many countries, though there are still some
differences in the DEMO process and decision-making power. Figure 1
shows the typical structure of a Finnish venture capital fund.

Usually a venture capital fund is structured as a limited partnership. These
partnerships have usually finite lifetimes. The institutional investor DEMO the
capital and takes part in the decision making process through the investment council.
The core of the structure is the VC fund, which is organised as a limited lifetime
36
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
limited DEMO The management company is the general partner and the
institutional investors are limited partners.
Usually the general partner has full decision-making power in a DEMO partnership,
but as we can see, in the Finnish VC DEMO structure the limited partners have also
some decision-making power through the investment council. In many cases the
venture capitalists have to introduce their investment DEMO (concerning target
companies) to the investment council, which has veto DEMO on them. In Finland the
investment council has traditionally had a comparatively influential position. One
purpose of this study is to find out institutional DEMO attitudes towards the role of
the investment council. This will be discussed further in later chapters.
Methods
The study is based on a theoretical DEMO and empirical research. The empirical
work consists of nine interviews with Finnish institutional investors. One interview
was made via telephone and the others were DEMO face-to-face interviews of 30-45
minutes. All relevant institutional types are represented in the sample. Three
interviews, out of 12 planned, were cancelled. Interviews DEMO of open space
questions, as well as qualitative and quantitative questions.
DEMO INVESTORS’ VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTING
The principal-agency theory
Before taking a closer look at the Finnish venture capital scene, I will consider
theoretically how investors can monitor their investments in a VC fund. VCs are not
investing DEMO own money, they are investing the institutional investors money
(where the managers in turn are not investing their personal funds but in many DEMO
taxpayers money). One approach to analysing the management of ‘other people’s
money’ is the principal-agency theory. This framework is widely used in different
DEMO The basic idea of the principal-agency theory is to analyse a situation where
the ‘brains’ and the resources are separated by an agency relationship. DEMO can we
then be sure that both parties have converging objectives?
Andrei Shleifer (2000) has used the principal-agency-framework to clarify how
different DEMO make their decisions when investing. Sleifer based his writings on
Ippolito (DEMO), which gives the empirical facts for his study. Shleifer’s methods and
theories are used mainly to analyse mutual funds but we can apply DEMO model to
venture capital funds as well. In his book: “Inefficient DEMO: An introduction to
behavioural finance”, Shleifer separates two different situations. First he considers a
situation where arbitrageurs use their own wealth to trade DEMO they are limited only by
their own risk aversion. In the second case arbitrageurs invest other investors’ funds.
We therefore have principal (investors) DEMO agents (arbitrageurs). This is also the case
in venture capital DEMO where the venture capitalist plays the arbitrageurs role.
In Shleifer´s model, DEMO invest investors’ funds using highly specialized
knowledge, but how can institutional DEMO be sure that their capital is invested
wisely, if they don’t DEMO the same knowledge the venture capitalist has? When
arbitrageurs are investing DEMO own money they are (supposed to be) interested only
in their investment’s expected rate of return. The institutional investor cannot
however make his DEMO based on the expected rate of return (ERR) because by
definition, he does not possess the information required to make an educated estimate
37
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
of DEMO ERR. For the institutional investor, the only way to estimate a DEMO
capitalist’s performance is to look at the VC’s past performance, not DEMO expected rate
of return.
Shleifer refers to the phenomenon of responsiveness of funds under management to
past returns as performance based arbitrage (PBA). The essential difference between
the investor who invests his own money and DEMO investor who gives his money to a
fund manager to invest is the direction they look at. The investor who invests his own
money DEMO interested in the expected rate of return, i.e. the future. When DEMO investor
uses professional fund managers they must look at the agents' DEMO investment track
record, i.e. the past. (Shleifer, 2000, 89-96)
Shleifer’s interpretation of the principal-agency-theory gives us guidance on how we
can DEMO this framework when we are examining VC funds. My presumption is that
when arbitrageurs invest ‘other peoples’ money’ they will be largely evaluated
according DEMO past performance. Since VC funds are limited life funds, VCs will DEMO
cyclically looking for capital for a new VC fund. When a venture capitalist begins
raising a new fund, his former track record is the best proof of his capability to
produce more prosperity for his investors.
DEMO vs. a strong investment council
No two actors can have fully converging goals. As long as there is scarcity there will
be always some DEMO of interest in human action. The question is, is this conflict DEMO
interest any significance? When it comes to venture capital investing, it is. The
institutional investors will always want to monitor and restrict the DEMO actions in
some way.
The Finnish fund structure with the influential investment council was already
presented in the former chapter. If there is a DEMO need for monitoring and restrictions,
why is the Finnish model of a strong investment council not more common? Are
Finnish investors just more suspicious than foreign institutional investor because they
want to have someone to DEMO after their interest and have veto power in the
investment council? DEMO do they possess some knowledge which foreign institutional
investors don’t? Naturally DEMO institutional investors want to monitor their investments
too. This has traditionally been done with covenants.
In the US, venture capital firms are highly restricted by contract agreements. Gompers
and Lerner (1996) have analysed the use DEMO covenants in venture capital agreements.
They examined 140 partnership agreements establishing venture capital funds in
1978-1992 and noticed that these contracts are quite heterogeneous DEMO their inclusion
of covenants. They formed 14 different covenant classes, which DEMO divided into
three different covenant sets. The first set included covenants relating to overall fund
management, the second set included covenants relating to activities of the general
partner and the third set included covenants restricting investment DEMO Gompers and
Lerner found out that fewer restriction were found in funds established during years
with greater inflows of new capital, funds in which limited partners do not employ
investment managers and funds where general partners DEMO higher levels of
compensation. (Gompers & Lerner. 1996b, 463-493).
38
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
In DEMO covenants have not played an equally significant role as in many other
countries. The investment council with the institutional investor’s representatives
have a comparatively DEMO role in the management of a fund even after the investment
into the VC fund is made. There are signs that this is changing DEMO
According to my interviews, in the mid 90’s when many institutional DEMO started
to invest in VC funds, partnership contract agreements were much DEMO than
nowadays. As one of the respondents said:
“Generally speaking the contracts are getting thicker. You could
say that everything is specified and DEMO much more specifically
and in detail … the Anglo-American way of doing business is
spreading.”1
Gompers and Lerner also found that covenants, which were related to the
management of the fund or investment type had increased DEMO time. At the same time
covenants restricting the activities of the general partner had decreased. When the
venture capital limited partnerships were a relatively DEMO phenomenon, investor
hadn’t very much knowledge about the venture capital industry. DEMO easiest way to
control the action of the general partner was to make restrictions on how they can
make investments. As investors learned about DEMO capital, they also learned which
agency costs were most probable and DEMO actions should be most restricted.
(Gompers & Lerner. 1996b, 484).
Because of the traditionally strong role of the investment council in the DEMO VC
fund structure, this issue was addressed to some extent in DEMO most of the interviews
with open questions.
When asked how they view the council’s strong position, the majority of the
respondents thought it to be (at least a little bit) too strong. As one of DEMO respondents
said:
“Why on earth would we want to have the decision making power,
after we have chosen a management company?”2
DEMO, the views were mixed. One of the respondents thought that the DEMO of the
investment council could be even stronger. The majority did not see any urgent need
for bigger changes (5 out of 7 respondents). Only two of the respondents stated very
clearly that they thought DEMO role of the investment council to be too strong. Two
others expressed more cautious views in this direction. So, 4 out of 7 saw the role of
the investment council as too strong or slightly too DEMO Two respondents saw the
current Finnish model as more or less good without a need for any major changes.
One respondent said he was DEMO to lean more and more towards favouring a less
influential investment council.
Still, at least 3 respondents out of 7 were clearly reluctant to give up their veto power.
In addition the investment council was seen DEMO a good source of information.
39
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
Why DEMO in venture capital funds?
Finnish institutional investors put only a small fraction of their total portfolio in VC
funds. What are the institutional DEMO incentives to invest in VC funds in the first
place? We DEMO approach this question by looking at a single venture capital
investment from a risk and return perspective or we can look at the big DEMO,
namely how a venture capital investment affects the investors’ portfolio as a whole.
In the last few years there has been a growing DEMO of studies concerning risk and
return in venture capital investments. The risks and returns of private equity differ
from the risks and returns of DEMO traded stocks. For this reason, we cannot use
traditional finance theory DEMO such. Poor diversification can be one reason that makes
standard asset pricing theory unsuitable. Differences between private equities’ and
publicly traded stocks' liquidity, DEMO and monitoring issues are other reasons.
Poor liquidity is typical for private equity investments and thus investors may require
higher average returns to compensate DEMO risks. When investing in publicly traded
stocks, investors invest only money. DEMO, when dealing with private equity, a
VC often invests their time and ‘management capacity’, that is, more than just money.
VCs have DEMO seat on the board of directors and may have the right to appoint or fire the
management. (Cochrane 2001, 2, 33-34)
In his research, Cochrane used the VentureOne database which includes nearly 17000
financing rounds in nearly 8000 venture capital projects. He points out that we DEMO
only measure a return when a firm goes public, is acquired, or gets a new financing
round. This will cause selection bias because DEMO events are more likely to happen
when the firm has achieved a good return. By using such a sample, results will be too
optimistic. He points out that if we want to have proper answers we DEMO to correct
this selection bias. Cochrane uses log returns which improves the quality of the
results. Cochrane found that single venture capital projects are DEMO particularly
attractive from a profit/loss point of view, but adding DEMO single venture capital
investment to a stock portfolio provides some diversification benefits. (Cochrane
2001, 1-6)
Cochrane’s results reveal very well the basic DEMO of the venture capital industry.
When analyzing his results, he noticed DEMO most of the returns are modest but there
are some exceptionally good returns. This also reveals how risky an individual
venture capital investment can DEMO
Cochraine compared venture capital investments to the S&P500 index. Standard
deviation of the venture capital investment was much larger than the standard
deviation DEMO the S&P500, but when venture capital investment was compared to
DEMO large publicly traded stocks, the difference was much smaller. According to
DEMO, after correcting the estimation bias an individual venture capital
investment is DEMO necessarily so different from publicly traded securities as we usually
think. Cochrane emphasizes also the portfolio view in his study. He observed that
individual DEMO capital investments are not particularly attractive because of the
high volatility of the venture capital investment. His second observation was that
adding a single DEMO capital investment to a portfolio doesn’t increase performance
of the portfolio dramatically, but putting some weight to venture capital investment
could still increase the performance. When investors put substantial weight to venture
capital investment, portfolio volatility rises dramatically. (Cochrane 2001,10-34).
40
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
Barry (1998) observes that venture capital investments correlate strongly with small
cap stocks, but they have low correlation with larger cap stocks and bonds. These
observations are interesting but his sample was calculated from appraisal data which
DEMO not necessarily valid as it includes cases which haven’t been exited; DEMO cases
which have been exited can be valuated correctly.  (Baierl, DEMO & Caplan 2002, 1-9).
Baierl et. al.(2002) have investigated correlations between venture capital investments
and large capitalization stocks. They included only DEMO funds in their sample
when they calculated average returns, standard deviations DEMO correlations. Thus they
made sure that their data was correctly collected. Their sample included 148 funds,
which were liquidated during 1960-1999. One observation DEMO that correlation
between venture capital investment and large-cap stocks was very low. These results
imply that venture capital investment might have actually a total DEMO reducing impact
on an investor’s portfolio.
In my interviews almost every respondent emphasized that VC fund investments are a
good tool for diversifying their DEMO According to one respondent:
”We want to diversify our portfolio, DEMO that we have different kinds
of investments which act differently in different markets. When we
compare private equity profits, hedge fund profits, they DEMO
have as little correlation with publicly traded stocks, bonds and the
DEMO estate market as possible.”3
But we have to remember that venture capital investments represent only a small
fraction of an institutional investors total portfolio, usually in the ballpark of 1-2%
rather than several percentages. Two respondents DEMO clearly that they thought the
diversification effect to be negligible. One said:
”On the venture capital side the share [of the portfolio] is DEMO small.
We are only looking for profit. So, this doesn’t work DEMO a
diversification instrument or diversification for correlation… here
the main goal is profit“4
Baierl’s et. al. (2002) study reinforces this view. In their DEMO, they found that if the
aim was to create a minimum-variance DEMO, the allocation to venture capital
should be about 2%. If the DEMO was a portfolio with the same standard deviation as the
S&P 500 index, the allocation should be 4%. For the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio,
the allocation of venture capital should be 9%. (Baierl et al 2002, 6).  Their material
consists of VC’s investments and DEMO equity. Institutional investor’s portfolio
includes more asset classes than these. Thus their findings are not applicable as such
to in this study. It rises DEMO the important question: does venture capital
investment truly diversify portfolio risk DEMO institutional investors? When we add that
Finnish venture capital has shifted DEMO towards buyout investing in the past
two years (FVCA Yearbook 2004, p.33) it is truly prudent to ask has venture capital
investing any real or significant diversification effect on the institutional investors
portfolio? This is backed up by Mayhem (2002) who refers to a 2001 Gompers DEMO
Lerner study pointing out that a 15% share of private equity in a portfolio has a clear
diversification effect. The average return increases but DEMO standard deviation
41
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
increases DEMO little. (Manyem 2002, 4). But we have to be more cautious about a
possible diversification effect when talking about significantly smaller shares, as in
this study.
The studies mentioned above emphasized the risk profile DEMO individual venture capital
investments and diversification of the portfolios with venture capital investments.
Born (2004) has taken another perspective on diversification. He used DEMO dataset of 282
European and 745 US VC funds when attempting to analyse the risk-profile of
venture capital funds-of-funds. He found out that an DEMO in a fund-of-funds
can significantly decrease risk. Funds-of-funds’ (which have invested DEMO 20 different
funds) probability to show negative results was almost zero DEMO in Europe and the
US. The probability to gain a less than 5% profit was much bigger in Europe than in
the U.S. He DEMO observed that the number of funds in the portfolio and the period of
time during which funds are entered matters. A portfolio size of DEMO funds already
reduces the major part of diversifiable risk. (Born 2004, 1-2)
Diversification was not the only aspect emphasized in my interviews. DEMO
also emphasized the high expected-rate-of-returns as one incentive to invest in
venture capital funds. Even if the benefits of venture capital investment in portfolio
DEMO are not totally clear, it can be claimed that there is DEMO the
possibility for returns.
But how can the likelihood of high returns be evaluated? In my interviews the
importance of the VCs former fund’s track came up as expected, based on former
studies. (Even if DEMO former funds have not been liquidated yet many exits have been
made. Therefore the final results can be comparatively accurately estimated.) It is
however good to remember that the funds that are nearing the end of DEMO 10 year life
in Finland were founded in the early and mid 90’s. The last half of the 90’s with its
stock market bubble DEMO hardly be used as an estimate for fund performance for the
next 10 years.
Another factor that came up in the interviews was IRR. DEMO report the funds IRR to
the investors. IRR can be a useful tool when estimating the current value of venture
capital investments, but there are also some issues that we have take into
consideration. The Finnish DEMO markets have been very challenging on the IPO-front
over the past few years. As mentioned before, there has been a strong shift towards
buyout investing. With limited exit opportunities even the most profitable investment
will be DEMO for a VC.
In conclusion, neither diversification as conducted in Finland, nor the possibility for
high returns can give an unambiguous answer to DEMO first main question of this study:
why it is useful to invest in VC funds. Former studies gave us some guidelines about
those DEMO, which can be achieved by adding venture capital investments to the
DEMO investment portfolio. These same elements were also found with interviews.
We can presume that venture capital investments can give some diversification
benefits, but a much greater problem is to solve how large should be the venture
DEMO investments weight in the optimally diversified portfolio. Another problem is
the valuation of the venture capital investments. As mentioned earlier it is not easy DEMO
evaluate the right value of the investment before exit. If we use past performance,
there are some factors that we should notice. First DEMO all we have to understand the
42
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
short DEMO of the finish venture capital markets. There have been some
extraordinary good historical profits, which could give us too optimistic picture of
possibilities for future gain. But many of the respondents mentioned late 90’s profits
and DEMO seem to be very well aware of the future profit possibilities.
Criteria for choosing a venture capital fund
So far we have discussed the DEMO characteristics of a typical Finnish VC fund, the
traditionally significant role DEMO the investment council in Finland, the applicability of
the principal-agency-theory on DEMO capital investing and reasons for investors to
invest in VC funds. In this chapter we will concentrate on this study’s last main
question, which is fund selection, and compare earlier studies with the findings in my
interviews.
In chapter ‘The principal-agency theory’ I mentioned that former studies have
DEMO past performance to be an important factor affecting future fund raising.
This performance based arbitrage (PBA) means that investors may rationally allocate
money DEMO on past returns of arbitrageurs and withdraw funds after poor past
performance. (Sleifer 2000, 88-89)
Fund performance correlation to fund flows has DEMO documented extensively
concerning mutual funds. Much of this applies to VC funds as well. Earlier studies
indicate that past performance is an important determinant DEMO new capital commitment
to mutual funds when comparing funds that have the same investment focus. The
relationship between past performance and new commitments has DEMO been linear. If
returns are high, funds gain more money but DEMO returns are very low, losses of assets
and fees are more DEMO (Sirri & Tufano, 1998).
There have been several other studies addressing the relationship between past
performance and fund flows in mutual funds.  Goriaev, Nijman & Werker (2003)
observed that the impact of DEMO performance doesn’t affect fund flows immediately
but there is a certain lag. Engström & Westerberg (2004) noted that past performance
isn’t necessarily the DEMO important factor in future fundraising, observing that a more
important factor DEMO information costs. Thus, foreign funds with similar track records as
domestic DEMO don’t attract as much investment. In VC funds this is handled with
funds-of-funds. My interviews showed that many respondents have some investments
in funds-of-funds.
DEMO also indicated that the most important reason why an institutional investor
invests in funds-of-funds is not necessarily diversification benefits, as presumed
earlier. Instead the most important reason was that with funds-of-funds investors can
reach geographical areas DEMO industrial branches which would otherwise be hard to
reach (e.g. American DEMO capital markets). These findings differ from Born (2003)
who DEMO that funds-of-funds enable investors to gain access to a variety of VC
funds in a diversified portfolio. On the basis of interviews funds-of-funds
diversification DEMO as important as I thought. Some of the respondents emphasized
that the total amount of the venture capital investments in their total portfolio is DEMO
small that they don’t believe that they can achieve any better diversified portfolio with
funds-of funds, because the share of the funds-of-funds is quite small even compared
to the total amount of their venture capital investments. DEMO to former studies
presented in the previous chapter, this is easy DEMO accept. Actually we can also make a
43
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
question DEMO the total amount of the venture capital investments, which institutional
investor DEMO in his portfolio, large enough such that we can speak of DEMO
benefits at all?
Kaplan & Schroar (2003) found that capital flows into private equity funds are
positively and significantly related to past DEMO They also found that highly
performing funds don’t grow as rapidly as average performing funds. In this respect
VC funds differ substantially from mutual DEMO One reason might be that there is
always a limited number of good deals in the economy at any point in time. (Kaplan
& Schroar 2003, 21-23)
In 1996, Gompers formed his grandstanding hypothesis DEMO the importance of
track record for future fundraising. He found out that younger venture capital firms
have a disposition to exit their first investments DEMO earlier than older venture
capital firms. The reason being that younger venture capital firms need to build up
their track record for the next DEMO they are raising a fund. Thus, they might act more
hastily DEMO well-established firms. (Gompers 1996a, 134)
In my interviews, the DEMO were asked to rank different factors affecting their
decision to invest in venture capital funds. First they were asked to rank how
important the DEMO, the fund (the track record of the VCs former funds, DEMO
distribution clauses, the role of the investment council) and the funds target market
were, considered when choosing a fund. Not surprisingly the role of the management
was seen as the most significant. Four respondents ranked DEMO as the most important
factor and four ranked it as number two. Only one respondent considered the features
of the fund and markets more DEMO than management.

DEMO questions were asked about each factor. One intention was to find out
about the role of past performance when track record was separated from

DEMO management, track record was the most important criteria six times out DEMO nine,

When DEMO about the funds characteristics, seven times out of nine the funds DEMO
track record was the most important factor. Track record seemed to be much more
important than profit distribution clauses. The role of the investment DEMO was
considered to be the least important.

Because of the small sample available in Finland, we have to be careful how we
interpret these answers. We can’t have any statistically significant answers but this
survey can still DEMO us to build a better understanding of the Finnish venture capital
market. Former studies, not focusing on the Finnish market, suggest that past
DEMO is the most important factor when investors are making investment
decisions. My interviews seem to confirm that, both when looking at the
management’s past performance or former funds' performance. Open questions give
similar answers. In many of the interviews the importance of the past performance
was mentioned and DEMO the importance of the management’s track record. It
seems that track record of fund management is more important than track record of
the fund.
DEMO open questions also revealed that ownership and the general structure of the VC
fund matters. When asked to choose between three VC fund types: partner driven (or
entrepreneurial), institutional (or corporate) and governmental, DEMO respondents picked
the partner driven fund as the most attractive. The argumentation was in line with the
principal-agency-theory, which indicates that, when entrepreneurial, venture capital
firms are most likely to be interested in increasing the DEMO of their investors’
investments. The respondents saw greater likelihood for hidden agendas in the two
latter structures, hence also supporting the archetypes of strategy logic by Seppä
(2000)
CONCLUSIONS
The two main problems posed in this study were: 1) why do institutional investors
invest in venture DEMO funds and 2) how do institutional investors choose between
45
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
different DEMO funds? A methodological concern for this study was the small number DEMO
institutional investors which invest in venture capital funds in Finland. That is the
reason why the sample of this study could not be very DEMO
The first main question of this study focused on the concept of the diversification of
the portfolio and the risk profile of the venture DEMO investments. Traditional
portfolio theories cannot give perfect answers as to how venture capital investments
should be weighted in large portfolios. Can they decrease the DEMO risk of the portfolio
and how large should the weight of the venture capital investments be in the
portfolio? In the case of the institutional investor we have to also remember that there
are legal restrictions DEMO to how much investors can invest in venture capital markets.
Most of the respondents emphasized the diversification effect that they can achieve
through venture DEMO investments. But only a couple of them noted that the share of
venture capital investments in their portfolio is so small that it does DEMO necessarily
help the diversification. But still the basic idea of diversification of the portfolio was
mentioned almost in every answer, which is in line with former studies. Also the
possibility to achieve high returns was a DEMO important factor even if the benefits of
a diversification effect were unclear.
The second main question is theoretically based on principal-agent theory. A
presumption DEMO that because institutional investors play a limited partner’s role, the
only DEMO to estimate a VC’s capability is the VC’s former track record. This is a
commonly known fact: when brains and resources are separated by an agency
relationship, the only way to appraise an agents’ action is their past performance.
According to my interviews this is true also in DEMO Finnish venture capital market.
Because of the small sample it is not possible to make any quantitative analysis or
generalisations but we can still DEMO some observations. When venture capital firm’s
track record and management’s track record were separated, respondents had to rate
the most important factors affecting the selection between funds. Former track record
seems to be the most important DEMO according respondents in both cases. Also, open
questions supported these observations.
DEMO interesting addition to this study is the role of the investment council. In Finland,
the investment council has some decision making power whereas DEMO many other
countries this kind of body does not exist. Former studies revealed that in many
venture capital markets (at least in the U.S.), covenants play a great role in contracts
between investors and the DEMO capital firm. So there is no need to have an
investment council; investors can restrict the venture capital firm’s action with
detailed contracts. But why do we have this kind of body in Finland? My presumption
at the beginning was that respondents would support the council’s existence because DEMO
should supervise that investment decisions are made wisely. The responses I received
did not support this presumption completely. Some of the respondents were quite
DEMO about the position of the investment council. They thought that such a
council could not have better knowledge over the investee candidates than venture
DEMO firms, so how could they evaluate investment decisions more wisely than DEMO
venture capital firms? If a venture capital firm investigates potential investment DEMO
for months, how could an investment council have a better knowledge? Some of the
respondents however emphasized the role of the council as DEMO monitoring and reporting
body. They thought that with such an body, DEMO are better aware of how their
funds are invested. Also the contracting practises have changed during the last ten
46
Institutional Investor’s Decision Making Criteria for Investing in Venture Capital
Funds
years. DEMO the early years, contracts were quite thin and did not restrict DEMO action
very powerfully. Nowadays, contracts are written with much more detail DEMO decrease
the necessity of a strong investment council. These observations are well in line with
former studies which handle covenants in venture capital contracts: Contracts are
getting more detailed.
All in all, this work gives some answers to the research phenomenon addressed but
also raises new questions that DEMO be interesting to study in the future. For
example: what is DEMO suitable weight of venture capital investment in an optimally
diversified portfolio? DEMO institutional investors have fewer restrictions on how
they can invest their funds, if they wish to realize that optimally diversified portfolio?
What should be the position of the investment council in the future or is DEMO actually
any need for that kind of a body – at least when maximal rates of return are targeted
by venture capital firms based DEMO entrepreneurial incentives?

INTRODUCTION
Venture capital finance is crucial to innovative DEMO venturing. Banks generally do
not fund high-risk businesses that require heavy up-front investment. Unfortunately
many growth ventures find it difficult to get funding for DEMO early stages. This
phenomenon has been termed ‘capital gap’ (Harrison & DEMO 1992, Kelly 1996,
Lumme, Mason & Suomi 1998).
The capital gap is not an inevitable phenomenon like the law of gravity, given that
many successful growth ventures do find funding. However, such early funding
comes largely from so-called ‘business angels’ (BAs) rather than institutional DEMO
capitalists (VCs). These two players have adopted complementary roles in DEMO of
both size and stage of investment: BAs look after the DEMO steps and VCs invest bigger
amounts in later stages (Freear & DEMO 1990). This difference between BAs and
VCs has been almost entirely ignored in theoretical venture capital literature. Van
Osnabrugge (2000) is so DEMO possibly the only paper that analyses the different
investment strategies and preferences of BAs and VCs. The present paper builds on
his findings.
The DEMO author argues that VCs avoid small and early ventures because of the
institutional nature of VC funds. VCs invest others people’s money, which translates
into potential moral hazard and adverse selection problems for their outside investors.
DEMO studies demonstrate that VCs prefer investment strategies that enhance their
relationship with external investors. BAs invest their own money and have
consequently adopted more DEMO investment strategies, which are better
suited for early-stage ventures.
Section 2 DEMO at the growth venturing process and the different roles played by VCs
and BAs. Section 3 discusses different ways in which asymmetric information affects
DEMO venture finance. Section 4 analyses the operation of venture capital funds in
light of asymmetric information for external investors. Section 5 discusses possible
consequences DEMO the VC fund structure, and section 6 compares the actual investment
DEMO of VCs and BAs. Section 7 concludes with practical implications of the
findings.
GROWTH VENTURING AND THE ‘CAPITAL GAP’
VCs and BAs in the DEMO venturing process
Growth venturing is entrepreneurship that is generally based on some specific
innovation (e.g. a technological discovery, a novel service concept or DEMO logistical
49
Bridging the Capital Gap
innovation). For investors growth ventures are both DEMO exciting and awfully
challenging. This is due to two factors: the DEMO and uncertainty involved with high
technology, and the information asymmetries that DEMO with expert labour and
intangible assets which have little liquidation value. As a result, banks tend to play
very a very limited role in growth venture finance.
The financing of growth ventures usually goes through distinct DEMO of development
(see Figure 1). The present paper will use DEMO stages’ to refer to both seed and start-
up ventures. In these stages the concept is being tested and a prototypemay be
developed. ‘Later DEMO refer to those firms that are in the growth andestablished
stages, DEMO which the venture is expanding and producing, yet it is probablystill
DEMO
Figure 1 The development and financing of growth ventures (Van Osnabrugge & Robinson 2002)
This picture of the growth venturing process suggests the venture capitalists and
business angels are not direct competitors but play complementary DEMO
Unfortunately, detailed comparative quantitative studies on the growth venturing
process are DEMO and far between. The best study found in the course of the present
study is by Freear & Wetzel (1990), who studied the financial histories of 284 high
technology firms founded in New England between DEMO and 1986. The great
methodological advantage of this study is that the data has been gathered by asking
the ventures where they got their DEMO from – not from different investors where
they put their money. This way the data can be used directly to compare the roles of
DEMO investors in the different stages of venture growth.
The authors found, DEMO, that business angels were the most common source of
finance in DEMO of the total number of ventures financed. However, in terms of DEMO
amounts, venture capital funds provided five times as much as business DEMO In
other words, business angels financed more firms, but venture capitalists supplied
more money. (See Table 1 for details.)
50
Bridging the Capital Gap
Secondly, in the seed-stage BAs were practically the only source of capital, and they
dominated the start-up stage too. In later stages and bigger financing needs, VCs
dominated the market. Moreover, DEMO tended to invest much small amounts per
round than VCs did. Freear & Wetzel concluded that BAs and VCs play
complementary rather than competing DEMO in growth venture finance, both in terms
of size and stage DEMO their investments.
Table 1 Comparative data on growth venture financing in New England 1975-1986 (Adapted
from Freear & Wetzel 1990)
Business angels Venture capitalists
Total number of firms financed 124 firms 90 firms
Total amount DEMO $76 million $ 370 million
Dominant investment range up to $500,000 $500,000 upwards
Median investment (per round) under $500,000 $1-3 DEMO
Although there is no such comparative data available from Finland, Finnish DEMO is
consistent with the above picture. According to FVCA (2003), DEMO invested 10-20%
of their total amounts in seed and start-up ventures in 1996-2002. They preferred
expansion-stage ventures and MBO/MBI investments. In contrast, Lumme, Mason &
Suomi (1998) found that business angels made three-quarters DEMO their investments in
early stages. Most of these investments were less than FIM 800,000 in size, compared
to an average VC investment of FIM 3.5 million in 1996.
The ’capital gap’
In the US, the amount of business angel investments is very significant in comparison
to institutional DEMO capital investments, both in terms of the amount of money
invested DEMO the number of businesses supported (e.g. Freear & Wetzel 1990). DEMO
Europe, there are fewer business angels, mainly because of a more corporate economy
and of higher personal income tax rates, which hinder capital accumulation (Harrison
& Mason 1992, Landström 1993).
Several authors argue DEMO there tends to be a ‘capital gap’ in the seed and start-up
stages of the growth venturing process (Harrison & Mason 1992, Kelly DEMO, Lumme,
Mason & Suomi 1998). Freear, Sohl & Wetzel (1996) find that, even in the US, the
venture capital DEMO lies with seed and start-up capital in the $250,000 to $1 million
range. Amounts smaller than $250,000 can be gathered from other DEMO, and
amounts larger than $1 million will be provided by venture DEMO funds, but the
middle range is left under-funded unless it is DEMO by BAs. Harrison & Mason (1992)
identify a similar range DEMO the UK.
Some recent authors have suggested that seed and start-up ventures also face a
‘knowledge gap’ (Rasila 2004). This is closely related to the capital gap: the
knowledge gap means that entrepreneurs often lack the skills necessary for converting
an emerging business idea to a successful DEMO Institutional venture capitalists
(and traditional lenders such as banks) tend to have a capital-intensive investment
strategy, and they do not provide sufficient hands-on advice needed by many start-up
entrepreneurs. (See Figure 2.)

GROWTH VENTURE FINANCE AND INFORMATIONAL
ASYMMETRIES
One fruitful way of analysing growth venture finance is to focus DEMO the consequences
of imperfect information. Reliable information is essential to all business decision
making, and economic theory has identified asymmetric information as a key factor in
shaping markets, financial markets in particular (see e.g. Hart DEMO). Informational
asymmetries are particularly relevant in so-called principal-agent relationship, in
DEMO the welfare of one party (principal) depends on the action of another party
(agent). Growth venture investors are principals in this sense, while the venture
entrepreneurs are their agents.
There are two main types of informational asymmetries: hidden information and
hidden action. Hidden information means that the investor may not have full
knowledge of the quality of the DEMO and the skills of the entrepreneur. The
informed party then has an incentive to misrepresent his information for example by
overstating his expectations of DEMO development. If the investor does not have
suitable means of screening the applicants, the market may be crowded with low
quality projects and entrepreneurs, resulting in adverse selection. As the investor
understands this problem, he DEMO choose not to invest at all, and the market breaks
down (see Akerlof 1970).
Hidden action results from the fact that the DEMO cannot fully observe what the
entrepreneur does with the money. There is a risk that the latter will ’shirk’ and not
put any effort DEMO his job, waste money in personal expenses, or even run away with the
money. If the investor does not have effective means of DEMO the investment,
problems of moral hazard may result (see Holmström DEMO).
Now, Sahlman (1990) argues that the actual methods employed DEMO venture investors
mainly aim at alleviating these informational problems. Various authors have
subsequently studied these methods and the role they play. The following section
DEMO them.
Methods for alleviating adverse selection
Fried & Hisrich (1994) characterise venture capitalists as ‘information producers’.
They argue that venture capitalists become efficient DEMO producing information of
venture investments, because they specialise in certain types DEMO ventures and
52
Bridging the Capital Gap
industries, thereby exploiting the learning curve and economies of scale involved in
screening potential ventures.
Sahlman (1990) notes that DEMO design can also be used as a way of sorting out
bad applications, thus reducing the burden of positive investigation. For example, the
DEMO of the entrepreneur is generally tied to the performance of the venture. This does
two things: it gives the entrepreneur an incentive to put in his full effort and it
discourages poor entrepreneurs from approaching venture DEMO
Another common method for mitigating adverse selection is the use of staged
financing (Gompers 1995). Instead of giving all the money needed for the venture,
venture investors tend to invest in small stages. This DEMO them to make a small
commitment only before seeing the entrepreneur in practice. Further finance is made
contingent on the successful attainment of specified DEMO, which demonstrate
the viability of the project and the quality of DEMO entrepreneur. The investor can thus
update his information before each financing stage. Staged financing can also be seen
as a way of imposing financial DEMO: the literature on ‘soft budget constraints’
shows that too strong commitment DEMO creditors or investors can lead them to continue
to finance low-quality projects because of the sunk costs that have already been
incurred (Dewatripont & Maskin 1995). On the negative side, overly strict budget
constraints can cause inefficient ‘short-termism’. But that may be unavoidable when
the investor has DEMO information about the project quality and the entrepreneur
may misrepresent its progress to the investor, because he has more to lose if the
venture is shut down (Bergemann & Hege 2005).
Informational problems can also be mitigated by the allocation of control rights.
Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) study in detail the actual contractual provisions used in
venture capital finance. They find that VC contracts allocate separately cash flow
rights, board rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights. These
allocations are made contingent on observable measures of financial and non-financial
performance. Thus, the contract will say that, in the case of poor performance, the
DEMO, voting and liquidation rights will be allocated to the venture capitalist, who can
then use them to take over the management of the DEMO and, if necessary, liquidate
it for what it is worth. On the other hand, the contract may stipulate that in the case of
very good performance the VC relinquishes most control and liquidation rights,
DEMO retaining mere cash flow rights. In addition to rights allocation, the DEMO
find that VC contracts often include non-compete and vesting provisions, which
DEMO make it more expensive for the entrepreneur to leave the venture. As
argued above, provisions such as these do not only serve to empower the investor
after the investment has been made, but they are also likely to mitigating the adverse
selection problem by discouraging weak entrepreneurs and DEMO from accepting
the investor’s offer.
Finally, venture capitalists frequently claim that DEMO – i.e. joint finance by two
or more investors – is a method of reducing informational problems. Lerner (1994)
examines this claim by looking at the widespread practice of syndication of
investments by venture capitalists DEMO during initial investment and in later stages.
He finds that some aspects of the practice can be seen as a method of ‘decision
sharing’, which may increase the objectivity of the decision to invest.1
53
Bridging the Capital Gap
Methods for alleviating moral hazard
As already noted, some investment methods attack both adverse selection and moral
hazard. In addition DEMO those, venture investors also engage in various activities
specifically to reduce DEMO hazard. Gorman & Sahlman (1989) notice that venture
capitalists tend to be actively involved in their investments, not only monitoring them
but also supporting them by their own management experience, industry expertise and
contacts with lawyers and accountants. They often help with the building up a
professional DEMO team, and they bring reputation, which is necessary when
the venture is sold in an IPO or a trade sale.
The efficiency of DEMO investors in reducing moral hazard problems seems to lie in
the overall package of their approach. Repullo & Suarez (2004) argue that one DEMO the
reasons why venture capitalists are more efficient in performing such functions is that
they provide a combination of monitoring and support services. By DEMO their
operations to provide support and consultation services, they also gain DEMO
relevant from a monitoring perspective. Casamatta (2003) also argues that providing
finance and advice together is more efficient than providing either separately.
ECONOMICS DEMO VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS
Most studies on the economics of venture capital focus on the relationship between
the investor (principal) and the entrepreneur (agent). However, there exists another
principal-agent relationship: the one between VCs DEMO their external investors. It is
argued here that the institutional nature of venture capital funds significantly affects
their investment behaviour. The following is mainly DEMO on Sahlman (1990) as well
as Gompers & Lerner (2000), Barry (1994) and Seppä (2000).
Fund structure and formation
DEMO capital funds are most commonly structured as limited partnership
companies.2 They have a limited life, after which the total funds are distributed and
the fund vehicle is liquidated. The external investors of the fund act as DEMO
partners, whereas the fund managers (i.e. VCs) act as general DEMO of the
company.3
The money for venture capital funds mainly comes from insurance companies and
pension funds, with smaller amounts from more diverse institutions, including banks,
the government and wealthy individuals (see FVCA 2003, Barry 1994). The venture
capitalists, acting as general partners, are DEMO charge of setting up the company and
attracting external investments. They themselves usually supply no more than 1% of
the total funds, which means that almost all the money comes from the external
investors.
Venture capital DEMO are generally very large. Sahlman (1990) reports that in 1988
the average capital of all US venture capital firms was over $47 million DEMO the
largest 89 firms controlled an average of almost $200 million. Barry (1990) gives
several reasons for this size of VC funds, for example that regulatory considerations
require that each external investor only have a DEMO share of the entire fund. This
leads to large funds, because DEMO such as insurance companies want to invest
vast amounts of money and are not interested in small individual investments.
Moreover, the negotiating and contracting costs are high, which makes it inefficient to
set up small funds.
54

Agency problems and contract design
The fund DEMO are in charge of investing a large pool of money coming from a
variety of sources. This gives rise to various agency problems based DEMO asymmetric
information. Firstly, there is a problem of hidden information, because the quality of
VCs is not directly observable and there is a DEMO of potential adverse selection. In
other words, if external investors cannot DEMO between skilful and non-skilful
VCs, they may price the former out DEMO the market. The past track record of VCs will
of course serve as one source of information.
Secondly and more importantly, there are potential conflicts of interest between VCs
and their external investors. This can lead DEMO hidden action in the form of shirking and
mismanagement of the fund resources. In particular, the fact that the manager has a
limited liability position may induce him to take excessive risks. Growth venture
investments are DEMO uncertain and volatile, which makes it difficult to use fund
performance DEMO as a reliable measure of VC trustworthiness.
Sahlman (1990) argues that many of the widespread features of VC-fund contracts
mitigate agency problems between DEMO and their external investors. First, venture
capital funds are set up DEMO a limited lifetime, most commonly 10 years, after which
the company is liquidated. This is an attempt to balance between giving the fund
DEMO sufficient flexibility and safeguarding the position of the external investors.
The liquidation is accompanied by an audit, at which stage possible mismanagement
of the fund may be detected.
Secondly, VCs are compensated to a much higher degree than their initial share in the
total fund. The most common (in fact almost standard) compensation scheme is two-
fold: (1) DEMO receive each year a 2-3% fixed management fee as a proportion of the
entire fund capital; (2) in addition, they accrue a DEMO 20% of the realised
investment gains (or ’carried interest’). This DEMO is meant to guarantee a
certain basic income not subject to market volatility, while also strongly aligning the
VC’s interests with those of the external investors in making real investment profits.
This arrangement is likely to DEMO both incentive and sorting effects, thereby reducing
both adverse selection and DEMO hazard. Sahlman (1990) shows that, in practice, the
carried interest part makes usually at least half of a VC’s income, although this
55
Bridging the Capital Gap
proportion can vary greatly. For successful VCs the DEMO gains therefore constitute
most of their income.
The contract between external investors and VCs is nevertheless largely
indeterminate, giving VCs more or less free hands in managing the pool of funds.
This is not surprising if DEMO recalls that the external investors are mostly institutions
(pension funds and DEMO companies) that also manage other people’s money.
Their total funds are DEMO large indeed, which means that their investments into
venture capital funds DEMO represent no more than about 1% of their total
investments. In consequence, the venture capital investments are not a top priority for
them. This explains their relatively passive dealing with VCs.
Comparison of VC and BA DEMO contexts
It is now useful to compare the institutional context of VCs to those of BAs. VCs
invest other people’s money, whereas Bas invest their own money (whether acquired
by inheritance or by successfully running an own business).
The most importance consequence is that VCs operate under DEMO separate principal-
agent problems. As investors, they face an agency problem DEMO the entrepreneur,
giving rise to potential adverse selection and moral hazard problems. In addition, VCs
act as agents for their external investors. Thus there is a double agency problem. BAs,
who invest their own DEMO, are only affected by the first agency problem.

BAS AND VCS: WHY STRUCTURE MATTERS
VCs and BAs thrive DEMO growth venture finance because of their relative efficiency in
reducing informational asymmetries by selecting, monitoring and supporting growth
ventures (Amit, Brander & Zott 1998). In practice, VCs and BAs do all of these
functions somewhat differently. But before going into their actual investment
strategies, it is worth analysing why one would expect them to behave differently.
A hypothetical DEMO
One of the problems faced by external investors to venture capital funds is the VC’s
risk profile. This can give rise to excessive risk-taking, as the following comparison
demonstrates. A BA invests his own money; therefore he has the correct incentives
56
Bridging the Capital Gap
under any investment, whether it is a success or a failure. A VC invests others’
money, so that he has ‘limited liability’ for his investments. External investors have
the same profile as DEMO BA (although in practice they too are often mere fund
managers)DEMO
Assume there are two types of projects. Let it be that project 1 has a greater expected
value than project 2, E(r1 ) > E(r2 ) , but return from project 2, r2, DEMO riskier (i.e. more
volatile) than r1. This will be the case if, for example, project 1 is a straightforward
business concept, whereas project 2 is an adventurous idea, based on an innovative
technology not yet in existence. Thus project 2 holds potentially greater profits, but
the likelihood of success is lower.
Even if both BA and VC are DEMO to identify the projects, it can happen that the BA
will DEMO project 1 and the VC will choose project 2. BA’s expected profit from the
investment is
πBA = rI ,
where r is the growth of the investment and I is the total investment. VC’s expected
DEMO is
πVC =αrI + βI , for r ≥ 0, and
DEMO = βI , for r < 0,
where α is his contractual share of the investment gains (‘carried interest’) and β is
DEMO fixed management fee as a share of the total fund. When r is negative, the VC
bears no losses and still takes the fixed management fee.
Consider the following case. There are two projects, both for the value of 100,000.
The first one promises a yield of DEMO with certainty. The second one promises
+30% at probability 0.5 but –20% at probability 0.5. Their expected profits to the BA
will be
πBA DEMO 0.1⋅100,000 = 10,000 (project 1) and
πBA = 0.5 ⋅ (−0.2) ⋅100,000 + 0.5 ⋅ 0.3 ⋅100,000 = DEMO,000 (project 2)
The VC will expect rather different profits DEMO himself. Most commonly, the VC’s
share in the carried interest is DEMO, so that α = 0.20, and the fixed management fee is
2% of the total fund, β = 0.02. Thus he would receive
πVC = 0.2 ⋅ 0.1⋅100,000 + 0.02 ⋅100,000 = 4,DEMO (project 1) and
πVC = 0.5 ⋅ 0.2 ⋅ 0.3 ⋅100,000 + 0.02 ⋅100,000 = 5,000 (project 2).
In this example, a self-maximising and risk-neutral VC will choose project 2, DEMO
though that is manifestly detrimental to his external investors. Of course, DEMO practice
excessive risk-taking can manifest itself in many ways. For example, DEMO VC might
simply decide to invest in all sorts of adventurous projects without proper screening
57
Bridging the Capital Gap
and monitoring. This is not an exaggeration given DEMO it seems there were several
such badly managed venture investment cases during the 1990s technology bubble.4
Due diligence as a response
The problem facing DEMO external investors with the VC is similar to that facing the VC
with entrepreneurs: there may be hidden action and hidden information, giving DEMO to
moral hazard and adverse selection problems. Excessive risk-taking is just one
possible form of moral hazard. The external investors of course wish to DEMO
such excessive risk-taking. They may attempt this in a number of ways. For example,
the VC fund contract may provide some provisions on DEMO strategy, risk
profile and so on. However, it may be undesirable for the investors to monitor the
investment activity in great detail. Besides, taking all factors into account would be
unreasonable, because the cost of negotiating and drafting is high and there are many
contingencies that are DEMO impossible to take into account.5
A way to alleviate moral hazard and adverse selection is to demand a verifiable
quality signal from the VC. DEMO such possible signal is a due diligence report, which
outlines the DEMO taken by the VC to screen the investments in terms of their relevant
characteristics. However, producing due diligence may be costly and time-consuming.
Therefore a VC’s willingness to invest at an early stage depends on (1) the cost of
completing a satisfactory due diligence report and (2) the likelihood that venture will
have the pre-determined characteristics. It is clear DEMO extensive due diligence is more
costly, the less mature the venture DEMO, because obtaining information becomes easier as
the project matures. Alternatively the DEMO obtained from an earlier project is
less reliable. It follows that when this difference is significant, a VC will be at a
disadvantage in comparison to a BA who need not prepare a due diligence report DEMO
external investors.
COMPARISON OF ACTUAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Empirical surveys on the investment strategies of VCs and BAs support the foregoing
argument. This section shows DEMO, although both investors are generally concerned
with similar issues, the actual decision-making process seems substantially different.
Venture capitalists tend emphasise objective ex ante DEMO, whereas business angels
focus more on personal involvement and ex post DEMO of the venture. First of all,
VCs tend to screen their investment differently from BAs. According to Fried &
Hisrich (1994), DEMO look for three generic criteria: (1) concept, (2) management and
(3) returns, all of which can be broken down to more specific criteria. The authors
found that the decision-making process of VCs DEMO highly time consuming and labour-
intensive: the screening of an investment DEMO an average of 97.1 days and consumes
an average of 129.5 hours of the VC’s time.
In their study of BAs, Lumme, Mason & Suomi (1998) note interesting differences to
the VC screening approach. Although the key criteria used by BAs are largely similar
to those employed DEMO VCs, there are also differences. The first is the emphasis placed
DEMO the entrepreneur or the management team: BAs are concerned with their
DEMO, motivation, attitudes and trustworthiness, which reflects the fact that
BAs DEMO rely less than VCs on contract design to alleviate moral hazard
problems. ‘Personal chemistry’ is also essential, because BAs usually intend to
become actively involved in the management of the venture. BAs also want their
personal DEMO to fit the industry of the venture, because they wish to DEMO their
58
Bridging the Capital Gap
skills and experience to contribute to the business. DEMO contrast to VCs, BAs tend not to
engage in systematic market DEMO, but will rely more on their ‘intuitive’ sense of
the project’s DEMO potential and competition, using their prior experience in the
industry.
Now, some of the screening differences reflect an entirely different strategic outlook.
Indeed, Van Osnabrugge (2000) argues that screening methods cannot be isolated
from DEMO broader investment strategy, especially the extent to which the investor plans
DEMO become involved in the management of the venture. He compared the overall
investment procedures of BAs and VCs in the UK, using data from 40 personal
interviews and 262 questionnaire responses.
Van Osnabrugge found that VCs DEMO much greater emphasis on strict rules of
screening and due diligence. Later on, their involvement in the ventures was largely
limited to passive monitoring so as to reduce risks.6 They also focused on exit options
from DEMO outset. In contrast, BAs had fewer rules and objective requirements. They
DEMO to become more actively involved in the management of the ventures, DEMO to
reduce risks and to support the entrepreneur. Their exit-horizons were generally
longer than those of VCs.
Significantly, there is a clear difference with respect to due diligence. In Van
Osnabrugge’s data, VCs met the entrepreneur on average twice as many times as Bas
did. They spent more DEMO documenting the investment process itself, and they
demanded more comprehensive business DEMO from entrepreneurs. In terms of actual
costs, VCs spent on due DEMO on average 1.3% of the amount invested, as
opposed to 0.67% DEMO BAs. But this is proportionate to the amount invested, when the
DEMO invested amounts were £3.2m and £290,000 respectively. In conclusion, VCs
DEMO on average about 20 times more money on due diligence!
Van Osnabrugge actually hints at something that is at the heart of the present DEMO,
namely that the VC investment strategy may be influenced by the pressures from their
external investors. He argues that when there is competition DEMO funds, VCs will want
to employ different signals to investors. Such DEMO include maintaining a good
reputation, presenting impressive fund manager qualifications, and demonstrating the
use of responsible procedures in choosing investments – thus the DEMO emphasis on
carefully documented due diligence.
Selection efficiency in different stages of development
The screening methodology of VCs reflects a certain professionalism, which may be
lacking among some BAs. Such professionalism is arguably desirable especially in
DEMO ventures. However, it may not always be so. For example Fried & Hisrich
(1994) claim that, in their interview sample, the venture capitalists actually disagreed
among themselves on what criteria are the most important DEMO assessing potential
investment proposals. Even when they agreed on the generic criteria, they tended to
disagree on the relative weight of each criterion. When they were asked to apply the
criteria to concrete examples, they reached different conclusions as to whether the
specific criteria had been met. In DEMO, the value of extensive due diligence can
be questioned. The application DEMO specific criteria is subject to a genuine process of
human discernment, DEMO ‘intuition’.
59
Bridging the Capital Gap
The role of this intuitive element is likely DEMO be more significant when the venture is
less mature. This is supported by studies by cognitive psychologists on complex
decision-making. Such studies argue that DEMO human capacity of analysing vast
amounts of information and incorporating them into their decision-making is very
limited indeed. Zacharakis & Meyer (1998) apply DEMO insights into the growth
venturing realm by constructing an experimental environment in which they can study
how venture capitalists use given data to select DEMO different venture proposals,
and they then compare this with how the VCs themselves think they came to the
decision. Zacharakis & Meyer find DEMO, although the VCs were internally consistent
in their decision-making, they did not understand their own decision-making
processes. Their post-decision introspection tended to be DEMO towards certain
factors, which did not receive such importance during the DEMO In
conclusion the authors argue that VCs actually relied heavily on their intuition, and
the number of factors the VCs took into account tended to be smaller than they
thought afterwards. VCs are good and efficient DEMO, but extensive due
diligence may add little more than convince external DEMO
CONCLUSIONS
VCs and BAs play complementary roles in growth venture finance. The reason seems
to lie in the institutional nature of VC funds. As DEMO response to competition for external
investors, VCs have adopted investment strategies DEMO are convincing and reliable for
their investors. BAs in contrast are more entrepreneurial and get more personally
involved in their investments. The investment approach DEMO VCs may be more
professional than that of BAs, but may DEMO be so efficient for investing in small and
early-stage ventures.
There are important policy implications. Firstly, it is questionable whether public VC
funds can successfully bridge the capital and knowledge gaps found among early-
stage ventures. DEMO that channel funds to public sector start-up funds rarely
realise what difficulties such investing entails. The informational problems are
particularly severe in early-stage growth DEMO and public bodies are not likely to
possess the entrepreneurial skills necessary for dealing with these problems
successfully. Besides, public sector initiatives tend to be free from the healthy
pressures of external competition and internal shareholder DEMO In addition to
wasting taxpayer money, such public sector activities may DEMO cause disruptive
crowding-out effects on the market: they provide cheap capital DEMO unprofitable rates,
thereby discouraging the development of a healthy, efficient DEMO profitable market for
funding early-stage growth ventures.
Secondly, it seems that DEMO are the most promising solution to the capital gap.
However, the DEMO of BAs is significantly hindered in Europe by high taxation
rates. Such taxation reduces the number of wealthy entrepreneurs who, as business
angels, DEMO become the financiers and supporters of the next generations of start-up
entrepreneurs.

1 On the other hand, Lerner (1994) finds that syndication may also be used as a method of ‘window
dressing’, as others have argued in relation to pension fund management. Lerner finds that VCs often
DEMO by syndication in promising later-stage ventures even when the price is dear and the returns are
therefore low. This ‘successful’ investment can then be DEMO in reports and advertisements to
external investors, who often simply look DEMO overall returns and the firms in which the VC invested –
not at what stage and at what price the VC entered each investment. DEMO would be interesting to know
whether business angels also engage in the syndication of their investments; after all they have no
reason to appear profitable to outsiders.

that the latter view is methodologically dubious, because it is DEMO on questionnaires given to venture
capitalists. It is very likely indeed the venture capitalists will overstate their actual involvement.

INTRODUCTION
The DEMO of small and growing enterprises in creation of jobs, innovations and
DEMO is unquestionable. Studies about New Technology-Based Firms (NTBF) and
Venture Capital show that both the supply of good start-up companies and supply of
DEMO to fund these ventures is vital to success. Still, despite the DEMO availability
of funding and several principal models for aiding fledgling companies, DEMO
promising ventures fail to make it and sink into oblivion before crossing the hurdle to
success.
Over the years, scarcity of seed funding and the existence of capital gap, have become
a major obstacle in growth of start-up companies. Venture capital as an industry has
travelled far from DEMO original classic VC model born in the 50’s, as Bygrave and
DEMO noted in their landmark book “Venture Capital at the Crossroads” (Bygrave
& Timmons 1992). At the same time, venture capitalists would need DEMO ventures to
soak the capital from their funds profitably. This mismatch inevitably has impact on
national economies if not dealt with. Something can be DEMO, and indeed, in a free
economy it is evident that new business models will arise, if existing ones are not
operating perfectly.
Nevertheless, the key problem is that many promising companies fail to get
investment, even though they seemingly have got all the parts needed of success. Is
there something wrong? There are various reasons for this, and DEMO course, not all
companies are fit for success in the first DEMO But if we define that receiving venture
capital funding (so-called “first DEMO) would be a measure for success, we can
reflect the challenge facing these new, usually fast-growing companies against the
investment criteria of VC companies.
Venture-To-Capital (V2C) in Brief
First of all, we call the area starting from birth of the company and ending to the point
DEMO it arrives to the operating environment of VC companies the Venture-to-Capital
(DEMO) area. Secondly, our hypothesis is that this V2C area works deficiently like any
market which is in development. Therefore, the assumption is that the current
operating models can be developed further, thus improving target start-up’s chances
for success.
When looking at work of Mason and Harrison, we see that a given company has to
possess certain qualities to be DEMO: It has to have suitable organization
structure, be willing to grow, be prepared to give out certain amount of ownership and
control in exchange for the investment, and so on. In practice, this means DEMO the
64
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
company has intrinsically prepared itself for DEMO able to absorb the investment and
use it for growth (Mason DEMO Harrison, 2000, 2001 and 2002). Much in the same
manner, venture capitalists have their requirements, checklists, and other investment
criteria to assist them in screening their prospective target companies. In V2C context,
DEMO a company fulfils these investment criteria it becomes “investable”.
Similarly, a DEMO operative has its set of criteria for screening of “viable” or
“promising” companies. In V2C context, when a company is of interest to the V2C it
is called “prospective“ venture. Implicitly, this definition also carries the notion that a
prospective company has potential to become of interest to DEMO venture capital market.
In other words, a prospective venture possesses potential DEMO become investable.
When a given company has reached the status of being investable, the suggested
model assumes that it will eventually receive investment.1 As the VC enters the
company as an owner, it is assumed from the principles of venture capital finance that
he brings along many functions DEMO to develop the company further (see e.g.
Seppä, 2000). The ultimate goal for the VC is exit, for which the company has to
reach “listable” status. The term refers to public listing of the DEMO, realized by an
IPO, but we must not look at the case so narrow-mindedly since most exits happen
through trade sale. Nevertheless, the requirements for a listable company fulfil the
needs for both IPO and DEMO sale, and it is a task of the venture capitalist to DEMO the
company to this stage.
After the exit the company either is public (in the case of an IPO) or ceases to exist DEMO
a legal entity it was (in the case of an acquisition)DEMO Thus, if the company exists, it is
“public”. This operating mode was preceded by “VC mode” and “V2C mode”, when
the venture was being assisted and backed by either V2C or VC operative. Before
this, the venture was alone, playing “solo”, although we have to note DEMO the division
is not always this clear-cut: V2C players may be DEMO to certain extent also in the
initiating phases of a company, DEMO still continue their work during the VC phase.
VC’s may also work outside their own arena, helping companies to become investable
and being involved in recently listed companies.
These statuses and respective modus operandi of a DEMO can be illustrated in
parallel of stages in a company development. The most common classification
includes stages like idea, pre-seed, start-up, early growth, fast growth and maturity.
Between each stage, the status to be DEMO represents a set of rules to be met, before
the venture DEMO advance to the next stage. For instance, rules and requirements of
DEMO investable have to be met, before the company can advance from DEMO
phase to growth phase, moving from V2C operating mode to VC DEMO mode. All
four aspects – status, operating mode, development stage and barriers – are put
together in the accompanying picture.

Figure 1 V2C target statuses and DEMO of company development (adapted from Jungman et al.
2002)
The DEMO of this paper is first to briefly explain the key elements in operating
models of the existing V2C operatives: Incubator, Business Angel, Advisor and Seed
Capital VC, operating according to the so-called Classic VC model.  After this, a
variety of new operating models will be presented: eAccelerator, which is an
elaborated model of traditional incubator; Source Code DEMO, which resembles seed
VC without using money; Virtual CEO, which DEMO being a business angel without
money - is almost an archetypical V2C operative; LINC Trial Marriage, which
brought new incentives to Business Angels; and Venture Stables, which is a modest
corporate venturing activity within a Tampere University of Technology.
TRADITIONAL V2C BUSINESS MODELS
Overview
In this chapter, we analyse the four existing categories of V2C players - Incubator,
DEMO Angel, Advisor and Seed Capital VC – as we outline their DEMO models.
These four different operatives are by no means directly comparable, DEMO their
objectives are different. In many cases they complement each other in the field,
instead of competing rigorously.2
The four categories are not DEMO all-inclusive and complete taxonomy. This can be seen
from variations inside each category as well as new emerging variations, some of
which are presented in the next chapter. Nevertheless, in order to extend our
understanding on future of V2C business models, we must first look at what we have
had in this area for the past years.
Business Angel
Basically, a business angel is an individual (in contrast of a legal entity) with certain
amount of personal wealth and business skills, and willingness DEMO contribute some of
these to embryonic companies. The wealth may come from many sources, ranging
from own earlier successful entrepreneurship to having inherited a fortune. Due to
differences among this group, there are taxonomies differentiating business angels in
groups based on variables such as activity, available capital, DEMO investment and
focus group (Coveney & Moore 1998, Eriksson & Sørheim 2002, Gaston 1989,
Sørheim & Landström 2001).
Accordingly, the DEMO of capital available to be invested as well as the business
skills vary greatly; a successful executive may be willing to invest some of his hard-
66
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
earned money to get more challenge DEMO his life, bringing in most favourable case
invaluable expertise to the DEMO in his person. On the other hand, a well-off ex-
entrepreneur DEMO wish to invest some of the capital earned in the IPO of his company
to assist other companies in their early stages. For this DEMO angel, investments
may be like bets, but his presence may still provide the company with much more
than just money: Prestige, networks DEMO credibility, to name a few examples.
Nevertheless, the business model of a business angel is quite simple: They invest
money in early stage ventures, and in return they receive an equity stake, hoping to
DEMO their investment back with profit. Besides the “normative VC exit routes”, DEMO
trade sale and public listing, the profit scenario of a business DEMO includes also other
alternatives, such as sellback to the entrepreneur, selling forward to other investors or
keeping the stake and collecting dividends. Thus, the investment time span of an
angel is relatively long.
To accomplish DEMO goal, a typical business angel is willing to contribute some of DEMO
time to the company as well. This work tends to be non-operative, such as board work
or screening for potential VC investors, but DEMO work is by no means
exceptional: interacting or even being a DEMO of the management team, assisting in
marketing planning and implementation of DEMO plan, lobbying for clients through own
networks and so on. Only DEMO rare cases is the angel paid for these services. The caveat
is that it is not easy for the entrepreneur to know the value DEMO quality of these
services in beforehand. In other words: it is DEMO easy to judge the quality of the
business angel when looking at the investment proposal.
Figure 2 Business Model of a Business Angel
Simplified DEMO model of a business angel can be seen in the above picture: In
return for the equity stake given to the angel, the DEMO receives capital investment
and in most cases certain amount of advice and work, either consultative, operative or
board work. As the angel is DEMO individual, form of operation is informal and in a sense
“unorganised”. DEMO, the commitment level is high and time span long due to DEMO
vested interest.
Classic/Seed VC
Classical VC model is the most traditional model of venture capital investment.
Currently, the private equity market has shifted away from this model towards more
capital-intensive later-stage investments, but it can be considered that the seed VC
companies still operate according to this DEMO Also corporate venturing works this
way in a sense; typically large DEMO mid-size corporations have their funds for spinning
off internally born business ideas, which do not quite fit their own core business but
are still too valuable to be left unexploited.
67
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
Typical attributes in this model include DEMO investment span, high upside potential
and risk, immaturity of target company requiring lots of attention from the investor
and relatively small amount of DEMO required. These factors – risk, attention, and
small investment - bring in the effects of capital and skill gaps, repelling many
mainstream VC players off the early stage companies (Rasila et al, 2002).
DEMO, entering the target as early as possible should still bring most DEMO
results in exit phase.
Figure 3 Classical Seed Venture Capital Business Model
The business model resembles the one of a business angel in many DEMO, but in this
case the operative is a legal entity, being professional in the activity in question. Also
the type of networks and DEMO brought in may be substantially different. Networks
may be more formal and defined, and be international. Advice is in most cases limited
to board work and assistance in special situations such as recruiting top executives,
DEMO capital and crisis management.
Incubator
Principally, an incubator is an “office DEMO for fledgling companies. Office services
are readily available and a variety of business development and support services are at
hand easily. Apart from some DEMO grants or subsidies for rent, incubators do
not finance their tenants, but merely offer their services and office space for money.
Thus, incubator as a concept is fairly straightforward, but in reality its incarnations
come in many forms.
As Aernoudt defines it “a business incubator’s main goal DEMO to produce successful
firms that will leave the incubator financially viable and free-standing within a
reasonable delay”. Yet, the same author presents a taxonomy with five different main
categories of incubators, including technology incubators for overcoming
entrepreneurial gap and regional development incubators, which are in most cases
political operations, trying to create businesses and jobs in areas which are
underdeveloped or undergoing a structural change. Furthermore, the operation may be
either real or virtual incubator. All in all, it can be concluded that incubator is an
umbrella concept (Aernoudt 2002).
Incubators themselves may be non-profit or for-profit organizations, but as pointed
out by Paul A. Gompers in his recent lecture to US venture capitalists, most of the
hundreds of for-profit incubators established in the US between 1999 and 2000 have
had DEMO close their doors. Reasons for this were seen to be limited experience of
managers, too ambitious investment plans and adverse selection of companies, DEMO the
incubators only got the see the “bad deals”.
68
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
Figure 4 Business Model of an DEMO
The incubator business model shows that services and facilities are given to the
company for money. In some cases, some part of the services are offered for free or
subsidized with governmental support. Financing is a DEMO issue for many of the
tenants, as the funding has to DEMO from business angels and other seed financiers.
Therefore, networking with these DEMO is crucial for the long-term success of
incubator.
Overall, the time DEMO of an incubator is medium-range and the organization is a legal
entity. This gives possibility to building a good organization to support the ventures.
DEMO in many cases the executives of the incubator do not have lots of
business development skills. Furthermore, as there is no vested interest, DEMO long-term
incentive such as equity stake neither for the executive or the incubator itself they
may also lack commitment to the long-term success of DEMO company.
Advisor
Advisors may be individual consultants or consultant companies. They offer various
services for money: market research, exporting, writing business plan, DEMO raising
capital to name but a few. They are generally professional and entrepreneurial in what
they do, delivering good quality advice for different situations. Naturally, actual
results may vary as not all advisors are equal, DEMO none of them is an expert in every
issue facing a start-up venture.
Like incubators, they provide no funding but on the contrary require immediate
monetary compensation for their services. Therefore, unless the target venture is
backed up with excessive amount of “friendly money”, it has to find a source for
financing. This, of course, can happen through an DEMO offering this kind of
services. Networks are crucial for the long-term success of an advisor, as they are
often called in by other V2C players and vice versa.
Figure 5 Business Model of an Advisor
69
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
In general, the advisor provides the client with advice on a specific issue for money.
Concentrating on one DEMO of development, the approach is seldom holistic. Also, the
work is short-term by nature, as it is usually project-based. Board work would give
the advisor certain amount of long-term commitment and holistic view, but advisors
are rarely seen in the board of their client companies. All in DEMO, an advisor is a
professional working with a client, not an owner looking after his possession.
Summary
There is a multitude of parameters DEMO could use to compare the operatives presented
above: means of compensation, degree of long-term commitment, availability and
reachability, level of networking, scope of work, quality of skills and so on. Let us
summarize some of these parameters to a table as done below:

From financing point-of-view, DEMO are two completely opposing pairs within these
four: business angel and DEMO VC, who bring money in, and incubator and advisor,
who take it out. These pairs also differ in availability: incubators and advisors are
more generally available, where as business angels tend to keep out of sight, and both
them and seed venture capitalists are a scarce resource to begin with.
Before making any deeper observations, let us look at the new, emerging models,
some of which are close to existing ones while some of them are not.
EMERGING V2C BUSINESS MODELS
DEMO
Someone has said: “The only stable and constant thing in the DEMO is change”. So,
how have the V2C players changed, or DEMO kind of change is required from them to
adjust to the changes happening around them, in their operating environment? We
could approach this DEMO by looking at the changes already happened: the
operating models of DEMO kind of V2C players.
In our Darwinian world, time will tell DEMO one or ones of traditional and new
models are the winning ones. New variations may pick features from several other
models, adding something new, and try the combination out in the marketplace. In
time, this DEMO test will show if the model is fit for life or not: if it serves the venture
and economy in general, it is DEMO to succeed and have followers. This, of course,
assumes a DEMO world, competition and economy, but it is the best we can do.
In the following, five quite heterogeneous examples of these new operatives are
presented. The selection of examples is based on the effort to DEMO this presentation
interesting and thought-provoking. As these five examples can hardly be a basis for
70
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
taxonomy, a more ambitious “collection of specimen” is underway. Anyway, let us
now look at these five new operatives:
- eAccelerator, boosting fledgling companies with money and advisors
- Source Code Finland, investing “sweat capital” for equity compensation
- Virtual CEO, a business angel who does not invest money but time
- Trial Marriage of LINC Scotland business angel network, overcoming the
constraints of the informal VC market
- University Venture Stables, giving innovations a free push within the
university
eAccelerator
eAccelerator is one of the six programs of DEMO, which is an umbrella project
promoting e-business, e-society and new economy in many forms in Tampere region
in Finland. The heart of the DEMO is the second biggest city in Finland, where brick-
and-mortar industries DEMO traditionally been dominant. The transformation to new
economic basis has been quite successful, though, compensating to large extent the
loss of jobs in DEMO industries, textile mills and shoe factories.
The city has been actively DEMO in many actions and organizations supporting this
positive development, and one DEMO most recent initiatives is eAccelerator. It is
operated by a leading business development agency in Tampere region, Hermia
Business Development, which has been DEMO closely together with the Hermia
Science Park and adjacent Tampere University of Technology.
Companies are screened in normal manner with public funding, but also by use of a
business plan competition, trying to promote entrepreneurship. Contracts with
accepted companies are tailored from case to case, with variable time span,
deliverables and compensation method. In addition to various business development
DEMO by Hermia Business Development, ranging from patent consulting and
market research DEMO improving the business plan and raising capital, the deliverables
may include DEMO amount of investment. The investment is not intended to cover
operative costs such as marketing or product development, and is too small for these
activities in the first place anyway. Instead, it is to be used to cover up direct costs of
the business development project such as DEMO of other experts or patenting, according
to the guidelines agreed in DEMO contract in beforehand.
Method of compensation is preferably money, but success DEMO or equity can be used as
well. Payback is not immediate, DEMO triggered by set milestones, such as VC funding
or major sales DEMO Payback may also be conditional, which brings more risk and
incentive DEMO the scheme. So far (November 2002) more than ten companies have been
accepted to the fairly active program, and the results have been promising.
71
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
Figure 6 Model of eAccelerator
eAccelerator DEMO model is a mixture of business angel, advisor and seed VC,DEMO
which is natural since its operation has features from all of these players as well.
Business angel would give more money and only accept DEMO in return. Investment
of a seed VC would be much less consulting-intensive and concentrate on the capital
injection instead, while advisor might give the same amount of consulting but not
accept conditional or equity payback. Depending DEMO the assignment, time span may
range from short to long. It DEMO to be in the longer end and definitely is if there is
vested interest in the form of equity, success fee being usually a medium range
incentive.
Source Code Finland
Source Code Finland resembles eAccelerator in DEMO ways: It has a professional
organization and fairly fixed time span, making work-intensive investments to
existing companies. On the other hand, it explicitly prefers equity to monetary
payment as compensation for the services. Also, they only invest their own time,
“sweat capital” as quoted by their DEMO in an interview, and do not provide any
capital for paying DEMO of other advisors. So far (November 2002) they have
screened 105 companies but not made an “investment” yet – therefore the success of
DEMO model is yet to be seen.
Figure 7 Business Model of Source Code Finland
The business model of Source Code Finland is fairly similar DEMO the one of business
angel, but unlike in the case with DEMO angel there is no capital investment towards the
company. Instead, one DEMO the defined functions of this V2C player is to guide the
target venture to venture capital round one, and presumably exit at round two or later,
adding value to the company at each phase. Time DEMO is planned to be in the range of
two years from entry to exit, which can be considered fairly long-term interest. And
after all, there is vested interest in the form of shares, which only DEMO profit to the
V2C player is the venture is successful.
72
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
Virtual CEO
The Virtual CEO is DEMO rather “unofficial” and informal concept presented by Randy
Komisar, when he DEMO his own work in semi-fictional autobiography “The
Monk and the Riddle” (DEMO 2001). Yet, as there are other individuals working
according to DEMO same model, it deserves a place in our analysis for V2C DEMO
To put it simply, Virtual CEO is a business angel without DEMO He possesses such
skills and networks, that the entrepreneur or founders DEMO a new venture are willing to
give him a stake in the company, knowing that he in turn will contribute his time and
knowledge for developing the company. Upside potential gives incentive to the
Virtual CEO, and it is easy to imagine that this is a win-win game.
DEMO 8 Business Model of Virtual CEO
The business model looks very much like the one of a business angel, except that
money has been removed from the equation. We also get this model by replacing
“money” DEMO “shares” in the advisor model. And finally, we should note that DEMO
model is exactly the same as the Source Code Finland model presented above, just
that in this case we are dealing with a private individual, not a legal entity.
Trial Marriage
It is by now clear that when talking about the mismatch between early-stage ventures
and early-stage financiers, we must look at the problem from both ends. It is true DEMO
the supply side in the (informal) venture capital market has problems, having shifted
to later stage companies and sometimes posing unrealistic expectations to
entrepreneurs with little to give back other than money. On the other DEMO, the
demand side is not perfect either; new ventures are far from being ready for
investment, and the screening process takes time from the potential investors
especially when the target is still unorganised, working ad hoc day to day.
To intrigue business angels in exploring ventures, which seem to be interesting but
need work, the Trial Marriage program was created. The program was partially
funded European Union and operated by LINC DEMO, one of the eldest and most
active business angel networks in DEMO UK. Quite simply, the idea of the program was
to make DEMO angel work for the company as a consultant for up to 15 days, after which
he could then make the investment decision. If the decision would be positive, support
would be paid back to the program. In case of negative decision, the company would
have enjoyed for 15 days of subsidized consulting (Mason & Harrison, 2002).
The program DEMO active in 1998-99 and is being re-launched at the time or writing of
this paper. Most substantial differences are that a slightly raised amount DEMO support is
73
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
paid to the company instead of DEMO investor, and that in case of an angel investment the
grant DEMO be converted to equity, giving upside potential to the income. This DEMO seen
by LINC Scotland as an important alternative for funding the program, which is
initially heavily dependent on public funding.
Figure 9 Business Model of Trial Marriage of LINC Scotland
In this business model we have DEMO parties and two phases. First, when a suitable
candidate is found DEMO accepted to the program, a business angel starts working with
the DEMO, using up to 15 days of time to inspect and evaluate DEMO venture, and
consulting the entrepreneur and resolving open issues in due DEMO For this work,
the angel – or angel syndicate for that matter - receives money, which would be too
low for a professional consultant but is enough for the angel, for whom this is not the
source of daily income but more of general interest. The second DEMO is conditional:
If a positive investment decision is made, the DEMO is returned to the program.
The model is fairly cost-effective, especially DEMO we note that five of six target
companies eventually got invested in. Thus, most of the money was returned back to
the program. The organization of the Trial Program could be described to be non-
professional DEMO bureaucratic, due to the involvement of many parties and European
Union DEMO Finally, when time span is considered, the program itself is short-term
activity, but the work has potential for long-term effect as business angels get
involved with and committed to the target ventures.
Venture Stables
Like DEMO foster the ideas born within their organizations through corporate
venturing, some DEMO have established means to promote the innovations
brought up by their students or staff members. This is appreciable activity with lots of
potential. After DEMO, there are many innovations in universities but the lack of
entrepreneurial DEMO may hinder exploiting them in practice. Supporting ideas and
entrepreneurship also contributes to the job satisfaction of the staff.
One example of “University Venturing” DEMO be found in Tampere University of
Technology, which has a program DEMO Yritystallit or “Venture Stables”. When
students or staff of the university have a business idea or an innovation, they can
apply for the program. If accepted, university will give premises, computers and
phone first for DEMO year, with an option for second year if the venture seems DEMO be
making progress. Additionally, since especially students might be unwilling to DEMO
from the scarce amount of money intended to be used for living while studying, the
university will cover up to €7000 of expenses in expert services, such as market
74
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
research, patenting costs etc. The stable also takes advantage of the more traditional
innovation and patenting service present DEMO the university.
Venture Stables is in a sense a “virtual organization”, DEMO the premises are not all in the
same place but usually assigned at the faculty where the idea originates in order to
help the DEMO work of the embryonic entrepreneurs. Furthermore, there is no full-time
staff, as managing the screening process and supporting the ventures is outsourced to
DEMO business development company working closely with the university.
Figure 10 Business Model of Venture Stables of Tampere University of Technology
The operating model has DEMO in common with incubator, advisor and seed VC,
yet the DEMO model seems to come straight from the Red Cross: the venture DEMO
expect no money back from the venture nor are they requesting and equity stake in it.
Not that the university would be capable to DEMO shares in compensation of money
or services for that matter – local legislation prohibits this. For this reason, the activity
could be described as “strategic charity work”, with internal job satisfaction, welfare
of the society DEMO goodwill in general as ultimate goals. The organization is
practically non-existent and the time span is mid-range.
Summary
Again, we summarize some of the key features of the V2C operatives in a table
below. Apart from DEMO non-profit Venture Stables, compensation method seems to be
falling more and DEMO on the equity side, and time span is long. It could DEMO argued,
that professional organizations such as Source Code Finland and eAccelerator are not
bureaucratic but entrepreneurial, based on their success-based incentives.

Let us no go forward to comparing all presented models together and DEMO to analyze
our findings so far. Based on these findings, an DEMO will be made to tentatively
outline a “best practice”, as it DEMO still too early to speak about delineating any
normative V2C player in this context.

Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this study, four traditional and five new operatives were examined and their
business models DEMO In this chapter, these business models are analyzed and
their strategy DEMO summarized, trying to build understanding of system logic of V2C
area. DEMO effort will then be made to sketch the “best practice” operating model of a
new kind of V2C operative.
When comparing the traditional and DEMO business models, four observations are made
as conclusions. First of all, new models are hybrids of traditional models with some
new features being DEMO out in each case. Being a business angel without money or
making non-profit corporate venturing inside a university is a new variation of an DEMO
scheme, and time will tell if the variation is successful. If DEMO is, it will stay and have
followers, like any other business found profitable. What are the sustainable key
success factors is the question.
DEMO, contributing intellectual capital in the sense of “sweat capital” or business
DEMO is seen as a key requisite. Current venture capital industry has enough
funds to give it to those in need, but has shifted away from the early stage companies
in both minimum size of investment as DEMO as expertise. This is among others due to
the fact that venture capital activity is not scalable, when more money is poured in,
the number of VC partners and their combined expertise should grow accordingly.
DEMO has not happened, thus creating a need for the V2C industry DEMO step in to fill the
skill – or competence – gap.
Furthermore, to make the V2C work as efficient as possible, there should DEMO
possibility for an optimal V2C player to invest also money. Otherwise, DEMO financial
difficulties and raising capital will hinder the development speed, which DEMO many
cases is crucial. This could be imagined to be own money or a fund managed by the
player, or even “outsourced” to a sturdy network of business angels, even though
partnership-like fund as with most VC funds would be most flexible and therefore
most viable option.
Finally, it can be seen that the trend goes towards obtaining equity interest DEMO the
target company. This has several advantages. First, new venture has DEMO shares to
give, but no money with which to pay. Second, the upside potential is highly
motivating to the V2C party – at DEMO as long as the venture looks promising. Third,
sharing ownership spells long range commitment to both parties in question.
Naturally, like all coins this has two faces, too: Being paid in equity introduces need
DEMO operating capital and major business risk to the V2C player. And in the case of a
successful exit, it is the most expensive way of payment for the entrepreneur – who in
the end of the DEMO may still be on the receiving side of it.
The following table summarizes the key parameters of V2C business models. It
combines the two DEMO presented before, adding a hypothetical V2C player in the
end of DEMO list presented. The parameters of this “best practice” V2C player are
discussed in the following.

Probably the most crucial notions from the point DEMO the target venture are the quality
and level of services given, DEMO true long-term commitment to the development and
success. These requirements speak first of all for a professional organization,
developed over time of seasoned, committed experts. Additionally, the requirement of
long-term commitment to success of target ventures strongly suggests, that there has
to be vested interest in the company.
This commitment can be realized in form of success fees, but the most intriguing
alternative to all parties is equity, bringing longest and strongest ties and highest
upside potential. Furthermore, this equity incentive should preferably be extended to
the individual executives of the V2C player to promote DEMO attitude to the
business development done in the target companies. The V2C player could also be a
partnership like VC partnerships of today, with part of the success flowing back to the
partners doing the actual DEMO
As was noted earlier, the optimal V2C player has capacity to DEMO seed capital to the
target venture. Again, looking at the current DEMO facto venture capital partnership we
find a model which can be copied or used as an example. This fund should be big
enough to DEMO parsimony, but allow also small investment with long time span and
DEMO risk. The managing V2C player should have control over it to avoid bureaucracy
and to genuinely take responsibility of its profitability. It can be DEMO, that we are
talking about shooting in the wind and hoping DEMO hit something. This approach may
still do better than screening the companies too tightly, rejecting most proposals and
then giving even the most promising companies just peanuts, asking them to “prove
their business case” with this investment which is too small to begin with.
To summarize, the optimal V2C company should have ample amount of dedicated
experts at its disposal, either own staff or from a network built for this purpose. It
DEMO be able to direct capital investments to the target venture, to DEMO the
initial growth of the company. Both the executives working with the company and the
V2C player itself should be tied to the target DEMO vested interest. This commitment
could best be done in the form of equity stake, releasing the venture from the burden
of having to pay for business development services and thus freeing the funds to be
77
Traditional and Emerging Venture-to-Capital Business Models
targeted to other pro-active activities such DEMO product development, organizational
development, sales and marketing. And finally, if DEMO executives would be partners in
this delineated V2C player, they would DEMO the ambition, entrepreneurship and team
spirit needed to work successfully with DEMO target companies, which would – in
many ways – resemble their DEMO partnership.
It is not the purpose of this paper to reach decisive conclusions about preferred
methods of V2C work, or to build a complete model and taxonomy for the V2C
players. Rather, the aim is to open up discussion and pave way to future research on
the issue: What things have changed during the existence of the traditional V2C
players? What do these changes require from V2C players? What are the most
prominent success factors of V2C players for themselves and their target ventures?DEMO
And ultimately: What would be the winning V2C business model?

INTRODUCTION
Filling the gaps between venture and capital
The importance of growth-oriented entrepreneurial companies to economic
development and job DEMO is unarguable. However, the full growth potential of
these ventures can DEMO be realised without access to external resources. Classically,
the providers of external resources, the enablers, have been labelled venture
capitalists, either formal or informal venture capital investors. Brophy (1986) has
argued that it DEMO unlikely that a country or a region can be competitive without a
dynamic and vibrant venture capital (VC) community. In fact, investors who decide
on behalf of society at large which new ventures are to DEMO forward, and which not,
play an almost godlike role in DEMO economy.
The supply of venture capital – and the size of an average VC fund and, hence, the
amount of a minimum investment DEMO soared towards the end of second millennium in
both the US and Europe. Even after the downturn in venture capital investing after
2000, there are two key notable developments in VC activity.  First, new business
DEMO are increasingly more knowledge intensive, driven in part by the application DEMO
ICT as an enabling technology across industrial sectors. Outside the Venture-to-
Capital context Eliasson and Eliasson (1996) have discussed the idea of competence
DEMO and pointed to the shift in industrial organisation in a similar way.
Second,  because the average size of venture capital fund has increased DEMO rapidly
than the number of venture capital investment executives, and although DEMO is more
venture capital financing available than ever before, it is DEMO offered in small enough
doses to meet the needs of many start-up and early stage companies. In Finland, the
average size of seed stage investment has risen from 85 000 € in 1997 to the peak DEMO
450 000 € in 2001 and still remaining at 250 000 € in 2003 (FVCA 2004); the formal
venture capital industry has moved towards larger and later-stage investments. This
trend is well-documented (see e.g. Bygrave and Timmons 1992, Sohl 1999, Murray
1999, Seppä 2000).
The two phenomena have resulted in a Knowledge Gap between prospective
entrepreneurial ventures DEMO the venture capital industry. A variety of players is now
bridging the gap between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The actors refining
prospective ventures to DEMO them “investable”, in the eyes of venture capital
industry, include incubators, advisors, business angels, corporate venturers and seed
venture capitalists. These players are referred to as Venture-to-Capital or V2C actors.
These partly new type DEMO actors are filling the gap between venture and capital by
bringing in the knowledge needed in growth ventures. (Seppä and Näsi 2001,
80
From Capital Investors to Knowledge Investors
Jungman, Kankaala, Rasila and Seppä DEMO, Jungman, Okkonen, Rasila and Seppä
2004b, Rasila 2004) However, very little do we know about the nature, priorities, and
operating DEMO of these new knowledge investors in the context of the operation of
the early stage entrepreneurial capital market as a whole. A classification of DEMO
vs. knowledge intensive entrepreneurial investors is presented in Figure 1. Horizontal
axis illustrates the perceived relative portion of an investor’s knowledge vs. capital
(brains vs. cash) investment.
Figure 1 Knowledge-intensity of formal vs. informal investors
With the general rise of ICT enabled – and enforced – business models DEMO concepts
and, consequently, the transformation from capital intensive to knowledge intensive
new venture activity, the godlike role in an economy referred to above may be
shifting from those who invest (venture) capital to those DEMO invest knowledge in
ambitious entrepreneurial ventures to render them ”investable” in the eyes of the
venture capital industry. In the language of this study: In the knowledge society, the
role of the enabling investor is shifting from venture capital to V2C investors.
RESEARCH MISSION AND STRATEGY
The target DEMO this study is to shed some light on the nature of the typical
entrepreneurial knowledge intensive V2C investor in Finland. This will, especially, DEMO
done in three selected dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation (EO): innovativeness,DEMO
risk taking, and proactiveness (see e.g. Lumpkin and Dess 1996, DEMO 2004). V2C
activity will be seen as an entrepreneurial process. Further, as the V2C actors have
emerged to act as a bridge between ventures and venture capital, it is important to
know what the relationship between the V2C and the venture capital actors is. Hence,
the DEMO will also discuss the complementarities between venture capital and V2C
activity and identify opportunities for further collaboration especially in the light of
sequential investing DEMO co-investing.
The first task is to construct a guiding framework based on earlier research on V2C
activity, on private equity investor’s EO, and DEMO complementarities between venture
capital and V2C. At the moment, our knowledge DEMO these phenomena is very limited.
Hence, also this research is mainly DEMO by nature.
When designing the research approach for the present study, DEMO on the authors’
initial understanding of the issues at hand, a DEMO of interview questions was
constructed. Empirical data was gathered via semi-structured interviews conducted
81
From Capital Investors to Knowledge Investors
with seven formal and seven informal DEMO V2C investors. The ultimate aim of the
study is to construct one concluding proposition for a new theoretical framework to
increase our understanding of DEMO activity as entrepreneurial ownership profession,
and complementarities between V2C and other stakeholders – especially venture
capitalists – of the growth company process.
THEORETICAL DEMO
V2C actors as entrepreneurs
There are only few studies that have made the difference between entrepreneurial and
non-entrepreneurial early stage investors. A notable one DEMO Landström’s (1998) study
on “Informal Investors as Entrepreneurs” (for earlier DEMO, see Seppä et al. 1992).
Landström (1998) looks early DEMO investing as an entrepreneurial process, not as a
financial phenomenon. He DEMO for example that informal investors want to be able
to influence the future development of the firm, they trust their personal network as
source of and assessing for investment proposals, and they put importance on trust
and personal chemistry between the investor and entrepreneur. He goes as far DEMO
calling the informal investor “co-creator” and the actual entrepreneur as “co-
entrepreneur”.
Another way to see V2C actors as entrepreneurs is through EO theory. DEMO, “an
EO refers to the processes, practices and decision-making activities that lead to new
entry” (Lumpkin and Dess 1996). New entry can be for example, the act of launching
a new venture. The dimensions of EO have been developed over the last two decades
and they DEMO at least 1) Proactiveness, 2) Innovativeness, and 3) Risk DEMO
(Miller 1983, Covin and Slevin 1989, Lumpkin and Dess 1996)DEMO Lumpkin and Dess
(1996) also included two more dimensions, which DEMO necessarily been adopted by
others (Lindsay 2004): 4) Autonomy, DEMO 5) Competitive aggressiveness. They also
theoretically proved that all of these DEMO dimensions may vary independently in given
conditions (Lumpkin and Dess 1996)DEMO Hence, they may also be studied as independent
factors.
Lindsay (2004) extended the theory of EO-performance relationship to business
angels. He tested 4 hypotheses with measures for EO and investment performance on
79 respondents. The DEMO showed that business angels have an EO, and there is an
DEMO performance relationship. He adopted the definitions for
proactiveness, innovativeness and risk DEMO from Lumpkin and Dess (1996). The
same definitions are also DEMO for this study. Herein, “risk taking involves a tendency
to take DEMO actions, such as venturing into unknown new markets, committing a large
portion of resources to firms with uncertain outcomes, and/or borrowing heavily”
(Lindsay 2004). As V2C investors, by definition, are expected to invest relatively
more knowledge (hands-on involvement, etc.) than capital in their target ventures,
they are also expected to have the opportunity to DEMO their investments more closely
(than venture capitalists), in other words, show proactiveness. The nature of their
investment grants them relatively more post-investment DEMO control and therefore
they are expected to accept relatively more risk at the time of initial investment.
(Jungman and Seppä 2004, Van Osnabrugge DEMO)
In fact, the type of risk V2C actors are willing DEMO take resembles that of the
entrepreneur. “Proactiveness is an opportunity-seeking, forward-looking DEMO
that involves introducing new products/services and acting in anticipation of future
82
From Capital Investors to Knowledge Investors
demand” (Lindsay 2004). In the present study, proactiveness is measured especially
as involvement in investee management. In relative terms, when compared with
venture capitalists, V2C actors are likely DEMO be more proactive owners who are
involved in operational management and try to initiate change rather than to react on
events as members of DEMO board. This is also presumed to show, as mentioned above,
DEMO the relative amount of invested financial capital vs. knowledge capital.
Proactiveness is also expected to show in sources of deal flow. According to Lindsay
(2004), EO shows in leveraging of informal networks (friends, associates, media,
etc.). Innovativeness refers to a “basic willingness to depart DEMO existing
technologies or practices and venture beyond the current state of the art” (Lumpkin
and Dess 1996). The core of V2C activity lies in knowledge investment. Hence, in
this study, special attention is given DEMO innovativeness in the V2C business model, the
vehicle to invest knowledge.
DEMO between VC and V2C
The research on complementarities between formal and informal venture capital
markets has been very limited. Further, the formal and informal venture capital
markets have very often been viewed as separate. (Harrison and Mason 2000) Instead,
Harrison and Mason (ibid.) suggest that “research should move from consideration
solely of the actors in the market to DEMO analysis of the market itself and its operation”.
The business angel market – and therefore the whole V2C market – should be viewed
as DEMO part of capital market. One such attempt is the growth company process
illustrated in Figure 2. It does not only show the vitality of DEMO and venture capital
working together to build successful ventures, but also DEMO the role of
government in the capital market. This kind of framework of thinking could lead to
improvements in both venture capital and V2C DEMO and, herein, contribute to the
development of new ventures.
Figure 2 The growth company process (Jungman et al. 2004a)
Jungman et al. (2004b) suggest that the illustrated chain thinking should show in the
DEMO development of the venture. In fact, we argue that V2C activity DEMO be
developed as an ownership or a “principal’s” profession, and venture DEMO entry
should provide at least a partial exit to the V2C actor to symbolise the pass of the
baton in the growth company process (cf. Benjamin and Margulis 1996). Aligning of
the interests of the DEMO, the V2C actor and the VC actor – linking all of DEMO
primary profiting to the final exit of the venture capitalist – would also increase the
supply of high quality ventures to venture capitalists.

From Capital Investors to Knowledge Investors
Harrison and Mason (2000) name DEMO types of complementarities between venture
capital and business angels: sequential investing, co-investing, provision of funds, and
deal referral. Of these, sequential investing is probably the most obvious and was
already referred to in the DEMO paragraph. The existence of this kind of
complementarity in the US has been well-documented. However, it is unclear whether
this occurs outside the US. There is also strong evidence that business angels co-
invest alongside venture DEMO funds in the US. Further, they often provide
technology or entrepreneurial DEMO to assist in the due diligence and post-
investment control. (Ibid.) Again, it is not clear how many Finnish venture capitalists
and business angels made investments of this type. However, there are statistics that
show Finnish business angels investing into venture capital funds: The peak-year of
private persons’ investments in venture capital funds i.e. provision of funds in Finland
DEMO 1999 amounting total of 28 M€; before and since that (1998–2002) the amount
has varied between 7 and 9 M€ (FVCA 2004)DEMO Deal referral is defined as “the
informal networking of deals and deal flow between business angels and VC firms”
(Harrison and Mason 2000).
In this study, we harness this framework of complementarities even to broader
purpose: To study the complementarities between venture capital and V2C, and DEMO
further, to understand the complementarities in the whole growth company process.
DEMO AND METHODOLOGY
To investigate the emerging group of entrepreneurial knowledge investors, DEMO
qualitative study of the nature and investment process of V2C investors was
undertaken. This exploratory study presents results from 14 interviews with formal
and DEMO entrepreneurial V2C investors in Finland. In total, seven formal V2C
investors (full-time based and/or incorporated partnerships) and seven informal V2C
investors (DEMO based and/or individual solo operations) were interviewed in
Finland in DEMO, 2004.  According to the underlying theoretical framework only the
activity of the interviewees related to taking capital and/or knowledge investment
based ownership DEMO in target ventures was under investigation. Resulting from
the interviews, one DEMO the formal V2C investors was excluded from the final sample,
due to non-entrepreneurial status in investment decision-making. Hence, the final
sample comprised six formal V2C investors and seven informal V2C investors. Of the
formal V2C DEMO three were classified in the category of seed venture capitalists,
two in the category of advisors, and one in the category of incubators. All of the
informal V2C investors were classified as business angels. However, the range of
knowledge-intensity in the investment activity of the business angels DEMO was
extremely varied; from almost zero capital investment to only marginal DEMO
investment.
To secure comparative research data, a structured interview exercise was DEMO
In order to check the interview form, it was tested with DEMO knowledge investor
known to the researchers. The test led to light changes in the framing of the questions.
The interviews were recorded and the DEMO sessions lasted for an average of 45–60
minutes. The interview process comprised both qualitative and quantitative questions,
and an open space section. The DEMO were followed by quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the interview data.

RESULTS
In general, the risk, DEMO making and earning model of V2C actors seem to
resemble the ones of entrepreneurs. There also seems to be a willingness to work in DEMO
closer co-operation with venture capitalists. In Table 1 are presented some quotations
from the interviews. Below the three selected dimensions of EO and the DEMO
complementarities between venture capitalists and V2C actors are discussed in more
detail.
Table 1 Quotations from the interviews
Proactiveness
“I invest my time, not money.”
“I go there to build strategic alliances and partnerships.”
“The existing DEMO alliances and partnerships are not important; those will be made if
DEMO make it investment ready for capital investors.”
“Very often I work as a procurer or midwife between ventures and potential owners.”
“If I feel DEMO I don’t posses any relevant knowledge I will stay out of it.”
Innovativeness
– “…knowledge should be structured so that it’s worth money and DEMO more than money. The
most precious thing that you can give to a venture is your time. There should be a way of
selling DEMO knowledge”
– “In my concept, I invest my knowledge and I DEMO to get paid in one way or another… by
investing I’m in the same boat with the entrepreneur.”
– “It is healthy for companies DEMO pay for knowledge… it seems that they are not willing to do
so.”
Risk taking
– “… venture capital and investments made by government DEMO not personal risk taking and are
in different position than informal investors as they don’t invest their own money but have
collected it from DEMO else.”
– ”Return potential is more important [than risk control], especially DEMO talking about sweat
capital investments. The more [financial] capital is involved, DEMO more the weight of risk
control perspective will increase; in other DEMO, the already well-earned money is not
willingly lost.”
– “You have DEMO too risk-averse if you don’t get financial losses from time to time.”
Complementarities
– ”Syndication in a way that a business angel invests money, but doesn’t take an active role [in a
company], and accepts that we get the same share of ownership without matching financial
investment, and knows that we will make work to the venture.”
– “We can DEMO second-round financing to the ventures – not necessarily from our own fund,
but from other investors… our task is to make it [the DEMO look like a company to get it to
a growth path.”
– “Our skill is to get the capital investor in there [to the DEMO
– ”There should be an easy way for business angels to become owners in ventures and to make
an exit possible at the time DEMO the next financing round. This way we could accelerate the
circulation of money; a person like this could make a new investment to somewhere else.”
– ”The entrepreneur expects to get much more knowledge or sweat DEMO from the venture
capitalists than he/she actually gets, because a) there is no knowledge and b) there is no time.”
V2C actors as entrepreneurs
“A lonely wolf is a poor predator.” (Informal V2C investor
interviewed)
Many of the interviewed V2C actors expressed their willingness to DEMO in close co-
operation with the founders; they even feel that DEMO are “in the same boat with the
entrepreneur”. This is further testified by the fact that nine of the interviewees rate the
85

team as the most important selection DEMO The remaining four rate the team as the
second most important selection criteria after market expectations (3) or product
features (1).
Of team skills, seed venture capitalists seem to value track record, capabilities DEMO
skills, whereas other V2C actors value softer characteristics such as enthusiasm,DEMO
commitment and attitude. All investors seem to emphasise market growth rate, DEMO in
addition, capital intensive seed venture capitalists seem to weight the DEMO
situation in the market to the same extent. Out of the deal characteristics for informal
V2C investors, advisors and incubators, the most important DEMO to be their own
“involvement in business development”, whereas seed venture DEMO weight
syndication and their own status as lead vs. co-investors. These findings further
support our thinking that knowledge intensive V2C actors are after someone DEMO work
with – and emphasise shareholder chemistry, whereas more capital intensive DEMO
venture capitalists are more after someone to make money with.
From the results of this study, it is likely that V2C actors show high amount of
proactiveness. They seem to value their own activity and informal DEMO as
sources of deal flow. Only two of the interviewed V2C actors perceived that they
invest more capital than knowledge. The interviewees also heavily DEMO their
non-financial contribution in the investee companies; going as far as DEMO from the
opportunity if they felt that money is only aid they can give. Many of them also
highlighted their skill to acquire venture DEMO
Most of the interviewees ponder upon the same question: How to DEMO paid for
investing knowledge? They are willing to look for new DEMO operating models to
tackle this problem. These findings also indicate that there is a need to better assess
the complementarities between venture capitalists and DEMO actors. The options they
offered to investee companies included delayed payments, DEMO without securities,
and payments based on the profits of the investee.
There seems to be a strong correlation between Risk taking and knowledge DEMO
of the investment; the higher the knowledge intensity the higher the DEMO that
V2C actor weights return potential over risk control in other words is willing take
relatively more risk. The risk taken is in the DEMO level – V2C actors are typically
investing their own time and money unlike most of the government schemes and
venture capitalists. Also in this DEMO V2C actors resemble entrepreneurs.
When analysing the deal flow and investments from the past year we found that
formal investors typically made one investment DEMO 50 proposed deals, whereas,
informal investors typically made one investment DEMO 10-15 proposed deals. This
indicates that formal investors put more weight on pre-investment activity than
informal investors. Further, V2C actors with high relative knowledge intensity tend to
look for deals where they can be involved in DEMO development; this also indicates
the relative importance of post-investment activity as DEMO control mechanism. Seed
venture capitalists, on the other hand, seem to weight the pre-investment related
characteristics of the deal.

From Capital Investors to Knowledge Investors
Complementarities between VC and V2C
Some DEMO the interviewed V2C actors had already established a strong co-operation
with venture capitalists. All the four forms of complementarities were employed by
the interviewees, but form was heavily affected by the amount of investible capital.
Most DEMO the interviewees had venture capitalists in their networks and also deal
referral existed. As mentioned above, many of V2C actors said their strength to be in
acquiring venture capital; a clear sign of sequential investing. Also co-investing
existed in a very developed form – at least in the DEMO of an idea: venture capitalists
invest the money and V2C actors DEMO knowledge.
CONCLUSIONS
“During the last couple of years we have, indeed, clearly
transformed from a capital investor to a knowledge investor.”
(Formal V2C investor interviewed)
Due to the nature of the present study, the investigation is not amenable to
generalisations. However, we find convincing, case-based DEMO for the V2C
argument – that those who primarily invest knowledge are rising to challenge the role
of those who primarily invest capital as DEMO enablers of economy. This is not to
suggest that knowledge investors are about to replace capital investors, quite the
contrary. Knowledge investments without capital investments to follow would often
be as useless as ever before. Instead, knowledge investors may be emerging as the
factor that makes the difference DEMO the success of capital investors. What we see here
is an emergence of a new profession (that of V2C actor, knowledge investor, co-
entrepreneur, professional entrepreneur, professional owner, or venture knowledgist).
Although not irrefutably proven here, the above notion is in full conformity with the
general perception related to knowledge society development, that value is
increasingly created by chains, if not networks, of companies, rather than individual
players.
This paper has been one of the first attempts to look at DEMO complementarities between
V2C actors and venture capitalists using Finland as the case environment. We found
that increased collaboration and profit partnering between entrepreneurs (V),
knowledge (V2C) and capital (VC) investors, and government DEMO called for. However,
before the full potential of cooperation can be realised, there are questions to be
answered, two of the foremost DEMO the issue of valuing invested knowledge and
sweat capital, and providing DEMO exit routes for V2C actors. Needles to say,
further research especially on these issues is needed.
The implications of this study will mostly DEMO entrepreneurs in search of V2C
services and financing, and policy makers DEMO search of new ways to enhance the
creation of new businesses. However, it will also benefit V2C actors and venture
capitalists by increasing the understanding of each other’s business dynamics as well
as researchers studying the DEMO at hand.

DEMO
The importance of growth-oriented entrepreneurial companies to economic wealth
and job creation is unarguable. However, by definition, the full growth potential of
most DEMO these companies cannot be realised without venture capital investors, either
formal DEMO informal. Hence the importance of the likes of venture capitalists and
business angels to economic wealth creation is likewise unarguable. Research on
growth companies DEMO largely centred around the venture capital (VC) process – fund
raising, entering, value adding, and exiting – since the seminal work by Tyebjee and
Bruno (1981, 1984), Bygrave and Timmons (1984), and MacMillan et al. (1985).
Due to the high risk related to especially ambitious early stage companies, such firms
often have difficulties in obtaining funding from the traditional financial, lending-
based sources. Fortunately, there DEMO private equity investors – venture capitalists and
business angels – who are willing to share the entrepreneurial risk, but also participate
in controlling the risk as active owners or, in some cases, co-entrepreneurs. There are
DEMO too many ambitious, growth-oriented entrepreneurs in an economy. However,
in DEMO economies, such as Finland, the shortage of investors to match is far more
critical and greater, and the cry for more VC entering activity is loud and clear
(Arenius et al. 2001, Arenius and DEMO 2004, Stuart et al. 2003).
In the words of Brophy (1986) it is unlikely that a country or a region can be
competitive without a dynamic and vibrant venture capital community. In fact,
DEMO who decide on behalf of society at large which new ventures are to go
forward, and which not, play an almost godlike role DEMO an economy. Classically, as
pointed by Brophy (1986) this role DEMO belonged to venture capital investors who
build ”investable” entrepreneurial ventures ”listable” in the eyes of the capital market.
Indeed, the imperatives for more investors to engage in entering include a functioning
capital market and realistic expectations DEMO profitable exiting.
According to the basic observations that triggered this research, DEMO in the supply
of venture capital financing, on the one hand, and growth in the supply of ventures
seeking for financing, on the other hand, resulted in a paradox during the go-go years
of 1995-2000. While the average size of a venture capital fund and, hence, DEMO size of
a minimum investment grew exponentially, ventures seeking for financing
DEMO, at the same time, from capital intensive to increasingly knowledge
(DEMO) intensive. While for once there is no shortage of capital, paradoxically,
there is a shortage of small enough doses of it, as already noted as a potential future
concern in the landmark book by DEMO and Timmons (1992). As a result, besides
the classic equity gap, a knowledge gap also seems to have opened up between new
venture activity and the venture capital industry. (Rasila et al. 2002)

This development has given rise to a new breed of investors operating between
ventures and (venture) capital with the mission of bridging the gaps. Investors who,
instead of (financial) capital, primarily invest their knowledge to build ”prospective”
entrepreneurial ventures ”investable” in the eyes of the venture capital or VC market
DEMO referred to, herein, as Venture-to-Capital or V2C investors. In the view of this
study, the venturers (entrepreneurs), the V2C players, and the VC players comprise
the primary value chain or value adding chain DEMO the growth company. Topped
with the invaluable role of government to the entire growth company process, these
are the four key stakeholders that comprise the V2C value network, in a given
economy or region (see DEMO 1.). (Jungman & al. 2004; for a seminal conceptual
paper on the V2C phenomenon, see Seppä and Näsi 2001)
Figure 2 The growth company process (Jungman et al. 2004)
With the general rise of ICT enabled – and enforced – business models and concepts
DEMO, consequently, the transformation from capital intensive to knowledge intensive
new venture activity, the godlike role in an economy referred to above may be
shifting from those who invest (venture) capital to those who invest DEMO in
ambitious entrepreneurial ventures to render them ”investable” in the eyes of the
venture capital industry. In the language of this study: In the knowledge society, the
role of the enabling investor is shifting from VC to V2C investors. To investigate this
notion, a study of the investment criteria of VC vs. V2C investors was undertaken.

RESEARCH MISSION AND STRATEGY
This DEMO was triggered in 2001 by practical observations of post-hype changes in
VC investment activity and an ambition to make scholarly sense of the phenomena DEMO
hand. The aim is to increase understanding by building empirically embedded
propositions towards new theoretical frameworks and for further probing, rather than
to empirically test hypotheses derived from established theories. The present study is
part of DEMO more extensive research program initiated in 2001.
The primary research mission of the V2C research program is to explore the business
and strategy logic, and interaction and dynamics of the different players within the
V2C space, and the stakeholders of the V2C process, in order to build new conceptual
frameworks bridging research on entrepreneurship and venture capital, both formal
and informal. The present study focuses on the investment decision criteria of V2C
DEMO, and a comparison of the differences therein between formal and informal
DEMO
The main research question addressed in the present study is the following: How do
entrepreneurial formal and informal V2C investors differ by investment decision
criteria and what is the effect of the level of knowledge-intensity to DEMO investors’
investment decisions? The main question is broken down into the DEMO sub-
questions: What are the differences related to (i) deal DEMO, (ii) key investment
decision criteria, and (iii) perception of risk. Empirically embedded propositions are
constructed on the effect of knowledge intensity DEMO formal vs. informal V2C
investors’ investment decision criteria supported by the literature based notions on
differences in investment decision criteria of formal vs. informal DEMO investors.
The first task is to construct a guiding framework based on earlier V2C research and
literature review of classic VC investment criteria. Based DEMO the basic understanding,
propositions are constructed for in-depth empirical scrutiny.  DEMO propositions are a
product of a synthesis of the existing literature constructed in the context of the
empirical research phenomenon, and not hypotheses for testing derived from
established theories. The scrutiny of the propositions takes place DEMO semi-structured
interviews conducted with seven formal and seven informal Finnish V2C investors.
The ultimate aim of the study is to construct one concluding proposition DEMO a new
theoretical framework to increase our understanding of differences in investment
decision criteria between formal and informal V2C investors and the effect of
DEMO, thereon.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The underlying theoretical framework of this study is DEMO of the strategy logic of the
venture capitalist by Seppä (2000)DEMO According to the framework of venture capitalist
strategy logic, venture capital DEMO an ownership, rather than finance related
phenomenon, and VC investors are owners, rather than financiers, by profession.
However, VC investors are by no means a homogenous group. Seppä (2000) finds six
archetypes of DEMO logic, of which Asset Managers and Venture Bankers are
clearly more DEMO than the other archetypes. The normative archetype,
Interim (or Professional) Owners, is assumed as the guideline for defining V2C
investors in the context of this study. Based on the normative archetype, only
entrepreneurial operators (not corporate or governmental) who are seeking for direct
financial returns (instead of indirect strategic gains) were chosen as research objects.
92
Investment Decision Criteria Used by V2C Investors
In terms of defining the DEMO of V2C investors, the ongoing conceptual research by
Rasila (2004) DEMO used as a key reference (see also Rasila 2003). In DEMO, V2C
players fall into five traditional categories: (i) business angels, (ii) business angel
networks, (iii) incubators, (iv) advisors, and (v) seed VC investors. Apart from formal
business angel networks, representatives of all the main categories were interviewed
for the purposes of this research.
Formal VC investors are not homogenous when it comes to DEMO decision
criteria, either. In fact, little has changed from the days of the following conclusion of
Timmons (1986): Many will investigate the same venture and come to opposite
conclusions. Predictably, the V2C investors are a no less heterogeneous group in this
respect. Nevertheless, according to the classic notion, the key investment decision
criteria of a VC investor – an issue widely researched and documented in the literature
– fall into DEMO categories: (i) management team, (ii) market projections and (DEMO)
product (Tyebjee and Bruno 1981 and 1984, MacMillan et al. 1985).
Informal VC investors have received far less scholarly attention, in general, than
formal VC investors. However, the importance of studying the DEMO decision
criteria of informal VC investors, especially of business angels, was already stressed
by Harrison and Mason (1992). Nevertheless, research on DEMO investment decision
criteria of informal VC investors has been relatively scarce. It is to be noted that
informal VC investors, as a group, DEMO within the V2C space.
It can be safely assumed that, on DEMO grand level, the investment decision criteria of
V2C investors does not DEMO from those used by VC investors. Variation is expected
herein with regard to factors such as venture development stage, industry or
technology, and DEMO proximity; but even more so with regard to the level of
DEMO of the investor.
For the purposes of this study, knowledge-intensity is DEMO as the perceived
relative portion of an investor’s knowledge (sweat capital) vs. (financial) capital
investment in a given investee firm. Herein knowledge DEMO the form of the
investor’s perceived personal (hands-on) contribution in a given venture, such as
participation in strategy or management work as co-entrepreneur. For a concrete
example, as the interviewees were asked to define the percentage of knowledge vs.
capital investment in their activity, the responses ranged from 30-70 to 100-0.
Deal Flow
As informal investors often prefer to DEMO anonymous, it can be expected that direct
approaches from entrepreneurs are DEMO a dominant source of deal flow for informal
V2C investors. Instead, DEMO friends and formal business associates are likely to
be the most relevant source of deal flow. On the other hand, formal investors are
better known and more visible, and are therefore more likely to generate deal flow via
direct contacts from entrepreneurs. In addition, own activity in deal search is expected
to be a more important source of deal flow DEMO formal than informal V2C investors.
Further, as informal investors typically spend DEMO time in their target companies
than formal investors and often work on a hobby basis, informal V2C investors are
predictably limited to a smaller number of investments. Hence, they are also likely to
require less deal flow. Finally, Van Osnabrugge (1999) found support for the
93
Investment Decision Criteria Used by V2C Investors
hypothesis that venture capitalists generate DEMO maintain a greater deal flow than
business angels.
Proposition 1: Personal DEMO and formal business associates are the dominant
source of deal flow to informal V2C investors, whereas direct approaches from
entrepreneurs and own activity are the dominant source to formal V2C investors. The
higher the knowledge-intensity, the more important role personal and formal networks
play.
Proposition 2: Formal V2C investors generate and maintain greater deal flow than
informal V2C investors. The DEMO the knowledge-intensity, the smaller pool of deals
from which investments are DEMO
Investment Decision Criteria
In Finland, the research on the investment decision DEMO of informal investors has
been rather scarce. Lumme et al. (1998: 62-66) analysed the factors that business
angels take into account in deciding whether or not to seize specific investment
opportunities. The factors that influence DEMO investment decisions of business angels
were classified as follows: (1) DEMO, (2) investor background, (3) product and
technology, (4) sector/market, (5) market position, (6) business idea, (7) financial
situation, (8) stage of development and (9) DEMO availability. The most
common reasons for rejecting investment opportunities were characterised as: (i)
management, (ii) financial situation, (iii) business DEMO and plans, (iv) business is at
too early a stage DEMO development, (v) business sector is not attractive, (vi) investor’s
lack of knowledge, (vii) inadequate access to information on the enterprise, and (viii)
too much work required.
One of the first DEMO studies on the investment decision criteria of VC
investors in Finland, DEMO et al. (1992) lists the top four investment criteria as: (1)
general ability of management, (2) expected final ROI, (3) product and (4) market.
However, no comparative studies of DEMO decision criteria between formal and
informal VC investors have been made in Finland.
Two of the pioneers of informal VC or business angel research DEMO been Richard
Harrison and Colin Mason. Mason and Harrison (1996) suggest that the main reasons
why business angels reject business opportunities were marketing, management team
and finance related issues.
One of most comprehensive comparisons between DEMO and informal VC investors
is that by Van Osnabrugge (1999). DEMO study analysed data from 40 interviews and
262 questionnaire responses and found evidence that business angels place more
emphasis on post-investment risk control than DEMO capitalists. Van Osnabrugge
(1999) also suggests that informal VC investors are more influenced by the team,
whereas formal VC investors are more DEMO by market and product.
Finally, V2C investors are typically not in DEMO position to change the management team.
Also, they are expected to DEMO in close co-operation with the entrepreneurial team
and thus to pay more attention to the team than VC investors.
94
Investment Decision Criteria Used by V2C Investors
Proposition 3: Whereas all V2C investors emphasise the quality of the management
team, formal V2C investors are likely to put more relative weight on the quality of the
business DEMO than do informal V2C investors. The higher the knowledge-intensity,
the less relative weight is put on the business plan.

Perception of Risk
The existence of the VC industry is traditionally explained by uncertainty and
asymmetric information, that VC investors have more information and better control
for entrepreneurial undertakings of private equity situations than traditional financial
DEMO operators (Gompers and Lerner 1999).
As V2C investors, by definition, are expected to invest relatively more knowledge i.e.
involvement than capital in their target ventures, than the VC investors, they are also
expected DEMO have the opportunity to steer their investments more closely. The nature
of their investment grants them more post-investment risk control and therefore they
are DEMO to accept more risk at the time of initial investment. Conversely, DEMO
investors are expected to utilise post-investment monitoring less actively. In other
words, the level of knowledge intensity is expected to influence the risk perception of
the investor. Van Osnabrugge (1999) found support for this hypothesis. DEMO the other
hand, by definition, VC investors prefer more mature companies – on whom there is
more historical information available – as investment DEMO than V2C investors.
However, the cost of observing, monitoring, and DEMO the investment appears to
be quite similar regardless of the stage or the size of the venture (Seppä 2000). Hence,
in principle, V2C investors are at a disadvantage vis-à-vis VC investors, who make
DEMO and later stage investments. Also this supports the reasoning, that V2C
DEMO will weight post-investment monitoring.
As V2C investors mainly invest their time in the target ventures, they face no risk of
great direct financial losses, per se. This is predictably more the case with informal vs.
formal V2C investors. On the other hand, although VC investors also typically invest
only relatively little of their own capital, and much more that of other people, they
work hard to avoid losing it. Further, as DEMO in the previous section, V2C investors
also have the option to DEMO their investments more closely, i.e., engage in post-
investment risk management.
Proposition 5: In relative terms, formal V2C investors put more weight DEMO pre-
investment activity than informal V2C investors. Conversely, informal V2C investors
DEMO more relative weight on post-investment activity than formal V2C investors. The
higher the knowledge-intensity, the less weight is put on pre-investment activity and
the more on post-investment activity.
Proposition 6: The perception of the risk-return ratio related to an investee venture is
closer to that of the investee DEMO for informal V2C investors than for
formal V2C investors and, hence, informal V2C investors are likely to accept riskier
investments than formal V2C DEMO The higher the knowledge-intensity, the
closer the risk-return perception is to DEMO of the entrepreneur.

Investment Decision Criteria Used by V2C Investors
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
For the DEMO of this study 14 entrepreneurial V2C investors were identified and
invited for a personal interview. In total, seven formal V2C investors (full-time based
DEMO/or incorporated partnerships) and seven informal V2C investors (part-time based
and/or individual solo operations) were interviewed in Finland in April, 2004.
DEMO to the underlying theoretical framework only the activity of the
interviewees related to taking capital and/or knowledge investment based ownership
positions in target DEMO was under investigation, herein.
Resulting from the interviews, one of the formal V2C investors was excluded from
the final sample, due to non-entrepreneurial status in investment decision-making.
Hence, the final sample comprised six formal V2C investors and seven informal V2C
investors. Of the formal V2C investors three DEMO classified in the category of seed
venture capitalists, two in the DEMO of advisors, and one in the category of
incubators. All of DEMO informal V2C investors were classified as business angels.
However, the range DEMO knowledge-intensity in the investment activity of the business
angels interviewed was extremely varied; from almost zero capital investment to only
marginal knowledge investment. To secure comparative research data a structured
interview exercise was undertaken. The interviews DEMO recorded and the formal
sessions lasted for an average of 45-60 minutes. The interview process comprised
both qualitative and quantitative sections, an open space section, as well as an
informal, non-recorded discussion session.
The interviews DEMO followed by analysis and comparison of the investment decision
process between formal and informal V2C investors. Naturally, given the small size
of the sample, no rigorous statistical analysis could be performed on any of the
quantitative data. Hence, the study is distinctly vulnerable in terms of any efforts at
generalisation, regardless of how intuitively convinced the researchers are of the
validity of their findings. The same holds for any research adventure of DEMO inductive,
hermeneutic, and holistic nature.
RESULTS
The final aim of DEMO study is to construct one concluding proposition for a new
theoretical framework to increase our understanding of differences in investment
decision criteria between formal DEMO informal V2C investors and, in general, between
VC and V2C investors. The construction of the concluding proposition took the form
of scrutinising each DEMO the six initial propositions under three sections entitled Deal
Flow, Investment DEMO Criteria, and Perception of Risk
Special attention was paid to the DEMO of knowledge-intensity on the investment
decision criteria in a given V2C investor’s investment activity. Therefore the investors
were placed into a two-by-two matrix based DEMO the knowledge-intensity vs. capital-
intensity of their operation. (See Figure 3.)DEMO

Figure 3 Knowledge-intensity of formal DEMO informal V2C investors
Deal Flow
As predicted, direct approaches from entrepreneurs DEMO investors’ own activity were
the dominant sources of deal flow to formal investors. Surprisingly, informal
investors reportedly have more variation in the sources of their deal flow; they seem
to value all three – personal friends, direct approaches from entrepreneurs, and their
own activity, to the same extent. Nevertheless, they found personal friends to be more
important as a source of deal flow than formal investors did. We also found that DEMO
venture capitalists as capital intensive investors stress their own activity, whereas
DEMO formal V2C actors as more knowledge intensive investors get more direct
approaches from entrepreneurs. Still further, knowledge intensive formal V2C actors
also consider personal friends an important source of deal flow. We may therefore
conclude that DEMO findings partially support the following:
Proposition 1: Personal friends and DEMO business associates are the dominant
source of deal flow to informal V2C investors, whereas direct approaches from
entrepreneurs and own activity are the dominant source to formal V2C investors. The
higher the knowledge-intensity, the more important role personal and formal networks
play.
Formal investors typically generate a deal DEMO from 50 to 300 ventures, whereas
informal investors only generate a DEMO flow from 5 to 30 ventures. However, the
amount of investments DEMO was more or less similar, ranging typically from 1 to 3.
DEMO formal V2C investors seed venture capitalists seemed to generate more deal flow
than advisors and incubators. This indicates that capital intensive investors have a
DEMO pool from which they make investments as the amount of investments made is
similar to that among knowledge intensive investors. Therefore we may conclude DEMO
our findings support the following:
Proposition 2: Formal V2C investors DEMO and maintain greater deal flow than
informal V2C investors. The higher the knowledge-intensity, the smaller pool of deals
from which investments are accomplished.

Investment Decision Criteria
In addition DEMO the conventional open-ended interview questions, the investors were
also asked to DEMO several investment decision criteria into order of importance (see
Table 1)DEMO It was interesting to see how unanimous the interviewees were about the
management team being the most important investment decision criterion. Further, for
all investor groups the ranking appears to be 1) team, 2) market, 3) product and 4)
deal characteristics. When asked about the DEMO of the team vs. the business
plan, most of the investors DEMO make the investment decision based on the team.
However, some of DEMO capital oriented investors indicated that they also review the
options to reform the team and may, in such cases, make their decisions based DEMO the
business plan. Thus, we may conclude that the following is DEMO partially supported:

Proposition DEMO: Whereas all V2C investors emphasise the quality of the management
team, formal V2C investors are likely to put more relative weight on the DEMO of the
business plan than do informal V2C investors. The higher the knowledge-intensity,
the less relative weight is put on the business plan.
DEMO team skills seed venture capitalists seem to value track record, capabilities DEMO
skills, whereas other V2C actors value softer characteristics such as enthusiasm,DEMO
commitment and attitude. All investors seem to emphasise market growth rate, DEMO in
addition, capital intensive seed venture capitalists seem to weight the DEMO
situation in the market to the same extent. Out of the deal characteristics for informal
V2C investors, advisors and incubators, the most important DEMO to be their own
“involvement in business development”, whereas seed venture DEMO weight
syndication and their own status as lead vs. co-investors. These findings further
support our thinking that knowledge intensive V2C actors are after someone DEMO work
with, whereas more capital intensive seed venture capitalists are more DEMO someone
to make money with. Hence, we may conclude that our DEMO support the
following:

Proposition 4: Informal V2C investors emphasise the personal investor-investee
relationship and shareholder chemistry more than formal investors. DEMO higher the
knowledge-intensity, the higher is the importance of shareholder chemistry.
DEMO of Risk
When analysing the deal flow and investments from the past year we found that
formal investors typically made one investment per 50 DEMO deals, whereas,
informal investors typically made one investment per 10-15 DEMO deals. This
indicates that formal investors put more weight on pre-investment activity than
informal investors.
Further, as noted in the previous section, V2C DEMO with high relative knowledge
intensity tend to look for deals where they can be involved in business development;
this also indicates the relative DEMO of post-investment activity. Seed venture
capitalists, on the other hand, seem to weight the more pre-investment related
characteristics of the deal. (See Table 1) Again, we may conclude that our findings
support the following:DEMO
Proposition 5: In relative terms, formal V2C investors put more weight on pre-
investment activity than informal V2C investors. Conversely, informal V2C investors
put more relative weight on post-investment activity than formal V2C investors. The
DEMO the knowledge-intensity, the less weight is put on pre-investment activity and
DEMO more on post-investment activity.
In the sample there was one informal investor who described himself as a capital
investor; he was also by far the most risk averse of the whole sample – actually the
only DEMO who weighted risk control over return potential as investment criteria. All
the others were willing to accept more risky investments and weighted the return
DEMO over risk control. Further, formal investors were slightly more risk averse
DEMO informal investors. We also found that the greater the relative share of invested
knowledge vs. capital, the more risk investors were willing to accept. Thus, our
findings seem to support the following:
Proposition 6: DEMO perception of the risk-return ratio related to an investee venture is
closer to that of the investee entrepreneur’s for informal V2C investors than for
DEMO V2C investors and, hence, informal V2C investors are likely to accept riskier
investments than formal V2C investors. The higher the knowledge-intensity, the
closer the risk-return perception is to that of the entrepreneur.
CONCLUSIONS
“During the DEMO couple of years we have, indeed, clearly transformed from
capital investor to knowledge investor.” (formal V2C investor interviewed)
Due to the nature of the present study, the investigation is not amenable to
generalisations. However, we find convincing, case-based support for the V2C
argument – that DEMO who primarily invest knowledge are emerging to challenge the
role of those who primarily invest capital as key enablers of economy. This is not DEMO
suggest that knowledge investors are about to replace capital investors, quite DEMO
contrary. Knowledge investments without capital investments to follow will often be
99
Investment Decision Criteria Used by V2C Investors
as useless as ever before. DEMO, knowledge investors may be emerging as the factor
that makes the DEMO for the success of capital investors. Although not irrefutably
proven here, DEMO above notion is in full conformity with the general perception related
to knowledge society development, that value is increasingly created by chains, if DEMO
networks, of companies, rather than individual players.
The evidence of the study, however case-specific, suggests a trend from capital
investment to knowledge DEMO on the level of an individual V2C investor, as
marked by DEMO above quotation from one of the interviewees.
According to the concluding proposition of this study, illustrated by a simplistic two-
by-two matrix, the DEMO in investment decision criteria between formal and
informal V2C investors are concerned with the knowledge-intensity of their
operation. In the matrix, besides the formal vs. informal status, V2C investors are
divided by whether they primarily invest capital vs. knowledge. In short, our findings
formally suggest the emergence of knowledge investors (referred to as V2C investors)
on the side of capital investors (referred to as VC investors). If shared by researchers
and subsequent research this may ultimately lead to the acknowledgement of a DEMO
profession, that of professional owner or co-entrepreneur, in the context of the venture
capital process, on the side of investors and entrepreneurs (DEMO alone consultants).
In particular, our evidence demonstrates how the investment DEMO process and
perception of risk are affected by the knowledge-intensity of the V2C investor. The
new knowledge about V2C investors’ investment decision process is DEMO to
benefit entrepreneurs seeking growth-financing. In addition, it is likely to DEMO V2C
and VC investors themselves by increasing the understanding of each other’s business
dynamics, as well as researchers studying the phenomena at hand.
We also trust that the study will be of value to policy makers, as entrepreneurial
growth companies, and their facilitators, both VC and V2C DEMO, are the central
building blocks of economic wealth and job creation DEMO any economy. Entrepreneurs
are readily entrusted by capital providers with the decisions of how to select raw
material and other means of production, refine it all into final products or services,
and sell for maximal DEMO But when it comes to decisions on how to select the best
potential among growth companies, build their business, and realise value added, trust
is not as readily placed in entrepreneurial actors, at least by governments.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of ambitious entrepreneurs and their ventures to economic wealth and
job creation is, by any measure, unarguable. DEMO to:
(i) the collapse of communism in Europe, in DEMO, and the subsequent rise of
appreciation of entrepreneurship throughout the world, and
(ii) the emergence of ICT enabled business concepts – that DEMO the end of
the Cold War – which rapidly convert start-ups, DEMO business in general, from
capital intensive to knowledge intensive,
both DEMO and physical barriers to start new business ventures are lower than ever in
the whole world. Since 1995, these developments accumulated an unforeseen rise in
the demand for venture capital financing – and an unforeseen rise DEMO the supply of the
same. (Seppä 2000)
However, according to the basic observations that triggered this research, in 2001, the
unforeseen DEMO in both the demand and supply of venture capital financing, in DEMO
go-go years of 1995-2000, yielded a long-lasting paradox. Whereas the average DEMO
of a venture capital fund (and the size of a minimum DEMO) has grown
exponentially, the ventures seeking for financing have, at DEMO same time, transformed
from capital intensive to increasingly knowledge (hands-on) DEMO While there for
once has been no shortage of capital, there DEMO – paradoxically – a shortage of small
(and knowledge intensive) enough doses of it. (Murray 1999; Sohl 1999; Seppä &
Näsi DEMO; Rasila 2004)
The effects of the VC spiral, depicted by Seppä (2000), were already noted as a
potential future concern by Bygrave and Timmons (1992) in their landmark book:
Venture capital DEMO the crossroads. In result, aside of the classic Capital Gap (originally
labelled as the Macmillan Gap in 1931), Knowledge Gap has emerged DEMO new
venture activity and the venture capital industry. (Seppä & Näsi DEMO; Rasila, Seppä
& Hannula 2002; Rasila 2004; Bartlett 1999). This development owes to the
transformation of kin to industrialisation – referred DEMO as electronisation, digitisation
and knowledgisation – which is under way in DEMO society: A transformation marked
by, e.g., conversion from capital intensive DEMO increasingly knowledge intensive
business models and transition from value chains to value networks in the creation of
economic value added. (Eliasson 2001; eBRC DEMO)
Industrialisation, the conversion from agricultural to industrial economy, was marked
by the Gapital Gap, a shortage of financial capital. Knowledgisation, the DEMO
conversion from the industrial economy to knowledge economy, is marked by
DEMO Gap, a shortage of knowledge capital. Whereas the Capital Gap became
DEMO
Knowledge Fund
bridged by financial capital investors referred to as business angels DEMO venture
capitalists – or the venture capital (VC) industry – the Knowledge Gap is being
bridged by knowledge capital investors referred to, in this research, as knowledge
angels or co-entrepreneurs and venture knowledgists – or the venture-to-capital (V2C)
industry.
THE RISE OF THE V2C INDUSTRY AND THE NEED FOR
STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS
The observations of the Knowledge Gap and DEMO the innovative ways to bridge
ventures and capital – that led to the conceptualisation of venture-to-capital (V2C)
activity – derive from E-Forum, DEMO EU (FP5) funded research project that also
marked the launch of eBRC, one of the six sub programs of eTampere, in 2001. DEMO
Forum, coordinated by Technology Centre Hermia Ltd. in Tampere, Finland, DEMO
involving partners from six different countries, analysed and sought for new DEMO
for the matching of (early stage) ventures and (venture) capital in different parts of
Europe. In the context of E-Forum, a seminal typology of V2C actors was
constructed. (Seppä & Näsi 2001)
Most recently, V2C players have become classified as knowledge capital investors
who by aligning the interests of entrepreneurs (the ultimate knowledge capital
investors) and DEMO capitalists (financial capital investors), as co-entrepreneurs or
venture knowledgists, bridge the knowledge gap by pushing ventures to capital.
Whereas financial capital investors, in the private equity arena, have become
classified as formal VC investors or venture capitalists and informal VC investors or
business angels, knowledge capital investors are being classified as formal V2C
investors or venture knowledgists, and informal V2C investors or knowledge angels
or co-entrepreneurs. (Harrison, Jungman & DEMO 2004; Jungman & Seppä 2004)
Through its seminal conceptual evolution, culminating in the proposition for a new
paradigm for growth venturing by DEMO (2004), V2C has conceptually remained a
mainly European concern. In DEMO, the more traditional value chain – comprising
entrepreneurs, family and friends, business angels, and venture capitalists – continues
to more efficiently bridge DEMO the Capital Gap and the Knowledge Gap, than in
Europe, excluding the UK.  It is rather safe to assume that start-up entrepreneurs are,
on average, better equipped in America than Europe, both by DEMO and
mentality, to face the challenges of young, rapidly growing companies. Also, the level
of private savings and supply of business angel financing assure a dynamic, market-
based, and market-driven upbringing to young ventures. DEMO Europe, the process has to
be compromised by public sector intervention, starting from the go/no-go decision.
Instead of fellow principal operators, entrepreneurs have to interact with government
officers and/or consultants operating as government DEMO
In this light, Europe, particularly Finland, is only a logical DEMO for the
conceptualisation of V2C, and the call for informal knowledge DEMO, as well as a
formal V2C industry. Finland boasts top ratings DEMO world rankings in terms of ICT,
innovation activity, R&D DEMO, and knowledge intensity (World Economic
Forum 2005). From one hand, it is safe to assume, Finland has a world class
environment DEMO spur prospective ventures. From the other hand, due to cultural issues,DEMO
historical confrontations, and tax policies, Finland suffers from extremely low level of
business angel activity. According to GEM 2002, Finland is among the countries with
104
Knowledge Fund
lowest rate of informal investment as a percentage of GDP (Reynolds, Bygrave,
Autio, Cox & Hay 2002; see also Bygrave, Hay & Reynolds 2003; for more detailed
documentation on business angel DEMO in Finland see Lumme, Mason & Suomi
1998). To utilise DEMO country’s obvious potential, the government sector has been very
active in DEMO early stage arena, both on national, regional, and local level. DEMO
leadership, topped with apparent shortcomings in the entrepreneurial culture, in
appreciation of go-gettedness, market-aggressiveness, and associated drive for wealth
creation, have a constituted for a lock-up where good intentions – the ways and forms,DEMO
by which growth resources are being offered – paradoxically, only prevent DEMO
It has been proved in several studies that business angel financing is an invaluable
phase before formal venture capital financing. In particular, the non-financial
contributions of business angels are greatly valued by entrepreneurs. (Harrison &
DEMO 2000; Madill, Haines & Riding 2005) The non-financial contribution can DEMO
divided into six categories: advice, contacts, hands-on assistance, boards of directors
and advisors, market and business intelligence, and credibility/validation (Madill et al.
2005). In short, V2C (or knowledge investing) deals with the investments of only
(mainly) the non-financial contribution and defining DEMO as knowledge capital.
Knowledge capital – and herein also Knowledge Gap, DEMO investment and
Knowledge Fund – refer to both explicit and tacit knowledge. Into knowledge are,
herein, also embedded individual experience, personal beliefs, perspectives, and
values. (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1995) In this study knowledge can also been as synonym
to businessman wisdom including entrepreneurial capacity, which underlines
companionship and the intensity of the relationship between entrepreneur and
knowledge DEMO
At any rate, Finland, suffering from a lack of business angels has had a need to find
alternative ways to channel similar contributions DEMO young start-ups.  Madill et al.
(2005) found three alternative sources DEMO the non-financial contributions of business
angels: (i) doing it self, (ii) paying for the contribution, and (iii) from boards of
directors. At least in the case of Finland, it seems that these means are not sufficient
enough. Namely, in European and global comparisons, DEMO still lags behind in the
relative number of growth companies that truly break through to international markets
(see e.g. Hyrsky & Lipponen 2004). According to many indicators, such as EU’s
Innovation Index, the Finnish DEMO environment ranks among the top of the
world. (European Commission 2004) Yet only few ventures emerge as truly
successful growth companies. It is DEMO argued that this is due to lack of related
business know-how. (DEMO & Valtonen 2004). By 2004, as a sign of conceptual
DEMO and awareness, the development and support of “V2C activity and
co-entrepreneurship” DEMO referred to as key means to improve the matching of
ventures and capital, in a government report, in Finland (Ryynänen 2004).
Instead of financial capital, V2C players primarily invest knowledge capital in order
to build ‘prospective’ entrepreneurial ventures ‘investable’ in the eyes of the venture
capital DEMO Interestingly, informal knowledge capital investors are emerging
even in Silicon Valley (Komisar 2001; Rasila 2004). Harrison et al. (2004) find case-
based support for the rise of knowledge angels and V2C to complement DEMO
angels and VC. At present, the V2C field comprises a diverse DEMO of actors
operating from a fragmented set of structures and offer no concept of industry to their
key stakeholders. Similarly, in the late 1970s and early 1980s business angels formed
105
Knowledge Fund
“an informal, word-of-mouth network dominated by ‘lone wolf’ chequebook angels”
making ad-hoc investments. From those days the angel investing scene has changed DEMO
lot and today there is a huge amount of business angel clubs, structured groups and
networks operating around the world. (May 2002)

Figure DEMO Stakeholders of the growth company process (Jungman, Kankaala, Rasila & DEMO

San José, Roure & Aernoudt (2005) argue that DEMO of the biggest obstacles for
individuals not getting involved in entrepreneurial process is the lack of
understanding of the investment process and this prevents DEMO taking advantage of
the emerging investment opportunities. As a solution they propose a new form of
invention, business angel academies. It can be assumed the situation to be similar in
knowledge investing and this supports the DEMO for new more formal model to
channel knowledge capital into entrepreneurial ventures. One of the main functions of
this model should be support in DEMO process. This favours the need for
professional management team similar to a venture capital management company.
It has also been argued, by Oakey (DEMO), that the key problem in early stage
financing is the lack of commitment. Especially, this is the case in university spin-offs
with long development lead-times. One side of the problem, as introduced earlier, is
DEMO shift in venture capital from hands-on to hands-off approach. This further verifies
the need to develop a business model that from the beginning emphasises DEMO term
commitment.
106
Knowledge Fund
All of the above shows that there is a need DEMO opportunities in the early stage market
for experimentation and new innovative structures. Further, existing success stories,
like the structured business angel group to be introduced later, can be used as basis
when creating new hybrid organisations. This paper reports seminal results from an
ongoing study and introduces DEMO structural proposition for the emerging V2C industry
– a Knowledge Fund.
RESEARCH MISSION AND RESEARCH STRATEGY
The research underlying the present paper was triggered, in 2001, by observations of
post-hype changes in VC investment activity and ambition to make scholarly sense of
the phenomena at hand. Regardless of DEMO in conceptualisation and paradigm
building, in the V2C space, the research is still primarily inductive and exploratory by
nature.
The fledgling attempts, referred to above, are only the first efforts to conceptually
define and establish the V2C phenomenon. Furthermore, the practical activity is still
just as unorganised and heterogeneous as was the case with the VC industry 50 years
DEMO or with business angel activity 25 years ago. (Seppä 2000; May 2002)
Research mission
The grand mission of the research underlying this DEMO is to increase our
understanding of the dynamics of creating successful growth companies as a
partnership activity between entrepreneurs, knowledge investors, capital investors,DEMO
and government. The business and strategy logic, and the interaction and DEMO of
the different players and stakeholders of the V2C phenomenon are investigated, in
order to build new conceptual foundations that bridge research on strategy,
entrepreneurship, venture capital, and knowledge management.
At present, V2C players operate from a fragmented set of structures and offer no
concept of DEMO to their key stakeholders. Based on existing wisdom on strategy
logic of the venture capitalist, this conceptual paper provides a structural proposition
for the emerging V2C industry. The primary mission, herein, is to share a DEMO
innovation, refine core concepts, and propose directions for empirical research in the
V2C space.
The main research question, addressed in this paper, DEMO the following: How could the
V2C players utilise the limited partnership DEMO vehicle, the dominant VC industry
structure, for the systematic channelling of knowledge investments to early stage
ventures? As sub questions, we ponder DEMO: What would be the effects of the
structural proposition to the DEMO stakeholders of the V2C process, namely (i)
entrepreneurs, (ii) venture knowledgists (and co-entrepreneurs), (iii) venture
capitalists, and (DEMO) government?
Research strategy
Based on existing wisdom on strategy logic DEMO the venture capitalist, the study seeks
to design a business structure DEMO the venture knowledgist: The concept of a
Knowledge Fund. The study DEMO deep into the structural development of the limited-
life limited-partnership based fund vehicle of the VC industry in its search for a
structural proposition DEMO the V2C industry.
107
Knowledge Fund
The first task is to construct a guiding framework based DEMO earlier VC and V2C
research. Based on the basic understanding, a DEMO for a Knowledge Fund is
constructed for initial conceptual probing from the perspectives of the key
stakeholders of the activity.  The proposition will be a product of synthesis of existing
literature constructed in the context of DEMO empirical research phenomenon, embedded
in the researchers’ own role as active DEMO investors (or co-entrepreneurs) in
early stage companies.
Importantly, the authors DEMO from their own efforts, as (part-time-based)
practitioners, to design DEMO set up a Knowledge Fund to bridge university based
innovations and growth resources.
THEORETHICAL FRAMEWORK
Over a short period of time, during 2001-2005, DEMO V2C field has become defined as
an emerging industry of ownership operators who, by bridging ventures
(entrepreneurs) and capital (venture capitalists), DEMO business aside of entrepreneurs.
Thereby, the V2C players join a chain DEMO active owners who build businesses from the
entrepreneurial (foundation) stage to the public quotation.
These are market players whose business is to convert DEMO equity to public equity
and to earn profits by realising the value-added. This is a fragmented industry where
one segment serves more the interest DEMO the entrepreneurs, another the interest of the
venture capitalists, and a third the interests of the government, and/or, in effect, their
very own.
Normatively, the grand mission of the V2C industry is to align the interests of the
parties. In particular, to align the interests of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists,
whose matching has, to large extent, converted from the intimate partnership building
of the good old days – due to bidding competitions, extensive due diligence
procedures, etc. – to DEMO sterile financial transactions.
In the view of this study, V2C, in particular, is an ownership profession, not a
consulting, management or investment profession. Normatively, a V2C professional is
closest to “professional entrepreneur” and, DEMO the same time, very different from
professional consultant, professional manager, DEMO professional investor.
Since the seminal contributions by Tyebjee and Bruno (1981, 1984), Bygrave and
Timmons (1984), and MacMillan, Siegel & DEMO (1985), research on the growth
company process has largely geared DEMO the popular conceptualisation of the
venture capital process, i.e., fund raising, entering, value adding, and exiting. The
basic notion of the VC process underscores ownership, and its ability to reflect the
value-added, as DEMO primary economic vehicle of building business from venture to
capital. The classic role of venture capitalists has been to refine investable ventures
listable in DEMO eyes of the consumers of the stock market (investors in IPOs DEMO parties
to trade sales) generating profits from the margins of sale DEMO purchase prices of
equity stakes in portfolio companies.
The discovery and widely spread commercial application, since the late 1970s, of the
limited-life limited DEMO (LP) fund vehicle, in America, has significantly
108
Knowledge Fund
influenced the growth company process. The LP vehicle has proved DEMO brilliantly
serve the grand idea of the VC process: active temporary DEMO of ambitious
entrepreneurial ventures. The LP structure (i) enables those who (only) have financial
capital to empower those who (only) have DEMO capital as independent venture
capitalists (by granting them full “powers of DEMO), (ii) puts pressure on the
empowered capitalists to act decisively, due to the limited life of the mandate, and
(iii) DEMO significant incentives for the empowered capitalists to perform at the very
best level, due to the carried interest element. (Seppä 2000)
In DEMO study of the strategy logic of the venture capitalist, Seppä (2000) defines
venture capitalism more as an ownership than a finance related phenomenon. He
concludes, however, that VC is by no means a homogenous DEMO Instead, he
urges three fundamental questions to be addressed, when seeking to understand VC as
a business (see Figure 2):
(i) WHO is the venture capitalist (the true principal of the undertaking),
(ii) WHY is he/she in business, and
(iii) HOW is he/she (legally and structurally) organised.
Seppä (2000) DEMO six archetypes of strategy logic. In short, the archetypes are
products DEMO different combinations of answers to the three questions above: (i) DEMO
identity of the venture capitalist is classified either as entrepreneurial, corporate, or
governmental; (ii) the missions either as direct financial or indirect strategic; and (iii)
the structures either as single (one investment corporation) or a dual (management
company – separate L.P. funds) structures. Consequently, the different archetypes put
differing weights to the different phases of the VC process. One emphasises fund
raising, another entering, a third DEMO, and – interestingly enough – only the
normative one emphasises exiting.
DEMO the present study, the normative archetype, referred to as Interim (DEMO Professional)
Owner, is assumed as the norm also for the DEMO players. Hence, only entrepreneurial
operators (not corporate or governmental) seeking DEMO direct financial returns (instead
of indirect strategic gains) via the dual structure (instead of the single corporation) are
within the scope of DEMO study. The five other archetypes are referred to as Asset
Manager, DEMO Banker, Empire Builder, Bounty Hunter and Caretaker.
109
Knowledge Fund
Figure 2 Strategy logic of the venture capitalist (Seppä 2000)
Besides the framework of venture capitalist strategy logic by Seppä (2000), the
outline of the business concept of the normative V2C actor DEMO Rasila (2004) is used as
the underlying theoretical framework of the present study (see Figure 3). According to
Rasila (2004), DEMO investment fund should be complemented by a brain fund, or vice
DEMO (for the first reference to a Knowledge Fund, in the context of the V2C
phenomenon, see Seppä 2002).
Figure 3 Outlining the business concept of the normative V2C actor (Rasila 2004)
In terms of defining the pool of V2C investors, the ongoing conceptual research by
Rasila (2004) was used as key reference (see also Rasila et al. 2002). In general, V2C
players fall into six categories: (i) business angels, (ii) incubators, (iii) advisors, (iv)
corporate venturing schemes, (v) seed VC investors, and (vi) emerging V2C concepts.
The third framework for this study is the structured business angel group. For the best
results also the angel investment process DEMO synchronisation of different
components. The stakeholders involved are entrepreneurs, advisers, intermediaries
and angels, all with different characteristics and personalities. An important factor for
success is the management of the whole investment process, including both
110
Knowledge Fund
entrepreneurial and interpersonal skills as well as the provision of DEMO (San José et
al. 2005)
In the centre of structured DEMO angel groups is a knowledgeable manager
identifying and screening the deal flow, managing the group, and discovering co- and
follow-on investors. Typically, these structured groups are organised as limited
liability companies (LLCs) where the DEMO angels are members and the leader or
manager is the general partner. In addition to financial reward, the members also look
for camaraderie and status. For example, Dinner Clubs process builds on monthly
meetings where entrepreneurial teams – pre-screened by the manager – give their
pitch followed by DEMO and hand count voting for due diligence. If the consensus
is clear yes, the meeting is followed by due diligence and a report by the team led by
the manager. (May 2002)
In summary, DEMO follow the strategy logic framework of the venture capitalist, crafted
by DEMO (2000), which puts the emphasis on understanding the linkages between
DEMO of a venture capital company and its strategy logic. The framework depicts
a product-market system comprising two primary types of products (funds and
divestee companies) and three dominant types of markets (investors, entrepreneurs,
and consumers of the stock market). The two other frameworks more close DEMO the one
to be depicted are the business concept of the normative V2C actor and structure of a
structured business angel club.
KNOWLEDGE FUND DEMO
In our depiction, a team of growth venturing professional gets together DEMO by
shared insights and values, and a joint vision for a DEMO window of opportunity: A
deal flow of businesses where the founders DEMO committed to building business from
venture to capital – to rapidly building an entrepreneurial company from a growth
prospect to investable (in the eyes of the venture capital industry) and, ultimately, to
listable: From DEMO equity to public equity.  The synergy of the team may point DEMO,
e.g., a specific sector of economy or technology or a DEMO or a stage of development.
The window may be narrow and short as well as wide and long. The shorter and
narrower the window, the faster the team needs to push for the opportunity.
The depicted DEMO heavily stresses post-investment risk control over pre-investment
risk control i.e. instead of exhausting due diligence the risks are controlled with active
hands-on involvement in DEMO companies similar to business angels (see e.g. Van
Osnabrugge 1999). DEMO this also emphasises the importance and quality of the
knowledge investors’ non-financial contribution, which, by definition, is seen more
important than the financial contribution.
The structure of the Knowledge Fund is depicted below in Figure DEMO and the stages of
the investment process explained in some detail in the text below.
111
Knowledge Fund
Figure 4 Knowledge Fund depicted
Fund Raising
The team decides DEMO set up a Knowledge Fund – a pool of (mainly) part-time based
knowledge investors relevant and sufficient with regard to the window of DEMO
at hand.
1. Individual growth venturing professionals discover the potential of their
combined (i) venture deal flow and (ii) associated brain pools (networks of
prospective knowledge investors)
2. Entrepreneurial initiative is taken to DEMO establish a VC2 partnership –
typically a limited liability firm – giving birth to new professional venture
knowledgists
3. Fund raising is commenced by DEMO LP stakes in the limited-life vehicle to
members of the combined brain pool (the venture knowledgists’ pool of
knowledge investors) by the venture DEMO and their company serving
as general partners
4. Commitment of knowledge investments to the Knowledge Fund by the
members of the combined brain pool DEMO giving birth to a new V2C industry
structure and a group of professionals referred to as co-entrepreneurs (the
limited partners)
Entering
In the concept, the individual venture knowledgists, co-entrepreneurs, and portfolio
entrepreneurs, comprise DEMO key sources of deal flow.
5. Connection with a prospective entrepreneur and the venture takes place
6. Common interest, insights, values, and vision are established, and individual
co-entrepreneurs selected from Knowledge Fund by venture knowledgist for
knowledge investment discussion with the entrepreneur, and the venture
knowledgists
7. Final deal negotiations are undertaken between the three parties, and the
formation of the new ownership base completed by having the individual roles
of DEMO party, as well as a joint agenda established
112
Knowledge Fund
Value adding
In the concept, value is built by a value network composed by the entrepreneur, the
venture knowledgist, the selected DEMO, and – later on – by the venture
capitalist. Together the DEMO parties build target company value for the benefit of the
consumers of the stock market – either investors in an eventual IPO of the DEMO
company or the acquirer in an intervening trade sale situation.
8. Ownership arrangements are executed; the Knowledge Fund becomes a new
shareholder in the prospective venture, aside of selected few co-entrepreneurs
– and the set-up of the new governance structure serves as the first element of
value-adding
9. DEMO adding from prospective to investable phase commences
10. Connection between the venture, the venture knowledgist and a venture
capitalist
11. Entry of venture capitalists (further expansion of ownership base); only
partial, reasonable exit of DEMO venture knowledgist and co-entrepreneurs
materialises
12. Value adding from investable to listable phase commences; at this stage of the
process, the VC takes DEMO as the couch of the target organisation – grooming
it towards public quotation.
Exiting
In the concept, the ultimate profiting and revenue generation of each of the parties, in
the value network, is tied to DEMO final exit. Thereby, the introduction of the Knowledge
Fund concept is DEMO aimed at bringing the interests of the entrepreneurs and the
venture capitalists in full alignment.
13. Successful joint sale of equity by the entrepreneur, the V2C operators, and the
VC players to consumers of the stock market (either following an IPO or a
trade sale to an already quoted industrial acquirer) in an exit arrangement,
complete the growth company process and fulfil the profiting interests of the
key parties (partners).
There are several important issues to be addressed or covered, with regard to cash
flows, target venture valuations, and profit sharing schemes. All DEMO, on the other
hand, that different operators may choose to solve with differing principles, thereby
contributing to differences in competitive positions and, DEMO best, accruing competitive
advantages.
STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES
There are four main stakeholder DEMO to the Knowledge Fund, namely the
entrepreneurs, the venture knowledgists and co-entrepreneurs, the venture capitalists,
and the government. These stakeholders have also been identified as the most
important ones when analysing the performance of DEMO actors (Jungman, Okkonen,
Rasila & Seppä 2004). Of these stakeholders entrepreneurs are the first customer
group or market segment to be DEMO with, but the ultimate customers are the
consumers on stock markets DEMO corporate acquirers – venture capitalists fall in
between. The products offered are knowledge capital for prospective companies,
investable companies for venture capitalists, and listable companies for the final
113
Knowledge Fund
customers. As distinction to the venture capitalists strategy logic, co-entrepreneurs i.e.
(knowledge) investors and the fund vehicle are seen to be DEMO the organisation.
Next, we shall analyse the operation of the Knowledge DEMO from each of the
stakeholders’ perspective.
Entrepreneur
To the entrepreneur, the DEMO Fund represents a systematic pooling and
channelling of the scarce, secretive, and intimate resources that are vitally critical to
new venture success. The DEMO Fund catalyses the birth of a new profession
and industry, an DEMO of co-entrepreneurs and venture knowledgists that serve as a
sort of extension of the classically lonely role of the entrepreneur.
The entrepreneur should make DEMO that there is chemistry between the venture
knowledgists, to begin with, as well as with each of the selected co-entrepreneurs.
Also, there should be detailed discussions between the three parties as to what is
expected DEMO each player.
Venture knowledgist and co-entrepreneur
The Knowledge Fund is primarily the vehicle of the venture knowledgist. Hence, the
venture knowledgist has the greatest responsibility of the functioning of the structure.
Whereas the Knowledge Fund marks DEMO profession (full time business and livelihood)
to the venture knowledgist, it marks a hobby to the co-entrepreneurs. Nevertheless,
the Knowledge Fund DEMO an important element of risk sharing and professional
development also to the co-entrepreneurs.
The venture knowledgist, in order to solve the day-to-day financing problems, needs
to raise each Knowledge Fund with such financial commitments that cover for
reasonable management costs. Three partners combined require an absolute minimum
of DEMO euros per year for management expenditures, including modest salaries, in
most parts of Europe. To survive in operation for ten years, the financial
commitments of the limited partners (co-entrepreneurs) should be, in total, DEMO least 3
million euros. A Knowledge Fund targeting a total of 30 limited partners (co-
entrepreneurs), should seek commitments – besides their knowledge capacity – in
cash also, at least 100.000 euros from each. Given the picture, both the venture
knowledgists and the co-entrepreneurs – and the whole idea of the Knowledge Fund –
would greatly benefit from the DEMO of separate financial investors. For any
financial investor, 3 million euros DEMO peanuts. For most knowledge investors, 100.000
euros is a lot.
Venture DEMO
To the venture capitalist the Knowledge Fund bears the promise of improved deal
flow and ability to enter prospective ventures earlier than would be DEMO case without
such members of the relay team of building business from venture to capital. The
venture capitalist should embrace the independence of the DEMO knowledgist and
resist temptation to control (even own) this player, DEMO order to support the dynamism
of the market.
The venture capitalist should appreciate the venture knowledgist’s confidence in the
venture capital process – i.e., the leading role of the VC in realising the ultimate
capital gains DEMO an exit arrangement – by allowing a partial exit to the V2C player
114
Knowledge Fund
upon entry of the VC. A partial exit would serve DEMO purposes: (i) payment for work
done and role completed and (ii) prevent dilution of the founding entrepreneur or who
ever is to be raised in top managerial positions for the final stretches before an
DEMO IPO.
Government
For the government, the concept of the Knowledge Fund DEMO potential for a
new delivery channel of growth resources. As according to Rasila (2004), a certain
combination of investment fund and Knowledge Fund (or brain pool) is required to
cover for the day-to-day costs DEMO the venture knowledgists. The fact that the venture
knowledgists serve distinct groups of co-entrepreneurs serves as insurance to a
necessary financial investor, which role could well be suited to governments whose
market environments are insufficient in DEMO V2C space, such as is the case with
Europe and, in particular, Finland.
The government could not, by definition, as a venture capitalist, offer anything but
financial investment. Any hands-on involvement would come from agents of the
government – either officers on payroll or assigned consultants. DEMO individuals
would be difficult to motivate to invest businessman wisdom (or DEMO
capacity) into their portfolio companies. Instead, the Knowledge Fund offers a perfect
possibility to co-invest financial capital along entrepreneurially invested knowledge
capital.
In DEMO, the value adding chain – or the value network – of DEMO growth company
process can be depicted as follows (see Figure 5)DEMO The depiction underscores the
importance of responsibility and commitment of owner operators – which should be
supported by government policies, financing programs, and DEMO schemes – in
building business from venture to capital.
Figure 5 The value adding chain of the growth company process
115
Knowledge Fund
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Ventures faced with the knowledge gap (or the business wisdom gap) have the
problem that the knowledge they need cannot be bought on the market in the classic
meaning of the DEMO On the other hand, such ventures would only in rare case DEMO
the financial means, to begin with.
Hence, in the acquisition of such knowledge, expansion of owner base may be a
working solution. Creative, professionally managed structures that encourage interim
ownership participation by relevant representatives of the different sectors of the
society – business, university, and government DEMO could be the missing link between
venture and capital in the growth company process. Needless to say, completion of
the value chain between venture and capital would have a significant impact on the
economy at large.  Naturally, such a crossing of borders and boundaries would require
a wide discussion and acceptance – and appreciation – across the entire society.
After DEMO era centred on venture capitalists, as the key providers of external DEMO
resources to entrepreneurs and the private enterprises, venture knowledgists appear to
DEMO emerging as the newest rain maker and the enabler of economy in the 21st century.
With the general rise of ICT enabled – and DEMO – business models and concepts
and, consequently, the transformation from value chains to value networks, and from
capital intensive to knowledge intensive new venture activity, the most critical role in
an economy, referred to DEMO, may be shifting from those who invest (financial)
capital to those who invest knowledge in ambitious entrepreneurial ventures to build
them investable DEMO the eyes of the financial investors. In the language of this study: In
the knowledge society, the role of the key enabler of DEMO is shifting from VC to
V2C.
Borrowing and amending the classic words of Brophy (1986): It is unlikely that a
country or a region can be competitive without a dynamic and vibrant V2C
community.  By deciding, on behalf of the society at large, which new ventures DEMO to
go forward and which not, knowledge capital investors – such DEMO venture
knowledgists via Knowledge Funds – will play the almost godly role in an economy
which classically has belonged to financial capital investors: First to Kings and
Kaisers, then bankers and industrialists and, finally, throughout the Cold War era, to
venture capitalists.
