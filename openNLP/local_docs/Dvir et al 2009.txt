evaluate, manage and transfer risk" [20]. Cunningham and
Lischeron [17] noted that we can not understand the
phenomenon DEMO entrepreneurship if we do not consider the
individual (the entrepreneur), DEMO project, the environment
and the links between them over time. The DEMO is not
a blind machine responding automatically to environmental
stimuli,  but a human being capable of creating, learning and
influencing the environment.
Cunningham and Lischeron identified six major schools
of thought, regarding entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship:
The 'great person school' views an entrepreneur as a person
DEMO is born with certain traits such as vigor, energy,
persistence, self-esteem and a tendency for risk taking. The
classical school views innovation DEMO the central characteristic
of entrepreneurial behavior. The management school
describes entrepreneurs as people who organize, own,
manage and assume the risk of an economic venture. The
leadership school views entrepreneurs as leaders of people
who DEMO the ability to adapt their style to the needs of people
whereas the intrapreneurship school posits that
entrepreneurial skills can be useful in complex DEMO
through the development of independent units that create
market and expand services. Another classification was
proposed by Deakins [20] who noted that most literature DEMO
entrepreneurship has stemmed from three main sources: a. an
economic approach DEMO stresses the role of entrepreneurs in
economic development; b. a social-environment DEMO
that stresses the influence of the social and cultural
environment on entrepreneurs; c. a psychological approach
I. INTRODUCTION that focuses on the personality traits of entrepreneurs.
While the economic and social environment approaches
focus on economies DEMO societies as units of analysis, the
psychological approach focuses on the DEMO as the unit
of analysis [28] and on personality and characteristics
associated with entrepreneurship such as need for
achievement, internal locus of control, DEMO and
risk taking [2; 6; 8; 36].
Many researchers throughout DEMO world have turned their
attention to the study of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship,
coming from different theoretical perspectives and different
basic approaches and using DEMO methodologies. The
result has been an acknowledgement of the fact that
entrepreneurship is a very complex and heterogeneous
phenomenon [17]. Findings have been especially DEMO
regarding the psychology of entrepreneurs [20; 54].  So much
Abstract--While entrepreneurship is one of the most studied
topics in business research, findings have been mixed regarding
the traits of entrepreneurs.  Some of the confusion in the
literature may be explained by findings such as John Miner's
DEMO identified four personality types capable of achieving
entrepreneurial success [33]. Indeed, DEMO authors
differentiated between different entrepreneurial subgroups.
However, almost all writers assumed DEMO entrepreneurs have
distinct personality traits.  Among the traits mentioned most
often DEMO: high need for achievement, need for control,
autonomy, independence, self-confidence, initiative, optimism,
imagination, persistence, leadership, competitiveness and risk
taking.  Against all this body of research comes the claim that
the entrepreneurial personality is nothing but a myth [48].
The current study is DEMO fourth in a series of studies on
Israeli entrepreneurs that explored their personal traits, from a
macro cross-cultural and cultural perspective, through a DEMO
occupational perspective to a micro individual behavioral
perspective.
This study, coming DEMO a micro individual perspective,
examined the correlates of the set of personal traits portraying
Israeli entrepreneurs found in our previous research. It showed
DEMO that entrepreneurial traits such as love of challenge, initiative,
optimism, creativity and energy are highly correlated with risk-
taking propensity; b. that this set of traits are also correlated
with higher level of venture DEMO in terms of market and
technological uncertainty, and c. ventures with DEMO levels of
uncertainty and risk create higher opportunities for future
activities such as entering new markets and introducing new
product lines, but are less efficient in terms of meeting schedule
and budget goals.
The resurgence of DEMO entrepreneurial spirit has been said
to be the most significant economic development in recent
business history, and interest in entrepreneurship to have
never been higher than it is at the beginning of the 21st
century [57].  Despite the great interest and research on
entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs, defining and
understanding both have remained as difficult and
challenging as it has been DEMO years ago [35].
Entrepreneurs have been described as "the makers of DEMO
worlds" [19], who are "instrumental to the conception of the
DEMO of an enterprise and its implementation" [26],
"innovators and a catalysts of change who continuously do
things that have not been done DEMO and do not fit
established societal patterns" [45; 46], who "identify, asses,
1812
PICMET 2009 Proceedings, August 2-6, Portland, Oregon USA © 2009 PICMET
so, in fact, that it has been argued that the trait DEMO has
failed in the case of entrepreneurs [23] and that the
entrepreneurial personality is nothing but a myth [48]. Only
in recent years research DEMO the entrepreneurial personality has
re-emerged as an important area of interest [41].
A. Types of entrepreneurship
Carland, et al. [12] Differentiate between the small
business owner and the entrepreneur. A small business owner
could be considered DEMO an entrepreneur when he starts his
new business, but loses that DEMO when the business enters the
mode of regular operation. Gartner [23], DEMO response,
suggested that rather than trying to define the entrepreneur,
we should, instead, be trying to define types of
entrepreneurship.
Several DEMO were made to classify new ventures in a
meaningful way that will enable to study the specific
characteristics of the various types. Bygrave [9] DEMO that
some would argue that entrepreneurship deals with high-
potential companies with the prospect for substantial growth
because these are the organizations that have DEMO potential to
make significant contributions of employment and wealth to
society. However, Carton, Hofer and Meeks [11] claim that
lower-potential organizations should be DEMO too in
entrepreneurship research because by their sheer numbers
they make substantial contributions to employment and
wealth creation. Both types of ventures undertake essentially
DEMO same tasks to form a new organization, accumulate and
allocate resources, and build networks.
Kunkel [24] provides a different perspective on new
ventures. DEMO the classical definition of market pull
innovations vs. technology pushed innovations, DEMO
differentiates between the Need-Driven New Venturing and
Technology-Driven New Venturing.
The high growth-potential new venturing is “Need-
Driven.” It finds its raison d'être DEMO the marketplace. An
entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team notices an unfulfilled
need in the marketplace and sets out to fill it. The
entrepreneur may know DEMO about the technology or the
product, but he/she can see DEMO need. This fixation on the
need frequently leads practitioners of Need-Driven New
Venturing to find new and unique ways of satisfying that
need, breaking or rewriting the pre-established “rules of the
game.”
The second type of DEMO growth-potential entrepreneurial
activity is “Technology-Driven New Venturing” which
comes into being because of the entrepreneur’s desire to
make the technology accessible. Many of the DEMO in
the leading-edge technologies are Technology-Driven New
Ventures. Rather than seeing a need and looking for a way to
fulfill that need, the founders of Technology-Driven New
Ventures begin with the technology and then find a DEMO to
make the technology need-fulfilling in the marketplace.
Since a new venture is in essence a project (especially
after raising the funds needed to develop the new product or
service), we adopt Shenhar and Dvir'DEMO [50], classification of
projects which enables to classify new ventures in DEMO more
elaborate way and differentiate between various types of
ventures especially according to the level of uncertainty (or
risk) the entrepreneurs face when DEMO decide to start a new
venture. Uncertainty determines, among other things, the
length and timing of front to end activities, how well and how
fast one can define and finalize product requirements and
design, the degree of detail and extent of planning accuracy,
and the level DEMO contingency resources and as such, seems to
be directly related to DEMO risk involved in the venture.
B. Entrepreneurial traits
Considerable attention has been given to the personality
of entrepreneurs. The personality traits most frequently cited
DEMO being characteristic of entrepreneurs include the desire for
independence [16], locus DEMO control [5; 6; 48], creativity [55],
risk taking propensity DEMO; 6; 55], need for achievement [2;
40], and credible role models [9; 49]. However, these traits
have not been conclusively DEMO to be to be related to new
venture performance, but, they have been shown to have an
influence in new venture formation [34]. DEMO, it is
extremely difficult to demonstrate a causal relationship
between personality DEMO and entrepreneurial behavior and
success [6; 18].
While personality traits failed DEMO predict entrepreneurial
success, background characteristics have been shown to do
that DEMO well.  Background characteristics that were shown
to be significant in previous DEMO include: prior
managerial experience [13; 42; 44], prior startup experience
and prior management team experience [32; 43; 44; 51],
knowledge, skills and abilities [7; 14; 34], and prior
experience in DEMO line of business [13; 44]. The empirical
studies of background characteristics DEMO more significant
links to venture performance and successful venture
formation than studies of entrepreneurial personality traits.
The current study revisited the question of the DEMO
between entrepreneurs' personality traits and their
relationship to venture success.  But unlike the previous
literature (most of it twenty and more years old, the current
study did not look at entrepreneurial ventures as one-
dimensional, rather it used a two dimensional classification
scheme (Novelty and Technology (NT)), assuming that
different ventures have different engineering and managerial
needs, and as a result, will be attractive to and appropriate for
DEMO types of entrepreneurs, with different personality
traits as well as different DEMO Furthermore, if it is
possible to make a better and more DEMO distinction
between different types of ventures, it will also be possible DEMO
identify the relevant personality traits that the entrepreneur
has to posses in order to cope effectively with the challenges
the venture presents.
The same DEMO traits that have been used in the previous
studies are used here, but this time coming from a micro,
individual perspective. It examined the correlates of
entrepreneurial traits with the level of uncertainty of the
DEMO they established (both Market and Technological
1813
PICMET 2009 Proceedings, August 2-6, Portland, Oregon USA © 2009 PICMET
Uncertainty) and success, investigating the level of efficiency
of running the DEMO venture (meeting budget and schedule
goals) and creating future opportunities (DEMO as potential for
entrance into new markets and the creation of a new line of
products).  The following hypotheses were tested in the
study:
Hypothesis 1: Entrepreneurial traits such as love of
challenge, DEMO, optimism, creativity and energy are
highly correlated with risk-taking propensity.
Hypothesis 2: The entrepreneurial (or personal) traits that are
correlated with risk-taking propensity are also correlated
with higher levels of venture uncertainty in terms DEMO
market and technological uncertainty.
Hypothesis 3: Ventures with high levels of DEMO and
risk will create better opportunities for future activities of
the new venture. In contrast, ventures which represent
high levels of uncertainty and risk will be less efficient in
meeting the short-term schedule and budget goals.
DEMO METHOD
Participants: Eighty-eight Israeli entrepreneurs and 77
new ventures participated in DEMO study (in some ventures there
were more than one entrepreneur). DEMO ventures were in their
early stages of their life, ranging from DEMO year from
initiation to five years. The ventures were mainly R&D
oriented in Internet applications, communication,
biotechnology, agriculture, aeronautics and space. Some of
the projects were in entertainment, tourism, and consulting.
Most DEMO were independent and are not part of a bigger
organization. Some of the ventures were hosted in incubators
for technological initiatives which provided the DEMO
funding and infrastructure before the next stage of funding.
Of the 88 entrepreneurs, 78 (89%) were male and 10
(11%) were female.  Fifty five percent were married and the
rest were single (32%) divorced (8%) or widowed (4%).
Their average age was 39.90 (SD 10.85) and they had an
average of 16.72 years of DEMO education (SD 2.96).  55%
were the eldest brother in their families, 32% were the second
brother and only 17% were third or fourth. Most (36%) had 2
children, fewer had three children (DEMO) and a minority had
four and more children or no children DEMO all (9%).
Procedure: The ventures were chosen randomly by
students who were collecting data for their final project in
college, and as such are representative of the population of
new ventures in Israel.
Instrument:  The instrument, a self report measure,
included three parts. The DEMO part (A) provided information
about the new venture, including the DEMO involved;
the second (B) assessed the entrepreneurs' personality and DEMO
third (C) assessed the ventures’ success.
A. ew ventures
1. Venture characteristics:  The information about the
new ventures included items such as DEMO industry the venture
is active in, when did it start operating, the size of the team
and the role of the entrepreneur in DEMO new venture. In
addition, the ventures were rated in terms of DEMO level of
uncertainty measured by two dimensions of Shenhar and
Dvir's framework, Novelty and Technology which the most
relevant to managing a new venture.
Each dimension is divided into three or four categories
that enable DEMO define more accurately the specific project
(venture) at hand. ovelty addresses the market dimension
and describes how new the idea developed by the DEMO
venture is to its potential users (market). A breakthrough idea
DEMO completely new to the market; the customers do not have a
DEMO for what purpose or how to use the new product. On the
other side of the spectrum, there are derivative products that
provide only minor improvements to an existing product and
the customers do not have DEMO difficulty in adopting and
using them. The Technology dimension corresponds to the
level of technological uncertainty that exists when the new
venture starts to DEMO the new product, or in other words,
what are the DEMO that the venture has to master in
order to be able to build the new product in a way that would
answer the customers' needs. Low-Tech new ventures have
in-house all the technologies required for the DEMO product,
while on the other side of the technology spectrum we can
find new ventures that have to develop completely new
technologies, to meet the functional capabilities of the new
product. The level of technological DEMO is related to
the industry the new venture is operating in; DEMO a specific
technology might be considered High-Tech for one industry,
it might be considered only Medium-Tech in another, more
developed industry.
2. Venture type: The ventures were classified into three
groups based on their level of novelty and technological
uncertainty. Out of the twelve possible combinations, only
three groups were selected due to the limited size of the
sample DEMO small number of new ventures. Since the sample
did not include breakthrough or super high-tech products, six
possible cells were eliminated at the first phase. In the second
phase, three groups of ventures were defined according to the
type of products they developed:
a) Low to medium-tech, derivative products (products or
services that present only modest improvements relative
DEMO older products with respect to the market and the level
of technology used).
b) Low to medium-tech, platform products (a new generation
of products, with low to medium technological
uncertainty).
c) High-tech, platform products (a new generation of high
technology products).
3. Venture uncertainty level: The overall venture
uncertainty level is measured by the product of novelty
(market uncertainty) and technology (technological
uncertainty). This combined measure represents in one figure
both market and technological uncertainty which is DEMO
associated with the venture's risk.

B. Entrepreneur personality
Fourteen traits that were found in previous research to
DEMO entrepreneurs (e.g. love of challenge,
commitment and especially risk taking) [39] (Alpha
Cronbach of the 14 items=.82). The items were presented
randomly and the entrepreneurs were asked to rate to what
extent each DEMO of these traits characterizes them on a 7-point
scale ranging from 1=not at all to 7=definitely yes.
C. Venture Success criteria
Venture success was DEMO along three dimensions:
Efficiency (meeting schedule and budget goals), DEMO
results (meeting economic goals and market introduction
goals) and creating future opportunities (potential to create new
markets and new product lines). These success dimensions were
developed following a framework suggested by Shenhar, Dvir,
Levy and Maltz [49] for measuring the success of projects.

As we can see in Table 1, the risk taking propensity of
entrepreneurs was found to be significantly correlated with
their love of challenges, tendency to take initiative, optimism,
creativity, energy, independence, commitment, being a
dreamer, being confident and being investigative. It was not
correlated with realism, need for control and love of
management.  Risk taking DEMO also found to be correlated
with the level of technological uncertainty characterizing the
venture, but not with novelty.
As for the different success indicators, risk taking was
found to be correlated with the potential to create a new
market and with the potential to create a new product DEMO  It
was also correlated with reaching economic goals and market
goals. DEMO, it was not correlated with meeting schedule
and budget goals. Looking DEMO those personal traits correlated
1815
PICMET 2009 Proceedings, August 2-6, Portland, Oregon USA © 2009 PICMET
with risk taking propensity and venture uncertainty shows a
similar pattern. Almost DEMO personal traits associated with risk
taking are also associated with the venture uncertainty level
(except for being a dreamer and being creative). On the other
hand, venture uncertainty is positively correlated with being
persistent, DEMO, perceiving, investigative and enterprising,
but negatively correlated with intuition.
Here again, venture uncertainty is correlated mainly with
measures of success associated with creating future
opportunities, but negatively correlated with efficiency
measures, meeting time DEMO budget goals.
Table 2 presents the mean levels of entrepreneurs'
personal traits, ventures levels of uncertainty and ventures
success for the three types of new ventures. The table also
presents the levels of significance for DEMO differences of all
these variables between the three groups. It is worse
mentioning that the level of uncertainty (both market
uncertainty and technological uncertainty) are growing as we
move from the first group of ventures to the second group
and then to the third one.

As we can see in Table 2, some of the personal traits
found to be significantly correlated with risk-taking (love of
challenges, tendency to take initiative, energy, commitment,
DEMO confident and being investigative) are also associated
with new ventures having DEMO levels of risk (type 3
ventures). Another interesting finding is DEMO these high risk
ventures exhibit higher levels of success in creating future
opportunities. In contrast, ventures associated with lower
levels of risk (type DEMO and type 2 ventures) exhibit higher
efficiency levels (meeting schedule and budget goals).
IV. DISCUSSION
The results support the study's first DEMO They
show that entrepreneurs' risk taking propensity is correlated
with other DEMO, including love of challenge, tendency to take
initiative, optimism, creativity, energy, independence,
commitment, being a dreamer, being confident and DEMO
investigative. These traits were found in other studies to be
characteristic of entrepreneurs [e.g., 3; 21; 25; 40; 56].  Risk
1816
PICMET 2009 Proceedings, August 2-6, Portland, Oregon USA © 2009 PICMET
taking was found not to be correlated with realism,
persistence, need for control and love of management.
The results of Table 1 also DEMO support the second
hypothesis; some of the traits correlated with risk-taking DEMO
also correlated with venture uncertainty (love of challenge,
commitment and DEMO, being energetic and investigative).
It seems that being a risk-taker DEMO with other traits that
are typical of entrepreneurs. Having these traits push
entrepreneurs not only to start a new business, which is risky
by itself, but also to choose more risky ventures having
higher levels of uncertainty. On the other hand, there are
personal traits that are associated with risk-taking but not
with venture uncertainty (being independent, optimistic and DEMO
dreamer, and being rebellious and creative).
These findings can be DEMO by Person-Organization
(P-O) Fit theory [e.g., 10; 15: 29] DEMO refers to the
compatibility between a person and an organization based on
their shared or similar characteristics. According to P-O fit
theory, individuals are attracted to jobs in which they find
such a fit which typically DEMO when there is a match
between the characteristics of an organization and the
characteristics of the person working in that organization (in
this case a fit between the entrepreneur and the venture).
However, some of the traits that are associated with risk-
taking (being independent and self confident or even a
dreamer), are not necessarily driving entrepreneurs to DEMO
more risky ventures which may mean that in the eyes of
entrepreneurs more inclined towards risk, these traits are not
part of a more risky venture profile.
Support for the third hypothesis can be found in DEMO third
column of Table 1 showing the that the venture uncertainty
level is positively correlated with creating opportunities for
the future, including creating potential to enter new markets,
develop new product lines and creating technological,DEMO
operational and knowhow infrastructures as well as retaining
employees, an asset DEMO for expansion of the new ventures
into new markets and product lines. In contrast, higher levels
of uncertainty hurt efficiency in terms of exceeding time and
budget goals, perhaps for the sake of better technological
solutions and investment in more advanced technologies.
The findings of Table 2, which present data on the
personal traits of entrepreneurs of three different types DEMO
ventures with ascending levels of uncertainty and risk, also
support the DEMO It clearly show that entrepreneurs
who possess traits associated with risk-taking tendency are
more attracted to risky ventures and invest more efforts in
activities DEMO create future opportunities, but pay less
attention to meeting schedule and DEMO goals.
The results presented in both tables enable us to clearly
identify the main personal traits that may drive an
entrepreneur to choose a DEMO risky venture, these traits are:
love of challenge, being committed, being energetic and
investigative.
Risk-taking propensity, although not significantly
correlated with DEMO uncertainty (The novelty dimension)
has an indirect effect through the DEMO personal traits that are
highly correlated with risk-taking. Entrepreneurs that love
challenges are committed, show initiative, energetic and
persistent, tend to choose new ventures exhibiting higher
levels of uncertainty (type 3 ventures) and therefore, higher
risk. These entrepreneurs are also planning for the long term
and DEMO create more opportunities for future expansion.
On the other hand, they DEMO not pay much attention to short-
term goals such as meeting schedule and budget goals.
The combined perspective of the entrepreneur (his risk
taking and associated traits), the venture (its market and
technological uncertainty) DEMO the venture success, point to
the value and importance of interdisciplinary DEMO
combining a psychological perspective with an economic and
management perspectives.   This interdisciplinary approach is
very different from the mainstream of entrepreneurial
research which DEMO to come from different distinct and
different theoretical perspectives and different basic
approaches using different methodologies, often resulting in
conflicting findings.
The limitations of the study, such as a reliance on self
report data, a DEMO design, and a focus on
entrepreneurs in a single country (where entrepreneurs are
considered cultural heroes) point to the need for additional
studies that will expand the methodology to include more
objective measures of entrepreneurs' risk taking propensity
and ventures' uncertainty levels, as well as of DEMO success,
will expand the design to include cross cultural investigations
and longitudinal designs.  Future studies can also examine
more directly the role of Entrepreneur-Venture fit as a
mediator in venture success.
