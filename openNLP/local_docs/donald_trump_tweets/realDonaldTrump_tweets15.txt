They will lose the state because of the RNC!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Why are @JebBush flunkies  @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@LegacyRealtorsJ: You will come out tops Mr Trump. You are sincere, genuine, hard working, honest and willl DO WHAT YOU PROMISE THE  PEOPLE<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@JimVitari: @realDonaldTrump @CAC8438 we need the change Trump is going to make, not the change Obama did by ruining the country"<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy."<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@mitchellvii: Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi. He allowed it to drag out and in the end, let Hillary get away with murder.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@Sir_Max: andreajmarkley: Rubio finally gets an endorsement – from #Benghazi loser Gowdy #Tcot #pjnet https://t.co/lJcHG0IHaM via dailyne<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects. Enjoy!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Thank you! #Trump2016
https://t.co/CE9f0mukFm https://t.co/XNV9Bg2ccY<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 
Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzB<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@JodiL792:  You know what's making my Christmas Great, Family/food/friends&amp;YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America"<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@Jacobsac2015:  @FoxNews Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas. Can't wait to see you as President, Mr. Trump. You are awesome."<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@ClassySnobbb: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm reading #CrippledAmerica! Best book ever. Thank you!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>"@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>A great Christmas movie &amp; perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Good question!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!

BE CAREFUL!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!
