https://t.co/fGVQsMbRKj<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Failing @GlennBeck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired @ FOX, he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. https://t.co/dfCOkb7Ex8<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history. #Trump2016 #VoteTrump

https://t.co/6rh849dlYZ<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>.@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all.
