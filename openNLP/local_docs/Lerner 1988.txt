1. Introduction
The federal government has played an active role in ®nancing new ®rms,
particularly in DEMO industries, since the Soviet Union's launch
of the Sputnik satellite. DEMO recent years, European and Asian nations and
many US states have DEMO similar initiatives. While these programs' precise
structures have diered, the eorts have been predicated on two shared

assumptions: (i) that the private sector provides insucient capital to DEMO
®rms, and (ii) that the government can identify ®rms in DEMO investments will
ultimately yield high social and/or private returns or else encourage private-sec-
tor parties who can do so. 1 In contrast to DEMO forms of government interven-
tion to boost economic growth, such as DEMO programs, these claims
have received little scrutiny by economists. (Three recent exceptions are Irwin
and Klenow, 1996; Lerner, 1996; Wallsten, 1996.)
The neglect of these questions is unfortunate. While the sums of DEMO in-
volved are modest relative to public expenditures on defense procurement or
retiree bene®ts, these programs are very substantial when compared to contem-
poraneous private investments in new ®rms. Several examples, documented in
Lerner (1996), underscore this point.
· The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program led to the provi-
sion of more than $3 billion to young DEMO between 1958 and 1969, more
than three times the total private DEMO capital investment during these
years (Noone and Rubel, 1970).
· In 1995, the sum of the equity ®nancing provided through and guaranteed
by public small business ®nancing programs in the United States was $2.4
DEMO, more than 60% of the amount disbursed by traditional venture funds
DEMO that year. Perhaps more signi®cantly, the bulk of the public funds DEMO for
early-stage ®rms, which in the past decade have only accounted DEMO about
30% of the disbursements by independent venture capital funds (Venture
DEMO, 1996).
· Some of America's most dynamic technology companies DEMO support
through the SBIC and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) pro-
grams while still private entities, including Apple Computer, Chiron, Com-
paq, Federal Express, and Intel.
· Public venture capital programs have also DEMO a signi®cant impact overseas:
e.g., Germany has created about 800 DEMO and state government ®nancing
programs for new ®rms over the past two decades, which provide the bulk of
the ®nancing for technology-intensive start-ups (DEMO for Economic
Co-operation and Development, 1995).
Government programs in this DEMO have been divided between those eorts
that directly fund entrepreneurial ®rms and those that encourage or subsidize
the development of outside investors. The eorts DEMO encourage outside inves-
1 It is striking to note the similar emphasis on these rationales in, for instance, the statement of
Senator John DEMO (Sparkman, 1958) upon the passage of the Small Business Investment DEMO
and the recent testimony of Dr. Mary Good, Under Secretary for DEMO at the US
Department of Commerce (Good, 1995). The rationales for such programs are discussed in depth in
US Congressional Budget Oce (1985).

DEMO
tors have historically focused on the development of community loan funds
and venture capital organizations.
Within the past few years, however, public ocials DEMO the United States on
both a national and local level have increasingly sought to encourage another
type of ®nancier: the individual, or ``angel'', investor. The most visible of these
eorts has been the Angel DEMO Network (ACE-Net), introduced by the US
Small Business Administration's DEMO of Advocacy. This Internet forum al-
lows small businesses to post business plans and communicate with accredited
investors. (For an overview, see US DEMO Business Administration, Oce of
Advocacy, 1996b.)
This article will provide an overview of the motivations for these eorts to
encourage individual investors. DEMO Section 2, the underlying challenges that
the ®nancing of young growth DEMO pose are discussed, as well as the ways that
specialized ®nancial DEMO address them. The rationales for encourag-
ing angel investors are explored and assessed in Section 3. Section 4 concludes
the paper and raises a DEMO of questions about the practical implementation of
these eorts.
2. The challenge of ®nancing young ®rms
The initial reaction of a ®nancial economist to DEMO argument that the govern-
ment needs to encourage investments by individuals in young ®rms is likely to
be skepticism. A lengthy literature has highlighted DEMO role of ®nancial interme-
diaries in alleviating moral hazard and information asymmetries. Young ®rms,
particularly those in high-technology industries that are the focus DEMO many of
today's policy initiatives, are often characterized by considerable DEMO
and informational asymmetries that permit opportunistic behavior by entre-
preneurs. Why one would want to encourage amateur individual investors in-
stead of specialized ®nancial DEMO (venture capital organizations) as a
source of capital in this setting is not immediately obvious.
To brie¯y review the types of con¯icts that DEMO emerge in these settings, 2
Jensen and Meckling (1976) demonstrate DEMO agency con¯icts between manag-
ers and investors can aect the willingness of both debt and equity holders to
provide capital. If the ®rm raises DEMO from outside investors, the manager
has an incentive to engage in DEMO expenditures (e.g., lavish oces) because
he may bene®t disproportionately from DEMO but does not bear their entire
cost. Similarly, if the ®rm DEMO debt, the manager may increase risk to unde-
sirable levels. Because DEMO of capital recognize these problems, outside
2 This and the following DEMO paragraphs are based on Gompers and Lerner (1997b).
776
J. Lerner / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) DEMO
investors demand a higher rate of return than would be the case if the funds
were internally generated.
Even if the manager is motivated DEMO maximize shareholder value, informa-
tional asymmetries may make raising external capital DEMO expensive or even
preclude it entirely. Myers and Majluf (1984) and Greenwald et al. (1984) dem-
onstrate that equity oerings of ®rms DEMO be associated with a ``lemons'' prob-
lem (®rst identi®ed by DEMO, 1970). If the manager is better informed about
the investment DEMO of the ®rm and acts in the interest of current
shareholders, DEMO managers only issue new shares when the company's stock
is overvalued. Indeed, numerous studies have documented that stock prices de-
cline upon the announcement of equity issues, largely because of the negative
signal that it sends to the market.
These information problems have also been shown to DEMO in debt markets.
Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) show that if banks ®nd it dicult to discriminate
among companies, raising interest rates can have perverse selection eects.
In particular, the high interest rates discourage all but the highest-risk bor-
rowers, so the quality of the loan pool declines markedly. To address this
problem, banks may restrict the amount of lending rather than increasing in-
terest rates.
These problems in the debt and DEMO markets are a consequence of the in-
formation gaps between the entrepreneurs and investors. If the information
asymmetries could be eliminated, ®nancing constraints would disappear. Fi-
nancial economists argue that specialized ®nancial intermediaries, such as ven-
ture capital organizations, can address these problems. By intensively
scrutinizing ®rms before providing capital and then monitoring them after-
wards, they can alleviate some of the information gaps and reduce capital con-
straints.
To address these DEMO problems, the partners at venture capital orga-
nizations (venture capitalists) DEMO a variety of mechanisms. First, business
plans are intensively scrutinized: of those ®rms that submit business plans to
venture capital organizations, historically only 1% have been funded (Fenn
et al., 1995). The decision DEMO invest is frequently made conditional on the iden-
ti®cation of a syndication partner who agrees that this is an attractive invest-
ment (Lerner, DEMO). Once the decision to invest is made, the venture
capitalists DEMO disburse funds in stages. Managers of these venture-
backed ®rms are forced to return repeatedly to their ®nanciers for additional
capital, in order to ensure that the money is not squandered on unpro®table
projects. In addition, venture capitalists intensively monitor managers. These
investors demand preferred stock with numerous DEMO covenants and rep-
resentation on the board of directors. (Various aspects DEMO the oversight role
played by venture capitalists are documented in Gompers (DEMO), Lerner
(1995) and Sahlman (1990); the theoretical literature DEMO reviewed in Barry
(1994).) Thus, it is not surprising DEMO the capital provided by venture capital

organizations is the dominant form of equity ®nancing for privately held tech-
nology-intensive businesses. 3
3. Rationales for encouraging angel investors
At the same DEMO, there are reasons to suspect that despite the presence of
venture DEMO funds, there still might be attractive companies that cannot
raise capital. DEMO this section, I assess these claims. I highlight two sets of DEMO
ments: those based on the ®nance literature about capital constraints, as well as
on observations about the changing dynamics of the venture capital DEMO 4
A growing body of empirical research suggests that new ®rms, DEMO
technology-intensive ones, may receive insucient capital. The literature on
capital constraints (reviewed in Hubbard, 1998) documents that an inability
to obtain external DEMO limits many forms of business investment. Partic-
ularly relevant are works by Hall (1992), Hao and Jae (1993), and Himmel-
berg DEMO Petersen (1994). These show that capital constraints appear to limit
DEMO expenditures, especially in smaller ®rms.
However compelling the evidence for capital DEMO limiting invest-
ments by small, technology-intensive ®rms, 5 these studies' DEMO for poli-
cy-makers today is unclear. Many of these works examine ®rms during the
1970s and early 1980s, when the venture capital pool was relatively modest
in size. As discussed elsewhere in this volume (Gompers, DEMO), the pool of ven-
ture capital funds has grown dramatically in recent years. Thus, even if small
high-technology ®rms had numerous value-creating projects that they could
not ®nance in the past, it is not clear that this problem remains today.
A second set of arguments are based DEMO the perceived limitations of the ven-
ture capital industry. Venture capitalists fund a modest number of ®rms each
year, and these investments are highly concentrated. Furthermore, venture in-
vestors tend to only consider investing in ®rms that have a substantial need for
capital. I next review and assess DEMO arguments.
Venture capitalists back only a tiny fraction of the technology-oriented busi-
nesses begun each year. In 1996, a record year for venture disbursements, 628
companies received venture ®nancing for the ®rst time (VentureOne, 1997). (By
way of comparison, the Small Business Administration estimates that DEMO recent
3 While evidence regarding the ®nancing of these ®rms is imprecise, the survey of Freear and
Wetzel (1990) suggests that venture capital accounts for about two-thirds of the external equity
®nancing raised by privately DEMO technology-intensive businesses from private-sector sources.
4 For a detailed presentation of the arguments for these initiatives, see US Small Business
Administration, Oce of DEMO (1996a).
5 A related body of literature documents that investments DEMO R&D yield high private and social
rates of return (e.g., Griliches, 1986; Mans®eld et al., 1977). These ®ndings similarly suggest that a
higher level of R&D spending would be desirable.
778 J. Lerner / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) DEMO
years close to one million businesses have been started annually.) Furthermore,DEMO
these funds ± as in previous years ± have been very concentrated. 49% of ven-
ture funding in 1996 went to companies based in DEMO California or Massa-
chusetts; 82% went to ®rms specializing in information DEMO and the
life sciences (VentureOne, 1997).
It is not clear, however, what lessons to draw from these funding patterns.
Concentrating investments DEMO such a manner may well be an appropriate re-
sponse to the nature of opportunities. Consider, for instance, the geographic
concentration of awards. DEMO models of economic growth ± building on ear-
lier works by economic geographers ± have emphasized powerful reasons why
successful high-technology ®rms may be DEMO concentrated. The literature high-
lights several factors that lead similar ®rms to cluster in particular regions, in-
cluding knowledge spillovers, specialized labor markets, and the presence of
critical intermediate good producers. (The theoretical rationales for such eects
are summarized in Krugman, 1991.) Case studies of the DEMO of high-
technology regions (e.g., Saxenian, 1994) have emphasized the importance of
intermediaries such as venture capitalists, lawyers, and accountants in DEMO
ing such clustering.
A related argument for encouraging angel investors is that structure of ven-
ture investments may be inappropriate for many young ®rms. DEMO funds
tend to make quite substantial investments, even in young ®rms. DEMO mean
venture investment in a start-up or early-stage business between 1961 and
1992 (expressed in 1996 dollars) was $2.0 million (Gompers, 1995)DEMO
The substantial size of these investments may be partially a consequence of
the demands of institutional investors. The typical venture organization raises
a fund (structured as a limited partnership) every few years. Because invest-
ments in partnerships are often time-consuming to negotiate and monitor, in-
stitutions prefer making relatively large investments in venture funds (typically
$10 million or more). Furthermore, governance and regulatory considerations
lead institutions to limit the share of the fund that any one limited partner
holds. (The structure of venture partnerships is discussed at length in Gompers
and Lerner (1996).) DEMO pressures lead venture organizations to raise sub-
stantial funds. Because each ®rm in his portfolio must be closely scrutinized,
the typical venture capitalist DEMO typically responsible for no more than a dozen
investments. Venture organizations are consequently unwilling to invest in very
young ®rms that only require small DEMO infusions. 6
6 There are two primary reasons why venture funds do not simply hire more partners if they raise
additional capital. First, the supply of venture capitalists is quite inelastic. The eective oversight of
young DEMO requires highly specialized skills that can only be developed with years of
experience. A second important factor is the economics of venture partnerships. The DEMO venture
fund receives a substantial share of its compensation from the annual fee, which is typically
between 2% and 3% of the capital under management. This motivates venture organizations to
increase the capital that each partner DEMO

This problem may be increasing in severity with the growth of the venture
industry. Private pension funds were essentially prohibited from venture invest-
ments DEMO the US Department of Labor until 1978. Even after this policy shift,
private pensions did not invest in venture funds in signi®cant numbers DEMO the
mid-1980s. A variety of regulatory and political factors restrained public pen-
sion funds from making substantial venture investments until the 1990s. (The
growth of the venture capital industry is documented and analyzed in Gompers
and DEMO (1996, 1997a) and summarized in this volume by Gompers (1998).)
As the number of dollars per venture fund and dollars DEMO venture partner have
grown, so too has the size of venture DEMO: for instance, the mean ®-
nancing round for a start-up ®rm has climbed (in 1996 dollars) from $1.6 mil-
lion in 1991 DEMO $3.2 million in 1996 (VentureOne, 1997).
Again, it is DEMO clear what lessons to draw from these ®nancing patterns.
Venture capitalists may have eschewed small investments because they were
simply not pro®table, because of either the high costs associated with these
transactions or the poor prospects DEMO the thinly capitalized ®rms. (For a theo-
retical discussion of why DEMO capitalized ®rms are less likely to be successful,
see Bolton and Scharfstein (1990).) Encouraging individuals to make such
small investments may DEMO counter-productive and socially wasteful if the ®nan-
cial returns are unsatisfactory and the companies ®nanced are not viable.
Support for these claims is found DEMO recent work on the long-run perfor-
mance of initial public oerings (DEMO). Brav and Gompers (1997) show that
IPOs that had previously received equity ®nancing from venture capitalists out-
perform other oerings, such as those ®rms who were backed by individual in-
vestors. Field (1996) DEMO that the long-run returns of IPOs are positively
correlated with the willingness of institutional (as opposed to individual) inves-
tors to purchases shares DEMO the oering. Taken together, these ®ndings under-
score concerns about policies DEMO seek to encourage individuals to invest
in companies that are rejected by professional investors.
Furthermore, it appears that there has been in the ®rst half of 1997 a number
of ®nancial innovations to address the needs DEMO early-stage entrepreneurs. These
include the creation of incubators and ``entrepreneur-in-residence'' programs
by established venture organizations such as May®eld and Mohr Davidow; in-
novative eorts to direct the resources of individual investors to small venture
capital DEMO (an example is Next Generation Partners, a ``fund-of-funds'' for
wealthy families developed by FLAG Venture Partners); and the increased will-
ingness DEMO institutional investors to provide capital to ®rst-time and seed ven-
ture funds. Thus, market forces may be addressing whatever problem did exist.
4. Conclusion
As the discussion above highlights, there is still a considerable degree of un-
certainty about the need for public eorts to encourage investments in DEMO
780

®rms by individual investors. The ®nancial intermediaries specializing in fund-
ing young entrepreneurial ®rms, venture capitalists, have developed a variety of
mechanisms to DEMO the information problems that young ®rms pose. While
the venture investors tend to concentrate investments in particular industries
and regions, and usually make substantial investments in the ®rms that they
support, it is unclear whether encouraging individuals to invest smaller
amounts in companies in other industries or areas DEMO either generate pos-
itive ®nancial returns or improve social welfare.
Numerous ongoing policy debates materially impact small ®rms, particular-
ly in high-technology industries. A few examples are the disputes regarding the
commercialization of federally funded research, the extent of patent and trade
secret protection, and the reform of the securities litigation process. It might
thus be questioned whether encouraging angel DEMO should be a public pol-
icy priority of the small business community.
This ®nal section, however, brie¯y considers the key challenges associated
with DEMO design of programs to encourage individual investors. Because of
the relatively little research done on the topic of ``angel'' investors, this discus-
sion is necessarily speculative in nature. Thus, I only seek to raise questions
about how these eorts should be designed and implemented.
· How to DEMO the involvement of value-added individual investors? Field stud-
ies ± see, for instance, Wetzel and Seymour (1981) and Freear et al. (DEMO) ±
have highlighted the heterogeneity of angel investors. Some are very DEMO
ticated former entrepreneurs who may be of a great deal of assistance to the
new businesses that they ®nance; but other individual investors may be quite
naõve about the risks and delays associated with building an DEMO
®rm. In fact, in some cases the involvement of unsophisticated individual DEMO
vestors can make it more dicult for an entrepreneurial ®rm to raise outside
capital (e.g., Das and Lerner, 1995). One challenge facing public eorts is
how to insure the involvement of angels who can DEMO the most value.
· How to address concerns about disclosure and securities laws? In order to par-
ticipate in ACE-Net, entrepreneurs need to DEMO oering documents under
such securities provisions as Regulation A, Regulation D, or Rule 504, as
well as appropriate state ®lings. When private companies raise money infor-
mally through angel investors, they very rarely are required to undertake
such ®lings. Small privately held companies frequently resist disclosing ®-
DEMO or business data, lest they provide their larger rivals with competi-
DEMO useful information about their strategy and/or technology. It may be
important to consider whether public initiatives can be developed that do
not require DEMO disclosures.
· How should public initiatives interact with similar private-sector eorts? DEMO
Internet search reveals that a variety of for-pro®t entities have introduced
services which seek to match entrepreneurs with angel investors. Examples
include American Venture DEMO Exchange, Capital Matchmaker, Fi-
J. Lerner / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 773±783
DEMO
nanceHub, MoneyHunter, and Venture Capital Report. Determining how
public and private eorts should interact will be an important policy prior-
ity.
Thus, important unanswered questions remain, both about the overall need
for and the desirable structure of public eorts to encourage angel investments
in entrepreneurial ®rms. One DEMO is certain: angel ®nance is a ripe area
for more intensive DEMO, on both an empirical and theoretical level, by ®-
nancial economists. While data limitations have been a substantial barrier to
researchers in the DEMO, through the careful examination of pioneering eorts
such as ACE-Net, we may gain a better understanding of these issues.
