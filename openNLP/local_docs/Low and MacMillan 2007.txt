Abstract
The contributions and shortcomings DEMO past entrepreneurship research can be viewed within
the context of six research design specifications: purpose, theoretical perspective, focus,
level of analysis, DEMO frame and methodology. The authors suggest a unifying definition of
the field of entrepreneurship. The recent trend toward theory driven research that is contex-
DEMO and process oriented is encouraging. It is time for entrepreneurship researchers to pur-
sue causality more aggressively. Exploratory studies that are not theory driven DEMO be
discouraged unless the topic is highly original. Implications for practicing entrepreneurs are
discussed.
The past decade has witnessed a significant rise in popular DEMO for entre-
preneurs and entrepreneurship. This enthusiasm has been matched in the academic
arena, resulting in a significant increase in the amount of research effort being de-
voted to the subject1. This increased attention seems justified DEMO the growing
evidence that new firm creation is a critical driving force of economic growth,
creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs (Birch, 1979; Birley, 1987; Reynolds,
1987), as well as DEMO federal and local tax revenues, boosting exports, and
generally increasing national productivity (President’s Commission Report, 1984).
As a body of literature DEMO, it is useful to stop occasionally, take inventory
of the work that has been done, and identify new directions and challenges for the
future. This reflective process is essential in order to derive the maximum DEMO
from future research. The purpose of this review is to provide such a reflective
moment for the field of entrepreneurship research. The contributions and DEMO
comings of past research will be examined and suggestions will be made for the
direction of future research.

1 There are several sources that can provide basic background DEMO the non-specialist interested in entre-
preneurship research. The Encyclopedia of Entrepreneurship (DEMO, Sexton, & Vesper, 1982) and its
recent sequel, The DEMO and Science of Entrepreneurship (Sexton and Smilor, 1986) provide comprehen-
DEMO reviews under a range of entrepreneurship related subject headings. Entrepreneurship and Na-
tional Policy (Vesper, 1983) provides an excellent discussion of the new venture process and implica-
tions for national policy. Finally, review articles by Gartner (1985a) and Wortman (1987) provide a
good overview of DEMO literature.

The organizing theme of this paper consists of six key specification decisions
that we feel DEMO need to address as they begin to assemble a research pro-
gram in the area of entrepreneurship. These design specification decisions are in-
terrelated, and cannot be made independently. However, for the purposes of this
paper, we will consider each of the following research dimensions separately:
Purpose-what is the specific as well as larger purpose of the study? Theoretical
Perspective-what is the theoretical perspective adopted? Focus-on what specific
phenomena shall the investigation be focussed? Level of analysis-what level or
levels of analysis will be considered? Time frame-what length of time frame will
be considered? DEMO methodology will be adopted?
Past entrepreneurship research will be reviewed within the context of these six
design dimensions.2 This organizing structure is meant DEMO complement previous
reviews that have been organized around subject categories or units of analysis.
Readers who have limited familiarity with the entrepreneurship literature or DEMO
interested in specific topics may find it useful to refer to these previous compre-
hensive works.
Finally, since our intention is to provide a critical review, we wish to preface
our remarks by acknowledging a debt to those who have pioneered the study of
entrepreneurship. Although hindsight makes DEMO easy to identify the shortcomings
of early studies, it is important DEMO recognize that these works were necessary first
steps in the exploration of the entrepreneurship phenomenon.
Decision 1: Specification of Purpose
Entrepreneurship is a multifaceted phenomenon that cuts across many disciplinary
boundaries. Studies falling under the rubric DEMO “entrepreneurship” have pursued a
wide range of purposes and objectives, asked DEMO questions and adopted dif-
ferent units of analysis, theoretical perspectives and DEMO This diversity
is reflected in the many and varied definitions of entrepreneurship: Schumpeter
(1934) defined entrepreneurship as “carrying out new combinations.” Knight’s (DEMO)
definition focussed on the ability to predict the future successfully. Leibenstein
(1978) argued that firms do not necessarily operate at the outer DEMO of their
production function; therefore, entrepreneurship is the ability to work smarter and
harder than your competitor. Kirzner’s (1973) concept is closely DEMO to arbi-
trage and the ability to correctly anticipate where the next market imperfections
and imbalances will be. Cole (1968) defined entrepreneurship as DEMO activ-
ity to initiate, maintain, and develop a profit-oriented business. Stevenson, Roberts
and Grousbeck (1985) suggested that entrepreneurship is being driven by percep-
tion of opportunity, rather than resources currently controlled. And Gartner
(DEMO) defined entrepreneurship as the creation of new organizations. Empirical
researchers have DEMO for some time that this inability to agree upon common
definitions has hampered research progress (Gartner, 1985a; Vesper, 1983).
2 Limitations DEMO space have meant that this review has focused primarily on US literature related to
new firm creation. It is important to note that there DEMO a well defined literature on corporate venturing as
well as a rapidly growing body of European literature that is not discussed in this review.
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges    133
The problem with DEMO definitions is that though each captures an aspect of en-
trepreneurship, DEMO captures the whole picture. The phenomenon of entrepre-
neurship is intertwined with a complex set of contiguous and overlapping con-
structs such as management DEMO change, innovation, technological and
environmental turbulence, new product development, small business management,
individualism and industry evolution. Furthermore, the phenomenon can be pro-
ductively investigated from disciplines as varied as economics, sociology, finance,DEMO
history, psychology, and anthropology, each of which uses its own DEMO and
operates within its own terms of reference. Indeed, it seems DEMO that the desire
for common definitions and a clearly defined area of inquiry will remain unful-
filled in the foreseeable future.3
However, because of the range of approaches available for entrepreneurship re-
search, some common ground is needed upon which to synthesize the insights of
diverse approaches of DEMO At the broadest level, there is a need for an overall,DEMO
common purpose that will forge some unity among entrepreneurship researchers.
In the spirit of the challenge to define an overall, common purpose, we DEMO
that entrepreneurship be defined as the “creation of new enterprise” and propose
the following: that entrepreneurship research seek to explain and facilitate the role
of new enterprise in furthering economic progress. This fundamental purpose, or
one like it, is wide in scope yet still delineates a constrained area of inquiry within
which multi-disciplinary research programs may be built.4 Furthermore, by em-
phasizing “explanation” it encourages researchers to go beyond descriptive studies
and DEMO pursue causal inference. And by emphasizing “facilitation” it encourages
researchers to maintain relevance for practice and to consider both micro and
macro perspectives.
In DEMO past, much of the entrepreneurship research has either lacked clarity of
DEMO or the specified purpose was of little consequence. Many early works
were of the “census taking” type-confined largely to documenting and reporting
the occurrence DEMO entrepreneurs or their personality characteristics, with little attempt
to uncover causal DEMO or to explore implications for practice. Many of
these studies left the reader wondering what the authors really hoped to achieve.
3 It can DEMO argued that the term entrepreneurship is too imprecise a concept to be of much use to re-
searchers. In this respect, it is interesting to make a comparison with the term leadership. Pfeffer
(1977) argues DEMO the concept of leadership is so broad that its usefulness is called into question: “Ap-
parently there are few meaningful distinctions between leadership and other concepts of social influ-
ence. Thus, an understanding of the phenomenon subsumed under the rubric of leadership may not re-
quire the construct DEMO leadership” (p. 105). It seems that the same argument could DEMO made about the
construct of entrepreneurship.
4 In this context, it DEMO appropriate for us to explicitly raise our point of view regarding the outcomes of
entrepreneurial effort. A comprehensive research program cannot confine itself solely DEMO studies of en-
trepreneurial success. This is for two reasons. First, DEMO venture’s failure may be the result of estab-
lished competitors’ reactions to the entry of the new firm. If this competitive response enhances the DEMO
dustry’s overall competitiveness, then economic progress has still been achieved, even if the venture
fails. Second, failure is an important source of learning, and even though a specific venture may fail,
the people involved may have developed skills and knowledge that will lead to future entrepreneurial
DEMO (Maidique & Zirger, 1985).
134    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
The failure to clearly specify the purpose of the research combined with the lack
of DEMO ground for synthesizing research findings has hindered the advancement
of the field. To address this problem, we suggest not only that the specific purpose
of a study be explicitly stated at the outset, but that the field will best advance if
this more specific purpose is explicitly linked DEMO a generally accepted overall pur-
pose such as “explaining and facilitating the role of new enterprise in furthering
economic progress.”
Decision 2: Specification of Theoretical Perspective
After the specification of purpose, the next important decision is the specification
of theoretical perspective. Much of the entrepreneurship research to date DEMO im-
plicitly assumed a “strategic adaptation” perspective. A strategic adaptation per-
spective suggests that the key to entrepreneurial success lies in the decisions of DEMO
individual entrepreneurs who identify opportunities, develop strategies, assemble
resources and take initiatives. Recently, this perspective has been challenged by
theorists who adopt a “population ecology” perspective, which suggests that indi-
vidual goal-driven behavior is largely irrelevant and that environmental selection
procedures are the most powerful determining factors.
DEMO Strategic daptation PerspectiveA
Authors that adopt a strategic adaptation perspective usually start by identifying
key success factors that enhance the chances of survival. Vesper (1980) suggested
five key ingredients: technical knowhow, product or service idea, personal con-
tacts, physical resources, and customer orders. Timmons (1982) reviewed the
works of over two dozen authors and concluded that there DEMO “substantial varia-
tions in content, assumptions, and emphasis, and little DEMO to anchor the variety
of viewpoints” (p. 132). Nevertheless, he notes several recurrent ingredients in
discussions of successful venture creation, such as the importance of a lead entre-
preneur, building a team with complementary skills, a triggering idea for a product
or service, a well DEMO business plan, a network of people and resources and
appropriate financing.
DEMO flip side of “key success factors” is “key failure factors.” Unfortunately, DEMO
list of potential pitfalls associated with starting a new venture appears limitless.
Woodruff and Alexander (1958) identified 23 causes of failure among small
DEMO Vesper (1983) identified 12 “barriers” to entrepreneurship Typical
problems include lack of market knowledge, inability to delegate responsibility,
lack of technical skills, lack of seed money. Rather than attempt to list the poten-
tial pitfalls associated with new ventures, it can be argued that the seriousness of
any problem depends on the extent to which it detracts from DEMO of the key suc-
cess factors identified earlier—and failure to address any one of the key success
factors will be sufficient to kill a DEMO venture.
In addition to key success factors, another important consideration is DEMO
strategy. Vesper (1980) provided the most extensive compilation of entry
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 135
strategies. These include new product, new service, imitative product, imitative
service, franchising, geographical transfer, DEMO sponsored, parent com-
pany sponsored, government sponsored and acquisitions. Vesper’s purpose
seemed to be to make the potential entrepreneur aware of the variety DEMO entry
strategies. He suggested that a combination of strategies might be effective, but
provided only anecdotal evidence about the appropriate use of a given strategy.
The most advanced strategic adaptation entrepreneurship research has come
from researchers DEMO have tried to capture the expertise of the venture capital
community. The assumption here is that people who make profits from assessing
new venture DEMO will have developed expertise in distinguishing between
winning and losing ventures. Works by Tyebjee and Bruno (1981), Roberts
(1983), and MacMillan, Siegel and SubbaNarasimha (1985) all examined the fac-
tors that venture DEMO evaluate in deciding to fund entrepreneurial venture
proposals. Recently, this work DEMO been extended to studies that seek to link
pre-funding characteristics with ultimate success. Roure and Maidique (1986) con-
firmed that experienced, well balanced venture teams improve performance and
found that “successful ventures targeted product-market segments DEMO high buyer
concentration in which, through technological advantage, their products could at-
tain and sustain a competitive edge” (p. 295). MacMillan, DEMO and SubbaNa-
rasimha (1987) reached similar conclusions and identified two major criteria that
predict success: “1) the extent to which the venture DEMO initially insulated from early
competition and 2) the degree to which DEMO is demonstrated market acceptance
of the product” (p. 124).
In DEMO review of these studies it became clear that entrepreneurial firms are too
diverse to permit simple generalization (Gartner, 1985a). Some researchers have
DEMO with this complexity by adopting a contingency approach that seeks to iden-
tify major contingent variables that significantly shape entrepreneurial outcomes.
Sandberg and Hofer (1987), who also collected data via the venture capital route,
DEMO developed and tested a contingency model for predicting venture perform-
ance based upon characteristics of the entrepreneur, the structure of the industry
being entered, the venture strategy, and the interactive effects of these three fac-
DEMO Although their findings are based on a small sample and can be challenged
on statistical grounds, their results are nevertheless suggestive: the entrepreneur’s
DEMO appear to have little effect on venture performance, whereas the in-
DEMO between industry structure and strategy appear to be strongly associated
with performance. By using theory and inductive arguments to develop and test
hypotheses that DEMO the interaction of personal, environmental and strategic
variables on performance, Sandberg and Hofer take the research on strategic adap-
tation an important step DEMO Hopefully future studies of this type will follow.
Another emerging stream of strategy research seeks to determine what repeat-
edly successful entrepreneurs have learned DEMO experience. Lamont (1972)
initiated the first study of this type DEMO conducting a matched pair sample of 24
technology-based enterprises, half of DEMO were founded by individuals with no
previous entrepreneurial experience and half of which were founded by experi-
enced entrepreneurs. He found that the experienced DEMO tended to found
firms with a product orientation (as opposed to DEMO contract orientation), with larger
136    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
initial financing, DEMO with a better balance of business skills among the manage-
ment team. More recently, the notion that there is much to be learned by studying
repeatedly successful entrepreneurs was advocated by an individual who has him-
DEMO started over 30 new businesses over a 10-year period (Executive Forum.
DEMO). He contends that study of one-shot entrepreneurs will inevitably focus or
problems and obstacles that may simply be a product of inexperience. His DEMO
ment is that only multiple entrepreneurs can provide the base for a theory of entre-
preneurship since only they have developed an “experience curve.”
DEMO (1988) argued that such multiple entrepreneurs are more common
than previously supposed. In a sample of 1537 practicing and ex-entrepreneurs,
Ronstadt found DEMO 63% of the former and 40% of the latter were involved in the
creation of more than one venture. He suggested that the best DEMO venture opportuni-
ties are most often revealed only after an individual is already involved in a
start-up. This is due to the fact that DEMO the firm is initiated, greater information
becomes available about relevant contacts, viable markets, product availability,
competitive resources and response time.
A review of the strategic adaptation literature shows that progress is being
made. The DEMO conceptualizations have advanced from rather static, overly
generalized “key success factor” DEMO to contingency models that consider a
range of variables under varied circumstances and take into account the learning
effect of past efforts. In spite DEMO this progress, it is still surprising that so little
work has DEMO done in the area of entrepreneurship strategy. There are very few
good empirical studies, and those that exist are limited by small sample sizes.
Whether it is explicitly stated or not, the dominant assumption of the strategy
oriented literature is that success is primarily dependent upon the entrepreneur’s
DEMO to develop and execute effective strategies. The literature that adopts a
population ecology perspective offers a different point of view and will be dis-
DEMO next.
The Population Ecology Perspective
Hannan and Freeman’s 1977 article entitled “The Population Ecology of Organi-
zations” was a provocative piece that challenged many DEMO held by or-
ganizational researchers. The authors argued that most management theory over-
emphasizes the capacity of an organization to adapt to a changing DEMO In
contrast, they viewed inertia as a dominant organizational characteristic. Employ-
DEMO a biological analogy, they suggested that those organizations that are well
DEMO to their environment will survive, and those that are not will DEMO Through
this selection mechanism, the environment will determine the characteristics of
DEMO of organizations. The essence of the argument is that chance varia-
tions in organizational forms that are adaptive are selected for whereas nonadap-
tive DEMO are selected against.
Perhaps that best articulation of the application of ecological thinking to entre-
preneurship lies in the work of Greenfield and Strickon (1986). They argued that
contemporary paradigms in social science research and DEMO have become
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 137
static and therefore incapable of explaining dynamic social processes. As an alter-
native, they proposed a new paradigm that has its origins in Darwinian biology:
With respect to DEMO this means that we are no longer looking for
a transcendent type—the analogue of the immutable species— but instead
recognize existing diversity of behavior DEMO specific populations, which
at its extremes encompasses innovation and novelty. What DEMO called entre-
preneurship, from this point of view, is actually one segment of an otherwise
seamless variability. (p. 14)
Population ecology theory has significantly matured in recent years, developing
from a simplistic and deterministic biological metaphor into a rich theoretical
framework capable of incorporating other theoretical DEMO There have
been many attempts to reconcile population ecology with extant organizational
theory (Hannan & Freeman, 1984; Hrebiniak & Joyce, 1985; Singh, House, &
Tucker, 1986). One such attempt is by DEMO and Freeman (1980), who devel-
oped a particularly comprehensive model DEMO the organization creation process by
beginning with the population ecology model and incorporating elements of other
perspectives such as strategy and transaction cost economics. DEMO argued that
new opportunities are created for the expansion of existing and founding of new
organizations through technological or demographic change. These changes result
DEMO what they call “new resource sets.” Following Stinchcombe’s (1965) argument,
they suggested that knowledge of opportunity and access to requisite resources to
DEMO the opportunity are not uniformly distributed throughout the population.
Instead, opportunities DEMO most likely to come to individuals at key informational
loci within existing organizations. Depending on the nature of the existing organi-
zations, the new opportunity may be best exploited by a new firm.
Brittain and Freeman’s DEMO begins to connect the insights of the seemingly
disparate perspectives of population ecology and strategic adaptation. It directly
addresses the role of chance, and by emphasizing changing resource sets and the
replacement of short-term opportunities types DEMO firms (r strategists) with long-
term low cost producers (K DEMO), it is a dynamic model that explicitly deals
with ongoing change and competition.
In their study of organizational births and deaths in the DEMO industry,
Carroll and Delacroix argued that an ecological perspective should be concerned
with both foundings and mortality, and that each will be driven by different factors
(Carroll & Delacroix, 1982; Delacroix & Carroll, DEMO). This research raises an
important possibility: organizational births may better DEMO explained by macro vari-
ables such as technological or demographic shifts, DEMO survival of entrepre-
neurial firms may better be explained by micro variables such as strategy.
As the above studies have demonstrated, the strategic adaptation and population
ecology perspectives are not irreconcilable. One promising opportunity for com-
DEMO the insights of these perspectives lies in the study of industry evolution, or
the “community” level of analysis, as it has been labeled DEMO the ecologists (Astley,
1985; Carroll, 1984). A good DEMO is the work of Tushman and Anderson
(1986), who studied DEMO different industries and observed that technology
evolves “through periods of incremental change punctuated by technological
138    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
breakthroughs” (p. DEMO). They defined technological breakthroughs in Schumpete-
rian terms: “Major technological DEMO represent technical advance so sig-
nificant that no increase in scale, DEMO, or design can make older technolo-
gies competitive with the new DEMO (p. 441). They added an interesting
dimension by distinguishing between DEMO fundamentally different types of techno-
logical discontinuity: competence-enhancing and competence-destroying. A DEMO
petence-enhancing technological shift builds upon existing know-how (replacement
of mechanical typewriters DEMO electric), whereas with a competence-destroying
shift, existing know-how is largely DEMO (replacement of steam-engines by
diesel locomotives).
Tushman and Anderson found DEMO competence-destroying technological dis-
continuities favor the entrance of new firms into an industry because of the inabil-
ity of established competitors to exploit the DEMO technology. Competence-
enhancing discontinuities, on the other hand, work to the long-run advantage of
established firms who can use their resources and market DEMO to incorporate
the new technology. Thus the entrepreneurial firm that enters an industry via in-
cremental change or via the introduction of a new DEMO technol-
ogy is in far greater peril from existing competitors than one that enters via the in-
troduction of competence destroying technology.
This is DEMO example of how the ecological perspective can provide valuable in-
sight that can lead to more effective strategy formulation: an aggressive entry
strategy is more likely to succeed under conditions of a competence-destroying
discontinuity than under DEMO of a competence-enhancing discontinuity,
where competitors are in a strong position to retaliate.
Our review of the population ecology literature leads us to DEMO following com-
ment regarding future entrepreneurship research: In the past, much of the entre-
preneurship research has implicitly assumed a strategic adaptation perspective.
DEMO application of ecological thinking to entrepreneurship has challenged many
previously held assumptions, increased our understanding of the entrepreneurial
process, and demonstrated the significant DEMO of theory driven research. Ide-
ally, the example of population ecology DEMO encourage the exploration of other
theoretical perspectives that have the potential to provide insight into the entrepre-
neurship phenomenon.
Whether the strategic adaptation, population ecology, or some other perspective
or combination of perspectives is pursued, DEMO is clear that the field will be better
served in the future if the issue of theoretical perspective is addressed directly and
unstated assumptions DEMO avoided. Theory can then be tested and elaborated, and
from this, informed knowledge can be developed to aid the academic and the prac-
DEMO alike.
In this section we have highlighted one set of theoretical issues by contrasting
the strategic adaptation and population ecology perspectives. In the next DEMO,
on focus, we pursue a second, related set of issues by examining the trend toward
more contextual and process-oriented research.
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 139
Decision 3: Specification of DEMO
Early entrepreneurship studies typically focussed on the personality or cultural
background of the individual entrepreneur as a determinant of entrepreneurial be-
havior. Over time, these approaches yielded to a recognition that meaningful re-
search must adopt DEMO more contextual and process-oriented focus. This section will
review this progression toward richer and more dynamic approaches as a method
of highlighting the challenge DEMO “focus.”
Psychological Theories
McClelland’s work on “need for achievement” (McClelland, 1967) and an emp-
irical study of 150 successful Michigan entrepreneurs by Collins, Moore and
Unwalla (1964) were early works that started a prolific stream of personality-based
entrepreneurship research that continues to this day. Brockhaus (1982), Gasse
(1982), Martin (1984), and Sexton and Bowman (1985) have provided reviews of
this psychological/personality-based literature. Most of the comments in this sec-
tion are drawn from these reviews.
McClelland argued DEMO need for achievement is culturally acquired and a key
psychological characteristic of an entrepreneur. An individual with a high n-Ach is
characterized as (a) taking personal responsibility for decisions, (b) setting goals
and accomplishing DEMO through his/her effort, and (c) having a desire for DEMO
back (McClelland, 1967). The two basic problems with need for achievement are
first, the theory is as applicable to salespeople, professionals, and managers as
it is to entrepreneurs, and second, subsequent research DEMO not validated a link
between a high need for achievement and the decision to start a business (Sexton &
Bowman, 1985). McClelland’s more recent work has gone beyond need for achi-
evement and examined DEMO personality characteristics such as initiative, asser-
tiveness, efficiency orientation, systematic DEMO, and commitment to work
contract (McClelland, 1986). As with DEMO for achievement, these are not
unique to entrepreneurs, but instead characteristics common to many successful
individuals.
Internal locus of control is another characteristic DEMO has been attributed to en-
trepreneurs. This concept refers to the belief held by individuals that they can
largely determine their fate through their DEMO behavior. However, internal locus
of control has proved to be no DEMO useful than need for achievement in differen-
tiating the entrepreneur from the non-entrepreneur (Brockhaus, 1982; Sexton and
Bowman, 1985; Gasse, 1982)DEMO Brockhaus concluded that although a high internal
locus of control is common to both successful managers and successful entrepre-
neurs, it may still hold “promise for distinguishing successful entrepreneurs from
the unsuccessful” (p. 45).
A high risk-taking propensity is another psychological characteristic often
attributed to entrepreneurs. Although DEMO of the empirical findings are con-
tradictory (see Sexton & Bowman, 1985), the overall evidence is that entrepre-
neurs are moderate risk DEMO and do not significantly differ from managers or
even the general population. It is perhaps more insightful to view entrepreneurs
140    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
as capable risk managers whose abilities defuse what others might view as high
risk situations.
DEMO psychological characteristic that does appear to distinguish the entre-
preneurial personality is the tolerance for ambiguity. Studies by Schere (1982)
and Sexton and Bowman (1985) have indicated that entrepreneurs have a
significantly greater capacity DEMO tolerate ambiguity than do managers. Other
personality characteristics that have been argued to distinguish between entre-
preneurs and managers are a high need for DEMO, dominance, independ-
ence combined with a low need for support and conformity, and a capacity for
endurance (see Sexton & Bowman, 1985).
Definitional and methodological problems associated with these past psycho-
logical studies, such as noncomparable samples, bias toward successful entre-
preneurs, and the DEMO that observed entrepreneurial traits are the product
of entrepreneurial experience, make DEMO difficult to interpret the results. Further-
more, at a more fundamental DEMO, it can be argued that the wide variations
among entrepreneurs make DEMO attempt to develop a standard psychological
profile futile. One is struck by the appropriateness of Gartner’s (1985a) obser-
vation that there is as DEMO difference among entrepreneurs as between entre-
preneurs and non-entrepreneurs.5
Some researchers have used personality traits to identify different entrepreneu-
rial types. Smith (1967) DEMO between crafts and opportunistic types.
Stanworth and Curran (1976) specified 3 types: the artisan, the classical and the
manager. Webster (1977) DEMO 5 categories of entrepreneurs, Vesper (1980)
listed 11 different types and Gartner developed 8 entrepreneurial archetypes
(Gartner, 1983). These studies DEMO interesting reading, but as with the other per-
sonality-based literature discussed DEMO far, it is questionable whether these descrip-
tive studies move us DEMO toward a theory of entrepreneurship.
Demographic studies of entrepreneurship suffer from some of the same prob-
lems as the psychological/personality literature. Most of DEMO empirical work that
examines the demographic characteristics of entrepreneurs suffers from small
sample sizes, non-comparability of samples and static terms of reference. The
most comprehensive study to date is by Cooper and Dunkelberg (1987). They col-
lected broadly based data on 890 entrepreneurs and contrasted their findings DEMO
earlier research using smaller samples. They confirmed that entrepreneurs tend to
be better educated, come from families where the parents owned a business, DEMO
firms related to their previous work and locate where they are already living and
working. In other ways, however, the entrepreneurs in their DEMO were less dif-
ferent than previous research has indicated, “being no DEMO likely to be of for-
eign-stock and not being particularly likely to leave school early or to drift from
job to job” (p. 21) than the general population. Cooper and Dunkelberg concluded
5 There are some interesting parallels that can be made between the personality-based entrepreneur-
ship research DEMO the studies that sought to identify leadership traits. Theories of leadership progressed
from simple “trait” theories through two-dimensional personal-behavioral approaches and on to highly
DEMO models that; considered a variety of forces at work within the DEMO, the situation, and the
subordinate. As we shall see, entrepreneurship DEMO has followed a similar pattern to become much
more contextual and dynamic.
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 141
that diversity seems to be a central characteristic of their sample. This is our con-
clusion as DEMO: being innovators and idiosyncratic, entrepreneurs tend to defy ag-
gregation. They tend to reside at the tails of population distributions, and though
they may be expected to differ from the mean, the nature of these differences are
not predictable. It seems that any attempt to profile the DEMO entrepreneur is in-
herently futile.
More useful are recent psychological studies that focus on the entrepreneur
within an organizational context. Schein (1983) examined DEMO role of the founde in
creating organizational culture. According to Schein, DEMO “typically . . .
have strong assumptions about the nature of the world, the role their organizations
will play in that world, the DEMO of human nature, truth, relationships, time and
space” (p. 17). Schein examined the process by which the assumptions and theo-
ries DEMO the founders interacted with the organization’s own experiences to deter-
mine culture. Kets de Vries (1985) focussed on dysfunctional entrepreneurial per-
sonality characteristics DEMO examining the negative repercussions of need for
control, sense of distrust, desire for applause, and psychological coping mecha-
nisms demonstrated by some entrepreneurs. This article was the result of studies
done in collaboration with Miller DEMO sought to link executive personality with
strategy and organizational structure (Kets DEMO Vries & Miller, 1984, 1986). Kets
de Vries and Miller developed a typology of pathological organizations and their
most recent work examined DEMO as the link between personality and strategy.
The work by Schein and by Kets de Vries and Miller is important because it
does not DEMO simply on the psychology of the entrepreneur, but focuses instead
on DEMO relationship between the entrepreneur and the organization and on the proc-
ess by which individual characteristics affect organizational outcomes. The focus
of these most DEMO psychological studies is clearly more contextual and proc-
ess-oriented than the earlier work.
Social-Cultural Theories
One of the earliest and best known attempts to DEMO entrepreneurship to the larger
social context was Weber’s classic work “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
Capitalism” (1930). Weber argued that the rise of Protestantism encouraged hard
work, thrift, and striving for material DEMO, which in turn gave rise to
capitalism. Although the causal effects DEMO the Protestant ethic on the development
of capitalism have since been hotly contested, it does seem clear that the rise of
Protestantism swept away many institutional obstacles that were preventing the
development of capitalism. Our conclusion DEMO that there must be congruence be-
tween ideological constructs and economic behavior if entrepreneurship is to
flourish.
The tendency of certain cultures to produce DEMO has made it intui-
tively appealing to view culture as a determinant of entrepreneurship. Hagen
(1960) explained entrepreneurial behavior as a means by DEMO disadvantaged mi-
norities seek to alter the status quo. Some examples are the Dissenters in England,
the Protestants in France, the Samurai in Japan, the Jews in many countries, and
the Parsees in India (Greenfield & Strickon, 1981). This perspective is continued
142    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
today in the work of Brenner (1987), who argued that it is those groups that have
lost or face the prospect of losing social status that DEMO driven to take entrepreneu-
rial risks. Although there may be some validity to these assertions, some contra-
dictory evidence does exist (Shapero & DEMO, 1982). The recent entrepreneurial
proliferation associated with Silicon Valley (Stanford and Berkeley graduates) and
Route 128 (Harvard and MIT graduates) demonstrates that not all entrepreneurs
come from disadvantaged backgrounds. The best that can DEMO said with confidence
is that in some cases entrepreneurship is a response to lack of social mobility
through other channels.
Studies in the 1960s DEMO Cochran (1965) and Alexander (1967) recognized the
complex economic, DEMO, and psychological factors that impact the entrepreneu-
rial process. However, it was Glade (1967) that really set the stage for the types DEMO
contextual models currently advocated. Glade viewed the entrepreneur as a deci-
sion maker operating within a specific social and cultural setting. He termed this
DEMO an “opportunity structure,” implying both the perception and existence of
an opportunity combined with the availability of resources: “Integral features of
any given situation are both an ‘objective’ structure of economic opportunity and a
structure DEMO differential advantage in the capacity of the system’s participants to
perceive and act upon such opportunities” (p. 251).
More recently, Vesper (1983), Martin (1984), and Shapero and Sokol (1982) all
developed models of venture initiation that build upon this idea. The Shapero and
DEMO model is perhaps the most sophisticated model of entrepreneurial event
formation in the Glade tradition. It identifies life-path changes, perceptions of
desirability, and DEMO of feasibility as variables leading to new company
formation. Their model considers the interaction of many situational and cultural
factors and provides a dynamic DEMO that captures the range of positive pulls
and negative displacements leading to the start-up of a business.
Network Theories
Recent studies that have examined DEMO are more refined attempts to place
the entrepreneur within a social context. Birley (1985) studied the role of networks
in the founding of DEMO firms by sampling 160 firms in Indiana. She differentiated
between two kinds of networks: informal (family, friends, business) and formal
(banks, accountants, lawyers, SBA) and found that entrepreneurs rely heavily on
the informal network, but seldom tap into the formal network. MacMillan (1983)DEMO
argued that there is a distinct manipulative aspect of networks. In a small sample
longitudinal study he identified the critical role played by deliberate DEMO
building in the launch of eight start-ups.
The importance of networks has been reflected in a growing interest in “incuba-
tors.” An incubator may DEMO a formally organized facility offering laboratory and
office space, support services, technical and business consulting services, and con-
tact with other entrepreneurs (DEMO & Gill, 1986), or may simply be the organi-
zation DEMO the entrepreneur worked prior to launching a venture, The most
famous DEMO of a firm acting as an incubator for entrepreneurial spinoffs is
Fairchild, which spawned at least 35 companies (Vesper, 1983). Studies of such
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 143
incubator organizations have shown that high-tech entrepreneurs tend to locate
themselves in the same area as their DEMO employer and develop products that
are closely related to their prior organizations (Cooper, 1986).
The understanding of networks was further advanced by DEMO and Zimmer
(1986), who viewed the entrepreneurial process as embedded DEMO a shifting net-
work of continuing social relations that facilitate and constrain “linkages be-
tween aspiring entrepreneurs, resources and opportunities” (pp. 8–9). DEMO
contended that new business formation is part of an evolutionary processes of
“variation, selection, retention, and diffusion and the struggle for existence”
(DEMO 9). Though recognizing that individuals are intentional or purposeful in their
actions, they argued that the growing evidence of cognitive limits on human be-
havior and the “powerful influence of social factors on cognitions and DEMO
processing” means that one cannot attribute new business formation to individual
acts (p. 6). For Aldrich and Zimmer, the entrepreneurial process takes DEMO meaning
only in the context of the broader social processes that they described.
These recent studies demonstrate how the focus of entrepreneurship research
has DEMO to become more contextual and process oriented. Several authors
have suggested frameworks for capturing this contextual complexity. Gartner
(1985a) suggested a conceptual framework DEMO describing the phenomenon of new
venture creation that identified the similarities and differences between ventures.
His framework “integrates four major perspectives in entrepreneurship: character-
istics of the individual(s) who start the venture, the organization DEMO they create,
the environment surrounding the new venture, and the DEMO by which the new
venture is started” (p. 696). Carsrud, Olm, and Eddy (1986) suggested a similar
model, one that DEMO the interaction between psychological, personal/
demographic, organizational, and situation/DEMO variables on the venture
creation process.
This section has reviewed a range of entrepreneurship literature from the per-
spective of focus. There is strong DEMO of a trend toward research with a more
contextual and process-oriented focus. Research has progressed beyond determi-
nistic personality and cultural theories toward more DEMO and dynamic
theories. The challenge for future entrepreneurship research is to continue this
trend and move toward explaining rather than merely documenting the entrepre-
DEMO phenomenon.
Decision 4: Specification of Level of Analysis
Given our earlier DEMO about the general purpose of entrepreneurship
research, it follows that we DEMO interested in all entrepreneurial phenomena that
impact economic progress. This means we may be concerned with the fate of the
individual entrepreneur, the progress of an entire industry, or the impact of that
industry on society as a whole. Thus researchers may choose among five levels of
analysis: individual, group, organizational, industry and societal levels. Most of
the research to date has been at a single level of analysis. However, two recent
144    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
studies illustrate just how much can be gained by attempting a richer, albeit more
difficult multi-level research design.
The first is a study by Van de Ven, Hudson and Schroeder (1984) that examined
the start-up of 14 educational DEMO companies. The firms were divided into
high and low performers based on a composite measure of success. Key variables
from three different levels of DEMO were examined for their impact on success.
The three levels of entrepreneurial (characteristics of the founding individual), or-
ganizational (planning and initial DEMO processes of the firm) and ecologi-
cal (industry as a whole).
The Van de Ven et al. study is exemplary in its DEMO of the literature to identify
key variables for investigation at each level of analysis. At the entrepreneurial
level, the authors concluded that success was related to education and experience,
internal locus of control and risk DEMO, a broad and clear business idea, and
personal investment. At the organizational level, success was positively related to
planning activities (although ironically, spending time on a detailed business plan
seemed to result in poorer DEMO), small scale startup, incremental expan-
sion, single person command, DEMO active involvement of top management and
board members in decision making. At the ecological level, the study suggested
that assistance from a corporate sponsor in the form of equity capital, training, or
guaranteed contracts was DEMO maladaptive, and that firms competing for con-
tracts on an independent DEMO advanced more quickly, at least over the short run.
Aldrich and DEMO (1986) provide a second example of a multi-level research
design. They built upon Stinchcombe’s work and argued that the “strengths of
large, old organizations are often the weaknesses of small, new organizations and
vice versa” (p. 165). For smaller and newer organizations they looked at various
strategies such as franchising, long-term contracts, and mergers and acquisitions to
DEMO the liabilities of newness and smallness. For larger and older organizations,
they examined strategies of franchising, mergers and acquisitions, subcontracting, and
corporate venturing to overcome the liabilities of oldness and largeness. The connec-
tion DEMO different levels of analysis was made through the observation that
adaptive strategies at the organizational level result in new “forms” at the indus-
try DEMO that improve the viability of whole populations of organizations.
The relationships between phenomena that can be observed at different levels of
analysis are important DEMO just for academics, but for both practitioners and public
policy makers DEMO well. From the entrepreneur’s perspective, the success of the
individual enterprise DEMO be affected by factors that can only be observed at dif-
ferent levels of analysis. To miss any one of these perspectives increases the DEMO
ability that key factors will be overlooked, and that unanticipated events DEMO take
the entrepreneur by surprise. From the public policy maker’s perspective, DEMO in-
sights generated by multi-level studies have the potential to improve targeting of
government efforts to encourage successful entrepreneurship.
The two studies discussed above DEMO that each level of analysis pro-
vides unique insight and that the synthesis of these insights yields a richer under-
standing than that possible DEMO the perspective of a single level of analysis. The
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 145
challenge for entrepreneurship research is to increase the incorporation of multiple
levels of analysis into future research DEMO
Decision 5: Specification of Time Frame
A key building block for DEMO the pattern of new business formation is
the notion that start-ups move through predictable stages. The fact that this pattern
can only be observed DEMO wide time frame research is the key thrust of this
section. Other issues related to longitudinal research will be discussed in the final
section DEMO methodology.
Most of the studies that focus on stages in the start-up of an enterprise are varia-
tions on a theme. Although typically arranging DEMO stages in natural order, most
theorists note that the stages need DEMO be strictly sequential, nor can they be dealt
with in isolation. DEMO of the more detailed works (Swayne & Tucker, 1973) listed
DEMO steps in three overall stages of concept, planning and implementation. A DEMO
cent review by Gartner (1985a) of the work of eight researchers identified six
common actions undertaken in the entrepreneurial process: locating a business op-
portunity, accumulating resources, marketing products and services, producing the
product, building an organization, and responding to government and society.
Stevenson et DEMO (1985) identified five steps in the start-up: evaluating the opportu-
DEMO, developing the business concept, assessing required resources, acquiring
needed resources, and managing and harvesting the business.
Block and MacMillan (1985) focussed DEMO the planning for a launch and sug-
gested that there are critical milestones in a start-up. They argued that a new ven-
ture is DEMO experiment with implicit hypotheses or assumptions about the relations
among product, DEMO, and competition that can only be tested through experi-
ence. Block DEMO MacMillan suggested that go/no-go or redirection decisions be
made at each of ten milestones, based upon emerging information that becomes
available as each milestone is reached.
From the point of view of advancing theory, studies that merely document the
stages of a start-up are of questionable value. DEMO, identifying the major tasks
that need to be accomplished during the DEMO of a venture has practical value;
furthermore, the notion that DEMO start-up moves through discrete stages is an insight
that must be incorporated into any theory of new venture creation.
Although the above researchers focus DEMO the stages of start-up, other researchers
use still longer time frames DEMO focus on major stages of growth in fully launched
organizations. Greiner (DEMO) identified five distinguishable phases of devel-
opment, each characterized by “evolutionary” periods of relative calm followed
by “revolutionary” periods of management crisis and DEMO This ap-
proach was furthered by Churchill and Lewis (1983), DEMO Hambrick and
Crozier (1985) and bears similarity to the “life-cycle” work of Kimberly and
Miles (1980). These works go beyond the start-up phase and demonstrate that
different management and strategic issues become paramount at DEMO stages of
development. Robinson and Pearce (1986) took the analysis one step further with a
comprehensive study of the relation between venture performance DEMO different
146    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
stages of development and the attention given to strategic and operational deci-
sions. They showed DEMO as the firm evolves, each state calls for emphasis on dif-
DEMO strategic activities.
Short time frame studies are simpler to design and easier to execute but clearly
lack the richness of insight that results from DEMO a phenomenon over a longer
time period. For entrepreneurship research this is extremely important, since new
firms are extremely fragile and experience many changes within short periods of
time. Often the seeds of future problems are DEMO in the early stages. Only wide
time frame studies will allow us to study the development problems faced by new
firms and to pursue DEMO objective of causal inference.
Decision 6: Specification of Methodology
As entrepreneurship DEMO as a recognized area of inquiry, the quality and use-
fulness DEMO the theory that is developed will be tied to the ability of researchers to
identify patterns of causality. Early efforts in entrepreneurship research were DEMO
derstandably exploratory case studies or cross sectional statistical studies of the
“census-taking” type. However, if such exploratory studies are successful, they
should be DEMO by more systematic studies that subject a priori hypotheses to
formal testing and work toward the development of theory.
Unfortunately, the progress toward a priori hypothesis testing has been slow.
The current standard appears to be DEMO collection and a posteriori statistical test-
ing. Still, there has been DEMO progress in terms of building upon previous re-
search and designing more rigorous studies. For example, in measuring the contri-
bution of entrepreneurship to economic progress, Birley (1987) and Reynolds
(1987) built upon the earlier work of Birch (1979), with their analyses character-
ized by much greater precision. In Reynolds’ case, he used regression and dis-
criminant analyses to distinguish between factors related to the social contribution
of new DEMO and factors related to their survival. A further example is Khan
(DEMO), whose study of the effectiveness of venture capital decision making went
beyond simple additive regression approaches (MacMillan et al. 1987) and em-
DEMO non-compensatory decision modelling.
The goal of establishing causal linkages among variables means that more lon-
gitudinal work is necessary. Longitudinal studies are inevitably more DEMO and
expensive than cross sectional studies, but the benefits are considerable. DEMO good
examples of longitudinal studies are Hambrick and Crozier’s (1985) examination
of the difficulties of managing rapid growth firms, and Tushman, Virany DEMO
Romanelli’s (1986) study of a cohort of minicomputer firms over a protracted time
period. Following a group of firms over time is expensive DEMO time consuming,
but it is important to recognize that only such large scale cross sectional and longi-
tudinal studies can start to provide DEMO with enough confidence about causality to
provide the basis for theoretical model building and experimental research.
To date the attempts to develop formal methods DEMO been limited. Baumol
(1982) developed a theoretical model describing the influences that determine the
supply of entrepreneurship and its influence on economic growth. DEMO and
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 147
Laffont (1979) proposed an entrepreneurship-based theory of competitive equilib-
rium by building upon Knight’s (1921) DEMO of risk. Casson (1982) developed
an economic theory of entrepreneurship within the neoclassical framework. These
attempts at formal model building hold promise, but pale compared to the sophis-
tication of the models used in other DEMO Until progress is made in the develop-
ment of rigorous models of the entrepreneurial process, our ability to generate
theory will be severely circumscribed.
If attempts at formal model building have been limited, attempts at experimen-
tation have been rare. Worthy of note are two studies – the DEMO of simulation tech-
niques to study venture capital investment effectiveness by Stevenson, Muzycka,
and Timmons (1987) and the experimental study by Kourilsky (1980) that exam-
ined the entrepreneurial behavior of children in a DEMO economy. The lack of
experimental research is a further indication of slow progress in developing entre-
preneurship theory.
It is interesting to note that DEMO studies cited above stem from a variety of disci-
plinary backgrounds: DEMO and Crozier from strategy; Reynolds from sociol-
ogy; Kourilsky from education; Kihlstrom and Laffont, Baumol, and Casson from
economics. Other disciplines that have contributed to the study of entrepreneur-
ship include anthropology (Owens, DEMO), marketing (Dickson & Giglierano,
1986), psychology (Brockhaus, DEMO), history (Cochran 1965), finance (Huntsman
& Hoban, 1980), and political science (Gatewood, Hoy & Spindler, 1984). This
DEMO of approaches and methods is to be encouraged, for entrepreneurship is
DEMO varied as it is elusive, and the range of research methods DEMO match the
complexity of the phoneomenon under study.
Our review of the literature leads us to suggest that there is a need to pursue
DEMO more aggressively. The field must move to the stage where exploratory
case analyses or cross sectional census taking studies that are not theory driven
DEMO do not test hypotheses are no longer acceptable.
Implications for Entrepreneurs
This review has focussed on issues of research design and is primarily targeted DEMO
an academic audience. This approach reflects the belief that useful knowledge for
practice will only result from the pursuit of rigorous research and the DEMO
of entrepreneurship theory. For those who do not share this view, DEMO is no
shortage of anecdotal “how to” books to which they may refer.
Even though this review has focussed on research design issues, several important
implications for practice have been raised. At the most general level, the design is-
sues raised in this paper can serve as criteria DEMO sifting through the vast amount of
popular and academic literature dealing with entrepreneurship. In much of this litera-
ture the practitioner is advised to DEMO out for the same inappropriate generalizations
and misleading assumptions about causality that we caution academics to beware.
Although past attempts to stereotype entrepreneurs based DEMO psychological
and cultural characteristics have been discredited, recent work suggests that DEMO
preneurs’ personalities do have important influences on the organizations they
148    Murray B. Low and Ian C. MacMillan
create (Kets DEMO Vries, 1985; Schein, 1983). The behaviors and values of DEMO entre-
preneur interact with the experiences of the unfolding organization to imprint its
culture. In turn, organizational culture has important implications for the perform-
ance. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to be aware of how their behavior shapes DEMO
emerging culture. We by no means suggest that entrepreneurs try to change their
personalities, but it may be possible for them to be alert for and avoid behaviors
that have dysfunctional organizational consequences.
The literature makes DEMO clear that opportunities do not drop from the sky. Oppor-
tunities are created within and among existing organizations as a product of ongo-
ing DEMO of relationships and exchanges. Opportunities come most frequently
to people located at advantageous positions within networks. Furthermore, ex-
ploiting an opportunity requires certain resources (human resources, capital, mar-
keting and technical information, sales etc.)DEMO The same types of network relation-
ships and contacts needed to identify opportunities are also necessary to obtain the
resources required to exploit opportunities. DEMO entrepreneurs are advised to
evaluate and map their current networks. Doing so is the first step toward building
an effective network, an activity that is too important to be left to chance.
It is also clear DEMO the literature that there are no magic formulae for success.
Each venture will have its own key success factors, any one of which will be suf-
ficient to kill the venture if overlooked. Some important items DEMO consideration
are the following: Is there an established market for the DEMO? Is the market de-
fensible? Is the strategy appropriate for the industry structure?
Although planning is important, spending too much time on a detailed business
plan can be counterproductive. And though assistance from a DEMO sponsor is
usually thought to be helpful, evidence suggests that firms DEMO for contracts
on an independent basis advance more quickly (Van de DEMO et al. 1984). For tech-
nologically innovative ventures, it is DEMO to establish whether the innovation
can easily be adopted by established competitors (Tushman & Anderson, 1986). If
so, a long range objective might be to be acquired by an existing firm. If not, an
aggressive share-building strategy might be most appropriate.
The ecology literature suggests that DEMO is also a matter of chance, and
that one needs some DEMO This is true, but it is also possible to shape luck-by
DEMO networks, by exercising parsimony of investment, by seeking competi-
tively insulated niches, by moving incrementally, and by continually monitor-
ing performance. This DEMO conserves resources, heightens awareness of
developing trends and maintains the flexibility DEMO to quickly respond to
new opportunities.
Finally, start-ups move through distinct DEMO, with different management and
strategic issues paramount in each phase. Effort DEMO be taken to ensure that re-
sources are spent on the areas most critical to the firm’s success, given its stage of
development. And care must be exercised to think through how short-term actions
might be DEMO the seeds of future problems.
Entrepreneurship: Past Research and Future Challenges 149
Summary and Recommendations
We have reviewed the literature in the context of the challenges faced when de-
DEMO an entrepreneurship research program. In the course of this review, we
DEMO to the conclusions that are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in greater
detail below:
1. Purpose. There is a need for future DEMO programs to include a clear state-
ment of purpose. Furthermore, we DEMO to researchers to link the specific pur-
pose of their study to the more fundamental purpose we have proposed: to explain
and facilitate the role of new enterprise in furthering economic progress. It is
hoped that DEMO linking to this overall purpose, a wide variety of research activities
DEMO be brought into a broad but unifying arena.
2. Theoretical Perspective. In the past, much of the entrepreneurship literature
has implicitly assumed a strategic adaptation perspective. The insights resulting
from recent work using the population ecology DEMO has challenged some
of these assumptions and demonstrated the benefits of theory driven research. We
suggest that future research should examine and clearly state DEMO assump-
tions and that additional theoretical perspectives should be explored.
3. Focus. Recently, there has been a trend toward more contextual and process
oriented research. This is an important advancement and moves the field closer to
DEMO position of being able to explain rather than merely document the entrepreneurial
phenomenon. Future research should continue this trend.
4. Level of analysis. There DEMO been a welcome initiation of studies that exam-
ined more than one of the individual, group, organization, industry, and society
levels of DEMO Such multi-level studies provide a much richer understanding of
the entrepreneurial phenomenon and should therefore be encouraged in future re-
search programs.

5. Time frame. It appears that greater insights can be obtained from studies
which employ DEMO time frames than from studies employing cross sectional
“snapshots.” A push towards longer time frame studies is desirable, particularly
since it is becoming clear that different strategic issues become important as firm
and industry evolve.
6. DEMO There has been disappointingly slow progress in research that ad-
dresses issues of causality, perhaps reflecting the elusiveness of the entreprenurial
phenomenon. Recent years have seen only limited examples of research designs that
develop a priori DEMO Consequently, formal modelling and experimental re-
search have lacked a foundation DEMO development. On the positive side, the incidence
of studies that are DEMO cross sectional and longitudinal are on the rise.
In closing we wish to be realistic. Clearly it is unrealistic to expect that future
research DEMO will incorporate all the qualities we have suggested. Very few re-
searchers have sufficient resources to design and execute projects that are theory
driven, choose a contextual and process-oriented focus, adopt multiple levels of
analysis, DEMO employ wide time frames. Indeed, although we have been arguing
that DEMO research needs to move in a particular direction, we accept
the DEMO that there are unavoidable tradeoffs in research and that there is no single
best approach (McGrath, 1964; Weick, 1979). However, we do suggest that more
meaningful and insightful results will be forthcoming if DEMO consider these
design issues and eschew research program designs in which all of the easy design
alternatives are selected.
