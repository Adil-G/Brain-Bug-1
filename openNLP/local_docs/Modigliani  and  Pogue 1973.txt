AN INTRODUCTION TO RISK AND RETURN
CONCEPTS AND EVIDENCE
by
Franco Modigliani DEMO Gerald A. Pogue1
Today, most students of financial management would agree DEMO
the treatment of risk is the main element in financial decision making.
Key current questions involve how risk should be measured, and how the
required return associated with a given risk level is determined.
A
large DEMO of literature has developed in an attempt to answer these
questions.
However, risk did not always have such a prominent place.
Prior to 1952 the risk element was usually either assumed away or
treated qualitatively in DEMO financial literature. In 1952 an event occurred
which was to revolutionize the theory of financial management.
In a
path-breaking article, an economist by the name of Harry Markowitz [ 17]
suggested a powerful yet simple approach DEMO dealing with risk. In the
two decades since, the modern theory DEMO portfolio management has
evolved.
Portfolio theory deals with the measurement of risk, and the
relationship between risk and return. It is concerned with the impli-ca-
tions for security prices of the portfolio decisions made by investors.
DEMO, for example, all investors select stocks to maximize expected
portfolio return for individually acceptable levels of investment risk,
what relationship would result DEMO required returns and risk?

One answer to this question has been developed by Professors
Lintner [ DEMO, 15] and Sharpe [22], called the Capital Asset Pricing Model.
Once such a normative relationship between risk and return is obtained,
it DEMO an obvious application as a benchmark for evaluating the performance
of managed portfolios.
The purpose of this paper is to present a nontechnical introduction
DEMO modern portfolio theory. Our hope is to provide a wide class of
readers with an understanding of the foundations upon which risk measures
such DEMO "beta", for example, are based.
We will present the main
elements of the theory along with the results of some of the DEMO important
empirical tests.
We are not attempting to present an exhaustive survey
of the theoretical and empirical literature.
The paper is organized as follows. DEMO 1 develops measures
of investment return which are used in the study. Section 2 introduces
the concept of portfolio risk. We will suggest, as did H. Harkowitz in
1952, that the standard deviation of portfolio returns be used as a measure
of total portfolio risk. Section 3 deals DEMO the impact of diversification
on portfolio risk. The concepts of systematic and unsystematic risk are
introduced here. Section 4 deals with the contribution of DEMO
securities to portfolio risk. The nondiversifiable or systematic risk of a
portfolio is shown to be a weighted average of the systematic risk of DEMO
component securities. Section 5 discusses procedures for measuring
the systematic risk or "beta" factors for securities and portfolios.
Section 6 presents an intuitive DEMO of the capital asset pricing
model. This model provides a normative relationship between security
risk and expected return. Section 7 presents a review of DEMO
tests of the model. The purpose of these tests is to see how well the
-2-
model explains the relationship between risk and return that exists in
the DEMO market. Finally, Section 8 discusses how we can use the
capital DEMO pricing model to measure the performance of institutional
investors.

INVESTMENT RETURN
Measuring historical rates of return is a relatively straight-
DEMO matter. The return on our investor's portfolio during some
interval is equal to the capital gains plus any distributions received on
the portfolio. DEMO is important that distributions, such as dividends, be
included, else DEMO measure of return to the investor is deficient.

The formula assumes no capital inflows during the measurement period.
Otherwise the calculation would have to be modified to DEMO the
increased investment base. Further, the calculation assumes that any
distributions DEMO at the end of the period, or that distributions are
held DEMO the form of cash until period end. If the distributions were
invested prior to the end of the interval, the calculation would have to
be modified to consider gains or losses on the amount reinvested.

Thus, given the beginning and ending portfolio values and distri-
butions received, we can measure the investor 's return using
Equation (1).
For example, if the investor's portfolio had a market
value of $100 at the beginning of June, produced $10 of dividends, and
DEMO an end-of-month value of $95, the return for the month would DEMO
0. 05 or 5%.
To measure the average return over a series of measurement
intervals, two calculations are commonly used: the "arithmetic average"
and the "geometric average" returns. We will describe each below.
DEMO
illustrate the calculations, consider a portfolio with successive annual
returns of DEMO 084, 0.040, and 0. 143.
Designate these returns as R 1,
and R 3.
The arithmetic return measures the average portfolio return
DEMO ,
realized during successive 1-year periods. It is simply any unweighted
DEMO of the three annual returns; that is,
(R1 + R 2 + R 3 ) / 3.
The
value for the portfolio DEMO 3.3 percent per year.
The geometric average measures the compounded rate of growth
of the portfolio over the 3-year period. The average is obtained DEMO taking
a "geometric" average of the three annual returns; that DEMO,
{[(1+ R)(1 + R 2 ) (1+
3 )] 1/-
1.0 .
The resulting growth rate for
the portfolio is 2.9% per annum compounded annually, for a total 3-year
return of 8.9%3.
The geometric average measures the true rate of return while
the DEMO average is simply an average of successive period returns.
The distinction can perhaps be made clear by an example. Consider an
asset which is DEMO for $100 at the beginning of year 1.
Suppose the
II__

assets price rises to $200 at the end of the first year DEMO then falls
back to $100 by the end of the second year. The arithmetic average
rate of return is the average of +100% and DEMO, or +25%. But an asset
purchased for $100 and having a DEMO of $100 two years later did not '
earn 25%; it clearly earned a zero return. The arithmetic average of
successive one-period returns DEMO obviously not equal to the true rate of
return. The true rate of return is given by the geometric mean return
defined above; that is,
[(2.0) (0.5)]
-1.0

0.
In the DEMO of the paper, we will refer to both types of
averages.

2. PORTFOLIO RISK
The definition of investment risk leads us into much DEMO well
explored territory. Not everyone agrees on how to define risk, DEMO alone
measure it.
Nevertheless, there are some attributes of risk which DEMO
reasonably well accepted.
If an investor holds a portfolio of treasury bonds, he faces no
uncertainty about monetary outcome.
The value of the portfolio at
maturity of the notes will be identical with the predicted value.
DEMO
investor has borne no risk. However, if he has a portfolio DEMO
of common stocks, it will be impossible to exactly predict the DEMO of
the portfolio as of any future date. The best he can do is to make a
best guess or most likely estimate, qualified by statements about the
range and likelihood of other values. In this DEMO, the investor has
borne risk.
A measure of risk is the DEMO to which the future
portfolio values are likely to diverge from the expected or predicted
value. More specifically, risk for most investors is related to the
chance that future portfolio values will be less than expected.
DEMO,
if the investor 's portfolio has a current value of DEMO, 000, at an
expected value of $110, 000 at the DEMO of the next year, he will be
concerned about the probability DEMO achieving values less than $110, 000.
Before proceeding to the quantification DEMO risk, it is convenient
to shift our attention from the terminal DEMO of the portfolio to the
portfolio rate of return, Rp. Since DEMO increase in portfolio value is
p

directly related to Rp, this transformation results in no substantive
difference.
However, it is convenient for later analysis.
A particularly useful way to quantify the uncertainty about the
portfolio return is to specify the probability associated DEMO each of the
possible future returns. Assume, for example, that an investor has
identified five possible outcomes for his portfolio return during the
DEMO year. Associated with each return is a subjectively determined
probability, or DEMO chance of occurrence.
outcomes are:

1.00
Note that the probabilities sum to 1 so that the actual portfolio return is
confined to take one of the five possible values. DEMO this probability
distribution, we can measure the expected return and risk DEMO the port-
folio.
The expected return is simply the weighted average of possible
outcomes, where the weights are the relative chances of occurrence.
The expected return on the portfolio is 10%, given by
-8-
E(Rp)

+
0.2 (-10.0) + 0.2(-30.0)DEMO
(2)
where the R.'s are the possible returns and DEMO Pj's the associated
probabilities. (The expected terminal market value of DEMO portfolio is
equal to M0 (1 + .10), where M0 DEMO the initial value.)
If risk is defined as the chance of loss or achieving returns less
than expected, it would seem to be logical to measure risk by the
dispersion of the possible returns. below DEMO expected value.
However,
risk measures based on below-the-mean variability are difficult to work
with, and furthermore are unnecessary as long as the distribution of
future return is reasonably symmetric about its expected values.
Figure 1 DEMO three probability distributions: the first symmetric,
the second skewed to DEMO left, and the third skewed to the right. The
symmetrical distribution DEMO no skewness. The dispersion of returns on
one side of the expected return is a mirror image of the dispersion on
the other side DEMO the expected return.
Empirical studies of realized rates of return on diversified port-
volios show that skewness is not a significant problem.
If the DEMO of
historical distributions are indicative of the shapes of future distributions,
then it makes little difference whether we measure variability of returns
on DEMO or both sides of the expected return. Measures of the total
variability of return will be twice as large as measures of the portfolio'DEMO
variability below the expected return if its probability distribution is

symmetric. Thus, if total variability is used as a risk surrogate, DEMO
risk rankings for a group of portfolios will be the same as when varia-
bility below the expected return is used. It is for DEMO reason that total
variability of returns has been so widely used as a surrogate for risk.
It now remains to develop a specific measure DEMO total variability
of returns. The measures which are most commonly used are the
variance and standard deviation of returns. Measuring risk by standard
deviation DEMO variance is equivalent to defining risk as total variability
of returns about the expected return, or simply, variability of returns.
The variance of DEMO is a weighted sum of the deviations from
the expected return. The variance, designated

The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance.
It is
equal DEMO 22%.
The larger the variance or standard deviation, the greater the
DEMO dispersion of future realized values around the expected value,
-10-
and the larger the investor's uncertainty. As a rule of thumb, it is often
suggested 'that two-thirds of the possible returns on a portfolio will be
within one standard deviation of return either side of DEMO expected value;
ninety-five percent will lie with plus or minus two standard deviations
of the expected return.
Figure 2 shows the historical return DEMO for a diversified
portfolio. The portfolio is composed'of approximately 100 securities,
with each security having equal weight. The month-by-month returns
cover the DEMO from January 1945 to June 1970. Note that the distri-
bution is approximately symmetric, but not exactly. The arithmetic
average return for the 306-month period is 0.91%0 per month. The
standard deviation about this average is DEMO per month.
Figure 3 gives the same data for a single security, National
Department Stores. The arithmetic average return is 0.81% per month
over the 306-month period. The most interesting aspect, however, is
the standard DEMO of month-by-month returns -- 9.02% per month,
more than double that for the diversified portfolio. This result will be
discussed. further in the DEMO section.
Thus far our discussion of portfolio risk has been confined to a
single-period investment horizon such as the next year.. That is, the
portfolio is held unchanged and evaluated at the end of the year. DEMO
obvious question relates to the effect of holding the portfolio for several
periods, such as the next 20 years: will the 1-year risks DEMO to cancel
out over time? Given the random walk nature of DEMO prices, the
answer to this question is no. If the risk DEMO (standard deviation) is
maintained during each year, the portfolio risk DEMO longer horizons will
-11-
increase with the horizon length. The standard deviation of possible
terminal portfolio DEMO after N years is equal to ;N times the
standard deviation DEMO 1 year.
Thus, the investor cannot rely on the
"long run" to reduce his risk of loss.
A final remark before leaving portfolio risk measures.
We have
implicitly assumed that investors are risk averse, i.e., they seek to
minimize risk for a given level of return. This assumption appears to
be valid for most investors in most situations. The DEMO theory of
portfolio selection and capital asset pricing. is based on the belief that
investors on the average are risk averse.

3. DIVERSIFICATION
When the distribution of historical returns for the 100-stock
portfolio (Figure 2) is compared with the distribution for National Depart-
ment Stores (Figure 3), a curious relationship is discovered. While the
standard deviation of returns for the security is doublt that of the port-
folio, its average return is less. Is the market so imperfect that over
DEMO long period of time (25 years) it rewarded substantially higher risk with
lower average return?
No so. Much of the total risk (standard deviation of return) of
National Department Stores is diversifiable.
That is, when combined
with other securities, a portion of the variation of DEMO returns is smoothed
or cancelled by complementary variation in the other securities. Since
much of the total risk could be eliminated simply by holding DEMO stock in
a portfolio, there was no economic requirement for the DEMO earned to
be in line with the total risk. Instead, we DEMO expect realized returns
to be related to that portion of security risk which cannot be eliminated
by portfolio combination (more on risk-return relationships later).
The
same portfolio diversification effect accounts for the low standard deviation
DEMO return for the 100-stock portfolio. In fact, the portfolio standard
deviation DEMO less than that of the-typical security in the portfolio.
Much of
the total risk of the component securities has been eliminated by diversifi-
cation.
DEMO results from combining securities which have less
than perfect correlation (dependence) among their returns in order to
reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing portfolio DEMO In general, the
-13-
lower the correlation among security returns, the greater the impact of
diversification.
This is true regardless of how risky the securities of
the portfolio DEMO considered in isolation.
Ideally, if we could find sufficient securities with DEMO
returns, we could completely eliminate portfolio risk. However, this
situation is not typical of real securities markets in which securities'
returns are DEMO correlated to a considerable degree. Thus, while
portfolio risk can be DEMO reduced by diversification, it cannot be
entirely eliminated. This can be DEMO very clearly by measuring
the standard deviations of randomly selected portfolios containing various
numbers of securities.
In a study of the impact of portfolio DEMO on risk, Wagner
and Lau [24] divided a sample of 200 DEMO stocks into six subgroups
based on the Standard and Poors Stock Quality Ratings as of June 1960.
The highest quality ratings (A+) formed DEMO first group, the second highest
ratings (A) the next group, and so on. Randomly selected portfolios were
then formed from each of DEMO subgroups, containing from 1 to 20 securities.
The month-by-month portfolio returns DEMO the 10-year period through
May 1970 were then computed for each portfolio (portfolio composition
remaining unchanged). The exercise was repeated ten times to reduce
the dependence on single samples. The values for the ten trials DEMO
then averaged.
Table 1 shows the average return and standard deviation for port-
folios from the first subgroup (A+ quality stocks). The average return is
unrelated to the number of issues in the portfolio. On DEMO other hand, the
standard deviation of return declines as the number DEMO holdings increases.
On the average, approximately 40% of the single security DEMO is eliminated
-14-
by forming randomly selected portfolios of 20 stocks. However, it is
also evident that additional diversification yields rapidly diminishing
reduction in risk. The improvement DEMO slight when the number of
securities held is increased beyond, say, 10. Figure 4 shows the results
for all six quality groups. The DEMO shows the rapid decline in total
portfolio risk as the -portfolios are expanded from 1 to 10
stocks.
Returning to Table 1, we note from the second last column in the table
that the return on DEMO diversified portfolio "follows the market" very closely
The degree of association is measured by the correlation (R) of each
portfolio with an DEMO index of all NYSE stocks. The 20-security
portfolio has a correlation of 0.89 with the market (perfect positive
correlation results in a correlation of 1.0).
The implication is thithe risk
remaining in the 20-stock portfolio DEMO predominantly a reflection of
uncertainty about the performance of the stock market in general.
Figure 5 shows the results for the six quality groups. DEMO in
Figure 5 is given by the correlation coefficient squared, designated DEMO
(possible values range from 0 to 1.0).
The R-squared coefficient DEMO a useful interpretation. It measures
the proportion of variation in portfolio return which is attributable to
variation in market returns. The remaining variation is DEMO which is
unique to the portfolio and, as we saw in DEMO 4, can be eliminated by
proper diversification of the portfolio. Thus, R
measures the degree
of portfolio diversification. A poorly diversified portfolio will DEMO a small
R-squared (0.30 - 0.40).
A well diversified portfolio DEMO have a much
higher R squared (0.85 - 0.95). A DEMO diversified portfolio will have
-15-
an R-squared of 1.0; that is, all of the portfolio risk DEMO a reflection of
market risk. Figure 5 shows the rapid gain in diversification as the
portfolio is expanded from one security to two securities DEMO up to ten
securities.
Beyond ten securities the gains tend to be smaller. Note
that the highest quality A+ issues tend to be less DEMO at achieving
diversification for a given number of issues. Apparently the companies
which comprise this group are more homogeneous than the companies
grouped under DEMO other quality codes.
The results show that some risks can be eliminated via diversifi-
cation, others cannot. Thus we are led to the distinction between a port-
folio's unsystematic risk, which can be eliminated by diversification, and
its systematic risk which cannot. The situation is depicted in Figure 6.
The figure shows total portfolio risk declining with increasing numbers DEMO
holdings. The total risk of the portfolio is made up to two parts:
systematic or nondiversifiable risk and unsystematic risk. Unsystematic
risk is DEMO eliminated with increased numbers of holdings until
portfolio risk is entirely systematic, i.e., market related. The systematic
risk is due to the fact DEMO the return on nearly every security depends to
some degree on the overall performance of the stock market. Investors
are thus exposed to "market uncertainty" no matter how many stocks
they hold. Consequently, the return DEMO diversified portfolios is highly
correlated with the market.
-16-
4. THE RISK OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES
Let 's summarize the message of the previous section. Portfolio
risk can be divided into two parts: systematic and unsystematic risk.
Unsystematic risk can be eliminated by portfolio diversification,
DEMO risk cannot. When unsystematic risk has been completely
eliminated, portfolio return DEMO perfectly correlated with the market.
Portfolio risk is then merely a reflection of the uncertainty about the
performance of the market.
The systematic risk DEMO a portfolio is made up from the systematic
risks of its component securities. The systematic risk of an individual
security is that portion of DEMO total risk (standard deviation of return)
which cannot be eliminated DEMO placing it in a well-diversified portfolio.
We now need a way of quantifying the systematic risk of a security and
evaluating the systematic risk DEMO a portfolio from its component
securities.
The nature of security risk can be better understood by dividing
security return into two parts: one dependent (i.e., perfectly correlated),
and a second independent (i.e., uncorrelated) of market return.
The
first component of return is usually referred to as "systematic", the
second as "unsystematic" return. Thus,
Security Return
Systematic Return
-17-
+
Unsystematic Return
(4)
Since the systematic return is perfectly correlated with the
market return, it can be expressed as a factor, designated beta (JI),
times the market return, R m .
The "beta" factor is a "market sensi-
tivity index", indicating how sensitive the security return is to changes
in the market level. The unsystematic return, which is independent of
market returns, is usually represented by a factor epsilon (E)DEMO
Thus,
the return on a security, R, may be expressed as
R
=
ORm + E
(5)
For example, if DEMO security had a
factor of 2.0 (e.g., an airline
stock), then a 10% market return would generate a systematic return for
the DEMO of 20%. The security return for the period would be the 20%
plus the unsystematic component. The unsystematic return depends on
factors unique to DEMO company, such as labor difficulties, higher-than-
expected sales, etc.
The DEMO returns model given by Equation (5) is usually written
in a way such that the average value of the residual term,
E,DEMO
is zero.
This is accomplished by adding a factor, alpha (),
to the model to
represent the average value of the unsystematic DEMO over time. That
is,
R
=
a+
R m
+
(DEMO)
where the average E over time is equal to zero.
The model for security returns given by Equation (6) is usually
referred DEMO as the "market model". Graphically, the model can be
depicted as a line fitted to a plot of security returns against rates DEMO
-18-
return on the market index. This is shown in Figure 7 for DEMO hypothetical
security.
The beta factor can be thought of as the slope of the line. It gives
the expected increase in security return for DEMO 1% increase in market
return. In Figure 7, the security has DEMO beta of 1.0. Thus, a 10% market
return will result, on the average, in a 10% gain in security price. The
market weighted average beta for all stocks is 1.0 by definition.
The alpha factor DEMO represented by the intercept of the line on the
vertical security return axis. It is equal to the average value overtime
of the unsystematic DEMO on the stock. For most stocks, the alpha
factor tends to DEMO small and unstable.
Using the definition of security return given by the market model,
the specification of systematic and unsystematic risk is straightforward

Thus, the systematic risk of the portfolio is simply a weighted
average of DEMO systematic risk of the individual securities.
If the portfolio
is composed of an equal dollar investment in each stock (as was the case
for the 100-security portfolio of Figure 2), the
p is simply an DEMO
average of the component security betas.
The unsystematic risk of the portfolio is also a function of the
unsystematic security risks, but the form is more complete.
With
increasing diversification, this risk can be eliminated
With these results for portfolio risk, it is useful to return to
Figure 4. The figure shows the decline in portfolio risk with increasing
diversification DEMO each of the six quality groups. However, the portfolio
standard deviations DEMO each of the six groups are approaching different
limits.
We should expect these limits to differ because the average
risks ()
of the DEMO differ.
Table 2 shows a comparison of the standard deviations for the
20-stock portfolios with the predicted lower limits based on average
security systematic DEMO The lower limit is equal to the average beta

-20-
for the quality group (
times the standard deviation of the market
return (a m ) .
The standard deviations in all cases are close to the
predicted values. These results support the contention that portfolio
DEMO risk equals the average systematic risks of the component
securities.
Before moving on, let 's summarize the results of this section.
First, as seen from Figure 4, roughly 40 to 50%0 of total security risk
can be eliminated by diversification. Second, the remaining systematic
risk is equal to the security
times market risk. Thirdly, portfolio
systematic risk is a weighted average of security systematic risks.
The implications of these results are DEMO First, we would
expect realized rates of return over substantial periods DEMO time to be
related to the systematic as opposed to total risk of securities. Since
the unsystematic risk is relatively easily eliminated, we should not expect
the market to pay a "risk premium" for bearing DEMO
Second, since security systematic risk is equal to the security
beta DEMO
m (which is common to all securities), beta can be
DEMO as a relative risk measure. The
gives the systematic risk
of a security (or portfolio) relative to the risk of the market index.
DEMO is
more convenient to speak of systematic risk in terms of the beta factor,
rather than beta times am.

5. MEASUREMENT OF SECURITY
AND PORTFOLIO BETA VALUES
The basic data for DEMO betas are past rates of return earned
over a series of relatively short intervals -- usually days, weeks, or
months. For example, in Tables 3 and 4 we present calculations based
on month-by-month rates of DEMO for the periods January 1945 to
June 1970 (security betas) and January 1960 to December 1971 (mutual
fund betas). The returns are calculated in the manner described in
Section 1 (see Equation (1)).
It is customary to convert the observed rates of returns to
"risk premiums".
Risk premiums are obtained by subtracting the rates
of DEMO that could have been achieved by investing in short-maturity
risk-free assets, DEMO as treasury bills or prime commercial paper.
This removes a source of "noise" from the data. The noise stems from
the fact that DEMO returns may be higher in some years simply
because risk-free rates of interest are higher. Thus, an observed rate
of return of 8% might be regarded as satisfactory if it occurred in 1960,
but as DEMO relatively low rate of return when interest rates were at all-time
highes in 1969. Rates of return expressed as risk premiums will be
12/DEMO
denoted by small r 's.
Beta for a security is calculated DEMO fitting a straight line to the plot
of observed returns r versus observed returns on the market, denoted by
rm. The equation of the fitted line is

represents the stock's

term represents variation about the DEMO
resulting from the unsystematic component of return. We have put hats ()
over the C0, i and E terms to indicate that these are estimated values.
It is
important to remember that these estimated values DEMO differ substantially
from the true values because of statistical measurement difficulties.
However, the extent of possible error can be measured, and we can DEMO
a range within which the true value is almost certain to lie.

The estimated beta is 1.26 indicating above-average systematic
risk. The estimated alpha is -0. 05% per month, indicating that the non-
market-related component of return averaged -0. 60% per year over the
25-year DEMO The correlation coefficient is 0. 52; thus, 27% of the
variance of security returns resulted from market movements. The
remainder was due to DEMO unique to the company.
Our interpretation of the estimated alpha and beta values must
be conditioned by the degree of possible statistical measurement error.
DEMO measurement error is estimated by "standard error" coefficients
associated with alpha and beta.
For example, the standard error of beta is 0.12. Thus, the proba-
bility is about 66% that the true beta will lie between 1.26 + 0. 12, and
about 95% between 1.26 ± 0.24 (i.e., plus or minus two times the
standard error). Thus, we can say with high confidence that National

Department Stores has above-average systematic risk (the average
stock has beta = 1.0).
The standard error for alpha is 0.45, which is large compared
with the estimated value of -0. 05. Thus, we cannot conclude that the
true alpha is different from zero, since zero lies well within the range
of estimated alpha plus or minus one standard error (i.e., -0.05 + 0.45).
The process of line fitting used to estimate the coefficients is called
"Regression Analysis". Table 4 presents the same type of regression

results for a random collection of DEMO NYSE stocks.
The table contains the
following items. Column (1) gives the number of monthly observations,
columns (2) and (3) DEMO estimated alpha (a) and its standard error, columns
(4) DEMO (5) the estimated beta ()
and its standard error, DEMO (6) the
unsystematic risk (r (designated SE R in table), column (7) the R -squared
in percentage terms, columns (DEMO) and (9) the arithmetic average of monthly

and the standard deviation, column (10) the geometric
mean risk DEMO (g).
The results are ranked in terms of descending
values DEMO estimated beta. The table includes summary results for the NYSE
market index and the prime commercial paper "risk-free rate".
The
last two rows of the table give average values and standard deviations for
the sample. DEMO average beta, for example, is 1. 05, slightly higher than
DEMO average of all NYSE stocks. The average alpha is 0.13% per month,
indicating a slightly positive average unsystematic return.
The beta value for DEMO portfolio can be estimated in two ways.
One
method is to computer the beta of all portfolio holdings and weight the
results by portfolio DEMO
This method has the disadvantage of
requiring beta calculations for each individual portfolio asset. The second
-24-

method is to use the same computation procedures used for stocks, but
applied to the portfolio returns. In this way we can obtain estimates DEMO
portfolio betas without explicit consideration of the portfolio securities.
We have used this approach to compute portfolio and mutual fund beta
values.
Figure 9 DEMO the plot of the monthly returns on the 100-stock
portfolio against the NYSE index for the same 1945 - 1970 period. As in
the DEMO of National Department Stores, the best-fit line has been put
through DEMO points using regression analysis. The slope of the line (j)
DEMO equal to 1.10, with a standard error of 0. 03. Note DEMO substantial
reduction in the standard error term compared to the security examples.
The estimated alpha is 0.14, with a standard error of 0.10. Again, we
cannot conclude that the true alpha is different from zero. Note that the
points group much closer to the line than in the DEMO Department
Store plot. This results, of course, from the fact that much of the
unsystematic risk which causes the points to be scattered DEMO the
regression line in Figure 8 has been eliminated. The reduction is
evidenced by the R-squared measure of 0.87 (versus 0.27
for National
Department Stores). Thus, the market explains more than three times
as much of the return variation of the portfolio than for the stock.
Table DEMO gives regression results for a sample of 49 mutual funds.
The calculations are based on monthly returns for the period January 1960
to December DEMO
The market is represented by the Standard & Poor's
500 Stock Index. Average values and standard deviations for the 49 funds
in the DEMO are shown in the last two rows of the table. The average
beta value for the group is 0.92 indicating, on the average, DEMO funds were

less risky than the market index. Note the relatively low beta values DEMO
the balanced and bond funds, in particular, the keystone B1, DEMO, and
B4 bond funds.
This result is due to the low DEMO between bond
and stock returns.
Up to this point we have shown that it is a relatively easy matter
to estimate beta values for DEMO, portfolios, and mutual funds.
Now,
if the beta values are to be useful for investment decision making, they
must be predictable.
That is, beta values based on historical data
should provide considerable information about future beta values if past
measures are to be useful. The question DEMO be asked at three levels.
How predictable are the betas estimated for stocks, portfolios of stocks,
and mutual funds?
level.
Fortunately, DEMO have empirical evidence at each
Robert A. Levy [ 13] has conducted tests of the short-run predicta-
bility (also referred to as stationarity) DEMO beta coefficients for securities
and unmanaged portfolios of securities.
Levy's results are based on
weekly returns for 500 NYSE stocks for the period DEMO 30, 1960
through December 18, 1970 (520 weeks). Betas DEMO developed for each
security for ten non-overlapping 52-week periods. To measure stationarity,
Levy correlated the 500 security betas from each 52-week period (the historical
historical betas) with the 52-week betas in the following period (DEMO future
betas). Thus, nine correlation studies were performed for the DEMO
periods.
To compare the stationarity of security and portfolio betas, Levy

values for the same portfolios in the subsequent period.
The portfolios
were DEMO by ranking security betas in each period and partitioning
the list into portfolios containing 5, 10, 25, and 50 securities.
Each
portfolio contained an equal investment in each security.
The results of Levy s 52-week DEMO studies are presented
in Table 5.
The average values of the correlation coefficients from
the nine trials were 0.486, 0. 769, 0.853, 0.
939, and 0.
972 for port-
folios of 1, 5,
DEMO,
25,
and 50 stocks, respectively.
Correspondingly,
the average DEMO of the variation in future betas explained by
the historical betas are 23.6, 59. 1, 72.8, 88.2, and 94.5.
The results show DEMO beta coefficients to be very predictable
for large portfolios, and of DEMO declining predictability for
smaller portfolios and individual securities.
These conclusions are
not affected by changes in market performance.
Of the nine corre-
lation studies, five covered forecast periods during which the market
performance was the reverse DEMO the preceding period (61-62, 62-63,
65-66, 66-67, and 68-69).
Notably, the betas were approximately as
predictable over these five reversal periods as over the remaining
15/
four intervals.
The question of DEMO stability of mutual fund beta values is more
complicated.
Even if, DEMO seen above, the betas of large unmanaged port-
folios are very DEMO, there is no a priori need for mutual fund
betas to DEMO comparatively stable. Indeed, mutual fund portfolios are
managed, and as such, the betas may change substantially over time
by design.
For example, DEMO portfolio manager would tend to reduce the

risk exposure of his fund prior to an expected market decline and DEMO
it prior to an expected market upswing. However, the range of DEMO
values for beta will tend to be restricted, at least in DEMO longer run, by
the fund's investment objective. Thus, while we do not expect the same
standard of predictability as for large unmanaged DEMO, it is of
interest to examine the extent to which fund DEMO are predictable.
Pogue and Conway [
20] have conducted preliminary tests for a
sample of 90 mutual funds. The beta values for the period DEMO 1969
through May 1970 were correlated with values from the subsequent period
from June 1970 through October 1971. To test the sensitivity of the
DEMO to changes in the return measurement interval, the betas for each
DEMO were measured for daily, weekly, and monthly returns. The
betas were thus based on very different numbers of observations, namely
357, 74, and 17, respectively. The resulting correlation coefficients
were 0.915, 0.895, and 0.703 for daily, weekly, and monthly betas,
respectively.
Correspondingly, the average percentages of variation in
second-period betas explained by first-period values are DEMO, 81, and 49,
respectively.
The results support the contention that historical betas
contain useful information about future values. However, the degree of
predictability depends on the extent to which measurement errors have
been eliminated DEMO beta estimates. In the Pogue-Conway study, the
shift from monthly to DEMO returns reduced the average standard error
of the estimated beta values from 0. 11 to 0. 03, a 75% reduction.
The
more accurate daily estimates resulted in a much higher degree of beta
predictability, the correlation between sub-period betas increasing from
0.703 to 0.915. 0.703 to 0.915.6

Figure 10 shows a plot of the Pogue-Conway first-period versus
second-period betas DEMO on daily returns. The figure illustrates the
high degree of correlation between first- and second-period betas.
In summary, we can conclude that estimated security betas are
not highly predictable.
Levy's tests indicated that an average DEMO 24% of
the variation in second-period betas is explained by historical values.
The betas of his portfolios, however, were much more predictable, the
degree of predictability increasing with portfolio diversification.
The
results of the Pogue DEMO Conway study (among others, see footnote 16)
show that fund betas are not as stable as those for unmanaged portfolios.
On the DEMO, two-thirds to three-quarters of the variation in fund
betas can be DEMO by historical values.
Further, it should be remembered that a significant DEMO of
the measured changes in estimated beta values may not be due to changes
in the true values, but rather the result of measurement errors. This
observation is particularly applicable to individual security betas where
the DEMO errors tend to be large.

6. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
EXPECTED RETURN AND RISK
We have now developed DEMO measures of risk and described how
they can be measured from historical data. One is a measure of total
risk (standard deviation), the other a relative index of systematic or
nondiversifiable risk (beta). We have stated our belief that the beta
measure is more relevant for DEMO pricing of securities. Returns
expected by investors should logically be related to systematic as
opposed to total risk. Securities with higher systematic risk should DEMO
higher expected returns.
The question of interest now is the form of the relationship
between risk and return.
In this section we describe a DEMO
called the "Capital Asset Pricing Model" (CAPM), which is DEMO on
elementary logic and simple economic principles. The basic postulate
underlying the model is that assets with the same risk should have the
same DEMO rate of return. That is, the prices of assets in the
DEMO markets should adjust until equivalent risk assets have identical
expected returns. At this point, we say that the market is in an
"equilibrium" condition.
To see the implications of this postulate, consider an investor
18/
who holds a portfolio with the same risk as the market DEMO (beta
equal to 1.0). What return should he expect? Logically, he should
expect the same return as that of the market portfolio.
-30-
____^
Consider another investor who holds a riskless portfolio (beta
equal to zero). The investor in this case should expect to earn the rate
DEMO return on riskless assets such as treasury bills. By taking no risk,
he earns the riskless rate of return.
Now consider the case DEMO an investor who holds a mixture of these
two portfolios. Assume he invests a proportion X of his money in the
risky portfolio and (1 - X) in the riskless portfolio.
What risk does he
bear and what return should he expect? The risk of the composite port-
folio is easily computed.
Recall that the beta of a portfolio is DEMO a
weighted average of the component security betas, where the weights DEMO
the portfolio proportions. Thus, the portfolio beta, Bp, is a DEMO
average of the market and risk-free rate betas, that is, an average of
zero and one.
Thus
p
=
(1 - X)
= x
0 +
X
1
(12)
Thus,
p is equal to the fraction of his money invested in the risky
portfolio. DEMO 100% or less of the investor 's funds are invested in DEMO
risky portfolio, his portfolio beta will be between zero and 1. DEMO
If he
borrows at the risk-free rate and invests the proceeds in the risky port-
folio, his portfolio beta will be greater than 1.0.
The expected return of the composite portfolio is also a weighted
average DEMO the expected returns on the two-component portfolios; that is,
E(DEMO)
=
(1 - X)
RF + X'
E(DEMO
)

where E(Rp),

are the expected returns on the portfolio,

Equation (14) is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
DEMO is
an extremely important theoretical result. It says that the expected return
on a portfolio should exceed the riskless rate of return by an DEMO which
is proportional to the portfolio beta. That is, the relationship DEMO
return and risk should be linear.
The model is often stated in risk-premium form,
E(rp)
=
p
E(r m )
(15)
where E(rp) and E(rm) are the expected portfolio and market risk
premiums, formed by subtracting the risk-free rate from the rates of
return. In this form the model states that the DEMO risk premium for
the investor I's portfolio is equal to its beta value times the expected
market risk premium.
We can illustrate the DEMO by assuming that the short-term (risk-
free) interest rate is 6% and the expected return on the market with a
relative risk (beta) of 1.0 is 10%. The expected risk premium for holding
the market portfolio is just the difference between the 10% and the short-
term DEMO rate of 6%,
or 4%.
Investors who hold the market portfolio
expect to earn 10%, which is 4% greater than they could earn on a

securities with different DEMO of risk should be as follows.

6%
0.5
8%
1.0

The predictions of the model are inherently sensible. For safe
investments (f = 0), the model predicts that investors would expect to
earn the risk-free rate of interest. For a risky investment (
> 0)
investors would expect a rate of return proportional DEMO the market sensi-
tivity ()
of the stock. Thus, stocks DEMO lower-than-average market
sensitivities (such as most utilities) would offer expected returns less
than the expected market return. Stocks with above-average values of
beta (such as most airline securities) would offer expected returns in
excess of the market.
In our development of the CAPM we have implicitly made DEMO number
of assumptions which are required if the model is to be established on a
rigorous basis. These assumptions involve investor behavior and condi-
DEMO in the capital markets. The following is a set of assumptions
which are sufficient to allow a simple derivation of the model.
(a)
The market is composed of risk-averse investors who
measure risk in terms DEMO standard deviation of portfolio
-33-
return. This assumption provides a basis for the use of
beta-type risk DEMO
(b)
All investors have a common ti e horizon for DEMO
decision making (e.g., 1 month, 1 year, etc.). This
assumption allows us to measure investor expectations
over some common interval, thus making comparisons
meaningful.
(c)
All investors are assumed to have the same expectations
about future security returns and risks. Without this
assumption, investors would disagree on expected return
and risks, resulting in a more complex situation.
(d)
Capital markets are perfect in the sense that all assets are
completely divisible, there are no transactions costs or
differential taxes, and borrowing and lending rates are
equal to each other and the same for all investors. Without
these conditions, frictional barriers would exist to the
equilibrium conditions on which the model is based.
While these assumptions DEMO sufficient to derive the model, it is not
clear that all DEMO necessary in their current form. It may well be that
several of the assumptions can be substantially relaxed without major change
in the form DEMO the model. A good deal of research is currently being
conducted toward this end.
While the CAPM is indeed simple and elegant, these qualities do not
in themselves make it useful in explaining observed risk-return patterns.
DEMO now proceed to the empirical literature on attempts to verify the model.

7. TESTS OF THE CAPITAL ASSET
PRICING MODEL121
The major difficulty in DEMO is that the Capital Asset Pricing
Model is stated in terms of investors ' expectations, not in terms of
realized returns. Obviously, expectations DEMO not always realized after
the fact. From a statistical point of view, this introduces an error term
which should be zero on the average, but not necessarily zero for any
single stock of single period of time. After the fact, we would expect to
observe
Rj
=
Rf +
j(R
-Rf)
+
Ej
(16)
where Rj, DEMO, and Rf are the realized returns on stock j, the market
index,and the riskless asset; and
j is the residual term.
The term Ej reflects the firm's unsystematic risk -- the risk due
DEMO factors unique to the company.
Unsystematic risk is eliminated when
the stock is included in a well-diversified portfolio.
Thus, if the hypothesis is correct, and we observe returns for
many stocks and many periods of time, then Ej ought to be zero on the
average, and the DEMO risk premiums on various stocks ought to be
proportional to the stocks' betas.
This hypothesis is illustrated by Figure 11.
Each plotted point
represents one stock's realized return versus the stock's beta.
According to DEMO capital asset pricing model, the line fitted to these
points should DEMO (1) linear and (2) upward sloping. Also, (3) DEMO should
pass through the vertical axis at the risk-free rate.

The equation of this fitted line is

Pi
(17 a)
where Rj is the average return DEMO on stock j,
j is its estimated
beta, and
j DEMO a residual term. The capital asset pricing model predicts
that
o,
the intercept of the fitted line on the return axis, should have the
value Rf, and that the slope,
y 1,
should have a value equal to RM - Rf*
where RM and Rf DEMO the averages of the market returns and risk-free
rates of interest during the period studied.
Expressed in risk premium form, the equation of the fitted line is
=
70 +
-1
j +
pj
(17b)
where rj is the average realized risk premium stock j, that is, Rj - Rf.
The only difference is that the predicted value of 70 under the capital
asset pricing model hypothesis is zero.
Other Measures DEMO Risk
The hypothesis just described is only true if beta is a complete
measure of a stock's risk. Various alternative risk measures have DEMO
proposed. The most common alternative hypothesis is that expected
return is related to the standard deviation of return -- that is, to a stock's
total risk, which includes both systematic and unsystematic components.
What is more important in explaining average observed returns on
securities, systematic or unsystematic risk? The way to find out is to
fit an expanded equation to the data:

Of course, if the capital asset pricing model is exactly true,
then 2 will be zero -- that is, SEj will contribute nothing to the explana-
tion of observed security returns.
Empirical Tests of DEMO Capital Asset Pricing Model
If the capital asset pricing model is right, the empirical tests
whould show the following:
1.
On the average, and over long periods of time, the
securities with high systematic DEMO should have high
rates of return.
2.
On the average, there DEMO be a linear relationship
between systematic risk and return.
3.
Unsystematic risk, as measured by SEj, should play
no significant role in explaining DEMO in
security returns.
These predictions have been tested in several recent statistical studies.
We will review some of the more important of these. Readers DEMO
to skip the details may proceed to the summary at the end of this section.
We will begin by summarizing results from studies based DEMO
individual securities.
Then we will turn to portfolio results.

Results for Tests Based on Securities
We will review two studies, one by Professor N. L. Jacob [9],
and a second by Professor DEMO H. Miller and M. S. Scholes [19].
The Jacob Study
This study deals with the 593 New York Stock Exchange stocks for
which there DEMO complete data from 1946 to 1965. Regression analyses were
performed for the 1946-55 and 1956-65 periods, using both monthly and
annual security returns. The relationship of mean security returns and
beta values is shown in Table DEMO The last two columns of the table give
the theoretical values for the coefficients, as predicted by the capital
asset pricing model.
The results sow a significant positive relationship between
realized return and risk during each DEMO the 10-year periods. For example,
in 1956-65 there was a 6.7 percent per year increase in average return
for a one-unit increase in DEMO Although the relationships shown in Table 6
are all positive, they DEMO weaker than predicted by the capital asset pricing
model. In each period
1
is less than the theoretical value.
The Miller-Scholes Study
The Miller-Scholes DEMO deals with annual returns for 631 stocks
during the 1954-63 period. The results of three of their tests are reported
in Table 7.
The DEMO are (1) mean return versus beta, (2) mean return
DEMO
versus unsystematic risk, (SEj) , and (3) mean return DEMO both beta
and unsystematic risk.
..
.. . .
_
_.
-38-
The results for the first test show a significant positive relationship
between DEMO return and beta. A one-unit increase in beta is associated
with a 7.1 percent increase in mean return.
The results for the second test DEMO not agree with the capital asset
pricing model' s predictions. That DEMO, high unsystematic risk is apparently
associated with higher realized returns. However, Miller and Scholes
show that this correlation may be largely spurious (i.e., it may be due to
statistical sampling problems).
For example, DEMO substantial positive corre-
lation exists between beta and (SEj). Thus, even though unsystematic risk
may be unimportant to the pricing of securities, it will appear to be
significant in tests from which beta has DEMO omitted. This sort of
statistical correlation need not imply a causal link between the variables.
Test number (3) includes both beta and
2
(SEj)
in the regression
equation. Both are found to be significantly DEMO related to mean
return. The inclusion of (Sj)
has somewhat DEMO the relationship
of return and beta, however. A one-unit increase in DEMO is now associated
with only a 4.2 percent increase in mean return.
The interpretation of these results is again complicated by the strong
A2
DEMO correlation between beta and (SE.) , and by other sampling
problems.
A significant portion of the correlation between mean return
and (SEj)
may well be a spurious result. In any case, the results do show
that stocks with high systematic risk tend to have higher rates DEMO return.
Results for Tests Based on Portfolio Returns
The security tests clearly show the significant positive correlation
between return and systematic risk. Tests based DEMO on securities,
-39-
'-------"^----"I----II-----
however, are not the most efficient method of obtaining estimates of the
magnitude of the risk-return tradeoff. Tests based on securities are
inefficient for DEMO reasons.
The first problem is well known to economists.
It is called
"errors in variables bias" and results from the fact that beta, the
independent variable in the test, is typically measured with some error.
These errors are random in their effect -- that is, some stocks' betas
are overestimated and some are underestimated.
Nevertheless, when
these estimated DEMO values are used in the test, the measurement errors
tend to DEMO the relationship between mean return and risk.
By carefully grouping the securities into portfolios, much of this
measurement error problem can be eliminated.
The errors in individual
stocks ' betas cancel out so that the portfolio DEMO can be measured with
much greater precision. This in turn means that tests based on portfolio
returns will be more efficient than tests based DEMO security returns.
The second problem relates to the obscuring effect of residual
variation. Realized security returns have a large random component,
which typically DEMO for about 70 percent of the variation of return.
(This is DEMO diversifiable or unsystematic risk of the stock.) By grouping
securities into DEMO, we can eliminate much of this "noise", and
thereby get a much clearer view of the relationship between return and
systematic risk.
DEMO should be noted that grouping does not distort the underlying
risk-return relationship. The relationship that exists for individual
securities is exactly the same for DEMO of securities.

We will review the results from four studies based on portfolios --
DEMO by Professors M. Blume and I. Friend [3] [8], a third DEMO Professors
F. Black, M. Jensen, and M. Scholes [ 1], DEMO a fourth by E. Fama and
J. MacBeth [6].
Blume and Friend's Study
Professors Blume and Friend have conducted two inter-related
risk-return studies. DEMO first examines the relationship between long-run
rates of return and various risk measures. The second is a direct test of
the capital asset pricing DEMO
In the first study [8], the authors constructed portfolios of NYSE
DEMO stocks at the beginning of three different holding periods.
The
periods began at the ends of 1929, 1948, and 1956.
All stocks for DEMO
monthly rate-of-return data could be obtained for at least 4 years
preceding the test period were divided into 10 equal portfolios.
The
securities were DEMO on the basis of their betas during the preceding
4 years -- the 10 percent of securities with the lowest betas to the first
DEMO, the group with the next lowest betas to the second portfolio,DEMO
and so on.
After the start of the test periods, the DEMO were reassigned
annually. That is, each stock's estimated beta was DEMO at the end
of each successive year, the stocks were ranked DEMO on the basis of
their betas, and new portfolios were formed. DEMO procedure kept the
portfolio betas reasonably stable over time.
The performance of these portfolios is summarized in Table 8.
The table gives the arithmetic DEMO monthly returns and average beta
values for each of the 10 portfolios and for each test period.
___
iCIII_-_-
For the 1929-69 period, the results indicate a strong positive
association between return and beta. For the 1948-69 period, while
higher beta portfolios had higher returns than portfolios with lower betas,
there was little difference DEMO return among portfolios with betas greater
than 1.0. The 1956-69 period results do not show a clear relationship
between beta and return.
On the DEMO of these and other tests, the authors conclude that
NYSE stocks DEMO above-average risk have higher returns than those with
below-average risk, but DEMO there is little payoff for assuming additional
risk within the group of stocks with above-average betas.
In their second study [3], Blume and Friend used monthly portfolio
returns during the 1955-68 period to test the capital DEMO pricing model.
Their tests involved fitting the coefficients of Equation (17a) for three
sequential periods: 1955-59, 1960-64, and 1965-68. The authors also
added a factor to the regression equation to test for the linearity DEMO the
22/

Blume and Friend conclude that "DEMO comparisons as a whole
suggest that a linear model is a tenable approximation of the empirical
relationship between return and risk for NYSE stocks DEMO the three

DEMO are not in line with the capital
asset pricing models predictions, DEMO In the first two periods,

reverse situation exists, with DEMO substantially less than predicted.
These
results imply that yl, the slope DEMO the fitted line, is less than predicted
in the first two DEMO and greater in the third.

Black, Jensen, and Scholes
This study [1] is a careful attempt DEMO reduce measurement errors
that would bias the regression results. For each year from 1931 to 1965,
the authors grouped all NYSE stocks into DEMO portfolios. The number of
securities in each portfolio increased over the 35-year period from a low
of 58 securities per portfolio in 1931 to DEMO high of 110 in 1965.
Month-by-month returns for the portfolios were computed from
January 1931 to December 1965. Average portfolio returns and portfolio
betas DEMO computed for the 35-year period and for a variety of sub-
periods.
The results for the complete period are shown in Table 9. The
DEMO monthly portfolio returns and beta values for the 10 portfolios
are plotted in Figure 12.
The results indicate that over the complete 35-year period,DEMO
average return increased by approximately 1.08 percent per month (13
percent DEMO year) for a one-unit increase in beta. This is about three-
DEMO of the amount predicted by the capital asset pricing model.
Figure 12 shows, there appears to be little reason to question the
linearity of the relationship over the 35-year period.
As
Black, Jensen, and Scholes DEMO estimated the risk-return tradeoff
2 5j
for a number of subperiods. The slopes of the regression lines tend in
most periods to understate the DEMO values, but are generally of the
correct sign. Also, the subperiod relationships appear to be linear.
This paper provides substantial support for the DEMO that
realized returns are a linear function of systematic risk values. Also, it
shows that the relationship is significantly positive over long periods of
time.

The evidence shows a significant positive relstionship
between realized DEMO and systematic risk. However,
the relationship is not always as strong as predicted by
the capital asset pricing model.
The relationship between risk DEMO return appears to be
linear. The studies give no evidence of significant
curvature in the risk-return relationship.
Tests which attempt to discriminate between the DEMO
of systematic and unsystematic risk do not yield
definitive results. Both kinds of risk appear to be
positively related to security returns.
However, we
believe that the relationship between return and unsystematic
risk is at least DEMO spurious -- that is, partly reflecting
statistical problems rather than the DEMO nature of capital
markets.
Obviously, we cannot claim that the capital DEMO pricing model is
absolutely right. On the other hand, the empirical DEMO do support the
view that beta is a useful risk measure and that investors in high beta
stocks expect correspondingly high rates of return.

MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
The basic concept underlying investment performance measure-
DEMO follows directly from the risk-return theory. The return on managed
portfolios, DEMO as mutual funds, can be judged relative to the returns on
DEMO portfolios at the same degree of investment risk. If the
return exceeds the standard, the portfolio manager has performed in a
superior way, DEMO vice versa.
Given this, it remains to selectaa set of "benchmark" portfolios
against which managed portfolio performance can be evaluated.
The
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a convenient and familiar
set of portfolios; however, as discussed below, these are not the only
portfolios which DEMO be used.
The CAPM benchmark portfolios are
simply combinations of the riskless rate and market index. The return
standard for a managed portfolio with DEMO beta equal to Up is equal
to the risk-free rate plus 3p times the average realized risk premium
on the market.
The performance measure, ap,
is equal to the difference
in the average returns between DEMO portfolio and the standard; that is,
p
p
RF
+
DEMO(RM - RF)
(20)
where Rp, RM, and DEMO are the average returns for the portfolio,
market index, and DEMO bond during the test period.
Estimated values of alphs () P DEMO beta ( AP ) are determined
as discussed in Section 5 by regressing the portfolio risk premiums on
the market risk premiums. Positive values DEMO ap are indications of
superior performance, negative values of inferior performance.

into consideration possible statistical measurement errors. As discussed
in Section 5, the standard error of alpha (SELL) is a measure of the extent
of DEMO possible measurement error. The larger the standard error, the
less certain DEMO can be that the measured alpha is a close approximation
26/
to the true value.
A measure of the degree of statistical significance DEMO the estimated
alpha value is given by the ratio of the estimated alpha to its standard
error. The ratio, designated as t , is given by
tc
=
oap
p
(21)
The t
gives a measure of the extent to which the true value of alphs can
DEMO considered to be different from zero. It measures the number of
multiples of standard error that Op is away from zero. If the absolute
DEMO of t
is large, then we have more confidence that the DEMO value
of alpha is different from zero. Absolute values of t
in excess of 2. 0
indicate a probability of less than about 2. DEMO that the true value of alpha
could equal zero.
These methods of performance measurement were originally
devised by Michael Jensen [ 10] [11] and DEMO been widely used in many
studies of investment performance, including that DEMO the recent SEC
Institutional Investor Study [ 20].
However, the tests DEMO the capital asset pricing model summarized
in Section 7 indicate that the average returns over time on securities and
portfolios deviate systematically from the DEMO of the rno
del
Though the observed average risk-return relationships seem to be linear,
the tradeoff of risk for return is, in general, less than would be predicted

from the CAPM.
In short, the evidence suggests that the CAPM does not
provide the best benchmarks for the average return-risk tradeoffs
available in DEMO market from naively selected portfolios.
These results do not prohibit our attempts to measure performance.
They indicate that benchmark portfolios other than those prescribed DEMO
the CAPM would be more appropriate;
but given such alternative naively
selected portfolios, the analysis could proceed in exactly the same manner
as described above. The work of Black, Jensen, and Scholes [ I DEMO shows
the average return from naively selected portfolios, when plotted against
DEMO, tends to lie along a straight line with slope somewhat less DEMO
implied by the CAPM. These "empirical risk return" lines would seem to
be a natural alternative to the market line implied by the DEMO asset
pricing model. Performance would then be measured relative to the
empirical line, as opposed to the market line. A comparison of those two
standards is illustrated in Figure 13. The market line performance
measure (designated as a
in Figure 13) is equal to the vertical distance
from the portfolio to the market line. The empirical line measure
(designated a 2 ) is the vertical distance from the portfolio to the empirical
DEMO
Since the market index ideally is composed of all assets, both
DEMO empirical and market lines would be expected to pass through the
market index coordinates (point O in Figure 13).
The intercepts on the
return axis, however, are different. The market line intercept, by
definition, is equal to the risk-free rate. The empirical line intercept
equals the average return on a portfolio with "zero beta", designated R Z .
-48-
;,,,II-'^-------------·------------
The existence of long-run rates of return on the
cT(Io l(DEMO:i portfolih
different from the riskless rate is a clear violation of the predictions of
the CAPM. As of this time, there is no clear theoretical understanding
as to the nature of this difference.
To summarize, empirically based performance standards would
seem to be the natural alternative to DEMO of the capital asset pricing
model. This follows mainly because the empirical standards reflect the
actual performance of naively selected portfolios.
However, the design
of appropriate empirical standards requires further research.
In the
interim, the familiar market line benchmarks can provide useful informa-
tion regarding relative performance, but care must be exercised to avoid
drawing fine distinctions among portfolio results.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our task is finally completed. We have presented a DEMO but
hopefully comprehensive introduction to the foundations and tests of
modern portfolio theory. Our aim was to provide the reader with a first
view DEMO the subject in hopes that his interest will be whetted for further
27
study.
The major topics dealt with were the specification and measure-
DEMO of security and portfolio risk, the development of a hypothesis for
DEMO relationship between expected return and risk, and the use of the
DEMO model to measure the performance of institutional investors.
We have not provided a set of final answers to questions in these areas
because none DEMO exist. The theory and empirical evidence are in
a state of rapid evolution, and our knowledge has increased markedly in
the recent past and will surely continue to do so in the future.

FOOTNOTES
Respectively Professor and Associate Professor of Finance,DEMO
Sloan School of Management, MIT. This paper was originally
prepared by DEMO as Part I of "A Study of Investment Company
Incentive Fee DEMO". The research was supported by
a grant from the Investment Company Institute, Washington, D.C.
The general expression for the arithmetic mean return DEMO a series
of N periods is given by
-
R
_1
N
2
t=1
R R t
where Rt is the investment return during DEMO t, as measured
by Equation (1).
The general expression for the geometric or compounded rate of
return over a series of N DEMO is given by
=
=
[(1 + R 1 ) (DEMO + R 2 ) ...
(1 + RN)]
N
[ DEMO
t=1
1IN
(1 +Rt)]
-

-
1
1/N
DEMO total return for the period is given by (1 +
)N - 1.
The relationship between the geometric and arithmetic mean
returns is DEMO that the arithmetic mean is always equal to or
greater than the geometric average. The difference increases
as the dispersion of the returns increases. DEMO following
equation developed by Young and Trent [25] shows the nature
of the difference.
R=
[G +
a 2 (R)]1/2

This relationship shows that R and G are equal only for an
DEMO with constant returns. For given R, as
the difference between the DEMO will increase.
(R) increases,
Thus,
R
is a good approximation for G only when the variance of the R t
returns DEMO small.
The transformation changes nothing of substance, since
M

M

where
MT
=
terminal portfolio value
Rp

Since MT
=
portfolio return
is a linear function of Rp, any risk measures
developed for the portfolio return will apply equally to the
DEMO market value.
Risk measures based on below-average-value variation are
analytically difficult to deal with.
H. Markowitz, in Chapter
of [ 18], develops a DEMO statistic which measures
=
(1 + Rp) M0

variability below the mean and compares it with the more
commonly used DEMO calculation.
7.
8.
See for example M. E. Blume [2].
This result follows easily for continuously compounded rates of
return. The return for N DEMO, Rp, is simply the sum of the
N one-period returns; DEMO is,
Rp
R 1
+
R 2
+
..
+
R N
Now, if the one-period returns are independently and identically
distributed with variance
2 , then the variance of Rp will equal
No , DEMO standard deviation fNa.
The key assumption of
independence of portfolio returns over time is realistic, since
security returns appear to follow a random walk through time.
9.
Two securities with perfectly correlated return patterns will
have DEMO correlation coefficient of 1.0. Conversely, if the return
patterns are perfectly DEMO correlated, the correlation
coefficient will equal -1.
Two securities with uncorrelated
(i.e., statistically unrelated) returns will have a correlation
coefficient of zero. DEMO average correlation coefficient
between securities on the NYSE is approximately 0.7.
10.
The reader may wish to verify that total risk (as measured by
variance) really does equal the sum of systematic and unsystematic
i-4 -
risks (also measured by variance).
The relationship between the
risk components is given by

This follows directly from Equation (5) and the assumption of
DEMO of Rm and E.
The R-squared term previously discussed is the ratio of systematic
to total risk (both measured in terms of variance).
R-squared
=
,2 a2

Note also that the R-squared is the square of the correlation
coefficient between security and market returns. Thus, the
correlation coefficient is equal to the ratio of 3 am to a.

The conversion to risk premiums results in no substantive change
but is consistent with theoretical developments discussed in
Section 6.
The sample DEMO picked to give the broadest possible range of
security beta values. This was accomplished by ranking al NYSE
securities with complete data from 1945-70 DEMO their estimated
beta values during this period. We then selected every twenty-
fivth stock from the ordered list. The data was obtained from the
DEMO of Chicago CRSP (Center for Research in Security
Prices) tape.
The commercial paper results in Table 3 are rates of return,
not DEMO premiums. The risk premiums would equal zero by
definition.
Correlation studies of this type tend to produce a conservative
picture of the degree of DEMO coefficient stationarity. This results
-79-

from the fact that it is not possible DEMO correlate the true beta values
but only estimates which contain varying degrees of measurement
error. Measurement error would reduce the correlation
coefficient even though DEMO underlying beta values were unchanged
from period to period.
These results are consistent with those found by N. Mains in a
later and more DEMO study [ 16].
Mains correlated adjacent
calendar year betas for a sample of 99 funds for the period 1960
through 1971. The betas were DEMO on weekly returns. The
average correlation coefficient for the 11 tests was 0. 788, with
individual values ranging from a low of 0. 614 to a high of 0. 871.
From this point on, "systematic DEMO" will be referred to simply
as risk. "Total risk" will DEMO referred to as total risk.
We use the term portfolio in a general sense, including the case
where the investor holds only one security. Since portfolio return
and (systematic) risk are simply weighted averages of DEMO
values, risk-return relationships which hold for securities must
also be true DEMO portfolios, and vice versa.
The material in Section 7 was also DEMO as an appendix to
testimony to be delivered before the Federal Communications
Commission by S. C. Myers and G. A. Pogue.
