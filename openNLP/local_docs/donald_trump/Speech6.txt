Donald J. Trump Republican Nomination Acceptance Speech
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept
your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th
of last year we – and I say “we” because we are a team – would have
received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican
Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than
it received four years ago. The Democrats, on the other hand, received
almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got eight years ago. 1
Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead
our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. 2 3 4
We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a
country of law and order.
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on
our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any
politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. 5 6 7

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of
violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. 10 11

Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its
victims. 12
I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts
our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017,
safety will be restored. 13 14
The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. 15
It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. 16 17 18
So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the
media myths—the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the
American people with the truth, and nothing else.
These are the facts:
Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She
was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with
a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time,
and he is now a fugitive from the law. 42 43 44 45
I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing
daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One
more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. 46 47 48
What about our economy?
Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly
news and your morning newspaper:

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived
through one international humiliation after another.
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by
their Iranian captors at gunpoint. 67
This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran
150 billion dollars and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of
the worst deals ever negotiated. 68 69 70 71 72
Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria –
and the whole world knew it meant nothing. 73 74 75
In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe
– was brought down in flames. 76 77

America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when
Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s
foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. 78 79
Her bad instincts and her bad judgement – something pointed out by
Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding
today. 80 81
Let’s review the record.
In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt
was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being
choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.
After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?
ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. 82 83 84
Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die
at the hands of savage killers. 85 86 87 88
Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the
military to retake control. 89 90

Iraq is in chaos. 91

Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the
West. 94 95 96
After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent
and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been
before. 97 98 99 100

weakness. 101 102 103
But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.

destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the
same politicians who created them. 104 105 106 107

Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.
The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents,
is that our plan will put America First.
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we
can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
This will all change when I take office.
The American People will come first once again.
My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods,
secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity
without law and order.
On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and
trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by
some of our nation’s most powerful special interests.
That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic
system for their exclusive benefit. 108 109 110
Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the
campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged
system in place. 111 112 113

They are throwing money at her because they have total control over
everything she does.
She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change.
My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right
now.
Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all
across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.
I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by
our horrible and unfair trade deals. 114 115 116
These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work
hard but no longer have a voice. 117 118
I AM YOUR VOICE.
I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our
politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence,
no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. 119 120
When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or
the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has
sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the

other way.
And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private
server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts
our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no
consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never
before. 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132
When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely
careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know
that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were
just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes. 133
In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an
egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others, who
have done far less, have paid so dearly. 134 135
When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading
access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time

for action has come. 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up
on people who cannot defend themselves.
Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I
have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like
it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. But his
supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue:
trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth. 145 146 147
Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix
the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American.
In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the
United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to
Indiana. 148 149
He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the
job.

the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.
America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so
brutally executed. 150 151 152
Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence
against our law enforcement officials. 153 154
Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. 155 156 157 158 159 160
On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Three were killed, and three were badly injured. 161

restore law and order to our country.
165 166
I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law
enforcement officials to get the job done.
In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the
presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more
dangerous environment for everyone.
This Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on
education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them
in every way and on every level. 167 168
When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated
equally, and protected equally.
Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young
Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have the same
right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?
To make life safe for all our citizens, we must also address the growing
threats we face from outside the country: we are going to defeat the
barbarians of ISIS. 169

and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A

been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party
in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in
Chattanooga, and many more. 174 175 176 177

our LGBTQ community. 178 179
As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ
citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.
We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world.
We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change
that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must
work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and
stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in
the region, the State of Israel. 180 181 182 183

Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly
cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying
their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost.
184
Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new
program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction. 185
Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has
been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting
mechanisms have been put in place. 186 187 188
My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on
top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under
President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way
to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they
come from. 189 190 191 192

is not welcome in our country and never will be.

Where was the Sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so
brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?
These wounded American families have been alone.
But they are alone no longer.

them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save
countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.

the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our
communities.

finally receive the respect they deserve. 211 212
Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security
have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen
very closely to the words am about to say.
On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will
finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are
enforced.
We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my
greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration
policy of Hillary Clinton. 213
Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want
relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration,
and mass lawlessness. 214 215 216
Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your
jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from
poverty and join the middle class.
I have a different vision for our workers.
It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to
countries that cheat.
It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be
a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of
office. 217

Hillary Clinton. 219 220

renegotiated.
That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America –
and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want. 250
Our country is going to start building and making things again.
Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.

largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year –
Democrat or Republican. 251 252 253

and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.

will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our

And we will fix TSA at the airports!
We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to
take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.
We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we
are protecting, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken
care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous
veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be
able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice. My opponent dismissed
the VA scandal – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. 270 271

We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list
of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it.

We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court
who will uphold our laws and our Constitution. 275
The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a personof similar
views, principles, and judicial philosophy. This will be one of the most
important issues decided by this election.
My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2
nd amendment. I, on the
other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle
Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families
safe. 276 277 278
At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious
community in general who have been so good to me and so supportive.
You have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from
speaking your minds from your own pulpits. 279
An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens
religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly
advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that
language and protect free speech for all Americans. 280
We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to
do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. 281
It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better
and stronger than ever before.
In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my
wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always
be my greatest source of pride and joy.

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever
knew.
I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.
It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the
dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most
comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and
I have a lot of that in me also.
Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fairminded.
She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most
honest and charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of
character.
To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late
brother Fred, I will always give you my love—you are most special to me.
I have had a truly great life in business.
But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to
go to work for you.
It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people.
But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.
America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by
a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country
you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here
tonight.
No longer can we rely on those same people in the media, and politics,
who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.
Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.
History is watching us now. It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the
occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and
independent and strong.
I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the
White House.
My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It
reads: “I’m With Her”. 282
I choose to recite a different pledge.
My pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”
I am your voice.
So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams
for their future, I say these words to you tonight:
I’m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make
this promise:
We Will Make America Strong Again.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again.
And We Will Make America Great Again.
God bless You And Good Night.
