Abstract
This paper offers a theoretical and an experimental analysis of decision making in an
entrepreneurial context. We investigate how DEMO distribute their time between leisure and
working activities, and how they DEMO their working time between their newly formed venture and a
wage job. Two questionnaire experiments with business and economics students are utilized to test
DEMO predictions from an economic model, which we complement with predictions based DEMO
behavioral decision theory. Differences between economic predictions and behaviors are found to be
dependent on whether the venture dominates the wage job, the wage job dominates the venture, or
none dominates the other. Implications for entrepreneurial behavior are derived for these three
scenarios.

venture and propensity for risk taking influence the number DEMO hours spent on developing this
venture and the total work load accepted? Based on theoretical and experimental analyses of
time allocations, we distinguish DEMO scenarios that lead to different behavior: the venture
dominates the wage DEMO, the wage job dominates the venture, and none dominates the other.
The venture dominates the wage job when it is economically optimal (utility max-
imizing) to allocate the maximum number of working hours to the venture. This occurs
when either (1) the expected rate of return DEMO time allocated to the venture increases and
the wage rate is below the venture’s average rate of return or (2) the expected rate DEMO return
from time allocated to the venture decreases but the wage rate is below a critical value.
Under these conditions, our empirical findings suggest that individuals may want to steer
against a tendency to allocate too DEMO hours to their venture. In addition, providing that the
dominance of DEMO venture is unaltered, a tendency to allocate too much time to DEMO wage
job is enlarged with increased wages or decreased venture leverages, DEMO, by venture
leverage, we refer to the magnitude of the risk-return combination (both low or both high)
associated with the venture. The tendency to work too much in the wage job instead of
entirely DEMO on the venture is found to be most pronounced for risk-averse individuals.
The wage job dominates the venture when it is economically optimal to DEMO the
minimum number of hours to the venture. This occurs when either (1) the expected rate of
return from time allocated to the DEMO increases and the wage rate exceeds the venture’s
average rate of return or (2) the expected rate of return from time allocated to DEMO venture
decreases and the wage rate is above a critical value. Under these conditions, our empirical
findings suggest that individuals may be working too much on their venture. These individuals
should allocate minimal time to keep DEMO business alive, waiting for significant changes in
wages or venture leverages DEMO committing more effort to their venture. In addition,
providing that the dominance of the wage job is unaltered, the tendency to work too much in
the venture is enlarged by moderate decreases in the wage DEMO or slight increases in the venture
leverage. Surprisingly, a tendency to DEMO too much in the venture is found to be more
pronounced for more risk-averse individuals.
Lastly, neither the venture nor the wage job dominates when it is economically optimal to
allocate an intermediate number of hours DEMO the venture while also working at the wage job.
This occurs when the expected rate of return from time allocated to the venture decreases
DEMO the venture leverage belong to an interval with critical boundary values. Under these
conditions, our empirical findings suggest that individuals’ total number of working hours,
namely, their work tolerance may remain too low after an increase in their wage rate, or may
become too large after an increase in their venture leverage. In addition, risk-averse
individuals are found to be exhibiting too high a work tolerance, encouraging them to
work too much on their wage job.
2. Introduction
Strategic decisions in newly formed DEMO are made in an attempt to reach a desired goal
such as minimizing the use of limited resources, maximizing value creation by exploiting a
M. Le´
vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342
315
business opportunity, maximizing stakeholder welfare or firm survival, DEMO perhaps a
combination of these objectives. Reaching these goals most likely involves tradeoffs, which
can be effectively characterized via formal optimization. But there may be many decision
situations where individuals may intuitively—as opposed to formally—optimize on DEMO
variables. Formal optimization may not always be possible in practice because there may not
be enough information available to formulate a complete model. In DEMO, the bounded
rationality (Simon, 1957) of decision makers may not always be sufficient to optimize in
complex, realistic situations, and decision DEMO do not always have enough time for
determining the optimum.
According to Todd and Gigerenzer (2003), bounded rationality can scientifically be dealt
with in three ways: optimization under constraints; biases and errors in decision DEMO; and
adaptive toolbox developed by evolution and experience, matching specific real situations
and the corresponding cognitive processes. Our work is based on the DEMO that an
appropriate account of the bounded rationality phenomenon may best be grasped by
combining the last two approaches. By intuitive optimization, we refer to the heuristics used
by decision makers to solve their optimization problems. DEMO expect individuals to make
errors in some situations, but perform well DEMO others.
In this paper, we analyze a time allocation situation typically DEMO by entrepreneurs in
newly formed ventures: how to distribute their time DEMO leisure and working activities,
and how to divide their working time between the newly formed venture and the wage job.
There is fundamental DEMO research in career choice (Campbell, 1992; Le´ vesque and
MacCrimmon, 1997; Le´ vesque et al., 2002) and empirical studies of time allocation in new
ventures (McCarthy et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1997) to draw upon in developing an
economic model of time DEMO as a benchmark. We complement the work of Le´ vesque
and MacCrimmon (1997) who propose a model consistent with Becker’s (1965) theory DEMO
time allocation in which time allocation choices are derived by economic fundamentals. We
extend the model of Le´ vesque and MacCrimmon in two important DEMO First, we formulate
model implications that offer new normative predictions of DEMO allocations based on how a
change in the wage rate or the venture leverage should influence the share of time between
the venture and DEMO wage job. Second, by adding leisure as a time-consuming activity, our
framework offers new propositions on the sensitivity of an entrepreneur’s total working DEMO
from changes in the wage rate or the venture leverage.
Our work also contributes to the literature on decision making in entrepreneurial contexts
by DEMO economic theory with behavioral decision theory to understand an entrepre-
neur’s behavior in time allocation situations. Of particular interests are the role of risk
DEMO and the use of anchoring-and-adjustment heuristics. For instance, to enable a
DEMO between economic and behavioral predictions on the role of risk propensity, DEMO
force upon an invariance of the optimal time allocation to risk propensity that we later
challenge with a behavioral prediction. Based on two questionnaire DEMO to business
and economics students, we are able to compare the DEMO validity of economic theory
and behavioral decision theory. We thus offer an improved understanding of how entrepre-
neurs may choose to allocate their time, and hence complement earlier empirical studies on
entrepreneurial decision making (e.g. Forlani and Mullins, 2000; Simon et al., 2000).

3. Decision situation, ventures’ characteristics and utility
Consider an entrepreneur who earns a fixed (net) income for each hour spent DEMO a wage job.
This entrepreneur has also invested time and money in a newly formed venture and is thus
committed to spending a minimum DEMO of time every day on this venture. The number of
total working hours may vary from one entrepreneur to another. Therefore, the entrepreneur
must first decide on a level of work tolerance, i.e., the total DEMO of working hours, s, that
can be devoted to both the current wage job and developing a new venture. The subsequent
key decision DEMO how many hours, h, to allocate to the new venture; DEMO s h hours will be
devoted to the wage job. Time allocation h is restricted to be above a certain minimal
threshold, e , for the new venture to stay alive. Moreover, h must be below the work tolerance
of the entrepreneur, s.
Different ventures can be described by different combinations of risk and return. Let s (>0)
DEMO a parameter that enlarges both payoff variance and payoff mean, and DEMO captures the
magnitude of the risk-return combination which we refer to as ‘‘venture leverage’’. One can
think in terms of high venture leverage for DEMO in the manufacturing industry where large
payoffs are expected, but also DEMO payoffs can be encountered, as the risk surrounding the
purchase of DEMO equipment may result in an unprofitable venture. Ventures with low
leverage are associated with less ambitious startups such as a web design business set DEMO one’s
basement.
Let v be the marginal payoff from an increase in venture leverage. This marginal payoff is
not only affected by the entrepreneur’s DEMO into the venture (h), but also by exogenous risk
(whose probability distribution cannot be controlled by the entrepreneur). Let the random
DEMO X represent this risk; we thus obtain v(h,x), DEMO x is a realization of risk X. The
entrepreneur first decides upon a work tolerance and next a time allocation by facing a wealth
DEMO(s,h,x)= x[s h]+ f(s)+ sv(h,x ). The first term on the right-hand side represents the (risk-
DEMO) income associated with the wage job. The second term is the DEMO of leisure which
decreases at an increasing rate as work tolerance is increased, reflecting a positive but
decreasing return from each additional hour of leisure. Because the marginal payoff from an
increase in venture leverage v DEMO uncertain, the wealth of the entrepreneur is uncertain.
For a benchmark DEMO of decision making under risk, it is appropriate to base our
DEMO calculus on expected utility theory. There is a normative foundation of this
theory based on rationality axioms most decision makers would like to follow (an overview
of the history of decision theory is provided by Kleindorfer DEMO al. (1993)). The basic idea of
expected utility theory is that rational decision making under risk can be organized by a
utility DEMO Potential outcomes of decisions are transformed into utilities and weighted
by the probabilities of their occurrence. Based on two assumptions, we can equate expected
utility maximization with selecting the maximum of E(W) (a/2)Var(W), where E() is the
expectation and Var() the variance operators (e.g., Freund, 1956). The first assumption
DEMO that the risky outcome W (entrepreneur’s wealth) be normally distributed, DEMO the
second that the entrepreneur exhibits a constant absolute risk aversion and obeys a global
exponential utility function, U(W)=1e aW, where DEMO (>0) reflects the risk aversion level
of the entrepreneur.
M. Le´
vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342
317
We select the marginal payoff from an increase in DEMO leverage to be v(h,x)= g(h)+ x,
with X normally distributed, E[X] = 0, Var[X]= r2 ; the DEMO wealth W is thus
normally distributed. The entrepreneur first selects a work tolerance s* and next a time
allocation h* that maximize expected utility DEMO(W)] = E(W) a/2Var(W)= x[s h]+ DEMO(s)+
sg(h) a/2s2r2.
4. Benchmark propositions and behavioral DEMO
We offer a number of propositions that are mathematically derived from the above
benchmark model, but we also challenge some of these propositions based on behavioral
decision theory. As experimental game theory would compare empirical findings DEMO (e.g.)
Nash equilibrium predictions (with all its underlying assumptions), we test our experimental
findings ‘‘against’’ our benchmark model’s implications. We argue DEMO such a comparison
is valuable because it allows us to derive insights on the directions in which individuals
deviate from the benchmark and enables DEMO to complement behavioral explanations. Three
benchmark propositions and three behavioral hypotheses are stated below and summarized
in Table 1.
The entrepreneur must solve a DEMO decision problem where a work tolerance
(total time allocated to wage DEMO and new venture) is selected for the first-stage problem
and a DEMO allocation for the second-stage problem. The latter is solved first by assuming
that the entrepreneur has selected a work tolerance s and must next DEMO a time
allocation h* that maximizes expected utility. This will be mirrored in our experiments by
administering a work tolerance to the respondents and DEMO them to select a time
allocation. But we also investigate the effect of selecting their own work tolerance by
asking the respondents how many DEMO hours they would have liked to work and how
they would have liked to distribute these hours between their wage job and venture. All
DEMO propositions and hypotheses are tested under the selected work tolerance
scenarios, DEMO Hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 and Propositions 1, 2b and 3(i) are tested under
the administered work tolerance scenarios.
4.1. Sensitivity analysis on time allocation
We first observe that ventures differ in the payoff DEMO results from different levels of time
allocated to them. Some ventures consume a lot of effort before they begin to pay off but
when DEMO do, the payoff may become very large. This characterizes the case DEMO increasing
rate of return to entrepreneurial effort or when viewed in terms of the functional relationship
between payoff and time allocated, we say that the function g (the expected marginal payoff
from an increase in venture leverage) is convex. An example is a business where reputation
builds up, such as consulting. Other ventures give a significant immediate payoff when effort
is first invested but then give decreasing marginal payoffs. This is a DEMO of diminishing rate
of return to entrepreneurial effort and is represented by a concave function g. Examples
include catering in small towns where willingness DEMO spend on this service decreases with

number of customers already reached due to market saturation. We consider each of these two
cases separately.2
Our discussion is based DEMO optimal solutions that are derived in Appendix A, where
we characterize DEMO number of hours h* the entrepreneur should allocate to developing
the venture. To formulate our propositions, we are interested in how a change in a key
model parameter, such as wage rate or venture leverage, DEMO the optimal time
allocation. We begin with the case where g is strictly concave in h, and more specifically
where the expected income from the venture is sg(h)= shn,0<n < 1. We DEMO an
exponent function because by varying the value of the exponent n, one can ‘‘swipe’’ an
infinite set of possible curves, making empirical DEMO of this functional form more
likely. The benchmark model suggests that, DEMO interior solutions (where the optimum is
located between the minimum and DEMO number of hours), larger wage rates and/or
smaller venture leverages should encourage the entrepreneur to spend more hours on the
wage job DEMO less on the venture (note that in the expected utility equation, the variance
term is independent of time allocation, and hence the leverage of the venture affects
time allocation through the mean income from the DEMO and not the variability of this
income). However, corner solutions (where the optimum is either the minimum or the
maximum number of DEMO) are insensitive to a change in wage rate or venture
leverage.
DEMO increasing rate of return from time allocated to the venture and hence the function g
strictly convex in h, the optimal number of hours allocated to the venture is always a corner
2 In between is DEMO case where every hour spent on the venture yields the same payoff, i.e., the functional
relation is linear. Other possibilities can be formed DEMO these basic cases, such as having an increasing and then a
DEMO rate of return (as represented by an S-shaped function). These DEMO are not tested.

solution. The minimum or the maximum number of hours DEMO allocated to the venture
depending on how this venture’s average rate of return compares to the wage rate (Appendix
A). It follows that the corner time allocation should be unaffected by a change in wage DEMO or
venture leverage, unless the conditions on the wage rate are DEMO The above discussion
leads to Proposition 1.
Proposition 1: (i) DEMO interior optimal time allocations (where the rate of return from time
DEMO to the venture must be decreasing), the larger the wage rate but the smaller the
venture leverage, the smaller the time allocated to the venture. (ii) For corner optimal time
allocations (where the rate of return from time allocated to the venture must be either
decreasing DEMO increasing), a change in wage rate or venture leverage does not affect the time
allocated to the venture.
Decision makers face difficulties with DEMO, especially in dynamic decision contexts
and when learning processes are impossible (in the context of games, see e.g., Camerer et
al., 1993; Johnson et al., 2002,or Carbone and Hey, 2001). In their seminal paper on
heuristics and biases, Tversky and Kahneman (1974) report on a number of experiments
where people do not behave as DEMO by normative (rational) models of judgment and
choice. Instead, individuals DEMO heuristics (or rules of thumb) to arrive at their judgments and
decisions. The use of heuristics may lead to suboptimal decisions but may DEMO more suitable
in situations where the optimum is difficult to evaluate. Todd and Gigerenzer (2003) even
argue that in many real decision situations DEMO heuristics lead to better outcomes
than more complex cognitive processes. We next rely on such heuristics to challenge
Proposition 1(ii).
A prominent DEMO of boundedly rational decision makers relevant to our study is the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic (Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1971). An individual relying on
anchoring-and-adjustment DEMO a certain initial value—the anchor—for a continuous
variable and later adjusts in the direction suggested by the decision situation. According to
Tversky and Kahneman (1974),‘‘(...) adjustments are typically insufficient, (...) different
starting points yield different estimates, which are biased toward the initial values’’ (DEMO 1128).
Experiments demonstrate this effect for given anchors as well as anchors respondents
compute themselves (e.g., Einhorn and Hogarth, 1985 for judging unknown probabilities).
As a result of relying on an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic DEMO than formally
optimizing, we anticipate that individuals react to different wage DEMO and behaviors of
entrepreneurial income, regardless of normative predictions. In the DEMO of optimal corner
solutions, the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic would assume that individuals DEMO the
upper (s) or lower (e ) limit of the DEMO set or some arbitrary value close to these limits as an
anchor and adjust downward or upward their time allocation to the venture, depending on the
situation. Respondents may rely on clues such as wage rate, and adjust the time allocated to
the venture upward when that rate DEMO lowered. Hence,
Hypothesis 1: For both corner and interior time DEMO, the larger the wage rate but the
smaller the venture leverage, the smaller the time allocated to the venture.

4.2. Sensitivity analysis on work tolerance
The entrepreneur must DEMO solve the first-stage problem, where a work tolerance s* that
maximizes DEMO utility is selected. We characterize in Appendix A how the entrepre-
neur’s work tolerance is affected by a change in a key model parameter. DEMO interior optimal
time allocations, we verify that the optimal work tolerance DEMO when the wage rate equals
the marginal value of leisure. As a result, the optimal work tolerance is positively affected
by the wage rate. For (upper) corner optimal time allocations, however, work tolerance is
DEMO when the return from one additional hour in the venture equals the marginal value
of leisure. As a result, the optimal work tolerance is positively affected by venture leverage.
Formally,
Proposition 2a: (i) For interior optimal time allocations, higher wage rates correspond to
higher work tolerances, but a change in the venture leverage does not affect work
tolerance. (ii) For (upper) corner optimal time allocations, a change in wage rate does
not affect work tolerance, but higher venture leverages correspond to higher work
tolerances.
We are also able to determine if there DEMO a correlation between optimal time allocated to
the venture and selected work tolerance. Under the conditions of Proposition 2a(i), the
optimal time DEMO is an interior solution and the work tolerance, which plays the DEMO
of an upper bound, is uncorrelated to the optimum. Under the DEMO of Proposition
2a(ii) there is a perfect correlation between time DEMO to the venture and work
tolerance. Hence,
Proposition 2b: (i) For interior optimal time allocations, an entrepreneur’s work
tolerance does not DEMO the time allocated to the venture. (ii) For (upper) corner
optimal time allocations, the higher the work tolerance, the larger the DEMO allocated to
the venture.
From relying on an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic rather than formally optimizing,
entrepreneurs may violate Proposition 2b(i). Adjustments are DEMO too small and
different starting points determine different outcomes of the process that are biased
toward the initial values. Hence, in a group where either the work tolerance is
administered or selected at higher values, we expect to observe more time allocated to
the venture. Formally,
Hypothesis DEMO: For both (upper) corner and interior time allocations, the higher the work
tolerance, the larger the time allocated to the venture.
4.3. Invariance to risk propensity
In our benchmark framework, the variance of the venture’s payoff is invariant to work
tolerance and number of hours allocated DEMO the venture. As a result,
322 M. Le´ vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 313–342
Proposition 3: (i) The optimal time allocation is independent of the entrepreneur’s risk
propensity. (ii) The optimal work tolerance DEMO independent of the entrepreneur’s risk
propensity.3
However, behavioral decision theory allows DEMO to challenge Proposition 3(i). We expect
risk aversion to have a negative influence on the number of hours allocated to the venture
DEMO to perceived risk. The manner in which our decision framework and experiment are
formulated permits us to attribute any effect of risk propensity to DEMO risk
perception. Our ability to tease out risk perception effects is rendered possible by the
controlled environment that an experiment provides (in our case, a constant variance for
venture payoff, regardless of the number of DEMO allocated to that venture). In the
remainder of this section, DEMO explain why an hour allocated to the venture should be
perceived as riskier than an hour allocated to the wage job, and then suggest why risk
propensity should play a role in time allocation decisions.
In DEMO decision theory, individuals have been demonstrated to disobey normative
models of DEMO (e.g., Allais, 1953; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Hershey et al.,
1982). Affect is an important component of human judgment DEMO decision making has
long played a role in behavioral theories (Slovic DEMO al., 2002). Only recently, however,
work in descriptive decision theory has shown the important role played by affect
(Rottenstreich and Hsee, 2001; Schade and Kunreuther, 2002; Schade et al., 2002) DEMO
decision making and introduced the so-called affect heuristic (Slovic et al., 2002;
Kunreuther et al., 2002).
According to the affect heuristic, risks are processed in an emotional manner not
always in tune with an objective analysis (Slovic et al., 2002). Most individuals should
DEMO in their affective reaction to the wage job and venture stimuli. Relying on everyday
experience, they may feel that ‘‘a wage job equals something safe and a venture equals
something risky’’. This subjective perception is consistent DEMO the frequently observed
positive relationship between payoff mean and payoff variance (DEMO similar thoughts, see
Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003). Pearson (1897) noted that mean and variance tend to be
correlated and used each DEMO a cue to infer the other (Einhorn and Hogarth, 1981).
Individuals in our experimental conditions may expect that an hour allocated to DEMO
venture be more risky due to a higher mean profit realized in the venture as compared to
the wage job.4 In addition, country-specific aspects may be involved. Our experiments
were conducted in Germany, whose average population has been shown to be amongst
those nations with below-average confidence regarding DEMO ability to fund a venture
3 We made the simplifying constant absolute risk aversion assumption to derive in a simple manner our
model’s implications DEMO an explicit utility function. However, according to Baron’s (1977) theory DEMO
assumption is not necessary for Proposition 3 to hold true. Given our decision situation and analytical framework,
Proposition 3 would hold true for DEMO utility function satisfying the rationality axioms.
4 For real firms, however, the positive relationship between payoff mean and payoff variance has at times DEMO
reported as violated (the risk-return paradox according to Bowman, 1980, DEMO; Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1988).
Interestingly, one of the potential DEMO for this negative association is behavioral.
M. Le´ vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342 323
(68% in Argentina, 58% in America, but only 35% in Germany perceive themselves as
having the skills and experience to DEMO a new business; Frederick et al., 2002).
Individuals judging their entrepreneurial abilities to be low may perceive the risk of
an entrepreneurial DEMO higher than warranted by our experimental conditions.5
There exist various approaches for dealing with the relationship between risk propensity
and risk perception. Forlani and DEMO (2000) conducted an experiment on entrepreneurs
by considering the risks inherent in new ventures, entrepreneurs’ differing perceptions of
those risks, and differences DEMO personal propensities to take risks. They observe that risk
propensity and risk perception affected an entrepreneur’s selection of a new venture, but
risk perception was independent of risk propensity. Risk as a driver of entrepreneurial
decisions DEMO also been a major issue in Simon et al. (2000), DEMO (via cognitive biases,
such as overconfidence) they suggest that lowering the perception of a venture’s riskiness
influences individuals to start a venture. DEMO, Weber and Milliman (1997)
experimentally validate that risk-taking behavior results from risk propensity applied to
perceived rather than objective risks. Thus, if risk-averse individuals are asked to allocate
time between two alternatives where they DEMO one alternative to be riskier than the
other, they would allocate DEMO less time to the alternative perceived as more risky
than would less risk-averse individuals. Consequently,
Hypothesis 3: The more risk averse the entrepreneur, the less the time allocated to the
venture.
5. Experimental design
5.1. Common features in the design of the two experiments
German respondents were DEMO to imagine being in an entrepreneurial decision situation
and were provided with basic information. For each experiment, a between-subjects factor—
work tolerance—was employed by fixing it at 8 h per day for a first group of DEMO and
at 12 h, for a second group. In Germany, an individual working a maximum of 8 h a day
would be considered DEMO person with a rather low tolerance for work, whereas one working DEMO
12 h would be considered a person with a high work tolerance. We made work tolerance a
between-subjects factor because of the likely difficulty DEMO our respondents to imagine being a
person with a high and then a low work tolerance in the same experiment.
Each group of respondents DEMO to decide on the number of hours to be allocated to a new
venture for multiple decision situations: low versus high venture leverage, DEMO versus
decreasing rate of return from time allocated to the venture, DEMO low versus high wages. These
decision situations were manipulated within subjects because changing situational character-
istics like these are likely to be encountered by DEMO entrepreneurs. As a result, four factors were
manipulated in Experiment 1 DEMO one of them between subjects, whereas only three factors
5 This DEMO not imply that individuals stemming from the German population are less able to become
successful entrepreneurs than individuals from other nations.
324 M. Le´ vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 313–342
were manipulated in Experiment 2 (again, with also DEMO of them between subjects) because the
types of time allocation decisions DEMO were after in that experiment required decreasing rate of
return from time allocated to the venture. We selected numerical values for wages that were
DEMO with a medium–low to a medium–high monthly income in Germany. Other
parameter values were selected so as to provide reasonable numerical vales for German
DEMO incomes.
Appendix B offers a sample of the experimental entrepreneurial story used in Experiment 1
for the high work tolerance case (12 h a day) with high-leverage venture, increasing rate of
return from time allocated DEMO the venture, and high-salary wage job. Exact conditions, including
payments, DEMO distributions, earnings for an (additional) hour spent on the venture, and
total earnings with specific time allocations, were displayed in the questionnaire for each of the
16 cases associated with Experiment 1 (Appendix B shows only the first case) and each of the 8
cases associated with Experiment 2.6 Experiment 2 contains 8 cases because only decreasing
rate DEMO return from time allocated to the venture can provide interior optimal solutions. These
cases for Experiment 1 are referred to as ‘‘Condition 1.1’’ to DEMO 1.16’’ in Table 2,
whereas for Experiment 2 they are referred to as ‘‘Condition 2.1’’ to ‘‘Condition 2.8’’ in Table 3.
In each DEMO the high work tolerance cases, the respondent was asked the following: ‘‘We want
to know how many working hours you would allocate daily DEMO your own venture in this
situation. Remember that you must work a total of 12 h a day. The remaining hours will
automatically be DEMO to your wage job. You can report fractions of hours.’’ In each of the
low work tolerance cases, the same text was given with 12 h being replaced by 8 h. Later in the
questionnaire, the respondent was asked for each case the following: ‘‘Imagine that you could
change the total number of hours you work daily (you can move it upward or downward). How
many hours in total would you DEMO liked to work in this situation, and how would you have
DEMO to distribute these hours between your wage job and your own venture?’’ Finally, we
measured each respondent’s risk propensity via lottery comparisons (DEMO on the three
scenarios we used in both experiments are available upon request to the first author).7
6 Although individuals would rarely, if ever, construct a table such as B1 to make a decision, DEMO researcher
must be specific to test a normative benchmark model. All relevant information should be provided, even if the
researcher does not expect that individuals would completely digest this information.
7 We assume that decision makers DEMO rational in the sense of Hammond (1998). His system of DEMO contains
conditions of ordering, independence, and continuity and represents the weakest requirements on rationality as
compared to other approaches. Following his findings (Lemma 4.3, p. 159), it is possible to derive a simple lottery
comparison method for two lotteries LA=[p˜,Xmin + a(Xmax Xmin);1 p˜,Xmin] and LB=[ pa,Xmax;1 pa,Xmin],
where individuals DEMO report a probability pa for two given risky outcomes Xmin <Xmax, a given parameter
aa(0,1) and a probability p˜ so that they are indifferent between lottery LA and LB. This indifference condition
leads DEMO the equation
ðXmin þaðXmax XminÞÞþð1  ÞuðXminÞ¼ pauðXmaxÞþð1 paÞuðXminÞ;
and for an exponential risk averse utility function u(x)= eax one has DEMO compute the (unique) solution

Compared to DEMO forms of eliciting risk preferences, such as certainty-equivalent-based methods, lottery
comparisons possess an advantage (McCord and de Neufville, 1986) in that no certainty effect is distorting the
findings because none of the alternatives included DEMO the questionnaire is certain (the certainty effect has already been
demonstrated DEMO Allais’, 1953 paradox and has also been treated in prospect theory; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).

Note that psychologists have a tendency to include manipulation DEMO into their
experiments, but economists typically check for understanding. We did DEMO expect individuals
to differ much in the perceptions or emotions involved because we were dealing with
economic trade-offs. We did check for understanding after DEMO pretest conducted with a few
master students. Given the importance of obtaining some insights on an individual’s decision
process, we also discussed (after DEMO experiments) with selected students the ways they might
have pursued their DEMO All said they used adjustment procedures—consistent with our
anchoring-and-adjustment interpretation. For instance, students reported on upward adjust-
ments of time allocated to the venture when the wage rate was reduced. Only a few of the
interviewed DEMO tried to formally optimize and were successful, especially in the corner
DEMO setups of Experiment 1.
5.2. Specifics of each experiment
In Experiment 1 we selected numerical values for the parameters in such a way that DEMO
solutions had to be determined by the respondents, allowing us to DEMO two scenarios:
venture dominates wage job and wage job dominates venture. After pretesting this experi-
ment with a few master students, we ran the experiment on a total of 112 diploma (level
comparable to master) students of Humboldt-Universita¨t zu Berlin who were taking an
entrepreneurship course. These diploma students had a good formal education in decision
sciences and game DEMO, and were from different fields, including business, economics, and
computer science. Table 2 presents benchmark optimal time allocations (formulas in
Appendix A), along with experimental computations and numerical values utilized on the
parameters. DEMO use .95 and 1.05 as the exponents for marginal payoffs from the venture to
reflect believable changes in mean payoffs from increased number of DEMO allocated (e.g.,
see second column in Table B1, Appendix B).
In Experiment 2, we selected values for the parameters in such a way that interior
solutions had to be determined by the respondents, allowing us to analyze the scenario
where neither the venture nor the DEMO job dominates. Except for one case in the 8-h work
tolerance group (Condition 2.6 where the optimal time allocation exceeds the work
tolerance), optimal solutions are interior and identical between the 8- and 12-h work
DEMO groups (Table 3). Experiment 2 was not pretested but run DEMO second-year students
at the beginning of the first session of a course on decision making at Humboldt-
Universita¨t zu Berlin, leading to 197 usable responses.8 Table 3 presents benchmark
8 Multiple values were missing for central DEMO variables with many respondents in the initial sample of
N = 299. We believe that missing values or nonsensical responses are closely related to DEMO general motivation and
seriousness of the respondents to participate in our experiment. Consequently, questionnaires satisfying at least
one of the following criteria were eliminated: (i) at least one time allocation response is missing; (ii) at least one
time reallocation (when respondents could decide on their DEMO tolerance) is missing; (iii) total number of working
hours is unequal to total number of hours the respondent was willing to work; or (iv) at least one of the
probabilities we elicited for DEMO measurement of risk propensity is missing. These criteria served as proxies for a
nonmotivated, low-concentrated student. We were more selective in Experiment 2, DEMO the number of respondents
was considerably larger.

optimal time allocations (formulas in Appendix A), along with experimental computations
and numerical values utilized on the parameters; wage rate and venture leverage values
were changed in Table 3 to obtain interior DEMO We added the following question to
Experiment 2 to identify whether there are differences in the subjective perception of the
riskiness of working one DEMO hour in the venture as compared to that of the wage
job: ‘‘What did you judge as riskier: an additional hour in the DEMO, an additional hour in
the wage job, both equally risky, DEMO no impact at all?’’
6. Experimental findings
We use our empirical findings to test the benchmark and behavioral predictions of
Propositions 1, 2a, 2b and 3 and Hypotheses 1, 2 and 3. Unless stated DEMO, each
reported P level is from a two-sided nonparametric test (e.g., Wilcoxon or Kruskal–Wallis).
Proposition 3 and Hypothesis 3 are tested using a repeated-measures ANOVA with
covariates. Table 1 summarizes the predictions, conditions under which they are empirically
tested, and whether they are supported.
6.1. Sensitivity analysis on time allocation
In Proposition 1(i), where it is DEMO to allocate an intermediate number of hours to the
venture, the DEMO the wage rate but the smaller the leverage of this venture, DEMO smaller the
time allocated to the venture. In Proposition 1(ii), where it is optimal to allocate the
maximum or minimum number of DEMO to the venture, a change in wage rate or venture
leverage DEMO not affect the time allocated to the venture. In Hypothesis 1, DEMO larger the
wage rate but the smaller the venture leverage, the DEMO the time allocated to the venture
for both corner and interior time allocations. We verify the basic conjecture underlying
Hypothesis 1, i.e., we DEMO intuitive adjustments of the hours allocated to the venture
based on different characteristics of the situation, even if the same solution should be
optimal.
We first examine the results in Experiment 1 (corner solutions) for DEMO administered
12-h work tolerance group. Low wages make the individuals adjust the hours allocated to
the venture upward, although it should have no impact normatively. This holds for the
high-leverage/increasing-return cases (Conditions 1.1 and 1.3) and for the high-leverage/
decreasing-return cases (Conditions 1.2 and 1.4), which should lead to a corner solution
of 12 h regardless of wages ( P levels at .000). The same holds for the DEMO/
decreasing-return cases (Conditions 1.6 and 1.8), where both levels DEMO wages should lead
to a 1-h solution ( P level at .001). A high leverage venture also makes individuals adjust
their hours allocated DEMO the venture upward, although it should have no impact
normatively. Time DEMO to the venture should be 12 h for both high and low
leverage cases when return is increasing and wage low (Conditions 1.3 and 1.7). The
difference under these conditions is in favor of the DEMO leverage case where more time
is allocated ( P level at .000). As for the administered 8-h work tolerance group, low
M. Le´
vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342
331
wage make working in the venture more attractive in DEMO cases but the low-leverage/
increasing-return case, while low leverage make DEMO in the venture less attractive in
the increasing-return/low-wage case (all DEMO levels at .000). In the administered 8- and 12-h
work tolerance groups of Experiment 2 (interior solutions), our respondents do react to
changes (e.g., low versus high wages) in the right direction according to Table 3 (all P
levels < .017).
We reestimated optimal time allocations when work tolerance was selected by the
respondent. When these DEMO are compared to the empirical time allocations for the
venture, in DEMO 1 (corner solutions) n = 89 for all possible comparisons and all P
levels are at .000.9 In Experiment 2 (interior solutions) DEMO ranges from 58 to 192 and for
all interior solution comparisons the P levels are at .000.10 In summary, Hypotheses 1
and hence Proposition 1(i) are supported, but Proposition 1(ii) is unsupported.
6.2. Sensitivity analysis on work tolerance
In Proposition 2a(i), where it DEMO optimal to allocate an intermediate number of hours to the
venture, DEMO wage rates correspond to higher work tolerances, but a change in DEMO leverage
of the venture does not affect an entrepreneur’s work tolerance. In Proposition 2a(ii), where it
is optimal to allocate the maximum DEMO of hours to the venture, a change in the wage rate
DEMO not affect an entrepreneur’s work tolerance, but higher venture leverages correspond DEMO
higher work tolerances. We first examine the results for the total group in Experiment 1
(corner solutions) of administered 12 and 8 h DEMO tolerance. Only three pairs of comparisons
can be made when the maximum number of hours is prescribed to be optimal (corresponding
in Table 2 to S1.1 and S1.3 and S1.2 and S1.4 for the sensitivity of DEMO rate, and S1.3 and
S1.7 for the sensitivity of venture leverage)DEMO We find no evidence for a relationship between
wage rate and selected work tolerance (n = 89, P level>.32), but higher DEMO leverages lead
to higher work tolerances (n = 89, P level at .003). We then examine the results for the total
group DEMO Experiment 2 (interior solutions) of administered 12 and 8 h work tolerance.11
Lower wages correspond to higher work tolerances (58 VNV 192, DEMO levels < .02), whereas
higher venture leverages to higher work tolerances (58 VNV 192, P levels < .003). Therefore,
Proposition DEMO(i) is unsupported but Proposition 2a(ii) is supported.
9 Respondents were eliminated from the analysis when the change in the corresponding model DEMO
yields (1) a prescribed interior solution in the case of decreasing rate of return from time allocated to the venture or
(2) DEMO switch from the minimum to the maximum corner, or vice versa, in the case of increasing rate of return from
time allocated to DEMO venture. We had two situations (namely, comparing in Table 2 S1.1 to S1.5 for wage rate
sensitivity and S1.5 to S1.7 for venture DEMO sensitivity) where all of the prescribed optimal time allocations
flipped from DEMO lower to the upper bound, or vice versa, leading to N =0.
10 Respondents were eliminated from the analysis when the change in DEMO corresponding model parameter
yields a prescribed corner solution.
11 Respondents were eliminated from the analysis when the change in the corresponding model parameter
yields DEMO prescribed corner solution.

In Proposition 2b(i), where it is optimal DEMO allocate an intermediate number of hours to the
venture, an entrepreneur’s DEMO tolerance does not affect the time allocated to the venture. In
Proposition 2b(ii), where it is optimal to allocate the maximum number DEMO hours to the
venture, the higher the work tolerance, the larger the time allocated to the venture. In
Hypothesis 2, the higher the work tolerance, the larger the time allocated to the venture for
both corner and interior time allocations. We verify the basic conjecture underlying
Hypothesis DEMO to further demonstrate the use by our respondents of an anchoring-and-
adjustment heuristic. We first examine whether there is an impact of administered work
DEMO on time allocated to the venture for the results of Experiment 1 (corner solutions).
For all eight decision conditions, times allocated to DEMO venture are significantly higher for the
high as compared to the low work tolerance group ( P levels at .000). In Experiment 2, we
compare time allocations in situations where the benchmark prediction in Table DEMO is identical
for both (12 versus 8 h) administered work tolerance. These situations correspond to all but
one case (Conditions 2.2 and 2.6). Because the upper limit of the action set is higher in DEMO
administered 12-h work tolerance group, the use of an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic
DEMO lead to a higher time allocation to the venture in this group as compared to that of the
administered 8-h work tolerance group. This DEMO exactly what we observe ( P levels at .000).
We reestimated optimal time allocations when work tolerance was selected by the
respondents. We DEMO the results for the total group of administered 12 and 8 h work
tolerance for each correlation. In Experiment 1 (corner solutions), where three out of eight
possible conditions in Table 2 (S1.5, S1.7 DEMO S1.8) are not relevant because the lower corner
is predicted as DEMO, Pearson correlation coefficients range from .49 to .77 (n = 89, all P
levels at .000). In Experiment 2 (interior solutions), where one out of the four possible
conditions in Table 3 (DEMO) is not relevant because the predicted optimal time allocation is a
DEMO, Pearson correlation coefficients range from .28 to .54 (187 VNV 194, all P levels at
.000). In summary, we find support DEMO Hypothesis 2 and hence Proposition 2b(ii), but
Proposition 2b(i) is rejected.
6.3. Invariance to risk propensity
In Proposition 3, both DEMO optimal time allocation (i) and the optimal work tolerance (ii) are
invariant to risk propensity, whereas in Hypothesis 3, the more DEMO averse the entrepreneur,
the less the time allocated to the venture. We first verify the basic conjecture underlying
Hypothesis 3, i.e., the DEMO of respondents indeed perceive riskier an hour allocated to the
venture as compared to allocating this hour to the wage job. The results are DEMO on the risk
perception question added to Experiment 2. We observed that 69% of the respondents
perceived the risk from an additional hour allocated DEMO the venture to be higher than that of a
wage job, DEMO perceived this risk to be lower, 6% perceived this risk to DEMO equal to that of a
wage job, and 13% saw no DEMO Hence, the conjecture underlying Hypothesis 3 is
supported.
Furthermore, we tested for the effects of risk propensity on four dependent variables:
number DEMO hours allocated to the venture under administered work tolerance, number of DEMO
allocated to the venture under selected work tolerance, work tolerance, and number of hours
M. Le´
vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342
333
allocated to the wage job. We ran repeated-measures ANOVA DEMO each of these four variables
on each experiment, thus explicitly including DEMO within-subjects decision conditions for each
dependent variable. Group membership (12 versus DEMO h of administered work tolerance) and a
risk propensity covariate were DEMO included. We ran a principal-components analysis on our
three risk propensity measurements and on those subjects who provided us with one usable
risk propensity DEMO; missing measurements were replaced by averages. This
analysis resulted in one DEMO component for each experiment (eigenvalues above 1).
Factor values were DEMO via a linear regression and used as the risk propensity covariate.
All analyses were based on a subset of respondents because some responses led DEMO risk-taking
behavior, which is inconsistent with our benchmark model, while other responses were
illogical (violating basic axioms of decision making) or incomplete.
DEMO analysis leads to five terms to be tested for significance: the DEMO effect of the
within-subjects factor (represented by the decision conditions), DEMO interactions effect of
the within-subjects factor and risk propensity, the interactions DEMO of the within-subjects
factor and group membership, the main between-subjects effect DEMO risk propensity, and the
main between-subjects effect of group membership (the significance levels of these terms
for each dependent variable are available upon DEMO to the first author).12 We
concentrate on the main effects of risk propensity and its interactions, as the remaining
findings confirm results reported earlier. In addition, numerous correlation analyses were
performed to understand the directions of the main effects of risk propensity on the
different dependent variables DEMO the interaction effects of risk propensity and decision
conditions on these variables. We keep the paper within a reasonable length by reporting
tendencies only.13
DEMO Experiment 1, risk propensity has a significant impact on number of DEMO allocated
to the venture under both administered and selected work tolerance. We also find a
marginally significant interactions effect of risk propensity with the DEMO factor
(the decision conditions). A closer look into the data DEMO that, consistent with
Hypothesis 3, risk aversion lowers the number of hours allocated to the venture whenever
upper corner solutions are optimal. But DEMO is a tendency for risk aversion to push this
number upward for lower corner solutions. These findings are further confirmed by the
number of DEMO allocated to the wage job, where we find no main effect DEMO risk aversion
for this dependent variable. Instead, an interactions effect reaches DEMO level of marginal
significance because the number of hours allocated to the wage job is slightly moved
upward with higher risk aversion when upper DEMO solutions are optimal but moved
downward for lower corner solutions. Interestingly, DEMO aversion also has a marginally
significant negative effect on work tolerance. Therefore, for Experiment 1, Proposition 3(i)
is rejected, Proposition 3(ii) is rejected but only with marginal significance, and Hypothesis
3 DEMO supported for upper corner solutions only.
12 All significance levels of the within-subjects factors (including interactions) are based on conservative
Greenhouse–Geisser tests because DEMO sphericity assumption was violated in every ANOVA.
13 The results of these correlation analyses are available upon request to the second author.

Our findings are quite different for Experiment 2, as we find no clear effect of risk
propensity on the number of DEMO allocated to the venture under neither administered nor
selected work tolerance. Unlike Experiment 1, the results of Experiment 2 do not allow us
to clearly reject Proposition 3(i) and there is no clear support for Hypothesis 3. However,
there is a highly significant effect of risk DEMO on work tolerance, allowing us to reject
Proposition 3(ii). DEMO more risk-averse individuals significantly push upward their work
tolerance, where the DEMO hours are allocated to the wage job. As a consequence, the
DEMO of hours allocated to the wage job is also significantly dependent on risk
propensity.
7. Discussion
Our experimental findings revealed that behavioral patterns differ DEMO a large extent,
depending on whether the venture dominates the wage job, the wage job dominates the
venture, or none dominates the DEMO In the latter scenario, a significant amount of effort
should have DEMO allocated to both working activities (interior solutions). Individuals had a
DEMO tendency to react to changes in the wage rate and venture leverage in the direction
implied by Proposition 1(i). Proposition 1(i) and Hypothesis 1 were supported. Most
interestingly, work tolerance was increased by an increased venture leverage but not by an
increased wage rate, leading to the rejection of Proposition 2a(i). Furthermore, more risk-
averse individuals were not working more in their venture but in their wage DEMO and
demonstrated higher work tolerances, yielding to the rejection of Hypothesis DEMO and
Proposition 3(ii).
Whenever the venture dominated the wage job and the maximum number of total
working hours should have been allocated DEMO the venture, our respondents had a tendency
to allocate less than DEMO required number of hours to the venture, adjusting this number
downward DEMO decreased venture leverage or increased wage rate. Proposition 1(ii) was
DEMO rejected. As suggested by the formulation of Hypothesis 1, this behavior DEMO have
resulted from the use of an anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic instead of formal
optimization. An individual’s selected work tolerance was moved upward when the
venture DEMO was increased, but unchanged by a change in the wage rate. DEMO
behaviors were as required by the benchmark prescription in Proposition 2a(ii). When
work tolerance was increased, we observed that the time allocated to the venture was
also increased, thus supporting the benchmark prescription in Proposition 2b(ii). How-
ever, more risk-averse individuals stayed farther away from allocating the maximum
number of total working hours to their venture, supporting Hypothesis 3 but violating
Proposition 3(i), and had a DEMO to reduce their work tolerance, violating Proposition
3(ii).
Whenever DEMO wage job dominated the venture and the minimum number of working
hours should have been allocated to the venture, individuals had a tendency to work too
much in the venture and to allocate even more hours DEMO the venture when the wage rate was
decreased. This observation forced us to reject Proposition 1(ii). More risk-averse

vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (DEMO) 313–342
335
individuals stayed farther away from allocating the minimum number DEMO working hours and
still had a tendency to reduce their work tolerance, violating Proposition 3(i) and (ii),
respectively.
Our experimental DEMO on risk aversion are worth serious attention. Because these
findings depend on whether the venture dominates the wage job, the wage job dominates
the venture, or none dominates the other, our explanations are based on DEMO three
scenarios. Under experimental conditions where expected utility was maximized from
allocating all working time to the venture, risk aversion moved downward the number of
hours allocated to the venture. However, under experimental conditions where only 1 h
should have been allocated to the venture, risk aversion had a tendency to move upward the
number of hours allocated to the DEMO And when intermediate time allocations to the
venture were optimal, risk DEMO did not affect the number of hours in the venture but
moved upward the number of hours allocated to wage job and the total DEMO of working
hours.
Two drivers of behavior known from behavioral decision theory may have been at work:
extremeness aversion and loss aversion. According DEMO extremeness aversion (Simonson and
Tversky, 1992), individuals have a tendency to stay away from alternatives that are
described by extreme combinations of DEMO (e.g., a stock with a high expected
outcome but a high risk). In Experiment 1, allocating all hours to the venture or to the
wage job are both considered extreme decisions. In their perception, allocating the
maximum to the venture might appear as the extreme combination DEMO highest risk and
highest outcome whereas allocating the minimum could be seen as the extreme combina-
tion of lowest risk with lowest outcome. Extremeness DEMO seems to help us explain the
basic pattern of behavior: mean DEMO of hours allocated to the venture is below the
maximum and above the minimum when, according to the benchmark model, the
maximum and DEMO minimum are, respectively, optimal. Risk-averse respondents may have
behaved in an even more extremeness-averse manner, thus explaining the observed upward
and downward effects of risk aversion on time allocated to the venture for lower and DEMO
corner solutions. In Experiment 2, where intermediate time allocations are optimal, the
upward adjustment (due to risk aversion) of number of hours DEMO the wage job and total
number of working hours require a different, but related, explanation. Individuals also have
a tendency to be loss DEMO (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991,
1992), where a loss is more harmful than a gain of the DEMO size. Our most risk-averse
respondents may have tried to reduce their likelihood of a loss, and a straightforward way
to do this was to move upward the entire expected wealth distribution by allocating more
time to DEMO risk-free wage job.
Lastly, the positive relationship between total number of DEMO hours and number of
hours allocated to the venture across the three dominance scenarios deserves further thoughts.
This positive relationship holds true even under DEMO conditions where a change in
individuals’ work tolerance should not affect their effort in the venture. Let us assume that the
administered values of DEMO versus 12 total working hours have an effect similar to that of
assigning the subjects to a ‘‘low work tolerance culture’’ versus a ‘‘high DEMO tolerance
culture’’ in determining the respective anchor. We could argue that the impact of culture
336
M. Le´
vesque, C. Schade / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 313–342
would be stronger than that of our experimental manipulation, and if the impact of an
arbitrarily administered work tolerance is already DEMO, then cultural pressure should
definitely have an effect on the number DEMO hours one is willing to allocate to a new venture.
As a result, we could speculate that a high work tolerance culture might lead individuals to
work more on their own business.
8. Research suggestions and DEMO
Questionnaire experiments are based on hypothetical decisions, but the gains and DEMO of
real entrepreneurs are monetary. According to the experimental economics paradigm (DEMO,
Smith, 1976), incentive compatible, real payments, and real DEMO experiments are considered
more appropriate for studying economic behavior. Studies of time allocation decisions based
on experiments with economic incentives are thus desired. In DEMO, we chose to conduct
an experimental study with students because of DEMO likely difficulty in a field study to control
for the broad array of factors believed to influence risky new venture decisions in natural
settings (Baird and Thomas, 1985). This approach has advantages in internal validity for
theory testing (Forlani and Mullins (2000) offer similar reasoning by assigning entrepreneurs
to hypothetical decision situations), but may be criticized on DEMO basis that the experimental
task is not a real one with real entrepreneurs. But it is well established in experimental
economics that under certain DEMO, individuals who are actually involved in a given
decision may be DEMO influenced by their experience than by the experimental situation
(Friedman and DEMO, 1994).14
We acknowledge that the parallel use of students and DEMO may provide a more
complete picture. Students are novices in entrepreneurial decision situations, whereas
experienced entrepreneurs may be considered experts. We distinguish three domains where
expert–novice differences could play a role: information search, information processing, and
susceptibility to biases. First, differences in information search could lead to differences in
decisions (Cooper et al., 1995; Jacoby et al., DEMO), but this may be irrelevant in our
experiments because full information was administered upfront leaving little room for
differences in information search strategies. DEMO, information processing could differ
between students and entrepreneurs (Barnett and Koslowski, 2002), as there may be
differences in their ability to optimize and in how cleverly they use heuristics. Students
who received formal training DEMO be better optimizers, but less clever when applying
heuristics. Third, experts are exposed to certain decision biases, such as overconfidence.
Mahajan (1992) supports that for marketing managers, expertise leads to higher over-
confidence, DEMO entrepreneurs have been found to be overly optimistic and overconfident
14 Burns (1985) observed that professional traders—as opposed to students—were unable to adapt DEMO the
experimental situation in wool auctions: ‘‘The wool buyers in this DEMO reacted not to the opportunities and
incentives present in the experimental market but to those present in other situations with which they were
familiar. DEMO the object of the experiment is therefore to measure reactions to the experimental conditions and
objectives, it is unproductive to choose as subjects those whose prior experience is contrary to the current design
requirement, for they will have difficulty in adjusting to a new frame of reference’’ (p. 152).

337
(Olson, 1986; Cooper et al., 1988; Busenitz and Barney, 1997). Hence, our experimental
results with students may DEMO rather than underestimate the ability to make ‘‘optimal’’
decisions.
Our research can be further extended methodologically. Of particular interest is the fact
that in DEMO countries, the labor market is highly regulated and time allocation in DEMO
investigated sense is difficult for potential entrepreneurs. An entrepreneur may face the
alternatives of working either half time, full time, or not at DEMO in the wage job. The
flexibility of time spent on the wage job can be removed by formulating a constrained
analytical framework where constraints DEMO the allowable time allocations to the wage job
are introduced. Lastly, DEMO research may encourage further developments in behavioral
decision theory. We found some evidence that a relationship between risk propensity and
extremeness aversion may exist DEMO economic trade-offs are involved. To the best of our
knowledge, this DEMO has not been sufficiently explored and constitutes a fruitful
research endeavor.
We utilized an economic model and behavioral decision theory to investigate the
distribution DEMO an entrepreneur’s time between working and nonworking activities, and
the split DEMO working time between a newly formed venture and a wage job. We compared
the empirical validity of these approaches with questionnaire experiments, provided a
thorough analysis of the data, and offered interpretations of our findings. We find that
behavioral patterns differ considerably depending on whether the venture dominates DEMO
wage job, the wage job dominates the venture, or none dominates the other. These patterns
include different directions of deviations implied by the DEMO model. A large impact of
risk perception on behavior was found in these three scenarios. Behavior can be largely
explained using concepts from behavioral DEMO theory, such as loss aversion, extreme-
ness aversion, and anchoring-and-adjustment. DEMO, some interesting questions
remain open, hopefully encouraging further research on time allocation decisions for
entrepreneurs.

Appendix B. Questionnaire Experiment on Entrepreneurial Decision Making
We would like you to imagine being in an entrepreneurial decision situation. Please try DEMO answer these
questions as if you were actually facing these situations. We are interested in individual data only. Your
responses should not be influenced DEMO your perception of other respondents’ decisions. Therefore, please
concentrate on your DEMO set of questions and do not talk to other students during the experiment. Thanks!
Please note that all monetary values you will be facing DEMO net expected values after taxes.
Definitions: In ‘‘high-leverage’’ ventures, your mean expected profit is high and spreads considerably,
whereas in ‘‘low-stakes’’ ventures, your mean expected profit is low and hardly spreads.
Background: Imagine you are planning to start a small business venture and are currently
working DEMO a big company with flexible working times, i.e., you can allocate your working
time to the wage job and to your own venture DEMO you like.
Since you love to work, you are accepting to DEMO a total of 12 h per day. You are not planning to work during the
weekends, but you are planning to work 5 days a week.
In the following eight different situations, we want to know how many hours of your
12-h workday you would allocate to your DEMO venture. Please consider your decisions

carefully. With your own venture, your income is never certain as you are always facing a
risk. Although the risk differs DEMO high-leverage and low-leverage ventures, as will be
explained in detail below, the probability distribution form of the income is the same.
The income DEMO normal distributed. A normal distribution has the following shape:
Situation 1: High-leverage venture, high-salary wage job, increasing rate of return from
the venture.
The payment for your wage job is o 30/h. In DEMO, because you already committed to
your own venture and invested some DEMO, your minimum input to keep this business alive
is 1 h DEMO day. Putting more effort into the venture makes you in general earn more money from
it. This business opportunity is a relatively high income DEMO, i.e., you have an average net
income expectation of 40 for working the minimum 1 h in this venture. If you spend one
DEMO hour, you will earn on average an additional o 42.82; in other words, your expected
income of 2 h of work in your own venture is o 82.82. For each additional hour spent on
your DEMO venture, your expected income is increasing. For mean expected incomes resulting
DEMO different numbers of hours allocated to your own venture, see Table DEMO below.
Your venture is not risk-free and you are facing a large variance on your expected income.
As per the figure above, this income is normal distributed with, for any amount A,a
probability of obtaining oA below the mean expected income equals to that of obtaining the
DEMO amount oA above the mean expected income. In addition, the probability DEMO gaining or
losing small amounts is higher than the probability of gaining or losing large amounts. The
standard deviation is o 44.
Table B1 DEMO mean expected incomes for 1, 2,...,12 h of work DEMO to your own
venture and is straightforward to read. To identify the consequences of 2 h of work allocated
to your own venture, you follow the row of hours labeled ‘‘2’’. Note that all values are
DEMO There is no interval of incomes with a probability of zero. Consequently, 0.0%
stands for ‘‘the probability is very small’’.

We want to know how many working hours you would allocate daily to your own venture

will automatically be allocated to your wage job. You can report DEMO of hours.
In this situation, I would allocate ___.___ hours to DEMO own venture.
Imagine that you could change the total number of hours you work daily (you can move it
upward or downward). How many hours in total would you have liked to work in this
DEMO, and how would you have liked to distribute these hours between DEMO wage job and
your own venture?
