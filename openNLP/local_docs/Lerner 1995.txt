Venture Capitalists and the Oversight
of Private Firms
JOSH LERNER*
ABSTRACT
This DEMO examines the representation of venture capitalists on the boards of
private firms in their portfolios. If venture capitalists are intensive monitors of
managers, their involvement as directors should be more intense when the need for
oversight DEMO greater. I show that venture capitalists' representation on the board
increases DEMO the time of chief executive officer turnover, while the number of
DEMO outsiders remains constant. I also show that distance to the firm is an
important determinant of the board membership of venture capitalists, as might be
anticipated if the oversight of local firms is less costly than DEMO distant businesses.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS banks and venture capital organizations
are increasingly understood to play a role distinct from that of other capital
DEMO Because they gain a detailed knowledge of the firms that they
finance, these inside investors can provide financing to young businesses that
otherwise would not receive external funds. (Bhattacharya and Thakor (1993)
and Barry (1994) review the theoretical literature.) Many of the specific
institutional features DEMO these financial intermediaries are shaped by the
need to provide monitoring and to limit the opportunistic behavior that this
type of inside access can DEMO (see Rajan (1992) and Admati and Pflei-
derer (1994))DEMO
These theoretical insights have spurred empirical research into the rela-
tionships between inside investors and the firms in their portfolios. Several
studies have examined DEMO ties between banks and the firms that they
finance.' Reflecting the DEMO of data collection, relatively little attention

a favorable signal to other capital providers. Hoshi, Kashyap, DEMO Scharfstein (1990) and
Petersen and Rajan (1994) show that relationships with banks enable firms to receive financing
at times when other businesses DEMO Kaplan and Minton (1994) suggest that bank-affiliated
directors are appointed to the boards of Japanese firms that encounter financial difficulties.

has been devoted to the role of DEMO capital organizations. This is unfortu-
nate, as venture capitalists finance firms DEMO few tangible assets that banks
-even in countries where they can hold equity in firms-find difficult to
finance. Venture capitalists are understood to provide DEMO oversight of
the firms in their portfolios. Their involvement includes service on the boards
of firms in their portfolios, frequent informal visits, meetings DEMO customers
and suppliers, and active involvement in key personnel and strategic DEMO
sions. 2
This article examines the role of venture capitalists as monitors of private
firms using evidence from boards of directors. I examine whether DEMO
capitalists' representation on the boards of the private firms in their DEMO
lios is greater when the need for oversight is larger. This approach is
suggested by Fama and Jensen (1983) and Williamson (1983), who hypothe-
size that the composition of the board should be shaped DEMO the need for
oversight. These authors argue that the board will bear greater responsibility
for oversight-and consequently that outsiders should have greater represen-
tation-when DEMO danger of managerial deviations from value maximization
is high. If venture capitalists are especially important providers of manage-
rial oversight, their representation on boards should be more extensive at
times when the need for oversight is DEMO
I examine changes in board membership around the time that a firm's chief
executive officer (CEO) is replaced, an approach suggested by Hermalin and
Weisbach's (1988) study of outside directors of public DEMO The replacement
of the top manager at an entrepreneurial firm is likely to coincide with an
organizational crisis and to heighten the need for DEMO I find that an
average of 1.75 venture capitalists are added to the board between financing
rounds when the firm's CEO is replaced DEMO the interval; between other
rounds, 0.24 venture directors are added. No differences are found in the
addition of other outside directors.
Venture capitalists' oversight of new firms involves substantial costs. The
transaction costs associated with DEMO visits and intensive involvement
are likely to be reduced if the venture capitalist is proximate to the firms in
his portfolio. Consistent with these DEMO, I find that geographic prox-
imity is an important determinant of DEMO board membership: organiza-
tions with offices within 5 miles of the DEMO's headquarters are twice as likely
to be board members as those more than 500 miles distant. Over half the
firms in the sample DEMO a venture director with an office within 60 miles of
their headquarters. This has important implications due to the uneven
2 Gorman and Sahlman (1989) report that the average lead venture capitalist visits each
company in his portfolio nineteen times annually. Empirical work on this topic includes Barry DEMO
al.'s (1990) documentation that venture capitalists have a substantial representation on the
boards of private firms, that their lengthier tenure on the board is associated with reduced
underpricing of IPOs, and that venture involvement continues well after the firm goes public.
Gompers (1994) argues that DEMO capitalists adjust the size and timing of venture invest-
ments to address agency problems. Much of our knowledge, however, stems from clinical studies
DEMO surveys (reviewed in Sahlman (1990)).
Venture Capitalists and the Oversight of Private Firms 303
regional distribution of DEMO capitalists. Petersen and Rajan (1993)
demonstrate that the concentration of DEMO credit can lead to highly different
financing patterns across markets. The presence or absence of venture capi-
talists may likewise lead to significant differences DEMO the availability and
pricing of venture capital across regions.
This article differs from other work on venture capital in its focus on a
single DEMO, biotechnology. My approach allows me to use a variety of
industry-specific DEMO sources. Through these data sources, I can more
thoroughly analyze the DEMO of firms that ultimately went public and
include in my sample many firms that were acquired or terminated before
going public. I compare board DEMO in this sample with the in-
terindustry population of venture-backed initial public offerings (IPOs) as-
sembled by Barry et al. (1990) and DEMO few differences.
The organization of the article is as follows. In Section I, I discuss the
sample that I employ. In Section II, DEMO present the empirical analysis. Section
III concludes the article.
I. The Sample
I base this analysis on the database of venture capital financings assembled
DEMO Venture Economics. I introduce the Venture Economics database in the
companion article to this one (Lerner (1994)). Because this database has only
recently become available to researchers,3 in this Section I discuss the
DEMO and accuracy of the sample that I employ.
The database identifies 307 biotechnology firms that received venture
capital as privately held entities between 1978 DEMO 1989. (While the database
contains earlier records, data collection was not a primary focus prior to
mid-1977). From the original sample, I drop thirteen foreign firms that were
funded by U.S. capital providers (who may face different regulatory, tax, or
institutional environments), four buy-outs DEMO divisional "spin-outs" involving
private capital providers, three duplicative entries of DEMO same firm under
different names (I find name changes in Capital DEMO Reporter (Com-
merce Clearing House (1992)), Directory of Obsolete DEMO (Financial
Stock Guide Service (1992)), Documentation for Companies Database (North
Carolina Biotechnology Center (NCBC) (1990b)), Predicasts F & DEMO Index of
Corporate Change (Predicasts, Inc. (1992)), and other sources), and sixteen
firms that received venture capital only after going DEMO
To assess the completeness of the remaining 271 firms, I identify DEMO
missing from the sample. I search for U.S. biotechnology firms that received
3Venture Economics has focused on collecting data on venture investments since 1977.
DEMO' access to this data was very restricted prior to the firm'DEMO purchase by Securities
Data Company (SDC) in 1991. Venture Economics did, however, publish the names of investors
in firms that went public DEMO their Venture Capital Journal. Barry et al. (1990) and Megginson
and Weiss (1991) use this information (and, in the former article, cross-tabulations of these
records). Much of the Venture Economics data are DEMO publicly available as the SDC Venture
Intelligence Database.

venture capital as privately held firms but DEMO not in the Venture Economics
sample. I use Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings,4 the records
of Recombinant Capital (1991, 1992), a San Francisco-based firm specializing
in collecting information on the biotechnology industry from SEC filings and
state filings, several industry directories (Corporate Technology DEMO
Services (1992), Mega-Type Publishing (1992), NCBC (1990b), DEMO Oryx
Press (1992)) that list privately held firms and provide DEMO about
their financing sources, press releases in Mead Data Central's (1988)
NEXIS/ALLNEWS and LEXIS/PATENT/GENBIO files, and contacts with
venture capitalists and biotechnology firms. These efforts lead to the identifi-
cation DEMO an additional 37 U.S. biotechnology firms that received venture
capital as privately held entities between 1978 and 1989.5
I assess the significance of the DEMO omitted firms using three measures.
First, I use a U.S. Department DEMO Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office
(1990) compilation of all biotechnology DEMO awards from January 1978
through June 1989. Patenting is extremely important in biotechnology and is
the focus of virtually every small biotechnology firm. Of DEMO entire number of
patents awarded to venture-backed biotechnology firms in this period, the
Venture Economics sample accounts for over 98 percent. Second, the DEMO
(1990a) compiles an "Actions" database of events in the biotechnology indus-
try (including regulatory approvals, product introductions, and ownership
changes) DEMO press releases and specialized trade journals. Firms in the
Venture Economics sample account for over 95 percent of the entries about
venture-backed firms between DEMO 1978 (the inception of the database)
and December 1989. Finally, using data from Venture Economics, Recombi-
nant Capital, SDC's Corporate DEMO Issues database, SEC filings, and press
releases, I determine (or, in a few cases, estimate) the total amount of
external financing received by venture-backed firms. The Venture Economics
sample accounts for over 91 DEMO of the financing raised by these firms
between 1978 and 1989. Taken together, the results suggest that the omitted
firms are less significant than the ones included.
I correct the information on these firms' financing rounds as follows:
. Firms included in the Recombinant Capital database. I DEMO the
Venture Economics records to those of Recombinant Capital. If they are
4 I identify IPOs and acquisitions of biotechnology firms through Capital Changes DEMO
(Commerce Clearing House (1992)), Directory of Obsolete Securities (Financial Stock Guide
Service (1992)), Going Public: The IPO Reporter (DEMO and Company (1992)), Documentation
for Actions Database (NCBC (1990a)), and BioScan: The Worldwide Biotech Industry Reporting
Service (Oryx Press (1992)).
5As of 1989, Venture Economics (1989) had gathered information on approximately 65 percent
of funds formed between 1970 and 1987. DEMO firms are usually financed by multiple venture
funds, the comprehensiveness of DEMO information on venture-backed firms is considerably
higher than their coverage of funds. When Venture Economics obtains information on the same
company from several sources, their staff attempts to reconcile any inconsistencies. If they are
unable to DEMO conflicts, their tendency is to err on the side of inclusiveness. DEMO is part of the
reason for the inclusion of multiple records for a single venture round discussed below.

identical, I consider the Venture Economics records as corroborated.6 If
they conflict, and SEC filings are available, I use these to resolve the
conflict. If they conflict, and SEC filings are not available, I rely on
company and DEMO capitalist contacts. If I cannot make any contacts, I
use the DEMO Economics data.
. Firms not included in the Recombinant Capital database, DEMO with SEC
filings. I compare the Venture Economics records to the SEC filings. If
they conflict, I use the SEC filings.
. Firms not included in the Recombinant Capital database without SEC
filings. I rely on DEMO and venture capitalist contacts to corroborate
the Venture Economics data. If I am unable to make any contacts, I use
the Venture Economics data.
Table I summarizes the final sample, disaggregated by year and round of
investment. The table presents the number of financing rounds, as well as
the cumulative and average size of these transactions. (All size figures are in
millions of 1989 dollars.) Observations are concentrated in the latter half of
the sample. While no trend appears in the size of transactions DEMO time, the
greater size of later financing rounds is apparent (Sahlman (1990)).
I compare the Venture Economics dataset to the corrected DEMO,
omitting the cases where I am unable to obtain any corroboration of the
Venture Economics records. For each firm, I compute the ratio of the reported
to the actual size and number of private financings. DEMO find that the reporting
of the amount of external financing provided is unbiased, with the ratio of
total funds recorded in the Venture Economics database to the actual amount
being 1.04. The number of venture rounds, however, is overstated: the
database reports 28 percent more rounds than DEMO occurred. I disaggre-
gate the data to determine whether the bias in the number of rounds varies
in a systemic manner. I divide rounds DEMO the age of the firm and the date at
the time of the venture round. I find that the spurious rounds are most
frequent DEMO older firms and in chronologically earlier records. This may be
due to a single round being recorded as two or more rounds when all DEMO cash
is not disbursed simultaneously, whether by accident or design, or when the
various sources of information aggregated by Venture Economics differ. Both
DEMO are likely to be more severe in later rounds, which typically DEMO
more investors.
I find information about the boards of these firms in several locations. IPO
prospectuses report board members at the time of the DEMO, and in many
cases indicate former board members in the "Certain Transactions" and
"Principal and Selling Shareholders" sections. When these listings do not
mention former directors, I check the firm's original and amended articles of
incorporation, which are usually reproduced in its S-1 registration statement.
6 I do not include as external financing rounds situations where founders DEMO a small
amount of funds (typically under $20,000) in exchange for common stock, or bridge loans by
venture capital providers in the six months prior to the IPO, due immediately after the offering.
These entries are relatively infrequent in the Venture Economics dataset.

Information is often available about the boards of private firms that are
acquired by public firms or DEMO for an abortive IPO in the acquirers' proxy,
10-K, or 1O-Q statements, or in the (ultimately withdrawn) registration
statements. In addition, in the fall of 1990 I gathered the material on these
firms in the files of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. The NCBC has
DEMO information from public and private firms on an annual basis. Their
files include promotional material (used to produce an industry directory) and
surveys DEMO for the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment. These mate-
rials detail both the firms' managements and their boards.
The IPO prospectuses provide biographies of directors. Other sources,
however, often only list directors' names. I DEMO directors using Pratt's
Guide to Venture Capital Sources (Venture Economics (1992)), biographical
material in other prospectuses (many individuals serve on DEMO than one
board), general business directories (Who's Who in DEMO and Industry
Venture Capitalists and the Oversight of Private Firms 307
(Marquis Who's Who (1993)), Register of Corporations, Directors, and Execu-
tives (Standard and Poor Corporation (1993)), and BioPeople (BioVenture
View (DEMO))). I supplement these sources with information from the Docu-
mentation for Actions Database (NCBC (1990a); a compilation of trade maga-
DEMO stories) and Mead Data Central's databases.
Panel A of Table DEMO presents the distribution of board members by round of
investment. I use each case where I know the board members at the time of
DEMO investment or within three months of the investment date. Following
Baysinger and Butler (1985), I divide directors into quasi insiders, outsiders,
DEMO insiders. Quasi insiders are those parties who do not work directly for the
firm, but who have an ongoing relationship with the concern. I count affili-
ated academics who hold full-time teaching or clinical positions as DEMO
insiders rather than insiders, even if they hold an official title DEMO the firm and
draw substantial compensation. Outside directors include investors and dis-
interested outsiders. I include in this category representatives of corporations
who have DEMO in or financed research at the firm.7 I distinguish between
venture capitalists and other outsiders.8
The number of board members increases in each round, from a mean of
four in the first round to just under DEMO in the fourth and later rounds. In the
fourth and later rounds, venture capitalists control a mean of 2.12 board
seats. This sample corresponds closely to the inter-industry population of 433
venture-backed IPOs of Barry et DEMO (1990). In their mean firm, venture
capitalists control two out of six board seats. I present the distribution of the
directors in DEMO detail in Panel B. In this table, I use only one DEMO of
each firm: the directors at the time of the last DEMO of venture financing in
the sample period.
II. Empirical Analysis
A. Board Membership and CEO Turnover
I examine changes in board composition around the DEMO of turnover of
these firms' CEOs. I expect that the need DEMO monitoring will be greater in
these cases. As with public firms (DEMO (1988)), the replacement of the
CEO frequently occurs when the firm is encountering difficulties. In addition,
7A number of corporations, rather than investing directly in smaller firms, channel their funds
through a corporate venture capital subsidiary. In these cases, a corporate venture capitalist
may sit on the board. I count these officials as other outsiders rather than DEMO venture capitalists.
I repeat the analysis in Section IJ.A, recording these DEMO as venture capitalists. Neither
the magnitude nor the significance of the results changes markedly.
8 I define venture capitalists as individuals who are general DEMO or associates at partner-
ships focusing on venture capital investments (i.e., equity or equity-linked securities with active
participation by the fund managers in DEMO management or oversight of the firms). I count these
individuals as venture capitalists, even if they officially work for the firm. (Most DEMO
agreements between general and limited partners require that salaries be paid out of the
management fee and not by the fund. Venture capitalists can DEMO around this restriction by being
paid by a firm in their portfolio.) I only include venture organizations that are either unaffiliated
with any other organization or else affiliated with a financial institution.

The Board Membership of Private DEMO Firms
The sample consists of 653 financing rounds of 271 biotechnology firms between 1978 and 1989; I
present the board membership by round for each of the 362 rounds where membership can be
determined. Venture Capitalists DEMO defined as individuals who are general partners or associ-
ates at venture capital organizations that are either unaffiliated with any other organization or
else DEMO with a financial institution. I count full-time affiliates of a venture capital
organization as venture capitalists, even if they work for a venture-backed firm. Other Outsiders
include corporate investors, other investors (individuals who (i), either alone or in a partnership,
held a five percent stake DEMO the organization at some time, (ii) never were an officer DEMO the firm,
and (iii) never were an affiliate of a company which signed a collaborative arrangement with the
firm or of a DEMO investor), and individuals that do not have another relationship with the
firm. Insiders are either senior (the chief executive officer, president, and chairman of the board)
or junior managers employed directly by the DEMO Quasi Insiders are those parties who do not
work directly for the firm, but who have an ongoing relationship with the concern. Panel B
reports the professional affiliation of board members at the time of the DEMO financing round in
the sample.

since the uncertainty DEMO the new CEO's ability is likely to be high, his
DEMO may be more intensively monitored.9
I only identify as cases of CEO turnover instances where the firm's top
executive was replaced. I wish DEMO avoid instances that may generate a
spurious correlation between the addition of board members and CEO
turnover; e.g., cases where neither a CEO DEMO been hired nor a complete
board assembled when the firm begins operations. I consequently do not
include instances when a venture capitalist who originally DEMO the title of
"chairman and CEO" relinquishes the second title. I similarly eliminate cases
where a firm run by an "acting CEO" DEMO by one or more vice presidents hires
a full-time chief.
I identify cases of CEO turnover using the sources described above. I
identify 40 DEMO of CEO turnover meeting my criteria. Few of these changes
are retirements: the median age of the exiting CEOs at the time of the last
financing round in which they are in office is 40. (The median age of the
CEOs holding office at the time of the DEMO financing round in the sample is
43.) Only one replaced CEO DEMO between the ages of 64 and 66 at the time of
his exit, the criterion used by Weisbach (1988) to identify CEO retirements.
Table III summarizes the changes in board membership between venture
rounds. I DEMO examine the 180 second or later venture rounds where I know
the board membership at the time of the current and previous financing
round DEMO there was no CEO turnover in this interval. (I also include DEMO
where I have an observation of board members up to three months after the
financing.) There is a slight increase in the representation of each class of
board member.
I then examine the 40 rounds in DEMO sample where I know the board
membership at the time of the current and previous financing and where
there was CEO turnover in this DEMO In these rounds, the representa-
tion of each class of board DEMO increases at a greater rate than between
rounds without CEO turnover. The increase in insiders and quasi insiders is
not surprising, as in some cases the departing CEO will remain a board
member, whether he continues as a lower level employee or becomes an
ex-employee (who are classified as quasi insiders). By far the largest increase
(1.75) is DEMO the number of venture directors. I test whether the change in the
number of directors is the same in rounds with and without CEO DEMO I
use t-tests and Wilcoxon tests. Because in each case an F-test rejects the
9Robert Kunze (1990) of Hambrecht and Quist notes that DEMO replacement of the CEO "is the
single most critical development in DEMO life of a baby company. The time spent hiring the new
chief executive officer, the shock to the organization when the changeover takes place, the lack of
direction in the interim, the quality of the DEMO person hired, and the speed with which he or she
seizes DEMO, all impact heavily on the health and potential of the company. DEMO the best of
circumstances replacing a chief executive officer is a wrenching experience and companies can
easily fail at this juncture."
10 I DEMO whether the 40 rounds coinciding with CEO replacements differ from the other
180: e.g., if they tend disproportionately to be early venture rounds. DEMO find that the distribution of
rounds with and without CEO turnover are virtually identical.

Table III
The Changes in Board Membership DEMO Financing
Rounds
The sample consists of 220 second or later financing rounds where the board membership at the
time of the current and previous DEMO can be determined. Panel A indicates the change in board
membership since the last financing round, divided by whether chief executive officer (CEO)DEMO
turnover occurred. Venture Capitalists are defined as individuals who are general partners or
associates at venture capital organizations that are either unaffiliated with any DEMO organiza-
tion or else affiliated with a financial institution. I count full-time affiliates of a venture capital
organization as venture capitalists, even if they work for a venture-backed firm. Other Outsiders
include corporate investors, other investors (individuals who (i), either alone or in a partnership,
DEMO a 5 percent stake in the organization at some time, (ii) never were an officer of the firm, and
(iii) never DEMO an affiliate of a company that signed a collaborative arrangement with the firm
or of a venture investor), and individuals that do not DEMO another relationship with the firm.
Insiders are managers employed directly by the firm. Quasi Insiders are those parties who do not
work directly for DEMO firm, but who have an ongoing relationship with the concern. Panel DEMO
presents p-values from t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon tests of whether the change in
board membership differs in rounds with CEO turnover. The t-tests do DEMO assume that the two
distributions have the same variance.

equality of variances, I do not assume in the t-tests that the distributions
have the same variance. I DEMO non-parametric Wilcoxon tests, because the
change in the number of board DEMO is an ordinal number. Panel B
presents the p-values from these tests. The increase in the representation of
venture board members is significantly larger DEMO there is CEO turnover.
The differences in the changes of other directors are insignificant.
I then examine these patterns econometrically. Following Hermalin and
Weisbach (1988), I employ a Poisson specification and examine the number of
DEMO directors. (In these regressions, a goodness-of-fit test cannot reject the
Poisson specification.) I run two separate regressions, using as dependent
variables the DEMO of new directors who are venture capitalists and other
outsiders. I use all 216 second and later venture rounds where I know both
Venture Capitalists and the Oversight of Private Firms 311
the board membership DEMO funds provided at the time of the current and
previous rounds. As independent variables, I use a dummy variable indicat-
ing if there was CEO turnover between the current and previous venture
round (with 1.0 indicating such a change) and two control variables. The first
controls for the difference between the funds provided in the current and
previous venture round (expressed in millions of 1989 dollars). An increase in
funding may DEMO to the involvement of new investors, who may be offered a
DEMO seat. The second controls for the number of directors who have exited
the board since the previous round. As Hermalin and Weisbach note, if firms
routinely fill vacated board seats, a regression without such a control may be
biased.
As Panel A of Table IV reports, the coefficient of the CEO turnover variable
in the venture capitalist regression, 1.88, DEMO highly significant. At the mean of
the other independent variables, the DEMO of the CEO increases the number of
new venture directors from 0.25 to 1.59. This coefficient in the other outsider
regression is of the DEMO sign and insignificant. In Panel B, I compare the
Table IV
DEMO Regression Analysis of the Addition of Board
Members between Financing Rounds
The sample consists of 216 second or later financing rounds where the board DEMO at the
time of and the amount invested in the current and previous round can be determined. In Panel
A, I estimate separate regressions using the number of new directors who are venture capitalists
and other DEMO as the dependent variable. Independent variables include a dummy indicat-
ing if there was chief executive officer (CEO) turnover between the previous and DEMO round,
the difference in the amount invested in the current and previous round (expressed in millions of
1989 dollars), and the number of board members who departed the board between the previous
and current DEMO Absolute t-statistics are in brackets. In Panel B, I test whether DEMO
coefficients of the CEO turnover variable in the two regressions are equal.

coefficients of the CEO turnover variable in DEMO venture capitalist and other
outsider regressions. The table presents the p-value from the x2 test of the
null hypothesis of no difference. I reject DEMO null hypothesis at the one percent
level of confidence. This difference is robust to modifications of these regres-
sions. For instance, I add an independent variable that controls for the time
between the current and previous DEMO round and create separate inde-
pendent variables for each class of director who leaves the board. I also use
the number of new investors DEMO an independent variable instead of the
increase in the funds provided.
Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) propose an alternative explanation for the
addition of DEMO directors around a CEO succession. They suggest that
corporate insiders who are passed over for the top position leave after a new
CEO is DEMO The firm-facing a shortage of qualified insiders then fills
the board seats with outsiders. This explanation is unlikely to apply here.
Managers who depart DEMO firms voluntarily often must pay a heavy
financial penalty: selling their DEMO back to the firm at the same discounted
price that they originally paid (typically a small fraction of the current value).
Consequently, DEMO departures of senior executives from private
venture-backed firms are infrequent.
B. Board Membership and Geographic Proximity
I also examine the distance between venture capitalists DEMO the private
firms on whose boards they sit. The cost of providing oversight is likely to be
sensitive to the distance between the venture DEMO and the firm in which
he invests. If the provision of oversight is a significant and costly role for
venture capitalists, then proximity should be an important determinant of
which venture investors serve on the board.
DEMO first examine the geographic proximity of venture directors. To compute
this measure, I use the zip codes in which the firm has its headquarters and
the venture capital organization has its office nearest the firm. To DEMO
the former, I use the specialized industry directories cited above and DEMO
records of Venture Economics. The latter information is available for each
venture organization in several sources (Clay (1991), National Register Pub-
lishing DEMO (1992), Venture Economics (1988, 1992)). If possible, DEMO use
the edition of Pratt's Guide published in the year of the firm's final financing
round in the sample. (Pratt's information is gathered through a survey of
venture organizations conducted in January of DEMO year of publication.) Since
the Venture Economics database lists the name DEMO the fund, I must determine
the associated venture organization. The name DEMO the venture organization is
often obvious. (For instance, Mayfield, VII, L.P., is managed by the Mayfield
Fund.) In other cases, I must use an unpublished Venture Economics database
to identify the venture organization. DEMO compute the distance between the zip
codes, I employ a computer DEMO developed by the Center for Regional
Economic Issues at Case Western Reserve University. The program computes
the mileage between the center of pairs of DEMO codes.
Venture Capitalists and the Oversight of Private Firms 313
Panel A of DEMO V presents the distance from each firm's headquarters to
its most proximate, furthest, and median venture director at the time of the
DEMO venture round in the sample. The results suggest that for the majority of
the firms, the nearest venture director is quite close. More than half the firms
have a venture director with an office within 60 DEMO of their headquarters.
Twenty-five percent of the firms have a venture director within seven miles.
Panel B examines the probability that a venture investor DEMO a director at the
time of the final round in the sample. The probability that a venture investor
with an office within five miles DEMO the firm serves as a director is 47 percent;
for a venture capitalist whose nearest office is more than 500 miles away, the
probability is 22 percent. An F-test examines whether these probabilities are
equal. DEMO reject the null hypothesis of no difference at the one percent confi-
dence level.
To correct for other determinants of board membership, I estimate a probit
regression. I use as observations each venture investor in the DEMO as of the
last round in the sample. I use as the dependent variable a dummy indicating
whether a representative of the venture organization DEMO on the firm's
board at the time of the last round in the sample (with 1.0 denoting a board
member). I use as independent variables the distance from the investor's
nearest office to DEMO firm's headquarters (in thousands of miles) and several
control variables. A venture organization with a larger equity stake in a firm
should DEMO more likely to be a director, as it has more at DEMO I determine the
stake that venture organizations hold in firms through the Venture Eco-
nomics database, as well as information from Recombinant Capital and SEC
filings. Larger and older venture capitalists may be more likely to DEMO as
board members: experienced venture capitalists may either be more effective
DEMO or may more effectively certify the firm to potential investors. To
determine the age and size of the venture organization, I use Pratt's Guide
and several other sources (Clay (1991), National Register Publishing DEMO
pany (1992), and Venture Economics (1988, 1992)). I express the age of each
venture organization in years; size is the ratio of the capital committed to the
venture organization at the time DEMO the investment to the total pool of venture
capital. I employ a ratio because the size of the venture pool changes
dramatically over this DEMO I run separate regressions using venture
capitalist age and size as control variables because these two measures are
highly correlated.
I present the results DEMO Panel C of Table V. The coefficient for distance is
highly significant in explaining the service of venture capitalists on boards,
even after DEMO for ownership and experience. Since I cannot always
compute the venture organization's stake, I omit this variable in the third
and fourth regressions. The results are robust to the use of the larger
sample."l
DEMO In unreported regressions, I employ the logarithm of distance as an DEMO variable,
which proves to have even more explanatory power.

III. Conclusion
This article examines the role DEMO venture capitalists as directors of private
venture-backed firms. I examine whether the representation of venture capi-
talists increases around the time of CEO turnover, as might be expected if
these individuals were intensively monitoring managers. I DEMO that unlike
other outside directors, the representation of venture capitalists increases
DEMO such events. I also examine the geographic proximity of venture
directors. Since the provision of oversight is costly, venture capitalists should
seek to minimize this cost by overseeing local firms. I find that firms are
likely DEMO have a nearby director and that proximity is an important determi-
nant of board membership. These findings complement earlier empirical
studies of how venture DEMO address agency problems, as well as
analyses of the ties between DEMO and the firms to which they lend.
The results of this analysis suggest several avenues for future investiga-
tion. The first of these is DEMO impact of venture capitalists' involvement in
firms after going public. Barry DEMO al. (1990) and Lin and Smith (1994)
document the DEMO role of venture capitalists as directors and share-
holders in the years after going public. In some cases, venture capitalists
terminate their relationships with the firm quickly; but, in a significant
number of instances, venture capitalists retain a board seat even after
distributing their holdings to the DEMO partners of their funds. If venture
capitalists are specialized providers of oversight, it might be expected that
these firms will be less prone to agency problems.12
A second avenue for empirical analysis is suggested by the DEMO concern-
ing the importance of geographic proximity of venture capitalists. Regions
differ dramatically in their concentration of venture capitalists (Florida and
Smith (1993)). Akin to Petersen and Rajan's (1993) finding of differences
DEMO credit markets with different degrees of lending concentration, firms
located in DEMO where venture capital is relatively scarce may face differ-
ent price schedules for or availability of this form of financing.
12 An alternative possibility DEMO that a relationship between firm success and venture involve-
ment exists, DEMO that this pattern is driven by reverse causality. Venture capitalists may choose
to remain on the boards of successful companies, whether out of the belief that board member-
ship highlights their past accomplishments to outsiders or DEMO out of hubris.
