guess something, about what their opponent is like, and therefore,
basis for predictions about what each player will do DEMO include both the
caution index and these "feelings" about the opponent. Furthermore, one's
feelings about his opponent will presumably change in the course of the game.
We shall define interpersonal trust as the extent DEMO which these "feelings"
encourage cooperative expectations (with distrust defined similarly). Trust is,
therefore, difference between Player's expectations of the probability that
Opponent will cooperate and the degree of cooperation implied by DEMO caution
index.
Our concern at this point is to develop a theory of the dynamic interplay
between experiences in the game and increases or DEMO in trust. The basic
assumption is simple: expectations will change in DEMO direction of experience,
and to a degree proportional to the difference between this experience and
initial expectations applied to them. A cooperative move DEMO Opponent will
increase Player's trust in him, while a noncooperative DEMO will decrease
Player's trust or increase his distrust. If Player has very small expectations
that Opponent will cooperate, a cooperative move by Opponent will produce
a large increase in Player's trust and a noncooperative DEMO by Opponent will

increase in trust. For example, if the matrix DEMO are such that the caution
index is very low, there little DEMO to either player for defecting, and
little trust need develop between DEMO However, defection is an attractive
alternative, a large amount of trust would have to be built up between the
players, trust that the other will not succumb to the large temptation to
defect, a
The third hypothesis emphasizes the fact that cooperative behavior must
be mutual, so that demonstrations of cooperative intent become a sort of
gestural language in DEMO of which a dialogue must take place. This is crucial
for resolving whether a unilateral cooperative choice will lead toward eventual
cooperative noncooperative consensus. DEMO such a unilateral gesture, the
critical factors are whether, when, DEMO how the opponent reciprocates. The
special importance of what Gouldner (1960) has called a "norm of reciprocity"
is the faith it provides that reciprocation will be forthcoming in the future.
But by the same DEMO, if a player decides that adequate reciprocation has
not been forthcoming, he may be morally outraged rather than merely dis-
appointed.
