Attitudes of venture capital investors towards
entrepreneurs with previous business failure
JASON COPE, FRANK CAVE and SUE ECCLES
(Final version accepted 13 DEMO 2004)
Business failure represents a signiﬁcant outcome of entrepreneurial activity and yet remains
an underdeveloped area of research. This article focuses on the DEMO of venture capitalist
(VC) investors towards entrepreneurs with a previous failure experience. It illustrates that
VCs recognize the complex, contextual nature of failure and do not necessarily perceive the
entrepreneur to be the primary cause DEMO the venture’s demise. Consequently, the article
differentiates between ‘business’, ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘venture capitalist’ failure. The
article demonstrates that VCs often adopt a tolerant, ﬂexible and open-minded attitude to
failure and are keen to understand the DEMO in which it occurred. The majority of
the VCs in the study emphasize that their decision to invest in an entrepreneur is not
negatively DEMO to any signiﬁcant degree by a previous experience of failure. A number of
inﬂuential factors are presented, such as a high quality concept, DEMO can offset this aspect
of the entrepreneur’s track record. The article concludes that business failure is not
automatically considered a ‘black mark’ by VCs. DEMO is important for entrepreneurs involved
in business failure to be aware of these positive and sympathetic attitudes when considering
putting forward new proposals to DEMO VC community.

Introduction
DEMO is impossible to talk intelligently about a theory of entrepreneur-
ship without acknowledging the pivotal role of failure. (Cardon and
McGrath 1999: 2)DEMO
Within the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship, there is a tendency for many DEMO
and practitioners to focus on identifying successful entrepreneurs and
‘picking winners’ (DEMO 1996). Conversely, venture failure is often
viewed negatively, even though it remains a dominant feature of the
entrepreneurial landscape (Cardon and McGrath 1999). As McGrath
(1999) argues, ‘although failure in entrepreneurship is pervasive, theory
often reﬂects an equally pervasive antifailure bias’ (1999: 13). Conse-
quently, there is a resounding recognition that a clear understanding of
entrepreneurial failure remains elusive (McGrath 1999, Zacharakis et al.

1999). As Scott and Lewis assert, what is needed is ‘clearer thinking about
what ‘failure’ really means and DEMO awareness that more than one perspective
is involved: what one sees DEMO depends on where one is standing’ (1984:
53).
This DEMO responds to these important issues and represents part of a
wider, DEMO programme of research currently engaged in exploring
the perceptions, impact and DEMO outcomes of failure from a number of
different stakeholder perspectives, both DEMO the UK and the USA. This
article focuses on the perceptions and impact of failure from the perspective
of the venture capitalist (VC) DEMO works on the premise that ‘the study of
entrepreneurial failure is important and valuable in assisting entrepreneurs
and VCs in overcoming the problems that DEMO ventures face’ (Zacharakis et
al. 1999: 12). Prior research on failure from a VC perspective has tended to
focus on the perceived DEMO of investment failure (Ruhnka et al. 1992). In
contrast, this article explores the attitudes of VC investors towards
entrepreneurs who have a DEMO experience in their previous track record.
The primary aim of the study reported here was to understand, from a VC
perspective, the impact DEMO a failure experience may have on the
entrepreneur’s ability to receive future VC support. At a ﬁrm-speciﬁc
level, the research also sought to comprehend how signiﬁcant a failure
experience was in terms of the investment evaluation DEMO used by VCs.
In keeping with the overall research programme, the DEMO was also
comparative, juxtaposing the attitudes of VC investors in the DEMO and the
USA.
Based on qualitative, phenomenological research, this article presents the
views and experiences of six VCs with regard to failure, three of whom are
US-based and three UK-based. In addressing the call for DEMO more ‘micro-
level’ perspective of new venture failure (Shepherd et al. DEMO), the in-
depth ﬁndings from this research contribute to current theorizing on failure
in two ways. First, in terms of deﬁning failure the research ﬁndings
emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the concepts of
‘business/DEMO failure and ‘entrepreneurial’ failure. The article also
indicates the occurrence of ‘venture capitalist’ failure, illustrating that VCs
can fail in terms of both their investment decisions and the subsequent
management of those investments. Second, the article presents a number of
signiﬁcant issues that shape the VC’s decision to DEMO in an entrepreneur,
many of which can prove more inﬂuential than a failure experience in the
entrepreneur’s previous track record. The article also DEMO some
observations from the participants regarding general preconceived attitudes
towards failure in the UK as opposed to the USA.
Deﬁnitions of ‘failure’
The concept DEMO failure is hard to deﬁne, primarily because there are
numerous deﬁnitions DEMO business failure (Fredland and Morris 1976, Scott
and Lewis 1984), which involve subjective and idiosyncratic judgements as
to what constitutes ‘failure’ (McGrath 1999). As Cochran states, the
‘myriad of studies of business mortality, with their various conceptions of

VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE 149
failure and different purposes and research designs, speak to the subject
with a babble of tongues’ (1981: 59)DEMO It is important, therefore, to be clear
about the deﬁnition(s) used when inquiring into this subject (Watson and
Everett 1993). DEMO need for clarity is reinforced by Scott and Lewis, when
they DEMO that the ‘root cause of our difﬁculties, we would argue, is
careless use of the word ‘failure’ and its several synonyms—death,
discontinuance, insolvency, bankruptcy. Failure is a composite term, and
we need to DEMO aware of its component parts, the balance of which
continually changes’ (1984: 30).
The deﬁnitions of failure proposed by Ulmer and Neilson (1947) and
Cochran (1981) provide useful, albeit rather broad descriptions of failure.
As Ulmer and Neilson state, ‘ﬁrms which were liquidated or sold to avoid
loss, in the broad economic sense, may be DEMO as ‘‘failures’’’ (1947: 11).
Cochran (1981) also puts forward a deﬁnition that incorporates the
importance of loss, which is described by Watson and Everett (1993) as
particularly relevant to small business owners, advisors and policy makers.
. . .limiting failure to bankruptcy, or even to going out of business
with losses to creditors, seems to exclude too much. Intuitively,
failure should mean inability to ‘make a go DEMO it’, whether losses
entail one’s own capital, or someone else’s, DEMO indeed, any capital.
(Cochran 1981: 52)
In deﬁning business DEMO, Shepherd et al. (2000) propose the concept of
‘mortality risk’, which is deﬁned as ‘the probability that a ﬁrm will become
insolvent DEMO be unable to recover from that insolvency before being
bankrupt and ceasing operations’ (2000: 396). They emphasize that such an
approach to DEMO is based on the life of the organization rather than the
life of the management team. Shepherd et al. (2000) go on to DEMO that
viewing business mortality as the departure of a venture from the market
for reasons of insolvency offers a more narrow deﬁnition of mortality DEMO
the notion of discontinuance, which may also refer to a change DEMO ownership
or closure of the business. As they state, a ‘business DEMO change ownership
as a result of its success, not as a DEMO of poor performance’ (Shepherd et
al. 2000: 396).
Ruhnka et al. (1992) provide an interesting insight into the phenomenon
of failure DEMO introducing the concept of a ‘living dead investment’, which is
speciﬁc DEMO the context of VC-backed investing and ‘represents a failure of
investor expectations as distinct from an economic failure of the venture’
(1992: 137)DEMO Thus, it is important to differentiate between ‘failure’, which
implies some form of loss or other outcome that does not meet initial
expectations, and the broader concept of ‘discontinuance’, which may not
have the same level of impact in emotional, behavioural and economic
terms and may not, in some cases, even be viewed as a failure.
Discontinuance for DEMO reason obviously is too broad a deﬁnition of
failure. Casting the net that widely ensnares many businesses that
cannot be construed to have failed. DEMO example, businesses may be
discontinued because of extraneous factors such as DEMO or

illness, because alternative opportunities presented themselves, DEMO,
under some deﬁnitions of discontinuance, even because the business
is DEMO at a proﬁt. (Cochran 1981: 52)
The work by Macmillan et al. (1987) on the VC screening process is
signiﬁcant as DEMO introduces different types of failure and demonstrates the
prevalence of entrepreneurial failure, in the sense that the large majority of
failures (81%) identiﬁed by the VCs in their sample reﬂected speciﬁc ﬂaws
or failings in DEMO venture team. Surprisingly, almost 50% of the failures
identiﬁed were classiﬁed DEMO Macmillan et al. (1987) as ‘hapless amateurs’,
where the venture team were lacking in all desirable criteria. ‘They are not
capable of DEMO effort, they are not articulate in discussing the venture,
they DEMO not familiar with the targeted market, and ﬁnally they have no
DEMO record’ (Macmillan et al. 1987: 129).
Finally, within the DEMO on VC assessment processes, there is an
implicit recognition of venture DEMO failure, in the sense that VCs can
fail to make effective DEMO decisions. For example, Zacharakis and
Meyer assert that ‘if a venture DEMO consideration has the same lead
entrepreneur as a past successful investment, DEMO available information
may bias the VC to overlook other factors that suggest the current venture
may fail’ (1998: 60). It is also DEMO that VCs commonly fail to choose
appropriate entrepreneurs and venture teams. As Smart (1999) states, all
too often VCs make human capital mistakes and ‘pick the wrong people’,
thereby allocating scarce funding to new DEMO that fail. Similarly,
Macmillan et al. (1987) express their surprise that so many ‘hapless
amateurs’ manage to slip through the VC screening DEMO and actually
receive funding.
The importance of ‘people’ in the VC investment decision
process
Decision making is central to the study of VCs. Understanding DEMO
VCs and other parties involved in new venture funding make
decisions should further illuminate the entrepreneurial phenomena.
(Shepherd and Zacharakis 1999: 214)
DEMO assess the probability of success or failure of a new venture by
evaluating the information that surrounds it (Zacharakis and Meyer 1998).
Following the seminal work of Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) on VC
investment DEMO, there is a consensus that VC decision processes, both
in the UK and the USA, typically relate to the quality of the entrepreneur/
team, product/service attractiveness, market/competitive conditions and
ﬁnancial considerations (Sweeting 1991, Zacharakis and Meyer 1998,
Shepherd and Zacharakis 1999, DEMO 1999). However, commentators also
emphasize the heterogeneity of VC practices (Tyebjee and Bruno 1984,
Sandberg et al. 1988) and the unscientiﬁc, subjective nature of the VC
decision-making process (Sweeting 1991). It DEMO observed that ‘gut feel’

plays a major role in determining which DEMO to back (Macmillan et al.
1987). As Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) highlight, ‘VCs often discuss the
‘‘chemistry’’ between themselves and the DEMO The deal often falls
through if the chemistry is not right. Such intuitive, or ‘‘gut feel’’ decision-
making is difﬁcult to quantify or objectively analyse’ (1998: 63).
Despite this inherent subjectivity, numerous theorists emphasize that the
quality of the entrepreneur/management team is of paramount importance
DEMO the VC’s decision to invest (Goslin and Barge 1986, Roberts 1991,
Sapienza 1992, Shepherd et al. 2000). As Smart (1999) points out, VCs
realize that they are often ‘betting on people’ when they make their
investments. ‘The primary criteria used by venture capitalists in DEMO
new venture proposals are managerial capabilities and other factors related
to competence’ (Shepherd et al. 2000: 398). Shepherd et al. (2000) DEMO on to
point out that the reliance by VCs on venture team capabilities is a response
to the uncertainty facing new ventures, and that VCs reduce their risk by
investing in entrepreneurs that they trust and DEMO can cope with this
uncertainty. More speciﬁcally, Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) state that
when VCs are uncertain about the intended market then the entrepreneur
becomes a critical factor in their decision.
In identifying entrepreneurial qualities DEMO VCs seek in their investees,
the synthesis of the VC decision-making literature provided by Shepherd
and Zacharakis (1999) illustrates issues such as DEMO management skill,
quality of management, characteristics of the management team DEMO
previous track record as signiﬁcant. Other important factors include prior
industry experience (Shepherd et al. 2000), management and marketing
experience (Goslin and DEMO 1986), and the importance of a balanced team
with a technical and business orientation (Roberts 1991). Though it would
appear that VCs assess the ‘management’ of a proposed venture, it is
important to recognize that ‘VCs may ﬁxate on the lead entrepreneur
because of that individual’s DEMO record of success and because of that
person’s dynamic personality’ (Zacharakis DEMO Meyer 1998: 60).
The conclusions of Zacharakis and Meyer’s (1998) work provide a
noteworthy counterpoint to this discussion, illustrating that the DEMO
trepreneur factor’ does not appear to be as critical as theorists suppose.
They argue that market characteristics may be a better determinant of
which DEMO receive funding, stating that ‘more information seems to
shift the importance DEMO the entrepreneur to the market. . .if the VC is
conﬁdent in the market, the entrepreneur is not too important’ (1998: 73).
Macmillan et al. (1987) also illustrate that VCs view criteria that DEMO
market related, rather than product or entrepreneur related, to be more
important predictors of success. Sweeting (1991) reports similar ﬁndings
from a DEMO perspective, conﬁrming that VCs are willing to engage with
proposals where DEMO is a recognized management weakness if the
business concept is otherwise sound. Certain theorists argue, therefore,
that VCs are willing to accommodate gaps in the entrepreneur’s
characteristics and skills (Goslin and Barge 1986), as long as the
entrepreneur is willing to ﬁll them when needed (Rea 1989) or the VC
is allowed to install their own nominee for CEO or other management
role if necessary (Douglas and Shepherd 2002).

The attitudes of VCs to failure
Thus, ‘failure’ is at the very least endemic to the venture capital
process, an expected, commonplace event; in some cases the process
itself may DEMO promote failure. (Gorman and Sahlman 1989: 238)
It is clear that venture failure is a signiﬁcant outcome of VC investment
activity. Several DEMO have demonstrated that over 40% of VC
investments fail to provide satisfactory returns, becoming either ‘living
dead’, ‘losers’ or ‘mega-losers’ (Ruhnka et al. 1992, Smart 1999). Although
the exact failure rate for new ventures is disputed, it is generally accepted
that starting a business is a high-risk activity (Shepherd et al. 2000). It is
also apparent, DEMO, that the survival rate is substantially lower for VC-
backed businesses (Zacharakis and Meyer 1998, Zacharakis et al. 1999).
In understanding the perceived causes of failure from a VC perspective,
it is recognized DEMO new venture failure results from a combination of
internal and external factors (Zacharakis et al. 1999). Gorman and Sahlman
(1989) identify a number of major reasons why the failure rate is so high.
First, certain consequential uncertainties that face proposed new ventures
can only be resolved DEMO moving forward. Second, the limited resources that
VC-backed businesses possess mean DEMO unexpected snags can be
extremely damaging. This is combined with the tendency for VCs to ‘dole
out ﬁnancing in discrete amounts closely matched to DEMO milestones,
enabling them to limit damage by refusing additional ﬁnancing if the
company appears unsuccessful in the early stages’ (Gorman and Sahlman
1989: 238). Third, failure may occur if the quality of the DEMO or
the product is not up to the demands of the marketplace, or there are delays
in product development due to ineffective functional management. The
fourth major cause of failure centres on market problems, particularly
where the end user market does not develop as expected. Such competitive
and DEMO market conditions that create many failures and ‘living dead’
investments are seen to be largely beyond the control of the VC to remedy
(Ruhnka et al. 1992).
The work of Zacharakis et al. (1999) DEMO an interesting dimension to
this subject, as their work disputes some DEMO perceptions regarding
entrepreneurs’ and VCs’ attributions of failure. For example, the
DEMO in their sample attributed failure primarily to internal causes
rather than commonly hypothesized external factors: ‘The candour of the
entrepreneurs illustrates their willingness to see personal mistakes as
contributing to failure’ (Zacharakis et al. 1999: DEMO). A particularly surprising
and revealing aspect of their work was the attitudes of VCs to failure at a
general level as opposed to DEMO ﬁrm-speciﬁc level. In terms of new venture
failure in general, the DEMO in the sample overwhelmingly attributed failure
to internal causes: ‘The major DEMO of failure is probably management and
its inability to recognize the marketplace and accurately assess market size
and accessibility’ (VC quoted in Zacharakis et al. 1999: 9). In contrast, at a
ﬁrm-speciﬁc level where DEMO VC understood the venture and was personally
involved in its demise, DEMO was attributed primarily to external causes

VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE
153
such as the level of competition and DEMO market dynamics. It was only
when the VC was detached from the venture that internal problems were
blamed for the failure, leading Zacharakis et al. to conclude that ‘VCs tend
to attribute failure to internal causes DEMO as management capability as long
as they are professionally distanced’ (1999: 11 – 12).
Despite Zacharakis et al.’s (1999) ﬁndings, numerous studies illustrate
that VCs cite senior management ﬂaws and incompetence as the DEMO
cause of new venture failure (Macmillan et al. 1987, Gorman and Sahlman
1989, Ruhnka et al. 1992, Shepherd et al. 2000). DEMO this perspective,
business failure equates to entrepreneurial failure. Gorman and Sahlman
(1989) see this ﬁnding as unsurprising, as VCs often interact only with the
senior management team, and so in the eyes of the VC the entrepreneur is
the company. Any failure of the company is DEMO perceived by the VC
to be a personal failure of the entrepreneur.
Consequently, Macmillan et al. (1987) observe that no VC will back an
entrepreneur or venture team that has an uninspiring track record, such
ﬁrms will naturally fail to attract funding. Similarly, Rea (1989) illustrates
that failures in investment negotiations often revolve around the credibility
of the DEMO team. ‘A team perceived by venture capitalists as
marginal are a sure formula for failure, even when there are strong market
opportunities’ (1989: 157). This conclusion reﬂects a statement by George
Deriot, a proliﬁc character in the US VC industry, that ‘a grade-A man
with a grade-B idea is better than a grade-B man with a grade-A idea’ (as
cited in Sandberg, 1986). Such ﬁndings have major signiﬁcance in terms of
the present study and will be explored subsequently in relation DEMO the
research ﬁndings.
The research
This article is based on qualitative research with six VCs, which focused on
their attitudes and experiences with regard to entrepreneurs who have
experienced business failure.1 The study is part of DEMO wider, continuing
programme of comparative research between the UK and the DEMO (see
Cave et al. 2001), which aims to understand the DEMO, impact and
learning outcomes of failure from different stakeholder perspectives. The
DEMO research issue that shaped the present study was to understand if the
experience of business failure had any impact on an entrepreneur’s ability
to DEMO future investment from a VC. At a ﬁrm-speciﬁc level, the
research DEMO sought to comprehend how important a previous failure
experience can be in shaping the VC’s decision to invest in an entrepreneur
and their proposed DEMO The study also aimed to explore whether there
were any perceived differences in attitude towards failure between UK VCs
and their US counterparts.
The DEMO was concerned with exploring the personal attitudes of VCs
who have worked with entrepreneurs and businesses that have experienced
failure, rather than examining formal protocols and policies towards failure
at a VC ﬁrm level. To reiterate, it is commonly recognized that much VC
investment activity involves intuitive, ‘gut feel’ decision making and the

‘chemistry’ between the VC and the entrepreneur (Zacharakis and Meyer
1998). Research has also highlighted the importance of DEMO personal
relationship and trust that develops between a VC and an entrepreneur
(Fried and Hisrich 1995, Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001).
In exploring DEMO importance of failure in VC investment decisions, such a
‘micro-level’ research DEMO (Shepherd et al. 2000) was deemed useful as
VCs often rely on their personal judgment and experience in deciding
which entrepreneurs to invest DEMO As Sweeting states, this judgement base is
‘largely built around an DEMO experience of actually making deals
and living with those decisions’ (1991: 617). Furthermore, work by Roberts
(1991) demonstrates signiﬁcant differences between the practices of
individual VCs, described as ‘principal investment ofﬁcers’, and DEMO
espoused policies and preferences of the ﬁrms for which they work. Such
research ﬁndings strengthened the commitment of the authors to engage
with individual DEMO working at a ‘grass roots’ level, in order to examine
which DEMO may inﬂuence them to invest in an entrepreneur who has
experienced failure.
In-depth, unstructured ‘phenomenological interviewing’ (Thompson et
al. 1989) was the primary methodology used during the ﬁeldwork phase of
the research. Thompson et al. DEMO a detailed description of what they
term ‘phenomenological interviews’, which are DEMO as ‘the most
powerful means of attaining an in-depth understanding of another person’s
experiences’ (1989: 138). The goal of the phenomenological interview DEMO to
gain a ﬁrst-person description of some speciﬁed domain of experience,
where the course of the dialogue is largely set by the participant. DEMO
Thompson et al. (1989) state, with the exception of an DEMO question,
the phenomenological interviewer must have no a priori questions
regarding the topic. This form of interview, therefore, has strong
similarities to DEMO ‘depth interview’ (Jones 1985) and the ‘informal
conversational’ interview (Patton DEMO), where ‘questions emerge from
the immediate context and are asked in the course of things; there is no
predetermination of question topic or wordings’ (Patton 1990: 288).
Consequently, the only structure imposed on the interviews was an opening
question to begin the dialogue: ‘Can you tell me about your experience of
investing in entrepreneurs with a history DEMO business failure?’
In developing a phenomenological understanding of failure from a VC
perspective, the research was ‘naturalistic’ in its approach (Lincoln and
DEMO 1985). As Lincoln and Guba state, ‘when working within the
DEMO paradigm, however, the investigator typically does not work
with either a priori theory or variables; these are expected to emerge from
the inquiry. Data accumulated from the ﬁeld thus must be analysed
inductively’ (1985: DEMO). The objective of this research was to discover,
inductively, DEMO the perceptions and attitudes of VC investors are with
regard to venture failure, and then and only then to compare and
distinguish these emergent theories generated from the data with existing
literature. Such a qualitative approach DEMO seen as useful because it ‘allows
research to ﬂow in the less common direction, from data to theory’ (Chetty
1996: 77). Prior to engagement with the participants, no speciﬁc theoretical
constructs or hypotheses were used or generated, although some broad

VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE 155
research issues were developed in relation to DEMO existing literature on VC
investment and failure.
In choosing the participants for this study, the qualitative sampling
framework proposed by Patton (1990) was utilized, which is described as
‘purposeful’ sampling.
The logic and power of purposeful sampling lies in selecting
information-rich cases for study in depth. Information-rich DEMO are
those from which one can learn a great deal about issues of central
importance to the purpose of the research, thus the term purposeful
sampling. (1990: 169)
‘Snowball or chain sampling’ was also DEMO, which ‘identiﬁes cases of
interest from people who know people who DEMO people who know what
cases are information-rich, that is, good examples for study, good interview
subjects’ (Patton 1990: 182). Hence, DEMO majority of the sample was chosen
from personal networks within the Management School at Lancaster
University. As Hartley states, ‘using contacts in industry, DEMO and
friendship can be helpful, ﬁrst, in establishing what the population is of
organizations you might draw the case study from, and then how to choose
the case(s)’ (1994: 216). Whilst DEMO UK participants were geographically
spread throughout the UK, the US VCs DEMO all based in Silicon Valley,
California.
Each interview was transcribed and a detailed initial analysis of the
transcript performed, with detailed notes written in the margins indicating
potentially signiﬁcant issues. Once a detailed comprehension of DEMO
transcript had been achieved, the analysis of the data then moved DEMO
another crucial phase, described as cross-case comparison or ‘detective
work’ (Hartley 1994, Mintzberg 1983); where the role of the researcher is to
‘seek out both what is common and what is particular about the DEMO (Stake
1994: 238). In methodological terms, this phase was DEMO beginning of more
detailed ‘content analysis’ (Patton 1987, 1990).
Content analysis involves identifying coherent and important
examples, themes, and patterns in DEMO data. The analyst looks for
quotations or observations that go together, DEMO are examples of the
same underlying idea, issue, or concept. (DEMO 1987: 149)
Following this individually based stage of content analysis, the authors then
worked together as an ‘interpretive group’ (Thompson et al. 1989) to
develop a set of consistent themes that were apparent across the transcripts.
Thompson et al. (1989) articulate the beneﬁts of such DEMO dialogic process:
‘The perspective of the group is broader than that of any one individual
and, thus, a pattern that might not DEMO been noticed by a single researcher
may be ‘‘seen’’ by the group . . . The group, which is comprised of multiple
perspectives, DEMO a ‘‘fresh’’ vision and is less likely to approach the
transcript in a stereotyped fashion’ (1989: 141). Once an agreed set of DEMO
topics had been established, the group then compared and contrasted the
DEMO of each participant in relation to these overarching themes.

In writing up the emergent issues generated DEMO this interpretive
process and to maintain an inductive approach to theory development,
nascent theoretical propositions were written up from the data, without the
use of any relevant academic literature. In the ﬁrst instance, this allowed
the data to ‘speak for itself’. The next step in this process DEMO what
Eisenhardt (1989: 544) describes as ‘enfolding literature’, which enables the
development of theory with stronger credibility and deeper conceptual
insights:
DEMO essential part of theory building is comparison of emergent
concepts, theory, or hypotheses with the extant literature. This
involves asking what is this DEMO to, what does it contradict, and
why.
The outcome of this qualitative process of theory generation is presented
thematically in the following sections DEMO this article, illustrating some
emergent issues and insights into the attitudes DEMO VC investors in relation to
the phenomenon of business failure.
Deﬁning failure
An important message to emerge from the analysis of the participants’
experiences DEMO the need for greater clarity regarding the concept of failure
and a recognition of the difﬁculties associated with classifying an
unsuccessful business or entrepreneur DEMO a ‘failure’ within the context of
VC investing. James, a UK DEMO, is quite clear in his views of business
failure, as the following comment demonstrates.
The core, the narrowest deﬁnition, is receivership and DEMO
tion, given that in receivership and administration the shareholders
receive nothing, almost always. So that is clearly a failure.
James also feels that DEMO is still a ‘kind of failure’ when a business is sold but
the investors make a loss. This view of failure corresponds with the DEMO
of ‘living dead investments’, in which the venture fails to live DEMO to investor
expectations but does not necessarily represent a complete economic failure
(Ruhnka et al. 1992). In contrast, Mark (UK) questions DEMO such
businesses can be classiﬁed as a failure. In particular, he DEMO an
illustration of a CEO who managed to sell a business ‘that was suffering
a market change, the rules had changed’, and yet DEMO CEO managed to ‘turn
it around and get an exit’. As he states, ‘now is that a failure? Well the
investors wrote off DEMO of their money’. Certainly, the deﬁnition of failure
proposed by Cochran (1981) as the ‘inability to make a go of it’ with losses
to investors indicates that it is.
Mark’s perceptions raise an important issue DEMO terms of deﬁning failure,
as the example above highlights a distinction between ‘business’ failure and
‘entrepreneurial’ failure. It is apparent from these observations DEMO a
business that results in a signiﬁcant loss to investors may well be perceived

157
by VCs as highly unsuccessful or even DEMO failure, and yet Mark’s statement
indicates that the entrepreneur/CEO of DEMO a business may be judged to be
relatively successful by achieving the goal of ‘getting an exit’ in a time of
market turbulence. In DEMO terms, this could be described euphemisti-
cally as ‘making the best DEMO a bad job’. This research emphasizes, therefore,
that the terms DEMO failure and ‘entrepreneurial’ failure should not be
conﬂated, as not all DEMO who have been involved in failed
businesses may necessarily be viewed as personally responsible for the
failure and therefore perceived as ‘failed entrepreneurs’ by DEMO VC
community.
This relates to Scott and Lewis’ (1984) recognition that not all business
closures are lamented or regretted or even classiﬁed as DEMO failure, ‘and may
even rank as some kind of success, given the over-riding goals to be
accomplished’ (1984: 51). Simon (US) adds an interesting insight into the
concept of ‘entrepreneurial’ failure, in DEMO sense that failure is viewed as a
result of the personal mistakes and shortcomings of the entrepreneur. He
feels that there are two distinct DEMO of entrepreneur-related failure,
which he describes as ‘acceptable’ failures versus ‘ﬂamboyant/machismo’
failures. He describes ‘acceptable’ failures as people who are trying to DEMO
‘something great’ and build a successful company and unfortunately fail in
the process. As he states, ‘I have no problem with that kind of failure, in
fact I would argue that most times you have got a better. . .leader on your
hands’. In contrast, Simon describes ‘ﬂamboyant/machismo’ failures as
people out there ‘beating their chests’, who ‘never understand what it takes
and probably never will’; a kind of entrepreneurial failure that clearly
relates to the ‘hapless amateurs’ identiﬁed by Macmillan et al. (1987). In
conjunction with Zacharakis et al.’s (1999) ﬁndings, Simon’s attitude
regarding ‘acceptable’ failures indicates that an ‘isolated failure does not
necessarily DEMO a repudiation of the entrepreneur’s general ability’
(Zacharakis et al. 1999: 10). From a VC perspective, Simon’s comments
reiterate that not all entrepreneurs involved in failed ventures are viewed
negatively.
Investing in entrepreneurs with DEMO failure experience
One of the key issues that this research aimed to explore was the
perceptions and attitudes of VCs to the phenomenon of DEMO failure,
particularly with regard to investing in entrepreneurs who have experi-
enced failure. A number of issues emerge from a comparative analysis of
DEMO data, but what is interesting to observe is the generally positive DEMO
towards failure displayed by the majority of the participants. On the whole,
it appears that the decision to invest in an entrepreneur is DEMO negatively
affected to any signiﬁcant degree by a previous experience of failure and
that a number of factors shape the decision to invest, many of which can
prove more important than the recognition that the entrepreneur DEMO failed
in the past. Such ﬁndings concur with the conclusions of Sandberg et al.’s
(1988) work, which illustrates that although VCs frequently state that
‘entrepreneur’ or ‘management team’ factors account for most of their
Downloaded DEMO: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 13:24 2 September 2009
158 JASON COPE ET AL.
decision, ‘self reported criteria weights show many criteria involved and
none truly dominant’ (1988: 13).
The quality DEMO the concept/opportunity
A consistent theme throughout the data is that the quality of the concept or
opportunity that the entrepreneur presents to a DEMO has a strong impact on
the decision to invest. As Matthew (DEMO) states:
Our experience tells us that backing people with failures DEMO their
background is not a disaster, it is not something that DEMO should shy
away from. If the business is sound, technology is DEMO in our view,
we would pick someone who has been round the loop before, given
that they had a sensible . . . reason for the failure.
The willingness to invest in an entrepreneur with DEMO track record involving
failure is also expressed by Rebecca (US), DEMO the individual concerned
possesses great technical abilities and a great product. As she states, ‘with
entrepreneurs I think people are more inclined to bet on people who don’t
have proof one way or another about whether DEMO can be winners. . .I think
that they are more concerned about the quality of the idea than they are the
quality of the DEMO of the entrepreneur’. Similarly, Paul (UK)
states that he would not hold a failure against somebody and that investing
in an entrepreneur DEMO has experienced failure as opposed to a new starter
‘depends entirely on the concept’.
Such statements contradict the common perception in the VC literature
DEMO the entrepreneur is the most important factor in the VC’s decision-
making process, particularly Rea’s (1989) argument that entrepreneurs or
management teams perceived as potentially marginal are viewed as a sure
formula for failure despite DEMO market opportunities. Rather, this
research reinforces previous ﬁndings that if the DEMO is conﬁdent that the
concept will meet a market demand, the DEMO is not too important
(Zacharakis and Meyer 1998), and that DEMO are not necessarily over-
concerned with the total composition of the management team at the
screening stage (Sweeting 1991). As Sweeting states, DEMO VC fund felt that
‘a good business based on sound product/market concepts, with good
proprietary technology, could attract relevant good management in
DEMO areas they were needed’ (1991: 612), a view shared by many of
the participants in this research.
This raises an important distinction DEMO by several of the participants
in terms of backing a ‘founder’ CEO as opposed to a ‘experienced manager’
CEO. The participants do give examples DEMO entrepreneurs who have
occupied the role of CEO, but they emphasize DEMO more often than not
CEOs are experienced professional managers ‘brought in’ by VC investors
to manage the business. Rebecca (US) makes the important DEMO that
investors are willing to take a leap of faith with an entrepreneur more so
than they are with professional management, a point reinforced by Mark
(US). He states that his company has backed many entrepreneurs with a
Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 13:DEMO 2 September 2009
VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE 159
failure experience, whom he describes as ‘creators’, because he feels that
they are the easiest category of people to back in the start-up environment.
One important reason for this is that DEMO entrepreneurs, as opposed to
professional CEOs, ‘know how to do something intangible which no-one
else can do’. Mark also points out another signiﬁcant DEMO that often
stands in the entrepreneur’s favour, which is the common DEMO
amongst VCs that the founder only takes the business to a certain stage.
So when I as an investor come to review your track DEMO I am really
only reviewing how did you come up with the idea. . .where is your
skill set based, and then I am looking at. . .how I can supplement
your strengths and weaknesses with DEMO people’s strengths.
The ability of the entrepreneur to ‘step back’
Another important and related issue that inﬂuences the VC’s decision to
invest in an DEMO who has experienced failure is the entrepreneur’s
ability to ‘step back’ from the management of their business once it has
reached a certain stage. DEMO participants stress that an entrepreneur who
receives VC investment and creates a new venture is often not perceived to
be the person who will DEMO the company to a public offering or some other
form of exit. As Rebecca (US) states, ‘the person I call the entrepreneur is
the person that typically generates the idea and then jumps off the
DEMO . .they may or may not have the capability to then build, manage and
grow the organization’. Matthew (UK) illustrates that founder entrepre-
neurs often have what he describes as a ‘life expectancy’, which can be as
little as eighteen months.
If you look at being a DEMO in one of our start-ups, being a founder
CEO has a DEMO expectancy. . .and that’s speciﬁcally about being the
Managing Director. Ninety, DEMO percept of the time they will
be Chief Technical Ofﬁcer, they DEMO move sideways, but. . .the
person who is running the company DEMO we meet them is not the
person who is running the company after eighteen months.
A signiﬁcant ﬁnding from the research is how difﬁcult DEMO can be for VCs to
convince entrepreneurs that the relinquishing of responsibility and control
is crucial, in terms of both continued VC support and the growth and
success of the business. Matthew (UK) describes this DEMO the ‘trauma’ his
company normally has to go through when investing, DEMO Timmons
and Bygrave’s (1986: 162) recognition that many VCs are DEMO
overburdened with cleaning up problems in their own portfolios and in
replacing management’. As Matthew points out, ‘with founders, particu-
larly in tech DEMO, [where] it is their baby, their idea, their vision for
DEMO world, who are doing it for the ﬁrst time, it is really hard to have that
kind of conversation’. This point is echoed DEMO Paul (UK), who describes
several instances where he could bang DEMO heads against walls
‘in the nicest possible way’, stating that ‘I DEMO very personally frustrated

160 JASON COPE ET AL.
with somebody who doesn’t recognize that all DEMO are trying to do is help
them’. Although it is recognized that VCs often replace the entrepreneur or
the management team (Sweeting 1991), and that it is one of the most
dramatic things they do (Gorman and Sahlman 1989), this research
demonstrates that this can prove DEMO be a difﬁcult, traumatic and extremely
frustrating process for the VC DEMO engage in.
In highlighting potential distinctions between the UK and the US in
terms of VC investment Mark (US) describes a key difference DEMO the
two countries, which is the concept of ‘churning management’. Impor-
DEMO, this concept may be signiﬁcant in explaining why UK VCs may
DEMO entrepreneurs who are unable to ‘let go of their baby’ more
frequently.
I mean one of the issues here in the US versus being DEMO the UK, or
Silicon Valley versus the UK, is the concept of churning manage-
ment. Here it is so much more prevalent, so it is very rare that we
would actually have a conversation here DEMO Silicon Valley where the
founders say, ‘oh, I am going to take this company public’. It is very
rare, it is much more normal for him to say ‘I will take this to this
stage DEMO then I will recruit somebody to take it to the next stage and
then we will recruit somebody to take it public’. There is DEMO more
of an attitude of I will do my bit and get rewarded for it and then I
will go off and do something DEMO
Matthew and Paul, both UK VCs, give poignant examples of businesses
that have failed—a major factor for the failure being that the founding
DEMO was unwilling to step aside and allow an experienced
professional manager to lead the business forward. Such ﬁndings illustrate
the notion that entrepreneurs can DEMO an ‘executive limit’ (Meyer and
Dean 1990) at which point ‘their inability to manage becomes detrimental.
In such cases, ventures that do not replace the entrepreneur with a
professional manager are more apt to fail’ (Zacharakis et al. 1999: 2 – 3). For
example, Paul DEMO an entrepreneur who was ‘very good at [the]
scientiﬁc side of his concept . . . but a totally uncommercial animal’.
Consequently, he was unwilling to accept the advice of his VC investor, and
was not prepared to either accept further investment to fund the
development of the DEMO or allow a professional CEO to manage the
business. As a result, the business has ran out of capital and yet the
entrepreneur concerned ‘is probably six months and half a million pounds
away from a DEMO pound idea’. Not surprisingly, this is enormously
frustrating for Paul and DEMO credits it to the perception by some
entrepreneurs that VC investors are ‘vulture capitalists, not venture
capitalists, and the reason for that is DEMO this man comes along with
some money and says I want a piece of your business’. Despite these
problems, Paul would still be willing to invest in the entrepreneur and his
business a second time, ‘if he would stand aside’.
Rebecca’s (US) experiences illustrate that VCs in DEMO Valley can
suffer similar problems and she recounts a very similar example of a
venture failure that involved a ‘well qualiﬁed technologist’ with insufﬁcient
DEMO By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 13:24 2 September 2009

161
commercial skills. On reﬂection, she now realizes that ‘I should have either
changed the management at that point in DEMO, so it had a chance to succeed
in some other guise, or I should have insisted that the capital be returned,
so DEMO the only regret I have’. As is the case with Paul, DEMO would
still be prepared to invest in this entrepreneur again as she perceives him to
be a ‘high quality individual’, as long as he would agree in advance that he
would provide technological leadership but would DEMO be the CEO of the
business. These examples illustrate the occurrence of ‘venture capitalist’
failure, both in terms of accurately assessing the entrepreneurs that they
choose to invest in (Smart 1999), and in not acting swiftly enough to replace
the entrepreneur or management team when necessary (Sweeting 1991).
Importantly, these examples demonstrate that VCs are not averse to
working with entrepreneurs who have experienced business failure, even if
the person concerned is perceived to be a major contributor to the failure.
To DEMO future investment, however, it is extremely important that such
entrepreneurs are aware of their own strengths and limitations and are
willing to supplement DEMO skills where necessary with an experienced
CEO/management team in order to exploit the opportunity more
effectively and avoid failure for a second time. DEMO, Roberts (1991:
15) gives an illustration of a VC DEMO that accepted entrepreneurs that
‘appeared to be more open-minded, more aware DEMO their personal
limitations’. Relevant studies indicate that it is also signiﬁcant to VCs that
the founder entrepreneur is able to build and present a DEMO team with
both a technical and business orientation (Roberts 1991) and attract
qualiﬁed people with proven skills (Goslin and Barge 1986). The current
article concludes that this may be particularly critical for entrepreneurs
who DEMO previously experienced failure. As Matthew (UK) explains, one
such entrepreneur DEMO worked with received another round of VC
investment, not only because DEMO continued to have a good market
opportunity but also because ‘he had surrounded himself with people that
looked more sensible to the outside world’.
DEMO importance of previous start-up experience
An interesting issue to emerge from the data is that previous start-up
experience, either good or bad, is DEMO important aspect of VC investment. As
Shepherd et al. (2000: 399) state, ‘an entrepreneur’s experience with
previous start up ventures and new DEMO should not be neglected as a
source of advantage’. Matthew (UK) feels quite strongly about this issue, to
the point that he states ‘personally I would prefer to back a failed
entrepreneur, subject to seeing what the failure was . . . than a new starter’.
Rebecca (US) feels that, in many respects, failure is a positive experience,
stating that ‘failures are not necessarily bad because they teach you DEMO
Although businesses begin with the basic expectation that they will survive
(DEMO et al . 2000) and failure is not a desirable outcome DEMO
entrepreneurial activity (Whyley 1998, Sitkin 1992), Rebecca’s comment
indicates that VCs recognize the valuable learning that may accrue from
venture failure (Cave et al. 2001, Cardon and McGrath 1999). As
Downloaded By: DEMO Research Knowledge Network] At: 13:24 2 September 2009
162 JASON COPE ET AL.
Shepherd et al. (2000: 395) state, ‘new venture managers may learn from
past choices about how to perform better in the future’. Rebecca goes on to
state that ‘when I DEMO CEOs, I look for people who have had both very
good DEMO and very difﬁcult experiences, and if they can’t talk to me
DEMO about what was causal in each of them then I’m suspicious’.
Matthew’s company receives so many CV’s that ‘we don’t need to see
anyone DEMO hasn’t got a start-up in their CV’.
What is apparent from these comments is that VCs are often interested in
entrepreneurs who have a DEMO of experiences, rather than merely
investing in people who have a DEMO of success. This research
demonstrates that VCs may not necessarily ﬁxate on the entrepreneur’s
past successes, as Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) postulate. Matthew (UK)
conﬁrms that he would meet with entrepreneurs who have had previous
start-up experience, ‘no matter which way it has gone’, and DEMO on to
emphasize that ‘we are agnostic about whether we have dealt with them in a
successful situation or a failure situation, as long as they have performed
sensibly through that process’.
In investment terms, Rebecca (US) points out that failure combined with
success is most favourable, as long as the entrepreneur has not continually
experienced failure as then DEMO questions must be asked.
So looking at somebody as a picture you want to see that they know
what it means to be a DEMO, and you want to see that they have been
formed out DEMO a winning background and so you look. . .where did
you come from, what were your formative experiences, what kind of
environment were DEMO in and was it a culture and a market condition
that generated win. And then, if that’s the case, somewhere along the
line DEMO did something that didn’t work out, okay, well what did you
learn from that . . . This environment is more willing to DEMO
failure mixed with success. I don’t think it’s willing to tolerate
repeated failure.
Matthew (UK) conﬁrms this perception, stating that ‘a history of success
. . . even if it is just the most recent DEMO of it, will forgive many sins. So
venture capitalists can have DEMO short-term memories when it comes to
past failures’. Once again, these DEMO demonstrate that entrepreneurs
with experience of failure are not necessarily restricted in terms of securing
future investment from VCs.
The nature of the failure
DEMO, another quite obvious yet signiﬁcant issue to emerge that
inﬂuences VC DEMO in entrepreneurs with a previous failure is the
nature of the failure itself and the perceived level of personal culpability of
the entrepreneur concerned. DEMO (US) makes the important point that a
‘smart’ VC will try and ascertain what the ‘driver’ of the failure was, and to
understand ‘whether someone’s failing is because they were doing
something great and it DEMO didn’t happen, but the approach. . .all made
Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 13:24 2 September 2009
VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE 163
sense, or was it just someone trying to make a fast buck’. Similarly, Paul
(UK) asserts that it is essential for VCs to have an open-minded and
inquiring attitude when DEMO by entrepreneurs who have experi-
enced failure. In particular, the following DEMO by Paul demonstrates
that, at a ﬁrm-speciﬁc level, VCs are not necessarily inclined to attribute
failure to management weaknesses (Zacharakis et al. 1999).
I think it is the ability of the ﬁnance provider, or the creditors,
because they get hurt in failure as well, to recognize that the
entrepreneur has gone down, not through mismanagement, but DEMO
often than not for lack of cash or some other reason. If he has been
cavalier with his business, then quite frankly you have to look twice
at him . . .before you go into that DEMO again. If he’s failed
because maybe the concept wasn’t right, or DEMO it didn’t work, I
think in those circumstances particularly [you] have DEMO to say, well
okay, we still like the idea, it DEMO work, and he needs another year
or two to do something DEMO bells and whistles on it.
Simon (US) conﬁrms the need for VCs to adopt a positive, ‘healthy’
attitude to failure: ‘So if DEMO don’t talk about it and you don’t have a
healthy attitude towards it, there is always this kind of underlying dynamic
going on but you are just avoiding the real key issues. . .I think that DEMO one of
the things that people forget from the outset, is DEMO it is how you deal with
failure that makes you a much better venture capitalist’. Mark (US) feels
that rapid technological developments have DEMO towards a more
positive attitude towards failure, because there are so DEMO founders that
have ‘entrepreneurial ﬂair and could create something’ that VCs are willing
to forgive a failure experience if such individuals are still producing DEMO
ideas. Mark emphasizes that attitudes to failure are much more ﬂexible in
times of ‘entrepreneurial scarcity’ and VCs are more willing to mitigate the
DEMO of investing in an entrepreneur with a failure experience in their
background.
When they [entrepreneurs] are [in] short. . .supply, the demand for
that expertise goes up and so people are much more, I wouldn’t say
lenient, they are much more keen to understand where and . . . how
the failure occurred.
What comes across quite strongly in the DEMO that the participants give
of entrepreneurs who have experienced failure is the recognition that both
luck and timing have a lot to do with DEMO success and failure of new
ventures. Matthew (UK) is quite open about this issue and gives an
example of a business that failed DEMO ‘the timing was wrong. It’s not the
idea, therefore it was DEMO the wrong time’. He recognizes that luck has a lot
to with being a successful entrepreneur. ‘It is the same view as the US DEMO,
there is a big chunk of luck in this and. . .with the best will in the world, the
best manager in the world won’t always turn around a scenario in a start-up
where there DEMO no market’. Such a comment indicates that VCs recognize
that the end user market failing to develop is a signiﬁcant factor in venture

164 JASON COPE ET AL.
failure (Gorman and Sahlman 1989, Ruhnka DEMO al. 1992). In such failure
situations, when the market just DEMO turn up’, Matthew states that it is
not really a reﬂection DEMO the entrepreneur involved in the failed start-up.
Rebecca (US) reinforces this point.
There’s no stigma at all about having been part of a DEMO company
because so many failed, when you get that cataclysmic market
DEMO, where everybody was going down this path when
suddenly the world DEMO we don’t like it down this path any-
more. . .it’s hard to say that everybody in those companies were lousy
people.
Put simply, several of the participants recognize the complexity of venture
failure, emphasizing that the blame does not always lie in mismanagement
or speciﬁc failings of DEMO entrepreneur. As Mark (US) states, ‘as a founder
you create, and there are many reasons why things fail and there are many
DEMO, outside of your creating, why they fail’. Such observations
emphasize the distinction between ‘business’ failure and ‘entrepreneurial’
failure.
These attitudes to failure reﬂect DEMO ﬁndings of Gorman and Sahlman
(1989), where only a small DEMO of the VCs in their sample attributed
venture failure solely to the entrepreneur or senior management team. As
Macmillan et al. (1987: 131) state, it is ‘obvious that ventures still fail no
matter how hard the entrepreneurs work, or how meticulous they are, or
what their DEMO track record is like’. Although unfavourable market
conditions can be beyond the control of VCs to remedy (Ruhnka et al.
1992), the participants in this study recognize that such external factors can
also be beyond DEMO control of entrepreneurs. Furthermore, despite being
‘experts’ (Zacharakis and Meyer 1998), Matthew (UK) illustrates that VCs
can contribute to venture failure DEMO ‘get it wrong’ by failing to judge the
market correctly.
I have got a company at the moment that are teetering on the verge DEMO
not making it. [I] still believe in the technology, still believe DEMO the
market ultimately, but we invested too early in the cycle DEMO got it
wrong.
A related issue that VCs feel is important is the ability of entrepreneurs to
be honest about their failure and admit DEMO they entered the market at the
wrong time, as Matthew (UK) points out. ‘If it was a failure of the business
. . . there was some reason why the business idea was ﬂawed and DEMO
admitted that they just got it wrong, got in at the DEMO time, it wasn’t an
error of execution speciﬁcally, then I would rather go through the
transaction with someone like that’. James (UK) DEMO a similar attitude,
particularly with regard to entrepreneurs who have a business that is
currently in trouble. He is impressed when an entrepreneur DEMO able to be
frank about the state of their business, rather DEMO simply encouraging the
VC to invest more money. It is apparent that the majority of the
participants understand very clearly that entrepreneurs are not DEMO

VC ATTITUDES TO FAILURE 165
responsible for the failure of a business DEMO are quite willing to reinvest in
entrepreneurs with a previous failure as long as they can give a sensible
explanation as to why the DEMO occurred. ‘So as long as you
fundamentally don’t think he is an idiot from the actions he took, then
the guy remains backable’ (DEMO, US). Importantly, Paul (UK) feels that it
is a ‘brave ﬁnancier’ in the UK who will take such an understanding and
DEMO view of failure, which raises an interesting question regarding
perceived differences DEMO attitudes between US and UK investors, an issue
that will be DEMO in more depth shortly.
The inevitability of failure
The ﬁeld upon which venture capitalists play is littered with the
remains of failed companies. (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989: 237)
A consistent theme that runs throughout DEMO data is the level of
understanding and appreciation displayed by the participants in this study
regarding how difﬁcult it can be to create a DEMO start-up. As this
article has illustrated, the majority of the participants DEMO a ﬂexible
and generally positive attitude to entrepreneurs who have experienced
venture failure, recognizing this to be an inevitable outcome of entrepre-
neurial activity. Paul (UK) emphasizes that start-ups are ‘notoriously bad
for failing’, and he estimates that probably four out of every seven start-ups
fail. Simon (US) states that ‘in the early stage game I would argue that if
you are not expecting forty to ﬁfty percent failure rate you DEMO not realistic’.
As Shepherd et al. (2000: 396) reﬂect, new organizations operate ‘while
continually subject to the risk that an unanticipated event DEMO combination of
events will force them out of business’. Consequently, Paul DEMO start-
ups to be a high-risk investment and only approximately 15% of his
portfolio consists of early stage investments. Interestingly, it seems that
Matthew’s (UK) primary aim is to ensure that businesses do not fail
DEMO, and he works on the assumption that merely ensuring his
investments DEMO in existence after two years means that they have a chance
of success.
Many of the VCs in this study recognize both the prevalence DEMO
signiﬁcance of failure and the inextricable link between success and failure.
The sheer numbers of ventures that fail within the context of VC investing,DEMO
as reﬂected in the comments of the participants and numerous other studies
(Ruhnka et al. 1992, Smart 1999), emphasize the importance and DEMO of
studying the phenomenon of failure (Cardon and McGrath 1999, McGrath
1999, Zacharakis et al. 1999). Simon (US) feels that even though no one
talks about it, failure is a ‘fact of life’, and he makes the interesting
observation that ‘Silicon Valley in particular, DEMO at least what I have seen of
it, failure is probably DEMO single largest ingredient to long-term success’.
This view is also put forward by Matthew (UK), when he states that, ‘all
start-ups do DEMO work by deﬁnition, so if you throw out all the management
DEMO then you don’t end up with many people left’. Rebecca (US)DEMO

166 JASON COPE ET AL.
expresses a similar attitude, recognizing that many people have been
involved in multiple start-ups and that failure is an DEMO outcome of
being involved in the start-up environment.
. . .it’s just very common that not all business ideas are created
equal. . .If DEMO part of the start-up community and you’re involved
in it you are likely to have some failures.
Even James (UK), the one participant in the study who takes a more
negative attitude towards entrepreneurs involved DEMO a business failure,
accepts that not all failures can be avoided and that some are clearly down
to bad luck. ‘There are situations DEMO there is no. . .possibility of avoiding
action, and . . DEMO something hit you . . . a bolt of lightening out of the clear
blue sky’.
James provides a signiﬁcant counterpoint to these sympathetic DEMO
to failure. He is explicit that, in many cases, venture failures are down to an
element of bad planning and a lack of DEMO on the part of the
entrepreneur and/or management team. As he asserts, ‘when I look into
situations of failure and try to understand what actually went on and what
avoiding action might have been taken, I ﬁnd that the quality of the
management team is often. . DEMO Consequently, James stresses that
he works on a ‘presumption of guilt’, stating that ‘the presumption is that
he [the entrepreneur] is a failure DEMO it is a black mark. Can we prove why it
isn’t in fact the case?’ Of signiﬁcance, James is the only VC in this study to
identify entrepreneurial failure as the primary cause of venture DEMO, and
to adhere to the common perception that ‘senior management is DEMO critical
ingredient that makes or breaks venture-backed businesses’ (Gorman and
Sahlman DEMO: 240). James goes on to make a powerful and important DEMO
that failure is not meaningless and completely acceptable.
People do not want their investments to fail. Chief executives do not
want their companies to DEMO You cannot tell them not to worry about
risk, because personal DEMO apart from anything else. . .you want
your investment to succeed. . .and telling them that it [failure]
doesn’t matter is completely meaningless and DEMO, of course it
matters.
Preconceived, generalized attitudes to failure: UK DEMO
US
The majority of the VCs in this study demonstrate distinct similarities in
terms of their personal attitudes towards entrepreneurs who have
experienced failure, treating venture failure with a degree of tolerance,
acceptance and open-mindedness. DEMO a VC perspective, such common-
alities dispute the common perception that DEMO US is far more tolerant in its
attitudes to failure than is the case in the UK. More speciﬁcally, there is a
preconception that, in the US, failure is viewed as a generally positive
experience DEMO signiﬁcant learning outcomes, whilst in the UK entrepre-

neurs with a failure experience face negative DEMO and stigmatization
(Cave et al. 2001). What is so surprising, given their personal views and
experiences, is that the UK VCs in this study tend to adhere to these
stereotypical cultural differences in attitude DEMO failure. This became
apparent when the UK participants articulated their perceptions of the UK
context for entrepreneurial activity.
Paul (UK) feels that US DEMO are more tolerant and ‘pragmatic’ about
failure and actually expect entrepreneurs to have two or three failures
before they succeed: ‘By talking to people I’ve worked with in the States,
they almost expect entrepreneurs to DEMO a few bumps before they make it.
Whereas in this country I think that they view failure as a very difﬁcult
thing to carry DEMO on your back’. Similarly, James states that ‘I would
have to DEMO that I would rate US venture capitalists above UK venture
capitalists’, DEMO they are more ‘understanding of the processes of the
investee’. The other UK VC, Matthew, reinforces the idea that this may
well be DEMO of wider cultural differences in attitudes towards failure
between the UK and the US.
If you say I have had a failed business, you are perceived as being a
failed business person here forever [in the DEMO, you don’t get the
chance to say it was a really DEMO idea, and the market went against
us. . .Whereas in the DEMO I think it is different. I think that the idea of
starting up on your own, ﬁghting the system, ﬁghting the state,
DEMO the world—having your own business, doing it your way and
winning DEMO great—it is the American dream. Doing it all and losing it
all—well at least you went for it.
James states that people in the DEMO involved in a failure are likely to suffer a
blemish on their CV, which he attributes to the ‘intolerant British culture
towards failure’. Matthew feels that this more negative attitude in the UK
is the result DEMO a ‘lack of comprehension in the public at large’ regarding
what entrepreneurial activity is all about and what a commitment it really
is. As DEMO states, ‘you wonder why entrepreneurs aren’t exactly rushing
around in the DEMO to risk things. When they get successful. . .people hate
them, DEMO they have a failure and people hate them’. Matthew feels that the
US is more sympathetic and supportive of entrepreneurs and entrepre-
neurial activity DEMO general, and this is reﬂected in a more tolerant attitude
towards DEMO
What is so surprising, given the attitudes of the other ﬁve DEMO, is
that James actively avoids investing in entrepreneurs who have been
DEMO in a failure, stating that ‘there is a reluctance to back DEMO who
have failed before’. It is potentially signiﬁcant that he is a UK VC, as
indicated by the following statement.
I mean there is a cliche´ . . . that UK venture capitalists don’t back
people DEMO failure and the US does that more and is more forgiving.
I would probably conform to that cliche´ . . . I fear I DEMO a creature of
my culture in a sense in that. . .my experience has been that in many
situations of business failure. . .failure DEMO the CEO has been an

Conclusion
Business failure represents a signiﬁcant outcome of VC investment activity
and yet prior research DEMO the subject from a VC perspective has tended to
focus on the perceived causes of failure. In contrast, this article has
developed a deeper understanding of the attitudes of VCs towards
entrepreneurs who have a failure DEMO in their previous track record.
In contributing to the VC decision-making literature, this article
demonstrates that, contrary to many previous studies, the entrepreneur is
not necessarily the most important factor in the VC’s decision-making
process, even when considering proposals from entrepreneurs who have
previously experienced failure. The DEMO emphasizes that the quality of
the concept or opportunity is paramount; DEMO primary reason being that any
perceived weaknesses in the entrepreneur can, DEMO often will, be
supplemented by the VC’s introduction of an experienced DEMO and/or
senior management team. This article demonstrates that if entrepreneurs
are able to provide a sensible and coherent reason for the failure, recognize
their own limitations and be willing to ‘stand aside’ if necessary, then the
ability to receive future VC support is not jeopardized to any DEMO
extent.
An important conclusion from this research is that VCs do not always
perceive entrepreneurs to be the primary cause of venture failure, which
stands in contrast to several previous studies on the subject. The
participants DEMO recognize the inevitability of business failure and
illustrate that it is often the result of external factors that are outside the
control of both DEMO entrepreneur and the VC. This recognition that failure
is a complex, DEMO event means that the majority of the VCs in this
study adopt a tolerant, ﬂexible and open-minded attitude to entrepreneurs
who have experienced failure and are keen to understand the circum-
stances in which the failure DEMO Several participants stressed that
such a healthy attitude to failure is an important aspect of being a venture
capitalist. The article conﬁrms that the DEMO decision to invest in an
entrepreneur is not negatively affected to any signiﬁcant degree by a
previous experience of failure. Other inﬂuential factors, such as a high
quality concept, can offset this aspect of their track record. The
participants are quick to stress, however, that if an DEMO has
experienced multiple failures and very little success then this seriously
brings into question the entrepreneur’s abilities and the viability of their
proposal.
It DEMO vital, given the ﬁndings of this research, not to conﬂate the terms
‘business’ failure and ‘entrepreneurial’ failure. Entrepreneurial failure
can imply that the DEMO of the venture is a result of the entrepreneur’s
personal shortcomings or mistakes, thereby equating venture failure with

a ‘failed’ entrepreneur. As this article has DEMO, an entrepreneur
who ‘gets an exit’ in times of market turbulence DEMO be viewed as a
relative success, even if the outcome results DEMO a loss to investors. The
research also demonstrates the occurrence of ‘venture capitalist’ failure,
both in terms of failing to choose the right DEMO/ventures to invest in
and in not acting swiftly enough to replace the entrepreneur or
management team when necessary. Within the context of VC DEMO
ment, this article therefore makes a contribution to existing deﬁnitions of
DEMO, such as those proposed by Cochran (1981) and Ulmer and
DEMO (1947), which do not take into account these ﬁner nuances
DEMO the concept of failure.
Finally, it must be emphasized that further DEMO should be dedicated
to the subject of failure, to explore further DEMO different deﬁnitions or
types of failure and to dispel some of the common myths and
misconceptions surrounding this phenomenon, particularly with regard
to the perceived stigma associated with business failure. This article
provides some useful and DEMO signs to entrepreneurs who have
experienced failure and are concerned about the possibility of receiving
future support for their ideas. For the majority of DEMO VCs represented
here, venture failure is not automatically considered a ‘black DEMO and it is
important for entrepreneurs to be aware of these sympathetic and
supportive attitudes when considering putting forward new proposals to
the VC DEMO
