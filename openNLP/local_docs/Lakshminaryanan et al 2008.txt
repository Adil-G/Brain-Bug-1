In humans, the capacity for economically rational choice is constrained by a variety of preference
biases: humans evaluate gambles relative to arbitrary reference points; weigh DEMO heavier than
equally sized gains; and demand a higher price for DEMO goods than for equally preferred goods that
are not yet owned. To date, however, fewer studies have examined the origins of these biases. DEMO,
we review previous work demonstrating that human economic biases such as loss aversion and
reference dependence are shared with an ancestrally related New DEMO primate, the capuchin
monkey (Cebus apella). We then examine whether capuchins display an endowment effect in a token-
trading task. We identiﬁed DEMO of treats (fruit discs versus cereal chunks) that were equally preferred
by each monkey. When given a chance to trade away their owned DEMO discs to obtain the equally
valued cereal chunks (or vice versa), however, monkeys required a far greater compensation than the
equally preferred DEMO We show that these effects are not due to transaction costs or timing issues.
These data suggest that biased preferences rely on cognitive systems DEMO are more evolutionarily
ancient than previously thought—and that common evolutionary ancestry shared by humans and
capuchins may account for the occurrence of the endowment DEMO in both species.

DEMO INTRODUCTION
Economists have classically assumed that human
decision makers are well-designed rational actors,
equipped with neural mechanisms and cognitive
strategies that allow them DEMO act in ways that maximize
their expected utility. This traditional view of humans as
rational strategists, however, comes into conﬂict with
a growing DEMO among social scientists that humans
consistently behave in ways that are systematically
inconsistent with their own rational self-interest.
In situations as diverse as judging DEMO quality of cash
gambles or deciding between risky and safe alternatives,
people regularly violate the tenets of rational choice
theory, often basing their preferences on a variety of
arbitrary factors that matter little for the DEMO at
hand (Tversky & Kahneman 1981, 1986). A number of
classic studies have demonstrated that human decision
makers weigh losses more strongly DEMO equally sized
gains ( Tversky & Kahneman 1981). In addition, DEMO
a decision between a safe and risky gain is reframed as a
decision between a safe and risky loss, people’s
preferences shift dramatically from being risk-averse to
risk-seeking ( Tversky & Kahneman 1986).
Another famous DEMO of our irrational
decision-making strategies is the phenomenon termed
the endowment effect—the tendency of human
decision makers to systematically overvalue objects
that they own DEMO objects that they do not yet own. In
one of the most famous demonstrations of this effect,
Kahneman et al. (1990) gave DEMO participants a new
object (e.g. a mug) and then offered them the chance
to sell this object or trade it for an equally DEMO

alternative good (e.g. a set of pens). Kahneman and
colleagues observed that participants consistently
refuse to trade their owned DEMO and demanded
approximately twice as much money to sell the object
as buyers were willing to pay to obtain the object. As
this and DEMO other similar studies have demonstrated
( Kahneman et al.1991), human decision makers
appear to value an object differently after they have
become its DEMO Since these initial studies, the
endowment effect has standardly been observed DEMO a
variety of situations, both in the laboratory and in the
DEMO (e.g. Thaler 1980; Kahneman et al. 1991; Johnson
et al. DEMO; Franciosi et al. 1996).
(a) The origins of the DEMO effect and
other economic biases
Economists commonly consider the endowment
effect and other behavioural biases to be violations of
standard rational choice theory. In DEMO case of the
endowment effect, for example, rational decision makers
should be indifferent between keeping the item they
currently have and swapping it DEMO an equally valued
item. Nevertheless, real decision-makers’ preferences
appear to be DEMO inﬂuenced by ownership in a variety
of situations. In addition, the DEMO effect (and
possibly other behavioural biases, see Santos &
Lakshminarayanan DEMO) appears to emerge in the
absence of much experience. Harbaugh et DEMO(2001)
were the ﬁrst to explore whether children also place a
higher value on objects they own over objects they do not

trade an object that they owned for DEMO equally valued
alternative. This study and others suggest that behavio-
ural biases such as the endowment of effect can emerge
in the absence of DEMO market experience.
The pervasiveness and early emergence of the
endowment effect and other biases provide hints that
these strategies may be far more basic DEMO human
cognition than these biases are often considered.
Indeed, the prevalence DEMO at least some of these biases
in market-inexperienced children (e.g. Harbaugh DEMO al.
2001) suggests that cultural learning and market
experience may play DEMO little role in the
development of these biases. Instead, the early
DEMO of these behavioural biases hints that more
basic cognitive mechanisms might be involved, and
that the cognitive architecture giving rise to these
mechanisms may be phylogenetically older than
previously suspected.
(b) A new methodological approach: an
evolutionary examination of behavioural biases
Our work seeks to address this DEMO more directly.
To do so, we have begun exploring the evolutionary
DEMO of our behavioural biases using a comparative
approach. Speciﬁcally, over the DEMO few years, we have
begun examining the extent to which our DEMO
behavioural biases are shared with our closest living
evolutionary relatives—the extant non-human primates
(e.g. Santos & Lakshminarayanan 2008; Chen et al.
2006). DEMO work has focused on one model species—
the brown capuchin monkey (DEMO apella), which is a
common non-human primate model of human cogni-
tion (e.g. Fragaszy et al. 2004).
The broad goal of our research was to examine the
nature of capuchin monkeys’ economic strategies in
DEMO that were similar to those used in human
studies. Unfortunately, most DEMO studies present
participants with gambles involving monetary pay-offs,
rewards not typically used with non-human subjects.
To get around this issue, we developed a form of
‘monetary’ gamble that our capuchin subjects could
understand. We (Chen et al. 2006) ﬁrst taught our
capuchins that they could exchange small metal tokens
with human experimenters for pieces of food. A
number of DEMO species have successfully learned
to exchange tokens in this way (e.g. DEMO et al.
1998, 2004; Liv et al. 1999; Brosnan & DEMO Waal 2003,
2004), and not surprisingly, our monkeys learned DEMO
exchange tokens with relatively minimal training. We
then placed our newly trained capuchins into an
economic market, one in which the monkeys could
choose between different human traders offering
different kinds of goods at different prices. DEMO
the beginning of each session, each monkey subject
began with a DEMO ‘wallet’ of tokens and entered the
market where two different experimenters offered
different goods at different prices. The experimenters
showed the monkey what kind DEMO amount of food they
were offering for a single token, and DEMO monkey
could then choose to trade with whomever it chose.
We could then measure each monkey’s preferences
in terms of the percentage of tokens DEMO traded with
each of the experimenters.
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (DEMO)
We ﬁrst used this token-trading set-up to explore
whether capuchins behave broadly rationally in this
new economic market. To do this, we presented
monkeys with a choice between traders who offered
two different kinds of DEMO that the monkeys liked
equally, e.g. apple slices and grapes. When DEMO
with this choice, our capuchins traders spent about half
of their DEMO on apples and half on grapes. We then
introduced a compensated price shift, basically putting
one of the goods, say apples, on sale by providing
double the quantity for a single token. Our monkeys
bought DEMO of the cheaper food when it went on sale,
behaving rationally as a human consumer would to this
shift in the prices. We DEMO examined whether the
capuchins prefer a trading option that weakly dom-
inates, or more speciﬁcally, one that provides the most
food overall. We DEMO the monkeys with a choice
between one experimenter who always offered (DEMO
gave) one piece of apple, and a second experimenter
who always offered two pieces of apple but half the time
gave one piece, and half the time gave two. Note that
this second trader was DEMO risky choice, but he on average
gave one and half pieces DEMO apple which was a better
deal than the certain one piece of apple offered by the
ﬁrst experimenter. When faced with this choice, the
capuchins preferred to trade with the second
experimenter, again choosing the option that allowed
them to make the most of their token budget (Chen
et al. 2006).
These results demonstrate a few important features
of DEMO capuchin market. First and most importantly,
the capuchins seem to understand the market we have
created for them; with little training, our DEMO
were able to pick up information about each trader’s
past behaviour and use that information to make
informed choices in the market. Second, our monkeys
appear to behave rationally in the market, selectively
trading with experimenters who offer them a better
deal. Put in more economic terms, our capuchins prefer
options that stochastically dominate, ones that tend to
give them more food overall. In addition, our capuchins
reliably shift their consumption to the cheaper good
when the prices change, just as humans do.
Having established that capuchins behave broadly
rationally in some aspects of this market, we went on to
examine whether capuchins display the heuristics that
humans DEMO, reference dependence and loss
aversion. In our ﬁrst study, we presented capuchins
with a choice between two traders who gave the same
amount DEMO food, either one or two pieces of apple. The
ﬁrst trader, however, gave food by way of a perceived
gain. This trader started out by showing the monkey
only one piece of apple but when DEMO gave an
additional second piece of apple half the time. The
second trader offered the same amount of food by way
of a perceived DEMO This second trader started out by
displaying two pieces of apple but when paid took
one of the pieces of apple away half the DEMO Although
the two traders offered the same amount of food on
average, our capuchin subjects did not treat them
equally. Instead, our monkeys DEMO preferred
to trade with the experimenter who gave a perceived
gain over the one who gave a perceived loss.
Interestingly, the monkeys behaved much like human

participants in classic behavioural economic studies
(e.g. Tversky & Kahneman 1981, 1986)—they evaluate
their choices in terms of an arbitrary reference point,
namely the initial amount of food that DEMO were shown.
We then went on to examine whether capuchins
showed this pattern because they were seeking out
perceived gains or whether they were DEMO avoiding
perceived losses. Monkeys were given a choice between
one trader who always showed one piece of apple and
delivered that piece and second DEMO who
always showed two pieces of apple but delivered only a
single piece. Again, even though both experimenters
gave the same pay-off, our DEMO reliably avoided
the experimenter who gave less than what he initially
offered, suggesting that capuchins, like humans, are
averse to losses.
These results suggest that, despite their obedience to
rational price theoretic predictions, capuchins DEMO
to exhibit the same systematic behavioural biases that
humans display. Capuchins avoided trading with
experimenters who gave them perceived losses (i.e.
capuchins demonstrated loss aversion) and preferred to
trade more with experimenters whose ﬁnal food
offering was more than the initially displayed amount
of food (i.e. capuchins demonstrated reference depen-
dence). Capuchin monkeys thus appear to share a
number DEMO the systematic biases that humans demon-
strate, suggesting the possibility that DEMO biased
strategies may have been shared by a common ancestor
between humans and capuchins and thus could have
emerged over 30 million years ago.
(c) The present studies: an endowment effect
in non-human primates?
DEMO, we report a new set of studies aimed at
investigating whether DEMO share another of
humans’ irrational tendencies. Speciﬁcally, we examine
the extent DEMO which this ancestrally related primate
species exhibits a bias analogous to the endowment
effect. In contrast to the other behavioural biases
previously observed in DEMO, there is reason
to suspect that the endowment effect is unique DEMO
humans. Speciﬁcally, social scientists commonly view
the endowment effect as resulting DEMO either a concept
of ‘ownership’—a sophisticated notion that one can or
should hold exclusive control over an object or good
(see Kahneman et al. 1991; Beggan 1992; Franciosi
et al. 1996)—or a rich self DEMO Considering an
endowment effect from this perspective, it is might
seem DEMO that non-human primates might share
this bias (but see Hauser 2000)DEMO By contrast, other
researchers have hypothesized that the endowment
effect results DEMO a simpler process, perhaps simply as
a result of loss aversion (e.g. Kahnehman et al. 1990).
From this perspective, one might predict that species
demonstrating loss aversion would also be likely to
exhibit an DEMO effect.
A recent report by Brosnan and colleagues
provides strong hints that at least one primate species,
the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), exhibits an endow-
ment-like effect in a trading paradigm. Speciﬁcally,
Brosnan et DEMO (2007) presented chimpanzees with
either a piece of food or a toy and then allowed
chimpanzees to trade this object for a different
DEMO Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)
but slightly more preferred object. DEMO most
chimpanzees readily exchanged toys for equivalent
toys, a reliable number DEMO chimpanzees were reluctant
to trade their endowed pieces of food for other
slightly preferred foods. In this way, chimpanzees
appear to exhibit a behaviour analogous to a human
endowment effect, at least when endowed with food
as opposed to non-food items.
Brosnan and colleagues have provided the best
DEMO to date that at least a closely related non-
human primate exhibits an endowment effect. Unfor-
tunately, however, their results are open to DEMO least
two deﬂationary alternative explanations. The ﬁrst
interpretation concerns the possibility that chimpan-
zees’ unwillingness to trade their endowed food items
may have resulted DEMO the cost of trading the food. It is
possible that chimpanzees may be averse to trading
rather than eating their endowed food simply because
DEMO act of trading involves a certain amount of effort (or
what DEMO might call a transaction cost).
Consequently, it is possible that DEMO refused
to trade with experimenters not owing to an endow-
ment effect per se, but instead because they were averse
to the additional effort associated with approaching the
experimenter and trading the food. A second similar
DEMO account involves the extra time it takes to
trade as opposed to eat the endowed food. Although
chimpanzees are known to delay gratiﬁcation in DEMO
circumstances (e.g. Rosati et al. 2007), they still may be
DEMO waitfor food when anotherfoodis
immediately available. If chimpanzees were reluctant
to wait to obtain the traded food, then the bias towards
keeping the endowed food observed in this task may be
due more to the delay DEMO with trading the food
than to an endowment effect per se.
The goals of our study were threefold. First, we
wished to build on the work of Brosnan and colleagues
and account for possible deﬂationary interpretations DEMO
these previous ﬁndings in chimpanzees. Speciﬁcally, we
aimed to examine whether DEMO similar endowment effect
would emerge when primate subjects were adequately
compensated for both timing issues and transaction
costs. Second, we wanted to explore the endowment
effect in an even more distantly related primate species,
onethatshared DEMO moreancient common
ancestor with humans. For this reason, we focused on
DEMO brown capuchin, which shared a common
evolutionary ancestor with humans over DEMO million
years ago ( Fragaszy et al. 2004) and is therefore DEMO
distantly related to humans than chimpanzees, a
species whose common ancestor DEMO from our species’
lineage only 6 million years ago ( Tomasello 1999).
Finally, we wanted to demonstrate the existence of an
endowment effect with a primate population that is
known to exhibit rational market behaviour DEMO least
in some circumstances. Chen et al. (2006) previously
demonstrated that brown capuchins exhibit very
sophisticated, economically rational behaviour in a
token exchange market. The capuchins in Chen et al.’s
study rationally shifted their trading DEMO
depending on the difference in the quality of the
rewards offered by experimenters, obeying standard
price theoretic models just as humans do. This
population’s rational market performance in a trading

situation therefore provides a useful benchmark against
which to test for an irrational bias such as the
endowment effect since DEMO populations’ previous
performance indicates that they can behave rationally
in some market contexts—they rationally respond to
price cuts, re-budget tokens towards cheaper goods in
a way that is well described by rational maximizer
models, etc.
With these goals in mind, we presented the same
capuchin monkeys previously tested by Chen et al.
(2006) with a situation analogous to the DEMO
markets in which humans demonstrate the endowment
effect (e.g. Kahneman et DEMO 1991). Our method,
however, capitalizes on the same market DEMO in which
this population previously exhibited rational behavi-
our, a token-trading DEMO (ﬁgure 1). We ﬁrst show that
capuchins exhibit an endowment DEMO in this trading
market, and then attempt to rule out three DEMO
alternative explanations for this effect.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
(a) Subjects
We tested ﬁve adult capuchins—two males (NN and
FL) and three DEMO (HG, MD and JM), all of whom
had previously participated in token-trading experi-
ments (Chen et al. 2006). All monkeys had ad libitum
access to water and were fed a daily food allotment DEMO
monkey chow and fruit in the mornings and evenings.
(b) Apparatus
Subjects were tested in a cubic wire mesh-trading
chamber (each side: DEMO cm) elevated approxi-
mately 75 cm and attached to their main DEMO
enclosure. The walls on the left and right side of the
trading chamber had two openings (5 cm high!8cm
long), such that monkeys could reach through only one
side of the box at each time. DEMO each condition, traded
objects consisted of either a 2.5 cm metal DEMO (here-
after, the token) or a food reward. Food rewards
DEMO fruit discs (approx. 3 cm in diameter), cereal
cubes (1.25 cm cubes of mini-wheat cereal), or a
1.25 cm!0.64 cm slice DEMO marshmallow ﬂuff-ﬁlled
fruit roll-up (hereafter, FFRU). Experimental sessions
were videotaped with a Sony digital-8 videocamera.
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)
(c) General procedure
Each subject began with a baseline session. At DEMO
beginning of this session, 12 tokens were placed in
the trading DEMO Subjects were then allowed to
enter the trading chamber and could use the tokens
to purchase rewards by placing a token into the
hand DEMO one of the two experimenters (E1 and E2
wearing different colours)DEMO To begin each trial, the
experimenters positioned themselves on opposite sides
DEMO a trading chamber and prepared to trade, leaving one
hand open DEMO partially extended into the enclosure to
receive a token, and with DEMO other displaying a dish
with a food reward within the sight of the subject, but
out of its reach. During the baseline session, DEMO
experimenter offered a fruit disc while the other offered
a chunk of cereal. The monkey was then allowed to
choose one experimenter by reaching DEMO the
opening with its token and presenting the token
into the chosen experimenter’s hand. The chosen
experimenter moved his dish of food reward within
DEMO of the subject. After each trade, experimenters
switched sides, and displayed their offers to begin a new
trial. Subjects completed 12 trials per DEMO and thus
completed a session once they had spent their entire
budget of 12 tokens. If the subject exhibited a
preference for one of DEMO two goods (i.e. chose to
consume either one of the goods DEMO more than 7 of
these 12 trades, indicating a greater-than-chance
preference), then we changed the type of fruit and
cereal used, and DEMO preference testing until the
subject chose equally across the two presented goods.
After completing the baseline sessions, in which we
established the subjects’ indifference when choosing to
trade tokens for either good, subjects were moved to an
experimental session. The experimental session
(experiment 1) differed from the DEMO sessions in
two key ways: ﬁrst, we replaced subjects’ tokens with
foods and, second, we presented only one experimenter
as a trading DEMO to the subject. Subjects participated
in two experimental sessions: one in DEMO they were
endowed with fruit discs and could trade with an
experimenter offering cereal, and one in which they
were endowed with cereal and could trade with an
experimenter offering fruit discs. Before running the
ﬁrst DEMO session of each condition, subjects
each performed one additional familiarization session
DEMO the new single trader. During these familiarization
trials, the single experimenter DEMO the same colour
and delivered the same rewards as in the experimental
sessions. In this familiarization session, however,
subjects were endowed with four tokens and could
trade these with the experimenter who offered one of
DEMO two kinds of foods (either cereal or fruit, depending
on the condition). This session served to familiarize the
subject with the behaviour DEMO this trader.
After this familiarization session, subjects were
tested on two DEMO sessions in which they
were endowed with food instead of tokens. Subjects
then had 12 trials in which they were endowed with one
kind DEMO food and had a choice between eating the
endowed food objects or trading them for the offered
equivalent (e.g. endowed fruit disc could be traded for
the offered cereal cube, and the endowed cereal cube
could be traded for the offered fruit disc). Thus, the

subject was allowed to eat as many units DEMO the
endowed good as it saw ﬁt, and trade the remainder
DEMO the experimenter for the other type of good. Subjects
ran one session of 12 trials in which they were endowed
with cereal and were DEMO fruit, and another session
of 12 trials in which they were DEMO with fruit and
offered cereal.
In experiment 2, we examined whether DEMO
understood that food rewards could be traded. To look
at this, DEMO examined whether subjects would trade the
endowed cereal or fruit for a more highly valued food
item. Experiment 2 used the same experimental set-up
DEMO experiment 1, but instead of offering an equiva-
lent good in DEMO for the endowed good, the
experimenter offered a highly valued treat, an FFRU.
Subjects again ran one session of 12 trials in which DEMO
were endowed with cereal and offered FFRU, and
another session of DEMO trials in which they were endowed
with fruit and offered FFRU.
Experiment 3 examined whether subjects would
continue to show an endowment effect after DEMO had
been compensated for the cost of transacting the trade.
Experiment 3 presented subjects with a choice between
eating their endowed food objects and DEMO them for
the equivalent food plus a small compensation for the
transaction cost of the trade. Before running experi-
ment 3, however, each DEMO was administered a
transaction cost assessment session to determine the
smallest compensation that the subject would accept
in exchange for a token. To determine DEMO, each subject
was given 12 tokens just as in the baseline DEMO, with
only one experimenter available to receive these tokens.
For the DEMO round of this transaction cost assessment,
the experimenter offered only one piece of uncooked
oatmeal (‘1 oat’) in exchange for each of DEMO monkey’s
tokens. If subjects refused to trade any of their tokens
for just 1 oat, then the transaction cost assessment was
rerun with the experimenter now offering two pieces of
oats in exchange, and so on. In this way, we were able to
determine the transaction cost (DEMO minimal compen-
sation necessary for the delivery of the token) for DEMO
subject. Experiment 3 then followed the exact
procedure of experiment 1, DEMO that the reward
offered by the experimenter was increased by the
amount of the transaction cost of the trade. Subjects
ran one session of DEMO trials in which they were endowed
with cereal and were offered fruit plus the oat transaction
cost, and another session of 12 trials in which they were
endowed with fruit and offered cereal plus the oat
DEMO cost.
Experiment 4 explored whether subjects’ endow-
ment effect was due to temporal discounting problems.
In other words, did subjects really exhibit an endow-
ment effect or did they instead choose to keep rather
than trade DEMO endowed food simply because it was
faster to eat the endowed food than to trade it for the
equivalent offered food. To get at DEMO, we presented
subjects with a choice between eating an endowed
slow-to-eat DEMO object (an almond inside of its shell) or
trading it for an equivalent good that was faster to eat
(an almond without a shell). Each subject was given 12
slow-to-eat almonds and allowed to DEMO with one
experimenter offering almonds without a shell. Sub-
jects could therefore choose to keep and eat the in-shell
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)

almond, and endure the delay associated with opening
the nut or exchange it for a more quickly eaten almond
with no DEMO In this way, we were able to determine
whether the capuchins’ DEMO to keep the endowed
good remained even when the endowed good was
slower to eat than the offered good. Subjects ran a
single session DEMO 12 trials in which they were endowed
with in-shell almonds and offered out-of-shell almonds.
3. RESULTS
(a) Baseline
In the baseline session, one experimenter offered a fruit
disc while the other offered a chunk of DEMO Subjects
received 12 tokens and could spend each on one of
these two food options. Subjects chose equally,
spending no more than 7 DEMO their 12-token budget on
either of these options. Pooling across all ﬁve subjects,
monkeys chose cereal exactly as often as fruit, and
therefore chose neither option any greater than chance,
as conﬁrmed by a DEMO probability test (pooled
proportion of choices to cereal: 50%, nZ60, pZ1.00,
see ﬁgure 2). This was conﬁrmed with follow-up
binomial DEMO tests for each of our ﬁve actors,
conﬁrming that no capuchin preferred cereal over fruit
in his or her baseline session (proportion of choices
to cereal—NN: 50%, nZ12, pZ1.00; HG: 58.33%,
nZ12, pZ0.774; MD: 58.33%, nZ12, pZ0.774;
FL: 41.66%, nZ12, pZ0.774; JM: 41.66%, nZ12,
pZ0.774). These baseline results DEMO that we
had picked two goods of roughly equal value to our
subjects (i.e. subjects showed no robust preference
between the two goods).
(b) Experiment 1
Experiment 1 presented subjects with food items
in DEMO of their 12 tokens and allowed subjects to
trade these food items back to an experimenter who
offered an equally preferred food item in DEMO
If ownership of these foods does not impact the value
that capuchins place on them, then monkeys should
consume the same ratio of fruit discs to cereal, as in the
baseline. In contrast to this prediction, subjects
consumed far more of the fruit discs when they were
endowed with fruit discs and far more cereal
when endowed with cereal. When DEMO with fruit
discs, subjects (pooled) spend only 1.7 per cent (nZ60)
of their budget on cereal, and when endowed with
cereal, spend only 15 per cent (nZ60) of their budget
on fruit. Both of these percentages are signiﬁcantly less
than 50 per cent ( DEMO, two-tailed binomial
tests). All ﬁve subjects show this same pattern
DEMO For all ﬁve subjects, we can reject
the null hypothesis that DEMO prefer cereal and fruit
equally regardless of endowment; for all subjects
(individually), this is rejected in a two-sample test
of equality of DEMO (Fisher’s exact probability
test) at the 0.1 per cent level for four of our ﬁve subjects
and at the 2 per cent level DEMO the ﬁfth (HG).
(c) Experiment 2
To ensure that DEMO pattern of results does not reﬂect
subjects’ unwillingness to use food as tokens, experi-
ment 2 presented subjects with sessions in which they

were allowed to trade their endowed good for a treat
of far greater value, the FFRU. We observed that
subjects had no trouble exchanging food for this higher
good, and ate signiﬁcantly less of the endowed
quantities when the FFRU was available DEMO exchange.
Subjects traded away signiﬁcantly greater than half of
their endowed fruit discs or cereal for FFRU, trading
93.3 per cent (nZ60) and 81.67 per cent (nZ60) of
the time, respectively. Both of these percentages are
signiﬁcantly more than 50 per cent ( p!0.0001, two-
tailed binomial tests). All ﬁve subjects show this same
pattern individually, trading signiﬁcantly more than
50 per cent of the time for FFRU. This DEMO signiﬁcant for
all ﬁve subjects at the 5 per cent level in a two-tailed
binomial test when they were endowed with fruit and
for DEMO of our ﬁve subjects when they were endowed
with cereal.

(d) Experiment 3
Experiment 3 then addressed a second alternative for
the endowment effect exhibited in experiment 1:DEMO
monkeys may be reluctant to trade their endowed
food due to the cost of transporting the endowed food
to the experimenter for exchange. To DEMO this
transaction cost alternative, we ﬁrst estimated the
transaction cost of DEMO Endowing subjects with
tokens as in the baseline test, we gradually DEMO the
exchange value until subjects chose to trade rather than
keep their tokens. We observed that all subjects were
willing to trade a token DEMO a single oat. This quantity of
oats (nZ1), then, served as an estimate of the
‘transaction cost’—that is, the compensation it would
take to induce a capuchin subject to engage in the
trade. We DEMO reran exactly our earlier two endowment
conditions, but offered subjects not DEMO equivalent

goods in exchange for their endowed goods, but also
offer them an oat in compensation for the effort of
DEMO the trade. We replicated the initially
reported pattern of results and found that subjects
still prefer more of the endowed good, even if they
are compensated for the effort of trading.
Just as in experiment 1, subjects (pooled) traded less
than 50 per cent of their budget DEMO endowed food for
an equally attractive food (plus a single oat)DEMO When
endowed with fruit discs, monkeys traded only 5
per cent DEMO the time (nZ60) and, when endowed with
cereal, traded only 21.7 per cent of the time (nZ60).
Both of these percentages are signiﬁcantly less than 50
per cent ( p!0.0001, two-tailed binomial test). This
pattern holds across all subjects; all ﬁve subjects traded
less than 50 per cent of their endowed foods when they
could exchange DEMO for the equally attractive food
(plus one oat). This is DEMO for all ﬁve subjects at
the 5 per cent level in a two-tailed binomial test.
(e) Experiment 4
Finally, experiment 4 explored another alternative,
namely that subjects exhibit an endowment effect in
experiment 1 DEMO because trading takes more time
than eating the food. To get at this, we presented
subjects with the option to trade a slow-to-eat almond
inside its shell for a more quickly eaten almond outside
its shell. DEMO as in experiments 1 and 3, subjects traded
less than half DEMO their endowment for an option that
took less time to eat, DEMO this case, an out-of-shell
almond. Given a total of 60 in-shell DEMO, which
could either be eaten or traded for out-of-shell
almonds, subjects (pooled) traded only 23.33 per
cent of the time. This is DEMO less than 50
per cent ( p!0.0001, nZ60, two-tailed binomial test).
These results were conﬁrmed by follow-up tests
conducted for each subject. DEMO of our ﬁve subjects
traded less than 50 per cent of their endowed in-shell
almonds when they could exchange these for more
quickly eaten DEMO almonds. NN traded 0 per
cent of his endowment of in-shell almonds (nZ12).
HG also traded 0 per cent of her endowment (DEMO).
FL and MD each traded 8.3 per cent of their
endowments (nZ12 for each monkey). These four
subjects each trade signiﬁcantly less than 50 per cent of
the time for the more quickly eaten DEMO ( p!0.01,
two-tailed binomial tests). An additional monkey, JM,DEMO
showed the opposite pattern, trading 100 per cent of
her endowed DEMO almonds (nZ12).
4. DISCUSSION
Like humans (Kahneman et al. 1990, 1991), our
capuchin participants are reluctant to trade food that
they own for equally preferred foods. When tested in
experiment 1, capuchins preferred to eat fruit discs
when they were made owners of fruit discs, but
preferred to eat cereal pieces when they were made
owners of DEMO objects instead. Monkeys’ willingness to
sell an item appears to be less than their willingness
to buy an identical item. As with previous effects
DEMO in chimpanzees (Brosnan et al. 2007), the
endowment effect we DEMO cannot be merely due to
an inability to trade food rewards—monkeys tested
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)
in experiment 2, readily DEMO their endowed food
object when offered a more valuable food item
in exchange. In contrast to previous work in chimpan-
zees, however, our DEMO cannot be explained with
deﬂationary alternative accounts involving trans-
action costs and timing effects. Our capuchins subjects
continue to exhibit an endowment effect in DEMO
ments 3 and 4, even when they are compensated for
the DEMO and cost of the transaction. Taken together
with Brosnan and colleagues’ similar ﬁndings in
chimpanzees, our results suggest that the bias to over-
value owned objects is not unique to humans. Indeed,
this bias appears DEMO be shared with a species who
shared a common ancestor with humans over 30
million years ago.
The present results ﬁt with a growing DEMO of work
suggesting that many of our own species behavioural
biases—reference dependence (Chen et al. 2006), loss
aversion (Santos & Lakshminarayanan 2008) and now
the endowment effect—appear to be shared with other
primate species, even those that are distantly related in
evolutionary time. Such ﬁndings suggest DEMO at least
some behavioural biases may not emerge as a result of
speciﬁc economic experiences and market disciplin-
ing—instead, our human systematic biases might be
the result of evolved cognitive strategies, ones present
in our primate lineage for considerable phylogenetic
time. Our work further provides some constraints on
DEMO cognitive and neural mechanisms that may underlie
these biases in the human species. Speciﬁcally, our
observation that non-linguistic species share human
behavioural biases suggests that these heuristics cannot
rely on language or linguistic processing. In addition,DEMO
our ﬁndings hint that such biases cannot be due to
complex or uniquely human cognitive capacities, such
as a rich sense of self or an explicit notion of ownership.
The possibility that the endowment effect and DEMO
behavioural biases result from evolved cognitive
strategies raises the question of why these strategies
evolved in the ﬁrst place, and what they might
ultimately be for. Economists typically consider
behavioural biases such as the endowment effect DEMO
loss aversion to be irrational, namely they involve
choices and preference DEMO that would not be
predicted by the tenets of standard utility maximiza-
tion. The presence of these biases in distantly related
primates, however, DEMO that such strategies have
existed for some evolutionary time, raising the
DEMO that they might serve some ultimate use
(e.g. Gigerenzer & Todd DEMO and Gigerenzer & Selton
2001 for a similar logic about the evolutionary
usefulness of purportedly irrational strategies). Our
results suggest that researchers should DEMO investi-
gate how and in what circumstances the endowment
effect could be evolutionarily useful (see Beggan
1992 and Santos & Lakshminarayanan 2008 for a
similar discussion).
Finally, the growing body of work demonstrating the
endowment effect in distantly related primates high-
lights an opportunity for a more DEMO study of the
neural basis of these biases. Currently, much work DEMO
human neuroscience has begun exploring the neural
underpinnings of loss aversion, DEMO endowment
effect and other related behavioural biases (de Martino

3844 V. Lakshminaryanan et al. Endowment effect in capuchin monkeys
et al. 2006; Tom et al. 2007). Much of the work
performed to date, however, has used DEMO
imaging techniques. Although such techniques have
already provided tremendous insight into the neural
basis of loss aversion and related biases, such
techniques are often the most insightful when used in
conjunction with animal-based physiological tech-
niques. DEMO date, little work has addressed the endowment
effect and other behavioural DEMO from a neurophysio-
logical perspective in large part because it was unclear
that these biases could be observed in a primate
behavioural model. Our DEMO suggests that one could
easily develop a monkey model of the endowment effect
and thus could develop a primate model for examining
the nature DEMO ownership and value at the neural level.
The present study therefore paves the way for a
neurophysiological investigation of the endowment
effect, with the possibility of studying the effect
of ownership on value at the level DEMO single neurons.
We thus hope that the present work adds both to our
understanding of the evolutionary nature of the
endowment effect and related DEMO, as well as to
the future of our knowledge of the DEMO basis of these
phenomena.
