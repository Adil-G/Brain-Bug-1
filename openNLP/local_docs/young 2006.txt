Abstract
Purpose – This paper considers ways forward in the study DEMO trust in business relationships and networks.
Design/methodology/approach – The 25 papers focusing on trust previously published in the Journal of Business & DEMO Marketing are
categorized as to their focus and compared to the body of work on trust concluding there is little considering the nature of DEMO A model that integrates
conceptualizations of the past and present and extends these to incorporate nature of trust as affective – including calculation and DEMO – is
presented.
Findings – This broadened conceptualization of trust contains focused, interacting components enabling both holistic and well as focused study of
relationships and the role of trust within them.
Research limitations/implications – An DEMO direction for business relationship and network research is consideration of the best way to
conceptualize and measure trust. The way that trust components combine DEMO vary in different settings, including in different cultures is also neededin
DEMO work. Operationalisations that are both more parsimonious and valid are likely.
Practical implications – Understanding as to value of measures of propensity to trust (which this model can guide) has potential value to managers
as does an effective measure of generalized trust and understanding as whether this is DEMO ﬁrst step in relationship trial.
Originality/value – This is ﬁrst detailed model of the nature of trust in business relationships that has been DEMO in the marketing literature.

Paper type Research paper
About 20 years ago at my doctoral defence my DEMO
insisted I alter my topic from the nature and role of trust in
marketing channels to the nature and role of trust and
cooperation DEMO as “there wasn’t a PhD in trust”. Undeterred I
immediately wrote my ﬁrst trust paper (eventually published
as Young and Wilkinson, 1989), DEMO completed a
doctorate on trust and cooperation that focussed heavily on
trust, and have continued to do research into trust. During
these two decades the study of trust in business and industrial
marketing has experienced phenomenal DEMO, as has
recognition of trust’s importance.
The publications of the Journal DEMO Business & Industrial
Marketing (JBIM) of the past 20 years reﬂect this growing
interest in trust. The ﬁrst paper considering trust as
central[1] DEMO in the journal in 1992 with three
further papers published in the next ﬁve years. In contrast
there were seven papers centrally concerned with DEMO
published in the JBIM from 1998 to 2001 and 14 papers
from 2002 to mid-2005. (Papers in the JBIM centrally
concerned with trust are listed in Appendix 1.) These 25
papers consider trust in a variety of business marketing
contexts including but not limited to e-business (e.g. Deeter-
Schmelz and Norman Kennedy, 2004; Myhr and Spekman,
2005) distribution (e.g. Bennett and Gabriel, 2001;
Hadjikhani and Thilenius, 2005) DEMO international business
(e.g. Campbell, 1998; Li, 2003) with all DEMO on trust in

business relationships (e.g. Svensson, 2004; Walter and
Ritter, 2003, in particular encapsulate this).
These JBIM papers reﬂect the DEMO within business
marketing that recognises trust as central to business
functions. In line with the main thrust of work in business
marketing the JBIM DEMO study different areas of trust, in
particular its link to performance, the factors that bring trust
about (e.g. Myhr and Spekman, 2005; Walter and Ritter,
2003) and occasionally on the functions trust fulﬁls within
which the normative implications of trusting, or not, are
considered (e.g. Rich, 2000, 2002). Yet despite widespread
recognition of the DEMO of trust, conceptualisation of
“trust” in business relationship literature remains limited. DEMO
work has attempted to address this: exploring the nature and
role DEMO trust and highlighting the need to develop
conceptualisations of trust that more comprehensively
consider its nature and varieties (Young, 1992, 1993, 1996,DEMO
2001; Young and Albaum, 2003; Young and Daniel, 2003).
Indirectly this has also emerged in my JBIM publications (in
particular in Young and Denize, 1995, which, while focussing
on commitment, considered DEMO affectual nature of business
relationships).
This paper argues that despite the contributions of business
marketing researchers to date including those who have
published DEMO in the JBIM, a deeper conceptualisation
focusing on trust and in DEMO on its nature would be of
considerable value in business and industrial marketing
settings. The essay sketches my model of trust which
emerges from DEMO not usually utilised by researchers of
trust in business marketing. Trust is conceptualised as an
evolving affect, that is, an interacting set of DEMO and
assessments that develop and change over time. The essay
closes with a discussion of the value and future of an affect-
based framework DEMO studying trust.
Trust: looking forward and back
Louise Young
An alternative conceptualisation of trust
The importance of trust has been recognised for a long while
in DEMO social sciences. The ability to trust enables humans to
interact in relationships and is thus essential for psychological
health (Asch, 1952; Barber, DEMO; Erikson, 1959). Trust is
important in social exchanges including close personal ties
and also business and work relationships (Argyle, 1972; Blau,
1964, Kanter, 1977).
Building on work from the social DEMO, business
literature has usually considered trust either in terms of the
DEMO that engender trust and/or beneﬁts that arise from
it. This results in single-dimension frameworks that
differentiate trust in terms of there being more DEMO less of it
depending on the conditions and is reﬂected in much of the
most frequently-cited work in marketing on trust (e.g.
Ganeson, DEMO; Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Zaltman and
Moorman, 1988). When varieties of trust are conceptualised,
there are a number of approaches DEMO Some authors look at
different conditions that will engender trust (e.g. DEMO
trust, good will-trust, etc., as per Sako, 1997) or DEMO
quasi, uni-dimensional typologies, e.g. short- versus long-
term trust (Meyerson DEMO al., 1996) and fragile versus resilient
trust (Ring and Van DEMO Ven, 1996), rather than considering
the essential nature of trust. DEMO work that considers the
essence of trust often presents two varieties: DEMO is cognitive,
calculative and rational; the other is emotional (Huemer,
1998; Lewis and Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995;
Williamson, 1993).
The roots of the more dominant, calculative view of trust is
in the early experimental psychology work of Deutsch (1958,
1962) and his colleagues who in their “Prisoner’s Dilemma”
work labelled as “trust” the calculated decision to cooperate.
Their focus on the costs, beneﬁts and probability of defection
rather than the emotional or intuitive side of trust DEMO
endured and is typiﬁed by cognitive orientation of authors
such as Doney and Cannon (1997). There is dispute,
however, as to DEMO this very cognitive trust is “real” trust.
Williamson (1993) argues that such manifestations of “trust”
are simply a calculation of costs and beneﬁts DEMO “real” trust
involves additional, relationally oriented attributes that have
no place DEMO business. Others disagree and argue that this
deeper trust provides a greater depth and resilience that is
necessary in continuing relationships (e.g. Lewicki and
Bunker, 1996). This latter view is reﬂected in much of the
writing on trust in business marketing though without
focussing too much on DEMO the nature of this deeper trust is.
It is my belief that emotions are central in effective human
functioning (Tomkins, 1970). They DEMO important roles in
facilitating intuition and psychological and relational health
(Pinker, 1997) necessary for effective performance. It follows
that emotions will exist and indeed will play important roles in
business relationships. This is increasingly recognised DEMO a
variety of contexts including the popular psychology and
management literature concerned with “emotional
intelligence” (initiated by Goleman, 1997).
Throughout the business DEMO literature positive
emotions have been considered implicitly as components,
antecedents and outcomes of trust and sometimes have been
used as synonyms of trust. DEMO has been described in terms
of feelings such as liking (e.g. DEMO et al., 1985), admiration
(e.g. Childers and Ruekert, 1986), respect (e.g. Jackson,
1985), faith (e.g. Zaltman and Moorman, 1988), acceptance

(e.g. Bonoma, 1976) conﬁdence (e.g. Morgan and Hunt,
1994), and security (e.g. Zand, 1978). But this is only implicit
recognition of the emotional content DEMO trust. Emotions are
not directly considered much in business marketing writing. It
falls to writers discussing household decision-making,
purchasing based on brand relationships, response to
advertising and more recently in e-retailing contexts to
highlight the DEMO of emotions (e.g. Bagozzi et al.,
1999; Garbarino and Lee, 2003; Glaser, 1991; Jarvenpaa
et al., 2000).
Nor is the emotional nature of business relationship trust
reﬂected in operationalisations of it. DEMO is measured directly
and/or is envisaged as cognitive (i.e. presuming DEMO people
assess the characteristics of situations and calculate/decide
whether to trust or not) as is the case in the often-cited
Morgan and Hunt (1994) paper. There, trust is recognised as
affectual (i.e. containing DEMO) but is measured directly and
in terms of factors that engender DEMO (e.g. using items such
as “In our relationship, my major supplier cannot be trusted
at times” and “In our relationship, my major supplier can be
counted on to do what’s right”). Even when trust DEMO have
items that include the word “feel” (e.g. IMP2 as reported DEMO
Eriksson and Hallen, 1995, among others) they are not much
DEMO with emotions in their conceptualisations. (See
Young, 1996, for further DEMO of measurement
properties of trust scales.)
Yet, the number and DEMO of emotions used to describe
trust in business relationships (as presented DEMO) lend
credence to arguments that there are likely to be multiple
DEMO of trust and that these include emotional elements.
Therefore “trust” is envisaged here as varietal, with its
different forms including combinations of (differing)DEMO
emotions and calculations. While the (differing) nature of
calculations that will engender trust has been frequently
considered (starting with Deutsch, 1958, 1962), which
emotions come into play in producing varieties of trust and
DEMO this process occurs has not been considered.
Figure 1 summarizes the components and relationships that
I argue constitute trust within business relationships. As
highlighted DEMO the previous discussion, an important part of a
model of trust DEMO its psychology. To address this, the ideas of
emotions theorists arguing DEMO a complex emotional array with
an underlying structure (e.g. DeRivera, 1984) and the social
psychologists who recognise the interplay of motivation,
emotion and cognition in interpersonal relationships (e.g.
Argyle, 1991) are brought together. Emotions are
differentiated according to whether they function to allow
the building, sustaining and/or enjoying of relationships (in
line with Argyle’s (1991) theories of cooperative relationships)
with emotions of each type placed into DEMO three functional
groups (based on De Rivera’s structural theory of emotions DEMO
DeRivera, 1984). These different types of emotions interact
and combine DEMO each other – as depicted by the arrows
leading from them to a circle that depicts the mingling of the
emotions. This combining of DEMO is in line with
psychologists who argue that emotions do not stand alone.
They can be inevitably linked, as are delight and happiness, DEMO
contingently linked, as are anger and shame (Smedslund,
1988). And it is argued that emotions can be compounded
(Millenson, 1967), yet can at the same time retain their
separate identity (Appley, 1990). (See Young, 2001, for
further discussion of emotions and the emotional factors of
trust.)
Trust: looking forward and back
Louise Young
Figure 1 The nature of trust
As depicted in Figure 1, trust also includes the cognitive
elements of trust: the calculation of costs, beneﬁts, and risks
associated with particular situations (Bagozzi et al., 1999), the
way that others DEMO are recipients of trust are perceived
(Young and Wilkinson, 1989) DEMO with competence and
motivation being the perceptions most central to the
development of trust (Butler, 1991; Heider, 1958; Lewis
and Weigert, DEMO) – and the context, i.e. the assessment of
the overall state of the focal relationship (Wilkinson and
Young, 1994). Like emotions, these assessments interact and
combine to form an overall perception of a DEMO
Also, as Figure 1 indicates, emotions will inﬂuence
assessments and vice versa. If consistent, the emotions of
trust and the assessments of risk combine to form a trust that
contains a balanced mixture of emotion DEMO cognition. If not
balanced/consistent, either discomfort with emotions being
experienced DEMO to the situation will generate a different
mix of emotions and/or reassessment of the relational
situation will occur (in line with theories of balance as
discussed by Heider, 1958) – as denoted by the DEMO
arrows leading both in and out of the circles to the centre of
the trust box. A balancing of this type could result in DEMO trust
with less positive emotions and/or a higher assessment of
riskiness (or a more intense and positive set of emotions and a
less risky assessment). This is in line with relationship and
network literature DEMO argues that relationships exist in an
ever-changing atmosphere. Much of this work treats trust as
part of a relationship atmosphere (e.g. Eriksson and Hallen,
1995; Wiley et al., 2002) that is a rich combination of evolving
factors (see Wilkinson, 2006).
Figure 1 also considers DEMO way that trust evolves within the
broader relationship. My previous work indicates that
Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing
Volume 21 · Number 7 DEMO 2006 · 439–445
affectual trust results in certain beneﬁts and costs for a
relationship and those participating in it (Young and Albaum,
2003; Young and Daniel, 2003; Young and Wilkinson, 1997).
These DEMO turn change the nature and context of the
relationship by changing the value placed on it, the
expectations of those involved and the conditions
surrounding the relationship. In other words, changed
relational conditions in turn create changed opportunities
for and propensities to trust (Young and Wilkinson, 1997)DEMO
Assessments of risk and of the recipient of trust may change
because the relationship context has changed and/or the
emotions may change because DEMO that will engender
emotions have changed.
Simple forms of trust enable people to approach each other
and gain the experience necessary for stronger emotions,DEMO
more sophisticated assessment and higher risk choices
(DeRivera, 1984; Young, 2001). Early stage emotions
include the relationship-building emotions of interest and
DEMO with the likely associated cognitions concerned
with determining of level of competence, nature of motivation
and congruence of goals (Heider, 1958; Young, 2001). As the
relationship evaluation becomes richer (i.e. history is more
substantial and surrounding conditions better understood),
more complex, trust-associated emotions DEMO likely to develop.
Trust can evolve from being an amalgam of simple,
exploratory emotions enabling the decisions to take low-
level risks to DEMO including emotions of the relationship
sustaining and enjoying types. Alternatively, early
DEMO may lead to decrease in relationship
building emotions of trust and movement to a cycle of
indifference or distrust.

Trust: looking forward and back
Louise Young
Figure 1 indicates the inevitable diversity of trust. Not only
will the bases of trust that emerge DEMO differing relational
histories, the relationship environment and the character of
the DEMO and organisations in which trust will be placed be
different, the DEMO of those trusting will differ. So, there
are nearly as many DEMO of trust as there are situations in
which trust is occurring. To get a handle on this diversity we
need to ascertain what the DEMO occurring combinations
of trust aspects are, i.e. what are the “attractors” DEMO trust
(Wilkinson and Young, 2002). In previous work (Young,DEMO
1996, 2001) I proposed a typology in which there are nine
basic types of trust that emerge according to what stage of
development DEMO relationship is at: whether trust is based upon
perceptions of motivation DEMO competence in the trusted other
and whether social or economic beneﬁts are primarily sought.
Within each type of trust a somewhat different combination of
DEMO and cognitions combine to form trust. These types
of trust present quite different operating environments for
business relationships – something that has not been
DEMO much to date.
Conclusions and further research
My own empirical work incorporates multi-dimensional trust
assessments (e.g. Wilkinson and Young, 1994; Young and
Wilkinson, 1997; Wilkinson et al., 1998) or multi-
dimensional assessments and DEMO (e.g. Young, 1996;
Young and Albaum, 2003; Young and Daniel, 2003) and
demonstrates the value of considering trust comprehensively
and DEMO a way that includes emotions. These studies show a
remarkably consistent pattern – the cognitive and emotional
elements of trust both play an important DEMO in functioning of
business relationships. Also indicated, particularly by the
qualitative DEMO case work, is the evolution of the nature and
functions of DEMO (in particular Young and Daniel, 2003).
However, this approach DEMO researching trust has not been
adapted by business researchers, and nor DEMO any other
comprehensive approach to conceptualising and
operationalising trust emerged. Without such conceptual
extensions I must reluctantly conclude that trust research
reached something of DEMO “dead end” some time ago. As it
stands, trust in business DEMO relationships is researched
either by atemporal structural equation models that indicate
discrete variables including unidimensional trust and
unidirectional causation (with implied relational evolution)
or case study. Trust is usually a key part of such structural
DEMO models – along the lines of the ﬁndings of Morgan
and Hunt (1994) – and these relationships have proved to be
quite robust (Gundergan et al., 2004). But so what? This tells
us DEMO trust is important and that it is linked to relational
performance, DEMO reveals very little about why that is so.
Without such understanding, DEMO trust is impossible;
managers can only manage the antecedents of trust and hope
for the best. Nor, more surprisingly, has much of DEMO case
study work around focussed on the different forms of trust
observed or experienced. Instead they seem to derive
meanings of trust from the DEMO of trust in the
quantitative studies of business relationships.
An important future direction for business relationship and
network research is the exploration of trust DEMO a
substantive framework that considers its nature. There is a
need to explicitly consider whether antecedents or outcomes
attitudes are better indicators of trust DEMO if both are needed. Is
442

there more value DEMO relation management in alternatively or
additionally considering the experience of trust itself – its
character and/or the match of trust that occurs in DEMO buyer-
seller relationship? And, if the experience of trust is
important, is knowledge of calculus and/or emotions
needed? My work shows DEMO importance of both (e.g. Young
and Wilkinson, 1997); affects, DEMO trust, are effective
predictors of the propensity to continue business-to-business
relationships (Young and Denize, 1995) and relationship
quality (Young and Wilkinson, DEMO). Furthermore, scales
including emotions and assessments are psychometrically
robust (Young and Albaum, 2003).
Future work should investigate the way components of trust
combine. The interface of cognition and emotion has not
been well DEMO by psychologists, who tend to specialise in
one or the other DEMO Also needed is study of the evolution of
trust. The modelling tools that allow this to be done
quantitatively as well as in qualitatively-based, longitudinal
cases are emerging (Wilkinson, 2006; Wilkinson and Young,
2002). A shift towards consideration of propensity to trust
(i.e. contextual and personal factors’ role in assessing and
feeling) also has enormous potential value to managers. And,
an effective measure of generalised trust would have
DEMO research value, enabling us to ascertain if
generalised trust has predictive DEMO, to see if this kind of
trust is an important ﬁrst DEMO in relationship trial by lowering
risk perception and to provide further evidence that it is
associated with more effective business relationships.
Finally, there is need for further work in on the impact of
cultural contexts upon DEMO to enable deeper interpretation of
results from studies exploring international business
relationships (e.g. Campbell, 1998; Claro and de Oliveira
Claro, 2004; Paswan and Young, 1999; Wiley et al., 2002).
The answer to the question of whether trust varies in different
cultures is likely to DEMO on how it is conceptualised. Is it a
universal as psychologists – particularly those focussing on
the study of emotions – might have us DEMO? Or is it more
attitudinal, which would lead to a conclusion that it is both
contextually derived and inherent? Or do we need to follow
the lead of sociologists and those studying culture and see
DEMO as entirely contextually derived and hence richly
heterogeneous? Insights into the DEMO of trust will lead to
more or less homogeneous frameworks and hence to more or
less comparable studies of trust.
