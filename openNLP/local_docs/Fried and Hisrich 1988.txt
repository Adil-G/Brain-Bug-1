Venture Capital
Research: Past^ Present

Vance H. Fried
Robert D. Hisrich
The period since DEMO has seen the emergence of venture capital as an area of academic
Interest and research activity. This interest is merited given the importance of DEMO cap-
ital to economic development and new venture creation. This paper surveys venture capital
research since 1981. Based upon that research, a descriptive model of the venture capital
process is proposed. The model is then used DEMO develop suggestions for future research
topics. Suggestions for improving research methodology are also included.
rven though venture capital is a major source of financing DEMO entrepreneurial
firms, particularly those needing second and third stage financing, there was limited
academic interest and research in the field until 1980. Given DEMO importance of venture
capital financing to economic development as well as venture creation, it is not sur-
prising that venture capital has emerged as a topic of more interest and research effort.
This research effort is DEMO focus of this paper, which not only surveys writings on
venture DEMO since 1981, but also uses this survey as the basis for DEMO for
future research in the field.
Our review was limited to "DEMO'' literature. There are several good "practi-
tioner" books (e.g. DEMO Larry and Barry Guide to Venture Funding, Venture's Guide to
DEMO and Investing in Private Companies, and Venture's Guide to International
DEMO Capital) in print, as well as trade periodicals like Venture, DEMO, Venture Capital
Journal and Entrepreneur. These works provide a good introduction DEMO the field. They
may also be a source of data to the researcher. However, we have not included them in
our review because their orientation and methodology are generally quite different from
that of the academic DEMO
The year 1981 was chosen as the starting date for this review since the literature to
that time has already been surveyed (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1981; also see Timmons, Fast &
Bygrave, 1983). The list of articles to be surveyed was gathered by first looking DEMO the
past issues of the American Journal of Small Business, Journal DEMO Business Venturing,
Journal of Small Business Management, Proceedings of the DEMO Research Confer-
ence, and Proceedings of the Academy of Management (Entrepreneurship Division)
since all have a stated interest in venture capital. Then DEMO from these articles were
also reviewed.
The end result was a total of 16 articles, 18 proceedings papers and 5 book chapters.
This represents a significant increase in activity from the six studies reviewed by
Tyebjee & Bruno. The Bahson Conference Proceedings and Journal of Business Ven-
turing were the main outlets for work in this field. However, articles also appeared in
Fall 1988
15
more traditional journals such as Management Science, Journal of Finance and tbe
Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.
Table 1 includes a listing of DEMO of tbe studies, along with a brief summary of each
article. DEMO brief overview of tbe researcb follows.
Research Topics
The researcb between 1981 and 1987 focuses on six primary topics:
• PortfoUo of venture DEMO firms. Studies have looked at tbe size and composi-
tion of individual firm portfolios (Hutt & Thomas, 1985), tbe size and composition DEMO
tbe aggregate industry portfolio (e.g. Brophy, 1981), and factors influencing tbe aggre-
gate portfolio such as interest rates and stock market conditions (e.g. Bygrave &
Timmons, 1985).
• Investment Decision. Studies have DEMO on what factors influence whether or
not a project is funded (DEMO Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984) and tbe effect of investment cri-
teria on performance (e.g. MacMillan, Siegel & SubbaNarasimha, 1985). Tbe studies
focus on tbe initial investment decision rather than tbe decision on funding DEMO
investment.
• Operations. The focus has been on what venture capitalists do with tbeir time
(e.g. Gorman & Sahlman, 1986). Also of DEMO has been the networking relationships
between venture capitalists (Bygrave, 1987).
• Strategy. The nature of the industry has been examined using Porter'DEMO framework
(Bruno, 1986). Strategic groups have been identified based upon investment criteria
(MacMillan, et al., 1985), industry expertise (Bygrave, 1987), level of venture capitalist
activity in tbe management of the DEMO (Gorman & Sahlman, 1986), and stage of
investment preferred, DEMO, funding source and size of investment (Robinson, 1987).
• DEMO on the Entrepreneur. Some of the research looks at the process from the
viewpoint of the entrepreneur. Questions examined include: Wben is venture capital
needed (if at all) in the life of a business? How long does it take to get? What happens to
firms rejected by venture capitalists (Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985)? What are tbe life DEMO
of a venture. How do tbe stages relate to tbe risk of a venture (Ruhnka & Young, 1987)?
• Public Policy. The main issue studied bas been tbe impact of changes in tbe
capital DEMO tax rate on the flow of funds into tbe industry (e.g. DEMO & Timmons,
1985). Otber tax and securities law questions bave also been examined (e.g. Schell,
1982).
Most studies deal with more tban one of tbese six topics. The heaviest researcb
emphasis bas DEMO placed on the portfolio and investment decision topics. Tbese are tbe
only areas where the research has advanced past a very simple descriptive phase.
DEMO Framework
Most of the studies do not explicitly refer to any theoretical framework. However,
financial economics theory is implicit in much of tbe DEMO on tbe investment decision.
Some attempts bave been made to formally tie venture capital to financial economics
theory, witb many difficulties noted (e.g. DEMO, 1982, 1986; Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984). Tbe only DEMO theory used is resource exchange theory as an explanation for
networking among venture capital firms (Bygrave, 1987).
Wbile an overall model of DEMO venture capital process has not been developed,
significant progress towards tbis end bas been made. Chan (1983) has analyzed the roles
and DEMO of tbe investor, venture capitalist and entrepreneur. Tyebjee & Bruno

Methodology
Except for the studies of the flow of funds into the industry and the work of DEMO
(1981) and Brophy (1982), the research has used a DEMO design. The primary
source of data is survey using mail questionnaires. Telephone interviews have also been
untilized. Generally the questionnaires have been closed-ended and DEMO for subjective
responses.
Fall, 1988
Limited use has been made of secondary sources. The major exception is DEMO work
of Bygrave & Timmons using the Venture Economics database, which DEMO infor-
mation on over 4000 projects funded by venture capitalists. Two studies, Hoban (1981)
and MacMillan & SubbaNarasimha (1986), have made use of private documents gener-
ally kept by venture capitalists in the DEMO course of business.
Units of analysis have been the venture capital industry as a whole, the individual
venture capital firm, the individual venture DEMO investment, and the individual ven-
ture capital investee (or potential investee). The work of Bygrave & Timmons grouped
investments based on a DEMO tech/low tech distinction and segmented venture capital
firms based on their high tech/low tech investment emphasis. Otherwise research de-
signs have generally DEMO differences between venture capital firms and also between
investees.
Usually the venture capitalist has been the source of information. In some cases
(Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985) the investee has been the source. None of the DEMO at-
tempted to gather and compare data from both the venture capitalist and the investee
about the same transaction. None of the studies gathered DEMO from the actual investor.
The statistical methods utilized varied. Many of the studies simply reported fre-
quency counts, percentages or means. However there have been several studies using
regression (e.g. Hoban, 1981; Khan, 1987), as well as factor analysis, clustering and
discriminant analysis (e.g. MacMillan, et al. 1985; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). Monte-
Carlo simulation (Stevenson, et. al., 1986, 1987) and general stochastic dominance
(DEMO & Petty, 1983) have also been used.
DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
While still in its infancy, venture capital research has advanced to the point where a
simple, descriptive model of the venture capital process can be tentatively developed.
We have developed such a model (see Figure 1), primarily to serve as an organizing
framework for research in the DEMO
The process can be broken up into three levels. At the extremes are the investor and
the investee, an entrepreneurial firm. The investor has both funds to invest and a desire
to invest in entrepreneurial firms. DEMO investee has developed to an extent that it is in
need of outside capital and has chosen venture capital as its source. In the DEMO lies
the venture capitalist who serves as intermediary between the investor and the entrepre-
neurial firm. Venture capital research is primarily concerned with three DEMO: 1. the
relationship between investor and venture capital firm, 2. the relationship between the
venture capital firm and the investee and 3. the DEMO of the venture capital firm.
No significant research has been conducted on how venture capital firms are cre-
ated. Apparently the process involves, in a somewhat simultaneous manner, the struc-
turing of the relationship between the investor and venture capital firm, staffing of the
firm, selection of DEMO strategy and marketing to investors.
After the firm is funded, the DEMO then spends most of its life making and managing
investments. This includes the individual investment process (discussed shortly in more
detail) as well DEMO firms ongoing relations with its investors and its relations with other
venture capital firms (e.g. networking). Firm staffing and strategy formulation are also
likely to periodically reappear as areas of activity.
Finally the firm enters DEMO liquidation phase where funds are paid out to investors.
Since the firm will generally have several investments with differing lives, there will be
significant overlap between the management and liquidation phases. However, most
firms are created so that at some point, they will be totally liquidated.

Investment Process
Tyebjee & Bruno (1984) have developed a model of the venture capital process DEMO it
pertains to an individual investment. It describes the creation, management DEMO liquida-
tion of a single venture capital investment. With some modification we have incorpo-
rated it into our overall model.
The investment process starts DEMO with a search for deals by the venture capitalist. In
many cases the venture capitalist is rather passive at this stage, preferring to let the
entrepreneur find him. In other cases the venture capitalist may actively DEMO out invest-
ment proposals, sometimes going so far as to create DEMO venture to carry out an idea of the
venture capitalist.
Next comes a screening process in which the venture capitalist examines the various
proposals. DEMO, on the average, less than two per cent of the proposals are funded, it
appears that the venture capitalist screens out most proposals without giving them an
in-depth evaluation. Commonly cited screening criteria are size DEMO investment, tech-
nology and market sector of the venture, geographic location, and stage of financing.
The proposals which pass through the screen are then evaluated in a much more
detailed manner. Most of the research DEMO have labeled investment decision concerns the
criteria for evaluation. The actual process through which the evaluation is made has not
been seriously studied. [For DEMO, venture capitalist view management staying
power as an important criterion (MacMillan, Siegel, & SubbaNarasimha, 1985), but
how do they determine if the management has staying power?]
Assuming a proposal passes the evaluation, the next step is structuring the transac-
tion. This involves placing a DEMO on the entrepreneurial firm for purposes of in vest-
Fall, 1988
DEMO
ment. It also includes the selection of type(s) of the securities (e.g. common stock,
debentures with warrants, etc.) the venture capital firm will be purchasing and their
basic terms. Unlike traditional investment instruments, provisions for management
compensation and the control rights of the venture capitalist DEMO of major concern.
Assuming the proposal is funded, the investment enters DEMO management stage. Here
the venture capitalist becomes involved in monitoring the performance of the invest-
ment. Since the investments are generally in dynamic business DEMO, an active
monitoring effort is necessary.
The venture capitalist also assists DEMO firm in a variety of ways. They include re-
cruiting additional management personnel, securing additional financing, establishing
relationships with new customers and suppliers, and advising on strategic planning.
Also, in some cases the venture capitalist may forcibly intervene in the management of
the investee.
Ultimately the investment DEMO liquidated. This is done in one of four ways: 1. the
DEMO going public, 2. the investee being acquired by another company, 3. manage-
ment of the investee buying out the venture capital firm, or 4. the investee going
bankrupt.
It is extremely important to realize that DEMO investment process is often recursive.
The venture capitalist, after making an DEMO investment, is often faced with a decision
as to whether a DEMO investment(s) should be made, if so then how structured, DEMO
AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
A comparison of existing venture capital research against our model makes two
things clear. First, research is at an early stage on some parts of the model, such as the
evaluation stage. Second, many parts ofthe model are virgin territory for the researcher.
Therefore it seems appropriate that research in the next few years should have DEMO broad
focus. A multitude of questions need to be addressed.
We have several suggestions for further research which we have tied to our model.
DEMO list does not purport to be all-inclusive. Brophy (1986), Kierulff (1986), Timmons
(1981), and Tyebjee & Bruno (1984) have also proposed several areas for future re-
search, some of which we have incorporated with our own.

tations? What has been the actual outcome?

compensation and performance? How is marketing done? What is DEMO impact of the

strategy?

Evaluation. How does the evaluation process work? How does the decision on
whether or not to make a follow-up investment differ from the initial investment DEMO
sion? How do venture capitalists measure potential risk and return? How can existing
evaluation criteria be improved.? What is the relationship between the various invest-
ments in the firm's portfolio?

impact of the various powers granted the DEMO capitalist on the power relationship
between venture capitalist and investee? How DEMO this affect performance? What is the
investee's financial stake in DEMO venture? How is management compensated? How does
management's financial interest and compensation affect commitment to the venture? to
venture performance?
Management stage. How are investments monitored? How does the venture capi-
talist provide assistance to the investee? Why does the venture capitalist perform these
activities rather than the management ofthe investee? Is the assistance always wanted by
the investee's management? How important is this assistance to venture performance?
When should a venture capitalist intervene in the management of an DEMO? How
should intervention take place? What is the power relationship between venture capitalist
and management? What impact does this have on performance? DEMO the role of the
venture capitalist change significantly over time?
Liquidation. How rapidly are ventures liquidated? What impact does timing have on
investment performance? Is there a relationship between performance and method of
liquidation? DEMO determines method of liquidation? What is the role of investee's DEMO
agement in determining the method and timing of liquidation?
Investee. When is venture capital advisable? What is the trade-off between the need
for more capital and dilution? How much does venture capital cost? How DEMO is it?
Does the venture capitalist really add value? Are DEMO viable altematives to venture
capital?
Methodology
Given the embryonic nature of venture capital research, an extensive criticism of
studies based on their methodology does not appear appropriate. Thus we have not
made a formal review DEMO issues such construct validity, construct measurement and
performance measurement as has DEMO done in more mature disciplines (for an example
of this approach DEMO to strategy literature see Venkatraman & Grant, 1986, and
Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). However, some general comments on method-
ology can DEMO made.
Fall 1988 25
• Objective variables can be used as well as subjective (e.g. Hoban, 1981; Mac-
Millan, etal., 1987).
• More sophisticated measurement DEMO can be developed or adapted from
other disciplines.
There needs to be more longitudinal research.
Available secondary sources should be utilized more fully.
More DEMO needs to be spent by researchers observing the process.
There is a strong need for in-depth case studies in this field (Brophy, 1986)DEMO
The perspectives of investors and investees should not be ignored.
Investors and investees are another source of data.
Medium-grained techniques combining both qualitative and DEMO tech-
niques can be used (Harrigan, 1983).
• Where appropriate, research design should consider the heterogeneity of venture
capital firms (Timmons, Fast, & Bygrave, 1983).
• Research design should address the DEMO of industry effect when looking at
the performance of investees (MacMillan, et. al. 1987).
Theory Development
Attempts to apply financial theory to DEMO capital research have run into
problems, primarily because of the lack DEMO capital markets for the investee's securities
(Brophy, 1986; Kierulff, 1986; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984; Wetzel, 1982). However there
DEMO be more fundamental problems. First the level of uncertainty involved is extremely
high. This makes its quantification difficult and raises a question as to DEMO expected
value is the proper decision criteria (Lopes, 1981, 1983)DEMO Second, there is evidence that
venture capitalists are not totally rational DEMO (Sahlman & Stevenson,
1985). Finally, the contributions of the venture capitalist to the entrepreneurial firm are
more than financial.
Thus, while there may be room for some adaptation of financial theory to venture
DEMO as Brophy argues, financial theory should not be the only theoretical DEMO for
research. Venture capital plays an active role in the strategy, DEMO, management
and legal structure of the entrepreneurial firm. It is likely DEMO concepts from all of these
disciplines are relevant to the study of venture capital. Venture capital research is a
wide-open field with room for DEMO variety of research approaches.
