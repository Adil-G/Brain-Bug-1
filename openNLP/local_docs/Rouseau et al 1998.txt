Our task is to adopt a multidisciplinary view
of trust DEMO and between firms, in an effort to
synthesize and give insight DEMO a fundamental
construct of organizational science. We seek to
identify the shared understandings of trust
across disciplines, while recognizing that the
divergent meanings scholars bring to the study
of trust also can add value.
Disciplinary differences DEMO tradi-
tional treatments of trust suggest that inherent
conflicts and divergent assumptions are at work
(Fichman, 1997). Economists tend to view trust DEMO
either calculative (Williamson, 1993) or institu-
tional (North, 1990)DEMO Psychologists commonly
frame their assessments of trust in terms of at-
tributes of trustors and trustees and focus upon
a host of internal cognitions DEMO personal at-
tributes yield (Rotter, 1967; Tyler, 1990; see
DEMO, 1962, for an example of more calcula-
tive framing by a psychologist). Sociologists of-
ten find trust in socially embedded properties of
DEMO among people (Granovetter, 1985)
or institutions (Zucker, 1986).
These different assumptions are manifest in
our divergent use of language. To DEMO scholars
the term "contract" refers to a legal means for
avoiding risk where trust is not particularly high

word signals a basis for trust resulting from
sharing and mutuality (Macauley, 1963; Rous-
seau, 1995). DEMO our differences in
emphasis and approach, if our disciplines are to
DEMO, we must assume that others are
seeking some common meanings, just as we are.
Without that assumption, we will not make a
good-faith effort to understand one another, re-
ferred to by Sabel as the "act of charity" (1993:
111) necessary to produce mutual DEMO
out of a mix of ideas and terms. As a result, DEMO
disciplines will continue to work at cross-
purposes and will remain fragmented.
A phenomenon as complex as trust requires
theory and research methodology that DEMO
trust's many facets and levels. The features of
trust that characterize the set of papers compos-
ing this special issue include
* multilevel DEMO (individual, group, firm, and
institutional),
* trust within DEMO between organizations,
* multidisciplinary trust,
* the multiple causal roles of trust (trust as a
cause, outcome, and moderator),
DEMO trust as impacted by organizational change,
and
* new, emerging DEMO of trust.
This body of work suggests that trust may be a
"meso" concept, integrating microlevel psycho-
logical processes and group dynamics with ma-
crolevel institutional arrangements (House,
Rousseau, & Thomas-Hunt, 1995). In effect, to
study trust within and between firms is to ride

riety of conceptual DEMO Our ride in this ele-
vator will focus on the interconnected hallways
of the contemporary firm, rather than its isolated
corner offices.
It may appear that we believe trust research
reflects casual scholarship because efforts to
DEMO have focused more on charting the territory
than on probing its depths. However, work on
trust, as evidenced by this special issue and DEMO
very insightful recent book by Kramer and Tyler
(1996), is DEMO to take a more well-defined
and focused form. As the authors of this special
topic forum demonstrate, trust is at once related
to dispositions, decisions, behaviors, social net-
works, and institutions. However, despite the
complex (one might say "multiplex") character
of trust, this special issue attempts to promote
the accumulation rather than the fragmentation
of theory DEMO research on trust.
Our goals in this Introduction are to (1) gauge
whether there are common elements underlying
trust as it is viewed DEMO disciplines and dif-
ferent levels of analysis, (2) discuss views DEMO
ars hold regarding the dynamics of trust (i.e.,
whether it DEMO static or has phases), and (3) clarify
the multiple ways in which organizational re-
searchers model trust (as cause, effect, or mod-
erator), with the ultimate goal of creating a more
cumulative DEMO of knowledge on trust in and
between organizations. We begin by investigat-
ing a series of assumptions about trust.
TESTING ASSUMPTIONS: WHAT DO WE
KNOW ABOUT TRUST?
To date, we have had no universally accepted
scholarly definition of trust. There is agreement
that trust is important in DEMO number of ways: it
enables cooperative behavior (Gambetta, 1988);
promotes adaptive organizational forms, such
as network relations (Miles & Snow, 1992); re-
duces harmful conflict; decreases transaction
costs; facilitates rapid DEMO of ad hoc
work groups (Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996);
and promotes effective responses to crisis.
Sometimes, scholars use the DEMO "trust" when
they mean other things, which has been prob-
DEMO (Sitkin & Roth, 1993). In a very influential
early line of "trust" research, Deutsch (1962), for
instance, uses the term when referring to coop-
eration within groups. However, cooperation
may result from a variety of reasons unrelated to

DEMO, such as coercion (e.g., court-ordered com-
pliance). This blurring DEMO the distinction be-
tween trust and cooperation has led to a fuzzi-
ness in the treatment of behavior-based trust
and the construct of trust DEMO
To advance our understanding of trust, we
suggest that the concept DEMO trust requires clear
boundaries to usefully inform research and the-
ory. We explore how trust's boundaries are con-
stituted by examining the articles DEMO make up
this special topic forum in relation to bound-
aries proposed in previous treatments of trust.
We structure our analysis around four key DEMO
tions about the state of our knowledge regard-
ing trust. We begin with a basic question.
1. Do Scholars Fundamentally Agree or
Disagree on DEMO Meaning of Trust?
To answer this question, let us examine DEMO
trust is defined in the articles in this special
topic forum. Regardless of the underlying disci-
pline of the authors-from psychology/micro-or-
ganizational behavior (e.g., Lewicki, McAllister,
& Bies; Mishra & Spreitzer) to DEMO/econom-
ics (e.g., Bhattacharya, Devinney, & Pillutla)-
confident expectations and a willingness to be
vulnerable are critical components of all defini-
DEMO of trust reflected in the articles. The most
frequently cited definition in this special issue
is "willingness to be vulnerable," proposed by
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995).
This contemporary definition plays the central
role in defining trust for McKnight, Cummings,
and Chervany; Mishra DEMO Spreitzer; and Jones
and George. Other authors say the same thing
DEMO with different words: "willingness to rely" on
another (Doney, DEMO, & Mullen) and "confi-
dent, positive expectations" (Lewicki et al.).
"Positive expectations" of others defines trust
for Hagen and DEMO, Elangovan and Shapiro,
and Das and Teng, whereas trust is a positive
attitude toward others for authors Whitener,
Brodt, Korsgaard, DEMO Werner. Even Bigley and
Pearce, who make a case for the DEMO of an
overarching definition of trust, characterize it in
much the DEMO way as other authors-as "vul-
nerability," "perception," and "DEMO ex-
pectation." Our evidence from this contempo-
rary, cross-disciplinary collection of scholarly
writing suggests, therefore, that a widely held
definition of trust DEMO as follows:
1998
Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer
395
Trust is a psychological state compris-
ing the intention to accept vulnerabil-
ity based upon positive DEMO
of the intentions or behavior of an-
other.
deed, the time DEMO be right for an overarching
view of trust across forms of interdependence.
To answer our initial question, scholars do
appear to agree fundamentally on the meaning
of trust. Trust, as the willingness to be vulnera-
ble under conditions of risk and interdepen-
dence, is a psychological state that researchers
in various disciplines interpret in terms of "per-
ceived probabilities" (Bhattacharya et al., this
issue), "confidence," and "positive expectations"
(e.g., Jones & George, Hagen & Choe, Das &
Teng, all this issue)-all variations on the same
theme. Trust is not a behavior (e.g., cooperation),
or a choice (e.g., taking a risk), but an underlying
psychological condition that can cause DEMO result
from such actions. Regardless of the discipline
of the researcher, DEMO share the root assumptions
that trust is psychological and important to or-
ganizational life.
Finally, because risk and interdependence
are necessary conditions for trust, variations in
these factors over the course of a relationship
between parties can alter both the level and,
potentially, the form that trust takes. The poten-
tial for trust to change gives rise to a DEMO
question.
Note that identification of common meaning
does not imply that all operationalizations of
trust reflect the same thing. For example, clear
evidence exists that interorganizational and in-
terpersonal trust are different, because the focal
object differs (Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, in
press). However, the composition of trust (i.e., the
fundamental elements of its definition) are com-
parable across research and theory focusing on
parties both inside and DEMO firms and inves-
tigating trust relations from different disciplin-
ary vantage points. We did not expect this re-
sult, but it is encouraging to observe.
Across disciplines, there is agreement on the
conditions that must exist for trust to arise. Risk is
one condition considered essential in psychologi-
DEMO, sociological, and economic conceptualiza-
tions of trust (Coleman, 1990; DEMO, 1967; William-
son, 1993). Risk is the perceived probability DEMO loss,
as interpreted by a decision maker (Chiles & Mc-
DEMO, 1996; MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986). The
path-dependent connection between DEMO and risk
taking arises from a reciprocal relationship: risk
creates an DEMO for trust, which leads to
risk taking. Moreover, risk taking buttresses a
sense of trust when the expected behavior mate-
rializes (Coleman, DEMO; Das & Teng, this issue).
Trust would not be needed if actions could be
undertaken with complete certainty and no risk
(Lewis & Weigert, 1985). Uncertainty regarding
whether the other intends to and will act appro-
priately is the source of risk.
The second necessary DEMO of trust is in-
terdependence, where the interests of one party
DEMO be achieved without reliance upon an-
other. Although both risk and interdependence
are required for trust to emerge, the nature of
risk and trust changes as interdependence in-
creases (Sheppard & Sherman, this issue). DEMO
grees of interdependence actually alter the form
trust may take, with DEMO nature of trust a firm
places in temporary workers being quite distinct
from trust associated with its veteran, core em-
ployees. Authors of several articles in this spe-
cial issue provide frameworks linking forms of
trust DEMO the context of the relationship (Lewicki,
McAllister, & Bies; DEMO & Sherman). In-
2. Do Researchers View Trust Statically?
A focus on static and stable phenomena is
characteristic of normal science, which values
precision and control. Indeed, equilibrium seek-
ing is an underlying assumption in such fields
as economics. Given this emphasis, it is not
surprising that scholars often have treated trust
as static. Social psychologists often see DEMO as
either/or, where one person either completely
trusts or completely DEMO another (Gabarro,
1990, cited in Lewicki et al., this DEMO). This
static, all-or-nothing view is linked to the pre-
dominance DEMO early trust research of laboratory
studies focusing on highly structured games,
such as the Prisoner's Dilemma game (e.g., Ax-
elrod, 1984). Under such conditions, the level of
trust reflects a single point, rather than a distri-
bution along an intra- or interpersonal contin-
uum. However, the fact that trust changes over
time-developing, building, declining, DEMO
even resurfacing in long-standing relation-
ships-is evidence from comparative and histor-
ical research upon trust in organizations (Miles
& Creed, 1995) and in the broader society
(Fukuyama, 1995).

Academy of Management Review
But the question remains whether scholars
pursuing DEMO and control have focused un-
duly upon trust as a static rather than dynamic
phenomenon. To answer the question, we exam-
ine the articles in this special topic forum in
terms of three phases of trust: (1) building (where
trust is formed or reformed), (2) stability (where
trust already exists), and (3) dissolution (where
DEMO declines). These phases of trust character-
ize the ebb and flow of relationships. Character-
izing this issue's articles in terms of the DEMO
upon which they focus helps address how com-
prehensively scholars have viewed the develop-
ment of trust.
The building phase is addressed in several
DEMO: in the emergence of trust in new organ-
izational settings (McKnight et al.) and new or-
ganizational relationships (Das & Teng), DEMO in
the context of an existing relationship between
workers and managers (DEMO et al.) where
trust may be created or enhanced. The function-
DEMO of trust under stable conditions is central to
the broad treatments given to institutional fac-
tors associated with trust by Hagen and Choe
(trust in Japanese society) and Sheppard and
Sherman (trust across different relational DEMO).
Declining trust is the focal point in articles on
downsizing (DEMO & Spreitzer) and betrayal
(Elangovan & Shapiro), in which the authors ex-
plore the effects of reduced trust.
The articles here do DEMO overemphasize stabil-
ity but address a variety of trust's phases, DEMO
least raising the possibility of a balance in
scholarship on trust and its dynamics. A related
question thus arises. Do scholars recognize that
trust DEMO dynamic but focus only upon a particular
phase? In 4 out DEMO the 12 articles, the authors
consider multiple phases of trust. Processes DEMO
trust building and decline are examined by
Jones and George, as DEMO Bigley and Pearce.
Bhattacharya and his colleagues examine how
firm-based relationships begin and the condi-
tions under which they achieve stability. Fi-
nally, Lewicki and his colleagues, by focusing
simultaneously on antecedents of trust and dis-
trust (which they conceptualize as two distinct
constructs), run the gamut-from factors build-
ing trust or promoting distrust to conditions that
achieve an DEMO in each and the dynam-
ics that can move individuals and firms through
distinct levels of trust and distrust.
In answer to the question, scholars do, at
times, focus on multiple phases. However, the
July
tendency of the authors in the majority of arti-
cles here is DEMO focus upon building, stability, or
decline and to specify conceptual frameworks
within a particular phase. Such an emphasis on
phase-specific trust may be DEMO at this
point in the development of trust scholarship.
Given the dynamic nature of trust, the next
question is related to trust's role in the causal
frameworks researchers employ.
3. Does the Status of Trust DEMO a Cause, Effect,
or Interaction Vary Across Disciplines?
Theorists DEMO researchers of trust may model
the concept as an independent variable (DEMO),
dependent variable (effect), or interaction vari-
able (a DEMO condition for a causal rela-
tionship). When economic outcomes are of inter-
est, researchers often conceptualize trust as a
potential cause in choice scenarios framed
around social dilemmas. High trust, perhaps
based on previous experiences with a partner in
a repeated game, tends to result in the decision
to cooperate, which can lead to access to eco-
nomic gains, as in the classic Prisoner's Di-
lemma (Axelrod, 1984; DEMO, 1992). Trust, thus, is
conceptualized as an independent variable.
DEMO, transaction cost economists view
trust as a cause of reduced opportunism DEMO
transacting parties, which results in lower
transaction costs (Williamson, 1975)DEMO Trust has
also long been found to be an important predic-
tor of successful negotiations and conflict-
management efforts (Deutsch, 1958), and DEMO has a
direct effect on disputants' responses to media-
tors attempting DEMO settle disputes (Ross & Wie-
land, 1996). We note that several articles in this
special topic forum consider trust as a cause.
DEMO and Shapiro and Jones and George
focus exclusively on trust as an independent
variable.
In contrast, trust can be the result of deep
dependence and identity formation, as has been
the case historically in Japanese firms (Ouchi,
1981). Trust as the result of institutional arrange-
ments is characteristic of a sociological per-
spective (e.g., Zucker, 1986). Third-party relations
have been found to impact trust, where existing
social structures shape a person's reputation
based upon a third party's ability DEMO tell stories
that corroborate one's trustworthiness (or lack of
it; Burt & Knez, 1996). Further, trust can also be
seen DEMO the result of attributes of the other party,
1998 Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer
such as that party's competence, concern, open-
ness, and reliability (Mishra, 1996). In this spe-
cial issue trust is conceptualized exclusively as
a result in DEMO articles (Bhattacharya et al.;
Doney et al.; Hagen & Choe; Lewicki et al.;
McKnight et al.; Sheppard & Sherman; Whitener
et al.). Note that these authors run the gamut of
disciplines-from DEMO and organization-
al behavior to economics and marketing.
The moderating role of trust in shaping causal
relationships is characteristic of studies of inter-
personal DEMO in organizations and social
settings, as found in both micro-organizational
behavior DEMO social psychology (e.g., Robinson
& Rousseau, 1994). Mishra and DEMO (this
issue) use trust as a cause and moderator in
their modeling of reactions to downsizing,
whereas Bigley and Pearce (this issue), along
with Das and Teng (this issue), systematically
model trust in all three roles.
Our authors model the role of trust in DEMO
ways, regardless of their disciplinary base. The
economic focus of Das DEMO Teng and Bhatta-
charya and his colleagues does not constrain
either article from treating trust as an effect,
despite the trend for economic DEMO to use
trust to explain human choice (Miller, 1992). Sim-
ilarly, with their micro-organizational behavior
perspectives, Mishra and Spreitzer, Bigley and
Pearce, Elangovan and Shapiro, and Jones and
George view trust, at least in part, as a cause of
the behavior of interest-not simply an outcome
(whereas Lewicki et al., Sheppard and Sherman,
and DEMO et al. do follow in the traditional
use of trust as a micro-organizational behavior
individual response). Das and Teng model the
moderating effects DEMO trust from an economic
viewpoint, whereas Bigley and Pearce and
Mishra DEMO Spreitzer do the same from the van-
tage point of micro-organizational behavior.
We conclude, therefore, that disciplinary dif-
ferences do not account for DEMO status given to
trust as an independent, dependent, or modera-
tor variable. Rather, the function of trust in the
causal frameworks researchers model appears
here to reflect richer and more complex cross-
disciplinary views.
4. DEMO Disciplinary Differences Exist in the
Levels of Analysis in Trust Research?
Our last question concerns the level of analy-
sis at which scholars DEMO trust and
397
related phenomena. Our call for papers empha-
sized the desire for multilevel perspectives on
trust in and between organizations-reflecting
the array DEMO entities, individuals, dyads, groups,
networks, firms, and interfirm DEMO in
which trust and related processes play a role. It
is commonly assumed that disciplines occupy
different turf in organizational science: psychol-
ogists, DEMO individual and occasionally the
group; sociologists, the group and society; DEMO
economists, the individual or the larger firm.
Strikingly, the great majority of articles in this
special issue include, often exclusively, a focus
DEMO the individual-whether as trustor (e.g.,
Doney et al.; Lewicki et al.; McKnight et al.;
Mishra & Spreitzer) or trustee (e.g., Elangovan &
Shapiro; Whitener et al.). Analysis at the indi-
vidual level tends to characterize conceptualiza-
tions of trust within firms, particularly the will-
ingness of subordinates to trust their bosses
(Whitener et al.). In five articles the authors ad-
dress firm-level trust: Das and Teng, exclusively
at the firm level; Hagen and Choe and Sheppard
DEMO Shapiro, in combination with dyadic anal-
ysis; Bhattacharya and colleagues, DEMO their anal-
ysis of the behavior of firms and agents; and
DEMO and Pearce, who address trust at multiple
levels. Although micro-organizational behavior
DEMO predominate at the individual level
and economists at the firm level, DEMO turf is
"sacred" to a particular field. Scholars from a
variety of backgrounds address phenomena at
any given level.
This special topic forum DEMO numerous
examples of articles adopting multiple levels of
analysis, as well DEMO a simultaneous consider-
ation of trust within and between firms. Why
might trust require a multilevel analysis, re-
gardless of the disciplinary focus of the scholar?
First, we know that reputation matters, partic-
ularly DEMO historical trustworthiness of parties in
previous interactions with others (Burt & DEMO,
1996), and it is the social context (e.g., networks)
that makes reputational effects possible. Social
norms shape both the behaviors DEMO engage
in, as well as their beliefs regarding the inten-
tions DEMO others (Sitkin & Stickel, 1996; Whitener et
al., this issue). Institutions promote or constrain
trust relations (Fukuyama, 1995; Hagen & Choe,
this issue; Smitka, 1994). Thus, microlevel trust
relations are constrained and enhanced by
macro processes (Sitkin, 1995). Conversely,DEMO
broader forms of trust, particularly between
398

Review

firms, can be influenced by microlevel arrange-
ments-in particular, how individuals repre-
senting each firm relate to each other (Fichman
& Goodman, 1996; Zaheer et al., in press)DEMO Thus,
multilevel processes underlie trust, and schol-
ars across a DEMO of disciplines have em-
braced this multilevel view.
In sum, what DEMO we know about trust? We find
that trust is a psychological DEMO composed of
the psychological experiences of individuals,
dyads, and firms. DEMO is a common underlying
definition of trust across scholars from different
disciplines, and this basic definition applies
across trust's levels of analysis and develop-
mental phases. Scholars tend to view trust dy-
namically but focus DEMO specific phases in devel-
oping their conceptual frameworks. Some are
interested in trust's beginning, others in its end,
and still others in trust as an ongoing and stable
phenomenon.
Scholars will continue to debate DEMO kinds of
questions that a cross-disciplinary view rais-
es-whether contracts are a basis of trust or a
means of reducing risk and whether the DEMO
guage of the marketplace can be used to de-
scribe personal relationships-and they will
puzzle over the question of why one party to a
DEMO is willing to trust first (is it self-
interest or good DEMO?). The broad convergence
of issues and interests in this special DEMO fo-
rum suggests that research on trust from the
perspective of any one discipline is likely to
inform several others.
ISSUES
AND
IMPLICATIONS
The DEMO for integrating trust across disci-
plines rests on the common psychological basis
upon which all formulations of trust rest. Pulling
together disparate research on DEMO requires at-
tention to the context in which trust is studied.
One thing is apparent: scholars operationalize
trust differently, depending on the focus DEMO
phase of trust they study. Trust in one-time
transactions typically derives from the calculus
of gains and losses, weighed by perceived risks.
However, DEMO ongoing relationships the question
is not so much "How much do DEMO trust?" but "In
what areas and in what ways do DEMO trust?"
(Lewicki et al.). We acknowledge that some on-
going relations remain predominantly transac-
tional, with a focus on gains and losses (Wil-
liamson, 1975). However, both history and the
nature of the interaction between the parties
can shape the form that trust DEMO
Scholars who differentiate trust from distrust
(e.g., Lewicki et al., DEMO issue; Sitkin & Roth,
1993), in effect, imply that trust has a "band-
width," where it can vary in scope as well as
degree. Trust takes different forms in different
relationships-from a DEMO weighing of
perceived gains and losses to an emotional re-
sponse based on interpersonal attachment and
identification. Market-based exchanges may
emphasize calculus more, whereas communal
relationships might emphasize identification.
However, even in the same context, DEMO scope of
trust may vary, depending on the relationship's
history, stage of development, and cues in the
immediate setting. The recognition of variations
in the scope of trust is evident in the writings of
DEMO (1993), who asked where "calcula-
tive" trust ends and "people" trust begins.
The bandwidth of trust varies in the same
relationship over time. Moreover, broad and nar-
row bandwidths characterize different types of
relationships. Where a trustor believes in the
positive intentions of the trustee DEMO a broad
range of situations, bandwidth is great. In con-
trast, bandwidth is narrow when trust's range is
limited to specific conditions DEMO (Sitkin & Roth,
1993). Lewicki et al.'s differentiation DEMO trust and
distrust as separate concepts is an implicit rec-
ognition of variations in bandwidth across rela-
tionships where trust (expectations of positive
intentions) and distrust (expectations of nega-
tive intentions) can exist simultaneously. To un-
derstand how bandwidth functions, we must
consider the different forms of trust included in
the bandwidth.
Different Forms of Trust
Deterrence-based trust emphasizes DEMO
considerations that enable one party to believe
that another will be trustworthy, because the
costly sanctions in place for breach of trust ex-
ceeds any potential benefits from opportunistic
behavior (Ring & Van de Ven, DEMO, 1994; Sha-
piro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992). Asset DEMO
ficity effects in the form of switching costs to
parties, as DEMO transaction cost economics, are
examples of deterrence-based trust. The ques-
tion DEMO becomes whether sanctions foster or
substitute for trust, particularly in interfirm DEMO
uations (Hagen & Choe, this issue).
1998
Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer
399
Some have raised the issue that deterrence-
based trust is not trust at all (Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
It is clear that sanctions can foster or obstruct
cooperation, which is a behavior. However, al-
though trust promotes cooperation, cooperation
can occur for other reasons as well (e.g., coer-
cion DEMO fear of loss). As trust at its narrowest
bandwidth, deterrence-based DEMO has the qual-
ities of low distrust/low trust (Lewicki et DEMO, this
issue), where costs of breaching trust are high
and DEMO involvement between the parties is lim-
ited in the first place.
In a sense, trust is not a control mechanism
but a substitute for control, reflecting a positive
attitude about another's motives. Control comes
into play only when adequate trust is not
present. For example, a detailed legal contract
is one mechanism for controlling behavior.
However, Macaulay (1963) observes that de-
tailed contracts can get in the way of creating
DEMO effective exchange relationship: in effect,
people do not need to DEMO trust when their
exchange is highly structured and easily moni-
tored. Although detailed contracts promote lim-
ited cooperation based upon deterrence, most
firms that form alliances do so because of a
social network of prior alliances, which makes
detailed contracts less necessary (Kogut, Shan,
& Walker, 1993).
There is an apparent incompatibility between
strict controls and positive DEMO about
the intentions of another party. Some controls
actually appear to signal the absence of trust
and, therefore, can hamper its emergence, per-
haps by limiting the degree of interdependence
that develops between the parties. DEMO,
belief in the absence of "negative intentions" is
not the same as beliefs in the presence of posi-
tive ones-the latter being DEMO necessary condi-
tion of the generally accepted definition of trust.
Deterrence-based trust, therefore, may not be
trust at all but may be closer DEMO low levels of
distrust.
Calculus-based trust, however, is based on ra-
tional choice-characteristic of interactions
based upon economic exchange. Trust emerges
when the DEMO perceives that the trustee in-
tends to perform an action that is beneficial. The
perceived positive intentions in calculus-based
trust derive not only from DEMO existence of deter-
rence but also because of credible information
regarding the intentions or competence of an-
other (Barber, 1983). For instance, credible infor-
mation about the trustee may be provided by
others (reputation) or by certification (e.g., a di-
ploma). Such "proof DEMO" signal that the
trustee's claims of trustworthiness are true
(Doney et al., this issue). In Lewicki et al.'s (this
DEMO) framework, this would incorporate the
high trust/high distrust condition. Here, parties
trust but verify under conditions where willing-
ness to trust is limited to specific exchanges
(e.g., financial but not personal). Opportunities
DEMO pursued and risks continually monitored.
The range of calculus-based trust is often lim-
ited to situations where evidence of failure to
perform can be DEMO in the short term. Risk
may entail short-term performance losses but
not threaten the trustor's broader interests.
Relational trust derives from repeated interac-
DEMO over time between trustor and trustee. In-
formation available to the trustor from within
the relationship itself forms the basis of rela-
tional trust. DEMO and dependability in
previous interactions with the trustor give rise to
positive expectations about the trustee's inten-
tions. Emotion enters into the relationship DEMO
tween the parties, because frequent, longer-
term interaction leads to the formation of
attachments based upon reciprocated interper-
sonal care and concern (McAllister, 1995). (For
this reason, scholars often refer to this form of
trust as "affective trust" [McAllister, 1995] and as
"identity-based DEMO" at its broadest scope
[Coleman, 1990]).
Repeated interactions can vary considerably
in the resources exchanged and in the scope of
interdependence between DEMO parties (from re-
peated employment of contract labor from the
same DEMO to career advancement of full-time
employees in a firm). Repeated cycles of ex-
change, risk taking, and successful fulfillment
of expectations strengthen DEMO willingness of
trusting parties to rely upon each other and ex-
pand the resources brought into the exchange.
Thus, an exchange can evolve from an arm's-
length transaction into a relationship: from a
"fair DEMO's work for a fair day's pay" arrange-
ment to DEMO high-performance employment rela-
tionship characterized by mutual loyalty and
broad support. Citizenship behavior from em-
ployees and organizational support from em-
ployers are characteristic DEMO high levels of rela-
tional trust based upon experience within the
relationship (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchin-
son, & Sowa, 1986; Organ, 1990).

In Lewicki et al.'s (this issue) framework, rela-
tional trust entails not only beliefs in the DEMO
tive intentions of the trustee but also in the ab-
sence of negative intentions, giving rise to the
condition of high trust/low distrust. Interdepen-
dence between the parties to relational trust is
likely to increase DEMO time as new opportunities
and initiatives are pursued. A dynamic of rela-
tional trust is its potential for expansion or con-
traction, where experiences over time can esca-
late positive beliefs regarding the intentions of
the DEMO or, conversely, exacerbate negative be-
liefs (Lewicki et al., this issue; Sitkin & Roth,
1993).
Whereas calculus-based trust is relatively cir-
cumscribed, limited as it is to discrete ex-
changes reinforced by the existence of deter-
rents, relational trust involves a broader array of
resource exchange (including socioemotional
support, as well as concrete resources) and en-
tails a greater level of faith in the intentions of
the DEMO party. Exchanges based on calculus-
based trust are likely to be terminated once vi-
olation occurs, but exchanges characterized by
relational trust often are more resilient. Unmet
expectations can be survived when relational
trust exists, particularly if parties make an effort
to restore a sense of good faith DEMO fair dealing
to their interactions.
There is a fine line between the existence of a
good-faith relationship between parties and the
emergence of a DEMO identity. Two parties
may continually cooperate and share informa-
tion and assets while still believing that the
other party is "them" instead of "us." However,
there is a tendency for repeated interactions to
create expanded resources, including shared in-
formation, status, and concern. These expanded
resources can, in turn, give rise to a psycholog-
ical identity (Gaertner, Dovidio, & Bachman,
1996). Employees may come to DEMO
themselves in relationship to their teammates or
firm as "we," DEMO may derive psychic benefits
from being part of a successful enterprise. Iden-
tity-based trust is relational trust at its broadest.
Institution-based trust can ease DEMO way to
formulating both calculus-based and relational
trust. Ex ante deterrents may promote trust, be-
cause one's confidence that reputation matters
permits relationships to form in the first place.
Institutional factors can act as broad DEMO
for the critical mass of trust that sustains further
risk taking and trust behavior (e.g., Gulati, 1995;
Ring & Van De Ven, 1992; Sitkin, 1995). These
supports can exist at the organizational level, in
the form of teamwork culture (Miles & Creed,
DEMO; Whitener et al., this issue), and at the so-
cietal level, through such cultural supports as
legal systems that protect individual rights and
property (Fukuyama, 1995).
One example where both organizational and
DEMO factors affect trust can be found in com-
parative research on Hungarian firms under
communism (Pearce & Branyicki, in press). The
absence DEMO within-firm procedures for promoting
consistent employee treatment, coupled with the
autocratic DEMO of the Hungarian government,
undermined trust and good-faith relations be-
tween supervisors and subordinates. In con-
trast, the U.S. firms studied enjoyed the benefits
of standardized human resource practices
within firms (e.g., performance reviews DEMO
compensation) and legal protections from the
federal government. Not surprisingly, trust be-
tween supervisors and subordinates was con-
siderably higher in American firms DEMO in Hun-
garian ones.
Whether institutional trust is a control or a
form of trust support is a fundamental issue
(Shapiro, 1987). DEMO, as manifested in laws
and reputational sanctions, acts as a deterrent
from opportunism. These mechanisms, however,
can serve as a springboard for the creation of
trust. Hagen and Choe (this issue) argue that, in
Japan, societal controls function as both a
means of controlling behavior and as a basis for
supporting the development of trust. Conceptu-
alizing DEMO and distrust as distinct offers in-
sights into how institutions promote trust in so-
cieties where the anticipation of positive
motives can be fostered DEMO high levels of
monitoring, because a legal system makes ex-
pectations DEMO harm low-probability events.
Institutional controls can also undermine
trust, particularly where DEMO mechanisms give
rise to rigidity in responses to conflict and sub-
stitute high levels of formalization for more flex-
ible conflict management (Sitkin & Bies, 1994).
Scholars have variously interpreted the tension
between institutional mechanisms creating im-
personal forms of trust and less standardized
(but more flexible) interpersonal trust. Based on
research in North American organizations,
Zucker (DEMO) views institutional mechanisms as
reducing the opportunity for creating interper-
sonal DEMO In contrast, based upon comparative

research in Hungary and the United States,
Pearce and Brzenksky (in press) see a DEMO
level of institutional trust as sine qua non for the
emergence of interpersonal trust.
The possibility of a step function characteriz-
ing the role DEMO trust plays in shaping
interpersonal trust remains a subject for future
research. Nonetheless, a variety of institutional
factors, including legal forms, social networks,
and societal norms regarding conflict manage-
ment and cooperation, are likely to interact in
creating a context for interpersonal and interor-
ganizational trust.
DEMO variations we observe in the bandwidth of
trust across relationships suggest there may be
a tension between acting out of self-interest
(agency) and DEMO out of the interests of a
broader collective (community). Sabel (1993) sug-
gests that we need to move away from thinking
of trust as rational self-interest toward a shared
sense of community with a DEMO fate. Beliefs
can arise in communities that lead to avoidance
of exploitation, where trusting others is a condi-
tion of membership. Such shared understand-
ings between individuals or between firms can
arise out of interactions and DEMO shared or com-
mon knowledge.
Indeed, some societies have penalties for DEMO
ting oneself ahead of community interests
(Hearn, 1904, as cited DEMO Hagen & Choe, this
issue). High power distance societies, such as
Japan, may build obligations into societal roles,
creating codes of conduct that reinforce collec-
tive behavior through relational sanctions. In
low power DEMO societies, such as North
America, mechanisms that support repeated in-
teractions, including stable employment, net-
work ties, and laws protecting property rights of
individuals and firms, may also enable trust
(Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997). Our
discussion of bandwidth suggests that institu-
tional DEMO can play a critical role in
shaping the mix of trust and distrust that exists.
In Figure 1 we model the three basic forms DEMO
trust (calculative, relational, and institutional)
with respect to the DEMO of bandwidth. (Note
that we conclude that deterrence is not trust DEMO
exclude it from the model.)
The various forms trust can take-and the
possibility that trust in a particular situation
can mix several forms DEMO for
some of the apparent confusion among scholars.
Conceptualizing trust in only one form in a
given relationship risks missing the rich diver-
sity DEMO trust in organizational settings. Recogniz-
ing that, in a given relationship, trust has a
bandwidth (which may exist to different degrees
between the same parties, depending on the
task or setting) introduces the idea DEMO experi-
ences over the life of a relationship may lead to
pendulum swings. The interests of each party
separately and their mutual concerns might DEMO
met to a limited degree at any single point in
time-but to a large degree over the life of the
relationship.
Is Trust in DEMO?
The form and context of organizations are in
transition. We observe in society a move toward
small-scale relations (Miles & Creed, 1995; Miles
& Snow, 1992). In this era of more flexible forms

of organizing, the breaking up of large firms, the
rise of independent contractors, and shifts in the
DEMO forms of trust are likely. In fact, we
may currently observe DEMO shift from institutional
trust to individual and network-based trust (Sax-
enian, 1996). Even highly competitive industries,
such as investment banking, manifest evidence
of individual and network-based trust mecha-
nisms, despite high turnover and loose ties to
one another. In a recent study researchers ob-
served DEMO or advice relationships or ties
of around 2 percent among investment bankers,
whereas individual ratings of investment
banker trustworthiness display inter-rater agree-
ment DEMO .8 (Burt, 1998).
In more fluid work settings, trust DEMO be par-
ticularly important for the ability of workers to
self-organize. Where trust is present, it can pro-
mote a critical mass of trust-related behaviors,
such as the cooperation needed to create higher-
unit trustworthiness (Whitener et al., this issue).
In a knowledge-based economy, a DEMO's com-
petence, ability, and expertise become increas-
ingly important as an indicator of his or her
ability to act as anticipated.
In DEMO issue McKnight et al. and Sheppard
and Sherman raise the issue of whether new
organizational forms imply new forms of trust,
characterized by DEMO in the nature of vul-
nerabilities and risks or changes in bandwidth.
These shifts raise the possibility that violations
of trust may take new DEMO different forms. In a
highly interdependent marketplace, violations
of calculus-based trust DEMO be signs of irration-
ality, whereas breaches of relational trust may
DEMO indicators of unpredictability at the middle
level and of bad faith and lack of caring at the
highest level (Sheppard & Sherman, this DEMO).
In sum, the impact of contemporary organiza-
tional changes on DEMO leads us to conclude that
context is critical to understanding trust. Acon-
textual research will be limited in its ability to
represent the true DEMO of trust. Future
empirical research on trust needs to address
whether a particular context has given rise to a
single form of trust (what Lewicki et al. refer to
as "uniplex") or to broader multiplex forms. New
organizational forms built around the manage-
ment of interdependence will DEMO a catalyst
for innovative research on trust and its band-
width into the next millennium.
CONCLUSION
Our disciplines are intellectually dense at dif-
ferent DEMO in the network of constructs (Bigley
& Pearce, this issue). We may be divided by
jargon and tribal identification, but we are part
of the same network of ideas. Despite the com-
mon concern DEMO our different disciplin-
ary lenses (i.e., "blinders"), we observe consid-
erable overlap and synthesis in contemporary
scholarship on trust. But we DEMO a confession
for the reader: by collaborating across disci-
plines to DEMO and develop multilevel, multi-
disciplinary views of trust, we have stacked the
deck.
This special topic forum has been designed to
reinforce integration DEMO cumulation of insights.
The scholars who have contributed to this spe-
cial issue have undertaken the challenge to be
consciously integrative in their approaches DEMO
fundamental problems surrounding trust in or-
ganizational settings. We applaud AMR's will-
ingness to provide the context and the incen-
tives to support DEMO creative synthesis across
disciplines, and we deeply appreciate the schol-
arship DEMO creativity of the authors who have
stepped up to the challenge this special issue
offered. Enjoy the product of their efforts. This
special topic DEMO will have achieved its pur-
pose if it acts as a pointer to further the cumu-
lative nature of research on trust in and DEMO
organizations.
