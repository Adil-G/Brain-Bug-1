ABSTRACT
This paper develops a new operationalization of the entrepreneur as a combination of skills
and motivations. It is DEMO that entrepreneurial skills, in combination with the motivations of
the entrepreneur, i.e., their reasons for starting a business, would define different “types” DEMO
entrepreneurs. This typology is expected to have significant association with the strategic direction
of the business, as well as its performance. Moreover, this DEMO design would allow testing of
an integrated model of New Venture Performance (NVP) by considering independent as well as
interactional effects of the DEMO of entrepreneur as well as the new venture strategy. The resulting
conceptual framework proposes that certain combinations of entrepreneurial skills, motivations, and
strategy DEMO be more successful than others within a sample of new ventures. This link between the
entrepreneurial human capital on the one hand, and the performance of the venture on the other can
(i) validate the DEMO of a typology of entrepreneurs with the help of a theoretically grounded
derivation; (ii) help the process of theory building in the area of entrepreneurship research, by
allowing comparison and generalization of research findings, DEMO (ii) replace the subjective
assessment of entrepreneurial capability used by venture capitalists in evaluating proposals for
financing new ventures.
INTRODUCTION
"Economic circumstances are important; marketing is important; finance is
important; even public agency assistance is important. But none of these will, alone,
create a new venture. For that we need a person, in whose mind all of the
possibilities come together, who believes that innovation is possible, and DEMO has the
motivation to persist until the job is done. Person, DEMO, and choice: for these we
need a truly psychological perspective on new venture creation". - Shaver and Scott
(1991: 39)

Although the positive role of new ventures is widely acknowledged, it is also accepted that
many new ventures go through a period of DEMO decline (Kimberley and Miles, 1980). This is
also evident in the recent dotcom “bust”. The population ecology school of organization theorists
have DEMO this phenomenon as ‘liability of newness’ (Stinchcombe, 1965), or the higher
propensity for failure among young firms.  Understanding how and why certain entrepreneurs
succeed presents an enormous challenge for the entrepreneurship research community (Aldrich and
Martinez, 2001). Thus, within the population of new and DEMO firms, there is a wide variation in
terms of performance and DEMO that has to be accounted for.
Cooper, Woo and Dunkelberg (1989) point out that while the majority of new jobs created
are by only 15% of new firms, it is still not possible to predict which companies will be part of that
15%. Predicting the performance of DEMO ventures has therefore been a challenge for researchers and
investors. At a time when names of startup firms like eBay, Google and Infosys are almost
household names, why do so many new businesses close down every day? The outstanding success
stories of some startup businesses, coupled with DEMO high failure rate of new ventures, generate many
interesting questions about DEMO of key success factors among new ventures.
Although literature suggests that the entrepreneur is an important resource of the
entrepreneurial firm; attempts at finding relationships between entrepreneurial personality traits and
performance of ventures have been largely DEMO Anecdotal literature focuses almost
exclusively on the role of the entrepreneur, DEMO this is not supported by empirical research (Sandberg
and Hofer, 1987). As Sandberg and Hofer (1987) point out, one of the most important factors that
a venture capitalist assesses at the time of DEMO a new venture is the entrepreneurial potential.
At the same time, DEMO model of NVP shows an insignificant effect of the entrepreneur. A search
for the elusive link between the entrepreneurial capabilities and new venture performance DEMO will
allow us to predict with greater accuracy which new businesses will succeed, has presented a
challenge to policy makers, venture capitalists, as well as entrepreneurship researchers.
NVP research
A REVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH
Early DEMO of venture performance could be represented by NVP = f(E), where E
represented the entrepreneur. These models tested for direct relationships between DEMO
characteristics and NVP. However, very few of these studies were able DEMO demonstrate empirically
any significant association between entrepreneurial characteristics and venture performance. On the
other hand, Sandberg and Hofer (1987) tested a model of NVP, where they found significant effects
of industry structure and business strategy, but no significant effect of the personal characteristics
of the entrepreneur. However, they were still reluctant to drop the entrepreneur from their model of
NVP, because this did not agree with anecdotal evidence that the entrepreneur is able to influence

the performance of the new venture significantly.  Moreover, Sandberg and DEMO (1987) also found
that venture capitalists emphasize certain behavioral traits of the entrepreneur qualitatively, while
evaluating venture proposals. Although these are mostly subjective assessments, it emphasizes the
importance of the entrepreneur in the creation and future behavior of the entrepreneurial firm.
Although resource based theories have led DEMO many researchers trying to identify correlates of
successful startups in terms of the financial and social capital of the entrepreneur, NVP models have
not been very successful in tracing the link between NVP and entrepreneurial human DEMO
This leads us to suggest that the operationalization of the entrepreneur as an empirical
construct may be one of the issues that leads to DEMO insignificant and inconsistent empirical linkage
between NVP and entrepreneurial human capital.
Recent researchers have tried to identify predictors of success for new ventures, which
typically link success/failure of these firms to certain initial or founding DEMO like the
entrepreneur’s background, the venture strategy, environmental considerations, or DEMO combination
of these (Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990). The unit of analysis in this branch of entrepreneurship studies
is the organization, and these studies have largely been conducted by researchers in strategic and
entrepreneurial management. DEMO variables that have been researched for effect on NVP can be
broadly listed as (i) The Entrepreneur, (ii) New Venture Strategy, (iii) The Environment, (iv)
Industry Structure, and (v) DEMO structure. However, NVP research has suffered from the
following limitations:
DEMO the entrepreneur is widely accepted to be an important element in a model of NVP,
much of the research trying to find a DEMO between the individual entrepreneur and the performance
of the venture has focused on specific entrepreneurial “traits”, which has turned up results that are
inconclusive or insignificant. Trait research, or studies attempting to explore links between
entrepreneurial traits and organizational outcomes, can at best make conclusions about the particular
traits under study.
These inconclusive results of entrepreneurial trait research led some DEMO to drop the
entrepreneur from their models. However, this is not DEMO with theory or with anecdotal
evidence, which points to important effects DEMO the entrepreneur on small and young firms (Miller,
1983; Sandberg and Hofer, 1987). Moreover, the use of combinations such as DEMO and Industry
structure to explain performance fails to take into account the effect of entrepreneurial human
capital. The inclusion of the Entrepreneur in NVP DEMO is what distinguishes entrepreneurship
research from mainstream organizational behavior, and dropping DEMO adds little to the already existing
body of knowledge.
Although Gartner (DEMO) pointed out that there may be different types of entrepreneurs, there
are no widely accepted, consistently defined typologies. Operationalizations of the entrepreneurial
construct have been weak and inconsistent.
It is also suggested that this may DEMO because of the failure on the part of most researchers to
consider mediation paths and moderating variables like skills, motivations and strategy (Baum,DEMO
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13 Number 1, 2007

1995; Herron and Robinson, 1993) rather than testing for direct effects of variables. This may have
led to results that are not DEMO significant. Models using interaction terms have been more successful
than those testing for direct effect of variables.
The Entrepreneur
Most research in the area DEMO entrepreneurship till as late as the mid and late '80s focused DEMO
the differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Researchers in this area tried to
distinguish the entrepreneur from the non-entrepreneur, based on psychological, sociological,
DEMO or educational characteristics (Hornaday, 1982; Brockhaus, 1980). Research in this
area examined the founder’s traits such as need for achievement, internal locus of control, or
tolerance for ambiguity, demographic variables like age, education and work experience, and
sociological variables like networks and contacts, DEMO background etc.
The results of empirical studies in this area produced mixed and inconclusive results
(Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990; Low and MacMillan, DEMO; Gartner, 1990). The assumption behind
studies differentiating between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs was that entrepreneurs were
more or less a homogeneous set. This DEMO was later addressed by Gartner (1985), who suggested
that differences DEMO entrepreneurs are more significant than their commonalities, and hence the
emphasis DEMO entrepreneurship research should shift towards studying variations among entrepreneurs
rather than between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.
Given that differences between entrepreneurs exist, it becomes important to study the causes
and effects of such diversity. Typically, the method adopted by researchers has been to group
entrepreneurs by some common, meaningful, characteristics (Woo, Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1991).
This serves as DEMO useful middle ground between the anecdotal style of treating every individual
entrepreneur as a unique case, and trying to generalize over a diverse group of entrepreneurs as a
whole. Following Gartner (1985)’s lead, there DEMO been a number of studies that try to differentiate
between types of entrepreneurs.
The earliest work in this area came from Smith (1967), who isolated two types of
entrepreneurs, based on their personal characteristics and work motivations. 'Craftsman'
entrepreneurs came from blue-collar backgrounds, relatively lower DEMO of education, and had been
associated with operations rather than management DEMO the past. In running their firms, they were
typically paternalistic, used personal finances or relatives and friends for financing, used personal
relationships in marketing, and adopted rigid strategies. 'Opportunistic' entrepreneurs, on the other
DEMO, had middle class backgrounds, were more educated, had a greater DEMO of work experience,
and had some past experience with management. They were more aware of and sensitive to the
market, and better oriented towards spotting opportunities and growth. Their management style was
more professional, they delegated more, looked for more financing options, adopted more innovative
competitive DEMO, and led adaptive and faster growing firms.

Other researchers have tried to build upon Smith’s (1967) craftsman-opportunistic DEMO
(Filley and Aldag, 1978; Smith and Miner, 1983; Cooper DEMO Dunkelberg, 1986, Lafuente and Salas,
1989). Broadly, three DEMO of entrepreneurs have been identified, 1) the craftsman entrepreneurs,
who are strongly motivated to do what they enjoy doing, and value their independence, 2)
managerial entrepreneurs, who are motivated by economic gain DEMO building an organization, and are
more concerned with administrative details and DEMO systems, and 3) opportunistic entrepreneurs
who can exploit the market conditions by spotting a particular need (Smith, 1967; Smith and Miner,
1983; Lafuente and Salas, 1989; Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1986; Woo, Cooper and Dunkelberg,
1991).
Further studies by Filley and Aldag (1978), Cooper and Dunkelberg (1986), and Lafuente
and Salas (1989) have also identified different types of entrepreneurs based on different sets of
initial classificatory variables like education, previous work experience, the process DEMO ownership,
work expectations etc, and related these classification variables to DEMO rates or type of firm
created.
As Gartner (1985) pointed out, there are significant variations among entrepreneurs and the
firms they create. Smith (1967) found opportunistic entrepreneurs’ chances for survival and growth
to be DEMO than that of craftsman entrepreneurs. Carland et al (1984) differentiated between
entrepreneurs and small business owners based on the firm's growth orientation. DEMO (1987) has
discussed two types of small firms, income substitutors DEMO entrepreneurs, and noted the difference
in growth orientation between them. Westhead DEMO Wright (1988) have distinguished between
novice, portfolio, and serial entrepreneurs, based on the entrepreneur’s experience in new venture
creation, and conclude DEMO portfolio and serial entrepreneurs are significantly associated with higher
job creation rates.
LIMITATIONS OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA
The operationalization of the entrepreneur as DEMO construct has been inconsistent. Either
personality, personal characteristics, or motivations have been used in isolation, often without
conceptual or theoretical explanations of why they have been used. This has led to lack of
generalization across DEMO studies. Most of these studies have not been able to report significant
association between the entrepreneur, and growth or performance of the venture. One reason for this
could be that the basis for categorization is by DEMO not enough to serve as a strong predictor of
behavior in new ventures.
Although many studies have assumed, a priori, the presence of DEMO craftsman-opportunistic
dimension among entrepreneurs, few researchers have tried to validate the DEMO empirically.
While Woo, Cooper, and Dunkelberg (1991) have suggested that a two-way classification may not
be wide enough to describe a varied DEMO of entrepreneurs, there have been few empirical tests
for a wider DEMO more clearly defined typology.
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13 Number DEMO, 2007

Even when an empirical verification has been attempted, the variables used for classifying
entrepreneurs have been different. For example, Lafuente and Salas (DEMO) have used only work
motivations to classify entrepreneurs, while Smith’s (DEMO) original classification was based on the
background, education, training as DEMO as attitude to work. This has led to lack of clarity at the
construct level, leading to lack of generalizability across research findings.
Although skills of an entrepreneur have implicitly been part of Smith’s original definition,DEMO
it has not explicitly been used to differentiate between entrepreneurs.
A SYNTHESIS
Entrepreneurs create new ventures for a variety of reasons, and satisfying a variety of
personal objectives. Motivational structures will be very different for the DEMO who wants
challenging work, and for one who chooses self employment DEMO "a more desirable form of earning
a living" (Chell, Haworth, and Brearley, 1991). This is expected to have a significant DEMO on the
behavior of the entrepreneur, and hence the future performance DEMO the ventures created by them.
Kolvereid (1991, cited in Gundry and Welsch, 1997) found that higher levels of growth aspirations
were related DEMO entrepreneurs who started businesses as a means of personal achievement. Similarly,
Amit and Muller (1996) found that “Pull” entrepreneurs had significantly higher DEMO of success
than “Push” entrepreneurs. Thus, reasons for starting a business DEMO be related to the growth
orientation of the entrepreneur.
Moreover, although DEMO is a situational phenomenon, combinations of
circumstances cannot create a new DEMO by themselves. The entrepreneur as an individual has to
employ his own skills to "shape a new organization out of complexity and chaos" (Herron, 1990,
quoted in Herron and Sapienza, 1992: 50). Entrepreneurs come from different social backgrounds,
have varied education, training and work experience, all of which result in the development of
different skill sets. These differences may impact their decisions and be another source of DEMO
between the ventures they create.
Moreover, it is suggested that personality DEMO manifested in knowledge, skill and ability
(Baum, 1995). Herron DEMO Robinson (1993) conceptualize 'skills' as a function of aptitude and
training. Hence, skill sets of entrepreneurs will capture the effect of the knowledge and abilities
acquired by them through their education, training and work experience.
One of the major problems with entrepreneurship research is that mediating DEMO moderating
paths between variables have often not been examined (Herron and DEMO, 1993). Studies which
have tried to link personality traits and DEMO demographic characteristics of the entrepreneur directly
to outcomes, instead of testing DEMO sets of relationships, have not reported significant
findings. Baum (1995) DEMO that the limited effect of entrepreneurial personality on performance
may be explained by analysis of mediation paths through competencies, motivation, strategy, and
structure. Herron and Robinson (1993) suggest that personality traits do not have DEMO strong direct
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13, Number 1, DEMO
7
effect on behavior and performance, but are mediated by motivations and moderated by abilities,
or skills of the entrepreneur. This is consistent DEMO literature on psychological job testing which
suggests that the relationship between traits and performance is not a direct one, but is moderated
and mediated by other variables (Herron and Robinson, 1990).
Thus, personality, DEMO and experience of the entrepreneur, which are used more often
in DEMO research, may not have a direct impact on organizational  outcomes, DEMO may be
mediated by a combination of skills and motivations.
Gartner, DEMO, Gatewood and Katz (1994) advocate the use of a combination DEMO work
ability and motivation to capture the effect of the entrepreneur on the performance of his venture.
They suggest the use of measures of DEMO knowledge and skills rather than general measures like
number of years of experience in industry or number of years of education. Although Smith’s (1967)
early categorization of entrepreneurial types implicitly included skill dimensions, no other empirical
study has explicitly incorporated the skills of individual entrepreneurs in defining DEMO typology. Thus,
a combination of motivations and abilities of individuals may yield a more robust basis for
differentiating between types of entrepreneurs.
Many DEMO have studied the associations between the characteristics of senior
managers and the strategies they adopt (Miller and Toulouse, 1986; Miller, Kets de DEMO, 1982;
Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
The upper echelon theory propounded by Hambrick and Mason (1984) suggests that the
choices made DEMO executives are representative of the characteristics of its managers. Managers take
decisions based on their interpretation of the objective environment, and their own values and
experiences. Bamberger (1983, cited in Kotey and Meredith, 1997) DEMO further by stating that
business strategies are products of managers' visions DEMO in turn originate from their personalities.
After the initial decision to launch a new venture, the entrepreneur is faced with many other
decisions about the nature of industry, nature of entry, competitive strategies and operational
DEMO Considering that in small businesses, the owner's goals "become intricately entwined with
the strategies of the business" (Chaganti, DeCarolis, Deeds, 1995: 9), it may be expected that the
entrepreneur would take strategic decisions based on how he perceives the environment through the
lens DEMO his own beliefs, values and attitudes (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992)DEMO Moreover, strategies are
particularly likely to reflect the orientations and priorities DEMO the founder in small and new ventures
(Kisfalvi, 2002). Thus it can be expected that the strategic decisions taken, and hence the early
strategies adopted by the entrepreneurial firm will be related to the DEMO of entrepreneur who makes
those decisions. Specifically, using the arguments above, these decisions will be associated with the
entrepreneurial skill-motivation sets.
Feeser and DEMO's (1990) research studies the effect of founding strategies on performance.
The researchers have defined founding strategies to include the characteristics and experiences DEMO
the entrepreneurs, as well as the decisions taken by them regarding DEMO, technologies, and
competitive postures. Moreover, Timmons, Smollen, and Dingee (1977) advocate the need for
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13 DEMO 1, 2007
8
different sets of skills for different types of entrepreneurial ventures. Keeping DEMO mind that the
entrepreneur as an individual is one of the most important assets of the new venture, a combination
of the entrepreneur's skills and motivations, and the resource allocation decisions he makes, may
DEMO implications for the growth and performance of the firm. Hence both the entrepreneur and the
strategy of the venture may have implications for performance.
DEMO, Litschert and Ramaswamy (1991) point out that if the argument DEMO managerial
characteristics are associated with strategic decisions is true, then a DEMO or congruence between
the two must have performance implications. They argue that absence of this alignment would result
in a "conflict between the distinctive competencies of the organization and managerial decisions…
(leading to) suboptimal resource DEMO, failure to build on organizational strengths, and a lack
of clear direction, all of which would have a negative impact on performance" (Thomas, Litschert
and Ramaswamy, 1991, p 511). Naman and Slevin (1993) argue that fit implies 'efficient allocation
of managerial resources', and hence misfit would be associated with inefficiency. Govindarajan
(1989) presents DEMO following rationale for matching managers to strategies:
‚ A different set of behavior, knowledge and skills will be effective in different
strategies.
‚ Mangers may have different sets of behavior, knowledge and skills based on their
personalities, background, education, experience etc.
‚ Managers can change their styles, but to a limited degree only. Managers whose
behavior, knowledge DEMO skill sets are congruent with the requirements of the
particular strategies will be more effective than others (: 252).
Many studies have attempted to find a link between the entrepreneurial human capital (i.e.,
the knowledge, skills and abilities of the entrepreneur), and the new venture performance
(Ucbasaran, Westhead and Wright, 2001). However, resource based DEMO of organization
recognize that resources alone cannot generate sustainable competitive advantage, DEMO hence
entrepreneurs must select strategies that best exploit the resources that they have access to
(Ucbasaran, Westhead and Wright, 2001). Chandler and Hanks (1994) suggest that a fit between the
available resources and DEMO venture strategy should enhance performance of the venture. Hence the
alignment of the characteristics of the entrepreneur to the requirements of the strategy will DEMO
implications for the performance of the new venture.
From the above arguments it may be concluded that:
‚ Founders can have a significant DEMO on organizational outcomes.
‚ Certain organizational decisions may be associated with certain entrepreneurial
characteristics.

‚
The skill-motivation combination of the entrepreneur, as well as the strategic
decisions taken by the entrepreneur, may have associations with NVP.
Congruence or alignment of entrepreneurial characteristics with the requirements of
the strategy DEMO lead to effectiveness of the venture.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Figure 1 represents the conceptual model for the framework suggested above.
Research Questions and Propositions
The DEMO outlined earlier generated the following research questions:
1. Are certain combinations of skills and motivations associated with certain
entrepreneurial "types"?
2. DEMO these skill-motivation sets associated with certain competitive strategy
decisions taken by entrepreneurs?
3. Does the entrepreneur-strategy alignment lead to higher performance?
An DEMO of the entrepreneur as a combination of his skills and motivations has
not been attempted in earlier studies. Hence the first part of the DEMO is exploratory in nature, and
the propositions will reflect the exploratory DEMO in that they will state the relationships that are
expected to be found, based on constructs and dimensions from previous literature.

Based on earlier research on the subject (Smith, 1967; Smith and Miner, 1983; Filley and
Aldag, 1978; Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1984), the following types of entrepreneurs can be defined:
The 'craftsman' entrepreneur is likely to be technically skilled and his primary entrepreneurial
motivation would be the need to enjoy freedom at work, and a desire for independence. In today's
context, the software engineer who branches out on his own to indulge his creative skills and do his
DEMO the way he wants to, can be described as a craftsman DEMO It seems intuitively
probable that he would like technical jobs and dislike administrative ones, would rate comfort-
survival higher than growth-profitability, and enjoy DEMO challenging work.
The managerial/administrative entrepreneur is likely to possess excellent conceptual skills
and a welfare-growth orientation. Such an entrepreneur would be interested in DEMO and the
opportunity to 'build' an organization. He is likely to be a non-technical administrator, preferring to
expend his energies in planning and organizing. Growth orientation may be highest for organizations
created by this kind DEMO entrepreneur.
The opportunistic/promoter/risk entrepreneur would have strong networking/ opportunity
DEMO and a profitability orientation. His reason for starting a business would be the ability to spot
an attractive market or opportunity more easily than DEMO He would be likely to have a relatively
shorter planning time frame, use marketing techniques rather than product innovations, and be
oriented towards DEMO rather than growth.
From earlier research on skills (Katz, 1974, DEMO and Lau, 1983; Szilyagi and Schweiger,
1984, Herron and DEMO,1990; Baum,1995; Chandler and Jansen, 1992) and motivations of an
entrepreneur (Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1986; Amit and Mueller, 1996; Birley and Westhead, 1994;
Scheinberg and MacMillan,1988;  Shane, DEMO and Westhead, 1991), the following patterns
of entrepreneurial skills and DEMO are proposed in Table 1.
Proposition 1: A combination of skills DEMO motivations of
entrepreneurs will yield certain patterns of
skill-motivation sets which will define a
typology of entrepreneurs.
As argued earlier, the strategic decisions taken by entrepreneurs are likely to be associated
with entrepreneurial characteristics.
The craftsman DEMO is likely to have a high level of technical knowledge and skill
in his focus area. A combination of high need for independence and DEMO skills is likely to make
him break away from his previous employment to start a business in a closely related area. His high
need DEMO personal development, as well as his expertise would give him a DEMO technical orientation
and product focus. He would be comfortable with using sophisticated tools and techniques to
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13, Number DEMO, 2007
11
differentiate his product. Since he is not driven by growth or DEMO motivations, his business strategy
would more likely be differentiation or focus DEMO not an expansion oriented, undifferentiated one.
He is unlikely to have DEMO human and conceptual skills and hence would be more product than
marketing oriented. Using Carter et al.’s (1994) classification of new venture strategies, craftsman
entrepreneurs could be associated with Technology Value strategies.

With a high level of conceptual and administration skills, a managerial DEMO would
be most likely to pursue an undifferentiated strategy, driven by DEMO rather than profitability
motivations. His strong conceptual skills and knowledge of the business and industry would allow
him to have a product as well DEMO a marketing focus. Hence managerial entrepreneurs may be
associated with ventures following Quality Proponent / Super Achiever strategies (Carter et al.,
1994).
An opportunistic entrepreneur would have the ability to take advantage of environmental
DEMO Therefore he is more likely to spot niche markets. He is also likely to use innovative
marketing practices rather than product superiority. His strong DEMO skills would allow him
to understand the needs of his target markets and tailor his product/service to these needs. Thus
opportunistic entrepreneurs may DEMO associated with Niche purveyor / Price Competitor strategies
(Carter et al., 1994). Hence, the following proposition can be formulated regarding the association
of entrepreneurial skill-motivation sets and competitive strategy of the venture.
Academy of DEMO Journal, Volume 13 Number 1, 2007

Proposition 2: New ventures with dissimilar competitive strategies will be
associated with founders possessing different skill-motivation
sets.
Consistent with findings from earlier research (Smith, 1967; Filley and Aldag, 1978;
Lafuente and Salas, DEMO; Westhead and Wright, 1998), it can also be expected to find performance
differences across types of entrepreneurs.
Craftsman entrepreneurs have been associated DEMO comfort-survival motivations rather than
growth and profitability (Smith, 1967; Smith DEMO Miner, 1983). Opportunistic entrepreneurs,
associated with desire for financial DEMO, are likely to be associated with higher profitability, and
managerial entrepreneurs, who are associated with a desire to build, are likely to DEMO associated with
higher growth (Filley and Aldag, 1978; Smith, 1967). Hence we may expect to find different
performance orientations among ventures DEMO by entrepreneurs with different skill-motivation
sets
Proposition 3:  Skill-motivation sets of entrepreneurs will be associated with
different levels of performance.
Similarly, new venture strategy literature (Macmillan and Day, 1986; Sandberg and Hofer,
1987; Birley and Westhead, 1990) suggests that there may exist an association between new venture
strategy and performance.
Proposition 4: New ventures with dissimilar competitive strategies will be
associated with different levels of performance.
The argument DEMO matching entrepreneurial characteristics with the requirements of the
strategy for effectiveness of the venture has been presented earlier. A closer look at the strategy
DEMO established by Carter et al (1994) shows us that:
Super achievers try to exploit all the competitive postures identified, by
offering quality products and services at reasonable prices, and trying to retain
flexibility and responsiveness to the market. Hence a broader view of the
organization and DEMO elements, or administrative skills may be required for this kind
Academy DEMO Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13, Number 1, 2007
of strategy. Skills like business and industry knowledge will be needed to DEMO
customer needs and ensure quick responses to changes in the market. Internal skills
like leadership and administrative skills will also be needed to integrate DEMO areas
of operation like production, customer service etc. Hence we can DEMO that a
managerial/ administrative type of entrepreneur to be most successful DEMO this kind of
strategy.
Technology Value firms use innovative or new technology or a price
competitive product as a differentiator. Carter et al (1994) suggest that this strategy
seems likely for entrepreneur who have previously been employed in related
industries and have hence been able to successfully transfer DEMO knowledge and
skills into the new venture. It seems fairly clear that technical knowledge of the
product/service will be essential skills for this DEMO in order to be able to offer leading
edge technology. The craftsman entrepreneur who is motivated by technical work
and uses his technical skills DEMO excel at his work may be most likely to outperform
others using this strategy.
Niche Purveyors emphasize unique products and services for their identified
DEMO, and couple this with convenience value, locational advantages etc to create
value for their customers. Since this type of strategy demands opportunity
recognition DEMO, the opportunistic entrepreneur is likely to be a niche player.
However, the craftsman entrepreneur could also be a niche player if his
product/DEMO is specialized and aimed at a narrow target market. This type of
strategy would need a strong customer orientation and relationship management with
the DEMO market segment. Thus we expect opportunistic entrepreneurs to be more
successful in this kind of strategy. Moreover, we also see that a lack of market
responsiveness is also a feature of this kind of strategy. As DEMO
entrepreneurs are more likely to be responsive to changing market conditions than
other types, we would expect them to perform better than the other types adopting
this strategy.
Quality proponents rely on the quality of their DEMO, superior service and
better technology. The required skills would include both DEMO product/service
skills as well as leadership and business skills to ensure that the organization as a
whole is oriented towards quality. Moreover, there is a strong element of service in
the value offering in this DEMO of strategy. Craftsman entrepreneurs can be expected
to be less service oriented and hence we may expect managerial entrepreneurs to
perform better.
Price competitors DEMO a combination of marketing/advertising, service and
low price. This needs DEMO of the industry, and good networking skills.
Moreover, a price competitive strategy by definition is a short term strategy. As the
13
Academy DEMO Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13 Number 1, 2007
14
opportunistic entrepreneur is likely to be more marketing oriented than product
DEMO, and would be motivated by short term profits, we would expect this type
to perform better.
Equivocators adopt ambiguous strategies where they fail DEMO emphasize any
of the strategy dimensions mentioned. Given the lack of a coherent strategic
orientation, we expect opportunistic entrepreneurs, who are strongly motivated DEMO
short term results and personal achievement rather than long term growth plans, to
perform best in this strategy type.
From the arguments above, DEMO may expect that “fit” between the entrepreneur and the
strategy of the new venture will have performance implications for the venture.
Proposition 5: New ventures where the type of entrepreneur is aligned with
the requirements of DEMO strategy will perform better than
ventures where such an alignment does not exist.
Research Framework and Suggested Methodology
The model is of the form DEMO = f (E, S, E x S), where
E DEMO Type of Entrepreneur
S = Type of Strategy, and
E x DEMO defines the interaction term.
The variables under consideration are the Entrepreneur (DEMO), New Venture Strategy (S), and
New Venture Performance (NVP). The entrepreneur as an empirical construct is operationalized by
a combination DEMO skills and motivations. Multidimensional scales can be used to measure skills and
motivations. Clustering methods may be used to identify specific skill-motivation sets. This DEMO
empirically validate the craftsman-opportunistic-managerial typology. It is expected that personality,
background, experience etc will not have direct effect on performance, but will DEMO mediated by skills
and motivations, and moderated by strategy.
The typology DEMO is expected to impact strategic decisions as well as the performance
of new ventures. Moreover, the type of entrepreneur and strategy are expected to have weak direct
effects on NVP, and the interaction term is expected to have a strong effect. Contextual variables
like Environment and Industry Structure DEMO assumed to be controlled for.

Analysis Plan
15
The first part of this study attempts an operationalization DEMO the type of entrepreneur, based
on skills and motivations. Skills and DEMO can be identified from literature and
operationalized into a multidimensional questionnaire. Since the initial objective is to reduce and
summarize the data collected on DEMO and motivations to a smaller number of common dimensions,
the first step in the process will be Factor Analysis. Skills and motivations can DEMO factor analyzed
separately using an R-mode Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the items into a smaller
number of independent orthogonal components. PCA DEMO to be used since the component scores are
to be further used in a clustering technique which is sensitive to intercorrelations (Green and Tull,
1990). Although the dimensions of skills and motivations can be DEMO through factor analysis,
the objective of the research is to examine the “combinations” of these that actually exist. As has
already been argued, entrepreneurs are a heterogeneous group in terms of their skill-motivation sets,
DEMO the attempt here is to identify homogeneous subgroups within a heterogeneous sample. Everitt
(1980) recommends the use of cluster analysis under these circumstances.
DEMO factor scores obtained from the earlier factor analysis can be used as inputs for the
subsequent cluster analysis to identify entrepreneurial "types". It is expected that the cluster analysis
would yield clusters similar to the DEMO types defined in literature.
The methodology has the disadvantage of a loss of detail, but makes up for it by helping
generalization (Birley DEMO Westhead, 1994). Moreover, given the exploratory nature of this research,
the use of this method is useful in constructing “mid-range theories” (Pinder and Moore, 1979),
which help in the process of DEMO building.
The study then proposes to test whether the competitive strategy choices made by the
entrepreneur differ systematically with the "type" of entrepreneur. DEMO is consistent with researchers
in organization behavior who study associations between managers and strategy (Miller, Kets de
Vries and Toulouse, 1982). Unlike in larger organizations, causality is not complicated by the
possibility of executives being chosen for a particular position because of their personal and
background DEMO (Hambrick and Mason, 1984), and any association between
entrepreneurial characteristics and strategy can be assumed to be directional. Moreover, by using
cluster analysis, strategy is treated as a multidimensional construct which reflects the differential
emphasis that each firm places on each dimension of competitive strategy. The DEMO can be
tested using contingency coefficients, as both the data are DEMO data, and hence nominal in
nature. Other nonparametric tests available for DEMO between nominal data eg. Phi and
Cramer’s V can also be used.
The last part of the study then proposes to examine the performance DEMO of a
strategy-entrepreneur matching relationship. Since the use of mediating and moderating variables
is recommended rather than examining direct effects of variables, and models incorporating
interaction terms have generally been found superior in explaining NVP(Sandberg DEMO Hofer, 1987),
Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13 Number DEMO, 2007
16
it is expected that the interaction between type of entrepreneur and DEMO of strategy would have
performance implications.
Controlling for industry, it is DEMO that NVP = f (E, S, E x S), DEMO NVP = New venture
performance, E = Type of entrepreneur, S = Type of strategy, E x S = Interaction term. It is proposed
that E and S will have independent weak effects on performance, and the interaction term will have
a strong effect. This can be DEMO by using a set of 'matching' hypotheses, which test the DEMO
that “fit” between type of entrepreneur and type of strategy would have association with the
performance of the new venture. These propositions could be DEMO using non-parametric statistical
tools. The framework for the analysis is presented in Figure 2.
Implications of the Model
The model derived here has important DEMO for entrepreneurship researchers,
practicing entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists.
The model DEMO in the paper integrates research on the individual entrepreneur and the
performance of the venture in an attempt to find the elusive link between DEMO two streams of research
in this area.
Firstly, the operationalization of DEMO entrepreneur as a combination of his skills and
motivations has not been attempted earlier. Although the choice of variables for categorization is
strongly grounded DEMO theory, no empirical research has been carried out with this operationalization.
DEMO of Entrepreneurship Journal, Volume 13, Number 1, 2007

Since the derivation is strongly grounded in theory, empirical testing of the model will validate the
existence of a typology that has been DEMO but not validated earlier.
The derivation of the model is based on strong theoretical antecedents deriving from areas
like psychological job testing, behavioral theories of organization, and strategic management
literature. It is supported by the fact that testing for direct effects of traits on outcomes has not
yielded DEMO results. A model using mediation and moderation paths of the relevant variables
is expected to have higher explanatory power. This could be a significant DEMO to the area
of research which has tried to identify which behavioral characteristics of the entrepreneur are
associated with success.
The new operationalization of DEMO entrepreneur could form the basis for a stable typology for
further empirical research, This would help the process of theory building in the area of
entrepreneurship, by allowing the comparison and generalizability of research findings.
Trying to determine which new ventures are likely to succeed has traditionally been DEMO
challenging problem for venture capitalists. When a venture capitalist is approached by an
entrepreneur for financing his venture, he often faces the problem of adverse selection (Amit and
Muller, 1996). Since venture capitalists do DEMO to evaluate the ability of the entrepreneur by trying
to assess certain traits and behavioral characteristics of the entrepreneur (Sandberg and Hofer, 1987;DEMO
Amit and Muller, 1996), they are hampered in this evaluation DEMO the absence of any clear theory
which predicts which characteristics will increase chance of success. The subjective assessments and
psychological or trait measures used DEMO venture capitalists to assess entrepreneurial capabilities may
be replaced by instruments measuring actual skills and motivations of the individual entrepreneur.
As explained earlier, traits may not have direct effects on outcomes, but may rather be mediated by
a combination of the entrepreneur’s skill-motivation set, which capture the effects of personality
traits as well as other commonly tested variables like education, background and work experience.
Any government policy to encourage employment growth by DEMO new venture creation has
to take into account differing attitudes, managerial DEMO, and hence, varying incubation needs of
different types of entrepreneurs (DEMO and Salas, 1989).
Finally, based on the finding that certain types of entrepreneurs outperform others, founders
and potential founders should analyze their own skills and motivations. Knowing which behavioral
aspects are linked to performance DEMO help them either to supplement their skills in certain areas,
or balance their own shortcomings with a complementary founding team.
