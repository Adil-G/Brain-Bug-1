Previous studies of venture capital investment criteria, which have tended
EXECUTIVE to utilize traditional Likert-scaled survey methods, have produced some
SUMMARY general findings which indicate that the "DEMO" is of utmost impor-
tance. However, virtually all of these studies have been undertaken with
U.S. -based venture capitalists. In addition, the studies have generally been
exploratory and have assumed a single hierarchy of decision DEMO in all
cases and across all venture capitalists. We do not accept that this is valid; therefore, our study tested
this assumption by DEMO the trade-offs made by venture capitalists in Europe.
Thirty-five investment criteria were identified from the literature andfrom experts in the field, and
a questionnaire was developed that required the venture capitalist to make 53 pairwise trade-offs DEMO
multiple levels. Seventy-three venture capitalists from across Europe were interviewed and completed
the questionnaire.
Conjoint analysis was used to compute relative rankings, and overall rankings were computed to
provide some general insight into the overall importance DEMO the various criteria. After this, cluster
analysis was used to identify DEMO decision groupings.
The trade-offs were randomized in the questionnaire but, for DEMO purposes, fall into the
following groupings: financial, product-market, strategic-competitive, DEMO, management team, man-
agement competence, and deal. Allfive management team DEMO (asopposedto managementcompetence
criteria) were ranked among the first seven, product-market DEMO appeared to be only moderately
important, and fund and deal criteria DEMO at the bottom of the rankings. Overall, we conclude that

the venture capitalists interviewed would, as a group, prefer to select an opportunity that offers a good
management team and reasonable financial and product-market characteristics, even if the opportunity
does not meet the overall fund and deal requirements. It appears, quite logically, DEMO without the correct
management team and a reasonable idea, goodfinancials are DEMO meaningless because they will
never be achieved.
Cluster analysis identified three groupings of venture capitalists: those primarily concerned with
investing nationally, those who DEMO solely upon the deal, and those mainstream investors who consis-
tently DEMO instinctively rank the five management team criteria at the top of their list. However, there
was no evident country bias -a conclusion that is sustained if the countries are grouped by physical
proximity (northern versus southern Europe) or by size ofthe local venture capital community, a surrogate
DEMO experience. Moreover, there was no relationship to the scale of the DEMO, the typical round of
financing, or the apparent network. The article concludes by outlining the implications of the study for
venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and the research community.
INTRODUCTION
By their very nature, new ventures DEMO high levels of risk for those involved. Moreover,
the more complex the business and the larger the levels of investment required, the greater
the chances of failure are likely to be. Yet it is in DEMO circumstances that entrepreneurs are
less likely to be able to fund the business from their own or their family resources. As a
result, they seek external investors, usually from within the venture capital community. Here,
the people with whom they are dealing are unlikely to be able DEMO draw upon personal knowledge
of the entrepreneurial team or upon the business track record and so must rely on other criteria
to inform their DEMO
Several studies of venture capital investment criteria have been conducted previously,
often utilizing traditional Likert-scaled survey methods. They have produced some general
findings DEMO indicate that the human factor is of utmost importance. However, virtually
DEMO of these studies have been undertaken with U.S.-based venture capitalists. In addition,
they have generally been exploratory and have assumed a single hierarchy DEMO decision criteria
in all cases and across all venture capitalists. We do not accept that this is valid; therefore,
this research tests this assumption by investigating the trade-oft's made by venture capitalists
in Europe.
DEMO RESEARCH
Zopounidis (1994) provides a useful summary of the previous research in this field. He
divides the studies into three categories: descriptive methods, evaluation using linear statistical
methods (primarily regression and discriminant analysis), DEMO multicriteria evaluation. Inter-
estingly, this categorization clearly demonstrates the evolving nature DEMO the research. Thus,
the earliest of the first wave of descriptive studies (Wells 1974) attempted to ascertain a
posteriori criteria that discriminated DEMO ventures on the basis of their eventual success.
Subsequent studies, conducted DEMO 1973 and 1991, have sought to ascertain the relative
importance of DEMO criteria through some form of counting (Benoit 1975; Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984), rating scale (Wells 1974; Dixon 1991), or ranking DEMO (Poindexter 1976;
MacMillan et al. 1985). Zopounidis (1994) DEMO thatthere is "great diversity of evaluation
criteria and their relative importance DEMO one study to another. . ." although "the criterion
of the managementteam is considered predominant. . ." (p. 63). On reflection, this conclusion
is not particularly surprising to these researchers for two very DEMO reasons. First, the
industry has changed significantly over the period in DEMO of its sophistication and experience
INVESTMENT TRADE-OFFS FOR EUROPEAN VENTURE CAPITALISTS 275
base and in terms on DEMO economic environment within which investments have been made.
Second, even were DEMO two circumstances held constant, it is likely that there would be
DEMO in ranking of criteria between venture capital firms as a result of their market
positioning.
Two studies best illustrate the second wave of linear DEMO Interestingly, both emanate
from researchers in the first wave. Thus, MacMillan et al. (1987) used multiple regression
to predict the success of DEMO 150 ventures evaluated by 67 American venture capitalists. More
important from the perspective of this research, factor analysis of their data identified five
groups of criteria which they concluded refer to five types of risk: management risk, investment
risk, competitive threats, viability risk, and cashout risk. DEMO, in the second of their
studies, Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) also constructed five similar groups of criteria using factor
analysis: managerial capabilities, market attractiveness, product differentiation, environmen-
tal threat, and cashout potential-and DEMO regression analysis to show their apparent inter-
dependence.
These early studies provided some generally useful ranking of the relative importance
of various decision factors DEMO from scaling methodologies. However, almost all have
the inherent limitations of DEMO in that there are inevitable differences in discrimination
between what is considered important. So, for example, for some respondents, a 3 on as-point
scale indicates a lower degree of importance, whereas for others, only DEMO 1 truly indicates
something of lesser importance. The later two venture capital studies, which attempt to rectify
these problems, were conducted outside the DEMO States. Zopounidis (1994) cites a previous
study of his own (DEMO and Zopounidis 1987), which produced an automatic evaluation
model of firms for two French venture capital firms. They report the use of MINORA, a
computerized system that uses iterative trial and error to model evaluation DEMO and which
he suggests could be adapted to express the preferences, DEMO, experiences, andjudg-
ments of French venture capitalists. The article by Riquelme and Rickards (1992) in the
United Kingdom was first published during DEMO course of our research. They studied several
methods for identifying decision criteria and arrived at our same conclusions: perhaps a new
methodology could provide a clearer understanding of the trade-offs which usually apply to
venture capital DEMO criteria. They suggest the use of conjoint analysis, the technique
we DEMO chosen for our basic methodology.
RESEARCH ISSUES
The primary purpose of the study was to address the need for further information on venture
capital DEMO criteria in Europe and to attempt to identify national differences.
Thus, DEMO research questions used were:
• What are the key factors used by European venture capitalists in evaluating potential
investments?
• Are the DEMO consistently applied by venture capitalists throughout Europe?
• Are there any clusters or groupings of venture capitalists based on the decision criteria
applied?DEMO
At the outset, we hypothesized that, given the development of formalized venture capital
funds in Europe following the development in the United States, and the connections that
U.S. funds had in Europe, it was likely that the criteria applied by venture capitalists in the
United States, as reported in the literature, would be similar to the criteria applied in Europe.
276
D. MUZYKA ET AL.
In effect, we believed that it would be most important to have the correct team rather than
the most DEMO initial financial forecasts. In addition, given the pervasive influence of
U.S. DEMO models and the comparatively recent development of this source of funding,
we hypothesized that the decision models would not vary significantly by country.
DEMO DESIGN
Analytical Model
The primary issue when designing the study was the choice of methodology. We wished to
move beyond presenting the venture capitalists DEMO a "laundry list" of criteria contained in
a Likert-scaled survey with the resultant problems noted earlier. Therefore, we decided to
use a methodology that has been applied elsewhere in both research and commerce to explore
DEMO decision models of individuals and groups. We used conjoint analysis (multidimensional
DEMO). It is a technique that has been applied very successfully in marketing research for
determining the relative importance of product and/or service DEMO (Green and Srinivasan
1978), and its reliability has been well DEMO
The choice of this analytical model more clearly determined the overall design, because
the objective ofthe conjoint analysis method is to measure quantitatively the relative importance
of a list of attributes set against each other. The DEMO, which has several variants, is based
on requesting the decision-maker to make a series of paired trade-offs determining which of
two given factors, all else being equal, is the more important. The results of this procedure
are then processed through an analytical model based on multiattribute utility DEMO
One of the variants used is the full profile approach. Here, DEMO respondent is asked to
look at a set of two objects containing a full range of attributes that describe each of the
objects. They DEMO then requested to determine which of the two objects is more desirable.
This results in the relative ranking of factors through a series of DEMO of such objects.
Rather than describing objects with a full set of criteria, a second technique involves
the trade-off between pairs of independent criteria. This approach, chosen for this study,
has strong advantages when dealing with a number of factors that are not environmentally
correlated. It also DEMO overall higher predictive validity with longer lists of factors (Green
and DEMO 1978).
Criteria
When utilizing conjoint analysis, it is most important DEMO be clear in the definition ofthe criteria
so that there is little ambiguity in the respondent's mind concerning the trade-offs they are
making. DEMO addition, given that the number of attributes is fixed a priori, it is important to
have a complete set of criteria so that DEMO of omission do not occur.
The research approach that we took involved several key stages. We culled the literature
to identify those criteria determined DEMO by research that were relevant to venture
capitalists in choosing investments. In addition, we conducted seven open-ended interviews
with venture capitalists to capture both their lists of criteria considered and the particular
language used. This process DEMO the 35 individual criteria listed in Table 1. For conve-
nience, DEMO are grouped within the following seven general categories. However, in view
DEMO the methodology adopted, it is important to be clear that this DEMO was constructed
ex-post the data collection in order to facilitate analysis and presentation of the results.

• Management team criteria related to the DEMO potential and track record of the
lead entrepreneur and the management team.
• Management competence criteria related to the competencies and/or capabilities of
DEMO management team in important functional areas.
• Deal criteria related to the stage and nature of the investment deal.
Using these 35 criteria and DEMO conjoint analysis software (Crittenden et al. 1989;
Muzyka et. al. DEMO), which was based on commonly utilized algorithms (Green and Srinivasan
DEMO), a preliminary questionnaire was developed that required the respondent to make 53
trade-offs between pairs of independent criteria. The specific algorithm applied attached DEMO
or gradations to the criteria. For example, the criterion "sensitivity to economic cycles" was
graded into high, medium, and low levels of sensitivity (see Table 1 for a full list of the
trade-off options). The questionnaire that resulted from this algorithm was a multiattribute,
DEMO, trade-off survey with multiple levels.
Pilot
The preliminary survey was tested DEMO a sample of five venture capitalists to determine whether
the language and the instructions were clear and whether the criteria represented a complete
list. DEMO surveys were conducted in person so that the respondents could be observed. No
additions or deletions occurred in the list of criteria as a DEMO of this process, although some
language describing the criteria was modified.
DEMO
Based on these modifications, a new questionnaire was generated. It was DEMO into
languages appropriate to the various groups of entrepreneurs to facilitate completion by the
venture capitalists and to preserve the general "sense" of DEMO criteria.
As noted previously, the survey was designed to be analyzed DEMO a multiattribute,
pairwise conjoint analysis algorithm. Two separate trade-off boxes were included on each
page and were presented to venture capitalists in random DEMO
In addition to the information provided in the trade-offs, various elements DEMO demographic
information were collected concerning the respondents and their funds.
Data Collection
As the methodology was different from that generally used in questionnaires, and also being
aware of the venture capital community's negative attitude toward DEMO, we decided to
allocate a significant time span for person-to-person interviews DEMO we were aware that
the questionnaire would take between 45 minutes and an hour to complete. We contacted the
chosen venture capitalists by telephone, solicited their general consent to participate in the
survey, and scheduled a time to visit them to deliver and describe the survey. At the DEMO,
we described the survey, its purpose, and how to complete it. We were careful to emphasize
that there were no tricks and DEMO tests for consistency. More important, we emphasized that
it was crucial DEMO they complete all the matrices or we would not be able to conduct the
analysis. In view of the fact that this is a DEMO that has not been used in this field before,
we include a copy of the instructions given to the respondents in Table 2.
DEMO were encouraged to begin filling out the questionnaire during the interview.
Most surveys were completed after the interview by the respondent and mailed or DEMO to us.

TABLE 2 Questionnaire Instructions. Each DEMO in this questionnaire is based upon a pair of criteria
that, DEMO to venture capitalists, are frequently used in evaluating their investments.
We DEMO like you to trade-off these criteria against each other in a ranking order from
1 to 9 (1 = first choice; 9 = DEMO choice)-for example, the relative importance of the
"leadership skills of the entrepreneur" versus the "time to break even" that is indicated in
the business plan. This combination produces a 3 X 3 matrix DEMO shown below. If the
combination you like best is, say, high leadership skills and low break even, you may
wish to put a "1~ indicating your first choice in the top left-hand comer. Please note that
this matrix should be completed in a way that corresponds with DEMO feelings regarding
the trade-offs involved.

Analysis
Survey data were transferred to the conjoint model to DEMO the relative rankings of the
investment decision criteria. These individual rankings were then averaged to determine
the overall ranking of the individual respondent criteria, providing some general insight into
the overall importance of the various investment DEMO criteria in the European context.
Rankings by individual were then correlated (DEMO rank-order correlation) to test
for similarity among respondents and as input DEMO an unweighted pairwise cluster analysis
algorithm. This cluster analysis would show whether any groupings of venture capitalists,
based on decision criteria, existed (DEMO et al. 1979).
Sample
Our research objective was to sample approximately 20% of venture capital funds within
Europe (60 surveys). In the event, we gathered 73 questionnaires, all of which were fully
completed. DEMO our design, we attempted to ensure a broad cross-section along the DEMO of
geographic distribution (most of the venture capitalists are located within DEMO countries in
Europe), round of investment (e.g., first round versus expansion capital), and scale of fund
(e.g., small "boutique" DEMO versus "mega" funds). We used the credibility of our networks
and personal contacts to gain access. As we received returns from more DEMO 90% of those
who initially agreed to participate, we feel comfortable DEMO we achieved our aim.
Table 3 shows the distribution of responses by country and is a reasonable reflection of
the comparative magnitude of venture DEMO provision in each country (Various European
Venture Capital Association Yearbooks).
DEMO
As a note to researchers, we would like to make it DEMO that within the European context,
survey research of this kind is very difficult (Birley et al. 1994). Unlike the United States,
where there is a relatively well-established tradition of providing information, no such tradition
exists within European countries, possibly with the exception of the United Kingdom. European
norms concerning privacy vary from country to country but are DEMO well established. In

addition, there is a general reluctance by any group to discuss what they may view as trade
secrets. Moreover, at this time, DEMO venture capitalists are somewhat burned out by
questionnaires mailed to them from the United States and by surveys which have recently
been conducted by DEMO institutes in Europe, including their own organization, the European
Venture Capital Association. This feeling of annoyance, particularly with comparatively
uninformed researchers, has DEMO been exacerbated by pressures generated by industry
concerns over venture capital returns and investment exit barriers.
We were aware from the outset that these DEMO would work against us in realizing our
sampling objectives, particularly as DEMO questionnaire required significant time and personal
concentration. However, we had only DEMO few refusals to participate in the study and no nonre-
sponse problems. Therefore, we would suggest that it is important in the European context
to be well informed in approaching the venture capitalists and to meet DEMO them personally,
as this denotes seriousness of effort. We were also told repeatedly that the novelty of our
questionnaire and analytical approach was DEMO reason people agreed to participate. Quite
simply, they enjoyed the exercise.
DEMO
Overall, the venture capitalists surveyed exhibited a great deal of consistency DEMO the relative
importance they attached to criteria considered in selection of investments. As part of the
analysis, we computed the Spearman rank-order correlation between each set of rankings.
The correlations ranged from 0.49 to 0.73. I DEMO also computed Kendall's coefficient of concor-
dance for the whole sample and the value of 0.28 is significant at a 5% level.

c An asterisk indicates below the DEMO
in each quintile of the overall rankings, and the first column DEMO Table 5 shows the individual

only moderately important; and the fund and deal criteria appear at the bottom of the rankings.
All five of DEMO management team criteria ranked were among the first seven, with the
282
D. MUZYKA ET AL.
leadership ability of the lead entrepreneur and DEMO the management team ranking first and
second, respectively. After this, the two most important criteria were: a product with an
ability to sustain a competitive market position and a team capable of delivering this in DEMO
marketplace. The financial criteria of "ability to cashout"(9), "DEMO rate of return"(1I),
and "time to break even"(12) demonstrate the urgency with which the venture capitalists view
their investments. By contrast, the issues around the nature of the potential deal, DEMO as the
"ability to syndicate"(31) and the "fit with the fund"(28), are clearly second-order issues in
Europe.
This is an important finding. Conventional wisdom within the European venture capital
community has DEMO that entrepreneurs should take care to seek and approach only those
funds that fit their business. Yet this analysis suggests that venture capitalists will DEMO
work with most deals, even ifthey do not fit particularly well DEMO the rest of their investment
portfolio or even if the nature of the financing (e.g., round of investment) is not appropriate
for the fund. The ability to syndicate the deal, the structure of the deal, and the scale of the
deal do not appear to make a lot of difference in initial screening. Possibly, the venture
capitalists feel these are unimportant or, alternatively, that they can find a way to DEMO
the deal to overcome such barriers. Clearly, these data suggest that DEMO priority for the venture
capitalist is a good business deal.
A second piece of conventional wisdom is that national location breeds differences in
the DEMO of opportunity and, therefore, the nature of investments. This is possibly due
to the fact that the European Venture Capital Association statistics show DEMO the great majority
of funds are raised and invested within a given country (European Venture Capital Association
Yearbooks). However, the results of DEMO study suggest that, whereas both fundraising and
investment have primarily occurred DEMO one country, this preliminary analysis suggests
that there is little in DEMO way venture capitalists perceive opportunity that would lead them to
be nationally biased in selecting their investments. As can be seen in Table 5, national location
of the product market and the location of the business DEMO to the location of the fund are
criteria ranked 24 and 35, respectively, when venture capitalists are asked to weigh these
criteria against DEMO rest. This is not, of course, to say that they are unimportant but rather
that they are apparently less salient to a large DEMO of investors. Indeed, as we will show
later, they are critical to a significant minority of our sample-a result that reinforces the
value DEMO the cluster analysis as an extension of the individual rankings analysis.
Overall, as we had expected, these results suggest that the venture capitalists DEMO
would, as a group, prefer to select an opportunity that offers a good management team and
reasonable financial and product-market characteristics, even if the opportunity does not meet
the overall fund and deal requirements. It DEMO, quite logically, that without the correct
management team and a reasonable idea, good financials are generally meaningless because
they will never be achieved.
Cluster Analysis
It is clear from the data presented in Table 5 DEMO, whereas there is some overall pattern to
the rankings of the DEMO, there is also clear variability. Moreover, the technique that we
adopted forced the respondents to make comparative judgments and was selected because we
DEMO that any overall pattern that emerged would mask different strategic approaches to
the investment decision that not all would conform to this "common pattern". Therefore, we
subjected the data to SPSS QUICK CLUSTER analysis as recommended by Hair et al. (1979)

who used DEMO procedure "particularly because of its value in linking between-group differences
with DEMO (background) characteristics of the evaluators" (p. 333).
There was no particular theoretical guidance from the literature as to the selection of
DEMO number of clusters, nor any technical constraints other than that it DEMO not be greater
than n/30 (Lehmann 1979). This would DEMO us to select two or three clusters. We ran the
analysis for two, three, and four clusters with virtually the same results for DEMO latter-two
large clusters and one or two very small clusters. Examining the characteristics of the members
of each cluster, it was clear that there was a clear group of four outliers that formed the base
of DEMO cluster. Accordingly, the three-cluster solution appeared to be the most appropriate
DEMO further analysis. The cluster mean values are shown in Table 5 along with the significance
levels when testing for differences between the mean values DEMO the clusters.
Common Criteria
The first important point to note from Table 5 is the high level of agreement among the venture
capitalists as DEMO the relative importance of many of the criteria. Thus, taking a DEMO % significance
level, there is no significant difference among the clusters DEMO 13 (37%) of the criteria listed,
and there is a significant difference at the 10% level for a further five (14%) DEMO the criteria.
This was not what we had expected. Interestingly, agreement DEMO to fall in the middle
and low rank of product-market criteria and financial criteria (Table 6). So, for example, all
agree that the "ability to cash out" is important, whereas market size, DEMO to economic
cycles, and seasonality of product-market are relatively unimportant.
Disputed DEMO
There is a third piece of conventional wisdom which states that venture capitalists invest
primarily in management, management, and management. Certainly, that was the indication
from the initial ranking. Moreover, we had expected this commonality of view to be sustained
during the cluster analysis. This proved not DEMO be the case. At a 10% level of significance,
there is disagreement about the relative importance of the top eight ranked criteria, including
the five management team criteria (Table 5). Interestingly, the track DEMO of the lead
entrepreneur is excluded if the 5 % significance level is used.
Clusters
The cluster descriptions are derived from examining the mean DEMO shown in Table 5. An
underlined score indicates a rank more than half a standard deviation away from the mean;
and a score DEMO an asterisk indicates that it is also above the mean (Openshaw DEMO).

Cluster 1, The National Investors
This group of 18 venture capitalists is less concerned than the rest about:
DEMO the time to break even
• the ability of the business to sustain a share competitive position
• recognized industry expertise in the team
DEMO the organizational/administrative capabilities of the team
However, they would appear DEMO prefer a national location where they can the more easily
interpret the nature and degree of competition. This is consistent with their greater concern
DEMO unclear assumptions and their focus on a particular, though not single, stage of invest-
ment.
Cluster 2, The Dealers
Overall, this group DEMO four venture capitalists is much less concerned about management
criteria than are their colleagues. Moreover, unclear assumptions do not appear to worry
them. However, although national location relative to fund location is important, their primary
DEMO appears to be on the characteristics of the deal, the fit DEMO their portfolio, and the time
to break even.
Cluster 3, The Mainstream Investors
By far the largest cluster is the group of 51 DEMO capitalists, which would also appear to
define general practice. Indeed, they fall close to the mean scores on all 35 criteria listed.
They DEMO conform to our previous description of conventional wisdom. When asked to make
trade-offs in their investment decisions, they consistently and instinctively rank the five
management team criteria at the top of their list followed by:
DEMO Sustained share competitive position
• Marketing/sales capability of the team
• Organizational/administrative capabilities of the team
• Ability to cash out
• DEMO of product/market understanding
This is not to suggest that product/market criteria are unimportant but rather that a good
management team can lift DEMO mediocre product, but an indifferent management team is less
likely to DEMO able to cope with a strong product. This is intuitively acceptable to these researchers.
Clearly, the question that follows from this analysis is whether these clusters have some
relation to locational or fund characteristics, particularly in view of our cluster of national
investors. Interestingly, this would appear not to be the case. There is no country bias, a
conclusion that is sustained if the countries are grouped by physical proximity (northern versus
southern Europe) or by size ofthe local venture capital community, a DEMO for experience.
With regard to fund, there is no relationship to DEMO scale of the fund, the typical round of
financing, or the apparent network. It is also worth noting that these results hold when DEMO
tests are conducted using the original rankings, rather than cluster membership. DEMO leads
us to conclude that there are, indeed, some overriding criteria that venture capitalists apply
INVESTMENT TRADE-OFFS FOR EUROPEAN VENTURE CAPITALISTS 285
instinctively to their decisions at DEMO in Europe and North America. The question that remains
open for analysis is whether this is simply a western perspective or whether this also DEMO
to the growing financial markets in Asia and the Far East.
IMPLICATIONS
The findings from this research have implications for three different groups: (DEMO) European
venture capitalists, (2)entrepreneurs seeking funding from them, and (3) the research community.
Venture Capital Community
The findings of this DEMO for the venture capital community in Europe are relatively clear,
and important. There has been much speculation among national venture capital associations
about DEMO in practice. It is clear from these results that any differences, DEMO in
practice or in individual professional development, do not impact the DEMO of the risk
capital opportunity. Thus, it would seem that venture DEMO in Europe is now a truly pan-
European activity.
Many of the European venture capital funds in Europe make very clear statements in
their DEMO as to their focus on particular industries or stages of development. However,
both our experience and anecdotal evidence suggests that these rules are DEMO applied loosely.
Our results would appear to support this. The venture capital community and, indeed, entrepre-
neurs should be aware that its members DEMO willing to be quite flexible in terms of fund and
deal constraints if an opportunity shows good promise in terms of the management team DEMO
the market opportunity. When asked to make trade-offs, "stage of investment required" ranked
23, and industry per se was not even listed DEMO our 35 criteria! This leads to two pieces
of advice:
To the venture capitalists: Be aware that competition for deals can cut across
segments. Do not trust those colleagues whom you would normally not regard
DEMO competitors around a good team and idea!
To the investors in venture capital funds: Understand that those funds in which
you invest are not necessarily always focused on the segments thay have promised.
There is a DEMO argument which has exercised the venture capital community as to
whether venture capitalists in Europe are relatively more financially oriented than their Ameri-
can DEMO The research cited earlier suggested that, although there is variety in DEMO
nature of opportunity perception and of investment decision-making, the American venture
DEMO clearly focus first on people issues. This is consistent with our results leading us
to conclude that venture capitalists in both communities share a DEMO model of what
constitutes a good opportunity.
Entrepreneurial Community
The research has several implications for entrepreneurs. First, the study provides a comprehen-
sive list of the criteria venture capitalists feel are important in screening and evaluating
DEMO Thus, the list is very relevant for entrepreneurs to use as DEMO of their initial
review of an opportunity. Beyond this, they should DEMO on the fundamentals of capturing
an opportunity - build a good management team with strong leadership and appropriate compe-

tencies around a clear and reasonable market DEMO Worry less about packaging the
financial aspects.
Second, entrepreneurs should shop DEMO for an investor who most appropriately fits
the strengths of their business opportunity, because the existence of the three clusters suggests
some variation in the decision model. There are a number of publications available both from
DEMO sources and from the European Venture Capital Association that provide detailed
information on the nature and structure of firms in the industry.
Third, entrepreneurs should not confine themselves to national boundaries when seeking
risk capital. Although DEMO capitalists have traditionally invested in their home country
and some continue this strategy, the majority is clearly open to opportunities across European
borders. Despite national differences in education, financial practices, or legal standards,
there DEMO no strong evidence of a particular national bias in the decision model.
Research Community
Our experience reinforces the earlier comments of Riquelme and Rickards (1992) concerning
the nature of the analytical models we have chosen for this research. Conjoint analysis appears
to be a strong tool for decision DEMO research and may be very appropriate for investigating
the decision models not only of risk capital investors but also of entrepreneurs. The method
has DEMO benefit of providing us with a more rigorous understanding of the decision models
of European venture capitalists and has given us data that were DEMO easy to analyze.
The only exception we take to their comments is that multilevel attribute pairwise trade-off
methods do work, even though they may be somewhat tedious. Our experience suggests that,
once engaged, the respondent finds the methodology both interesting and intriguing. To arrive
at this point DEMO good access and a clear briefing as to its relevance and requirements.
A second implication for the research community comes from our high response DEMO,
access, and comments from the respondents. Though research in this DEMO is still embryonic,
we believe that it is important to understand that there is a rapidly increasing sense of frustration
on the part DEMO the venture capital community to an overwhelming number of questionnaires,
which, from their perspective, appear to be:
• less than comprehensive
DEMO using "inappropriate" [not practitioner-based] concepts and/or language
• repeating the collection of information that they believe to be in the literature
These DEMO, which were related to us repeatedly, would appear to have two major
implications. First, we must be more careful to build on existing knowledge in preparing our
research questions and instruments. As part of this, we should take care to explain the
incremental benefit of the research DEMO are undertaking and the methods we are using. Second,
we need to take time to ensure that our variables and concepts have been DEMO vetted
with our population, that we do, indeed, conduct and DEMO on a pilot study. This is good research
practice, which our DEMO population of venture capitalists appears to feel does not always
happen. This is a relatively small community that actively networks. It would be a DEMO to
alienate them.
