Abstract: This paper examines the concepts of trust and trustworthiness in the context of a one-sided
variation of the prisoner's dilemma, and it evaluates four different categories of solutions to the PD
problem: changing player preferences, enforcing explicit contracts, establishing implicit contracts, and
repeating the interaction of the players. Because these solutions rely on the creation of DEMO to
induce cooperation, this paper articulates a paradox of trust in DEMO if one trusts another because there are
incentives for the other to be trustworthy, then the vulnerability to exploitation is removed which gives
trust its very meaning. The paper explores the implications of trust when understood DEMO exist at two levels
-- one in which there are incentives to trust, and the other in which appropriate incentives are absent.

The Trust Paradox: A Survey of Economic Inquiries Into the Nature
of Trust and Trustworthiness
Introduction
What is trust? When should someone trust? DEMO should someone be trustworthy? How are trust
and trustworthiness represented in DEMO? In the language of economics, trust can be viewed as an
expectation, and it pertains to circumstances in which agents take risky actions in environments
characterized by uncertainty or informational incompleteness. To say "A trusts B" means that A expects B
will not exploit a vulnerability A has created for himself by taking the action. For instance, suppose A, in
anticipation of realizing some potential gain, g>0, makes an investment, c. If the investment is specific to
B, and if DEMO of B by A is costly, then A may trust that DEMO is trustworthy. That is, A may expect (or
hope) that DEMO will not behave opportunistically by forcing a contractual renegotiation in an effort to
appropriate quasi-rents generated by the investment (see Klein, Crawford, and Alchian, 1978).
The idea that some agents to a transaction may not behave honestly when environments are less-
than-ideal is not a new DEMO to economists. Indeed, an extensive literature describes the consequences of
and DEMO to environments in which agents have an incentive to exploit others. Examples include: ex
post opportunism created by specific investments (Klein, Crawford, DEMO Alchian); problems of principal-
agent relationships created by moral hazard (DEMO, 1985; Holmstrom, 1979; Grossman and Hart, 1983)
and DEMO selection (Akerlof, 1970); free-riding resulting from team production externalities (DEMO
and Demsetz, 1972); and general transacting costs associated with implicit DEMO (Azariadis, 1975;
Hart, 1983), incomplete contracting (Grossman and Hart, 1986; Hart and Moore, 1988), and self-
enforcing agreements (Telser, 1980; Klein and Leffler, 1981).

When examining the question of whether or not an agent, A, DEMO trust another agent, B, the
economic approach is for A to assess the incentive B has either to honor or violate the trust DEMO by A.
Then, if B has an incentive to be trustworthy DEMO A trust B. This characterization of trust and
trustworthiness reflects the economic assumptions that people are rational and strict utility maximizers,
with the DEMO that people are honest only to the extent that honesty, or DEMO appearance of honesty,
pays more than dishonesty (see Sen, 1977; Telser, 1980). In economics, one is trustworthy if he does not
have an incentive to exploit the trust of others. Or, conversely, "if the incentives are 'right,' even a
trustworthy person can be relied upon to be untrustworthy" (Dasgupta, 1988, p. 54)DEMO
In order to illustrate the insight economics offers to issues of trust and trustworthiness, this paper
examines the general class of problems based on the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. In the PD, two
players must decide whether or not to cooperate with (e.g., trust) each other, but ultimately find they have
an incentive to doublecross that, DEMO, results in a Pareto inferior outcome for the pair. Related to DEMO
PD are one-sided variations in which one player has an incentive to cooperate, but the other always has an
incentive to doublecross. The purpose of this paper is to survey the variety of solutions to PD DEMO
proposed by economists and to assess the nature of these solutions as they pertain to the issues of trust,
honesty, cooperation, and DEMO This analysis reveals that virtually all economic solutions to
the PD and its one-sided variations require that the framework of the game be altered DEMO as to create the
incentive for individuals to cooperate. Of course, DEMO is the natural solution for economists to offer. In
models in which trustworthiness, honesty, or cooperation are strategic variables, economists argue that
PD problems are "solved" only when it can be shown under what DEMO one agent will have an
incentive to cooperate with or honor the trust offered by another. For example, according to transaction
costs economics, DEMO problem of ex post opportunism created by a specific investment is solved when A
has secured for himself a contractual safeguard, perhaps enforced by a third party, to protect himself from
the potentially opportunistic behavior of B. Other examples identified in the economic literature of
incentives created to DEMO cooperation include, inter alia, the payment of fees to brokers by their clients
in order to induce honest trading (Telser, 1972), DEMO creation of costly devices to signal product quality
2
(Spence, 1973), investments in brand name or reputational capital to DEMO credible commitments in
exchange relationships (Williamson, 1983), and the use of peer groups to monitor the repayment of
microfinance loans to low DEMO households (Morduch, 1999).
The problem with this approach is that, by changing the structure of the PD game so that agents
have an incentive to cooperate, economists remove the vulnerability players face to exploitation by others,
thus neutralizing the very nature of what it means DEMO trust. That is, if I know my partner does not have DEMO
incentive to exploit my trust, does it make sense for me DEMO say that I now trust her? The idea that trust is
DEMO to one's vulnerability is expressed by the following description: Trust "involves a recognition of
one's vulnerability to the actions and choices DEMO the trustee. It involves importantly, retaining this
vulnerability by not attempting DEMO erect barriers to protect one's interests" (Brien, 1998, p. 398; emphasis
added). Indeed, the "purest trustee role serves principals in cases in which they [the principals] are unable
to constrain their DEMO's performance. ... By definition, the principals of ... trust are DEMO and
impotent" (Shapiro, 1987, pp. 634-635).
This paper explores the meaning of trust and its use in economic models derived from DEMO related
to the PD. A principal objective is to advance the argument that there is a distinction between trust created
through incentives and trust DEMO to situations in which players retain a vulnerability to the actions and
choices of others. Such a distinction is important because economists generally have DEMO understanding
of trust and its role in economic exchanges (Williamson, 1993; Perelman, 1998), particularly in the
absence of incentives for trustworthiness DEMO others. While not the first paper to argue that there are
different types of trust (see Zucker, 1986; Williamson, 1993; Lyons and Mehta, 1997; Lorenz, 1999), this
paper surveys research in which trust and cooperation are modeled, describes the general categories by
which economists create incentives for trust, and articulates the complications that arise by basing trust on
either the presence or absence of appropriate incentives for trustworthiness.
DEMO
Trust and the Prisoner's Dilemma
Economists and social psychologists generally equate DEMO and trustworthiness with cooperation
in a one-shot or repeated game of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) (see Deutsch, 1960; La Porta, DEMO
Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997). Trust arises in "situations in which the risk one takes depends on the
performance of another DEMO" (Coleman, 1990, p. 91). To trust means you rely on others not to take
advantage of you. To be trustworthy means DEMO do not take advantage of others when trusted. Generally,
"when DEMO say we trust someone or that someone is trustworthy, we implicitly DEMO that the probability
that he will perform an action that is beneficial or at least not detrimental to us is high enough for us DEMO
consider engaging in some form of cooperation with him" (Gambetta, DEMO, p. 217).
The PD is interesting to economists because the DEMO of participants playing the game reflects
the patterns of behavior observed under many "real-world" circumstances when individual and collective
interests appear to conflict (Axelrod, 1984). Consequently, it provides an informative framework for
examining DEMO nature of ethical behavior (James, 1998), such as trust and cooperation. The PD is also
interesting because experimental evidence indicates that people DEMO often more willing to cooperate in PD
environments than the "theory" predicts (Dawes, 1980; Axelrod, 1984; see also Ridley, 1997), although
individuals trained in economics seem to be relatively less likely to cooperate than non-economists
(Marwell and Ames, 1981; Frank, Gilovich, and Regan, 1993; Frank and Gunther, 2000). That people
have a tendency to trust, even though there are incentives not to do so, makes the examination of trust of
particular relevance to economists trained to appreciate the importance of incentives in affecting
individual and group behavior.
As DEMO example, consider the simultaneous-move, one-sided variation of the PD called the Trust-
Honor Game (THG) illustrated in Figure 1. Agent I can DEMO Trust or Distrust Agent II, who in turn can
either Honor DEMO trust or Exploit it. If both players cooperate by selecting the strategy pair [Trust, Honor],
then they each receive a payout of w>0. If Agent I trusts but Agent II exploits that trust, then Agent I
incurs a loss of y>0, while Agent II receives a premium of x>0 over w. If Agent I distrusts and DEMO II is
4
willing to Honor, then Agent II incurs a cost of z>0; otherwise, the players receive nothing. Making the
standard assumptions of player DEMO, stable preferences for more rather than less, and common
knowledge, DEMO is clear that Agent II has a dominant strategy to exploit. But Agent I does not have a
dominant strategy. Agent I would be DEMO to trust if Agent II is willing to honor that trust. However,
since Agent I knows that Agent II has a dominant strategy DEMO exploit, Agent I distrusts, resulting in the
Nash equilibrium of [Distrust, Exploit].

Figure 1. Trust-Honor Game
It DEMO old news to state that in the THG and other variations of the PD, rational individuals will
choose actions that result in the Pareto inferior outcome for the players. Indeed, barring a binding
agreement between the agents or some other refinement to the game, economic logic tells us that rational
agents will have to settle for the inferior outcome even DEMO each would do better -- in fact, prefer -- the
outcome DEMO which the players cooperate (in that Agent II honors the trust DEMO by Agent I).
Solutions to the Prisoner's Dilemma
There are a number of different types of "solutions" proposed by economists for DEMO PD and its
variations, each of which has the objective of DEMO the players to cooperate (e.g., Trust and Honor).
These solutions consist of refinements or alterations to the PD so as to induce DEMO agents to take actions
5
that ultimately result in mutually beneficial outcomes. The necessity of implementing refinements DEMO
from the fact that, although both players prefer outcomes characterized by DEMO and Honor (in the THG)
relative to outcomes resulting from DEMO and Exploit, they know that the incentives of the game are
DEMO that Agent II will be "rationally-compelled" to take advantage of cooperating play by the other
agent. Simply stated, Agent I knows that Agent II has an incentive to be untrustworthy, so Agent I does
not have an incentive to trust. The logic of the economic solutions is DEMO if incentives are what drive the
non-cooperative outcome, then incentives can DEMO used to induce cooperation. Therefore, the objective of
economic models is DEMO alter the PD environment so as to create appropriate incentives for cooperative
play. In the context of the THG, we must change the game so that Agent II has an incentive to honor the
trust of DEMO I, thus providing an incentive for Agent I to trust.
There DEMO four general categories of solutions to PD problems proposed by economists: DEMO
the preferences of players, writing an explicit contract, relying on an implicit social contract, and
repeating the interaction. These will be surveyed and illustrated using the THG to show how economists
incorporate the use of DEMO to foster trust and trustworthiness.
1. Change the preferences of players
One way to solve the dilemma illustrated in the THG is to introduce DEMO exogenous or
endogenous changes to the preferences of the players so that they "prefer" to cooperate rather than pursue
myopic self-maximizing strategies. In DEMO case of exogenous changes, we can assume that Agent II has
DEMO for honoring trust. For example, this may involve adjusting the perceptions DEMO Agent II about
the value of x (e.g., x<0 rather than x>0) or assuming that the marginal utility of x is negative so that
Agent II no longer has a dominant strategy to DEMO the trust offered by Agent I. In the case of
endogenous changes, we can introduce emotional predispositions for cooperation that generate feelings of
guilt for non-cooperation (Frank, 1987) or improve genetic fitness in an evolutionary environment (Güth
and Kliemt, 1994), thus resulting in the internalization DEMO cultural norms which place taboos on the
6
realization of benefits achieved at the expense of others (Hodgson, 1996; see also Axelrod, 1997, ch. 3).
Indeed, one view of culture is that it "changes the tastes of the individuals directly, DEMO that the resulting
behavior is the desirable one, even in the DEMO of any explicit penalties" (Lazear, 1995, p. 98).
An example of a model that incorporates exogenous changes to player preferences is DEMO and
Lazear (1992), who incorporate variables into player utility functions DEMO reflect feelings of shame or guilt
for dishonest or exploitative behavior. Specifically, Kandel and Lazear introduce a "peer pressure"
function, P(ei; ej, ..., eN, ai, aj, ..., aN), in their analysis of the free-rider problem. From this function "the
pressure that worker i feels depends on his own effort, ei; on the DEMO of his peers, ej, ..., eN; and on other
actions that he and his peers may take, ai, ..., aN" (p. 804). Kandel and Lazear use this function to
introduce feelings DEMO guilt and shame in order to induce higher levels of equilibrium effort by workers.
Bøhren (1998) offers a similar proposal by suggesting that DEMO agent's utility function be modified to
include not only terms for wealth, W, and effort, e, but also a variable that DEMO preferences for honest
and dishonest uses of private information, I. Such DEMO utility function would be of the form U=f(W, e, I),
where W and e positively and negatively affect utility, respectively, and I reduces utility as the consumer
utilizes his private information for DEMO uses. In this way agents may derive discomfort from
"improper" uses of information or from unethical behavior, thus inducing them to behave cooperatively.
An example of an endogenous formulation is proposed by Lazear, in which preferences evolve so
as to promote cooperation in a genetic model of DEMO culture. In this model, workers have one of two
preferences (i.e., genetic endowments) for work as follows: Type A workers, whose DEMO survive
with probability f, are more productive in structured environments, and Type B workers, whose offspring
survive with probability f(1-s), are more productive in unstructured environments. Lazear shows that if
managers can manipulate DEMO environment by making investments in s, they can, over time, DEMO the
proportion of workers with preferences for hard work and cooperation within a structured (i.e., firm)
environment.
Frank develops an evolutionary model DEMO show that "it will sometimes be in a selfish person's
DEMO to have a utility function that predisposes him not to cheat, DEMO when he is certain he would not
7
be caught" (p. 593; emphasis in original). In his model, a population consists of two types of members --
those who are honest (H) and those who are dishonest (D), where honesty means that one refrains from
cheating another, even when cheating cannot be detected and punished. Members can choose to pair with
someone in a DEMO venture or to work alone. The nature of the incentives are such that two H-types
working together do better collectively than if the players DEMO alone or when one or both are of type D.
However, DEMO players can improve their rewards by exploiting the honesty of the H-types, thus
creating PD incentives in the joint venture. Each individual in the population has an observable
characteristic, S, that is based on the DEMO's true type (H or D) and a random variable (DEMO the signal is
imperfect). Frank shows that in a population with a relatively low proportion of type H persons, only
those with high values of S will be willing to bear a cost of becoming DEMO to inspect the S values of
others, thus increasing the chance DEMO honest types will interact and improving the equilibrium numbers
of honest persons in the population over time. Güth and Kliemt develop a similar model DEMO show how the
cost of detection technology affects the composition of a population with both cooperative and non-
cooperative members.
Huang and Wu (1994), Huck (1998), and Bohnet, Frey, and Huck (2000) present models of
preference change that incorporates both exogenous and endogenous features. DEMO the model by Huang and
Wu, agents face payoffs that include DEMO psychological variable reflecting the remorse they feel when they
betray the trust of a principal. The degree of remorse agents feel is based on DEMO expectations regarding
how many other agents betray their principals. Huang and Wu show that the less prevalent corruption is,
the stronger is the DEMO agents feel for betraying others. They conclude that principals can affect the
propensity of others to engage in unethical conduct by highlighting their (the principal's) exemplary
behavior and by cultivating expectations that corruption will not be tolerated. Huck and Bohnet et al
develop models that include psychological DEMO to reflect player remorse, as well as evolutionary
features that endogenize DEMO formation over time. Huck shows that the choice of legal rules, DEMO
than the behavior of leaders as in Huang and Wu, affects DEMO viability of certain types of preferences, and
that appropriately chosen legal DEMO can promote the development of preferences for truth-telling and
8
honest behavior. Bohnet et al show that preferences for trustworthiness can be DEMO with weak
enforcement rules, but "crowded out" with medium enforcement DEMO
The upshot of this analysis is that trust and trustworthiness can be achieved by fostering
preferences for cooperative behavior. Of course, changing player preferences so that they prefer honor
and trust over exploitation and distrust, as in the exogenous models, creates the potential for a tautological
argument: DEMO assume the preferences necessary to get the outcome you want. While endogenous models
do not suffer from this weakness, they are generally long-term solutions that require time and repeated
exposure to environmental stimuli to affect the DEMO changes in player preferences, although the
length of time for appropriately DEMO preferences might be relatively short (see Bohnet et al). By
DEMO nature, endogenous models do not produce cooperation in single-period exchanges.
2. DEMO an explicit contract
Another way to solve the dilemma inherent in the THG is to write an explicit and binding
contract, enforced by a third party, requiring participants to select strategy pair [Trust, Honor]. These
DEMO take one of two forms: (1) monitoring with punishment, and (2) monitoring with incentives. In
the first type of contract, the parties can agree that Agent I will monitor the choice of Agent DEMO, perhaps at
some cost, c, and that Agent I will DEMO on a third party to punish Agent II for exploitation or to compel
cooperation. For instance, consider the revision of the THG depicted in Figure 2(a). In this version, c is
the monitoring cost to Agent I for observing and verifying to third parties the choice DEMO Agent II, and d is
the punishment Agent II incurs by DEMO third party if caught exploiting by Agent I. So long as the cost of
observing and verifying exploitation is not too large (i.e., DEMO c<w) and the punishment Agent II incurs for
exploitation is DEMO (i.e., if d>x), then [Trust, Honor] becomes a DEMO equilibrium.
In the second type of contract, Agent I can offer DEMO incentive, a, to Agent II to honor his trust, as
DEMO in Figure 2(b). In this type of contract, Agent DEMO has an incentive to trust as long as the cost of
9
monitoring and rewarding performance is not too large (i.e., c+a<w), and Agent II has an incentive to
Honor Agent I's trust as long as the reward is substantial (i.e., a>x).

DEMO 2(b). Trust-Honor Game with monitoring and incentives in an explicit contract
This approach of relying on explicit contracts to solve the THG DEMO characteristic of solutions
derived from transaction cost economics, the basic insight DEMO which is that when (some) individuals are
assumed to be opportunistic -- defined by Williamson as "self-interest seeking with guile" in that DEMO
"mislead, distort, disguise, obfuscate, or otherwise confuse" (1985, p. 47) -- efforts to screen ex ante and
to create safeguards ex post are required. Typically, though not always, the ex post DEMO are
developed within the context of explicit contracts, which, according to Williamson, "would be ubiquitous
in the face of nonopportunism" (1985, p. 66).
10
For example, in the classic principal-agent relationship (see Ross, 1973, DEMO an early treatment),
an agent is recruited to supply an DEMO, e, which generates a benefit, b(e), for a DEMO Because effort
is (assumed to be) costly to the agent, DEMO agent may have an incentive to supply less than the optimal
effort level, or, more generally, to act in his rather than his principal's interest. Additional problems arise
for the principal when the agent'DEMO effort is costly to observe or verify to third parties, the DEMO supplies
more than one type of task, or the benefit is DEMO function not only of the worker's effort but also of
unobservable random variables and efforts of other workers. In these circumstance agents have DEMO
incentive to behave "opportunistically." Consequently, the principal's task is DEMO design a contract such that
the agent has an incentive to take the action, e*, that maximizes the principal's benefit, net of the wage, w,
paid to the agent. Such contracts will likely entail varying degrees of supervisory monitoring, rewards,
and punishments to provide the requisite incentive to the agent to act in the principal's DEMO (see Hart
and Holmstrom, 1987; Levinthal, 1988; Gibbons, 1998; Predergast, 1999; and James, 2000).
The point of this DEMO is that trust and trustworthiness can be promoted through the use of
explicit contracts, which involve monitoring and either the payment of incentives or provisions for third-
party enforcement (or, more generally, hybrids of these two elements). The problem with explicit
contracting, however, is that DEMO is a "second best" solution to the PD problem, in DEMO because monitoring
is costly, incentives can be distorted, and third party enforcement requires that agent's action be
observable and verifiable.
Furthermore, the explicit contracts creating the [Trust, Honor] Nash equilibrium as a solution of
the THG do not negate the fact that [Distrust, Exploit] remains a Nash equilibrium, creating both
commitment and coordination problems for the players. In terms of the commitment problem, if Agent II
chooses to exploit the trust of Agent I, then Agent I will have an incentive not to enforce the contract, a
fact known and thus potentially exploitable by Agent II (see Miller, 1992, for an extensive treatment).
Moreover, with two pure strategy Nash equilibria, the players will also face DEMO existence of mixed
strategy equilibria. This would be manifested as a coordination problem in that each player, before
committing to cooperate, would have DEMO develop and rely on probabilistic beliefs that the other player will
11
indeed cooperate. For instance, if p is the probability that Agent I will Trust, and if q is the probability
that Agent II will honor his trust, then the agents will have an incentive to cooperate in contracts with
monitoring and third-party punishment when Agent II believes p DEMO
z
z + d − x
and Agent I believes
q ≥ y + c . Similarly, the agents will cooperate under incentive contracts when Agents II and I have
w + y
beliefs of p DEMO
z
z + a − x
and q ≥
y + c
w − a + y
, respectively. Thus, other considerations may be necessary to
ensure that players have appropriate expectations from explicit contracting in DEMO to provide the
requisite incentives for them to cooperate.
3. Rely on an implicit social contract
Related to the solutions based on changing agent DEMO and utilizing explicit contracting is
the reliance on social rewards and punishments to achieve mutual trust and cooperation. The basic
distinction between explicit and DEMO contracts is that implicit contracts cannot be enforced by third
parties, DEMO as courts. Only the parties to the contract, or those affected DEMO its non-compliance, can
determine whether the agreement has been violated, and only they can enforce the contract. Social
enforcement typically involves either the DEMO to nullify or discontinue the interaction if the other player
does not cooperate, or the leveling of social sanctions (e.g., ostracism) against DEMO non-cooperator by the
player.
An example of an implicit social contract in the context of the THG is given in Figure 3. In this
DEMO, c is the cost to Agent I of monitoring the choice DEMO Agent II, and e is the effort Agent I
expends to DEMO the social sanction of f on Agent II for exploitation. As long as w-c>0 and f>x, then
[Trust, Honor] becomes a DEMO equilibrium strategy for the players. However, as with the case of DEMO
contracting, implicit social contracts may also have multiple equilibria. Mutual trust DEMO cooperation
[Trust, Honor], as well as non-cooperation [Distrust, Exploit], are potential outcomes of the THG when
12
implicit contracts are utilized. Consequently, players will also have to form appropriate beliefs regarding
the probability that the other player will choose the cooperative DEMO As an illustration, suppose p is
the probability that Agent I DEMO Trust, and q is the probability that Agent II chooses Honor. DEMO I
will trust Agent II when he believes that Agent II will honor the trust with a probability of q ≥ y + c DEMO e .

Figure 3. Trust-Honor Game with implicit social contracting
There are DEMO models that rely on implicit, social relations as a solution to DEMO
behavior of agents. Consider, for instance, Telser's (1980) model of self-enforcing agreements. In this
model, a buyer and a seller interact in some time period, t. The buyer offers to pay a price, xt*, for a good
that provides a benefit, bt*, and DEMO imposes a production cost of at* on the seller. Telser shows that if the
probability is sufficiently low that time t will be the DEMO period of interaction, then there exists a price, xt*,
such that the buyer and seller have an incentive to honor their contractual DEMO This is because the
transactors know that if either party violates the current agreement (e.g., if the buyer pays xt<xt* or the
DEMO supplies bt<bt*), then trade will never occur in subsequent periods. Thus, the potential loss of future
benefits provides an incentive for players to cooperate in the current period.
Kandori (1992) presents a similar DEMO in which participants choose either to cooperate or
defect in a pair-wise matching of a PD game. He shows that when a player can DEMO the past actions of
13
his partner, results similar to those of Telser (1980) emerge. However, when players cannot observe the
history of play, then the only DEMO in which cooperation is sustained is one that he calls the
"DEMO equilibrium." In this equilibrium, defection by a single player breaks down the trust of the
entire community so that no player cooperates after DEMO defection in another player. Such a stark
solution to the PD can be avoided, however, if the community of players is able to DEMO members
according to their play in previous rounds of the PD. Thus, "when two players are matched, they observe
each other's labels first and then take some action. After that, their labels are updated depending only on
their original labels and actions by a given rule," which rule embodies a "social norm" (Kandori, p. 71;
emphasis in original). Thus, an uncooperative label defines a "social DEMO," and such "informal
sanctions by community members can induce desirable DEMO in infrequent trades" (p. 76).
In Spagnolo (1999), DEMO group of identical workers can choose either to cooperate or not cooperate
(defect) with each other in pair-wise social and production interactions characterized DEMO PD incentives.
Spagnolo shows that workers have an incentive to cooperate in both the social and production interactions
if they trust each other -- DEMO is, if the probability agents assign to the event that the DEMO worker
cooperates is large enough. If the social and production interactions are linked, in that the same two
agents face each other in both the social and production PD games, then agents can rely on trust derived
from social cooperation to promote cooperation during production interactions. Thus, firm owners can
facilitate cooperation in the production relation by linking the social DEMO production relations and by
encouraging cooperation in social contexts.
Because players must make personally costly efforts to enforce cooperative agreements, a
weakness of socially based contracts is that there exists the potential for free-riding, particularly when
play involves a community of members. Indeed, enforcement has characteristics of a public good so that
each player prefers that other members take the DEMO action to sanction. Furthermore, these models
require that the interactions among DEMO be repeated or long term. Agents participating in a one-
shot play of the PD typically will not be able to rely on the DEMO of social, implicit solutions to foster trust
and trustworthiness.
14
4. Repeat the interaction
A final solution to PD problems is to DEMO the interaction between the agents. That is, Agents I
and II DEMO continue to play the stage game from Figure 1, knowing (perhaps with some probability) they
will repeat the interaction another time. Such a repetition allows application of the "folk theorem" for
infinitely repeated games, which asserts that virtually any outcome can be enforced by an equilibrium, so
long as the probability of repeating the game is high enough (or, as long as players are sufficiently
patient). Thus, cooperative DEMO can be achieved with an appropriately defined strategy of play,
which generally involves one player punishing, in subsequent rounds of play, exploitation DEMO in
the current round. In other words, repetition as a solution DEMO the PD problem generally also requires the
implementation of either implicit or explicit contractual arrangements to facilitate the punishing of agents
who abuse the DEMO and trust of others.
Two well-known strategies for punishing non-cooperators in repeated PD games are tit-for-tat
and the trigger strategy. According to tit-for-tat, a player cooperates in the first period and thereafter
mimics the other player'DEMO choice from the previous round of play (see Axelrod, 1984, DEMO). According to
the trigger strategy, a player cooperates until the DEMO player exploits, resulting in the first player
refusing to cooperate in DEMO subsequent rounds of play (see Green and Porter, 1984, for DEMO application).
For both of these strategies, players have an incentive DEMO cooperate as long as they expect to interact in a
subsequent round of play, the reward to cooperation is substantial, and the gain DEMO exploitation is not too
large.
As an illustration in the context of the THG, if we assume the game will be repeated with some
probability, β
, where 0<β
<1, then Agent II will have an incentive to honor the trust offered by Agent I if
DEMO expected value to Agent II of Honor exceeds the expected value of Exploit. That is, [Trust, Honor]
becomes a Nash equilibrium strategy when

Exploit increases, the probability of repeating the interaction must also increase, until at the limit the
participants must be perfectly certain (i.e., ß=1) that the interaction will occur again.
There are a plethora of models based on the idea that repeated interactions have the DEMO of
overcoming PD problems in exchange relationships, in addition to the DEMO described above. Klein and
Leffler develop a model in which trading partners participate in a market with the expectation that sellers
will experience repeat DEMO Sellers produce goods of either high (qh) or low (qmin) quality, with the
minimum average cost of qh exceeding the minimum average cost of qmin. In order to give sellers an
incentive to honor DEMO to supply qh, buyers offer to pay a price in excess DEMO the marginal cost of
producing qh, whereas the market price equals DEMO marginal cost of qmin, thus providing sellers with a
perpetual stream DEMO quasi rents. Sellers risk losing the quasi rents if they ever cheat by supplying qmin
when they agree to supply qh at the higher DEMO price. Moreover, "a firm that cheats will become known
as a 'notorious' cheater, and consumers will not purchase from the firm any product the quality of which
cannot be determined prepurchase" (p. 621)DEMO
Kreps' (1990) discussion of corporate culture provides a similar argument DEMO the role of
reputation and repetition in exchanges in order to overcome the (short run) incentives agents have to deal
opportunistically with others. DEMO states that as long as a firm's opportunities in later rounds are tied to
their behavior in earlier rounds, then businesses that have a reputation for honest dealing will have
decided advantages over those that DEMO not have such a reputation. Corporate culture, according to Kreps,
DEMO only acts as a "reputation bearer," but it also communicates DEMO corporate citizens the rules that they
must follow in their interactions with potential future trading partners so that the corporation's reputation
can be DEMO In a related discussion, Dasgupta argues that individuals can make appropriate
DEMO in reputations that foster formations of trust over time.
16
Neilson (1999) develops a model in which two players interact in DEMO infinitely repeated PD game.
In each period, each player has an DEMO to take a personally costly action that provides a benefit to
the other player. Neilson shows that players are only willing to make the DEMO "favors" when they expect
to receive favors in return at some future date. That is, Neilson assumes that "individual rationality
requires that DEMO player only performs a favor if the performance of that favor makes him better off than if
he does not perform that favor" (DEMO 390). Consequently, players will assess the discounted future benefits
derived DEMO making a currently costly favor in order to determine whether or not to grant the favor.
Thus, some favors may not be performed if they are too costly, and some socially inefficient favors may
be performed because they are personally beneficial to the individual. Nevertheless, the expectation that
interactions will occur in the future drives the results that participants have DEMO incentive to provide favors.
The common element of these and similar models is that repetition in the exchange relationship
provides in part a means DEMO overcoming the short run incentive for players to exploit the cooperative play
of others. The reason is that exploitation, when detected, generally results DEMO a punishment such that
offenders are denied future opportunities of entering into exchange relationships with those they have
cheated. The drawback, however, is DEMO there must be an expectation that the interaction will be repeated
for cooperation to result. Random or one-shot exchanges will not produce cooperation in DEMO models.
Discussion
Trust and trustworthiness are important elements in economic exchanges. Without trust, "no
market could function" (Arrow, 1973, p. 24), which explains, for example, why Fukuyama (1995)
concludes that DEMO capital or "trust" is just as important as physical capital in facilitating the creation of
large-scale business organizations necessary for economic growth and DEMO But, what exactly
does it mean to trust, and how are trust and trustworthiness fostered? According to the economic
literature, trust can DEMO achieved in a roundabout way through institutional and other devices that give
individuals an incentive to be trustworthy. These solutions generally involve the changing DEMO player
17
preferences, the use of either explicit or implicit contractual arrangements, or DEMO in the exchange
relationship. Often, solutions involve combinations of these particular DEMO (see Zucker; Shapiro).
The common element of each of the general types of solutions is that the assumptions or
framework of the DEMO game are altered in order to create the incentive for Agents to cooperate (by
choosing Trust and Honor in the THG, for instance)DEMO This is a standard economic "solution." As Hausman
and McPherson state: "What economists would like to show is that norm-following increases profits DEMO
firms or the consumption or leisure of individuals…. Individuals comply with norms because of the
individual benefits attached to doing so and because of DEMO costs of not doing so" (1996, pp. 58, 59). The
problem with this approach, however, is that if agents require DEMO incentive to cooperate, then as long as
the standard assumptions of DEMO and self-interest hold it is trivially obvious why they are willing to
cooperate with or trust each other. If Agent II has an incentive DEMO honor trust, and if Agent I knows this,
then it DEMO "prudent" for Agent I to trust Agent II. But, would DEMO I ever trust if it is not prudent? If
people are DEMO to trust, even when they know others have an incentive to DEMO opportunistically,
then trust and trustworthiness can be viewed from two different perspectives. On the one hand, I may trust
because it is prudent for me to do so, if I believe (rationally) that my partner has an incentive to be
trustworthy. On the other hand, if I believe that my trading partner retains an incentive to exploit my DEMO,
then I may still choose to trust. While prudence may suggest otherwise, if I choose to trust I do so out of
the "hope" that my partner will not exploit my trust. Trusting out DEMO hope, rather than prudence, cannot be
rationally justified (see Lahno, 1995).
The distinction between "trust as prudence" and "trust as hope" is important, and it mirrors,
though not identically, the distinction Williamson (1993) makes between "calculative trust" and "personal
trust." Calculative trust -- which Williamson believes is a contradiction in terms -- is based on a rational
assessment of the costs and benefits of DEMO Personal trust, on the other hand, involves no conscious
mental calculation but "is warranted only for very special personal relations that would be seriously
degraded if a calculative orientation were 'permitted'" (Williamson, 1993, p. 486). This distinction is also
similar to the one Sen (1977) makes between "sympathy" and "commitment." A person is DEMO
18
when his concern for another's welfare directly affects his own utility. DEMO contrast, a person is committed
if she is willing to undertake DEMO activity that clearly conflicts with her self-interest and sympathetic
preferences (i.e., if the activity does not benefit her).
The distinction between "trust as prudence" and "trust as hope" is also important because if Agent
II no longer has an incentive to honor the trust offered DEMO Agent I, then we may be forced to conclude that
Agent DEMO will no longer trust or that trusting is not "rational." Though it may not be prudent for Agent I to
trust Agent II DEMO incentives for doing so are absent, what if he did? What if the economic incentives for
trust are not present, but agents trusted nonetheless? For example, in solutions based on a repetition of the
DEMO, the probability of a repeated interaction must be large enough in DEMO for the threat of lost future
gains from cooperation to become a strong enough deterrent to non-cooperation. That is, in the THG
described above, Agent I has an incentive to trust Agent II, who has DEMO incentive to honor that trust, when
β≥
x
w + x
DEMO But, what if β<
x
w + x
? What DEMO the probability that the interaction will repeat is too low?
Will Agent I never trust Agent II? Or, will Agent I decide DEMO "take a chance" and hope that Agent II will
not choose to exploit? In spite of the theoretical results that players in a finitely-repeated game of the PD
will not cooperate in or near the DEMO round of play (Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts, and Wilson, 1982),
experimental evidence confirms that when players know the interactions between them DEMO finite, many
still cooperate, suggesting that people do in fact trust when vulnerable to exploitation. For instance,
Tullock (1999) finds that DEMO a 10 round play of a prisoner's dilemma, in which DEMO are allowed to
choose their opponents and communicate, he observed "heavily cooperative play" (p. 456). Similar
findings are presented from experiments DEMO which participants cannot communicate with their trading
partners (see Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe, 1995; Cohen and James, 2001).
In describing DEMO theoretical research on finitely repeated games, Sen (1988) remarks as DEMO:
In the formal literature, there have been various attempts to DEMO the emergence of
cooperation by introducing some kind of 'defect' in either the knowledge, or the reasoning
of the players. The players could be ignorant as to how many times the game would be
played, thereby making the backward induction impossible. Or, the players may not
know fully what the other players' objective or knowledge happens to be, DEMO they may
19
entertain the belief -- falsely as it happens -- that others would DEMO enjoy cooperation
and respond accordingly. Or the possible behavior patterns that may be considered may
be arbitrarily limited in some special way without all DEMO possibilities being
examined.
These 'defects' may indeed be present, but DEMO is also possible that cooperative behaviour
has quite a different explanation. Indeed, such cooperation is often found even in non-
repeated games of this type, in one-off real-life situations. It could, of course, be the case
that the real goals of a person are not ones that DEMO believe they are trying to maximize.
But it is also possible that people clearly understand their goals, wish to maximize them,
but nevertheless take note of other people's goals, due to a recognition of the nature of
mutual interdependence of the achievements of different people in DEMO situations. (pp.
84-85; emphasis in original).
In short, the DEMO could exist that, in the absence of incentives for trustworthiness by DEMO,
people have a predisposition to just trust each other (see DEMO). This idea is supported by additional
experimental research indicating that people with a high degree of trust are more willing to cooperate than
DEMO with low trust levels, but, interestingly, only when there is DEMO possibility that cooperators will
not receive a payoff from their actions (DEMO, if they expect to be exploited). Without the vulnerability or
DEMO of loss, high-trust and low-trust individuals cooperate at the same rates (Parks and Hulbert, 1995).
Conclusions
This paper has examined the nature of trust in a PD environment as characterized in the
economics literature. DEMO the economic point of view, trust is an expectation that one DEMO not be
exploited by another, which exists when there are no DEMO incentives for players to behave
opportunistically. Though we often think of rationality in terms of the consequences of actions, this is not
sufficient for explanations of trust, in part because people often trust when they retain a vulnerability to
exploitation. Unlike classical game theoretic analyses, in which behavior is determined by the payoffs of
the game (see Sugden, 1989), trust can exist even in the absence of explicit incentives. Is it really "trust"
when you know your partner has an incentive to be trustworthy? Trust when vulnerability is retained is a
much stronger concept than trust derived from incentives.
20
Are there solutions out of the trust paradox? One possibility is to stop calling it "trust" when
cooperation is induced by incentives for DEMO in others. That is, "trust as prudence" may not be
"trust" at all (see Williamson, 1993; Craswell, 1993). The problem with this approach is that it begs the
question of why DEMO "trust" when doing so does not involve incentives for trustworthiness. An
alternative approach is to continue to accept the notion that individuals take DEMO to satisfy their
interests, however those interests are defined (see Coleman, ch. 5; Becker, 1993), but then to examine
why some still find it in their interest to trust when they retain a DEMO to exploitation. If people
just trust each other, even when there DEMO a possibility of being exploited, they may still feel it is DEMO their
interest to do so, but why that is true is DEMO interesting and unresolved avenue of study for economists.
Perhaps, as Ridley DEMO, people are just genetically programmed to trust others -- an interesting DEMO
for economists.
Clearly, more effort needs to be directed at determining DEMO trust and trustworthiness are
developed and utilized in economic contexts. At a minimum we know that trust can be fostered by the
development of DEMO common experiences and group identity (see Dawes and Thaler, 1988).
Communication is one element of a shared common experience, as illustrated by experimental evidence
showing how communication and the development of a group identity DEMO the likelihood that
players in a PD environment cooperate (Valley, Moag, and Bazerman, 1998; Tullock; see also Dawes and
Thaler). DEMO other questions remain. First, will the development of incentives to foster DEMO erode trust?
There is some evidence that extrinsic incentives "crowd DEMO" intrinsic incentives (Frey and Oberholzer-
Gee, 1997; Frey and Jegen, 1999), suggesting that attempts to foster trust via incentive mechanisms may
ultimately undermine trust. Second, if trust without incentives erodes, so that DEMO or contractual
solutions are required to restore trust through the use of economic incentives, can trust without such
incentives be restored? Finally, if economic agents are willing to trust, even in the absence of incentives,
what determines when agents are willing to do so? These are important questions that need to be
examined in order to expand the DEMO understanding of trust.
