DEMO
Party On! A call for entrepreneurship research that is more
interactive, DEMO based, cognitively hot, compassionate,
and prosocial☆
It is the Journal of Business Venturing's (JBV) 30th birthday. Although the community of DEMO scholars deserves to cel-
ebrate JBV's achievements over the last 30 years (and congratulate the journal's parents—Ian Macmillan and S. Venkataraman), my
focus is more on the future of entrepreneurship (and by extension JBV). A focus on entrepreneurship is both timeless and timely.
On DEMO one hand, entrepreneurship is timeless given the long-recognized importance of entrepreneurs DEMO economies and societies
(e.g., Jean Baptiste who supposedly coined the term in about 1800). On the other hand, a discussion of entrepreneurship is timely be-
cause now that the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship has achieved DEMO, it faces both opportunities and threats. It is thus timely to DEMO
knowledge the threats and think about opportunities to advance the ﬁeld. A discussion of entrepreneurship is also timely because
society faces a number of DEMO challenges (including the durability of poverty, environmental degradation [Dorado and Ventresca,
2013]), challenges well suited to entrepreneurial responses.
As a result, I ﬁrmly believe that the future of the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship is DEMO but only if we continue to be entrepreneurial in
our research. However, in many ways, remaining entrepreneurial in our research might be easier DEMO than done. Our successes may
be leading us to a competency trap (Levitt and March, 1988) that rewards in the short run playing it safe by using “accepted” theories
and approaches to address increasingly narrow DEMO questions of interest to a smaller audience. This is not to say that this type of
incremental research is not important to the ﬁeld; it is a criticial component. However, if incremental research begins to dominate and
crowd out more transformational research, we run the very real risk that the ﬁeld will stagnate and lose what is “special” about it—that
DEMO, lose that very real and widespread willingness to accept considerable novelty DEMO questioning, theorizing, and testing to generate
new and interesting insights.1
As I think about the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship's future, my purpose in this paper is not to replace Venkataraman's (Shane and
Venkataraman, DEMO; Venkataraman, 1997) or others' (e.g., Busenitz et al., DEMO; Carlsson et al., 2013; Davidsson, 2003; Gartner,
1990; Wiklund et al., 2011) delineation of entrepreneurship's distinctive domain with DEMO own but, rather, to highlight potential
sources of vitality for its future. This vitality will likely continually change the boundaries of what is DEMO as entrepreneurship.2
Although research opportunities remain somewhat uncertain and many potential avenues could be explored to fuel and maintain
the vitality of the ﬁeld DEMO entrepreneurship, I propose that future contributions from entrepreneurial studies will come DEMO viewing
the entrepreneurial process as one of generating and reﬁning potential opportunities through building, engaging, and transforming
communities of inquiry; as one constituted by a pattern of activities that is dynamic, recursive, and immersed DEMO entrepreneurial prac-
tice; as one in which the head engages the DEMO and the heart engages the head; and as one of motivations DEMO solely those of
ﬁnancial goals. I believe that such an approach will increase our understanding of how entrepreneurial action will meet some of
the DEMO challenges of our time and thereby make important contributions to the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship.
First, there is an established body of research on entrepreneurial cognition that has focused on an individual's beliefs about wheth-
er DEMO situation represents an opportunity (e.g., Autio et al., 2013; Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Gregoire, Barr and Shepherd, 2010;
☆ DEMO would like to thank Ted Baker, Denis Gregoire, Rob Mitchell, DEMO Patzelt, and Trent Williams for their valuable comments on an earlier DEMO of thispaper.
1 I realize that some could make the case that we have too little incremental research (e.g., calls for more replication DEMO), but thinking about future entrepreneur-
ship research, I am far DEMO concerned with “exploitation” crowding out “exploration” (consistent with March [1991]) than I am of the reverse.
2 Therefore, as researchers perhaps, we DEMO be less concerned with whether our current entrepreneurial work ﬁts within published domain statements of the ﬁeld
because the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship has likely DEMO “moved,” and our current research might have the opportunity to make a contribution by further shifting its
boundaries (in retrospect).

Gregoire et al., 2010; Gruber et al., 2013; DEMO et al., 2002; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006; Tang et al., 2012). Based on its cognitive
psychology underpinnings, it is not DEMO that most of this research focuses on individuals' attributes (Baron and Ensley, 2006;
Mitchell et al., 2002; Shane, 2000; Shepherd and DeTienne, 2005) or their cognitive processes (Bryant, 2007; Busenitz and Barney,
1997; Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Gregoire et al., 2010) to explain how individuals notice, interpret, and/or evaluate DEMO op-
portunities. To complement this body of research and extend our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena, future entrepreneur-
ship can further explore a more interactive perspective of the entrepreneurial process: how a community of inquiry contributes to the
reﬁnement of a potential opportunity and changes in the entrepreneur's DEMO, how potential opportunities transform a community of
inquiry, and the mutual adjustment between the entrepreneur's mind and the community through an evolving DEMO opportunity.
Second, research has substantially increased our understanding of the outcomes (Bornstein, 2004; Dean and McMullen, 2007; Foss
et al., 2007; Roberts and Woods, 2005) and the antecedents of entrepreneurial action (DEMO, 2007; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006;
Meek et al., 2010; Mitchell and Shepherd, 2010). Complementing this research on entrepreneurial action, scholars will make impor-
tant contributions by investigating the many activities underlying DEMO single entrepreneurial action. Speciﬁcally, following the lead of
research on nascent DEMO that focuses less on the single act of exploiting an opportunity and more on the series of activities
involved in the emergence of a DEMO ﬁrm (Delmar and Shane, 2004; Gartner, 1985; Lichtenstein et DEMO, 2007), future research can focus
on activity as the key DEMO of analysis. This research will help break down entrepreneurial action into its constituent activities and ex-
plore the inter-relationships between activities, the inter-relationship between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the motiva-
tion to DEMO an opportunity belief, and the inter-relationship between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge to
form an opportunity belief. In doing so, such research will begin to build a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.
Third, we have a good understanding of the role of cognition in performing tasks central to the entrepreneurial process, such as
identifying (e.g., Ardichvili et al., 2003; Corbett, 2005; Gregoire DEMO al., 2010), evaluating (e.g., Haynie et al., 2009; DEMO et al., 2002),
and acting (e.g., Autio et al., 2013; Hmieleski and Baron, 2008; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006) DEMO potential opportunities. Further-
more, we are beginning to gain a deeper DEMO of the role of emotion in an entrepreneur's cognitive processing of information
for important tasks (e.g., Baron, 2008; Foo et al., 2009; Shepherd, 2003; Welpe et al., 2012). By building DEMO the notion of hot
cognition—for example, that emotions inﬂuence cognitive processing DEMO the entrepreneurial context (Cardon et al., 2012)—future re-
search has the opportunity to make an important contribution by exploring the opposite relationship—namely, investigating the role
of entrepreneurial activity in generating emotions (both positive and negative) primarily through engaging in challenging entrepre-
neurial tasks. Based on (DEMO in conjunction with) such research, future research will begin to explore the reciprocal relationship be-
tween cognitions and emotions as individuals engage in DEMO entrepreneurial tasks over time.
Finally, recent developments in the ﬁeld of DEMO have come from scholars exploring outcomes of entrepreneurial actions
that beneﬁt others—for example, research on social entrepreneurship (e.g., Dacin et al., 2011; Dees, 1998; Mair and Marti, 2006;
McMullen, 2011; Peredo and Chrisman, 2006), environmental entrepreneurship (e.g., Dean and McMullen, DEMO; Meek et al., 2010;
York and Venkataraman, 2010), DEMO sustainable development (e.g., Hall et al., 2010; Shepherd and Patzelt, 2011). Substantial contribu-
tions to these streams of research are likely to come from research that builds on and extends the compassion organizing (e.g., Dutton,
2003; Dutton et al., 2006; George, 2013; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius et al., 2008) and prosocial motivation (e.g., Batson, 1998; De Dreu, 2006;
Grant, DEMO, 2008; Grant and Berry, 2011; Grant and Sumanth, 2009) literatures by exploring the unique role of entrepreneurial actions
and their underlying DEMO That is, entrepreneurship scholars are well positioned to explore how suffering DEMO be alleviated when
individuals go beyond relying on the normal routines of well-established organizations by creating new routines within established or-
ganizations or by DEMO new organizations, how suffering can be alleviated in non-organizational members, and how actors in resource
devastated environments can still create new ventures to DEMO others' suffering. Over and above (or in conjunction with) exploring
DEMO' capabilities to act entrepreneurially to alleviate others' suffering, future research DEMO likely make important contributions by
building on and extending the notion of prosocial motivation to entrepreneurs' compassionate venturing and the enhancement of the
entrepreneur's well-being.
In the sections that follow, I develop each of these sources of continued vitality in more detail. However, it is important to note that they
are not the only potential sources of vitality going DEMO I focus on these four sources as a basis for future research for four main reasons.
(1) These four potential sources are not DEMO with the extant literature, which allows us to build on what DEMO gone before but, at the
same time, helps us overcome (DEMO sidestep) current and future obstacles to existing streams of research. (2) Regardless of the deﬁnition of
the ﬁeld, the notions of opportunity DEMO the actions of individuals are invariably central in entrepreneurship research discussions. The
focus of this paper is consistent with these fundamentals. (3) Each DEMO is grounded in rich scholarship from another ﬁeld
(e.g., theories, DEMO, statistical techniques, and so on), which enables us—through combination, DEMO, and creativity—to
(hopefully) extend both the entrepreneurship ﬁeld and the DEMO ﬁelds. (4) We know that the nature of potential opportunities is related
to an individual's (or an organization's) prior knowledge, and the same principle applies to me when I think about future DEMO oppor-
tunities. Although these themes required me to step outside my comfort zone, they are still very much related to my idiosyncratic knowl-
edge of the psychology of entrepreneurship. There are many great research opportunities within DEMO outside these topics.
A more interactive perspective of entrepreneurial opportunity
The dominant cognitive psychology perspective
Although there is an ongoing debate about the nature DEMO deﬁnition of opportunities (e.g., Davidsson, 2003; Dimov, 2011; Gartner
et al., 2003; McMullen et al., 2007; Short et al., 2010), it is commonly acknowledged that opportunities are uncertain ex ante (Knight,
1921) and can only be determined post hoc. Accordingly, DEMO research on entrepreneurial opportunities has largely focused on an

individual's beliefs about whether a situation (e.g., a DEMO in a technology or market) represents an opportunity for someone
(i.e., third-person opportunity) (e.g., Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010; Grégoire and DEMO, 2012; Gregoire et al., 2010; Gruber
et al., 2013; Shepherd and DeTienne, 2005) and/or whether it represents an opportunity DEMO him or her personally (i.e., ﬁrst-person
opportunity) (e.g., Autio DEMO al., 2013; Fitzsimmons and Douglas, 2011; Haynie et al., DEMO; Keh et al., 2002; Mitchell and Shepherd,
2010; Tang et al., 2012). The formation of opportunity beliefs (ﬁ rst- DEMO/or third-person opportunity beliefs) (McMullen and
Shepherd, 2006) are typically explained in terms of cognitive attributes, such as prior knowledge (e.g., Shane, 2000; Shepherd and
DeTienne, 2005) and expert prototypes (Baron and Ensley, 2006), and are generally explored in terms of cognitive processes, such
as heuristics (Bryant, 2007; Busenitz and Barney, 1997), metaphors (Cornelissen and Clarke, 2010), and structural alignments
(Grégoire and Shepherd, 2012; Gregoire et al., 2010). Given the cognitive nature of this research, it is not surprising that the emphasis
has been on how individuals notice and attempt to make sense of signals DEMO potential opportunity (with social resources sometimes
playing a supporting role). DEMO propose that this cognitive research on opportunity belief can be complemented and expanded by future
research taking a more interactive perspective. Such future research DEMO provide additional insights into the reﬁnement of potential
opportunities, the transformations DEMO communities around those potential opportunities, and the mutual adjustment involving the
DEMO
An interactive perspective of the identiﬁcation and reﬁnement of a potential opportunity
Although there are a number of social perspectives that could make future DEMO to our understanding of the formation of
opportunity beliefs (e.g., collective cognition [Shalley and Perry‐Smith, 2008; West, 2007], relational capital [Hite, 2005; Yli‐Renko
et al., 2001], brokerage [Burt, 2005; Stinchﬁeld et al., 2013], crescive conditions [Dorado and Ventresca, 2013], and social DEMO
[ Sorenson and Audia, 2000]), one approach that seems to DEMO considerable potential is thinking of a potential opportunity in
terms of a process of social interaction (between a community and the entrepreneur) rather DEMO solely as an outcome of thinking
(in the mind of the DEMO). This is not to suggest that the mind of the individual is not important; clearly it is. However, by
shifting the focus DEMO the knowledge structure (i.e., schema [e.g., Corbett and Hmieleski, 2007; Krueger, 2003], mental models
[e.g., Hill and Levenhagen, 1995; DEMO, 2007], scripts [e.g., Mitchell et al., 2000; Smith et DEMO, 2009], or prototypes [Baron and
Ensley, 2006]) to the embodiment of knowledge between an entrepreneur and a community, we will likely gain more clarity about
the important role of mutual adjustment between the two, leading to a deeper understanding of how potential opportunities are de-
veloped DEMO reﬁned.
Speciﬁ cally, while a potential opportunity can be generated through DEMO abductive process in the mind of an individual
( Swedberg, 2009), the idea for a potential opportunity is likely to be triggered by an individual's experiencing the world and
must then be tested back DEMO that context—that is, “ (ideas) must be tested against the DEMO they are intended to unpack”
(Prawat, 1995: 17). This DEMO of a potential opportunity involves subjecting it “ to a community whose standards allow us to
correct and revise our ideas” ( Pardales and DEMO, 2006: 302). A community of inquiry for a potential opportunity could repre-
sent potential stakeholders that provide feedback on the veracity of DEMO potential opportunity (Autio et al., 2013). For example, a
DEMO check on a potential opportunity can come in the form of a community made up of other entrepreneurs, ﬁnanciers, tech-
nologists, consumers, DEMO suppliers (Klofsten, 2005; Kloppenberg, 1989; Seixas, 1993; Wilson, 1990). Experiencing criticism
from the community is likely to raise doubt DEMO the entrepreneur's mind, which informs and motivates him or her DEMO change
the potential opportunity or abandon it. As the potential opportunity is shaped and reﬁ ned, the entrepreneur further tests it
against socially veriﬁ able facts. Moreover, the community itself may be transformed as a result of interacting with the potential
opportunity. When the members of a community DEMO inquiry come together in agreement, there is belief in the potential DEMO
tunity (Autio et al., 2013).
Potential opportunity of the mind and of the world
A more interactive perspective of opportunity is consistent DEMO pragmatism, which involves a number of key assumptions.
First, there is a world independent of individuals' minds, which people can develop beliefs DEMO (Peirce, 1955). Second, indi-
viduals (i.e., entrepreneurs, scholars, and all others) can only access the real world through the DEMO world (Peirce, 1955);
therefore, the two are intertwined (DEMO, 1994). Finally, people strive for truth but never achieve it. What the “community
of inquiry believes is the truth” is the current DEMO opinion, which itself is provisional (Haskel, 1984; Seixas, 1993)DEMO These as-
sumptions have implications for entrepreneurship research. While studies of opportunity have been classiﬁed as taking the per-
spective that opportunities are either DEMO or created and that there are contexts in which creation dominates discovery
and vice versa (Alvarez and Barney, 2007), an interaction perspective DEMO opportunity offers a different path for future research
(consistent with Dewey'DEMO (1939) characterization of the mind– world dualism). Under this perspective, potential opportunities
involve the inter-relationship (i.e., mutual adjustment) of the DEMO and the world— potential opportunities are not the exclusive
domain of one or the other. Indeed, Gergen (1994: 129) explained how the DEMO (i.e., division and isolation) between the
mind and the world DEMO a vexing problem: “ When a real world is to be DEMO ected by a mental world and the only means of
determining the match is via the mental world, the real world will always remain opaque and the relationship between the
two inexplicable.” Future research can contribute DEMO the understanding of opportunity by conceiving potential opportunities
as plausible ways of thinking and talking about the world that prove useful (through action) DEMO themselves are tentatively
held and subject to revision as they enter and re-enter the environment.

Research opportunities from a more interactive perspective of entrepreneurial opportunity
DEMO contributing to the reﬁnement of a potential opportunity
Consistent with this interactive view of opportunity identiﬁcation and reﬁnement, the notion of potential opportunity is not solely
in the mind of its initial creator but is also DEMO in a community. I believe that this notion opens up a number of interesting pos-
sibilities for future research. For example, to the extent that an opportunity does not come fully formed, the potential opportunity that
is initially identiﬁed will likely change due to the social forces of DEMO community of inquiry. What makes up a community for a particular
potential opportunity? Speciﬁcally, who constitutes this community, how is it formed, DEMO does it change over time (in composition
and in mind), DEMO why are some communities more inﬂuential in “changing” a potential opportunity than others? What are the en-
trepreneurs' different strategies for constructing, engaging, and learning from communities of inquiry, and why (and when) DEMO some
entrepreneurs more effective at constructing, engaging, and learning from communities of inquiry than others?
Although a potential opportunity will likely change DEMO a result of feedback from the community, it is important to DEMO a deeper
understanding of the nature of this feedback and the resulting changes. How dramatically does a potential opportunity change as
the result of DEMO interaction with the community, and does the amount of change decrease DEMO time—consistent with the notion of
reﬁnement— or is there a different pattern by which it evolves over time (e.g., some form of punctuated DEMO model in
which there are periods of incremental reﬁnement followed by radical change)? Is the change so great that the eventual opportunity
has DEMO resemblance to its original form (I certainly have research papers that DEMO gone through such a substantial transformation
during the peer review process)? Are there patterns of resistance to community-driven changes, and what inﬂuence (DEMO any) do those
have on the development, reﬁnement, or transformation DEMO the potential opportunity?
Potential opportunities transforming communities of inquiry
The discussion above largely suggests a unidirectional ﬂow of information—from the community to the DEMO such that only
the individual's mind changes from feedback about the potential opportunity. However, the community of inquiry—and more gener-
ally the external environment (i.e., the world)—is likely also changed from being exposed DEMO the potential opportunity. That is, in the
process of testing the DEMO of a potential opportunity, there is a change in the creator'DEMO mind about the potential opportunity and a
change in the world in which the potential opportunity is situated. Therefore, when it comes to understanding opportunity dynamics
from a more interaction-based perspective, the research challenge is not so much to determine when or whether the potential oppor-
tunity is DEMO the “mind” or in the “world” but to consider both sides of the interaction; the mind and the world are inextricably linked as
a “functional unit” through a process of mutual adjustment (Dewey, 1939).
DEMO research can further explore these notions through an extension of user innovation to user entrepreneurship (Shah and
Tripsas, 2007). For example, rodeo kayaking is an example of a group of individuals seeing a potential DEMO to modify their
kayaks so they could do tricks like enter waves (in the river) sideways and backwards. People saw them doing these DEMO and
asked the riders whether they would make them one of these special kayaks. The potential opportunity for rodeo kayaks was reﬁned
to include DEMO development of plastic hulls and center-buoyant squirt boats, which allowed “ﬂashier DEMO on steeper and more dan-
gerous runs” and “brought media attention to the sport and a growing number of people [trying] out rodeo kayaking” (Baldwin et al.,
2006: 1295). The idea of rodeo kayaking changed the way others thought about the sport and where the sport DEMO be played
(e.g., steeper rivers). The opportunity associated with rodeo kayaking originated in one individual's mind, but it was developed by
a community of users, which itself was changing as a result of the development of the potential opportunity. The rodeo kayaking op-
portunity illustrates DEMO notion of mutual adjustment well: the constant reﬁnement of a potential DEMO between the mind of
the creator(s) (which changed over time) and the community of users and spectators (which changed over time)DEMO
Consistent with the call above for research about how a potential opportunity changes depending on interactions with a commu-
nity, future research can make an important contribution to the entrepreneurship ﬁeld by generating a deeper understanding DEMO how
and why a potential opportunity transforms a community. How do changes in the nature of a potential opportunity change the
community—in its composition, collective mind, collective actions, and so on? What if we challenge the implicit assumption that
there is only one community or that the DEMO is homogenous in how it is transformed by a potential opportunity? DEMO it
morphs in one direction, but maybe it bifurcates, and the entrepreneur needs to decide which branch to take (which in turn trans-
forms the community)? Perhaps there are multiple communities, and each is transformed differently by the same potential opportu-
nity, or maybe the potential opportunity becomes two different potential opportunities—one for each community. Of course, before a
study can explore the notion of different communities or sub-communities, it will need to offer a clear deﬁnition and
operationalization of a “community, or communities for a potential opportunity.”
Mutual adjustment between the entrepreneur's DEMO and community
Future research can explore mutual adjustment—the ongoing reciprocal relationship of changes in the individual's mind and trans-
formations of the community DEMO the evolution of a potential opportunity. What are the mechanisms that start and perpetuate
this reciprocal relationship of the individual and the community in DEMO development and reﬁnement of the potential opportunity?
When does the process of reﬁning a potential opportunity stop such that the individual decides to DEMO exploit” the potential oppor-
tunity, or even when in “full exploitation” DEMO, does the potential opportunity continue to be changed (further transforming the
mind of the entrepreneur and transforming the community)? Perhaps there is DEMO in this outcome: some entrepreneurs and
some communities in some situations DEMO always “updating,” whereas this is not the case for other entrepreneurs, communities,
and/or situations. Naturally, gaining a deeper understanding of DEMO, perpetuating, and terminating the “interaction” process of

DEMO Fig. 1, I offer a sketch of a more interaction-based perspective DEMO entrepreneurial opportunities. Although there are many re-
search opportunities possible from taking a more interaction-based perspective, I propose that important future research avenues
worth exploring include (1) how experiencing the world (through actions) leads DEMO abducting an entrepreneurial idea, (2) how an
entrepreneurial idea generates DEMO on a potential opportunity, (3) how acting on a potential DEMO informs the individual's
belief (or reduces doubt), (4) DEMO a community of inquiry veriﬁes the potential opportunity, (5) how DEMO from the commu-
nity of inquiry generates changes to the potential opportunity and the individual's actions for experiencing the world, (6) how chang-
es in belief/doubt reﬁne the potential opportunity and the decision DEMO abandon it, and (7) how the potential opportunity transforms
the DEMO of inquiry.
Entrepreneurship that is more activity based
Toward a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action
Entrepreneurial action continues to be of considerable DEMO to researchers (Autio et al., 2013; Brettel et al., 2012; McKelvie et al.,
2011; Meek et al., 2010; Mitchell DEMO Shepherd, 2010). Entrepreneurial action refers to “behavior in response to DEMO judgmental decision
under uncertainty about a possible opportunity for proﬁt” (McMullen DEMO Shepherd, 2006: 134). These actions can generate economic
gains and losses for the entrepreneur (Foss et al., 2007; Klein, 2008), preserve (Dean and McMullen, 2007) and/or destroy the natural
DEMO (Dorfman and Dorfman, 1993; Tietenberg, 2000), preserve (Bornstein, 2004; Roberts and Woods, 2005) and/or destroy
the culture of communities (Schuler et al., 1998), and create (Bornstein, 2004; Dacin et al., 2011) and/or destroy (Khan et al., DEMO)
value for society. As illustrated by these studies, there can DEMO a variety of outcomes or consequences of entrepreneurial action to pur-
sue a potential opportunity.
Although scholars are understandably interested in the ultimate outcomes DEMO entrepreneurial action (as discussed above), those
interested in nascent entrepreneurship DEMO less on the single act of exploiting an opportunity and more on the series of actions in-
volved in the emergence of a new DEMO (Delmar and Shane, 2004; Gartner, 1985; Lichtenstein et al., 2007). Indeed, nascent entrepre-
neurs engage in a number of activities, including those that make their businesses more tangible to others, such DEMO, for example, they
look for facilities and equipment, seek and DEMO ﬁnancial support, form a legal entity, organize a team, purchase DEMO and equip-
ment, and devote full time to the business (Carter et al., 1996: 151). However, there is more work to be done in understanding the
“why” underlying these activities of organizational emergence DEMO well as the nature of the inter-relationship between these activities.

6 Editorial
A continuation of this line of thinking is to acknowledge DEMO entrepreneurial action can be thought of as a dynamic, highly iterative
DEMO of engaging activities and experiences that inform and are informed by a potential opportunity. From the perspective of
entrepreneuring as a series of activities DEMO part of the entrepreneurial process, activity is the key unit of DEMO In this light, research
could explore key activities and their outcomes DEMO provide an understanding of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action. With-
out an understanding of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action, the picture of the entrepreneurial process is more linear,
coarse grained, and detached from everyday life, providing little insight into the practice of entrepreneurship. Rather, with an DEMO
sis on activities, the picture of the entrepreneurial process is one DEMO is more dynamic, ﬁne grained, and immersed.
As detailed above in my call for a more interaction-based perspective to entrepreneurship research, the reﬁnement of a potential
opportunity generates (and reﬂects) changes in the originator'DEMO mind and changes to its community. These changes are the result of a
series of inter-related activities. For example, to the extent that interaction with the community of inquiry leads to or maintains some
level of DEMO over the veracity of the entrepreneurial idea—experienced as not knowing (Locke DEMO al., 2008)—this irritant motivates
further inquiry. Inquiry represents the “activity DEMO resolving genuine doubt in order to arrive at stable beliefs” (Locke DEMO al., 2008: 908).
That is, doubt motivates activities that DEMO (through changes in the individual's mind) the reﬁnement of the entrepreneurial idea.
Doubt can be considered “nothing less than an opportunity to DEMO the present” (Shanley, 2005: viii) tohelpmovetowardamore
fertile idea (Paavola, 2004).
Future research on the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action
Breaking down DEMO action into constituent activities
I propose that future research exploring the many activities that constitute entrepreneurial action will make a substantial contri-
bution to DEMO ﬁeld of entrepreneurship because it will provide the basis for theorizing and testing micro-foundation models of entre-
preneurial action. For example, Lumpkin and Dess (1996: 136) noted that the “essential act of entrepreneurship is new entry. New
entry can be accomplished by entering new or established markets DEMO new or existing goods or services. New entry is the act of
launching a new venture, either by a start-up ﬁrm, through an DEMO ﬁrm, or via internal corporate venturing.” To complement
this research on DEMO entry, future research can focus on the series of activities that DEMO to new entry, activities that originate from
a guess and activities DEMO reﬁne and transform a potential opportunity toward the exploitation of the believed opportunity (including,
in some cases, the activities associated with the DEMO of a new organization). Future research can explore the ﬁner-grained activ-
ities that make up broader notions of entrepreneurial action and the links DEMO these activities. Such research would offer the basis
for an important contribution to the ﬁeld because although there has been some recognition that a DEMO opportunity may change
over time (e.g., Dimov, 2007; McMullen and Dimov, 2013; Sarasvathy, 2001), there has been little investigation of the activities in-
volved in these changes. The emphasis has been either DEMO a somewhat fully formed entrepreneurial idea (with only minor changes,
DEMO any at all [Gruber et al., 2013]) or on a mindset as an antecedent to these activities (e.g., effectual logic [Sarasvathy, 2001]). For ex-
ample, Shane investigated eight individuals who had discovered different opportunities to exploit a common technology (three di-
mensional printing process). The implicit assumption was that opportunities are recognized in a more or DEMO fully formed state, a
state ready for exploitation. That is, when an entrepreneur describes the opportunity, this single description applies to both what is
initially recognized and what is assessed (Gruber et al., 2013)DEMO
Future research can complement our understanding of whether or not to exploit a focal potential opportunity by exploring the ac-
tivities involved from the DEMO of a potential opportunity, its continuous evaluation and reﬁnement, and its eventual exploita-
tion. This perspective recognizes that a potential opportunity begins as DEMO guess that is only held tentatively yet still guides subsequent
activities. These activities reﬁne and transform the initial entrepreneurial idea. Rather than the potential DEMO opportunity
changing infrequently and/or minimally, I suspect that in many DEMO, an entrepreneurial idea is likely to change frequently and sub-
stantially. DEMO important way to understand these changes in a potential opportunity is to focus on the activities that combine to shape
the potential opportunity and DEMO entrepreneur's (and the community's) belief in it. The individual's (and the community's) doubts
and beliefs are likely to DEMO important implications for these activities (and therefore to a theory of DEMO micro-foundations of entre-
preneurial action), to which we now turn.
Role of opportunity doubt and belief in entrepreneurial activities
There are likely activities DEMO by doubt as well as activities related to belief. What are the activities stimulated by doubt:
what is activated to resolve doubt, to what effect, and how does the nature of these activities change as doubt is resolved to form a
ﬁrst-person opportunity belief? Are some activities more likely to “reverse” a belief by re-inserting doubt (and perhaps further reﬁne-
ment of the potential opportunity), and why are some individuals DEMO likely to engage in these activities than others? This perspec-
tive DEMO attention to the many different activities involved in the entrepreneurial process: DEMO are activities in probing an
uncertain environment (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997; McGrath, 1999), activities in combining and recombining resources to generate
DEMO opportunities (Baker and Nelson, 2005; Baker et al., 2003), activities that engage the community and respond to that en-
gagement (Chandra and Coviello, 2010; Haeﬂiger et al., 2010; Shah and Tripsas, 2007), activities to test the veracity of an opportunity
conjecture (Shane and Eckhardt, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2012), activities in exploiting the potential opportunity through the emer-
gence of a new organization (Carter et al., 1996; Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Lichtenstein et al., 2007), and so on. As indicated by
the citations above, entrepreneurship scholars have made important progress in exploring some of these activities, but in many
ways, they have only touched the tip of the iceberg; there is still much to do.

Next steps
In Fig. 2, I present some of the important aspects of the above discussion to provide a sketch of a DEMO activity-based perspective
underlying entrepreneurial action. The ﬁgure builds on the basic model of entrepreneurial action (McMullen and Shepherd, 2006),
and research on the activities that underlie the formation of opportunity beliefs holds the promise DEMO building toward a theory of
the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action. Although there are many research opportunities possible from taking a more
activity-based perspective, I propose that important future research avenues worth exploring include (1) which DEMO lead to
the identiﬁcation of what is believed (or doubted) to be an opportunity (third- and/or ﬁrst-person opportunity), (2) how and why
an individual's prior knowledge impacts the types of activities DEMO to form an opportunity belief (third- and/or ﬁrst-person
opportunity), (3) how and why the nature of an individual's motivation impacts the types of activities undertaken to form an oppor-
tunity belief (third- and/or ﬁrst-person opportunity), (4) how the inter-relationship between activities DEMO to an opportunity
belief (third- and/or ﬁrst-person opportunity), (5) how and why speciﬁc activities inﬂuence an individual's prior knowledge and mo-
tivation (which in turn can inﬂuence subsequent activities), (6) how and why changed knowledge in the evaluation stage impacts
knowledge in DEMO attention stage for the identiﬁcation of subsequent potential third-person opportunities, and (7) how and why
the changed motivation of the evaluation stage impacts motivation in the attention stage for the identiﬁcation of subsequent third-
person DEMO
Entrepreneurship that is more cognitively hot
Entrepreneurial cognition and the effect of emotion on these cognitive processes
For a considerable time, researchers have believed that individuals' cognitive abilities are an important driver of entrepreneurial
action (DEMO reviews, see Gregoire et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2002). It appears that individuals are more capable of navigating aspects
of DEMO entrepreneurial process (i.e., recognition, evaluation, and action) when they DEMO considerable knowledge (Davidsson and
Honig, 2003; Shane, 2000), have access to information (Fiet, 2007; Hoang and Antoncic, 2003), DEMO make decisions (Eisenhardt,
1989; Forbes, 2005), and are DEMO ﬂexible (Haynie et al., 2010). More recently, researchers have DEMO how positive emo-
tions facilitate the entrepreneurial process (Baron, 2008; DEMO et al., 2009) and how negative emotions obstruct it (Shepherd, 2003;
Shepherd et al., 2011). As an extension of this research, there are substantial opportunities to explore the inﬂuence of the interacting
relationships between emotion and cognition to enhance the vitality of entrepreneurship research.
DEMO research on the role of entrepreneurial activity in emotions
Although, as DEMO ﬁeld, entrepreneurship is gaining a deeper understanding of the impact of DEMO on entrepreneurial cognition,
we know little about the reverse—the role of entrepreneurial cognition on emotions—and as a result, there is lack of sufﬁcient under-
standing of the reciprocal relationship between the two. Entrepreneurial scholars who DEMO new theoretical perspectives to deep-
en the understanding of cognitive– emotion processes and examine them empirically have the potential to make important
contributions to DEMO ﬁeld.
Entrepreneurial activities generating positive emotions
An important implication from positive psychology research for entrepreneurship is that the generation of positive emotions is of
DEMO importance for individuals as they adjust and progress in their lives (DEMO, 1998, 2001; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi,
2000; Seligman et al., 2005). However, because extant research has focused primarily on the DEMO of positive emotions
(e.g., Baron, 2008; Brundin et al., DEMO; Cardon et al., 2009; Grichnik et al., 2010), we know little about how positive emotions are gen-
erated in the entrepreneurial DEMO Given that the beneﬁts of positive emotions are likely to be particularly inﬂuential in the entre-
preneurial context (Baron, 2008; Cardon et al., 2012), it becomes important to gain a deeper understanding of how individuals
generate positive emotions and how these positive emotions inﬂuence subsequent cognitions, emotions, and activities within the en-
trepreneurial process. Furthermore, although entrepreneurs DEMO often categorized by their emotions (e.g., highly passionate) (Cardon
et al., 2005, 2009) or their cognitive abilities (Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001; Ardichvili et al., 2003; Corbett, 2005; Ucbasaran et al., 2008)
and these differences are used to explain entrepreneurial action and performance, there is an opportunity to complement these be-
tween-individual differences to investigate within-individual variance— namely, how cognitive processing and emotions change
over time throughout the entrepreneurial process (for a good example, see Foo et DEMO, 2009).
Challenging entrepreneurial tasks and the generation of positive emotions
DEMO changes can signal potential opportunities (Dutton and Duncan, 1987; Grégoire DEMO Shepherd, 2012; Shane, 2000).
For entrepreneurial action to happen, however, the individual ﬁrst needs to attend to signals of such changes (Dutton, 1993; Shepherd
et al., 2007; Tripsas and Gavetti, DEMO) and then identify them as implying a potential opportunity (Ardichvili et al., 2003; Gaglio and
Katz, 2001; Gregoire et al., 2010; Ucbasaran et al., 2008). Recognizing a potential opportunity is an DEMO yet challenging task. Op-
portunities are rarely self-evident (like ﬁnding $20 DEMO the pavement); they require connecting a new means of supply with an existing
yet sometimes latent market demand, an emerging market demand with an existing means of supply, or a new market demand with a
new means of supply (Sarasvathy et al., 2010). For the DEMO, this represents a cognitive process “to make sense of signals of
DEMO (e.g., new information about new conditions) to form beliefs regarding DEMO or not enacting a course of action could

lead to net beneﬁts (for instance, in terms of DEMO, growth, competitive jockeying and/or other forms of individual or organizational
gains)” (Gregoire et al., 2010: 415) for someone who DEMO willing and able. For example, the cognitive processes of structural alignment
DEMO been found to be used in the formation of opportunity beliefs (DEMO et al., 2010) and, while cognitively demanding
(Blanchette and Dunbar, 2001; Catrambone and Holyoak, 1989; Holland et al., 1986; DEMO et al., 1994), can lead to mental leaps
(Holyoak and Thagard, 1995). Interestingly, however, successfully completing cognitively demanding tasks is likely to generate pos-
itive emotions (Blood and Zatorre, 2001; Russell, 2003; Russell and Milne, 1997). Seen in this light, DEMO interesting research
questions on the role of emotions arise. Do entrepreneurs believe that progress in identifying potential opportunities is a challenging
task, and if they do, does this generate positive emotions? What types of positive DEMO arise, and how do these positive emotions
inﬂuence subsequent cognitions and DEMO?
According to research in the positive psychology tradition, positive emotions DEMO an individual's performance at cognitive
tasks, and positive emotions have DEMO found to broaden individuals' scope of attention (Derryberry and Tucker, DEMO; Fredrickson
and Branigan, 2005; Isen and Daubman, 1984); enhance receptivity to new information (Estrada et al., 1997); facilitate cognitive DEMO
cesses that are more creative (Isen et al., 1987)and ﬂexible (Baumann and Kuhl, 2005; Isen and Daubman, 1984); and DEMO more
physical, intellectual, and social resources (Fredrickson, 2000), including creating new relationships and strengthening existing rela-
tionships (Fredrickson et al., DEMO; Waugh and Fredrickson, 2006).
To the extent that positive emotions generated from making progress on a challenging entrepreneurial task increase an
individual'DEMO scope of attention, cognition, and (access to) resources, how DEMO these impact subsequent activities in the entrepreneurial
process? Does initial progress DEMO a positive spiral of positive emotions and subsequent progress through the mechanisms of in-
creased scope of attention, cognitive ﬂexibility, and social resources? What are the conditions that start this spiral? For example, per-
DEMO individuals need to meet a threshold level of challenge before generating positive emotions. What is that threshold, how does it
differ across individuals, DEMO does it change for an individual for different entrepreneurial tasks? What DEMO the conditions that perpet-
uate this spiral? Perhaps the threshold of DEMO to generate positive emotions needs to increase with each subsequent task, DEMO
example, to overcome habituation effects (Ashforth and Kreiner, 2002; Belschak et al., 2006) and to stimulate an emotional reaction.
However, does the generation of positive emotions present limitations, such as escalation of commitment, unwillingness to listen to
community input, and so on?
It DEMO also important to understand what factors stop this spiral of positive emotions and entrepreneurial progress. There could be
factors that obstruct progress—for example, a surprise, such as a negative environmental jolt, bad luck, or another task that requires
urgent attention, cognition, and other resources—and/or factors DEMO diminish or eliminate the generation of positive emotions—for
example, other events (work or non-work related) that generate negative emotions that take precedence over positive emotions in
cognitive processing, such as a serious injury at work, the loss of a loved one, or marital problems. The reverse DEMO also possible:
non-work-related events that generate positive emotions (e.g., marital bliss, sports team success, positive recreational experiences,
and so on) may help undo negative emotions at work and thereby enhance progress on DEMO tasks.
A reciprocal relationship between challenging entrepreneurial tasks and positive emotions
Future research can offer a more ﬁne-grained understanding of the inter-relationship between progress DEMO positive emotions by
exploring how different positive emotions (e.g., curiosity versus happiness) differentially impact the mechanisms of progress
(e.g., impact the ability to structurally align new means of supply with potential markets). Perhaps DEMO positive emotions
(e.g., curiosity) have a greater impact on individuals' scope of attention than on the other mechanisms (e.g., creativity and DEMO building
of social resources). As an additional example, there could DEMO another set of reciprocal relationships. As positive emotions generate a
greater scope of attention, does this scope of attention have a positive impact on cognitive processes (e.g., creativity, ﬂexibility, and the
generation of diverse DEMO) and on individuals' access to social resources? There are rich DEMO opportunities to explore the
inter-relationships between progress in entrepreneurial tasks and positive emotions and the inter-relationships between the atten-
tional, cognitive, and resource DEMO generated by positive emotions in progress on tasks within the entrepreneurial process.
Challenging entrepreneurial tasks and the generation of negative emotions
Although making progress DEMO a challenging task is likely to generate positive emotions, entrepreneurs may DEMO always feel that
they are making progress (Kim et al., 2015; Kuratko et al., 2014). What are the emotional consequences of DEMO lack of progress? It
could be that positive emotions are not DEMO, so the advantages of positive emotions in the form of a DEMO scope of atten-
tion, greater creativity, and enhanced access to social resources for successfully engaging the entrepreneurial task are not available. It
could DEMO be that experiencing high levels of some positive emotions might have negative performance implications. However, or in
addition to, my colleagues and I DEMO observed that a lack of progress on an entrepreneurial task appears to generate negative emo-
tions (Shepherd et al., 2014), which likely DEMO the scope of attention, diminishes cognitive ﬂexibility and creativity, and socially
isolates the individual (Fredrickson, 2001; Fredrickson et al., 2000; Shepherd et al., 2011). Such a situation may trigger a negative spi-
ral whereby the lack of progress would generate negative emotions that then DEMO progress, which generates further negative
emotions and so on. As much DEMO entrepreneurship scholars are motivated to understand success (and therefore focus on DEMO positive
spirals of positive emotions), it seems important to study the other side of the same coin—failure to progress on an important entre-
DEMO task—for instance, by exploring the inter-relationship between negative emotions and attentional DEMO, creativity, and so-
cial resources. Are there instances when some negative emotions or speciﬁc levels of negative emotions facilitate progress on an
entrepreneurship DEMO? If negative emotions facilitate entrepreneurial progress, what are the mechanisms underlying this relation-
ship (i.e., the “how” and the “why”), and DEMO what conditions do they operate? For example, perhaps at least some negative emo-
tions are necessary to draw an entrepreneur's attention to DEMO focal task and do something about it, but how much attention DEMO

sufﬁcient; how much is too much; and assuming heterogeneity DEMO individuals, why is a speciﬁc level of negative emotion func-
tional DEMO some but dysfunctional for others?
Although it has been argued that positive emotions “undo” negative emotions (Fredrickson, 2001; Fredrickson et al., DEMO), re-
search has found that people can simultaneously experience both high positive and high negative emotions. What is the effect of
this ambivalence DEMO the cognitions required of the current entrepreneurial task and its impact on subsequent tasks and activities?
For example, entrepreneurs may exit their businesses for various reasons, including as the result of successfully achieving their
goals (e.g., selling their business for a large capital gain). Although DEMO successful exit may generate positive emotions, these are likely
intertwined with DEMO emotions associated with terminating the relationship with their businesses and their employees. Similar-
ly, exiting a failing business is likely to generate feelings of grief, yet these feelings might coincide with feelings of relief that the end
has ﬁnally arrived. To what extent do entrepreneurial events create high DEMO and high negative emotions, how do these evolve
independently and conjointly DEMO time, and are some entrepreneurs able to maximize the beneﬁts of DEMO high positive and negative
emotions while minimizing their costs?

In Fig. 3, I present a sketch of a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurship. Although there are many research opportu-
nities possible from DEMO a more cognitively hot perspective, I propose that important future research DEMO worth exploring in-
clude (1) how cognitive functioning impacts progress on a challenging entrepreneurial task; (2) how and why progress on a
challenging task generates positive and/or negative emotional reactions, and how the level of those reactions are affected; (3) how

other tasks; (4) how emotional reactions to DEMO on an entrepreneurial task impact the choice to undertake challenging tasks,

DEMO emotional reactions, and what effect do they have on the entrepreneurial DEMO?

that provides a deeper understanding of how individuals and communities DEMO be helped by entrepreneurial action (e.g., Dacin et al.,
2011; Dees, 1998; Mair and Marti, 2006; McMullen, 2011; Peredo and Chrisman, 2006). Those more interested in the natural environ-
ment have explored why some entrepreneurs generate technologies and products that preserve the DEMO environment (Dean and
McMullen, 2007; Meek et al., 2010; DEMO and Venkataraman, 2010) while some entrepreneurs decide to pursue opportunities that
harm nature (Shepherd et al., 2013). As social and sustainable DEMO research expands, we will ﬁnd new ways in which
entrepreneurial action DEMO and also hurts people, communities, and nature. Consistent with my comments above about the distinc-
tive domain of entrepreneurship, I submit that even if discussions of deﬁnitions of “social entrepreneurship,”“sustainable entrepre-
neurship,” and DEMO entrepreneurship” are interesting, it is important that these discussions not turn DEMO an endless
debate that constrains or kills interesting research because a speciﬁc study does not ﬁt into a pre-determined category of “sustainable”
or “social” DEMO “environmental” entrepreneurship. That is, by remaining open minded about boundaries, especially boundaries of topics
within the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship, we provide the conditions for contributions that can expand our understanding of entrepreneur-
ial phenomena.
Compassion DEMO
To date, the positive psychology perspective has increased our understanding of DEMO to alleviate people's suffering (e.g., Dutton,
2003; Dutton DEMO al., 2006, 2014; George, 2013; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius et al., 2008). Compassion organizing is “a collective response DEMO
a particular incident of human suffering that entails the coordination of individual compassion” and acknowledges that the same
structures and routines used for an DEMO's normal work can be redirected to alleviate a member's suffering (Dutton et al.,
2006: 62). Suffering refers to “the DEMO of pain or loss that evokes a form of anguish that threatens an individual's sense of mean-
ing about his or her personal DEMO (Dutton et al., 2006: 60; see also Sutcliffe and Vogus, 2003) and can result from a number of
different causes, including personal tragedies, work-related events, and disasters (Frost, 2003; Rynes et al., 2012). Organizations are
able to respond compassionately because through existing relationships with organizational members, they are able to collectively
recognize a member's suffering, feel that member's pain, and are in position DEMO respond by redirecting existing procedures and process-
es to alleviate that member's suffering (Dutton et al., 2006; Kanov et al., 2004; Rynes et al., 2012).
There are research opportunities for scholars to build on and extend positive organizational scholarship to gain a deeper under-
DEMO of how entrepreneurial actions can alleviate human suffering. Given that most of the research on compassion organizing
has been generated by scholars from a DEMO organizational perspective, it is not surprising that the research on compassion DEMO
nizing largely assumes the existence of a ﬁrm and focuses on the use of the ﬁrm's “normal” routines for responding to one (or more) of
its members' pain (e.g., Dutton et al., 2006). Entrepreneurship scholars are well equipped to explore compassion organizing beyond
the DEMO of an existing organization and explore actions not limited by existing routines. This is an important extension be-
cause the situations that generate human DEMO may be radically different from an established organization's normal course of ac-
tivities. Furthermore and although compassion organizing refers to alleviating human suffering, entrepreneurship scholars (and
perhaps compassion organizing scholars) will hopefully take a DEMO view and consider suffering in terms of humans, animals, com-
munities, the natural environment, and so on. By doing so, entrepreneurship scholars could make an important contribution to the
understanding of alleviating suffering (broadly deﬁned for the ﬁeld but speciﬁcally deﬁned in a single study) and, at the same time,
extend the boundaries of both entrepreneurship and positive organizational psychology.
Future research on entrepreneurial action alleviating the suffering of DEMO
Beyond the “normal” routines of established organizations
Although there are conditions in which the adaption of an established organization's normal structures and routines DEMO be
highly effective at alleviating a member's suffering (Dutton et DEMO, 2006; Kanov et al., 2004), some events may not DEMO cause
human suffering but may also disable or obstruct an organization from using its “normal” routines for most tasks, including
helping to alleviate its members' suffering (Drabek and McEntire, 2003; Majchrzak et al., 2007). Under these challenging con-
ditions in which established organizations' normal routines are not sufﬁ cient for alleviating suffering, entrepreneurship
scholars can generate new insights into the alleviation of suffering through studying the creation of new DEMO within
established organizations and/or through the creation of new independent organizations (e.g., Miller et al., 2012; Shepherd
and Williams, 2014). For example, future research can begin to address some of the following questions: What are the con-
straints that disable or obstruct an organization's normal routines from alleviating human suffering? Why do some create
new ventures to alleviate human suffering and others do not? Why do some create a new venture within an established ﬁrm
while others create a DEMO organization? Why are the objectives of some ventures focused exclusively on DEMO suffering
while others are focused on multiple objectives (e.g., proﬁ t and alleviating suffering), and how does this inﬂuence effectiveness
(although I realize the challenges in operationalizing effectiveness in this context)? Why are DEMO entrepreneurial activities
and, ultimately, actions more effective at alleviating suffering than others?
Alleviating the suffering of non-organizational members
Prior research has explored DEMO organizations may be effective at responding to their organizational members' suffering (Dutton
et al., 2006: 59;see also Dutton et al., 2014; Gittell et al., 2006; Powley, 2009; Rynes et al., DEMO) because members of the same orga-
nization are more likely to DEMO a colleague's pain (Powley, 2009), have empathy for their colleague who is suffering (Lilius et al.,
2011), and are proximal enough to act to alleviate that suffering (Dutton et al., DEMO). Entrepreneurship scholars can explore suffering

beyond existing organizational boundaries, speciﬁcally how new ventures (within DEMO organizations or newly created inde-
pendent organizations) are rapidly (and what seems spontaneously) created to alleviate suffering. Why are some (individuals, groups,
or organizations) able to notice and understand others' (i.e., DEMO outside an organization's boundaries) suffering while some are not,
DEMO why do some who notice others' suffering create new ventures to DEMO that suffering while some notice yet do not act? What
additional DEMO of community (beyond organizational membership) inﬂuence compassionate responses and in what way? Following
a suffering-inducing event, how are communities deﬁned, created, DEMO led, and what role does entrepreneurial action (and its under-
lying activities) play in this process?
Spontaneous venturing to alleviate others' DEMO
Although the entrepreneurship literature has theorized and found that the emergence of a new organization takes time (Katz and
Gartner, 1988; Liao et al., 2005; Reynolds and Miller, 1992), there is evidence that new ventures can be created almost spontaneously
(only hours or days after an event that causes human suffering) (Shepherd and Williams, 2014). How is the process of new venture
creation expedited so quickly—that is, how is the potential opportunity to alleviate suffering reﬁned, what are the activities involved
in spontaneously creating a new venture to alleviate suffering, which (if any) organizational emergence activities are “skipped” or
modiﬁed, and how are interactions between the entrepreneur and the various communities (e.g., victims DEMO suppliers) facilitated
and processed under such extreme conditions? Not only can this research advance understanding of how entrepreneurial action
can alleviate others' suffering, but it might also provide a great context to be able to explore the activities of organizational emergence
because the time required to follow DEMO track those activities is substantially reduced. (However, I also acknowledge the difﬁculties of
researching ventures created almost spontaneously in the aftermath of a DEMO event—the researcher might have to ﬁnd him- or
herself in the midst of the human suffering to capture these activities.) If scholars can ﬁnd a way to investigate these spontaneous ven-
tures, what can be learned from these extreme contexts that informs our understanding of emergence in more DEMO settings?
Are there “spontaneous acts” in other settings that precede subsequent activity? What form do these acts take? Are they designed
to DEMO temporary or simply probe-like actions designed to explore and get instant feedback? What motivates these actions, and
what are the desired outcomes? Does government have a role to play in fostering compassion venturing, and what form might
that role take?
Resourcefulness for compassionate responding
Current conceptions DEMO compassion emphasize how the fortunate aid the less fortunate (Dutton et DEMO, 2006). Entrepreneurship
scholars have the opportunity to build on the DEMO of knowledge on resourcefulness, such as bricolage (Baker and Nelson, DEMO), ef-
fectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001), improvisation (Baker et al., 2003; Hmieleski and Corbett, 2008), identity (Powell and Baker, DEMO), en-
trepreneurial management (Bradley et al., 2011; Stevenson and DEMO, 1990), and knowledge corridors (Fiet, 2007; Fiet and
Samuelsson, 2000; Hayek, 1945), to understand how resources are acquired, DEMO, and recombined in ways that effectively al-
leviate a speciﬁc form DEMO suffering. Future research can explore how entrepreneurial actions enable the less fortunate—those who are
themselves suffering—to help the unfortunate—others who are suffering. Why are DEMO individuals who are themselves facing high
adversity able to act entrepreneurially to alleviate others' suffering while some individuals are unable to do so? DEMO the one hand, locals
are often in the best position to DEMO because they are already close to the region of adversity (i.e., Bui and Sebastian, 2011; Quarantelli,
1993; Sebastian and Bui, DEMO) and have knowledge about the cause of suffering and how to DEMO it given their insight into the
people involved and the local conditions (Sebastian and Bui, 2009; Shepherd and Williams, 2014; Waugh and Streib, 2006). However,
these locals may also be suffering. What is the impact of alleviating others' suffering on the well-being of the entrepreneurial actor
him- or herself? Does this action result in further risks that could undermine recovery (e.g., failure of a venture)? Could DEMO
ial action be a form of coping that results in a form of recovery?
Prosocial motivation to act entrepreneurially to alleviate others' suffering
People not only need to be able to act to alleviate others' suffering, but they also need to be motivated to do so. What motivates
people to act entrepreneurially to alleviate others' suffering? I believe DEMO explorations to address this question will build on the
prosocial motivation literature. Prosocial motivation is deﬁned as the desire to expend effort based on DEMO concern for helping or contrib-
uting to other people (Batson, 1998; De Dreu, 2006; Grant, 2007, 2008; Grant and Berry, 2011; Grant and Sumanth, 2009) and can
serve multiple goals for those being helped (Batson et al., 2008). As explained by DEMO (2008: 49), prosocial motivation is “amore
temporary psychological state, DEMO it] involves a momentary focus on the goal of protecting and promoting the welfare of other peo-
ple.” The notion of prosocial motivation appears DEMO be a particularly relevant yet under-researched antecedent to the entrepreneurial
actions that alleviate others' suffering (important exceptions include Renko (2013) and Miller DEMO al. (2012)).
Future research can investigate the role of prosocial motivation vis-à-vis other forms of motivation in compassionate venturing.
For example, although prosocial motivation may make up for a lack of intrinsic motivation to DEMO a new venture to alleviate others'
suffering, what is the DEMO effect of this motivational state? Does success in the alleviation of DEMO begin to create intrinsic
motivation for the entrepreneurial tasks of compassion venturing, or does the lack of intrinsic motivation wear the actor down, DEMO
by undermining the effect of prosocial motivation? If it does wear DEMO actor down, what implications does this have for the duration or
DEMO of compassion-oriented ventures? Do individuals need to shift to other types DEMO motivators for ventures to continue? It is
likely also important to DEMO the downside or limitations of prosocial motivation in compassionate venturing. Given that
prosocially motivated individuals are likely to see work as a means of DEMO the ends of beneﬁting others (Grant, 2007, 2008),
are there downsides to an “ends-justiﬁes-the-means” approach to the alleviation of human suffering? Perhaps there are unattended
consequences of cutting corners to alleviate the suffering DEMO a group of individuals: perhaps it comes at the expense of DEMO group of

individuals' suffering, maybe it thwarts a larger (and perhaps more effective) effort to alleviate suffering, and/or perhaps it is DEMO
in the short run but detrimental in the long run. It could be less about whether it is good or bad to ignore constraints DEMO more about
which constraints are ignored and which are abided by. Future research can also explore how potential resource providers come to
notice, assess, and act toward those who are prosocially motivated to alleviate the suffering of others. Are outsiders drawn to
prosocially motivated entrepreneurial actors trying to DEMO the suffering of others? How is prosocial motivation signaled to and
DEMO by outsiders?
Next steps
In Fig. 4, I present some DEMO the important aspects of the above discussion to provide a sketch of entrepreneurship research that is
more compassionate and prosocial. Although there are many DEMO opportunities possible from taking a more compassionate and
prosocial perspective, I DEMO that important future research avenues worth exploring include (1) how and why knowledge of
others' suffering impacts the formation of (third- and/DEMO ﬁrst-person) opportunity beliefs to “do good,” (2) how and DEMO prosocial
motivation impacts the formation of (third- and/or ﬁrst-person) opportunity beliefs to “do good,” (3) what the nature of entrepre-
DEMO actions that exploit a potential opportunity to do good is, (4) how and why different entrepreneurial actions alleviate different
forms of others' DEMO, (5) how and why different entrepreneurial actions sustain different societal DEMO, (6) how entrepre-
neurial action to alleviate suffering and/or DEMO sustainability impacts the entrepreneurial individual him- or herself, (7) how
DEMO why progress in the entrepreneurial process (in terms of gains for DEMO, the entrepreneur, and/or sustainability) impacts the
entrepreneur's knowledge (in particular, knowledge of suffering) and the entrepreneur's motivation (in particular, prosocial motiva-
tion and its interactions with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation) to form subsequent (third and/or ﬁrst-person) opportunity beliefs,
(DEMO) what other entrepreneurial activities impact the effectiveness of compassionate and sustainable DEMO, and (9) what other
forms of suffering compassion venturing can DEMO alleviate.
Discussion and conclusion
Across a number of ﬁelds, there is DEMO tendency to narrowly focus on dominant principles and themes that have the effect of homog-
enizing knowledge creation (in the literature) about a DEMO world (Glynn and Dacin, 2000). Speciﬁcally, Kuhn (2012) DEMO
rized ﬁelds of study by the extent to which they have developed paradigms—“shared theoretical structures and methodological
approaches about which there is a high DEMO of consensus” (Cole, 1983: 112). The more developed a DEMO, the less uncertainty
over the production of knowledge and the less DEMO, both of which are believed to facilitate a ﬁeld's growth (Pfeffer,
1993). That is, consensus over fundamental assumptions (of DEMO nature of “knowledge [ontology], the nature of knowledge about
those phenomena DEMO, and the nature of ways of studying those phenomena [methodology]” [Gioia DEMO Pitre, 1990])
can lead to greater accumulation of knowledge (Pfeffer, 1993). Building on these notions, Davidsson (2003) lamented that DEMO
neurship research has sometimes suffered from a proliferation of studies articulated on the basis of different fundamental principles
and assumptions—a situation that has led DEMO the slow accumulation of knowledge in the ﬁeld.
Although there is a lot of merit to the arguments for knowledge accumulation, the “paradigm-development” approach appears to
value parsimony and consistency over richness and variety. In doing DEMO, it can produce an overly narrow view (Burrell and Morgan,
1979), especially for the rich nature that makes up entrepreneurial phenomena. DEMO, as scholars, we need to remain alert to the
complexities of the phenomena we hope to study, which can be aided by taking a multiplicity of perspectives to generate a variety
of interpretations (Glynn and Dacin, 2000). Indeed, the “paradigm mentality simultaneously proliferates and polarizes DEMO,
often inhibiting discourse across paradigms, biasing theorists against opposing explanations DEMO fostering development of provincial
theories” (Schultz and Hatch, 1996) with DEMO goal of winning the paradigm war. In such situations, there is DEMO crowding out of the more
exploratory by the more exploitive.
Implications for entrepreneurial scholars
The abovementioned crowding out can occur at the individual scholar DEMO when one believes that there is an opportunity to cap-
italize on the legitimacy and popularity of the ﬁeld to focus attention on making DEMO incremental contributions by, for example, of-
fering an additional moderator to a long list of moderators of an established main effect relationship. Perhaps DEMO appears to be a wise
research strategy for an individual scholar (DEMO it does make a contribution to the literature), but if most scholars pursue this strategy
and this strategy is rewarded, then we head to the “crowding out effect” that I am most concerned about.
Although DEMO can understand why some scholars, particularly junior scholars, might pursue this strategy, there are two cautionary
observations and a challenge. First, the DEMO risk in trying to publish research in high-quality journals is implementing a research
strategy that is conservative in nature. Just as more entrepreneurial organizations DEMO greater variance in outcomes (McGrath, 1999),
entrepreneurial scholars likely DEMO high variance in research outcomes. That is, some projects are going DEMO “bomb,” whereas others
have the potential of being “home runs” (DEMO, really capture the attention of editors, reviewers, and audiences). DEMO developing
their new research projects look to such entrepreneurial papers to build their own stories. The published papers of entrepreneurial
scholars are likely to DEMO a more positive impact on the development of the ﬁeld and other ﬁelds than are the papers of less entre-
preneurial scholars (although entrepreneurial scholars are likely to face more project failures).
Second, scholars can use a portfolio approach to their research projects. Not every research project DEMO to be radical nor should
every project be “safe.” As entrepreneurial researchers, we can create a portfolio of working projects, with one or DEMO being studies we

think are “out there” (i.e., are strange, quirky, DEMO/or challenge the status quo). This is consistent with a real options reasoning ap-
proach by which organizations “manage” the uncertainty surrounding potential DEMO (McGrath, 1999).
Third, the challenge is to expand the DEMO of research questions, theories, and methods. I propose that entrepreneurial scholars
will look to the “ﬂipside” of dominant streams of research. For example, entrepreneurship scholars believe in the beneﬁts of entrepre-
neurial action, so they largely study those beneﬁts. However, investigating beneﬁts might provide only half the picture; perhaps dif-
ferent research questions and theories are needed to understand the costs of entrepreneurial action. For example, why do some use
entrepreneurial action to destroy value, exploit the vulnerable, and/or harm nature? Why do some who engage in entrepreneurial ac-
tion suffer physically, psychologically, and/or emotionally? Is there a motivation that is the opposite DEMO prosocial motivation? That is,
while some entrepreneurs can have low DEMO motivation, how do we capture the motivation of people who desire DEMO expend ef-
fort to harm or diminish other people or the natural environment?
New research questions, theories, and topics expand the range DEMO methods and vice versa. In the past, to expand the range DEMO
methods, entrepreneurial scholars have taken methodological advancements in other ﬁelds and DEMO them to the entrepreneurial
context. However, just like borrowing theories for DEMO entrepreneurial context, using methods from other disciplines will require
some adaptation, and these adaptations themselves may represent a contribution back to the original DEMO There is also an oppor-
tunity to engage in bricolage by looking at the methods at hand and combining them in a way that DEMO up new grounds for theo-
rizing and empirical testing. For example, DEMO, Marcus, and I tried to do this by combining three basic methodological
approaches—a conjoint study, an experimental manipulation, and a “intercepts-only” model—to DEMO us to “get at” an issue that
was otherwise difﬁcult to test (Shepherd et al., 2011).
Finally, I want to apply the opportunities for future entrepreneurship research (stated above) as a challenge to DEMO way scholars
engage in research—namely, to not only study entrepreneurial phenomena DEMO engage in entrepreneurial research. Future scholarship
will engage in entrepreneurial research by (1) thinking entrepreneurially—reﬂected in an open mind toward new topics, methods, and
ways of doing things rather than focused on one “right” or “traditional” approach; (2) thinking about interactions, such that ideas be-
DEMO more plausible as they undergo changes in light of interactions with communities of inquiry (e.g., colleagues, reviewers, editors,
and so on) rather than the sole domain of our individual creativity; (3) thinking about the series of activities that make up one's research
action DEMO focusing more on the activities engaged in developing a paper— the micro-foundations of research (which we can
control)—and less on the outcomes of a single project or career milestone; (4) generating cognitive heat by opening ourselves up to
(or otherwise stimulating) emotional reactions to progress DEMO challenging research activities and using these emotions to energize
and inform subsequent activities rather than relying on a “cold” calculative approach to research; and (5) prosocially acting to organize
compassion venturing by choosing topics to DEMO a deeper understanding of entrepreneurial actors who make constructive and/or de-
structive contributions to society and to help develop scholars who want to DEMO a difference and/or are less fortunate than ourselves.
Implications for entrepreneurial journals
Crowding out can also occur through the journal review process, whereby editors and reviewers become more conservative and
more concerned with an error DEMO commission (i.e., accepting a paper that diminishes the journal's legitimacy) than with an error of
omission (i.e., rejecting a paper that could be highly impactful). Therefore, they begin to play it safe; they are more likely to accept
papers that ﬁt the mold and are “done well” despite doubts about the “size” of the contribution. Although DEMO conservative approach
by scholars and journals may pay off in the short run, it likely creates a stagnant ﬁeld with rigid boundaries, narrow DEMO, and turf
battles. If this happens in entrepreneurship, we, as DEMO community of entrepreneurship scholars, become the antipathy of what we
study.
DEMO
On the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of JBV, I offer DEMO challenge (to myself and anyone who will listen) for future research to
establish a richer, more comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena. To achieve this richness and comprehensive-
ness scholars (and journals) will need to DEMO to keep an open mind that there is not one correct approach or one correct answer
and embrace multiple perspectives, including those from different paradigms and of multi-paradigms. Indeed, there appears to be rec-
ognition of a “post-paradigm war” approach to the development of ﬁelds of knowledge (Romani et al., 2011)—a multi-paradigm per-
spective (e.g., Gioia and Pitre, 1990)— that is focused on a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena. This more
comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena will come from researchers DEMO have at least some entrepreneurial
projects (i.e., with highly uncertain outcomes) in their pipeline; from researchers who expand the range of research DEMO, the
possible outcomes of their entrepreneurial research, and the choice and combination of research methods; and from researchers
who do not get caught up in endless debates about the boundaries of the ﬁeld or its DEMO or about whether one lens (theoretical
or philosophical) is better than another. Although there are many exciting research opportunities to advance understanding of DEMO
preneurial phenomena, I focused on four avenues and offered a subset DEMO potential questions within each avenue. Speciﬁcally, I believe
the vitality of DEMO ﬁeld of entrepreneurship will be maintained and knowledge advanced through research on potential opportunities
as a unit of social interaction between and mutual adjustment DEMO the entrepreneur's mind and a community of inquiry in the world;
research on the antecedents, outcomes, and inter-relationships of the activities DEMO entrepreneurial practice as a micro-foundation of
entrepreneurial action; research on the DEMO relationships of cognition and emotion that are created, perpetuated, and terminat-
ed while one is engaged in the entrepreneurial process; and research on the motivations and capabilities for creating new ventures
(i.e., new organizations DEMO new ventures in established organizations) that help others and/or preserve DEMO natural environment.
