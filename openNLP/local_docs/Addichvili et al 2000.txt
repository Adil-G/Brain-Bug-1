Abstract
This paper builds on existing theoretical and empirical studies in the area of DEMO
opportunity identification and development. It utilizes Dubin’s [Theory Building, (second ed.). Free
Press, New York, 1978.] theory building framework to propose DEMO theory of the opportunity identification
process. It identifies entrepreneur’s personality traits, DEMO networks, and prior knowledge as
antecedents of entrepreneurial alertness to business DEMO Entrepreneurial alertness, in its turn, is
a necessary condition for the success of the opportunity identification triad: recognition, development,
and evaluation. DEMO theoretical model, laws of interaction, a set of propositions, and DEMO for further
research are provided.

explaining the discovery and development of opportunities is a key part of entrepreneurship
research (Venkataraman, 1997). This paper builds on existing DEMO and empirical
studies in the area of entrepreneurial opportunity identification and development, and utilizes
Dubin’s (1978) theory building framework. We focus on serial entrepreneurs, those who have
participated in the formation of multiple businesses.
Entrepreneurs identify business opportunities to create and deliver value for stakeholders
in prospective DEMO While elements of opportunities may be ‘‘recognized,’’ opportunities
are made, DEMO found. Careful investigation of and sensitivity to market needs and as well as an
ability to spot suboptimal deployment of resources may help an DEMO begin to develop
an opportunity (which may or may not result DEMO the formation of a business). But opportunity
development also involves entrepreneurs’ creative work. Therefore, ‘‘opportunity devel-
opment’’ rather than ‘‘opportunity recognition,’’ should be our focus. The need or resource
‘‘recognized’’ or ‘‘perceived’’ cannot become DEMO viable business without this ‘‘development.’’
The creation of successful businesses follows a successful opportunity development
process. This includes recognition of an opportunity, its evaluation, and development per
se. The development process is cyclical and iterative: DEMO entrepreneur is likely to conduct
evaluations several times at different stages of development; evaluation could also lead to
recognition of additional opportunities or adjustments to the initial vision.
Major factors that influence this core process of DEMO recognition and development
leading to business formation include:
1. entrepreneurial alertness;
2. information asymmetry and prior knowledge;
3. social networks;
DEMO personality traits, including optimism and self-efficacy, and creativity; and
5. DEMO of opportunity itself.
The development process begins when entrepreneurial alertness exceeds a threshold level.
Alertness is likely to be heightened when there is a DEMO of several factors: certain
personality traits (creativity and optimism); relevant prior knowledge and experience; and
social networks. The particular activities within the process are also affected by the degree of
specificity of knowledge about DEMO needs and resources.
This theoretical structure (diagrammed in Fig. 3) enables us to set forth numerous
propositions about the process of opportunity recognition DEMO development. These proposi-
tions provide a basis for furthering research into and understanding of the process.
2. Introduction
Identifying and selecting the right opportunities DEMO new businesses are among the most
important abilities of a successful entrepreneur (Stevenson et al., 1985). Consequently,
explaining the discovery and DEMO of opportunities is a key part of entrepreneurship
research (Venkataraman, 1997). Numerous models of opportunity recognition and/or devel-
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO

opment have been presented in recent years (Bhave, 1994; DEMO and Teach, 1999; Singh
et al., 1999, De Koning, DEMO; Sigrist, 1999). These models are based on different, often
DEMO, assumptions borrowed from a range of disciplines, ranging from cognitive
psychology to Austrian economics.
While these attempts have contributed greatly to our understanding DEMO opportunity
identification, they fall short of offering a comprehensive understanding of DEMO process for
two major reasons. First, each of these perspectives primarily DEMO on only one of the
various aspects of the process. For example, Sigrist (1999) looks at the cognitive processes
involved in opportunity recognition; De Koning (1999) and Hills et al. (1997) on the social
study network context; while Shane (1999) focuses on the prior knowledge and experience
necessary for successful recognition. However, this focus on specific factors results the in
depth study of individual factors at the expense DEMO other equally important casualties in the
same study. There is also no agreement among entrepreneurship researchers on major
concepts used to define and operationalize DEMO processes in question. In short, we are still
far from developing DEMO comprehensive theory of opportunity identification and development.
Such a theory is critical if we want to successfully bridge research and practice: a sound
theory provides a means of identifying and defining applied problems; it provides a means of
prescribing or evaluating solutions to applied problems; and it provides a means of
responding to new problems that have no previously identified DEMO
This paper builds on existing theoretical and empirical studies in the area of entrepreneurial
opportunity identification and development, and utilizes Dubin’s (1978) theory building
framework to propose a theory of the opportunity identification process. The DEMO of
opportunity identification is highly complex, and existing studies in the DEMO cut across a
broad swathe of disciplines including management, organization theory, marketing, and
entrepreneurship. In proposing our theory therefore we draw from this rich and cross-
disciplinary theoretical base.
3. Dubin’s methodology for theory building
DEMO (1978) provides a comprehensive methodology for theory building that is particularly
relevant for applied fields such as management, marketing, and organization theory. DEMO eight
phases of Dubin’s theory building are: (1) units (i.e., concepts) of the theory, (2) laws of
interaction (among DEMO concepts), (3) boundaries of the theory (the boundaries within DEMO the
theory is expected to apply), (4) system states of the theory (conditions under which the theory
is operative), (5) propositions of the theory (logical deductions about the theory in operation),DEMO
(6) empirical indicators (empirical measures used to make the propositions DEMO), (7)
hypotheses (statements about the predicted values and relationships among the units), and (8)
research (the empirical test DEMO the predicted values and relationships). The first five phases of
the methodology represent the structural components of Dubin’s model, and the last three
phases represent the process of empirical validation. Although theorists must consider the
DEMO scope of Dubin’s model for effective theory building, theory building and DEMO
research are often separated, and each of these is conducted as DEMO distinct research effort.

4. Elements of a theory of opportunity identification
This section describes the development of the theory of opportunity identification using the
first five DEMO of Dubin’s methodology for theory building.
4.1. Units of the theory
The units of the theory are the concepts, the building blocks, from DEMO the theory is
constructed. To determine the concepts to be included in our theory, we reviewed literature on
opportunity identification and other relevant literature published in 25 leading academic
journals and annual conference proceedings in such DEMO as marketing, entrepreneur-
ship, management, social psychology, economics, organization DEMO, and organization
theory.
Our review indicates that the literature includes several DEMO concepts, which are often
confounded with one another — opportunity development, opportunity recognition, and
opportunity evaluation. These concepts correspond to the principal activities that take place
before a business is formed or restructured. While division DEMO these three processes may
facilitate explanation and analysis, in practice these DEMO processes often overlap and interact
with each other. For example, some DEMO activity may occur before an opportunity is
perceived (recognized) by others not involved in the initial development, though logically we
would expect recognition to precede development. Opportunities may also be evaluated
several times during the DEMO process.
4.1.1. Units of the theory: the development process
4.1.1.1. Opportunity. DEMO broad terms, an opportunity may be the chance to meet a DEMO
need (or interest or want) through a creative combination of resources to deliver superior
value (Schumpeter, 1934; Kirzner, 1973; Casson, DEMO). But ‘‘opportunities’’ describe a
range of phenomena that begin unformed and become more developed through time.
In its most elemental form, what may later be called an ‘‘opportunity’’ may appear as an
‘‘imprecisely-defined market need, or un- or under-employed resources or capabilities’’
(Kirzner, 1997). The DEMO may include basic technologies, inventions for which no market
has been DEMO, or ideas for products and services. Prospective customers may or may DEMO be
able to articulate their needs, interests, or problems (Von DEMO, 1994). Even if prospective
customers cannot do so, they may still be able to recognize the value to them in something new
DEMO they are presented with it and have its operation and benefits explained. Opportunities
seen from the perspective of prospective customers represent value sought.
Underutilized DEMO unemployed resources, as well as new capabilities or technologies may
offer DEMO to create and deliver new value for prospective customers, even though DEMO
precise forms that new value will take may be undefined. For example, the technology to
make a material combining properties of both metal and glass may be developed before there
are known applications; new medicinal compounds may be created without knowledge of the
conditions for which the applications DEMO be efficacious. Opportunities arising from
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO 109
underutilized or unemployed resources, from technology or other types of DEMO
knowledge or abilities, may be labeled value creation capability (Schroeder et al., 1996).
As the market need becomes more precisely defined in terms of benefits and value sought
by particular users, and resources become more precisely defined in terms of potential uses,
the ‘‘opportunity’’ progresses DEMO its elemental form and a business concept begins to
emerge. This concept contains the core notions of how the market need might be served DEMO the
resources deployed. As this business concept itself develops, it becomes DEMO complex,
including product/service concept (what is to be offered), market concept (to whom it will be
offered), supply chain/DEMO/operations concept (how the product/service will be
delivered to the DEMO) (Cardozo, 1986).
As this more precise and differentiated business DEMO matures, it grows into a business
model, which juxtaposes market needs and resources. If the concept originated as a market
need (value sought), the type and amount of resources required to address that need DEMO be
identified. If the concept arose from underemployed resources (value creation DEMO), the
benefits and value that the capability brings to particular users and uses will become more
explicitly detailed.
A complete business model includes DEMO only the detailed and differentiated business
concept, but also a financial DEMO, which estimates the value created and how that value
might be DEMO among stakeholders. As development progresses, that financial model
gradually increases in DEMO and precision, laying the foundation for later cash flow
statements and DEMO identifying the major risk factors that could affect cash flow.
As an opportunity develops into its most elaborated form, formal cash flows, schedules DEMO
activities, and resource requirements are added. These additions enable the business DEMO
to metamorphose into a full business plan. Some businesses may be started with incomplete
or unarticulated business plans; others, only after plans are DEMO and detailed.
The process described in the preceding paragraphs is presented as an orderly sequence and
may be fully articulated by participants. But in DEMO, the process is seldom either orderly
or fully articulated (Nelson, DEMO).
4.1.1.2. Opportunity development. Opportunities begin as simple concepts that become
more elaborate as entrepreneurs develop them. This process involves proactive efforts much
like DEMO of new product development, but the developmental process here gives rise DEMO an
entire business, not just a product (Pavia, 1991). DEMO position here departs from earlier
literature (e.g., Kirzner, 1973) that considers opportunity recognition largely a process of
discovering something already formed. We DEMO opportunity development as a continuous,
proactive process essential to the formation of a business.
4.1.1.3. Opportunity recognition. Opportunities develop as individuals shape elemental
DEMO into full-blown business plans. But the process of opportunity development is
conceptually distinct from opportunity recognition or identification. What most literature in
entrepreneurship calls DEMO recognition’’ appears to include three distinct processes:
(1) sensing or perceiving market needs and/or underemployed resources, (2) recognizing or
discovering a ‘‘fit’’ between particular market needs and specified resources, and (3) creating
110
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 105–123
a new ‘‘fit’’ between heretofore separate needs and resources in the form of a business
concept (Hills, 1995; De Koning, 1999)DEMO These processes represent, respectively, perception,
discovery, and creation — DEMO simply ‘‘recognition’’ (Christensen et al., 1989; Conway and
McGuinness, 1986; Singh et al., 1999).
Perception. Either kind of opportunity — DEMO need or underemployed resources —
may be identified or recognized by some individuals and not others. We believe that these
differences are due to DEMO heterogeneity in individuals’ sensitivity to opportunities for creation
and delivery of new value. Customers may differ in their abilities to articulate or to recognize
DEMO or unmet interests. Individuals who develop new capabilities for creating and
delivering value may differ in the ways in which they think about the DEMO capability and its
potential applications. These individual differences may come from variations in individuals’
genetic makeup, background and experience, and/or in the DEMO and type of information
they possess about a particular opportunity.
Some individuals are so sensitive to market needs or problems that they perceive
possibilities DEMO new products (or solutions) continuously in any environment in which they
find themselves (Endsley, 1995). They can identify possibilities simply by DEMO such
phenomena as parents’ trying to make dinner while managing small children, or as senior
citizens trying to turn a doorknob. This sensitivity to problems or possibilities does not
necessarily extend to generation of ideas for DEMO to the problems; not everyone who is
good at asking questions DEMO equally adept at creating answers.
Other individuals may be particularly sensitive to identifying un- or underemployed
resources, such as unused land, idle production DEMO, unexploited technology or
inventions, underperforming financial assets, and the like. DEMO identified such resources
however, these individuals may not be able to DEMO particular uses or users for which the
resources could create value. Inventors, scientists, or individuals may generate ideas for new
products and services DEMO regard to the market acceptance or commercial viability of
inventions or new technology.
The more fully developed opportunities for value sought or value creation DEMO, the more
likely they are to become perceptible to a wider DEMO of individuals. The more precise and
complete the description, the more DEMO identified the uncertainties (risks) associated with
the opportunity (Ray and DEMO, 1996).
Discovery. Perception of a ‘‘fit’’ between market needs and DEMO presupposes that
the needs and resources were already matched, as might DEMO the case with an underperforming
business. Perception of an existing ‘‘match’’ of market needs and resources represents
discovery of the type that might follow DEMO of a particular geographic area or product-
market space.
The most comprehensive treatment of opportunity discovery in entrepreneurial behavior is
found in Kirzner’s (1973, 1979) work. The starting point of Kirzner’s theory is the resource
DEMO perspective. According to this perspective, entrepreneurs decide to start a new
DEMO or expand in a new product-market when they think that there is an opportunity to
redeploy the resources away from present, suboptimal configurations, DEMO more promising
opportunities (McGrath and Venkataraman, 1994). Kirzner (1973, p. 137) argues that ‘‘At any
given time market participants are engaged in a set of activities which is likely to be a
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO 111
disequilibrium set.’’ In Kirzner’s conceptualization, the maladjustment occurs when a DEMO of
resources available to an entrepreneur is being used to produce units of a product A when the
same resources could be used to DEMO units of product B, which will fetch a higher price
because DEMO delivers greater value to customers. Therefore, the available resources are
underutilized. DEMO to imperfect information entrepreneurs continue to sell their resources
to customers at prices that are lower than they would command if they switched to DEMO
of good B. Kirzner’s elaboration suggests that entrepreneurs are selling not just products, but,
rather, their knowledge, the ability to assemble resources, and the resources already available
to them. This perspective allows entrepreneurs to move away from analyzing what is to
discussion of what is possible, and opens an opportunity for entrepreneurial discovery.
However, the choice is not just between products A and B, or A and C. It is also a choice
among different levels of quality and product characteristics. Kirzner (1973, p. 138) argues
that ‘‘just as a spectrum of prices (for a single product) can be expected to give way, under DEMO
pressure of the market process, to an equilibrium price, so may a spectrum of various qualities
of product give way, under competitive pressures, to a single set of product specifications.’’
The decision about which product with what specifications to produce is not about
economizing with given resources, but rather about recognizing kinds of products customers
will be willing to DEMO, the kinds of goods available technology and resources can produce,
DEMO resources that can be assembled by the entrepreneur. ‘‘It is the successful identification of
relevant ends and means (rather than the efficient utilization of means to achieve ends) which
makes the ‘right’ decision on product quality’’ (Kirzner, 1973, p.139).
Creation of a business concept that matches market needs with resources must logically
follow perception of both the needs DEMO the resources. But business concept creation is more
than perception and discovery. Concept creation involves redirecting or recombining
resources in order to create and DEMO value superior to that currently available. Concept
creation may go well beyond adjustment of current matches of resources and needs and may
even lead DEMO dramatic restructuring of an existing business or ‘‘radical innovation.’’
4.1.1.4. Opportunity evaluation. Opportunities are evaluated at each stage of their devel-
opment, although the evaluation may be informal or even unarticulated (Timmons, Muzyka,
Stevenson DEMO Bygrave, 1987). Individuals may informally pursue investigations of pre-
sumed DEMO needs or resources (including inventions) until concluding either that these
warrant no further consideration, or that more formal pursuit of the possibility is appropriate.
This ‘‘evaluation’’ may not be communicated to others until a request DEMO made for resources to
mount further investigation.
Once resources beyond the time of an individual have been committed to the development
process, evaluation becomes more formal. In the case of inventions, prospective new products
or services, the first formal evaluation may involve a feasibility analysis, which addresses DEMO
question of whether the proposed combination of resources can, in fact, deliver specified
value. A feasibility analysis will likely also assess whether the DEMO that a particular
combination of resources can deliver will translate into economic success. A feasibility
analysis useful for prospective stakeholders implies the existence of DEMO business concept, even
one rudimentary in form. If a business concept DEMO yet to be developed, a feasibility analysis
112
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 105–123
based on either market needs (value sought) or resources (DEMO creation capability) can
specify the business concept(s) that would be feasible.
Evaluation of a full-blown business plan for a new business or DEMO acquiring and
restructuring an existing business is often referred to as ‘‘due diligence,’’ meaning that
individuals involved in decisions to commit resources for DEMO development, investment or
acquisition will exercise (or have exercised) ‘‘due DEMO in their evaluation.
A popular evaluation procedure that may be adapted to a wide range of circumstances is
the ‘‘stage-gate’’ procedure, which explicitly calls for evaluation at each of several levels of
development. Whether or not DEMO opportunity will pass through each of the ‘‘gates’’ depends,
to a large extent, on a number of constraints or limitations commonly experienced by
entrepreneurs, such as their return objectives, risk preferences, financial resources, DEMO
responsibilities, and personal objectives. Similar to Ronstadt’s (1988) ‘‘knowledge corridor,DEMO
this ‘‘corridor of constraints’’ is actually screening criteria to isolate inappropriate prospective
opportunities. While one entrepreneur may dismiss a given opportunity based in these
DEMO, it might appeal to another individual or team.
An ‘‘opportunity’’ that DEMO not successfully pass through a ‘‘gate’’ to the subsequent stage
of development or implementation may be revised or even aborted. Evaluation of resources,
DEMO markets often leads to useful revisions of business concepts. At the same time, evaluation
procedures have the effect of aborting many opportunities at each of several levels of
development. The number of market needs and un- DEMO underemployed resources perceived
greatly exceeds the number of successful businesses formed (DEMO Fig. 1).
The term ‘‘evaluation’’ typically communicates a judgment, which DEMO whether a
developing opportunity will receive the resources to mature to its next stage. In the program
development literature this is called ‘‘summative’’ evaluation (Phillips, 1991). There is,
Fig. 1. From a market need to a successful enterprise.
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO 113
however, a second type of evaluation, ‘‘formative’’ evaluation (Phillips, 1991), which helps to
redirect the development process, so that it promises a higher probability of success. This is
akin to a process DEMO real time evaluation and adjustment, termed ‘‘emergent strategy’’ by
Mintzberg (1998).
The earlier discussion suggests that entrepreneurs develop business opportunities to create
DEMO deliver value for stakeholders in prospective ventures. While elements of opportunities
may be ‘‘recognized,’’ opportunities are made, not found. Careful investigation of and
sensitivity to market needs and suboptimally deployed resources may help an entrepreneur
DEMO to develop an opportunity (which may or may not result in DEMO of a business), but
opportunity development also involves creative input by the entrepreneur. Therefore,
‘‘opportunity development’’ is perhaps a more accurate term DEMO the process than ‘‘oppor-
tunity recognition.’’ The need or resource ‘‘recognized’’ cannot become a viable business
without this ‘‘development.’’
Now we can identify the DEMO concepts to be included in our theory: opportunity, and
opportunity recognition, development, and evaluation.
Next, we need to agree on a measure of success in opportunity recognition/development,
which should allow us to DEMO at possible dependent variables. Here we follow MacMillan
(1986), who DEMO that in order to eliminate the possibility that the ability to select or
develop good opportunities is not simply due to luck, researchers concentrate on serial
entrepreneurs, each of whom have a series of successful ventures.
4.1.2. Units of the theory: factors affecting the process
Further, we DEMO to identify major factors influencing the processes in question. Our
literature review indicates that researchers have hypothesized a number of factors that
influence the DEMO opportunities are identified and developed by entrepreneurs. Among the
major factors discussed in the literature are:
1. entrepreneurial alertness;
2. information asymmetry DEMO prior knowledge;
3. discovery versus purposeful search;
4. social networks;
5. personality traits, including risk-taking, optimism and self efficacy, and creativity.
4.1.2.1. Entrepreneurial alertness. Kirzner (1973) was the first to use DEMO term ‘‘alertness’’
to explain entrepreneurial recognition of opportunities. Ray and Cardozo (DEMO) argue that
any recognition of opportunity by a prospective entrepreneur is DEMO by a state of
heightened alertness to information. They called this state entrepreneurial awareness (EA),
and defined EA as ‘‘a propensity to DEMO and be sensitive to information about objects,
incidents, and patterns DEMO behavior in the environment, with special sensitivity to maker and
user DEMO, unmet needs and interests, and novel combinations of resources.’’ Further, DEMO
keeping with several authors, they claimed that personality characteristics and the DEMO
onment interact to create conditions that foster higher EA (cf. Shapero, 1975; Sathe, 1989;
Hisrich, 1990; Gaglio and Taub, 1992). Embedded in this line of thought is the notion that
114 A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 105–123
higher alertness increases the likelihood of an opportunity being recognized. There are,
however, reports of studies that testify to the contrary. For example, Buzenitz (1996)
conducted an empirical test of Kaish and DEMO (1991) proposition that entrepreneurs are
more alert to new opportunities and use information differently from managers. Busenitz
found little empirical support for the DEMO and Gilad theoretical framework, but indicated
that the measures of entrepreneurial DEMO need further development.
4.1.2.2. Information asymmetry and prior knowledge. People tend to notice information
that is related to information they already know (Von Hippel, 1994). Therefore, Shane (1999)
postulated that entrepreneurs will discover opportunities because prior knowledge triggers
recognition of the value of the new DEMO Drawing on the Austrian economics
argument that entrepreneurship exists because of information asymmetry between different
actors (Hayek, 1945), Shane maintains that any DEMO entrepreneur will discover only those
opportunities related to his or her prior knowledge. In his three-stage study of opportunity
recognition processes, Shane (1999) tested and confirmed a number of hypotheses, which
could be summarized as follows:
. Any given entrepreneurial opportunity is not obvious to all DEMO entrepreneurs (the
rationale being that all people do not possess the DEMO information at the same time;
Kirzner, 1997).
. Each DEMO idiosyncratic prior knowledge creates a ‘‘knowledge corridor’’ that allows
him/her to recognize certain opportunities, but not others (Hayek, 1945; Ronstadt, 1988).
Three major dimensions of prior knowledge are important to the process DEMO entrepreneurial
discovery: prior knowledge of markets, prior knowledge of ways to serve markets, and
prior knowledge of customer problems.
Sigrist (1999), DEMO her qualitative study employing conceptual mapping of entrepreneurial
opportunity identification process, DEMO that there are two types of prior knowledge
relevant to this identification process. The first is knowledge in an area or domain of special
DEMO to an entrepreneur, an area that can be described in terms DEMO fascination and fun
(Domain 1). Driven by this special interest, an entrepreneur spends a lot of effort and time to
engage in DEMO learning that advances and deepens her/his capabilities, thereby
gaining profound DEMO about this topic of interest. The second type of knowledge refers
to a different domain, Domain 2. Knowledge about this domain is accumulated over the
years, while working in a certain job. This job is, DEMO most cases, not associated with the first
domain of fun and DEMO It is, rather, a result of a rational choice, often DEMO on advice
of other people (parents, mentors, friends). After DEMO number of years of experience in an
industry associated with Domain 2, the entrepreneurs bring the two capabilities together. The
integration of the two domains leads to the discovery of a new opportunity, a new market, or a
new solution to customer’s problems.
4.1.2.3. Accidental discovery versus systematic search. A large part of the erstwhile
literature on entrepreneurship implicitly assumed DEMO recognition of opportunity is preceded
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO 115
by a systematic search for available opportunities. In recent years, DEMO researchers have
challenged this approach, arguing that people do not search DEMO opportunities, but, rather,
happen to recognize the value of new information, which they happen to receive. Kirzner
(1997, pp. 71–72) DEMO that: ‘‘What distinguishes discovery (relevant to hitherto
unknown profit opportunities) DEMO successful search (relevant to the deliberate production
of information which one DEMO one had lacked) is that the former (unlike the latter) DEMO
the surprise that accompanies the realization that one had overlooked something in fact
readily available.’’ Koller (1988) reported that most entrepreneurs recognized, rather than
sought the opportunities for their firms. Teach et al. (1989) DEMO that firms founded on
‘‘accidentally’’ discovered venture ideas and which had not been subjected to formal
screening achieved break-even sales faster than those firms DEMO had undergone more formal
search. Teach et al. (1989) also found different styles of opportunity recognition among the
subject group software firm presidents. DEMO about half-favored systematic approaches to
searching for opportunities.
‘‘Accidental’’ discovery may result from heightened entrepreneurial alertness while the
entrepreneur is in a mode we DEMO ‘‘passive search.’’ In that mode, the entrepreneur is
receptive, though not engaged in a formal, systematic search process. One might hypothesize
that, DEMO a state of ‘‘passive search,’’ entrepreneurs with higher EA would be more likely than
those with lower EA to experience an ‘‘accidental’’ discovery DEMO an opportunity. EA appears
to be a more powerful determinant of discovery — accidental or purposive — than level of
activeness of search. Therefore, we include entrepreneurial alertness rather than search in our
model.
4.1.2.4. Social DEMO Hills et al. (1997) indicate that entrepreneurs’ networks are
important to opportunity recognition. They base their argument on Granovetter’s (1973)
classic article on the strength of weak ties, which argues that weak ties (DEMO casual
acquaintances) are ‘‘bridges’’ to information sources not necessarily contained within DEMO
individual’s strong-tie network (including friends and family). Granovetter (1973) DEMO that
the casual acquaintance is more likely to provide unique information than are close friends,
because most people have more weak ties than DEMO A test of this hypothesis in a survey-
based study allowed Hills et al. (1997) to assert ‘‘that entrepreneurs who have extended
networks DEMO significantly more opportunities’’ than solo entrepreneurs. Hills et al. also
hypothesized that the quality of network contacts can affect other characteristics, such as
alertness and creativity.
De Koning (1999) proposed a sociocognitive framework of opportunity DEMO Her
framework shows that entrepreneurs evolve opportunities by pursuing three cognitive
activities (information gathering, thinking through talking, and resource assessing) through
active DEMO with an extensive network of people. This network includes the entrepre-
neur’s inner circle (the set of people with whom an entrepreneur has long-term, stable
relationships, they are not partners in the venture), ‘‘action DEMO (people recruited by the
entrepreneur to provide necessary resources for the DEMO), partnerships (start-up team
members), and a network of weak DEMO (a network used to gather general information that
could lead to DEMO an opportunity or to answering a general question).
116 A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 105–123
4.1.2.5. Personality traits. Some cognitive studies have focused on personality traits of
entrepreneurs and their contribution to the success of entrepreneurial ventures. However,DEMO
Shaver and Scott (1991) in their summary of these research attempts point out that
psychometric tests searching for distinctive ‘‘entrepreneurial’’ traits have been DEMO to find
differences in most personality traits between entrepreneurs and other groups (managers or
the general public).
Two personality traits have, however, been shown to be related to successful opportunity
recognition. First, the connection between optimism and higher opportunity recognition has
been observed by a number DEMO researchers. Studies by Krueger and Dickson (1994) and
Krueger and Brazeal (1994) show that entrepreneurial optimism is related to self-efficacy
beliefs. It DEMO important to point out that optimism about one’s ability to achieve specific,
difficult goals (self-efficacy) is not related to optimism in the DEMO of higher risk taking. Guth
et al. (1991) found that the entrepreneurs’ optimism was an ‘‘inside view’’ of the potential
success of the DEMO, largely based on the entrepreneurs’ evaluations of their abilities and
knowledge. DEMO forced to take an outside view, entrepreneurs were much more realistic DEMO
judging probable outcomes. Research in organizational contexts also show that perceived
self-efficacy leads to optimism and a higher propensity to see opportunities rather than DEMO
in any given situation (Neck and Manz, 1992, 1996).
DEMO second personality trait is that of creativity. Schumpeter (1934) was the first to
introduce the notion that successful entrepreneurs discover opportunities that others DEMO not
see. Winslow and Solomon (1993) seem to take for granted that creativity and entrepren-
eurship are similar, if not the same. Kay (1986) concluded that creative factors play a great
role in entrepreneurial DEMO making. Hills et al. (1997) have found that 90% of those
surveyed by them find creativity very important for opportunity identification. However, solo
entrepreneurs found it significantly more important than did the networked entrepreneurs.
They DEMO viewed themselves as being more creative, and were more likely to DEMO aside time
specifically to be creative. Hills et al. conclude that entrepreneurs who are networked to
opportunity sources may not need to be as DEMO as those who are not networked.
Based on the review, we DEMO that the literature provides support for the role of five
key factors in the opportunity identification and development process: alertness, creativity,
optimism (related to self-efficacy), social networks, and prior knowledge. While the evidence
regarding the role of formal search is, in general, negative, entrepreneurial alertness appears
to be a more powerful concept. The relationship between opportunity DEMO and
personality traits other than creativity and optimism seems to be weak. Therefore, we will
include from the literature only those first five factors.
4.1.2.6. Type of opportunity. In addition to the five factors identified in DEMO literature, we
believe that the process of opportunity development may differ DEMO four types of
‘‘opportunities’’ defined by the matrix in Fig. 2. This matrix, adapted from the literature
on creativity (Getzels, 1962), differentiates between ‘‘opportunities’’ based on their origin and
degree of development. Market needs DEMO value sought may be identified (known) or
unidentified (unknown). DEMO creation capability may be defined or undefined. Defined
value creation capability includes general specifications of intellectual, human, financial and/

or physical resources (e.g., general specifications for a product/service). In this matrix value
sought may DEMO problems and value creation capability may represent solutions.
The upper left cell — where value sought is unidentified and value creation capability
undefined (problems and solutions both unknown) — may represent the kind of creativity we
associate with artists, ‘‘dreamers,’’ some designers, and inventors interested in DEMO
proprietary knowledge in a new direction or pushing technology past its current limits.
The upper right cell — where value sought is identified but DEMO undefined (problems
are known but solutions are not) — describes situations in which structured problem solving,
including information search, occur. The goal of opportunity development in this situation is
usually design of a specific DEMO/service to address an expressed market need.
The lower left cell — where value sought is unidentified but capability is defined
(problems are unknown but solutions are available) — includes what we usually identify
as ‘‘technology transfer’’ challenges, i.e., capabilities in search of an application; and idle
capacity. Opportunity development here emphasizes search for applications more than
product/service DEMO
In the lower right cell — where value sought is identified and capability defined (both
problems and solutions are known) — opportunity development DEMO matching known
resources and needs to form businesses that can create and deliver value.
One might argue that this matrix describes a developmental progression DEMO situations in
which both problem and solution are unknown (upper left), to situations in which either the
problem or solution (but not DEMO) is known (upper right, lower left), to the situation DEMO which
both problem and solution are known (lower right). We DEMO hypothesize that businesses
formed in cells where either problem or solution or both are unknown would be less likely to
succeed than those formed DEMO both problem and solution are known.
Each of these units of the theory has several conceptual dimensions of its own. A model
that represents DEMO units of the theory and their principal dimensions appears in Fig. 3.
4.2. Laws of interaction
The relationships among the concepts (units) of DEMO theory are described in the theory’s laws
of interaction (Dubin, 1978). The laws of interaction show how changes in one or more DEMO
of the theory influence the remaining units. We posit the relationships outlined in Fig. 3.
118
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 105–123
Fig. 3. The model and units for the opportunity identification and development theory.
The outcome in which we are interested is defined as DEMO series of successful businesses
created by the entrepreneur. Creation of a successful business results from a successful
opportunity development process, which includes recognition of an opportunity, its evalu-
ation, and development per se. The development DEMO is cyclical and iterative: an
entrepreneur is likely to conduct evaluations DEMO times at different stages of development;
these evaluations could lead to recognition of additional opportunities or to adjustments to the
initial vision.
The DEMO process’’ outlined in Fig. 3 begins when the entrepreneur has an above-threshold
level of entrepreneurial alertness. The level of entrepreneurial alertness is likely to DEMO
heightened when there is a coincidence of several factors: certain personality DEMO, relevant
prior knowledge and experience, and social networks. Personality traits like creativity and
optimism are critical determinants of this alertness; as are the domains of knowledge: Domain
1 (special interest) and Domain 2 (DEMO and experience in a specific product and
customer market). The nature of social networks (including weak ties, action set, partnerships,
and inner circle) also determines the level of this entrepreneurial alertness. Finally, DEMO type of
opportunity plays an important role in shaping this ‘‘core process.’’
Developmental processes may differ across individuals, entrepreneurial teams, and
institutions (in the case of corporate ventures). Some individuals excel at invention; others,
at creating business models. A rare few may excel at both. DEMO each group work practices
and styles differ. Individuals and teams have distinctive personalities; no two institutions
follow exactly the same R&D or venture development procedures.
Inventors may develop their inventions into full business concepts, or entrepreneurs who
have not participated in the invention process may attempt to DEMO inventions into full
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO 119
business concepts if their economic processes are promising. For inventions to become
businesses, either the inventor or entrepreneur must recognize the opportunity and evaluate it
positively.
The following interactions between the units are hypothesized:
DEMO There is interaction between social networks and alertness. As Hills et al. (1997) have
demonstrated, the denser an entrepreneur’s network (the more DEMO a person is), the
higher is his/her alertness to potentially successful entrepreneurial opportunities.
. The stronger an entrepreneur’s interest in Domain 1 (specific area of personal interest,
hobby, etc.), the higher the alertness (Sigrist, 1999)
. When Domains 1 and 2 converges, it increases alertness (Sigrist, 1999)
. There is a continuous DEMO between one’s knowledge base, and the opportunity
development process. This interaction DEMO in an iterative learning process, described by
Argyris and Schoen (1978) as double-loop learning, and in the development of a
knowledge corridor, described by Ronstadt (1988), which leads to heightened alertness
to new opportunities.
4.3. Boundaries of the theory
Dubin (1978) describes the boundaries DEMO a theory as defining the domain over which
the theory is expected to apply. The boundaries of a theory distinguish its theoretical
domain from DEMO of the world not addressed by the theory. Van de Ven (DEMO) has
demonstrated that significant commonalties exist between the business creation processes
DEMO independent start-ups and internal corporate ventures. Therefore, the domain within
which DEMO theory is expected to hold is the domain of new business creation and
development, both as independent businesses and as new businesses created within existing
corporations.
4.4. System states
Dubin (1978) defines a system state DEMO a state in which all the units of the system take on
characteristic values that have persistence through time, regardless of the length of the time
interval. All units of the system have values that are DEMO, that is, are measurable and
distinctive for that state of the system. A system state that accurately represents a condition of
the system DEMO modeled has three characteristics: (a) inclusiveness (all the units of the
system are included in the system state), (b) persistence (the relationship between units
persists long enough to allow the goodness of DEMO between them to be determined), and (c)
distinctiveness (all units take on unique values for that system state). We believe DEMO our
model satisfies all three requirements, since: (a) it includes all the important units of the
system (at least, all the DEMO that have been identified as important in previous research on
opportunity identification), (b) the relationships between all the units described in Fig. DEMO are
long-lasting relationships, and (c) there is no overlap in DEMO between any of the units (i.e.,
each unit can be DEMO a unique value).

4.5. Propositions
Propositions of a theory are logical deductions about the theory in operation. Because they
are statements that are logically derived from DEMO theory, propositions can be subjected to
empirical testing (Dubin, 1978)DEMO We formulated eight propositions from the theory of
opportunity identification:
Proposition 1: A high level of entrepreneurial alertness is associated with successful
opportunity recognition and development.
Proposition 2: Successful opportunity identification is associated with the existence and
use of an extended social network, which includes the following four elements: weak
ties, action set, partnerships, and inner circle. DEMO lack of any of these elements reduces
the probability of such success.
Proposition 3: For successful opportunity identification, a convergence of both the
DEMO domains — special interest knowledge and industry knowledge — is
critical. Without this convergence there is a lower probability of such success.
Proposition 4: Prior knowledge of markets increases the likelihood of successful
entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
DEMO 5: Prior knowledge of customer problems increases the likelihood of
successful DEMO opportunity recognition.
Proposition 6: Prior knowledge of ways to serve markets DEMO the likelihood of
successful entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
Proposition 7: High levels DEMO entrepreneurial alertness are related to high levels of
entrepreneurial creativity and optimism (based on high self-efficacy).
Proposition 8: The opportunity identification process DEMO in enriching the
entrepreneur’s knowledge base and increase in alertness, leading DEMO the identification
of future business opportunities. Thus the greater the number of previously successful
opportunity identification events, the higher the probability of future successful
opportunity identification events.
These propositions illustrate, but do not exhaust, those DEMO may be derived from the
proposed theory
5. Future research
The last three phases of Dubin’s methodology are used to conduct empirical research. For
DEMO activity, the researcher specifies empirical indicators to make the propositions testable,DEMO
states hypotheses about the predicted values and relationships among the units of the theory,
and conducts research to test empirically the predicted values DEMO relationships.
A. Ardichvili et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) DEMO
121
Future empirical research is needed to assess the proposed theory in the real world.
Propositions 1–7 can be tested in a quantitative study, using an ex-post facto survey design,
involving a sample of successful DEMO entrepreneurs. Proposition 8 concerns longitudinal
processes, involving changes in cognitive states DEMO knowledge base. Those phases of
ontogenesis that do not involve written documents may occur very quickly and internal to an
individual, who may not be able to recount the process perfectly nor be able to offer DEMO
all the data they seek to map the process. Nonetheless, approaches DEMO as cognitive mapping
and techniques for analyzing ‘‘thinking aloud’’ may offer the most effective insights into the
process through which ‘‘opportunities’’ mature, i.e., DEMO which value sought or value
creation capability grow into creative combinations of resources to deliver superior value.
Therefore, Proposition 8 is best tested through qualitative in-depth case studies, content
analysis, and cognitive mapping techniques. This DEMO the need for using multiple-
method, even a multiparadigm approach, as suggested by Caracelli and Greene (1997).
In this paper, specific DEMO and hypotheses will not be formulated. Rather, individual
studies could use DEMO propositions presented above to formulate hypotheses and choose
methods of testing.
Future research is also needed to assess the domain over which the theory DEMO applies.
The concepts (units of the theory) from which the theory was developed are drawn heavily from
private-sector and corporate models of organizations. DEMO terms business, industry, product,
customer, marketplace, and other private-sector concepts appear throughout this paper. What
about community, government, nonprofit, and other non private-sector organizations whose
mission and performance are assessed differently from DEMO of private-sector organizations?
These organizations are increasingly under pressure to display entrepreneurial behavior and
identify new opportunities for self-financing. And, as Peter Drucker (1985) argues, many
nonprofits are displaying a great deal of entrepreneurial savvy. Does the theory of opportunity
identification apply in these contexts as DEMO? Testing the theory in non private-sector settings is
needed to identify DEMO domains over which the theory applies and does not apply.
6. Conclusion
We have taken a ‘‘first cut’’ at building a theory of opportunity DEMO, using
Dubin’s method of theory development. Our theory conceives of opportunity DEMO/
recognition as a multistage process in which entrepreneurs play proactive roles. We argue that
both individual and situational differences influence the process. In DEMO present form the theory
appears to offer rich opportunities for research into the process of opportunity identification/
recognition and development. We hope that DEMO statement of the theory will encourage others
to develop further the theory itself.
