New Venture Valuation by Venture Capitalists:
An Integrative Approach
Abstract
How DEMO valuate accurately a new venture is a critical and under-researched question in
entrepreneurial financing. Leveraging established theories in strategic management, this research
study develops an integrative theoretical framework to examine whether venture capitalists’
valuation of a DEMO venture can be explained by variables identified in the strategy literature as
important to predicting firm-level economic performance. A systematic linkage between well-
developed DEMO in strategy and venture capital valuation practice are corroborated empirically.
This research study proposes a complementary method to extant valuation methods to valuate a
DEMO venture.

Executive Summary
Determining the economic valuation of a company is one of DEMO more challenging and important
discussions an entrepreneur can have with investors (DEMO 2000).  Research that provides operational
guidance on such economic valuation, is, however, lacking.  Indeed, Wright and Robbie conclude that:
DEMO work is available on the valuation of venture capital investments” (1998:DEMO).  Furthermore, some
venture capitalists maintain that: “the truth about DEMO a start-up is that it’s often a guess” (May and
Simmons, 2001:129).  For example, inviting thirty-one valuation experts (e.g., DEMO capitalists,
valuation consultants and business professors) to place an economic DEMO on a small avionic company
acquired by Goodyear, Waldron and Hubbard (1991) find these economic valuation experts provided
valuation estimates ranging from $6 million to $17.5 million for the same company based on exactly the
DEMO information. Waldron and Hubbard conclude that: "From these results it is easy to see why so many
consider the valuation of a closely DEMO business akin to alchemy" (1991:49).
Motivated by such an unmet research need, we develop an integrative framework from strategic
management theories to investigate how factors identified in the research literature that are important DEMO
firm-level performance may affect the economic valuation of a new venture when the new venture seeks
equity financing from venture capitalists. Our integrative framework DEMO that firm resources, external
ties, and market opportunities jointly influence firm-level profitability, which can serve as the
fundamental basis for the economic valuation of a new venture.  Our empirical results from analyses of
340 rounds of early stage venture capital investments in 210 new ventures corroborate hypotheses
DEMO from our integrative framework.  We find empirically that venture capitalists typically DEMO
a new venture higher if: (1) the new venture is DEMO an industry with higher product differentiation and faster
growth; (2) DEMO founder(s) has top management experience and startup experiences before founding DEMO
current venture; (3) the new venture was founded by a DEMO of founders rather than a solo founder and,
major management functions are covered by a complete management team; and (4) the new venture has
external partners.
2
Our integrative approach contributes at least three advances to the research literature. DEMO,
leveraging strategic management theories, our approach systematically identifies key factors DEMO
influence firm-level profitability.  Second, we utilize recent empirical methodologies on how to measure
these key factors.  These methods can help both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs better measure those
important variables, instead of subjective evaluation from experience.  Third, adopting a regression
analysis method to estimate the relative DEMO of each variable in the model, our approach
essentially decomposes the DEMO valuation decision into many input factors; and thus, we extract
market-implied prices for the input factors, and thereby do not rely solely on the aggregate-level deal
characteristics.  This decomposition method overcomes some critical problems embedded in the venture
capital market.  As in the more efficient public capital market, while each individual venture capital
investor is not able to estimate precisely the true economic value of new venture, the mean of their
individual estimates is always close to the true economic value, as long as their estimation is independent
and the number of investors is large DEMO The problem for the venture capital market to set this
“market price” is that the venture capital market is not efficient and more importantly, the economic
valuation is always determined in a “small numbers” bargaining situation DEMO it does not have the
opportunity to let the high valuations and low valuations cancel out each other, as in an efficient market.
Like the hedonic regression method in pricing research, the artificially created “market” in our approach
can be expected to figure out the true economic value DEMO each of the input factors when the deal number is
large enough. The strength of this approach resides critically in “pooling” the individual investors DEMO
the market, which the venture capital market itself could not achieve DEMO to illiquidity of ownership and
“small number” bargaining situation.
At a minimum, when it is difficult to valuate a subject based on output (DEMO, future cash flows),
pricing it based on inputs (e.g., entrepreneur, industry attractiveness, etc.) may provide a useful
complementary method to valuate new ventures when key variables can be systematically identified and
reliable DEMO can be consistently estimated from large samples.

INTRODUCTION
What are the key factors that influence the economic value of DEMO entrepreneurial firm
when such a firm seeks equity financing from a venture capitalist? Generations of entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists have been facing this challenge; yet, how to place an economic value on a
new venture DEMO still one of the more difficult tasks in venture capital decision-making (DEMO,
1989). New venture valuation is also an under-developed area in the research literature (Barry,
1994; Davila, Foster and Gupta, DEMO; Sarasvathy, 1999). As one of the few large-sample
empirical studies on this important issue, the current paper attempts to fill this research gap.
Providing the perspective of a well-known venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, Quindlen
maintains that determining the economic valuation of an entrepreneurial firm is DEMO challenging
task, and: “It’s much more art than science” (2000: 169).  Also, May and Simmons state that:
“the truth DEMO valuing a start-up is that it’s often a guess” (2001: 129). Scholarly research in
this area is rare and “little work is DEMO on the valuation of venture capital investments”
(Wright and Robbie, 1998: 558).  Indeed, both academic researchers and venture capitalists are
increasingly recognizing the importance of contributing both sound theoretical and practical
contributions to DEMO nascent research area (Blaydon and Horvath, 2002).
This research applies an integrative approach to investigate whether the economic
valuation of a new DEMO by a venture capitalist can be explained by key factors identified in
the research literature as important to explaining and predicting firm performance.1  According to
corporate finance theory, the economic value of any investment is determined by the sum of the
discounted value of its future cash flows (Brealey and Myers, 2001).  Building on this well-
1 In DEMO paper, we treat industrial organization economics, resource-based theory and the social
network perspective as foundational theories of strategic management and we refer to DEMO theories
collectively as an integrative approach.

established theoretical foundation, we propose that key factors that are theorized to be important
to firm-level economic performance in strategic management theories should be DEMO to the
economic value of a new venture. Thus, we maintain DEMO savvy venture capitalists should take
these key factors into consideration when valuating a new venture.
In this paper, eight hypotheses are developed from this central proposition and are
empirically tested on 340 rounds of early stage DEMO capital financing in 210 new ventures.
Our empirical results suggest that when valuating a new venture, venture capitalists do take into
consideration those key factors important to firm-level economic performance --- such as
industrial structure, founder and top management team characteristics, and the social network of
a new venture.
These empirical findings have implications for both theory building and entrepreneurial
DEMO practice. First, guided by established theories in strategic management, this paper
proposes a theoretical rationale and develops an integrative framework to assess new DEMO
valuation.  The current paper helps establish an initial linkage between well-grounded DEMO
and venture capital valuation practice, which has been criticized for lacking DEMO sound theoretical
foundation (Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984).
Second, the idiosyncratic characteristics of new ventures (e.g., their short operating
history, and limited accounting information) and inefficiency of the DEMO capital market
present fundamental theoretical and economic measurement challenges for extant financial
valuation approaches, which rely heavily on accounting information that early stage new
ventures typically cannot provide. The integrative framework proposed in this paper is DEMO
dependent on accounting information and most of the variables in our integrative framework can
be objectively measured.
5
Third, our proposed integrative framework has immediate application and is readily
useable by both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Estimated with a large sample, the model
can empirically derive the relative value of each input factor from DEMO market data. The
empirical findings of this paper should inform future research that explores and improves
traditional financial valuation approaches to help venture capitalists DEMO entrepreneurs valuate
their new ventures more precisely.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the
relevant research literature in corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and strategic management,
which DEMO to our central proposition that an integrative research approach can improve the
precision of new venture valuation. We then introduce the theoretical framework, upon which
hypotheses are developed. In the fourth section, we discuss the empirical context and research
methodology. In the fifth and final section, we conclude by discussing potential contributions,
limitations and future research direction.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Systematic and theoretically grounded research on new venture valuation is DEMO
Although a few research studies in corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and strategic
management provide some insight, little systematic attention has been given to this important
topic. Here, we briefly review the limited research literature and highlight the need for a more
rigorous and integrative approach in this area.
DEMO to valuate accurately a firm is traditionally a financial economics topic and most
extant valuation methods are based on accounting information. According to financial DEMO
theory, the economic value of any investment is the sum of DEMO present value of its future cash
flows (Brealey and Myers, 2001).  Such an economic valuation depends on the ability of the
enterprise to generate future cash flows and investors’ assessments of, and attitudes towards, the
risk of these future cash flows (Smith and Smith, 2000).  The corporate finance literature reports
four valuation methods most commonly used in startup valuation: discounted cash flow, earnings
multiple, net asset, DEMO venture capital method. However, as we discuss below, none of these
approaches is fully satisfactory for new entrepreneurial firms.
A fundamental assumption underlying DEMO financial valuation methods is that there is
an efficient capital market for the ownership of the firm. This assumption may be workable for
the DEMO capital market, as legal rules are in place, which regulate public firms to release all
material information to the market and private information DEMO not as common (Fama, 1991).
Traded in a competitive market, the ownership of these firms is also highly liquid.
This perfect capital market assumption may approximately hold for public companies,
but may not DEMO in capital markets for new ventures. The venture capital market is arguably an
inefficient market and quite different in several aspects from the public DEMO market (Lerner,
7
2000).  First, venture capitalists invest in private and new ventures. DEMO ventures have a short
operating history, and thus accounting information is DEMO, making the new venture’s future
cash flows difficult to estimate. Second, the law does not require that private firms report any
financial or DEMO information. Such information is difficult to collect and to verify. Thus,
the information asymmetry between entrepreneur and potential investors is typically high. Third,DEMO
due to regulation (Lerner, 1994) the tradeability of shareholdings in DEMO firms is low.  Thus,
there is not a ready market DEMO these new entrepreneurial firms. Finally, most of the assets of
these DEMO firms are intangible and highly firm specific (Gompers and Lerner, 2001).
The inefficiency of the venture capital market renders the four major DEMO valuation
methods less satisfactory in valuating new ventures (Timmons and Spinelli, 2004). For DCF
approach, it is difficult to estimate the future cash flows and to determine the appropriate
discount rate. For the earnings DEMO approach, three challenges exist. First, most new
ventures do not have earnings. Second, defining the boundary of the reference group (to
determine DEMO multiple) is not always easy or even possible (e.g., for DEMO breakthrough
innovations – such as the personal computer or biotechnology firms at their infant stage). Third,
even if the reference group is DEMO, it is still quite subjective to choose the multiples and there
DEMO no theoretical guidance for this choice. The limitation of the net assets approach is that it
ignores the economic value of growth opportunities and, most new ventures do not have
substantial levels of tangible assets. Finally, the venture capital method is very subjective and the
valuation computed is DEMO easy to justify (Gompers, 1999).
The deficiencies of the above methods are well documented in Waldron and Hubbard
(1991). Inviting thirty-one valuation experts (e.g., venture capitalists, valuation consultants and
business professors) DEMO place an economic value on a small avionic company acquired by
8
Goodyear, Waldron and Hubbard (1991) find these financial valuation experts provided
valuation estimates ranging from $6 million to $17.5 million for the same DEMO based on
exactly the same information. Waldron and Hubbard conclude that: "From these results it is easy
to see why so many consider DEMO valuation of a closely held business akin to alchemy" (1991:49).
The huge disparity of economic valuations for same firm still persists DEMO For
example, the Wall Street Journal (2003) reports that Santera DEMO, a Texas-based
telecommunication firm, was valued at $4.42 a share by Austin Ventures at the same time that
Sequoia Capital held it at DEMO cents a share. Clearly, we need to go beyond extant financial
DEMO theory to look for an alternative conceptual lens for valuation. Unfortunately,
contemporary entrepreneurship research literature does not offer much guidance either.
The entrepreneurship DEMO has an increasingly large body of research on venture
capital investment. Many research studies find that venture capital investment follows a
somewhat well-defined staged DEMO (Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Wells, 1974), which typically
consists of the following six stages: deal origination, deal screening, deal evaluation, deal
structuring, post-investment activity, and exit of investment. However, this DEMO of research
focuses on criteria that venture capitalists use to screen and evaluate a deal, and not on how to
valuate accurately a new venture (e.g., Hisrich and Jankowicz, 1990; Kaplan and Stromberg,
DEMO; MacMillan, Siegel and SubbaNarasimha, 1985; MacMillan, Zemann and SubbaNarasimha,DEMO
1987; Rah, Jung and Lee, 1994).
Though these works DEMO shed some light on what factors that venture capitalists use to
make the “GO/NO-GO” decision, the research literature has not discussed whether or how these
factors affect the economic valuation of new ventures.  Besides several teaching notes on
financial valuation methods (e.g., Gompers, 1999; Lerner DEMO Willinge, 2002), the most relevant
9
industry report on startup valuation is perhaps Hill and Power (2001), which asks venture
capitalists to rate a number of factors when valuating DEMO deal, with a rating of 5 being the most
important and DEMO being the least important. The top factors are reported below:
Relative Importance of Key Factors in Venture Capitalists’ Valuation of New Ventures:
DEMO Factor                Points
1. Quality DEMO Management     4.5
2. Size of the market      DEMO
3. Product qualities      3.7
4. Rate of market growth     3.5
5. Competition       3.5
6. Barriers to entry      3.4
7. Company’s stage of development    3.2
8. DEMO that the company is in    3.0
Important for developing an DEMO approach to new venture valuation, Hill and
Power (2001) provide DEMO empirical investigation of the factors used by venture capitalists in the
economic valuation of a new business venture. These key factors are similar to DEMO identified in
strategic management theories as important influences on firm-level economic performance.
Furthermore, most of the identified key factors can be classified into two major categories: (1)
resources and capabilities (quality of management, DEMO qualities, company’s stage of
development), and (2) market structure (size of the market, rate of market growth, competition,
barriers DEMO entry, and industry the company is in).
These two major DEMO are consistent with the scope of two major strategic
management theories:  (1) resource-based theory (e.g., Barney, 1991; Mahoney and Pandian,DEMO
1992) and (2) the structure-conduct-performance paradigm in industrial organization economics
DEMO
(e.g., Bain, 1959; Scherer and Ross, 1990).  As DEMO by Shepherd (1999), this consistency,
between venture capitalists’ assessment DEMO “in use” and more rigorous theoretical predictions,
suggests a potential opportunity to apply integrative frameworks to better meet the challenge of
valuating a DEMO venture accurately.  With the objective of providing a synthesis of research
DEMO and practitioner “know-how,” the current paper applies strategic management
theories to develop an integrative framework to valuate a new venture accurately.
This research DEMO can be further justified on at least two additional grounds. First,
financial economists have long called for including non-financial variables in economic
valuation DEMO (e.g., Damodaran, 2002).  Along these lines, and inspired DEMO Modigliani and
Miller (1958), Madden (1999) develops an economic DEMO approach that incorporates both
accounting and non-accounting variables, such as managerial DEMO and customer satisfaction, to
better assess the economic value of a DEMO company. Strategic management theories are well
positioned to more systematically guide the selection of such variables. Second, the fundamental
concern of financial valuation is to estimate expected future cash flows (or other equivalents). As
a measure of firm-level economic profitability, future cash flows can be readily interpreted as an
indictor of the expected future economic performance of the firm, and can be used productively
to analyze venture capitalists’ economic valuation of DEMO ventures. In the next section, we
develop an integrative framework to DEMO our analysis of new venture economic valuation, upon
which hypotheses are DEMO
11
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Several strategic management theories have been developed to help DEMO and predict
firm-level economic performance, and the following three are of DEMO relevance for our
purpose: (1) the structure-conduct-performance paradigm of industrial DEMO economics;
(2) the resource-based approach; and (3) the DEMO perspective.  Each of these approaches
explains and predicts firm-level economic performance DEMO a different theoretical lens.
The industrial organization economics’ structure-conduct-performance (S-C-P) paradigm
(Scherer and Ross, 1990) focuses on market conditions in which firms interact and the theory
highlights the importance of industrial structure influencing firm-level DEMO or strategies,
which in turn impact economic performance. The resource-based approach conceptualizes a firm
as a bundle of valuable resources (Penrose, 1959) and stresses the importance of firm-specific
resources and organizational capabilities in helping DEMO predict firm performance. Bridging these
two theoretical lenses, the network perspective DEMO the importance of external ties of a
firm in channeling resource flows, both enabling and constraining a firm’s strategies and,
impacting firm performance. Putting these three theoretical perspectives together, we propose an
integrative strategic management framework to help contribute to an improved and theoretically
grounded economic valuation DEMO a new business venture:
Internal
Resources
Theory: RBV
External Ties
DEMO: Network
Perspective
Economic
Valuation
Market
Opportunities
Theory: I.O.

Industrial Structure and New Venture Valuation
The industrial organization “S-C-P Paradigm” originated DEMO the works of Mason (1939)
and Bain (1959). The central causal linkages are that industry structure determines firm-level
strategy, which in turn determines economic performance (Scherer and Ross, 1990). Structural
elements DEMO are posited to impede competitive forces (e.g., entry barriers) are DEMO to lead
to better industry-level and firm-level economic performance. Extant theoretical and empirical
research has identified industry concentration, product differentiation, and industry demand
DEMO, among other variables as important structural elements for explaining and predicting
DEMO performance (Scherer and Ross, 1990; Shepherd, 1972). However, DEMO make our
framework more tractable, the current paper focuses on product DEMO and industry
growth, which have been consistently reported as two of DEMO more important structural elements
in explaining and predicting the economic performance of both established business ventures and
of new business ventures (Bain, 1959; McDougall, Covin, Robinson, and Herron, 1994;
Sandberg, 1986).
Product Differentiation
Product differentiation is believed to be one of the more DEMO structural elements of
an industry for the purpose of explaining and predicting economic performance (Bain, 1959;
Caves, 1972; Harrigan, 1981).  Building on the “S-C-P” logic, Porter (1980) argues that
industries DEMO by low product differentiation require new entrants to attend to cost and
capacity considerations, which encourages competitive responses by the incumbent firms
towards these entrants, which, in turn, typically leads to decreases in economic profitability.
Sandberg (1986) finds that new ventures entering industries characterized by heterogeneous
DEMO
products achieved higher levels of economic performance than those entering industries
characterized DEMO homogeneous products.
Based on the theoretical logic described above and the fact that new ventures in high
product differentiated industries perform better economically than DEMO in low product
differentiated industries, it follows that a venture capitalist DEMO, ceteris paribus, valuate a new
venture higher in a more highly product differentiated industry. Therefore, we propose that:
H1:  Ceteris paribus, the higher the product differentiation in an industry, the higher the
DEMO valuation of a new business venture, in that industry.
Industry Demand DEMO
While product differentiation is a compelling structural element on the supply side for
helping to explain and predict differences in economic performance, the industry demand growth
is a compelling structural element on the demand side for DEMO to explain and predict
differences in economic performance (Caves, 1972). Porter (1980) argues that because rapid
industry growth ensures that incumbents DEMO maintain strong financial performance, even though
a new entrant takes some DEMO share, an entrant into a rapidly growing industry may
experience less DEMO response since it is not a zero-sum game. McDougall, Covin,
DEMO and Herron (1994) found empirically that new ventures in high-growth industries
achieved higher sales growth and profitability. Indeed, venture capitalists actively seek
investment opportunities in such high growth markets (Zider, 1998). Given the DEMO logic,
venture capitalists may give startups in a fast growing market a higher economic valuation
(Timmons and Spinelli, 2004). Therefore, we propose that:
H2:  Ceteris paribus, the higher the demand growth rate of an industry the higher the economic
valuation of new business DEMO in that industry.
14
Internal Resources and New Venture Valuation
From a resource-based approach, superior firm-level economic performance is derived
from the possession (Barney, 1991, Peteraf, DEMO), deployment (Mahoney and Pandian, 1992),
configuration (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000) and renewal (Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001; Teece,
Pisano and Shuen 1997) of superior firm resources. Early research focused on developing
analytical frameworks to identify such superior resources (Barney, 1991; Dierickx and Cool,
1989).  The resource-based approach maintains that only those resources that are valuable, rare,
inimitable and non-substitutable --- the so-called VRIN test --- can lead to sustainable
competitive advantage.
In this research DEMO we maintain that entrepreneurial human capital skills and
organizational capabilities embedded in team-based human capital are primary candidates for
passing the VRIN test. Emphasizing DEMO perspective helps bridge the resource-based theory and
entrepreneurship research on both the individual entrepreneur and entrepreneurial management
team.  Arguably, as the most important DEMO resource a new venture can have, the founder /
entrepreneur plays a critical role in initiating, maintaining and growing the new business
(DEMO, Gimeno and Woo, 1994; Kaplan and Stromberg, 2000; Muzyka, Birley and Leleux,
1996; Rah, Jung and Lee, 1994).  Recently, however, the fundamental importance of the
entrepreneurial team has also gained increasing research attention. With increasing complexity of
technologies and intensity of DEMO, the characteristics of new venture team become a
major concern to DEMO capitalists (Hall and Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis and Meyers, 1998).
Consistent with this research tradition, we focus here on the founder/entrepreneur and the
entrepreneurial management team.
15
Founder Effects
“Nearly every mistake I’ve made has been in picking the DEMO people, not the wrong
idea,” reflected Arthur Rock, one of the most respected venture capitalists, who funded Intel
(Sahlman, Stevenson, DEMO and Bhide 1999: 351).  MacMillan, Siegel and SubbaNarasimha
(1985) and Hill and Powell (2001) provide corroborative evidence for this insight.  Indeed, in our
literature review, we found ten out of the thirteen extant research studies on venture capitalists
investment process report that the DEMO “track record” is very important for predicting
the success of a new venture. Three types of experience are considered important in determining
this track DEMO: 1) industrial experience (technical and/or market), 2) management experience,
and 3) start-up or entrepreneurial experience (Bird, 1993).
Industrial Experience
It is typically highly risky to start a business without DEMO (technological and/or
market) knowledge of the industry. Previous experience in the same or related industry can help
the entrepreneur gain such critical DEMO Such experience provides the entrepreneur with
certain key competencies that are highly useful for identifying opportunities and evaluating and
managing risk. Recognizing the importance DEMO industry experiences, would-be entrepreneurs may
follow a self-selection process, albeit the process is by no means perfect. For example, prior
marketing experience in the same or related industry was found in 48% of the entrepreneurial
DEMO starting high-tech firms in Canada (Doutriaux and Simyar, 1987) and DEMO such experience
was positively related to the sales growth in the first three years of business. Similar empirical
results have also been found for DEMO experiences (Baum, Calabrese and Silverman, 2000).
16
Growth firms tend to be led by entrepreneurs who began their new DEMO venture
based on ideas developed in their previous jobs (Dunkelberg, Cooper, Woo and Dennis, 1987).
Moreover, the number of years the entrepreneur has worked in a similar industry has been found
to be DEMO and positively related to sales growth (Cooper and Daily, 1997; DEMO, Folta
and Cooper, 1997; Siegel, Siegel and MacMillan, 1993)DEMO Further, founders’ industry experiences
are positively related to various measures of DEMO returns (Schefczyk and Gorpott, 2001).
Based on this logic, DEMO propose that:
H3:    Ceteris paribus, a new venture DEMO valuated higher if its founder has relevant
industry experience before founding the business venture.
Top Management Experience
The research literature on top management experience DEMO the skills and
knowledge gained through managing layers of hierarchies. Its relevance to the financial
performance and economic valuation of a new business venture DEMO that the founder “has been
there before.”  Thus, the founder presumably knows the necessary strategies and organizational
structures to grow the small new DEMO to a larger size that requires more sophisticated
management infrastructures to support.  Bird (1993) argues that organizations may stay small
because they lack appropriate management systems to sustain expansion and growth.  Therefore,
managerial experiences should enhance a new business venture’s ability to grow. Empirical
findings are DEMO with this argument (Gimino, Folta, Cooper and Woo, 1997; DEMO,
Schwartz and Tarpley, 1989).  Therefore, we propose that:DEMO
H4:
Ceteris paribus, a new business venture is valuated higher DEMO its founder has
previous top management experiences.
17
Start-up Experiences2
Prior startup experience of the founder is assumed to yield DEMO entrepreneurial skills,
a business reputation, and numerous network contacts, which are strategic resources that can be
leveraged in future business ventures (Starr and MacMillan, 1990).  Experienced founders have
accumulated the wealth, power and legitimacy that can be used to surmount the liability of
newness (Starr and Bygrave, 1991).  Prior experiences as a founder lead DEMO optimism in
implementing the current venture (Cooper, Willard and Woo, DEMO) and sales growth in the first
year of high-tech firms (Doutriaux and Simyar, 1987).  Moreover, venture capitalists believe that
direct experience in starting up a new business is an important predictor of new DEMO success
(Stuart and Abetti, 1990).  Lerner (1995) finds DEMO venture capitalists’ representation on boards
of directors increased by 44% for startups in which the CEO had no prior experience in running
an entrepreneurial DEMO Increased board presence of venture capitalists indicates increased needs
for both assistance and monitoring, which incurs more costs for the investors. Increased
assistance and monitoring costs by venture capitalists lead to lower economic valuation of a DEMO
venture.  Therefore, we propose:
H5:             Ceteris paribus, a new venture is valuated higher if its DEMO has previous startup
experiences.
2 Startup experience and top management experience are two related, but not identical, concepts. The
emphasis of startup experience DEMO on the detailed process of founding a company, unlike top
management DEMO, which highlights the skills and knowledge gained through managing
hierarchies. Some DEMO that startup experience may be a subset of top management experience. This
argument is based on an assumption that the startup that a founder DEMO ultimately grows up.
However, 47% of startups fail within the first DEMO years of founding (Timmons and Spinelli, 2004).
Government data show that between 1990 and 1999, the average termination rate of small businesses
is 90% (Small Business Administration, 1999). Therefore, having startup experience does not
guarantee top management experience later on, and each concept warrants separate theoretical
discussion.
18
Entrepreneurial Team Effects
Recently, the importance of the entrepreneurial team has gained increasing attention from
researchers and has had increased salience to venture capitalists DEMO their investment decision.
Specifically, venture capitalists are concerned with the founding DEMO and the completeness of
the skill set of the new venture management team (Daily, McDougall, Covin and Dalton, 2002;
Muzyka, Birley and Leleux, 1996; Timmons and Spinelli, 2004; Zacharakis and Meyers, 1998)
Solo Founder vs. Founding Team
With increasing complexity of technologies DEMO intensity of competition, more and more
new ventures are now founded DEMO a team of founders, rather than a solo entrepreneur.  Eisenhardt
and Schoonhoven argue that: “more founders mean that there are more people available to do the
enormous job of starting a new firm that there DEMO more opportunity for specialization in decision
making” (1990: 510). Teams help reduce cycle time in new product development (Ancona and
Caldwell, DEMO), increase the likelihood of innovation (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995), and
improve product and service qualities (Lawler, Mohrman, and Ledford, DEMO). Entrepreneurial
teams help attain strategic maneuvers including attaining first-mover advantages, DEMO
strategic alliances, and/or developing discontinuous innovations (Tushman and Anderson, DEMO).
Entrepreneurial teams also allow firms greater agility to enter markets quickly and to maintain
responsiveness to changing market conditions.
Teams are particularly crucial DEMO the context of technological entrepreneurship because
investment decisions are based, at DEMO in part, on the quality of the founding team (Gupta and
Sapienza, 1992). Such founding members are the repositories of much of the technical and
management knowledge, skills, and ability that make up DEMO intangible assets of the firm (Cooper
19
and Daily, 1997). Likewise, the size of the founding team DEMO been found positively related to a
new business venture’s sales growth (DEMO and Willard, 1990; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven,
1990).  Following DEMO logic, we propose that:
H6:               Ceteris paribus, new business ventures founded by a team are valuated higher than
those founded by one founder.
Completeness of Management Team
DEMO this increasingly complex and competitive marketplace, a “one-man” shop is less
DEMO to survive – simply because no one can have all the necessary skills and knowledge to
compete effectively. Managers with different skills must perform DEMO variety of necessary
managerial functions in order to cope with this increasing complexity and competition.
Depending on the specific business situation, key managerial positions may include the
president, VP of marketing, engineering, finance, and DEMO (Roure and Keeley, 1990).
Thus, the completeness  --- in terms of variety of necessary managerial functional skills  --- of
the management team in a new business venture is crucial (Hill and Power, DEMO).
The completeness of the management team not only affects the future economic
performance of the new venture, but also directly affects the economic valuation of the new
venture by potential venture capitalists, as venture capitalists are known to routinely help with
recruitment for their portfolio companies.  Indeed, Kaplan and Stromberg find that:
“management risk is one of the most common sources of uncertainty that VC identifies. It is
present in DEMO than 60% of the sample investments… the concern is more about the
management team being incomplete in some sense” (2002: 41, italics added).  Therefore, we
propose that:
H7:             Ceteris paribus, new business ventures, with a functionally complete DEMO
team, are valuated higher than those without one.
20
External Ties and New Venture Valuation
The importance of external ties has DEMO emphasized to understand the start, continued
viability, and expansion of new ventures (Dubini and Aldrich, 1991). The more developed the
entrepreneur’s DEMO, the easier it is to start and grow the new business. DEMO entrepreneur’s
network plays an important role in searching for new opportunities, DEMO resources, and
gaining legitimacy (Stuart, Hoang and Hybels, 1999).
First, a social network facilitates the entrepreneur in finding lucrative new business
opportunities (Lechner, Dowling and Welpe, 2005). Second, once the DEMO business opportunity
is identified, the entrepreneur can leverage the social network DEMO pursue this new business
opportunity.  The social network usually provides access DEMO resources at a cost substantially
lower than that from the open market (Larson and Starr, 1992). Finally, the social network is
useful when the emerging business requires legitimacy, as more established institutions (and
DEMO individuals) extend their endorsement to these new business ventures (Stuart, DEMO and
Hybels, 1999), which is typically essential to penetrate the DEMO asymmetry between the
entrepreneur and venture capitalists. Since new ventures have limited operating history, their
own accomplishments are rarely sufficient to resolve the uncertainty about such business
ventures’ quality and viability. Thus, the social structure of business relationships can
substantially influence perceptions of the quality (and hence economic valuation) of new
business ventures (Stuart, Hoang and Hybels, 1999)DEMO
In the network research literature, the importance of the position that DEMO focal firm holds in
its network (its ego network) has long been emphasized. A general proposition is that actors’
differential positioning within a DEMO structure has an important impact on resource flows and
on entrepreneurial outcomes (Hoang and Antoncic, 2002). As one of the more important DEMO
21
of network structure, ego network size has been frequently used to describe the position of a
focal firm in its network (Gulati, 1995; Zaheer and Bell, 2005).
Analyses of network size measure the extent to which resources can be accessed at the
level of the entrepreneur (Aldrich and Reese, 1993) and the organization (Baum, Calabrese and
DEMO, 2000; Katila, 1997; Katila and Mang, 1999). The DEMO literature has found that the
larger its ego network size, the DEMO economic benefits accrue to the focal firm. For example,
Shan, DEMO and Kogut (1994) find in the United States biotechnology industry, DEMO
biotechnology firms with more external ties (collaborative relationship with other firms DEMO
research agencies) enjoy much higher innovation rates (measured by number of patents). Stuart,
Hoang and Hybels (1999) find the more DEMO alliances a new biotechnology venture has
formed, the sooner it will DEMO public and the more money it will raise in an IPO (DEMO market
valuation). The presence of strategic partners, such as venture DEMO, established
pharmaceutical firms, and other business firms, all are positively DEMO to the speed to, and
economic valuation of, an IPO. Given both the theoretical arguments and empirical findings that
corroborate the theory, we propose that:
H8:           Ceteris paribus, DEMO larger the size of the new venture “ego network” the higher the
economic valuation by venture capitalists.
22
METHODOLOGY
Early stage companies include seed stage, startup stage, and first DEMO (Sahlman, 1990).
The venture capital valuation data come from Thomson Financial Security Database, which is
the official data collector of the national association of venture capitalists and the most
authoritative data source for venture DEMO investment (Lerner, 1994).
Since the valuation data are the outcomes of existing VC valuation methods, one may
question whether we can use them as the dependent variable to test a complementary valuation
approach. Our DEMO is consistent with the corporate finance research literature. The central idea
is that while each individual investor is not able to estimate precisely the DEMO economic value of
any asset, the mean of their individual estimates DEMO always close to the true economic value, as
long as their DEMO is independent and the number of investors is large enough.
The problem for the venture capital market to set this “market price” is that DEMO venture
capital market is not efficient and more importantly, the economic DEMO is always
determined in a “small numbers” bargaining situation – it does not have the opportunity to let the
high valuations and low valuations DEMO out each other, as in an efficient market. Our proposed
approach DEMO decomposes the economic valuation decision into many input factors; and
thus, artificially creates a market for the input factors (not the deals).  We can expect that the
artificially created “market” can figure out the true economic value of each of the input factors
when the deal DEMO is large enough. The strength of this approach resides critically in
“pooling” the individual investors across the market, which the venture capital market itself
could not achieve due to illiquidity of ownership and “small number” bargaining DEMO
The sampling procedures are as follows. The sample firms must 1) DEMO received their
early stage venture capital funding in the period from 1/1/1995 to 12/31/2001; 2) be less than
23
three years old at the time of funding; 3) be United DEMO firms and 4) not be in the financial,
insurance, or real estate sector. The sample window period covers both “hot” and “cold” DEMO
After dropping unusable observations, we have a sample of 210 new DEMO ventures in 48
industries (defined at 4-digit SIC code) receiving 340 rounds of early stage financing in the
seven-year period.  To check that this sub-sample is not biased, we conducted several T-tests
(not reported DEMO), which indicated no significant statistical difference between the sample and
the population in terms of age, financing stages, industry, and economic valuation. The
independent variables and control variables are collected from several sources, which include
Compustat, US Census, Recapit Database, Lexus-Nexus and firm web sites.
Measurements
Following the standard practice in corporate finance and venture capital investment
DEMO, the economic valuation of a new venture is measured by its DEMO valuation,
which equals the announced amount of economic valuation minus the money invested at the
financing round (Gompers, 1995; Sahlman, 1990)DEMO For example, a post-money economic
valuation of $10 million reported in DEMO SDC database after raising $3 million implies a pre-
money economic valuation of $7 million. To check that the dependent variable is normally
distributed, we conducted a Shapiro-Wilk W Test to diagnose possible deviation from normal
DEMO The empirical result of this test shows that the data are not normally distributed.3
Following established practice in the corporate finance literature (Gompers, DEMO), we performed
3  Shapiro-Wilk W test for normal data
Variable  | Obs        W          V DEMO Prob>z
Valuation  | 340    0.54048    109.416 11.087 DEMO
24
a log transformation of the raw data and proceeded to use the DEMO of the absolute amount
of the pre-money valuation to measure the pre-money valuation of a new venture. After the
transformation, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the transformed variable is normally
distributed.
Product differentiation DEMO been commonly measured as the advertising intensity ratio,
i.e., advertising DEMO divided by sales revenue of an industry. However, venture capital
investments DEMO typically biased toward high-tech industries (Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Lerner,DEMO
1995).  In high-tech industries, firms aggressively pursue technology superiority and develop
products with advanced technological features. Thus, R&D investment is an important way for
firms to differentiate themselves. In other words, product differentiation may consist of at least
two dimensions: perceptual differentiation and innovative differentiation. Therefore, we also use
the average R&D investment over sales of an industry as a measure of R&D intensity to capture
the DEMO differentiation as a complementary measure of product differentiation together
with the advertising intensity ratio. Industry growth rate is measured as the percentage change of
DEMO revenue of an industry in year two (t2) over the revenue of the same industry at year one (t1).
Management experience of the founder(s) is measured by a dummy variable, coded “1” DEMO
any of the founder(s) has worked in any high-level management DEMO (VP and above level).
Startup experience of the founder / DEMO team is measured by a dummy variable, coded “1”
if any DEMO the founder(s) founded a company before, and “0” otherwise. To measure the
completeness of management team, we first identify the key positions in the top management
team of a typical new venture. Following extant DEMO literature (Roure and Keeley, 1990;
Siegel, Siegel and MacMillan DEMO), these key positions in the top management team of a typical
new venture include the (1) CEO/President, (2) VP of marketing/sales/business development, (3)
25
VP of engineering/technology, (4) VP of finance, CFO or DEMO Controller, and (5) VP of
operation/ production/manufacturing (for DEMO ventures). We use a dummy variable to
capture the completeness of the top management team, which is coded “1” if all of the above top
management team positions were filled at the time of the DEMO, and “0” otherwise.
Following the conventional practice in the network research DEMO, ego network size
is measured by a direct count of the DEMO of alliance partners a new venture has before the
time it received funding from the venture capitalists, which include formal partners for all
purposes.  A potential endogeneity problem between an alliance partner and firm valuation can
be partially mitigated in this way.
To control for other relevant factors, we also include several control variables in the
model, which include the age (measured in month) and development stage of the firm at
DEMO (using seed stage as the reference group), whether the firm DEMO a “dotcom” (coded “1” if
it is; “0” otherwise), the size of its industry and the S&P 500 index at the DEMO of investment, and
VC experience (measured by the number of companies the lead VC firm has invested) and VC
size (measured by DEMO total investment fund under management by the lead VC firm).
Summarizing the discussions so far, the equation below represents the whole model to be
estimated in the empirical analyses:
Log (Pre-money Valuation of A New Venture) =
α + β1 (Adsales) + β2 (R&DEMO) + β3 (Industry Growth) + β4 (Industrial Experience)
+ β5 (Management Experience) + β6 (Startup Experience) + β7 (Team-Founding)
+ β8 (Team Completeness) + β9 (Network Size) + DEMO (Vector of Controls)
where α is the intercept, β1  DEMO β9 are the coefficients of the theoretical variables to be estimated,
and β1-k  represent the coefficients of the eight control variables to be estimated.
26
Model Estimation and Results
Firms received multiple early stage financings in the DEMO, with a minimum of one and
a maximum of four. Including DEMO observations on the same firm is likely to violate the
standard assumption of independence from observation to observation in regression models. The
interdependence of DEMO may lead to firm-specific heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.
If these econometric problems exist, the coefficients estimated by OLS are inefficient. We went
through three procedures to detect any potential violations of the classic assumptions. To
diagnose potential DEMO problem, we examine the data by the Modified Wald test
for DEMO (Greene, 2000). The empirical results show that the variances of the
dependent variables are not constant (heteroscadestic). To correct this heteroscadesticity problem,
we estimate the model with random-effect GLS estimator, assuming heteroscedasticity across
panels. By choosing a GLS estimator with assumed heteroscedasticity, the variances of the error
terms are allowed to vary from panel to panel DEMO the effects of those contemporaneous
variances are taken into account in the intercept term (Hsiao, 1986). To ensure we make a correct
DEMO of the random-effect estimator, we also conducted the Hausman (1978) DEMO test
and the result confirms that that random-effects model is appropriate for our data. Finally, we
used the Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (DEMO) Lagrange multiple test to detect possible
autocorrelation problem4.  Empirical results indicate that there is no serious autocorrelation in the
error terms.

1, which may be considered a special case of the Breusch-Godfrey test statistic.

Results
Table-1 reports the means, standard deviations and correlation of all variables used in the
model. The 210 new ventures received a total of DEMO rounds of early stage venture capital
financing during the sampling period. There is sufficient variability among all the variables in
the model. The bivariate DEMO between the dependent variable and a number of
independent variables are largely consistent with our theoretical predictions. The matrix also
indicates some of the DEMO variables are significantly correlated, but significant
correlation between individual variables does DEMO necessarily mean severe multicollinearity for
the whole model (Neter, Kutner, DEMO and Wasserman, 1999). Indeed, the VIF (variance
inflating factor) of the model is only 1.23, which is far below the conventional threshold level of
10 (Neter, et al., 1999: 387).  Thus, there is no multicollinearity problem in our data.
Table-2 reports the estimates from the random-effects GLS estimation of pre-money
valuation of the new DEMO in the sample. The coefficients are obtained after correcting the
heteroscedasticity across panels and controlling other potential confounding effects.

DEMO
Given the explorative nature of this research, our primary interest at DEMO stage is to
establish a theoretical linkage (and substantiate it with DEMO evidences) between venture
capitalists’ economic valuation of a new venture and DEMO theoretical variables derived from the
three strategy theories, not to estimate DEMO exact quantitative coefficients of these variables. Here
we focus our report on the general relationships, instead of individual coefficients.
28
Industry Structure Effects
Extending the industrial organization economics perspective of industry stricture DEMO firm-
level economic performance, we proposed that venture capitalists should consider DEMO
characteristics of industry structure when valuating a new venture. We include three
measurements of the two industry structural variables to capture the industry structure DEMO on
new business venture economic valuation and each of them are hypothesized to be positively
related to pre-money valuation of a new venture. Consistently, both measures of product
differentiation (R&D intensity ratio and advertising intensity) are highly significant and in the
predicted direction. The empirical results show that new ventures in high product differentiated
industries (both perceptual and innovative differentiations) do receive higher economic valuation
from venture capitalists. Thus, H1 DEMO empirical support.
H2 hypothesizes that industry demand growth should be positively related to the
economic valuation of new ventures by venture capitalists. As predicted, industry demand
growth is indeed positively and significantly related to the pre-money DEMO of new business
ventures. As observed by veteran practitioners (Zider, 1998), venture capitalists do give higher
economic valuation to new ventures in DEMO industries. All in all, our proposition and
hypotheses regarding the effects DEMO industry structure on new business venture economic
valuation are largely corroborated.
Internal Resources (Founder and Management Team Effects)
Rooted in the resource-base approach and built upon empirical research on new venture
economic performance and venture DEMO investment literature, this paper proposes that venture
capitalists consider the characteristics DEMO the founder (s) and the top management team when
29
valuating a new venture. More specifically, we propose that the quality of entrepreneur and the
top management team should be positively related to the DEMO valuation of the new venture.
Consistent with our theoretical prediction, all DEMO hypotheses about the founder/entrepreneur and
the top management receive strong empirical support. In terms of founder experiences, the
empirical results show that venture capitalists valuate a new venture significantly higher if its
founder(s) has: relevant industry experience (H3); relevant managerial experiences (H4); and
startup experiences (H5) before the entrepreneur founded the current new venture DEMO those
without such valuable experiences. Thus, all three hypotheses on the DEMO experiences
measuring the quality of the founder received strong empirical support.
Regarding hypotheses on the entrepreneurial team, a new business venture founded by a
team of entrepreneurs rather than a solo founder is valuated significantly higher DEMO those
without one, in support of (H6).  And, new ventures with a complete management team are
valuated significantly higher than those DEMO one, in support of (H7). These empirical
findings are consistent with those from the venture capitalist screening and selection literature
that focuses DEMO the “GO/NO-GO” decision (e.g., Kaplan and Stromberg, 2001).
DEMO Ties
Consistent with previous empirical findings on the public stock market’s valuation of
new ventures on the IPO market (Stuart, Hoang and Hybels DEMO), the size of the network (as
measured by the number DEMO alliance partners) of a new venture is significantly and positively
related DEMO its economic valuation by venture capitalists. This empirical finding is quite consistent
with previous empirical findings from extant research literature on the economic benefits DEMO
alliances.
30
It is worth noting that the above empirical results are obtained after DEMO for
potential confounding effects of other factors from financial market, industry DEMO firm age, stage
of development and whether the new business venture DEMO a dotcom, all of which are significantly
related to the economic DEMO and in the positive direction (except VC experiences). It seems
DEMO valuations by more experienced venture capital firms exhibit downward bias, which DEMO
consistent with Hsu’s finding that entrepreneurs pay a premium for affiliation with more
experienced venture capitalists (2004). VCs with more money in the pocket tend to give higher
valuation.
Relative Importance of the Three Theoretical DEMO
It may be interesting to compare the relative importance of industry structure variables
(external opportunity) and firm resource variables in explaining the variability DEMO new venture
valuation. While the random-effect generalized least square estimator used in the model is more
efficient and reliable, one of its drawbacks is that it only reports the Wald Chi-squared Test but
the R-squared coefficient DEMO we can not compare the explaining power of two models directly.
However, the ratio of two independent Chi-squared variables has an F-distribution (Greene,DEMO
2000). Therefore, we can compare the relative explanatory power of DEMO models by dividing the
two Chi-squared statistics, which is an F DEMO Analyzing it in this way, we find no
significant difference among DEMO three theoretical perspectives in terms of their explaining power
of new venture valuation. In other words, it seems that venture capitalists weigh these factors
equally in their valuation, which is not consistent with the findings from Hill and Power’s
interviews with venture capitalists (2001). However, such DEMO conclusion may be premature, as the
models estimated are not fully DEMO, since many other important variables from each
theoretical perspective are not DEMO in the model.
31
CONCLUSIONS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH
“Entrepreneurship plus innovation are the foundations of US prosperity while
entrepreneurship is the US’ most important strategic advantage” (Bygrave, DEMO: 1). Venture
capital has been an important factor behind both DEMO and innovation in the United
States economy for the past thirty years (Gompers and Lerner, 2001). Despite its critical
importance in entrepreneurial DEMO, how to valuate a new venture accurately is seldom
considered in DEMO extant research literature. Moreover, even the few existing studies are clinical
DEMO descriptive in nature. As one of the few large sample quantitative studies on this important
issue, this paper fills this noted gap in the research literature.
How to valuate a company accurately is traditionally a corporate DEMO topic; however,
most financial valuation methods were developed for well-established DEMO, especially
companies in the more efficient public capital market. Research efforts DEMO develop economic
valuation methods specifically for new ventures have just begun (DEMO and Robbie, 1998). For
example, the Wall Street Journal (DEMO) reports that Private Equity Industry Guidelines Group
(PEIGG) just recently DEMO a proposal to “standardize” the valuation practice in the private
equity industry, which was immediately endorsed by 15 of the 18 firms represented on the
PEIGG board, including HarborVest Partners, Bank of America Corp. and DEMO University of
California Regents (Grimes, 2003). As demonstrated by Waldron and Hubbard (1991), the
traditional financial methods yield economic valuations with large variability. Against such a
backdrop, the current paper leverages established theories in strategic management to use those
input variables important for explaining firm-level DEMO performance in order to predict
directly the economic valuation of an early stage new venture. Presumably, when it is difficult to
valuate a young firm based on output (e.g. future cash flows), pricing it based on inputs (e.g.
32
entrepreneur, industry attractiveness, and so forth) may be a better alternative than a “pure
guess.” Though tentative, the results from our empirical analyses support this central proposition.
Such empirical findings may hold great promise for DEMO future theory building and practice in
entrepreneurial financing.
This paper makes at least three major contributions to the research literature. First, as one
of the few large sample management studies addressing the economic valuation of business
DEMO in venture capital investment, this paper fills a noted gap in DEMO research literature.
Second, building an integrative theoretical framework, it is one of the first research
studies bringing theoretical rigor from strategic management theories DEMO investigate the economic
valuation of new ventures by venture capitalists. Entrepreneurship scholars have long called for
“going beyond simple descriptive statistics” to not only DEMO the “what,” but also explain the
“why” in venture capital investment (Fried and Hisrich, 1994).  The empirical results of this
paper help to establish an initial linkage between well-developed theories in strategic
management DEMO under-researched venture capital valuation practice. This linkage enables us to
use strategic management theories and associated empirical methodologies to systematically
identify and measure variables DEMO to new venture valuation.
Third, the venture capital market is not DEMO and each investment deal is “privately”
negotiated in a “small numbers” bargaining situation. The framework proposed here essentially
decomposes each investment deal into many DEMO of input factors (such as market
structure and firm resources), DEMO artificially creating a “factor market” for investment deals.
Like the hedonic regression approach in pricing research, the method developed here can
effectively “price” each factor in the model, which can at least partially mitigate the market
inefficiency problem arising from the “small numbers” bargaining situation.
33
This research paper also contributes to entrepreneurial practice. First, the model
developed here is readily useable by both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Estimated with DEMO
large sample, the model can empirically derive the relative economic value DEMO each input factor
(the regression coefficients) from observed market data. Thus, venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs can use these relative economic values to guide their economic valuation.
Second, compared with “guess work” of the extant valuation methods, this method may
be a more accurate one for new ventures, since most of the factors can be objectively measured
and empirically valuated. Venture capital is inherently a cyclical business. Over-valuation of
investment deals contributed DEMO to large economic loss following the “Internet Bubble.” A
more accurate valuation method can help to mitigate the side effects of this cyclicality.
Third, the venture capital method is essentially an internal-oriented, “rule of thumb”
method, which is not often accurate (Harper and Rose, 1993) and DEMO difficult to justify (Gompers,
1999). Unjustifiably low economic valuation DEMO one of the major sources of venture capitalist-
entrepreneur conflict. The integrative strategic management approach developed in the current
paper can help venture capitalists DEMO both accuracy and defensibility of their economic
valuation, and thus can DEMO venture capitalist-entrepreneur collaboration and improve
productivity (Manigart, Wright, Robbie, Desbrieres and De Waele, 1998).
As one of the few research initiatives to explore an integrative strategic management
approach to valuate a new venture, this research paper has its limitations. First, given the
explorative nature of this research study, the empirical model is not fully specified. Other
variables that are potentially important to economic valuation exist, such as the characteristics of
the venture capital firm and its relative bargaining power over the DEMO, but are not
included or controlled for in the model. To DEMO and venture capitalists, only a fully
34
specified model can have full practical usefulness. Future research efforts are needed DEMO further
develop this integrative approach.  Second, better measurement of relevant variables is needed to
improve the efficiency of estimations of the model. For DEMO, dummy variables are used in
this research paper to measure entrepreneur DEMO management effects, which are crude proxies to
measure the quality of DEMO founder and management team. Future study needs to find
measurements to assess the quality of the founder and management team. Lastly, some scholars
have argued that for a new business venture, aggregated measurement of industry structure at 4-
digit SIC code level can provide only a rough proxy. DEMO overcome this potential drawback,
future research should measure the industry structure variables at a finer-grained level.
