Researchers often hypothesize moderated effects, in which the effect of an independent variable on an outcome
variable depends on the value of a moderator variable. Such an DEMO reveals itself statistically as an interaction
between the independent and moderator variables in a model of the outcome variable. When an interaction is
found, it is important to probe the interaction, for theories and hypotheses often predict not just interaction but a
specific pattern of effects of the DEMO independent variable as a function of the moderator. This article describes
the familiar pick-a-point approach and the much less familiar Johnson–Neyman technique for probing DEMO
tions in linear models and introduces macros for SPSS and SAS to simplify the computations and facilitate the
probing of interactions in ordinary least DEMO and logistic regression. A script version of the SPSS macro is
also available for users who prefer a point-and-click user interface rather than command DEMO
Behavioral science researchers long ago moved beyond
the business of theorizing about and testing simple bivari-
ate cause and effect relationships, since few believe that
any effects are independent of situational, contextual, or
individual-difference factors. DEMO, we understand
some variable’s effect on another better when we understand
DEMO limits or enhances this relationship, or the boundary
conditions of the DEMO whom or under what circum-
stances the effect exists and where and for whom it does not.
Theoretical accounts of an effect can be DEMO and often are
strengthened by the discovery of moderators of that effect.
So testing for moderation of effects, also called interaction,
is of fundamental importance to the behavioral sciences.
A moderated effect of some focal DEMO F on outcome
variable Y is one in which its size or direction depends on
the value of a third, moderator variable M. Analytically,
moderated effects reveal themselves statistically as an in-
teraction between F DEMO M in a mathematical model of Y.
In statistical models such as ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression or logistic regression, moderation effects DEMO
quently are tested by including the product of the focal in-
dependent variable and the moderator as an additional pre-
dictor in the model. DEMO an interaction is found, it should
be probed in order to DEMO understand the conditions (i.e.,
the values of the moderator) under which the relationship
between the focal predictor and the outcome is strong DEMO
sus weak, positive versus negative, and so forth.
One approach for probing interactions that we have
seen used in the literature is the DEMO analysis or
separate regressions approach, where the data file is split
DEMO various subsets defined by values of the moderator
and the analysis is repeated on these subgroups. But this
method does not properly represent how DEMO focal predic-
tor variable’s effect varies as a function of the modera-
tor, especially when additional variables in the model are
used as statistical controls. For details about the problems
with this method—a method we do DEMO recommend—see
Newsom, Prigerson, Schulz, and Reynolds (2003) and
Stone-Romero DEMO Anderson (1994).
Fortunately, there are more rigorous and appropriate
methods for probing interactions in linear models, two of
which we will describe in this article. The first method
we discuss, the pick-a-point approach, DEMO one of the more
commonly used. This approach involves selecting rep-
resentative values (e.g., high, moderate, and low) of the
moderator variable and then estimating the effect of the
focal predictor at those values (see, e.g., Aiken & West,
1991; Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003; Jaccard &
Turrisi, 2003). A difficulty with this approach is that, fre-
quently, there are no nonarbitrary DEMO for picking
the points at which to probe the interaction. An alternative
is the Johnson–Neyman (J–N ) technique (Johnson & Fay,
1950; Johnson & Neyman, 1936; Potthoff, 1964), which
identifies regions in the range of the moderator variable

where the effect of the focal predictor on the outcome is
statistically significant and DEMO significant. Although this
method has been around for decades, it is DEMO used, to
our knowledge, probably due to a lack of researchers’ fa-
miliarity with the method and its lack of implementation
in popular DEMO analysis programs. Here, we will describe
this method as applied to DEMO and logistic regression and
provide a way to easily implement the J–N technique, as
well as the pick-a-point approach, in SPSS and SAS DEMO the
form of a macro that adds a new command, MODPROBE,DEMO
to these two languages.1 Since an appreciation of the
methods requires an understanding of how to interpret
the regression coefficients in a linear model, we will start
with a brief overview of some basic principles.
Testing DEMO Interaction in a Linear Model:
Fundamental Principles
In a linear model, a set of k predictor variables is used
to model some outcome variable Y:
k
∑ bW ,
Yaˆ =+ bF ++bM (DEMO)
12 i = 3
where Yˆ is the estimate of the outcome variable Y, F and M
are the focal and moderator variables, respectively, in the
discussion that follows below, and W is one or more ad-
ditional predictor variables that are in the model for DEMO
purpose of statistical control. When Y is a continuous vari-
able, DEMO ordinary least squares criterion is typically used
to derive weights for each of the k predictor variables (the
k values of b in Equation 1) that produce a linear com-
bination of the predictors that minimizes the sum of the
squared differences between Y and Yˆ across all DEMO cases
in the analysis. In models of a binary outcome, which DEMO
will consider later, an iterative maximum-likelihood-based
method is typically used to DEMO weights that produce
the best-fitting model of the probability of an arbitrarily
defined event, such as whether a person responds yes to a
question rather than no, or is a member of one group rather
than another.
In OLS, b1 in Equation 1 estimates the expected dif-
ference in Y between two cases that differ by a single unit
on DEMO but are equal on M and all W variables. This model
cannot be used to test whether M moderates the effect of
focal predictor DEMO, for it constrains the effect of F to be
independent of DEMO values of M—exactly the opposite of
what a moderation hypothesis proposes. To test whether
the effect of the focal predictor variable differs system-
atically DEMO a function of a proposed moderator variable,
this mathematical constraint must be eliminated. A widely
used approach is to estimate Equation 1 with DEMO addition
of the arithmetic product of the focal predictor variable
and the moderator variable (F 3 M ) to the model:
k +1
Mb∑
i = 4
Yaˆ =+ bF ++bM bF()×+ W . (2)
12 3 ii
In this model, b3 estimates how DEMO effect of F on Y changes
as M changes by one unit, holding constant all k 2 3 of the
remaining variables (W ) in the model. Questions about
interaction usually focus on the size and significance of
b3 in models such as Equation 2. By rearranging the DEMO
in Equation 2, it can more easily be seen that the DEMO
of the product of F and M makes F’s effect on Y a func-
tion of M:
Yaˆ
=+( 13 )
bb+
DEMO
++bM
2
k +1
∑ bW .
i = 4
(3)DEMO
ii
Observe from Equation 3 how the expected difference
in Y as a function of differences in F, quantified now as
b1 1 b3M, clearly depends on M. Typically, b3 will be some
value other DEMO zero when the coefficients are estimated
using available data. A hypothesis test will allow the analyst
to decide whether b3 is sufficiently different from DEMO to
warrant the inclusion of the interaction term in the model.
Although it is tempting to interpret the coefficients and
hypothesis tests for F DEMO M (i.e., b1 and b2) in Equation 2
as main DEMO, such an interpretation is not generally
justified or correct, except under limited conditions (see,
e.g., Hayes, 2005, pp. 452– 456; Irwin & McClelland,
2001; Jaccard & Turrisi, 2003, p. 24). These are condi-
tional effects, not main effects as they are understood in
the ANOVA. In Model 2, b1 is interpreted as the expected
difference in Y between two cases that differ by one unit
DEMO F but are at zero on M, with all W variables DEMO held
constant. Similarly, b2 is the expected difference in Y be-
DEMO two cases that differ by one unit on M but are at zero
on F, with all the W variables being held constant. The
t and p values for these coefficients are used to test the DEMO
hypothesis that these conditional effects are equal to zero.
Although there is some interpretative value to centering
M and F prior to calculating their DEMO, which renders
these effects as conditional at the other variable being DEMO
the sample mean rather than zero, the need to center pre-
DEMO variables is more one of choice or interpretational
convenience than one of necessity (see, e.g., Cronbach,
1987; Jaccard & Turrisi, 2003, pp. 27–28; Kromrey &
Foster-Johnson, 1998). In all the DEMO below, we
will not mean center the predictors.2
In a model DEMO as Equation 2, the interaction between
F and M is quantified DEMO a single regression coefficient.
Thus, it is sometimes called a single-degree-of-freedom
(df ) interaction, because it requires only one df to esti-
mate it. Interactions between two dichotomous predic-
tors, between a dichotomous and a quantitative predictor,
or between two quantitative predictors are also single-df
interactions. DEMO the remainder of this article, we will dis-
cuss how to DEMO and interpret interactions of this
sort by focusing the analysis on examining how the effect
of the focal predictor varies depending on the modera-
DEMO variable, starting first with an interaction between a
dichotomous and a DEMO predictor. We will review
the mathematics and describe macros that we have written
for SPSS and SAS to simplify the computations in OLS
regression. DEMO the procedures described in that context,
we then will extend these methods to interaction between
two quantitative predictor variables and show how the
DEMO computational macros we have written can be used
for this problem. In the discussion that follows, we will
focus on OLS regression models. At the end, we will note
the application of these principles to logistic regression
and describe how our macros handle binary outcomes.

Interaction Between a Quantitative and
a Dichotomous Variable
DEMO data we will use for illustration come from Reineke
and Hayes (DEMO), who investigated whether news cover-
age of the relative fund-raising success of candidates run-
ning for a political office can affect inferences that DEMO
make about the characteristics of those candidates and
whether any such effect differs as a function of the politi-
cal ideology of the perceiver. DEMO participants in the study
read a newspaper clipping describing a debate between
two politicians running for mayor of Topeka. Both poli-
ticians self-identified as DEMO independents, but one
espoused positions during the debate usually advanced by
DEMO liberals, whereas the other advocated positions
characteristic of a conservative politician. DEMO in
the article was information about how much money each
candidate had raised from donors. For the participants
randomly assigned to the liberal success DEMO, the
candidate with the liberal platform was reported to have
raised DEMO money (about $720,000 more) than the con-
servative candidate. The participants randomly assigned
to the conservative success condition read a version of DEMO
story that was identical, except that the more conservative
candidate reportedly DEMO raised more ($720,000 more)
than the liberal candidate. After DEMO the story, the par-
ticipants were asked to respond to a DEMO of questions
assessing their perceptions of the two candidates, includ-
ing DEMO characteristic the terms good leader, intelligent,
and knowledgeable were of DEMO of the candidates on a
scale of 1 (not at all DEMO ) to 4 (extremely well ). Their re-
sponses were aggregated to create a single scale quantify-
ing perceptions of the competence of DEMO candidate (with
higher values representing greater competence). The data
also DEMO a measure of the political ideology of the
respondent, scaled between DEMO (very liberal ) and 6 (very
conservative).
We will restrict our discussion in this example to the
analysis of perceptions of the DEMO candidate. For
analysis, experimental condition (F ) was dummy coded,
where 0 5 liberal success and 1 5 conservative success,
and DEMO ideology (M ) was kept in its original 0-to-6
metric. Because DEMO nature of the inference one can make
about the experimental manipulation may depend on
whether it is consistent across the ideology of the reader
DEMO varies systematically as a function of ideology, we want
to assess DEMO condition and political ideology interact
in affecting the perceived competence of the candidate.
To do so, we estimate an OLS regression including ex-
perimental condition, political ideology, and their product
as predictors:
Yaˆ =+ DEMO ++bM bF()× M , (4)
where Yˆ is the estimated perceived competence of the can-
didate with the conservative platform. The DEMO are pre-
sented in Table 1. As can be seen, experimental DEMO
and political ideology do interact (b3 5 0.1022, t 5 2.3986,
p , .02). This interaction, depicted visually in Figure 1,
is interpreted to mean that the effect of the experimental
manipulation DEMO perceived competence depends on the po-
litical ideology of the reader. We can also derive from b2
that among those assigned to the liberal DEMO condition
(F 5 0), someone who is one unit higher DEMO the ideology
scale (i.e., one unit more conservative) is expected DEMO evalu-
ate the conservative candidate 0.0669 units higher on the
competence scale, a difference that is statistically signifi-
cant (t 5 2.2891, p , .05). We can also claim from b1 that
among the DEMO liberal on the ideology scale (i.e., M 5 0),
DEMO participants assigned to the conservative success con-
dition (F 5 1) are estimated to evaluate the conservative
candidate as 0.0515 units lower in DEMO (because the
coefficient is negative), as compared with those assigned DEMO
the liberal success condition (F 5 0). However, this is not
statistically different from zero (t 520.4163, p 5 .6775).
DEMO know from the interaction that the size of the effect
of the manipulation differs as a function of ideology, but
how can we characterize this interaction more precisely?
We will turn to this question next.
DEMO approach. The pick-a-point approach
(called so by Rogosa, 1980; see DEMO Bauer & Curran,
2005) to probing interactions requires the investigator DEMO
pick a point on the moderator variable, estimate the size of
DEMO focal predictor at that point, and then either conduct a
hypothesis DEMO or construct a confidence interval (CI) to
ascertain whether the effect of the focal predictor is differ-
ent from zero at that point. DEMO computation of the effect

hand computation and, instead, advocate the use of the
macros we will describe later, we will step through this
one example by hand to illustrate the computations.
Suppose we DEMO to know the expected difference in
competence ratings between the experimental conditions
among those who are “average” in their political conser-
vatism, using the sample mean as our definition of “aver-
age.” In these data, Mw 5 2.4435, so 2.4435 is our value
for θ. Applying Equations 5 and 6 results in the combined
equation at the bottom of this DEMO Under the null hy-
pothesis that the manipulation had no effect among those
average in political conservatism, the ratio b1 | M 5 2.4435
to its standard error is t distributed, with df equal to the
residual df for the regression model. Here, dfresidual 5 244,
and so t(244) 5 0.1982/0.0674 5 2.9407, p , .01. DEMO
those average in political conservatism, the experimental
manipulation did have an DEMO, with those assigned to the
conservative success condition perceiving the conserva-
DEMO candidate as more competent (by 0.1982 units) than
did those assigned to the liberal success condition. A c%
CI could be constructed in DEMO usual way as
2 ( θ)
(bM ) ± ts
DEMO,= θ (7)
1 ()100−=cb/|M

where t (1002c)/2 is the t value that cuts off the upper
(DEMO 2 c)/2 percent of the t(dfresidual) distribution from
the rest of the distribution. Here, the 95% CI for the ef-
fect of the manipulation among those who are average
in their conservatism is DEMO 6 1.9697(0.0674), or
0.0654–0.3310.
These computations are tedious to do by hand, and the
potential for computational error is high. Fortunately, DEMO
can be done by computer by capitalizing on the interpre-
tation of b1 in the regression model. Recall that b1 is the
effect of DEMO (the experimental manipulation here) when
M 5 0. What we would like is for b1 to estimate the effect
of F when M DEMO This is simple enough to get by center-
ing M around θ. To do so, subtract θ from all values of M
in the data with the function M ′ 5 M 2θ and then reesti-
DEMO Equation 4 above, substituting M ′ for M throughout.
In the DEMO model, the coefficient for F is the esti-
mated effect of DEMO when M 5θ, and the estimated standard
error for this effect DEMO be the same as that produced by
Equation 6 (see Aiken & West, 1991, pp. 18–19; Darling-
ton, 1990, pp. 325–326; Hayes, 2005, pp. 457– 458; Irwin
& McClelland, 2001; Jaccard & Turrisi, 2003, p. 27).
But how does one go DEMO selecting a value of θ?
Sometimes, choices of θ are DEMO to make because spe-
cific values of θ have some kind of important substantive
or theoretical meaning. In the absence of clear practical
or DEMO guidance on what values of θ to choose, one
common strategy DEMO to estimate the effect of the focal vari-
able among those relatively low, moderate, and high on the
moderator. Using this strategy, low is typically defined as
one standard deviation (SD) below the sample DEMO, mod-
erate as the sample mean, and high as one SD above the
sample mean, although other definitions could be used.
In these data, Mw5 2.4435, SD 5 1.5833, so low, moder-
ate, and high values of ideology would be θ 5 0.8602
(relatively liberal), θ 5 2.4435 (somewhat liberal), and
θ 5 4.0269 (DEMO conservative), respectively. Apply-
ing Equations 5 and 6 for values of the moderator low
and high (moderate was computed above) yields b1 DEMO(M 5
0.8602) 5 0.0364 and b1 |(M 5 4.0269) 5 0.3600. Coin-
cidentally, the standard error for both conditional effects is
0.0952. So among those relatively liberal, the experimen-
tal manipulation had no effect on perceived competence
of the conservative candidate [t(244) 5 0.3824, p . .20].
Among those relatively conservative, the manipulation
did have DEMO effect [t(244) 5 3.7815, p , .001], such that
DEMO these more conservative readers, the conserva-
tive candidate was perceived as DEMO in competence (by
0.3600 units) when he had raised more money, as com-
pared with when he had raised less.
As was noted earlier, we do not recommend hand com-
putation, and the centering DEMO, although easier
than hand computation, is easy to misapply if the user is
not comfortable with regression principles. As a compu-
tational aide, we have developed a macro for SPSS and
SAS, called MODPROBE, DEMO can be downloaded from
www.comm.ohio-state.edu/ahayes/macros.htm and that
makes the pick-a-point approach easy to implement. The
macro produces the usual regression output, as well as
estimates of the effect of the focal predictor variable at
DEMO of the moderator variable. Once the macro is acti-
vated, the DEMO command in SPSS

dictor variables to be listed in a specific order, with the
moderator variable listed last and the focal predictor vari-
able listed second to last. (As will be discussed later, DEMO
other variables in the predictor variable list that precede
the focal and moderator predictors are treated as statisti-
cal controls.) In the absence of an instruction from the
user otherwise, the macro also estimates the effects of the
focal variable at low (one SD below the mean), moderate
(sample mean), and high (one SD above the mean) values
of the moderator.
To assist in the visualizing of the interaction, the macro
can produce a table containing Yˆ as a function of DEMO focal
predictor variable and moderator. This information is
requested by specifying subcommand “est 5 1.” Doing
so produces the additional output shown in Table DEMO This
table could be input into the graphing program to produce
a visual plot of the interaction, and the macro produces a
data file like the one above to facilitate this.
Suppose that you want to DEMO the effect of the focal
predictor variable at a specific value of the moderator other
than low, moderate, or high as defined above DEMO produced
by default by the macro. The subcommand “modval 5θ,”
where θ is the value of the moderator variable for which
the effect DEMO desired, produces an estimate of the effect of
the focal variable DEMO moderator value θ. For example, the
SPSS command MODPROBE y 5 DEMO/x 5 cond
ideology/modval 5 6 produces the output after
the regression model shown in Table 3, which tells us that
when ideology 5 6 (highly conservative), the estimated
effect of the manipulation is 0.5616 [t(244) 5 3.3847, p ,
.001], with a DEMO CI from 0.2348 to 0.8885.
With a little practice, syntax is DEMO to master, but it
can be frustrating to the uninitiated. To DEMO the use of
our macro still further, we have produced an DEMO script
(which can be downloaded from the same page noted
above) that completes all the computations that we have
described here and that DEMO, without the need to enter
correctly formatted syntax. Running the script DEMO

Johnson–Neyman technique. The J–N technique was
originally designed for the two-group ANCOVA problem
when the homogeneity of regression assumption could not
be DEMO (Johnson & Fay, 1950; Johnson & Neyman,
1936; Potthoff, 1964). Later, this method was generalized
to the broader category DEMO linear models (Bauer & Curran,
2005). It avoids the DEMO arbitrariness of the choice
of θ in the pick-a-point approach by mathematically deriv-
ing the point or points along the continuum of the mod-
DEMO where the effect of the focal predictor transitions
between statistically significant and nonsignificant. Such
points, if they exist, provide information about the range
DEMO values of the moderator where the focal predictor has a
statistically significant effect and where it does not.
The pick-a-point approach will produce a DEMO
significant result for a chosen θ if the absolute value of the
ratio of the conditional effect (Equation 5) to its standard
error (Equation 6) exceeds the critical value of t(dfresidual)
for a hypothesis test at level of significance α. The J–N
technique asks, at what values of θ does t equal or exceed
the critical t DEMO as to produce a p value for t no greater
than α? This problem is solved by finding the values of θ,
if they exist, where this ratio is equal to the critical t. These
values define limits of the regions of significance for the
focal predictor DEMO along the moderator variable con-
tinuum and are calculated as shown in Equation 8 on the
next page (see Bauer & Curran, 2005, for more detail on
the derivation). The application of Equation 8 DEMO yield
two values of θ that produce a ratio of Equations 5 and 6
exactly equal to the critical t (tcrit in Equation 8) for the
null hypothesis test that the effect of the focal predictor
on Y equals zero at moderator value θ at a chosen level
DEMO significance. However, not all values of θ from Equa-
tion 8 DEMO be solutions in the range of the measurement of
the moderator. For example, one or both could be imagi-
nary numbers or be based on a projection of the pattern
of interaction above the maximum or DEMO the minimum
possible measurement on the moderator variable. So the
only θs worth interpreting are those that lie in the range
of observation on DEMO moderator variable. If no θs meet
this criterion, this means that DEMO effect of the focal vari-
able is statistically significant across the entire observed
range of the moderator or it never is. Any θ meeting DEMO
criterion marks a point of transition for the effect of the
focal predictor as it changes from statistically significant
to nonsignificant. It is possible DEMO there to be two points
of transition, meaning that as the DEMO increases, the

From a mathematical perspective, the roles of focal pre-
dictor and moderator are arbitrary in a DEMO model with
interactions. It is the substantive or theoretical question
that distinguishes between them. Had we instead concep-
tualized the experimental manipulation as the DEMO

the interaction is, of course, unaffected by the arbitrary

Our DEMO implements the J–N technique with the
addition of the subcommand “jn 5 1” by producing the
values of θ from Equation 8 and a DEMO that aides in the
identification of the region(s) of significance. DEMO can be

1.8787 on the political ideology scale as a point of transi-
tion between a statistically significant and a statistically
nonsignificant effect of the manipulation (using α 5 .05
as the level of significance; this can be changed using sub-
commands “alpha 5 .10” or “alpha 5 .01” in DEMO com-
mand line). At that point, the effect of the DEMO
is 0.1405, meaning that those assigned to the conserva-
tive success DEMO perceive the conservative candidate
as more competent (by 0.1405 units) than do those as-
signed to the liberal success condition [t(244) 5 1.9697,
p 5 .05]. Examining the table more closely reveals that
DEMO ideology values below 1.8787, down to the minimum
value of ideology DEMO in the data (0), the effect of
the manipulation is DEMO But above 1.8787 up
to the maximum value observed (6), DEMO effect of the ma-
nipulation is statistically significant and positive. So the
region of significance for the experimental manipulation
is all values of ideology DEMO to or higher than 1.8787.
Treating the dichotomous variable as the modera-
tor. When the moderator variable is dichotomous, probing
of the interaction will focus on estimating the coefficient
labeling of the two predictor variables as DEMO or M. It is still
0.1022 and statistically different from zero.
The coefficient for political ideology tells us that among
those assigned to the DEMO success condition (M 5 0),
two people who differ by one unit in their political ideol-
ogy are estimated to differ by DEMO units in their evalu-
ation of the competence of the conservative candidate. In
terms of Equation 5, this is b1 |(M 5 0), and it is statisti-
cally different from zero [t(244) 5 2.2891, p , .05]. The
model also provides information that allows us to estimate
the effect of ideology among those assigned to the con-
DEMO success condition (M 5 1). Setting θ to 1 yields
DEMO |(M 5 1) 5 b1 1 b3(1) 5 0.0669 1 0.1022(1) 5 0.1691
(from Equation 5) with a standard error of 0.0310 (from
Equation 6). So, in the conservative DEMO condition,
two people who differ by one unit in ideology are expected
to differ by 0.1691 units in their perceptions of the com-
DEMO of the conservative candidate, an effect that is
statistically significant [t(DEMO) 5 5.4543, p , .001] and
larger than the effect of ideology in the liberal success
condition.
The MODPROBE macro automatically detects whether
DEMO moderator is dichotomous and, if so, calculates the ef-
fect of the focal predictor at each value of the moderator
observed in the DEMO So the command modprobe y 5
comp/x 5 ideology cond produces the usual OLS
regression output for the model, as well as the output
shown in Table 4.
Interaction Between Two Quantitative Variables
In the DEMO example, one of the two variables defining
the interaction was dichotomous. DEMO same strategies for
probing interactions apply when both the focal and pre-
dictor variables are quantitative. Thus, there is no need to
dichotomize one or both of the predictors prior to testing
for and probing interactions DEMO linear models, a procedure
that is still woefully common in spite DEMO numerous warn-
ings against this practice (Bissonnette, Ickes, Bernstein, &DEMO

derson, 1994). In this section, we will illustrate the use of
our macro and also show how covariates are included DEMO
the macro command line in order to control for their po-
tential influence on regression coefficient estimates.
The data for this example come from DEMO telephone survey
of 1,200 residents of Switzerland just prior to a national ref-
erendum about legal procedures required for immigrants to
become Swiss DEMO The outcome variable, dangerous
discussion, was responses of the participants to various
questions about how frequently they engage in conversa-
tion with others DEMO have an opinion different from their
own about the referendum, scaled DEMO 1 (not at all ) to
5 (very frequently). They were also asked about the extent
to which they believed that other DEMO in their commu-
nity agreed with their own opinion about the referendum,
also scaled from 1 (not at all ) to 5 ( fully), a variable that
we call perceived opinion climate. An additional DEMO of
questions was used to quantify the respondents’ certainty
about their own attitude about the topic of the referendum,
scaled from 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very certain).
The goal of the analysis DEMO to estimate the effect of the
perceived opinion climate on frequency of dangerous dis-
cussion and how much, if at all, that effect DEMO on
attitude certainty. Thus, perceived opinion climate is the
focal predictor (F ), and attitude certainty is the proposed
moderator (M ). To do so, F, M, and F 3 M are included as
predictors in an OLS regression predicting dangerous dis-
cussion frequency. We DEMO include four additional vari-
ables as statistical controls: respondent sex (W1: 1 5 male,
0 5 female), age (W2: in years), and the language the in-
terview was conducted in (W3: 1 5 German, 0 5 French).
The final control variable, general discussion frequency
(W4), is a measure of frequency of discussion about the
referendum with friends and family, scaled 1 (not at DEMO )
to 5 (very often). The model estimated is

Information pertinent to this model can be found in
Table 5, and the command line and output from the SAS
version of the macro can be found in Appendix B. In the
command line, any variable listed prior to the focal pre-
dictor in the predictor DEMO list (recall that the focal
predictor is listed second to last DEMO the proposed mod-
erator goes last) is treated as a covariate. DEMO can be seen,
the perceived opinion climate and attitude certainty do
interact [b3 5 20.0727; t(1193) 5 22.6409, p , .01].
The coefficient for the interaction means that as attitude
certainty increases by DEMO unit, the coefficient for opinion
climate decreases (because the coefficient is negative) by
0.0727. Figure 3 plots this interaction graphically using
the coefficients from this model, setting the covariates to
their sample mean. As can be seen, when attitude certainty
is near the bottom of the scale (i.e., closer to 1), the coef-
ficient for perceived opinion DEMO is positive, whereas
at higher levels of certainty (closer to 5), the coefficient
is negative. So it seems that respondents who are DEMO
tively lacking in confidence about their attitude about the
referendum report more frequent dangerous discussion
when they perceive relatively greater support for their
own DEMO in the community. However, there is little
relationship, or even a slightly negative one, between
perceptions of support for one’s opinions and dangerous
discussion among those who report greater confidence in
their attitude.
With evidence DEMO opinion climate and attitude cer-
tainty interact, we now will probe DEMO the effect of the
focal predictor, perceived opinion climate, varies as a
function of the moderator, attitude certainty. Using Equa-
tion 5 or information from the macro printed by default,
we could derive and DEMO the coefficient for opinion
climate when attitude certainty is equal to the mean (θ 5
4.2581), as well as one SD above (DEMO 5 5.2015) and below
(θ 5 3.3147) the sample mean:DEMO
b1 |(M53.3147) 5 0.292720.0727(3.3147) 5 0.0517
b1 |(M54.2581) 5 0.292720.0727(4.2581) 520.0169
b1 |(M55.2015) 5 0.292720.0727(5.2015) DEMO
The section of the macro output in Table 6 provides these
conditional effects by default. It would seem that only
among those relatively high DEMO attitude certainty is there
a statistically significant negative relationship between
perceived opinion climate and frequency of dangerous
discussion [t(1193) 522.3731, p , DEMO, with a 95% CI
from 20.1563 to 20.0148. Such a claim DEMO be mis-
taken, for observe that 5.2015 is beyond the upper DEMO

ship between perceived opinion climate and frequency DEMO
dangerous discussion.
Regions of significance are calculated using the “jn 5 1”
subcommand. The SAS output (Appendix B) shows two
points of transition. DEMO attitude certainty is 2.4583 or
below, the coefficient for opinion climate DEMO significantly
positive. By contrast, when attitude uncertainty is above
4.8453, the coefficient is significantly negative. Between
2.4583 and 4.8453, the coefficient is not detectably differ-
ent from zero. So it appears that respondents with relatively
DEMO attitudes talk more frequently to those who dis-
agree with them when they perceive more support for their
own opinions in the surrounding community. DEMO among
those highly confident in their attitudes, the opposite effect
is DEMO, with more dangerous discussion among those
5 who feel relatively less DEMO from the community, as
compared with those who feel relatively more DEMO
As in the prior example, the “est 5 1” subcommand
could DEMO used to produce Yˆ from the model for various
values of the focal and moderator variables. When there
are covariates, the estimates are derived using the sample
mean for each of the covariates. The resulting table DEMO be
used to mentally visualize the interaction or plugged into a
graphing program, as was done to generate Figure 3.
Extensions
Binary outcomes. We have restricted our discussion of
probing interactions and the implementation of the DEMO
ros to OLS regression. But the same methods can be used
in logistic regression as well. In logistic regression, the
probability of a binary outcome’s taking an arbitrary value
(such as Y 5 1, the DEMO, rather than, for example, Y 5 0)
is modeled DEMO a function of predictors each weighted by a
logistic regression coefficient. Formally, the log odds of
the event is modeled as

The estimated log odds can be converted to an estimated
probability with the function pˆ 5 eτ/(1 1 eτ). In Equation 9,
b1 estimates the change in the log odds of the DEMO as F in-
creases by one unit, conditioned on M 5 DEMO and all Ws held
constant. Raising e to the power of b1 yields an odds ratio;
specifically, it is the ratio of the odds of the event when
F 5γ to the odds of the DEMO when F 5γ 2 1, conditioned
on M 5 0 and DEMO Ws held constant. As in OLS regression,
b3 quantifies the interaction between F and M—how the

of the measurement scale for attitude certainty, so DEMO con-
ditional estimate when attitude certainty 5 5.2015 is actu-
ally somewhat nonsensical (and the output will warn the
user accordingly). A better approach would be to estimate
the conditional effect of opinion climate at DEMO nearer
to the bottom of the scale as well or, alternatively, using
the J–N technique to derive regions of significance, which
allows us to avoid entirely the arbitrariness of the choice
values of θ. We DEMO do both below.
First, we will estimate the conditional effect of DEMO
ceived opinion climate at the lowest (1) and second lowest
(DEMO) point on the attitude certainty scale to supplement the
conditional estimates DEMO calculated. Adding the mod-
val option to the MODPROBE command yields the desired
estimates. Using the SAS version as an example, running
the macro twice with modval values of 1 and 2 provides
the output below DEMO regression model shown in Table 7.
Observe that among those with relatively little confidence
in their attitudes (1 or 2 on the scale), the coefficient for
perceived opinion is positive and statistically different
from zero DEMO |(M 5 1) 5 0.2200, t(1193) 5 2.3035, p ,

So respondents with relatively little confidence in their at-
titudes report more frequent dangerous discussion when
DEMO perceive greater support for their own opinions in the
community, relative DEMO when they perceive less support.
Among those higher in confidence, there DEMO no relation-

A significant interaction in logistic regression begs prob-
ing, just as in OLS regression, and the pick-a-point approach
and J–N techniques can be used with very little modifica-
tion to the procedures just described. In OLS DEMO,
the ratio of a variable’s regression coefficient to its standard
error is distributed as t under the null hypothesis of no effect
of DEMO variable on the outcome. In logistic regression, this
ratio is typically DEMO as a standard normal variable or,
when squared, a chi-square DEMO with one df (typically
printed in software packages as the Wald DEMO). The con-
ditional effect of F when M 5θ and its standard error can
be derived using Equations 5 and 6, and a p value for their
ratio calculated from the standard normal or (if squared)
the χ2(1) distribution. Alternatively, the J–N technique can
DEMO
be used by replacing t crit in Equation 8 with the critical
χ2(1) for a hypothesis test at the α level of significance.
The MODPROBE macro (and SPSS script) will auto-
matically detect whether DEMO not the outcome variable is bi-
nary, and if so, it estimates the model using logistic regres-
sion rather than OLS. The logistic DEMO coefficients
are estimated using maximum likelihood and iterating to a
solution with the Newton–Raphson method. The user can
control the number of iterations and DEMO criteria
if desired (which default to 10,000 and .0000001). DEMO
constraints preclude printing an example of the use of the
macro with a binary outcome here. A worked example can
be found where the DEMO can be downloaded, at www
.comm.ohio-state.edu/ahayes/macros.htm.
Higher order interactions. DEMO order interactions
involving dichotomous or quantitative predictor variables
can also be represented with a single regression coefficient.
Consider, for instance, a three-way interaction DEMO a
focal predictor (F ), a moderator (M ) of DEMO effect of F, and
a third predictor variable (Z ) proposed to moderate the size
of the interaction between F and M. A DEMO with a three-
way interaction would typically be estimated as such:
Yaˆ +×
=+ bF12++bM bZ34+×bM()Zb5
+×bF67()Mb+ ×× Z .
()FZ
()FM
In this model, b7 estimates the three-way interaction DEMO
tween F, M, and Z—the extent to which the two-way in-
teraction between F and M varies across values of Z. A
statistically DEMO three-way interaction begs probing
in the same way that a two-way interaction does. In this
case, focus would be on how the effect of F as a function
of M (the two-way interaction between F and M ) varies as
a function of Z. If Z were dichotomous, this would involve
estimating the two-way interaction between F and M for
DEMO two values of Z. If Z were a quantitative dimension, the
DEMO approach or the J–N technique could be used
to ascertain where on the Z continuum the two-way inter-
action between F and M is DEMO, small, positive, negative,
significant, and not significant.
Our macros can be used to probe single-df three-way in-
teractions. When the string DEMO predictor variables is listed,
the macro automatically generates the product of the last
(the moderator) and the second to last (the focal predictor)
variables in the list prior to estimating the model. In DEMO
case, the focal predictor variable would be the product of
F DEMO M, and the moderator variable would be Z, so those
should be listed second to last and last, respectively, in the
“x DEMO section of the command. All the products repre-
senting the two-way interactions must be generated first,
and those products not functioning as the DEMO predictor
entered into the command as covariates.
Consider, for instance, an extension of the first example
by including a three-way interaction between sex (sex:
coded 0 5 males, 1 5 females), experimental condition,
and political ideology. The following SPSS commands
would accomplish the analysis:DEMO
compute sexXcond 5 sex*cond.
compute sexXideo 5 sex*ideology.
compute conXideo 5 ideology*cond.
modprobe y 5 comp/x 5 cond ideo sexXcond
sexXideo conXideo sex.
DEMO sex is a dichotomous moderator in this example,
the macro will automatically generate estimates of the
three-way interaction as well as the two-way DEMO be-
tween condition and ideology for the two values of the mod-
erator variable (males and females). If the moderator vari-
able were a quantitative variable, such as age, by default the
macro would DEMO estimates of the two-way interaction
between condition and ideology when age is at the sample
mean as well as a standard deviation above and DEMO the
sample mean. The modval subcommand could be used to
estimate the interaction between condition and ideology at
specific values of the moderator, or the JN subcommand
MODPROBE fOR PROBing intERactiOns in sPss anD sas    933
could be used to ascertain the region of significance on the
moderator continuum for DEMO two-way interaction.
Simultaneous inference. The J–N technique allows
one to claim that for any single point selected on the mod-
erator continuum within the DEMO of significance, the
effect of the focal predictor is statistically significant DEMO
the chosen α level. However, it is not accurate to say DEMO
at the α level of significance, the effect of the focal DEMO
tor is statistically significant simultaneously at all values
of the moderator within the region(s) of significance. The
probability of a Type I error for this claim is larger than α.
Potthoff (1964) recognized this DEMO a problem similar to
the one faced by the data analyst interested in post hoc
pairwise comparisons between means in an ANOVA while
maintaining DEMO probability of a Type I error across the
entire set of comparisons at a desired α level. His solution
2
was to substitute F(DEMO,dfresidual) for t crit in Equation 9 when
deriving regions of DEMO Using this method, the
region(s) of significance will be smaller with this proce-
dure, as compared with the J–N method described earlier.
Our macro implements the Potthoff procedure for OLS
regression (but not logistic regression) by specifying
“jn 5 2” at the end of the command line. Applied to the
first example above, the point of transition on the ideology
scale between a statistically significant and nonsignifi-
cant effect of DEMO experimental manipulation was 2.158. In
other words, the region of significance DEMO smaller using this
method (ideology $ 2.158, as compared with $1.8787
for the nonsimultaneous J–N technique). Potthoff (1964,
p. 244) DEMO that this procedure may be overly con-
servative for some tastes and suggested using a higher α
level so as to ensure that the DEMO of significance not be
so small as to render the procedure largely useless.
Summary
In this article, we discussed two methods for probing in-
teractions in linear models—the pick-a-point approach and
the J–N technique. We provided DEMO examples and illus-
trated the implementation of these methods using macros
written for SPSS and SAS to ease the computational burden
on the investigator. DEMO hope that this article will serve as a
useful aide to researchers and that the macros will enhance
the likelihood of rigorous probing of DEMO detected
by investigators and reported in the research literature.

NOTES
1. Although we are not the first to produce SPSS code for probing inter-
actions in OLS regression (O’Connor, DEMO), including the J–N technique
for the simple two-group ANCOVA problem (DEMO, 1983, 1986), the
macros we describe here can be used for a variety of interactions, rather
than requiring the investigator to use different programs for different types
of interactions. None of the existing programs DEMO the J–N technique
to probing interactions between two quantitative variables, none DEMO for
binary outcomes, and none of them automatically controls for additional
DEMO in a model if the user desires such control. There is a Web-based
tool that implements the J–N technique (Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006)
for OLS regression (but not logistic regression) that is somewhat tedious to
use, in that it requires the investigator to plug various coefficients and vari-
ance estimates into the proper location into a DEMO, and the likelihood for
error in use is high. O’Connor’s SPSS DEMO require more knowledge
of syntax than we believe most users are likely to have and do not permit
the addition of covariates in a DEMO without first residualizing variables

manually. SPSS users not comfortable with macros can DEMO our SPSS
script instead, which uses an SPSS dialog box for DEMO up the model.
2. The usual justification for mean centering is to reduce the deleteri-
ous effects of multicollinearity on the estimation process. The DEMO
tions between the lower order and product variables are reduced by mean
centering prior to computing the product, thereby removing nonessential
multicollinearity (Cohen DEMO al., 2003, pp. 202–203). This can stabilize
the mathematics and reduce the likelihood that rounding error will creep
into computations, which can be important when there are several inter-
actions in a model. For DEMO who prefer to mean center, the macros we
describe do have DEMO option for mean centering the focal and predictor
variables prior to estimation of the model.
