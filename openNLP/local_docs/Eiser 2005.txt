Paper to be presented at SCARR conference on Trust, LSE, 12th December 2005
Abstract
Over 50 years DEMO cross-disciplinary research suggests we have higher trust in those who are seen as a)
knowledgeable, b) similar to ourselves and c) honest/transparent. Doctors are trusted with our medical
care because they are perceived DEMO: be competent, share our concerns, and tell us what they DEMO
Politicians tend to be distrusted for the opposite reasons. However, we DEMO much less about
'marginal trust', i.e. how trust is built DEMO lost as a result of new information. Many policy makers
already know that public trust in them is low. What they now want to DEMO is how to improve this
situation. Greater understanding of marginal trust is critical for such change. In its exploration of
marginal trust, the current paper draws on four fundamental psychological processes and related
empirical evidence. First, in line with a general negativity bias, people tend to trust bad news more
than good. Second, in line with the desire for cognitive consistency, people tend to trust news that is
congruent with their prior attitudes more than news that is incongruent. Third, in line with research
into information diagnosticity, news with greater breadth (policy-related) has a bigger effect on trust
than news with less breadth (event-related). Fourth, DEMO extending a classification of performance types
developed from psychophysical experiments (Signal DEMO Theory) to issues of trust, we identify a
type of error that actually increases trust. Taken together, our research provides a more optimistic view
on how to improve marginal rates of trust than is commonly DEMO
Key words: Trust, risk perception, negativity bias, confirmatory bias, DEMO diagnosticity, signal
detection theory.
1.0 Introduction
Imagine it’s a Sunday afternoon DEMO you feel like going for a walk. You look out of the window and
see patches of blue sky amongst the odd bit of DEMO and a moderate Westerly breeze. You ask
yourself “should I perhaps take an umbrella?”. Now, if the Sunday afternoon in question is in August,
we suspect you will conclude “no I don’t need one, it hardly rains in August when there’s some blue
sky” and you’ll DEMO for the walk without further ado. However, if the afternoon is DEMO April, we suspect
you may be a little more hesitant. You DEMO from experience that in April the showers can come in
from the West very quickly, and now you’re not so sure its going to stay dry. How do you cope with
Building and losing trust
this greater level of uncertainty? Well one approach is to turn on the radio and listen to the weather
forecast. DEMO for you the forecaster says there’s only a 5% chance of rain today so you set off
without the umbrella and end up enjoying DEMO lovely stroll through the countryside. Although mundane,
this little scenario encapsulates many of the same processes that are involved in more serious
examples DEMO risk perception and trust in decision makers.
• First, and most DEMO, we are dealing with a decision made under conditions of
uncertainty. DEMO risk is commonly defined as the probability of an unwanted event,
thinking in terms of uncertainty is more instructive. All probabilities between the DEMO
where p = 0 or 1 reflect some degree of uncertainty. Numerical expressions of probability are
attempts to quantify such uncertainty. Indeed, the level of uncertainty can reflect external
regularities, such as seasonal variations in rainfall. Nonetheless, the apparent precision of such
numerical expressions can disguise the fact that (in all natural or open systems) they are
estimates, the reliability of which depends on a number of factors. These include the DEMO of
randomness in the actual events considered, the quality of the DEMO available about these
events, and the processes and assumptions used to DEMO estimates from data. In other words,
such estimates are not merely expressions of uncertainty, but uncertain in themselves.
Moreover, when probability estimates DEMO separate events are combined (e.g. multiplied) – as in
fault tree analysis or other forms of probabilistic risk assessment applied to risks of DEMO
events or system failures – the unreliability of such estimates can propagate and be magnified
throughout a whole series of calculations. Uncertainty thus can DEMO attached both to events and
to estimates of such events. Beyond this, though, uncertainty is a state of mind. What matters
for the DEMO we make is not simply the numbers we are offered, but DEMO we feel about
them.
• Second, the risk arises not merely DEMO the natural ‘hazard’ of rainfall, but from the interaction
between that DEMO and the decisions we make. None of this is to minimize the potential
danger of more extreme climatic or geophysical events, such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis
and hurricanes. But what most influences the consequences of DEMO events – what mitigates or
exacerbates the worst effects – is human decision-making at all levels from the individual
through the institutional to the DEMO To a large extent, therefore, risk perception
involves an implicit or explicit evaluation of such decision-making.
• Third, the need to make any kind of decision at all only arises because our actions may lead DEMO
more or less preferred consequences. Our scenario rests on the implicit norms that a walk in
good weather is pleasant, getting soaked in the rain is unpleasant, staying indoors is boring
and carrying an umbrella is a bit of a nuisance. So the decision involves not just estimating
DEMO is likely to happen, but a trade-off of likely costs and DEMO
• Fourth, although we can make decisions by ourselves, we can also seek advice from other
people. In many instances we make comparative DEMO about our own capacity and that
Building and losing trust
of others to make good decisions. As uncertainty DEMO (i.e. a walk in April) our propensity
to turn to the judgements of others increases (Siegrist & Cvetkovich, 2000).
• Fifth, in such instances it is not just anyone’s opinion we seek, but that of someone who we
believe a) knows more about the situation than ourselves and b) is motivated to tell us what
they believe to be true (i.e. the weather forecaster). In this way, DEMO own belief about the
likelihood of rain in April (our risk DEMO) will depend on whether or not we feel the
weather forecaster DEMO willing and able to make an accurate assessment of the likelihood of rain.
That is, risk perception becomes based on a social judgement about the trustworthiness of the
risk communicator. If our baseline trust (i.e. our general level of trust) in weather forecasters
is high we probably won’t take the umbrella, but if our baseline level of trust is low we might
take one anyway.
• Sixth, the kind of trust we are talking about here is not the kind of trust we have DEMO friends and
family (i.e. interpersonal trust, e.g. Rempel Holmes & Zanna, 1985) or in other people in
general (i.e. social trust, DEMO & Putnam, 2004), but trust in specific individuals whose
role DEMO is to assess, manage and communicate information about risk. Such trust DEMO been
referred to as “role-based trust” since “it is not the person in the role that is trusted so much as
the system of DEMO that produces and maintains role-appropriate behaviour of role
occupants” (Kramer, 1999, p.578).
• Seventh, although turning to more knowledgeable others regarding DEMO risk of rain is an
example of a natural hazard, we DEMO the same processes apply to human made hazards
(e.g. nuclear power, vaccinations etc.) and even to other humans as potential hazards (e.g. DEMO
this leader planning military action?; is this online trader genuine or bogus?; Is this person a
suicide bomber?). Although our main focus in the current paper is on trust and human-made
hazards, we will return to the issue of human hazards later when discussing on-going DEMO
Our basic model can be seen in Figure 1. The arrow from the self to the hazard reflects 'risk
perception' - that is DEMO person's judgment of the risks from the hazard. The arrow from the
experts to the hazard reflects the, usually, more formal 'risk assessment' of the same hazard by
people who have greater knowledge than the self (e.g. weather forecasters, seismologists,
nuclear engineers, regulators, DEMO advisers, security forces and so on). The arrow from
the DEMO to the self reflects 'risk communication', that is the processes DEMO the experts
report (more or less transparently) their risk assessment. The last arrow, from the self to the
experts, reflects the kind DEMO 'role-based trust' we are primarily interested in. Clearly, the model
DEMO closely associated with Heider's (1958) Balance Theory and Hardin's (2001) perspective on
trust as a ‘three-part relation’ (see Section 3.2).
***Insert Figure 1 about here***
• Finally, returning to our example of a Sunday stroll, we also suspect that how you respond to
the forecast will in part depend upon whether or not the last DEMO you heard was correct or
Building and losing trust
not. For example, if the last forecast correctly predicted rain even though it looked unlikely,
then we believe you DEMO more likely to trust the forecaster now than if the last forecast said it
would be clear but it did in fact rain. That DEMO, our baseline level of trust can be influenced by
the accuracy DEMO specific previous judgements. Such changes reflect the marginal rate of trust
as a function of specific judgements. One of our central arguments is that DEMO marginal rate of
trust will depend not only on the accuracy of previous decisions but also on the type of correct
or incorrect decision DEMO was made.
To date, previous research into role-based trust, has focused predominantly on baseline trust.
Specifically, most researchers have tried to identify the correlates of such trust and this research has
provided us with a DEMO good picture of the kind of people who are generally (dis)DEMO and why
this is the case. We briefly review some of this literature in Section 2 below. Far less attention has
been paid to DEMO rates of trust. Specifically, there is relatively little research addressing questions
DEMO as: "how do single instances of 'good' or 'bad' performance affect trust?"; "How is it that some
mistakes undermine DEMO confidence in doctors more than others?"; "What kinds of performance should
policy makers endeavour to perform if they want the public to DEMO them more?". In section 3 we
discuss four psychological processes DEMO we believe will help to shed some light on these and related
questions.
Section 3.1 discusses what we could call the standard line on DEMO trust. That is, due to an inherent
negativity bias in human DEMO, bad news about someone else has a stronger impact on our DEMO
in them than good news. Since negative information is thought, from DEMO perspective, to be stronger
than positive, the view on marginal trust is rather negative, it is said to be easier to lose than gain.
Section 3.2 examines the role of an alternative, and perhaps equally strong psychological process,
namely the desire for cognitive consistency. From this DEMO, new information that is congruent
with prior attitudes will tend to DEMO accepted more than incongruent information. In the latter case,
other processes tend to kick in that help to discount the new information and DEMO it loses some of its
power in terms of marginal trust. Section 3.3 looks more closely at the specificity of the new
information. In DEMO with the basic principle that more information has greater diagnostic power
than less, we report on new research showing that information about implemented policies (good and
bad), which cover a broader range of behavioural instances, has a greater impact on trust than
information about specific behavioural instances or events (good or bad). Moreover, as we shall see,DEMO
this factor seems to interact with message valence.
Section 3.4 discusses a new approach to examining marginal trust by arguing that the assessments an
DEMO can make with regard to any given hazard under conditions of uncertainty will result in the
same taxonomy of outcomes made by participants in DEMO tasks where they need to say
Building and losing trust
whether a signal is present or not. Marginal DEMO in experts following these well known outcomes,
such as Hits, DEMO and False Alarms, is then examined to see whether there are DEMO in the
extent to which different types of good and bad news affects trust. Again, the results are somewhat
intriguing and when combined with the findings presented in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 paint a picture of
DEMO trust that is rather more positive than that painted if we rely on the negativity bias findings
presented in Section 3.1 alone. Some concluding DEMO are presented in Section 4.
2.0 Baseline trust
The two key questions with respect to baseline trust are "who is (dis)trusted?" DEMO "why?". Answers to
the first question have generally been gathered using public surveys and interviews which simply ask
people how much they DEMO various actors with respect to a given hazard or hazards. We look at the
basic outcome of such research in Section 2.1. To address DEMO second question these surveys also tend
to ask people what they think about the same actors on a range of other dimensions such as
DEMO, honesty, values and so forth. When significant positive correlations are found between
these dimensions and baseline trust (i.e. more of x is associated with higher trust) the relevant
dimensions are interpreted as antecedents or dimension of trust. Putting aside the possibility that the
causal direction may also DEMO in the opposite direction (for more on this issue see Eiser, Frewer &
Miles, 2002; Poortinga & Pidgeon, 2004), Section DEMO reviews some of the antecedents that have been
proposed and argues that there is a certain order to the apparent chaos.
2.1 Who is DEMO and who is distrusted with regard to risk-related information?
In terms of baseline, or general levels, of role-based trust in various actors DEMO in assessing,
managing or communicating risk, the picture is relatively DEMO and familiar. Our own data on trust in
different actors is largely consistent with research carried out in other safety contexts ranging from
food (Frewer, Howard, Hedderley, & Shepherd, 1996) to bathing water (DEMO, Marris, &
O’Riordan, 1999). Specifically, we carried out DEMO postal surveys of members of the public enquiring
about their risk perceptions associated with the potential risks from mobile phone technology (White
& Eiser, in press) and the development of 'Brownfield' sites. For present DEMO, the most relevant
questions concerned the level of baseline trust people DEMO in the various actors (from 0 'no trust' to 6
'complete trust'). The basic pattern can be seen in Figure 2.
***Insert Figure 2 about here***
In line with many other surveys, scientists and medics tend to record high levels of trust while
business interests DEMO government (especially national government) tend to be less trusted. Perhaps the
most surprising finding - although also consistent with prior research - is DEMO high level of trust in
family and friends. This is especially interesting given that in our mobile phone survey, people
reported knowing more, DEMO average, about the risks than their peers. Why should people be DEMO
to listen to peers who they think know less? We suspect DEMO answer to this apparent paradox lies in the
Building and losing trust
possibility that people are effectively answering two different DEMO For all the other actors they
are considering 'role-based trust' as planned since there are no interpersonal relations. However when
we ask them DEMO friends and relatives they are considering 'interpersonal trust'. Although we DEMO
about their trust in this category in terms of 'information about DEMO certain risk', we believe in classic
heuristic fashion (Kahneman & DEMO, 2002) they actually answer a slightly different question
which is something like "do you trust your friends in general?". If nothing DEMO this finding serves to
remind us that the questions we ask aren't always interpreted in the expected way.
2.2 Correlates of baseline trust
DEMO literature on the correlates of role-based trust is considerable and growing. These correlates
include: care, competence, concern, consensual (or shared) values, consistency, expertise, fairness,
faith, honesty, knowledge, objectivity, openness, past performance, predictability, reliability and
sympathy (e.g. Kasperson, Golding and DEMO, 1992; Maeda and Miyahara, 2003; Renn and Levine,
1991; Siegrist, Earle and Gutscher, 2003). Although the list of possible dimensions seems daunting, a
number of factor analytic studies (e.g. Jungermann, Pfister & Fischer, 1996; Frewer, et al., 1996;
Mishra, 1999; Poortinga & Pidgeon, 2003) and a conceptual review (Johnson, 1999) suggest that the
list can be reduced to two or three key dimensions. These three dimensions are well summed up by
Peters, Covello and McCallum’s (1997) distinction between a) knowledge and expertise, b) care and
concern, and c) openness and honesty. A very similar DEMO distinction composed of ability,
benevolence and integrity was proposed by Mayer, Davis and Schoorman (1995) in relation to trust
more generally.
In short, we tend to trust actors, at least in the context DEMO risk, who we believe know what they are
talking about, care about public safety, and are open and transparent about their operations. While
actors such as scientists and doctors tend to score quite highly on DEMO dimensions, politicians and
industry tend to score much lower, especially on the care and concern and honesty dimensions.
However, as we argued at the very beginning of this paper, we suspect that most policy makers
already have a pretty good idea of these things. This is not DEMO since the basic ideas were
already identified by Yale psychologists studying persuasion processes in the 1950s (e.g. Hovland,
Janis & Kelly, 1953)DEMO What is far less obvious, and has been far less researched, is the impact of new
pieces of information. Since it is generally DEMO through new information that trust levels will change
what is needed is greater understanding of the processes underlying such shifts in trust. We refer DEMO
changes in trust as a function of new information as changes in 'marginal trust' for short. The
remainder of the paper is concerned DEMO this issue of marginal trust and explores four psychological
processes that might shed some light on how trust is gained, maintained and lost.
Building and losing trust
3.0 Marginal trust: Specific events
In this section we explore the role of four fundamental psychological processes and the potential DEMO
they might play in marginal trust changes. As noted above, these DEMO to a) a general negativity bias,
b) the desire for cognitive consistency, c) breadth of information and diagnosticity, and d) DEMO
types from judgments under uncertainty.
3.1 Negativity bias "Bad is stronger DEMO good"
There is widespread reference in the trust and risk perception literatures to the notion that while trust is
generally hard to establish, it is relatively easy to lose and that once lost it will DEMO a long time (if
ever) to become re-established (Barber, 1983; Burt & Knez, 1996; Dasgupta, 1988/2000; Levi, 1998;DEMO
Rempel, Holmes & Zanna, 1985; Rothbart & Park, 1986). Slovic (1993) coined the term ‘Trust
asymmetry’ and described it thus: "trust is fragile. It is typically created rather slowly, but it DEMO be
destroyed in an instant by a single mishap or mistake" (p.677). Moreover, the observation that
favourable traits (e.g. honest) require more behavioural instances for confirmation than unfavourable
traits (e.g. dishonest) and DEMO versa for disconfirmation suggests that “favorable traits are hard to
acquire but easy to lose, while unfavourable traits are easy to acquire and hard to lose” (p.137;
Rothbart & Park, 1986). Such a DEMO on trust is also consistent with lay perspectives as
exemplified by the saying ‘Trust comes on foot but leaves on horseback’ (Calman, 2002) and by
organizations’ concern about losing their ‘reputation’ (e.g. Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996).
Slovic and colleagues (Slovic, Flynn, Johnson & Mertz, 1993, cited Slovic, 1993) were amongst the
first empirically DEMO test the trust asymmetry hypothesis and develop a theoretical account of it. They
presented participants with 45 positive or negative statements concerning the management DEMO a nuclear
power plant. Positive statements suggested that the plant was well run (e.g. ‘Good records are kept of
plant operations, fuel shipments DEMO); negative statements that the plant was not well run (e.g.
DEMO keeping in the plant regarding plant operations, fuel shipments etc. is DEMO to be poor’).
Using trust in the management of the plant as the dependent variable they found that negative
statements decreased trust more DEMO positive statements increased it. Although Slovic (1993) only
reported the proportion of respondents using the most extreme category responses in his original
paper, our re-analysis (White & Eiser, 2005, Study 1) suggests that DEMO asymmetry still exists when all
responses are taken into account and overall means are compared (negative items M = -4.73; positive
items M DEMO 3.07; F(1, 102) = 82.64, p < 0.001, DEMO = .45). This asymmetry can be seen in Figure 3
where the trust decreasing items tend to decrease trust more than the trust DEMO items increase it.
***Insert Figure 3 about here***
At the heart of Slovic’s account of these findings is the notion that people pay more DEMO to and
are more influenced by negative than positive information. This proposition, i.e. the primacy of
negative information or a 'negativity bias', DEMO received substantial support in the broader
psychological literature (for reviews see, Baumeister, et al., 2001; Rozin & Royzman, 2001). Evidence
Building and losing trust
comes from fields as diverse as attention (Pratto & John, 1991), learning (Seligman, 1970), social
judgements (DEMO & Capinski, 1990; Taylor, 1991) attributions (Kanouse & Hanson, 1972) and
decision-making under conditions of uncertainty (Kahneman, & Tversky, DEMO). This account of
marginal trust also received further support in the domain of technological risk in a study Siegrist and
Cvetkovich (2001, DEMO 1). These authors presented people with hypothetical information suggesting
that a food colourant was either safe or harmful for health. They found that DEMO average people were
more likely to trust the harmful than the safe messages. Moreover, as regards trust in public
institutions, it may be DEMO the media focus undue attention on negative events and stories such that the
public is exposed to more potentially trust decreasing information than trust DEMO information
(e.g. Koren & Klein, 1991; although see Freudenburg et DEMO, 1996).
In short, according to the negativity bias account, DEMO is easier to lose than gain because negative
information is more attention grabbing, more powerful and often more readily available than positive
information. Moreover, there is also evidence that people who are low in dispositional trust tend to
avoid others and thus limit the number of opportunities they DEMO for acquiring new positive
information about others (Yamagashi, 2001). In other words, in line with Slovic's rather pessimistic
trust asymmetry hypothesis, once trust is lost, it might be very hard to re-establish. DEMO picture
certainly seems resonant with those who express concern that social capital and well-being are being
undermined by a reduction of trust between people DEMO modern societies (e.g. Helliwell & Putnam,
2004; Layard, 2005; Uslaner, 2003).
While we do not dispute the idea of negativity dominance in general, we suspect that it is not the only
psychological process at work. If this were the case, and people really had a "one strike and you're
out" heuristic surely trust would DEMO extinct very quickly. Yet there is also evidence that after a
relatively steep downturn in trust in public institutions from the 1950s to the DEMO, things have
leveled out somewhat in recent years and even increased DEMO some institutions over time (Kasperson,
Kasperson & Golding, 1999). Moreover, there is also research suggesting that trust can be built rather
quickly, for example in highly motivated, taskoriented groups (Meyerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996)
and that rather than turning to distrust, trust may instead turn to scepticism, a more adaptive stance in
complex societies where cooperation is imperative but a lack of vigilance might result in DEMO
(O'Neill, 2002). Finally, looking back at Slovic's DEMO evidence for a negativity bias in Figure 3, it is
also DEMO that while the average impact for negative information is stronger than that for positive
information, there is considerable variance as a function of valence. That is, there are some positive
events which seem to increase trust considerably and even some negative ones that have relatively
little impact. In DEMO words, the negativity bias explanation is only one part of a DEMO complex story.
In the next three sections we investigate other psychological processes that seem to be involved and as
we shall see they all DEMO a more optimistic perspective than a pure negativity bias account.
Building and losing trust
3.2 Cognitive consistency
Like negativity dominance, cognitive consistency also appears to be a fundamental psychological
process demonstrated in psychological research DEMO over 50 years (e.g. Festinger, 1957; Heider, 1946;
1958). Put simply, the theory of cognitive consistency argues that people are motivated to maintain
consistency between their attitudes, beliefs, values and so DEMO New information that is highly similar to
current beliefs will be readily assimilated and accepted. Information that is deeply inconsistent with
prior beliefs will DEMO to be rejected and in some cases explanations will be sought to 'explain away'
the new information. To accept such information at face value would result in the need to re-organise
one's views of DEMO world and such accommodation takes considerable mental effort, something which
the DEMO bounded thinker is generally reluctant to do (Simon, 1957). These processes effectively
lead to a confirmatory bias. That is, we tend to believe new information that appears to confirm our
prior beliefs more readily DEMO information that appears to disconfirm them. For example, if a highly
DEMO source is quoted as saying something that conflicts with our prior attitudes about them, people
may simply, “deny that the source actually was DEMO for the communication or may re-interpret
the “real” meaning they believe the message to have” (Hovland, Janis & Kelley, 1953, p.43). DEMO other
words, negative information about a trusted source need not necessarily DEMO in the kinds of
"catastrophic" drops in trust that have been claimed (e.g. Burt & Kenz, 1986). Instead, the negative
information may be dismissed as unreliable, a misinterpretation or an exception to the rule.
Returning to the issue of role-based trust and technological risk, there is now considerable evidence
that such cognitive consistency processes are at work. DEMO example, research carried out by one of us
in the 1980'DEMO demonstrates these processes for nuclear power. As chance would have it, DEMO sent out a
survey about attitudes towards nuclear power shortly before the Chernobyl accident (Eiser, Spears &
Webley, 1989). Seeing the DEMO to examine how attitudes might have changed following the
incident we contacted our initial respondents a second time. As might be expected, we witnessed an
overall shift against nuclear power following the accident. This was reflected DEMO more opposition to an
existing nuclear plant (approx. 16 km away) and opposition to any new nuclear plant, either locally or
nationally. However, the size of the shift, though reliable, was modest, and DEMO attitudes after
the accident remained highly predictable from their attitudes before. On the same topic, Cvetkovich,
Siegrist, Murray & Traegasser (2004) DEMO that the power of Slovic's (1993) negative and positive
items (see 3.1 above) was moderated by prior levels of trust in DEMO managers in the nuclear industry.
Specifically, positive information about nuclear power DEMO managers led to greater trust among those
with high levels of prior trust while bad news was judged as more informative by low prior DEMO
Indeed, this tendency for initial trust or distrust to “color our DEMO of events, thus reinforcing
our prior beliefs” was already recognized by DEMO (1993).
Building and losing trust
Another aspect of this issue that we have DEMO investigated was whether the negativity bias
witnessed in Slovic's research is to some extent due to strongly negative attitudes towards nuclear
power. That DEMO, perhaps the greater effect of negative information in that study was DEMO to the fact that
as well as being negative it was also congruent with prior attitudes - i.e. that nuclear power is bad and
DEMO Building on an unpublished aspect of the Cvetkovich et al. study (DEMO), we constructed 12
events (6 positive and 6 negative) and suggested to participants that these events occurred either in the
nuclear power DEMO (as in the original study) or in the pharmaceutical industry. In line with
predictions this latter industry was viewed less negatively than nuclear DEMO and the results on trust
in the two industries of the negative and positive pieces of new information can be seen in Figure 4.
(N.B. for ease of comparison, the absolute effects on trust are shown, negative events naturally
decreased trust while positive ones increased it). While the negativity bias was re-confirmed for
positive vs negative information in the DEMO industry (left side of Figure 4), the reverse was found
DEMO the pharmaceutical industry (right side). In this instance, positive information tended to increase
trust more than negative information decreased it.
***Insert Figure DEMO about here***
A similar pattern of results was found when we unpacked Siegrist and Cvetkovich's (2001, see 3.1
above) demonstration of negativity bias for trust in messages about food additives (White, Pahl,
DEMO & Haye, 2003). For example, we found that the effect of negative information about food
colourants on trust was greater than positive DEMO only when participants had negative prior
attitudes (Study 1). Moreover, when presented with positive and negative information about a more
positively viewed DEMO additive (i.e. vitamins, Study 2), positive information tended to have a large
effect than negative. In other words, the negativity bias found in earlier work appears to have been, at
least in part, DEMO to the selection of hazards about which the majority of participants had prior negative
attitudes. Indeed, this tendency for our initial attitudes to “color our interpretation of events, thus
reinforcing our prior beliefs” was already recognized by Slovic (1993) and clearly extends to issues of
marginal trust. DEMO short, in many instances it seems that rates of marginal trust DEMO actually be more
sensitive to good rather than bad news and thus trust may not be as easily lost as a purely negativity
bias DEMO would suggest. Why? Because people are motivated to maintain their prior DEMO
structures and as such they are relatively reluctant to accept information, DEMO trust-related
information, that would upset the balance of these structures.
3.3 DEMO diagnosticity
A third psychological mechanism we believe is important for understanding marginal rates of trust is
the breadth of the new information being received. DEMO instance is the new information related to a
single behavioural instance (DEMO last week the police accidentally shot an innocent suspect) or is DEMO
indicative of performance over repeated instances (e.g. last week the police DEMO a more lenient
policy towards shooting suspected criminals)? According to many researchers, impression formation
Building and losing trust
(including trustworthiness judgements) is essentially a categorisation DEMO and people use new
information to help them diagnose which category a person falls into. So, for example, “someone who
once stole money DEMO belongs in the dishonest category, but there is a real, though lesser
probability, that they instead belong in the honest category” (Skowronski & Carlston, 1987, p.689).
Importantly, and not surprisingly, more information is better than less for these diagnostic purposes
(Rothbart & Park, DEMO).
In terms of marginal trust, we suspected that people would DEMO be prepared to make more
extreme trust-related categorization judgements (i.e. this DEMO is highly (un)trustworthy) when the
information is more rather than less diagnostic in terms of breadth. We tested this idea by once DEMO
returning to Slovic's (1993) original data. Using a within-subject design, Slovic and colleagues
presented participants with 45 hypothetical events that could have taken place in a nuclear power plant
and were asked whether or DEMO their trust in the management of these plants would increase or
decrease and by how much. Recall, that in general the trust decreasing items led to greater falls in trust
than the trust increasing events led DEMO increases in trust. However, on closer scrutiny it was apparent
that DEMO some of the 45 items were related to single behavioural instances e.g. " an accident occurs at
a plant in another state", many DEMO were related to more general policies spanning many specific
instances, e.g. DEMO is careful selection and training of employees at the plant". We thus re-coded
each piece of information as reflecting either a general policy DEMO a specific event and predicted that
marginal trust would be influenced more by policies than events related because they have greater
breadth and are DEMO diagnostic (White & Eiser, 2005). The results, collapsing across DEMO examples of
policies and events, can be seen on the left DEMO of Figure 5 (as with Figure 4, absolute impacts on
trust, rather than their direction, are presented).
***Insert Figure 5 about DEMO
Evidently, the results were not exactly as predicted. True, in overall terms, the impact of policy related
information (M = 3.99) was marginally more powerful than event related information (M = 3.80; F(DEMO,
102) = 3.89 , p = 0.051, pη2 = .04). However this overall difference was not large and was clearly
moderated DEMO valence F(1, 102) = 118.17 , p < 0.001, DEMO = .54. While, as predicted, positive policies
(M = 3.64) had greater impact on trust than positive events (M = 2.50), the reverse was the case for
negative pieces of information (events M = 5.10; policies M = 4.35). Since this may have been in part
due to the fact that the original study was not DEMO to investigate policy vs. event related
information, we carried out a DEMO study into the same topic which deliberately manipulated the
features of new pieces of information in these terms.
The results can be seen on DEMO right side of Figure 5. This time, the combined effect of DEMO related
information (M = 1.68) on marginal trust in nuclear power plant managers was clearly stronger in
overall terms than the event related DEMO (M = 1.19, F(1,35) = 12.19, p = 0.001, pη2 = .26).
Building and losing trust
However, once again, this main effect was DEMO by valence such that while positive policies
(1.69) had a stronger impact than positive events (.83), the difference was much smaller, DEMO not
actually reversed, for negative information (events M = 1.55; DEMO M = 1.68; F(1,35) = 13.26, p <
0.001, pη2 = .28). The moral of the story seems to be that while more information is generally better
than less, specific negative events do seem to have a stronger impact on trust than specific DEMO
events. Moreover, this finding also extended to an industry that was DEMO more positively (i.e. the
pharmaceuticals industry, see White & Eiser, DEMO for more details) and thus doesn't seem to be
explicable DEMO in terms of a confirmatory bias.
Why might this be the case? Slovic (1993) suggests that it is because “negative events often take the
form of specific, well-defined incidents such as accidents, lies, discoveries of errors or other
mismanagement. Positive events, while sometimes visible, more DEMO are fuzzy or indistinct. For
example, how many positive events are DEMO by the safe operation of a nuclear power plant for
one day?” (italics added). Although, he does not talk about policies, we could argue that both positive
and negative policies are relatively "fuzzy" and thus the lack of difference between the impact of
positive vs negative policies might be due to their similarity in this respect. The DEMO that overall they
have a greater impact reflects our suggestion that ultimately they are more diagnostic. The take home
message for policy makers? If you want to build trust, it might be better to outline the implementation
of positive policies that effectively constrain behaviour over a series of DEMO rather than trying to
provide people with information about particularly positive instances of performance. Again, this is a
more positive conclusion than that offered by a pure negativity bias account of marginal trust, because
it suggests that some types of positive information can have a similar or even DEMO effect of trust
than some types of negative information.
3.4 Assessment of performance under uncertainty: People as Intuitive Signal Detection Theorists
The fourth fundamental psychological process that we consider to be important for marginal trust
concerns DEMO results of decisions made under uncertainty. As early as the mid 19th century, pioneering
experimental psychophysicists such as Fechner and Weber interested in how changes in objective
states of the physical world were experienced psychologically. So, for example, these
'psychophysicists' were interested in how systematic changes in the intensity of light, pressure, noise
etc. were subjectively experienced and DEMO Of particular relevance here was their interest in a
phenomenon referred to as the 'just-noticeable-difference'. This concept refers to the amount of change
needed in an objective stimulus before it is subjectively detected by a DEMO So, in a typical
experiment a participant might be asked to DEMO in a pitch black room and say whether or not they think
a tiny light had been switched on. Crucial to the situation is DEMO At these very low levels of
intensity people are often unsure whether the small blinking they see is actually a light in the external
DEMO or the kind of light experienced due to the random firing of nerve cells in the brain (i.e. neural
Building and losing trust
'noise'). When asked if they believe DEMO light had been presented within a certain epoch of time, they DEMO
answer either "yes" or "no". Moreover, the experimenter will know whether or not their subjective
assessment was correct or incorrect. Thus DEMO a simple study of this type there are actually four different
outcomes (see Table 1).
***Insert Table 1 about here***
First, a DEMO can be correct in two different ways. If there is a light and they correctly identify its
presence it is referred to as a DEMO Positive or Hit. If they correctly deduce that no light had been
shown it is referred to as a True Negative or All Clear. DEMO, they can be wrong in two different
ways. If a light DEMO actually present but they failed to detect it this is referred to as a False Negative or
Miss. Finally, if a light was not present but they claim it was this is called a False Positive DEMO False
Alarm. Subsequent research across a broad range of phenomenon showed that people vary
systematically in both their ability to correctly discriminate signals from DEMO (i.e. discrimination
ability) and in their bias towards responding by saying that a signal was either present or not (i.e.
response bias). These response patterns have been incorporated into a theory known as Signal
DEMO Theory (SDT, Green & Swets, 1974/1988) and have been examined a wide range of applied
settings such as radiology, air traffic control, eye witness testimony, clinical assessments and industrial
safety (for reviews see Swets, 2000; Swets, Dawes, & Monahan, 2000).
So what has all this got to do with marginal trust? Well, DEMO believe that for many risk-related contexts
members of the public look at decision-makers and assess their performance in terms of Signal
Detection Theory. That DEMO they are able to distinguish between the four different decision outcomes
(DEMO they might not use the explicit labels) and use this information DEMO update their levels of trust in
the decision-maker (DM) accordingly. A DM who makes a correct judgement will be rewarded with
increasing trust. DEMO DM who makes an error will be penalised with falling trust. For instance, a police
officer who shoots a suicide bomber before he can detonate the bomb will be a trusted hero. The
officer who shoots DEMO innocent suspect will be seen as a trigger-happy menace to society. In other
words, DMs who show the ability to correctly discriminate safe from dangerous situations are likely to
be rewarded with higher trust.
However, in addition to being sensitive to a DM’s discrimination ability, we believe lay observers are
also sensitive to whether or not they betray a certain DEMO of response bias. We suspect, for example,
that a doctor DEMO fails to detect the presence of cancer in their patient (a DEMO) will be trusted less next
time round than one who mistakenly DEMO a benign growth for a cancerous one (a False Alarm).
DEMO a higher tolerance of False Alarms over Misses will be present for many risk related contexts,
we suspect that it will not exist DEMO all. Legal systems that adopt an 'innocent until proven guilty' stance
are effectively saying that they are prepared to tolerate Misses (i.e. the release of criminals) to avoid
False Alarms (i.e. the sentencing of DEMO). It is an empirical question, however, whether or not
Building and losing trust
the public would trust a magistrate more following DEMO of a Miss or a False Alarm. It probably
depends on the seriousness of the crime. Our main point, however, is that rates DEMO marginal trust are
likely to be affected by the outcome of previous decisions in systematic ways and exploration of these
patterns will help decision-makers DEMO how best to build and avoid losing trust.
As originally formulated, DEMO assumed that discrimination ability was a function of skill or training,
whereas response bias reflected considerations of costs and benefits. In a medical DEMO, both over-
treatment (False Alarm) and under-treatment (Miss) can DEMO potentially serious consequences, but
obviously this will vary as a function DEMO many factors, such as the urgency of the patient’s condition
and DEMO aggressiveness of the treatment. Health economics also attempts to calculate the net benefit (in
units known as ‘Quality Adjusted Life Years’) of a DEMO treatment (Hit), to set against the
monetary cost of providing DEMO treatment. All these factors can enter into a doctor’s treatment
recommendation, DEMO and above the actual diagnosis. Likewise, in our more trivial example DEMO a walk
in the rain, the decision to go for a DEMO will depend not just on the forecast, but on how bothered DEMO
would be about getting wet. Since such costs and benefits provide the motivation for a riskier or more
cautious response bias on the part DEMO a DM, they also provide a basis for attributions of bias DEMO
observers of that DM’s choices. A company that stands to make a profit out of some industrial activity
or product is likely to be DEMO as biased towards supporting it, even if there are associated risks DEMO
costs to other people. And of course, if we are prescribed DEMO by a doctor, we feel entitled to
expect that this prescription DEMO be determined by our clinical need, rather than any incentive given DEMO
our doctor by a pharmaceutical company.
Moreover, in addition to the DEMO dimensions of discrimination ability and response bias proposed by
SDT, we DEMO that a third dimension of performance is also likely to be important when considering
trust in risk managers. In many instances risk managers are DEMO risk communicators. It is often not
sufficient for them to simply make correct decisions or adopt an appropriate response bias, they also
need to communicate the outcome of these decisions to the public. Concerns about openness DEMO
transparency in decision-making are already well-known to policy makers which is why they often call
for public enquiries and the like because it is DEMO widely known that it is not only the outcomes that
matter to people but the procedures used to attain these outcomes as well (e.g. Tyler & DeGoey,
1996). So a DM who fails to DEMO open and transparent about their decision-making processes is likely to
be punished with falling trust while one that is open will be rewarded with DEMO relative levels of
trust next time around. For example, we expect DEMO the decision-maker who makes a Miss and tries to
cover it up will be subsequently trusted much less than the one who makes a DEMO but openly
acknowledged their error. We refer to this third dimension of performance as communication bias, to
reflect the fact that like response bias it represents a particular tendency towards one kind of response
(to be open or not) under conditions of uncertainty.
Building and losing trust
In sum, we believe that in terms of marginal trust in decision makers, observers effectively operate as
Intuitive Signal Detection Theorists, or Intuitive Detection Theorists (IDTs) for short. These IDTs, DEMO
argue, adjust their levels of trust on the basis of information DEMO the levels of discrimination ability,
response bias and communication bias witnessed in previous decisions. Interestingly, although derived
from a theoretical approach to understanding decisions under uncertainty, it is enlightening to compare
these three decisions to the correlates observed for baseline trust (see Section 2.2). Recall for example
that Peters, Covello and McCallum’s (1997) also made a tri-partite distinction between a) knowledge
and expertise, b) care and concern, DEMO c) openness and honesty. The first dimension appears to be
very DEMO to discrimination ability. The second appears related to response bias and the third has
obvious links to communication bias. In this way there seems DEMO be a degree of convergent validity
between our own approach to marginal rates of trust and beliefs about trust in general. What our
approach DEMO in addition is predictions about how specific decisions that vary systematically will
lead to increases and decreases in marginal rates of trust. Specifically, our model makes the following
three predictions:
H1) Correct decisions (Hits & All Clears) will be associated with more positive changes in
trust DEMO incorrect decisions (False Alarms & Misses).
H2) Decisions showing cautious danger response bias (Hits and False Alarms) will be
associated with DEMO positive changes in trust than decisions showing a risky response bias
(DEMO Clears & Misses).
H3) Risk managers who are ‘open’ about DEMO decisions will be associated with more positive
changes in trust than risk managers who are ‘closed’.
We have now tested these predictions in a DEMO of experiments across risk contexts as diverse as
nuclear power, travel DEMO, computer viruses and the licensing of new prescription drugs and
by DEMO both within and between participant designs. Although the research program is very much in
its preliminary stages, the results across these different contexts and methods are remarkably
consistent (White & Eiser under review) In order DEMO provide a flavour of the results we return again to
the issue of nuclear power since in many ways it was this issue that DEMO much of the discussion
into marginal trust (Slovic, 1993). In this study, we again replicated Slovic's procedure of showing
participants a number of positive and negative events in a nuclear power station and DEMO them to
record how knowledge of these events would change their levels of trust in the plant's management.
We were careful to make DEMO that all items were events - rather than policies (see section DEMO above)
to keep the level of information specificity and diagnosticity as similar as possible.
Importantly, in terms of our model, participants were DEMO to evaluate both open and closed examples
of Hits, Misses, False Alarms and All Clears. Thus in total there were eight events to DEMO An
example of an Open False Alarm was, "Management shut down operations and warned local residents
of an incident at the plant even though it turned out to DEMO only a faulty warning system." An example
of a Closed False DEMO was "Employees were quickly evacuated and operations stopped following a
suspected DEMO but since it was only a false alarm, managers did not DEMO locals". The subsequent
changes in marginal trust as a result of the eight type of event can be seen in Figure 6.
***Insert DEMO 6 about here***
On the left side of Figure 6 are the responses to the four types of outcome when the managers had
been DEMO and honest. On the right are the outcomes when they had been less than fully open about
events at the plant. In line with DEMO 3, marginal trust rates were lower in the latter (M = -.80)
than the former case  (M = .22, F(1,63) = 73.42,  p < 0.001, ηp2 = .54). DEMO other words, trust suffered
more when a lack of transparency was DEMO In line with Hypothesis 2, Hits and False Alarms
(when combined together, M = .37) resulted in higher marginal trust than All DEMO and Misses (M = -

1. Correct judgments (Hits and All Clears, M = -.19) did not result in significant improvements in

= .04)DEMO
p
Building and losing trust
2 = .63). However, there DEMO no overall support for  Hypothesis
The primary reason for this unexpected DEMO is clear. Open False Alarms actually increased
marginal trust - in fact more than an Open Hit. Moreover, Closed False Alarms did not lead to a drop
in trust, in contrast to all three other Closed outcomes. In other words, there was a type of error that
did not decrease marginal trust. Another interesting aspect of Figure 6 is that DEMO only instance where
marginal trust really suffered heavily was for the Closed Miss. Trust fell much less in the case of an
Open Miss, even though it was quite serious, i.e. "Management releases press statement DEMO that it
was wrong to ignore signs of storage tank corrosion which led to a toxic release into the environment".
In other words, while all such effects will depend to a great extent on the DEMO of costs and
benefits involved, people seemed relatively tolerant of even DEMO serious errors as long as the decision
maker was prepared to admit their mistake. It is only when such mistakes are covered up that DEMO
really suffers in the way described by Slovic and others.
Moreover, DEMO noted above, this basic pattern was not restricted to the nuclear DEMO context or the
particular methodology used but instead generalised across a range of situations. There was even
evidence that these changes in trust were DEMO restricted to the specific decision-makers who actually
made the errors or correct decisions. Rather, marginal trust rates also generalised to the category of
decision-maker. For example, in a subsequent study (White & Eiser, Study 2, under review) we
assessed prior levels of baseline trust in various DEMO managers in general (e.g. nuclear power plant
managers, doctors and computer support personnel). Then, right at the end of the study, DEMO the
presentation of event types and measurement of marginal trust changes in those who had made
specific correct or incorrect judgements, we again asked for baseline trust judgements of the relevant
Building and losing trust
categories. What we noticed was that when a DEMO doctor, say, wrongly judged a situation to be
safe, not DEMO did trust in this doctor drop considerably, baseline trust for doctors DEMO general fell
(controlling for prior levels). Although the fall was DEMO smaller for general baseline trust, the
fact that one decision-maker's DEMO could influence trust in the general category was intriguing.
Certainly, it DEMO consistent with viewing trust in the present context as role-based rather than
interpersonal (Kramer, 1999). That is, a mistake by a specific category exemplar serves to undermine
trust in the system which legitimized their DEMO and thus is more likely to generalize to others in
this system.
At this stage these findings are preliminary and require replication and further DEMO A number
of issues remain. First, all of our contexts focused DEMO technological risks. Further research needs to
extend the approach to other types of risk setting, especially ones where an alternative response biases
might be more appropriate. For example we are currently exploring the idea that humans DEMO be
hazards too as in the case of suicide bombers. In this research we aim to examine people's trust in
police officers who DEMO a decision to shoot or not shoot a suspect. We expect that False Alarms may
not result in the same kinds of positive effects DEMO marginal trust witnessed for technological hazards.
Second, we have so far DEMO examined single instances of performance or pieces of information. What
happens when people are exposed to a two, three or four pieces of information about the same actors?
The story of the 'boy who cried wolf' tells us that while one False Alarm may be tolerated, DEMO in a
row will not. Further research needs to examine the dynamic aspect of decisions over time and their
influence on marginal trust in DEMO to establish a more realistic picture of what happens in applied
contexts.
3.5 Summary
Section 3 has introduced four well-known psychological mechanisms that might DEMO important for
understanding marginal rates of trust. We saw that people tend to give more weight to negative than
positive information and thus in DEMO contexts this results in trust being easier to lose than gain. We
all know from our own experience that when someone we know does DEMO really daft, it might
take us a long time, if ever, to trust them again. However, subsequent sections suggested that this
negativity DEMO is not the only process at work for trust. In order to maintain cognitive consistency,
people also tend to attenuate negative messages about DEMO they already have high levels of trust in.
Decision-makers are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt if they have already DEMO a strong
foundation of trust than ones who haven't. Moreover, DEMO varies in its specificity and hence
diagnosticity. Some messages are more powerful than others for marginal trust because they relate to
either single or DEMO behaviours. Policy makers interested in building trust would, it appears, do
well to emphasise positive policies than one off good deeds. Finally, insights from Signal Detection
Theory enabled us to suggest that people are sensitive DEMO the exact outcomes of decisions when
Building and losing trust
adjusting their levels of trust. In the context DEMO many technological hazards, it seemed that Misses,
especially ones where DEMO actor was less than fully transparent, seemed to be exactly the DEMO of 'really
daft' behaviours that led to catastrophic falls in trust. Single Open False Alarms, although incorrect
assessments of danger, led to DEMO increases in trust suggesting that not all negative information
leads to a fall in trust. Moreover, these patterns appeared to extend to other related decision-makers
not directly involved in the specific instances under consideration. Clearly, more work is needed to
investigate how many of such errors will be DEMO and whether there are contexts where Misses
will actually be preferred to False Alarms.
4.0 Concluding comments
Many of the risks we face in DEMO life are the product of human decisions of one kind or another.
Risk perception is therefore often as much a social judgment as an DEMO based on various
characteristics of the hazard itself. Since social judgments are fundamentally social psychological in
nature we believe the discipline has much to DEMO further understanding of risk perception processes.
Although the term trust is widely used when discussing these social judgments it is important to
distinguish this DEMO of 'role-based trust' which relates to the target's abilities to fulfill designated risk
management roles, from the kind of interpersonal trust we have in our friends and family. Prior
research into the public's DEMO based trust in risk managers suggests that it is influenced by perceptions
of their ability to distinguish 'dangerous' from 'safe' situations, their propensity to act in the public
interest when uncertain, and their openness and transparency in communications about the decisions
they have made. Based on DEMO three facets it is easy to see why general or baseline trust in doctors is
usually quite high while that in industry representatives is DEMO Both are generally seen as
knowledgeable about the risks, but only DEMO former tend to be thought of as acting in the public interest
and communicating risk information in a transparent fashion.
However, knowledge about baseline trust rankings is now widespread and, not surprisingly, those at
the DEMO want to know how to improve their ranking while those at the top want to know how to
stay there. That is, risk managers and other key decision makers want to know how to gain trust DEMO
avoid losing it. To investigate these more dynamic issues we reviewed the potential role of four well
known psychological mechanisms namely, i) a DEMO negativity bias, ii) the desire to maintain
cognitive consistency, iii) the greater diagnosticity of information with broader specificity and iv)
psychophysical DEMO relating to the detection of signals under conditions of uncertainty. In turn
each of these four processes seemed to add valuable insights into rates DEMO marginal trust, i.e. the
amount of trust that could be gained DEMO lost as a function of a single event or outcome. Generally
speaking, bad news had a larger (negative) impact on trust than good news but this was moderated by
prior attitudes towards the hazard and DEMO risk manager, by the amount of information conveyed and
Building and losing trust
the exact nature of the error or correct DEMO Moreover, we would be surprised if there weren't
further psychological DEMO that could shed additional light on these issues.
That trust isn’t as asymmetric, i.e. hard to again but easy to lose, as previously DEMO is good news
for many but perhaps not so surprising after all. Research into the related field of the evolution of
cooperation has demonstrated, for example, that ultimately a 'tit-for-tat' strategy (i.e. start off
DEMO and then mirror the behaviour of the other) generally rewards 'organisms' with higher
pay offs than a vengeful strategy where a single defection leads to repeated non-cooperation (Axelrod,
1980). If we have evolved to use strategies of this sort, which seems plausible given the social
circumstances of our evolutionary history, then trust can be rebuilt, maybe DEMO as quickly as a simple
tit-for-tat mechanism would imply, but certainly DEMO the long run following repeatedly 'cooperative'
behaviours. Clearly, the definition of the term cooperative depends on whose perspective we are
taking but DEMO we are concerned with public perceptions in general, cooperation often seems DEMO be a
function of performing one's allotted tasks to the best of one's ability, acting in the public interest and
being open and honest. Risk managers and other key decision makers would do well DEMO remember that
cooperation and trust are, at the end of the DEMO, two-way process however much the complexity of
modern societies has separated DEMO physically from those whose trust they desire.
