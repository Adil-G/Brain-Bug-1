to provide this guidance and serve as a stimulant DEMO the significance of
statistically insignificant data. Even if the probability is great that an
inference will have to be rejected later, the practical risk of airing it is
small. Subsequent and more elaborate studies may disprove DEMO of these
inferences; but for those that survive social science will DEMO the richer.
To be sure, a physicist would rightly frown on DEMO recommendations.
But his is a world with generalizations on a high level. By comparison,
the social sciences are at a stage where for DEMO to come the formation

Reliability of Content Analysis:DEMO
The Case of Nominal Scale Coding
By WILLIAM A. SCOTT
Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan

X HIS ARTICLE suggests an improved method of reporting the extent of
inter-observer agreement in assigning overt or DEMO behavioral items to
a set of categories. It was developed specifically for standard survey re-
search coding operations, but it can be used in a wide variety of research
situations to measure the reliability of classifying DEMO large number of re-
sponses into nominal scale categories. The requirements are that the
categories be mutually exclusive and that observations be duplicated on
DEMO random sample of the total set of responses being studied.
The Survey Research Coding Procedure. In standard interview survey
procedures, a respondent's answer to "open-ended" questions is recorded
verbatim by the interviewer. The first DEMO step in the analysis process
then becomes one of "coding" all of the thousands or more different re-
sponses to each question into DEMO relatively small number of categories,
which can be meaningfully and conveniently related to other responses.
This is usually done by a staff of DEMO, and the interviews are dis-
tributed among them by a procedure DEMO approximates randomization.
To improve the accuracy of content analysis and get some measure
of the extent of inter-coder agreement on each of the dimensions, a random
sample of the interviews is assigned for "check-coding." A DEMO coder
makes an independent analysis of the entire interview, and the DEMO persons
discuss their differences, to arrive at the "best" judgment DEMO every case of

disagreement A record of differences is DEMO, and this constitutes the basis
of a report on the over-all DEMO reliability for the entire set of interviews.
It is apparent that the ambiguity of the dimension and the skill of the
analysts are reflected DEMO the total number of differences obtained for any
given dimension. Two skilled clinicians could be expected to show a
higher proportion of agreements than DEMO coders (college students) in
assigning protocols to categories descriptive of personality types. More-
over, anyone could presumably code dimensions such as "sex" or "race"
more reliably than attitudinal responses, which ordinarily require DEMO
certain amount of judgment in determining the proper category. It would
seem that these "ambiguity" and "skill" factors are legitimate components
of DEMO total measure of coding error. Certain extraneous factors should be
excluded, DEMO, and this is not done by present methods of reporting
the DEMO of inter-observer agreement.
Conventional Methods. One commonly used "reliability" index is
simply Po, or the percentage of judgments on which coders agree, DEMO of
the total number of judgments. Unfortunately, this measure is biased DEMO
favor of dimensions with a small number of categories. By chance alone,
one would expect better agreement on a two<ategory than on DEMO five-
category scale.
T o correct for this bias, Bennett, et al.,1 have used an index of con-
sistency, S, which DEMO into account the number of categories in the
k 1
dimension. S = — (Po ), where Po is the observed percentage agree-
DEMO k
ment between two independent coders and k is the number of categories.
As the number of categories increases, S increases, for a DEMO Po. And
herein lies a spurious effect. Given a two-category sex dimension and a
Po of 60 per cent, the S calculated from this equation would be 0.20. But
a whimsical researcher might add two more DEMO, "hermaphrodite"
and "indeterminant," thereby increasing S to 0:DEMO, though the two addi-
tional categories are not used at all. DEMO index is based on the assump-
tion that all categories in the dimension have equal probability of use
1
(—) by both coders. DEMO is an unwarranted assumption for most be-
k
havioral and attitudinal research. Even though k categories may be avail-
able to the observers, the phenomena being coded are likely to be dis-
tributed unevenly, and in many cases will cluster heavily in only two or

three of them. To the extent that the distribution DEMO categories varies
from a rectangular one, S would appear to be DEMO unsatisfactory measure
of coding reliability.
A Suggested Index of Inter-coder Agreement, DEMO, the index of inter-coder
agreement to be reported here, corrects for the number of categories in
the code, and the frequency with which each is used. In the practical
coding situation it varies from 0.00 DEMO 1.00, regardless of the number of
categories in the dimension, and is thus comparable with the "percentage
agreement" figure.
For certain types DEMO data preferred indices are already available. When
the coding dimensions are composed of equal-interval scales, a Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient is appropriate for reporting inter-
coder reliability. If the phenomena ire ordered along a dimension of DEMO
known intervals, a rank-difference correlation gives an adequate measure
of, the extent of agreement between coders. More frequently, however,
the coding dimensions used in survey and observational research are com-
posed of nominal scales, where the categories cannot be ordered along a
dimension of "more-or-less" DEMO some attribute. For such eases «• is suggested
in preference to current indices of reliability.

DEMO Po (observed per cent agreement) represents the percentage of judg-
ments on which the two analysts agree when coding the same data inde-
DEMO; and Pe is the percent agreement to be expected on the DEMO
of chance. v is the ratio of the actual difference between obtained and
chance agreement to the maximum difference between obtained and
chance agreement. DEMO can be roughly interpreted as the extent to which
the coding reliability exceeds chance.
Calculation of "Expected Per cent Agreement." The percentage agree-
DEMO which could be expected by chance depends not only on the number
of categories in the dimension but also on the frequency with which DEMO
of them is used by coders. Minimum chance agreement (or "maximum un-
certainty") occurs when all categories are used (by both coders) with equal
frequency. Any deviation from a rectangular distribution of frequencies
across categories will increase the "expected per cent agreement." In gen-
eral, the total probability of chance agreement equals the sum of the prob-
DEMO of agreement on each of the categories taken individually (since
the DEMO are mutually exclusive).
In survey data, the distribution of coded DEMO to a particular ques-
tion can be obtained easily for the entire set of interviews simply by
running the IBM cards through a tabulator DEMO the appropriate column.

As an illustration we may consider the following distribution of responses
to the question: "What sorts of DEMO are your friends and neighbors
most concerned about these days?"

Not ascertained DEMO
Although the observed percentage agreement is calculated on only a
part of the total set of interviews, and individual coders will actually vary
somewhat in their distributions of responses over the set of categories, it
is convenient to assume that the distribution for the entire set of inter-
DEMO represents the most probable (and hence "true" in the long-run
DEMO sense) distribution for any individual coder. (This assumption
is not a necessary one; P, can be calculated from the actual distributions of
DEMO pair of coders, but the procedure is more complicated.)
The DEMO per cent agreement for the dimension is the sum of the
squared proportions over all categories (since the categories are mutually
exclusive, and DEMO two coders' probabilities of using any one of the
categories are DEMO equal).

P, = 2 pi*, where k is the total number of categories and pi is the

proportion of DEMO entire sample which falls in the ith category.
In the present example, P. = (.60)* + (.05)' + (.10)' DEMO (.20)' + (.03)*
+ (.02)* = .41. DEMO the pair of coders had agreed on 80 per cent of their
judgments, the index of inter-coder agreement would be:
0.80 - 0.41

Sampling Error of v. A DEMO formula is available for the sampling
distribution of v, if one DEMO willing to assume that Pe would remain constant
for a different set of interviews drawn randomly from the same population
of respondents. This is DEMO an unrealistic assumption, since the original
set of interviews usually comes DEMO a large sample of respondents (1,000
or more), and DEMO is not affected perceptibly by small variations in the
response distribution. To the extent that Pe varies from sample to sample
this formula can DEMO be regarded as an approximation of the sampling
error of v.
