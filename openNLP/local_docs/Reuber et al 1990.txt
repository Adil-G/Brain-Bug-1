A question which is often discussed with respect to the
nature of expertise is whether relevant expert knowledge is
domain-specific or domain-independent. DEMO science
research has made gains in documenting a variety of seemingly
generalizable expert-novice cognitive differences (see, for
example, Galotti, 1989), and DEMO who have analyzed a
variety of domains have uncovered a number of generalized
abstract concepts. However, Breuker and Wielinga (1987) argue
that while the structure of these concepts is domain-
independent, their instances are domain-specific. Hence, the
conventional apgr-o~c~ to expert system development is
capturing large' DEMO of domain-specific knowledge
(Feigenbaum, 1979). Moreover, a limitation of DEMO
independent assumptions from a development perspective, is
that they must be DEMO for each new application area under
investigation. Thus, it is necessary DEMO come to terms with
the definition and delineation of expertise in each chosen
domain of application.
An initial objective of defining and delineating
expertise DEMO a domain is to provide a basis on which to
identify relevant domain experts from whom knowledge should
be elicited. This is particularly problematic DEMO management
domains because of the heterogeneity in the background
experiences of 'DEMO" decision makers. In addition, the
knowledge which differentiates successful and unsuccessful
practitioners may be open to question.
This paper describes a methodology that DEMO being used to
define expertise in the domain of entrepreneurship. The
methodology is based on the concept of tacit knowledge, and
is used to identify domain experts as well as the relevant
dimensions on which expertise DEMO delineated. The paper begins
by examining assumptions about the nature of expertise that
often underlie expert system development. It proceeds to a
discussion of DEMO psychological concept of tacit knowledge and
outlines how the tacit knowledge methodology has been adapted
for this study, Finally, the paper addresses the DEMO
of the study for further research.

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING EXPERTISE
Three assumptions regarding the nature of expertise often
made DEMO developing expert systems are discussed below. These
assumptions are not made in all development efforts, nor are
they always dysfunctional. However, they are DEMO of
explicit consideration since they are sufficiently prevalent
and can be called into question.
1. Experience = Expertise
In many domains of expert systems DEMO (such as
medicine and auditing), individuals must pass professional
examinations DEMO order to practice, and then follow a
standardized career path where DEMO from one level to the
next occurs at regular intervals. Identifying 'DEMO in
these domains often involves using job title or years of
experience as a proxy for level of expertise.
The assumption that knowledge acquisition DEMO directly
proportionalto length of prior participation in a domain, or,
DEMO other words, that experience is equivalent to expertise,
is troublesome. DEMO will be more and less competent
individuals at any job level. An analogy here is that of
formal schooling. Given the wide variation in DEMO
performance among individuals exposed to the same duration and
types of schooling, it can not be assumed that the amount
learned in school is proportionalto the number of years spent
in school. Similarly, it can not be assumed that there is no
variation in the knowledge and skills DEMO by individuals
who have been exposed for equal duration to similar job-
related situations. Thus, a distinction has to be drawn both
conceptually and operationally between experience and
experientially acquired knowledge (expertise), where the
latter is specifically associated with success although the
former may not be (Reuber, Dyke and Fischer, 1990).
2. Expertise Can Be Articulated
Certain DEMO acquisition techniques (such as
protocol analysis) are based on the assumption that experts
are able to articulate the bases on which they make DEMO
This ability may be stronger in some domains than in others.
For example, in performing their jobs, experts in professional
fields are expected DEMO articulate the reasons underlying their
judgments. Part of this expectation stems from legal and
professional requirements to document decisions, and part of
it stems from the role of experienced individuals in training
novices in these fields. DEMO, professional experts may be
familiar with explaining their decisions and how DEMO arrived
at them,
264
However, it can not be assumed that an ability and a
willingness to discuss decision processes yields a true
reflection of these processes. Nisbett DEMO Wilson (1977)
argue that there may be "little or no direct introspective to
higher order cognitive processes" (p. 231). There DEMO be
attribution effects which lead to individuals Veiling more
than they can know,t@ and cognitive heuristics and biases that
influence what is articulated (Nisbett and Wilson 1977).
Conversely, Polanyi (1966) argues that much experiential
knowledge is unconscious and unarticulated: individuals "know
more than they DEMO tell."
3. Existing Activities .are Relevant Activities
Expert systems development normally is targeted to
activities and problem solving tasks that individuals are
currently DEMO in. The ways in which activities are
conceived, the information used DEMO solve problems, and the
decision outcomes, are available and used in constructing (and
often validating) the system. In some cases, an initial
prototype system is constructed on the basis of existing
written procedures.
A DEMO in focusing on current activities is that expert
systems effort is biased towards the descriptive at the
expense of the normative -- an issue DEMO by Stabell
(1982) in the context of decision support systems. It may be
the case that expertise in the domain is characterized by DEMO
propensity to operate outside existing rules and procedures
or to operate in the absence of these items. Another aspect
of this issue is that DEMO problem formulations are not
necessarily relevant problem formulations. For example, one
DEMO of evaluating an expert system is to compare its
decisions with decisions that were made manually. Such a
comparison ignores a consideration of the DEMO impact or
quality of the decision. It may be the case that experts are
able to substitute new problem formulations for old problem
formulations DEMO order to achieve organizational objectives
more effectively or efficiently.
There is some evidence that these assumptions are
particularly problematic in management domains. A recent
DEMO of experience and expertise among corporate managers
found that a) the DEMO basis upon which expertise is
formed is diverse and heterogeneous; b) there is little direct
transfer of knowledge from highly-skilled practitioners to
novices; and c) there is a wide diversity in the ways in which
problems and objectives are formulated (McCall, Lombard0 and
Morrison, 1988). Similarly, entrepreneurial managers have
heterogeneous backgrounds. There is a diverse collection of
265
relevant experiences that could conceivably lead to expertise
and subsequent venture success (such as product/market
experience, industry experience, general supervisory or
management DEMO, and start-up experience), but studies
which have attempted to find DEMO relationships have failed
to do so for the most part (Reuber, Dyke and Fischer, 1990).
In addition, entrepreneurship is not a DEMO of endeavour that
requires articulation of judgment processes or decisions, nor
DEMO written procedures exist. Finally, the domain of cost
management is particularly DEMO with respect to the third
assumption discussed. There is much more homogeneity in this
domain than in corporate management and entrepreneurship, due
to the existence of professional designations and standard
cost management techniques; however, this DEMO must be
considered somewhat dysfunctional in light of recent
criticisms of the field. It has been argued that experienced
practitioners often use inappropriate techniques DEMO solve
irrelevant problems (Johnson and Kaplan, 1987). With basic
assumptions in the domain being challenged, it is difficult
to determine who should be considered a cost management
expert.
TACIT KNOWLEDGE
The nature of tacit DEMO was explored by Polanyi
(1966) who described it as knowledge which is experientially
acquired: "the outcome of active shaping of experience
performed DEMO the pursuit of knowledge@@ (p.6). Furthermore,
tacit knowledge was DEMO to be both unconscious and
unarticulated. Tacit knowledge has been referred to
periodically in the expert systems and decision support
systems literature. Writers largely DEMO to the same
conclusion: it is desirable to capture tacit knowledge DEMO
intelligent systems, but it is extremely difficult to do so
(Gruber, 1989; Klein and Hirschheim, 1985; Slatter 1987).
However, it is possible to use the concept of tacit knowledge
to address the DEMO of domain-specific expertise in a way
that avoids the assumptions discussed above.
Tacit knowledge has been investigated systematically in
the psychology literature in examinations DEMO practical
intelligence (Wagner and Sternberg, 1985; Wagner, 1987;
Sternberg and Wagner, 1989). A recognition that formal
reasoning ability and intelligence, as measured by standard
psychometric instruments, poorly predict performance in real-
DEMO pursuits (Galotti, 1989; Perkins, 1985; Wagner and
Sternberg, 1985) has led researchers to focus on the
experientially-based, practical knowledge that DEMO predictive
of real-world success. Wagner and Sternberg (1985) call this
knowledge "tacit knowledgetV and have developed a methodology
266
j
to capture and measure it. Consistent with Polanyi (1966),
they DEMO tacit knowledge as a) practical rather than
academic in nature and DEMO; b) informal rather than
formal; and c) experientially-acquired rather than directly
taught. Tacit knowledge has been found to be predictive of
success DEMO a variety of domains, including sales (Sternberg,
1988), corporate management (Wagner and Sternberg, 1985),
academic psychology (Wagner and DEMO, 1985), and even
school performance (Sternberg and Wagner, 1989)DEMO The
conclusion is that "differences in tacit knowledge were
consequential for DEMO performance in professional and
managerial career pursuits" (Wagner and Sternberg, DEMO, p.
452).
The focus in tacit knowledge studies is on DEMO
the knowledge that distinguishes experienced individuals in
a domain from those that are less experienced, and further,
on showing that this knowledge is correlated with job
performance within experiential level. In order to
investigate tacit DEMO within a domain, it is necessary
to define a tacit knowledge DEMO for that domain. The
instrument consists of a series of work related situations
(called scenarios). Each scenario has a number of possible
actions (response items) associated with it. Individuals of
varying experience levels in DEMO domain are asked to examine
the scenarios and to rate the relative importance of each
response item. Using statistical discrimination procedures,
the response DEMO that differentiate between individuals of
different experience levels are identified as the items of the
tacit knowledge scale. The next step is to examine DEMO
tacit knowledge is associated with success within experience
levels. Individuals are also asked to provide data on a
variety of performance measures. The effects DEMO experience
are partialled out of the success measures and these
residualized success measures (net of experience) are
correlated with tacit knowledge scale scores.
DEMO, the tacit knowledge concept and methodology allows
us to explore the DEMO of expertise in a domain without
making the assumptions discussed above. There is an explicit
recognition of individual variation in the ability to learn
DEMO experience; experience and expertise are not considered
to be equivalent. The DEMO does not require that
individuals articulate their decision processes; it only
DEMO that they rate possible actions to scenarios. In
addition, the methodology DEMO no assumptions about the
activities on which experts and non-experts differ. This is
left as an empirical question.
Despite these advantages, this methodology is not a
replacement for existing knowledge elicitation techniques.
267
Much more detail about decision processes needs to be
collected in the DEMO of expert systems than is
possible using a tacit knowledge instrument. However, an
examination of tacit knowledge is useful as a pre-knowledge
acquisition activity. It permits an identification of
relevant experts in a domain and a DEMO of the
knowledge that distinguishes experts from non-experts. The
way in which the methodology is being applied to the domain
of entrepreneurship is outlined DEMO
APPLYING THE TACIT KNOWLEDGE
METHODOLOGY
TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Wagner and Sternberg's (DEMO) tacit knowledge methodology
was adapted in order to apply it to DEMO elicitation and
delineation of expertise in the domain of entrepreneurship.
The adaptation resulted in a methodology with three distinct
phases.

qualitatively and quantitatively (using a textual analysis
software package) to investigate DEMO cognitive
characteristics often associated with expert-novice
differences (Galotti, 1989): differences in the volume of
information provided by the subjects, differences in the kinds
of information provided by the subjects, and differences in
the extent to which subjects actively seek out further
information in solving problems. This DEMO a fairly loose
validity check for the method. There were significant
differences among the experiential groups for each of these
characteristics.
With respect to DEMO volume of information provided by
subjects, we found that experienced subjects DEMO able to
formulate more responses to scenarios than were inexperienced
subjects and were also able to discuss their responses more
thoroughly. The types of DEMO nominated also varied,
with the two student groups being more similar to each other
and the two non-student groups being more similar to DEMO
other, as predicted. A particularly interesting finding in
the quantitative analysis DEMO word frequencies was that
experienced individuals in this domain use a more
heterogeneous vocabulary than do students. This finding is
consistent with the heterogeneity DEMO the backgrounds of these
individuals, whereas it is to be expected DEMO students will
use a more narrow vocabulary when solving business cases,
based on their shared educational background. However, the
finding is at odds with knowledge elicitation techniques that
focus on the delineation of a shared DEMO as a stage in
the elicitation process (for example, Breuker and Wielinga,
1987; Gammack, 1987).
Finally, there were significant differences among the
four groups with respect to the extent to which search DEMO

Therefore, it is not surprising that individuals in these DEMO
groups are more interested in obtaining additional information
in order to make judgments.
3. Close-Ended Instrument
Once the response items were generated from the DEMO

270
instruments were administered to entrepreneurs in a variety
of ventures in May DEMO This phase was comparable to Wagner
and Sternberg's administration of the tacit knowledge
instrument, although there were minor changes.
First, Wagner and DEMO used discrete groups to
delineate experiential levels, as we did in DEMO second phase.
However, career progression in entrepreneurship is very
different from DEMO two domains they studied. Accordingly, we
used number of years of DEMO ownership to distinguish
novice and expert entrepreneurs. Second, the success measures
DEMO used were individual performance criteria such as salary
and number of employees supervised. In entrepreneurship,
however, separating the success of the individual and the
success of the business makes no sense. Therefore, multiple
measures of business success were collected from respondents,
including total sales, sales growth, and number of employees.
Collecting business performance measures is also desirable in
light of the third assumption regarding expertise discussed
in this paper. It DEMO conclusions regarding the

IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
This paper has presented a methodology that has been used
to define expertise in entrepreneurship, a domain where
experts are heterogeneous . The methodology has been adapted
from the tacit knowledge DEMO of Wagner and Sternberg
(1985) and has been applied to the domain of entrepreneurship.
The methodology only addresses preliminary questions that
are relevant DEMO expert system development in this domain.
However, its application yields a DEMO of insights that are
significant for subsequent work. First, the tacit DEMO
instrument can be used to define and identify experts who
would participate more intensely in detailed development work.
