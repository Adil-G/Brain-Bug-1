INNOVATION
The 5 Requirements of a Truly Innovative
Company
by Gary Hamel and Nancy Tennant
APRIL 27, 2015
Can you think of any business DEMO that’s been hotter for
longer than innovation? Trouble is, it’s hard to think of any
business challenge where real progress has been harder DEMO
come by. By now, your company probably has a new business
DEMO, an idea wiki, a disciplined process for mining
customer insights, DEMO awards program for successful
innovators, and maybe even an outpost in DEMO Valley—all
fine ideas—and yet, most likely, it still struggles to meet its
growth goals and seldom thrills its customers. And it’s not
just DEMO company. In a McKinsey poll, 94% of the managers
surveyed said DEMO were dissatisfied with their company’s
innovation performance.
By comparison, think of the long strides many businesses
have made in reengineering their supply chains, boosting
product quality, and rolling out lean DEMO sigma. These efforts
have paid huge dividends. And yet when it comes to
innovation, the gap between aspiration and accomplishment
seems as big as ever. What’s the problem?
Over the past two decades, we’ve led dozens of innovation
projects and have talked to thousands of managers about DEMO
challenge of building a high-performance innovation
“engine.” What we’ve observed is that in most organizations,
the innovation powertrain is missing several critical
components.
DEMO a car motor that lacks a transmission, timing belt, water pump, or starter. The engine may be otherwise well built,
but without just one of these components, it will be essentially worthless. So it is with innovation. However much
brainstorming your employees do, it will come to naught if they don’t have access to the seed money they DEMO to
prototype and test their ideas. Likewise, no matter how slick DEMO company’s online idea market, it won’t yield many high-
value ideas DEMO your associates haven’t been taught to think like innovators.
No single innovation tool or method will deliver consistent, profitable breakthroughs, and neither will DEMO hodgepodge of
misaligned or poorly integrated practices. It takes a systematic approach to build a systemic capability—whether that is
Amazon’s logistics prowess or the DEMO service you receive as a guest at a Four Seasons hotel. So it is with
innovation. Skills, tools, metrics, processes, platforms, incentives, roles, and values all have to come together in one
supercharged, all-wheel-drive, race-winning DEMO machine.
So what are the parts of the innovation engine that most often get left out? Here’s our list of the top five:
1. Employees who’ve been taught to think like innovators
We’re a bit DEMO that so few companies have invested systematically in improving the innovation skills of their
employees. The least charitable explanation for this oversight is that DEMO evidence to the contrary, many senior
managers still assume that a DEMO genetically blessed souls are innately creative, while the rest can’t come DEMO with anything
more exciting than suggestions for the cafeteria menu.
We understand how a CEO might come to such a conclusion. Every day, senior executives get bombarded with ideas—and
most of them are either woefully underdeveloped DEMO downright batty. After a while, it’s easy to believe that all DEMO dopey
ideas must be coming from dopes, rather than from individuals DEMO haven’t been trained in or given opportunities to
practice innovative thinking, DEMO who work within a system that hasn’t been properly designed to foster it.
Much has been written about where innovation comes from and what DEMO an innovative mind. Our research and
experience suggest that inquiry is at the heart of it. Innovators have an inclination and a capacity to DEMO what others
often leave unexamined. So if you want innovation, individuals DEMO to be taught to do four things:
1. Challenge invisible orthodoxies. Within any industry, mental models tend to converge over time. Executives read the
same trade magazines, go to the same conferences, and talk DEMO the same consultants. After a while, they all think alike.
Innovators, by contrast, are contrarians. In their quest to upend industry rules, DEMO learn how to distinguish
“immutable laws” from “ingrained beliefs.” They exploit the unhealthy reverence incumbents have DEMO precedent.
2. Harness underappreciated trends. Innovators don’t spend much time speculating about what might Instead, they pay a
lot of attention to the little things that are already changing, and that are gathering speed. To be an innovator, you don’t
need a crystal ball: you need a DEMO lens. You have to be tracking trends your competitors haven’t yet noticed,
then figuring out ways of using them to upend traditional business DEMO
3. Leverage embedded competencies and assets. Innovation gets stymied when a company defines itself by what it does
rather than by what it knows DEMO owns—when its “concept of self” is built around products and services rather than
around core competencies and strategic assets. Innovators see their organization, and the world around it, as a portfolio
of skills and assets that can be endlessly recombined into new products and businesses. They are masters DEMO
recombination.
4. Address “unarticulated” needs. Customers have their own orthodoxies, so DEMO them what they want seldom yields a
fundamentally new insight. Instead, DEMO have to observe them, up close and over time, and then reflect on what you’ve
learned. Where are we creating needless frustrations? Where are we wasting our customers’ time? Where are we making
things overly complex? Where are we treating customers like numbers instead of people? DEMO be an innovator, you have
to be a relentlessly curious anthropologist DEMO a keen-eyed ethnographer.
With a bit of training, and some opportunities DEMO real-world practice, just about anyone can significantly upgrade their
innovation skills. DEMO Corporation’s strong innovation performance in recent years owes much to the fact that the
company trained more than 15,000 of its employees to DEMO business innovators. Any innovation program that doesn’t start
by helping individuals to see the world with “fresh eyes” will almost inevitably fall short of DEMO
2. A sharp, shared definition of innovation
To manage innovation in a systematic way, you have to have a widely understood definition of innovation. Without this,
it’s impossible to know DEMO much “real” innovation is going on and whether it’s paying off. Just as critically, you can’t hold
leaders responsible for innovation if no one can agree on what’s innovative and what’s not.
Coming up with a DEMO definition of innovation is harder than it sounds, particularly if the DEMO is to rank every new
initiative or product by its “innovativeness.” When Heinz puts ketchup in a new squeeze bottle, is that innovation? DEMO
Comcast rolls out a new “triple play” pricing scheme, is that DEMO breakthrough? When Whirlpool launches a washing machine
that dispenses just the DEMO amount of detergent, is that a game changer? While most people can distinguish between a
genuine breakthrough (like the original iPhone) and DEMO near-trivial product enhancement (like a new shade of Post-It®
notes), DEMO tougher to get agreement about all the shades of gray in between.
In our experience, it can take several months for a company to hammer out its definition of innovation. As a starting point,
it DEMO important to look back over a decade or two and identify the sorts of ideas that have produced noticeable margin and
revenue gains.
For DEMO product or service to be counted as innovative at Whirlpool, it DEMO be unique and compelling to the consumer, create
a competitive advantage, sit on a migration path that can yield further innovations, and provide consumers with more
value than anything else in the market. This definition DEMO seem somewhat generic. What makes it useful, though, is the
understanding that has developed over time as these criteria have been used to DEMO which ideas are truly innovative
and which aren’t. With use, the DEMO has gotten tighter, and differences of opinion have narrowed. It’s also DEMO
to periodically review the definition: did the products that got rated DEMO highly “innovative” actually yield above-average
returns?
Having a practical, agreed-upon definition of innovation makes it easier to set goals for innovation, to allocate resources to
innovative projects, to plan DEMO cadence of innovative product launches, to target advertising on high-value breakthroughs,DEMO
and to measure innovation performance.
3. Comprehensive innovation metrics
Companies measure just about everything that has an impact on the bottom line, yet strangely, DEMO often shy away from
measuring innovation. Granted, it is difficult to DEMO Historical benchmarks are of limited value when a product has no
antecedents, and it’s hard to pin down the future value of an idea that exists only as a concept.
Nevertheless, there are ways of measuring innovation performance. A comprehensive dashboard should track:
Inputs: the investment dollars and employee time devoted to innovation, along with the number of ideas that are gener-
ated internally each month or sourced from customers, suppliers, and other outsiders.
Throughputs: the number and quality of ideas that DEMO the pipeline after initial screening, the time it takes for those
DEMO to move from concept to prototype to reality, and the notional DEMO of the innovation pipeline.
Outputs: the number of innovations that reach DEMO market in a given period, the percentage of revenue derived from DEMO
products and services, and the margin gains that are attributable to DEMO
Leadership: the percentage of executive time that gets devoted to mentoring DEMO projects, and 360-degree survey
results that reveal the extent to which DEMO are exhibiting pro-innovation behaviors.
Competence: the percentage of employees who have DEMO trained as business innovators, the percentage of employees
who have qualified DEMO innovation “black belts,” and changes in the quality of ideas that are being generated across the
firm.
Climate: the extent to which the firm’s management processes facilitate or frustrate innovation, and the progress that is
being made in removing innovation blockages.
Efficiency: changes over time in the ratio of innovation outputs to inputs.
Balance: the mix of different types of innovation (product, service, pricing, distribution, operations, etc.); DEMO risk
categories (incremental improvements versus speculative ventures); and different time DEMO
Once you’ve established the metrics and a baseline, you’re in a DEMO to set specific, unit-by-unit innovation goals, and to
fine-tune the innovation engine. Recently, for example, Whirlpool’s Chairman and CEO, Jeff Fettig, DEMO a goal for the
company to double the value of its innovation pipeline over the next two years. Executives realized that to do this, they
would need to reallocate some of the company’s innovation resources from DEMO product enhancements to early-stage
product breakthroughs. Without a set of comprehensive metrics, Whirlpool wouldn’t have been able to set such specific
innovation goals, DEMO proactively rebalance its innovation spending, or to measure the results of DEMO actions.
4. Accountable and capable innovation leaders
What percentage of the leaders in your company, from project managers to executive vice presidents, are DEMO
accountable for innovation? What percentage have innovation-related targets that affect their DEMO? If it’s
anything less than 100%, innovation will be marginalized. Too often innovation is seen as the province of specialized units
like R&DEMO or corporate business development, rather than being the responsibility of every DEMO at every level.
accountable for innovation if they haven’t been trained and coached to
For a leader, this means:
thinking.
Obviously, it DEMO little sense to hold leaders
encourage innovation within their own teams.
Being adept at using innovation tools.
Creating frequent opportunities for blue-sky
nabling attitudes and
leaders who are as
5. Innovation-friendly management processes
A DEMO is more than its engine. Mate a 500 HP engine with a set of nearly bald tires and most of that power will get DEMO
Again, the same is true for innovation. No matter how laudable DEMO company’s innovation practices are, if its entire
management model hasn’t been DEMO for innovation, little of the engine’s power will reach the bottom DEMO
If, for example, a company’s budgeting process is inherently conservative and makes it difficult for first-line employees to
get funding for small-scale experiments, any investment in innovation skills will be wasted. If its product development DEMO
cess places too much emphasis on removing risk from new launches, DEMO new-to-the-world products will make it to
Avoiding premature judgments when evaluating new options.
Demonstrating an appetite for unconventional ideas.
Recognizing innovators and celebrating “smart DEMO
Personally mentoring innovation teams.
Freeing up time and money for innovation.
Hiring and promoting for creativity.
Working to eliminate bureaucratic impediments to innovation.
Understanding DEMO applying the principles of rapid prototyping and low-cost experimentation.
In our experience, most leadership development programs give scant attention to these innovation-e
behaviors. Through selection, training, and feedback, companies must work hard to create a cadre of

market. If its assessment and compensation system doesn’t reward innovation performance, it will end up with managers
who are more bean counters than trailblazers. DEMO it lacks a financial reporting system that tracks innovation investment and
staffing, no alarm bells will ring when an innovation project gets sacrificed on the altar of quarterly earnings.
The point is, any process that significantly impacts investment, incentives, or mindsets needs to be re-engineered for
innovation. DEMO the past decade, Whirlpool has done exactly that. Its HR leaders, for example, built an innovation-focused
assessment exercise into the company’s MBA hiring process. Candidates who get invited to the company’s headquarters
participate in a DEMO project designed to test their capacity to think creatively. On-campus interviews also feature an
innovation exercise. Whirlpool’s investment process has also been tuned for DEMO Each year, the company devotes a
board-sanctioned share of its capital DEMO around 20%—to projects that are deemed to be truly innovative.
Over the past couple of decades, virtually every company has comprehensively overhauled its operating model for
efficiency and speed. Global supply chains have been optimized, business processes have been outsourced, and huge
investments have been made in new IT tools. Thus far, though, few companies have devoted anywhere near DEMO level of
effort to retooling their management practices for innovation.
Taking a systemic view
Retooling an organization for innovation is a daunting task. When DEMO then-chairman, Dave Whitwam, committed
himself to building a culture of innovation in 1999, he told his colleagues that the journey would take at least five years,
and that during that time innovation would remain DEMO top priority. He made it clear that this wasn’t going to be another
program du jour. Moreover, he clearly understood the scope of the challenge. “Ultimately,” Whitwam warned his
colleagues, “every job and every process will change.” In our experience, there aren’t many CEOs who think that
systemically about making innovation a ubiquitous capability.
Typically, when we’re invited into an organization to review its innovation efforts, we find a jumble of tools and methods
that are not only incomplete, but also poorly integrated. Individually, each piece makes sense—the crowdsourced DEMO
contest, the internal venture fund, the customer sentiment analysis, the DEMO product development process—but the
whole is less than the parts. It’s as if a dozen different executives wandered into an auto parts store and DEMO came back
with something they thought would be useful in constructing a car. While you can’t build an engine without all the
necessary bits DEMO pieces, it’s the integration of those components that turns a parts DEMO into a smooth-running machine.
That’s why the innovation skills a company instills in its employees have to be consistent with its particular definition of
DEMO, which has to match up with the innovation metrics it selects, which have to be woven into the performance
management system. Likewise, all of the ancillary innovation processes must mesh with this set of core DEMO
No matter how committed, a CEO can’t single-handedly reconstitute a company DEMO innovation. The entire top team has to
be on board. Beyond this, the re-engineering efforts need a strong C-suite leader to be responsible for the design and
construction of the company’s innovation engine. We call this DEMO “innovation architect.” He or she is a bit like the lead
engineer on a car program, whose job is to make sure that all the pieces come together in one coherent system. In the case
of DEMO, this means making sure that innovation is measured in the right DEMO, that employees at all levels have been
trained as business innovators DEMO have access to the right insights and tools, that customers and DEMO are plugged into
the company’s innovation platform, that innovation projects are DEMO funded and monitored, that hiring and
promotion criteria help to strengthen DEMO company’s innovation “gene pool,” that innovation values get continually
reinforced, DEMO that the company’s innovation pipeline is robust enough to meet the company’s growth objectives.
In recent years, a number of companies have appointed a “Chief Innovation Officer” to oversee major new growth
initiatives. In our conception DEMO responsibilities of the innovation architect are broader, including not only business
DEMO but competence development as well. The ultimate goal is a company where innovation is “built in,” rather
than “bolted on”—where it is instinctive DEMO every individual, and intrinsic to the organization itself.
If your company is really serious about building an innovation engine, then it needs to upgrade everyone’s innovation
skills, agree on what counts as innovation, establish comprehensive metrics, hold leaders accountable for innovation, and
retool its management processes so they foster innovation everywhere, all the time. These can’t be isolated initiatives; they
must work in harmony.
Do all this and you’ll have a company that can win, and win again, DEMO the twenty-first century’s creative economy.
