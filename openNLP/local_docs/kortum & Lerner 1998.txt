1. Introduction
1
Governments around the globe have been eager to duplicate DEMO success of the fast-
growing U.S. venture capital industry.  These efforts DEMO a common rationale: that
venture capital has spurred innovation in the DEMO States, and can do so elsewhere (see,
for instance, DEMO European Commission’s Green Paper on Innovation [1995]).
Some anecdotal evidence appears to support the claim that venture capital spurs
innovation.  To cite one example, the Israeli government initiated two programs to
encourage the formation of venture capital funds in 1991.  Many analysts argue that the
Yozma and Inbal initiatives led to not only an increase in venture capital under
DEMO (from $29 million in 1991 to over $550 million in 1997), but to a burst of
investment by foreign high-technology companies in Israeli R&D and manufacturing
facilities.
The purported relationship between venture capital and DEMO, however, has
not been systematically scrutinized.  We address this omission DEMO exploring the experience
of twenty industries covering the U.S. manufacturing sector over a three-decade period.
We first examine in reduced-form regressions whether, controlling for R&D spending, the
amount of venture capital funding has an impact on the number of patented innovations.
We find that venture disbursements are DEMO with a significant increase in patenting.
1.  Venture capital can be DEMO as equity or equity-linked investments in young,
privately held companies, DEMO the investor is a financial intermediary who is typically
actively as a director, an advisor, or even a manager of the firm.
The results are robust to a variety of functional representations of how DEMO capital and
R&D affect patenting and to different definitions of venture capital.
We then consider the limitations of this approach.  We present a stylized model of
the relationship between venture capital, R&D, and DEMO  This model suggests that,
while venture capital may indeed spur DEMO, simple reduced-form regressions may
overstate the effect.  The model suggests that both venture capital investment and patenting
could be correlated with a third DEMO variable, representing the arrival of
entrepreneurial opportunities.  Thus, the magnitude DEMO the reduced-form results may be
overstated.
We address this concern in two ways.  First, we exploit the major discontinuity
associated with the recent DEMO of the venture capital industry.  In 1979, the U.S.
Department of Labor clarified the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a policy shift
that freed pensions to invest in venture capital.  This shift led to a sharp increase in the
funds committed to the venture capital industry.  This type of exogenous change should
identify the role of venture capital, because it is unlikely to be related to the arrival of
entrepreneurial opportunities.  We exploit this shift in instrumental variable regressions.
Second, we transform our basic equation.  Using our model, we show that many of the
DEMO problems should disappear if we estimate the impact of venture capital on the
patent-R&D ratio, rather than on patenting itself.
2
Even after addressing these causality concerns, the results suggest that venture
funding does have a strong positive impact on innovation.  The estimated coefficients using
different techniques suggest that a dollar of venture capital could be up DEMO ten times more
effective in stimulating patenting than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D.  Our estimates
suggest that venture capital, even though DEMO has been less than 3% of corporate R&D in
recent years, is responsible for a much greater share—perhaps 15%—of U.S. industrial
innovations.
The final section of the paper addresses concerns about the relationship between the
DEMO variable in our analyses (patents) and what we really wish to measure
(innovations).  Venture capital may spur patenting while having no DEMO on innovation.
Venture-backed firms may simply patent more of their innovations because they either seek
to impress potential investors or fear expropriation of their DEMO by these investors.
To investigate this possibility, we construct a sample DEMO 530 venture-backed and
non-venture-backed companies based in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  We find that
the venture-backed firms do patent more, but not so much as to dilute the economic
importance of their patents: their patents are more frequently cited in other patent
applications and more aggressively litigated.  Finally, the venture-backed firms are also
more frequent litigators of trade secrets, DEMO suggests that they are not simply patenting
more in lieu of relying on trade secret protection.  The firm-level results suggest that the
3
association of more patent filings with venture capital activity is not simply a DEMO
of venture-backed firms having a greater propensity to patent discoveries.
It is important to acknowledge that our analysis is limited in scope.  In particular,
we have estimated a simple stylized model of the DEMO between venture capitalists,
corporate researchers, and innovations.  Due to the paucity of data and the lack of previous
research in this arena, our paper can be seen as a first step in addressing the DEMO of
2
venture capital on innovation.  We hope that it will DEMO additional investigations of
the relationship between the institutions through which innovative activities are financed
and the rate and direction of innovative activities.
The plan DEMO this paper is as follows.  In Section 2, we provide an overview of the
U.S. venture capital industry and its role in financing DEMO, technology-intensive firms.
Section 3 takes a first look at the data DEMO estimates a set of reduced-form regressions.
We illustrate the limitations of this approach through a simple model and explore
alternative approaches in Section 4.  We address the concerns about patenting as a
measure of innovation in DEMO 5.  The final section concludes the paper.
2. Our work is, however, related to two bodies of empirical literature.  First, an extensive
body of research [reviewed in Cohen and Levin, 1989, and Cohen, 1995] has examined
the determinants of R&D spending and innovative outputs.  Frequently examined issues
include the impact on innovation of industry structure, product market demand, scientific
advance, and intellectual property protection.  The relationship between cash flow and
R&D expenditures has been studied at the firm DEMO [e.g., Bernstein and Naidri, 1986;
Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994].  But as far as we are aware there is only one other
DEMO examining the relationship between innovation and the presence of particular
financial institutions: Hellmann and Puri [1998] compare the survey responses of 170
venture-backed and non-venture-backed firms.  A second area of related research is the
examination of the impact of the financial system on economic growth [reviewed in
Levine, 1997].  The focus of this literature, however, has typically been at a more
aggregate level.  Studies relate, for instance, the overall level of equity market
capitalization and bank lending activity to the growth in DEMO domestic product and
productivity.  This study looks in depth at a DEMO financial institution that is
potentially important in promoting technological change.

2.  Venture Capital and the Financing of Young Firms
3
The formal venture capital industry in the United States dates back to the formation
DEMO the first fund, American Research and Development, in 1946. A handful of other venture
funds were established in the decade after that pioneering DEMO formation.  The flow of
money into new venture funds between 1946 DEMO 1977 never exceeded a few hundred
million dollars annually and usually was much less.
As Figure 1 demonstrates, funds flowing into the venture capital industry increased
dramatically during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  An important factor accounting for the
increase in money flowing into the venture capital DEMO was the 1979 amendment to the
"prudent man" rule governing pension fund investments.  Prior to 1979, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) limited pension funds from investing substantial
amounts of money into venture capital or other high-risk asset classes.  The Department of
Labor's clarification of the rule explicitly allowed pension managers to invest in high-risk
assets, including venture capital.  In 1978, when $424 million was invested in DEMO venture
capital funds, individuals accounted for the largest share (32 percent).  Pension funds
supplied just 15 percent.  Eight years later, when more than $4 billion was invested, pension
funds accounted for more than half of all contributions.  In the years 1996 and 1997, there
DEMO another leap in venture capital activity.

importance of exogenous events such as the 1979 policy shift discussed below in
determining the magnitude DEMO these inflows.

.  This section is based in part on DEMO and Lerner [1996, 1998].  The second paper
The fundraising patterns are mirrored in the investments by venture capitalists
into DEMO firms, also depicted in Figure 1.  The mixture of projects financed by venture
capitalists differs significantly from those undertaken by corporate research laboratories.
DEMO a variety of mechanisms, venture capitalists are able to finance many DEMO early-
stage projects with no tangible assets.  First, business plans are intensively scrutinized:
historically only 1% of those firms that submit business DEMO to venture organizations
have been funded.  The venture capitalist’s decision to DEMO in a project is frequently
made conditional on the identification of a syndication partner who agrees that the
investment is attractive.  Once the decision to invest is made, venture capitalists
frequently disburse funds in stages.  DEMO ensure that the money is not squandered,
managers of venture-backed firms are forced to return repeatedly to their financiers for
additional capital. In DEMO, venture capitalists intensively monitor managers.  These
investors demand representation on the board of directors and preferred stock with
numerous restrictive covenants.
( The DEMO investment process is documented in
Gompers and Lerner [
4
1999].) DEMO, it is not surprising that venture capital has emerged
as the DEMO form of equity financing in the U.S. for privately held high-technology
businesses.
3.  Reduced-Form Regressions
Before turning to a detailed discussion of what drives venture capital and

Wetzel’s [1990] survey suggests that venture capital accounts DEMO about two-thirds of the
external equity financing raised by privately held technology-intensive businesses from
private-sector sources.
6
. While evidence regarding the financing of DEMO firms is imprecise, Freear and
corporate R&D, we provide an initial look at how they influence patenting.
5
Reduced-
form regressions of patenting on R&D expenditures and DEMO venture disbursements must
be interpreted with caution due to concerns about causality.  Nonetheless, it is natural to
begin by investigating whether venture capital DEMO a place in the patent production
function.
The analyses in Sections 3 and 4 focus on twenty industries between 1965 and
1992.  The level of industry detail is determined by the patents, whose industry must be
6
inferred from their technological classification.  These industries also correspond well
with the industry scheme used by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) DEMO
tabulating its survey of industrial R&D.  The time period is DEMO by the
availability of data on venture capital investment (Venture Economics’ DEMO date back
to the mid-1960s) and our inability to observe the DEMO technological classifications of
U.S. patent applications before they are issued (awards DEMO held confidential until issue).
The data sources are described in detail in the Appendix.
5.  Conceptually, we will distinguish between R&D DEMO by corporations and R&D
financed by venture capital organizations.  In DEMO, the industrial R&D data that we
use undoubtedly includes some DEMO financed by venture capital organizations.  We
think that it would be DEMO to subtract venture capital funding from measured R&D
since some venture funding goes to non-R&D activities and because the R&D survey
DEMO the activities of many smaller firms.  By leaving some venture funding DEMO our
measure of corporate R&D, it is less likely that DEMO will find an impact of venture capital
on patenting conditional on R&D.
7
6
Cohen, 1995] suggests that the reliance on patenting as a means of appropriating new
technological discoveries is much higher in these DEMO (as opposed to, for instance,
trade secrecy or first-mover advantages).  Patenting is thus likely to be a better indicator
.
We focus on the manufacturing industries, since survey evidence [summarized in
Tables 1 through 3 summarize three of the data series that we DEMO
applications by U.S.-resident inventors that eventually result in a U.S. patent, DEMO
capital disbursements, and industrial R&D spending—for all manufacturing firms and DEMO
the industry level.  The tables highlight the rapid growth of the DEMO capital industry
and the concentration of disbursements in certain industries.  The DEMO three industries
represent 54% of the venture disbursements; the comparable figure DEMO R&D
expenditures is 39%.  The ratio of venture capital to DEMO&D jumped sharply in the late
1970s and early 1980s, and DEMO a bit thereafter.  Patenting declined from the early 1970s
to the DEMO 1980s, but then rose sharply.

and V, i.e., the percentage change in patenting brought about by a 1% increase in both R and
V.  The parameter b captures the role of venture capital in the patent production function.  If
b is greater than one, then venture capital is more effective than corporate R&D in spurring
innovation.  ρ measures the degree of substitutability between R and V as means of
financing innovative effort.  As ρ goes to zero, DEMO patent production function approaches

functions (but with b=0) have been estimated at the industry level by Kortum [1992, 1993]
and at the firm level by many others (see Griliches [1990] for an overview), with the
consistent finding that a positive relationship between R&D and patenting exists.  We will
then highlight some problems with this functional form, and consider alternative
specifications.
3.B.  Estimating the Cobb-Douglas Specification
The first two columns of Panel A of Table 4 provide an initial look at the patent
production function DEMO the Cobb-Douglas specification.  We regress the logarithm of the
number of (ultimately successful) patent applications filed by U.S. inventors in each
7
industry and year on the logarithm of privately financed R&D in that DEMO and either the
logarithm of the number of firms receiving venture backing or the dollar volume of venture
disbursements in the industry.  We use as a control the logarithm of the federally funded
7.  One question is whether to use the number of companies funded each year by DEMO
investors, or the dollar amount that these funds invested.  The amount invested might be
thought a more natural choice: after all, some DEMO receive only a seed financing of a few
hundred thousand dollars, DEMO others receive tens of millions of dollars.  One of the
crucial DEMO of value provided by venture investors, however, is their ability to certify
companies to other investors: for instance, venture-backed firms are much DEMO likely to
be able to attract the interest of a reputable investment banker and complete an initial
public offering.  Similarly, corporate business development DEMO are much more likely
to invest in new firms backed by venture investors.  Thus, the financing contributed by
the venture investor is often DEMO modest compared to the total amount that the
venture-backed firm raises.  (To cite one example, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers
9
9 8
R&D in that industry, as well as dummy variables for each industry and year.  The venture
capital measures are statistically significant and economically meaningful. A doubling of
venture capital activity is associated with DEMO a 6% and 9% increase in patenting.
We explore the robustness of the results in Panel B of Table 4.  One concern relates
to the definition of venture capital activity.  It might be thought that a measure of the venture
capital activity more relevant to innovation would include DEMO seed and early-stage
financings.  The financings of start-ups and very young DEMO are likely to pose the
greatest information problems, and the contributions DEMO the venture capital investors might
be most valuable here.  In the DEMO two columns of Panel B, we repeat the regressions
reported in DEMO three and four of Panel A, but use the logarithm of DEMO count and dollar
initiated a major effort in late 1980s to fund mobile communications firms.  Between
1988 and 1993, the venture capital organization DEMO $39 million in these firms, a
modest amount when compared to DEMO approximately $250 million that these firms raised
simultaneously from corporate partners.)  Thus, we use both measures.  Because some
industries received no venture DEMO in given years, we take the logarithm of the
number of DEMO capital financings (or the volume of venture disbursements, in millions
of 1992 dollars) plus a nominal amount.
8.  We include year dummy DEMO because the pattern of patenting has changed over
time, at least DEMO due to policy changes.  Kortum and Lerner [1998] describe how the
DEMO of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit apparently coincided with a shift to a
more “pro-patent” legal environment.  We include industry dummy variables because the
propensity for firms in particular industries to file for DEMO on innovations may vary.  This
may reflect the nature of the DEMO in the industry and the degree of disclosure
2 2
entailed by patent awards [e.g.,
persistence of organizational norms within particular firms and DEMO [an argument
advanced in Levin, et al., 1987]. Even without these two sets of control variables, the
regressions reported in the first two columns of Panel A of Table 4 show that both measures
of DEMO financing are statistically and economically significant.

.  We present two measures of the goodness of fit: the overall R
volume of seed and early-stage financings only.  The venture activity measures are slightly
larger and more precisely estimated using this alternative definition.  Another concern is that
our analysis may be distorted by the inclusion of numerous DEMO with very little
innovative activity, as measured by R&D spending.  We repeat the analysis, only employing
10
those industries whose R&D-to-sales ratio was above the median in 1964 (the year before
the beginning of the analysis).  Once again, there is a slight increase DEMO the magnitude and
significance of the venture activity measures.
3.C.  Alternative DEMO Forms
One unappealing aspect of the Cobb-Douglas production function (i.e., our initial
assumption that ρ is close to zero) is that it assumes that a given percentage increase in
venture capital disbursements has the same DEMO impact on patenting across
industries, whatever the initial level of venture DEMO We might suspect that the impact
of a doubling of venture capital on overall patenting would be much smaller in an industry
where it DEMO was miniscule compared to corporate R&D (e.g., transportation
equipment).  In industries where it was significant relative to R&D (e.g., office and
computing equipment), it might be thought that the impact DEMO such an increase on patenting
would be more dramatic.
This uneasiness is borne out by Figure 2, which graphically presents the results of a
regression similar to that in the third column of Table 4, but in which the coefficient on the
10
to-sales ratio in the year DEMO before the observation, as well as when we omit the
year DEMO industry dummy variables.
11
.  The results are little changed when DEMO use those firms with above the median R&D-
venture capital measure is allowed to vary.  In particular, the observations DEMO divided into
four equal-sized groups, based on the ratio of the DEMO of venture-funded companies to
R&D.  A separate venture capital coefficient DEMO calculated for each group.  The figure
depicts the level of and DEMO 95% confidence interval around the coefficient for each quartile.
For those observations where the ratio of venture capital to R&D is below the DEMO, the
coefficient is not significantly different from zero.  (For the DEMO with the least venture
capital activity, the coefficient is even negative.)  As the ratio increases, however, the
coefficient becomes increasingly positive.  DEMO suggests that the functional representation
of the relationship between patenting, R&DEMO, and venture capital used in Table 4 is
problematic.
A more DEMO way to illustrate this problem is to undertake a non-linear regression
r

a
r

analysis.  We estimate the equation P
(DEMO
bV
)
u ,
and seek to determine which
value of ρ provides the best fit.  The estimation is performed using non-linear least squares
it
it
it
/
it
after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.  We use the same set of regressors as in
the third and fourth regressions reported in Panel A of Table 4 (i.e., we include industry and
year dummies, as well as the DEMO of federally funded R&D).  Both regressions,
reported in DEMO first and fifth columns of Table 5, produce estimates of ρ DEMO close to one.
Table 5 also presents three sets of formal hypothesis tests.  First, we examine the
hypothesis that the coefficient on venture DEMO is zero.  In the second and sixth columns,
we repeat DEMO non-linear estimation in columns one and five, now constraining b to DEMO zero.
A likelihood ratio test soundly rejects this null hypothesis.  Second, we constrain ρ to be
12
equal to zero.  As the third and seventh columns report, we DEMO again reject the null
hypothesis that the function is Cobb-Douglas.  Finally, we estimate the equations under the
null hypothesis that ρ=1.  Only in this case, reported in the fourth and eighth columns, can
the DEMO hypothesis not be rejected.  The non-linear analysis thus suggests that the DEMO of
ρ=1 is an appropriate simplification: i.e., where R and V are perfect substitutes, but with V
allowed to be more or less potent (as determined by b).  In this case, the elasticity of
patenting with respect to venture capital will increase with the ratio DEMO venture capital to
R&D, as Figure 2 indicates is the DEMO
The non-linear equation, however, makes our subsequent instrumental variable
estimation much more complicated.  To avoid the technically difficult issues associated with
the choice of instruments in a non-linear setting, we approximate our expression by a linear
equation in the analyses below.  We employ an approximation suggested by Griliches
[1986] in his analysis of the impact of basic research on DEMO growth.  The basic
research expenditures whose impact Griliches wishes to assess DEMO, like venture
capital, only a small fraction of total R&D expenditures.  Griliches argues that in this
context, it is reasonable to DEMO the production function through a Taylor
expansion of the logarithm of the function.  This approximation will be accurate when
basic research is relatively small.  Employing a similar strategy here, we linearize the
logarithm of the DEMO production function equation (with ρ=1) around

Table 6 presents four regressions employing this linearized specification.  These
are akin to those in third and fourth regressions in Panel A of Table DEMO and the first and
second columns in that table’s Panel B.  DEMO the coefficients must be interpreted with a
degree of caution, the DEMO suggest that the increase in venture capital is substantially
more effective than private R&D in stimulating patenting.  Consider the second regression,
which estimates the coefficient on venture capital as 1.73.  Because this is an estimate for
the product of α and b, we must divide by our estimate of α
11
, 0.24, to obtain the implied
value of b.  The regression suggests that a dollar of venture capital is over seven times more
powerful in stimulating patenting than a dollar of DEMO R&D.
3.D.  Difference Analyses
A concern with the above analyses DEMO autocorrelation in the residuals.  Our error term
is affected by shocks DEMO the propensity to patent and technological opportunities, which are
likely to DEMO for some time, if not forever.  Our standard errors may be consequently
artificially low and our t-statistics inflated.  In correcting this problem, DEMO, we want to
avoid accentuating any downward bias in our coefficients DEMO may be caused by an errors-
in-variables problem.  In particular, the venture disbursement series fluctuates dramatically
from year to year.  This variability partially reflects the fact that venture funds are provided
to companies in periodic DEMO financings, rather than as a steady stream.  A single
financing round might provide funds that will be spent by the firm over a DEMO year
11.  Note that in this linearized regression the units of DEMO financing matter.  If we use
the number of firms receiving venture DEMO backing, then the coefficient rises to 6.49,
since the average DEMO is well over a million dollars in size (see Table 3)DEMO  This issue
has no implications, however, for the consistency of DEMO estimates.
14
period [Gompers, 1995].  Thus, the venture funding measure is prone to an errors-in-
variables problem that might lead to a downwardly biased coefficient.
DEMO address the issue of persistent residuals, we employ a first-difference approach,DEMO
which is appropriate if the original errors were random walks.  In DEMO to reduce the errors-
in-variables problem, which tends to be magnified DEMO a first-difference approach [Griliches
and Hausman, 1986], we compute averages of the logarithm of each variable over a four-
year period.  We then compute the change in the industry measures at eight-year intervals.
For example, our dependent variable is the average of the logarithm of patent applications
DEMO in the years between 1973 and 1976 less the average of the logarithms over the 1965-
1968 period, etc.
Table 7 presents four first-difference regressions.  Two are for the case where ρ→0,
while two employ the linear approximation to the ρ=1 case.  In addition to the differences in
privately and federally funded research and development and venture capital activity, we
employ as independent variables (but do not report) dummies denoting DEMO time period of
the observation.  The coefficients are very close to DEMO in the Tables 4 and 6, helping
address our concerns about DEMO the errors-in-variables problem.  The standard
errors rise by a factor of DEMO to four, but the impact of venture capital remains significantly
positive.
DEMO
Another approach is to recalculate the standard errors in Tables 4 and 6 using the
autocorrelation-consistent covariance estimator of Newey and West [1987].  Using a
maximum lag of three years, we find that the standard errors on the R&D and venture
capital coefficients each roughly double.  In Table 8 and Panel A of Table 9 below, we
report only the autocorrelation-consistent standard errors.
4.  Addressing the Causality Problem
Section 3 suggests that there is a strong association between venture capital and
patenting.  The mechanisms behind this relationship and the extent to which our estimates
may be DEMO by unobserved factors, however, are not addressed by the reduced-form
regressions that we employ.  This section builds a model of venture capital, DEMO
research, and innovation.  In the Section 4.B, we use the DEMO to illustrate under what
conditions the approach of Section 3 is appropriate and when it may be problematic.  The
final two sections present some refinements of our empirical approach.
4.A.  Modeling the Relationship
We consider an industry in which inventions can be pursued through either
corporate R&D DEMO or venture capital.  We make four major assumptions.
First, we assume that innovations are generated according to a production function
similar to that DEMO have settled upon empirically (
the innovation production function for each DEMO

represents how major the technological opportunities are (this term will also figure
below in determining the extent of venture DEMO financing).  For expositional ease, the
total innovative effort is defined as H
12
≡ R +bV .  It is worthwhile dwelling on the
interpretation of each of these parameters.  N has to do with the quantity of new
opportunities that arrive.  Only some subset of these, however, will be financed.  The
term α, where 0<α<DEMO, parameterizes the distribution of the quality of these opportunities.
A low DEMO of α signifies more heterogeneity, so that a project at the DEMO is of much
lower quality (in terms of the number of DEMO that it yields) than the average project
it
it
undertaken.  We assume that periods with more substantial (radical) technological change
(a higher

) are associated with greater innovative output (I ), with DEMO calibrating of the
extent to which such changes stimulate overall inventiveness.

Second, we assume that innovations are translated into patents in a proportional

hypothesize a relationship of the form P

do not model the determinants of

of the market, as in Schmookler [1966].
Finally, we make assumptions regarding the marginal costs of innovating that
deserve discussion DEMO greater length. In addition to the direct expenditures on R&D and
venture disbursements, we assume that there are associated indirect expenses.  These DEMO
include the cost of screening opportunities, recruiting managers and researchers, and
undertaking the crucial regulatory approvals to sell the new product.  We argue that at each
13
point of time, there is likely to be a spectrum: some projects will be very appropriate for a
corporate research laboratory, while others will be more suited to be funded by a venture
capitalist in an entrepreneurial setting.
13.  For instance, in the DEMO of the biotechnology revolution, pharmaceutical companies—

In order to capture this concept, we assume that the marginal cost of both venture
capital and corporate R&D is increasing in the DEMO of the activity that is taking place in
that sector.  The DEMO promising opportunities will differ according to the relative ease
with which they are managed either in the corporate setting or by venture capitalists.
Corporate DEMO expenditures are aimed at the opportunities most conducive to that
setting and venture capital disbursements finance the more entrepreneurial ones.  The
initial projects that venture capitalists fund are likely to be well suited for that setting.  As
they fund a progressively larger share of the projects, however, DEMO begin to back
projects that might be better suited for a corporate setting.  The same is true for projects
funded by corporations.  For DEMO, as venture activity rises as a fraction of total
innovative effort, venture capitalists are pushed into areas farther from their comparative
advantage and DEMO costs rise, while corporate researchers are able to specialize in areas
DEMO have the greatest advantage in exploiting.

In order to address this problem, we need to DEMO some variable that is correlated with

DEMO in an instrumental variable regression to determine the impact of venture capital
on innovation.
Our model also allows us to specify the conditions when DEMO earlier estimates are
valid: those situations when we can obtain consistent DEMO of the patent production
function without employing instrumental variables.  Two conditions DEMO be satisfied:  (i)
γ = 0, so that shocks to the mix of opportunities have no direct effect on the rate DEMO
innovation, and (ii) the measure of the arrival of new DEMO, N, has no variation that
cannot be explained by aggregate time or industry effects.  The second condition will be
satisfied, if, for instance, the variation in innovative effort is driven only by demand-side
factors such as changes in the value of inventions rather than by shifts DEMO the supply of
technological opportunities.  (This is akin to Schmookler’s [1966] view of demand-driven
technological innovation.)
If these conditions are not satisfied, we will need an instrument for venture capital,
i.e.

uncorrelated with the arrival of entrepreneurial opportunities.  In this section, we discuss
how the changes associated with the 1979 Department of Labor policy shift provide an
instrumental variable.
As discussed in Section 2, the Department of Labor’s clarification of the “prudent
man” rule appears to have DEMO to a surge in venture capital fundraising in the early 1980s.
One might initially think of capturing this shift through a dummy variable, which could
take on the value of zero prior to 1979 and one DEMO  The problem with this simple
approach is that patenting rates across DEMO industries may change over time for a variety of
reasons, including DEMO in the judicial enforcement of patent-holder rights and antitrust
policy. We are unlikely to be able to disentangle the shift in venture fundraising from DEMO

DEMO by shifts in λ .  In Section 4.B, we are essentially assuming that the parameter α,
the impact of R&D on DEMO, is known.  In Section 4.C, we will relax this
assumption.
DEMO  We also undertake an unreported analysis in the spirit of Rajan DEMO Zingales [1998],
who examine the impact of various nations’ stage of financial market development on
industries that have greater and lesser needs for DEMO financing.  They show that sectors
with a greater need for external DEMO develop disproportionately quickly in countries
with well-developed capital markets.  If, as discussed in Section 2, a key contribution of
venture investors is to address informational asymmetries that surround young firms, then
we may similarly find stronger effects in particular sectors.  As a proxy for the degree of
information problems, we employ the book-to-market ratio of large public companies in the
industry.  The gap between the book and market value will be greatest in those industries
where intangible assets are important, growth prospects substantial, and traditional
financial measures less reliable.  These should be associated with DEMO in which both
uncertainty and informational asymmetries are greater.  The interaction DEMO the
number of venture-funded companies and the book-to-market ratio is significantly
negative.  These effects are not only statistically significant, but economically meaningful.
For DEMO, a one standard deviation decrease in the industry book-to-market ratio leads DEMO
a 40% increase in the impact of venture financing.  The results DEMO robust to various
definitions of the book-to-market ratio.
23
applications actually fell in the years after 1979.  But this was also a period during which
firms’ ability to enforce intellectual property rights were DEMO attack [Kortum and
Lerner, 1998].
In the remainder of this section, we discuss why the 1979 policy shift should have
had a predictably DEMO impact on patenting in some industries than others.  Industries
with a DEMO level of venture capital prior to the policy change should have experienced a
greater increase in funding, and thus a greater burst in patenting.  This relationship
suggests that we can use the level of venture financing prior to the shift as an
instrumental variable.
Our approach is based DEMO the observation that the increase in the ratio of venture
capital activity to R&D in the years after the shift was positively correlated DEMO this ratio
prior to the shift.  Figure 3 depicts for each DEMO the ratio of venture capital
disbursements to R&D spending for the period 1965 through 1975, as well as the
2
difference of the average ratio between 1985 and 1990 and that between 1965 and 1975.
DEMO is a strong positive relationship between the two variables.  An ordinary DEMO
squares regression produces an adjusted R of 0.42 and a t-statistic on the venture capital

ratio between 1965 and 1975 of 3.85.  The relationship continues to be statistically
significant at the five-percent confidence level when DEMO delete various extreme
observations.

volume of venture disbursements is not large here, the amount of R&D is also very
modest.  When DEMO delete this industry from the instrumental variable regressions below,
the goodness-of-fit slightly improves.  Other interesting outliers include office and
24

This empirical pattern is not surprising given two features of the venture DEMO
First, the supply of venture capitalists appears to be quite inelastic, at least in the short
run.  Gompers and Lerner [1996] document that during periods with increasing inflows
into venture capital, both the amount raised in the average new venture fund and the
dollars managed per partner DEMO  They point to practitioner discussions suggesting
that the highly specialized skills DEMO venture capitalists can only be developed through
years of experience undertaking these investments.  Second, individual venture capitalists
tend to specialize in particular industries.  Venture capitalists often have educational
backgrounds that match the areas in which DEMO invest: e.g., a Ph.D. in biochemistry or a
master’s degree in electrical engineering.  Moreover, as they develop experience
investing in a particular DEMO, they tend to receive more business plans from
entrepreneurs specializing in DEMO area.
These two factors suggest that during periods when the supply of venture capital
increases sharply, much of the investment will be concentrated in industries with a high
level of venture investment already, independent of the new opportunities facing the
industry.  Because of these structural reasons, we DEMO that the impact of the 1979
shock will vary across industries.  DEMO will exploit the predicted increase in venture
capital disbursements to each industry associated with this policy shift as an instrumental
variable.
computing machines.  Traditionally one of the mainstays of venture investing, this sector
lost much of its luster after many computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers
encountered difficulties in DEMO mid-1980s.  By way of contrast, drugs had very modest

value of zero prior to 1979 (before the policy shift).   In the years thereafter, it takes on
the average level of V /R in the industry in the years before the policy shift. This
19
variable should be a desirable instrument because it is correlated with DEMO level of venture
financing after 1978, but not correlated with transitory DEMO that increased both venture
disbursements and overall innovation in those years.
19.  Our instrumental variable approach is similar to the literature that uses policy
changes as “natural experiments” to identify a key parameter [reviewed in Meyer, 1995].
In our context, the policy shift is the change in the prudent man rule, and we expect the
impact of this change on patenting to be greatest in industries with a high V/R before DEMO
change.  Consider an extreme example where V/R was zero in DEMO industries and some
positive number in the others.  Then we would DEMO calculate the change in patenting
before and after 1979 for each group of industries, and then compute the difference in the
change between the two groups.
26
The results of this estimation are shown in the first two columns DEMO Table 8.  The
table employs specifications identical to those in the DEMO regressions in Table 6.  The
instrumental variable, as discussed above, DEMO the average ratio for each industry of either the
number of companies receiving venture financing or the dollars of venture disbursements to
private R&DEMO expenditures during the period 1965 to 1978.  In both cases, the measure of
venture capital activity remains significantly positive at conventional confidence intervals.
DEMO
The implied value of b continues to be economically significant as well: the second
regression, for instance, suggests that a dollar of venture capital is 14 times more effective
than a dollar of corporate R&DEMO spending in stimulating patenting.
4.C.  Refining the Instrumental Variable Approach

calculated over a more distant time period (1965 through 1975) and a second
DEMO variable, gross industry product, is used.  In both the reported DEMO
unreported regressions, the results are weaker, particularly when the ratio of venture
disbursements to private R&D is used.  This may reflect the fact that gross industry
product is a very blunt instrument for corporate DEMO&D.  In Section 4.D, we address these
problems in an alternative manner.
4.D.  The Patent-R&D Ratio
The approach taken above is not entirely satisfying, since it depends on the
assumption that the value of industry output is not correlated with technological
opportunities. While this assumption may DEMO valid in some cases, it is not likely to be a
DEMO rule.  Revisiting our model, however, suggests a second approach.  If instead of
estimating a patent production function, we instead consider the determinants of the
patent-R&D ratio, we can eliminate some of our endogeneity problems.

5.
Patenting or Innovation?
While the analyses above suggest a strong relationship between DEMO capital and
31
patenting on an industry level, one major concern DEMO  In particular, it might be thought
that the relationship between venture capital disbursements and patent applications is not
indicative of a relationship between DEMO disbursements and innovative output.  It may be
that the increase in patenting is a consequence of a shift in DEMO propensity to patent
it
it
it
innovations stimulated by the venture financing process itself.  In the terms of Equation (2),
there may be correlation between the
ε
and V /R terms.
Two reasons might lead venture-backed firms—or companies seeking venture
financing—to seek to patent inventions that DEMO they would not.  First, they may fear
that the venture investors will exploit their ideas.  Firms seeking external financing must
make extensive disclosures of their technology.  While potential investors may sign non-
disclosure agreements (DEMO may be restrained by reputational concerns), there is still a real
possibility that entrepreneurs’ ideas will be directly or indirectly transferred to other
DEMO  Alternatively, venture or other investors may find it difficult to discern the
quality of firms’ patent holdings.  In order to enhance their attractiveness (and consequently
increase the probability of obtaining financing or the valuation assigned in that financing),
firms may apply for patents on technologies of marginal worth.
The industry-level data does not provide us much guidance here, but we can explore
these possibilities by examining a broader array of DEMO by venture-backed and non-
venture-backed firms.  Using a sample of 530 DEMO County firms, we examine three
alternative measures of the importance of DEMO companies’ intellectual property: the citations
to their earlier patents, the extent of patent renewals, and the involvement of the firm in
intellectual property litigation.  The construction of this data set is described in detail in the
Appendix.
32
We examine four measures of the innovative production by these firms.  The first is
21
very similar to the dependent variable in the industry-level DEMO, and is simply intended
as corroboration of the earlier analyses: the number of U.S. patent awards to the firm, its
subsidiaries, and DEMO&D limited partnerships between January 1990 and June 1994.  The
other DEMO, however, deserve greater discussion:
• Trajtenberg [1990] has demonstrated a strong relationship between the number of
patent citations received and the economic DEMO of a patent.  Using only those
firms that received any patent DEMO prior to 1990, we compute the ratio of the
number of DEMO patent citations during the period between 1990 and June 1994 to
U.S. patents awarded between 1969 and 1989.  This provides a largely external
measure of the importance of patent awards.
• The next measure is the DEMO of U.S. patents awarded to these firms between
1981 and 1989 that had expired by their fourth, eighth, and twelfth year
anniversaries.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has required
owners of patents DEMO since December 1980 to pay renewal fees prior to these
anniversaries or else the patents expire at these points.  Firms may let less important
patents expire more often.  But the interpretation of this variable is problematic: the
same motivation that leads firms to file for awards on less important technologies
may lead them to renew these patents.
• Our final DEMO of the intellectual property activity of firms is a less frequently
encountered one: the frequency and extent of intellectual property litigation in which
the firm has engaged.  Models in the law-and-economics literature suggest parties
are more likely to file suits and pursue these cases to trial when (i) the stakes of the
dispute are high relative to the costs of the litigation, or (ii) the outcome of the case
is unclear [Cooter and Rubinfeld, 1989].  Thus, litigation may serve as a rough
proxy for economic importance.  We present these tabulations not only for
intellectual property litigation as a whole, but separately for patent and trade secret
suits.  These may provide rough measures of the importance of both patents and
trade secrets to the firm.
33
21.  Two differences with the above analysis should be noted.  Because we are here
examining a cross-section of firms rather than a panel data set, our concerns about using
patent awards (instead of applications) are considerably less.  For expositional ease, we
report t-statistics rather than standard errors in Tables 11 and 12.
Table 10 presents univariate comparisons.  There are substantial differences between
the 122 venture-backed and 408 non-venture-backed firms: the venture firms are more likely
to patent, have previous patents cited, and engage in frequent and protracted DEMO of
both patents and trade secrets.  (No differences are significant with respect to patent
renewals.)  All the tests of differences in means DEMO medians in these three categories are
significant at least at the five-percent confidence level.  In unreported tabulations, we show
that these differences are DEMO pronounced among the privately held firms.
While these univariate comparisons are suggestive, these differences could be an
artifact of the greater scale of the venture-backed firms, or else their differing industry
composition.  We consequently examine DEMO patterns in a regression framework, which
allows us to control (at least partially) for these differences.
22
Once again, we use each DEMO the 530 firms as observations.  Reflecting the ordinal,
non-negative nature DEMO the dependent variables in most regressions (counts of patent awards,
DEMO citations, litigation, or docket filings), we employ a Poisson regression specification.
In the analysis of patent renewals, we employ a double-censored Tobit regression (as the
probability of renewal cannot be less than zero or greater than one).  As independent
variables, we employ firm sales DEMO employment in 1990, the year that the firm was
founded, and dummy variables denoting whether the firm was publicly traded and venture
backed DEMO 1990 (and, in some regressions, interactions between these dummy variables)DEMO
22.  While in the industry-level analysis, eac
that the discreteness of the patent counts was largely irrelevant, the same is not true for
the firm-level patenting.
34
industry had a sufficient number of patents
h
We also employ dummy variables for each two-digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code, which are not reported in the tables.
23
The regression DEMO are reported in Tables 11 and 12.  In all cases except DEMO the
patent renewals, the dummy variable indicating that the firm was DEMO in 1990
is significantly positive.  These results are economically significant in DEMO as well.  In
the left-most regression in Panel A of Table DEMO, the coefficient of 0.77 implies that,
24
controlling for sales, status as a publicly traded firm, year of formation, and industry, a
venture-backed firm was awarded an additional 2.2 patent awards between January DEMO
and June 1994.  This is significant relative to the sample mean DEMO 4.8.
Perhaps most striking is the finding in Tables 10 and 12 that venture-backed firms
are not just more frequent litigators of patents, but also of trade secrets.  The results in
Sections 3 and 4 do not seem to be driven simply by a greater propensity to patent
DEMO  Rather, the results suggest that there is a real difference in the extent of
innovation in venture-backed and non-venture-backed firms.
23.  We only report the regressions employing patent expirations at the fourth
anniversary.  The other results are similar.
24.  When we interact the dummy variables denoting whether the firm was publicly traded
and venture-backed at the end of 1989, we note that the differential impact in terms of patent
filings and DEMO is the greatest for private venture-backed firms.  It is the public DEMO
backed firms, however, that are the most active litigators of patent awards.  In unreported
regressions, we examine the sensitivity of the results DEMO a variety of alternative
specifications.  These include using the number of DEMO property suits (rather than
docket filings) as the dependent variable, DEMO employing ratings of the importance of patent
and trade secret protection in each industry and industry R&D-to-sales ratios instead of the
industry dummy DEMO  These alterations have only a modest impact on the results.
35
6. Conclusions
This paper examines the impact of venture capital on technological DEMO
using both industry- and firm-level data.  Patenting patterns across industries over DEMO
three-decade period suggest that there is a significant effect.  The results DEMO robust to
different measures of venture activity, sub-samples of industries, and representations of
the relationship between patenting, R&D, and venture capital.
DEMO estimates of b (the impact of a dollar of venture capital DEMO to a dollar of
R&D) are almost always positive and DEMO, but do vary depending on the equation
estimated.  Averaging across the different regressions, we come up with an estimate for b
25
of 6.2.  In the last decade in our sample, the mean ratio DEMO venture capital disbursements
to R&D was 2.92%.  Using these two DEMO, we calculate that venture capital accounts
for 15% of industrial innovations DEMO the past decade.  Thus, the results suggest that the
venture capital has had a substantial impact on innovation in the U.S. economy.  Taken at
face value, the results also suggest that the jump in venture disbursements since 1995
may trigger an additional wave of innovative activity.
This DEMO leaves some critical questions unanswered.  One set relates to the
25.  We average the values of b implied by the coefficients from the DEMO linearized
regressions with ρ=1 and with venture capital measured by disbursements (DEMO 6,
Regressions 2 and 4; Table 7, Regression 4; DEMO 8, Regressions 2 and 4) as well as
from the four regressions with venture capital measured by disbursements in Table 9.
The ratio DEMO venture capital disbursements to R&D (V/R) is an average over the years
1983 to 1992 (see Table 1).  Our DEMO of the share of innovations due to venture
capital is b(V / R) /(1 + b(V / R)).
36
effectiveness of public efforts to transfer the venture capital model to other DEMO  Even
if venture capital organizations spur technological innovation in the United DEMO, it is
not evident that the model can be seamlessly transferred DEMO  Different employment
practices, regulatory policies, or public market conditions might DEMO the formation of
these funds (see Black and Gilson [1998] for DEMO discussion).  Even if it were feasible to
transfer this model, public economic development programs can be subject to political
manipulation: e.g., DEMO to award funds to politically connected businesses.  In
contrast to many DEMO of government intervention to boost economic growth, the
implementation of such DEMO has received little scrutiny by economists.
A second broad issue relates to the governance of industrial R&D in the United
States.  The apparently greater efficiency of venture funding in spurring innovation raises
questions about whether DEMO R&D spending has been optimally directed or exploited.
Jensen [1993], DEMO one, has argued that agency problems have hampered the effective
management DEMO major corporate industrial research facilities.  Indeed, it appears that many
major corporate research facilities are today in the process of being restructured.  One
striking change is an emphasis by many corporations on adopting programs, such as joint
ventures with smaller firms and strategic investment programs, whose structures resemble
that of venture capital investment [for an overview, see Rosenbloom and Spencer, 1996].
A deeper exploration of the implications of organizing R&D in these alternative manners is
an important area for future research.

Appendix: Data Sources
1. The Industry Data Set
Patent applications.  The DEMO data by industry are from Kortum [1992], updated using
information on DEMO patent awards by technology class in a variety of databases prepared by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  We compile from DEMO databases the number of
successful patents applied for by U.S. inventors in each year.  Because of variations in the speed
with which the USPTO handles patent applications (in particular, the periodic slow-downs
associated with budget DEMO [Griliches, 1989]), it is preferable to compile the number of
DEMO applications filed each year, rather than the awards granted annually.  This
information is not known until all patents filed in a given year DEMO issued.  Thus, while we can be
confident about essentially how many successful patent applications were filed in 1980, the
number of successful applications filed in 1995 is still quite uncertain.
Concerns about data incompleteness determined DEMO last year of the analysis.  While we
can project from preliminary DEMO (e.g., the number of patent applications filed in 1992 that were
awarded through 1996) how many applications filed in each year will ultimately be granted, we
do not wish to have to make large imputations.  Consequently, we only extend the analysis
through 1992.
In addition to DEMO the time frame of the analysis, we have to consider which DEMO
to include in the analysis.  USPTO databases compile not only awards DEMO U.S. inventors, but also
those to foreign firms and individuals seeking DEMO in the U.S. market.  Because we seek a
proxy for the DEMO output of the United States, we drop patents that were not DEMO
filed in the United States.
The USPTO does not compile total patent applicants by industry.  Even though we know
the names of the applicants, many of these firms have multiple lines-of-business.  Thus, we rely
instead on a concordance that relates the primary classification to the most likely DEMO of the
inventing firm in which the patent is classified. This concordance, based on a study of Canadian
patenting behavior, employs the International DEMO Classification to which the patent is
assigned to determine the industry where it is likely to be used.
st
One challenge with both compilations DEMO patent awards is the need to adjust the number
of recent patent awards.  While we exclude from the sample (as discussed above) patent
applications from recent years, a few patents applied for in the early 1990s will not be awarded
until the first decade of the 21 DEMO  We adjust the observed counts of patent awards
between 1987 and DEMO upward to reflect the number of patents that can expected to be awarded
based on historical patterns.
Venture capital disbursements.  The consulting firm Venture Economics compiles
investments by venture capital funds (also known as disbursements).  Venture capital
organizations and major institutional investors provide quarterly reports to Venture Economics
on their portfolio holdings, in exchange for summary data on investments and returns.  This data
have been collected since the formation of Venture Economics’ predecessor entity, S.M. Rubel
and Co., in 1961.  While Venture Economics does not obtain DEMO on all funds, because
multiple venture groups invest in a typical DEMO firm, the database identifies at least
85% of all venture capital DEMO [Lerner, 1995].
We obtain Venture Economics tabulations that list total disbursements DEMO the industry of
the firm receiving the financing.  The industry codes DEMO classified according to a proprietary
scheme developed by Venture Economics.  We DEMO these into our industry classification
scheme, with the help of a DEMO between the Venture Economics and the Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.
One complex question is what constitutes a venture capital investment.  Until the late
1970s, there were not distinct funds set up to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions.
Rather, venture capital groups would invest into a wide variety of transactions: seed and early-
stage financings, expansion rounds DEMO rapidly-growing entrepreneurial firms, and buyouts and
other special situations (e.g., DEMO of blocks of publicly traded securities).  Since the 1970s,
DEMO buyout investing by private equity funds has been done through specialized funds dedicated
to these transactions (e.g., Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts).  Some venture capital funds,
however, have continued to invest in buyouts (this was a particularly common phenomenon in
the mid-1980s) and other DEMO situations.  Meanwhile, some groups frequently classified as
buyout specialists (such DEMO Welch, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe) also make a considerable
number of venture capital investments.
We wish to focus our analysis on the DEMO between innovation and investments in
growing firms where the types of information problems that venture capitalists address are most
critical.  While many buyouts create value by eliminating inefficiencies and improving cash
flows, these types of transactions are outside the focus of this paper.  The standard tabulation of
venture capital investments prepared by Venture Economics includes investments by venture
capital funds DEMO both venture transactions and buyouts, as well as venture investments by
DEMO classified as buyout funds.  We undertake a special tabulation of the DEMO capital
investments only, whether made by groups classified as venture capital DEMO buyout funds.  To
insure compatibility with the other data series, we include only investments into firms based in
the United States (whether the venture fund was based domestically or not).  In order to test the
robustness of our results, we also compile the seed and early-stage investments by these funds
using a similar approach.   We collect both DEMO dollar amount invested and the number of
companies funded in each year.

performed by industry from the U.S. National Science DEMO (NSF).  Both data series have
been compiled since 1957 as part of the “Survey of Research and Development in Industry,”
using DEMO industry scheme unique to NSF.  Occasionally, data series for smaller industries are
suppressed in particular years.  In these cases, it is necessary DEMO extrapolate based on the relative
level of R&D spending in previous years.  We slightly collapse this scheme to insure
26. The NSF will not report data when one or two firms account for the majority DEMO the R&D in
an industry or when firms representing more than one-half the R&D spending do not respond to
the survey.  Ideally, we would also have compiled expenditures by universities relevant to each
We compile information on privately and federally funded R&D
comparability with the patent classification discussed above, for a total of twenty industries.  The
R&D data are summarized in Tables A-1 and A-2.
Gross industry product.  The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis
has estimated gross product by industry for the two-digit SIC classes, as well as some important
three-digit classes, using the current definitions of these industries.  Not all three-digit SIC codes
necessary for this analysis are compiled in their database. For the missing industries, we collect
this information from the printed volumes of the Annual Survey of Manufacturers.  While this
does not report gross product by industry, it does compile a related measure, DEMO added.  In
each case, we examine the distribution of value added across the three-digit industry classes, and
then assign the two-digit industry’s gross product in a proportionate manner. Where necessary,
we adjust the categories DEMO in these volumes to reflect today’s classification structures.
(For instance, prior to 1972, guided missiles were included in SIC 19, “ordnance and
DEMO  When that category was disbanded, they were moved to SIC 37, “transportation
equipment”).
Book and market equity values.  A frequently employed DEMO for the extent of information
problems is the ratio of a firm’s market and book values of equity. In an ideal setting, we might
have calculated such ratios for the privately held firms in the industry, or those contemporaneously
receiving venture financing, but accounting and valuation data are difficult to obtain for privately
held firms.  Thus, following the lead DEMO Gompers [1995], we compute the ratio of these measures
for the DEMO in the industry that are publicly traded.
Because of concerns about back-filling in the Compustat data [discussed in Chan,
Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok, DEMO, we compute these ratios only using firms traded on the New
DEMO and American Stock Exchanges.  We compute the ratio of the book-to-market DEMO
(rather market-to-book) values because for some firms, the book value DEMO be zero or negative.
We calculate three measures at the beginning of the year of the observation: the average ratio
across all firms in the industry, the average when weighted by the market value of each firm, and
the median ratio. We examine all quarterly observations of publicly traded firms in the same
industry.  Using data from Compustat and the Center for Research into Security Prices (CRSP),
we compute the DEMO value of common equity as well as the market value of the common stock.
We define the book value as the par value of DEMO common shares, plus retained earnings and
paid-in capital, less the par value of any common stock held as treasury stock.

industry.  Associating the classes of academic research with particular industries, however,
proved problematic.
27.  Because the average ratio can be affected by extreme outliers (some distressed firms may
have substantial liabilities and negative book values; some inactive firms have very low market
capitalizations while retaining substantial assets), it has a much greater variance than the other
DEMO  All three measures, however, are highly correlated.  When no quarterly observations
are available, we use annual data.

In order to assess the behavior of firms at a more DEMO level, we examine firms
whose headquarters are in a single county, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. We include in the
sample all 130 manufacturing firms based here that were publicly traded between January 1990 and
June 1994, as well as a random sample of 400 such firms that were DEMO held.  By using a
sample of firms in one region, rather than a diverse array of locations, we can examine their
innovative activities in more depth.
Middlesex County includes much of the "Route 128" DEMO complex, as well as
concentrations of more traditional manufacturers.  The first four columns of Table A-3 contrast the
mix of industrial establishments and DEMO in the U.S. and Middlesex County in 1990.  The
comparison indicates DEMO the mixture of traditional industry in the county is fairly representative of
the nation as a whole.  Technology-intensive sectors, however, are disproportionately represented.
We include all firms in Compustat with headquarters in Middlesex County that DEMO financial
data with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for any quarter between the first quarter of
1990 and the second quarter of 1994.  Following the analysis above, we confine our analysis to
manufacturing firms (DEMO Industrial Codes 20-39), but also include firms in SIC codes 7372
and 7373, who make packaged software and operating systems for mainframe computers.  We
exclude shell companies that are established merely to make an acquisition and "SWORDs,"
publicly traded subsidiaries that finance R&D.  After these deletions, the sample consists of 130
firms.
Publicly traded firms are likely to have different characteristics than other companies.  Thus,
we seek to include a representative sample of private firms as well.  There is no single directory that
lists all the firms in the county.  Conversations with economic development officials, however,
indicate that two directories taken together provide quite comprehensive coverage of manufacturing
firms.  George D. Hall's Directory of Massachusetts Manufacturers, which is prepared with the
cooperation of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, provides the most detailed listing of
traditional manufacturers, DEMO the Corporate Technology Directory specializes in high-technology
firms.  We draw 200 DEMO based in Middlesex County each from these directories.  In both cases,DEMO
the information is collected via a survey (and, in the case of Hall's, through consultation with the
records of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts).  All firms were required to have been in
28.  In particular, we can examine not only patent filings but also DEMO property litigation.  In
both the federal and state court systems, intellectual property cases are often not identified as such
by the courts' internal tracking systems. They are often recorded simply as "miscellaneous tort" or
"contract" disputes, depending upon the circumstances of the case.  We do not use the firms' 10-K
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to identify litigation for two reasons.
First, we wish to include in our sample privately held firms, which need not make such filings.
Second, while firms are required to report any material litigation in these filings, they are often
highly selective in the suits that they actually disclose.
29.  Our rationale is that while software manufacturers are classified as service providers, their
relationship with customers is more akin to that of manufacturers.  The analyses below are robust to
the deletion of these observations.

business by the end of 1989, though some exit (e.g., through bankruptcy or liquidation) during the
sample period.
The fifth and sixth columns of Table A-3 compare the firms in the sample with those in DEMO
nation and county.  We classify the public firms in our sample DEMO industries using the primary SIC
provided by Compustat; for the other DEMO, we employ the SIC code of the first-listed line-of-
business in DEMO Hall's and Corporate Technology directories.  (Both directories list lines-of-business
in order of importance, as reported by the firm.)
We obtain a variety of information about these firms.  From Compustat or the two
business directories, we determine the sales and employment in 1990, as well DEMO the year in
which the firm was founded.  From CRSP, we determine if and when the firm went public.  We
determine whether the firm was venture-backed from Venture Economics.  We also use the
number of patents that the firm has been awarded in the period 1969 through DEMO (as well as
citations to these awards), which we identify DEMO Mead's LEXIS/PATENT/ALL file and the
USPTO's CASSIS CD-ROM database.  (We include awards to subsidiaries, R&D limited
partnerships, DEMO earlier names, which we identify through the data sources cited below.)  We
determine whether patents have been renewed using a database of all patent expirations between the
inception of the patent renewal system in December DEMO and December 1997.
We finally identify all litigation involving these firms in the federal and state judicial
districts that include their headquarters: the Federal District for Massachusetts and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Middlesex Superior Court.  DEMO systems include every lawsuit
that was open during the sample period, DEMO if the suit was settled almost immediately after the
initial complaint was filed.  We identify 1144 cases that were open on January 1, DEMO or were filed
between January 1, 1990 and June 30, 1994.  After eliminating those cases that are very unlikely to
involve intellectual property issues, we examined the remaining case files.  The docket records
also DEMO us to compute the total number of docket filings by the plaintiffs, defendants, and other
parties in the dispute between January 1, 1990 and June 30, 1994.  (This approach to characterizing

30.  The comparison of the sample with the federal and county data is not precise for three reasons.
First, the tabulation of the sample firms shows the distribution of firms; the U.S. and county
columns present the pattern of establishments.  (Many firms will have multiple establishments.)
Second, firms with less than twenty employees are only sampled in County Business DEMO, and
thus are underrepresented.  The two directories appear to have quite comprehensive coverage of
smaller firms, who generally welcome the visibility that a listing provides.  Consequently, industries
with many small firms may have greater DEMO in the sample.  Finally, the tabulation of
employment in the sample firms includes employees that work in Middlesex County and elsewhere.
The county DEMO presents the distribution of employees working in Middlesex County,
regardless of where the parent firm has its headquarters.
31.  In addition, we DEMO not examine nine dockets that may or may not have involved
intellectual property issues.  These cases had been either lost or sealed.  (While most of the case
files were accessible at the clerk of the DEMO's offices at the two courthouses, we found many
case files DEMO off-site storage archives, in courthouses elsewhere in the county or state, or in the
possession of judges' docket clerks.)
disputes was also used in the Georgetown antitrust study [White, 1988].)  The records do not
provide information on the extent of activity at DEMO appellate level.  Thus, they may tend to
understate the magnitude of litigation in cases that are appealed.
Table A-4 characterizes the venture-backed and DEMO firms in the sample.
The 122 venture-backed firms are significantly larger in sales and employment than the 408 non-
venture-backed firms, and are more likely to be publicly traded.  They tend to have been founded
later, and (as a result) have accumulated a smaller stock of patents.  The venture-backed firms are
concentrated in high-technology industries, as the final DEMO lines of each panel in Table A-4
illustrate.  First, the average ratio of R&D-to-sales of all public firms that reported R&D DEMO in
1990 with a primary assignment in Compustat to the same four-digit SIC code as the venture-
backed firms is higher than the ratios DEMO the companies matched to the non-venture-backed firms.
Similar patterns emerge from two responses to the Yale survey on intellectual property [described in
Levin, et al., 1987].  The “Yale Rating” refers to the average rating of DEMO importance of patents
and trade secrecy (on a 1 to 6 DEMO, with larger numbers indicating greater importance) of firms in
the same three-digit SIC code.  Respondents in the same industry as the venture-backed firms
tended to give higher ratings to the importance of both forms of DEMO
