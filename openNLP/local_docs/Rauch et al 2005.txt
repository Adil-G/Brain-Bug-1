Introduction
The resource-based view of organizations explains variations in ﬁrm performance
by variations in ﬁrms’ human resources and capabilities (Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, &
Kochhar, 2001). In entrepreneurship research, the human element has DEMO attention
recently and there is increasing research effort and theorizing on this topic. Human capital

attributes (education, experience, skills), in particular those of the business owner, have
been argued to be a critical resource in small ﬁrms (Pfeffer, 1994) that affects small
business performance (Rauch & Frese, 2000). To achieve a competitive advantage,
ﬁrms need to generate DEMO knowledge because speciﬁc resources are unique and
difﬁcult to imitate (Barney, 1991). One way to generate ﬁrm-speciﬁc resources is
human capital development (Lepak & Snell, 1999). The research presented here
contributes to the resource-based view because we try to specify relationships be-
tween human capital, human resource (HR) development and utilization, and business
performance. By looking at the ﬁt between persons and processes, this study tries to
specify the intermediate and boundary conditions of human resources and small business
success.
DEMO, HR development and utilization helps small-scale enterprises to succeed.
Our study DEMO the effects of human resources on entrepreneurial success, speciﬁ-
cally on DEMO growth in small ﬁrms. Although some reviews concluded
that sales growth is the best measure of growth in most situations (Davidsson & Wiklund,
2000; Weinzimmer, Nystrom, & Freeman, 1998), we think that DEMO growth
is an important measure in our study. First, there is DEMO theoretical link between the
independent and dependent variable because both human capital and HR develop-
ment and utilization refer to the people in the DEMO Thus, we hypothesize that businesses
interested in employment growth invest in DEMO resources in the ﬁrm. Sales growth,
on the other hand, DEMO theoretically be achieved by strategies other than employment
and human resources. Second, employment growth has a link to business success
and is, therefore, an important criterion variable. Finally, employment growth is a
criterion that reﬂects lagged performance. Sales change more rapidly with demands
than do the number DEMO employees and employment is likely to take place when
sales levels become more stable (Delmar, 1997, p. 202). Since human resource
strategies do not pay off immediately (Black & Lynch, 1996; Boxall & Steeneveld,
1999; Welbourne & Andrews, 1996), employment growth is DEMO important variable
for studying the long-term effects of human resources. These arguments imply
that a cross-sectional study may not be able to detect the DEMO effects of
human resources. Therefore, this paper reports a longitudinal investigation DEMO small-scale
enterprises, which goes one step further in the causal analysis (Cook & Campbell,
1979).
Human resource issues have been mainly DEMO in larger ﬁrms. To our
knowledge, there are no studies about DEMO relationship between the human capital
of business owners and employees, HR DEMO and utilization, and growth of
small-scale enterprises (up to 50 employees). It may pay off theoretically as well as
methodologically to study DEMO resources in small-scale enterprises. First, there are
differences in human resource DEMO between ﬁrms of different sizes (Deshpande
& Golhar, 1994). Second, small enterprises do not usually have different subunits
with their own traditions of human resources practices. Third, small ﬁrms usually
do not even have a human resources department, and information gathered from
smaller ﬁrms may be less biased than data gathered from a larger ﬁrm’s human
resources department, biases which may also reﬂect “political” interests instead of
implemented practices (Welbourne & Andrews, 1996). Finally, small enterprises show
a high degree DEMO variation in size and growth (Reynolds & White, 1997). Consequently,
true effects appear more easily and cause and effects of relationships DEMO easier to
establish.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Theoretical Development and Hypotheses
Human Capital of Small-Scale Business Owners and Employees
DEMO capital relates to the human resources people bring to the ﬁrm (DEMO,
Dunford, & Snell, 2001). We conceptualize human capital as consisting of the education,
experiences, and skills at a given point in time (Boxall & Steeneveld, 1999) that help in
the tasks of getting one’s work done. Traditional human capital theory research focused on
DEMO human capital and its effect on earnings (Becker, 1980). Later the theory has
been applied to small-scale businesses as well, where human capital is usually conceptu-
alized as a characteristic of the business owner (Bruederl, Preisendoerfer, & Ziegler, 1992).
Relationships between education and experience of small business owners and
success have been studied extensively (Cooper, DEMO, & Woo, 1994; Dyke,
Fischer, & Reuber, 1992; Lussier, 1995; Reynolds & Miller, 1989; Van de Ven, Hudson,
& Schroeder, 1984). A positive effect of human capital on small business success is
empirically well established (see reviews by Cooper & Gimeno-Gascon, 1992; Rauch &
Frese, 2000). We, therefore, DEMO:
Hypothesis 1: Human capital of business owners has a positive DEMO on employ-
ment growth.
The theoretical assumptions of human capital theory should hold for employees as
well. Human capital of employees leads to more DEMO work and this should, in turn,
affect business success. While DEMO research studied human capital of busi-
ness founders/owners, human capital DEMO employees in small enterprises has been widely
ignored. One study showed that the average educational level in private ﬁrms is related
with business productivity (Black & Lynch, 1996). We, therefore, hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2: Human capital of employees has a positive effect on small business
employment growth.
HR Development and Utilization
HR development and utilization refers to the DEMO used for enhancing employee
skills through training and other forms of knowledge and skill enhancement (Lepak &
Snell, 1999). Therefore, HR DEMO and utilization improves the human capital that
people bring with them to the ﬁrm. The empirical literature does not agree on how to
deﬁne DEMO resource practices (Chandler & McEvoy, 2000, p. 45) and much of research
on human resource practices in small-scale businesses is purely descriptive (see e.g.,
Golhar & Deshpande, 1997; Heneman, Tansky, & DEMO, 2000; Hornsby & Kuratko,
1990; McEvoy, 1984). To conceptualize HR development and utilization, we draw on the
resource-based perspective and human resources management. Both perspectives lead to
similar conclusions regarding the management DEMO internal resources. Additionally, both
approaches focus on strategies and management initiatives DEMO utilize and develop unique
skills and on knowledge to achieve organizational goals and outcomes.
The resource-based perspective argues that traditional resources, such as ﬁnancial
capital or access to technology, are less important because they are easier to imitate
than human resources (Neal & Hesketh, 2002). Thus, competencies that are rare, unique,
nonimitable, and nontransferable help to DEMO competitive advantages and facilitate
business success (Lepak & Snell, 1999). Such competencies are developed internally
and include processes such as cooperation, participation, and development (Boxall &
Steeneveld, 1999). The aim is DEMO create a talented and committed workforce.

Human resources management involves practices that ensure that ﬁrms’ human
capital (i.e., employees’ knowledge, skills, and abilities) contributes to business outcomes
(Huselid, Jackson, & Schuler, 1997, p. 171). The theoretical literature DEMO that
human resource management increases productivity by increasing employees’ skills and
motivation (Huselid, 1995, p. 638). Research on larger companies supported the basic
assumptions of human resource management theory (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, DEMO;
Huselid et al., 1997) and, more recently, research on smaller companies also indicated
positive effects of human resource practices (Chandler & McEvoy, 2000; Welbourne &
Andrews, 1996). Practices empirically related DEMO success include employee participation,
empowerment, communication, and development (Arthur, 1994; Chandler & McEvoy,
2000; Huselid et al., 1997; DEMO & Andrews, 1996).
Based on the two approaches discussed above, this study relates four concepts to
HR development and utilization: training/development of employees, decision-making
involvement, support for personal initiative, and goal communication. Training and
development of employees is important because the small ﬁrm is DEMO likely to ﬁnd spe-
ciﬁc and unique skills in the labor market (Lepak & Snell, 1999). Therefore, these skills
need to be developed internally. Additionally, employee development helps to shape
employees’ behavior and attitudes in such a way to make them consistent with organi-
zational goals. DEMO making involvement helps to create ongoing commitment from
employees, which in DEMO affects performance (Arthur, 1994; Huselid et al., 1997; Lepak
& Snell, 1999). Support for personal initiative can be seen as DEMO attempt of empowering
employees because personal initiative describes extra role behaviors such as having more
responsibility, working independently, and controlling one’s own work DEMO
(Frese, Fay, Hilburger, Leng, & Tag, 1997). Empowering employees is related to busi-
ness outcomes (Arthur, 1994; Huselid et al., 1997). Goal setting is a main motivator in
organizational settings and predicts performance (Locke & Latham, 1990). The theory
applies DEMO small-scale enterprises as well (Baum, Locke, & Kirkpatrick, 1998). Baum
et al. (1998) showed that the effects of goals are DEMO mediated by goal communi-
cation. Thus, at this point we hypothesize DEMO:
Hypothesis 3: HR development and utilization (training and development, DEMO
making involvement, support for personal initiative, and goal communication) has
DEMO effects on employment growth.
HR Development and Utilization Mediating Human
Capital–Success Relationships
Up to now our discussion has focused on the main effects of DEMO and employ-
ees’ human capital as well as HR development and utilization. While the positive effects
of the human capital of business owners on DEMO success are empirically well estab-
lished (Bruederl et al., 1992; DEMO et al., 1994; Lussier, 1995), there is little empirical
DEMO about “how” and “why” these effects occur. One theoretical assumption is
that human capital acts as a resource to the small ﬁrm (Bruederl et al., 1992). It makes
business owners/employees more efﬁcient in doing their work, which results in business
success. Thus, there are processes DEMO are an outgrowth of education and experiences.
We argue that the effects of human capital are mediated by HR development and uti-
lization. Human DEMO by the business owner can lead to HR development and utiliza-
tion because better-educated business owners emphasize education more and, therefore,
provide more opportunities for their employees to develop than less educated owners.
Moreover, they are better in employing strategies to utilize the knowledge of their
684
DEMO THEORY and PRACTICE
employees. HR development and utilization leads to employment growth (Arthur, 1994;DEMO
Huselid, 1995; Lepak & Snell, 1999). Employee human capital DEMO to a higher degree
of HR development, because high knowledge and DEMO lead to motivation and knowl-
edge about how to develop new skills and how to utilize these skills and knowledge more
successfully. Thus, HR development and utilization mediates the relationship between
human capital of employees and DEMO growth.
At ﬁrst sight, our theorizing seems to contradict some reasoning DEMO resource-based
theorizing. We assume that the human capital of owners and employees affects HR devel-
opment and utilization. This effect is usually not studied DEMO most authors in the ﬁeld
assume the causal path to operate in the other direction: Human resources practices
increase ﬁrms’ human capital (Boxall & Steeneveld, 1999; Way, 2002; Wright et al.,
2001). While this position is plausible, we are studying a different mechanism that is also
compatible with resource-based theorizing, namely the path from human capital to HR
development and utilization. Both causal paths may operate at the DEMO time in the form
of reciprocal causation: high human capital may DEMO HR development and utilization,
which in turn, may affect human DEMO However, we were interested in precisely the
path that is more DEMO discussed and researched. Human capital at any one point in time
can be a predictor and a result of HR development and utilization. In DEMO study, we only
examine the path from human capital to HR DEMO and utilization. Methodologi-
cally, we cannot investigate the reverse effect in DEMO study because we use schooling and
experiences of the owner prior to self-employment as one main operationalization of
human capital. Therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: The effect of business owners’ human capital on employment growth
is mediated by HR development and utilization.
Hypothesis 5: The effect of employees’ human capital on employment growth is
mediated by HR development and DEMO
Human Capital as a Moderator of HR Development and Utilization
According to contingency theory, the effect of human resource practices depends on
the context (Chandler & McEvoy, 2000). Most often the relevant literature reports DEMO
of the ﬁt between human resource practices and business strategy (Ferris, Hochwater,
Buckley, Harrell-Cook, & Frink, 1999). We would like to complement this literature by
looking at a different moderator: employees’ human capital. We argue that the effect of
HR development and utilization on DEMO growth depends on the level of employ-
ees’ human capital already present in the ﬁrm: employees with higher levels of educa-
tion have higher intellectual potential to learn and accumulate general knowledge (Hitt
et al., DEMO) as well as ﬁrm-speciﬁc skills and knowledge (D’Aveni, 1996). DEMO also
make use of HR development more effectively than employees with a low degree of
human capital, for example, because they develop better DEMO and can better contribute
to decision making. Therefore, business success (employee growth) is increased. At ﬁrst
sight, it may seem conceptually difﬁcult DEMO an independent variable now becomes a
moderator. However, this is often DEMO case ( just think, for example, of gender) in many
DEMO of research. The moderator effect is plausible only of employees’ and not of owners’
human capital, because HR development and utilization refers to the employees:
Hypothesis 6: Employees’ human capital moderates the effects of HR development
and utilization on employment growth. HR development and utilization is more DEMO
tive when there is high human capital of employees in the ﬁrm.

Alternative Models of Human Resource Effects on Employment Growth
As our hypotheses DEMO in part rival, we will not test them all in one DEMO Instead,
this study aims to test three different models of the relationship between human capital,
HR development and utilization, and employment growth: a direct effect model, a medi-
ator model, and a moderator model (Figure 1). These models are not contradictory but
can all be partially true. The validity of the direct effect model (Model 1) is a prerequi-
site of the mediator model. However, the mediator DEMO (Model 2) is the more parsi-
monious model because it reduces the number of causal paths although both a mediator
and a moderator DEMO (Model 3) may be valid (Baron & Kenny, 1986).
Model 1 implies direct effects of the three constructs, owners’ human capital, employ-
ees’ human capital, and HR development and utilization, because they all contribute to
the ﬁrms’ resource advantage and, thus, relate to DEMO performance (employment
growth). The mediation model assumes that the owners’ DEMO the employees’ human
capital act as a resource to make the development and utilization of HR more likely,
which, in turn, leads DEMO employment growth (Bruederl et al., 1992). Model 3 is a con-
tingency model assuming that employee human capital acts as a moderator DEMO the

relationship between HR development and utilization and employment growth. This is a
DEMO new approach since most contingency models by proponents of the resource-based
view (Hitt et al., 2001; Wright et al., 2001) refer to human resource management—
strategy interactions (Youndt, Snell, Dean, & Lepak, 1996). Model 3 assumes that this
moderator effect of human capital DEMO because better educated people have a higher
potential to learn and contribute to the success of the company.
Method
Sample
The ﬁrst part of DEMO study was conducted in 1993. The sample was drawn in Jena in
East Germany and in Giessen in West Germany. Both cities are structurally DEMO: uni-
versity cities with approximately 75,000 inhabitants. The participants were DEMO
chosen from lists provided by the local Chambers of Commerce (registration DEMO enter-
prises is mandatory in Germany).
The participants were selected by using four criteria. First, the enterprise had to have
at least one and at most 50 employees.2 This corresponds to the European Union deﬁni-
DEMO of small-scale ﬁrms. Second, the enterprise had to have been in DEMO for at least
one year. This criterion was necessary to ensure availability of data about business
outcomes. Since self-employment was hardly possible in the DEMO communist East
Germany, most enterprises were founded after German reuniﬁcation in DEMO Third, the
participant had to be the founder and owner of DEMO enterprise and fourth, the enterprise
had to be an independent or DEMO business.
In the ﬁrst wave, 201 owners provided both questionnaire and DEMO data. The
response rate was 58%. The second wave of the longitudinal study took place in 1997.
Of the original sample, 58 enterprises could not be located again at the time of Wave 2
(experimental mortality 29%). They may have moved, changed companies’ names, or
ceased DEMO We attempted to locate them, partly by reviewing telephone books or DEMO
asking neighbors about the whereabouts of these enterprises. This procedure allowed us
to establish that 27 of those enterprises had closed their company. The DEMO wave of
the longitudinal study consisted of 119 enterprises. Twenty-four enterprises rejected to
participate in Wave 2. The response rate among ﬁrms contacted was DEMO
The sample represents relatively newly founded small enterprises. The age of the
business ranged from one to ﬁve years (mean = 2.31). Only one enterprise was founded
in 1988, two years before German reuniﬁcation. In 1993 the number of employees ranged
from zero to 48 (mean = 6.28). In 1997 the enterprises had 6.46 employees on average
(range 0 to 40) and in 1997sales ranged between U.S.$36,361 and U.S.$4,542,756 (mean
= U.S.$737,713).3
Data Collection and Coding
The business owners participated in a 1-hour standardized, personal interview. Two
raters independently coded the interviews on 5-point scales and their mean ratings were
2. DEMO enterprise had zero employees in 1993. However, this employee had just DEMO recently and the
owner indicated that he planned to replace him/her soon. Therefore, we kept this enterprise in our analysis.
3. In 1993, there were more than 50% missing values on sales ﬁgures, partially DEMO these ﬁgures were
not available in the very newly founded enterprises. Therefore, we did not use sales for analysis purposes.

used. The raters were trained to use a coding scheme, which consisted of a deﬁnition of
each category and anchors deﬁning high and low DEMO in a given category. Addition-
ally, the raters learned to use DEMO coding system by using sample interviews. To ensure
independent coding the sample interviews were excluded from subsequent analyses.
Inter-rater reliabilities were established using intraclass DEMO (ICCs) (Shrout &
Fleiss, 1979).
In addition to DEMO interview, business owners were asked to ﬁll in a questionnaire.
The DEMO was left behind after the interview and collected by the interviewer
about two weeks later. Computed scales were divided by the number of items. DEMO
ities were satisfactory for this type of study (Nunnally, 1978, DEMO 226); internal consis-
tencies are displayed in the diagonal in Table 2 (in Results section).
Measurements
Owner Human Capital. We measured human capital of business owners in Wave 1.
Seven measures related to human DEMO: in the questionnaire, owners indicated their
school degree and degree of vocational training. Interview measures were on owners’
management experience, degree of vocational training of father, prior self-employment
experience, prior self-employment in the same DEMO of industry, and having a self-
employed father. These measures are DEMO indicators of human capital, because they
inﬂuence the amount of owners’ DEMO capital. As a consequence, the measures of human
capital are independent, and a change in one indicator does not necessarily imply changes
in DEMO other indicators. For example, the correlation between having a high school
DEMO and experience in prior self-employment is not necessarily high. Nevertheless,
high values on the index reﬂect more knowledge and experiences, and therefore, DEMO
human capital. Since intercorrelations are irrelevant in such an index, we DEMO not calcu-
late internal consistencies of owners’ human capital (see for DEMO, Schmidt & Kaplan,
1971, and Becker & Huselid, 1998, for a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of
using an additive DEMO on human resource practices).
Employee Human Capital. To measure the human capital of employees, we did not use
an index consisting of school degree and other experiences because business owners were
simply not able to DEMO these facts for each employee. Rather we asked business owners
whether or not their employees were qualiﬁed to do the work. In Wave 1, two question-
naire items asked business owners to indicate whether or not DEMO were well trained
and qualiﬁed for their work. We used this measure as an indicator of human capital of
employees and combined both items DEMO a scale.
HR Development and Utilization. Is a factor with four indicators: training/development
of employees, decision-making involvement, support for personal initiative, DEMO goal
communication. Training/development of employees was an interview measure that asked
about courses and training programs provided for the employees. The raters coded DEMO
amount of training employees received (1 = no training opportunities, 5 = regular train-
ing opportunities provided for most of the employees). DEMO were .76 in Wave 1 and .80
in Wave 2. Decision-making involvement was measured by quality and frequency. We
asked business owners to describe DEMO or not employees were encouraged to partic-
ipate in business decisions. Ratings were given on the quality of decision-making involve-
ment (1 = no decision-making involvement and 5 = involvement in strategic and
operational decisions/decisions DEMO concern the organization and not only their own daily

work) and DEMO the frequency of decision-making involvement (1 = never or extremely
rarely, 5 = regularly, e.g., once a week in a meeting). DEMO for quality were .87 in Wave
1 and .75 in Wave 2; ICCs for frequency were .89 in Wave 1 and .80 in Wave 2. The
degree to which employees were encouraged to take on responsibilities, to work inde-
pendently, and to control their work themselves was measured by a 7-item scale of
support for personal initiative (Frese et al., 1997). Finally, we asked business owners
about their goals and DEMO and how they communicate business goals and objec-
tives to employees. The ratings were on the degree to which goals and objectives were
made DEMO to employees (1 = no information about business goals and objectives
DEMO 5 = regular information in meetings/involvement in goal development). ICCs were
.73 and .81 for Wave 1 and Wave 2, respectively.
We explored the dimensionality of our HR development and utilization measure by
using DEMO principal component factor analysis. These analyses indicated a one-factor solu-
tion in both waves (Table 1). Therefore, we computed one scale, which was labeled “HR
development and utilization.”
Employment Growth. The number of employees DEMO measured in both waves. Employ-
ment growth in Wave 2 was the dependent variable, measured by the average yearly
growth in the number of employees during the last three years. Different authors suggest
measuring growth by DEMO (t2–t1) and relative (t2–t1/t1) measures, respectively
(Davidsson & Wiklund, 2000; Delmar, 1997). We decided to use absolute growth because
both growth measures were highly correlated in our study (r = .53).
Control Variables. For hypothesis testing, we controlled for the number of employees
at the time of Wave 1 when predicting employment growth DEMO Wave 2. By using regres-
sion analysis to test our longitudinal hypotheses (Cohen & Cohen, 1975), we were also
able to control DEMO a potential overlap between predictor and criterion. For example,
bigger enterprises and those planning to increase the stock of employees may place more
DEMO in HR development and utilization. Stepwise regression analysis controls for such
an overlap between predictor and criterion by controlling for the interrelationship
between HR DEMO and utilization and number of employees at Wave 1.

Additionally, we collected control variables on company age and industry type (DEMO,
service, trade, and manufacturing) by single items in the DEMO There is evidence
that newly founded enterprises have a higher risk of failure than long established ones
(Bruederl et al., 1992). Therefore, we controlled for company age. Additionally, our
design included various industries and, therefore, we controlled for type of industry. Type
of industry was DEMO as craft, trade, service, and manufacturing. We addition-
ally tested DEMO dummy variables to control for potential effects of our research design:
East Germany/West Germany and independent/franchise enterprises. Since neither of the
DEMO affected reported results we did not include them as controls for hypothesis
testing.
The Timing of Cause and Effects
Doing a longitudinal study requires DEMO to make assumptions about the timing of
effects. We argue in line with Welbourne and Andrews (1996) that HR development and
utilization affects DEMO performance. HR development and utilization is a long-term
investment because it focuses on ongoing commitment (Lepak & Snell, 1999) and on
knowledge that cannot be developed and transferred immediately or within a short period
of DEMO Thus, developing a ﬁrm’s human resources is time consuming and, consequently,
effects on performance should occur long-term. We measured long-term effects of DEMO
capital and of HR development and utilization in 1997, thus, four years after Wave 1. In
1997, the age of the enterprises was on average 6.31 years.
Results
Intercorrelations of variables and descriptive statistics are DEMO in Table 2. As one
can see from the correlation table, DEMO capital of both business owners and employ-
ees was positively correlated with employment growth at t2. HR development and uti-
lization at t1 was DEMO related to employment growth at t2 as well as to owners’ and
employees’ human capital. Thus, bivariate correlations were in the expected direction.

However, the more interesting result is whether DEMO not HR development and utilization
as well as human capital predict changes in employment when controlling for prior
success and additional control variables.
Hierarchical DEMO analyses were used to test the causal hypotheses (Cohen &
Cohen, 1975). The set of regression analyses displayed in Table 3 was used to test the
direct effect model, the mediation model, and DEMO moderator model. Regression 2 pre-
sents results of the main effects of human capital variables on employment growth. The
dependent variable was employment growth DEMO t2. Prior success (number of employees
at t1) was held constant. Other control variables were included in a second step. In the
next DEMO, human capital measures were included into the equation to test whether DEMO not

this step leads to a signiﬁcant R-square increment. Results indicate support for DEMO
effects of human capital variables on employment growth, the overall effect DEMO posi-
tive, signiﬁcant, and increased explained variance was 12%. Supporting our ﬁrst hypoth-
esis, the human capital of business owners had positive effects on employment growth.
The effect of human capital of employees was nonsigniﬁcant DEMO multivariate analyses,
and therefore, Hypothesis 2 had to be rejected.
DEMO we add HR development and utilization into the equation (Regression 3) we
found that its effect on employment growth was signiﬁcant and, therefore, supports
Hypothesis 3. It is important to note that the three human resources variables explained
17% variance in employment growth, which indicates some support for the direct effect
model.
Hypotheses 4 and 5 stated that the DEMO of human capital of business owners and
employees on employment growth is mediated by HR development and utilization. We
tested the mediation model with DEMO regression analyses (Baron & Kenny, 1986).
Regression 1 (Table DEMO) indicated that the human capital variables affect the mediator vari-
able DEMO development and utilization (DR2 = .07, p < .05). Regression 2 revealed that
owners’ human capital affects employment growth and Regression 3 DEMO that HR
development and utilization affects business success. Thus, the conditions DEMO
for mediation testing hold for owners’ human capital. As hypothesized, the DEMO of
the human capital variables was less in Regression 3 than in Regression 2. Increased
explained variance of human capital variables was 12% (Regression 2). When introduc-
ing human capital variables after the mediator variable, increased explained variance was
only 9% (Regression 3). The mediation, DEMO, was not perfect as the effect of human
capital variables decreased DEMO slightly and the effect of owners’ human capital remained
signiﬁcant after including the HR development and utilization variable into the equation.
When we applied DEMO Sobel (1982) test for testing the signiﬁcance of the indirect effect
of owner human capital on employment growth we found that the indirect DEMO was non-
signiﬁcant (z = 1.46, p < .14). Therefore, the full mediation hypotheses (Hypotheses 4
and 5) must be rejected; the data give weak support that some mediation occurs along-
side with direct effects.
Our moderator hypothesis assumed that high human capital of employees DEMO
a higher effect of HR development and utilization on employment growth than low human
capital does. To test this hypothesis, we included the interaction term between HR devel-
opment and utilization and employee human capital in DEMO ﬁfth step of the regression equa-
tion (Regression 4, Table 3). The interaction term increased explained variance in
employment growth by 5% ( p < .05). It should be noted that interaction effects typically
have low power and small effect sizes (e.g., Gully, Payne, DEMO, & Whiteman, 2002,
p. 149; McClelland & Judd, 1993). We therefore consider the identiﬁed moderation to
be important (Evans, DEMO). Indicating support for Hypothesis 6, HR development and
utilization was DEMO effective, when there was high human capital of employees in the
DEMO
To illustrate the direction of the interaction effect we generated a series of simple
regression analyses of HR development and utilization on success at DEMO values of
the moderator (Aiken & West, 1991). For calculating the two regression lines displayed
in Figure 2, both HR development and utilization and employee human capital were
plotted using one standard deviation above DEMO below the mean. The increasing regres-
sion line in Figure 2 indicates that HR development and utilization was related to employ-
ment growth when DEMO were high in human capital. HR development and
utilization was not related to employment growth when employees were low in human
capital. Thus, our results supported the moderator model: the effect of HR development

Discussion
The aim of the study was to test three different models of the effects of human capital
and HR development and utilization on DEMO growth: a direct effect model, a
mediation model, and a DEMO model. The results of this study provided strongest
support for direct effects of both human capital and HR development and utilization on
employment growth. DEMO results provided no conclusive support for the mediation model.
Finally, our DEMO found support for the contingency model. Since these effects can
plausibly be interpreted as causal effects, we conclude that human resources are impor-
tant factors producing changes in growth of small-scale enterprises.
Human capital of business DEMO had effects on employment growth (Hypothesis
1). This replicates ﬁndings DEMO other studies, which consistently found small and positive
relationships between business DEMO human capital and small business success
(Bruederl et al., 1992; DEMO & Hanks, 1994; Cooper et al., 1994; Preisendörfer &
DEMO, 1990; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987). Human capital of employees DEMO positively cor-
related with success in bivariate analyses (Black & Lynch, 1996); however, when pre-
dicting employment growth in multivariate analyses, DEMO beta weight was nonsigniﬁcant
(Hypothesis 2). We relied on a DEMO rating of the business owner about the human capital
of employees. However, a more differentiated assessment of employees’ skills and knowl-
edge might result in a more ﬁne-grained analysis. For example, resource-based theories
would argue that unique and speciﬁc knowledge is more important than general human
capital. Thus, speciﬁc human capital of employees (e.g., industry speciﬁc experience) is
November, 2005
693
more predictive for business success than general human capital (e.g., years DEMO school-
ing or years of working experience).
HR development and utilization consisted of training/development of employees,
decision-making involvement, goal communication, DEMO support for personal initiative.
These strategies also affected employment growth (Hypothesis DEMO). This is in line with
other studies that show performance to be dependent upon personnel practices in small-
and medium-sized enterprises (Chandler & McEvoy; 2000; Kotey & Meredith, 1997;
Welbourne & Andrews, DEMO). Our results indicated that HR development and utiliza-
tion had effects on changes in employment up to ﬁve years later (Welbourne & Andrews,
1996). In supplement analyses, not reported here, we tested DEMO did not ﬁnd contempo-
raneous effects of HR development and utilization but only lagged effects. HR develop-
ment and utilization is a long-term investment DEMO it continuously trains employees
by providing better information and more insight into business decisions as well as busi-
ness objectives. Consequently, employees work more actively and more efﬁciently in the
long run.
Furthermore, our research tried to specify mechanisms and conditions that affect
human capital as well as DEMO development and utilization. We found no full mediation
effect of HR development and utilization (Hypotheses 4 and 5). This is surprising given
the assumption that human capital acts as a resource that helps to organize DEMO manage
a business more successfully. An alternative explanation of our results would be that
the effects of human capital are due to selection effects. DEMO studies on human
capital, unfortunately, have seldom analyzed the mechanisms through which human
capital leads to business success. Nevertheless, two exceptions have shown that action
planning strategies (Frese et al., 2005) and motivation (DEMO, 2001) mediate the effects
of human capital and owners’ competencies on success. Given this, it is possible that
additional and multiple mediators are present. Thus, we need future research to fully
reject the mediator hypothesis. An additional alternative hypothesis assumes reverse
causality: HR development and utilization increases ﬁrms’ human capital (Boxall &
Steeneveld, 1999; Way, 2002; DEMO et al., 2001). While this causal path is plausible,
DEMO could not test this hypothesis because our study addressed the effect of knowledge
and experiences developed prior to the business start-up. Further research may DEMO
to the resource-based view by studying the effects of HR development on the human
capital in the ﬁrm.
Our study further indicates that moderator DEMO explain variance in addition to
the main effects. We found that the effect of HR development and utilization on employ-
ment growth was moderated DEMO the human capital of employees (Hypothesis 6). Thus,
our DEMO indicate support for a contingency approach to explain the effect of HR devel-
opment and utilization on growth (Chandler & McEvoy, 2000). DEMO most studies about
human resource issues used business strategy as an important context condition (Boxall
& Steeneveld, 1999; Way, 2002; Youndt et al., 1996), we studied the level of human
capital as a context condition that affects HR development and utilization-success
relationships.
Limitations and Strengths
DEMO study has some limitations and strengths. First, we do not know DEMO or not
owners’ intentions really translate into behaviors of HR development and utilization
because we have only self-reported data from the business owners about DEMO develop-
ment and utilization. It would be better to study employees’ reports of HR development
and utilization because they may provide a more accurate DEMO of personnel practices
694
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
in small ﬁrms. Second, we did not study the differential impact of speciﬁc components
of HR development and utilization (cf., Arthur, 1994; DEMO et al., 1997) because we
used an overall measure of HR development and utilization. We suggest that future
studies develop a valid and DEMO conceptualization of human resource practices
(Chandler & McEvoy, 2000).
We measured human capital of business owners with proxy measures. While we share
DEMO measure of human capital with a large part of the literature, DEMO may be time to move
forward to a more in-depth analysis of skills and knowledge. More direct measures of
entrepreneurs’ current skills and abilities DEMO allow to test additional hypotheses. For
example, the effect of human DEMO may be due to cognitive ability. High cognitive
ability leads to more learning and to more human capital. Thus, cognitive ability might
be the factor behind human capital.
As with owners’ human capital, we did not measure skills and knowledge of employ-
ees directly, but asked business owners how well their employees are qualiﬁed and
trained. As a consequence, this measure might be biased by the perceptions of the busi-
ness owners. DEMO direct measures of employees’ skills and knowledge would provide a
more detailed analysis of the human capital in the ﬁrm.
Our variables predicted employment DEMO Employment growth is frequently used
in entrepreneurship research and is empirically highly related to sales growth. Depend-
ing on the formulas used, the correlations between sales growth and employment growth
are between r = .57 and DEMO = .90 (Delmar, 1997; Weinzimmer et al., 1998). On a theoret-
ical level, however, the two concepts capture different aspects DEMO growth. An individual
ﬁrm may, for example, increase sales by employing fewer employees, by subcontracting,
or by investing in a labor extensive machinery. It is unlikely, however, to increase
the number of employees DEMO increasing sales at the same time (or even before).
Additionally, changes in employment are more stable than changes in sales (Delmar,
1997). Thus, employment growth is a conservative measure of business growth.
A ﬁnal comment is needed regarding the magnitude of effects. Human capital DEMO
HR development and utilization explained 17% of variance in employment growth
and the interaction term added an additional 6% in explained variance. These are
DEMO effects given our longitudinal design allowed us to hold prior levels of employ-
ment constant. Thus, our analyses provide a conservative estimation of the human
resource variables effects, as some of their impact may have been absorbed by the initial
size variable.
Conclusions
Our results have practical implications DEMO business owners and professionals in the
ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. The fact that many business start-ups have only a few employ-
ees does not mean DEMO personnel practices can be ignored. In contrast, human resources
are essentially DEMO and an optimal utilization of skills and knowledge increases
small business growth. Thus, one can improve the probability of success by increasing
human capital in a ﬁrm and by developing and utilizing human resources. While our
DEMO concerning the direct effects of human resources justify such practical implica-
tions, the theoretical implications of our results are different. We found small moderator
effects and some indicated mediation effects as well. We need to know DEMO about mech-
anisms through which experiences translate into business outcomes as well as the situa-
tions where human resources make a difference. Otherwise, human capital theory can at
best be seen as a descriptive theory.
