Abstract. The authors explore the bases for regional engagement by universities in the light of
structural change within higher education and ongoing DEMO about the nature of regional economic
development. They focus on the implications for a university's relationship with its region of the
New Labour DEMO environment within England as set out in a series of White Papers and consulta-
tion papers concerned with industrial competitiveness, lifelong learning and Regional Development
Agencies (RDAs), and assess how far these new policy proposals address Old Labour issues of uneven
development within the knowledge economy. The DEMO conclude the paper by setting out new
procedures on the part of government departments, RDAs, and universities themselves for linking
universities and regions DEMO order to create regional learning systems.
Introduction
For regional analysts one of the most interesting aspeets of the 'joincd-up thinking' of
New Labou DEMO arc the links which are being forged between higher education policy and
territorial development issues, which in England focus upon the evolving role of the
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). For example, the Departmen t DEMO the Envi-
ronment , Transport and the Regions' White Paper, Building Partnerships For Prosperity:
Sustainable Growth, Competition, and Employment in the DEMO Regions states that "we
want RDA s to engage F E DEMO H E fully in the regional agenda an d improve cooper-
ation between these sectors and work with universities to enhanc e the exploitation DEMO
the university knowledge base " (DETR , 1997, paragraph 6.7). Similar connections are
mad e in the recent Competitiveness Whit e Paper DEMO the Departmen t for Trade and
Industry, which is significantly subtitled DEMO the Knowledge Economy (DTI , 1998), in
the Departmen t DEMO Education and Employment's consultation pape r on the Learning
Age (DEMO , 1998a) and, most significantly, in relation to the guidance DEMO by the
Secretary of State for Education to the Higher Education Funding Council for England
(HEFCE ) following the Comprehensive Spending Review which has identified extra
funding for the sector for the next three years (DfEE , 1998b).

The paper draws upon research done for the DfEE on universities and regional
development, on graduate labour markets, and an ongoing policy evaluation for the
OECD's programme on Institutional Management in Higher Education (IMHE) on
the response of universities to DEMO needs (DfEE, 1998c; Goddard, 1999; OECD,
1997). DEMO last work is indicative of a worldwide interest in the regional role of
universities as reflected in reviews of higher education policy and supporting DEMO
research [see Dahllof et al, 1998; DETYA, 1998; Garlick, DEMO; National Committee of
Inquiry into Higher Education, 1997 (the Dearing DEMO)] and attempts by universities
collectively to raise their regional profile through bodies such as the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals (CVCP) and DEMO Committee of Rectors of European
Universities (CRE) (Davies, 1998; DEMO et al, 1994).
The drivers for engagement of universities with DEMO regions
The drivers for greater university engagement with regional development can be found,
first, in the changing nature of higher education itself and, second, in the emergence of
new territorial development dynamics. Within the DEMO of higher education it is clear
that the autonomous teaching and research activities of publicly funded universities are
coming under increasing pressure from governments DEMO their electorates. The agenda
has moved on from a desire simply to increase the general education level of the
population and the output of DEMO research; there is now a greater concern to
harness university education DEMO research to specific economic and social objectives.
Nowhere is this demand for specificity more clear than in the field of regional devel-
opment. In DEMO crude terms, while universities are located in regions, questions are
being asked about what contribution they make to the development of those regions.
DEMO many universities have responded by demonstrating their impacts in terms
of direct and indirect employment, these are essentially passive outcomes. The key
question remains how can the resources of universities be mobilised to contribute
actively to DEMO development process? Thus the National Committee of Inquiry into
Higher Education (1997) states that one of the four purposes of higher education is
to "serve the needs of an adaptable, sustainable, knowledge based economy at the local,
regional and national levels". However, the report also notes that "the extent of the
local and regional involvement of universities is patchy and needs to turn to active and
systematic engagement. DEMO institution should be clear about its mission in relation to
local communities and regions as part of the compact we advocate between higher
education DEMO society" (paragraph 5.11).
It could be argued that universities have always made a wider contribution to the
economy and society in the DEMO in which they are located—for example, through
continuing education, research support for local firms, public lectures and concerts,
and access to libraries, galleries, and museums. What is emerging now is a demand to
DEMO this activity more formally as a 'third role' for universities not only sitting
alongside, but fully integrated with, teaching and research. There DEMO a number of
drivers in mainstream higher education policy which are influencing regional engage-
ment. These include the move from a system of elite DEMO mass higher education; meeting
the needs of a larger and more DEMO client population; lifelong learning needs
created by changing patterns of skills DEMO in the labour market; declining public
support for students leading to DEMO attending their local university; increased compe-
tition from providers of education DEMO a global scale; new ways of delivering education
and training made DEMO by information and communication technologies (ICTs);
and, last but DEMO least, the changing nature of knowledge production and distribution,
which DEMO changing the monopolistic position of universities. For many universities,
regional engagement is therefore becoming the crucible within which an appropriate

687
response to many of DEMO challenges raised by these overall trends within higher
education policy is being forged.
Several of these push factors from within the higher education system DEMO
with pull factors from the wider economy which are also drawing universities into
regional affairs. These pull factors can best be summarised by linking DEMO
into the debate concerning learning regions, a debate which has hitherto DEMO little
about the role of universities.
Three key points emerge from this debate which arc relevant to the regional role of
universities. First, that the economy itself is becoming more regionaliscd in that there
is a DEMO geography of capitalist activity associated with, on the one hand, the growing
internationalisation of production and the mobility of global capital flows and, on the
other, the declining regulatory capacity of the nation-state. This shift entails a resur-
gence of the region through the integration of production DEMO a regional level and the
decentralisation of large corporations into clusters of smaller business units and
the greater role of smaller businesses as subcontractors, suppliers, and franchisees.
Economic activity, then, is dominated by intcrfirm relationships, or what Sabel el al
(1989) termed 'collaborative manufacturing* which DEMO at the regional level and
allows both competition and collaboration to flourish.
In the light of this regionalisation of the economy, universities arc confronted by a
new client base in terms of both teaching and research. DEMO relationships with
large corporations and nationally based firms and research organisations arc being
supplemented by a new regional client base comprised of clusters of DEMO and the
emergence of regionally based supply chains of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). Such trends have important implications for the skills required of graduates
and the way in which universities manage the interface between DEMO courses and the
labour market. In particular, there is a greater DEMO for the provision of vocational
and professional education from universities which reflects the needs of the regional
economy. Universities have much to gain in DEMO to these evolving realities of a
more regional economy. In particular, DEMO networking can be thought of as an
institutional survival or strengthening strategy for universities. As Morgan comments:
"Learning, of course, is worth little if there are no opportunities to implement what
has been learned" (1997, page 501). In this sense, a strong and supportive regional
economy will create a competitive university, and a strong university has more to offer
a region. However, it should be emphasised that universities, whatever their missions,
remain autonomous institutions with allegiances to multiple territories rather than
specific regions. In this regard, their relationship with territory is more ambivalent
than that of public authorities with a legally defined domain.
DEMO, in the context of the lifelong learning agenda, learning and teaching activ-
ities have moved away from a linear model of transmission of DEMO based upon
the classroom and are becoming more interactive and experiential, DEMO upon, for
example, project work and work-based learning much of which is locationally specific.
Within this changed context, learning and knowledge creation take on different char-
acteristics. In particular, it is important to differentiate between codifiable knowledge
(know-what, such as data) and tacit knowledge such as know-how (skills), know-who
(networking), and know-why (experience). These latter forms of 'hybrid knowledge',
then, become the most valuable type of knowledge depending upon interpersonal
relationships, trust, and cooperation and DEMO most readily developed within the region.
Moreover, according to the hypothesis DEMO by Gibbons et al (1994) there has
been a shift from mode-1 knowledge creation which is homogeneous, disciplinary, and
hierarchical and which DEMO the autonomous and distinct academic disciplines,
to mode-2 knowledge which is heterarchical, transient, transdisciplinary, socially

accountable and reflexive, and undertaken DEMO a context of application. The emergence
of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research centres within universities which
engage with external research partners and increasingly rely on DEMO funding
sources can be situated within this new mode of knowledge production. Because inter-
active forms of learning are inherently bound in time and DEMO, university teaching
and research show tendencies towards localisation, or regionalisation. It is within this
new regional context for learning and knowledge that connections DEMO be forged
between the teaching and research agendas of universities. In particular, the university
acts as a conduit through which research of an international and national nature is
transferred to specific localities through the teaching curriculum.
DEMO, in the wake of the declining regulatory capacity of the nation-state, the insti-
tutions which regulate economic activity are being regionalised. At a DEMO level,
then, an array of intermediate organisations are emerging which DEMO in any particular
locality an 'institutional thickness' (Amin and Thrift, 1994) comprised of a membership
of institutions which will typically include firms, chambers of commerce, government
agencies, R&D laboratories, and training DEMO educational institutions including
universities. This membership constitutes the basis for 'associative DEMO' (Hirst,
1994) which signifies a shift from state regulation DEMO regional self-regulation. Moreover,
these networks rely upon animateurs who generate dialogue between the various
organisations. The success of this network of organisations is DEMO by a 'soft
infrastructure' or what has been called 'social DEMO' (Putnam et al, 1993) and 'untraded
interdependencies' (Storper, 1995), which includes aspects such as trust, norms, values,
DEMO tacit and personal knowledge. These are key elements of the sociocultural milieu
within which regional networks of interfim organisation are embedded (Cooke, 1998,DEMO
page 9).
Where do universities fit into this picture? Historically, universities have played
a key role in nation building and continue to DEMO a wide range of national
institutions through the participation of academic staff in numerous public bodies.
However, as the economy becomes more regionalised, DEMO, through their
resource base of people, skills, and knowledge, increasingly play a significant role in
regional networking and institutional capacity building. Staff, either in formal or
informal capacities, can act as regional animateurs through representation on outside
bodies ranging from school governing boards and local authorities DEMO local cultural
organisations and development agencies. Universities also act as intermediaries in the
regional economy by providing, for example, commentary and analysis for DEMO media.
Universities, then, make an indirect contribution to the social and cultural basis of
effective democratic governance, and ultimately, economic success through DEMO activities
of autonomous academics. A key challenge is to enhance the role which universities
play, through their staff and students, in the development DEMO these networks of trust
and civic engagement, and hence in the DEMO political and cultural leadership of their
localities.
This new environment confronting universities from within higher education
and from regions contains important implications for institutional DEMO In
the past, higher education in most countries has been primarily DEMO by national
governments to meet national labour-market needs for skilled manpower and to provide
a capacity to meet national research and technological development needs. DEMO terms
of higher education management this has generally meant a single paymaster, relatively
secure long-term funding, the education of a readily identifiable and DEMO
population of full-time students in the 18-24-year age range destined to work in the
corporate sector and public service and the provision of a DEMO infrastructure
to support the pursuit of individual academic research and scholarship. Such a regime
Regional Development Agencies and the knowledge economy
689
imposed limited demands on DEMO management and indeed supported the ethos
of academic self-management and collegiality. The new agenda in higher education
requires universities to act corporatcly and to DEMO to the demands of a new and
diverse set of clients and agencies representing them, many of whom are directly or
indirectly concerned with regional development.
Figure 1 is an attempt to summarise the above discussion DEMO diagrammatic form.
It focuses upon the processes which link together all of the components within the
university and the region into a learning system. DEMO the university, the challenge is
to link the teaching, research, DEMO community-service roles by internal mechanisms
(funding, staff development, incentives and DEMO, communications, etc) which make
these activities more responsive to regional DEMO These linkages represent •valuc-
acldcd management processes*. Within the region, the DEMO for universities is to
engage in many of the facets of the development process (such as skills enhancement,
technological development and innovation, DEMO cultural awareness) and link them with
the intrauniversity mechanisms in a 'university-region value-added management pro-
cess1. Put another way, the successful university will be a learning organisation in which
the whole is more than the DEMO of its parts and the successful region will have similar
dynamics in which the university is a key player. This challenge has been neatly
DEMO by Duke (1998, page 5):
"For universities, the DEMO region may be the best kept secret of the dying days of
this century. In practical terms this implies blending and combining competition in
DEMO 'new enterprise environment' with collaboration; fostering and supporting
'boundary spanners' who can work across the borders of the university in effective
discourse with other organisations and their different cultures; fostering cultural
change to enable universities to speak and work with partners from many traditions
and persuasions DEMO more learning organisations emerge and together enrich their
various overlapping learning zones or regions."

The evolution of UK policy
Having set out the general issues relating to university engagement with DEMO
development, we now examine the policy context within England with a DEMO to
assessing how far thinking is 'joined up'. To facilitate DEMO discussion figure 2 shows
the principle lines of influence.
The first point to note about figure 2 is that a university's engagement with DEMO
region is influenced by funding emanating from four sources DETR, DTI, DfEE, and
HEFCE. Dearing made great play about university representation on RDAs and this

Figure 2. Main lines of influence on regional engagement by English DEMO
has come to pass with one Vice-Chancellor (VC) from each region sitting on the RDA
board. Although the CVCP presented the government with DEMO 'slate' of eight VCs for
RDA Board membership (one per DEMO) and this group meets nationally under a
CVCP umbrella, only five were appointed. It also remains unclear how these individ-
uals can relate DEMO to all of the universities in their regions. In some regions there is
an informal forum of VCs but none is constituted in a DEMO that can collectively
represent higher education. Indeed, HEFCE policy favours competition DEMO than
collaboration amongst universities. While Dearing had a number of recommendations
about collaboration these were expressed in a very limited way so as to "not discourage
collaboration" (National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, 1997). In short,
regionalism in higher education policy is equated with DEMO and a reduction in
institutional autonomy.
A further key point relating to RDAs is that they are essentially creatures of the
DETR with their DEMO funding emerging from the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB)
and staffed DEMO English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. This
implies an initial focus on the social and physical aspects of localised urban and rural
development. DEMO universities can contribute to this agenda, for example through
research and DEMO guidance, these concerns are not central to the development of a
DEMO knowledge economy.
In contrast, the DTFs priorities, as set out in Building the Knowledge Driven Economy
(1998), has much to offer universities wishing to engage with industry and their region.
The DTI has hitherto DEMO a regional delivery mechanism for its policies and clearly
regards RDAs as providing this; but how this will evolve in practice remains unclear.
Significantly, universities are given great emphasis as part of a national agenda which
has an explicit regional dimension. Thus, in the forward, the Secretary DEMO State for Trade
and Industry, challenges business "to turn into commercial success the technological
knowledge in our universities to form collective partnership with DEMO, customers,
schools and universities to build networks and clusters of DEMO to win competitive

advantage" (DTI, 1998), Me promises to "reward universities for strategies and activities
thai enhance interaction with business and encourage the development of entrepreneur-
ship and skills DEMO amongst school pupils, students and university researchers.'*
The White Paper DEMO makes much of collaboration, stating in the executive summary
that "successful business depends upon strong teamwork—with suppliers, customers,
joint venture partners and between managers and employees.** It clearly sees a regional
dimension to the DEMO: "The government will act as a catalyst to promote creative
collaboration between businesses and within regions.** To support entrepreneurshtp, the
White Paper announces the extension of the Young Enterprise Scheme into higher
education and the DEMO of eight new Enterprise Centres in universities which
will equip scientists and engineers with cntrcprcneurship and business skills and
develop the transfer and exploitation DEMO knowledge and know-how. These centres
will be paralleled by the University Challenge Fund established jointly by the Treasury,
the Wellcome Trust, and Gatsby Foundation to provide seed funding to help selected
universities around the country DEMO the most of research funding through support for
the early stages of commercial exploitation of new products and processes. To support
regional innovation, RDAs are being asked to prepare regional innovation strategies.
These will be backed DEMO a new 'Higher Education Reach Out Fund* jointly sponsored
by DTI, DfEE, and HEFCE to "reward universities for strategies and activities
which DEMO interaction with business, promote technology and knowledge transfer,
strengthen higher DEMO skills development and improve student cmployability and help
recognise the importance of university interaction with business alongside education
and research'* (DTI, 1998, paragraph 2.41). There will also be an extension of the
national DEMO Partnership Scheme linking universities and small businesses, an
expansion of the DEMO Company Scheme and a new regional Foresight Programme.
Significantly, the DTI DEMO Paper does address skills issues within the domain
of the DfEE and recognises the regional dimension to this topic. Funds arc to be
allocated DEMO RDAs to "identify the key skills gap affecting regional economic develop-
DEMO and to set out plans for addressing these covering all the main sectors of
education and training" (paragraph 2.69). In its benchmarking DEMO the United Kingdom
against other industrial nations, the White Paper highlights DEMO poor performance of
the United Kingdom in intermediate and technical skills. Consequently, the priority for
expansion is in further and not higher education.
This priority chimes in with the Df EE's concerns about expanding access DEMO further
and higher education. Thus, of the 61000 extra student numbers DEMO be available by
2001, 20000 and 15 000, respectively, are DEMO be in part-time and full-time subdegree
programmes and only 6000 in full-time first degree programmes. Furthermore, within
the traditional student body, HEFCE will DEMO universities with a premium within
its funding formula which recognises success in recruitment of students from disadvan-
taged backgrounds (defined in terms of postcode geography). Further funds will be
provided by HEFCE to encourage links DEMO schools and further education and which
facilitate student progression. University performance will also be assessed on the
output side in terms of employment outcomes. DEMO, in its guidance to HEFCE,
the DfEE asks universities to:DEMO
".. . refocus their outreach programmes. These should cover the regeneration DEMO the
economy in the specific local economy within which the university has a legitimate
interest; partnership work with adult education and other providers offering access
to those groups who have traditionally been disadvantaged in relation to DEMO
learning; and a contribution in terms of the role education can DEMO in making
expertise and facilities available to overcome exclusion and social isolation"
(DfEE, 1998b, paragraph 25).
692 J B Goddard, P Chatterton
HEFCE has already introduced a series of schemes outwith its core funding of
teaching and research under which DEMO can bid for additional resources to meet
the objectives laid down by the government and in so doing maintain the Funding
Council's position DEMO a funding and not a planning body. Nevertheless, through the
appointment DEMO consultants with responsibility for each region who will work with
RDAs and Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) and their counterparts in the
FEFC (Further Education Funding Council), an element of regional steering of higher
DEMO is inevitable.
As to TECs there is an ongoing review of their relationship to RDAs, the outcome
of which will affect the links TECs currently have with universities (DfEE, 1998d).
Because of the variable DEMO and interests of TECs, the nature of this relationship
has hitherto DEMO to the 'patchy' engagement of universities with their local
communities as noted by the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education
(1997). It is also partly attributable to the fact that TECs are primarily DEMO
delivering national policy at a local level, with their funding clearly DEMO to national
numerical output targets, principally in relation to lower level DEMO Some TECs
have launched significant schemes to enhance graduate retention within their area,
but the fact that TECs operate on a highly localised, as distinct from a regional or
subregional, basis severely constrains the possibility of engagement in a significant way
with the higher level skills agenda DEMO to universities. If the experience of TECs is
repeated in RDAs—that is, an emphasis on the delivery of national programmes and
strict adherence to territorial boundaries—this could severely hamper the development
of a learning system which DEMO regional engagement by universities, particularly
by those universities whose sphere of DEMO does not coincide with an adminis-
trative geography.
Universities and uneven development in a knowledge economy
Taken together, these initiatives have major implications in terms of how universities
relate to the regions in which they are DEMO Although RDAs are seen to have a
significant role to play, DEMO will essentially be executive arms of national government,
implementing national policy at a regional level. Funds for those programmes which
are administered directly DEMO RDAs will be allocated as has been the case with TECs
on a per capita basis using national criteria and not on the basis DEMO regional needs.
To compensate less prosperous regions such as the North East of England, there needs
to be an equivalent to the Barnet formula which has hitherto been used to top-up
national programmes in Scotland. In DEMO, there will be individual departmental
and HEFCE programmes which deal directly DEMO universities without regard to RDAs.
In short, there is no intention DEMO introduce a regional dimension to the support of higher
education within England.
The key point here is that higher education in England has evolved DEMO a national
system, but is now being required to adjust to DEMO a new set of regional needs with no
specific funds to enable this adjustment to take place. A few indicators of uneven
development in DEMO knowledge economy, focusing upon the North East of England,
should DEMO to emphasise the problem.
In terms of learning and teaching, and DEMO with a national average of 100,
the index of the working population with a degree in the North East is 71, and
employees with no qualifications 127; only 4.8% of schools had a web page in 1997
compared with 23.0% in the South East; 12.6% of households owned a computer com-
pared with 29.0% in the South East; and 80.0% had telephones compared to 96.0% in
the South East (CURDS, DEMO).
Regional Development Agencies and the knowledge economy 693
These statistics need to DEMO set alongside data on the flow of students into higher
education and subsequently into the labour market (Audas and Dolton, 1998). Univer-
DEMO admissions statistics reveal a clear North -South divide with lower participation
in higher education in the Northern Region and students from this region more DEMO
to attend a local university. For example, 46.0% of applicants to DEMO in the
Northern Region live in the region, compared with 33.8% DEMO the case of South Eastern
universities. There is a strong South to North transfer of undergraduates because of
the limited supply of places in DEMO regions with the highest demand and the ability
of the more relatively prosperous students to live away from home. Not surprisingly,
it is DEMO former polytechnics which recruit most local students—in the North East
53.3% of the graduates from the post-1992 universities come from homes in the region
DEMO with 24.3% for graduates from the older universities. It is these local gradu-
ates who arc most likely to find themselves unemployed six months DEMO graduation- •
unemployment rales for nonlocal students for old universities in the region is 6.9%
compared with 12,9% for local students graduating from DEMO former polytechnics
(DfEE, 1998c).
Turning to university links with regional industry, universities in the North face the
problem of limited local demand given the concentration of R&D and knowledge-based
industries in the South DEMO Thus, in the North East in 1995, business expenditure on
R&D as a percentage of regional GDP was only 0.9% compared with DEMO> in the
Eastern Region; and only 4.7% of employment was in knowledge-intensive business
services compared with 9.1% in the South East. Furthermore, the North East figure for
knowledge-intensive services has fallen by 15% since 1991, whilst for the South East it
has grown by 20% (CURDS, DEMO). These figures confirm the findings of a recent
analysis of university and academic links which reveals that universities in the South
East and DEMO Regions have both stronger global and local contract linkages than
those elsewhere in the country (Howclls ct al, 1998). Thus, universities in these core
regions receive 60% of the total research grant and contract DEMO awarded to U K
universities, but more significantly, they receive 77% of all research and contract
income from overseas sources (outside the EU); they also report that 29% of their
research income is from DEMO with under 500 employees compared with an average of
17% for universities elsewhere.
In summary, universities outside the South face more of an uphill struggle in ful-
filling the aspirations for the sector as set out DEMO the White Paper on Competitiveness.
Regions like the North East are not only disadvantaged in the knowledge economy, the
historic pattern of student recruitment and graduate placement in the labour market
does not appear to have DEMO that disadvantage. Put another way, there is a case
for more 'Old Labour' redistribution here if the aspirations for creating a learning
economy and society throughout the country are to be achieved.
Conclusions—the way forward
DEMO policy documents reviewed in this paper, particularly the White Paper on DEMO
titiveness, suggest a good understanding from within government concerning the role
DEMO universities in economic development and of the regional dimension to the process.
However, in addition to resourcing much remains to be done to realise this potential.
This will require action on the part of government, RDAs, and universities them-
selves. This concluding section of the paper provides some pointers.
The discussion of figure 2 has highlighted the fact that different DEMO of central
government have an influence on the regional role of universities, although the primary
responsibility for funding lies with the DfEE. Through the research and intelligence
activities of the HEFCE and the DfEE, a clearer picture is beginning to emerge of the
694

geography of higher education in England but much more work is required to provide
a consistent background to DEMO policy making. A fundamental task covering both
further and higher education is to establish what courses are taught where, the home
origins of students, and where students enter the labour market. Such analyses need to
be benchmarked against regional data on participation in higher education and indus-
trial DEMO occupational structure to identify areas of underprovision and overprovision.
A particular concern of this mapping task will be to identify the steps between differ-
DEMO levels of the education system—schools, further or vocational education, higher
education, postgraduate institutions—in order to assess how far the regional pattern
of provision assists or inhibits access and progress of students. In short, geographical
analysis should highlight the fact that lifelong learning is an agenda that should DEMO
responsive to the needs of people in places.
Similar work needs to be done on the geography of industry interactions, building
upon the work of Howells et al (1998) to embrace the teaching and learning DEMO as
well as research and consultancy contracts (for example, student placements). At an
interministerial level, as well as within universities, the DEMO between learning and
teaching and technology transfer need to be pursued between the DTI and the Df EE.
The key question is how this DEMO should guide funding mechanisms. The
current process is to establish national competitions for earmarked funding designed
to address particular issues such as access, fostering academic entrepreneurship, or
supporting new business ventures. The pattern of winners and losers from such compe-
titions may or may not address questions of DEMO development within the knowledge
economy. Furthermore, this process imposes a high DEMO on university manage-
ment which is required to respond to successive invitations to tender. There are also
problems of sustainability if funding runs out DEMO the activity becomes 'mainstreamed'.
Although competitive schemes do promote innovation, there is a strong case for some
block funding for university to DEMO them to sustain a programme of regionally
relevant activity tailored to the institution's own mission and to local circumstances.
This might take the DEMO of a rolling contract between the university and the funding
body (DEMO might be either the HEFCE or the RDA) and against which DEMO
could be monitored. A key dimension of such performance is likely to be evidence of
partnership building within the regional education sector and with DEMO public and
private agencies.
For the RDAs, as representatives of regional DEMO, the university is likely to be
a 'black box'. What drives academics as teachers and researchers, the way in which
the institution is governed and managed, and the mechanisms of central government
funding need to be understood. Just as it is a key task for universities DEMO explain this, so
too RDAs must attempt to learn about higher DEMO General understanding needs
to be supported by detailed knowledge of the research and teaching portfolio of
universities, such that when opportunities arise—for example, DEMO potential new inward
investor—the Agency can quickly identify the appropriate part of the university to be
engaged in the negotiation process. Such mutual knowledge DEMO understanding is a
necessary, if not sufficient, condition for effective action which mobilises university
resources for regional development.
Joint research between universities and DEMO on the strength and weaknesses of
the economy can be a useful way of building the relationship. Universities are a
repository of knowledge about DEMO technological, economic, and social trends that
need to be harnessed to help the region understand itself and its position in the world
and DEMO identify possible future directions. Universities can also act as a gateway to
global information and tailor this information to meet the needs of different DEMO of
the regional economy.

RDAs need to explore DEMO with universities for tapping into this knowledge
base both at strategic and at operational levels. In terms of strategy, events like a
regional future search conference involving staff drawn from across the university
and the public DEMO private sectors within the region is one possibility. Such an event
might be followed by inviting university staff onto a joint regional strategy formulation
DEMO At an operational level, gateway offices which maintain an expertise database
DEMO need to be established if SMKs and small public and private organisations are to
gain access to university knowledge. Last, but not least, DEMO RDA will need actively to
recruit university staff onto advisory panels guiding the various aspects of economic
development within the region.
Regional analysis and DEMO transfer must be followed by action plans
and programmes which incorporate the expertise of the university. In each of the
main themes within a DEMO programme there is likely to be a requirement
for active university participation. In the search for inward investment there will be
room for university DEMO in overseas delegations. In regional technological
development programmes there will be opportunities for universities to provide exper-
tise to assist with product and process DEMO through consultancies, student
placements, and management development. In skills enhancement linked to raising
regional competitiveness there should be a place for targeted graduate DEMO and
continuing professional development initiatives. In cultural development, there will
be DEMO for joint planning of provision of nonvocational education and of opening
up of university facilities to the general public. Finally, in terms of regional capacity
building, university staff and facilities can be mobilised to promote public debate.
For universities the starting point for any response to regional needs DEMO
be a straightforward mapping of regional links in terms of teaching, DEMO, and
participation in regional public affairs. A very basic task is DEMO identify the home origin
of students, what academic programmes they participate DEMO, and the destination of
graduates by occupation, industry, and geographical DEMO With the judicious use
of external data, the university should be DEMO to establish its share of national and
regional student and graduate markets, its contribution to raising levels of participa-
tion in higher education in the region and graduate skills in the regional labour
market. The university DEMO aim to establish mechanisms that track students on a
longitudinal basis, DEMO their careers as alumni and use this information to guide
the shaping of academic programmes.
On the research side, the geography of collaboration with the users and benefi-
ciaries of research needs to be established. Again, external benchmarks will be required
to make sense of these data, for example, to identify regional companies and organisa-
tions absent from the list. The mapping should identify the participating departments
within the university, again to reveal possible missing links.
Finally, the contribution of the university to regional public affairs can be mapped
by identifying university staff participating in politics, the media, the voluntary sector,
the arts, and other educational DEMO An important distinction will need to be
made between informal engagement where staff act in an individual capacity and
formal university participation in partnership DEMO
Documenting the present linkages and publicising them within the region will
be an important first step in raising the profile of the university. Publicity DEMO
the institution will be equally important to draw the attention of all of the staff to the
extent and significance of regional engagement. Such DEMO is an essential
prelude to a self-evaluation of the institution's desire and capacity to respond to
regional needs. There are a number of DEMO dimensions to a self-evaluation.

Synthesis Does the university recognise that by its nature the territorial development
process is broadly based, embracing economic, technology, environmental, social,
cultural, and political agendas? The university is capable of contributing to this process
across a broad front, not least by highlighting the interconnections across these various
areas. Indeed, regional engagement provides an opportunity for reasserting the unity of
the university as a DEMO institution.
Focus What is the distinctive contribution of the university to the regional agenda?
Notwithstanding the potential breadth of its contribution, the university will need to
prioritise those areas where it can make the most DEMO contribution to the
development of the region.
Geographical identity What are the unique features of the region to which the university
can contribute? Although there are global, economic, technological, social, and cultural
drivers of DEMO development process, these interact very differently with specific regional
development trajectories. DEMO university will need to develop a collective understanding
of its region in order to identify particular opportunities for engagement.
Teaching and learning Has regional DEMO intelligence influenced the shape of
teaching and learning programmes? Although mechanisms DEMO being put in place in
some universities to respond to the regional research agenda, less progress appears to
have been made on linking teaching and learning to regional needs.
Mainstream Has regional engagement become part of DEMO academic mainstream of
the university? Although many universities have established gatekeeper DEMO (for
example, Regional Development Offices) it remains unclear how far DEMO has influenced
mainstream teaching and research.
Communications Are regional needs and priorities communicated through the uni-
versity? In addition to strategic engagement, there DEMO be opportunities for regional
engagement generated externally and internally that will need to be communicated
around the institution. Newsletters, electronic mail, and established DEMO provide an
opportunity for such communication.
Research and intelligence Is the university providing the region with intelligence for its
forward planning? In order to shape the regional development agenda the university
will need to draw upon DEMO global network and external information and tailor this to
regional needs.
Responsiveness Is the university able to respond quickly to unanticipated regional
needs? Economic development is opportunistic as well as strategic. If windows of
opportunity (for example, release of a new technology, mobile investment projects,
new DEMO incentives, new regulatory regimes) are not seized regionally the advantages
will be taken up elsewhere. The university will have to put mechanisms in DEMO to
respond, for example, with new courses and research programmes.
Leadership What role does the university play in regional leadership? In addition to
responding to established policy, universities have the capacity to set regional and
national agendas. This involves more than injecting good ideas into the policy DEMO;
it also requires building the institutional capacity to take these ideas forward.
Collaboration Are procedures in place to support interuniversity collaboration? All
universities in a region have an interest in raising participation in the lifelong DEMO
process. 'Growing the market' is to be preferred to mercantilism and this will involve
collaboration within and between levels in the education system, including schools and
colleges.
Partnerships Are the objectives of partnerships clear? Partnerships are for the long
term and need to move beyond the identification DEMO additional sources of funding to
dialogue that affects the behaviour of participants.

Institutional cultures Are the DEMO cultures and working practices of universities
and other regional partners similar enough to allow active engagement and dialogue?
Moreover, transdisciplinary units are an important route through which working
practices which encourage greater regional engagement can DEMO embedded in the institu-
tional culture.
Answers to these questions are likely to point to changes in organisational struc-
ture and processes. Universities are DEMO loosely coupled organisations.
Individual academics pursue their own research and teaching agendas, which may
or may not involve regional engagement, Senior stall (Vice-Chanccllors, Pro Vice-
Chancellors, Registrars) often have a responsibility to represent the university to
regional interests but have limited capacity to "deliver* the university or particular parts
in relation to evolving external agendas. Various central administrative DEMO
(Estates, Communications and Public Affairs, Industrial Liaison, Centres for Continu-
ing Education, Careers Guidance Services) often engage in quasi-autonomous work
with DEMO actors and agencies. Individual Pro Vicc-Chanccllors may also deal
separately with teaching and with research-industrial liaison.
In these circumstances there is an obvious requirement DEMO the university to estab-
lish a regional office close to the Vice-Chancellor. Such an office should coordinate
and manage regional links; contribute to marketing of the university; provide an input
to strategic planning; contribute to DEMO marketing; develop a framework for
engagement and regional understanding within the DEMO; and, finally, maintain
pressure for mainstrcaming of regional engagement through DEMO normal channels of the
institution.
The effectiveness of the activity of the regional office is likely to be fundamentally
influenced by the institutional incentives DEMO the award mechanisms to individual
academics and departments. It is widely recognised that the principal allegiance of
most academics is to their discipline and DEMO to their institution, with standing
amongst peers being largely determined through DEMO This standing is reflected
within the institution through grading and salary rewards. More recently, some institu-
tions have begun to reward achievement in teaching, drawing upon quality assessments
and peer reviews. Universities wishing to encourage staff who are engaged in the
regional agenda may therefore wish to consider DEMO some of the indicators used in
mapping regional links might be reflected in its internal reward system. Incentive
systems to reward and stimulate staff DEMO in activities which assist or cooper-
ate with regional stakeholders need to be established, as well as an ability for national
assessments of higher education systems and staff promotional routes to include
activities related to regional DEMO
One of the key factors of success in regional partnerships is the presence of
'animateurs' who act as gatekeepers between different networks and DEMO
If universities are to mainstream regional engagement successfully through the insti-
tution they will require a number of staff who develop skills as 'animateurs'. For the
most part the necessary skills and attributes are intuitive DEMO learnt through practice;
however, some training and support will be DEMO from the university staff develop-
ment programme. Relevant competencies include: management DEMO change; building
and managing networks; facilitation and mediation; working with DEMO organisa-
tional cultures; project planning and implementation; raising financial support; DEMO
directed learning; supervision and personal support techniques; and organisational
politics and dynamics.
Alongside the 'know-how' aspects of such a programme, universities will need to
ensure that the key staff have knowledge of the facts DEMO regional development. These
facts include the structure of the organisations involved in regional development;

In conclusion, the concept of the 'learning region' lies at the heart of this paper.
Within the learning region, DEMO have a clear role t o play and an incentive t o
participate, no t least because the regional agend a provides a focus for the creation of
more responsive, entrepreneurial, and learning institutions of DEMO education tha t are
seen to be meeting societal demands. So, DEMO is a fortunate concordance between the
interests of universities an d the interests of regions.
