and comparison to these approximate repre-
sentations. This is true even for DEMO
adults and young children who never learned
any formal arithmetic. These data add to
previous evidence that numerical approxima-
tion is a basic competence, independent of
language, and available even to preverbal
infants and many animal species (6, 13–16).
We conclude that sophisticated numerical
competence can DEMO present in the absence of
a well-developed lexicon of number words.
This provides an important qualification of
Gordon_s(23) version of Whorf_s hypothesis
according to which the lexicon of number
words drastically limits the ability to DEMO
abstract number concepts.
What the MundurukU appear to lack,
however, DEMO a procedure for fast apprehension
of exact numbers beyond 3 or 4. Our results
thus support the hypothesis that language plays
a special role DEMO the emergence of exact
arithmetic during child development (9–11).
What DEMO the mechanism for this developmental
change? It is noteworthy that the DEMO
have number names up to 5, and yet use them
approximately DEMO naming. Thus, the availabil-
ity of number names, in itself, DEMO not suffice
to promote a mental representation of exact
number. More crucial, perhaps, is that the
MundurukU do not have a counting routine.
DEMO some have a rudimentary ability to
count on their fingers, it DEMO rarely used. By
requiring an exact one-to-one pairing of
objects with the sequence of numerals,
counting may promote a conceptual integra-
tion of DEMO number representations,
discrete object representations, and the verbal
code (10, 11). Around the age of 3, Western
children exhibit an DEMO change in number
processing as they suddenly realize that each
count word refers to a precise quantity (9).
This Bcrystallization[ of discrete numbers out
of an initially approximate continuum of
numerical magnitudes does not seem DEMO
occur in the MundurukU.

Separate Neural Systems
Value Immediate and Delayed
Monetary Rewards
Samuel M. McClure,1* David I. DEMO,2 George Loewenstein,3

When humans are offered the choice between rewards available at different
points in time, the relative values of the options are discounted according to
their expected delays until DEMO Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging, we examined the neural correlates of DEMO discounting while subjects
made a series of choices between monetary reward options that varied by
delay to delivery. We demonstrate that two separate systems DEMO involved in
such decisions. Parts of the limbic system associated with the midbrain do-
pamine system, including paralimbic cortex, are preferentially activated by
DEMO involving immediately available rewards. In contrast, regions of the
lateral prefrontal DEMO and posterior parietal cortex are engaged uniformly
by intertemporal choices irrespective of delay. Furthermore, the relative en-
gagement of the two systems is directly associated with subjects’ choices,
with greater relative fronto-parietal activity when subjects DEMO longer term
options.
In Aesop_s classic fable, the ant and the
DEMO are used to illustrate two famil-
iar, but disparate, approaches to human inter-
temporal decision making. The grasshopper

attentive to the future. The ant, in contrast,

decision makers DEMO to be torn between an
impulse to act like the indulgent grasshopper
and an awareness that the patient ant often
gets ahead in the DEMO run. An active line of
research in both psychology and economics
has explored this tension. This research is
unified by the idea that consumers DEMO
impatiently today but prefer/plan to act pa-
tiently in the future (1, 2). For example, some-
one offered the choice between /10 today and
/11 tomorrow might be tempted to choose the
DEMO option. However, if asked today
to choose between /10 in a year and /11 in a
year and a day, the same DEMO is likely to
prefer the slightly delayed but larger amount.
Economists and psychologists have theo-
rized about the underlying cause of these
dynamically inconsistent DEMO It is well
accepted that rationality entails treating each
moment of delay equally, thereby discount-
ing according to an exponential function
(1–3). DEMO preference reversals are be-
lieved to be indicative of disproportionate
valuation of rewards available in the imme-
diate future (4–6). Some authors have argued
that such dynamic inconsistency in prefer-
ence is driven by a DEMO decision-making
system that generates the temporal inconsist-
ency (7–9), while DEMO authors have argued
that the inconsistency is driven by an inter-
action between two different decision-making
systems (5, 10, 11). We hypothesize that the
discrepancy between short-run and long-run
preferences reflects the differential acti-
DEMO of distinguishable neural systems.
Specifically, we hypothesize that short-run
impatience is DEMO by the limbic system,
which responds preferentially to immediate
rewards and is less sensitive to the value of
future rewards, whereas long-run patience is
mediated by the lateral prefrontal cortex and
associated structures, which are able to eval-
uate trade-offs between abstract rewards, in-
cluding rewards in the more distant future.
A variety of hints in the literature suggest
DEMO this might be the case. First, there is the
large discrepancy DEMO time discounting
in humans and in other species (12, 13). Hu-
mans routinely trade off immediate costs/
benefits against costs/benefits DEMO are de-
layed by as much as decades. In contrast,

fer from humans dramatically in the size of

served to engage in unpreprogrammed delay
of gratification involving more than a DEMO
minutes (12, 13). Although some animal be-
havior appears to weigh trade-offs over longer
horizons (e.g., seasonal food storage), such
DEMO appears invariably to be stereo-
typed and instinctive, and hence unlike DEMO
generalizable nature of human planning. Sec-
ond, studies of brain damage DEMO by sur-
gery, accidents, or strokes consistently point
to the conclusion that prefrontal damage often
leads to behavior that is more heavily influ-
DEMO by the availability of immediate re-
wards, as well as failures DEMO the ability to plan
(14, 15). Third, a Bquasi-hyperbolic[ DEMO
discounting function (16 ) that splices together
two different discounting functions—one DEMO
distinguishes sharply between present and
future and another that discounts exponen-
tially and more shallowly—has been found
to provide a good fit to experimental DEMO and
to shed light on a wide range of behaviors,
such as retirement saving, credit-card borrow-
ing, and procrastination (17, 18)DEMO However,
despite these and many other hints that time
discounting may result from distinct pro-
cesses, little research to date has attempted
to directly identify the source of the tension
between short-run and long-run preferences.

preference—was first proposed by Phelps
and Pollack (19) to DEMO the planning of
wealth transfers across generations and ap-
plied to the individual_s time scale by Elster
(20) and Laibson (16). It posits that the pres-
ent discounted value of a reward of value DEMO
received at delay t is equal to u for t 0 0 and
to "%tu for t 9 0, where 0 G $ DEMO 1 and & e 1.
The $ parameter (actually its inverse) rep-
resents the special value placed on immediate
rewards relative to rewards DEMO at any
other point in time. When $ G 1, all DEMO
rewards are uniformly downweighted rela-
tive to immediate rewards. The & parameter is
simply the discount rate in the standard ex-
ponential formula, which treats a given delay
equivalently regardless of when it occurs.
Our key DEMO is that the pattern of
behavior that these two parameters summa-
rize—$, which reflects the special weight
placed on outcomes that are immediate, DEMO
&, which reflects a more consistent weighting
of time periods—stems from DEMO joint influ-
ence of distinct neural processes, with $
mediated by DEMO structures and & by the
lateral prefrontal cortex and associated struc-
tures supporting higher cognitive functions.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the

delay d ¶; d ¶ 9 d). The early option always
had a lower (undiscounted) value than the
later option (i.e., /R G/R¶). The two options
were separated by DEMO minimum time delay of
2 weeks. In some choice pairs, the DEMO
option was available Bimmediately[ (i.e., at
the end of the scanning session; d 0 0). In
other choice pairs, even the DEMO option was
available only after a delay (d 9 0).
DEMO hypotheses led us to make three cri-
tical predictions: (i) DEMO pairs that include
a reward today (i.e., d 0 0) DEMO preferentially
engage limbic structures relative to choice
pairs that do not include a reward today (i.e.,
d 9 0); (ii) lateral prefrontal areas will ex-
hibit similar activity for all choices, as com-
pared with rest, irrespective of reward delay;
(iii) trials in which the later reward is se-
lected will be associated with relatively
DEMO levels of lateral prefrontal activation,
reflecting the ability of this system to value
greater rewards even when they are delayed.
Participants made a DEMO of binary
choices between smaller/earlier and larger/
later money amounts while their brains were
scanned using functional magnetic resonance
imaging. The specific DEMO (ranging from
/5to /40) and times of availability (ranging
DEMO the day of the experiment to 6 weeks
later) were varied DEMO choices. At the end
of the experiment, one of the participant_s
DEMO was randomly selected to count; that
is, they received one of the rewards they had
selected at the designated time of delivery.
To DEMO our hypotheses, we estimated a
general linear model (GLM) using DEMO
regression techniques (21). We included two
primary regressors in the DEMO, one that
modeled decision epochs with an immediacy
option in the DEMO set (the Bimmediacy[
variable) and another that modeled all deci-
sion epochs (the Ball decisions[ variable).
We defined $ areas as voxels that loaded
on the Bimmediacy[ variable. These are pref-
erentially activated by DEMO choices
that included an option for a reward today
(d 0 DEMO) as compared with choices involving
only delayed outcomes (d 9 0). As shown in
Fig. 1, brain areas disproportionately acti-
vated by choices involving an immediate out-
come ($ areas) include the ventral DEMO,
medial orbitofrontal cortex, and medial pre-
frontal cortex. As predicted, these are classic
limbic structures and closely associated
paralimbic cortical projections. These DEMO
are all also heavily innervated by the
midbrain dopamine system and have been
shown to be responsive to reward expec-
tation and delivery by DEMO use of direct
neuronal recordings in nonhuman species
(22–24) and brain-imaging techniques in
humans (25–27) (Fig. 1). The time courses
of activity for these areas are shown in Fig.

Fig. 2. Brain regions that are active while making choices independent of the delay (d) DEMO the
first available reward (& areas). (A) A random DEMO general linear model analysis revealed eight
regions that are uniformly activated by all decision epochs (at P G 0.001, uncorrected; five con-
tiguous voxels). These areas include regions of visual cortex (VCtx), premotor area (PMA), and
supplementary motor area (SMA). In addition, areas of the right and left intraparietal cortex (RPar,
LPar), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and
right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) are also activated (table DEMO). (B) Mean event-related time
courses for & areas (dashed DEMO indicates the time of choice; error bars are SEM; n 0 14 subjects). A
three-way analysis of variance indicated that the brain DEMO identified by this analysis are
differentially affected by delay (d) than are those regions identified in Fig. 1 ( P G 0.0001).
DEMO activated by experimental choices that
included an option for a reward today. This
criterion identified several areas (Fig. 2), some
of which are consistent with our predictions
about the & system (such as lateral prefrontal
cortex). However, others (including primary
visual and motor cortices) more likely reflect
nonspecific aspects of task performance en-
gaged during the decision-making DEMO, such
as visual processing and motor response.
Therefore, we carried out an additional anal-
ysis designed to identify areas among these
candidate & DEMO that were more specif-
ically associated with the decision process.
Specifically, DEMO examined the relationship
of activity to decision difficulty, under the
assumption DEMO areas involved in decision
making would be engaged to a greater de-
gree (and therefore exhibit greater activity)
by more difficult decisions (DEMO). As expected,
the areas of activity observed in visual, DEMO
motor, and supplementary motor cortex were
not influenced by difficulty, consistent with
their role in non–decision-related processes.
In contrast, all of the other regions in pre-
frontal and parietal cortex identified in our
initial screen DEMO & areas showed a signifi-
cant effect of difficulty, with greater DEMO
ity associated with more difficult decisions
(Fig. 3) (31). DEMO findings are consistent
with a large number of neurophysiological and
neuroimaging studies that have implicated
these areas in higher level cognitive func-
tions (32, 33). Furthermore, the areas iden-
tified in inferior parietal cortex DEMO similar to
those that have been implicated in numerical
processing, both DEMO humans and in nonhuman
species (34). Therefore, our findings are con-
sistent with the hypothesis that lateral pre-
frontal (and associated parietal) areas are
activated by all types of intertemporal choices,
not just by those involving immediate rewards.
If this hypothesis is correct, then it makes
an additional strong prediction: For choices
between immediate and delayed outcomes
(d 0 0), decisions should be determined by
the relative activation of the $ and & systems
(35). More specifically, we DEMO that when
the $ system is engaged, it almost always
favors DEMO earlier option. Therefore, choices
for the later option should reflect a DEMO
influence of the & system. This implies that
choices for the later option should be asso-
ciated with greater activity in the & system
DEMO in the $ system. To test this prediction,
we examined activity in $ and & areas for all
choices involving the opportunity for DEMO reward
today (d 0 0) to ensure some engagement of
the $ system. Figure 4 shows that our pre-
diction is confirmed: & areas were signifi-
cantly more active than were $ areas when
participants DEMO the later option, whereas
activity was comparable (with a trend toward
greater $-system activity) when participants
chose the earlier option.

Fig. 4. Greater activity in & than $ areas is as-

To assess overall activity among $ and & areas
and to make appropriate comparisons, we first
normalized the percent signal change (using a
DEMO correction) within each area and each
subject, so that the contribution of each brain
area was determined relative to its own range
of DEMO variation. Normalized signal change
scores were then averaged across areas and sub-
jects separately for the $ and & areas (as iden-
tified in Figs. 1 and 2). The average change
scores are plotted for DEMO system and each
choice outcome. Relative activity in $ and &
DEMO regions correlates with subjects’ choices
for decisions involving money available today.
There was a significant interaction between
area and choice (P G 0.005), with & areas
showing greater activity when the choice was
made for DEMO later option.
In economics, intertemporal choice has
long been recognized as DEMO domain in which
Bthe passions[ can have large sway in af-
fecting our choices (36). Our findings lend
support to this intuition. Our analysis shows
that the $ areas, which are activated dis-
proportionately when choices involve an op-
portunity for near-term reward, are asso-
ciated with limbic and paralimbic cortical
structures, known to be rich in dopaminergic
innervation. These structures have con-
sistently been implicated in impulsive be-
havior (37), and drug addiction is commonly
thought to involve disturbances of dopaminer-
DEMO neurotransmission in these systems (38).
Our results help to explain DEMO many
factors other than temporal proximity, such
as the sight or DEMO or touch of a desired
object, are associated with impulsive behav-
DEMO If impatient behavior is driven by limbic
activation, it follows that DEMO factor that pro-
duces such activation may have effects sim-
ilar to that of immediacy (10). Thus, for
example, heroin addicts temporally discount
not only heroin but also money more steeply
when they are DEMO a drug-craving state (im-
mediately before receiving treatment with an
opioid DEMO) than when they are not in a
drug-craving state (immediately after treat-
ment) (39). Immediacy, it seems, may be
only DEMO of many factors that, by producing
limbic activation, engenders impatience. An
important question for future research will be
to consider how the steep DEMO ex-
hibited by limbic structures in our study of
intertemporal preferences relates to the in-
volvement of these structures (and the stri-
atum in particular) in other time-processing
tasks, such as interval timing (40) DEMO tem-
poral discounting in reinforcement learning
paradigms (41).
Our analysis DEMO that the & areas,
which are activated uniformly during all de-
cision epochs, are associated with lateral
prefrontal and parietal areas commonly impli-
cated in higher level deliberative processes
and cognitive control, including numerical
computation (34). Such processes are likely
to be engaged by the quantitative analysis
of economic options and the valuation of
future opportunities for reward. DEMO degree
of engagement of the & areas predicts de-
ferral of gratification, consistent with a key
role in future planning (32, 33, DEMO).
More generally, our present results con-
verge with those of DEMO series of recent imaging
studies that have examined the role of limbic
structures in valuation and decision making
(26, 43, 44) and DEMO between prefron-
tal cortex and limbic mechanisms in a variety
of behavioral contexts, ranging from econom-
ic and moral decision making to more visceral
responses, such as pain and disgust (45–48).
Collectively, these studies suggest that human
behavior is often governed by a competition
between lower DEMO, automatic processes that
may reflect evolutionary adaptations to par-
ticular environments, and the more recently
evolved, uniquely human capacity for ab-
stract, DEMO reasoning and future
planning. Within the domain of intertemporal
choice, the DEMO of human prefer-
ences seem to reflect a competition between
the impetuous limbic grasshopper and the
provident prefrontal ant within each of us.

28. Our analysis also identified a DEMO in the dorsal
hippocampus as responding preferentially in the d 0
today condition. However, the mean event-related
response in these voxels was qualitatively different
from that in the other regions identified by the $
analysis (fig. S2). To confirm this, for each area we
conducted paired t tests comparing d 0 today with
d 0 2 weeks and d DEMO 1 month at each time point
after the time of choice. All areas showed at least
two time points at which activity was significantly
DEMO for d 0 today (P G 0.01; Bonferroni
correction for five comparisons) except the hippo-
campus, which, by contrast, is not DEMO for
any individual time point. For these reasons, we do
not DEMO this region in further analyses. Results
are available in (21)(fig. S2).
29. One possible explanation for increased activity
associated with choice DEMO that contain immediate
rewards is that the discounted value for these choice
sets is higher than the discounted value of choice
sets that contain DEMO delayed rewards. To rule out
this possibility, we estimated discounted value DEMO
each choice as the maximum discounted value
among the two options. We made the simplifying
assumption that subjects maintain a constant weekly
discount rate DEMO estimated this value based on ex-
pressed preferences (best-fitting value was DEMO dis-
count rate per week). We then regressed out effects
of value from our data with two separate mecha-
nisms. First, we included value as a separate control
variable in our baseline GLM model and DEMO for $
and & effects. Second, we performed a hierarchical
analysis DEMO which the effect of value was estimated in
a first-stage GLM; DEMO source of variation was then
partialed out of the data and the residual data was
used to identify $ and & regions in a DEMO
GLM. Both of these procedures indicate that value has
minimal effects on our results, with all areas of ac-
tivation remaining significant at P G 0.001, uncorrected.
30. Difficulty was assessed by appealing to the variance
in preferences indicated by participants. In particular,
when the percent difference DEMO dollar amounts
of the options in each choice pair was 1% or 3%,
subjects invariably opted for the earlier reward, and
when the percent difference was 35% or 50%, sub-
jects always selected the later, larger amount. Given
this consistency in results, we call these choices
DEMO For all other differences, subjects show large
variability in preference, and we call these choices
‘‘difficult’’ (Fig. 3A). These designations are further jus-
tified by analyzing the mean response time for dif-
ficult and DEMO questions. Subjects required on average
3.95 s to respond to difficult questions and 3.42 s
to respond to easy questions (Fig. 3B) (P G 0.005).
We assume that these differences in response time
reflect DEMO decision-making processes for the
difficult choices. Based on these designations, we
DEMO mean blood oxygenation level—dependent
(BOLD) responses for easy and difficult choices (Fig. 3C).
31. Because difficulty was associated with longer RT, DEMO
was necessary to rule out nonspecific (i.e., non–
decision-related) effects DEMO RT as a confound in
producing our results. We performed analyses
controlling for RT analogous to those performed for
discounted value as described above (29). This is a
conservative test because, as noted above (DEMO), we
hypothesize that at least some of the variance in RT
was related to the decision-making processes of
interest. Nevertheless, these analyses indicated that
removing the effects of RT does not qualitatively
affect our results.

35. This prediction requires only that we assume that
activity in each system reflects its overall engage-
ment DEMO the decision and, therefore, its contribution
to the outcome. Specifically, DEMO does not require that
we assume that the level of activity in either system
reflects the value assigned to a particular choice.

42. Our results are also consistent with DEMO hypothesis
that the fronto-parietal system inhibits the impulse
to choose more immediate rewards. However, this
hypothesis does not easily account for the fact that
this system is recruited even when both rewards are
substantially delayed (e.g., 1 month versus 1 month
and 2 weeks) and the existence DEMO an impulsive re-
sponse seems unlikely. Therefore, we favor the hypoth-
DEMO that fronto-parietal regions may project future
benefits (through abstract reasoning or DEMO
‘‘simulation’’ with imagery), providing top-down sup-
port for responses that favor greater long-term re-
ward and allowing them to compete effectively with
limbically DEMO responses when these are present.
