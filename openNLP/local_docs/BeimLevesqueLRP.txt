Country Selection for New
DEMO Venturing: A Multiple
Criteria Decision Analysis
Gina Beim1
and Moren Le´
DEMO
Venturing into international markets has become increasingly common for firms of all
sizes. Selecting a country in which to establish a new business venture DEMO a significant and
important managerial decision, and requires the evaluation of DEMO criteria. To date,
studies that focus on identifying a country for foreign direct investment list the factors one
must consider, but the formal use of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods
has not been DEMO in the literature. This article illustrates how the use of MCDA can
facilitate the decisionmaking process on which country to venture into.

Introduction
Company executives who wish to expand internationally face a bewildering choice of countries to
enter. As a ﬁrst step, the aspiring international entrepreneur must gather information on potential
locations and evaluate DEMO under several criteria. Such evaluation is often performed in an ad hoc
fashion, but a more formal approach can greatly assist decisionmakers in their country selection.
The use of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) involves DEMO, articulating the
knowledge about decision processes, and explores possible outcomes. It therefore provides a rigor-
ous and consistent approach, the transparency of which allows the decisionmaker to justify the
outcome to stakeholders.
This article offers DEMO overview of this methodology and, using a commercially available software
packages, analyses the problem of selecting countries. The paper begins with the background DEMO
MCDA, followed by a review of relevant literature. The subsequent section DEMO an example of

Background on MCDA
The original motivation for the development of the MCDA ﬁeld was the realisation that decision-
makers needed tools beyond ﬁnancial analysis DEMO assist them in resolving conﬂicts between various
interests and goals. Instead of transforming all interests and goals into monetary units and perform-
ing a DEMO beneﬁt or cost effectiveness analysis, MCDA acknowledges that not all factors DEMO be
expressed in money terms. One of its most important contributions is the development of
approaches that help decisionmakers organise and synthesise information of DEMO complex and con-
ﬂicting nature by taking explicit account of intangible criteria.1 MCDA seeks to integrate objective
measurements with value judgment and thus makes DEMO subjectivity explicit and attempts to
better manage it.
MCDA proposes to aid decisionmakers in the understanding of trade-offs, resulting in a ranking
of alternatives whenever possible, and allowing the elimination of clearly inferior alternatives. The
result tends to be a better, less controversial and more defendable decision. This methodology does
not propose to ‘‘decide for the decisionmaker’’. Current research concentrates DEMO on structur-
ing a problem that requires a decision and on helping decisionmakers learn more about the
problem through the model. The ﬁnal output DEMO these models is not to be understood as an ‘‘answer
to the problem’’ but rather as a clearer picture of the consequences of selecting DEMO certain course of
action. When trade-offs among economic, social, environmental and other criteria have to be made,
MCDA helps decisionmakers understand and DEMO these trade-offs, thus promoting good
decisionmaking.2
Almost any decision is inherently DEMO multiple criteria decision, yet no one in their right mind
would DEMO a MCDA methodology to decisions that have to be made quickly or to decisions
that, in the grand scheme of things, really are DEMO that important. Belton and Stewart (2002) rec-
ommend applying MCDA to explore ‘‘decisions that matter’’, as measured by the level of conﬂict
between criteria or by the level of disagreement among stakeholders as to the DEMO importance of
criteria. If an overseas site needs to be located into a network of suppliers and users that is prede-
termined, the importance of the criterion ‘‘proximity to network of buyers and suppliers’’ may
assume DEMO proportions that all other criteria pale in comparison. Applying MCDA may not be
necessary in this case. If, however, a handful of locations DEMO the ‘‘proximity to network’’ test,
then MCDA may play an important role (in this situation one would probably eliminate the ‘‘prox-
imity to network’’ criterion from the list of criteria used to further narrow the DEMO).
No one in their right mind would apply a MCDA methodology to
decisions that have to be made quickly or that are not DEMO
This article extends the use of MCDA to the internationalisation process of new business
ventures. The literature reviewed next is mostly orientated towards ﬁrms DEMO are already large mul-
tinationals. MCDA has important implications for foreign country selection by enterprises of all
sizes, but especially for new ventures where resources are limited and one mistake is sufﬁcient to
jeopardise survival. In DEMO to providing country ranking, MCDA helps decisionmakers
eliminate inferior country alternatives, obtain the relative importance of criteria to be used in
the country DEMO decision, and explain and defend the country selection to stakeholders.
Furthermore, MCDA facilitates the inclusion of subjective aspects in the decision process, can be
customised for any industry and easily replicable by entrepreneurs.

Country DEMO for New Business Venturing
This article applies a class of MCDA models generally known as value DEMO models,
which are based on Multiattribute Value Theory (MAVT).3 DEMO is one of the most widely-em-
ployed MCDA methods in practical applications, and in the authors’ personal experience easily
understood by individuals who are part of the business world. 4 This approach requires careful de-
velopment DEMO the scales in which each criterion is evaluated. Value functions attempt to translate the
relationship between a certain evaluation and the satisfaction this evaluation DEMO to the decision-
maker. The relative importance of each criterion is then assessed, and an overall score for each
alternative is developed. General road maps applied by MCDA modellers typically involve six steps,
which are DEMO in Appendix A for value function based methods.5 Experienced business deci-
sionmakers are no doubt capable of making informed country selection decisions without the DEMO of
a decision model. The employment of a formal method such as MCDA may nevertheless lead to
a better analysis of all facets of DEMO problem, and may help lead to decisions that can be better DEMO
plained and defended.
Innovation literature has addressed the issue of whether metrics are valuable tools to help man-
agers measure the merits of new DEMO Similarly, the knowledge management literature
discusses the idea of rationalising what DEMO usually done by instinct. Zollo and Winter (2002) state
that people ‘‘often think imperfectly but constructively’’. They also argue that knowledge articula-
tion, whereby ‘‘implicit knowledge is articulated through collective discussions, debrieﬁng sessions,
and performance evaluation processes’’, helps ﬁrms create and maintain more consistent perfor-
mances across time.7 Boisot and MacMillan (2004) differentiated among managerial and entrepre-
DEMO mindsets.8 Whereas the manager bases decisions on experience and ‘‘uses probabilities to
justify its actions’’ the entrepreneur, lacking a body of evidence, makes DEMO based on what ap-
pears to be plausible and coherent. Boisot and MacMillan call for knowledge management tools that
would allow entrepreneurs to explore DEMO outcomes and assess their plausibility. The use of
MCDA involves measurement, DEMO the knowledge about decision processes, and involves
exploring possible outcomes. It DEMO thus contribute to more consistent and coherent decision-
making. Consistency cannot, DEMO, imply stagnation. Good knowledge management e and
sound decisionmaking e require DEMO, reassessment and adaptation.

Among businesses, ad hoc or ‘‘gut feel’’ country selection decisions are very common, whereas
the use of analytical decision models is not. Multicriteria methodologies are rarely used in private
companies, and even more rarely among small business owners. Pomerol and Barba-Romero
(2000) DEMO published real-world MCDA applications.9 Although some managerial and strategic
decision situations arise on their list, none of those applications relates to the stage in the decision
process where the decisionmaker must select a country in which DEMO establish a new business venture.
Kasanen and colleagues (2000) proposed that the reason why relatively few MCDA models have
widespread applications in the DEMO world might be that its theory oversimpliﬁes real-world
decision processes.10 Pomerol and Barba-Romero (2000) contended that MCDA could sometimes
be rejected because of DEMO assumptions, and other times because of overly complicated
questioning of decisionmakers. DEMO testing a MCDA model on ﬁve practising entrepreneurs, this ar-
ticle DEMO that MCDA has the potential to improve the decision process in cases where managerial
decisions overlook options, fail to evaluate consequences in terms of explicitly stated criteria and
are less than efﬁcient.
Criteria-Based Applications in International DEMO Literature

selection chosen to exemplify the application that appears in the next section DEMO indicators that
are repeatedly alluded to in the literature. The reviewed literature has not been sufﬁciently explicit
on the use and the practice of, and on the relationships between, those indicators. The following
paragraphs review key FDI research, important country risk assessment work and ﬁnally demon-
strate that MCDA has certain advantages over each of the methodologies developed by scholars.
DEMO 1 summarises the objective of and the measures used in the studies reviewed.11
The 1976 work of Kobrin used socioeconomic and political indicators to DEMO the relation-
ship between various aspects of the environment and ﬂows of US FDI in manufacturing. He applied
regression analysis to correlate FDI to DEMO of government instability and subversion, socioeco-
nomic development, market size and potential and economic growth. This work highlighted the
importance of economic, cultural and demographic indicators, but, contrary to the next studies,
the DEMO of political indicators. A regression approach shed light on to which criteria
were relevant for FDI in a speciﬁc context. However, it did not provide a country ranking, nor
did it help decisionmakers eliminate inferior country alternatives, obtain the relative importance
of criteria to be used in the country selection decision, or better explain and defend the country
selection to stakeholders.
A decade later, Meyer-Ehrman and Hamburg developed and tested a normative model to help
ﬁrms identify a subset of countries for manufacturing investment. DEMO authors noted that, while
Aharoni had empirically observed that ‘‘ﬁrms do DEMO look at the entire world when seeking poten-
tial location sites for FDI’’, other researchers had stressed the need for a normative approach to
country selection.12 In response, Meyer-Ehrman and Hamburg offered a prescriptive method
that incorporates both highest mean scores and highest variance scores (a measure of risks) for
each individual indicator. Their country ranking was based on an aggregate measure of the
weighted probability that each indicator scores above a DEMO threshold. This work also
highlighted the importance of economic and cultural indicators, in addition to political and legal
ones. MCDA is superior to this approach because it can be used to perform sensitivity analysis ﬁrst,
DEMO help decisionmakers observe the implications on their decisions from changes in the relative im-
portance of criteria (as represented by weights); and, DEMO, to allow for a discussion that aids
them in understanding the DEMO of their expressed preferences.
Unlike survey-based methodologies, MCDA is easily replicable DEMO
entrepreneurs
For export-orientated FDI, Woodward and Rolfe (1993) focus on DEMO Caribbean Basin, using
a logit model to estimate the probability of DEMO country being selected for investment in manufactur-
ing. They mainly focused on political variables, but found that unionisation rate and land area were
insigniﬁcant indicators. In 1994, Kumar examined the role of structural and policy factors in
explaining a country’s attractiveness for investment by US ﬁrms. Based on DEMO least square
regressions, Kumar concluded that all of his economic variables DEMO signiﬁcant except export-ori-
entation of US afﬁliates, international orientation and stock DEMO US FDI per capita. As mentioned
earlier, MCDA offers multiple advantages DEMO regression-based methods.
More recently, Brush, Maritan, and Karnani (1999) DEMO on the empirical determination of
the relative importance of factors impacting a plant-opening decision for four types of manufactur-
ing operations. They asked individuals DEMO what degree each economic, political, legal and cultural
indicator had inﬂuenced their location decision. Unlike survey-based methodologies, MCDA is eas-
ily replicable by entrepreneurs. Closest to the present decision-aid focus is the 2002 work of DEMO
and Levary, which, based on economic and political indicators, ranked DEMO for FDI in the
e-retail industry. The current article complements this work in two ways. It offers a general model
(and indicators) that DEMO be customised for any industry, and further develops Zhao and Levary’s

approach by proposing a more rigorous methodology for obtaining the weights of DEMO used in
the country evaluation.
Cosset, Siskos and Zopounidis (1992), Cook and Hebner (1993) and Doumpos, Zanakis and
Zopounidis (2001) developed MCDA models for ranking countries by risk level based on eco-
DEMO and/or political indicators. In contrast, this article deals not only DEMO country invest-
ment risk, but also with a myriad of other DEMO This is in line with Khanna, Palepu
and Sinha (2005) DEMO caution aspiring international business people against relying solely on
country investment risk.13 The MCDA model we propose is intended to eliminate inferior al-
ternatives DEMO market entry, considering ﬁnancial risk as well as legal and cultural DEMO which
are important for country selection. This framework helps the inclusion of these often subjective
aspects in the decision process.14
The literature review on DEMO models of country selection coupled with testimonials from
professionals in the ﬁeld has revealed an extensive list of indicators often considered in country
selection. DEMO criteria selected for the present application follows the necessary conditions for
the use of a MCDA approach: avoiding the pitfalls of redundancy, lack DEMO independence, and
extreme complexity while being comprehensive and sensitive to criteria DEMO Equal weights
of these factors are observed in some country ratings.15 Equal weights, however, are essentially
arbitrary and do not necessarily reﬂect the DEMO of entrepreneurs.16 In the present MCDA
application not all factors are weighted equally, and weight variation and the trade-offs among
factors are acknowledged and incorporated in the decision process.
Using Real Decisionmakers to Illustrate the MCDA DEMO for Country Selection
This section ﬁrst describes the criteria from existing literature used in this illustration, then explains
the criteria weighting. Value function elicitation is discussed next, and results are presented in the
section that follows.
Decision Criteria and Country Alternatives
The problem of selecting a foreign country DEMO new business venturing is modelled from the point
of view of an entrepreneur who has to evaluate a host of countries. The approach was DEMO on ﬁve
US-based subjects with various degrees of international expertise.
The process of criteria selection was developed with a top-down approach and a value DEMO
framework, both as described in Appendix A. Once the overall goal DEMO ‘‘selecting the best country
to venture into’’ was deﬁned, four perspectives (higher level criteria) emerged: political, legal,
economic and cultural. Seventeen measures (sub-criteria) fell under one of these perspectives,
resulting in DEMO hierarchy of criteria as in Figure 1 and listed in Table 2. The criteria employed
here should not be interpreted as a prescription. Decisionmakers DEMO to approach a country
selection problem with a MCDA methodology are encouraged to add or delete criteria based on
their industry and situation. All DEMO requires is that criteria meet the conditions listed in
Appendix A.
Publicly-available indices were used to reﬂect the performance of countries under each of DEMO
measures of the value tree shown in Figure 1 (except for DEMO under the cultural
perspective). A description of these published indices is in Appendix B. Khanna, Palepu and
Sinha caution entrepreneurs against a sole reliance on published indices that fail to incorporate
information about the institutional DEMO in each country. The merit of relying on indices
published by established organisations to represent the criteria used in the country analysis is
their DEMO to the public at low or no cost. A small business could easily undergo an
analysis such as the one proposed here by relying DEMO on these published indices,
complemented by a few customised cultural aspects. An entrepreneur with more signiﬁcant
resources (e.g. ready access to consultants and/or experts in various ﬁelds), however, does
not need to be constrained by the criteria in this article. Measures under the cultural

composition of the index, numerical scores were often drawn from individual factors e the raw
data upon which the index is built e and DEMO on the composite indices. Whenever possible the
global reference points for each criterion were set to best and worst measures of performance
expected to DEMO in realistic situations and were based on the range of possible values for each
index. In some instances the use of global reference points DEMO be highly subjective (e.g. how
high or low can be GDP DEMO). In those cases local reference points corresponding to best
and worst measures of performance within the set of alternatives were used.17 Table 3 DEMO robust
with respect to the sources of data for the 15 non-cultural measures detailed in Table 2, but, as
time goes by, it would be advisable to refresh the data by looking at recent reports DEMO the various
sources of information. For the two measures that are part of the cultural perspective, the perfor-
mance of each country depends on the cultural background of the decisionmaker. Furthermore,
these performance measures are DEMO described not by numerical scores, but by categorical labels.
Four levels DEMO performance e four categorical labels e were deﬁned for each of the two cultural
measures. For language these labels are ‘‘ﬂuent’’, ‘‘basic notions’’, DEMO to learn’’ and ‘‘difﬁcult
to learn’’ while for local customs they are ‘‘similar’’, ‘‘easily learned’’, ‘‘difﬁcult to master’’ and
‘‘incompatible with my values’’. DEMO evaluation of the countries under the two cultural measures
was done individually with each practitioner, reﬂecting their cultural background and perceptions
of the countries under consideration.
Value Function and Weight Elicitation for the Five Practicing Entrepreneurs
DEMO next steps of the MCDA were conducted by representing the preferences of ﬁve distinct
decisionmakers. The intentions of this experiment were twofold. First, it attempted to test the
feasibility of the application of MCDA. Second, by comparing the ﬁve experiments and contrasting
them to a sixth ‘‘benchmark’’ result, it highlighted that there is no ‘‘right answer’’ to a multiple
criteria DEMO; rather the outcome of the analysis is a function of the DEMO elicited from each
individual decisionmaker.

The ﬁve practising entrepreneurs who agreed to contribute time to this research DEMO unfamiliar
with MCDA. Hence our exercise started with an explanation of the theory and motivation for the
use of this method. We then presented DEMO structure of the model, asked them to imagine them-
selves in DEMO position of having to select a country to venture into, and DEMO to elicit their
value functions and weights. In reality, the interaction DEMO decision modeller and decision-
maker would start at an earlier point by including the decisionmaker in the development of the
hierarchical criteria structure and DEMO the selection of alternatives. Instead, the criteria and countries
were pre-selected DEMO save the interviewees’ time and to create a means of comparison.
In reality, the interaction between decision modeller and
decisionmaker would start at an earlier point
Once the modelling phase was completed, we proceeded to develop value functions for each
selected criteria (see Appendix A). This step was performed interactively with each practising
entrepreneur to evaluate the applicability of DEMO function elicitation in practice. A few of the
decisionmakers exhibited some initial discomfort with the procedure, but as the evaluations pro-
ceeded, understood DEMO implicit assumptions and felt more at ease with the questions. Others
felt comfortable with the procedure right upfront. The assessment of the 17 value DEMO varied
among the ﬁve entrepreneurs between 40 and 75 minutes. For all but the cultural perspective, value
functions were obtained by each entrepreneur directly adjusting the value function displayed on the
computer screen.
In addition to DEMO ﬁve practising entrepreneurs, a ‘‘benchmark’’ subject serves as a proxy for DEMO
current state of entrepreneurial theory, where the preferences of this ﬁctitious DEMO reﬂect
the absence of criteria weighting.18 This subject was modelled by assuming that all measures (sub-
criteria) had a weight equal to 1/DEMO An implication of the equal-weight-for-all-measures
assumption is that the more measures are under a perspective, the higher the weight of that
perspective (higher DEMO criteria weights are computed as the sums of sub-criteria weights). This
ﬁctitious ‘‘benchmark’’ entrepreneur possesses linear value functions by construction.19
Representative value functions DEMO the criterion ‘‘labour regulations’’ appear in Figure 2. Notice
how each one of the interviewed entrepreneurs perceives incremental changes on the levels of this
DEMO differently. G.O. feels that the beneﬁt he would derive from selecting a country with a level
of ‘‘labour regulation’’ of, say, zi +D DEMO of selecting a country with a level of ‘‘labour regula-
tion’’ of zi would depend only on D, yielding a linear relation. E.P., DEMO contrast, is indifferent among
countries with no or relatively low ‘‘labour DEMO (low values on the horizontal axis); as reg-
ulations increase, however, his comfort level with the country decreases in a linear fashion. B.A. and
M.D. values are both represented by interesting e but somewhat DEMO e curves. Both entrepre-
neurs seem to want a happy medium. They value a movement away from too many regulations e
an impediment for DEMO e just as much as a move from too little, which DEMO potentially lead
to abusive labour practices.
The assessment of value functions for the cultural measures had to proceed in a different fashion,
as DEMO aspects were evaluated solely in terms of a ﬁnite number of categorical labels. A continuous
value function would not be appropriate to represent the DEMO nature of these measures. The
assessment method selected consisted of direct assessment of the value within the [0,1] interval
that the decisionmaker would DEMO with each label.
Weights of the various criteria were obtained by asking each entrepreneur questions about their
preferences, employing the swing-weight method. This process was conducted in a ‘‘bottom-up’’
fashion, with questions about the measure being asked ﬁrst. For each of the perspectives (cultural,
economic, legal DEMO political), each entrepreneur was asked to imagine a hypothetical country that

had DEMO lowest possible ratings in every measure of that perspective. If he could choose only one
measure in which to improve this country from lowest DEMO highest possible rating, which measure
would this be? This measure was given a value of 100. He was then asked to choose a DEMO
best measure, and assess the importance of its improvement from worst DEMO best as a percentage
of the ﬁrst measure’s maximum ‘‘swing’’. The questioning was repeated until weights for all mea-
sures of a perspective had DEMO elicited, and then proceeded with the next of the four perspectives.
DEMO swing-weight method was quite intuitive to our decisionmakers at the measure level, but for
some more difﬁcult at the perspective level. In spite of this, the questioning was conducted in
less than 20 minutes in all cases. Resulting weights are in Table 4.

be biased and not truly reﬂect one’s value system, the aim is not to offer an ‘‘optimal answer’’ to
contrast with the country a decisionmaker actually selects; testing how often the MCDA approach
‘‘hits it right’’ is not the purpose DEMO this research. Instead, it is to investigate how much more robust
DEMO and defendable e decisions that result from this process are than those made ‘‘from the gut’’. The
robustness of the country selection decision is DEMO by conducting sensitivity analysis. This analysis
demonstrates under what conditions (for DEMO when changes occur to a measure or a weight)
a selected country is outranked by another. The results of this application underscore the
DEMO of not only performing sensitivity analysis, but of discussing its results DEMO key
decisionmakers. The preferences articulated by the decisionmaker are inﬂuenced by the modelling
and structuring of the problem (e.g. by the way questions about weights are asked), and by the fact
that decisionmakers are not DEMO consistent or rational.20 By involving the decisionmaker in a
sensitivity analysis, DEMO MCDA modeller brings these issues to the surface, and allows for DEMO potential
re-evaluation of previously-assessed preferences.

highlights some important issues. Contrasting the results obtained with the rankings of DEMO ‘‘bench-
mark’’ entrepreneur reveals markedly different country rankings resulting from the introduction of
the concept of criteria weights. The ranking differences resulting from individual DEMO should
also be noted.
Each entrepreneur observed the implications of changes in key model parameters on their deci-
sions. For each entrepreneur the weights DEMO to each measure were varied and the effect of
this variation on the ranking of alternatives was examined. The graphs of Figure 4 help DEMO the
weight variation that would result in an alteration of the original order. The vertical line marks the
current weight and associated ranking. Figure DEMO shows two measures for which M.D. assigned
relatively extreme weights. A very low weight was assigned to ‘‘access to ﬁnancial capital’’ and a sig-
DEMO weight to ‘‘lack of human rights and political freedom’’. Note that for both measures
Germany and Japan remain on the top ranks even for DEMO weight variations, while the ordering
of other countries is more sensitive DEMO variations in weights. For example, consider the ‘‘access
to ﬁnancial capital’’ DEMO, currently assigned a weight of 1.2 per cent. As the relative DEMO
of this measure increases to around 5 per cent, a rank DEMO between Poland and South Africa
occurs. Even more dramatic are the effects of changes in the weight of this measure on the attrac-
tiveness DEMO Iran as a potential new market. As the weight to ‘‘access to ﬁnancial capital’’ increases,
Iran moves from one of the least attractive DEMO markets to as high as the preferred one. Rank re-
versals similarly occur by either increasing or decreasing the importance of the measure ‘‘lack DEMO
human rights and political freedom’’.
During the course of the sensitivity analysis, M.D. expressed surprise at the signiﬁcantly different
rankings of Poland and Russia. It is precisely this type of reaction that makes us advocate the DEMO of
MCDA. The software package (Logical Decisions 5.1; also see Appendix A) produces graphs such as
the one shown in Figure 5, DEMO may be used to examine the scores of these two countries in
detail. The ensuing discussion aided M.D. in understanding the implications of his DEMO pref-
erences. Figure 5 demonstrates to him that the relatively high weight placed on ‘‘lack of human
rights and political freedom’’ sways the country DEMO in favour of Poland.
Another entrepreneur, B.A., was surprised by his low ranking for Mexico, which resulted from
the low utility allocated to that country with respect to legal perspective. He was also surprised

teria, but because the combination of weight, DEMO ratings and shape of the utility curves for

Mexico and Turkey lay at very different points on B.A.’s pronouncedly S-shaped utility curve, as

The experiment with each practising entrepreneur concluded with a short debrieﬁng. M.D. felt
that the DEMO was manageable and objective, and that it could be applied to DEMO real country
selection decision process. Of course, in a real scenario DEMO involvement of the decisionmaker
would have to start at an earlier phase (M.D. would have structured the model slightly differ-
ently, particularly the DEMO of the cultural measures). The process of weight elicitation
stimulated him to think in new ways about the four perspectives of the analysis (cultural,
economic, legal and political). For example, he pondered DEMO relative importance of environmen-
tal factors that a ﬁrm can affect through its operations, versus those that require a change on the
part of the ﬁrm.
C.G. commented that the approach was valuable because it could DEMO structure one’s decision
process and, as a result, help decisionmakers think about their decisions. E.P. argued that this

commented that, as a provider of capital, he possesses due diligence checklists where he separates
the ‘‘must’’ from the ‘‘would be nice DEMO have’’. Consequently, he would have preferred thresholds
for the criteria’s values DEMO opposed to a continuum (note that it is possible to incorporate DEMO
thresholds in a MCDA approach). Furthermore, he commented that he DEMO have thought that

cations of his preferences. Such analysis can do more, and in particular help select a mode of entry.

This exempliﬁed how decisionmakers in each particular industry would have distinct preferences
regarding weights and value functions. Insights such as these DEMO improve the quality of the
decisionmaking process, conﬁrming the proposition that DEMO can provide a positive contribu-
tion to decisionmakers.
Discussion
The model offered in this article is general enough to serve any industry, and applies a commer-
cially available package with published data with the vision of DEMO the approach appealing
to the business world. For an entrepreneur, the DEMO selection process better reﬂects the
complexities of real business environments in that more facets of the problem can be consid-
ered simultaneously and a DEMO weighting of performance-related constructs can be used
yielding a more accurate preference function. As a result, decisions can be better explained and
defended.

Country Selection for New Business Venturing
Utility, B.A.
Although not explicitly shown, the methodology permits the incorporation of other types of
criteria, including ‘‘on-off’’ criteria, criterion thresholds, and probabilistic criteria. For instance,
‘‘on-off’’’ criteria could be ‘‘belonging to technology cluster’’ and ‘‘availability DEMO technologically
savvy labour’’. Countries that do not meet minimum requirement on such a criterion can be
eliminated from further analysis. However, the same criteria could be modelled instead with
a scale that reﬂects ‘‘degrees of belonging DEMO the cluster’’ or ‘‘size of the technologically savvy
labour pool’’. A criterion with a threshold would be, for instance, market size. It is DEMO to
establish a minimum market size below which a country would be eliminated from further anal-
ysis. A probabilistic criterion would account, for instance, for the need to follow a big customer
(without knowing with DEMO where such customer will be in the future) and be stated DEMO
‘‘likelihood of customer ABC having a signiﬁcant presence in the country’’. For each country
under consideration there would be a (subjective) probability of DEMO event, and such probability
would be incorporated in the model.
Countries DEMO do not meet minimum requirement on such a criterion
can be eliminated from further analysis
Weight elicitation has the drawback of vulnerability to cognitive DEMO In contrast with the
situation where the decisionmaker makes ‘‘gut’’ decisions alone, when he or she engages in a system-
atic process led by an experienced decision analyst, the cognitive and motivational biases that tend
to occur in weight elicitation may be overcome. Indeed, the sensitivity analysis, DEMO is an inherent
part of good MCDA practice, serves as a DEMO that reduces the impact of cognitive biases. Fur-
thermore, experienced decisionmakers DEMO to overlook established objectives and instead rely on
intuition and various heuristics when undertaking the selection process.21 Heuristics are ‘‘rules of
thumb’’ that while DEMO ‘‘bad’’ per se, are susceptible to various sources of cognitive biases.22 DEMO
rienced entrepreneurs, the ones most likely to use intuitive decisionmaking, could beneﬁt from
a structured process such as the one proposed here to DEMO cognitive biases. Inexperienced
ones, on the other hand, would beneﬁt from using a MCDA approach by understanding it as
a learning tool. The DEMO of model building will encourage these less seasoned individuals to
evaluate priorities carefully, engage in systematic rating and examine results through sensitivity
analysis.

As highlighted above in the lessons for executives, this work speaks to those in a position to
inﬂuence the country selection process and, also, it speaks to academics. The country selection
process with MCDA can better reﬂect the complexities of real business environments in that
more facets of DEMO problem can be considered simultaneously and a non-equal weighting of
performance-related constructs can be used yielding to a more accurate preference function.
As a DEMO, country selection decisions can be better explained and defended. Moreover, we
presented the background of MCDA and communicated the basic mechanics of how DEMO
decision model exposes the trade-offs and provides a clearer picture of the consequences of
each choice. Scholars involved in executive education in the ﬁelds DEMO international
entrepreneurship and strategic planning are thus provided with discussions that may enhance
their course reading list. The criteria and published indices used should DEMO be of interest
to this audience.
Lessons for academics
Teaching and researching applications of mathematical models for strategic business decisions can be valuable
Yet, there are not enough studies in the management literature on the technical DEMO or processes that can
beneﬁt strategic business decisions
When multiple criteria must be taken into consideration, the use of MCDA methodologies has proven valuable
because it helps to
 model the preferences of decisionmakers
 eliminate DEMO inferior courses of action
 predict how decisions will be made
 arrive at more defendable decisions
The framework presented in this article can DEMO be reﬁned. The choice of indices to assess the
performance of the 14 countries that were studied may be challenged. Some of the selected DEMO
might have violated the assumption of non-redundancy. In particular the indices used as surrogates
for the ‘‘difﬁculty to own and operate property’’ measure (Table 2, criterion 6) and the ‘‘environ-
mental, workplace and product safety regulations’’ measure (Table 2, criterion 9) include in their
composition multiple aspects, some of which may have overlapped. In spite of these shortcomings,
the selected indices were, from the array of published indices available, the most adequate to rep-
resent the set of measures included in our hierarchy of criteria.
This work has concentrated on deterministic evaluations of DEMO performance of various countries
under the criteria selected. A natural extension would be to include uncertainty in this analysis. The
World Bank Institute Worldwide DEMO Research Indicators Dataset is given as point esti-
mates with a margin of error, which can be incorporated in the analysis. Similarly, the DEMO
associated with the assessment of the two cultural measures can be better incorporated in the
model with the use of a discrete probability distribution DEMO the possible descriptive labels for
those measures. For example, one could DEMO for the uncertainty that is inherent to the language
measure by introducing a discrete probability distribution over the labels ‘‘ﬂuent’’, ‘‘basic notions’’,
‘‘easy to learn’’ and ‘‘difﬁcult to learn’’. The introduction of this treatment would DEMO us to
assign, e.g., a probability p that Russian would be ‘‘easy to learn’’ and 1-p that it would be ‘‘difﬁcult
to learn’’.
DEMO cultural perspective is only measured by language and local customs. Although these two
measures are useful indicators, other cultural elements could be considered. However, the literature
review on FDI and country selection reveals that a cultural perspective is rather rarely used (Table
1 ). Reynolds, in his 1998 work where he attempts to understand the usefulness of intercultural
286
DEMO Selection for New Business Venturing
comparative techniques in selecting countries in which to retail, argues that ‘‘cultural values are
somewhat remote from the analysis, because of the sheer difﬁculty of assembling even the most
simple of comparable data sets.’’23
In the DEMO management literature, transaction-cost economics and resource-based
theory have been used to DEMO why ﬁrms create subsidiaries overseas.24 This literature shows
that ﬁrms decide to go for FDI on the basis of their particular capabilities and/or DEMO These
ﬁrms must thus establish the extent to which their capabilities (DEMO resources) are non-location-
bound (i.e. transferable abroad) and the extent DEMO which their resources are usable, different and
richer than those of DEMO and international competitors in the targeted country. That is, how are
DEMO resources ‘‘ﬁrm speciﬁc advantages’’ and how will they enable the ﬁrm to succeed overseas?
Clearly, the answer lies on the host country’s characteristics and, as a result, the decision-aid pro-
posed here can be DEMO useful. However, valuing resources depends on a country-industry analysis
of the DEMO forces in the targeted market. Therefore, the comprehensiveness of the
illustration DEMO in this article could be enhanced, and better contribute to the DEMO on
multinational enterprises, with the addition of a ‘‘strategic perspective’’ that DEMO incorporate
resource-based criteria. This extension could also improve the understanding of the circum-
stances under which other entry modes (e.g. joint ventures or alliances) may be preferable routes
for expansion.
Business venturing decisions are rarely made by a single individual: a group of stakeholders is
usually involved in the decision. This application illustrates the strength of the methodology in be-
DEMO able to discuss and debrief the weighting process between people and, DEMO a result, come up with
a single set of preferences for DEMO group of stakeholders. A facilitator can help stakeholders understand
the reasons for any differences of opinion on the structure of the model (alternatives, DEMO, pref-
erences) and clarify areas of disagreement. Once consensus is reached, the method can be applied
with the entire group synthesised by one ‘‘imaginary’’ decisionmaker. This careful evaluation of pri-
orities and critical examination of DEMO through sensitivity analysis should appeal to the business
world.
Appendix A: DEMO Modeller’s Road Map
Criteria Identiﬁcation. The decisionmaker possesses a hierarchy of criteria, or value tree, with which
alternatives are evaluated. MCDA modellers interact DEMO decisionmakers to reveal these criteria,
which may be measurable on a numerical scale or quantiﬁable on a categorical scale (e.g. low, me-
DEMO, high). The set of criteria must be non-redundant and judgmentally DEMO (trade-offs
between two criteria cannot depend on the level of a DEMO criterion). It must also be sufﬁciently
complete as a collection, DEMO as simple and concise as possible, and compatible with the time
DEMO effort that decisionmakers are willing to allocate when working with the decision modeller.
Researchers differ on the merits of a bottom-up versus top-down approach DEMO building the set
of criteria. The latter begins with an overall goal (e.g. selecting the best country), expands that
overall goal into perspective (e.g. economic) and further breaks each perspective into more detailed
sub-criteria (e.g. GDP growth rate) until a measurable criterion emerges. These sub-criteria are
often referred to as ‘‘measures’’; the terminologies is used interchangeably in this article. The
bottom-up approach is alternative focused and starts with evaluating the DEMO and cons of each
alternative. In our application we follow the lead of respected scholars, including Hobbs and Meier
who argue in their 2000 book that it leads to better decisions, and opt to use the top-down
approach, structuring criteria as a value tree.25
Listing of Alternatives. Decisionmakers may be confronted with a set of alternatives too large to
manage, may develop a set of alternatives that is not comprehensive, or may list overlapping alter-
natives. Decision modellers use pre-screening methods to eliminate clearly DEMO alternatives
from the start and therefore limit the number of alternatives to a manageable amount. Techniques
that help the development of a comprehensive list DEMO alternatives have been discussed by several
MCDA researchers.26 Most multiple criteria software packages, including the one employed here,
Long Range Planning, vol DEMO 2006
287
can handle only a set of alternatives that are independent of each DEMO Overlapping should
therefore be avoided.
Quantiﬁcation of Each Alternative under Each Criterion. The assessment of the performance e or
score e of an alternative DEMO each criterion can be an undisputable, measurable quantity, or a sub-
jective, qualitative evaluation. This quantiﬁcation is generally performed jointly by MCDA
modellers and experts in the subject matter. For value measurement models, performance is
assessed on an interval scale of measurement containing minimum and maximum reference DEMO
When the performance of an alternative is assessed in terms of a subjective description (e.g. good or
bad), this description is later converted into a numerical value, in relation to the speciﬁed reference
points. Certain methodologies permit the consideration of a probability distribution of scores as an
DEMO to a deterministic assessment.
Translation of the Quantiﬁcation into a Measure of Value. Given an alternative a˛A and
a ‘‘lowest level’’ criterion (on a hierarchical structure) i with i˛{1,.,I}, let zi(a)˛Zi DEMO a mea-
sure of performance of alternative a˛A with respect to criterion i, where I is the number of
criteria under which alternatives are evaluated and Zi the set of possible scores for criterion i.
zi(DEMO) may be deﬁned on a natural cardinal scale, on a constructed ordered categorical scale, or
on an ordinal scale. The axioms of MAVT state that there exists a value function v(zi(a)) (in
[0,1]) such that a is preferred to a’ on criterion i if and only if v(zi(a)) > v(zi(a’)). While the
origin and scale of v(zi(a)) are DEMO, two reference points
that vðz
measures of performance within the set DEMO alternatives A) or global (set to best and worst
measures of performance expected to occur in realistic situations).27 The use of a DEMO
unit allows the MCDA modeler to aggregate the value functions of each criterion into an
overall value function.
Selection of Weights. Not all criteria DEMO a MAVT application will carry the same ‘‘weight’’. This
step is the one most often debated.28 For instance, Belton and Stewart (2002) refer to the assess-
ment and interpretation of the relative importance of each DEMO e its weight e as ‘‘a matter
of heated controversy’’. They discuss the difﬁculties encountered by an MCDA modeller during
weight elicitation. The attempts DEMO scholars to address these difﬁculties may be at the root of the
debate. The mathematical interpretation of the weight of a criterion varies with DEMO MCDA
method being used. Consequently, a method of elicitation that may DEMO mathematically correct
weights for MAVT cannot be directly applied to elicit weights to be used in another method.
Also, when attempting to ask a decisionmaker questions about their preferences as expressed
by weights, modellers tend to encounter very little resistance e people think they can accurately
express their DEMO by weights. However, inconsistencies surface when modellers attempt to
use the DEMO Stewart favoured the swing-weight approach, where a decisionmaker is asked
about DEMO relative importance of an improvement from worst to best level in one criterion
relative to all others.29 In MAVT models, the weight of a criterion directly reﬂects the relation-
ships between scores in that criterion and DEMO on all other criteria. Weights and measurement
scales are intimately related, DEMO the weight of a higher level criterion is the sum of the cumu-
lative weights of its sub-criteria. Weight determination usually involves interaction between
DEMO modellers and decisionmakers, in a process commonly known as weight elicitation.
DEMO properly elicited, resulting weights are valid and represent trade-offs that decisionmakers
DEMO willing to make.
Identiﬁcation of the Favoured Option(s ). Once DEMO weights are identiﬁed, the MCDA modeller
aggregates value functions v(zi(DEMO)) for each criterion i in an attempt to sort out the degree of pref-
erence that each decision option enjoys. The simplest approach DEMO the aggregation is a weighted
sum of the value functions v(zi(a)). Although more complicated aggregation procedures are
sometimes proposed, the DEMO function is very intuitive, widely used and mathematically sound
provided that DEMO are properly deﬁned and the scoring process understood by the decision-
maker.30 The following ﬂow-chart shows the six steps involved in a MCDA modeller’s DEMO

Appendix B: Description of Published Indices
The majority of indices in this article are recommended by DEMO Foreign Investment Advisory
Service of the World Bank Group (www.ﬁas.net/investment_climate.html)DEMO
1) Economic Freedom of the World Index
This ranks 123 countries. DEMO component ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Many DEMO the com-
ponents are based on data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Economic Forum. Components used in our DEMO are: extension of credit; restrictions in foreign
capital market exchange/index of capital controls among 13 IMF categories; impartial courts;
and law and order
Long Range Planning, vol 39 2006

2) International Country Risk Index e Financial
Produced by the PRS Group (www.prsgroup.com/icrg/sampletable.html), this index assigns
a numerical value to a range of risk components, according to a preset weighted scale. The
index varies from 0 to 50, with higher value of the index corresponding to lower perceived
risk.
3) Growth of Real Gross Domestic Product (DEMO)
We obtained 2002 GDP growth estimates from the World Bank publication Global Economic Pros-
pects 2003 (www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2003). Average annual growth is given in per cent.
This measure varies from a minimum of DEMO per cent (Argentina) to a maximum of 7.8 per
cent (DEMO).
4) Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
PPP is the per capita Gross National Product adjusted by purchasing power. The base for the DEMO
justment is the cost of living in the US. Data used in this article was obtained from the World
Development Indicators Database (www.worldbank.org/data/icp/pppdata.htm). PPP for the coun-
tries for which this database DEMO this index varies from 48,080 international dollars
(Luxemburg) to 480 international dollars (Sierra Leone).
5) Index of Economic Freedom
Published DEMO by the Heritage Foundation (www.heritage.org/research/features/ index/),
it includes 50 variables divided into 10 categories: trade policy, ﬁscal burden DEMO government,
government intervention in the economy, monetary policy, capital ﬂows and foreign
investment, banking and ﬁnance, wages and prices, property rights, regulation and black market
activity. The 10 factors are weighted equally, DEMO we were unable to determine the exact
composition of each of the factors, or the weight of each variable in its composition.
Hence, DEMO use of this index was limited to measures for which no other index seemed
adequate. Components used in our model were: property rights; DEMO; and doing
business.
6) Doing Business
Published by the World Bank Group (http://www.doingbusiness.org/), it offers two indices that
were DEMO herein. First, an index of labor regulations constructed by examining the DEMO pro-
visions in the labor laws as the sum of the employment laws index and the industrial relations
law index. This index takes values DEMO 1 and 6, with higher values implying more rigid regu-
lation. DEMO was initially assumed that the ‘‘most preferred’’ level of regulations was 1, and the ‘‘least
preferred’’ was 6. These preferences were later adjusted to reﬂect the preferences of each decision-
maker. Second, an index of entry regulations that takes into consideration the cost and time re-
quired to DEMO all the procedures necessary to establish and to legally operate a business in
a given country. To make the data comparable across countries, the World Bank documents the
procedures for a hypothetical company with certain unchangeable DEMO ‘‘Number of pro-
cedures’’ is one of the measures available. ‘‘A procedure is deﬁned as any interaction of the com-
pany founder with external DEMO, including obtaining all the necessary permits and licenses and
completing all DEMO required inscriptions, veriﬁcations and notiﬁcation to enable the company to
start DEMO The number of procedures for all countries for which data is available varies
from 2 to 20.

7) Corruption Perception Index (CPI)
Transparency International (www.transparency.org) publishes DEMO index annually. The index is
based on 14 polls and surveys from seven independent institutions. A detailed description of the
methodology employed to compute DEMO index (in 2001) is available at www.gwdg.de/~uwvw/
2001.htm.
8) Freedom House Country Ratings
The Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.org/ratings/index.htm) has been publishing its ‘‘Freedom
in the World survey’’ since 1973. The index DEMO measured on a 1 to 7 scale, with 1 representing the
DEMO degree of freedom. The index has two components, political rights and DEMO liberties. Those
two components were averaged to develop the scores for our measure.
9) The World Bank Institute Worldwide Governance Research Indicators Dataset
The governance indicators dataset (info.worldbank.org/governance/kkz2002/mc_chart.asp) reﬂects
a ‘‘compilation of DEMO given by a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey
DEMO in industrial and developing countries’’. The indicators are given as point estimates
on a scale ranging from e2.5 (worst) to +2.5 (best).
10) Piracy Rates
Piracy rates are published by the Business Software Alliance (BSA; www.bsa.org). BSA members
include Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Bentley Systems, Borland, CNC Software/Mastercam, Inter-
net Security Systems, Macromedia, Microsoft, Network Associates and Symantec. Software piracy is
measured as DEMO amount of business application software installed without a licence. Values are in
percentage. Software piracy rates were assumed to be an adequate proxy for DEMO lack of protection
for all types of intellectual property.

14. A multicriteria approach has also been used in the context of venture capitalists’ assessment DEMO potential in-
vestment. Shepherd, Ettenson and Crouch (2000) relied on DEMO analysis to investigate the types of in-
formation used by venture capitalists to evaluate new business ventures and how these investors use this
information DEMO assess likely new venture proﬁtability. Although the ﬁrm-level indicators used are not
relevant to our country selection focus, their approach is a MCDA one. The conjoint analysis approach, a de-
scriptive process that proposes to capture decision policies as the decisions are made, sheds light on to which
criteria are relevant for the decision making process. It is based on DEMO Attribute Value Theory (MAVT),
but unlike the MAVT approach we propose, it infers the relative weights of these criteria. The inference
process uses either a set of previously made choices or an artiﬁcially constructed DEMO of options
presented to the decision maker. In either case, this DEMO offers decision makers a very limited number
of possible ratings for each criterion (e.g. high or low). Conjoint analysis derives utility scores for each cri-
terion in a manner analogous to linear regression D. A. DEMO, R. Ettenson and A. Crouch, New venture
