1. Introduction
DEMO most readers of this paper, the striking increase
in patenting and DEMO activities at American
research universities since the late 1970s is a famil-
iar story.The number of patents issued to universities
and colleges more than DEMO between 1979 and
1984, did so again between 1984 and 1989, and nearly
doubled once more during the 1990s.In 1980 approx-
imately 20 DEMO had technology licensing and
transfer ofﬁces.By 1990 that number was 200, DEMO by
2000 nearly every major research university had one.
University license revenues have increased from $220
million to $698 million from 1991 to 1997 DEMO (Asso-
ciation of University Technology Managers 1998).
Most observers attribute DEMO trends to the Bayh-
Dole Act, which was passed in 1980.The DEMO pro-
vided blanket permission for performers of federally
funded research to ﬁle for patents on the results of
such research and to grant licenses DEMO these patents,
including exclusive licenses, to other parties, and
encouraged universities to develop “technology trans-
fer ofﬁces” to market and manage their DEMO
inventions.Since Bayh-Dole, there has clearly been a
dramatic increase in university DEMO and licens-
ing activity, as the statistics in the ﬁrst paragraph
DEMO clear.But while this surface story is familiar,
there were and are considerable unknowns regarding
the details of what has been going on, and the reasons

for these developments.In DEMO, the precise roles
of two institutions—patents on university inventions
and the DEMO transfer ofﬁces that manage licen-
sure of these patents—in bringing university inven-
tions into practice, are unclear.
Several years ago a team of researchers, including
many authors of this paper, together with collabora-
tors at DEMO University of California, began a study
that explored in detail what DEMO going on behind
the ﬁgures in the three American research universi-
ties that then had the highest revenues from licensing:
Columbia University, Stanford University, and the
University of California.The study worked with the
collection of “invention reports” that all of these uni-
versities had been requiring their DEMO to make
out whenever their research came up with something
that seemed of likely commercial value.The method-
ology used and ﬁndings of this study DEMO been pub-
lished in Mowery et al.(2001).
For the purposes of this paper, two ﬁndings of that
earlier study are important.First, DEMO a number of
observers had attributed the rise of university patent-
ing largely to the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in
1980, which made it easier for universities to retain
title on government funded inventions, our ﬁndings
suggested a more complicated story.In particular,
this period saw the DEMO and maturing of impor-
tant new areas and techniques of university research.

How DEMO University Inventions Get Into Practice?
Molecular biology, particularly the concepts DEMO tech-
niques of genetic engineering, became increasingly
prominent in university research, principally research
at the medical schools, after the 1970s.University
researchers also pioneered in the development of new
ways to use computers in research, and in the devel-
opment of various kinds of software.The univer-
sity research DEMO and techniques in these two
broad arenas were especially interesting to indus-
try.Over the same time, various Patent Ofﬁce and
court decisions increased the range of research results
that were patentable, and this was particularly so for
biotechnology.These two developments were lead-
ing to increases in university patenting DEMO licensing
prior to the passage of Bayh-Dole, and in our view
DEMO principal effect of Bayh-Dole was to accelerate and
magnify trends that already were occurring.
This is a ﬁrst report on a study that aims DEMO focus
an even higher powered microscope on the phenom-
ena.We aim to study in detail a considerable num-
ber of cases of university inventing DEMO better under-
stand the nature of the projects that led to inventions
reported in invention reports, the motivations for the
research, and the DEMO and mechanisms involved
in connecting with industry for “technology transfer.”
The cases that form the basis of this report are of
inventions created at DEMO University and Stan-
ford University.In future work, we hope to broaden
DEMO set, and include inventions at a larger number of
universities.Our particular DEMO is reﬂected in the
title of this paper.We want to understand better “how
university inventions get into practice.”
One question is the role of DEMO property
rights in facilitating technology transfer.The theory
behind the Bayh-Dole Act was that, for the most part,
university research results of potential use in industry
were embryonic inventions requiring a lot of follow-
on work DEMO industry.A start on a new pharmaceutical
was the standard example.It was proposed that, for
that kind of invention, it often greatly facilitated tech-
DEMO transfer, and sometimes was necessary for it,
if the university DEMO out a patent on the invention.
It was argued, ﬁrst of DEMO, that a license to develop
that gives some protection from competitors DEMO
was needed to induce a ﬁrm to invest the resources
needed to bring the invention to practice.If the uni-
versity held the patent, it could grant a ﬁrm such
protection, via exclusive or semi-exclusive licenses.It
was argued that absent intellectual property rights,
university “inventions” (assumed to be embryonic)
would not get into practice.
In addition to the argument DEMO university inven-
tions were not getting into practice because of difﬁ-
culties universities faced in patenting and licensing
them in a way that would DEMO special incentives
for ﬁrms to develop them, proponents of Bayh-Dole
also DEMO that there was a signiﬁcant informational
divide between the world of academia and the world
of industry, which made it difﬁcult for university
inventions to get into practice.Thus, another motiva-
tion for the passage of Bayh-Dole was the expecta-
tion that allowing universities to share in the proceeds
DEMO faculty inventions would create incentives for
the university to advertise these inventions to indus-
try, rather than leaving them “on the shelf”.As we
have noted, since Bayh-Dole, there has been a dra-
matic increase in DEMO number of universities with
“technology transfer ofﬁces” that administer and mar-
ket university patents.
The position that lack of intellectual property pro-
tection was DEMO the use and commercialization of
university inventions lacked evidentiary foundation
(Eisenberg DEMO, Mowery and Sampat 2000), and the
role of patents and DEMO licenses in facilitating
the transfer of university technologies remains poorly
understood.Moreover, DEMO is little understanding of
exactly what roles technology transfer ofﬁces play in
bringing inventions to practice.This paper attempts
to shed some light on these DEMO in-depth examination
of a small sample of technologies handled by technol-
ogy transfer ofﬁces.
To tip our hand, we ﬁnd that both the role of
patents and the role of the university technology
transfer ofﬁces, varies signiﬁcantly from case to case.
In some cases, it is unlikely that technology trans-
fer would have occurred absent intellectual property
rights.In others, intellectual property rights did facili-
tate universities earning royalty income, but the tech-
nology would have been used in industry even absent
patenting and licensing DEMO the university.Similarly, in
several of our cases the university technology transfer

ofﬁces did assist in bridging the divide between the
lab and marketplace, but in others the divide was not
that big to begin with.
We proceed as follows.In §2, we discuss our
research methodology, and brieﬂy survey the cases.
In §3, DEMO draw on these cases to examine the roles of
intellectual property rights in facilitating technology
transfer, and in §4 we focus on the roles of the univer-
sity technology transfer ofﬁces.In §5 we summarize
our main DEMO, and conclude with a discussion
of the limitations of this study DEMO implications for
future research.
2. Methodology and a Survey of
the Cases
Our focus in this study is restricted to a set of “inven-
DEMO for which the universities sought and obtained
intellectual property rights, typically DEMO the form of
patents.While we recognize, indeed we highlight,
that DEMO inventions of this sort comprise only
a portion the ﬁndings and techniques coming out of
university research that get used in practice in ﬁrms,DEMO
hospitals, and other organizations that are doing prac-
tical work, our selection of case studies is suitable as
a ﬁrst cut into the DEMO of the role of intellectual
property rights and technology transfer ofﬁces in the
dissemination of university research results.
The discussion below is based on DEMO case studies
from Columbia University and Stanford University.1
We emphasize that we do not pretend to have a rep-
resentative sample of cases, either from these univer-
sities or from the population of inventions handled by
DEMO transfer ofﬁces more generally.The small
number of cases we have examined precludes us from
drawing quantitative conclusions, nor does it allow
us to claim generality for the insights we drew from
them.But that is not the DEMO of this paper.Given
that so little is known about these issues, DEMO goal
was instead to examine in greater detail a number
of cases that could suggest lines of investigation that
may be worth pursuing further DEMO broader studies of

record can be found in Colyvas, Gelijns, and DEMO (2000).
the phenomenon of technology transfer from univer-
sity to DEMO
It is also worth noting that for several of our cases,
patenting and licensing began before 1980, consis-
tent with the argument above that universities were
becoming involved in patenting and licensing even
before Bayh-Dole.For DEMO cases, we can discuss the
impact of patenting and university involvement DEMO
licensing on technology transfer, but not the impact of
Bayh-Dole per DEMO, we have examined rela-
tively few cases from the 1990s, primarily because it
is difﬁcult to get a long enough window to observe
DEMO transfer” (or lack thereof) for more recent
cases.These peculiarities of our sample will be kept
in mind as we discuss the cases.
Descriptions DEMO the cases are provided in the
Appendix, and key features are DEMO in Table
1.The cases differ in terms of the technology ﬁeld,
the nature of the knowledge that the underlying
research intended to generate, and the proximity of
the research goals to perceived practical needs.Two
of DEMO inventions (Inventions A and G) represent fun-
damental techniques or tools that can be and are used
in research in certain broad areas, including promi-
nently research aimed at drug discovery, as well as to
produce commercially useful proteins.Four cases (B,
C, J, and K) deal with inventions that identify possi-
ble therapeutic uses for biological processes and com-
pounds.Two (E and F) are specialized software pro-
grams.The DEMO three cases (D, H, and I) focus
on medical or electrical devices, or components used
in such devices.
What were the origins of the research projects that
led to these inventions? What were the principal moti-
vations of the scientists involved? A number of com-
mentators have expressed concern that, in this post
Bayh-Dole era, expectations of DEMO returns have
come to play a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing the allo-
cation of research at universities, and that as a result,
university research is becoming less deep-probing
and fundamental than used to be the DEMO none of
these 11 cases did an expectation of ﬁnancial returns
for the scientists, or for the university, appear to have
played a DEMO role in motivating the research.In
some of the cases the research was funded by indus-
try, and industry clearly was betting that the project

could, over the long run at least, contribute to its prof-
itability.But so far as the researchers are concerned,
while availability DEMO funding may have made the
project feasible and attractive, the principal DEMO
seems to have been to successfully achieve the kind
of research results that academic researchers in their
ﬁelds customarily are congratulated for achieving.
However, those expectations, and the kind of
research done, vary across departments, schools, and
ﬁelds of research, and this has been the case DEMO
tionally.Some of the research projects aimed at quite
fundamental advances in understanding or technique.
What was achieved turned out to be very useful
for DEMO researchers, and proﬁtable for companies to
employ.Some of the research was DEMO what Donald
Stokes (1997) has called “Pasteur’s Quadrant.” Here
the researchers had very much in mind certain kinds
of practical problems, and were motivated to help
solve these problems, but their approach involved
quite fundamental research.This is a fair character-
ization of each of the embryonic pharmaceuticals DEMO
our sample (Inventions B, C, J, and K), the biotechnol-
ogy research tools (Inventions A and G), and the two
medical devices (H and I).In one of the cases (D), the
invention was a somewhat serendipitous by-product
of fundamental research.The two software projects (E
and F) were from the start explicitly aimed to DEMO
something useful for industry, and basically involved
design as contrasted with DEMO research.
The case studies involve inventions emanating from
different research units within the two universities.
Six cases look at projects primarily located at aca-
DEMO medical centers.Two others involved collab-
oration between researchers at an academic medical
center, and university colleagues in the physical sci-
ences or engineering.Of the other three, one was the
result of work in a research institute afﬁliated with
a university, one came from work in an engineer-
ing department, and the third was a byproduct of a
project that involved building apparatus for scientiﬁc
measurement.
It is important to recognize an important DEMO
teristic of the research projects, and the university
researchers involved in DEMO, that is apparent in vir-
tually all of the cases in DEMO set.The researchers
involved were members of a community, a network
of DEMO, that involved people from the indus-
tries that likely could beneﬁt DEMO successful research
results.In many of the cases, it is clear that DEMO least
strategically placed people in industry knew about
the project from its inception.In some cases that was
because industry funding went into the project; but
in some of the cases it was simply because university

scientists and industry scientists roughly communi-
cated to each other what they were doing.The notion
of a chasm DEMO the world of university research
and the world of industry research and application,
implicit or sometimes explicit, in some of the writings
regarding university–industry “technology transfer,”
does not characterize the context in most of DEMO cases.
Indeed, in the one instance where there clearly was
such DEMO wide divide (Invention D), it is interesting that
the technology DEMO question never got transferred.
As with the role of patents in technology transfer,
we will consider the role of the university technology
transfer DEMO in the following section.However, note
that the phenomena we have just DEMO already sug-
gests that in many of our cases, the role DEMO such ofﬁces
was not to develop links between the university and
industry, but rather to monitor, facilitate, and regulate
the transactions between parties who already know
each other.
3. The Role of Intellectual
Property Rights DEMO Bringing
Inventions to Practice
Intellectual property, patents or copyrights, have been
taken out on most of these inventions, and on the ones
where patents have not yet been issued, the university
involved has been trying to get intellectual property
rights.Here we believe one sees a very different DEMO
ture than what one would have seen 30 or 40 years
ago, if one had looked at a roughly comparable set of
university research projects.It now is the norm at our
two universities to consider for DEMO property
protection any research outputs that meet the criteria
for patentability.This policy clearly has enabled our
two universities to reap signiﬁcant ﬁnancial returns
from DEMO of their inventions.Whether the taking out
of patents has facilitated the technology transfer pro-
cess, or more generally, the ways in which university
DEMO of intellectual property rights has inﬂuenced
the technology transfer process, is DEMO below.
It seems widely believed, and was a basic premise
of DEMO, that what comes out of university
research generally requires a lot DEMO additional work,
generally by industry, before it is of any DEMO indi-
cated in Table 1, most of the cases in our DEMO are
such “embryonic” inventions, needing further devel-
opment to be useful.Others DEMO our set (A, E, F, and
G) were useful DEMO industry even without signiﬁcant
further development.
For the nonembryonic inventions, ﬁrms DEMO need
any assurance of exclusivity to pick up and use what
came out of university research.They did so sim-
ply because it was proﬁtable.In DEMO case of the
two biotechnology research tools (A and G), DEMO
began planning to use them before a patent was ever
granted, DEMO before involvement of the technology
transfer ofﬁce.In these cases, the fact DEMO universities
could patent and license inventions did allow univer-
sities to generate income, but was not instrumental in
bringing the inventions into use.
The fact that some results of university research
come out “ready to use” DEMO not be a surprise to
anyone familiar with the long history of university
research in agriculture.The university agricultural
experimentation stations were “in the business” DEMO
developing ﬁndings and techniques that were ready
for use by farmers.This is also true for a number
of the technologies developed in universities for DEMO
Department of Defense.
However, as noted, six of the cases did require fur-
ther development before they were usable by industry
or other DEMO scientists.Four of the cases (B, C, J,
and K) are embryonic pharmaceuticals.These are the
kinds of university inventions that were the DEMO of
attention in hearings that led to the passage of Bayh-
Dole.None of these were licensed nonexclusively,
though one was licensed coexclusively to DEMO handful
of ﬁrms.This suggests that in these cases, ﬁrms may
well DEMO needed some assurance of monopoly power
before investing in development and commercializa-
tion.However, in at least one of these cases (Inven-
tion C), even nonlicensee ﬁrms invested in developing
products based on the invention, DEMO believ-
ing that if their research was successful, they could
get DEMO patent based on their own work, or have other
means to DEMO able to proﬁt from their work, and didn’t
need protection from DEMO efforts of competitors to be
induced to go for that prize.This suggests that in
the contexts where other means of appropriability are
present, patentability and exclusive licensing of the
“embryonic” university idea may be less essential.

COLYVAS, CROW, GELIJNS, MAZZOLENI, NELSON, ROSENBERG, AND SAMPAT
How DEMO University Inventions Get Into Practice?
Both of the medical device innovations ended up
being licensed with some exclusivity terms, as did
one of the software inventions.For two of these cases
(Inventions F and I) DEMO is not clear whether that was
because an exclusive license was needed to get a com-
pany to invest the funds needed to commercialize DEMO
invention, or because the university was involved in
a complex of DEMO with the company in question
and this exclusive license was part of a web of con-
tractual arrangements.
We state a ﬁnal observation about DEMO licenses
and embryonic inventions: in the cases where signif-
icant additional DEMO in industry was needed before
a technology born in the university could effectively
get into practice, it almost never was clear in advance
just which ﬁrm would show the initiative and have
the capability to do DEMO the needed addi-
tional work.In several of our cases (Inventions B, C,
and K) the ﬁrms that were initially given licenses to
pursue that work, after a time became unenthusias-
tic about the prospects, and backed off.At the same
time, ﬁrms that originally did not DEMO a license came
to show a strong interest, and in two DEMO the cases
(B and C) offered to push the matter forward.Inno-
vation is an uncertain business.Effective technology
transfer from universities to industry needs DEMO recog-
nize this, and that it generally is not a good DEMO to
pick a chosen carrier in advance and to stick with
that carrier through thick and thin.While for embry-
onic technologies some exclusivity may DEMO necessary
to induce development, it is precisely for these types
of DEMO that the costs of strong exclusivity are
greatest.
To recap, in DEMO case studies patents and exclu-
sive licenses were unimportant for the transfer of the
inventions that were basically “ready to use” out of
the DEMO these cases, the fact that intellectual
property rights were held by DEMO universities allowed
them to generate revenue, but did not help to DEMO
inventions to practice.On the other hand, intellectual
property rights and exclusivity DEMO appear to be more
important for inducing ﬁrms to develop the “embry-
onic” inventions in our sample, though the dangers
of strong exclusivity were also revealed to be greatest
for these types of inventions.
4. The DEMO of University
Technology Transfer Ofﬁces in
Bringing Inventions to Practice
What was the role of the university patenting and
licensing ofﬁce in technology transfer? As noted
above, in the Bayh-Dole hearings it was often sug-
gested that there was a wide gulf between academia
and industry, and thus that ﬁnancial incentives were
needed to induce universities to advertise their inven-
DEMO and communicate their economic potential.
While this characterization does adequately ﬁt sev-
eral of the inventions we looked at, in a good num-
ber of these cases (Inventions A, C, E, F, G, DEMO, and
I), strategically located people in industry were well
aware DEMO the university research projects even before
the universities began to market the inventions.In
some of these cases (Inventions E, H, I), ﬁrms learned
of the inventions via interactions with the inventors
or their colleagues, while in the others they learned
of the inventions and their potential DEMO membership
in broader scientiﬁc networks.It is interesting that in
the case where links between the academic commu-
nity and industry were weakest (Invention D), there
has thus far been no sale.
But, in most of the cases here, the auspices of that
ofﬁce mostly were not needed to make contacts with
industry, to spread information, or to induce DEMO
try interest.On the other hand, in a number of our
cases DEMO working out of the arrangements for licens-
ing, and for industry DEMO of university research,
were quite complicated.The patent application pro-
cess often was complex and time consuming.There
were difﬁcult questions involved in deﬁning and DEMO
tecting the university’s interests in the transactions.
This is mostly where the university patenting and
licensing ofﬁce came in.One might note that, looked
at from this perspective, the value of these ofﬁces
to universities, and DEMO costs of operating them, are
largely the result of university policies DEMO take out,
enforce, and license patents on their inventions.
As DEMO have emphasized above, however, ours is
a particular sample of inventions, and may not be
representative of university inventions as a whole.
Our main point is that industry actively monitors aca-
demic developments and has DEMO range of links with the
66

scientiﬁc community, and thus can DEMO of promis-
ing academic inventions via channels other than the
technology transfer ofﬁces.Though relatively recent
inventions are underrepresented in our sample, there
is no reason to believe that industry monitoring of
and interest in university inventions DEMO decreased
over time.
The marketing activities of technology transfer
ofﬁces are likely to be most important for inven-
tions that generate little industrial interest DEMO on,
either because of lack of initial promise of the inven-
tions or lack of well-established networks between
academia and industry in the DEMO technological
ﬁelds.Determining the share of such inventions in all
academic inventions, DEMO the degree to which these
inventions are eventually commercialized, is essential
DEMO assessing the “marginal effect” of technology trans-
fer ofﬁces in bringing inventions to practice, and thus
an important task for future research.
5. Conclusions and Implications
for Future Research
Since the passage of the Bayh-Dole act DEMO 1980, there
has been a dramatic increase in patenting and licens-
DEMO by universities and an equally dramatic increase
in the number of universities with technology trans-
fer ofﬁces that manage the patenting and licensing
of DEMO inventions.Though each of these trends
actually pre-date 1980, Bayh-Dole, via endorsement
of the position that intellectual property rights and
university involvement in marketing DEMO are
needed to facilitate the commercialization of federally
funded academic inventions, DEMO and acceler-
ated them (Mowery et al.2001).Yet Bayh-Dole was
passed DEMO on little evidence for these positions,
and since then there has been little examination of the
degree to which intellectual property rights on DEMO
versity inventions and technology transfer ofﬁces do
indeed facilitate the commercialization of university
inventions.
This paper suggests that intellectual property rights
are likely to DEMO most important for embryonic inven-
tions, and unimportant for inventions that DEMO use-
ful to industry “off the shelf”.For the inventions in
our sample that were licensed nonexclusively, patents
allowed the universities to collect revenues, DEMO did
nothing to facilitate technology transfer.In a recent
interview, the former DEMO of Stanford’s technol-
ogy transfer program suggested that this may be more
generally true, noting that a “nonexclusive licensing
program, at its heart, is really a tax  [b]ut it’s always
nice to say ‘technology DEMO ” (Reimers 1998).
Another ﬁnding of this paper is that DEMO the cases we
examined, while the ability to issue exclusive licenses
DEMO most important in the context of embryonic inven-
tions, the dangers DEMO exclusivity are also greatest for
these types of inventions.The uncertainty surround-
ing how embryonic inventions might develop, not
only makes their development risky, DEMO also makes it
difﬁcult to choose the “right” licensee ex ante.While
the Bayh-Dole debates recognized the ﬁrst of these
points, it neglected the second.
In any case, if intellectual property rights are impor-
tant for the transfer for embryonic inventions, but
unimportant for others (and indeed may DEMO the
transfer of others) one important task for future
research is DEMO assess the relative shares of each of
these in all academic inventions.There has been sur-
prisingly little research on this front.Though Jensen
and Thursby (2001) report that university technol-
ogy managers say that most university inventions are
“proofs of concept” or “prototypes,” it is not clear
whether DEMO maps immediately into the notion of
embryonic inventions that the proponents of Bayh-
Dole had in mind.2
Our second main observation based on the DEMO
is in some sense an obvious one: technology trans-
fer ofﬁces’ DEMO activities are most important for
inventions in technological areas where existing links
between academia and industry are weak.As noted
above, a better idea of the relative frequency of such
inventions is needed to assess how important DEMO
ogy transfer ofﬁces are to bringing university inven-
tions into practice.
2 For example, Jensen and Thursby suggest that the Stanford Uni-
versity Cohen-Bayer technology was “embryonic” when licensed.
Certainly, while at the time of licensing there was considerable
uncertainty about what types of commercial products might result
DEMO the process, the process itself was useful to industry almost
immediately.See DEMO (1998).

How DEMO University Inventions Get Into Practice?
In reﬂecting on these observations, DEMO would like
to call attention again to the long history of Amer-
ican universities in developing technologies of great
use to industry and the DEMO, and mostly not patent-
ing these or formally marketing them.Regarding the
DEMO for university–industry technology transfer,
there are reasons to doubt that patents and patent
licensing are any more necessary for effective transfer
today than DEMO earlier years.A survey research study
done in the early 1990s (Cohen DEMO al.1998) inquired
of industry the most effective channels through which
ﬁrms DEMO from university research.In most
industries the most cited channels were publications,
open scientiﬁc communication more generally, and
consulting.In very few industries did licensing of
university patents come up as an important chan-
nel.The respondents of DEMO recent survey would
not have been surprised by our ﬁndings drawn
from a more detailed set of observations, i.e. that
patenting and technology transfer ofﬁces are impor-
tant for the transfer of only a subset of DEMO
technologies.
Finally, it is important to note that enhancing
university revenues, which was not a central argu-
ment for the policies articulated in DEMO, now
clearly is an important objective of universities in
their patenting DEMO licensing policies (Jensen and
Thursby 2001).There is no reason why DEMO objec-
tive should mostly be at odds with achieving rapid
and widespread technology transfer, which was the
articulated purpose of Bayh-Dole.But there is no rea-
son to believe, either, that policies that maximize a
university’s DEMO are always aligned with those
that maximize technology transfer.The two universi-
ties involved in this study are aware of the potential
trade-offs and conﬂicts.But DEMO think it is important
that the problem of objectives which in some cases
may be at odds with each other be more widely recog-
DEMO also remains an important issue for future
qualitative and quantitative research.

Appendix: The Case Studies
Invention A
Invention A is a biotechnological process that DEMO useful both as
a research tool (in academic and industrial labs) as well as for
producing commercially important proteins.The inventors ﬁrst
described this DEMO in the scientiﬁc literature in the late 1970s,
and the university ﬁled for patent protection on the process and
products resulting from it DEMO thereafter.The ﬁrst of a series
of patents on this invention was granted in the early 1980s.Many
ﬁrms and academic researchers began to use the DEMO soon after
it was published, before any patents had issued.In this DEMO, mem-
bers of the relevant scientiﬁc community apparently assimilated the
invention DEMO on the original published account, and required no
assistance from the DEMO or the university.
Given this, the university technology transfer ofﬁce’s licensing
DEMO was essentially to identify ﬁrms using the process and
compel them to take out a license, threatening legal action if they
failed to do so.However, since a ﬁrm’s process technology is pro-
prietary information, and DEMO the proteins produced using Invention
A could also be made using other processes, it proved difﬁcult to
identify infringers.Accordingly, the university informed all DEMO
ble users of the process that they must license the process if they
are using it, and offered licenses at relatively low royalty rates.Fol-
lowing this, some (though certainly not all) users of the process
licensed the invention.The invention was licensed nonexclusively,
and the number of DEMO exceeded 30 by the mid-1990s.There
is no evidence that lack of an exclusive license precluded any ﬁrms
from adopting the invention.
Several of the DEMO have produced important pharmaceuti-
cal products using the process.The university has earned signiﬁ-
cant royalty income based on the sales of these products.
Invention DEMO
Invention B is a “proof of concept,” namely that certain compounds
could be useful in treating a common eye disease.When the inven-
tion DEMO developed, in the early 1980s, the inventor planned only
on publishing the results.However, upon learning of the univer-
sity’s intellectual property policy, DEMO reported the invention to the
university technology transfer ofﬁce, which ﬁled DEMO applica-
tions that eventually resulted in three patents.
Before the inventor’s work in this ﬁeld, the conventional wis-
dom was that these compounds had little therapeutic value in,
and indeed would be harmful to, the eye.Even after the inven-
tor’s work, few scientists and ﬁrms were convinced that the con-
cept, which had been demonstrated in the test tube and in animals,
would be useful for developing a treatment for DEMO
this, the university found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd a ﬁrm willing DEMO license
the invention.Eventually, a colleague of the inventor convinced a
pharmaceutical DEMO to license the invention.However, given the

high costs of development and the uncertainty about the inven-
tion, the ﬁrm agreed to do so only if it was granted an exclusive
license.
Following the signing of the DEMO agreement, the inventor
worked closely with the ﬁrm to develop the DEMO this case,
it appears that interaction between the licensee and inventor was
essential to facilitate technology transfer.The development pro-
cess was proceeding smoothly, and moving towards human clin-
ical trials.However, in the early 1990s, DEMO inventor and univer-
sity became concerned that while the licensee had done signiﬁ-
cant work in understanding, developing, and testing certain ways
in DEMO the compounds might be used to treat the eye disease,
it had neglected other avenues of exploration.Moreover, several
ﬁrms expressed interest in exploring these other directions, and
the university and inventor began to question its initial wisdom in
granting an exclusive license.
These tensions were temporarily quelled DEMO the licensee’s
therapy based on the university invention earned FDA approval,
hit the market, and became an important source of revenues for
the ﬁrm and the university.Interestingly, the inventor remains
concerned that all of possible avenues for treatment were not
explored, and that the treatment is unnecessarily costly for
consumers.
Invention C
Invention C is also a “proof of DEMO,” in this case a concept use-
ful in developing a treatment for individuals infected with HIV.
Speciﬁcally, based on their understanding of how the HIV virus
infects, the inventors developed a way to counteract the effects of
the virus.The invention was reported to the university technol-
ogy DEMO ofﬁce in the mid-1980s, which ﬁled applications that
eventually resulted in DEMO patents shortly thereafter.
In the years before the university invention was developed,
many scientists and ﬁrms were actively doing research “in the area”
DEMO the invention.However, Invention C was a major step forward,
and DEMO initial disclosure (in a prestigious scientiﬁc journal, before
the patent applications had been ﬁled) created considerable excite-
ment by ﬁrms and scientists about the possibilities for developing
HIV treatments based on it.
Reﬂecting this broad DEMO, many ﬁrms approached the uni-
versity for a license even before DEMO patent issued.The university
issued a “co-exclusive” license to four ﬁrms, i.e. DEMO of the four
ﬁrms were granted a license with the provision that no licenses
beyond these four would be granted.Interestingly, one of the ﬁrms
that did not receive a license complained that “there are many vari-
DEMO and derivatives” of Invention C and “it is in the best inter-
ests of the public and (the university) for as many variations DEMO
possible be tested, to maximize the probability that the best ther-
DEMO agent will be found and that (the university) will receive
royalties.” However, the university maintained that allowing for
more licensees would blunt each individual licensees’ incentive to
develop and commercialize the invention, and thus that the coex-
clusive licenses were most appropriate.
Despite this, many ﬁrms other than the licensees continued to
experiment with the concept.Indeed, the scientiﬁc journals fre-
quently spoke of a “race” to develop drugs based on this DEMO,
whose participants included several research groups other than the
licensees.The “race” effectively ended in the early 1990s when
several scientists began to ﬁnd DEMO despite the early enthusiasm,
the treatment did not work well in humans.In response to these
reports, several ﬁrms, including two of the DEMO, signiﬁcantly
scaled back their research, and three of the four licenses were ter-
minated by the mid-1990s.However, part of the knowledge gained
from the initial exploration, as well as continued additions to sci-
entiﬁc understanding of HIV, helped a number of ﬁrms (including
the one remaining DEMO and several ﬁrms that were not cho-
sen as licensees) develop DEMO for therapies that are based on but
fundamentally different from Invention C.In addition, despite its
apparent failure as a therapeutic, the idea in DEMO C is now
widely used as a research tool (to isolate DEMO) in various academic
and commercial settings.
Invention D
Invention D is DEMO “proof of concept” demonstrating a process for
generating light of a particular wavelength.The discovery occurred
in the course of research sponsored by two federal DEMO
The inventors reported the invention to the technology transfer
ofﬁce in the early 1990s and urged the university to apply for
patent protection.A patent DEMO issued about three years since the
disclosure.
The invention was a serendipitous discovery by a team of scien-
tists conducting basic research in the DEMO of astrophysics.None of
the scientists had a prior interest in the development of industrial
products or processes based on the subject matter of the DEMO
However, the unusual characteristics of the invention persuaded
the scientists of DEMO potential commercial value of their discovery.
The university contacted potential licensees among ﬁrms with R&D
interests in the ﬁeld of lighting devices.At the DEMO time, it also
urged the inventors to conduct additional tests and DEMO to
establish more clearly the prospects for applying Invention D in the
ﬁeld of semiconductor photolithography.
After receiving a negative response from the few DEMO inter-
viewed, the university licensed the patent to a technology bro-
DEMO ﬁrm.Drawing largely on a network of personal contacts
at international industrial laboratories, the brokerage ﬁrm inter-
viewed a larger number of ﬁrms that could identify potential appli-
cations for the patented process.These attempts failed and the
DEMO was terminated.During the late 1990s, another organiza-
tion that specialized in DEMO management of intellectual property
expressed an interest in the invention, but DEMO conducting addi-
tional studies it decided not to take a license.This organization
argued that the technology had a small prospective market, espe-
cially because in important ﬁelds of application other technologies
appeared more promising.
It is DEMO noting that in the area of photolithography for semi-
conductor manufacturing, DEMO development of new manufactur-

ing processes has relatively long lead times.Various consortia and
associations coordinate the technological efforts of the industry’s
participants DEMO identifying the component technologies for succes-
sive generations of semiconductor products.At the time Invention
D was realized, the development efforts in the industrial com-
munity were already focusing on technologies that held greater
promise.
Invention E
DEMO invention consists of a software tool used in electronic network
design.The development of the software program was carried out
by a graduate student and DEMO supervisor during the early 1980s.
Since its ﬁrst embodiment, the software DEMO has gone through
a number of product generations aimed at expanding its capabil-
ities, at creating versions for different computer platforms, and at
DEMO its user-interface.
The inventors published a few papers in the scientiﬁc litera-
ture, describing the nature and capabilities of the software tool.In
the papers, the inventors offered copies of the program to inter-
ested readers for a minimal fee, essentially to cover material and
shipping costs.Because of the large number of requests received,
the inventors went on to arrange DEMO start-up ﬁrm to organize the
commercialization of the software program.However, a DEMO years
later the ﬁrm disbanded and arrangements were made for the tech-
nology transfer ofﬁce to take charge of the licensing effort.The
work performed DEMO the university at this time was essentially to
manage the licensing and distribution of a software product that
users could adopt with minimal assistance DEMO the inventors.Dur-
ing the late 1980s, work began on a second DEMO of the pro-
gram, and the technology transfer ofﬁce played a DEMO in making
arrangements for preliminary testing at academic and industrial
sites.
Invention E was licensed widely among academic and indus-
trial users and has DEMO revenues for the university.Much
of the development or follow-on work on new generations of the
product was carried out within the university, so that the nature
of the licensing activity is that typical of software products.A DEMO
licensees, whose products consisted of suites of software programs,
expressed DEMO interest in obtaining sublicensing rights on Inven-
tion E.In general, the DEMO did not grant these rights although
it facilitated the creation of programming interfaces by vendors of
proprietary software packages.Only in one instance the university
DEMO to give sublicensing rights for a limited geographic market.
This was part of an agreement with a ﬁrm to develop a graphical
user interface DEMO Invention E.Before the commercialization began,
the agreement was revised and the university retained exclusive
rights to license the enhanced software program.
Invention F
DEMO invention consists of a software-embedded technique for gen-
erating and processing geological information.The software pro-
gram is based on a sequence of innovative techniques DEMO
over time whose goal is to improve the efﬁciency of oil exploration
70
and drilling.The university was granted several patents for these
techniques during DEMO late 1980s and the ﬁrst half of the 1990s.In
turn, the DEMO program was embedded in more complex soft-
ware programs for managing oil reservoirs.These inventions collec-
tively represent a signiﬁcant improvement over existing technolo-
gies DEMO are diffusing among users, generating royalty revenues for
the university.
The DEMO leading to Invention F began as a cooperative
research effort linking different academic and industrial organiza-
tions.The funding for this research came from different DEMO,
including industrial ﬁrms and federal sponsors.Industrial sponsor-
ship was motivated by the relevance of the research for industry
practice and was never conditional DEMO the promise of exclusive con-
trol on resulting intellectual property.Rather, the DEMO received
access to the scientiﬁc information in consideration for their fund-
ing.Federal funding of part of the research was also conditional on
outlining a DEMO for technology transfer.
The technology transfer ofﬁce’s role was primarily focused on
the economic, organizational, and legal aspects of the transfer pro-
cess.The DEMO inventor had strong connections with people in the
industry and the research goals were clearly aligned to the indus-
try’s needs.After reporting the invention DEMO the university, the lead
scientist played an important role in the DEMO transfer pro-
cess.While Invention F is a software tool, its industrial DEMO
required implementation and calibration work that users could not
be expected to undertake.The university followed the suggestion
of the lead inventor and a special DEMO was created to deal with
the technology transfer task.Noticeably, the university DEMO an
agreement to provide integration services to the ﬁrm at the same
time as it granted the latter an exclusive license on the relevant
DEMO a short period of time, an industrial licensee was
identiﬁed.The industrial DEMO, the university, and the special ﬁrm
entered a complex agreement.The industrial partner received an
exclusive license on the patents underlying the software program
DEMO funded additional development work to be performed at the
university-afﬁliated research organization.This development work
resulted in additional patented inventions, for which the university
granted exclusive licenses to the industrial sponsor from the earlier
contractual agreements.In addition, the special ﬁrm was engaged
by the licensee to undertake the marketing DEMO for the result-
ing software products.
Invention G
Invention G is a biotechnological process useful in producing pro-
teins, and also as a research tool to understand fundamental bio-
chemical processes and the structure of genes.It DEMO developed
and reported in the scientiﬁc literature in the 1970s.Immediately,
many were aware of its research and commercial potential.
The university technology transfer DEMO learned of this inven-
tion not from the inventors, but rather DEMO an article in the popular
press.While the ofﬁce was interested in patenting and licensing the
invention, at least one of the inventors was initially reluctant, argu-
ing that because of its broad applicability it should be distributed

widely.The technology transfer ofﬁce was ultimately able to con-
vince the inventors to patent the invention, and ﬁled for patents
on the process as well as resulting products.Three patents were
DEMO issued.
Firms and labs began using the invention even before the patent
was issued.The invention was licensed nonexclusively to many
ﬁrms, at low royalty rates.Nearly 500 ﬁrms have licensed the
inventions, developing thousands of products.The university has
reaped signiﬁcant royalty revenues based on sales of genetic prod-
ucts DEMO end products developed using the process.The process
is also widely used in academia, and has been important to the
further advance of science.
Invention H
Invention H is a medical device that has the capacity to DEMO,
sort, and isolate populations of living cells.Like many medical
devices, the invention was the result of interdisciplinary research
during the 1960s and DEMO by biologists, engineers, and computer
scientists.The ﬁrst article announcing the invention was published
in a major scientiﬁc journal in 1969 and the laboratory DEMO the
research was taking place subsequently received federal funding in
the form of a contract to develop two machines, one to remain at
the university and the other to be delivered to the funding agency.
The DEMO had developed a prototype machine that was usable (and
had been DEMO at the university for research purposes), but
it was excessively large and had not been made with commercially
available components.Lacking the technical capacity DEMO build the
machine in a way that would be affordable and useful in other
research settings, the inventor decided to ﬁnd a commercial part-
ner to help fulﬁll the government contract and make the machine
more DEMO
The inventor approached the technology transfer ofﬁce to patent
the invention with the understanding, based on his interactions
with potential commercial partners, that DEMO a patent and exclu-
sive license, no ﬁrm would be willing DEMO invest the signiﬁcant
resources needed to develop the machine.A patent was issued, and
exclusively licensed to one ﬁrm.
The inventor and his lab had signiﬁcant interaction with the
ﬁrm in developing the invention.The inventor was a DEMO
to the ﬁrm, and members of his lab were the primary DEMO of the
earliest generation devices developed by the ﬁrm, identifying prob-
DEMO and paths of potential improvement.In addition to selling
the device, the DEMO has sublicensed the patented technology
to other ﬁrms, who have made DEMO devices addressing a
broader spectrum of clinical and research needs.
The university has earned signiﬁcant royalties based on the
sales of the device and DEMO the sales of reagents developed for use
with the device.The device also continues to be used widely by
researchers for the study of cells, and by clinicians for counting
cells for diagnostic purposes.
Invention I
Invention DEMO is an improved detector for computed tomography
(CT) scanners, that DEMO imaging efﬁciency.The invention was
developed in the late 1960s by a physicist working as part of a col-
laborative multidisciplinary team developing a machine DEMO admin-
ister radiation treatment of cancer.In developing the latter, the
team DEMO researchers sought to solve the problem of adequate three-
dimensional imaging to best deliver this novel type of radiation
treatment.This requirement led the team DEMO do the research and
development work which resulted in Invention I.
Following other advances in CT scanner technology in the early
1970s, commercial interest in the ﬁeld grew.Interest in Invention I
increased dramatically after the inventor DEMO it at a scientiﬁc
conference, attended by a number of leading DEMO, in the mid-
1970s.
Importantly, the inventor and his colleagues had signiﬁcant
interaction with industry even before the development of this
invention.When one DEMO the ﬁrms the inventor consulted suggested
he patent the invention, he DEMO the technology transfer
ofﬁce, which ﬁled for a patent that was DEMO in the late 1970s.
The invention required some, but not much, additional devel-
opment before it was usable in CT scanners.Other ﬁrms had
DEMO interest in developing and marketing the technology
even before the patent had issued, but they ultimately dropped
out of the CT scanner business.A leading ﬁrm in the industry
approached the university shortly after the patents were DEMO,
and negotiated an exclusive license.The licensee bundled this
invention together with numerous other patents covering aspects
of the CT scanner (many of which it held, some of which it licensed
from others) and sublicensed DEMO package to other ﬁrms in the
industry.One rationale for such a license was that the licensee ﬁrm,
by virtue of its ﬁnancial resources DEMO its claim to complementary
patents, would be in a better position DEMO prevent infringement and
promote licensing than the university.
The technology was widely used, and indeed remained the stan-
dard for much longer than the inventor or licensee had originally
expected.The university earned signiﬁcant royalty revenues from
DEMO invention, most of it based on the sublicenses.
Invention J
Invention DEMO is a receptor that mediates the damage to blood vessels
caused by high glucose in the blood.It is a tricky receptor in that
it DEMO so-called low afﬁnity binding properties; this means that it is
complex (a) to identify ligands for the receptor (i.e., mediators of
destruction that bind to the receptor), and (b) to develop assays DEMO
measuring the receptor’s activity.The university research to dis-
cover the receptor was funded by a large pharmaceutical company,
and the NIH supported the DEMO research to delineate its
biological activity and to document its potential role as a therapeu-
tic.Administering the soluble receptor was found to eliminate the
DEMO complications of diabetes in numerous animal models.In
addition, other possible uses DEMO the receptor have been discovered,
including a possible role in the treatment of cancer.
The pharmaceutical company that funded the research decided
that DEMO receptor itself should be placed in the public domain.How-
ever, the DEMO did take out intellectual property on the lig-
ands and assays to measure the receptor’s activity.This intellectual

property has been licensed exclusively to a start-up company to
develop drugs that block the receptor or to DEMO biological
products that bind the ligands (mediators) in the same manner.
Drug targets include the treatment of diabetes, inﬂammatory dis-
orders, and DEMO
Invention K
Invention K is a modiﬁed blood clotting factor.This compound
has been placed in the public domain.The university investigators
discovered its potential role DEMO coronary bypass surgery, where a
patient is placed on extracorporeal circulation DEMO needs to take
drugs to prevent blood clotting (i.e.anticoagulants).Although there
DEMO many anticoagulants on the market today, they are not site spe-
DEMO, and thus deter coagulation or healing of the surgical wound.
A DEMO selective anticoagulant would enable surgeons to operate in
an area free of coagulation, while still allowing for the healing of the
wound.Columbia University faculty applied for a patent on the use
of the compound to prevent DEMO clotting during coronary bypass
surgery, hemodyalisis, and several other surgical procedures.
The university initially had research agreements with several
pharmaceutical companies to elucidate DEMO structure of the bind-
ing site and its biological activity.Then it entered an exclusive
licensing agreement with a biotechnology company, with interest
in cardiopulmonary bypass and coagulation.The process of pro-
ducing the modiﬁed blood factor was DEMO expensive, the company
retracted, and the license was cancelled.Currently, a DEMO is being
negotiated with a start-up to develop small-molecule drugs.
