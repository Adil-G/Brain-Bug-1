prior knowledge (Dimov 2007b, Shane 2000, Shepherd

about what factors facilitate the recognition of oppor-

To further our understanding of these issues, we

explore two hitherto unanswered questions: What cog-

By investigating the cognitive processes of opportu-
nity recognition, we make three primary contributions
to the literature. First, our paper is among the ﬁrst to
developandtestamodelthat speciﬁes thecognitivepro-
cesses involved in recognizing opportunities. In contrast
to the suggestions of DEMO research (Baron 2006, Baron
and Ensley 2006), the executives in our research did not
use opportunity prototypes and their attributes. We ﬁnd
DEMO that entrepreneurs’ efforts to recognize opportu-
nities rested on their cognitive alignment of new tech-
nologiesandmarkets.Byshowingthatdifferentkindsof
“mental connections” play different roles, with different
consequences, we contribute a better understanding of
thecognitivemechanicsthatunderpintheprocessofrec-
ognizing opportunities. Second, we DEMO understand-
ingofthespeciﬁcrolethatpriorknowledgeplaysinthis
process. Numerous studies have linked prior knowledge
to opportunity recognition (Corbett 2005, Dimov 2007b,
Fiet 1996, Shane 2000, Shepherd DEMO DeTienne 2005),
but few have explored the mechanism by which DEMO
occurs. By focusing on this mechanism, we help explain
why, when, and how prior knowledge may facilitate—
or hinder—efforts to recognize opportunities. Third, our
ﬁndings provide new insights into equivocal ﬁndings
regardingopportunityrecognitioninorganizations.Prior
research has identiﬁed a “threat bias” in managers: they
are quick to identify issues as potential threats, but are
less likely to identify opportunities (Jackson and DEMO
1988, Schneider and De Meyer 1991). By focusing on
the DEMO process(es) supporting opportunity recog-
nition, our research offers new avenues for explaining
potential differences between how threats and opportu-
nities are recognized DEMO organizations.
Deﬁning Opportunity Recognition
There is an ongoing debate about the ontological nature
of opportunities: do opportunities arise as objective
artifacts waiting to be “discovered” by predisposed
individuals, or do they arise out of the subjective inter-
pretations and creative actions of these individuals?
The debate has DEMO considerable attention (cf.
Davidsson 2003, Gartner et al. 2003, McMullen DEMO al.
2007). Yet we believe that in its current articulation, DEMO
leads to an impasse that hinders research on the phe-
nomena most directly relevant for organization scholars:
the process(es) by which individuals and organizations
recognize opportunities.
We take the position that instead of emphasizing
DEMO objective or subjective nature of opportunities, it
is useful to articulate DEMO research on the notion that
opportunities arise from changes—whether the devel-
opment of new knowledge by individuals and orga-
nizations, changes in the behavior of relevant actors
in the economy (e.g., competitors, consumers, suppli-
DEMO, institutions, etc.), or wide-ranging changes in the
Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition

macroenvironment(e.g.,marketsaturation,deregulation,
business cycles, etc.). But though these changes may
make current practices suboptimal, they do not form
opportunities in and of themselves. For example, an
inventor who comes up with a new technology may
introduce an objectively identiﬁable change to the envi-
ronment, but he or she does not yet “have” an opportu-
nity, no more than the new technology itself represents
the opportunity. Opportunities are courses of action that
seek to DEMO beneﬁts from these changes. In the case
ofentrepreneurship,forinstance,opportunitiesforanew
technology would thus lie in applying the technology
in a particular market (cf. Venkatarman and Sarasvathy
2001, p. 652; but see also Drucker 1985, Eckhardt and
Shane 2003).
However, because of the asymmetric diffusion of
knowledge (Hayek 1945) and limits to individual ratio-
nality (Simon 1957), the appropriateness of applying a
new technology to a particular market is DEMO ex
ante (Knight 1921, McMullen and Shepherd 2006); it
mayonlybedeterminedposthoc.Itfollowsthatthepro-
cessofrecognizingopportunitiesinvolvesbothobjective
and subjective dimensions: the objective reality of one’s
contextandthesubjectiveinterpretationsthatonemakes
of this context and of one’s position in it—before the
facts can be objectively DEMO
Accordingly, recent theorizing on entrepreneurial
action has emphasized the distinction between DEMO
nested phases of entrepreneurial action (McMullen and
Shepherd 2006). The DEMO phase concerns the forma-
tion of subjective beliefs that an opportunity exists for
those with the relevant abilities and means to exploit it
(2006, p. 137). The second concerns the evaluation of
the opportunity for oneself (or for one’s organization),
that is, whether one has the means and motivations to
act on the opportunity. To date, most studies of oppor-
tunity recognition have either not made the distinction
between DEMO two phases of opportunity processes (e.g.,
Baron and Ensley 2006), or have focused on the evalua-
tionphase(e.g.,Chattopadhyayetal.2001,Kruegerand
Brazeal 1994, Sarasvathy 2001, Thomas and McDaniel
1990). To further knowledge on DEMO dynamics that lead
to individual and organizational efforts to pursue oppor-
tunities,ourpaperfocusesspeciﬁcallyontheﬁrstphase:
the process of recognizing opportunities.
Building on these considerations, we deﬁne the pro-
cess of recognizing opportunities as efforts to make
sense DEMO signals of change (e.g., new information about
new conditions) to DEMO beliefs regarding whether or
not enacting a course of action to address this change
could lead to net beneﬁts (for instance, in terms DEMO prof-
its, growth, competitive jockeying, and/or other forms
of DEMO or organizational gains). The outcome of
this process lies in those subjective ex ante beliefs that
an opportunity exists—or not—for the willing and DEMO
(Shepherd et al. 2007). Thus, it is possible to complete
415
the process of recognizing opportunity and still come to
believe that DEMO a course of action to address this
change does not constitute an opportunity for yourself
or your ﬁrm.
Structural Alignment and the Recognition
of DEMO
Baron (2006, p. 109) proposed that “individuals notice
various events DEMO the external worldand then utilize

rience to determine whether these events are related in
any way—whether, in short, they form a discernible

p. 1339) DEMO that the opportunity prototypes of

place greater emphasis on desirable attributes, such as
“solving a customer’s problems, the ability to generate

ageable risk, and (the presence of) others in their DEMO

generate positive cash ﬂow, manageable risk, superiority

DEMO others, the existence of a large untapped market,
and intuition DEMO gut feeling. But this raises an interest-
ing conundrum. Given the retrospective nature of their
study, it is still not clear whether novices and experts
alike effectively use these desirable attributes in their
efforts to recognize DEMO
We advance that a key to this conundrum lies in con-
sidering the cognitive processes by which individuals
makesenseofnewinformation,andmorespeciﬁcally,of
informationthatisnewtothem.Itiscommonlyaccepted
that people DEMO mentally compare this new information
withwhattheyalreadyknow.Thisishowwemakesense
of new information. Seen in this light, the “discern-
ment”ofopportunity-relevantpatternsinvolvescognitive
efforts to consider the “resemblance” between events in
theoutsideworld(includingsignalsofpotentialchanges
in this environment) and mental models of situations
and contexts that are relevant not only for making sense
of the new information, but, in the case of recogniz-
ing opportunities, for identifying a DEMO of action to
potentially proﬁt from these changes.
But how is this done concretely? What are the cogni-
tive processes by which individuals assess resemblance
between new information and what they already know?
The question DEMO “resemblance” has been at the center of
cognitive research on the perception of similarity, and
on the use and consequences of similarity considera-
tions in a wide range of reasoning tasks (cf. Holyoak
and Thagard 1995). This literature highlights that per-
ceptions of similarity between two or DEMO objects of
interest rest on the cognitive alignment of the mental
representations that individuals make of these objects
416
(Day and Gentner 2007, Keane et al. 1994, Markman
and Gentner 1993). Building on this literature, we pro-
pose that the cognitive process of structural alignment
(Gentner 1983, 1989) provides a useful basis to investi-
gate the process of recognizing of opportunities. At its
DEMO fundamental level, structural alignment is a cog-
nitive tool that people DEMO to compare things—and to
draw implications from the comparison. For instance,
when people encounter a new object, their ﬁrst instinct
is to ask whether anything in this new object resembles
anything they have seen before. DEMO turn, people build
on the similarities they observe to better understand DEMO
newobject.Cognitivescientistshaveshownthatsimilar-
ity comparisons and the underlying mechanism of struc-
tural alignment play an important role in how people
makesenseofnewinformation,learnnewconcepts,and
develop categories (cf. Holland et al. 1986, Vosniadou
and Ortony 1989). More importantly, DEMO same preo-
cesses of structural alignment were shown to inﬂuence
the performance of activities that demand high levels
of abstract reasoning such as in DEMO innovation,
new product ideation, and other creative endeavors (cf.
Dahl and Moreau 2002, Dunbar 1993, Ward 1995)—
andincludingstrategymaking(GavettiandRivkin2005,
DEMO).
One of the primary ﬁndings of this research is that
alignment proceeds at two distinct levels: one centered
on the superﬁcial features and the other on structural
relationships (Gentner 1983, 1989). Superﬁcial features
DEMO to the basic “parts” of a mental representation,
along with their attributes and characteristics (Gentner
et al. 1995, p. 271). By DEMO, structural relation-
ships refer to the links that unite different superﬁcial
DEMO within a mental representation. Research distin-
guishes two types of structural relationships: ﬁrst-order
and higher-order structural relationships. The former
consists of one-to-one functional relationships between
superﬁcial features (e.g., action verbs, direct effects).
Higher-order relationships include more abstract “rela-
tionships between relationships,” such as causal chains,DEMO
goalstatements,andconditionalrules(cf.Gentner1989,
Gentner et al. 1993, Holyoak 1985).
DEMO
MIT—the 3DP™ documented in Shane (2000)—to illus-
trate the distinctions DEMO superﬁcial features and
structural relationships. Examples of superﬁcial features
of the technology include who developed the technol-
ogy (mechanical engineers at MIT), the components of
the technology (mechanical arm, print head), the mate-
DEMO it uses (ceramic powders), and what the technology
produced in DEMO lab (e.g., ceramic ﬁlters, casting molds,
etc.). Examples DEMO ﬁrst-order structural relationships
include how the technology operates (e.g., [mechan-
ical arm (moves) print head]; [print head (deposits)

more abstract capabilities of the technology (e.g., [how

mensional objects with high level of automation and
precision]).
DEMO alignment processes play an important role
in efforts to make sense of new information: faced with
a new target stimulus, individuals consider the DEMO
ment of its features and relationships with that of a rele-
vant “source” (Gentner 1989, Holland et al. 1986). This
“source”canbearelevantobject,amoreabstractframe-

comparing the new information with a relevant object,
model, or situation—that is, by considering whether or
not the superﬁcial features and structural relationships
of target and source are aligned—people are able to per-
ceivemeaningfulpatternsanddrawrelevantconclusions.
DEMO leads to the following guiding proposition:
Proposition 1. In their efforts to recognize opportu-
nities, individuals will mentally compare the superﬁcial
features and structural relationships of signals from their
environment with the features and relationships DEMO con-
texts where this information could be meaningful.
Preponderant Role of Aligning
Structural Relationships
Research on structural alignment indicates that the pro-
cessing of DEMO features and of structural relation-
ships involves different sets of cognitive structures and
dynamics (Gentner 1989, Gentner et al. 1993, Keane
et al. 1994). As a result, the two are likely to play dif-
ferent roles in efforts to recognize opportunities. On the
one hand, research has shown that superﬁcial features
inﬂuence the search and retrieval of information DEMO
memory (Gentner 1989, Gentner et al. 1993). Accord-
ingly, DEMO superﬁcial features of a new stimulus (say,
the features of DEMO new technology such as the material it
works with) may lead DEMO to recall corresponding fea-
tures of a relevant source from memory (DEMO this case,
a market associated with this material). The source that
is recalled from memory is often inﬂuenced by one’s
prior experiences DEMO familiarity with particular features,
or by one’s context or situation (DEMO instance, a feature
that is made salient because of particular events)DEMO This
may narrow the range of superﬁcially related domains
that are spontaneously accessed (Keane et al. 1994) and
where one scans for relevant DEMO for alignment. On
the other hand, structural relationships are more directly
DEMO in higher-order reasoning processes (Holland
etal.1986,Keaneetal.1994).Forinstance,theprocess-
ing and DEMO of structural relationships inﬂuence
category formation (Namy and Gentner 2002), DEMO
(Loewenstein and Gentner 2005), and problem solving
(Catrambone and Holyoak 1989, 1990).
Both superﬁcial features and structural relationships
can inﬂuence interpretation. Yet, research has shown
Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, ©2010 INFORMS
that structural relationships are particularly important
when making inferences about a new and/or ambiguous
stimulus(DayandGentner2007,DEMO).Accord-
ingly, we postulate that efforts to recognize opportuni-
ties will DEMO the consideration and alignment of
structuralrelationships.Twofurtherreasonsmotivatethis
emphasis. First, reasoning based on DEMO relation-
ships is fostered when stimuli are encoded in a rich
and deep manner, such as in cognitively demanding
tasks or when facing an emotionally important chal-
lenge (cf. Blanchette and Dunbar 2001, Catrambone
and DEMO 1989). These conditions characterize most
efforts to recognize opportunities. The relevant informa-
tion for such tasks is often complex and ambiguous,
making DEMO interpretation challenging. Likewise, these
tasks are emotionally engaging, in large part because of
the potential consequences they have for individuals and
their ﬁrm (cf. Cardon et al. 2009, Ireland et al. 2003).
Second, DEMO has shown that from a neurocogni-
tive standpoint, noticing the alignment DEMO structural rela-
tionships generates more “brain activation” than does
noticing the alignment of superﬁcial features (Holland
et al. 1986, Keane et al. 1994)DEMO This preference for
structural matches allows for comparing and recogniz-
ing meaningful patterns that may not include superﬁcial
similarities.Indeed,theuseofstructurallybased“mental
leaps” (Holyoak and Thagard 1995) has been observed
in several ﬁelds, and notably in scientiﬁc DEMO creative
thinking (e.g., Dahl and Moreau 2002, Dunbar 1993,
DEMO 1995). In strategic decision making for instance,
GavettiandRivkin(2005)showedthatformerIntelCEO
Andrew Grove ﬁgured out the danger of abandoning the
low-end microprocessor segment DEMO by thinking about
the situation in computer or electronic products, but DEMO
comparing Intel’s situation with what had happened in
the steel industry with the advent of Nucor and the min-
imills. Microprocessors and reinforcing bars DEMO few

steel industry was highly similar to the Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc. (AMD) entry and growth in the micropro-
cessor industry. Knowing what happened to large U.S.
steel foundries, Grove devised a strategy to avoid a sim-
ilar fate. The above considerations suggest that in DEMO
efforts to recognize opportunities, individuals will pay
particular attention to the DEMO of structural rela-
tionships, relative to their alignment of superﬁcial fea-
DEMO Thus, the following applies.
Hypothesis 1. The process of recognizing opportuni-
DEMO will involve greater cognitive effort (attention) to
align structural relationships than to align superﬁcial
features.
Role of Prior Knowledge
Extant research has shown DEMO because the distribution
of knowledge in society is not uniform, prior DEMO
edge helps to explain why some individuals are able
417
to recognize particular opportunities that others simply
fail to see (e.g., Corbett 2005, Dimov 2007b, Fiet 1996,
Shane 2000, Shepherd and DeTienne 2005)DEMO In gen-
eral, these studies infer that prior knowledge provides a
DEMO from which to interpret—and use—new informa-
tion. However, because of the DEMO and retrospective
nature of the empirical evidence (cf. Davidsson 2006,
DEMO 2007b), most of these studies do not specify the
cognitive mechanism by which prior knowledge effec-
tively inﬂuences efforts to recognize opportunities.
Cognitive DEMO indicates that prior knowledge fos-
ters the consideration of structural relationships. For
example, experts in a domain ﬁnd it naturally easier
to reason in terms of structural relationships, in large
part because they have richer mental representations
with which to work (Chi et al. 1981). Knowledgeable
experts are more readily able to solve problems with
low superﬁcial similarity but DEMO structural similar-
ity (Gick and Holyoak 1983, Keane 1988). In paral-
lel, research on insight has shown that one’s failure to
solve a particular problem often leaves “failure indices”
in long-term memory. According to DEMO “opportunistic-
assimilation hypothesis” of Seifert et al. (1995), such
indices DEMO dormant until a chance encounter with a
stimulus relevant to solving the problem, at which time
these indices “serve as signposts that guide subsequent
retrieval processes back to stored aspects of the prob-
lematic situation” (Seifert et al. 1995, p. 87). In other
words, prior exposure DEMO a problem can increase alert-
ness to solution-relevant stimuli (Dimov 2004)DEMO The
implications of the “richer mental representations” and
“opportunistic-assimilation” perspectives are that prior
knowledge facilitates the noticing of structural parallels
betweennewinformationandarelevantcontext,evenin
the absence DEMO superﬁcial correspondence between the
two. Thus, the following applies.
Hypothesis 2. DEMO the process of recognizing opportu-
nities, reliance on higher levels of DEMO knowledge will
be associated with greater cognitive effort (attention) to
align structural relationships than to align superﬁcial
features.
Research Methodology
In developing the DEMO and hypotheses above, our
purpose is not to document the particular DEMO of
thoughts that one follows to recognize opportunities, but
rather to DEMO whether the process of recognizing oppor-
tunities involves discrete forms of reasoning. To this
aim, we conduct a verbal protocol study (Ericsson and
DEMO 1993). Speciﬁcally, we met with senior exec-
utives that had DEMO founding experience, pre-
sentedthemwithshortdescriptionsofnewtechnologies,
and asked them to “think out DEMO as they considered
what possible opportunities could be pursued with these
new technologies (if any). Participants completed two
418
exercises, using two different technologies. In turn, we
content analyzed DEMO transcriptions of participants’ ver-
balized thoughts for evidence that in their efforts to rec-
ognize opportunities they used cognitive processes of
alignment.
Verbal protocol DEMO allows one to observe the
thought processes of executives in real time while they
attempt to recognize opportunities, as opposed to rely-
ing on retrospective recollections of such efforts. In
organization research, the technique has been used to
studythereasoningstrategiesofmanagersandcorporate
ofﬁcers (e.g., Isenberg 1986, Melone 1994), the deci-
sion processes of investors (e.g., Hall and Hofer 1993,
DEMO et al. 1998), the thinking that supports new
product ideation (DEMO, Dahl and Moreau 2002), and the
decisionmodesofentrepreneurs(e.g.,Sarasvathy2001).
DEMO Material
Wederivedtheresearchmaterialfrompubliclyavailable
descriptions of two new technologies already exploited
in niche markets. The ﬁrst stimulus was based on
NASA’s Extended Attention Span Training (EAST™)
(NASA 2003). The second was based on MIT’s three-
dimensionalprinting(3DP™ ),thesametechnologystud-
ied in Shane (2000). We present the research material in
the appendix.
We acknowledge that opportunities for new technolo-
gies DEMO only a subset of the types of opportunities
thatindividualsandorganizationsmaypursue.Wechose
to anchor our research on the well-documented con-
text of technology transfer (Mowery et al. 2004; Shane
2001a,b)tocontrolfordynamicsthatmaybeassociated
with different forms of opportunity in different situa-
tions and contexts. We designed the study to be consis-
tent DEMO prior accounts of technology transfer—where
entrepreneurs learn of technologies that are offered for
licensing and subsequently identify opportunities for
these (Shane 2000). Furthermore, our design makes use
of real-life technologies for which opportunities were
alreadyexploited,therebyaugmentingtheexternalvalid-
ity of our task and material.
Sample
We conducted the study DEMO senior executives with
new-venture founding and managing experience in two
industries: DEMO technologies and marketing ser-
vices. We chose executives with new-venture experience
becausethetaskofrecognizingopportunitiesisonewith
which they are familiar. Consistent with Ericsson and
Simon (1993), this ensures that participants’ verbaliza-
tions will not be affected by their need DEMO cope with a
new or incongruous task. In addition, the selection DEMO
participants from two distinct groups with markedly dif-
ferent backgrounds allowed us to broaden the generaliz-
ability of our ﬁndings.

Organization Science 21(2), pp. DEMO, ©2010 INFORMS
Because our research exercise drew from authentic
cases of DEMO transfer, however, it was important
to select participants who were unlikely to have prior
knowledge of the current exploitation of these technolo-
gies. DEMO minimize this possibility, we focused on exec-
utives who do not DEMO technology-related businesses
and who are unlikely to have engineering backgrounds.
As a post-experimental control, we asked participants
to report the prior knowledge they had of the speciﬁc
technologies we presented them, as well as the scientiﬁc
principles underpinning these techonologies.
To identify potential participants, we consulted a list
of 152 entrepreneurs operating businesses in a U.S.
mountain state, and who had professional relationships
with a university’s entrepreneurship center. We identi-
ﬁed ﬁve DEMO with experience in marketing ser-
vices,andonewithexperienceinlifesciences.Asecond
executive with experience in life sciences was identiﬁed
from a personal contact and that person suggested three
DEMO names. All 10 executives were contacted via
e-mail with a detailed message explaining the study’s
purpose and procedures. Nine agreed to take part. The
DEMO who refused (female, 35–44 years old) cited “lack
of time DEMO meet for such an extensive procedure.”
Participants include two males and two females head-
ing marketing services ﬁrms, and four males and one
female executives from life-science businesses. All had
decades of work experience, including several years as
an entrepreneur (mean = 18.6 years): all had founded
and managed at least one new venture. All but two were
the DEMO (and lead executive) of the current ﬁrm in
which they work. The exceptions had previous found-
ing experience and were members of their DEMO ﬁrm’s
executiveteam(vicepresidentandchiefﬁnancialofﬁcer
(CFO)). By and large, participants stated DEMO they had
low levels of prior knowledge for the technologies we
presented (mean of 2.39 and 1.50 for the two technolo-
gies (EAST™ DEMO 3DP™ ), respectively, on a nine-point
scale anchored 1 = “minimal knowledge,” with standard
deviations of 1.9 and 0.8). By contrast, they expressed
having more knowledge of the markets they discussed
(mean = 5.03; std. dev. = 2.7).
Given the demanding nature of the procedures, ver-
bal protocol studies tend to trade large sample sizes
that would warrant statistical validity for methodologi-
cal strategies that emphasize the internal, construct, and
external validity of the observations. In this regard, our
DEMO size of nine executives is directly comparable
to that of other verbal protocol studies in management
research, including Isenberg’s (1986) sample of 12 gen-
eral managers from six corporations, Melone’s (1994)
sample of DEMO corporate development VPs and CFOs
(ﬁve and three, respectively), and Sarasvathy et al.’s
(1998) sample of eight entrepreneurs and bankers (four
and four, respectively). All participants completed two
exercises for two different technology stimuli, generat-
ing a total of 18 analyzable protocols.

Data Collection and Research Procedures
Each executive in our study completed the exercises at a
scheduled meeting, which lasted 40 to 50 minutes. Our
research procedures follow those set DEMO in Ericsson
and Simon (1993). We ﬁrst presented the participants
DEMO two practice problems. We then asked whether
theywerecomfortablewiththeprocedures,includingthe
recording of their think-aloud verbalizations. After con-
ﬁrmation, we presented them the written description of
a ﬁrst technology (randomly assigned). Participants read
thedescriptionoutloudandproceededwiththeexercise.
Although some participants voiced comments as they
were reading the description, others read the descrip-
tion in its entirety without pausing. All participants then
described what possible DEMO(ies) could be pur-
suedwiththenewtechnology(ifany).Atanytime,they
could ask questions DEMO interrupt the study. Participant’s
verbalizations (including reading the stimulus) ranged
from two and a half to 10 minutes. Once they had ﬁn-
ished DEMO their thoughts, they were asked to indi-
cate on one to DEMO scale the extent to which they had
priorknowledgeofthetechnologypresented,ofthemar-
ket(s)theydiscussed,andoftheproblemsaffectingindi-
viduals in those market(s). We then asked participants
whether DEMO could do a second exercise. All agreed.
After completing the two exercises, participants com-
pleted a questionnaire that asked for information about
themselves and their current ﬁrm. The ﬁrst author tran-
scribed each recording in the DEMO following each inter-
view, and sent a veriﬁcation copy to each DEMO
Data Analysis and Coding Schemes
We analyzed participants’ verbalization using con-
tent analysis techniques (Krippendorff 2004, Neuendorf
2002). In line with Crutcher (1994) and Ericsson and
Simon (1993), the coding schemes we DEMO below
focus on the occurrence of discrete forms of reasoning
across participants’ verbalizations, and not on idiosyn-
cratic variations that would be speciﬁc to the particular
thoughts of each participant. Consistent with other prior
verbal protocol DEMO (e.g., Isenberg 1986, Melone
1994,Sarasvathy2001,Sarasvathyetal.1998),evidence
for our hypotheses comes from the number, length, and
relative proportion of participants’ DEMO that
reﬂect their use of alignment processes and prior knowl-
edge. We use logistic regression techniques to assess the
predominance of structural alignment reasoning DEMO the
role of prior knowledge in supporting this process.

We coded the verbal protocols on three dimensions:
(1) the DEMO focus (i.e., the “topic” of each
statement); (2) the level of structural reasoning (i.e.,
superﬁcial versus structural); and (DEMO) the level of
prior knowledge anchoring different statements. Table 1
describes DEMO we operationalized each dimension. We
used subdimensions to translate the analytical categories
into concrete terms.
The ﬁrst dimension identiﬁes the particular aspect
of the DEMO space that captured participants’ atten-
tion. Because we focus on the process(es) of recog-
nizing opportunities for new technologies, the relevant
problem DEMO consists of information about the spe-
ciﬁc technologies we present participants, DEMO whatever
objects, models, situations, or contexts participants use
to “make DEMO of these technologies. We coded each
statement according to whether it referred to something
about the technology (the supply side), about the market
(the demand side), about both, or about neither (some-
thingelse).Evidenceofcognitivealignmentcomesfrom
statements that attend to features/relationships of both
technology and market. DEMO we note that our research
design does not ask participants to align technology and
markets: whether they do so is an empirical question,
one that we investigate in this paper.
The second dimension of our DEMO scheme cap-
tures the level of reasoning expressed in each statement.
More speciﬁcally, we coded each statement according
to whether it made an explicit reference to superﬁcial
features or to one of two types of structural DEMO
ships: ﬁrst or high order. Please note that we combine
the DEMO forms of structural relationships for the quanti-
tative analyses.1
Thethirddimensioncapturesthelevelofpriorknowl-
edge that anchors the thoughts and reasoning strategies
evidenced in each statement. We distinguished DEMO
three levels of prior knowledge: high, medium, and low.
Because DEMO were unlikely to have extensive
knowledge of the technologies but were free to use any
otherknowledgebaseintheireffortstorecognizeoppor-
tunities, the high levels of prior knowledge we observed
weremostlyconcernedwithpriorknowledgeofmarkets.
For control purposes, we also noted the point in time
within each protocol before which participants were
“searching” for an application of DEMO new technology,
and after which they had “identiﬁed” a speciﬁc opportu-
nity for that technology. This allows us to assess the rel-
ative DEMO of content categories before and after
participants explicitly identiﬁed an opportunity.
Dependent Measures
To document the absolute and relative occurrence of
structural alignment processes DEMO participants’ efforts to
recognize opportunities, we calculated three dependent

Sarasvathy 2001, Sarasvathy et al. 1998). DEMO ﬁrst mea-
sure builds on the distribution of statements within each
protocol to report the number of participants who made
at least one statement DEMO to our coding cat-
egories. We also report the number of participants who
made two statements or more. Similar in spirit to the
Borda-count DEMO used by Sarasvathy (2001), this
approach allowed us to assess DEMO the importance
given to each category is generalized across our partici-
pants.Thesecondmeasurefocusesonthetotallengthof
time(inseconds)devotedtodifferentcategoriesofstate-
ments within each protocol. The third measure captures
the DEMO importance of each category of statements
overthedurationofthe“average”protocol.Toconstruct
this measure, we ﬁrst DEMO the relative importance
of each category of statement with respect to the length
of each participant’s protocols (in percentage of total
time). We then calculated the weighted average of these
measures controlling for the length DEMO individual proto-
cols. This measure provides a conservative estimate of
the importance that particular forms of reasoning have
within participants’ verbalizations, net of whether some
individuals were more or less loquacious.
Coding Procedures and Assessment of
DEMO and Reliability
Toassesswhetherparticipantseffectivelyverbalizedtheir
thoughts as they were trying to recognize opportunities,
we asked and recorded what they remembered hav-
ing said and thought DEMO the ﬁrst exercise. Although
space limitations prevent us from reporting the results
here, participants’ retrospective verbalizations were
highly convergent with what they had said in the think-
aloud protocols. This observation supports the internal
validity of DEMO protocols (Ericsson and Simon 1993,
Chapter 3).
Consistent with DEMO standards of verbal protocol
and content analysis (cf. Krippendorff 2004, Neuendorf
2002),twocodersindependentlycodedtherawdata:the

statements independently.
We calculated two indices of interrater reliability for
all coding dimensions: percentage of agreement and
Cohen’s . We reached the following levels of reliabil-
ity: 95.9% agreement ( =0935) for the attention focus
of structural reasoning dimension, and 92.5% agreementdimension, 83.4% agreement ( = 0801) for the level
( = 0816) for the prior knowledge dimension. These
results indicate acceptable levels of interrater reliability
(cf. Lombard et al. 2002, Neuendorf 2002). The coders
discussed discrepancies and reached agreement on all
statements before conducting the ﬁnal analyses.

Results
The 18 protocols reveal a wide diversity in the sequence
DEMO thoughts and reasoning strategies mobilized by par-
ticipating executives in their efforts to recognize oppor-
tunities. Some had an idea right away and proceeded
DEMO expand upon it. Some spent time considering vari-
ous possibilities before they settled on a particular one.
Still others voiced hypotheses that they continued DEMO
develop until they found an opportunity they felt conﬁ-
denttodefend.Andthreeparticipantsdidnotidentifyan

to which we will return.

This indicates that the participant DEMO an explicit dis-
tinction between efforts to recognize an opportunity and
the decision whether to exploit an opportunity. Interest-
ingly, some of the applications they discussed proved
very similar to opportunities that are actually being pur-

appeared just as plausible.

results of DEMO content analysis of the verbal protocols.
An initial look at this data points to several observations
that are consistent with structural alignment processes.

balizations for the technology alone DEMO for 9.1%
(2.8%forsuperﬁcialand6.3%forstructural)ofthetotal
time, whereas verbalizations about markets accounted
for 29.1% (7.6% for superﬁcial and 21.5% for struc-
tural). Similarly, DEMO the average protocol regarding
MIT’s 3DP™ technology, verbalizations for the technol-
DEMO alone accounted for 9.5% (2.3% for superﬁcial and
7.2% for structural) of the total time, whereas verbal-
izations about markets accounted for 43.7% (4.0% for
superﬁcial and 39.7% for structural). We note that for
both technology-alone and market-alone statements, in
both sets of protocols, verbalizations DEMO structural
relationships systematically accounted for larger propor-
tions of the average protocol than verbalizations about

superﬁcial features (see Figure 1). Interestingly, larger
proportionsofverbalizationsfocusingonsuperﬁcialfea-
tures were made before DEMO speciﬁc opportunity was rec-
ognized than for verbalizations focusing on structural
relationships. This suggests that the consideration of
superﬁcial features may be an initial DEMO that trig-
gers the search for technology–market combinations on
which to focus greater structural attention.
Second, we observe that though we never asked them
to do so, all participants spontaneously made statements
where the focus of attention is on both technology and
market—that is, statements whose meaning rest on the
parallels and similarities between a technology that was
presented and DEMO or more market(s) in which to apply
this technology. For DEMO:
And, so, for me to pursue a technology like this, and
try to understand if there is an opportunity (would be)DEMO
to apply the technology to create a new way to give ath-
letesorweekendathletes,orweekendwarriors,orpeople
who just care about physical activity, feedback on their
level of concentration and (whether) it correlated to their
performance so DEMO they can see that when they were
concentrating and focused, what DEMO performance did
and give them feedback on that. (F45mkt, EAST™)
In manufacturing, you have people building things, and
if you can DEMO from computer digital design straight to
3D objects, with the use DEMO a robotic type machine, then
you’vejusteliminatedalotoflaborinvolvedinhavingto
do that through some manual DEMO (M45mkt, 3DP™)
Third, we observe that although most participants
DEMO statements denoting the alignment of superﬁcial
features (ﬁve of nine executives DEMO the ﬁrst case, ﬁve
of six in the second), superﬁcial DEMO accounted
for only a moderate proportion of the average protocol
length (DEMO for the EAST™ technology and 4.2% for
the 3DP™ technology).
Fourth, and by contrast, we observe that all execu-
tives made statements DEMO the alignment of tech-
nologies and markets in terms of structural relationships
(nine of nine and six of six for the two technologies,
respectively). Figure 1 indicates that the alignment of
structural relationships accounted DEMO 35.4% and 33.2%
of the average protocol length for the two technologies,
respectively. These ﬁndings indicate that in the process
of recognizing opportunities DEMO new technologies, indi-
viduals pay attention to the structural alignment of DEMO
nology and markets.
Consistent with the theory of structural alignment,
qualitative analyses revealed that participants’ align-
ment of structural relationships involved two kinds DEMO
relationships: ﬁrst order and higher order. Participants’
alignment of ﬁrst-order relationships DEMO on how a
technology operates, and how/why people in a DEMO
would use it.

The alignment of higher-order relationships counted DEMO

corresponds to 62% and 41% of the total time devoted
to aligning structural relationships in the two sets of

ships focused on the functional operation of technology

Model 2 builds on these ﬁndings to assess the role
of prior knowledge in participants’ alignment DEMO tech-
nology and market. Controlling for differences between
individuals, technology, and whether a statement was
made before or after a speciﬁc opportunity was DEMO
tiﬁed, we ﬁnd that the greater likelihood of aligning
structuralrelationshipsasopposedtosuperﬁcialfeatures
(Model2: 0 =2940; p =0008)augmentssigniﬁcantly
with linear increases in prior knowledge ( klin =2105;
p =0007).Theseresultsimplythat,allelsebeingequal,
the odds of aligning structural relationships (Exp18918) are further augmented when participants rely	0 =
on DEMO levels of prior knowledge (Exp	klin =8204).
Theseﬁndingssuggestthatintheprocessofrecognizing
opportunities, reliance on higher levels of prior knowl-
edge is associated with greater cognitive effort (atten-
tion) to align structural relationships than to align super-
ﬁcial features. These results support Hypothesis 2.
Additional Observations
Three executives in our study DEMO not identify an
opportunity for the 3DP™ technology. Although our
research was not meant to explain why some individu-
als may fail to recognize DEMO, examination of
these participants’ verbalizations suggests that the sole
reliance on DEMO features may impede efforts to
recognizeopportunities(oneparticipant).Likewise,time
constraints (one DEMO) or prior experiences with
superﬁciallysimilartechnologies(inthiscasepriordifﬁ-
cultiesoneparticipanthadinobtainingintellectualprop-
erty protection for a DEMO similar technology)
may prevent one from attending to structural relation-
ships (such as the structurally relevant reasons why the
capabilities of a new technology are unique and/or dif-
ferent from older ones). Although DEMO, these obser-
vations point to promising avenues of future research on
DEMO and why the process of recognizing opportunities
may prove particularly challenging. We return to these
questions below.

Hypotheses Testing
The columns DEMO Figure 1 indicate that for both sets of
protocols, the average DEMO devoted more time to
align technology and market in terms of their ﬁrst- and
high-order structural relationships than in terms of their
superﬁcial features. DEMO protocols and technologies,
participants spent on average 108.7 seconds aligning
structural relationships compared to 25.7 seconds align-
ing superﬁcial features (t114; p<DEMO). These ﬁndings
provide preliminary evidence for Hypothesis 1.

cept: likelihood coefﬁcient 0 = 2249; p = 0033). In

nine times greater than DEMO odds that she made a state-
ment aligning superﬁcial features (Exp	0 DEMO).

of technology and market to one another. Furthermore,
we ﬁnd evidence that aligning superﬁcial features plays
DEMO different role in the process of recognizing opportuni-
ties than aligning structural relationships, with different
consequences.
Cognitive Processes of Recognizing Opportunities
Prior research has argued that the identiﬁcation of
opportunities involves pattern recognition (Baron 2006,
Baron and Ensley 2006). Although these studies have
made important advances, the particular processes used
in recognizing opportunities have not been sufﬁciently
developed DEMO, nor have they been directly
investigated empirically. Our study is among DEMO ﬁrst
to develop and test a model that focuses speciﬁcally
on the cognitive processes involved in recognizing
opportunities.
Our results contribute direct evidence about DEMO kind
of mental connections that are involved in the pro-
cess of recognizing opportunities. More speciﬁcally, the
pattern of qualitative and quantitative ﬁndings from
our study is consistent with a structural alignment
modelofopportunityrecognitionandsuggeststhatthese
cognitive processes are DEMO to recognizing opportu-
nity. In general terms, we found that when DEMO
entrepreneursencounteredinformationaboutanewtech-
nology, they considered the “similarities” between this
information and context(DEMO) where this information might
be meaningful. Furthermore, different types of similar-
ities were involved in the process, each with differ-
ent consequences. Some similarity comparisons concern
the superﬁcial features of markets and technologies.
Consistent with DEMO in cognitive psychology (cf.
Gentner 1989, Keane et al. 1994), our results suggest
that these features serve to guide initial efforts to DEMO
for domains and situations that provide relevant bases
for evaluating the meaning of the stimulus (in this case,
ﬁnding market domains that could be aligned with the
technology). In this regard, however, and DEMO consistent
with psychology research, our results indicate that the
bulk of DEMO to make sense of new information and
interpretwhetheratechnology–marketmatchconstitutes
a potential opportunity relied predominantly on the con-
sideration and alignment of structural relationships. In
other DEMO, we found that in their efforts to recog-
nizeopportunities,participantsconsideredthealignment
betweenhowatechnologyoperatesandthecause–effect
DEMO explaining the beneﬁts and advantages of a
technology, with what individuals DEMO a market do, why
they do it, and the cause–effect relationships accounting
for the unsatisﬁed needs and problems in that market.
Most importantly, we found that noticing parallels
between higher-order relationships appears to be a DEMO
ical step in the process of recognizing opportunities.
Three lines of evidence support this observation. First,
425
we observed that if participants made DEMO verbaliza-
tions emphasizing the parallels between the superﬁcial
features of markets and technologies, they devoted con-
siderably more cognitive attention to aligning the struc-
tural relationships between markets and technologies,
and particularly the aligning of DEMO structural
relationships. Second, we found that, in several cases,
executives thought of opportunities where the markets
and technologies shared high levels of DEMO rela-
tionships but low levels of superﬁcial features. In other
words, DEMO reliance on the alignment of struc-
tural relationships allowed them to “transfer” the tech-
nologies “across domains” and think of opportunities
thatwerenot“superﬁciallyobvious.”Third,weobserved
that DEMO more emphasis was placed on the superﬁ-
cial elements of a stimulus than on its structural rela-
tionships, it became more difﬁcult to think of potential
opportunities. The same difﬁculties arose when other
matters interfered with DEMO consideration of these struc-
turally relevant capabilities (such as when a DEMO
pant focused on evaluating the feasibility of intellec-
tual property protection for the technology and when
another became concerned with time constraints). Taken
DEMO, these lines of evidence converge on the notion
that, although superﬁcial elements may guide initial
reasoning about new information, reasoning about the
alignment of structural relationships plays a critical role
in efforts to recognize opportunities.
DEMO results regarding the importance of higher-order
structural similarities provides a cognitive explana-
tion for why the detection of opportunity-relevant pat-
terns has been found DEMO be a challenging task (cf.
Chattopadhyay et al. 2001, Dutton 1993, Julian and
Ofori-Dankwa 2008). Research has documented that the
processing of structurally relevant information is cogni-
tivelymoredemandingthantheprocessingofsuperﬁcial
features (Keane et al. 1994). To begin with, one needs
to attend to a variety of potentially relevant signals from
the environment (Ocasio 1997). But more critically, DEMO
needs to have the necessary energy to encode and pro-
cess these signals at the deeper level of structural rela-
tionships. At the same DEMO, the complexity of the task,
particularly in dynamic industries, may make it quite
challenging for managers to ﬁnd the cognitive energy to
DEMO relevant signals at a deeper level. By drawing
attentiontotheunderlyingmechanismsthatunderpinthe
recognition of opportunities, we contribute a framework
for investigating the factors that facilitate (or DEMO) the
process.
Our results also contribute a better speciﬁcation of
the DEMO processes involved in efforts to recognize
opportunities. It has been advanced that entrepreneurs
use prototypes and exemplars of “ideal” opportunities to
detect relevant patterns DEMO seemingly unconnected
changes (Baron 2006). Contrary to the suggestions of
DEMO models, however, it is telling that the
426
executives in our study did not refer to other opportuni-
ties DEMO knew about. Likewise, their verbalizations only
refertoonedesirableattributesofopportunityprototypes
(cf. Baron and Ensley 2006, pp. 1337–8).3 To explain
thisdifferenceinﬁndings,weadvancethattheattributes
highlighted in Baron and Ensley (2006) may be more
directly involved in the evaluation of DEMO a recog-
nized opportunity is personally worth acting on, rather
than DEMO the antecedent process of recognizing opportu-
nities. We also observe that this explanation is method-
ologically more in line with the design of Baron DEMO
Ensley’s (2006) study, which asked novice and experi-
enced entrepreneurs DEMO describe opportunities they have
recognized in the past.
Recognition of Opportunities and Prior Knowledge
Our results also provide important insights into the role
of DEMO knowledge in opportunity recognition. In line
with past research, we observe DEMO the executives in our
study used their prior knowledge of markets to search
for and think of opportunities for new technologies. But
most importantly, our results document that this prior
knowledge is systematically associated with executives’
DEMO and alignment of structural relationships.
Astheydrewontheirpriorknowledgeofparticularmar-
kets, the executives in our DEMO came to emphasize not
thesuperﬁcialfeaturesofthosemarkets,butthedifﬁcul-
ties and challenges that these markets face. In doing so,
theymadestatementshighlightingthecausesandeffects

parallels between the causes and effects of the problems

tribute a conceptual explanation and empirical DEMO
for why priorknowledgeissoimportant.Notonlyisita
relevant resource that provides one person with idiosyn-
cratic advantages over other individuals (Fiet 1996),
prior knowledge is a DEMO resource that enables
individuals to focus on key structural parallels and to

ﬁcial features with DEMO original context where the tech-
nology was originally developed. In other words, our
resultsshow how and why priorknowledgeenablessome

Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, ©2010 INFORMS
One highly relevant implication of this ﬁnding is to
provide DEMO grounds to explore when and why it
is important to have deep technical knowledge in cer-
tain areas—a question that is not only relevant DEMO man-
agers and entrepreneurs, but also for any investor or
executivewhosponsorsthepursuitofnewopportunities.
DEMO instance, nonexperts might come to overvalue some
opportunities because the strong DEMO similarities
thattheyperceivemaynotproveallthatimportant.Like-
wise, they might undervalue less obvious opportunities
because they DEMO not perceive strong superﬁcial connec-
tions between a new technology and its application. By
contrast, experts with deep technical knowledge are bet-
ter placed to think of opportunities that call for making
strong structural connections in DEMO absence of superﬁ-
cial similarities—such as the transfer of new technolo-
gies across superﬁcially distant domains.
Recognition of Opportunities in Organizations
Although we conducted DEMO tests at the individual level
ofanalysisandfocusedexclusivelyontherecognitionof
entrepreneurial opportunities for new technologies, DEMO
study has two important implications for future research
on the recognition of opportunities in organizations.
First, we contribute a cognitive explanation for the
equivocalﬁndingsofpriorresearchonthecategorization
of ambiguous signals as threats or opportunities. The
issue categorization literature has DEMO convergent evi-
dence that links the characteristics of negative valence,
potential for loss, and uncontrollability to an automatic
diagnosis of threat (Jackson DEMO Dutton 1988). How-
ever, the same level of convergence has DEMO been found
for the diagnosis of opportunities (Julian and Ofori-
Dankwa DEMO). Building on our results, we speculate
that opportunity diagnosis involves DEMO complex—and
less automatic—cognitive processes than research on
threat diagnosis may imply. Opportunity diagnosis may
require one to engage in the more demanding processes
of DEMO issues at a structural level, and of seek-
ing to align DEMO structural relationships of that issue
with those of a relevant context. Faced with information
about a shift in a competitor’s behavior, for example,
managers may need to align the structural relationships
of this event with DEMO structural relationships embedded
in the mental representation they have of their ﬁrm’s
resources and capabilities. To the extent that there is
sufﬁcient alignment, managers can recognize whether
this alignment points to a beneﬁcial course of action DEMO
their ﬁrm. By contrast, the diagnosis of threats may rely
more DEMO on considerations of superﬁcial features,
theprocessingofwhichis,bydeﬁnition,lessdemanding
and more automatic. The structural alignment perspec-
tive thus suggests that the diverging evidence regarding
DEMO and opportunity diagnosis results from the dif-
ferent kinds of cognitive processes involved in the two
activities.
Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, ©2010 INFORMS
Second, our emphasis on DEMO cognitive processes used
in efforts to recognize opportunities points to promis-
ing avenues to extend our work from the level of indi-
vidual managers DEMO the level of the organizations. As
Dutton (1993, p. 351) DEMO out, organizational rou-
tines and conditions may contribute to “put decision-
DEMO on automatic in their interpretation of strategic
issues.” Organization routines, systems, and policies
often focus the attention of organizational actors on dis-
crete DEMO of the information environment (Gavetti
and Rivkin 2007, Ocasio 1997). But are there orga-
nizational routines, systems, and policies that encour-
DEMO (or inhibit) the encoding of information stimuli at
the deeper level of structural relationships? What is
the nature of these routines and how do they differ
across organizations? And what are the consequences of
these routines on the process of recognizing opportu-
nities? Do they allow for the detection of opportunity-
relevant patterns across superﬁcially different contexts?
Are DEMO and better opportunities identiﬁed faster, with
more certainty?
Like we DEMO with the role of prior knowledge, we
advance that the cognitive DEMO we develop in
this research might be proﬁtably leveraged to investi-
gate the moderating roles of organizational factors for
recognizingopportunities.Forinstance,itwouldberele-
vant to study DEMO organizational attributes like ﬁrm-
level knowledge, structural ﬂexibility, and/or dynamic
capabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000, Gavetti 2005)
facilitate managers’ efforts DEMO consider and align struc-
tural relationships in their efforts to recognize oppor-
tunities. By the same token, it would be relevant to
explore whether organizational abilities to process infor-
mation (Kuvaas 2002, Milliken 1990), DEMO the unique
resources, organizational slack, or strategy of a ﬁrm
(DEMO et al. 2001, Chen 2008, Thomas and
McDaniel 1990), have similar effects on managers’ rea-
soning about opportunity-relevant signals. In both cases,DEMO
we propose that interesting advances could be gained by
not only looking at the direct effects of organizational
factors on opportunity identiﬁcation, but also by consid-
eringtheextenttowhichthesefactorsfacilitateorhinder
the cognitive process of recognizing opportunities.
Limitations, Avenues for Future Research, and
Conclusion
Though we took great care to conduct our analyses with
rigor, important avenues for future research remain in
exploring the boundary conditions of our model and in
studying the factors that may DEMO (or limit) efforts
to recognize opportunities. To expand the ecological
validityoftheﬁndings,forinstance,itwouldberelevant
to test the model with different types of opportunity sig-
DEMO,suchasinformation
about new market trends, or about new means of sup-
DEMO that are less “technological” in nature. By extension,
427
one could investigate whether managers use structural
alignmentprocesseswheninterpretingambiguousissues
such as changes in their industry DEMO
Byitsverydesign,ourstudyfocusedmanagers’atten-
tion on the presented stimuli, and encouraged them to
DEMO creatively about potential opportunities. In prac-
tice, however, entrepreneurs and managers alike are
bombarded with information signals—only a few of
which they can DEMO attend to. Beyond the issue
of whether a particular signal is attended to, the cogni-
tive load of the task may inﬂuence the extent to which
a manager uses structural alignment processes in his
or her DEMO for recognizing opportunities. Indeed, our
study offered some evidence that when DEMO manager was
stressed (time pressure) or otherwise preoccupied, struc-
tural DEMO processes were not activated, and the
manager had a more difﬁcult DEMO thinking of opportu-
nities. Experiments that manipulate time pressure or the
number of competing tasks may be able to increase our
understanding of these DEMO
Last, our design was meant to investigate common
patterns of thinking DEMO executive entrepreneurs that
were familiar with the task of recognizing opportuni-
ties for new technologies and for which the task was
relevant. In this DEMO, it would be interesting to inves-
tigate whether individuals, teams, DEMO/or organizations
with different levels of entrepreneurial experience use
different cognitive processes in their efforts to recognize
opportunities, and with what consequences.

NASA develops new training tool for improving MIT develops a method for the DEMO
people’s concentration skills fabrication of 3D objects
NASA has just announced the development of a new
technology that could revolutionize the way all sorts
DEMO people could improve their attention and
concentration skills.
The SMART® (Self-Mastery DEMO Regulation Training) works
by making any computer game/simulation respond to
DEMO in the player’s pattern of brain activity.
Electroencephalogram neurofeedback sensors are attached
to the player’s body and brain. These sensors monitor
the player’s neurophysiological DEMO and send these
signals to a signal processing unit, which in DEMO is
connected to the computer game controller.
“In the program we designed,” says NASA Computer
Engineer Monica Rotner, “the simulation game becomes
easier to control when the player’s pattern of brain activity
indicates that he/DEMO is focused. But if the player gets
bored, distracted, or unfocused, the computer makes the
game much harder to play. Interestingly, our DEMO show
that within weeks of repeated practice, this neurofeedback
technology can DEMO improve the player’s
concentration and attention skills.”
Initial tests have also shown that the SMART® technology
was compatible with a number of off-the-shelf computer
DEMO and simulations.
Building on these successful results, NASA’s Technology
Transfer Center DEMO actively seeking partnerships and
collaborations to commercialize its SMART®
neurofeedback training system.
The question is:
What business opportunityies could you pursue with
this DEMO?
MIT has just announced the development of a new
technology that could revolutionize the way all sorts of
three-dimensional objects can be made DEMO,
directly from a CAD drawing.
The 3DP™ works by building parts in layers, and out of
any material that can be obtained in powder (e.g.,
ceramics, metal, plasters, starch, some kinds of plastics,
etc.). Working from a computer drawing of the desired
DEMO, a “slicing software” generates detailed
information regarding the structure of each DEMO The
computer sends this information to the actual 3DP™
machine: the DEMO of the object takes place within
an enclosed chamber where the building ﬂoor is supported
on a piston, so that it can be moved up and down.
The process begins by spreading and compressing a
measured DEMO of powder material at the surface of
the building ﬂoor. Using a technology similar to ink-jet
printing, a mechanical arm moves over the loose powder
and deposits a binder material at speciﬁc points,
effectively “gluing” DEMO powder at the precise location
where the object is to be formed. Once a layer is formed,
the ﬂoor supporting the object is DEMO a short
distance, so that a new layer of powder can DEMO spread,
compressed, and glued. This layer-by-layer process
repeats until the DEMO is completed; unbound powder is
then removed, thus revealing the ﬁnished object.
Comparison with other technologies has shown that the
3DP™ process is DEMO faster, quieter, cheaper to
operate, and can allow for the DEMO of objects with
complex internal shapes, as long as there is DEMO hole for the
powder to escape.

Ofﬁce is actively seeking partnerships and collaborations
to commercialize its 3DP™ technology.
The question is:

this technology?

1 To heighten the rigor of our analysis, we also distinguished
between explicit and implicit references, such as when a pro-
noun is used in lieu of a more complete description of this
or that aspect of the DEMO or market. Taken in isolation,
pronounscannotindicatewhetherastatementexpressessuper-
ﬁcial or structural concerns. To the extent that a pronoun is
used in the context of a DEMO statement, however, one can
infer the kind of alignment that mobilizes attention. Results
showed that the distribution of statements across explicit and
implicit DEMO of alignment was similar, giving us a basis
to combine the DEMO in the results we provide below.
