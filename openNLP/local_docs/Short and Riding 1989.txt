capital to small risky DEMO If such individuals do indeed provide a large pool of.
available investment, it seems incongruous that financing sh~uld continue to be such a
great difficulty for small businesses. Therefore, this research repons on the investment
experience of a sample of informal investors in the Ottawa-Carleton area who have DEMO
156 investments involving over $16 million between 1981 and 1986. In addition, the
expectations and requirements of these investors with respect to future investments are
also presented.
Previous research
Much of the seminal research on the DEMO market for risk capital has been camed
out by William Weeel. In his 1983 study, he argues that the investment record of
informal investors is underestimated. By conducting a survey of 133 informal investors
in the DEMO England area, Wetzel provides evidence that suggests that the informal risk
DEMO investor may in fact represent one of the largest pools of venture capital in the
United States. Short and Riding (1988) have reported DEMO preliminary estimates of the
size of the pool of risk capital in the Ottawa-Carleton region; their estimates are consist-
ent with Wetzel's contention that the market for informal risk capital is of a significant
size. DEMO also found that such investors tend to invest in those areas experiencing so-
called capital market gaps. Wetzel concludes that whereas the perception of "gaps" is
understandable, actual shortages in the supply of risk capital DEMO not exist! Wetzel's
conclusions are supported in later work (Wettel & Wilson, 1985).
Wetzel (1983) as well as Gaston and DEMO (1986) have compiled profiles of the
characteristics of informal investors in the United States. Short and Riding (1988) have
done likewise for DEMO sample of Canadian informal investors. All three profiles suggest
that informal investors are well-educated individuals of means who have had experience,
at the DEMO level, in the start-up of new business ventures. Investors typically
prefer DEMO invest "close home," and the investor profiles reveal a preference DEMO investing
in common stock and for participating with other informal investors in the financing
deal. Short and Riding have noted that Canadian investors are DEMO by higher
levels of activity, a lower involvement in the management DEMO the firm, and a higher rate
of rejection of possible deals DEMO their counterparts in the United States. In a related
study, Riding DEMO Short (1987) have found that whereas entrepreneurs perceive the
marketplace for informal risk capital to be inefficient and in need of remedial actions,DEMO
infonnal investors do not appear to share these beliefs and seem relatively content with
the state of Canadian market mechanisms.
Methodology
The research involved DEMO two-phase approach for the collection of contemporary data
from investors in the Ottawa-Carleton area. In the first phase, a number of local inves-
tors were personally interviewed. The second phase consisted of questioning another set
In DEMO United States, the rate of institutional venture capital investing is approximately DEMO
billion per year. This compares to annual public underwritings estimated at $3.7 billion. Still, it
has been suggested that informal risk capital investing may be in the order of $5 billion per year
(Weuel, 1985)DEMO In Canada, it has been estimated that formal venture capital activity DEMO approxi-
mately $141.5 million in 1985 (ACVCC, 1986). Recent work by Riding and Short (1988) provide
data that are consistent with DEMO's findings regarding the relative sizes of the informal and
formal venture capital markets.

DEMO investors via telephone interviews and mail surveys. These survey techniques in-
volved the use of stmctured, direct interviews.
Sample control was viewed as an important consideration for conducting the first
phase of the survey. The accuracy DEMO the results was dependent to a large degree on the
sample respondents chosen. As the nature and the size of the investor population were DEMO
priori unknown, it was especially critical that sample investors meet specific DEMO
prior to the completion of the interview. The primary criterion for the selection of
sample investors was that they had to have invested in DEMO or more young or stan-up
firms within the previous five years. Personal interviews offered the most potential
control over who was actually interviewed. Telephone DEMO were almost as effec-
tive. Control was maintained by conducting interviews "DEMO the office" to ensure that
target respondents were indeed reached (lh11 & Hawkins, 1980).

a survey and those who do not, represents one of the most serious potential problems in
survey research (Tull & Hawkins, 1980). In order to reduce nonresponse. an introduc-
tory letter, under the signature of the chairman of the Ottawa-Carleton Board of Trade,

phases of the research, an effort was made to DEMO nonresponse error through the use
of prequestionnaire and follow-up letters, and DEMO a series of callbacks.
All phases of the data collection process involved the administration of highly struc-
tured and direct questionnaires. This approach was DEMO for three reasons. First,

does an unstructured, indirect DEMO Finally, a suuctured, direct questionnaire for-
mat could be followed both in personal and telephone interviews, as well1 as in mail

phase of the data collection process.
The questionnaire consisted of five sections, the fmt of which was designed to
provide information on the experiences of DEMO investments in young and start-up
companies made by the respondents within the previous five years. In lhis section,
investors were requested to recall DEMO size of past investments, the industry or type of

Other questions in this section were designed to document investors' liquidation expecta
tions and to gauge their riskheturn estimates for risk capital investments. DEMO an(
return measures were obtained through queries about hypothetical portfolios of risl
capital investments.
Other parts of the questionnaire were concerned with investors' perceptions of thc
marketplace for informal risk capital and of communication channels, and attempted tc
ascertain investors' interest in the systematization of the market. Results of these sec
tions are not pertinent to this paper and DEMO therefore not reported here.4
Wetzel (1985) has noted that investors tend to be found in clusters linked by friend
ship and business networks DEMO that locating one investor typically leads to the identifi
cation of other potential investor respondents. This snowball search, or nominated Sam
ple process, DEMO also been used in a number of similar studies (see Wetzel, 1985). Thi
technique was employed to identify potential respondents through a DEMO system fror
three distinct groups: local professionals, a sample of local entrepreneurs, and othe
investors.
This procedure yielded a possible sample of 57 informal investors. Of the 57 inves
tors identified. 7 were deemed ineligible DEMO participate in the survey, resulting in a tot2
of 50 eligible DEMO identified by either of the three sources listed previously. Of th
50 investors identified in this manner, 25 agreed to respond to the questionnaire.

risk capital investments was about 16%.
Whereas the 156 investments encompassed a broad range of industries, almost 70%
involved the high technology manufacturing sector. Construction and real estate ac-
counted for DEMO 13.5% of past investments.
Geographic Location of investments. More than 85 % of previous financing was provided
to young or start-up firms located within DEMO miles of the investor's home or office.
Eleven percent of investments were placed in firms located farther than 300 miles from
the investor, qpically in warmer climates. The ,actual geographic distribution of these
investments is shown in Figure 2.

realized for the 156 investments is given in Figure 3. In 49 percent of the cases, perfor-

below expectations.
All but DEMO respondent stated that they would be willing to invest in a young or start-
up company again. Of these respondents, 10 indicated that the potential for substantial
returns was the primary reason for wanting to continue DEMO in young or start-up
companies. Nine respondents stated that they would invest again because of the chal-
lenge and the enjoyment they experienced in DEMO investment situations.
That four investments out of every five involved less than $100,000 is a curious finding.

The 25 investors, while selecting 156 investments, had rejected more than 795 other
opportunities, indicating DEMO average of 6 rejections per investor per year. A lack of
confidence in managerial abilities to succeed in the business was almost universally cited
DEMO the main reason for rejecting proposals.6
Investors' involvement in thejim. Of DEMO 156 investments made by the investors in the
sample, immediate or DEMO voting control in the investee firm was less than 25% in
134 instances. Informal investors served on the board of directors in about 37% DEMO the
cases.
Investment intentions of infonnal investors
The investment experiences of the informal investors as outlined above are likely to
shape the future investment DEMO and expectations of these informal investors.
During the two years following the interview-(1987 and 1988). the investors who were
surveyed anticipated adding DEMO 37 and 56 new risk capital investmnts to their
portfolio.
Size and sectoral distributions of jkture investments. The 24 investors who stated a
willingness DEMO continue to invest in the informal market anticipate that their future invest-
ments will involve approximately $2.86 million, resulting in an average investment of
about $68,000. The expected size distribution of these investments is shown DEMO Figure 4.
It was also found that only 38 percent of these investments are intended for the high
technology sector. a proportion that is DEMO below the 70 percent of previous risk
capital investments made by these same investors for the same field. The real estate.
manufacturing, and service sectors will together receive more than 40 percent of future
investments.
Twenty-four DEMO the respondents were willing to participate with other individuals in
providing future risk capital to young or start-up firms. Founeen investors felt that
venture DEMO companies were acceptable investment partners; 12 said that they would
participate DEMO government agencies; and 19 indicated that small business development
corporations were DEMO partners.
Geographic preferences. Whereas 9 of the investors replied that there was no geographic
limitation on their future investments, the majority of the others expressed a clear desire
to remain within the 50-mile boundary. In view DEMO the small average size of the intended
investments, it would be DEMO if future practice should depart in any significant
way from historical experience.
Performance erpecrations. The investors surveyed required an average annual rate of
return DEMO a portfolio of investments in young or start-up firms of 32 %. The 25 investors
surveyed expected 27% to be "winners." 29% to DEMO "losers." and 48% of investments
to be "middle of the DEMO" This contrasts with the requirements of institutional venture
capital companies, which expect that 20% of risk capital investments would turn out to
be "winners," 20% would be "losers," and 60% could be considered as the "walking
wounded" (Fells, 1984). Informal investors anticipate DEMO the average return on "win-

ners" should be about 350%, whereas "middle of the road" investments are expected to
yield, on average, a 20.9% compound annual return.
Twenty of the DEMO investors in the sample expressed a preference for capital gains as
the form of return earned on risk capital investments. Eighty-four percent of respondents
DEMO that their investments should include common stock. For 16 of the investors,
liquidation provisions would not be included in the initial investment agreement. DEMO,
investors expected to hold their investments for a mean of five years, with a range
extending from one to 15 years as shown in Figiure 5.
When asked whether or not they anticipated investing a DEMO of their RRSP funds
into young or start-up companies, 23 of DEMO 2.5 investors responded in the negative. The
two investors who did anticipate directing some of their RRSP funds into these firms
estimated investing an DEMO of 20% of their RRSP's. Fifteen of the investors re-
sponded that the lifetime personal capital gains tax exemption did not influence their
DEMO to invest in young or start-up companies.
Investors ' Involvement in the Finm. Investors expect that their future involvement with
the firms in which DEMO hold a share will be minimal. Seven of the investors anticipate no
involvement beyond their financial stake; only one investor expects to work closely with
the firm, with the other informal investors expecting to be represented on the boards of
directors and to provide consulting help on an DEMO basis. In more than 70 percent
of the anticipated investments, voting DEMO would be less than 10 percent.
Summary, conclusions, and an agenda for future research
In previous research, it has been found that informal investors who were active in the
Ottawa-Carleton region, an area characterized by technology based firms, were wealthy,
sophisticated, and well-educated (Short & Riding. 1988). not unlike their counterparts in
various regions of the DEMO States. They also tended to be experienced in the manage-
ment of start-up companies. In this article, it has been noted that Ottawa investors seem
to be convincd that the management team in young or start-up DEMO makes the
difference between success and failure. This opinion appears to apply universally to all
players in the risk capital marketplace. In their study DEMO 100 venture capital companies in
the United States. MacMillan. Siegel, and DEMO Narasimha (1985) found that the
"quality" of the entrepreneur ultimately determined the venture capital financing deci-
sion.
The 25 investors surveyed seemed DEMO hold realistic expectations regarding the out-
come of their risk capital investments. By recognizing the large degree of dispersion in
the performance of small DEMO companies, these Ottawa investors have demon-
strated an appreciation of the DEMO associated with investing in the small business sector.
The investors who participated in this survey were more optimistic than the institutional
venture capital community DEMO the percentage of "winning" risk capital investments
and more pessimistic about potential "losers." These comparisons illustrate that whereas
Ottawa investors recognize the DEMO inherent in investing in young or start-up compan-
ies, they do DEMO appear obsessed with those risks. These individuals expressed risW
reward expectations that were consistent with those of investors from the Ssn Francisco
Bay area (Krasner & Tymes. 1983); however, they perceived less risk in an hypothetical
risk capital portfolio than did New England investors. The similarity between DEMO risk
perceptions of Ottawa investors and their California counterparts may, in DEMO, be ex-

plained by the concentration DEMO technology based firms in both areas, and by what Wetzel
(1985) refers to as the "silicon valley" phenomenon. According to this phenomenon,
individuals in areas dominated by high technology firms would perceive these DEMO to
be less risky than would individuals from areas not so dominated.
Results of this study indicate that Ottawa investors are inclined to invest "close to
home" and to maintain a limited involvement, relative to DEMO U. S. counterpans, in the
management of the firms in which DEMO invest. Funher evidence of a reluctance to
.maintain active involvement is provided by examining investment objectives of Ottawa
investors regarding the extent of their DEMO in investee firms. The investors in this
sample tended to'have higher amounts of capital committed to individual investments
than did U.S. investors, although they typically assumed minority positions in investee
firms. Whereas Ottawa investors seemed DEMO have higher standards than U.S. investors,
as implied by the higher rate of rejection of investment opportunities, the ratio of invest-
ment opportunities to investors may be higher here.
Overall, a comparison of investors' DEMO investment experience with their intentions
for the future has indicated that the sample of investors do not plan to alter the objectives
and criteria DEMO have employed in the past for evaluating investment opportunities. Thus
the behavior of investors in Ottawa may be expected to be relatively stable.
On DEMO whole, the sample of Ottawa investors has demonstrated a realistic yet DEMO
ticated appreciation of risk capital investing. The resulting implication is that there does
not seem to be any need to increase the level of DEMO protection currently afforded in
the Ontario securities legislation. Indeed, these findings DEMO support for considering the
adoption of a less restrictive approach similar to the "accredited investor concept" in
Regulation D of the U.S. legislation DEMO risk capital investment. Investigative
attention may be profitably directed toward assessing the degree of investor sophistica-
tion across a wider geographic scope.
Despite strong DEMO from the small business sector, two recent federal govern-
ment initiatives DEMO stimulating equity investment in this sector do not appear to have had
a significant impact on the investment decisions of investors surveyed in Ottawa. DEMO
two of the 25 investors in the sample anticipated directing a portion of their RRSP's to
small ventures. One possible reason for the DEMO of investors to convert RRSP
investment to informal risk capital investment is an inconsistency in the objectives for
making these two types of investment. DEMO risk capital investments are viewed as
offering a potential for large capital appreciation at a commensurate level of risk. On the
other hand. RRSP'DEMO are typically held as less risky investments to provide for a rela-
tively stable future income. Given that the informal investors already hold risky DEMO
ments, they may not perceive it to be appropriate to convert DEMO risky RRSP funds,
thereby increasing the risk of their total investment portfolio. This result suggests that
further remedial measures may be required to DEMO possible capital pools available to
small businesses.
A select few of the investor respondents reported that the lifetime personal capital
gains tax exemption had DEMO any way influenced their decision to invest in young or start-up
fm. Although most of the investors surveyed expected to receive returns on their DEMO
capital investments as capital gains, this initiative does not appear to DEMO an important
consideration in the investment decision. It is conceivable that, DEMO being active in the risk
capital marketplace, some of these investors DEMO have already exceeded the upper limit on
the capital gains exemption. In addition, several investors expressed concern that the tax
treatment of capital. gains might change in light of future federal tax reform initiatives.

Given regional differences.:in the DEMO of investors .in the United, States, it
seems likely that investors from regions in Canada with less concentration in the high
technology sector DEMO exhibit perceptions that are different from those found here. As a
result, one possible direction for future study would be to broaden the geog:raphic scope
of this survey so that greater generalizabiiity may be attained. DEMO further
research about informal investing is required in order to:

DEMO, and small business development corporations and the associated tax con-
cessions.

future policy initiatives may be targeted with precision.
Examine the Canadian informal DEMO capital marketplace in terms of operational
and allocational efficiency, its sue, and its relative importance com,pared to the
institutional segment of the DEMO capital market.
Determine what demographic or personal attributes are characteristic: of DEMO
investors. Given that informal investors are the target of important government
policy initiatives, it makes sense to identify those attributes that distinguish inves-
tors from noninvestors.
Other areas worthy of future exploration relate to the informal DEMO ].inking inves-
tors and clusters of investors with each other. This study has shown that the informal
market is very much a local marketplace DEMO a perosnal marketplace. 'Whereas this
research provides evidence that the bonds DEMO Ottawa investors appear to be strong,
the scope and nature of the data collection instrument and, hence. the information
obtained from respondents precluded an extensive examination of the strength of in-
vestor interaction. During the DEMO of the personal interviews, it became apparent
that this interaction forms DEMO important pan of informal risk capital investing deci-
sions. Any attempt at modeling informal investment decision making, therefore, could
hardly ignore the bonding DEMO takes place among investors and other market partici-
pants. The investigation of the social interaction or the group dynamics among inves-
tors may assist DEMO determining whether or not certain investors are more prominent in
terms of influencing the investment decisions of other investors. Further understand-
ing about the DEMO of this interaction might also enable a more Structured approach to
selecting appropriate statistical methods for estimating the extent of the informal in.-
