FROM STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY TO PRACTICE:
SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSITION*
DEMO W. CONRATHtt
University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario
While considerable progress has been made in the development of sophisticated
statistical decision models, little attention has been paid to the problem of applying
them in the "real world". This paper approaches one aspect of the necessary con-
version DEMO, namely the conceptualization and use of probabilistic data for
decision making. DEMO points are demonstrated on the basis of clinical experimental
evidence: (1) decision makers have difficulty conceiving of probability distributions,
rather they are more comfortable with point estimates; (2) the concept of "risk DEMO
failure", the probability of failing to meet a perceived target, DEMO a major role in
choice; and (3) the format in DEMO probabilistic data are presented can affect choice
behavior. A simple descriptive decision model is then developed, based on both the
clinical evidence and two years of observation of a committee empowered to invest in
new product DEMO and product expansion activities.
A tremendous growth in the literature on decision theory (or in more general terms,
on tools for decision making) has taken place over the past twenty years. The major
thrust, DEMO from the operations research use of mathematical programming and
computer simulation models, has been in the area of statistical decision theory. Bayes-
ian decision models have become popular, but so has stochastic programming and
other more classical aspects of statistical decision theory. No one seriously doubts
that great DEMO has been made in both theory and modelling, but a relevant DEMO
tion still remains: how difficult is it to pass along the DEMO from theory or model to
application?
The path appears to be particularly difficult when one speaks of applying some of
the more classical DEMO of statistical decision theory, those that rely on the use of
DEMO order moments of a probability distribution. The purpose of this paper is to
provide some insight on the problems along this particular path, via a clinical ex-
periment, and to present a simple descriptive model of choice based on considerable
field research of organizational decision making. We are DEMO to concentrate our
attention on one of the key links in the conversion of theory to application: the con-
ceptualization and use of probabilistic data for decision making.
A Clinical Experiment
Three points will be demonstrated DEMO a rather simple clinical experimental situa-
tion. One, decision makers are DEMO likely to think (and estimate) in terms of probabil-
ity distributions. Rather, they are much more comfortable with point estimates,
and therefore use them. Bayesian models, for example, usually accommodate this
limitation. Two, decision makers can understand and do make use of the concept
of DEMO probability of "failure." This has been recognized by others (e.g. DEMO [12]),
though there is still a tendency to combine the DEMO of failure with more sophis-

ticated measures. Three, the manner in which probabilistic data are presented for
use as the basis for choice can influence DEMO, a point this author has not seen men-
tioned in the DEMO
The specific experiment involved nine subjects, five members of an executive DEMO
mittee empowered to decide whether or not to invest in proposed new product de-
velopments, and four members of their staff. The experimental data were gathered
during a one-day course in "risk analysis" that had DEMO proposed by a member of
the corporate staff. Most of the lecture material concerned the use of statistical data,
but this was heavily DEMO with cases and situations involving the kind of de-
cisions that the committee and its staff had faced in the past and would face DEMO in
the immediate future.
The experiment was not designed to provide a basis for statistically significant
results, such as those that are yielded by most controlled laboratory studies. Rather,
the intention was to demonstrate actual DEMO behavior as exhibited by
relatively successful executives in an environment in which most of their decisions
are made, and on choice situations with which they have a continuing concern. We
willingly sacrificed the rigor that one DEMO obtain in a purely artificial situation to
obtain data from the potential users of decision theory. The "experimental setting"
was chosen on the personal belief of the author that we know a considerable amount
about DEMO behavior of college students, but we know little, other than documented
case histories, about decision making by mature, experienced businessmen.
Estimating Future DEMO Concept of a Distribution
At the beginning of the day each of the men was provided a statement of all of the
then current DEMO forecast information available from marketing planning per-
sonnel, including sales estimates DEMO related products now in production, for two
products then in the DEMO stage. A third case was given to them at the end of the
day after they had been exposed to material on density functions, cumulative dis-
tributions, and several techniques of risk analysis. After each case the subjects were
asked: "What is your estimate of future sales?"
While the estimates varied considerably, and some were made in terms of unit
sales and others by dollar volume, in only two instances, for all three cases, did anyone
make anything more sophisticated than DEMO point estimates.' The first case involved
a product that was the DEMO controversial to all concerned. One member of the com-
mittee gave estimates for the 0.05, 0.50 and 0.90 points on the cumulative distribu-
tion, perhaps to demonstrate his confidence in his estimates (he wanted the DEMO),
and to indicate to us that he understood the essence DEMO what we were to teach. The
second case concerned the most controversial product, one for which there were strong
feelings both pro and con. Furthermore, it involved entrance into a hitherto untapped
market, and therefore DEMO uncertainty. In this instance one person refused
to do more than make a few qualitative statements. The other eight all made point
estimates. Because DEMO product was controversial, and because little was known about
this new DEMO, the high and low estimates differed by a factor of 50.
DEMO six hours of risky decision-making cases and lectures, the third case DEMO
analyzed. Presumably, there was reason to believe that a more sophisticated DEMO
might have been taken. Only one person, however, did anything more than make a
1 One observer suggested that perhaps this was due DEMO a perception of a time constraint held by
the participants. While this is a possibility, those persons who took the longest time in making
their estimates spent the time in writing out rationalizations of their choices.

point estimate. He merely added DEMO notation, "?t25 %." In discussions with all of
the participants afterwards it was quite clear that none of them visualized anything
approaching DEMO probability distribution of sales.2 In every case all they could do was
give their "best guess." The author attended committee meetings for almost DEMO
years, and the three case analyses merely confirm what has been DEMO over time.
The concept of a probability distribution from the standpoint of estimation is not a
concept with which the committee members are comfortable. DEMO like the idea of
using it (the raison d'etre for DEMO "course"), but they would prefer that others form
the distribution, and on a basis which they can understand.
Uses of Probabilistic Data-The "Risk of Loss" Parameter
Let us assume, for the sake of the argument that follows, that sufficient data are
available to form a meaningful probability distribution of outcomes. An obvious
question is: How will these data be used?
Both descriptive and normative decision model builders generally DEMO to incorpor-
ate more than just the first moment of the density function (e.g. Alderfer and Bier-
man [3] and Mao [11]). While Alchian [2] has noted quite effectively that among two
alternative cumulative distributions DEMO outcomes one can be said to be better than
the other only if it lies entirely without the other, many must make choices under
other than these decisive circumstances. The reason for relying on higher moments
DEMO that the decision maker is assumed to have a utility function that is not linearly
related to the measurement of the outcome variable being DEMO, and/or he has
utility that is not indifferent to the DEMO distribution of that variable. If the
conditions assumed by von Neumann and Morgenstern [19] for the generation of a
utility function hold, and if one's utility function is linear with respect to the variable
expressing DEMO outcomes, then the mean is sufficient datum for input into one'DEMO de-
cision model. However, if we wish to allow for more DEMO (and more realistic)
utility functions, presumably the more information one has about the probability
distribution of outcomes the better.
Many decision model DEMO have proposed the variance of the distribution as a
key parameter for a decision maker's consideration (e.g. Markowitz [13]), especially
since it incorporates the common concept of risk-the greater the variance the greater
the "risk." The argument is essentially that a wider variance is an indication of greater
uncertainty. Since most of us appear to have an "aversion" to uncertainty, we would
prefer to choose an alternative with a DEMO variance, all other things being equal.
Of course, all other things are usually not equal, but as yet we have little guidance
as to what the trade-offs between mean and variance might be or ought DEMO be.
While the variance is useful when the utility for measurable outcomes and their
likelihoods is complex, so is the third moment about the mean, the measure of skew-
ness (Alderfer and Bierman [3]). DEMO fact, one ought to have a complete specification of
the distribution DEMO outcomes that are possible for each alternative action. Perhaps
this is one reason why simulation models of action/outcome relationships have be-
come popular (e.g. Salazar and Sen [18]). They provide a feasible mechanism for
DEMO Mao [12] found similar results among the number of financial executives he interviewed. One
referee stated: "the tendency to use point estimates rather DEMO probability distributions follows
from the well-known limited capacity of persons to notice and process data". If the Miller [141
phenomenon is relevant here, then this is a very strong argument for the simplification of norma-
DEMO models for choice under uncertainty, a conclusion reached via a different DEMO at the
end of this paper.

comparing expected utilities when the characteristics (functional form) of the dis-
tributions of outcomes and states-of-nature are difficult to determine.
Let us look at some more evidence taken from the committee members DEMO
for selecting appropriate capital investments. Eight members (one had to be DEMO
for this part of the study) were asked to make a DEMO of paired comparisons among
three possible investment alternatives, leading to a DEMO ordering. The data were
presented in the form of twenty equi-spaced points along the cumulative probability
distribution of internal rates of return (ROR) DEMO investment, based on a discounted
cash flow procedure3 (see Table I).4 In all, three paired comparisons could be deter-
mined from their responses.
In one paired comparison (A vs. B) A had a DEMO ROR that was 7.5 % higher
(41.3 - 33.8) than that of B, while A's standard deviation was 6.4 versus 2.0. Seven
out of eight decision makers chose A, despite the greater variance. This is what one
would expect, since only the bottom 0.10 of the cumulative of B had a higher ROR
than A. A third alternative, C, was compared with B. C was skewed to the high side.
C's mean ROR was 4.3 higher than B's, and though C's standard deviation was 7.5
versus 2.0, its cumulative was strictly to the right. Again, 7 of 8 men chose C over B.
The reason for the exception will be discussed later.
So far the DEMO are those one would expect. But now C was compared with A
Despite a lower mean (a difference of 3.2 % ROR) and DEMO larger variance, C was chosen
over A by 6 of the DEMO Furthermore, C's cumulative was to the right of A's DEMO for the
bottom and top 10 percentile of ROR's along the distribution. One could argue that C
was preferred because of utility functions, for percent ROR, that had a large positive
second derivative-utility functions that gave more weight to increments at the higher
end of the ROR DEMO This, however, would be contrary to virtually all we know
about the values held by those responsible for maintaining a portfolio of investments.
DEMO the contrary, it was obvious to the author that the opposite DEMO the case for the
men concerned.
Take another look at Table I, and in particular look at the number of points where
the ROR is below 30 %. This was a figure that 6 of the DEMO stated was the minimum
rate of return on investment (L) required for a project to be approved (apparently
the ROR had to be suifficiently high to overcome overhead and exploratory research
expenses not capitalized). DEMO respect to this "risk of loss" criterion, C dominated
both DEMO and B, and A could be rationalized over C only on DEMO basis that A's mean was
substantially higher. But its mean was not enough higher than C's to make A suffi-
ciently attractive DEMO overcome the apparent fact that C offered a near zero probability
of "failure"-an ROR below L.
The use of variance (or, more appropriately, dispersion) as perceived by the par-
ticipants was also of DEMO On the one hand it was used to indicate the likelihood
of failure-it helped the individual make his own point estimate of the probability
DEMO the ROR might be less than 30 %. On the other, DEMO one person who chose B
over C stated that C's spread was so wide that he doubted if it accurately reflected the

true market picture. The fact that the dispersion was great DEMO him with the
rationale to shift the entire distribution downward, increasing DEMO likelihood that the
ROR would be below L. He felt the narrow range of B meant that they had "a good
grip on things," and hence he could be reasonably confident that the data were DEMO
researched. Thus, the distribution may be evidence not only to be DEMO at face value,
but it may be used as a measure of data reliability. This perturbs the use of any statis-

tical data, while at the same time it is entirely understandable from a behavioral
point of view.
Another insight regarding DEMO importance of obtaining at least a 30 % ROR can be
had from the results of a questionnaire, one question of which asked the respondent
to state the mean value ROR for a distribution with a DEMO % chance of being below 30 %
ROR, which would balance DEMO desirability of that alternative with another one with
no chance of an ROR below 30 %, but a mean value of only 35 %. Four of the nine
responding stated 50 %, two others 45 %, while two staff members gave a much higher
figure and another an ROR of 39.5 %. Hence, what is relatively important is the prob-
ability that a return will be less than L.5 Only to a DEMO extent does the mean in-
fluence choice, and the variance is DEMO as having only indirect effects. There is a
limit to which the disparity of probabilities below L can be countered by higher
means. At DEMO point the dispersion is perceived as so great that at best the persons
involved in making the estimates will be asked to make another DEMO when they have
"more and better information."
Mode of Data DEMO
In all of the literature on decision making, and in particular DEMO on statistical
decision theory, little if anything has been said about DEMO form in which the data
should be presented to the decision maker.6 Perhaps this is because most theoreticians
assume that as long as the DEMO unambiguously define the distributions, the format
of presentation should make no DEMO This brings up the question of whether
data can ever be unambiguously presented, and perhaps more importantly, in whose
eyes? The only answer to the second question is the user, but he has seldom been
asked.
To determine the impact that format might have, the same probability distribu-
tions that were used to generate A, B and C were also used to generate X, Y and Z,
and were presented to the decision maker as in Table II, shortly after the first set
(coffee was served at their seats between the two sets).
The subjects were asked to rank order these investment opportunities, and the
resulting ranks were compared with those made earlier on A, B and C. The desire to
be consistent (mentioned by at least two persons) should have had the effect of making
the orderings the same, DEMO there was no reason other than data format as to why
the rankings should have varied. The results, however, were that 5 of DEMO 8 changed
their rank ordering, and in 4 instances the investment DEMO as most desirable was
different. Two persons switched from C to A (using the old lettering scheme), one
from C to B, DEMO one from A to C. Apparently the format used in the second analysis,
with the exception of one respondent, lessened the fear of going below L, and greater
concentration was paid to the probability of being above a 35 % and 40 % ROR. The
differences among DEMO cumulative probabilities were not nearly so obvious when
twenty points on the cumulative were given, though presumably the twenty points
gave the decision maker more information. As others have noted in different con-
texts (e.g. Parry [15, pp. 85ff.]), perhaps the earlier set of data provided more informa-
tion than the subjects could handle easily. Whatever the conclusion one DEMO make
about information overload, the format did affect potential choice.
Additional DEMO can be presented regarding format and the sensitivity to L.
5 For further support of this assertion see Mao [12].
6 This is quite DEMO considering the results of Costello and Zalkind [7, p. 381], among
others.

Among several questions, three sets of two alternatives were DEMO each com-
mittee member (Table III). Each person was to DEMO his preference in each case. As
one can see, not only DEMO the probability of going below L (30 % ROR) vary, DEMO did
the mean ROR, but in only one instance was the DEMO probability stated for L.
In that case (the choice between D DEMO E) 8 out of 9 felt that the advantage of a DEMO %
higher mean ROR for the second alternative was not sufficiently great to overcome
the 0.00 versus 0.05 probability of going below a 30 DEMO ROR. The one remaining per-
son found himself essentially indifferent between the two.
This is what we would expect based on our earlier discussion. DEMO let us look at
the choices made between alternative investments F and G. If we assume that these
two symmetric distributions are also normal, we find that the probabilities of being
below L are 0.000 and DEMO for F and G respectively. The gap between the means,
however, is 10 percentage points, so we would expect that more persons DEMO choose
G over F than E over D. In fact, four DEMO nine persons so chose.
But now look at the choice between H and J. Again, if we assume a normal dis-
880

W. CONRATH
tribution of ROR's, based on the three points given, the probability that the ROR
will be less than 30 % for H and J is 0.005 and 0.063 respectively. Since the DEMO between
the mean ROR's is also 10 % points, one DEMO expect fewer persons would choose J
over H than chose G over F. The converse, however, was true. Three persons who had
chosen DEMO over G chose J over H. All three persons mentioned that when choosing F
over G they wanted to go for the "sure thing." However, in the case of H versus J,
neither was DEMO sure, but J had a higher average ROR, and thus they pre-
ferred J. They were all unwilling to extrapolate a 0.10 chance DEMO being below 40 %
ROR to a near zero chance of being below 30 %. In addition, one person now noted
the high side, and suggested that ROR's of 85 % and 60 % at 0.10 on the cumulative
distributions were sufficiently different to ignore the approximately DEMO ROR's
on the low side.
Other examples could be stated, DEMO enough have been given to demonstrate that
data format can influence choice. Apparently format has the characteristic that it can
focus one's attention DEMO one dimension of the choice space, and that dimension be-
comes DEMO in the decision process. For example, the first of the two DEMO
allowed an easy comparison between the probabilities that a project would yield an
ROR below L. The second, however, made for an easy DEMO among the prob-
abilities that a return would be greater than two acceptable levels of return, 35 %
and 40 %. Thus, something DEMO similar to the comparison of the entire distributions
was undertaken. This ability to focus attention on one factor in a multi-dimensional
choice space has DEMO been understood on Madison Avenue, but for some reason
decision theorists DEMO chosen to ignore it. In fact, this author would explain the DEMO
lais' Paradox [4] on just this basis alone. One presentation focuses DEMO on the
chance of no return at all, no matter how DEMO the chance. The other comparison
focuses attention on the high side, DEMO thus something more like an expected value
operator governs choice.
Whether the attention focusing attributes of data format are the keys to the influence
DEMO format has on choice is a question not yet resolved. But the question would
appear to be sufficiently important that it should no longer DEMO ignored.
A Descriptive Model of Decision Making Under Risk
Trhe model, DEMO we believe it to be rather general, is based on two DEMO of attend-
ance at committee proceedings and on numerous interviews with both committee
members and the persons who supplied the committee with the data DEMO was to pro-
vide the base for decision making. A first observation is that at no time were different
investment opportunities compared to each DEMO, the "better" ones being chosen.
Rather, the processes were similar to those described by Cyert and March [8]. Each
project was dealt DEMO sequentially, and compared to a perceived standard of accepta-
bility.
The DEMO reasons for the sequential process appear to be twofold. First, requests
DEMO funding authorization were spaced throughout the year. Thus, the committee
members DEMO not perceive an opportunity to make comparisons among more than two
or three projects at a time. Secondly, and perhaps of greater significance, DEMO project
was viewed as having unique aesthetic and technological characteristics. Though the
decision of whether or not to fund a project supposedly was made DEMO on finan-
cial grounds, the perception of the marketability of a DEMO product was influenced
by personal predilections regarding consumer needs and product appeal. Furthermore,
consideration was given to how a proposed product might fit DEMO the product line,

though demand interdependencies were never DEMO on anything more than a
qualitative level. Thus, the belief of DEMO uniqueness made it most difficult to com-
pare one project with another, especially on any quantitative basis. The decision of
whether or not to pursue the development of a particular product, therefore, was
essentially a DEMO/one phenomenon.
Choice, C, appears to be directly related to three exogenous variables, each of which
acts as a constraint when the other two are held constant. The variables are: L-the
internal rate of return (or more generally, the utility) below which one is viewed as
having "failed"; p-the probability that the return might be less than L; and
e-the "expected" return on investment. C = c (DEMO, p, e).
L appears to be truly independent, and DEMO based on the collective perception of the
committee members about the return on investment that must be demonstrated to
the Board of Directors to DEMO their approval to release the requested funds. The shorter
the supply of capital, the higher L is perceived to be, and with justification DEMO on
the Board's responses to past proposals.
p is a more complex parameter. It is directly related to: (a) the significance of the
research and development effort required for the particular product, as it might per-
tain to other products in the future; (b) the importance of a product to complete or
complement a product line; and (c) the "appeal" of the proposed product-its impact
on corporate DEMO All three factors influencing the acceptable level of p reflect
economic externalities with respect to the product proposed, but ones which are most
difficult to measure, the uncertainty of the effects of the interdependencies being very
great. As Raiffa [171 has noted, with so much uncertainty a "DEMO of the pants" ap-
proach is usually used, hence the qualitative effect (directional only) that each factor
has on p.
e, the expected return on investment, has the effect one would expect. The greater e,
the more likely the proposal will be accepted. But e, as a constraint parameter, is also
directly related with p. All other things being equal, the higher is e, the higher the
permissible DEMO Furthermore, the relative importance of p and e may be affected DEMO the
manner in which the financial data are presented, as we DEMO already demonstrated.
Some formats have a tendency to focus attention on p, while others increase the rela-
tive importance of e as the basis for choice.
Though an investment opportunity presented in one form may be DEMO by
making the appropriate trade-offs clear, it might later be accepted DEMO the same data
base. Often the result of committee deliberations is that a new format is presented by
the proponents of an investment that DEMO makes it acceptable to those concerned. In
fact, if one were DEMO view decision making as a "0, ?, 1" process, DEMO it frequently
appears to be (0 is rejection, 1 acceptance, DEMO ? is a postponement), the ? arises when
there is the possibility that "new data" (really a revised presentation of existing data)
may, in fact, make it clearer regarding whether the choice DEMO 0 or 1. The ? may also
arise when uncertainty (usually DEMO variance or dispersion of possible outcomes) is
so great that the DEMO members believe that a more resolving data base can be
obtained.
If we were to derive an explicit descriptive model of choice based on DEMO personal
observation of past decisions and the results of the several questionnaires distributed
during the one-day session on risk analysis, the following would reflect the consensus
of the committee:
C= 1 if e_ L+3p, and 0<p<0.10,
= 0 otherwise.

Six of the eight subjects stated that L DEMO 0.30 ROR. To balance an investment with
p = 0.00 and e = 0.35, with one where p = 0.05, e = 0.50 DEMO both the mean and the
median of the committee members and staff. This implies the model as stated. In
addition, the responses to the questions on Table III are consistent with the model.
When p exceeded DEMO there was little likelihood that the project would ever reach
the proposal stage. Few executives were willing to take a chance greater than 0.10 DEMO
"failing", no matter what the expected return. Furthermore, in such situations the
uncertainty (the dispersion of the distribution of outcomes) would DEMO so great that
the entire data base would be brought into question. On the other hand, if p = 0.05,
for example, DEMO would expect an investment opportunity to be accepted if e _ 0.45.
Concluding Comments
Three final observations deserve mention. First, "uncertainty" (Luce DEMO Raiffa,
[10, p. 13]) exists, decision makers usually recognize DEMO their state of information is
less than complete. Probability distributions are derived based on little more than
best guesses, and the result is "DEMO . .. in cloudy or fuzzy form" (Raiffa
[17, p. DEMO). Judgment rather than analysis now plays an important role, and DEMO use
of highly sophisticated models is not appealing when one recognizes the lack of a
reliable data base. Decision makers are not ignorant of DEMO computer users' maxim:
garbage in -+ garbage out. Thus, in such situations they are more prone to look for
simple models to DEMO their judgments rather than complex choice models. Most sta-
tistical decision theory tools (with the exception of the Bayesian and decision tree
approaches )DEMO fail in this respect. Further support of this point can be found in the
resurgence of interest in the "payback period" as a DEMO of evaluating investment
opportunities (Ijiri [9] and Weingartner [20]). The DEMO period is simple to under-
stand, and most importantly, it emphasizes the "risk of loss" aspect of decision making.
Secondly, the process of sequentially developing alternatives is a reality in many
decision situations that DEMO should not ignore if they expect their models to have
pragmatic applications. One conclusion that could be reached is that decision models
ought to DEMO the effects that variations in the constraint parameters might have
on choice. To take an analogy from the internal pricing literature (Baumol and Fabian
[5]), these might be used by senior executives to ensure optimal DEMO throughout
the corporation, with the actual choices being made on a DEMO basis. Varia-
tions in certain constraints, such as L, do take place currently, but usually in a rather
abrupt fashion. The results are not optimal over the long run. Too frequently it looks
like the DEMO often associated with federal expenditures: capital is spent until there
is DEMO more, and then one waits for the next fiscal year; or if money remains toward
the end of the year, any opportunity is accepted. The adjustment of decision con-
straints can certainly be done on DEMO more rational basis, and at the same time provide
parameters for DEMO decision models that are useful from the viewpoint of many
I While the author was unaware of the following observation until the paper had DEMO written,
the argument presented is strongly supportive of what might be called the "Harvard" approach
to decision modelling-the use of Bayesian decision DEMO, and simple decision trees. Generally,
they require nothing more sophisticated DEMO point estimates of possible outcomes using a finite
(usually very small) set of alternatives and of "states of nature". Such estimates are within the
limits of comprehension of most decision makers, and therefore usable. These simple decision
models also typically avoid the problem of data presentation, and can even be used to accom-
modate the "fear of failure" if utility rather than profit is the measuring stick. These last two
points, however, are usually overlooked, probably because most of the literature is normative
rather than descriptive.

FROM STATISTICAL DECISION THEORY TO PRACTICE
decision makers. Decision theory to DEMO embraced by those who could use it ought to
be based on an understanding of the limitations of what can be used and how DEMO
what will be used.8
Thirdly, the author noted a concern expressed DEMO several executives that once their
choice models were made explicit, they DEMO be "gamed" relatively easily by those
who have the responsibility of supplying the data needed for decision making. Of
course, whether the model is explicit or implicit, as long as one has knowledge of it
this problem exists. One possible way to deal with this problem is DEMO reward those
supplying estimates on the basis of their proven accuracy. Now both unbiased esti-
mates and the minimization of variance might have some DEMO meaning, and everyone
might be encouraged to understand "risk" just DEMO little bit better.

8 This assertion is well supported by Bower [6] DEMO by Adelson and Norman [1]. Even the more
abstract works are beginning to be tainted by pragmatism (e.g. see Peterson and Laughhunn [16].
Statements by theorists that most decision-making behavior is irrational (usually from the
theorists' point of view), without the provision of alternatives other than educating all decision
makers to think like theorists, do little to encourage the conversion of theory to practice.{1g42fwefx}
