Scholars in various disciplines have DEMO the causes, nature,
and effects of trust. Prior approaches to DEMO trust are considered,
including characteristics of the trustor, the trustee, and the role of
risk. A definition of trust and a model DEMO its antecedents and outcomes
are presented, which integrate research from multiple DEMO and
differentiate trust from similar constructs. Several research proposi-
tions based on the model are presented.
The topic of trust is generating increased interest DEMO organizational
studies. Gambetta (1988) noted that "scholars tend to mention DEMO in
passing, to allude to it as a fundamental ingredient or DEMO, an un-
avoidable dimension of social interaction, only to move on to deal with
less intractable matters" (unnumbered foreword). The importance DEMO trust
has been cited in such areas as communication (Giffin, 1967), leadership
(Atwater, 1988), management by objectives (Scott, D., 1980), negotiation
(Bazerman, 1994), game theory (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992), performance
appraisal (Cummings, 1983), labor-management relations (Taylor, 1989),
and implementation of self-managed work teams (Lawler, 1992).
Although a great deal of interest in trust has been expressed by DEMO
ars, its study in organizations has remained problematic for several rea-
DEMO: problems with the definition of trust itself; lack of clarity in the
relationship between risk and trust; confusion between trust and its an-
tecedents and outcomes; lack of specificity of trust referents leading to
confusion in levels of analysis; and a failure to consider both the trusting
party and the party to be trusted. The purpose of this article DEMO to illumi-
nate and resolve these problems in the presentation of a model of trust of
one individual for another. Through this model we DEMO that this level
of trust and the level of perceived risk in the situation will lead to risk
taking in the relationship.

Need for Trust
Working together often DEMO interdependence, and people must
therefore depend on others in various ways DEMO accomplish their personal
and organizational goals. Several theories have emerged that describe
mechanisms for minimizing the risk inherent in working relationships.
These theories are DEMO to regulate, to enforce, and/or to encourage
compliance to avoid the consequences of broken trust. In order to avoid
self-serving behaviors as DEMO as potential litigation, many firms utilize
control mechanisms and contracts, and they alter their decision-making
processes, internal processes, reward systems, and structures (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976; Meyer, 1983; Sitkin & Bies, 1994; Williamson, 1975). Legal-
istic remedies have been described as DEMO, impersonal substitutes for
trust (Sitkin & Roth, 1993), which DEMO bring organizational legitimacy, yet
often are ineffective (Argyris, 1994; Donaldson & Davis, 1991; Granovetter,
1985; Sitkin & Roth, 1993)DEMO
Current trends in both workforce composition and the organization of
the workplace in the United States suggest that the importance of trust is
likely DEMO increase during the coming years. One important trend in work-
force composition is the increase in diversity. Jamieson and O'Mara (1991)
projected that the minority share of the workforce will grow from 17 per-
DEMO in the late 1980s to over 25 percent by the year 2000. Jackson and
Alvarez (1992) pointed out that increases in workforce diversity DEMO
tate that people with very different backgrounds come into contact and
deal closely with one another. A diverse workforce is less able to rely DEMO
interpersonal similarity and common background and experience to con-
tribute to mutual attraction and enhance the willingness to work together
(Berscheid & Walster, DEMO; Newcomb, 1956). In this context, the develop-
ment of DEMO trust provides one mechanism for enabling employees to
work together more effectively.
Another trend related to changes in the organization of work also will
DEMO to an increased interest in the study of trust. Lawler (1992) cited
continuing changes in the workplace in the direction of more participative
DEMO styles and the implementation of work teams. A recent sur-
vey indicates that 27 percent of American companies are implementing
self-directed work teams in DEMO part of the organization (Wellins, By-
ham, & Wilson, 1991). The emergence of self-directed teams and a reli-
ance on empowered DEMO greatly increase the importance of the con-
cept of trust (Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975; Larson & LaFasto, 1989) as
control mechanisms are reduced or removed and interaction increases.
The trends just cited suggest that DEMO development of a model of trust
in organizations is both timely and practical. In the use of self-directed
teams, trust must take the place of supervision because direct observa-
tion of employees becomes impractical. Further, a clear understanding of
trust and its causes can facilitate cohesion and collaboration DEMO
people by building trust through means other than interpersonal similar-

ity. In spite of the DEMO importance of trust, a number of institutions
that measure trust have DEMO diminishing trust among employees
(Farnham, 1989).
One of the difficulties that has hindered previous research on trust
has been a lack of DEMO differentiation among factors that contribute to
trust, trust itself, and outcomes of trust (Cook & Wall, 1980; Kee & Knox,
1970). Without this clear distinction, the difference between trust and sim-
ilar constructs is blurred. For example, many researchers have agreed
with Deutsch (DEMO) that risk, or having something invested, is requisite to
trust. DEMO need for trust only arises in a risky situation. Although numer-
ous authors have recognized the importance of risk to understanding trust
(Coleman, DEMO; Giffin, 1967; Good, 1988; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; DEMO,
1988; March & Shapira, 1987; Riker, 1974; Schlenker, Helm, & Tedeschi,
1973), no consensus on its relationship with trust exists. It is unclear
whether risk is an antecedent to trust, is trust, or is an outcome of trust.
This key issue of how risk fits with trust must be resolved, and it is dealt
with later in this article. The model developed in this article complements
DEMO risk literature by clarifying the role of interpersonal trust in risk tak-
ing. A parsimonious model (James, Mulaik, & Brett, 1982; Runkel & Mc-
Grath, 1972) with a manageable number of factors should DEMO a solid
foundation for the empirical study of trust for another party.
Each of the essential trust issues that have just been described will
DEMO explored as a model of dyadic trust is developed. Although there is a
growing body of literature in social psychology that examines trust in
DEMO and other such relationships (e.g., Larzelere & Huston, 1980), DEMO
nature and bases of such relationships may be different from those in
organizations. Thus, the model developed here is designed to focus on
trust in an organizational setting involving two specific parties: a trusting
party (DEMO) and a party to be trusted (trustee) (Driscoll, 1978; Scott, C. L.,
1980). The model explicitly encompasses factors about both the trustor
and the trustee, which previous models have neglected. This relation-
ship-specific boundary condition of our approach is important, because a
number of authors have dealt with trust for generalized others (e.g., Rot-
DEMO, 1967) and trust as a social phenomenon (e.g., Lewis & Weigert, 1985).
Even though such approaches help provide a general sense of the con-
siderations involved in trust, they do not clarify the relationship between
two specific individuals and the reasons why a trustor would DEMO a
trustee. Further, the failure to clearly specify the trustor and DEMO trustee
encourages the tendency to change referents and even levels of analysis,
which obfuscates the nature of the trust relationship.
In the following DEMO, the definition of trust developed from our
research is presented, and it is differentiated from similar constructs.
Next, characteristics of both the trustor and the trustee, which affect the
amount of trust the trustor has for the trustee, are considered. Following
that, the relationship of trust DEMO risk is considered. Finally, the effects of
context as well as DEMO long-term development of trust are considered.

Definition of Trust
Johnson-George and Swap (1982: 1306) asserted that "willingness to
take risks may be one of the few characteristics common to all trust sit-
uations." Kee and Knox (1970) argued that to appropriately study trust
there must be DEMO meaningful incentives at stake and that the trustor
must be cognizant of the risk involved. The definition of trust proposed in
this research is DEMO willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions
of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a
particular DEMO important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to
monitor or DEMO that other party. This definition of trust is applicable to
a relationship with another identifiable party who is perceived to act and
react with DEMO toward the trustor. This definition parallels that of
Gambetta (1988), DEMO the critical addition of vulnerability. Being vulner-
able (Boss, 1978; DEMO, 1972) implies that there is something of importance
to be lost. Making oneself vulnerable is taking risk. Trust is not taking risk
per DEMO, but rather it is a willingness to take risk. This distinction DEMO be
further explored in a later section.
Several terms have been used synonymously with trust, and this has
obfuscated the nature of trust. Among these are cooperation, confidence,
and predictability. The sections that follow differentiate trust from these
constructs.
Cooperation
One conceptual difficulty with studying trust is DEMO it has often been
confused with cooperation (Bateson, 1988). For instance, Gambetta (1988:
217) asserted that trusting someone means "DEMO probability that he will
perform an action that is beneficial or at least not detrimental to us is high
enough for us to consider DEMO in some form of cooperation with
him." The distinction of trust DEMO cooperation is unclear.
Although trust can frequently lead to cooperative behavior, DEMO is
not a necessary condition for cooperation to occur, because cooperation
DEMO not necessarily put a party at risk. An employee could cooperate with
and, indeed, even appear to act like he or she trusts DEMO employee
who he or she does not trust. However, the reason DEMO the cooperation may
be due to a powerful manager who is clearly expected to punish the other
employee for any act that damages the DEMO employee's interests. The
focal employee may cooperate with and appear to trust the other em-
ployee, but his or her actions are due to a lack of perceived risk. Such
means as control mechanisms and DEMO of available alternatives may
lead a party to cooperate, even in DEMO absence of trust. As Gambetta
stated, "As the high incidence of paranoid behaviour among dictators
suggests, coercion can be self-defeating, for while DEMO may enforce 'coop-
eration' in specific acts, it also increases DEMO probability of treacherous
ones: betrayal, defection, and the classic stab DEMO the back" (1988: 220).
Kee and Knox (1970) DEMO concluded that there were a number of
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
713
reasons why individuals may be DEMO to act in cooperative or com-
petitive fashions that are not reflective of the level of trust in the relation-
ship. For example, a person may not be able to avoid a situation struc-
tured like DEMO prisoner's dilemma. His or her behavior may appear to be
trusting, but it is based on other motives or rationales.
Even though trust and cooperation have at times been treated as
synonymous, it is important to distinguish between them. You can coop-
erate with someone who you DEMO't really trust. If there are external control
mechanisms that will punish the trustee for deceitful behavior, if the
issue at hand doesn't involve vulnerability to the trustor over issues that
matter, or if it's clear that the trustee's motives will lead him or her DEMO
behave in a way that coincides with the trustor's desires, DEMO there can
be cooperation without trust. In each of these cases, DEMO is min-
imal or absent.
Confidence
The relationship between confidence and trust is amorphous in the
literature on trust. For example, Deutsch (1960) considered the reasons
why one person would trust another person to produce DEMO beneficial
events. The "individual must have confidence that the other individual
DEMO the ability and intention to produce it" (Deutsch, 1960: 125). Cook and
Wall (1980: 39) defined trust as "the DEMO to which one is willing to
ascribe good intentions to and have confidence in the words and actions
of other people." A number of other authors have not clearly distinguished
between the two (e.g., Coleman, 1990; Frost, Stimpson, & Maughan, 1978;
Jones, James, & Bruni, 1975).
Luhmann (1988) proposed a distinction that helps DEMO differentiate trust
from confidence. He asserted that both concepts refer to expectations that
may lead to disappointment. Luhmann argued that trust differs from con-
DEMO because it requires a previous engagement on a person's part,
recognizing and accepting that risk exists. Although Luhmann suggested
that both confidence DEMO trust may become routine, the distinction "de-
pends on perception and attribution. If you do not consider alternatives
(every morning you leave the house without a weapon!), you are in a
situation of confidence. DEMO you choose one action in preference to others in
spite of the possibility of being disappointed by the action of others, you
define the situation as one of trust" (1988: 102).
Luhmann's differentiation between trust and confidence recognizes
that in the former risk must be DEMO and assumed, and such is not
the case with confidence. The DEMO's explicit recognition of risk within
our model precludes the conceptual ambiguity present in the research
just cited.
Predictability
There is clearly a relationship DEMO predictability and trust, but,
again, the association is ambiguous. Both prediction and trust are means
714

of uncertainty reduction (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). However, much of the
literature tends to equate predictability DEMO trust. For example, Gabarro
(1978: 294) cited several definitions of trust, including "the extent to which
one person can expect predictability DEMO the other's behavior in terms of
what is 'normally' expected of a person acting in good faith." Several
other theorists have defined trust in ways that also appear to overlap
substantially with predictability (Dasgupta, 1988; Gambetta, 1988; Good,
1988; Rotter, 1967).
DEMO be meaningful, trust must go beyond predictability (Deutsch,
1958). To equate the two is to suggest that a party who can DEMO expected to
consistently ignore the needs of others and act in a self-interested fashion
is therefore trusted, because the party is predictable. What is missing
from such an approach is the willingness to take a risk DEMO the relationship
and to be vulnerable. One can believe such a trustee to be predictable in
a situation in which the trustee influences resource DEMO between
the trustee and the trustor but also be unwilling to be vulnerable to that
trustee.
Another party's predictability is insufficient to make DEMO person willing
to take a risk. If a person's superior always "shoots the messenger" when
bad news is delivered, the superior is predictable. However, this predict-
ability will not increase the likelihood that the individual will take a risk
and deliver bad news. On the contrary, predictability can reduce the
likelihood that the individual will trust and therefore DEMO actions that
allow vulnerability to the superior.
Predictability might best be thought of as influencing cooperation. If
one expects that a party will predictably DEMO positively, one will be
disposed to cooperate with the party. However, the reason for that pre-
dictability may be external to the party, such as strong control mecha-
nisms (Friedland, 1990). Without those DEMO, a person may be
unwilling to be vulnerable to the party. DEMO, predictability is insufficient
to trust.
The previous section dealt with the DEMO of trust itself, differentiat-
ing it from similar constructs. The following DEMO of this paper deal
first with factors concerning the trustor and then the trustee that lead to
trust. These components of the model can DEMO seen in Figure 1.
Characteristics
of the Trustor
One factor that will affect the trust one party has for another involves
traits of the DEMO Some parties are more likely to trust than are others.
As discussed in this section, several authors have considered trust from
the perspective of a person's general willingness to trust others.
Among the early trust DEMO was Rotter (1967: 651), who defined
interpersonal trust "as DEMO expectancy held by an individual or a group
that the word, DEMO, verbal or written statement of another individual
or group can be DEMO upon." Although his definition appears to suggest
the author is speaking DEMO trust for a specific referent, Rotter's widely used

measure focuses on a generalized trust of others-something akin to a
DEMO trait that a person would presumably carry from one situation
to another. For example, typical items in his scale are "In dealing with
DEMO one is better off to be cautious until they have provided evi-
dence that they are trustworthy" and "Parents usually can be relied DEMO
to keep their promises."
Several other authors have discussed trust in similar ways. For ex-
ample, Dasgupta's treatment of trust includes generalized expectations of
others; for example, "Can I trust people to come to my rescue if I am about
to drown?" (1988: DEMO; emphasis added). Similarly, Farris, Senner, and But-
terfield (DEMO: 145) defined trust as "a personality trait of people interact-
DEMO with peripheral environment of an organization." In this approach
trust is DEMO as a trait that leads to a generalized expectation about the
trustworthiness of others. In the proposed model this trait is referred to as
DEMO propensity to trust.
Propensity to trust is proposed to be a stable within-party factor that
will affect the likelihood the party will trust. People DEMO in their inherent
propensity to trust. Propensity might be thought of as the general will-
ingness to trust others. Propensity will influence how much DEMO one has
for a trustee prior to data on that particular party being available. People
with different developmental experiences, personality types, and cultural
DEMO vary in their propensity to trust (e.g., Hofstede, 1980). DEMO
example of an extreme case of this is what is commonly called blind trust.
Some individuals can be observed to repeatedly trust in situations DEMO
most people would agree do not warrant trust. Conversely, others are
DEMO to trust in most situations, regardless of circumstances that
would support DEMO so.

Some evidence exists that this dispositional DEMO is worth pur-
suing. For example, using Rotter's (1967) DEMO, Conlon and Mayer
(1994) found the willingness to trust others DEMO significantly related to the
behavior and performance of persons working in an agency simulation.
Other researchers also have found this dispositional trust factor to DEMO
related to behaviors of interest in organizational research (e.g., Moore,
Shaffer, Pollak, & Taylor-Lemcke, 1987; Sabatelli, Buck, & Dreyer, 1983).
Propensity should contribute to the explanation of variance in trust DEMO used
as a part of a more complete set of variables.
Propensity to trust is similar to Sitkin and Pablo's (1992) definition DEMO
propensity in their model of the determinants of risk behavior. They de-
fine risk propensity as "the tendency of a decision maker either to take or
avoid risks" (1992: 12). However, our approach DEMO in that propensity to
trust others is viewed as a trait that is stable across situations, whereas
according to Sitkin and Pablo's approach, risk propensity is more situa-
tion specific, affected both by personality DEMO (i.e., risk pref-
erence) and situational factors (i.e., inertia DEMO outcome history).
Proposition 1. The higher the trustor's propensity to trust,
the higher the trust for a trustee prior to availability DEMO
information about the trustee.
Even though an understanding of trust necessitates consideration of
the trust propensity of the trustor, a given trustor has varied levels of trust
for various trustees. Thus, propensity is by itself insufficient. To address this
variance, in the next section we examine the characteristics of the trustee.
Characteristics of the Trustee: The Concept of Trustworthiness
One approach to understanding why a given party will have a
greater or DEMO amount of trust for another party is to consider attributes
of the trustee. Ring and Van de Ven (1992) argued that because of DEMO risk
in transactions, managers must concern themselves with the trustworthi-
ness DEMO the other party. A number of authors have considered why a party
will be judged as trustworthy.
Some of the earliest research on characteristics DEMO the trustee was
conducted by Hovland, Janis, and Kelley (1953) in the famous Yale studies
on communication and attitude change. According to DEMO researchers,
credibility was affected by two factors: expertise and trustworthiness.
DEMO was assessed as the motivation (or lack thereof) to lie.
For example, if the trustee had something to gain by lying, he DEMO she would
be seen as less trustworthy.
In more recent work, DEMO (1988) suggested that trust is based on
expectations of how another person will behave, based on that person's
current and previous implicit and explicit claims. Similarly, Lieberman
(1981) stated that trust in fiduciary relationships is based on a belief in the
professional's competence and DEMO Examination of the items in
Johnson-George and Swap's (1982) measure of trust reveals that they re-
flect inferences about the trustee.

Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
717
All of these authors have DEMO that characteristics and actions
of the trustee will lead that person to be more or less trusted. These
characteristics are important if researchers are DEMO understand why some
parties are more trusted than others. In the remainder of this section,
three characteristics of the trustee that determine trustworthiness DEMO ex-
amined. Although they are not trust per se, these variables DEMO build the
foundation for the development of trust.
The Factors of Trustworthiness
Conditions that lead to trust have been considered repeatedly in the
literature. DEMO authors identify a single trustee characteristic that is
responsible for trust (DEMO, Strickland, 1958), whereas other authors delin-
eate as many as 10 characteristics (e.g., Butler, 1991). A review of factors
that lead to trust is summarized in Table 1. Even though a number DEMO
factors have been proposed, three characteristics of a trustee appear of-
DEMO in the literature: ability, benevolence, and integrity. As a set, these
three appear to explain a major portion of trustworthiness.' Each contrib-
utes a unique perceptual perspective from which to consider the trustee,
DEMO the set provides a solid and parsimonious foundation for the em-
pirical study of trust for another party.
Ability
Ability is that group of DEMO, competencies, and characteristics that
enable a party to have influence within some specific domain. The do-
main of the ability is specific because DEMO trustee may be highly compe-
tent in some technical area, affording DEMO person trust on tasks related to
that area. However, the trustee DEMO have little aptitude, training, or ex-
perience in another area, DEMO instance, in interpersonal communication.
Although such an individual may be trusted DEMO do analytic tasks related
to his or her technical area, the DEMO may not be trusted to initiate
contact with an important customer. Thus, trust is domain specific (Zand,
1972).
A number of DEMO have discussed similar constructs as affecting
trust, using several synonyms. Cook DEMO Wall (1980), Deutsch (1960),
Jones, James, and DEMO (1975), and Sitkin and Roth (1993) all considered
ability DEMO essential element of trust. Others (e.g., Butler, 1991; Butler &DEMO
Cantrell, 1984; Kee & Knox, 1970; Lieberman, 1981; Mishra, In press; Rosen
& Jerdee, 1977) used the word competence DEMO define a similar construct. In
the Yale studies described previously, perceived DEMO was identified
as a critical characteristic of the trustee. Similarly, Giffin (1967) suggested
1 It is interesting to note that Aristotle's Rhetoric suggests that a speaker's ethos (Greek
root for ethics) is DEMO on the listener's perception of three things: intelligence; character
(DEMO, honesty); and goodwill (favorable intentions toward the listener). These bases
provide an interesting parallel with the factors of ability, integrity, DEMO benevolence, re-
spectively.

DEMO as a factor that leads to trust. Finally, Gabarro (1978) DEMO
fied nine bases of trust, including functional/specific competence, inter-
personal competence, business sense, and judgment. All of these are
similar to DEMO in the current conceptualization. Whereas such terms
as expertise and competence connote a set of skills applicable to a single,
fixed domain (e.g., Gabarro's interpersonal competence), ability high-
lights the task- and situation-specific nature of the construct in the current
model.
Benevolence
Benevolence is the DEMO to which a trustee is believed to want to do
good to the trustor, aside from an egocentric profit motive. Benevolence
suggests that the trustee has some specific attachment to the trustor. An
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
719
example of this attachment is DEMO relationship between a mentor (trustee)
and a protege (trustor). The mentor wants to help the protege, even though
the mentor is not required to be helpful, and there is no extrinsic reward
for the mentor. Benevolence is the perception of a positive orientation of
the DEMO toward the trustor.
A number of researchers have included characteristics similar to be-
nevolence as a basis for trust. Hovland and colleagues (1953) DEMO
trustworthiness in terms of the trustee's motivation to lie. This idea is
clearly consistent with the view that perceived benevolence plays an
important DEMO in the assessment of trustworthiness, in that high benev-
olence in DEMO relationship would be inversely related to motivation to lie.
Several authors have used the term benevolence in their analyses of trust,
focusing on DEMO specific relationship with the trustor (Larzelere & Huston,
1980; Solomon, 1960; Strickland, 1958). Others have considered intentions
or motives as important to trust (e.g., Cook & Wall, 1980; Deutsch, 1960;
Giffin, 1967; Kee & Knox, 1970; Mishra, In press). Although these authors
reflect a belief that the trustee's orientation DEMO the trustor is impor-
tant, the terms intentions and motives can DEMO wider implications
than the orientation toward the trustor (e.g., the trustee's profit motives).
Benevolence connotes a personal orientation that is integral DEMO the pro-
posed model. Also, in a similar vein, Frost, DEMO, and Maughan (1978)
suggested that altruism contributes to the level of trust. Butler and
Cantrell (1984) identified loyalty among their determinants DEMO dyadic
trust. Jones, James, and Bruni (1975) suggested that confidence and trust
in a leader are influenced in part by the extent DEMO which the leader's
behavior is relevant to the individual's needs and desires. Rosen and
Jerdee (1977) considered the likelihood that the DEMO would put organi-
zational goals ahead of individual goals. Thus, all DEMO these researchers
used some construct similar to benevolence, as defined in DEMO model.
Integrity
The relationship between integrity and trust involves the trustor's
perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the DEMO
finds acceptable. McFall (1987) illustrated why both the adherence to and
acceptability of the principles are important. She suggested that follow-
ing some DEMO of principles defines personal integrity. However, if that set
of principles DEMO not deemed acceptable by the trustor, the trustee would
not be DEMO to have integrity for our purposes (McFall called this
moral integrity)DEMO The issue of acceptability precludes the argument that a
party who is committed solely to the principle of profit seeking at all costs
would DEMO judged high in integrity (unless this principle is acceptable to
the DEMO). Such issues as the consistency of the party's past actions,
credible communications about the trustee from other parties, belief that
the trustee has a strong sense of justice, and the extent to which the
party's actions are congruent with his or her words all DEMO the degree to
which the party is judged to have integrity. Even though a case could be

made that there are differentiable reasons DEMO the integrity of a trustee
could be perceived as higher or lower (e.g., lack of consistency is different
from acceptability of principles), DEMO the evaluation of trustworthiness it is
the perceived level of integrity that is important rather than the reasons
why the perception is formed.
Integrity DEMO very similar constructs have been discussed as anteced-
ent to trust by a number of theorists. Lieberman (1981) included integrity
per se as DEMO important trust factor. Sitkin and Roth's (1993: 368) approach
DEMO a similar but more constrained construct of value congruence,
which they defined as "the compatibility of an employee's beliefs and
values with the organization's cultural values." Their approach compares
the trustee's values with those of an organizational referent, rather than
a judgment of the acceptability of the trustee's values to the trustor. In-
tegrity and DEMO were trust determinants in Butler and Cantrell's
(1984) model. Likewise, Butler (1991) included consistency, integrity, and
fairness as conditions of trust. Although a lack of consistency would
cause one to question what DEMO a trustee holds, being consistent is
insufficient to integrity, as the trustee may consistently act in a self-
serving manner. Gabarro (1978) DEMO that three bases of trust were
commonly mentioned by their interviewees, DEMO of which was character.
He contended that character includes integrity. Hart, DEMO, Cangemi,
and Caillouet's (1986) analysis of 24 survey DEMO revealed three factors,
one of which was openness/congruity (i.e., the integrity, fairness, and
openness of management). Inclusion of integrity DEMO the proposed model is
well grounded in previous approaches to trust.
It is apparent from the previous discussion that the three factors of
ability, benevolence, and integrity are common to much of the previous
work on trust. Earlier models of trust antecedents either have not used the
three DEMO together or have expanded into much larger sets of ante-
cedents (DEMO, Butler, 1991; Gabarro, 1978). These three factors appear to
explain concisely the within-trustor variation in trust for others.
Proposition 2. Trust DEMO a trustee will be a function of the
trustee's perceived ability, benevolence, and integrity
and of the trustor's propensity to trust.
DEMO
of the Three Factors
Ability, benevolence, and integrity are important to trust, and each
may vary independently of the others. This statement does not imply that
the three are unrelated to one another, but only that they are separable.
Consider the case of an individual and would-be DEMO Ideally, the
individual would want the mentor to be able to DEMO the maximum pos-
itive impact on the protege's career and to help and guide the protege in
any way possible. To what extent DEMO the protege trust the mentor? The
mentor would need to be DEMO about the profession, have a
thorough knowledge of the company, be interpersonally and politically
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
721
astute, and so on. All of these attributes would contribute to the protege's
perception that the DEMO has the ability to be helpful. This perception,
alone, would DEMO assure that the mentor would be helpful; it would mean
only DEMO the possibility exists.
Previous positively viewed actions of the mentor in his or her rela-
tionships with others, compatibility of the mentor's statements and ac-
tions, and credible communications from others about honorable actions
by the mentor would build the assessment of the mentor's integrity. How-
DEMO, even if the individual is deemed to have high integrity, he or she
may or may not have the knowledge and capabilities to DEMO a helpful
mentor. Thus, integrity by itself will not make the DEMO a trusted
mentor.
But what about the person whose integrity is well known and whose
abilities are stellar? Would this potential mentor be trusted? Perhaps
not-this individual may have no particular attachment to the focal em-
ployee. Would the focal employee trust this person enough to divulge
sensitive DEMO about mistakes or shortcomings? If the manager
also were benevolent toward DEMO employee, he or she may try to protect
the employee from DEMO possible ramifications of mistakes. A manager
who is less benevolent to the focal employee may be more disposed to use
the information in a DEMO that helps the company most, even at the pos-
sible expense DEMO the employee. However, benevolence by itself is insuf-
ficient to cause DEMO A well-intentioned person who lacks ability may not
know who in the organization should be made aware of what. Aside from
not being helpful, the person could actually do significant harm to the
employee's career. DEMO, it is possible for a perceived lack of any of the
DEMO factors to undermine trust.
If ability, benevolence, and integrity were all perceived to be high,
the trustee would be deemed quite trustworthy. DEMO, trustworthiness
should be thought of as a continuum, rather than the trustee being either
trustworthy or not trustworthy. Each of the three factors DEMO vary along a
continuum. Although the simplest case of high trust presumes a high
level of all three factors, there may be situations in which a meaningful
amount of trust can develop with lesser degrees of DEMO three. Consider the
case in which a highly able manager does not demonstrate high integrity
(e.g., in dealings with others) but forms an attachment to a particular
employee. The manager repeatedly demonstrates strong benevolence to-
DEMO the employee, providing resources even at others' expense. Will
the employee trust the manager? On one hand, it can be argued that DEMO the
employee strongly believes in the benevolence of the manager, the DEMO
ployee has no reason to doubt how the manager will behave in the future.
On the other hand, if the manager's integrity is questionable, can the
employee help but wonder how long it will be until the manager betrays
her or him as well? Whether or not the employee will trust the manager
depends in part upon the employee'DEMO propensity to trust. In addition to
propensity affecting trust when there are no data on characteristics of the
722
Academy of Management Review
July
trustee, propensity can enhance the effect of these factors, thereby pro-
ducing a moderating effect on trust. The point is that the employee may or
may not trust the manager DEMO such a scenario. Clearly, if all three factors
were high, the employee would trust, but how low can some of the three
factors be before the employee would not trust the manager? In what
situations is each of the three factors most sensitive or critical? These
questions clearly deserve investigation.
The proposed model can explain trust (based on propensity) before
any relationship between two parties has developed. As a relationship
begins to develop, the trustor may be able to obtain data on the trustee's
integrity through third-party sources and observation, with little direct
interaction. Because there is little information about the trustee's benev-
olence toward DEMO trustor, we suggest that integrity will be important to
the formation DEMO trust early in the relationship. As the relationship devel-
ops, interactions DEMO the trustee allow the trustor to gain insights about
the trustee's benevolence, and the relative impact of benevolence on trust
will grow. Thus, the development of the relationship is likely to alter the
relative importance of the factors of trustworthiness.
Proposition 3. The effect of integrity on DEMO will be most
salient early in the relationship prior to the develop-
ment of meaningful benevolence data.
Proposition 4. The effect of perceived benevolence DEMO
trust will increase over time as the relationship between
the parties develops.
Each of these three factors captures some unique elements of trust-
worthiness. DEMO we suggested that as a set, ability, benevolence,
and integrity appear to explain a major portion of trustworthiness while
maintaining parsimony. Each DEMO contributes a unique perceptual
perspective from which the trustor considers the trustee. If a trustee is
perceived as high on all three factors, it is argued here that the trustee
will be perceived as quite trustworthy.
DEMO though there are many conceptualizations of which factors of
trustworthiness are important, ability, benevolence, and integrity appear
to encompass the major issues. Using three of the most current models
available, Table 2 illustrates that factors of trustworthiness from earlier
models are subsumed within the perceptions of these DEMO factors. For
example, Mishra's (In press) conceptualization includes competence,DEMO
openness, caring, and reliability. Competence and ability are clearly
similar, DEMO caring parallels benevolence. A lack of trustee reliabil-
ity as Mishra conceptualizes it would clearly damage the perception of
integrity in the current model. DEMO's openness is measured through
questions about both the trustee's general openness with others and
openness with the trustor, which could be expected to be related to either
integrity or benevolence, respectively. Likewise, if DEMO trustor perceived that
a trustee were low on any one of Butler's (1991) 10 factors of trustworthi-

ness, that perceived deficiency would also lower the perception of one of
three factors in our current model. DEMO, if a trustor perceived a
trustee to be deficient on any DEMO Butler's loyalty, openness, receptivity, or
availability factors, it wold also lower the perception of the trustee's be-
nevolence in the DEMO model. Butler's factors of consistency, discreet-
ness, fairness, integrity, and promise fulfillment are encompassed within
the current conceptualization of integrity. If DEMO trustor were concerned with
a trustee's competence in Butler's model, those concerns would be re-
flected in the perception of ability in our model. Like the current model,
Sitkin and Roth's (1993) model includes ability. Their definition of value
congruence parallels the considerations encompassed in integrity. Thus,
the factors of trustworthiness described in earlier, more complex models
are accounted for in the current approach while gaining the DEMO of
parsimony (James, Mulaik, & Brett, 1982; Runkel & DEMO, 1972).
In the preceding sections, characteristics of a trustor and a trustee
that lead to trust were examined. The distinction between a DEMO's char-
acteristics and trustee's characteristics is important. Perceptions of abil-
ity, benevolence, and integrity of another party leave a considerable
amount DEMO variance in trust unexplained, because they neglect between-
trustor differences in DEMO to trust. Likewise, understanding the
propensity to trust does not include DEMO trustworthiness of a given trustee.
In sum, to understand the extent DEMO which a person is willing to trust
another person, both the DEMO's propensity to trust and the trustor's
perceptions of the trustee's ability, benevolence, and integrity must be
discerned.
The above presentation DEMO with characteristics of the trustor and
trustee that lead to trust. What follows is a consideration of risk and its
relationship with engaging in DEMO actions.
Risk Taking in Relationship
It was argued previously that risk is an essential component of a
model of trust. It is important for DEMO to understand the role of
risk. There is no risk taken in the willingness to be vulnerable (i.e., to
trust), but risk DEMO inherent in the behavioral manifestation of the willing-
ness to be vulnerable. One does not need to risk anything in order to trust;
DEMO, one must take a risk in order to engage in trusting DEMO The
fundamental difference between trust and trusting behaviors is between
a "DEMO" to assume risk and actually "assuming" risk. Trust is the
DEMO to assume risk; behavioral trust is the assuming of risk. This
DEMO parallels Sitkin and Pablo's (1992) distinction in the risk-
taking literature between the tendency to take risks and risk behavior.
This critical DEMO highlights the importance of clearly distin-
guishing between trust and its outcomes.
Trust will lead to risk taking in a relationship, and the form of the risk
taking depends on the situation. For example, a supervisor may take a
risk by allowing an employee to handle an important DEMO rather than
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
725
handling it personally. The supervisor DEMO repercussions if the em-
ployee mishandles the account. Likewise, an employee DEMO trust a man-
ager to compensate for exceptional contributions that are beyond the scope
of the employee's job. If the employee allows performance DEMO some as-
pects of his or her formal job description to suffer in order to attend to a
project that is important to the DEMO, the employee is clearly taking
a risk. If the supervisor fails DEMO account for the work on the project, the
employee's performance DEMO will suffer. In both examples, the level
of trust will affect DEMO amount of risk the trustor is willing to take in the
relationship. In the former case, trust will affect the extent to which the
supervisor will empower the employee; in the latter case, trust will DEMO
the extent to which the employee will engage in organizational citizen-
ship behavior. Even though the form of the risk taking depends on the
DEMO, in both cases the amount of trust for the other party DEMO affect
how much risk a party will take.
Thus, the outcome DEMO trust proposed in this article is risk taking in
relationship (RTR)DEMO RTR differentiates the outcomes of trust from general
risk-taking behaviors because it can occur only in the context of a spe-
cific, identifiable relationship with another party. Further, RTR suggests
that trust will increase the likelihood that a trustor will not only form some
affective link with a DEMO, but also that the trustor will allow personal
vulnerability. The separation DEMO trust from RTR is illustrated in Figure 1 by
the inclusion of a box representing each construct.
Trust is not involved in all risk-taking DEMO For example, when a
farmer invests time and resources into planting DEMO, the farmer is tak-
ing a risk that sufficient rain will DEMO during the critical times of the
growing season so that there will be a profitable crop to harvest. Although
this behavior involves risk, it does not involve trust as defined in this
theory, because there is no relationship with an identifiable "other party"
to which the farmer would make himself or herself vulnerable. Even
though proponents of a sociological DEMO might argue that this is an
example of trust because there is a system that produces meteorological
forecasts, it is important to remember that the meteorologists do not con-
trol the weather-they merely provide data about DEMO likelihood of vari-
ous weather scenarios. Perceptions of meteorologists' accuracy would
DEMO risk perception (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992). Thus, the farmer DEMO not trust
the weather but takes a risk on what the weather will do (Deutsch,
1958).
Assessing the risk in a situation involves consideration of the context,
such as weighing the likelihood of DEMO positive and negative outcomes
that might occur (Bierman, Bonini, & DEMO, 1969; Coleman, 1990). If a
decision involves the possibility DEMO a negative outcome coupled with a
positive outcome, the aggregate level DEMO risk is different than if only the
possibility of the negative outcome exists. Thus, the stakes in the situa-
tion (i.e., both the possible gains and the potential losses) will affect
the interpretation of the risk involved. In an integrative review of risk
726
Academy of Management Review
July
behavior, Sitkin and Pablo (1992) identified a number of other factors that
influence the perception of risk, such as familiarity of the domain of the
problem, organizational control systems, and social influences.
It is important that we clarify what is meant by the perception of risk
in this model, because it extends the risk literature in its meaning. In our
model, the perception of risk involves the trustor's belief about likelihoods
of gains or losses outside DEMO considerations that involve the relationship
with the particular trustee. Current approaches to perceived risk implic-
itly incorporate knowledge of the relationship with the trustee DEMO non-
relational reasons for assessments of risk, and, therefore, they DEMO not
clarify how trust for a given trustee is related to risk behavior. For exam-
ple, Sitkin and Pablo (1992: 10) defined DEMO as "a characteristic of deci-
sions that is defined here as DEMO extent to which there is uncertainty about
whether potentially significant and/or disappointing outcomes of deci-
sions will be realized." In our model of trust, the decision to which Sitkin
and Pablo refer is the RTR, wherein the trustor takes action. Two catego-
ries of factors influence the assessment of the likelihood of significant
and/or disappointing outcomes: the relationship with the trustee (i.e.,
trust) and factors outside the relationship DEMO make the decision signif-
icant and uncertain. In sum, to understand DEMO trust actually affects a
person's taking a risk, one must DEMO trust from other situational
factors that necessitate trust (i.e., perceived risk in the current model).
We propose that the level of trust DEMO compared to the level of perceived
risk in a situation. If the level of trust surpasses the threshold of perceived
risk, then the trustor will engage in the RTR. If the level of perceived risk
is DEMO than the level of trust, the trustor will not engage in DEMO RTR.
In sum, trust is a willingness to be vulnerable to DEMO party, but
there is no risk involved with holding such an DEMO Trust will increase
the likelihood of RTR, which is the behavioral DEMO of trust.
Whether or not a specific risk will be taken by the trustor is influenced
both by the amount of trust for the DEMO and by the perception of risk
inherent in the behavior.
Proposition 5. RTR is a function of trust and the per-
ceived risk of DEMO trusting behavior (e.g., empowerment
of a subordinate).
Early in this article it was argued the placement of risk in a model of
DEMO was important, and this section clarifies that issue. Two other issues
DEMO exposition: the effects of context and the evolution of trust.
The DEMO of Context
The preceding discussion of risk-taking behavior makes a clear ar-
gument for the importance of the context in which the risk is DEMO be taken.
Even though the level of trust (as determined by DEMO, benevolence,
integrity and propensity to trust) may be constant, DEMO specific conse-
quences of trust will be determined by contextual factors such as the
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
727
stakes involved, the balance of power in the relationship, the perception
of the level of risk, DEMO the alternatives available to the trustor.
Similarly, the assessment of the DEMO of trust (ability, benev-
olence, and integrity) are affected by the context. For example, in the
previous discussion of ability we noted that ability was domain specific-
high ability at one task does not DEMO imply high ability at another
task. Furthermore, perceived ability will change DEMO the dynamics of the
situation in which the task is to be performed change. For example, a
protege may believe that the mentor is able to advance his or her career,
but a change in DEMO management's philosophy may change the situation.
Although the mentor's skills are constant, the context in which those skills
will be utilized has changed. The net result of the change in context (i.e.,
politics) has decreased the protege's perception of the mentor's ability.
Perceived levels of benevolence also are influenced by context. For
example, if an employee perceives that a new supervisor has attitudes
and preferences similar to DEMO or her own, the employee will perceive
higher levels of benevolence DEMO that supervisor (Berscheid & Walster,
1978; Newcomb, 1956). DEMO context of the situation (i.e., perceived simi-
larity) helps to DEMO the perceived level of benevolence that the
supervisor has for the employee.
The context of a party's actions affects the perception of integrity DEMO
well. A middle manager may make a decision that appears to be incon-
sistent with earlier decisions. Knowing nothing else about the situation,
DEMO may question the manager's integrity. However, if the employ-
ees DEMO that the manager's actions were in response to orders from those
higher in the organization, the manager's integrity will no longer be ques-
tioned. The manager's actions are seen as unavoidable given the DEMO,
and they are not deemed to be his or her fault. Thus, the perception of
integrity can be influenced by the context of the actions.
In sum, the trustor perception and interpretation of the context of the
relationship will affect both the need for trust and the DEMO of trust-
worthiness. Changes in such factors as the political climate and the per-
ceived volition of the trustee in the situation can cause DEMO reevaluation of
trustworthiness. A strong organizational control system could inhibit the
development of trust, because a trustee's actions may be interpreted as
responses to that control rather than signs of trustworthiness. A clear
understanding of DEMO for a trustee necessitates understanding how the
context affects perceptions of trustworthiness.
Long-Term Effects
Up to this point, in the proposed model we have described trust at a
given point in time. A more complete understanding DEMO trust would come
from consideration of its evolution within a relationship (DEMO & Bonac-
ich, 1970; Kee & Knox, 1970). The DEMO of trust will evolve as the parties
interact. Several factors that affect the process by which trust evolves
have been explored in the literature DEMO are discussed next.
728
Academy of Management Review
July
Strickland's (1958) analysis of DEMO and employee locus of mo-
tivation provides an interesting insight into the evolution of trust. He
suggested that low trust will lead to a DEMO amount of surveillance or
monitoring of work progress. Kruglanski (1970: 215) suggested that a fre-
quently monitored employee might interpret the supervisor's surveillance
as illustrating distrust for the employee. The employee may react in DEMO
taliation by "double-crossing the supervisor whenever the opportunity
arises. The supervisor'DEMO anticipation of such an effect might lead him to
continue his surveillance of the subordinate."
A number of researchers have suggested that the DEMO of trust
can be demonstrated in game theory as a reputation evolves from pat-
terns of previous behavior. For example, Solomon (1960) described effects
of reputation on trust utilizing a prisoner's dilemma. He asserted DEMO an
individual who receives cooperation from another develops a liking for
that individual, increasing the likelihood of the person's behaving in a
trustworthy fashion. Boyle and Bonacich described the dynamic interplay
between experiences and trust. DEMO argued that "a Cooperative r-ove by
Opponent will increase Player's DEMO in him, while a Noncooperative
move will decrease Player's trust" (1970: 130). Other researchers have
used a repeated decision game DEMO show how trust emerges in a transac-
tion between two parties (DEMO, Butler, 1983; Dasgupta, 1988; Davis, Helms,
& Henkin, 1989; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992).
Our proposed model incorporates the dynamic nature of trust. This is
represented in Figure 1 by the DEMO loop from the "Outcomes" of RTR
to the perceived characteristics of the trustee. When a trustor takes a risk
in a trustee that DEMO to a positive outcome, the trustor's perceptions of
the trustee DEMO enhanced. Likewise, perceptions of the trustee will decline
when trust leads DEMO unfavorable conclusions. Boyle and Bonacich (1970)
have suggested that the DEMO of engaging in a trusting behavior will
affect trust directly. We propose that the outcome of the trusting behavior
(favorable or unfavorable) will DEMO trust indirectly through the per-
ceptions of ability, benevolence, and integrity at the next interaction. For
example, a manager empowers an employee to deal with a task that is
critical to the manager's performance. DEMO the employee's performance of
the task is very good, the DEMO's perception of the employee's trust-
worthiness will be enhanced. Conversely, if the employee performs
poorly and damages the manager's reputation, DEMO manager's perception
of the employee's trustworthiness is diminished. The manager may at-
tribute the employee's high or low performance to ability, benevolence,
and/or integrity, depending upon the situation.
Proposition 6. Outcomes of trusting behaviors (i.e., RTR)
will lead to updating of DEMO perceptions of the ability,
benevolence, and integrity of the trustee.
DEMO
and Future Directions
This article raises a number of issues for the study of trust in orga-
nizations. Each is considered and dealt with DEMO the development of a
1995
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
729
model of dyadic trust in DEMO organizational context. The model proposed in
this article is the first that explicitly considers both characteristics of the
trustee as well as the trustor. DEMO model clearly differentiates trust from
factors that contribute to it, and DEMO also differentiates trust from its out-
come of risk taking in the relationship. The current approach defines trust
in a way that distinguishes trust DEMO other similar constructs (coopera-
tion, confidence, predictability), which often DEMO been confused with
trust in the literature. Likewise, the critical role DEMO risk is clearly specified
in this model. This article develops a versatile definition of trust and a
parsimonious set of determinants.
The differentiations between DEMO that cause trust, trust itself, and
outcomes of trust are critical to the validation of this model. All three must
be measured in DEMO to fully test the model. Measures of the perceptions
of a trustee's ability, benevolence, and integrity must be developed that
are consistent DEMO the definitions provided. Behaviors that are charac-
terized by vulnerability and the lack of ability to monitor or control can be
assessed to operationalize DEMO RTR must be measured in terms of actual
behavior, not willingness DEMO engage in behavior. Such behaviors as mon-
itoring are examples of a lack of risk taking in relationship. Dealing with
these behaviors from a DEMO perspective requires a reverse scor-
ing of the measure of their occurrence. The extent of perceived risk in-
volved in engaging in the trusting DEMO should be assessed either
directly (e.g., through survey items) or DEMO for, such as structuring
a simulation wherein the subjects have a DEMO number of possible
responses that clearly vary in the amount of risk they involve. The most
problematic component of the model from the standpoint DEMO measurement
is trust itself. Because trust is a willingness to be vulnerable, a measure
that assesses that willingness is needed. Even though trust is conceptu-
ally easy to differentiate from perceived ability, benevolence, and integ-
DEMO of the trustee, separating the willingness to be vulnerable from actu-
DEMO being vulnerable constitutes a finer distinction. To measure trust
itself, a DEMO or other similar methodology that taps into the person's
willingness to be vulnerable to the trustee is needed, because this is
distinct from observable RTR.
The question "Do you trust them?" must be qualified: "trust them to do
what?" The issue on which you DEMO them depends not only on the assess-
ment of integrity and benevolence, but also on the ability to accomplish
it. Thus, if a DEMO is trusted on one task, will that increase the trust on
DEMO unrelated task, even in the absence of data on the party'DEMO ability
on the new task? Consistent with the arguments of Sitkin DEMO Roth (1993),
this model suggests that assessments of ability may not generalize across
dissimilar tasks or situations.
Several limitations of the proposed DEMO should be recognized.
First, its focus is limited to trust of DEMO specific trustor for a specific trustee.
Thus, its contribution to understanding DEMO in a social system (e.g.,
Barber, 1983; Lewis & DEMO, 1985) is beyond the scope of this model.
Second, trust DEMO considered in this model is unidirectional: from a given
730
Academy of Management Review
July
trustor to a given trustee. In DEMO present form it is not designed to examine
the development of mutual trust between two parties. Third, this model is
focused on trust in an organizational relationship, and its propositions
may not generalize to relationships in other contexts. Finally, the labels
for the constructs in this model were selected from several options used
earlier in the trust literature. To us, these labels most clearly reflected the
constructs as defined in the proposed DEMO; however, in some cases this
necessitated that the definitions vary somewhat from some of the prior
uses of the same terms.
In addition DEMO model-specific hypotheses, a number of other avenues
of research should be DEMO For example, the process by which trust
develops needs further exploration. DEMO propose that the need for trusting
behavior often arises while there is still a lack of data regarding some of
the three factors. For DEMO, an employee may not have had enough
interaction with a given DEMO to be able to assess the manager's
benevolence toward him or her. In order to gather such data, the em-
ployee first may have to be vulnerable (i.e., to trust the manager) to see
how the manager deals with the vulnerability. In this instance, the em-
ployee may have to display a type of trust similar to blind DEMO Depend-
ing on how the manager responds to the vulnerability, the DEMO will
develop more or less trust.
A number of theorists have suggested that trust evolves over time
based on a series of observations and DEMO A critical issue is the
process by which trust evolves, given DEMO framework of our model. Further
research should investigate the relationship between trust and coopera-
tion. Game theorists tend to equate cooperation and trust, suggesting that
over time a pattern of cooperative behavior develops trust (Axelrod, DEMO).
To what extent does cooperation that can be attributed to external moti-
vations develop trust? This idea also suggests the need to test the feed-
back loop in the proposed model.
There are many areas DEMO organizational studies in which trust has
been cited as playing a key role. Further development and operational-
ization of the model proposed in this DEMO would benefit the study of
organizations through an increased understanding of such topics as em-
ployee-organization linkages, negotiation, and the implementation of
self-managed DEMO
