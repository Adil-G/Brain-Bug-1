Predicting and Understanding
Organization Structure
Size is examined as a DEMO of organization structure
British sample of business organizations, supplemented by findings
DEMO unions, engineering firms, and the Aston sample of varied work organiza-
tions.' Where possible, comparison is also made with the results
study. DEMO the broad outlines of formal organization structures
with a high degree of confidence from a knowledge of organization size, a com-
parison of size-structure regressions across different industries suggests that other
variables must also be taken DEMO account. A solution, more satisfying both the-
oretically and statistically, emerges when complexity is distinguished from other
aspects of structure which more directly DEMO the framework of bureau-
cratic control-namely, the degree of formalization and DEMO It is
then found that while size, with technology, location and environmental vari-
ables, predicts complexity, the degree of complexity itself has DEMO more direct rela-
tionship with formalization than does size. Size, however, remains the major
predictor of decentralization. It is concluded that, in the organizations studied,
complexity cannot be satisfactorily predicted or fully understood without DEMO
ence to the economics of scale, but that it is neither DEMO convincing nor
statistically demonstrable that size in itself is the major determinant of formaliza-
tion.

Large-scale complex organization and bu-
reaucracy are often regarded as synonymous.
Within this identity, however, are sub-
merged two major issues which DEMO to
exercise the minds of organization theorists.
First, how critical is DEMO as a predictor, if
not a determinant, of organizational struc-
ture? Second, is complexity also important for
predicting the form of organization, and if
so how is it associated with size and other
contextual DEMO?
Size of organization has often been cited
as the attribute having the greatest single
influence on the extent to which organiza-
* The DEMO was carried out at the Industrial
Administration Research Unit, University of DEMO
in Birmingham, England, and at the London Gradu-
ate School of Business Studies. It was supported by
the Social Science Research Council. The DEMO is

Donaldson for allowing him to reanalyze their re-
search data, and to Howard Aldrich, Colin Fletcher,
and Alfred Kieser for their comments on a draft of
this article.
tions develop bureaucratic forms of or-
ganization structure. Thus DEMO (1958:
211) commented on the "role of sheer
quantity DEMO a leverage for the bureau-
cratization of a social structure". Pugh and
his colleagues (1969: 112) were prompted
by their research to suggest that "size
causes [bureaucratic] structuring through
its effect on intervening variables such as
the frequency of decisions and social con-
trol". In DEMO, others such as Wood-
ward (1965), Thompson (1967), DEMO
Aldrich (1972) have argued on theoretical
and empirical grounds that the tasks and
technology of an organization are more
salient influences on structure DEMO is its
size. Hall (1972: 139) has recently re-
viewed DEMO debate, to which his own re-
search has contributed, and he takes a
very qualified view on the role of size:
There DEMO no 'laws' regarding size and other
organizational characteristics .... Size, DEMO
related to some important characteristics, is not
168
Child: PREDICTING ORGANIZATION
as important as other factors in understanding
the form organizations take. When size (and
growth) is taken in conjunction with DEMO
logical and environmental factors, predictions
regarding organizational structures and processes
can DEMO made.
Complexity is frequently regarded as a
major defining characteristic of modern or-
ganizations and also as an important de-
terminant of other structural DEMO
Complexity of relationships and of activi-
ties may have its source both in a high
degree of differentiation between roles and
functions and in DEMO application of high
levels of expertise to the work performed
(Hage DEMO Aiken, 1970). Complexity is
likely to generate administrative problems
of DEMO and control. One of the
ways in which such problems may be met
is through increased formalization; that is,
by the elaboration of controls in the form
of standard rules, procedures and systems,
and by the use of documentation and rec-
ords. This bureaucratic type of DEMO
to complexity probably typifies commercial
and administrative organizations rather than
professional ones; it was not found, for ex-
ample, in the welfare agencies studied by
Hage and Aiken (1967). With this limitation,
it can be hypothesized that complexity is a
major determinant of formalization. The
DEMO then remain as to what variables
predict different levels of complexity, DEMO
whether complexity becomes, as Hall (1972)
also argues, more DEMO than size for un-
derstanding organizations.
These questions form the subject of this ar-
ticle. First, size of organizations is examined
as a predictor of structure. Then, because
examination of the data suggests that con-
textual variables other than size are also
related systematically to structural charac-
teristics, an attempt is made to develop and
test a multivariate model of DEMO
structure. This model accepts the case for
differentiating structure in terms of two ma-
jor aspects: (1) complexity and (2) strategy
of control. It postulates that size in conjunc-
tion with other contextual variables DEMO be a
major predictor of complexity, but that com-
plexity will DEMO a more direct, and therefore
stronger, influence on the extent to which a
bureaucratic strategy of control is present.
STRUCTURE
Formalization along with DEMO deci-
sion making is taken to represent the bu-
reaucratic control strategy.
DATA AND RESULTS
Data
The main source of data for this analysis
DEMO a sample of eighty-two British business
organizations, stratified in terms of DEMO in-
dustries and number of employees. This sam-
ple has been described in an earlier article
(Child, 1972), and is called the "National"
sample. Further comparative data were pro-
vided from the "Aston" sample of forty-six
varied work organizations (Pugh et al., 1968,
1969), a small sample of nine engineering
firms (Hinings and Lee, 1971) and a sample
of seven labor unions (Warner and Donald-
son, 1971). These four studies were British
and all used the same measures of organiza-
tion structure first developed by Pugh and
his DEMO Some comparison was also
possible with Blau and Schoenherr's study
(DEMO) of fifty-three United States employ-
ment security agencies, which employed
some measures of structure conceptually and
operationally similar to those of Pugh and
DEMO colleagues.
The Strength of Association between Size
and Organization Structure
There are several ways to conceive of
measuring the size of an organization. In DEMO
National study measures were taken of total
numbers employed (counting part-time DEMO
ployees as half), number of sites, net assets
and sales DEMO, all of which are indica-
tors of scale. Although there were DEMO
in the interrelationships of these indicators
between different industries, Table 1 DEMO
that numbers employed, sales turnover and
number of sites were closely DEMO over
the whole sample.
In their Aston study, Pugh et al. (1969:
98) found a correlation of r = .78 between
numbers employed and net assets. The rela-
tively low correlations between these mea-
DEMO in the National study was the result of
twenty-seven of the organizations being in
two service industries-advertising and in-
surance-where the role of financial DEMO is
not comparable with that of manufacturing

concerns. When the remaining subsample of
manufacturing organizations was taken sepa-
rately, the correlation between numbers em-
ployed and net assets rose dramatically to
r = .86.
The Aston researchers, and indeed most
students of organization structure, have taken
the number of people employed as their main
referent for size. One would expect, since it
is people who are organized, that their num-
bers will have a closer relationship to struc-
ture than will other aspects of size. The data
DEMO the Aston and National studies support
this expectation. Moreover, in both DEMO
a logarithmic transformation of total num-
bers employed was usually found to give a
closer fit to a linear relationship with struc-
tural variables; therefore, this will be used as
the main measure of size.
The concept of organization structure to
be used is Weberian, and is operationalized
as in the multi-item measurement developed
by Pugh et al. (1968) DEMO (1) functional spe-
cialization, (2) overall role specialization,
(3) overall standardization of rules and pro-
cedures, (4) overall DEMO (called
"overall formalization" by Pugh et al., (5)

the logarithmic number of employees in
United States employment security agencies
and measures of structure comparable to
those of Pugh et DEMO (1968). Blau and Schoen-
herr's measure "number of hierarchical levels"
is identical to vertical span except that it ex-
cludes DEMO deputy and assistant managers,
while Pugh et al. exclude only "DEMO to".
Their measure "division of labor" is a count
of different job titles, ignoring different
grades, and has affinities with overall DEMO
specialization except that the latter does not
include specialized roles in the main work-
flow function: that is, "production" and
equivalent roles. DEMO and Schoenherr's
"number of divisions" compares with func-
tional specialization, except for the same
reservation about the work-flow area and for
the further difference that it counts the
presence of more than one division DEMO a
functionally specialized area. Their measures
of official civil service regulations and of
delegation are conceptually comparable to
standardization and decentralization in Pugh
et DEMO, but operationally they are less close.
Blau and Schoenherr employed no DEMO
equivalent to the Pugh et al. measure of over-
all documentation.
Reading across Table 2, not only are all
the correlations between size and each struc-
tural variable consistently in the same direc-
tion, but in most cases the level of correlation
as an indicator of the strength DEMO association
remains stable. This degree of stability is
noteworthy in view of the fact that the five
samples of organizations differed in location
and DEMO of activity. The Blau-Schoenherr
correlations depart from the levels shown by
the studies using the Aston measures with
extent of regulations and with delegation.
DEMO may be due to these being less com-
parable with the Aston equivalents. Among
the Aston school of studies, the relationship
between size and overall centralization of
decision making exhibits the greatest amount
of variation, with the correlation for the
original Aston study being noticeably lower
than that DEMO the other three studies. It was
pointed out in an earlier paper on organiza-
tion structure (Child, 1972) that the Pugh
et al. (1968) measure of centralization is
sensitive to differences in the status DEMO an
STRUCTURE
organization; in particular whether it is a
branch (site, department, or similar unit) or
whether it has higher status as a relatively
self-sufficient functioning unit. The original
Aston sample, unlike the other three studies,
included a large proportion of branches
(twenty out of forty-six organizations), and
this feature may account for some of the
DEMO in correlations. Donaldson (1972)
has also indicated that the inclusion DEMO gov-
ernmental organizations in the Aston sample
shifted the level of this correlation.
With a few explicable exceptions, the pro-
portion of variance in the major dimensions
of organization structure predictable from
knowing the size of DEMO appears to
be highly consistent across different samples
of work organizations. Larger organizations
are more bureaucratic. It is also evident
from Table 2 that DEMO strength of the size-
structure relationship tends to rise among
manufacturing organizations. It is not clear
at present whether this points to a real DEMO
ence in this relationship as between service
and manufacturing organizations, or DEMO
it is partly a product of the Pugh et al.
(1968) schedule of measures, which is still
slightly oriented towards manufacturing op-
erations.
Forms of Association between Size and
Organization Structure
A general statement of DEMO form of associa-
tion between size and organization structure
has just been given. Larger organizations are
more specialized, have more rules, more doc-
DEMO, more extended hierarchies, and
a greater decentralization of decision making
further down such hierarchies. This, how-
ever, is merely to state the DEMO of rela-
tionships between size and structure. Can we
be more precise by identifying the ratios or
slopes of structural values in relation to
DEMO in organizational size? Are these
slopes consistent when comparing different
samples DEMO organizations? If they are, then
we may find ourselves on the threshold of
precise prediction which has real practical
value as well as DEMO significance.
Blau and Schoenherr (1971) explored the
relationship between size of organization and
171

structural differentiation. They saw differen-
tiation as having DEMO horizontal dimension, in
terms of the number of divisions and the DEMO
vision of labor, and a vertical dimension in
terms of the DEMO of hierarchical levels.
They found that although size had a positive
relationship with structural differentiation,
this was not linear: differentiation increased
with size at a declining rate. A logarithmic
transformation of size, as measured by total
numbers employed, therefore gave a higher
linear correlation with measures of structural
differentiation.
In Figures 1 to 3, the regression curves on
size of organization for three dimensions of
structural differentiation are compared for
data DEMO from the National, Aston and
Blau-Schoenherr studies. A comparison is
made DEMO the measures of vertical span,
functional specialization and overall role
specialization used in the first two studies
and, respectively, the number of DEMO
levels, the number of divisions and the divi-
sion of labor DEMO used by Blau and
Schoenherr. For purposes of broad compari-
son Blau and Schoenherr's method (1971: 64
note) for computing approximate regression
curves has been adopted for all the data in
Figures 1, 2, and 3. Blau and Shoenherr's
graphs have been transcribed as accurately
as possible to the scales shown.
The shape of the regression curves DEMO simi-
lar for the three sets of data in each of the
diagrams, and in the case of vertical span
and number of hierarchical levels the curves
are almost identical (Figure 1). Here Blau
and Schoenherr's measure comes operation-
ally closest to that used with the DEMO
and Aston data. The lower values per size
level of the Blau-Schoenherr curve are prob-
ably due to the exclusion from their measure
of DEMO level bearing the title of deputy or as-
sistant manager. For functional specialization
(Figure 2), the National and Aston curves
are similar in shape and suggest a more rapid
rise in departmentalization than the equiva-
DEMO Blau and Schoenherr measure in orga-
nizations up to about 1,000 employees. For
overall role specialization (Figure 3), the
National and Aston curves show a more
marked decline in the rate of increase with
DEMO size than the Blau and Schoenherr
curve. Every curve in each- figure shows a
curvilinear decay function in the structural
variable when plotted against DEMO size
of organization.

were also drawn for the other major struc-

The consistency shown by the regressions
of structural variables on size of organization
may be assessed more precisely by compar-
ing the DEMO equations for both the Na-
tional and Aston samples, and also DEMO the
labor union sample studied by Warner and
Donaldson (1971). DEMO data, secured by the
same measurements, were available for these
three samples. Table 4 gives a comparison of
values for the equation:
DEMO
y = a + bx
y = a given variable of organization
structure
x = size of organization (log. total
employees)
a = constant
b = regression coefficient
With the exception of centralization, the re-
gression equations for each structural vari-
able on size of organization were DEMO simi-
lar, particularly in regard to the regression
coefficients, which indicate the rate at which
scores on the structural variable change with
vanced DEMO Child et al. (1973) that in occupa-
tional interest associations such as unions,
the requirements of widespread geographical
communication, the recording of democratic
processes and other characteristics would re-
sult in (1) more DEMO than in other
types of organization of comparable size, and
(2) a certain minimum of paperwork what-
ever the size of organization. With the latter
proposition in mind, it may be noted that the
documentation constant for the labor union
sample is positive, unlike those for the two
other samples of organizations. The regres-
sion coefficients for vertical span DEMO partic-
ularly close in the three studies, suggesting
that organizations employing DEMO, 1,000 and
10,000 personnel tend respectively to have
hierarchies DEMO to about four, six, and
seven to eight levels. Finally, DEMO more dis-
parate results between the three samples for
the regression of centralization on size may,
as has been suggested, be due in part to the
sensitivity of this measure, as a comparative
index, DEMO definitions of hierarchical status
within organizations. Such definitions were
problematic in all three studies, especially

DEMO far we have only examined size as a
predictor of organization structure. It be-
came apparent, however, from subjecting the
National data to DEMO analysis of variance that
the location of the organizations studied in
their six separate industries also predicted
differences between some structural vari-
ables. These DEMO were advertising,
chocolate and sweets, daily newspapers, elec-
tronics, DEMO, and pharmaceuticals. A
stratification by industry discriminated be-
tween scores on DEMO specialization, func-
tional specialization, standardization, and
documentation with approximately the DEMO
degree of statistical confidence (p < .001)
as did a DEMO by size groups. There
was no appreciable interaction between size
and industry as predictors. When the regres-
sions of these structural variables on size
DEMO recomputed industry by industry, the
values of constants and coefficients obtained
DEMO became more dispersed, as shown
in Table 5 for functional specialization, stan-
dardization and documentation. For example,
the organizations located in the DEMO
industry had large constants, but modest re-
gression "slopes" compared DEMO the other in-
dustry subsamples. This indicates that, when
contrasted to DEMO of a similar size
located in other industries, small electronics
companies DEMO to have structures which are
more bureaucratized. Among larger orga-
nizations of, say, 10,000 employees, elec-
tronics companies do not, however, have
relatively very much more specialization,
standardization, or documentation than other
types of company. This pattern is also evi-
dent to a lesser DEMO among pharmaceuti-
cal companies. The small ones tend to be
rather bureaucratic as small companies go,
while the large companies, although still on
the bureaucratic side compared with other
large companies, are not extremely so.
To illustrate these industry patterns fur-
ther, the regression equations obtained for
each industry group in the National sample
have been solved for two DEMO levels that
constitute the extremities of the range sam-
pled: 100 DEMO and 10,000 employees.

The solutions obtained are listed in Table 6.
They suggest that in the manufacturing in-
DEMO of electronics, pharmaceuticals, and
chocolate-sweets there is more interindustry
diversity of structures in small organizations
than in large ones, whereas organizations in
the service industries, advertising and insur-
ance, tend to have relatively unbureaucratic
DEMO at all size levels. In the newspaper
industry, smaller organizations are DEMO
ately bureaucratic for their size, while large
organizations are relatively unbureaucratic
DEMO their size. The larger newspaper organi-
zations sampled were in fact national daily
publishing houses in London's Fleet Street,
which have often DEMO comment (usually
critical) for operating traditional, informal,
and unsystematic DEMO of management
(Economist Intelligence Unit, 1966).
In short, it DEMO possible, from a knowledge of
how many people are employed, to predict
with a high degree of confidence the broad
outlines of formal DEMO structure.
Nevertheless, a comparison of structure-size
regressions across different industries has DEMO
dicated that a knowledge of other variables,
for which industry is undoubtedly acting as
a proxy, can also add to the predictability of
organization structure.
A MODEL OF ORGANIZATION
STRUCTURE
The conclusion that size is DEMO major, but not
the only, important predictor of organization
structure returns us to the theoretical issues
outlined at the beginning of this article.
DEMO are other predictors of organization
structure? Is the complexity of an DEMO
tion possibly a mediating factor between the
predictors and other variables of structure?
To approach these questions, I shall try to
outline a theoretical framework in three
stages. The first stage entails a reformulation
of DEMO Aston conception of structure, in which
complexity and bureaucratic control are DEMO
separately distinguished. The second stage
involves an identification of the contextual
variables likely to influence the degree of
complexity in organizations. The third stage
DEMO concerned with the relationship between
complexity and bureaucratic control, and
with DEMO comparative status of complexity
and size as predictors of such control.

Distinguishing Complexity from
Bureaucratic Control
DEMO conceptual distinction made here is
well established in thinking on organization,
and was alluded to in the opening to this
article. Hage, Aiken, and Hall, among others,
have distinguished between complexity and
formalization, and Blau and Schoenherr be-
tween differentiation and administration. Dif-
ferentiation, especially of functions and roles,
is one major component of organizational
complexity. DEMO is the level and range of
specialized expertise applied to organiza-
tional activities. A bureaucratic mode of con-
trol is characterized both by formalization,DEMO
that is, use of standard procedures and doc-
umentation, and also by the decentralization
of decision making (Child, 1972). In princi-
DEMO, authority to make routine decisions is
delegated in a bureaucracy down DEMO the in-
cumbents of officially designated roles. These
roles are structured by a system of procedure
and documentation designed to limit areas
of discretion DEMO well as to provide informa-
tion on role performance.
In the following analysis, the degree of
complexity within organizations is assessed
by scores on measures of specialization and
qualifications. The specialization measures
used are functional and DEMO specialization.
These scales do not include specialization in
workflow functions, and DEMO measure of the
number of workflow divisions was therefore
also constructed with the intention of aggre-
gating this to scores on functional specializa-
tion. DEMO, while increases in workflow
divisions were related to increases in the
DEMO of functional (staff) specialisms in
manufacturing organizations, they were not
DEMO related over the whole sample of
eighty-two organizations (r = .22)DEMO There-
fore, an aggregate specialization score cannot
be used. Although the DEMO of workflow
divisions was included in statistical analyses
as an aspect of complexity, it did not share
in any significant relationship when partial-
led against other variables, especially against
size with which it is correlated (DEMO = .62 with
log. total employees).
A further indicator of complexity in orga-
nizational tasks and relationships is the pre-
sence of many DEMO types of expertise.
The measure used for assessing expertise is
the level of specialist qualifications held by
the members of seven nonworkflow func-
tions, where comparisons could satisfactorily
be made across different types of organiza-
tion. DEMO seven functions are research and
development, finance, quality control, work-
DEMO methods, maintenance, personnel, and
welfare. A score of 1 was DEMO when at
least one specialist in each function held a
relevant recognized professional qualifica-
tion. Finally, the degree of bureaucratic con-
trol within organizations is assessed by scores
on overall standardization, overall documen-
tation, and DEMO decentralization. Table
7 gives the correlations between (a) the
measures of complexity, and (b) the mea-
sures of bureaucratic control applied to the
National sample.

hew et al. (1972) have argued that DEMO
values of size generate certain logical pos-
sibilities for specialization. Indeed, DEMO rela-
tionship between size and role specialization
would be tautological if by specialization one
simply understood different people in sepa-
rate, though not necessarily substantively dif-
ferent, jobs. This is, however, not true for
studies adopting the Aston approach, which
measure role specialization as a complete re-
striction to a limited and defined set of activ-
ities except under DEMO circumstances
such as illness of other personnel. Writers
such as Thompson (DEMO) and Woodward
(1965), when arguing that larger size did
not predict more complex organization struc-
tures, seem to have had in mind both the
possibility that a larger number of employees
need not be DEMO specialized than a smaller
number and also the likelihood that special-
ization is influenced independently by the
task and technology of the organization. Op-
DEMO of benefiting from economies of
scale in the division of labor would lead one
to expect that increasing specialization nor-
mally accompanies increasing size, and that
the level of specialist qualifications also rises
with larger size. DEMO it is reasonable to sup-
pose that the degree of specialization pos-
sible without incurring serious diseconomies
depends partly on the availability of appro-
DEMO expertise among role incumbents.
Among other contextual variables, one
might first DEMO that the use of a more in-
tegrated and automated workflow technology
would set up requirements for the employ-
ment of specialized and qualified DEMO
staff. Second, organization theorists have of-
ten postulated that a greater DEMO of infor-
mation across organizational boundaries to
and from the environment will increase pres-
sures towards specialization among em-
ployees occupying boundary roles, and
among the functional units to which they be-
long. Third, in addition to the size of an or-
ganization as a whole, the size of each of its
operating units may be relevant for com-
plexity, especially for specialization. While
an organization may tend to adopt an
advanced DEMO of labor and functions
because it is large, if it also DEMO on
many sites, the average size of which is thus
reduced, the economics of personnel utiliza-
tion may prevent a high degree of DEMO
flow specialization within each site. Geo-
graphical differentiation is thus postulated
as tending to reduce horizontal organiza-
tional differentiation among nonworkflow
personnel when controlling DEMO size. Work-
flow differentiation will probably increase
with the number of sites, but at the same
time line functions will tend to retain re-
sponsibility for more staff functions than
otherwise.
One can expect, therefore, DEMO organiza-
tional complexity will be predicted positively
by size, advanced technology DEMO greater
contact across organizational boundaries,
and negatively by the number of operating
sites when size is partialled out. To test these
propositions with DEMO available data, the
measure "workflow integration" (Pugh et al.,
1969), which is loaded heavily on rigidity
and automation scales, was used as an indi-
cator of advanced technology. The number
of areas DEMO work from which activities were
contracted out to independent environmen-
tal organizations and the size of an organiza-
tion's owning group were both DEMO as proxy
measures for contact across organizational
boundaries. The size of owning group be-
comes the same as size of organization when
the organization DEMO does not belong to a
wider group. Size of owning group is as-
sumed to be an indirect indicator of contacts
between members of DEMO organization and
personnel in its group, contacts which allow
the presence DEMO group policy and practice

on specialization and qualifications to influ-
ence the pattern of complexity adopted for
the subsidiary. Insofar as owning groups
DEMO larger than subsidiaries, and that size has
a positive association with DEMO, then
the direction of influence of group practice
on subsidiary complexity DEMO postulated to be
positive. Finally, the number of operating
sites is DEMO as a straight count.
The model postulates, in short, that the
level of organizational complexity assessed
by role specialization, functional specializa-
tion, DEMO specialist qualifications, will be
positively predicted by (1) larger size DEMO or-
ganizations, (2) a more integrated and auto-
mated technology, (3) a greater range of
activities contracted out, and (4) the orga-
nization belonging to a larger owning group.
The level of DEMO is hypothesized to be
negatively predicted by a larger number of
operating sites, when controlling for size of
organization. These propositions were tested
on data from the National study by using
multiple regression analysis, with the results
shown in Table 8. This table shows the stan-
dardized regression DEMO (Beta coeffi-
cients) obtained for each hypothesized
predictor of overall role specialization,
functional specialization, and the level of
specialist qualifications. The standardization
of the regression coefficients allowed direct
comparisons of the relative weight that DEMO
variable added to the prediction of complex-
ity. Table 8 indicates that the directions of
relation between all three indicators of com-
plexity and DEMO postulated predictors are
as hypothesized.
All the predictors of overall role specializa-
tion attained normally acceptable levels of
statistical confidence. Size of organization
had DEMO greatest influence in predicting levels
of role specialization, but the range DEMO activ-
ities contracted out also had a substantial in-
fluence. Technology emerged as a fairly weak
predictor of role specialization, and this is
because the aggregative measure of overall
role specialization masked some variation in
the DEMO of association between technol-
ogy and role specialization in different func-
tional areas (Child and Mansfield, 1972).
Size of organization was also DEMO strongest
predictor of specialization between func-
tional areas and of level of specialist qualifi-
cations. The size of the owning group
appeared to increase DEMO specializa-
tion within organizations, more than it in-
creased the level DEMO role specialization. The
number of operating sites did not have any
significant predictive power with functional
specialization or with level of specialist qual-
ifications. DEMO level of specialist qualifica-
tions was in fact only predicted by size of
organization and the contracting out of ac-
tivities, although none of the coefficients for
other variables fell below one-and-a-half
times their standard errors. DEMO three-
quarters of the total variance in role special-
ization was predicted by the model used, ap-
proaching two-thirds of the total variance
in functional specialization, but only 46 per-
cent of the variance in the level of specialist
qualifications. It may be added that the
model also DEMO 45 percent of the total
variation in the number of workflow divisions
in organizations; size of organization alone
accounted for 39 percent of this, while work-
flow integration added another 4 percent.
Larger organizations tended to have more
workflow divisions, but more technologically
integrated organizations tended to have fewer
workflow divisions.
A larger size of organizations thus ap-
peared to DEMO an important predictor of higher
levels of organizational complexity, in the
DEMO of all four indicators just discussed. It
was a consistently stronger predictor in its
logarithmic form, which confirms the thesis
that the marginal effects of size decline with
increases in size. The other consistently sig-
nificant DEMO of role and functional spe-
cialization, and of specialist qualifications,
DEMO the contracting out of activities, but one
cannot be sure that DEMO increase in the con-
tracting out was not a consequence of in-
creased specialization and the employment
of more expert staff, rather than being solely
a prior condition. Nonetheless, with this res-
ervation and the rather limited prediction of
variations in qualifications, we can conclude
that the attempt to supply a reasoned argu-
ment on the prediction of organizational
complexity DEMO some support from the

empirical data. The analysis demonstrated
strong links between size and complexity
even when other contextual variables were
taken into DEMO It now remains to con-
sider the relative influence of size and com-
plexity on the level of bureaucratic control.
Size, Complexity and Bureaucratic Control
The observation that bureaucratization is
more evident and extensive among larger DEMO
ganizations has been discussed and substan-
tiated in the earlier part of this article.
However, it is not likely to be large size in
itself which, in causal terms, is of direct con-
sequence for DEMO degree of bureaucratic con-
trol utilized. Thompson (1967) has argued
that larger organizations are not necessarily
those with the most elaborate administration.
This DEMO is acceptable insofar as
one may argue that it is the degree of com-
plexity rather than size which tends in a
sense to DEMO managements towards bureau-
cracy or some other elaborate system of coor-
dination and control. A large number of low-
skilled employees in unspecialized activities
DEMO usually be managed through a simple
system of direct command more readily than
employees with greater expertise, engaged in
specialized activities. With specialization and
expertise (that is, complexity) it is therefore
predictable that managerial control tends to
become indirect and impersonal. The possi-
bility for decentralization of DEMO to
qualified employees and the necessity to do
so will both be more in evidence. Decentral-
ization is likely to be accompanied by an
DEMO in standard procedures and docu-
mentation designed to maintain control and
consistency of performance. In addition, the
employment of qualified specialists such as
those in personnel, accounts, workflow plan-
ning and maintenance, is itself likely to gen-
erate more standardization of procedures and
documentation. Specialists such as DEMO have
generally been trained to institute sound
management systems which usually entail
standard procedures and forms. It is not diffi-
cult for them to DEMO that a justification of
their continued presence in the organization
depends upon activity of this kind.
In short, one can postulate that organiza-
tional complexity will be a major positive
predictor of overall standardization, overall
documentation and overall decentralization,
a predictor somewhat stronger than is size of
DEMO As previously noted, the size of
the owning group was used DEMO a proxy mea-
sure for the transmission of owning group
organizational practices to a subsidiary. The
larger size and therefore the presumed
greater complexity DEMO owning groups was as-
sumed to predict that group practices would
act as a positive influence towards bureau-
cratic modes of control in a DEMO
Multiple regression analysis was again
used, and the results are given DEMO Table 9.
Role specialization was the main predictor
of overall standardization and documenta-
tion, and a somewhat stronger predictor than
functional specialization. Both measures of
specialization were more highly correlated
with the dependent variables than was DEMO
of organization, and their inclusion in the
equation eliminated any predictive DEMO
otherwise possessed by size. The level of
specialist qualifications and the size of the
owning group were the other two positive
predictors of standardization DEMO documen-
tation. Workflow integration (technology)
emerged as a negative predictor DEMO documen-
tation. With greater workflow integration
(other variables being equal) there was less
paperwork, probably reflecting factors such
as the greater ease of production and quality
control with more integrated and automated
technologies.
So far DEMO data support the proposition
that complexity predicts the presence of bu-
reaucratic control, and predicts it somewhat
more strongly than does organizational size.
This proposition is not, however, supported
in respect of the decentralization of DEMO
making. The relationship of decentralization
with larger size was considerably stronger
than that with specialization or with the
level of specialist qualifications. In fact, a
higher level of specialist qualifications did
not predict decentralization at all DEMO a mul-
tivariate analysis. A higher level of role
specialization did predict greater decen-
tralization in a multiple regression analysis
(p < .01) DEMO postulated by the model, but
functional specialization when partialled out
against DEMO specialization actually predicted

greater centralization (p < .01). This result
might suggest that centralized decision
making can be maintained with a rising level
DEMO specialization among functional areas of
work so long as those areas of work are them-
selves internally homogeneous and not or-
ganizationally complex. If DEMO areas
have high levels of internal role specializa-
tion, then the DEMO complexity of rela-
tionships may encourage greater decentral-
ization down the organizational hierarchy.
It would nevertheless be misleading to
attach too much weight to DEMO foregoing in-
terpretation without alluding to the question
of size. For in the National data, a progres-
sion through the sample from smaller to
larger organizations was accompanied by an
increasing ratio of role specialization to
DEMO specialization scores; in other
words, by increasing heterogeneity within
functional units. Thus the apparently com-
plex relationship between specialization and
decentralization is almost DEMO a reflec-
tion of the stronger relationship between size
of organization and decentralization.
When all the contextual and structural
predictors included in the model DEMO organiza-
tion structure were taken into account, the
three variables shown DEMO Table 9 emerged as
statistically significant predictors of decen-
tralization. Size of organization was the
strongest single predictor; however, only 45
percent of DEMO total variance in decentraliza-
tion was accounted for. Other analyses of
the National data indicated that prediction
of the centralization-decentralization dimen-
sion could be DEMO if one takes account
of variables not considered here. For ex-
ample, the degree to which control was con-
centrated within the hands of legal company
ownership was also relevant, since a greater
concentration of ownership and control pre-
dicted greater centralization of decision
making.
In the more DEMO analysis considered
here, larger size of organization and the use
of DEMO documentation predicted greater
decentralization, while greater workflow in-
tegration was associated DEMO less decentral-
ization. If documentation were statistically
eliminated, then standardization replaced DEMO
as a predictor of decentralization. These last
results confirm that decentralization to an
important extent forms part of the bureau-
cratic strategy of control. DEMO seems reasonable
to speculate that larger size exerts pressures
on the administrators of an organization to
decentralize, because this makes it in-
creasingly difficult to continue a personalized
boss style of management. The develop-
Child: PREDICTING ORGANIZATION

183
ment of standardized procedures and docu-
mentation helps to establish a system of
impersonal and indirect control instead. As
DEMO and Schoenherr (1971: 136) have con-
cluded from their study, "large size must be
complemented by conditions that improve
the reliability of operations in order to effect
official delegation of authority." However, a
DEMO integrated and automated workflow
technology may reduce the complexity and
variability in certain areas of decision making
and so permit the overall level of DEMO
tion to be higher than would otherwise be
the case. This interpretation, of course, as-
sumes that most senior managers have a
preference DEMO centralized decision making.
CONCLUSION
The results which emerged from applying
the model of organization structure to the
National data suggest the relationships sum-
marized DEMO Figure 4. The arrows in the figure
depict the likely directions of dominant in-
fluence. In this form, the figure presents as
yet unproven hypotheses on major organiza-
tional processes which, however, are not
apparently DEMO by the data. Size of or-
ganization is seen to exert a dominant in-
fluence upon the level of organizational
complexity. Complexity levels are DEMO seen
to be influenced by the integration and auto-
mation of technology, the number of differ-
ent operating sites used, and contacts across
DEMO boundaries. In regard to bu-
reaucratic control, formalization is seen to
DEMO primarily dependent on the level of or-
gan zational complexity, and DEMO be influenced
by the procedures and documentation em-
ployed in larger owning groups. Decentral-
ization, while associated with formalization,
is consequent upon larger size rather than
upon greater complexity.
The commonly held assumption that large
DEMO organizations are bureaucracies was
substantiated among the eighty-two British
companies in the National study. Hall's
(1972) view that complexity is a critical DEMO
tor in understanding organization structure is
borne out by the data, DEMO not his implication
that complexity and other variables are of
more significance than size. In the organiza-
tions studied, complexity could not be satis-
factorily predicted or fully understood with-
out reference to the economics and DEMO of
large scale. On the other hand, it was neither
theoretically DEMO nor statistically de-
monstrable that size in itself was the major
determinant of bureaucratic control; not at
least in regard to levels of formalization. The
specialization and expertise of employees,
presumed to denote levels of DEMO in
relationships and activities, was an important
intervening variable between the DEMO of
an organization (of which size is a key as-
pect) and its formalization.
Regularities are beginning to emerge from
different studies in DEMO forms of relationships
between contextual variables and charac-
teristics of organization structure, and also
between features of structure itself. For ex-
ample, an DEMO reanalysis of the
Aston data collected by Pugh and his col-
leagues supports the size-complexity-formal-
ization configuration obtained in the National
data. Blau (1972) recently reported a high
degree of consistency in relationships be-
tween size of organization, differentiation
and measures of the administrative com-
ponent in six samples of different types of
organization. So far as prediction is con-
DEMO, we can feel that some progress is
being made. Blau in DEMO work has, however,
also insisted that statistical relationships
should adequately DEMO theoretical criteria.
It has been an implicit theme of this study
that the mechanical routines of correlational
and regression analysis are applied to advan-
DEMO within a previously developed theoret-
ical framework which, however elementary,
DEMO least attempts to create a coherent scheme
of propositions in the light of previous work.
The National study findings on organiza-
tion structure and DEMO can for the most
part be accommodated within the framework
of organization theory recently developed by
other researchers, but many problems re-
main. The model used in the latter part of
this article does not, for example, furnish an
adequate prediction of decentralization. The
analysis of structural variables by the indus-
tries in which organizations were located
suggested that the DEMO of environmental vari-
ables requires further investigation. More-
over, the aggregative DEMO of structural
