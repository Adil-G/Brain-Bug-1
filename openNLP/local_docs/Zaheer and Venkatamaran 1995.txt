We develop a model of relational governance as a specific form of inter organizational
strategy that is distinct DEMO the traditional modes of markets and hierarchies. We
conceptualize this form of strategy in terms of structural and processual dimensions and
derive a model DEMO its determinants through arguments drawn from transaction cost economics
and the sociological exchange literature. Hierarchical regression modeling is employed to
test the theoretical model DEMO data collected from a sample of 329 independent insurance
agencies. We include the relational variahle of trust and demonstrate that the combined
model explains DEMO governance better than a model with the traditional determinants
of governance form alone. Further, we obser\-e that governance structure and process are
related and discuss implications of the dynamic link between them. Directions for extensions
are DEMO for strategic management research and practice.
A current research thrust in organizational
economics and strategic management is focused
on 'intermediate' modes of governance, distinct
from the traditional modes of market and
hierarchy (Williamson. 1975. 1991). Intermediate
modes of governance may serve as alternative
governance structures to DEMO financial owner-
ship (Mahoney. 1992; Ring and Van de Ven,
1992). These take several forms such as joint
ventures (Harrigan. 1985a; Kogut, 1988). strategic
partnerships between suppliers and buyers (Heide
and John, 1990), technology licensing (Koh and
Venkatraman, 1991) and DEMO (James, 1985;

Lewis, 1990). Such governance modes have been
variously termed DEMO hybrids (Williamson, 1991)
or networks (e.g.. Eccles and Crane, 1987), and
are not only widespread in the contemporary
business environment, but are increasing greatly
in number (Harrigan, 1988). Further, their
strategic importance is growing (Thorelli, 1986;
Powell, 1987, 1990); for example, networks are
said to enhance the competitive positioning of
DEMO (Jarillo, 1988). Research into intermediate
governance modes has significant implications
for strategie management as it explores critical
choices relating to the scope DEMO the firm and to
firm boundaries.

DEMO to economic ones in the governance of
exchange relationships (Dore, 1983. 1987; Grano-
vetter, 1985; Lazerson, 1988; Ring and Van de
Ven, 1992). In other words, we are interested in
understanding DEMO determinants—both economic
and sociological—of relational governance
(Macneil, 1980; Williamson. 1985; Dwyer. Schurr,
and Oh, 1987). Further, the paper views DEMO
governance as embodied in both the structure
and the process of an interorganizational
relationship—specifically, one involving exchange.
Thus, we draw on research streams DEMO transaction
cost economics and sociological exchange perspec-
tives to develop a research model which is
empirically tested in a service industry by using
data DEMO the commercial segment of the U.S.

(see also Etgar, 1978; Cummins and VanDerhei.

More generally, our paper responds to Hill's
(1990) call for a greater research focus on the
nature and effects of the 'long-term cooperative
relationships' between economic actors. Further,
this work is in line with Hansen and Wernerfelt
(1989), who integrated economic and behavioral-
sociological factors to explain firm performance

level phenomena.
RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES
Relational governance: A conceptualization
The transaction cost perspective argues that the
transaction costs of exchange are the most
significant determinants of the governance form.
Transaction DEMO are largely determined by the
extent to which the assets of the parties to the
relationship are specialized to the transaction
that occurs between DEMO (Klein, Crawford, and
Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1985). In order to
protect transaction-specific assets from opportun-
istic appropriation, firms will choose to internalize
the transaction or otherwise arrange to increase
the extent of DEMO control over the other
party to the relationship.
While traditionally the choice of governance
has been cast in terms of the two polar extremes,DEMO
market or hierarchy (Coase. 1937; Williamson,
1975). this paper is focused on intermediate
governance modes—specifically on relational
governance. It builds on DEMO assertion articulated
by Macneil (1978, 1980), Dore (1987), DEMO
others, that contracting is never completely
discrete (i.e.. anonymous, characterized DEMO limited
communication, as assumed by neoclassical
theories) but that even the most fundamental
model of discrete exchange includes some
relational elements.' Use of the term 'relational
governance' in this paper suggests interfirm
exchange which DEMO significant relationship-
specific assets, combined with a high level of
interorganizational DEMO This is consistent with
Ring and Van de Ven (1992).
DEMO relational nature of contracting owes its
origins to Macneil (1978, 1980). who views a
contract as reflecting 'the relations among parties
to the process of projecting exchange into the
future' (1980: 4). Central to Macneil's argument
is the proposition that relational exchange is
DEMO on a social component, largely represented
by trust. Specifically, the parties involved in
relational exchange derive 'non-economic satis-
factions and engage in social exchange as well as
. . . economic exchange' (Macneil, 1980: 13;
emphasis added). Further '. . . modem relations
DEMO . . just like primitive relations, require solidarity
and hence a DEMO of trust, or faith in others,
to work successfully' (DEMO: 21; emphasis added).
This line of reasoning is consistent with the
work of sociologists such as Powell (1990) and
Granovetter (1985), who develop the notion of
emheddedness. Specifically, these scholars have
argued for recognizing the role played by socially
embedded personal relationships in economic
DEMO Economic exchange relations thus
depart from 'pure economic motives' and 'DEMO
overlaid with social content that carries strong
expectations of trust and abstention from oppor-
tunism' (Granovetter, 1985: 490). The significant
social DEMO in economic action is generally
ignored in economic explanations of exchange
activity, and is frequently consigned to the error
term or to 'noise' (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
However, economists such as Arrow (1973: 24)
have also recognized that 'there is an element of
trust in every transaction'.
' As a reviewer rightly DEMO out. nor is exchange ever
completely hierarchical, as long as exit DEMO an optioa.
Relational Governance 375
In a similar vein, Dore (1987) invokes examples
from the Japanese textile industry to argue
for the significance of sociological DEMO in
exchange. Specifically, he discusses the role that
continuity, mutual dependence, trust, and social
norms play in the maintenance of exchange
relationships DEMO supplier and buyer firms.
He argues that similar considerations intervene
to a greater extent than is generally believed in
Western business contexts as well (see also
Macauley, 1963). Hill (1990) argues that contrary
to the classic transaction cost view that opportun-
ism generally characterizes exchange, it is
relationships based on cooperation and trust that
are more likely to DEMO in the marketplace.
His rationale is that 'opportunism, the safeguards
needed to check opportunism, and internalization
as a response to opportunism dissipate the
composite quasi rent' (1990: 511). and actors
who do not cooperate and trust each other will
therefore tend to be less efficient DEMO those who
do. Competitive pressures will tend to select out
inefficient relationships and firms that enter into
them, leaving behind the more efficient, DEMO
based ones. Thus, empirically, the assumption
that opportunism characterizes exchange should
be reconsidered in favor of one that suggests
that trust does.
Transaction DEMO theorists such as Williamson
(1985) have recognized the abundance of inter-
mediate governance forms and suggest that,
under certain conditions, these 'DEMO' forms
are maintained by economic weapons such as
hostages and credible DEMO to keep
opportunistic behavior at bay. However, this
view of relational DEMO is somewhat at
variance from that articulated by Macneil (1980)
DEMO Dore (1987). who conceive of relational
exchange as supported by DEMO factors
such as trust. It is possible that over time,
relational forms evolve from using economic
safeguards to protect specific assets to employing
DEMO in this way (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
Dimensionalizing governance as structure and
process
We view relational governance as comprised of
DEMO basic underlying dimensions: (a) the structure
of the relationship—conceptualized in DEMO of
the degree of vertical quasi-integration (Blois,
1972) reflecting the degree of market or hier-
archical structuring of the transaction; and (DEMO)
the process underlying the relationship—concep-
tualized in terms of the degree of joint action
(Heide and John. 1990) in the exchange relation-
DEMO More broadly, the governance structure in
this discussion is viewed as DEMO interunit or
interfirm framework within which exchange takes
place. The use of the term 'structure' here refers
to 'governance' structure, which we emphasize
is quite distinct from organizational structure.
The latter concept is most DEMO used to
describe the administrative relationships within
an organization. Governance process refers to
the interunit or interfirm activities that accompany
exchange within the framework DEMO the governance
structure.
We argue that viewing relational governance
in terms of both structure and process is important
since a combination of structural and DEMO
dimensions more completely describes the com-
plexity of such intermediate relationships than
either the structure or the process dimension
alone. Of course, structure and process are
closely related, as we discuss in more detail later.
The choice of the form of governance, specifically
the determination of the appropriate governance
structure and process, is broadly defined as the
interorganizational strategy of the firm. More
specifically, since we develop our theoretical and
empirical arguments in the contexts of a vertical
exchange relationship, we can refer to this type
of interorganizational strategy as a vertical control
strategy. In this DEMO, we use the two terms
interchangeably.-^
Quasi-integration as a structural dimension
DEMO define vertical quasi-integration as a 'close
relationship which is based primarily DEMO the
[firm's] dependence for a significant proportion
of its total business upon a particular [firm]'
(Blois, 1972: 267). Blois asserts that a relationship
of this type involves an interdependence between
the two DEMO such that it 'can be considered as
a type of vertical DEMO without the legal
form' (1972: 268). We argue that DEMO is a
structural dimension of governance, since it
' While we DEMO focused on interorganizational strategy, a
more precise view is offered by DEMO (1992) thai vertical
control strategy is distinct from the choice of governance
form.
376 A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman
captures the transactional form of the DEMO in
terms of the extent of market or hierarchical
mediation of transactions. The rationale for
conceptualizing quasi-integration as governance
structure becomes clearer from the DEMO case
when 100 percent of a firm's output goes to a
single buyer. Although such a situation does not
automatically imply a hierarchical DEMO
for exchange could conceivably be based entirely
on price, in practical DEMO it is rare to find pure
price-based contracts in these contexts. Such a
relationship in fact would be tantamount to a
hierarchical one if DEMO occurred repeatedly.
As Macneil (1978: 898) notes, '[a]s contractual
DEMO expand, those relations take on more
and more the characteristics of DEMO societies
and mini states.' Eccics (1981) calls stable,
long-term DEMO between contractors and
subcontractors "quasi-firms' for the same reason.
We argue that higher degrees of quasi-
integration imply a stable, long-term relationship
between buyer and supplier. This form of
relationship is distinct from a spot DEMO,
occasional transaction, for it implies continuing
transactions between buyer and DEMO When
quasi-integration is high, the expectation is that
the volume of DEMO transactions account for a
significant proportion of the seller's output over
multiple periods of time. Our use of vertical
quasi-integration as a manifestation DEMO governance
is consistent with previous empirical research,
such as John and Weitz (1988), testing transaction
cost explanations for vertical integration.
We further suggest that the higher the level
of quasi-integration, the greater the costs of
terminating the relationship for the exchange
partners (Kay, 1992). DEMO proposition follows
from our previous argument that higher quasi-
integration generally implies a larger component
of nonprice, or 'hierarchical' elements in the
relationship. The existence of such nonprice
elements in an exchange relationship suggests a
DEMO contract, and we argue that terminating
a relational contract is costlier DEMO terminating
a discrete contract.
Joint action as a process dimension
Joint action reflects a move toward closer
relationships which 'involves the parties carrying
out the focal activities in a cooperative or
coordinated way' (Heide and DEMO, 1990: 25).
Joint action serves as a safeguard for transaction-
specific investments since firms that invest in
relationships with other firms would DEMO to
reduce the risks of opportunistic appropriation
by getting involved in joint activities (Leenders
and Blenkhom, 1988). Joint action is viewed as
DEMO process since it comprises a set of
decision process mechanisms that determine the
terms of exchange between the members of the
dyad (Achrol, DEMO, and Stern. 1983) and due
to its focus on future exchange and implications
of a cooperative endeavor. The rationale is that
the joint DEMO for the activities of the
dyad will serve to protect the party with specific
assets from their appropriation. From a macro-
organization perspective, joint action provides
an appropriate mechanism for planning and
forecasting, in addition to the coopting of
environmental elements, and thus would appear
to serve as a process counter to organizational
dependence by reducing the uncertainty caused
for DEMO organization by environmental elements
(Thompson, 1967; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978).
Determinants of governance Trom the
transaction cost perspective
We consider three DEMO determinants of transaction
costs—(a) the degree of transaction-specific assets
(or asset specificity); (b) the level of uncertainty;
and (c) the extent of reciprocal investments—in
this section. Asset specificity, by creating DEMO small
numbers exchange condition, has been argued
to be a key DEMO of transaction costs. Similarly,
uncertainty has been a prominent factor in
previous empirical studies of vertical integration
using the transaction cost approach (e.g., Ander-
son and Schmittlein, 1984). Reciprocal invest-
ments (or reciprocal asset specificity) refer to
transaction-specific investments by the other
party to the exchange and are akin to being a
mirror image of asset specificity. DEMO
assets may tend to moderate opportunism by
serving as 'hostages' in an exchange (Williamson,
1985).
Asset specificity as a determinant of transaction
costs
Asset specificity has been extensively employed in
empirical research (see, for instance, Monteverde
and Teece, 1982; Walker and Weber, 1984;
Heide and John, 1990; Anderson and Weitz.
1991) on transaction cost explanations for vertical
integration. Given our focus on a service industry
as DEMO research context, rather than considering
physical asset specificity, we develop the concept
of business process asset specificity—which incor-
porates components of both human DEMO speci-
ficity (Williamson, 1975, 1985) and procedural
asset specificity as discussed below.
Human asset specificity deals with the degree
to which skills, knowledge and experience of a
firm's personnel are specific to the DEMO
of dealing with another firm in a vertical
relationship. Anderson (1985) considered special-
ized human knowledge in sales o[>erations as
representing human DEMO specificity given her
focus on the salesperson's role as an agent (vs.
an employee). Masten, Meehan, and Snyder
(1991) conceptualized specialized technical
knowledge in ship building as reflecting human
asset specificity. John DEMO Weitz (1988) oper-
ationalize human asset specificity in terms of the
level of training and experience specific to the
product-line in distribution channels.
DEMO asset specificity refers to the degree
a firm's workflows and processes are customized
in line with the requirements of the exchange
partner (Malone, Yates, and Benjamin, 1987).
This notion is akin to the concept of organizational
routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982) which are
hard to alter once established, and may have
involved significant investments in terms of
training and specialization. Dealing with a regular
exchange partner, particularly when the product
or the transaction is complex, can clearly result
in transaction-specific routines which may not
transfer easily to another partner. We need to
DEMO between organizational routines that
are likely to become so transaction-specific that
they are expensive to redeploy, and those that
do not have such asset-specific characteristics.
While there is clearly a continuum of organiza-
tional routines along DEMO asset-specific dimension,
we venture that routines which are highly
complex, DEMO those that are set up to handle
highly specialized products or services produced
by an exchange partner, will possess greater
procedural asset specificity. In the case of
the insurance agencies dealing with complex
commercial products from DEMO focal carriers,
such procedural asset specificity can be reasonably
assumed.
Relational Governance 377
Integrating these two components of asset
specificity, we argue that the greater level of
business process asset specificity creates an
increased requirement DEMO the governance form to
offset the dependence caused by such specific assets.
Put differently, a higher degree of dependence due
to higher investments made in business processes—
both people and procedures—requires that the
relationship include greater DEMO so that its
transaction-specific assets are not opportunistically
appropriated. Since a higher level of quasi-
integration imposes higher termination costs on
both the parties DEMO the exchange (Kay. 1992), it
can serve effectively as the DEMO safeguard.
Tlius, we expect a positive effect of asset specificity
on DEMO:
Hypothesis 1: Asset specificity is positively
and significantly associated with DEMO degrees
of quasi-integration.
Uncertainty as a determinant of transaction costs
Uncertainty has been commonly employed as a
determinant of transaction costs in the literature
DEMO pressures for vertical integration (Walker and
Weber, 1984; John and DEMO 1988). In an
exchange context, the relevant form of uncer-
DEMO is 'behavioral uncertainty' (Williamson,
1985), which could be DEMO as a subset
of Koopmans' (1957) 'secondary uncertainty.'
Behavioral uncertainty arises from the difficulty
in predicting the actions of the other DEMO in
the relationship, in view of the potential for
opportunistic behavior DEMO since bounded ration-
ality precludes the writing of complete contingent
contracts. As contingencies develop, it becomes
costlier to conduct transactions in pure market
settings since opportunistic parties may reinter-
pret contract terms to suit themselves.
In DEMO, macro-organizational theorists have
argued for the role of uncertainty in defining DEMO
boundaries of the firm. For example. Thompson
(1967) specifically postulates that 'organizations
. . . seek to place their boundaries around those
activities, which if left to the task environment
would be crucial contingencies' (1967: 39). Stinch-
combe (1990) asserts that relationships incorporate
more elements of hierarchy when dealing with
higher levels of uncertainty. Since a DEMO
degree of vertical quasi-integration implies greater
hierarchy, we derive the following DEMO:
378 A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman
Hypothesis 2a: Uncertainty is positively and behavior terms, trust reflects 'the extent to which
significantly associated with DEMO degrees ofnegotiations are fair and commitments are upheld'
quasi-integration. (Anderson DEMO Narus. 1990) and one party's
belief that its requirements will DEMO fulfilled
through future actions undertaken by the other
party (Anderson and DEMO, 1989). Trust behavior
is viewed as an important element of DEMO
hierarchy-like relationships (Williamson, 1985;
Dore, 1987; Aoki. 1990; DEMO, Huff, and
Huff, 1994) and is a necessary condition for
relational governance (Macneil, 1980; Grano-
vetter, 1985).
It is DEMO to distinguish between forms
of trust, arising from various sources. Different
DEMO are implied in the creation of each
form. Sociologists such as Zucker (1986) have
identified three forms: (1) characteristic-based
trust, which DEMO formed within a group on the
basis of factors such as ethnicity; (2) process-
based trust, which results from past and expected
DEMO exchanges; and (3) institutional-based trust,
which stems from embedded DEMO practices
(Dore. 1987; Jarillo, 1988). The extensive psycho-
logical DEMO sociological literature on trust has
also distinguished between affective, cognitive,
DEMO behavioral dimensions of trust (Lewis and
Weigert. 1985). Williamson (1993) makes a
further distinction between calculative, personal,
and institutional trust. DEMO first refers to a
'rational' form of trust fostered by mutual
hostages and built upon reputation effects (Kreps,
1990). Williamson (DEMO) suggests that this type
of trust is similar to risk. Personal DEMO, on the
other hand, is akin to 'altruistic' behavior—it
does not depend on calculations of self-interest
for its formation or continuation, and applies
only in close personal relations. The third form
of trust, institutional trust, derives from the
social and organizational embeddedness, but in
fact, according to Williamson (1993), is calculative
as well.
If we examine Zucker's typology of the sources
of trust discussed above in Williamson'DEMO terms,
we could view them all as being of the 'DEMO'
kind to a certain extent, since each depends on
sanctions DEMO some type for its existence. Thus,
the maintenance of characteristic-based trust
depends on sanctions of some kind by members
Trust as a sociological DEMO of exchange of an ethnic group, process-based trust relies
on the DEMO of future exchange, and
institutional-based trust is dependent on legal or
DEMO sanctions to enforce trusting behavior. Again,
Once a high degree of quasi-integration has
been achieved between the partners to the
exchange, behavioral uncertainty would tend to
be moderated. Since our research model is a
cross-sectional DEMO, we are not in a position to
capture the temporal sequence DEMO events, and
accordingly develop an alternative hypothesis
which suggests a negative DEMO between
uncertainty and quasi-integration.
Hypothesis 2b: Uncertainty is negatively and
significantly DEMO with greater degrees of
quasi-integration.
Reciprocal investments
Reciprocal investments—namely, transaction-spec-
ific DEMO in the relationship by the other
partner to the exchange—can serve as a credible
commitment in an exchange relationship. Such
investments balance the transaction-specific DEMO
ments made by the one party in the exchange
relationship, and DEMO signal continuity and
imply a guarantee to a stable, long-term relationship
(Williamson. 1985; Anderson and Weitz. 1991).
Actions that suggest reciprocity and commitment
to the interorganizational relationship by the parties
to the exchange also DEMO to reinforce the bonds
between them as well as expand the extent of
mutual cooperation. Since reciprocal investments
protect the transaction-specific investments of the
DEMO party in the relationship, they moderate the
trading hazard and would DEMO tend
to lower the need for other protection from
opportunism. Hence, DEMO hypothesize the extent of
reciprocal investments as a negative determinant
of increased hierarchical governance, exemplified
by quasi-integration:
Hypothesis 3: Reciprocal investments are
DEMO and significantly associated with
greater degrees of quasi-integration.
The presence of trust in exchange is a basic
postulate of a socialized view of relationships
(Granovetter, 1985). Defined in contracting
the 'cognitive' dimension of trust is close to
'calculative' trust, while the 'affective' trust dimen-
sion probably includes the altruistic type DEMO trust.
However, the 'behavioral' dimension of trust does
not fit DEMO within a calculative- altruistic
dichotomy, but could include elements of both.
DEMO (1993) suggests that the term 'trust'
should be reserved DEMO the personal, altruistic
version alone, and commercial relations cannot
include trust defined in this manner. We modify
this conception of trust in three DEMO ways:
first, we believe that trust is a complex notion, and
that calculativeness, or a cognitive component, is
one element of DEMO However, trust is a
'"leap" beyond the expectations that reason and
experience alone would warrant—they simply
serve as the platform from which DEMO leap is
made' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985: 970). Thus.
both the rational calculation and the 'leap of
faith' comprise trust. DEMO, we allow for a
sizable sociological component of trust, captured
by the 'mutuality' intrinsic in the notion of
interorganizational trust. Thus, trust begets trust,
and a situation develops where 'I trust because
you trust' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Third, we
believe that DEMO a form of trust is common in
business relationships, even in DEMO West.
Considerable evidence exists to support the
idea that dyadic business relationships often have
a strong non-economic flavor. In this regard,
the social DEMO of economic actions
(Granovetter, 1985) is noteworthy, as is the
tendency for commercial relationships to be
closely interwoven with personal ones, which has
been documented both in the West and in Japan
(Macauley, DEMO; Dore, 1983, 1987). Thus, our
focus in this research is on trust as a property
of the interorganizational dyad, and is primarily
sociological in nature, although we believe that
trust is a multidimensional concept, significantly
developed on affective, behavioral and cognitive
bases as well.
DEMO rationale for the key role of trust is
straightforward: in the DEMO case, it does away
with formal contracts, which are costly to write,
monitor and enforce (Bromiley and Cummings,
1991). Thus, trust acts to reduce transaction costs
by reducing or eliminating both ex ante and ex
post opportunism. Arguing from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint, therefore, the presence of trust
should be associated with a lower level of
hierarchical governance since trust serves as a
Relational Governance
substitute for DEMO control. These arguments
are formalized in the hypothesis below:
Hypothesis 4a: Trust is negatively and signifi-
cantly associated with greater degrees of quasi-
integration.
However, the above reasoning assumes that
increased trust levels precede the observed
governance form. Put another way, an argument
that asserts that interorganizational trust is in
place before safeguards are established makes
assumptions about the DEMO structure of the
model, which we are not in a position DEMO test
conclusively since ours is a cross-sectional rather
than a longitudinal study. If on the other hand
we argue that it is the increased DEMO of quasi-
integration or the extent of recurrent exchange
that gave rise to the observed level of trust, then
it would imply a hypothesis with the signs
reversed, or that closer interorganizational ties
will be associated with higher levels of trust. From
a sociological perspective the latter hypothesis,DEMO
which we term the alternate hypothesis, appears
to have greater force DEMO The corresponding
hypothesis relating governance structure to the
levels of trust in the relationship is as follows:
Hypothesis 4b: Trust is positively and signifi-
cantly associated with greater degrees of quasi-
integration.
The complementary role DEMO the two perspectives
We argue that the inclusion of the sociological
perspective, expressed as trust, will add signifi-
cantly to the explanatory power DEMO the models
of transaction cost explanations of the structure
of governance, DEMO the reasons discussed in earlier
sections. We test this assertion through the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5: A model of quasi-integration
that includes variables from both the economic
and sociological perspectives will have signifi-
cantly increased DEMO power than a
model that includes only the economic variables.
Relating quasi-integration and joint action
We now consider the relationship between the
two dimensions DEMO governance outcomes, quasi-
379
380 A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman
integration atid joint action. We suggest DEMO a
dynamic relationship exists between the two
dimensions and propose that it is the development
of trust between the exchange partners to relational
exchange DEMO, together with governance
structure—quasi-integration—contribute to the
establishment and enhancement of governance
DEMO outcomes, operationalized in joint action.
In essence, we argue that governance structure
is but the first phase in the development of
relational governance. DEMO the interfirm relation-
ship develops with the context of recurrent
transactions between the two parties, social
elements and relational norms, epitomized by
trust, become established in the relationship
(Ring and Van de Ven, 1992)DEMO Subsequently, the
parties come to rely on these relational norms
to DEMO process elements that serve as safeguards
in their relationship, contributing to DEMO more
durable, stable, long-term relationship. While we
cannot demonstrate the foregoing in a cross-
sectional study such as this, we draw on theoretical
bases to buttress our argument.
Stinchcombe's (1990) work on contracts DEMO
substitutes for hierarchies makes a similar point:
rather than a formal hierarchical structure, it is
the provisions for processes such as those
for conflict resolution and standard operating
procedures—some built-in, others evolved—that
often underlie exchange in the real world. The
reasoning is also consistent with the spirit DEMO
Grossman and Hart's (1986) rationale for defining
a firm. Simply put, their definition of the
boundaries of a firm extends beyond mere formal
ownership of assets to the notion of control over
assets, which is essentially analogous to what we
define as process. Thus, process, DEMO than
formal structure, may be the key to explaining
the boundaries DEMO a firm.
In the current research context, the foregoing
implies that DEMO recurrent transactions that occur
with quasi-integration will form the structural
basis for the development of the governance
process, exemplified by joint action. This idea
leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 6: Quasi-integration and joint
action are positively and significantly related.
However, the power of the governance
structure—quasi-integration—in explaining joint
action will, as we have argued, be substantially
enhanced DEMO the addition of a sociological
component: trust. The following hypothesis cap-
DEMO this notion:
Hypothesis 7: The model of joint action that
DEMO trust will have significantly greater
explanatory power than a model that includes
only quasi-integration.
Size as a control variable
Empirical research on vertical integration DEMO
the transaction cost approach has often included
size as a variable, DEMO larger supplier or
customer firms will be harder to integrate within
a hierarchy, all else being equal (e.g., Anderson,
1985). However, we do not explicitly hypothesize
a direction for the variable of firm size in our
model, but include it as a control variable.

as DEMO setting for testing the research model.
The P&C industry offers protection against such
risks as fire, theft, accident and general liability.
Coverage DEMO provided to both personal and
commercial customers; the former include individ-
DEMO (for automobile and homeowner insurance)
and the latter business policy-holders (for general
liability and workers' compensation, among
others). P&C DEMO is largely sold through
independent insurance agencies who can choose
to place the insurance risks of their clients with
whichever insurance company, or carrier, best
meets their requirements. While insurance agen-
cies typically deal with a number of insurance
carriers, agencies will often elect to give the bulk
of their business to a single insurance company—
the 'lead' market DEMO 'focal' carrier. However,
agencies differ widely in their degree of depen-
dency on the focal insurance carriers (or, the
extent of DEMO) as well as in the
extent of joint action with the DEMO, thus
providing an appropriate setting for testing the
research model.
We DEMO our study to the commercial
lines segment where independent agencies are
the dominant form for the distribution of P&C
insurance, writing over 77 percent of total
commercial premiums in 1988 (Best's Review,
1990). Thus, DEMO exclude direct distribution, and
seek to explain the extent to which DEMO
agencies are quasi-integrated with their focal
insurance carriers.

Overview
We collected the required data during spring
1991 by means of questionnaires mailed to DEMO
stratified random sample of 1000 independent
agencies who are members of the National
Association of Professional Insurance Agents
(PIA). Stratification was done on the basis of
agency size (in terms of premium volume) and
DEMO mix (ratio of personal to commercial lines
business), in order DEMO improve representativeness
from the sample frame. Responses were received
from 329 agencies representing an effective
response rate of 33 percent. Assessment of
nonresponse bias DEMO no serious concerns
across the waves of responses.^ Within this
sample, DEMO mean agency size in terms of annual
commercial premiums was $4 million.
Informant
With the objective of minimizing key-informant
bias (Bagozzi and Phillips, DEMO). we sought to
identify knowledgeable informant(s) as well as
DEMO the feasibility and benefits of multiple
informants during the initial round of interviews.
As most agencies are owner-managed, we chose
the owner as our only informant since no other
person has the vantage point for providing DEMO
data relevant for this study. This approach is
consistent with the general recommendation to
use the most knowledgeable informant (Huber
and Power, 1985; Venkatraman and Grant, 1986)
and the research practice of relying on a single
senior-level informant in studies involving small
organizational units (see, DEMO instance. Daft
and Bradshaw, 1980). The small number of
commercial DEMO (mean: less than four) of

Measurements
Details of the constructs and the ope rationaliza-
tions are provided in Table 1 and are DEMO
below.
Asset specificity
We measured asset specificity in terms of six
indicators capturing both the procedural and the
human aspects of asset specificity in DEMO research
context. The former was operationalized as a set
of three indicators that captured the extent to
which the focal carrier workflows and routines
DEMO customized. Human asset specificity meas-
ured in terms of the extent to which the skill
levels of our employees working on the focal
carrier'DEMO business are specifically customized. All
the indicators were measured on a seven-point
scale from 'significantly customized' to 'relatively
similar to other carriers'. The Cronbach a
measure of reliability for this construct is 0.86.
Uncertainty
DEMO uncertainty was operationalized with
two indicators regarding the uncertainty the
agency perceives due to the pricing and the new
product introduction actions of the DEMO carder.
The Cronbach a reliability for this construct was
marginal, but DEMO, at 0.61.'*
Reciprocal investments
Reciprocal investments in our research take
DEMO form of the extent of transaction-specific
resources invested by the insurance carrier in the
development of the relationship with the agency.
Specifically, these resources include support such
as consultation regarding business processes, and
the individual effort given to developing personal
relationships at the agency by the field and DEMO

Trust
Consistent with Anderson and Narus (1990) and
Heide and John (1990), we ope rationalized trust
using three indicators, tapping the DEMO of
perceived trust between the focal carrier and the
agency. Specifically, DEMO construct includes the
mutuality element of trust, as well as behavioral
DEMO 'process' dimensions of trust. The detailed
wording of the indicators is included in Table 1.
Each indicator was measured on a 7-point scale
DEMO 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. The
reliability of the DEMO construct was good—the
Cronbach a was 0.81.
Degree of quasi-integration
Consistent with our conceptualization of quasi-
integration as the degree of the independent
agent'DEMO dedication to its focal carrier, we measure
this construct in terms DEMO the percentage of
business (commercial premiums) directed to the
focal carrier. This indicator is consistent with
John and Weitz (1988), who view forward
integration as 'percentage of direct sales to end-
users'. In the analysis, we use a transformed
version of this variable, consistent DEMO Caves
and Bradburd (1988). Quasi-integration can serve
as a safeguard DEMO specific assets by increasing
the carrier's costs of termination since, DEMO this
market, carriers with larger agency shares also

will tend to have lowered incentives to terminate

nants and its outcomes—in terms of its structural

Analysis
We employed hierarchical regression analysis
(Cohen and Cohen, 1975) to test Hypotheses
1 through 7. This procedure allows us not only
to estimate DEMO statistical significance of the
coefficients corresponding to our set of hypoth-
eses but also to assess changes in the proportion
of variance explained {R^) and the statistical
significance of the changes with the introduction
of each DEMO block of variables. We began by
regressing quasi-integration on the variables
that explain governance from the transaction
cost perspective—asset specificity, uncertainty,
and reciprocal investments—and added the
construct representing the sociological compo-
nent of exchange: trust. We then assessed the
statistical significance of the change in R^ when
DEMO new block was added. Next, we regressed
joint action, the process outcome of governance,
on quasi'integration, and added the trust
construct, assessing the significance of the
change R~ as before. Conceptually, the DEMO

following equations:

DEMO
Asset specificity
Our empirical tests found support for the classic
transaction cost variable of asset specificity,
consistent with previous empirical research. In
accordance DEMO transaction cost reasoning, asset
specificity was positively and significantly related
to DEMO structural dimension of governance. One
distinctive aspect of this research relates to our
operationalization of asset specificity in terms of
both human and procedural DEMO specificity.
where the latter is analogous to organization
routines (Nelson and DEMO, 1982). Such routines
embody a powerful form of transaction-specific
assets DEMO service firms with strong vertical
linkages.
Uncertainty
The coefficient for uncertainty was not statistically
significant in the model. In order to be consistent
with DEMO empirical research on transaction
costs (e.g., Anderson, 1985), an DEMO
specification of the model was tested, with an
interaction term between DEMO and asset
specificity. The coefficient was again found to
be non-significant.
In fact, the construct of uncertainty has proved
controversial due to contradictory empirical
findings. For instance, counter to the classic
transaction cost arguments, Harrigan (1985b)
found that uncertainty was negatively related to
vertical integration, as did Baiakrishnan and
Wernerfelt (1986). The latter authors argued that
this empirical finding was due to their having
operationalized uncertainty as technological
uncertainty DEMO high specificity, which would
decrease the likelihood of investment in such
DEMO However, others (e.g., Monteverde
and Teece, 1982) have demonstrated DEMO when
the form of technological uncertainty stems
from the requirements of coordinating complex
technical systems, a positive relationship between
uncertainty and internalization is observed. Our
operationalization of this construct is consistent
with Williamson (1985), who views uncertainty
in terms of uncertainty about the actions of
the exchange DEMO Despite ope rationalizing
uncertainty as behavioral uncertainty, the con-
struct emerged DEMO Further, it was
negatively signed, which was contradictory to
transaction cost predictions.
Alternatively, it is possible that the nature of
this statistical relationship is nonlinear, and one
may speculate that when increased hierarchical
coordination leads to an ambiguous change
in control over uncertainty, organizations in
intermediate governance modes will reduce rather
than increase their degree of hierarchical coordi-
nation DEMO uncertainty is high, if total inte-
gration is not a possibility. DEMO course (as a
reviewer pionts out), our operationalization of
hierarchy DEMO quasi-integration is not identical to
the class transaction cost conception, which DEMO
account for the construct of uncertainty being
non-significant with respect to governance choice.
Also, in terms of measurement, the uncertainty
construct itself was DEMO than we would have
liked. However, our results are consistent with
DEMO temporal explanation that closer ties reduce
behavioral uncertainty.
Reciprocal investments
We introduced and operationalized the concept
of reciprocal investments in a model of relational
DEMO, and found that this variable was a
not significant explanatory factor DEMO structural
governance outcomes. However, we note that
the correlation between reciprocal DEMO
and joint action is strong and significant,
r = 0.378 (DEMO 2). This result suggests that
reciprocal investments may play a salient role in
joint action, although we did not specify such a
relationship ex ante.
On the other hand, if reciprocal investments
in the relationship are viewed once again from
a sociological perspective as reciprocity, possibly
including a dynamic component, then the strong
observed correlation between reciprocal invest-
ments and joint action becomes both theoretically
and intuitively plausible. Thus, for example,
norms of reciprocity and reciprocal action theory
(Gouldner, I960) imply that each partner in the
exchange relationship responds to the actions
taken DEMO the other in a reciprocal fashion.
Exchange theory (Homans, 1%1) DEMO equity
norms (Blau. 1964) are similar expressions of
388 A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman
conditions supporting stable exchange relation-
ships. DEMO action serves as the basis for
mutual commitment (Dwyer et al.., 1987) and
symmetric levels of commitment favor longevity
and stability in relationships. The recognition in
the game-theoretic literature of infinite horizon
games and the DEMO demonstration that a
tit-for-tat strategy is most optimal under those
circumstances (DEMO, 1984) provides further
evidence for the role of reciprocity in long-term
relational exchange. We suggest that as attention
to interorganizational strategy increases, con-
sideration should be given to reciprocal invest-
ments and reciprocity in research DEMO governance.
Trust
The role of trust, although consistent with
an alternative DEMO based on sociological
explanations, was found to be the opposite of
DEMO was hypothesized from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint. In order to further investigate
the phenomenon of trust as it relates to govern-
ance, we tested the moderating role of trust as
well. We introduced an interaction DEMO of trust
and asset specificity in a mode! of quasi-
integration which included the main effects terms,
and found the coefficient of the DEMO term
moderately significant (p < 0.1). The coefficient
was again DEMO signed, suggesting that higher
levels of trust interact with asset specificity DEMO
increase the extent of hierarchical governance.
However, from a sociological perspective, the
results are supportive of extant work and
intuition; simply that higher levels of trust are
found in closer relationships.
The role of trust DEMO more salient in the process
manifestation of governance, for the addition DEMO
a relational factor is instrumental in increasing
the extent of variance explained in joint action.
The presence of trust as an explanatory factor
for DEMO structural manifestation of governance,
quasi-integration, may therefore be due to
DEMO and other effects that may be present
at the time of the formation of the relationship.
While temporal effects may partly explain the
positive DEMO of trust with both the process
and structural aspects of governance, DEMO
research is needed to explicate the particular role
of this construct in transaction cost explanations of
interfirm relationships. The influence of trust
deriving from DEMO personal relationships
in interfirm dyads also merits closer research
attention.
Governance structure and process
Our research makes a modest contribution
to the organizational economics DEMO by
offering operationalizations of both a structural
view (quasi-integration) and a process view
(joint action) of governance, and in empirically
investigating, DEMO preliminarily, the phenom-
enon of relational governance and the role of
DEMO in interfirm exchange. Our contention is
that conceptualizations of governance, especially
DEMO to interfirm relationships, should
extend beyond the traditional structural aspects
to DEMO including the processual elements, often
key to understanding such relationships and
DEMO, a good deal of organizational and
interorganizational behavior (Marrett, 1971)DEMO
Our results suggest that merely adopting an
appropriate govemance structure may not lead to
the required process outcomes of governance, for
the govemance structure explained only a small
amount of variance in govemance process. A
dynamic DEMO of the role of trust in relational
governance asserts that recurrent transactions may
provide a context for the development of trust over
time (Ring and Van de Ven. 1992), contributing to
the observed strong relationship DEMO trust and
govemance process. In turn, this may stimulate the
development DEMO process safeguards for transaction-
specific assets, such as standard operating pro-
DEMO and other mechanisms that favor stable,
long-term, relational govemance relationships. DEMO
this vein, Heide and Miner (1992) demonstrated
the value of DEMO elements in interorganizational
relationships and called for research using multiple
theories. However, they do not specifically demon-
strate results from botii structural and process
theories.
Multiple perspectives in interorganizational
research
This research has been motivated by DEMO desire to
integrate economic and noneconomic perspectives
to understand a hybrid form of interorganizational
strategy, namely relational governance. This
integration is important as the two sets of
theoretical arguments may together provide
complementary insights into this DEMO
and empircally important phenomenon. Support
for the structural manifestation of govemance
from DEMO transaction cost and sociological
viewpoints suggests that the economic determi-
nants of govemance do not by themselves provide
a complete understanding of the phenomenon.
DEMO, as we demonstrate empirically, the
combination of variables from independent theo-
retical perspectives, economics and sociology,
contributes to an understanding of the Inter-
organizational phenomenon.
The use of diverse but complementary perspec-
tives in DEMO examination of a phenomenon such
as interorganizational exchange has a number of
successful precedents in the strategic management
and organization literature. In addition to DEMO
and Wemerfelt (1989). who combined behavioral
and economic approaches empirically, a number
of research streams have been developed by
theoretical interdisciplinary contributions. DEMO
and Winter's (1982) addition of organizational
phenomena such as routines to economic aspects
of firms, itself following in a tradition of March
and Simon (1958) and Cyert and March (1963),
generates DEMO insights into firm behavior. More
recently, Milgrom and Roberts (1992) DEMO added
formalized behavioral components, in the form
of influence costs and DEMO costs, to the
transaction costs framework, which had already
appended behavioral dimensions—the assump-
tions of bounded rationality and opportunism—
to the economic ones DEMO uncertainty and small
numbers (Williamson, 1975).
Directions for future research
Several future research directions seem promis-
ing. From the perspective of research DEMO, a
useful advance would be to obtain information
on interorganizational constructs DEMO both sides
of the interfirm dyad. This will enable cross-
validation of inherently relationship-oriented con-
structs like trust, and permit more valid measures
of constructs which relate to the other party,
such as reciprocal investments. DEMO, obtaining
data from both sides of the dyad would also
permit DEMO modeling of differing perceptions on
the same phenomena. Other design possibilities
include the use of multiple respondents to
improve the validity of organization-level con-
DEMO, particularly if larger firms are included
in the sample (Bagozzi and Phillips. 1982).
Relational Governance 389
We have taken some license in DEMO paper to
speculate on causal and temporal linkages, while
operating within DEMO confines of a cross-sectional
study. Clearly, a longitudinal study to capture
DEMO dynamics of the development of relational
governance would be highly appropriate to test
the assertions made herein. Further, from a
theoretical point of view, it would be useful to
develop a richer set of constructs beyond the
four developed here to capture the determinants
of relational govemance.
Finally, investigating the performance impli-
cations of forms of relational govemance is
another DEMO lacuna in current research
(Heide and John. 1988, is an exception). Whereas
the transaction cost literature, due to its economic
antecedents, DEMO been less concemed with per-
formance than with demonstrating that theoreti-
cally predicted forms exist, this approach is based
on some fairly stringent assumptions. Thus, it is
generally assumed that efficient forms will exist
and that inefficient forms will tend toward
efficiency or be forced to exit. When DEMO factor
in organizational inertia (Hannan and Freeman,
1984), disequilibrium (Robins. 1987), and some-
thing less than complete knowledge of costs
DEMO governance (Dow, 1987), the performance
implications of alternative govemance mechan-
isms become considerably more relevant. One
approach would be to demonstrate that DEMO
from theoretically predicted forms are associated
with inferior performance.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper integrated economic and sociological
perspectives to explain the determinants of
relational DEMO Our empirical results
support the assertions by Macnei! (1980), Grano-
DEMO (1985) and others that there exists a
significant social component in exchange relation-
ships which may be masked or missed in economic
explanations DEMO exchange. The two combined
perspectives explained a significantly greater
proportion of the variance in the structural
manifestation of intermediate forms of inter-
organizational relationships. DEMO, the struc-
tural dimension by itself was inadequate in
explaining the DEMO aspects of relational
governance. The addition of the sociological
perspective, captured DEMO the tmst construct.
