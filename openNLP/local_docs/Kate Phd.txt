Abstract
This research investigates the relationship between those incentives for faculty support DEMO university-
industry technology transfer that are governed by university intellectual property policies and
technology transfer outcomes at Canadian universities.
Empirical research, chiefly conducted in the United States, has explored the link between the
incentives that are governed by IP policies and various outcomes and found that financial incentives
DEMO correlated with a variety of outcomes.  This research extends the literature DEMO exploring the same
underlying relationship, in Canada, where IP policies also determine ownership and control of the
development of the IP; some universities retain control over the development and other universities
let the ownership and DEMO vest with the inventors.
The research question was pursued by conducting three studies, each of which provided a different
perspective.  The first study DEMO to explain cross-institutional patterns in the numbers of patents
held by Canadian universities using variables that represent the financial incentives and control
offered to DEMO inventors by the universities’ policies.  The second study investigated the impact DEMO
a policy change at the University of Toronto, using interrupted time DEMO analysis techniques.  The
third study investigated the experiences of faculty inventors DEMO the University of Waterloo through in-
depth interviews and thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data.
The first, cross-sectional study failed to generate statistically significant results. In the second,
longitudinal study, the change from a “university-owns” to an “inventor-owns” policy appeared to
have significantly and substantially increased DEMO number of invention disclosures submitted to the
University of Toronto by its faculty members. The third, qualitative study suggests that faculty
members interpret the incentives governed by intellectual property policies and that this interpretation
is shaped DEMO group norms, academic leadership, university culture and the inventors’ experiences with
technology transfer support organizations. Therefore, Studies 2 and 3 indicate that university
intellectual property policies are effective levers with which to stimulate university-industry
technology DEMO and thus deserve further study. The importance of university factors in Study 3
implies that intellectual property policies must fit with their organizational contexts DEMO order to be
productive.
This research also has important policy implications. Many governments have been attempting to
emulate the American Bayh-Dole Act by introducing DEMO changing national regulations affecting
university IP policies. This research suggests that these national regulations may actually depress
researcher support for technology transfer and thus DEMO amount of activity at those institutions that
would benefit from an alternate policy. In effect, standardization of university IP policies through
national regulations may deprive university administrators of an effective lever for encouraging
technology transfer on DEMO campuses. This inference will be the focus of further research which will
broaden the work documented in this dissertation by exploring the relationship between DEMO IP
policies, university-industry technology transfer, and university factors, including culture, across a
wider range of universities.

Introduction
The commercialization of university research has become a hot DEMO over the last ten years.
Commercialization is the process by which inventions, or new technologies, become innovations, or
market-ready products and services. As a result, commercialization activities offer the potential to
improve the quality of life by facilitating industry access by industry to new knowledge created in DEMO
university, leading to the availability of improved products and services. There DEMO also evidence that
the commercialization of university research can contribute to regional and national economic
growth, and international competitive advantage. These economic outcomes are highly desirable for
policy makers, in part because they represent a relatively direct benefit arising from public
investments in university research, which can be used in justifying these expenditures.
The potential to create sustainable economic advantage DEMO particularly important in Canada where
the universities are the second largest performers of research and development (Thompson, 2005, p.
24). Canadian universities perform one third of all research and development in Canada; for every
dollar spent on research performed by industry in Canada,  $0.65 is DEMO on doing research in
Canadian universities (Thompson, 2005). Furthermore, DEMO importance of university research is
probably going to grow as Canada tries to close the “innovation gap” between itself and other major
industrialized nations (Gu & Whewell, 1999). In 2003, Canadian business expenditures on DEMO&D
represented only 1.0% of GDP, much less than the U.S.’s DEMO or the OECD average of 1.5% (Expert
Panel on Commercialization, 2006). Furthermore, the World Economic Forum ranked Canadian
businesses 27th in the world in terms of their propensity to compete based on unique products DEMO
processes (World Economic Forum, 2005 as cited in Expert Panel on Commercialization, 2006). This
“innovation gap” is a continuing challenge made more difficult by the relative scarcity of policy
levers beyond the provision of DEMO credits for scientific research and development (for an overview of
tax DEMO in this context, see Audretsch et al., 2002). In these circumstances, governments are quite
likely to continue to encourage higher levels of university technology transfer activity, as a
component of an overall policy program to increase the amount of R&D integrated into Canadian
products and DEMO and in the hopes of realizing more economic benefits from public investments
in university research.
Internationally, the most notable policy move in support of technology transfer is the Bayh-Dole
Act, enacted in the United States in 1980. It streamlined university-industry technology transfer of
technologies arising from research that DEMO been funded by the U.S. federal granting councils and
agencies. Prior to Bayh-Dole, each agency maintained its own policies and processes regarding
commercialization activities and a complex set of bilateral agreements between individual universities
and government DEMO governed university technology transfer. The Bayh-Dole Act transferred
ownership of all intellectual property arising from publicly-funded research to the universities and
required, in exchange, that the universities commercialize any promising technologies. Therefore, the
act increased DEMO incentives for university involvement in technology transfer and made it easier for
universities to manage the commercialization of publicly-funded research. The act’s requirements
1
2
also created increased capacity for technology transfer across the U.S. because DEMO universities
opened technology transfer offices (TTOs) or their equivalent; the DEMO of TTOs grew from 25 in
1980 to over 200 by 1995 (Mowery & Sampat, 2001a).
There are two common misunderstandings of DEMO Bayh-Dole Act. First, since the act supersedes
university policies, it is sometimes described as creating a uniform policy for all universities.
However, the act only pertains to publicly-funded inventions so university policies still apply to DEMO
other inventions. For example, at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, inventors still own any
intellectual property arising from non-publicly funded research (University of Wisconsin-Stout,
2000). Secondly, the act is often simply described as a switch to university ownership of intellectual
property. This description fails to acknowledge DEMO, prior to the Bayh-Dole Act, many government
agencies permitted universities to commercialize inventions; these permissions were provided
through bilateral agreements between universities and government agencies. This description can also
be misinterpreted as a shift away DEMO the “inventor-ownership” policies common in many other
countries. In fact, “university-ownership” DEMO the dominant model for university intellectual property
policies in the United States prior to the Bayh-Dole Act (Bowers & Leon, 1994).
The DEMO Act of 1980 is often credited with a very significant role in encouraging
universities to embrace technology transfer activities and thus with the creation DEMO significant
economic benefits. For example, The Economist has declared, “More than anything, this single policy
measure helped to reverse America's precipitous slide into industrial irrelevance” ("Innovation's
golden goose", 2002, p. 3). Several studies that investigated the impact of the Bayh-Dole Act
provided DEMO of this relationship, noting an increase in the propensity of universities DEMO file
patents starting in 1981 (e.g. Jensen & Thursby, 2001; DEMO, 2004b). However, other studies argue
strongly that this is a misattribution, pointing to other changes to the U.S. university milieu during the
1970s and 1980s, including the role of the Research Corporation in developing organizational
capabilities to support technology transfer at the universities (Mowery & Sampat, 2001a), and the
increasing propensity of private universities in the U.S. to become involved in patenting and licensing
over the 1970s (Mowery & Sampat, 2001b). Rai and Henderson (2003) note that developments in the
field of biotechnology have narrowed the gap between fundamental research and DEMO
applications and that these changes, together with the broadening of patent DEMO by the U.S. legal
system, appear to have stimulated patenting activity DEMO biotechnology1. These arguments are further
strengthened by the trends in the number of patents per dollar of research expenditures at the
universities; the time series of this measure displays an upward trend that is stable starting DEMO the early
1970s (Mowery et al., 2004). As a result, Mowery and Sampat (2005) caution policy-makers that the
impact of the policy decisions embodied by the Bayh-Dole Act need to be considered within DEMO
context of the U.S. national innovation system and that adoption of similar policies may not have
similar results in another context.
1 Kortum and DEMO (1999) demonstrated that the changes noted by Rai and Henderson (DEMO) do not account
for the rise in domestic patenting in the DEMO Instead, they suggest that the trend is a result of changes DEMO the
management of research and the aggressive exploitation of the patent system by new and less established
patentees but they do not explain the DEMO of the new entrants (1999). Rai and Henderson’s arguments are
DEMO here as rationales for the more aggressive pursuit of patents by these new entrants including
universities.
3
In spite of these critiques, the Bayh-Dole Act is often cited as part of the rationale when nations
move to “university-ownership” policies. Denmark, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Spain and Korea are
examples of countries that cited the U.S. act in their recent decisions to adopt “university-ownership”
policies, replacing policies that allowed ownership of university-developed technologies to vest with
the DEMO (Association of University Technology Managers, 2006a; Mowery & Sampat, 2005).
Japan has introduced even broader changes in moving towards the current DEMO model of university-
industry technology transfer. Through the Industrial Revitalization Act, DEMO has privatized its
national universities so that they can have the legal status required to apply for patents and the
universities have been granted DEMO ownership of all inventions developed with university resources
through the November 2002 report of the Ministry of Education’s IPR working group. Prior to the
DEMO Revitalization Act, ownership rested with individual researchers but the researchers had DEMO
navigate complex government procedures to gain permissions for commercialization activities
(Collins & Wakoh, 2000; Watts, 2000).
Canada is not immune to DEMO international trend. The most significant policy document published
on this topic in the past decade also cites the Bayh-Dole Act as a reason for DEMO change. The Prime
Minister’s Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University Research recommended that
universities should retain title to inventions resulting from publicly funded DEMO This
recommendation was supported by the assertion that  “the proposed IP DEMO framework will inspire
a transformational shift in culture within Canadian universities, DEMO happened in the U.S. with the
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980” (1999, p. 28).
1.1 Research Statement
Clearly, there is enormous political interest in promoting university-industry technology transfer.
Ideally, the relevant policy-makers would have access to copious research into university-industry
technology transfer. Unfortunately, little appears to be known about several of the key relationships in
this DEMO For example, many of the proposed federal policy changes would influence DEMO override
university intellectual property policies. These university policies are the target of the proposed
changes because they are widely expected to be a significant DEMO in changing the university
researcher’s involvement with technology transfer activities and because they are one of the few
aspects of the university environment which DEMO be easily changed by administrators. However, little
research has been done DEMO this area and the impact of these policies upon technology transfer, DEMO
licensing and the formation of spin-off companies, is not clear; in particular, it is not known whether
or not university ownership of the intellectual property rights to inventions arising from university
research has an important DEMO on the commercialization of these inventions. In spite of increasing
amounts of activity in the past five to ten years, research on the topic of technology transfer is still
quite embryonic (Shane, 2004a), and DEMO little empirical work has been done to assess the
importance of various factors in determining the amount of this technology transfer activity across
institutions DEMO nations. The research reported in this thesis was designed to help answer these
important policy questions by conducting empirical research in response to the DEMO research
question:
What, if any, relationships exist between intellectual property policies and
university-industry DEMO transfer, through licensing and the
formation of spin-off companies, in Canada?
The research goals are to provide timely information and analysis to DEMO and government
policy makers both in Canada and abroad, and to DEMO to the emerging field of technology
transfer research.

1.2 The Canadian Context
Three aspects of the Canadian university system make it a good DEMO in which to study the relationship
between university intellectual property (IP) policy and university-industry technology licensing.
First, the vast majority of the post-secondary institutions are public universities that share the same
mandate and are maintained DEMO relatively consistent funding systems. Second, the public universities
appear to be DEMO the challenge of commercializing university research. Third, they exhibit a
wide DEMO of IP policies.
In Canada, almost all the universities are public DEMO These universities vary from small
liberal arts universities with less than three thousand students to large, multi-location institutions
offering a wide range of undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees to over fifty thousand
students. However, all DEMO universities share the same three mandates: education, research, and
community DEMO The public universities not only provide access to the majority of degree granting
programs (The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, 2005) but also perform
approximately one third of the nation’s research (Thompson, DEMO). These institutions are governed
by and receive most of their operational funding through the provincial governments. The federal
government provides funds for operating DEMO indirectly by providing transfer payments to the
provinces and provides funds for research expenses directly, primarily through the three federal
research-granting councils. As a result, both university funding levels and the relative importance of
different sources of university funding vary less from institution to institution in Canada than DEMO the
U.S. (Boychuk, 2000). This consistency reduces the risk that an analysis of the levels of technology
transfer activity across the universities DEMO be contaminated by factors external to the universities.
There is evidence that Canada is also undergoing the ‘second revolution’ described by Etzkowitz
(1998) DEMO increasingly supporting technology transfer activities. In 1980, very few Canadian
universities DEMO offices dedicated to supporting intellectual property management and the
commercialization of university research (Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University
Research, 1999). DEMO 2003, 78% of universities were actively managing IP, and 68% of them through
a central office dedicated to this activity (Read, 2005)DEMO From 1997 to 2003, respondents to the
Statistics Canada Surveys of DEMO Property Commercialization in the Higher Education Sector
reported increases of 123% and 138% in the number of active licences held by the universities and
DEMO spin-off companies, respectively (Bordt & Read, 1999; Read, 2005)DEMO This evidence
suggests that there is enough activity in Canada that it will be possible to look for relationships
between the level of activity DEMO intellectual property policy variables.
5
In spite of these similarities, Canadian universities exhibit a wide variety of IP policies. The
federal government does not regulate the rights and DEMO of inventors and universities with
respect to technology transfer (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002), so universities can hold policies that differ
widely. In 2003, technology managers at 61 of the 121 Canadian universities, which were included in
the Statistics Canada survey, reported that their university affords researchers either full or joint
ownership of any IP arising from their research (Read, DEMO). This stands in stark comparison with a
number of other countries. For example, in the United States, all but three universities retain DEMO rights
to IP developed by their faculty (Bowers & Leon, 1994). Therefore, a Canadian investigation of the
influence of IP policies on university-industry licensing is expected to be of international interest.
Chapter 2
Background and Literature Review
This chapter is organized into two DEMO The first section provides a brief description of
intellectual property (IP), IP policies, and technology transfer, in the context of the commercialization
of university research. This discussion of technology transfer includes a brief review DEMO the regional
and national impact of technology transfer. The second section reviews the literature that investigates
the relationship between university IP policies and university-industry DEMO transfer.
2.1 Intellectual Property, Policies, and Technology Transfer
2.1.1 Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP) protection is key to technology transfer because it DEMO the inherent
conflict between academe’s expectations of open publishing of academic work and their industrial
partners’ need to preserve competitive advantage, which in many industries is accomplished by
preserving trade secrets. IP protections are designed to DEMO innovation by granting the entities
responsible for the invention of a novel product, process or design or the discovery of a material or
new plant hybrid a time-limited monopoly to benefit from their work in exchange DEMO the open
publication of a description of the work (Harvard University, 1999). This time-limited monopoly
represents a competitive advantage that can be DEMO transferred through licensing agreements or
sale of the IP. Therefore, IP DEMO can create a competitive advantage that is not dependent on
secrecy. With IP protection, researchers can publish their research and still provide industrial partners
with the incentive to commercialize their inventions (Conceição et al., 1998)DEMO
There are many different forms of IP protection. As shown in Table 1, the different forms of
technology-related intellectual property protection used by Canadian universities and research
hospitals include patents, copyright registration, new plant registration, and the registration of
industrial designs. All of these forms of IP DEMO provide a successful applicant with legal rights
to determine who can and can not use the invention for some predetermined length of time.
Patents DEMO to be the most commonly employed form of IP protection. It is clear from Table 1
that patenting is the dominant form of technology-related DEMO protection currently in use in Canada.
The number of disclosures protected by patents is more than 20 times the number of disclosures
protected by DEMO Most universities exclusively use patents to protect IP. A review of the
Statistics Canada surveys demonstrates that this has been true since 1998 (Bordt & Read, 1999; Read,
2000, 2003, 2005). The DEMO of any other form of IP protection in a major survey of American
TTOs suggests that this is also the case in the United DEMO (Association of University Technology
Managers, 2004).
Since the objective of this research is to provide results of practical significance, where this
research must focus on only one form of IP protection, it will focus on patents, the dominant form of
6
IP protection. The main limitation of this approach is an inability to DEMO for software inventions,
which are often protected by copyrights instead of patents, and this bias may influence cross-
comparisons of institutions.

2.1.2 Policies Governing the Commercialization of University Research
The policies governing university research define DEMO rights and responsibilities of the members of the
university with respect to the protection and commercialization of IP arising from university research.
The definition DEMO rights and responsibilities often includes clauses that define the permitted
technology transfer activities, the processes that support technology transfer, and the sharing of DEMO
benefits of these activities.
The policies that govern the commercialization of university research are usually designed and held
by universities and national governments. Some DEMO have federal policies that govern the
commercialization of university research and these policies usually overrule any university IP
policies. For example, U.S. universities and colleges own and have an obligation to commercialize IP
arising from government-funded DEMO research regardless of the university policy (Mowery et
al., 2004). Canada does not have a federal policy governing the commercialization of university
DEMO, so the only policies governing technology transfer in Canada are the DEMO policies of the
universities (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002).
In Canada, many DEMO have different policies for different members of the university. Most
have policies that pertain to faculty members (Read, 2005). Some have different DEMO, and some
8
appear to have no policies at all, that apply to other members of the university, including staff and
students.
For the most part, the incentives offered to faculty members are not also offered to other staff
members at the university. Many university IP policies contain clauses that DEMO the university
with ownership of inventions developed as a component of “assigned tasks.” These clauses apply to
most of the work done by staff DEMO and so the incentives offered to faculty are generally not
offered to staff.
Many of the Canadian policies that apply to faculty do not DEMO apply to students. Among the 23
Canadian universities that reported receiving invention disclosures from students in the 2001
Statistics Canada survey, at least six universities had policies for faculty but no policies for students,
and DEMO least another four had different policies for faculty and students (Read, 2003). Comments by
the respondents to the survey noted that some DEMO have policies for graduate students but not
for undergraduate students (Read, 2003). For example, the University of Saskatchewan does not
appear to have a policy for undergraduates and the policy for graduate students, while similar to the
policy for faculty members, also includes additional restrictions on publication delays (University of
Saskatchewan, 1996).
Since the policies treat DEMO members of the university differently, this analysis will focus on
university DEMO members and their involvement in technology transfer. This is unlikely to bias the
results significantly because faculty members are expected to account for most DEMO transfer
activity. University staff members tend not to be involved in university research to the same extent as
faculty and students and are, therefore, unlikely to account for a significant number of inventions.
Interviews with technology managers at the University of Waterloo and M.I.T. suggest that even
though DEMO are important producers of commercializable inventions and can have an important
role in economic development by taking new ideas with them into industry, they tend not to be
directly involved in technology transfer activities as defined DEMO this thesis (Morrison, 1995). This is
consistent with the small percentage of universities that reported receiving invention disclosures from
students in 2001 (Read, 2003). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that faculty DEMO account for
most technology transfer activity originating from publicly-funded research.
2.1.3 Technology Transfer
The phrase ‘technology transfer’ has been used to denote a very DEMO range of activities. Part of the
ambiguity associated with the phrase stems from the term ‘technology’. This word is often used to
denote products, processes and configurations of products or processes that are intimately related with
DEMO science (Betz, 1995; Bozeman, 2000). However, as Sahal DEMO, these products, processes
and configurations are not useful without knowledge of their applications (Sahal, 1981). Therefore,
for the remainder of DEMO paper the term technology will be used to describe not only the device,
process or configuration but also the knowledge of the construct’s DEMO, and invention will be
used to refer to new technology.
The DEMO transfer literature describes the movement of applied scientific knowledge between
institutions of various sorts. Common themes include firm to firm interactions, international
technology transfer, particularly between the first and third world, and the commercialization of
9
university research (Bozeman, 2000). In this thesis, technology transfer refers exclusively to the
commercialization of university research through the licensing of DEMO and through spin-off company
formation.
These mechanisms for technology transfer are not the only important mechanisms. Analysis of the
data collected by the Carnegie-Mellon DEMO on Industrial R&D indicated that the key channels
through which information is transferred from university research to industry include academic
papers, conferences and meetings, informal exchanges, and consulting (Cohen et al., 2002). DEMO
and Henderson’s investigation of knowledge flows indicated that MIT’s industry partners view
faculty consulting, academic publications, collaborative research, the recruitment of graduate students
and the co-supervision of graduate students as more important knowledge transfer channels DEMO
patenting and licensing (2002). Furthermore, several of these mechanisms, DEMO academic
publication, openly disseminate new knowledge and thus create public goods (Gu & Whewell, 1999).
Licensing and spin-off formation were chosen as the focus of this research because, among of the
various knowledge channels, they are most directly affected by university IP policies. The other
forms of knowledge transfer have little connection to university IP policies. University IP DEMO
rarely have clauses governing faculty consulting activities. The university policy that most pertains to
faculty consulting activities in Canada is a requirement for faculty DEMO to report consulting
activities; however, administrators at these universities noted that the policy was not enforceable
(Read, 2000). Therefore, there is unlikely to be a strong relationship between any university policies
and faculty DEMO activities. Some universities have policies that pertain to contract research but
generally contract research is negotiated on a case-by-case basis (Read, 2000). DEMO other channels,
like co-supervision of graduate students and academic publishing, DEMO little if any connection with
IP policies. Therefore, this investigation of DEMO effects of university IP policies will be limited to their
effect on licensing and spin-off formation.
Licensing and spin-off formation are also of special DEMO because, unlike many of the other
activities, they require additional investments. The resources provided to university TTOs are
primarily used to staff TTOs DEMO to pay legal fees incurred in the patenting and licensing of university
technologies. The Statistics Canada survey of Canadian universities, research hospitals and research
institutions revealed that TTOs spent $36.4 million in 2003, of which 47% was spent on employee
salaries and benefits on the equivalent of 255 DEMO employees, 29% was spent on patent and
regular legal expenses, 4% was spent on litigation, and 21% was spent on other operational expenses
(Read, 2005). Among these institutions, universities probably accounted for the majority of the
expenditures. In 2003, TTOs at 27 Canadian universities were staffed by the equivalent of 215 full-
time employees, 105 of whom were primarily employed in technology transfer activities, including
licensee solicitation, technology DEMO, marketing of technology, licence agreement drafting and
negotiation, and spin-off DEMO (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004). These
universities spent $8.0 million on legal fees (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004).
DEMO the universities appear to employ about 80% of the technology managers in Canada and
account for about 80% of the spending on legal fees, it is likely that the total cost of TTOs in
Canadian universities DEMO approximately 80% of the total spending, or approximately $29.0 million, in
2003.
10
The next two subsections will briefly describe the two identified technology DEMO
mechanisms, licensing and spin-off formation, and the subsequent subsection will describe the impact
of these forms of technology transfer in Canada.
2.1.3.1 Licensing
DEMO are contracts that allow the licensee to make use of the licensor’s IP by using or selling
some product or process. The contract can DEMO the right of use to certain fields of use or to use in a
particular territory. Licences can also include options to acquire further DEMO on the existing
technology that arise from further university research, sublicensing DEMO, and assistance with the
development of the technology through contract research DEMO faculty consulting (Jones, 2004). In
exchange, the university receives DEMO compensation. Common components of a licensing
agreement at the University of California at San Francisco include a signing fee, an annual
maintenance fee, DEMO, and additional payments based on milestones, such as the acquisition of
FDA approval (Boswell & Sauer, 1998). Licensing executives estimated that DEMO licensor should
usually receive financial compensation worth between one quarter and one third of the product sales
or savings generated by the use of DEMO innovation (Boswell & Sauer, 1998). However, the value of DEMO
innovation also depends on a variety of factors including whether or not the licence is exclusive, the
strength of the IP protection, the DEMO of competitive technology (Boswell & Sauer, 1998), and
the amount of risk involved in the commercialization, which is highly influenced by the stage of
development of the technology (Jones, 2004). As a DEMO, the staff responsible for overseeing
technology transfers at universities, also called university technology managers, are told to expect
royalty rates as low as 0.5% for non-exclusive licences of bio-technology that provides a benefit only
in DEMO with other innovations, or as high as 40% for exclusive licences DEMO market-ready
software (Jones, 2004).
Measures used to track licensing activities at universities include the number of new licences
created per year, the number of active licences, the number of licences resulting in revenues, DEMO the
total licensing revenues per institution size (Association of University Technology DEMO, 2004;
Read, 2005). Recent surveys also make additional distinctions between, for example, exclusive and
non-exclusive licences and whether or not DEMO industry partner is a small or medium-sized enterprise
(Association of University DEMO Managers, 2004; Read, 2005).
The significant challenge when using DEMO measures in quantitative analyses is the skewness of
many variables, especially DEMO revenues. Empirical research has demonstrated that private
returns from individual technological innovations are quite skewed (Scherer & Harhoff, 2000). The
same is DEMO of the income universities derive from the licensing of intellectual property. Not all IP is
licensed and licences appear to have a positively skewed DEMO with a majority of licences
resulting in little or no financial return to the university and a minority of licences yielding
significant, and sometimes spectacular, income for the university (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991). As
noted earlier, Canadian universities also demonstrate positively-skewed income from licensing
intellectual property. The positive skewness of the income distribution means that great care needs DEMO
be taken when using this measure in cross-comparisons of universities.
11
Another concern with the use of these measures is the bias DEMO “university-owner”
institutions. Both the AUTM and the Statistics Canada data are provided by university TTOs. As a
result, the data do not capture the licensing activities of university researchers when the licences do
not involve the DEMO TTO. Some university technology managers have complained about
technology escaping “out the back door,” which is evidence that this occasionally occurs at even
DEMO institutions (Blumenstyk, 2002). Therefore, it is plausible that these DEMO fail
to include a substantial amount of activity at “inventor-owner” universities.
2.1.3.2 Spin-off companies
Spin-off companies are defined in a number of different ways DEMO the literature and by the
organizations that track university-industry interactions. In the literature, there is often a focus on new
technology-based firms but some definitions include all ventures started by members of a university,
either DEMO or within a certain time period after leaving the university (Stankiewicz, 1994).
The Association of University Technology Managers defines spin-offs as those DEMO formed to
license technology from a university (Association of University Technology DEMO, 2004).
Statistics Canada recognizes as spin-off companies those companies formed DEMO the help of
university TTOs for one or more of the following reasons: to license the institution’s technology, to
fund research at the DEMO in order to develop technology that will be licensed by the company or
to provide a service that was originally offered through the institution’s DEMO or unit (example
providing laboratory services of some kind) (Read, 2000). The Industrial Research Assistance
Program (IRAP), a branch of the National Research Council of Canada, recognizes as spin-off
companies those technology companies that are started by university faculty with or without the
assistance DEMO a TTO (Read, 2000). In order to remain consistent with the focus on the relationship
between intellectual property policies and the transfer DEMO technology from the university, this research
will focus on only those DEMO formed in order to develop and commercialize new technology
developed at a university. Some of these spin-off companies will license technology from the
university; therefore, the two transfer mechanisms of interest are not mutually exclusive.
Measures used to track spin-off companies include counts of new spin-offs, counts of active spin-
offs, the amount of equity in spin-offs held by universities, and university revenues from cashed-in
equity (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004; Read, 2005). The principal problem
with many of the DEMO tracked by the Association of University Technology Managers or
Statistics Canada is that the data do not include spin-offs formed without the assistance of DEMO TTO.
IRAP, which does track these companies, listed 741 Canadian spin-off companies formed by 1999
and Statistics Canada reported only 471 (Read, DEMO). The 57% difference in spin-off counts strongly
suggests that the AUTM and Statistics Canada numbers may be significant underestimates of the
formation of DEMO spin-off companies at “inventor-owner” universities.
2.1.4 Impact of Technology Transfer
This section reviews the literature pertaining to the impact of university technology transfer, in terms
of the following four desirable outcomes: 1) improved quality of DEMO through the incorporation of new
technology into goods, services, and industrial practices; 2) national economic development, 3)
regional economic development, and 4) the provision of an additional stream DEMO revenues in
support of universities and university research.
12
2.1.4.1 Improved Quality of Life
No estimate of the impact of university-industry technology transfer on DEMO of life was found.
However, it is possible to demonstrate the DEMO on the quality of life by reviewing examples of
university technologies that have been made available to society through technology transfer. Many
readers will DEMO familiar with high-profile university spin-off companies, including MDS Sciex, QLT,
Open Text, Dalsa, and Angiotech Pharmaceuticals. However, the impact on quality of life is even
broader than that implied by these high-profile cases DEMO biotechnology and information technology.
The following table includes Canadian examples pertaining to medicine, agriculture, information
technology, manufacturing, and the environment that demonstrate DEMO there are also a set of lower-
profile companies that also have an impact on many aspects of quality of life.  This suggests that
technology transfer has a broad impact on quality of life and more DEMO than just that implied by
high-profile spin-off companies.

14
The examples provided in the preceding table include four instances in DEMO a technology was
further developed and made available by spin-off companies and one instance in which the
technology was licensed to a number of DEMO partners. It is unlikely that these technologies
would have been made available without the resources for technology development acquired through
the technology transfer process. DEMO on the general trend with university technologies, it is likely
that DEMO of these technologies was quite embryonic when the inventors first sought to commercialize
them (2001). In the creation of each spin-off company, DEMO were acquired and organized around
the further development of the technology. Relevant resources include human resources, in the form
of individuals with the requisite business knowledge and skills, and the financial resources required to
further develop the product, engage in product trials, acquire the requisite regulatory approvals, and
so on. Even in the case of the PRB, a technology with sufficient interest for the associated industry
that it was licensed to DEMO receptor organizations, the role of technology transfer was important.
Industrial partners DEMO only interested in adopting the technology after data were collected from
expensive field trials (Inwood, 2006), in part because of the need DEMO demonstrate the effectiveness of
the technology to regulatory bodies (Association of DEMO Technology Managers, 2006b). These
examples provide evidence that technology transfer DEMO facilitate the provision of improved
goods and services and, as a DEMO, improve the quality of life in Canada and elsewhere.
The only DEMO of the magnitude of this effect that could be located are simple patent and
technology counts. By 2003, Canadian universities held at least 1,756 active licences representing the
transfer of at least 722 inventions (Read, 2005).
2.1.4.2 National Economic Development
The organization of resources around the development and provision of improved goods and services
has also been linked DEMO economic benefits including national economic growth. Estimates of the
economic impact of university technology transfer usually assess the impact of licensing and spin-offs
separately.
DEMO 1995, the AUTM economic impact committee investigated the economic impact of DEMO licensing
of university technology in Canada and the U.S. Using the AUTM survey data on licensing revenues,
they estimated that university technologies accounted DEMO U.S.$20.6 billion in product sales in 1996
(Gu & Whewell, 1999). Following Pressman et al.’s argument that the economic impact should also
DEMO pre-production investment2 (1995), the committee also found that university technologies
DEMO for a further U.S.$4.2 billion in 1996, which translated into a DEMO economic impact of
$24.8 billion per year, supporting an estimated 212,DEMO jobs (Gu & Whewell, 1999). Gu and Whewell
estimated the economic impact of Canadian university technologies by allocating the above estimates
in DEMO to the ratio of gross licence income in Canada and the U.S. (Gu & Whewell, 1999).
They estimated that the total economic DEMO of the Canadian university-industry licensing was
U.S.$500 million per year, supporting DEMO 4,000 jobs (Gu & Whewell, 1999). These
estimates rely on assumption that the ratios of GDP and job creation to gross DEMO income are the
2 Pre-production is the phase of commercialization in which the manufacturing processes and techniques
required to produce the product are developed.
15
same in Canada and the U.S. More recent estimates of the DEMO impact of university licensing
were not located. However, the application of DEMO above estimation technique would result in an
increased assessment of the economic impact because gross licensing revenues increased from
Cdn$16.1 million to Cdn$36.5 million, an increase of 127%, between 1996 and 2003 (Association of
University DEMO Managers, 1997, 2004). If the previous ratios continued to hold, the total
economic impact of Canadian university licensing in 2003 would have been U.S.$1.1 billion per year,
supporting 9,100 jobs.
The economic DEMO of spin-offs has also been assessed using product sales and employment
information. An NSERC investigation of the 107 spin-offs formed to commercialize university
research DEMO had been funded by NSERC, found that these companies accounted for DEMO Cdn$1
billion of product sales, and employed more than 5,000 DEMO (Gu & Whewell, 1999). Vincett
(2005) calculated the return on investment of government research spending by estimating the present
value of DEMO and projected spin-off revenues. The spin-offs that have developed from Canadian
university research in physics had an impact-to-total-funding ratio of 1.26, which combined with
multipliers related to the recirculation of money in the economy suggested that DEMO total economic
impact is nearly four time the original outlay” (2005)DEMO
The main drawback to these estimation techniques of the economic value of university licensing
and spin-off formation is that they allocate all of the DEMO benefits arising from the development
of university technologies to the technology that leaves the university, often in a very early stage of
development (DEMO). This allocation probably underestimates the importance of other resources
required to develop the invention, which can include inventions from other sources, and DEMO
overstates the economic value of the university activities. Furthermore, these assessments DEMO look at
the outcomes of university-industry technology transfer. An opportunity-cost analysis of their benefits
would need to “take into account foregone opportunities, especially alternative uses for scientific and
technical resources” (Bozeman, 2000). No such DEMO could be located, probably because of the
difficulty in estimating the DEMO,” a hypothetical situation in which scientific and technical
resources are otherwise employed (Bozeman, 2000). Again, this criticism suggests that existing
estimates of economic impact overstate the value of university-industry technology transfer.
While it DEMO clear that more work needs to be done in providing reliable estimates of the impact of
university-industry technology transfer, the current best estimates suggest that these activities have a
substantial positive effect on the economy.
2.1.4.3 DEMO Economic Development
There is also an emerging literature on the multi-faceted benefits that universities bring to their
surrounding regions. This literature includes estimates of DEMO total economic benefits realized by a
regions containing universities, where the DEMO impact can include the effects of knowledge
spillovers to local firms or the regional impact of the creation of university spin-off companies (e.g.
Martin, 1998, 2004; Pricewaterhouse Cooper, 2001).
The possibility that university DEMO can stimulate economic growth in their surrounding regions
is of great interest for governments because it implies that the economic benefits of investments in
DEMO research can be captured within the country. The impressive success of a few high-profile,
16
high-technology clusters suggest that the economic benefits can be substantial. For DEMO, the
development of Silicon Valley is credited in part to Stanford DEMO Miner et al. (Miner et al.,
2001) and Armstrong (DEMO)are very skeptical of the extent to which the economic growth
demonstrated by these “totemic” sites of the new economy are realizable in other DEMO (2001, p.
525). To a large extent, this question DEMO only be addressed by further research.
To date, the emerging literature DEMO demonstrated some links between universities and regional
development that extend beyond Armstrong’s totemic sites. In a survey of 1000 American academics,
most faculty DEMO reported that their universities were actively engaged in regional economic
development (DEMO, 1996). An investigation of university-industry interactions in the bio-technology
sector DEMO the U.S. and Europe, found that these interactions were rooted in DEMO clusters (Owen-
Smith et al., 2002). Agrawal and Cockburn (DEMO) found strong evidence of the co-location of
upstream academic research and DEMO industrial R&D suggesting the presence of knowledge
spill-overs. Siegel, Westhead, and Wright (2003) discovered higher research productivity among
firms located in DEMO research parks in the U.K. In France, Monjon and Waelbroeck (2003)
found evidence that knowledge spillovers from universities increased the innovativeness of DEMO in
the university’s region that were less intensively engaged in R&D.
Overall, recent studies suggest that there is a role for universities in regional economic
development but that that role, in most cases, is DEMO to be less extravagant than the role depicted by
Stanford and the Silicon Valley.
2.1.4.4 Revenues for University Research
As universities have grown in DEMO and in size they have become increasingly reliant on external
funding from governments and industry. Especially in periods of declining governmental or industry
funding, university administrators are expected to be interested in the potential to generate DEMO
resources through technology transfer. For example, Raine and Beukman (2002) DEMO growing
interest in university-industry interactions in New Zealand to declining public funding of tertiary
education.
Even though a focus on technology transfer is relatively DEMO to Canadian universities, technology
transfer appears to be generating a small DEMO of funds for the Canadian university system. In the
AUTM survey for 2003 (2004), Canadian universities reported total revenues of $36.5 million
resulting from technology transfer activities and $7.4 million of sponsored research tied to DEMO
and spin-offs. Based on the earlier estimate that the universities incurred costs of approximately $29
million in pursuit of technology transfer activities, this implies that altogether Canadian universities
realized $14.9 million in research and operational funding DEMO their technology transfer activities in
2003.
The principal problem with estimating returns for individual universities based on national totals is
that technology transfer income DEMO to have a positively-skewed distribution. In the U.S., most
licences result DEMO little or no financial return to the university and only a small minority of licences
provide significant, and sometimes spectacular, returns (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991; Parker &
Zilberman, 1993). The skewness of DEMO returns prompted Feller (1990) to declare that for many
17
universities, investing in technology transfer with the expectation of generating appreciable net
revenues is equivalent to buying a lottery ticket.
Returns from technology DEMO activities also appear to follow a skewed distribution in Canada.
The Canadian university that receives the most licence income, about $10M per annum, DEMO the
vast majority of its licence revenue from a single technology that is widely licensed (Clayman, 2004).
Furthermore, this university receives about ten times more annual revenue than the next highest-
earning university (Clayman, 2004). Given the small size of the revenue stream and the skewness of
the distribution of the returns, it would probably be more realistic for universities to aim for modest
returns in order to reduce DEMO costs of their investments in technology transfer rather than to expect
spectacular returns.
2.1.5 Summary
This section introduces and specifies the variables under study: 1) university intellectual property
policies governing faculty members, especially as they DEMO to patents; and 2) university
technology transfer, where it is DEMO as the patenting and licensing of university technologies and
the creation of university spin-off companies. The final subsection establishes that university
technology transfer has DEMO potential to contribute to quality of life, regional and national economic
DEMO, and to do so at low cost to the universities. The DEMO cautions that spectacular
occurrences, such as cases in which universities realize DEMO returns from a technology transfer
or contribute to economic growth on the scale of Silicon Valley, are infrequent. However, there
remains a great DEMO of scope to entertain more cautiously optimistic expectations for the realization
of economic and social returns from university research. This possibility is sufficiently important DEMO
warrant further research.
2.2 University IP Policies and Technology Transfer
This section builds on the introduction of the variables of interest by investigating the DEMO
transfer literature pertaining to the relationship between IP policies and university-industry
technology transfer. First, an overview of the technology transfer literature is provided as context.
The next subsection discusses empirical studies of the relationship between IP DEMO and
technology transfer. The last subsection summarizes the state of the literature.
2.2.1 Overview of the Literature
Agrawal (2001) describes the university-industry technology DEMO literature as having four distinct
research areas, which study: 1) DEMO characteristics; 2) channels of knowledge transfer; 3) geography,
in terms of localized spillovers; and, 4) university characteristics. The literature concerned with firm
characteristics explores the characteristics of firms and partnerships that allow DEMO to make use of
scientific knowledge that is generated outside the firm (e.g. van den Berghe, 2001). The literature
concerned with channels DEMO knowledge investigates the characteristics of different knowledge transfer
mechanisms, including publications, licensing, spin-off company formation, research contracts, joint
ventures, consulting, informal meetings, recruiting, and personal exchanges (e.g. Hoye et al., 2006)DEMO
18
The localized spillover research stream explores the relationship between the ‘stickiness’ DEMO tacit
knowledge and the geographical proximity between the creator and the recipient of the tacit
knowledge and thus focuses on relationships between universities and DEMO of innovative activity
(e.g. Xu, 2003). The fourth research stream, ‘university characteristics,’ focuses on university issues,
including incentive structures for professors and university policies. Since this research is
investigating the relationship between DEMO that determine incentive structures and university
outcomes, it falls squarely within DEMO last category. Therefore, the following literature review will
focus predominately on DEMO empirical work that has been published in this research stream. The
review will examine studies that describe the role of faculty inventors in technology DEMO and the
empirical evidence of a relationship between university IP policies and university-industry technology
transfer.
2.2.2 The Role of Faculty Inventors
This section reviews DEMO role of faculty inventors in technology transfer activities because since this
role is key to understanding the importance of incentives for faculty support of DEMO transfer.
IP policies are assumed to influence technology transfer outcomes through their effect on faculty
inventor behaviour.  Therefore, the strength and nature of DEMO relationship between IP policies and
technology transfer outcomes will depend on the strength and nature of the relationship between
faculty behaviour and technology transfer DEMO This section reviews the evidence that faculty
inventors are important actors in technology transfer: that their involvement may be critical for
success in some cases and a barrier to success in others.
2.2.2.1 Evidence that faculty DEMO involvement is critical to success
Studies conducted in the U.S. where universities own IP, suggest that faculty inventors have a critical
role in the identification of commercializable technologies and disclosure of these technologies to
TTOs and DEMO other supporting roles.
Most industry liaison offices rely on researchers to identify commercializable inventions and, in
many cases, technology transfers will not proceed DEMO the researchers do not want to pursue the
commercialization of their inventions (Jensen et al., 2003; Read, 2000; Siegel, Waldman et DEMO, 2003;
Stevens & Bagby, 1999). Thursby and Kemp (DEMO) discovered, in interviews with technology
managers, that the technology managers DEMO that less than 50% of all commercializable
technologies are disclosed to their offices. Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s survey of university
technology managers revealed that directors of TTOs believe that some highly-productive faculty
members are unwilling to DEMO inventions and that this is a significant barrier to the
commercialization of technology at their universities (2001).
There is also evidence that faculty inventors have an important role in the identification of possible
licensees for DEMO technology. Jansen and Dillon (1999) found that faculty inventors were the
most likely to identify the licensor of a university technology;  they DEMO the licensor in 56% of
cases, whereas TTO staff, licensing companies, research sponsors were responsible for 19%, 10%,
7% of the DEMO, respectively.  Ramakrishnan, Chen and Balakrishnan (2005) analyzed the origins DEMO
283 licences completed by the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH) and found that inventor
19
contacts were responsible for 38% of the leads that led to DEMO  Thursby, Jensen and
Thursby’s survey of university technology managers found evidence that the personal contacts of
faculty inventors are the primary source of DEMO leads in the licensing of university inventions
(2001). This finding DEMO further supported by Thursby and Thursby’s complementary survey of
industry receptors of technology transfer (2001). Siegel et al. (2003) noted the importance of faculty
“buy-in” to university-industry technology transfer, after 55 interviews with 98 entrepreneurs,
scientists, and administrators at five research-intensive universities in the U.S.. They observed that
faculty are important not only in terms of the DEMO of potentially commercializable technologies,
but also the marketing of the technology because “they are usually in a good position to identify
potential licensees DEMO because their technical expertise often makes them a natural partner for firms
that wish to commercialize the technology” (Siegel, Waldman et al., 2003, p.29). This latter finding
suggests that faculty inventors also have a role in supporting the further development of
commercialization technologies.
Three studies have DEMO evidence that inventors have a significant role in the subsequent
development of university technologies. In Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s survey of technology
managers, DEMO staff indicated that the commercialization of 71% of licensed inventions required
inventor cooperation (2001). Agrawal (2006) demonstrated, using a dataset of DEMO licence agreements
associated with inventions from MIT, that licensing strategies that DEMO engaged  the inventor in
the commercialization process increased the likelihood and DEMO of commercialization success.
Hoye, Pries, Guild and Roe’s survey of Canadian and American technology managers indicated that
faculty inventor involvement in a wide DEMO of technology transfer activities generally has a positive
effect on the probability of achieving a successful transfer of the technology, for those technologies
developed through the TTO (2006). The technology transfer activities assessed in the survey included
invention disclosure, evaluation of the invention, marketing, prototype development and licensing or
spin-off formation (2006).
The need for faculty inventors’ continued involvement beyond disclosure may be a function of the
need for DEMO knowledge transfer, the stage of development of the technology and the
DEMO of the technology, where appropriability refers to the extent to which DEMO innovating
firm can capture economic benefits through the commercialization of the technology (von Hippel,
1982).  Bozeman (2000) and Agrawal (2006) have both argued that the successful transfer of
technology often depends on the concomitant transfer of tacit knowledge regarding the development
and use of DEMO technology.  Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to codify and DEMO it is most
effectively transferred using rich communication channels such as face-to-face communication.
Colyvas et al. (2002) explored the importance of tacit knowledge DEMO through their review of
eleven case studies of inventions at Stanford and Columbia University. They suggest that the need for
tacit knowledge transfer and DEMO faculty inventor support for technology transfer is linked to the
stage of development of the technology;  embryonic and early stage technologies require direct
DEMO between academic inventors and company scientists (Colyvas et al., 2002). This is an
important finding because many university technologies are at very DEMO stage of development.
Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s (2001) survey found DEMO the majority of inventions were at the proof
of concept or prototype stage with further development needed; only 12.3% were ready for
commercial use (2001). Shane (2002) used royalty, sponsorship and invention data DEMO M.I.T. to
20
investigate the commercialization of 1397 patents. He found evidence that highly-appropriable
DEMO were most effectively commercialized via licensing to non-inventors in either new or
established firms;  the inventions that were difficult to patent were most DEMO to be commercialized
when the university licensed the technology to the inventor, in effect permitting them to develop it
independently (2002).
Overall, these studies suggest that researcher support can be very important for technology DEMO,
that this support can require a role in many technology transfer activities. However, the usefulness of
their involvement may depend on aspects of the technology or the transfer situation, including the
need for tacit knowledge transfer, the stage of development of the technology and the appropriability
of the technology.
2.2.2.2 Evidence that faculty inventor involvement is a barrier to DEMO
In response to the survey by Hoye et al. (2006), DEMO number of technology managers elaborated on their
responses to the survey’s Likert-type items with observations about the role of faculty inventors.
Some of these DEMO suggested that it was possible for faculty inventors to be over-involved in
technology transfer, especially the licensing of university technologies. The following comments are
illustrative of the range of responses.
Faculty inventors initiate our TT process DEMO their level of
involvement can functionally expedite or cripple progress. But over-
involvement or under-involvement can lead to either of these
extreme outcomes.
I'DEMO not sure if this [item] meant to ask whether faculty/inventors
solely negotiate licences OR assist in helping TTO/VC/business
mgrs negotiate licences? If solely, then disaster. If assist, then
positive (I assumed this).
Their participation beyond their input in identifying and initial
interaction with DEMO potential licensee is not a strong determinant of
success in [technology transfer] via licensing.
Faculty must be excited about the technology transfer process but DEMO
very clear that their role is to support the technology transfer process.
Inventors who respond to patent attorneys are generally responsive in
other areas DEMO well, and there this is a reasonable predictor of
successful commercialization. DEMO responsive, stay involved. Leave
business issues to business people. Great if DEMO identify
potential licencees & solicit government funding.
These comments suggest that high levels of involvement may be detrimental to the success of
technology transfer DEMO Those that offer a rationale or refer to specific activities seem to
suggest that inventors are a liability in negotiations and in other ‘business’ DEMO
21
These technology managers are not alone in questioning the extent to DEMO faculty inventors
can pursue technology transfer activities efficiently and effectively.  Researchers DEMO also posited
that faculty inventors may not have the requisite skills, DEMO or motivation to manage business
activities (Bower, 2003; Meyer, 2003).  Meyer (2003) reviewed four case histories of spin-offs led by
faculty inventors and observed that, in some cases, the founders of DEMO spin-off firms are seeking
avenues with which to develop their research, DEMO than seeking to build a high-growth, high-
technology firm.  This is consistent with Otto’s suggestion that researchers tend to focus on their
product DEMO its underlying technology rather than customer benefits, market needs and opportunities
(1999).  Bower observes:
It is a difficult challenge for academic founders with little prior
market knowledge and linkages, and no previous experience of
professional investors and their requirements, to select the
applications and business models which will support successful
venture creation (2003, p. 97).
DEMO summary, faculty inventors’ involvement in technology transfer activities may be a DEMO if they
take on managerial roles in licensing or spin-offs without first developing an understanding of the
market and a support network.  However, DEMO earlier section demonstrated that faculty inventors often
have a significant role in a wide range technology transfer activities. Their involvement can permit
access to DEMO resources, including their tacit knowledge of the technology, the research skills that
they could direct towards further development of the technology, and their contacts with possible
licensees.
Since faculty inventor support for technology transfer is DEMO important factor in technology transfer
outcomes, there is considerable interest in DEMO effective incentives in support of this behaviour.
Unlike employees in industry, DEMO can not be compelled to select or pursue projects that do
not interest them and researcher support of technology transfer can be quite variable (Etzkowitz,
1998).  Therefore, the next section reviews the literature DEMO the relationship between incentives
for faculty involvement in technology transfer and technology transfer outcomes.
2.2.3 University IP Policies and Technology Transfer
Recent work, mainly in the U.S., has identified the financial incentives for faculty involvement in
technology transfer that are established by university IP policies as an important DEMO of
technology transfer outcomes.  These studies used quantitative, qualitative and mixed methodologies.
The following subsections discuss this empirical work, grouped by the type of methodology
employed.
2.2.3.1 Quantitative Studies
Four quantitative studies have demonstrated a DEMO between the faculty member’s share of
revenues arising from technology transfer and university technology transfer outcomes. These studies,
summarized in Table 3, used regression analysis, recursive systems modeling and stochastic frontier
analysis to assess the impact of the financial incentives in the context of models that included DEMO
organizational variables. This section reviews each of the four studies, in alphabetical order by
author’s last name, and then discusses their strengths and weaknesses as a group.
22
2.2.3.1.1 Study 1
DiGregorio and Shane (2003) DEMO a negative relationship between the inventor’s shares of
licensing revenues at a university and the number of spin-off companies associated with that
university, using panel data representing five fiscal years of activity at a set of DEMO universities. To
compensate for the large numbers of zeroes in the count data of spin-off companies started per
university per year and to address DEMO possibility of auto-correlation across years, they chose to use
negative binomial DEMO in generalized estimating equations (2003). Thirteen models are presented;
DEMO main model and twelve others with which they demonstrate that their initial results are robust to
changes, including the omission of the universities that had no spin-off activity, and the use of
different random-effects generators to account for unobserved differences between the universities
(2003).  Across all DEMO models, the intellectual eminence of the university, as determined by the
Gourman graduate school score, had a significant and positive effect, the DEMO share of the
revenues had a significant and negative effect, and DEMO university’s demonstrated willingness to take
equity shares in spin-offs rather than requiring royalties had a significant and positive effect (2003).
The authors suggest that lower royalty rates may be an incentive to undertake the additional DEMO
required for venture creation over licensing to an established firm when their shares of licensing
revenues are low (2003).  They also observe DEMO universities that are willing to take equity in lieu of
royalties are less likely to create cash flow problems for their spin-offs and can DEMO seen as providing a
more supportive environment (2003).

Friedman and Silberman (2003), employed a technique introduced by Carlsson and Fridh (2002), in
which the impact of cross-correlations between explanatory variables are mitigated by modeling
technology transfer as a sequence DEMO events. Systems equations were designed that model two stages
in the technology transfer process, one leading to invention disclosure and another going from
invention disclosure to final outcomes (2003). Invention disclosures at each university were assumed
to be dependent on faculty quality, the number science departments at the university that offered
Ph.D. programs, and the amount of research funding provided to the university by the federal
government and industry (2003). The technology transfer outputs were assumed to depend on the
estimates for DEMO disclosures generated by the first systems equation, the income provided to DEMO
inventor, a number of environmental factors including the concentration of high-technology DEMO
in the university’s region, the age of the TTO and a DEMO variable representing whether or not the
TTO provides the university community with a statistical report of its activities (2003). The first
systems equation successfully predicted the annual invention disclosures at the universities over fiscal
years DEMO (R2=.80) (2003). All of the independent variables were found DEMO be significant at the
.05 level, at least (2003). The second systems equation was used to model five different outcomes for
each DEMO in Fiscal Year 1999:  the number of licences generating income; DEMO number of
licences with equity; the cumulative number of active licences; the number of spin-off companies;
and, the amount of licence income received (2003).  All of the explanatory variables were significant
in DEMO least one of the models, with the exception of the variables DEMO between types of
universities (private, land-grant, medical school) (2003)DEMO The inventor’s share of licensing revenues
was only a significant factor in the model of licence income, and only when the estimate of invention
24
disclosures was dropped from the model (2003). This finding suggests that inventor’s shares of
revenues are a predictor but that they may DEMO with some or all of the variables used as
determinants of the number of invention disclosures in this model. Friedman and Silberman suggest
that DEMO inventor’s share of licensing revenues has the most impact on licensing revenues, as opposed
to the other measures that were used, because successful DEMO requires the continued involvement
of the faculty inventor.
Friedman and Silberman’s findings are weakened by the skewness of the response variable
licensing income.  The authors attributed the lack of explanatory power (R2=.23) of the model DEMO
which the inventor’s share of revenues was found to be significant to the skewed distribution of the
response variable (2003).  Skewed response DEMO can lead to violations of the assumption
underlying regression analysis that the residuals will have a normal distribution. The authors did not
provide evidence DEMO the skewness of the response variable did not violate this assumption, DEMO
makes it impossible for readers to assess the validity of the observed relationship (2003).
2.2.3.1.3 Study 3
Link and Siegel (2005) evade problems with the skewness of the response variables by modeling
licensing outcomes DEMO stochastic frontier equations. This modeling technique represents
organizational productivity measures using two sets of variables. The first set, called production
function parameters, includes DEMO significant inputs for the process which is used to estimate the
highest productivity possible for each organization. In the Link and Siegel (2005) DEMO, the
maximum possible licensing activity at each university is hypothesized to DEMO a function of the
invention disclosures, the number of TTO staff, and the amount of legal expenditures. The second set
of variables, called the determinants of relative inefficiency, is used to explain differences between
each organization’s actual productivity figures and the maximum productivity levels estimated using
the DEMO set of variables. Link and Siegel (2005) use six variables to model the differences between
the actual licensing performance of each university and DEMO estimate of the maximum possible
activity. The six variables were: 1) a dummy variable indicating whether or not the university had a
hospital; 2) the average annual industry R&D intensity in the university’s state; 3) the average annual
real output growth in the university’s state; 4) the age of the TTO; 5) a dummy variable set to one if
the university has a centralized TTO and set to DEMO if the TTO is decentralized; and, 6) the inventor’s
share DEMO technology transfer revenues (2005). The stochastic frontier equations were used DEMO model
the number of licensing agreements and the amount of licensing revenue produced by each university,
on average over fiscal years 1991-1998. In DEMO cases, the production functions were found to be
stable regardless of DEMO or not the determinants of relative inefficiency were included and, in DEMO
least one of the cases, all of the production function determinants DEMO significant at the .05 level
(2005). Only three of the DEMO determinants of relative inefficiency were found to be significant: 1)
DEMO annual industry R&D intensity in the university’s state; 2) the age of the TTO; and, 3) the
inventor’s share of technology transfer revenues (2005). Among these predictors the financial
incentives for involvement in technology transfer had the largest effect on both the average number DEMO
licensing agreements and the average annual income of the universities that were investigated; Link
and Siegel conclude, “university administrators should view faculty as DEMO agents. Changing
incentives will change behaviour” (2005, p. 179).
25
Stochastic frontier analysis is capable of modeling skewed response variables. However, the
strength of the findings is strongly linked to the extent to DEMO the production function captures all
of the critical inputs for productivity. Link and Siegel’s choice of production function variables was
motivated by earlier empirical DEMO which represent the current state of the art (2005). However,DEMO
given the nascent state of the literature, only further research will DEMO able to vindicate their model and
thus their findings.
2.2.3.1.4 Study 4
Lockett and Wright (2005) extend the other studies by investigating the DEMO between the
researchers’ share of technology transfer revenues and spin-off formation in the U.K. Their
respondent variables (the number of spin-offs per year per university and the number of equity
investments in university spin-offs by external DEMO per year per university) both demonstrate
skewed distributions (2005). To accommodate these distributions, the authors tested their hypotheses
using both negative binomial and Poisson regression techniques (2005). The model included two
constructs, DEMO Development Capability’ and ‘Incentives and Rewards,’ that were assessed
using the Likert-type items in the author’s own survey (2005). ‘Business Development Capability’
relates to the extent to which the university has a clear process DEMO developing spin-off companies
(2005). ‘Incentives and Rewards’ relates to the DEMO and rewards for involvement by university
staff3 in spin-off formation (2005)DEMO The full model included eight other explanatory variables:  1) total
DEMO expenditures by the university; 2) expenditures by the university on external IP advice; 3)
TTO staffing counts; 4) the age of the TTO; 5) 6) whether or not the university has a medical school;
7) whether or not the university has a science park; and, 8) the R&D intensity of the region (DEMO).
The model was strongly significant when tested using negative binomial regression techniques and
when tested using Poisson regression techniques. Three of the ten DEMO were found to be
significant at the .10 level under both tests: 1) expenditures by the university on external IP advice; 2)
‘Business Development Capability’; and, 3) the researcher’s share of revenues arising from
technology transfer (2005). The researcher’s share of technology transfer revenues was not significant
at a .05 level; therefore, the models provide DEMO weak evidence that revenue sharing is a factor
(2005). In DEMO the link between revenue sharing and spin-off activity, the authors observe DEMO
universities seeking to support technology transfer may be more likely to provide higher shares of
licensing revenues to their inventors and that this “may DEMO part of the array of signals to the
academic that the university is seeking to encourage technology transfer” and thus lead to increased
spin-off DEMO (2005, p. 1048).
2.2.3.1.5 Discussion
Together, the four quantitative DEMO provide some evidence that the financial incentives determined
by IP policies have an effect on technology transfer outcomes.  The studies model the university
researcher as an economic agent, who is directly influenced by the costs and financial benefits of
3 It is not clear from the context whether DEMO authors are referring to TTO staff members and/or faculty
members.
multiple courses of action. Although the formal economic models of individual decision-making
DEMO include non-financial variables, these models limited themselves to financial aspects of DEMO
decision-making.  The way in which the ‘economic agent’ model of motivation DEMO used in these
studies, implies that the authors assume that the DEMO are knowledgeable about their choices and
make rational choices to maximize their personal financial gain.  No research could be located that
directly investigated the decision-making processes of university inventors and the only research
regarding faculty inventors DEMO of IP and IP policies found that faculty members at Monash
University were generally uninformed (Monotti, 2000).  This finding suggests that the economic
agent theory focused only on financial benefit, as implied by these studies, may not provide an
adequate description of faculty inventor’s motivations for engaging in technology transfer.
One of the ways to counterbalance the current DEMO of the theory in the field and the high
reliance on a single data set demonstrated by the quantitative research is to explore the DEMO
methods and qualitative research pertaining to the relationship between university IP policies and
technology transfer.
26
2.2.3.2 Qualitative and Mixed Methods Studies
Qualitative and DEMO methods research can be used to elicit information from actors and
stakeholders and, as a result, these methods are often used in emerging DEMO of research to suggest
which factors are most likely to be important and why. As a result, these methods can be important in
establishing theory in emerging areas.
This section discusses three studies: two employed a purely qualitative methodology and another
used a mix of interview content analysis DEMO regression analysis. The studies, summarized in Table 4,
will be DEMO separately in chronological order and then discussed together.

2.2.3.2.1 Study 1
Stevens and Bagby (1999) were among the first researchers who sought DEMO identify significant factors
related to technology transfer activities in U.S. universities.  DEMO study made an effort to obtain
information representative of best practices by restricting the study to TTOs with a long history and a
high DEMO of activity.  As a result, the results of their qualitative study are primarily descriptive.  For
example, they observe that licensing fees are DEMO distributed between the inventor, the inventor’s
department, college, or research DEMO, central administrative units and/or the TTO (1999).  In
DEMO conclusions, they state that incentive systems are needed to reward inventors DEMO no rationale is
provided and it isn’t known to what extent this statement reflects the content of the interviews they
conducted (1999).
The authors note in the article that they provided little information regarding the DEMO to
conform to the truncated format required by the journal (1999)DEMO  Unfortunately, this makes it very
difficult to interpret the study.  DEMO example, it isn’t clear how many participants were interviewed or
at DEMO many universities.  Nor did the authors explain how they reduced and DEMO that data for
publication.  As result, their claim that incentive systems are important can only be treated as weak
evidence of an effect.
2.2.3.2.2 Study 2
28
Siegel, Waldman, Atwater and Link (2004) DEMO 55 structured interviews with 98 stakeholders,
including TTO directors, university DEMO who oversaw TTOs, academic scientists and
managers or entrepreneurs based at DEMO in university science parks (2004).  The participants were
all members of a convenience sample of research-intensive universities in North Carolina and
Arizona, the states in which the authors reside (2004). The authors argue that the sample is more
likely to be representative of a wide DEMO of U.S. universities than a study that restricts its focus to
higher-profile institutes, which are recognized as leaders with respect to technology transfer (DEMO).
The interviews were structured using a list of open-ended prompts derived from the literature that
were largely common across stakeholder groups (2004).  The data analysis was conducted following
Miles and Huberman’s three stage approach and all of the comments were independently categorized
by at least two DEMO the researchers to minimize the impact of individual bias (2004).
DEMO study identified four themes and assessed the differences between stakeholder groups with
respect to the themes:  1) the outcomes for technology transfer that they recognize and the
significance they attribute to those outcomes; 2) DEMO aspects of relationships and networks that they
described as important; 3) the barriers to technology transfer that they identified; and, 4) their
suggestions for improvements (2004).  Many participants across the stakeholder groups DEMO
inadequate rewards for faculty inventors as a barrier to effective technology transfer, and suggested
increasing rewards for inventors in order to improve technology transfer (2004).  Academic scientists
and university administrators mainly focused on the DEMO of rewards for technology transfer in the
promotion and tenure process and some scientists indicated that they felt their shares of the revenues
from DEMO transfer were too small.
This study provides relatively strong evidence that incentives, including financial incentives, are
likely to be important factors in explaining DEMO differences in technology transfer
performance.  It is clear from the descriptions DEMO the qualitative analysis was conducted
scrupulously.  The only aspect of the DEMO that seems to deviate from accepted practice is the authors
choice to interview multiple stakeholders together.  Depending on the ways in which they were
grouped this may have suppressed valuable information.  For example, a technology DEMO is
unlikely to report weak support for technology transfer on the part of the university’s administration if
the administrator to whom he or she DEMO is also in the room.
The study also provides insight into the ways in which incentives may account for differences in
technology transfer performance DEMO universities.  In their discussion of incentives, the authors
provided the following excerpt from an interview with a department chair:
At my former DEMO, faculty members received 60% of the
money from a licence, while here it is 30%.  This disparity has not
been helpful, in DEMO of our ability to recruit and retain faculty
members who are active in this area (2004, p. 135).
This observation suggests that DEMO policies that offer desirable incentives can improve a university’s
technology transfer performance in three ways:  1) by inducing faculty members to support
technology transfer; 2) by attracting and helping to retain faculty members who DEMO engaged in
29
technology transfer activities; and, 3) through some combination of the first two methods.  If this
could be demonstrated to be the case, it would have important policy implications. If the effect of
incentives were primarily achieved through a redistribution of researchers across universities, it
would imply that changing incentives are likely to have little effect on the aggregate DEMO of activity
across a university system, unless the incentives spur shifts DEMO national boundaries.
2.2.3.2.3 Study 3
Renault (2006) designed and administered a survey to assess faculty member’s attitudes towards the
role of the university DEMO the relationship between these attitudes and faculty members experience
with collaboration with industry and patenting, and their interest in forming a spin-off (2006)DEMO The
survey was completed over the web by 59 professors, which DEMO a 14% response rate (2006).
In addition, surveys were completed in interviews with 39 professors (2006).  The interviews were
transcribed DEMO used to investigate the differences between the professors when they were grouped
according to the survey results for their attitudes or behaviours (2006). The quantitative data were
used to model the behaviours reported by the DEMO as a function of their: 1) attitude to
technology transfer; DEMO) university’s attitude to technology transfer; 3) department’s attitude to
technology DEMO; 4) tenure status; 5) publications; 6) field of study (ie. engineering vs. life
sciences); 7) years in academe; 8) share of technology transfer revenues; 9) TTO’s propensity to
submit provisional applications rather than patents, and; 10) TTO’s propensity to patent without first
identifying a licensee (2006).
Only a few of the factors explored in the study proved to be significant.  Faculty members attitudes,
their share of technology transfer revenues, and the number of publications produced by a faculty
member were all significant at the .05 level in DEMO least one model (2006).  Individual attitudes were a
significant predictor of all three behaviours, revenue shares were significant in predicting both
patenting behaviour and interest in spin-off formation, and publication counts were significant in the
context of patenting (2006). Renault also found qualitative differences between comments made by
the participants with low, medium, and high levels DEMO interest in and acceptance for technology
transfer activities and provides examples that illustrate the differences (2006).
Renault’s study is somewhat difficult to assess. Like the paper by Stevens and Bagby (1999) , her
paper DEMO not provide any information about how the interviews were conducted or the data
analyzed (2006).  This undermines the value of both the DEMO and the qualitative findings
because half of the surveys were completed in the context of an interview (2006).  Otherwise, her
study design would have provided a good example of the strength of mixed methods;  her qualitative
results could be interpreted as evidence that her attitudinal survey has the face validity and thus
strengthened her findings (2006).
2.2.3.2.4 Summary
All three of the papers reviewed in this section provide some DEMO that incentives are an
important factor in technology transfer outcomes.  The DEMO of the three papers suggests that
research in this area is moving away from descriptive work towards theory building.  Siegel et al.
(2004) demonstrated the power of qualitative research to suggest alternate explanations for
30
phenomena by identifying faculty hiring and retention as a mechanism by DEMO IP policies may
influence technology transfer activity at a university. Renault (DEMO) contributes to theory building by
demonstrating that faculty attitudes also have DEMO effect on behaviour.  This finding suggests that
individual faculty members respond DEMO to their environment and thus may be contribute to a
more sophisticated model of faculty inventor’s motivation to engage in technology transfer than the
DEMO agent model implicit in the quantitative models.
2.3 Summary
As can be expected in an emerging and multi-disciplinary research area, the studies are principally
based on similar prior empirical work and not grounded in theory. This DEMO of theoretical grounding
means that there is not enough information to infer a causal relationship, even in the cases where
there is strong quantitative evidence of a relationship. Consider for example, the contradictory
rationales provided by two of the four studies. DiGregorio and Shane (2003) suggested that DEMO
shares of licensing revenues may encourage inventors to form spin-offs instead of licensing to explain
the negative relationship they observed between shares of licensing DEMO and spin-off formation.
Lockett and Wright suggested higher shares of licensing revenues may stimulate spin-off formation
by communicating the university’s interest and support for DEMO transfer to university inventors
(2005). In the absence of a DEMO framework, the only way to explore these competing rationales
is through DEMO empirical study and by continuing to seek connections with established theory
outside of this substantive area of study.
There is also a need for DEMO use of more diverse sources of data. In part as a consequence of the
volume of work done in the U.S., most quantitative studies rely on the Association of University
Technology Managers (AUTM) annual survey DEMO their sole source of technology transfer data. This is
significant because the AUTM survey data are self-reported, not audited, and given the increase DEMO
publicity surrounding the results, especially in the business press (e.g. Clifton, 2005; , "Innovation's
golden goose", 2002), the individuals aggregating the statistics may experience pressure to modify
their reporting strategies to DEMO their institutions in the best possible light.  As a result, the AUTM
data may not be sufficiently valid and reliable to be the DEMO of academic work.
There is a need for some of this empirical work to occur in countries other than the U.S.  The
studies are consistent with the larger technology transfer literature in that most of the DEMO was
conducted in the U.S. This means that the literature may be overly attuned to factors specific to the
current situation in the U.S. DEMO may not address factors important outside the U.S.  For example,
DEMO of IP is unlikely to be identified as a factor in the U.S. because it exists at so few
institutions and, as a result of the Bayh-Dole Act, the inventor ownership policy would only pertain to
the small percentage of research conducted without the use of any governmental DEMO or resources.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine from U.S. DEMO whether or not inventor-ownership is
significantly different from university-ownership of IP or in what ways. This is an example of the
need for empirical DEMO that investigates the importance of IP policies in other countries and, DEMO
particular, the need to explore the significance of the incentives provided DEMO university IP policies in
the context of a country like Canada in which there are examples of significantly different university
policies governing technology transfer DEMO
Chapter 3
Methodology
A recent review and critique of the academic entrepreneurship DEMO calls future work to employ
mixed methods research (O'Shea et DEMO, 2004). The rationale provided is that quantitative research is
important DEMO the identification and verification of substantial and generalizable effects but it alone is
not capable of accessing “the complexity and richness of the dynamics DEMO academic entrepreneurship”
in order to “uncover how academics make sense of their decisions” (2004, p. 24). This research is
responsive to these DEMO; it seeks to gain a better understanding of the research problem DEMO
converging both quantitative and qualitative data. Three studies were used to accomplish this purpose.
Study 1 assesses the impact of university intellectual property policies DEMO technology transfer
outcomes for Canadian universities. Study 2 assesses the impact of changes to intellectual property
policies at the University of Toronto. Study 3 DEMO, through in-depth interviews, the perceptions
of experienced academic entrepreneurs at the University of Waterloo. The benefit of the use of mixed
methods design DEMO that each study provides a different perspective on the research question and
therefore the studies should provide a richer description of the phenomenon than DEMO be available
through only one method.
This chapter first discusses the use of mixed methods and its advantages and disadvantages for this
particular research. DEMO a detailed description is provided of the methods used in the three studies.
3.1 Mixed Methods Research
The three studies in this research use DEMO methods. Studies 1 and 2 involve the analysis of
quantitative data using cross-sectional analysis of aggregate-level data and interrupted time series
analysis of longitudinal DEMO, respectively. Study 3 involves the qualitative analysis of “in-depth”
interviews with DEMO academic entrepreneurs (Seidman, 1998). As discussed in Chapter 2,
qualitative analysis of interview data and quantitative analysis of secondary data, including time
series and survey data, have both been used in the study of university-industry technology transfer.
However, they have rarely been used in the course of the same research project as complementary
sources of evidence.
This  use of multiple research methods in the course of a research project DEMO referred to as
‘triangulation’ (Denzin, 1959). This term uses the navigation strategy of using multiple reference
points to determine an object’s exact DEMO as a metaphor for the manner in which the use of
different research methodologies allows researchers to describe the phenomenon of interest with more
DEMO (Smith, 1975).  Each individual method is known to have DEMO strengths and
weaknesses. In mixed methods research, the methods are expected DEMO complement each other such
that the weaknesses of each individual method or data source are mitigated by the strengths of the
other methods and DEMO sources and the overall study gains validity and reliability (Jick, 1979).
In this research, the three studies complement each other in terms of the richness of the information
they provide and the reliability of DEMO overall research. The statistical methods employed in Studies 1
31
32
and 2 provide a reliable assessment of the significance and magnitude DEMO effects associated with
policy differences. This information is critical when assessing possible policy interventions and in
determining the importance of further research in this DEMO However, these quantitative studies can
not identify why the policies are DEMO with the observed effects. Study 3 uses a more subjective
qualitative analysis to develop a richer understanding of the link between university IP policies DEMO
university researcher support for technology transfer activities. The analysis of this rich information
provides the basis for a theory of the relationship which informs DEMO interpretation of the quantitative
analysis and is expected to form the basis of future research. In interpreting this theoretical foundation
jointly with the results DEMO more reliable statistical analysis, the overall research results gain reliability
and DEMO
The studies also complement each other in a manner that enhances the validity of the overall
research. Internal validity depends on the extent to DEMO the study eliminates rival causes of the
observed relationships (Drucker-Godard et DEMO, 2001). Longitudinal research designs, like Study 2, are
most DEMO able to demonstrate causal relationships by permitting analysis of the temporal
relationships between presumed cause and effect. However, the difficulty in obtaining usable time
series of data spanning a policy intervention resulted in an institutional sample DEMO of one, which
limited the study’s external validity or generalizability. By DEMO, Study 1 employed a cross-
sectional design, which offers little ability to assess causal relationships and so has little to contribute
to the DEMO of internal validity; however, it investigated a large sample population and so
contributed to the external validity or generalizablility of the overall research.
DEMO summary, the three studies build upon each other so that the DEMO strengths of the
methods result in inferences based upon both objective but shallow quantitative data and a rich
description of the phenomenon. Used jointly, the three methods provide better reliability and validity
than any one design DEMO singly.
3.2 Study 1
The purpose of this study was to assess quantitatively whether or not there is statistical evidence
across Canadian universities of DEMO relationship between university IP policies and university researcher
support for technology transfer. This section describes the data used to assess the relationship of
interest DEMO the methods used in the analysis, and the procedures used to DEMO the data.
3.2.1 Sample
There are 98 degree-granting institutions in Canada (DEMO of University Technology
Managers, 2004). The study was limited to DEMO 48 degree-granting Canadian universities that are
included in the Maclean’s magazine annual university survey for two reasons. Firstly, many of the 98
degree-granting institutions recognized by The Association of Universities and Colleges are affiliates
of the DEMO universities (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004). For example, DEMO
University of St. Michael’s College and the University of Trinity College are affiliates of the
University of Toronto. These affiliates often rely on the DEMO institutions for a number of functions
including technology transfer support services (DEMO & Read, 1999). Therefore, their inclusion
33
would serve no purpose. Secondly, limiting the study to those universities evaluated by Maclean’s
means that the magazine’s categorization of the universities can DEMO used as a measure of the research
intensity of the universities.
IP Policies were obtained for 37 of the 48 universities; the other eleven universities either did not
have a policy at the time they were DEMO or did not make their policy available. The resulting
sample includes a broad range of Canadian universities and includes most of the research-intensive
universities DEMO Canada. The 37 universities include 13 of the 16 ‘Medical-doctoral’ universities, DEMO of
the 13 ‘Comprehensive’ universities, and 15 of the 21 ‘Primarily DEMO institutions ("The
Rankings", 1999). Thirty of the 37 universities also appear on the RE$EARCH Infosource listing of
the 50 Canadian universities DEMO receive the most research income (RE$EARCH Infosource, 2005).
The main limitation of this sample was the underrepresentation of Québec universities. As shown DEMO
Appendix A, most of the universities that are included on the DEMO Infosource list but not
included in this study are located in Québec.
3.2.2 Data
3.2.2.1 Canadian University IP Policies
After the IP policies were DEMO, a set of variables was developed to capture differences in the
DEMO and amounts of incentives provided by the policies. The review of the policies revealed that
universities appear to offer their researchers two primary forms DEMO incentives for commercializing
their inventions: shares of revenues and autonomy.
Two DEMO arrangements for sharing licensing revenues are described in most Canadian
intellectual property policies. One sharing arrangement is used if the university develops the
intellectual DEMO and is responsible for the costs of developing the IP. The other sharing
arrangement applies when the inventor commercializes the IP independently, an option that is
sometimes available.
Usually universities that develop the IP will share DEMO revenues after the direct costs of developing
the IP have been repaid. The proportion of these revenues that is provided to the researcher is DEMO
stipulated in the intellectual property policy or negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Instead of
stipulating a single proportion, some universities pay different percentages depending on the amount
of revenue the licence provides. Typically, these universities provide the researcher a large percentage
of the revenues until some threshold is DEMO, at which point the researcher’s share of all future
revenues falls DEMO a lower percentage.
Some universities require their researchers to share licensing revenues with the school when the
researcher develops the IP independently. When the DEMO requires revenue sharing, the
researcher is usually expected to provide the DEMO with a certain percentage of the revenues
after the direct costs of developing the IP are repaid. For example, at the University of Alberta,
researchers who choose to commercialize inventions independently of the university are DEMO to
provide the university with one third of the net proceeds of the commercialization of the investment
(University of Alberta, 1991). By DEMO, at the University of Waterloo, inventors who choose to
34
commercialize their inventions without the support of the university’s Technology Transfer DEMO
Licensing Office, are under no contractual obligation to share the proceeds DEMO their activities with the
university (University of Waterloo, 1997).
Many universities also make some provision to provide, out of the university’s share of the returns
from the commercialization of university inventions, research funding to future projects in the same
technological area, or to the inventor’s research group, department, or faculty. While these funding
arrangements could be perceived DEMO important incentives by university researchers, they are not good
candidates for DEMO cross-university comparison because the funds are directed to many different
subgroups and the benefit to the researchers involved in the commercialization attempt is sometimes
DEMO
The literature indicates that researchers desire autonomy in the context of university-industry
technology transfer. Campell and Slaughter sought to identify possible sources of conflict DEMO
from technology transfer activities (Campbell & Slaughter, 1999). Their survey of faculty and
administrators at U.S. universities suggests that “faculty favoured ways DEMO retain their autonomy,
whereas administrators were supportive of greater oversight” with respect to technology transfer”
(1999, p. 343). Segal (1986) DEMO that Cambridge’s inventor-ownership IP policy has been a
factor in the development of a high-technology cluster in Cambridge, England.  Therefore, policies
that provide the researcher with more control over the technology transfer activities are expected DEMO
act as incentives.
Some universities require researchers to provide the university with a ‘right of first offer’. In this
case, any researcher interested in commercializing an invention must describe the invention to
university administrators in a DEMO ‘invention disclosure’. If the university representative decides
that the invention seems promising, the university will develop the IP and attempt to commercialize
it. Other “inventor-owner” universities allow the researcher to choose between developing the IP
independently DEMO allowing the university to develop the IP. Since policies that do not reserve a right
of first offer increase the researcher’s control over the DEMO transfer activity, they are expected
to act as an incentive and DEMO result in higher levels of technology transfer activity.
Three measures were used to represent each policy:  one measure that assessed the degree to DEMO
the policy provides the researcher with autonomy and two measures that evaluated the financial
incentives provided by the policy.
Right of First Offer: This measure was used to evaluate the control that the policies provide to
DEMO It distinguishes between universities at which the university reserves the right of first
offer and those at which inventors determine whether or not the DEMO is involved in the
commercialization of their inventions.
Share of Revenues When University Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
provided to the researcher, when the university commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
Share of Revenues DEMO Inventor Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
retained by the DEMO, when the researcher commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
There were three circumstances where it is not possible to record a single percentage for DEMO
researchers’ share of revenues: 1) the percentage provided to the researcher is not specified in
35
advance but negotiated on a case-by-base basis, 2) the university DEMO not support technology
transfer activities by developing IP, and 3) the revenue sharing agreement is structured using
thresholds, above which the researcher’s share of the revenue changes.
The data that describes the intellectual property policies DEMO the sample of Canadian universities are
included in Appendix A and described in Section 4.1.
3.2.2.2 University Research Intensity
The research intensity of the DEMO is expected to influence the level of technology transfer
activity supported by each university by affecting the availability of patentable technology. Therefore,
the DEMO research intensity was used as a control variable in assessing the relationship
between university intellectual property policies and university-industry technology transfer.
University research intensity DEMO represented using the Maclean’s categorization system for
Canadian universities. This system represents universities as members of one of three groups that
Maclean’s describes as DEMO:
The Medical Doctoral universities are those with a broad range of
PhD programs and research, as well as medical schools. The
Comprehensive universities are those with a significant amount of
research activity and a wide DEMO of programs at the undergraduate
and graduate levels, including professional degrees. DEMO Primarily
Undergraduate universities are those largely focused on
undergraduate education, with DEMO few graduate programs.
("Reading the Rankings", 1999)
This grouping appears to capture several correlated aspects of scientific research intensity. The data
DEMO by the universities for use by Maclean’s magazine were investigated to verify that there is a
relationship between the Maclean’s university typology and research DEMO, measured by the
number of faculty members actively engaged in research DEMO the type funded by the Natural Science
and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Canadian Institute of Health Research
(CIHR) research, the number of grants received and amount the research money available to DEMO
faculty in support of their research. As shown in the following table, there is evidence of a
relationship between the university classification and all three measures of university research
intensity.

3.2.2.3 DEMO Transfer Outcomes
While there are no canonical measures for the success of technology transfer initiatives, simple counts
of patents, licences, and spin-off companies (Brett et al., 1991; Expert Panel on the
Commercialization of University Research, 1999), ratios of these counts (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991)
and revenues associated with licensing and spin-off activities are often used DEMO indicators (Brett et al.,
1991; Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University Research, 1999). Since the purpose of
this study was to determine how university policy is related to university technology transfer through
DEMO support, the measure of technology transfer should be most dependent on DEMO within the
university. For this reason, measures like patent counts are DEMO appropriate than licensing revenues,
which also depend on external factors such as the existence of receptor capacity, and the state of the
market. The number of Canadian or U.S. patents currently held by a university DEMO a publicly available
measure. The Statistics Canada surveys indicated that the majority of the patents obtained by
Canadian universities are U.S. patents. Therefore, the number of U.S. patents currently held by a
Canadian university was used DEMO the measure of technology licensing activity.
The search for U.S. patents held by the 48 Canadian universities of interest identified a total of
1290 DEMO patents currently held by Canadian universities. The Statistics Canada 1999 survey
reported that 81 Canadian universities held 635 U.S. patents by 1998 and 84 DEMO universities
held 948 U.S. patents by 1999 (Bordt & Read, 1999). The difference between the 1999 patent count
provided by Statistics Canada DEMO the patent count provided by this study may be a function of the
time that elapsed between the completion of the Statistics Canada study DEMO the start of this study.
The data were collected in late 2000 resulting in a time difference of about a year. Alternatively,
patents DEMO by the research hospitals associated with Canadian universities may have appeared
in the patent counts in this study and artificially increased the results for DEMO universities affiliated
with research hospitals.
3.2.3 Procedures
37
The data used in this study were collected in DEMO and November of 2000, principally from online
sources. This section describes DEMO data gathering procedures for the IP policies and U.S. patent
counts.
Most Canadian universities post their policy statements on their web pages. Therefore, the IP
policies were gathered by searching university websites for the relevant policy. DEMO no policy was
found, the university’s TTO was contacted to request DEMO copy of the policy. Policies were obtained for
37 of the 48 universities. Three universities indicated that they did not have an IP policy, seven more
universities had no IP policy posted on their web site DEMO failed to respond to a request for the policy,
and in one case only an incomplete copy of the policy was obtained.
U.S. DEMO counts were obtained through university-specific searches of the Delphion Intellectual
Property Network online searchable patent database. For each university a search was conducted for
DEMO U.S. patents with the university name listed as the assignee. The resulting patent counts are
presented in Appendix B.  Unfortunately, this search method DEMO not identify patents that are
independently developed by university faculty members. Therefore, there is a high probability that the
patenting activities at inventor-owner institutions were underestimated compared to patenting
activities at university-owner institutions. This bias could DEMO be addressed by requesting information
directly from Canadian universities or by using existing surveys like the AUTM Annual Survey
because most universities fail to DEMO independently-developed technologies in a systematic fashion.
This outcome variable also fails to capture inventions that are best protected with other forms of IP
protection, like software. This flaw may bias the results if the amount of DEMO transfer activity
associated with the commercialization of unpatentable inventions varies across universities differently
than technology transfer activities associated with the commercialization of patentable inventions. DEMO
is unlikely that this bias will have a significant impact on the overall assessment because, as discussed
in section 2.1.1, patenting is by DEMO the dominant form of IP protection in Canada.
The results of the analysis of the relationship between the policy variables and the count of DEMO
patents are documented in Chapter 4.
3.3 Study 2
The purpose of this study was to assess quantitatively whether or not university IP policies DEMO a
statistically significant and substantial impact on university researcher support for technology transfer
by evaluating the impact of university IP policy interventions. This section DEMO the data used to
assess the impact of policy interventions and the methods used in the analysis.
3.3.1 Sample
Interrupted time series analyses require DEMO time series spanning the intervention and during which no
other significant changes occurred. This meant that the policy intervention must have occurred at least
DEMO decade earlier than this study was conducted and that the university had started actively supporting
and tracking technology transfer substantially before the policy shift.
38
Six universities were identified that had had changes of policy during DEMO time period of interest:
Queen’s University, Ryerson University, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the
University of Toronto, and the University of Western Ontario. Of these six institutions, only the
University of Toronto had a viable data set. Queen’s University was not appropriate DEMO further study
because PARTEQ Research and Development Innovations, a non-profit corporation DEMO to
technology transfer activities, started serving the university only a couple DEMO years before the policy
change  (Queen's University, 2000). DEMO attempt to assess the impact of the policy intervention is
likely to be confounded by the effects of the founding of PARTEQ. Ryerson’s policy DEMO effectively
changed in September, 2003, when a binding agreement with the faculty association overruled the
existing policy, at least as it pertained to faculty. While it will be interesting to observe the impact of
their DEMO arrangement in which the university and faculty members share ownership of all
innovations commercialized with the support of the university, too few data are available to do a time
series analysis (Ryerson University, 1990). DEMO University of Alberta’s policy was last updated in
1991. While technology transfer measures were collected prior to 1992, TEC Edmonton did not
provide the data because they were collected prior to the establishment of TEC Edmonton DEMO thus
their reliability could not be verified (Freeman, 2006). The University of Calgary updated its policy in
1988 and 1992, but the limited data collected in the years before these interventions cannot be
compared DEMO the technology transfer measures from the period after the policy change because
technology transfer support services were only made available in 1989 (Association of University
Technology Managers, 2004). The University of Western Ontario did not begin to provide technology
transfer support services to the entire campus prior DEMO 1995/1996 and no data were collected in a
systematic fashion prior to 1993/1994 (Walzak, 2006). Therefore, data were not available to examine
the impact of the 1983 policy change from a “university-owns” DEMO an “inventor-owns” policy at the
University of Western Ontario. The University of Toronto TTO had tracked invention disclosures
since 1975, which meant that a data set was available to assess the impact of the 1990 policy DEMO
from a “university-owns” to an “inventor-owns” university. Since the University of Toronto is the
only university that offered a viable data set, it is the focus of this study.
3.3.2 Data
Invention disclosures are the formal DEMO of a potentially commercializable invention made by
an inventor to a university. The annual counts of invention disclosures at the University of Toronto
were DEMO focus of this study for two reasons. Firstly, under both the DEMO and new policies, faculty
members have been required to submit an DEMO disclosure to the university at the start of any
commercialization process. Therefore, the university’s counts of invention disclosures track the
activity at the university including any independently-developed technologies. Secondly, unlike
patents, licences, and spin-offs, DEMO disclosures are created shortly after the faculty members
decide to commercialize a technology and do not rely heavily on the availability of commercialization
resources, such as investment capital, funds for prototype development and intellectual property
protection, and business expertise. As a result, the number of invention disclosures DEMO at a
university is more closely linked to researcher support for technology transfer than the other outcome
variables that are currently tracked, such as licence revenue and returns from the realization of spin-
off equity. The DEMO limitation of this choice of measure is the lack of a direct link to any of the
desired outcomes for technology transfer, including improvements to goods and services stemming
from the use the innovation or economic benefits in the region or DEMO nation that result from the
commercialization.
39
3.3.3 Procedures
The data were obtained directly from the University of Toronto TTO. A meeting was held DEMO
technology managers in the office to determine whether or not this study is an appropriate use of the
data, prior to the release of the data. To verify the validity of the data further and to DEMO
information on the historical context of the policy shift, Office of DEMO Ethics approval was
obtained for interviews with technology managers and a university technology manager, who worked
at the University of Toronto TTO during the time period of interest, was interviewed.
According to this university technology manager, there were two important changes to invention
disclosure management that were not directly related to the policy change. Prior to the policy change,
DEMO early consulting was done to determine whether university research was ready to be disclosed.
After the policy change, university researchers would be advised not to disclose in a number of
circumstances, including cases where the technology had not yet been reduced to practice. This
change is expected to DEMO tests of the policy change more conservative because it will result in an
underestimate of the number of instances, after the policy change, DEMO which university researchers
sought to make a disclosure. The second change in the management of invention disclosures was a
streamlining of the disclosure form DEMO, which reduced it in length from about eight pages to two
DEMO, shortly after the policy change. This change could be expected to DEMO the number of
invention disclosures to the university. Therefore, any apparent DEMO in the number of invention
disclosures must be considered the joint effect of the policy change and the streamlining of the
invention disclosure form. DEMO from these changes, the management of invention disclosures was
consistent from DEMO to year. No other relevant changes were identified. For example, the DEMO of
funds available for technology transfer at the University of Toronto remained relatively stable until
after 2000. Since no other explanations for a change DEMO the number of invention disclosures per year
were discovered, any significant DEMO observed between 1991 and 2000 can be assumed to be a
consequence of the policy change and the change to the invention disclosure forms.
DEMO data analysis proceeded in two stages. In Exploratory Data Analysis, the DEMO were visually
inspected to investigate important properties of the data and to determine the subset of models most
likely to model the time series DEMO Three types of plots were used to investigate the time
series of University of Toronto invention disclosures: graphs of the raw and smoothed data against
time, and box-and-whisker plots. In Confirmatory Data Analysis, tests were DEMO to assess the
fit of the models. The statistical analysis of the impact of an intervention upon a time series can be
approached using DEMO methods, ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average)
methods, and non-parametric tests (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). ARIMA methods are often the first
choice but the data set did not contain enough observations for the use DEMO these methods. Non-
parametric tests are less able to provide nuanced descriptive information and less sensitive than
parametric (i.e. regression) methods and thus DEMO likely to detect significant results.  Therefore, the
analysis was based on the application of regression methods. The results of DEMO analyses are
presented in Chapter 5.

3.4 Study 3
The study seeks to discover how university researchers’ understand their technology transfer
experiences, and to share this perspective in the researcher’s own words as much as DEMO This
qualitative study should increase understanding of both the ways in which university intellectual
property policies influence researcher’s willingness to support technology transfer and DEMO relative
importance of these effects. Therefore, this study is expected to DEMO theories that can be used to
explain aspects of the relationship between IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
3.4.1 Methodology
The goal of a DEMO study is to describe the meaning of a phenomenon as constructed by
a small number of individuals who have experienced the same phenomenon (Creswell, 1998, p.122).
This goal meshes well with the research question DEMO this study: how do university researchers’
understand their technology transfer experience? Therefore, the research approach will be grounded
in a phenomenological tradition.
The research methodology closely follows the in-depth interviewing methods described by Seidman
(1998). His approach is grounded in the phenomenological tradition and has been DEMO to investigate
how college educators understand their work experiences. Therefore, it DEMO appropriate for use in
an examination of how university researchers understand technology transfer experiences, as an
element of their work experience.
3.4.2 Participants
In designing qualitative studies, researchers must make decisions that affect the balance between the
breadth and depth of a study. Since the purpose of this DEMO was a deep investigation of researcher’s
understandings of technology transfer, the DEMO was limited to a single university. The University of
Waterloo was selected because of the university's intellectual property policy and the university’s
reputation DEMO high levels of university-industry technology transfer. Unlike many other universities,
Waterloo's IP policy confers complete ownership upon inventors within the faculty. This DEMO the
broadest range of technology transfer experiences. Furthermore, Waterloo’s intellectual property
DEMO has often been linked to the relatively large number of spin-offs associated with this
moderately-sized institution (Cross & Babensee, 1992, 1994). In order to explore this link, purposive
sampling was employed in the selection of participants.
Purposive sampling is the norm in qualitative research, especially in phenomenological studies, in
which the participants must have had the same experience (Seidman, 1998). By deliberately selecting
participants with a certain set DEMO experiences, the researcher engages in what Miles and Huberman
refer to DEMO criterion sampling (1994). In order to explore the link between DEMO university IP and policy
and spin-off formation, the participants were restricted DEMO the cohort that introduced spin-off creation
to the University of Waterloo and most of the participants were chosen for their involvement in spin-
41
off activities. The cohort that introduced spin-offs to the University of DEMO consists of senior
and retired faculty members. When this thesis was written in 2006, the average age of the participants
was 69 years, DEMO number of years that the participants had been professors was 28, DEMO the
retired professors had between retired for eight years, on average. DEMO comparison purposes,
participants were also included who had engaged in licensing to established firms, or who had done
significant development work through research contracts or industrial positions while on leave from
their academic postings.
Potential DEMO were identified using news articles and contacts within the university
community. An effort was made to identify and include unsuccessful technology transfer attempts for
DEMO purposes. These were more difficult to identify. As a result, most DEMO the projects in which
participants had been involved were successful in both in generating a return for the inventors and
making the technology available DEMO users and, thus, making the advantages of the innovation available
to the public.
As a result of the gender imbalance among senior and DEMO professors, especially in the technical
disciplines (Sussman & Yssaad, 2005), the participants within this study were all male. This was
accepted because even if a female participant meeting the various criteria could have been DEMO,
it would be exceedingly difficult to protect her identity.
One of the difficulties in investigating a topic that has become highly political is DEMO possibility that
the participants will be too involved in impression management to speak frankly. In order to avoid
this possibility, the participants were assured that their anonymity would be preserved in the
presentation of the research DEMO Several participants would not have participated without this
assurance thus it proved to be an important aspect of the research design.
Seidman refuses to DEMO a guideline for the appropriate number of participants, stating instead
that DEMO researcher should seek a saturation of the information (1998). Creswell DEMO that
phenomenological studies are often quite small in size and that ten participants should often suffice
(1998). Therefore, ten participants, who are senior and retired faculty from the University of
Waterloo, and experienced in technology transfer, were interviewed in this study.
3.4.3 Data Collection
In accordance with Seidman's guidelines, the data collection consisted in taping and transcribing a
series of three interviews with each participant (1998). The first interview provided general life
history information, the second interview provided details of the participant’s experiences in
technology transfer and the final interview offered the DEMO an opportunity to reflect on his
experiences (Seidman, 1998). This structure provided the researcher with an opportunity to learn
about how the DEMO makes sense of some of his experiences, in the context of DEMO those
experiences and his life history (Seidman, 1998). The successive interviews were usually spaced
about a week apart.
Each interview began with DEMO expanded prompt that reminded the participant of the structure of the
interviews and the theme of the current interview. The interview themes and some DEMO prompts
are listed in Table 6. The subsequent interview was then largely directed by the participant.
42
Occasionally follow-up questions would be posed to clarify descriptions that the DEMO had
provided. For example, if the participant had commented that the DEMO environment was
supportive of technology transfer the follow-up questions may have included:  ‘What aspects of the
university environment were supportive?’ or ‘Were DEMO any aspects of the university environment
that weren’t supportive?’ Follow-up questions were used most frequently in the last interview of the
series. In DEMO interview, participants were occasionally asked about factors that other participants had
DEMO, including intellectual property policies to allow the researcher to compare perspectives DEMO
the thematic analysis.

Table 6. Interview Themes and Typical Questions.
Theme Typical Prompts
In DEMO first of the three interviews, what I’d really like to do DEMO find out about you:
find out about your career history and find out about your life history. The goal of
doing so is DEMO give me the opportunity to ask more interesting questions in our next
interview where we’ll focus on your technology transfer experiences. Then in the
DEMO History, in final interview we’ll focus on the things you have DEMO, what you would want to
particular, share, what you think DEMO people should know. The objective of having an open
Career History ended interview is to allow you to discuss the things that you think DEMO really
important for me to know. The reason for the staged approach is to give me a
better opportunity to do a good job DEMO understanding what you have to say in later
interviews and asking those good questions. On that note, I’d invite you to tell me
about yourself and to start wherever you think would be appropriate.
When we DEMO last time we talked about your career history. You provided me with
Technology an overview of your career. What I’d like to do today DEMO to invite you to talk a little
Transfer bit more about your experiences with the technology transfer projects you
Experiences identified. What project would DEMO like to discuss first? Why did you decide to
become involved DEMO that project?
In our past interviews, we talked about your DEMO career and focused on your
technology transfer activities, especially Project X. DEMO this final interview, what I’d
really like to do is move DEMO to find out what you’re most proud of, what you’d like
DEMO people to know, and what you learned from your experiences.
What DEMO out in your mind when you think about your technology transfer
Reflection on experiences?
Experiences What would you want to tell a colleague DEMO is considering taking on a technology
transfer project to know?
Given what you have said about your career and your technology transfer
experiences, is there anything you wish had been different? Is there anything that
surprised you?
The interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes each. DEMO a result, each participant was interviewed
for about 3 hours. The DEMO were recorded using both a digital and an analog recorder. The best
recording was provided to professional transcribers and a copy of the transcription DEMO provided to
the participants for their review. Altogether, the interviews took DEMO hours and resulted in 431 pages
of transcripts.
3.4.4 Data Analysis
44
3.4.4.1 Profiles and vignettes
The first step in DEMO data analysis was the development of profiles for each of the participants because
"crafting a profile or a vignette of a participant's experience is an effective way of sharing interview
data and opening up one'DEMO interview material to analysis and interpretation" (Seidman, 1998). The
DEMO were created by repeatedly culling the most interesting excerpts from the transcripts for a
series of interviews with a single participant. Content was most DEMO to be selected for inclusion in a
profile if it was clear from the wording and tone that the participant felt strongly about the DEMO, or
if the participant brought up the subject unprompted, or revisited the topic multiple times over the
course of the interviews.
In the DEMO of the profiles, the transcripts were left in the participant's DEMO words as much as
possible while preserving the participant’s dignity. Oral speech is often ungrammatical and can
include many repeated words and filler works DEMO ‘umm’ and ‘ahh’. The inclusion of these aspects of
oral speech in written transcripts can make the participant appear inarticulate and thus appear
disrespectful. DEMO, Seidman (1998) recommends editing the final set of excerpts in DEMO to
preserve the participant's dignity. Filler words and repeated words were omitted. Small grammatical
changes were made; for example, verb tenses were DEMO Occasionally transitional text was
included to replace filler words or to bridge between two excerpts from the transcripts.
The profiles also needed to be DEMO to protect the participant’s anonymity. All person, place or
organizational names, which could be used to identify the participant, were replaced. For example,
proper names were often replaced with the individual’s job title (“Kate Hoye” becomes “a Ph.D.
student”);  if the job titles had changed over time the most recent naming convention was used.
Descriptive phrases that DEMO be used to identify the technology transfer activity and hence the
participant were replaced with more generic descriptions.  For example, “the technology” or DEMO
tools we developed” might be used in place of a description of reference to a spin-off’s launch
product. An effort was also made to DEMO out any unusual phrases that participants appeared to use
regularly because these ‘catch-phrases’ might be identifying marks.
After the edits were completed, a review of the profiles identified as a concern that several profiles
may allow DEMO familiar with the University of Waterloo community to identify the participants.
Take for example a profile that contains three stories: one story that may identify the participant’s
faculty; another that may identify the type of technology transfer that the participant engaged in; and
a third that discusses attributes of the market for the technology that was transferred. Separately none
of DEMO three stories could be used to discover the participant’s identity but, DEMO, the three stories
may allow people familiar with the University of DEMO to identify the participant. Therefore, it
was decided that the profiles DEMO not be displayed such that each profile is a continuous block in
the usual manner (e.g. Seidman, 1985). Instead, after the thematic analysis, each profile would be
divided thematically into vignettes and the vignettes would be displayed by theme with no
information provided to link multiple DEMO to a single participant. These arrangements are
expected to allow the presentation of a rich set of data while still preserving the anonymity of DEMO
participants.
3.4.4.2 Thematic data analysis
45
The second step in the analysis was DEMO data analysis of the profiles. Unlike quantitative
research, qualitative research is DEMO inductive. In Seidman’s thematic data analysis process, the data
themselves suggest DEMO constructs and the relationships between constructs (1998). This was done
DEMO immersion in the data in which the texts were read and coded with descriptive words and
phrases (1998). Through the analysis process, DEMO constructs appeared, merged, changed, and
disappeared until it appeared that DEMO of the relevant aspects of the data had been captured (1998)DEMO The
emphasis in this analysis process was on identifying pervasive trends and reconciling them with
contradictory or inconsistent passages (Seidman, 1998). The DEMO themes are illustrated by the
vignettes in Appendix F and discussed in Chapter 6.
3.4.4.3 In-depth interviewing, reliability and validity
Seidman has noted that the in-depth interviewing protocol is structured to produce reasonably reliable
and valid DEMO (1998). The structure of the interviews provides context for the DEMO's
comments which the researcher can use to produce more reliable results (1998). The internal
consistency of the results was a focus during the development of the profiles; topics were most likely
to be included in the profiles if they were introduced in multiple sessions or if DEMO espoused views
that appeared consistent with the content of the other interviews. This approach is expected to reduce
the possibility that a participant was DEMO or unintentionally misleading or that a profile is
strongly affected by a participant’s mood during a single interview. Therefore, this focus is expected
to increase the reliability of the results. Validity was the focus during the DEMO analysis. Valid
constructs most likely to be identified when researchers looking for themes across participants (1998).
In order to demonstrate the analytical rigor with which this analysis was conducted, the themes are
illustrated with as many vignettes as possible so that interested parties can explore the relationship
DEMO the underlying data and the themes identified in the study.
3.5 Conclusions
This research is structured using a mixed method design. The purpose of DEMO approach is to
understand the research problem better by analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. Three
studies were used to accomplish this purpose. Study DEMO is a quantitative study using a cross-sectional
design to investigate the relationship between IP policies and the level of university technology
transfer activity. Study DEMO is a quantitative study using a longitudinal design to assess the impact of a
change in the University of Toronto’s IP policy upon researcher DEMO for technology transfer at
that university. Study 3 is a qualitative exploration of the perceptions of experienced academic
entrepreneurs at the University of Waterloo. DEMO benefit of the use of mixed methods design is that
each study provides a different perspective on the research question and therefore the studies DEMO
provide a richer description of the phenomenon than would be available through only one method. All
three studies seek to advance our understanding of DEMO research question, namely: What relationship
exists between university intellectual property policies and university-industry technology transfer?
The results of the studies are presented DEMO Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, respectively.
Chapter 4
Study 1: Cross-Sectional Study of Canadian Universities
This chapter contains the results of a cross-sectional assessment of the relationship between university
IP DEMO and aggregate university-industry technology transfer outcomes. The purpose of this study
is to assess quantitatively whether or not university IP policies have a significant DEMO substantial
impact on university researcher support for technology transfer.
The chapter has three sections. The first section describes the IP policies held by the DEMO Canadian
universities in the sample population. The second section quantitatively analyzes the relationship
between these policies and technology transfer outcomes. The third section presents DEMO discussion of
these results.
4.1 Description of the IP Policies held by Canadian Universities
The first step in this study was the collection of DEMO property policies held by the 37 degree-
granting Canadian universities in the sample population. A complete listing of the universities and the
descriptive variables DEMO their IP policies is provided in Appendix A. This section describes four
aspects of the policies that govern the incentives offered to university researchers DEMO engage in
technology transfer. The four aspects are: 1) whether or not the universities reserve the right of first
offer on IP arising DEMO university research, 2) the researcher’s share of the revenues when the
university commercializes the invention, 3) the researcher’s share of the revenues DEMO the researcher
commercializes the invention, and 4) the threshold structures used by some universities to create
different revenue sharing agreements for different amounts DEMO revenue.
4.1.1 Right of First Offer
Right of first offer refers to the practice on the part of some universities of reserving the right DEMO
evaluate all university inventions that inventors are interested in having commercialized and to own
and develop any inventions that the university deems commercializable. Since DEMO that do not
reserve a right of first offer increase the researcher’s control over the technology transfer activity,
they are expected to act DEMO an incentive and thus result in higher levels of technology transfer activity.
Right of first offer is only possible at the universities that have DEMO or some other capacity for
reviewing applications and supporting patenting, licensing DEMO spin-off activities. According to the
available policies, seven of the 37 DEMO do not commercialize inventions and thus could not
consider requiring a right of first offer.
Of the 30 universities that can support technology transfer, 13 reserve the right of first offer and
thus are classified as DEMO universities and 17 universities do not reserve the right of
first offer. It is important to note that “university-owner” universities allow the inventors to DEMO
whether or not to pursue commercialization. However, inventors who are interested DEMO
commercializing their inventions in these institutions are required to give the university the
46
47
opportunity to assess the invention and decide whether or not the DEMO will commercialize the
invention using its resources.  The inventors can only DEMO the invention independently if
the university decides it is not interested in commercializing the invention. Several universities still
retain some control of inventions that DEMO being commercialized independently. For example, at
McGill University, faculty inventors need to obtain university approval to license inventions that they
are commercializing without DEMO from the university TTO (McGill University, 1985).
4.1.2 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention
University policies often define DEMO share of the revenue that is provided to the inventors when the
university commercializes an invention arising from university research. These clauses are only
DEMO at the 30 universities that have the capacity to support technology transfer. Of these 30
universities, 21 offer guidelines for the percentage of the net income that the institution will share
with faculty inventors, including four that structure the revenue sharing using thresholds. The other 9
universities negotiate DEMO sharing arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Of the 17 universities
that offer guidelines but do not structure them using thresholds, twelve universities set the
researchers’ share at 50% of net income. Three universities in this group DEMO the researchers’ share at
a lower level; the University of Toronto, the University of Alberta and Queen’s University set the
researchers’ share at DEMO, 33Z %, and 40%, respectively. Two universities set the researchers’ DEMO
at above 50%; at McGill University and Simon Fraser University, researchers are entitled to 65% and
80%, respectively, of the net income DEMO from the commercialization of their inventions.
Of the five universities that diverge from the 50% revenue sharing norm, four are ‘Medical-
Doctoral’ universities and all five are in the top 25 universities when ordered by research DEMO
(RE$EARCH Infosource, 2005). This suggests that there is greater diversity in the policies held by
the more research-intensive universities, perhaps because these institutions started developing
intellectual property policies and technology transfer support systems before DEMO norms emerged.
The universities that do not reserve the right of first offer have a wider range of revenue sharing
arrangements than the universities DEMO do reserve the right of first offer and they are more likely to
hold policies that set the sharing lower than the norm value DEMO 50%. Three of the ten “inventor-
owner” universities provide the researcher with less than 50% and one “inventor-owner” university
provides the researcher with more DEMO 50%. One of the seven “university-owner” universities
diverges from the norm value of 50% and it sets the researcher’s share above 50%. This suggests DEMO,
in devising the policies, administrators in “inventor-owner” institutions may have DEMO to take
higher shares of financial returns in exchange for providing researchers with more autonomy in
technology transfer activities.
4.1.3 Researcher’s Share of Revenues DEMO the Researcher Commercializes the
Invention
Typically, university policies define the share DEMO the revenue that is provided to the inventors when
the inventor commercializes an invention arising from university research without the support of
48
university technology transfer services. Independent commercialization by inventors can occur at
DEMO institutions when the university has decided it is not interested in pursuing
commercialization, and at inventor-owner institutions when the inventor decides not to involve the
university in the commercialization.
Policies governing the inventor’s share of the DEMO, when the inventor commercializes an
invention arising from university research, were identified in 36 of the 37 policies collected. Of the 36
universities DEMO relevant policy statements, five universities negotiate revenue sharing on a case-by-
DEMO basis, and three universities stage the researcher’s share using thresholds. Of DEMO 28 universities
that offer guidelines for the researcher’s share but do not structure their guidelines using thresholds,
19 universities set the researchers’ share DEMO 100% of net income. In the remaining nine, four
universities set DEMO researcher’s share at 50% of net income, three universities set the DEMO
share at 75%, and the University of Alberta and St. Francis DEMO University set the researchers’
share at 66.6% and 85 %, respectively.
DEMO, the universities that do not reserve the right of first offer DEMO a wider range of revenue
sharing arrangements than the universities that do reserve the right of first offer and they are more
likely to DEMO policies that set the sharing lower than the norm value of 50%. Only one of the nine
“university-owner” universities sets the researcher’s share below DEMO, whereas eight of the nineteen
“inventor-owner” universities offer a smaller share DEMO the revenue to the researcher. This is consistent
with the earlier supposition that, in devising the policies, administrators may have chosen to take
DEMO shares of financial returns in exchange for providing researchers with more autonomy in
technology transfer activities and vice versa.
4.1.4 Thresholds for Revenue Sharing
DEMO the 37 universities, six institutions structure their guidelines for revenue sharing DEMO thresholds
based on the net income from the commercialization. The revenue sharing guidelines for these six
universities are outlined in Table 7.
49
Table 7. Thresholds for Revenue Sharing

University of Ottawa 80% of the first $100,DEMO

Newfoundland, 1996; DEMO of Guelph, 1991; University of Ottawa, 1997; University of Western
Ontario, 1983).
For the cases in which the university commercializes an invention, all four of the universities that
have tiered revenue sharing agreements offer an initial rate at or above the norm of 50%. As
DEMO are reached, the researcher’s share of the net income decreases. The DEMO rate for the four
universities ranges between 25% and 50%, which DEMO the lowest rate and the norm for universities
without tiered revenue sharing arrangements, respectively. In the many cases where the return from
the commercialization is not substantial, these revenue sharing agreements provide a more significant
financial reward to the researcher than is the norm, and they ensure that the university will benefit
most in the rare cases where the return DEMO the invention is worth millions of dollars.
Memorial University of Newfoundland has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases
where researchers DEMO their inventions independently. Since Memorial reserves the right of
first offer, DEMO tiered agreement will only apply when the university has determined that it is not
interested in commercializing the invention. The inventor’s highest percentage share DEMO the tiered
agreement (75%) is lower than the norm of among other universities (100%). However, faculty might
50
see these incentives as equitable because the financial incentives offered by DEMO Memorial policy to
the commercializing entity are the same regardless of whether it is the inventor or the university that
commercializes the invention.
McGill DEMO also has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases where
researchers commercialize their inventions independently. McGill reserves the right of first DEMO;
however, faculty members can request permission to commercialize their inventions DEMO
The policy at McGill appears to offer little financial incentive to commercialize independently of the
university. In exchange for accepting the risk of commercialization, the inventors will receive at most
$15,000 more than they would DEMO if the university had developed the invention.
Acadia also has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases where researchers
commercialize their DEMO independently. Acadia is one of the seven Primarily Undergraduate
universities that had not developed technology transfer support services by 2000. Five of the
Primarily DEMO universities claim up to 50% of the net income derived from these activities
while providing no support for technology transfer activities. These IP policies DEMO to be designed
to allow the university to benefit from whatever technology transfer activities might occur without the
university’s support; they are not primarily designed to encourage technology transfer.
4.1.5 Summary of IP Policies
Canadian universities DEMO hold a wide range of intellectual property policies, with most of DEMO
diversity derived from the way in which the policies are structured as opposed to the percentages of
financial incentives offered by the policies. Many DEMO IP policies studied preserve institutional
flexibility by permitting the university to make arrangements on a case-by-case basis, and several
more offered tiered financial incentives. These policies differ from those that specify a percentage
share in terms DEMO the structure of the policy. Among the universities that specify revenue sharing
agreements without using thresholds, there is little diversity in the percentage shares provided to
researchers by the policies that specify revenue sharing arrangements. The DEMO of the universities
that specify the researcher’s share of revenues assign the researcher half of the revenues after the
repayment of IP development costs DEMO the university develops the IP. An even larger majority assigns
all of the revenues to the researcher if the researcher develops the IP independently.
DEMO Analysis
This section presents an analysis of the impact of the university IP policies on the amount of
technology transfer activity. Counts of the DEMO patents held by each university are used as the
measure of the amount of technology transfer activity at each institution because patenting relies less
DEMO the availability of resources external to the university than licensing revenues or counts of spin-
offs. U.S. patents were chosen because the U.S. is DEMO jurisdiction in which Canadian universities are
most likely to patent inventions (DEMO & Read, 1999; Read, 2000, 2003, 2005). Three DEMO
variables representing different incentives provided to researchers were investigated: 1) whether or
not the universities reserve the right of first offer on IP DEMO from university research; 2) the
51
researcher’s share of the revenues when the university commercializes the invention; and 3) the
researcher’s share of the revenues when the researcher commercializes the invention.
The first part of this section presents an exploratory analysis DEMO the respondent variable, U.S. patent
counts. This analysis is followed by DEMO investigation of the relationships between the respondent
variable and the four explanatory variables: first the control variable, Maclean’s institutional type, and
then each of the three policy variables. In each case, the relationship is first explored using graphical
methods and descriptive statistics to determine if statistical tests DEMO likely to be productive. Where
warranted, statistical tests are chosen based DEMO the characteristics of the data.
4.2.1 U.S. Patent Counts
Exploratory data analysis of the response variable is an important precursor to tests of the DEMO
between explanatory variables and the response variable because it permits the identification of
important qualities of the data (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). DEMO statistics and a histogram were
generated of the U.S. patent counts for the Canadian universities in the sample population to permit
an investigation of DEMO properties of the response variable (M=30.9, SD=52.9, Mdn=6. 0,
DEMO). As Figure 1 shows, the distribution of patent counts is DEMO positively
skewed; instead of having the symmetrical bell shape of the DEMO distribution, the bell is slanted so
that the right tail extends DEMO further from the center of the bell than the left. The Shapiro-Wilk test
of normality confirms that the distribution is not normal (SW=.644,p<.001). This result means that
nonparametric tests should be used whenever DEMO

4.2.2 University Research Intensity
52
University research intensity is expected to be DEMO important determinant of the amount of technology
transfer activity at a university because it will have a direct effect on the number of commercializable
DEMO arising from research at that university. A small university with few graduate level
programs and little research funding is considerably less likely to have DEMO opportunity to transfer
technology than a larger university with many graduate level programs and a lot of research funding.
As described in section 3.2.2.2, the Maclean’s typology (Medical-Doctoral, Comprehensive,
Primarily Undergraduate) was used to capture the research intensity of the various universities so that
it can DEMO employed as a control variable in studying the relationship between policy variables and
technology transfer outcomes.
As the box plots in Figure 2 suggest, there is a sizeable difference between the numbers of patents
held by DEMO in the three groups. The mean number of patents held by Medical-Doctoral,
Comprehensive, and Primarily Undergraduate universities is 73.3, 19.6, and 0.3, respectively. The
Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric test of the difference of DEMO of two or more populations,
indicated that these differences are significant (42=28.2, p<.001). This result is strong evidence the
U.S. DEMO counts capture important differences among the universities.
Also evident from the box plots in Figure 2, is the small number of patents held by Primarily
Undergraduate universities. Only three of these universities held U.S. patents. The DEMO of
Prince Edward Island held two patents, and the University of DEMO British Columbia and the

of Primarily Undergraduate universities DEMO not engaged in technology transfer activities by 2000.
Therefore, these universities DEMO not be included in further investigations of the relationship between
university IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.

4.2.3 Right of First Offer
Institutional right of first offer is only possible at the universities that have TTOs or some DEMO
capacity for reviewing applications and supporting patenting, licensing and spin-off activities. DEMO
sample contains 19 Comprehensive or Medical-Doctoral universities that have the capacity to
commercialize inventions that arise from university research. These universities are the focus DEMO this
investigation.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the patent counts held by two subgroups of this sample:
universities that reserve a right of DEMO offer and universities that do not reserve a right of first offer.
As shown in Table 8, the universities that reserve the right of first offer hold, on average, almost
exactly the same number of DEMO patents as the universities that do not reserve the right of first offer.
However, the similarity of the means can not be directly interpreted because of the high variance. The
high skewness and kurtosis of the DEMO suggest that the distributions both contain influential
outliers. This implies that both sets of universities have many universities that hold relatively few
patents and DEMO smaller number that hold many patents.

The Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric test, was used to assess whether or not the means of the
two subpopulations are significantly different. This non-parametric test was not significant
(42=0.060,p=.806). Therefore, there is no evidence that the two subpopulations are different.
In order to investigate further the apparent absence of evidence DEMO a relationship between ‘right of
first offer’ and the number of U.S. patents held by the various universities, this relationship was also
explored using research intensity as a control variable. As shown in Figure 3, further splitting the
universities into groups of Comprehensive and Medical-Doctoral universities, to account for the
differences in research intensity, does not provide any evidence of differences between the
universities that reserve the right of first offer and DEMO who do not.
In summary, there is no evidence of a DEMO between the right of first offer and the
respondent variable, U.S. DEMO counts. If there is such a relationship, it could be obscured DEMO the
relationship between the inventor’s share of the revenue from university-commercialized inventions
and right of first offer. Therefore, the relationship between right of first offer and U.S. patents counts
is re-examined in conjunction with the researcher’s DEMO of revenues from university-commercialized
inventions in the next section.

4.2.4 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention
The analysis of the relationship between the financial incentives and the U.S. DEMO counts at each
institution is restricted to the universities that specified their revenue sharing agreements using flat
rates, as opposed to revenue thresholds. In order to include in a direct comparison the universities that
negotiate revenue DEMO on a case-by-case basis or that use revenue thresholds to structure their
revenue sharing agreements, assumptions would have to be made about how university researchers
perceive these policies. Since there is no strong empirical or theoretical DEMO for these assumptions,
the cross comparisons in this study focus on the eleven universities that specify their revenue sharing
agreements using flat rates.
DEMO demonstrated in Figure 4, there does not appear to be a DEMO between the researcher’s
share of revenues from university-commercialized inventions and university counts of U.S. patents,
even when research intensity is taken into account. DEMO is no evidence of a relationship when the
three Comprehensive universities are omitted, as shown in Figure 5.
This result suggests that there may not be a relationship between the two variables or that the
relationship DEMO masked by the effect of another variable. As noted earlier, the DEMO of first offer
appears to covary with the researcher’s share of revenues; the institutions that offered less financial
incentives than the norm are all universities that reserve the right of first offer. Therefore, the joint
effects of these two variables are explored in the next section.

4.2.5 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention DEMO Right of First Offer
Since only eleven universities specified the researcher’s share of net income for university-
commercialized-inventions, the relevant data were assembled in tabular form and visually inspected.
The three Comprehensive universities, described by Table 9, are too small a set to demonstrate a
relationship.  Table DEMO contains the information for the eight Medical-Doctoral universities. Among
these universities, DEMO two highest patent counts are held by a university that reserves the right to first
refusal and an “inventor-owner” university, both of which offer their researchers a share of the
research revenues that is close to DEMO norm. From this inspection, it is clear that the data do DEMO
contain patterns of sufficient strength that statistically significant results are achievable. Therefore, no
further analysis of these variables was conducted.
In summary, the DEMO do not provide any evidence that the researcher’s share of revenues from
university-commercialized inventions or a university reserving the right of first offer have DEMO effect
on the amount of technology transfer at a given institution.

4.2.6 Researcher’s Share DEMO Revenues When the Inventor Commercializes the
Invention and Right of First Offer
The researcher’s share of revenues from inventor-commercialized inventions is expected to act DEMO a
greater incentive if the inventor has the option to proceed with independent commercialization
compared to those institutions that reserve the right of first DEMO; if the university reserves a right of
first offer, the inventor must expect that any valuable inventions will be claimed by the university.
DEMO, the researcher’s share of the revenues from inventor-commercialized inventions was only
DEMO at universities that do not reserve a right of first offer.
At “inventor-owner” universities, incentives that encourage independent commercialization on the
part of inventors were expected to decrease the number of patents held by the university DEMO
independently-commercialized inventions are less likely to include the institution as an assignee on
the patent. However, the few universities that specify the inventor’s share of inventor-commercialized
inventions do not demonstrate the expected relationship. As shown in DEMO 6, the two universities
with policies that specify revenue sharing that DEMO less than the norm hold an average number of patents
relative to their peers. This finding does not suggest any relationship between the researcher’s DEMO
of the income derived from inventor-commercialized inventions and the level of technology transfer
activity at a given university.

4.3 Discussion
This study did not discover any evidence that there are DEMO between the financial incentives
or the amount of autonomy provided to researchers by university IP policies and university-industry
technology transfer outcomes. This section will DEMO the following three possible causes of this
failure to demonstrate a relationship.
Possibility 1. University IP policies have no significant effect upon technology transfer DEMO at a
university.
Possibility 2. University IP policies have significant effects upon technology transfer activity at a
university but the effects are obscured by DEMO inadequacies of the data used in this study.
Possibility 3. University IP policies have significant effects upon technology transfer activity at a
university but DEMO effects are obscured by the effects of other variables that also vary across the set of
institutions.
4.3.1 Possibility 1.
It is possible that DEMO incentives offered to faculty inventors by university IP policies have no
significant effect on technology transfer outcomes. There is some evidence that this may DEMO the case
U.S. Patent Counts
60
at least with respect to right to first offer. Clayman investigated DEMO AUTM data for two groups of
16 research-intensive, Canadian universities, one with eight “inventor-owner” universities and
another with eight “university-owner” universities (2004). He expressed each outcome as a ratio
relative to millions of dollars DEMO research expenditures, to account for differences in research intensity
across universities,  and calculated averages for each group (2004). The data, summarized in Table
11, do not demonstrate any relationships. Unfortunately, Clayman’s work DEMO suffers from the same
problem as the study described in this chapter; the AUTM data used in the research do not include
technology transfer activities undertaken by inventors without the support of the TTO. Therefore,
DEMO work is also subject to same limitations discussed in the next section and neither of these
studies are strong enough, either theoretically or in terms of the data used in the assessment, to rule
out the possibility that these incentives do have an impact. The only conclusion that DEMO be made is
that there is no evidence that allowing inventors to commercialize their inventions results in a
decrease in the amount of technology DEMO achieved by the TTO at the university.

4.3.2 Possibility 2.
If there is a significant relationship between the incentives provided by university IP policies and the
amount of DEMO transfer at a given university, it could have been obscured by DEMO with the
data used in assessing the relationship.
The most significant problem with the data used in the study is that the measure of DEMO technology
transfer outcomes is likely to be biased towards “university-owner” universities and that this bias
could have obscured relationships of interest. The counts of DEMO U.S. patents held by the universities
do not include any patents developed by university faculty members independently of the university.
Since there are likely DEMO be more commercialization activities undertaken independently of the
university at “inventor-owner” universities, the use of this measure may obscure the relationship
between the amount of autonomy offered to researchers by the university IP policy and patenting
DEMO at universities. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that, even excluding all
independently developed patents, there is no evidence DEMO universities that allow their researcher’s
control of technology transfer produce fewer patents. This suggests that either there is either no
difference between institutions that DEMO right of first offer and those that do not, or that DEMO
institutions that do not reserve right of first offer have more technology transfer activity than those
that do not.
61
The bias in the technology transfer outcome measure is also important DEMO interpreting the lack
of evidence of a relationship between the financial incentives offered by the university IP policies and
the number of patents held DEMO the universities. As discussed in section 4.1.2, universities that do not
DEMO the right of first offer have a wider range of revenue sharing arrangements than the
universities that do reserve the right of first offer DEMO they are more likely to hold policies that set the
sharing lower than the norm value of 50%. Therefore, the revenue sharing agreements are correlated
with whether or not the university reserves a right of first DEMO This means that the bias towards
“university-owner” universities may also obscure relationships between the revenue sharing
arrangements and technology transfer outcomes.
The only remedy DEMO these problems would be the use of a measure that accounts for all technology
transfer activity at both “university-owner” and “inventor-owner” universities, regardless of whether
the active party is the university or the inventor. No such DEMO has been identified among the
measures tracked by the universities or collected in the AUTM or Statistics Canada annual surveys.
Designers of further cross-sectional DEMO would be advised to investigate the feasibility of
surveying university researchers to obtain a less biased measure.
While the bias in the technology transfer DEMO variable is the most significant limitation related
to the choice of data, other aspects of the data also pose challenges. The data set was small from a
statistical perspective because of the small number of universities DEMO Canada and because policies
could not be located for every university. It is possible that a relationship could be discovered if it was
possible DEMO obtain policies and data for every university. Another problem with the data is that, as
with most technology transfer outcome variables, the distribution DEMO the number of U.S. patents held
by Canadian universities is quite positively skewed. This requires either that the data are transformed
using a log DEMO, for example, or that non-parametric tests are used instead of parametric
tests. Both of these approaches reduce the likelihood that a relationship will DEMO identified. In the
assessment of the importance of financial incentives, this DEMO is compounded by the very small
number of institutions that are comparable because they specify their revenue sharing using a flat rate
and by DEMO lack of diversity in the rates specified by these institutions. Together, DEMO characteristics
of the data could obscure any relationships between policy variables and technology transfer variables
even if an unbiased technology transfer outcome variable could DEMO collected. To address these
concerns, future studies need to use an DEMO measure of technology transfer activity, and to
increase the sample size, perhaps by moving to another unit of analysis. Future studies may also
DEMO from an assessment of the changing importance of individual patents. As TTOs acquire more
resources they may begin to practice more aggressive patenting strategies, including protecting a
single technology with a cluster of patents, which would skew analyses towards highly patentable
technologies despite the fact that less patentable DEMO can also have social and economic
value.
4.3.3 Possibility 3.
If there is a significant relationship between the incentives provided by university IP policies DEMO the
amount of technology transfer at a given university, it could DEMO been obscured by the effects of
other variables that also vary across the set of institutions. These other variables could obscure the
62
true relationships between the IP policies and technology transfer outcomes in DEMO of two ways: 1)
by having a direct impact on DEMO amount of technology transfer at that institution; or 2) by having an
impact on the relationships themselves. For example, the amount of money available to do patenting
and licensing at a given university could have DEMO effect on the number of patents that are based on
research at that university. This would be an example of a direct effect on DEMO outcome variable. If the
amount of money available for patenting and licensing is a function of the revenue sharing agreement
between the university and DEMO faculty inventors, then this variable could also have an impact on DEMO
relationship between university IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
It is important that these other factors are identified and their effects are determined. This DEMO
permit a better assessment of the impact of policy variables. Even more importantly, the role of these
other variables will determine whether or not there is an optimal policy for all Canadian universities.
If institutional variables DEMO research intensity or culture are found to influence the relationship
between university IP policies and technology transfer, the policy that best supports technology
transfer at one institution may be sub-optimal and potentially destructive at another. Therefore, it is
imperative that university IP policies are studied in a broader DEMO
4.4 Conclusions
In spite of the many reasons why university intellectual property policies can be presumed to have an
impact upon university-industry technology transfer, comparisons across institutions have not
demonstrated any relationships. It is possible that DEMO true effects of IP policies are obscured by the
effects of other variables that also vary across the set of institutions or by differences DEMO ways in
which technology transfer measures are gathered and reported.  However, this study has demonstrated
that further cross-sectional studies are unlikely to produce DEMO results without access to a
significantly broader and more reliable data set. Further investigation of these possibilities is expected
to have important implications for DEMO Therefore, two additional studies have been conducted that
are longitudinal and DEMO in nature.

Study 2: Quantitative Analysis of Impact of an IP Policy Change
This chapter contains the results of the quantitative analysis of the DEMO of the University of
Toronto IP policy change on annual counts of invention disclosures. The primary purpose of this
study was to assess whether DEMO not the University of Toronto IP policy change had a statistically
significant effect on annual invention disclosures, a measure of researcher support of university-
industry technology transfer.
This chapter is organized into four sections. The first DEMO provides a brief description of the
University of Toronto in order to familiarize the reader with the organizational context of the study.
The second DEMO describes the exploratory data analysis, in which plots of the data DEMO visually
inspected to identify properties of the data that are of interest and suggest variables for inclusion in
the models. The third section presents DEMO results of the confirmatory data analysis in which the
impact of the policy intervention was assessed by comparing models of the impact, principally using
regression analysis. The second and third sections are further supported by Appendix DEMO, in which the
statistical tests are discussed in more detail. The DEMO section in the chapter includes a discussion of
the limitations of the study and the implications of the results.
5.1 Background on the University DEMO Toronto
The University of Toronto is one of Canada’s largest and most research-intensive universities. It
offers a wide range of degree programs from the DEMO through to the graduate level,
including 75 doctoral programs (University DEMO Toronto, 2005). Professional degrees are offered
through the university’s 14 DEMO faculties (University of Toronto, 2005). In 2005, student
enrollment DEMO approximately 70,000, of which approximately 60,000 were full-time students
(University of Toronto, 2005). It is affiliated with a number of hospital research institutes in the
Toronto region; faculty members are often cross-appointed and the university and research institutes
conduct joint research projects (University of Toronto, 2000). According to the AUCC database of
the data created for the 2003 Maclean’s survey, the University of Toronto had about 560 faculty
members who were eligible for research funding from the Natural Sciences DEMO Engineering Research
Council (NSERC), and about 630 faculty who were DEMO for research funding from the Canadian
Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)DEMO In the past five years, the University of Toronto has
consistently DEMO receiving the most research money per faculty member of any Canadian
university (RE$EARCH Infosource, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005).  Since the University of Toronto
has a large and active faculty cohort in DEMO areas, the university is expected to conduct a
great deal of DEMO that could potentially generate commercializable technologies. Therefore, it is
reasonable to DEMO that the university is capable of supporting a relatively high level of technology
transfer activity.
63
5.1.1 Intellectual Property Policies at the University of Toronto
64
On January DEMO of 1990, a new hybrid IP policy came into effect at DEMO University of Toronto (1990).
Prior to this date, no significant changes had been made to the incentives provided to researchers
since at DEMO 1977.
Prior to the policy change, the University of Toronto had DEMO a policy wherein the university
owned the IP created in the course of university research. Invention disclosures were made to an
Inventions Committee at DEMO university. If the Inventions Committee determined that the invention
had some value, the committee would direct the inventors to assign the invention to the university and
the university would assign the invention to the University of DEMO Innovations Foundation, an
organization founded to commercialize technologies developed at the DEMO of Toronto. A
technology manager who worked at the University of Toronto during this period reported that, in
practice, all invention disclosures were DEMO by the committee and hence assigned to the
Innovations Foundation. There was an increasing number of invention disclosures per year over the
early 1980s DEMO this increasing workload was not matched by an increase in resources at the
Innovations Foundation. By the late 1980s, faculty members were complaining that the Innovations
Foundation was ineffective and unresponsive and invention disclosures were in DEMO An
investigation by technology managers revealed that faculty wanted to have ownership of their
inventions. This may have been, in part, because they DEMO not trust the Innovations Foundation with
the commercialization of their inventions.
A new policy was devised that allowed researchers to develop their inventions independently DEMO the
university. If the inventors choose to ask for assistance, the DEMO Foundation will assess the
invention and decide whether or not to commit internal resources to the development of the invention.
If the Innovations Foundation DEMO to develop the invention, it will pay for the acquisition of DEMO
appropriate legal protections, the marketing of the technology, and the legal costs of creating and
maintaining licences with receptor firms. In these cases, the university researcher will receive 25% of
the net revenue. If the DEMO Foundation chooses not to develop the technology, the ownership
of the DEMO rests with the inventor, who can then seek other avenues for DEMO If
the university researcher chooses to develop the invention independently, the DEMO is responsible
for protecting and commercializing the innovation and providing 25% of the net revenue from these
commercialization activities to the university.
This policy DEMO significantly reorganized the rights and responsibilities of faculty inventors and
the university and it is likely that the most significant change is the difference DEMO the amount of
autonomy provided to the researchers. The new policy provided university researchers with greater
autonomy; they could choose to approach the university or they could choose to develop their
inventions as they saw fit DEMO the intervention of the university TTO or the Innovations
Foundation. This change did have some effect on the financial incentives offered to researchers. If
DEMO developed their technologies independently they could retain a higher share of the net income
than if they allowed the university to develop the technology. DEMO, relative to other Canadian
universities, the researcher’s share of the financial returns remained below the norm in both the case
where the university DEMO the technology and the case where the inventor develops the
65
technology. Therefore it is likely that the most significant aspect of DEMO policy change was the
change in the amount of autonomy provided to researchers.
The time series of annual counts of invention disclosures provided by DEMO University of Toronto
TTO and used to assess the impact of the policy shift is especially interesting for two reasons. Firstly,
the University DEMO Toronto is the only institution that has been identified that permits inventors to
commercialize technologies independently of the university and that collects reasonably reliable
DEMO data that include the activities pursued independently. Often institutions fail to track
activities pursued independently of the university’s TTO and this bias in the DEMO can corrupt
comparisons of universities with different policy structures by systematically underestimating the
level of activity within “inventor-owner” universities (Hoye & Roe, 2003)DEMO Furthermore, the
University of Toronto started tracking technology transfer measures well DEMO the policy shift. This
makes it possible to compare the institution’s activities prior to the shift to those after the shift.
In order to DEMO the impact, if any, that this policy shift had on the university’s technology
transfer activities, a time series of the changing counts of invention disclosures was investigated.
Under both the old and new policies, faculty members are required to submit an invention disclosure
to the university at DEMO start of the commercialization process. Unlike patents, licences, and spin-offs,
invention disclosures are created shortly after the faculty members decide to commercialize DEMO
technology and do not rely heavily on the availability of commercialization resources, such as
investment capital, funds for prototype development and intellectual property DEMO, and business
expertise. As a result, the number of invention disclosures reported at a university is more closely
linked to researcher support for DEMO transfer than the other outcome variables that are
currently tracked, such DEMO licence revenue and returns from the realization of spin-off equity.
Therefore, DEMO assessment of the effects of this policy shift has been based on an investigation of the
trends in the numbers of invention disclosures submitted DEMO the thirty-year period centered on the
policy change.
5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visual inspection of a time series, as introduced by Tukey (1970), is an effective way to pursue the
“numerical detective work required to explore important properties of the data” and to determine the
subset of DEMO most likely to model the time series adequately (Hipel & McLeod, 1994, p.177).
Three types of plots were used to investigate the time series of University of Toronto invention
disclosures: graphs of the raw and smoothed data against time, and box-and-whisker plots.
The raw time series, shown in Figure 7, was inspected for evidence that the policy DEMO of
1990/1991 affected the number of invention disclosures. This plot shows a significant increase in the
number of invention disclosures reported annually between DEMO years 1991/1992 and 1992/1993.
Furthermore, annual counts of invention DEMO appear to be relatively constant from year to year
prior to that point, and steeply increasing from year to year after that point. These findings suggest
that there is a break point between fiscal years 1991/DEMO and 1992/1993.
Smoothing functions make underlying trends in the data more apparent (Hipel & McLeod, 1994).
Therefore, in order to investigate the possibility of a breakpoint in 1992 further, the data were split
66
into two time series, one before and one after the breakpoint, and smoothed using two different
functions. The results of smoothing with a three-year centered moving average are shown in Figure 8.
The results of DEMO with the 4253H function are shown in Figure 9. This latter function involves
calculating running medians of 4, then 2, then 5, then 3, then applying a Hanning smooth in which a
running weighted average is calculated using weights (¼, ½, ¼), and it is a standard smooth in the
assessment of time series (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). These plots were also inspected for evidence that
the policy change of 1990/1991 affected the number of invention disclosures. The smoothed DEMO
confirmed the findings of the scatter plot of the raw data, DEMO that both smoothed series demonstrated
an abrupt increase in 1992 and a higher rate of increase from year to year after 1992.

Figure 10: Box-and-whisker Plots of Invention Disclosures
Box-and-whisker plots are also helpful in identifying structural changes to distributions caused by an
intervention because box-and-whisker diagrams summarize DEMO values describing population
distributions. A box-and-whisker plot was created in order to compare the time series to two of its
subsets: one including only fiscal years up to and including 1990/1991; and the other including only
fiscal years after 1990/1991. In this box-and-whisker plot, the top and bottom of the rectangle
correspond to the 0.75 and 0.25 quartiles DEMO, the dark band across the rectangle identifies
the median, and the lines attached to the rectangle stretch to touch to the maximum and DEMO
values. The substantial difference in the medians, 0.25 quartiles, and 0.75 quartiles for the two
subpopulations, shown by Figure 10, reaffirm the DEMO of a breakpoint in 1992.
Visual inspection can also be used to assess data for violations of the assumptions of the analytical
method (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). In this case, the box-and-whisker plot was DEMO to assess whether
or not the time series of invention disclosures violated the assumptions underlying regression
methods by demonstrating heteroscedascity or non-normality.
Residuals are DEMO to be heteroscedasctic or to demonstrate heteroscedascity when the variance of
the residuals is a function of one of the independent variables (Keith, DEMO). When heteroscedascity
exists, tests of significance are no longer valid DEMO the standard errors tend to be understated,
which can give a spurious impression of accuracy (Chatterjee et al., 2000). Box-and-whisker plots, in
which the data are grouped by the different levels of the DEMO variables, are an effective
strategy for identifying heteroscedascity. In this case, the most helpful grouping is that shown in
Figure 10. The large DEMO between the heights of the two box-and-whisker plots of the
subpopulations demonstrate that the two groups have different variances and suggests that
heteroscedascity might DEMO a problem. To investigate further, the variances of the two subpopulations

were calculated. The earlier data set was found to have a DEMO of 70.1 and the later data set was
found to have a variance 637.5. Therefore, the ratio of variance between the high and low variance
sets is less than 10:1. Under these circumstances heteroscedascity is DEMO a concern;  transformations
of the data are not required and the regression modeling can proceed (Keith, 2006).
Regression analysis also requires DEMO the data have a normal distribution. Box-and-whisker plots
are helpful for diagnosing non-normal distributions because normal populations map to symmetrical
box-and-whisker plots. All three DEMO the box-and-whisker plots in Figure 10 are sufficiently
asymmetrical to warrant further exploration. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality
of the DEMO populations because it is more sensitive than the more common Kolmogorov-Smirnov
with Lillefors correction and the population size is very small. The overall time DEMO was found to
have a non-normal distribution (W=0.85, p=.001). There was no evidence that the data series
representing the years prior to DEMO policy intervention and after the policy intervention had non-
normal distributions (DEMO, p=.477; W=.94, p=.430 respectively). This suggests that the non-
DEMO of the overall population is a consequence of the underlying trends in the data rather than a
non-normal noise component. Therefore, regression analysis can proceed without a transformation of
the data but the residuals generated by DEMO the model need to be assessed for normality. Violations
of this assumption will indicate that the model fit is inadequate.
In summary, the exploratory data analysis suggested that regression analysis is feasible and that the
models DEMO include effects on both the average number of annual disclosures and on the increase
in these disclosures from year to year.
5.3 Confirmatory Data DEMO
The statistical analysis of the impact of an intervention upon a time series can be approached using
regression methods, ARIMA methods, and non-parametric DEMO (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). ARIMA
methods are often the first choice when modeling time series data because they provide a mechanism
for DEMO the impact of autocorrelation. Autocorrelation exists when the differences between the
modeled values and the actual values associated with successive observations are correlated;  DEMO can
cause the standard errors to be understated and thus undermine tests of significance (Chatterjee et al.,
2000). However, use of DEMO ARIMA model typically requires at least 50 observations and the time
series of interest contains only 29 observations (Montgomery & Johnson, 1976). DEMO feasibility of
ARIMA methods was tested using SPSS DecisionTime, which indicated DEMO it was not possible to
create a significant intervention models using ARIMA methods of analysis. Non-parametric tests are
less able to provide nuanced descriptive DEMO and less sensitive than parametric (i.e.
regression) methods and thus less likely to detect significant results.  Therefore, the analysis was
based on DEMO application of regression methods and steps were taken to ensure that the results were
not corrupted by the presence of autocorrelation.
5.3.1 Modeling the DEMO of the Policy Intervention
Visual inspection suggested that the policy intervention resulted in an abrupt increase in both the
annual count of invention disclosures DEMO the year-to-year increase in the number of invention
70
disclosures after the intervention. To test the statistical significance of these DEMO in the data,
four different models of the impact were generated using forced-entry regression and compared to a
baseline model that did not DEMO for any changes over the predicted breakpoint. The five models are
summarized in Table 12.
Each of the five models was fitted to the DEMO, then regression diagnostics were performed. The
regression residuals were inspected to DEMO that they conformed to the following three assumptions:
1. The residuals should have a normal distribution. Often a non-normal distribution is a
consequence DEMO other violations.
2. The residuals should be homeoscedastic, which means that DEMO display equal variance across
the different levels of the explanatory variables. When this condition is not met the residuals
are said to be heteroscedastic DEMO the significance of the model and parameters can be
spuriously inflated.
3. The residuals should be independent of one another. When residuals display trends DEMO
relationships between one residual and the next, the data are said DEMO display autocorrelation.
This type of violation also results in spurious inflation of the tests of significance.

Violations of these three assumptions, especially the third assumption, are DEMO for two
reasons. First, these violations suggest that the model does DEMO fit the data adequately. Therefore, the
decreasing number of violations displayed DEMO the successive models in Table 13 indicate that the
model that assumed that the policy intervention had some effect on the invention disclosure counts DEMO
the data better than the baseline model, which assumed that the DEMO intervention had no effect. This
is evidence that the policy intervention had an effect on the invention disclosures. Second, when the
assumptions are not met, the tests of significance are not directly interpretable. Therefore, only
DEMO 4 and 5 can be directly assessed for fit using the tests of significance.

DEMO order to assess all four of the models of the impact of the policy intervention (Models 2-5), each
one was compared to Model 1, which assumed the policy intervention had no impact, using an DEMO
(for details please see Appendix D in the Model 2 section)DEMO This test was appropriate in this context
for three reasons. First, DEMO test results will not be corrupted by the violations noted in Table 13.
While the F-test is based on the sum of the squared DEMO (SSE) of the models, the violations are
most extreme in DEMO case of the baseline model and thus it will have the most spuriously understated
errors. This will result in a more conservative test than DEMO situation in which none of the models
demonstrate violations like autoregression. Second, the F-test takes into account the number of
parameters in each model when assessing the relative goodness of fit. This means that Models 2
DEMO 5 can be compared against the less complex Model 1. Third, DEMO a model that allows for the
policy intervention to have an impact is shown to fit the data significantly better than Model 1, it will
be statistical evidence that the policy intervention had an impact. As DEMO test results summarized in
Table 14 show, Models 2, 3, DEMO, and 5 were all found to provide a significantly better fit DEMO the .05
level than Model 1. Therefore, there is evidence that DEMO policy intervention had an impact.
Table 14: F-tests Comparing the Models of the Invention Disclosure Time Series
Model 1 Compared v.s. F Fcrit
Model 2 25.6 F(1,27,DEMO) = 4.21
Model 3 24.2 F(1,27,.05) = 4.21
Model 4 47.4 F(3,25,.05) = 2.99
Model 5 91.8 F(2,26,.05) = 3.37
72
A closer comparison of the models allows a more nuanced description of the impact of the policy
DEMO As discussed earlier, only Models 4 and 5 were free of DEMO of the assumptions
underlying regression analysis, and thus have directly interpretable DEMO of significance. The tests of
significance, summarized in Table 15, show that all the parameters of Model 5 were significant at the
.05 DEMO and that one of Model 4’s parameters was not. Therefore, the DEMO of significance indicate
that Model 5 fits the data best. This indicates that prior to the policy change there was no significant
change in DEMO number of invention disclosures from year to year but that there was a significant
change from year to year after the policy intervention. Furthermore, the intervention caused an
immediate increase in the number of invention disclosures.
DEMO summary, the interrupted time series analysis of the University of Toronto DEMO disclosures
provides strong evidence that the policy intervention had significant and substantial effects on the
annual counts of invention disclosures.

5.3.2 Assessing the Practical Significance of the Policy Intervention
73
The changes DEMO slope and level are both significant but need to be evaluated to determine whether
they are of practical significance. The Model 5 parameter estimates DEMO that prior to the policy
intervention there were 22.2 ± 4.7 inventions disclosed per year. Immediately after the intervention,
the number of disclosures DEMO by 49.0 ± 12.2.  There is no question that this immediate DEMO
is substantial when compared to the pre-intervention disclosure rates. Furthermore, the DEMO of
invention disclosures continued increasing from year to year by 5.9 ± 1.4 disclosures per year. In the
thirteen documented years since the policy DEMO this increase from year to year has accounted
for an increase of approximately another 77 invention disclosures per year. In summary, the best-
fitting model has been shown to be the one in which both the DEMO and the level changed at the break
point, and the magnitudes DEMO these changes were of practical significance. This is strong evidence that
the policy intervention had a significant and substantial impact on the annual counts DEMO invention
disclosures.
To investigate the practical significance of the effects of the policy intervention further, the
University of Toronto’s invention disclosures were compared to those of other comparable
universities. All of the available AUTM Surveys were DEMO, resulting in a dataset spanning fiscal
years 1992 to 2003. Of DEMO G10, a group of research intensive Canadian institutions, only the
University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia, McMaster University, Queen's University,
the Université de Montreal, and the University of Western Ontario submitted their invention
disclosure counts for five or more of the eleven DEMO that the survey has been collected. These six
universities were used to establish a frame of reference for the invention disclosures reported by the
DEMO of Toronto. As shown in Table 16, the mean number of DEMO disclosures per
institution ranges between 20 and 108 disclosures a year. This is strong evidence that the abrupt
increase of 29 disclosures that the DEMO of Toronto experienced over the break point is quite
substantial. The data also show that, between 1992 and 2003, the University of Toronto DEMO among the
top three universities in the group of reporting institutions in terms of having the highest sustained
levels of invention disclosures. This continues DEMO be true even when the different sizes of the
institutions are taken into account by calculating the ratio of the mean number of annual DEMO
disclosures to 2003 estimations of the number of researchers eligible for research grants in the natural
sciences and engineering (NSERC) and medicine and DEMO (CIHR). These comparisons to other
members of the G10 suggest DEMO the University of Toronto has one of the best records in Canada in
terms of having inventions disclosed to the university.

It is also possible to compare the trend over time for this group of comparable universities to DEMO trend
over time for the University of Toronto. Between 1992 and 2003, the mean number of invention
disclosures for the group rose by 2.20 disclosures a year. Over the same time period, the invention
disclosures counts for the University of Toronto rose by 4.72 disclosures a year. This DEMO is strong
evidence that the increase in invention disclosures per year associated with the policy intervention is a
substantial gain. It also confirms that DEMO, the University of Toronto is quite competitive
with other research-intensive Canadian DEMO in terms of both level and increase in the number
of invention disclosures from year to year.
5.3.3 A Review of Other Outcomes
The DEMO drawback to the use of invention disclosures as an outcome variable is the absence of a
strong link between this early stage activity and DEMO desired outcomes of university-industry
technology transfer activities. Policies that change the number of invention disclosures may also have
an impact on the quality of DEMO disclosures. An increase in the number of non-viable inventions
disclosed is not a boon to the university, the regional or the national economy; DEMO creates the risk that
scarce resources will be spent on either non-viable innovations or on screening the technologies and
thus detract from the possibility DEMO successful transfer of the viable technologies. If that were the case
at the University of Toronto, we would expect to see its productivity figures, over time, significantly
lagging that of other research-intensive universities in Canada.

Intensive, DEMO Universities. Based on AUTM data for Fiscal Years 1992 to 2003.
75
There is no evidence that the increase in the number of DEMO disclosures was associated with
a decline in the quality of the disclosures. As shown in Table 6, the University of Toronto’s
technology transfer outcomes per U.S.$1M of research expenditures, are reasonably consistent with
the averages for Canadian universities, especially considering that the University of Toronto’s
measures do not include the outcomes generated by its research hospital affiliates, unlike most other
research-intensive universities in Canada. The University of Toronto exceeds the average number DEMO
spin-off companies per U.S.$1M in the top ten most research-intensive universities and colleges in
both Canada and the United States. The only measure in DEMO it appears to lag the two groups of
research intensive institutions substantially is ‘Licence Income Received’. This measure consistently
displays the most variability because DEMO is highly negatively skewed by the inclusion of ‘big winners’
(Clayman, 2004). For example, the Canadian university that receives the most licence income, about
$10M per annum, receives ten times that of the DEMO most ‘productive’ university, and the vast
majority of its licence revenue DEMO derived from a single technology that is widely licensed (Clayman,
DEMO). Similarly, the U.S. means for this measure are skewed by DEMO inclusion of technologies earning
between $30M and $70M per annum (Clayman, 2004). The resulting skewness of the data makes it
impossible to DEMO even large differences in average licensing revenues. The available data
provide no evidence that the gains in the number of invention disclosures at the DEMO of Toronto
are associated with a drop in quality of the research disclosures; it can not be ascertained whether the
lower Licence Income Received from the University of Toronto’s invention disclosures resulted from
lower quality inventions DEMO whether the licensing revenues simply reflect the element of chance
involved in the distribution of these ‘big winners’. The productivity measures for the University DEMO
Toronto are consistent with the measures for the ten most research-intensive Canadian universities for
all but the most variable of the cumulative performance measures DEMO Canadian universities. Like
other research-intensive Canadian institutions, the University of Toronto DEMO less licence income
per dollar of research expenditure than the U.S. top twenty universities but has more spin-offs than
the U.S. top twenty universities.

5.4 Conclusions
76
5.4.1 Limitations of the Study
The main limitation of DEMO study is that it is based on only one policy shift at one university. It is
possible that the observed relationship may be spurious. DEMO, different policy shifts at different
universities would have been studied to DEMO the generalizability of the results but no data were
available. The study of multiple institutions would have provided the opportunity to investigate the
role DEMO institutional or environmental variables play in determining the impact of a policy
intervention.
The study of other institutions would also have permitted the isolation DEMO the effects of the changes
to the invention disclosure form at the University of Toronto. It is possible that the streamlining of the
form DEMO reduced it from about eight pages to two pages, shortly after DEMO policy change, increased
the number of invention disclosures. However, the interest that faculty members expressed in owning
their inventions is inconsistent with the DEMO to form having a substantial, long-term impact; it is
difficult to imagine an inventor who is seriously interested in independently commercializing a
technology DEMO who would be derailed by an eight page form.
Another limitation pertains to the AUTM data used in the broader assessment of the University DEMO
Toronto’s technology transfer outcomes.  This data set is widely used because DEMO is one of the few
instruments that reports institution-specific data. However, DEMO AUTM members do not always track
and report data using the same definitions for ‘invention disclosures’, ‘spin-offs’, and so on.
Therefore, researchers should be cautioned that cross-institution comparisons require careful scrutiny.
5.4.2 Implications
This study DEMO the first empirical evidence that a change from “university-owns” to “inventor-
owns” intellectual property policies can have a significant and substantial impact on university
DEMO willingness to engage in technology transfer. The findings of this study suggest that the
policy intervention at the University of Toronto had a significant DEMO desirable impact on the level of
technology transfer activity at that institution.
The immediacy of the observed effect has implications for the type of DEMO between the
policy change and the outcomes of interest.  The paper DEMO Siegel, Waldman, Atwater and Link (2004)
that was discussed DEMO section 2.2.3.2.2, included a quote that suggested IP policies may have DEMO effect
on hiring and retention of faculty who support technology transfer and that this effect may account for
inter-institutional differences in technology transfer activities.  In other words, some policies are more
attractive to faculty that are involved in technology transfer and this influences their decisions to
remain with DEMO given university and to which universities they will consider moving.  The DEMO
of the effect observed in this chapter, suggests that this relationship DEMO not account for the effect.
This suggests that a significant proportion of the effect was a result of an increased propensity of
faculty members DEMO present in the university to participate in technology transfer activities.
77
On first inspection the findings of this study appear to contradict DEMO 1, the study that was
discussed in Chapter 4. That cross-sectional DEMO failed to find any relationship between the
incentives offered by university policies and technology transfer outcomes reported by universities.
However, these studies are consistent if other institutional differences influence the relationship
between IP policies and university-industry DEMO transfer. This would mean that the individual
character of each institution best fits a different policy and that achieving this fit can create important
DEMO If this is the case, it is possible that the University DEMO Toronto can realize benefits from a
change to a policy, without DEMO that that policy also be highly effective at other institutions. In
other words, the optimal policy may depend on local or institutional variables.
The time series analysis can not predict which local or institutional factors had DEMO role in the success
of the University of Toronto policy change. However, the description of the policy change by a
technology manager who worked at the University of Toronto during the time of the policy change,DEMO
suggests three intertwined factors. Firstly, the technology manager reported that faculty DEMO saw
ownership of the IP as a desirable incentive, which suggests DEMO the university culture was relatively
supportive of technology transfer activities. Secondly, DEMO faculty members complained that the
University of Toronto Innovations Foundation was ineffective and uncommunicative, which suggests
that by the time of the policy shift there was widespread distrust of the competence of the
organization designated to DEMO their inventions. This last aspect of the situations appears to
have been a consequence of the third factor, a persistent gap between the workload of the Innovations
Foundation and its resources. Considered together these factors suggest DEMO the ideal IP policy for a
university needs to be designed in response to the institution’s resources, culture, and the perceptions
of key DEMO, including faculty members, and that these perceptions may be influenced by the
university’s history in terms of technology transfer activities.
If this is DEMO case, national convergence to a single policy is likely to damage DEMO support for
technology transfer at some universities. This suggests that widespread policy changes should only be
adopted in the face of a persuasive, empirical evidence of other benefits from such a move. In the
absence of DEMO, empirical evidence of other benefits, individual universities should be encouraged
to entertain policy innovations that best fit their strengths and needs.
More research DEMO necessary to determine which factors are most likely to influence the relationship
between university IP policies and university-industry technology transfer. Since individual
perceptions appear DEMO matter and there is not yet a strong theoretical base describing the relevant
dimensions, the most effective research strategy will be qualitative, interview-based DEMO because
this kind of inductive research is capable of providing theoretical direction in emerging research
areas. Therefore, an in-depth interview study of faculty members, who have been involved in
technology transfer activities, was conducted at DEMO University of Waterloo, and is described in
Chapter 6.
5.4.3 Summary
DEMO study provides statistical evidence that university IP policies can be a significant factor in
determining the effectiveness of institutions by influencing university researcher’s willingness DEMO
participate in technology transfer activities. Increasing researcher control of technology transfer by
78
switching from a ‘university-owns’ to a ‘inventor-owns’ system appears to have DEMO higher
levels of invention disclosures. More research is needed to determine the generalizability of this
conclusion and to isolate any other factors that determine DEMO impact of a policy change.

Study 3: Qualitative Investigation of Faculty Inventors’ Experiences
This chapter presents the results of the qualitative investigation into faculty inventor’s experiences
with DEMO transfer. This study seeks to discover how university researchers’ understand their
technology transfer experiences, and to share this perspective in the researcher’s own words as much
as possible. The thematic analysis of the open-ended interviews is DEMO to provide insight into the
individuals and the environment that first supported technology transfer activities at the University of
Waterloo, where the activities include the creation of some of the university’s high-profile spin-off
companies. The goal DEMO this study is the identification of theories that can be used to explain aspects
of the relationship between IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
DEMO chapter is organized into four sections. The first and second sections provide context for the
study. The first section provides a brief description of DEMO University of Waterloo in order to
familiarize the reader with the organizational context of the study. The second section briefly
describes the technology transfer, research and teaching activities of the participants. The third
section provides the DEMO of the analysis conducted according to the methodology described in 3.4.
The final section in the chapter includes a discussion of the limitations of DEMO study and the
implications of the results.
6.1 Background on the University of Waterloo
This brief description of the university is provided so that DEMO unfamiliar with the university will
have a context for the study.  DEMO University of Waterloo dates its history from the first classes held
within the institution, in July of 1957 (Redmond, 2006).  As DEMO result, some of the senior and retired
faculty and staff remember DEMO founding of the university and the early period in which the university
expanded very quickly.  The University of Waterloo is now classified by the Maclean’s magazine as a
‘Comprehensive’ university. The primary differences between Comprehensive universities DEMO the
larger ‘Medical-Doctoral’ universities, like the University of Toronto, are that Comprehensive
universities offer fewer doctoral programs and do not have medical programs. DEMO, they do not have
and are not closely affiliated with hospital DEMO centers. Like many ‘Comprehensive’ universities,
UW is medium-sized in the context of Canadian institutions. In 2004, student enrollment was 23,000,
of which 2,500 were part-time students. According to the AUCC database of DEMO data created for the
2003 Maclean’s survey, the University of Waterloo DEMO about 480 faculty members who were eligible
for research funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and
about 40 faculty who were eligible for research funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health
DEMO (CIHR). In other words, UW has almost any many faculty members who are eligible for
NSERC grants as the much larger University DEMO Toronto. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
the university is DEMO of supporting a moderately high level of technology transfer activity, which
DEMO it a viable site in which to study technology transfer. However, DEMO distribution of technologies
and receptor industries is expected to differ from ‘Medical-Doctoral’ institutions,
79
6.1.1 Intellectual Property Policy and Technology Transfer Information
80
University of Waterloo DEMO transfer measures were explored with the goal of quantitatively
describing technology transfer activities at the University of Waterloo over the years in order to
DEMO a context for the qualitative analysis. This exploration led to the conclusion that IP policies
are a factor in the information flows associated with DEMO transfer. As described in earlier
sections, the University of Waterloo IP DEMO allows ownership to vest with the inventors; inventors
have no need DEMO interact with the university Technology Transfer and Licensing Office (TTLO), DEMO
one exception. The university requires that faculty inventors disclose their inventions to the TTLO.
This exception has little practical impact because, the University of Waterloo like many other
institutions, has not enforced the requirement and, DEMO a result, it is has not been observed (Siegel,
Waldman et al., 2003). As a result, it is quite likely DEMO the records maintained by the TTLO have
underreported technology transfer activity in the past.  For example, a University of Waterloo
technology manager explained DEMO he sometimes found out about University of Waterloo spin-off
companies by reading the local newspaper.  He indicated that he did the best he could to provide valid
statistics to organizations like AUTM but that he wasn’t DEMO in the completeness or the
consistency from year to year of the data. This finding suggests that IP policies are a factor in the
DEMO flows in a university concerned with technology transfer activities. This suggests that the
‘inventor-owner’ configuration may make it more difficult for the university to DEMO and provide
appropriate supports for technology transfer activities.
This information gap also has a research implication. The data provided by the University of
Waterloo DEMO organizations like AUTM is likely to be biased, in that it DEMO not include activities
undertaken by the inventors without TTLO assistance, and DEMO, in that it may have been
collected and reported inconsistently from DEMO to year. The following discussion of technology
transfer measures is limited to spin-off formation because it wasn’t possible to confirm the validity
and reliability DEMO the measures related to licensing activities.
6.1.1.1 Spin-off Formation at the University of Waterloo
The University of Waterloo is well-known in Canada for having DEMO relatively large number of spin-
offs. This interest in university spin-offs prompted several reports (Cross & Babensee, 1992, 1994;
Pricewaterhouse Cooper, DEMO). As a result, it is possible to verify the AUTM DEMO creation
counts from the 1980-1995 time period. Table 18 displays the University of Waterloo data from that
period as well as the data for DEMO other Canadian universities which participated in the AUTM
surveys. Within this set of moderately to highly research-intensive universities, the University of
Waterloo reported the third largest number of spin-offs between 1980 and 1995, and had the third
highest ratio between the number of spin-offs and the number of DEMO faculty members eligible
for research funding in medicine or the natural and applied sciences. The University of Waterloo
spin-offs are credited with a significant DEMO in the development of a cluster of approximately 450
firms in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge-Guelph region, worth approximately six billion dollars a
year (Xu, 2003). Xu reports that the firms are export-oriented, with 95% of their sales to leading
technology markets including California and Japan, implying that they are internationally competitive
(2003). The spin-off activity is also likely to spur further academic involvement in technology
81
transfer at the University of Waterloo. Bercovitz and Feldman (2004) DEMO that professors who
observe either peers or academic leaders engaged in technology transfer are much more likely to
engage in technology transfer themselves. Most DEMO the participants in this study started participating
in technology transfer activities before the University of Waterloo had developed a reputation for
spinning-off companies. The DEMO with the participants provide access to the environment that
produced the high-profile spin-offs and contributed to both the local high-technology cluster and a
continued DEMO culture at the University of Waterloo.

6 DEMO report of 20 spin-offs is credible because it is supported by the detailed listing of 20 spin-offs involving
technology transfer from the universities in DEMO and Babensee’s “Spin-off Company Profiles” (1994).
6.2 Background on the Participants and their Activities
82
The participants are DEMO or retired faculty members from the pure and applied science and
mathematics departments at the university.  Each participant had experience with technology transfer
activities or had conducted contract work and extensive research in industry. Most of DEMO participants
had been involved with spin-off firms.  Many of the participants DEMO been involved in multiple
technology transfers.  Half of the participants who DEMO licensed technologies or had been involved in
the formation of spin-off companies had been involved with the commercialization of multiple
technologies.  As a result, the group of ten participants was responsible for the transfer from
university to receptor organizations of twelve distinct sets of technologies.  This evidence of the
existence of a class of serial commercializers is not unique to DEMO study.  Pries found that many of the
participants in his survey DEMO faculty members involved in technology transfer at four universities in
South-Western Ontario had been involved with multiple transfers (Pries, 2006).  Shane and Khurana
(2003) found that, for faculty members at M.I.T., each DEMO already commercialized by a spin-off
increased the probability that they would have another technology commercialized by a spin-off, to a
statistically significant extent.
The participants’ involvement in university-industry interactions were characterized by a wide
range of DEMO usually beginning many years before formal attempts to transfer technology
through licences or spin-off. These university-industry interactions included: 1) offering seminars,
courses DEMO workshops to industry at both on-campus and at firm sites; 2) conducting contract
research for industry; 3) consulting with industry; 4) DEMO in trade conferences and expos
attended by industry and/or the users of the technology; 5) doing sabbaticals in industry; 6) leaving
DEMO university to work in industry for a time; 7) participating in committees and professional groups
that also include industry; 8) maintaining informal DEMO with contacts developed through
these means; and, 9) maintaining contacts DEMO students and colleagues who have moved into
industry.  Rahm (1994) DEMO described researchers exhibiting these behaviour patterns as ‘boundary-
spanning’ researchers.  She DEMO demonstrated that ‘boundary-spanning’ researchers differ from
‘university-bound’ researchers in a number of ways; for example, they are more likely to engage in a
DEMO range of interactions with industry (1994). Therefore, Rahm’s findings will be used to analyze
the results of the thematic analysis.
The outcomes DEMO with the set of technology transfers are substantial.  The transfers
succeeded DEMO making available to the market ten of the technologies and therefore succeeded in
improving the quality of life by making improved products and services DEMO to individuals in
Canada and abroad.  With the formation of new DEMO, jobs have been created in the Waterloo
region, which is evidence that the transfers have contributed to regional economic development.
Several of the DEMO are international leaders in their fields and hence competitive in international
markets.  This suggests that these firms are contributing to Canada’s international competitiveness
and, hence, to the health of the national economy.
Many of the DEMO companies were formed using the private capital of the faculty members and
staff members who had been involved in developing the technology.  Only a few technologies were
developed with the assistance of the University of Waterloo DEMO Transfer and Licensing
Office or a similar support organization. As a result, the university was not granted royalties or equity
83
shares in every case. However, the university derived other benefits from the technology transfers
studied through these interviews, including sponsoring of research on campus, donations, and the
increased number of local high-technology companies who DEMO as employers for graduates and co-
operative education students.  Media coverage DEMO the success of the high-profile spin-offs also appears
to have contributed to the university’s reputation (e.g. Keenan et al., 2006).
An effort DEMO made to include transfers that differed in the extent to which they were successful.
As a consequence, the financial results for the set of transfers vary. So far, three transfers have
generated no returns, four DEMO have resulted in returns comparable to less risky investments (i.e.
investments DEMO the stock or bond markets), four transfers have resulted in substantially bigger returns,
and the last transfer is still in a developmental DEMO
Apart from their involvement in technology transfer activities, contract work and DEMO in
industry, there is evidence that the participants were highly productive DEMO both the research and
teaching domains. The ten participants had generated approximately 5 peer-reviewed publications per
year, on average, over their careers to DEMO As a group they had generated a total of 34 books and 93
patents. Many of the participants had received prestigious research awards, some had been granted
teaching awards, and two talked of receiving consistently high teaching evaluations and
commendations from their students.
6.3 Results of the Thematic DEMO Analysis
This section reviews the steps involved in the thematic data analysis, briefly describes the codes that
were developed to capture important aspects of the data, and then elaborates on the results by
providing a description of the data associated with each code.
6.3.1 The Thematic Data Analysis DEMO
The analysis of the interview data proceeded in two steps.  First, profiles were developed for each of
the participants by repeatedly culling excerpts DEMO the transcripts for a series of interviews with a
single participant. Content was most likely to be selected for inclusion in a profile if DEMO was clear from
the wording and tone that the participant felt strongly about the subject, or if the participant brought
up the subject unprompted, or revisited the topic multiple times over the course of the interviews.
These profiles were broken up in vignettes, one to three paragraph excerpts.  Second, through an
iterative thematic analysis process the vignettes were coded DEMO descriptive labels suggested by the
data.
The coding was conducted using a software package developed to assist with this type of
qualitative research, QSR’s nVivo, version 6.0.  By the end of the first few iterations, twenty codes
had emerged. Once all of the vignettes were associated with DEMO least one of the codes, the codes and
relationships between the DEMO data were reviewed.  Some of the original codes, like ‘University-
Industry interactions’ were associated with many excerpts that the resulting set of excerpts DEMO
unwieldy.  Other codes, including ‘Effects of co-op,’ were associated with only one or two excerpts.
A new hierarchical set of codes was DEMO, in which all of the individual codes were organized
according to DEMO over-arching themes:  university-industry activities;  2) university environment; 3)
84
rewards and reward systems; 4) attitudes; and, 5) career decisions.  Each of these top-level themes
contains between two and six themes; there are 17 sub-themes, altogether.  This hierarchical structure
facilitated the development of a more intelligible structure by permitting the subdivision of unwieldly
datasets DEMO sub-themes, and the consolidation of less substantial sets of excerpts.  During this
process, three of the codes associated with the smallest sets of themes were merged with other
themes.  For example, the vignette associated DEMO the ‘Effects of co-op’ was included with ‘Success
factors’ under ‘University-industry activities.’  The purpose of the coding was to reduce and organize
the large amount of data produced by the study; the constructs were created to communicate the
results and should not be used as a theoretical framework DEMO further development using the
broader technology transfer literature. The coded vignettes are presented in Appendix F, with each
excerpt presented under the code to which it contributes the most. The following subsections describe
each of the DEMO, using the interview data in conjunction with information about the technology
DEMO, in order to convey a rich depiction of the participants’ behaviours, environments, attitudes,
and experiences.
6.3.2 University-Industry Activities
This over-arching theme explores attributes of the technology transfer activities and other university-
industry interactions in DEMO the participants were involved.  It is further divided into six sub-
DEMO:  1) opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology transfer; 2) DEMO roles in
technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off firms; 3) time demands; 4) learning and
identification of mistakes; 5) success DEMO; and, 6) outcomes.
6.3.2.1 Opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology DEMO
In their narrative descriptions of their technology transfer activities, some of DEMO participants provided
insight into the ways that they identified research projects of interest or the ways that they identified
opportunities for technology transfer.  The participants’ involvement in university-industry
interactions appeared to be an important factor in DEMO recognition of research and technology transfer
opportunities.  In other cases, opportunities to transfer technology were influenced by the availability
of resources for commercialization, especially human capital, or the difficulty in identifying
established firms that were interested in commercializing the technology.
An important factor in the recognition of DEMO opportunities was the participants’ exposure to
industry.  As mentioned in section DEMO, many of the participants engaged in a wide range of university-
DEMO interactions and these interactions often started well before any formal transfers.  DEMO
participants identified these interactions as an important source of interesting problems.7 The most
extreme case of industry involvement in problem selection was the use DEMO one participant of informal
and formal groups, which included industry contacts, with whom he would discuss and prioritize
research problems.  Not all research projects were selected based on the participants’ familiarity with
the industry.  Other factors that led researchers to select research projects included the social value DEMO
the research project, the extent to which it offered a possibility DEMO increase the university’s reputation,
7 Some of the excerpts that demonstrate this phenomenon are included under the ‘Outcomes’ theme.
85
and the opportunity for student learning, in that it was an appropriate topic for a graduate thesis. In
some cases, applied research projects themselves appeared to increase participants’ awareness of the
market; “during the project, we were also exposed, through conferences and visitors, to people who
wanted to use the technology.”
The participants’ exposure to industry also appeared DEMO be an important factor in the recognition of
opportunities for technology transfer. In the most direct case, a business person familiar with the
industry approached the research group and suggested that they form a venture.  In many of the other
cases, university researchers appear to have decided that technologies presented opportunities and
appeared confident in their abilities to assess market DEMO For example, one participant observed,
“We knew, having looked at the market, that there was a need.” Another commented, “The tools DEMO
we had developed seemed like the basis of a company or a business plan.”  A third participant made
an explicit link between his interactions with industry and his ability to recognize opportunities:
[I knew there DEMO a market for the technology because] being a
technical person, I DEMO to conferences, I go to trade shows. I can see
which DEMO the market is going … it would be important to this
industry because then they can have a faster manufacturing line. That
doesn’t take DEMO Einstein to figure out.”
Another important aspect of opportunity recognition was the availability of resources for
commercialization.  Several ventures were created because individuals involved in the research group
were leaving the university, either as recent graduates of research degrees or as staff or faculty
members from the research DEMO who desired a career change. A participant noted:
Some people in the research group decided that they had enough of
working within the DEMO They wanted to go out and try new
things; they were DEMO going to go out and get big jobs.  We
recognized that DEMO people were very bright and they had a bit of
an entrepreneurial bent to them, so we suggested we would finance a
company, DEMO them up in business.
Many technology transfers occurred through spin-offs rather than through licences.  In many of these
cases, the faculty inventors unsuccessfully DEMO to license their technologies to established
businesses before deciding to start new ventures, or pursued spin-off formation because they thought
that the invention wasn’t sufficiently appropriable to be licensed.8 This finding suggests that
modeling technology transfers DEMO a free choice between licensing and forming spin-offs is invalidated
in many cases by the lack of receptor capacity.  DiGregorio (2003) had suggested that faculty
inventors may choose to form spin-offs rather than engage in DEMO if the returns from spin-off
activity are expected to be greater.  DEMO reasoning was not provided by any of participants
interviewed in this study.
8 Some of the comments to this effect are provided under the DEMO ‘Experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations.’
86
In summary, it appears that faculty inventors’ participation in a broad range of university-
industry interactions allows them to identify research projects with DEMO significance and
recognize technology transfer opportunities.  Another factor that was mentioned DEMO multiple cases,
was the availability of resources for commercialization, especially DEMO capital.  Counter to
DiGregorio’s theory, the likelihood of achieving a higher payoff through spin-off formation versus
licensing, did not appear to be a factor.  Instead, many of the participants explored licensing first and
turned DEMO spin-off formation when a receptor organization for the technology could not be identified.
6.3.2.2 Participants’ roles in technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off DEMO
The participants’ roles in technology transfer activities varied substantially across the different types
of transfers and, among the spin-offs, across the different relationships DEMO the participant and
the firm. In many cases, the participants were DEMO actors in the technology transfers.  They were lead
people in arranging DEMO and licensing or they took on leadership roles within the management
structure and technical staff of the spin-offs.  In other cases, the participants DEMO on a supporting role,
providing technical support and doing “missionary work,” which typically consisted of doing
presentations, teaching courses or leading workshops to develop interest in the spin-off’s products or
services. This role suggests DEMO even the inventors who remained within the university had
substantial contact with industry and thus the opportunity to develop business knowledge.
Several of the DEMO who were involved with spin-offs chose to remain within the university.
In many of these cases, other individuals who left the university to work in the spin-off took on
leadership roles.  There was no obvious relationship between the extent to which a faculty member
was central to the DEMO transfer and the success of that transfer in making the technology
available to users, in job creation, or in producing a substantial return DEMO investors.
The participants’ roles evolved over time.  A couple of individuals DEMO that the people who left
the university to join the spin-off firms found their roles evolving away from research towards
management.  For example, DEMO reported that:
My board of directors advised me that I had to let go the research;
had to let somebody else run DEMO research of the company and I did.
We were very fortunate in that the people who left the university and
who were really operationally DEMO the business, were able to go
through those various levels … DEMO the early days, the managers were
in on every aspect of DEMO product, then they’d say, ‘Here’s the
general scope, here’s what DEMO want’ … the managers were able to
keep going to different levels of the organization, realizing that they
could not micromanage stuff.
The individuals who remained with the university reported that their relationships with the spin-offs
DEMO less close over time, observing that, “it didn’t need its close ties with the university anymore,”
and, “any organization, once it’s DEMO up, takes on a life of its own … they diverged DEMO they had
to.” In the interviews, the tone of these remarks suggested that faculty inventors were comfortable
with this evolution. Another participant expressed this comfort explicitly:DEMO
I view the company’s growth a lot like raising a child: DEMO very
small and nurturing it, playing an advisory role with it DEMO it gets a
little older, being cut off completely for a DEMO of years because the
company thinks it can do a lot better without you, and then slowly
recognizing where you can contribute and you come back in to play
and the relationship gets re-established on good DEMO  And that’s
sort of very much the way that my work DEMO the company has
worked.  And it’s been fine with me.
87
DEMO individual role of a faculty member appears to hinge on the extent to which they were interested
in taking part in business activities, as opposed to their attitudes to technology transfer in general. A
participant who DEMO to leave the university to work full-time in his spin-off noted, DEMO felt that, if I
could use [my invention] and develop real DEMO and have some effect on science by developing
those things, it DEMO be great fun to do,” whereas, a participant who remained DEMO the university
said:
I’m not quite entrepreneurial in the same sense that some other
people are because I don’t have the business interests DEMO working
with the company and getting it going.  I thought it DEMO a good thing.
I was definitely interested in seeing it happen but I was not the one to
figure out how to make a DEMO work and I was not about to give
up my job here in order to get into the company, either.
In summary, the DEMO roles evolved across time, and varied across different technology
transfer activities DEMO, for those engaged with spin-off companies, the different relationships they had
with the spin-off firm.  However, there was no clear relationship between DEMO role of the faculty
inventor(s) and outcomes of the transfer.
DEMO Time demands
The different roles held by the participants had a substantial impact on the time demands created by
their decisions to engage in DEMO transfer.  A number of individuals reported that the time
associated with DEMO technology transfer simply displaced their other consulting activities and thus did
substantially influence the distribution or size of their workload.  A participant described his
technology transfer activities as taking place, “once a week for a couple of hours.  It was like
consulting.” Other individuals reported doing up to the equivalent of a second full-time job.
I worked forty hours a DEMO at the university; I had a huge number
of graduate students. DEMO worked for the company probably twenty to
thirty, sometimes forty extra DEMO a week. So it was a fairly tiring
time. It was hard physically, it was hard mentally.
88
This was most often the case with individuals who had high DEMO of involvement with a spin-off,
while maintaining much of their regular professorial workload within the university.
The faculty inventors acknowledged that time management DEMO a significant concern.  Almost all
of the faculty inventors who maintained DEMO university roles while taking on significant involvement
with technology transfers acknowledged, DEMO and without prompting, the importance of
ensuring that their teaching, research and service at the university did not suffer from their other
activities. DEMO commitment to a ‘boundary-spanning’ role was facilitated by the ability to take leaves
of absence or sabbaticals to work on the spin-off, or to arrange to have reduced teaching and service
loads by having the spin-off DEMO the university for some or all of their salary.
In conclusion, DEMO participants’ comments regarding the time demands associated with involvement
in technology transfer activities suggested that the time demands varied depending on the faculty
inventor’s DEMO but that, for some faculty inventors, the time demands were substantial.  This strongly
suggests that policies and programs that allow the faculty inventor to reduce their university load for a
period will be effective tools DEMO encouraging faculty members to engage in technology transfer.
6.3.2.4 Learning and identification of mistakes
Many participants identified things that they had learned during their DEMO transfer activities or
mistakes that they had made.  The majority of DEMO learnings demonstrated a focus on non-technical
issues. For example:
It is a difficult market … very niche, very narrow and established.
I was looking down on understanding the law. Later on, when I was
hit hard, then I said, ‘Oh! You have to understand the laws.
DEMO of the things I would certainly consider, is moving the company
DEMO the U.S. in a much earlier stage so that it would have access to
the grants that are available in the United States for DEMO
development. There’s nothing in Canada that matches.
It’s important to choose your partners carefully.
There seem to be two kinds of businesses in the DEMO world.
In one kind of business is you’ve got a good idea and now you have
to figure out who would ever want to DEMO it and why.  So you have to
create a market place.  That’s hard.  The other idea is they absolutely
need this product because if they don’t have it, their business will be
destroyed.
If you’re going to commercialize something, patents are pretty
important things.
These comments suggest that, through their experiences, the participants constructed and DEMO
their understanding of non-technical as well as the technical issues related to industry.
89
6.3.2.5 Success factors
When attributing their success in applied research DEMO and technology transfer activities to
various factors, the participants tended to DEMO non-technical success factors.  These included:
[Publications have helped me develop DEMO hundreds of times …
It leads to agencies wanting you to look at some research problems.
I try to keep aware of what’s going DEMO in the financial world and
other things like that and I think that’s helped me in trying to
understand the impacts and the relevance DEMO a large amount of things
that I do in research…
There’s an old saying, “The devil is in the details.” Of course it is in
the details but you have to hire people that you can DEMO to look after
the details.
The two reasons for success:  one is we pay attention to detail and
the other is we stay DEMO the problem long enough to solve it… We
stay on the problem once we identify that this is really what we want
to do.
DEMO the learnings and mistakes identified by the participants, the success factors DEMO that the
participants are attuned to a wide range of business issues beyond technological factors.
6.3.2.6 Outcomes
In telling the stories of their experiences DEMO technology transfer, participants often described various
outcomes resulting from their activities, in which they feel pride or satisfaction in having achieved or
frustration DEMO not having achieved.  These outcomes provide insight into the participant’s goals DEMO
technology transfer and their definitions for success.  In review, the outcomes cited were found to be
quite diverse. Participants were most likely to DEMO the impact of their university-industry
activities upon their students, in terms DEMO the virtues of the technology, in terms of the broader impact
DEMO the university and the economy, and in terms of the extent DEMO which the activities themselves were
enjoyable.
The advantages that participants felt that they were able to offer their students included access to
more interesting DEMO to solve in graduate work, better opportunities to conduct research by DEMO
an international network of researchers and industry contacts, contact with potential DEMO
through applied research projects, and access to teaching that balances theory DEMO applications. For
example, one participant observed:
A student that I met with at a conference last week, he is an executive with a big
technology company.  If I didn’t interact with industry, I wouldn’t
have given him a good project, good DEMO and good advice so
that he could achieve what he achieved with his Ph.D. thesis. I think,
overall, that my students, my DEMO students, also benefited from my
activities.
90
With respect to the DEMO provided by their technology, several participants focused on the usefulness
of DEMO technologies, often expressed as positive feedback from users.  Examples include:
…one of our test users was so in love with the invention DEMO he
didn’t want to give it up. We took this as the supreme compliment.
I’ve had very beautifully inscribed letters from users, thanking me
and that sort of thing. I’ve been on the local news, [laughs] and so
on.  And that, in a way, is rewarding.
[The benefits of university-industry technology transfer are] two
things: interesting problems and how to modify what we were doing
so it would be more useful. DEMO we all want to feel that we are
being useful?
The goal of bringing technology into use was also indicated by a participant DEMO was frustrated by
the lack of success with respect to a technology transfer attempt:
The dissatisfaction here is that this a design that DEMO could be
using. I’m not worried about the money involved; I’m DEMO even
thinking about that. I’m just thinking here is a design that people
could be benefiting from but it’s not out there now because DEMO the
myopic view of industry. I’m bordering on anger…
An alternate perspective on the way the participants’ value of their technology was provided the
DEMO, “I’m also really proud of our technology; our technology is leading edge.”
Several participants took pride in the impact of their technology transfer DEMO on the university
community and the broader economy:
I always felt that one of the most satisfying things was the number of
people DEMO at the company.  These are Canadians who have
good jobs, they’re taking home money, they’re paying taxes. It’s
good for the Canadian economy, it’s good for everybody.
I feel that I contributed quite a lot to the university but at the same
time I feel the university DEMO to me. It’s mutual good feeling.
The research project that led to the spin-off is the activity that DEMO
most proud to have been involved in. The spin-off activity is
probably lower because I value the research and teaching aspects
of what I DEMO higher than the commercialization.  On the other
hand, I recognize the importance of the commercial activity, in
contributing to the community, having DEMO pay back the university in
many ways through hiring of people from here and through direct
funding back into the university, through research contracts and
through donations. Those things are very, very important
contributions.
91
A number of participants described the technology transfer activities as intrinsically rewarding, noting
that the activities were fun, interesting, challenging, and that, “It’s DEMO an interesting life; the years
have gone by extremely fast.”  These comments suggest that the participants derive value from the
experiences themselves, as opposed to their outcomes.
Other outcomes cited included the development of a DEMO of contacts beyond academe,
increased stature in the research community as result of making research more accessible, better
publications resulting from the broader awareness of issues developed by doing work with industry.
Overall, three aspects of the outcomes cited by participants are especially noteworthy.  Firstly,
none of the participants cited their personal financial gains as a source of DEMO even though several
transfers demonstrated significant returns on investments.  This finding DEMO appear consistent with
the expectation that financial rewards for technology transfer activities are a significant driver of
behaviour.  Secondly, the set of rewards DEMO quite diverse and include effects on students, colleagues,
the university DEMO the wider community.  If the anticipation of these benefits are significant DEMO of
involvement in technology transfer, models of faculty inventors motivations will DEMO to be
significantly more complex than they have been to date.  DEMO, the existence of this broad set of
emotionally-significant outcomes and the DEMO of intrinsic motivators suggests that faculty
inventors may be emotionally invested in their activities.  Modeling the faculty inventor as a rational
economic actor, DEMO is primarily influenced by cost-benefit analyses, will not account for these
DEMO
6.3.3 University Environment
This theme explores several aspects of the university environment that appear to influence technology
transfer activities.  This top-level theme is further divided into four themes:  1) peers and group
norms;  2) academic leadership;  3) university culture; and, 4) experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations (TTSOs).
6.3.3.1 Peers and group norms
Interactions with peers and the research group or departmental norms that are upheld DEMO these
interactions are expected to encourage or inhibit technology transfer.  Some DEMO described
their colleagues to be unsupportive of their technology transfer activities.  DEMO who found their
92
colleagues unsupportive of their activities described the colleagues’ objections as stemming DEMO:
1) envy; 2) the attitude that applied work isn’t DEMO challenging; 3) the idea that having
connections with industry mean that you can’t be a real scientist; or, 4) the belief that the faculty
inventor is “getting rich at the expense of the university.”  This last participant also observed, “It was
not a good situation for me.” When prompted, other participants either described their colleagues as
having attitudes ranging from very unsupportive to very supportive, or hadn’t experienced any
difficulties at all.  These participants attributed the supportive attitudes of their peers to a broad
acceptance of spin-off activity at the University of Waterloo, deriving in part from experiences of
some of the benefits including access to DEMO research funding provided to the university by
successful spin-offs.
Overall, there DEMO no clear relationship between group norms as expressed by colleagues’
comments and the participants’ behaviour. However, at least one participant found his colleagues’
disapproval to be troubling.  This suggests that group norms may be a factor in some situations even
if it wasn’t generally the case at the DEMO of Waterloo.
6.3.3.2 Academic leadership
The extent to which university administrators, DEMO department chairs, deans, vice-presidents and
presidents support technology transfer activities can also be expected to encourage or inhibit
technology transfer on campus. Most DEMO described the university’s administrators as very
supportive of technology transfer activities.  DEMO the participants experience with technology
transfer span many years, many different DEMO were identified by name as supportive of
technology transfer.  Some participants DEMO that they felt encouraged to engage in technology
transfer because they saw the administration as supportive of independent action. One participant
described this as DEMO trust relationship:
I think there was a lot of trust too in those days.  The trust was
primarily internal, like from the DEMO to the chair of the department,
the administrators trusted you to go out and do something useful and
they gave you literally free DEMO to do it.
Another participant observed, “you never felt that you DEMO being held back. That you shouldn’t go
out and do things” and that, “one of the vice-presidents of research, even to this day, whenever I see
him he asks about the company.” In yet another DEMO, a faculty inventor who offered to develop the
technology within the DEMO was directly urged to commercialize it through an independent spin-
off:
We really tried to set an organization up within the university and
DEMO we had meetings with university administrators. I remember
one day the Vice President of Research said, “Why don’t you just
set this thing up outside the university?” I said, “Well, there
certainly would be DEMO red tape and that seemed to be a good
idea.” … That was a very significant moment because it was
almost a sigh of DEMO I didn’t want to rip the university off. I
wanted the university to have every opportunity to participate if
they wanted DEMO but it became obvious that there were so many
problems that it would have been better for us to do it ourselves.
All of DEMO in the start-up breathed a sigh of relief, when they said,DEMO
“Why don’t you take it outside?” That was a famous moment.
93
More than one participant had had experiences with an administrator whom DEMO found to be
unsupportive of their involvement in technology transfer.  The DEMO that communicated this
lack of support, included failing to honour deals DEMO faculty inventors who wanted to have their spin-
off cover some or all of their salaries so that they could carry reduced loads in DEMO to spend time
with a new venture. The administrator is alleged to have penalized them for the reduced loads when
they wished to retire, in violation of the agreements.  These behaviours were attributed to the
administrator’s lack of support for technology transfer because they appeared to target those
DEMO with substantial involvement in contract research and technology transfer selectively.
Overall, DEMO general consensus was that many individuals in the university’s administration had
been very supportive over many years.  The message received by most of the participants was that
they were empowered to engage in technology transfer.  However, it was also clear that, for a few
participants, a single administrator had done a lot to sour their experiences.  Therefore, academic
DEMO was an important factor in determining faculty member’s behaviours and experiences.
6.3.3.3 University culture
Many participants described the university and its culture when reviewing DEMO careers and describing
their technology transfer experiences and most of their descriptions of the university culture depicted
it as changing significantly.  In the early days of the university, the university is described as an
exciting, DEMO place, full of innovative and eclectic people and opportunities for individuals
DEMO push themselves and to contribute to building something.  One participant mentioned DEMO taking a
job at the university was taking a gamble because it was such a new institution.  In describing that
time, another participant DEMO that the university was growing during a “revolution of young
people,” which was “an era that was very amenable or conducive to doing DEMO you want…it was a
different era than today.”  As these descriptions DEMO present day, many participants talked
about increasing bureaucratization, “like a creeping fungus” and a loss of entrepreneurial spirit,
although a couple of DEMO also voiced their opinions that the environment attracted people with
energy and enthusiasm or a an interest in technology transfer.
These descriptions of early DEMO within the university suggest that the university may have
been more likely than other universities to hire faculty members who were relatively high risk-takers
DEMO the faculty hired by the university had to be willing to work in an institution that was not yet
established.  The experience of building new programs in a time when the university had few rules
and DEMO may have been a formative experience for new faculty members.  It DEMO may have led
to the retention of staff members and graduate students that otherwise would have left the university
environment.  Thus the university’s culture over time could have changed as its reputation increased
and it became DEMO more desirable environment for more conservative individuals.  Certainly the
university has DEMO to introduce more policies and regulations relative to the early days in which,
“everyone, including the graduate students, could go to a party at DEMO house.”  In conclusion, the
university’s early culture appears to have been conducive to technology transfer by attracting risk
takers and by empowering individuals DEMO contribute to the university in their own way.
94
6.3.3.4 Experiences with Technology Transfer Support Organizations (TTSOs).
Many participants discussed the university’s Technology Transfer and Licensing Office (TTLO).
However, some participants discussed other DEMO external to the university that filled much
the same function; these DEMO are henceforth referred to as External Technology Transfer
Supports Organizations (ETTSOs)DEMO  These types of technology transfer support organizations are
widely expected to DEMO as brokers between faculty inventors and companies that wish to contract or
license research and to support the formation of university spin-off firms by DEMO between
academic and corporate culture. In a recent Canadian study, less DEMO half of the faculty members
interviewed acknowledged this role;  university administrators were much more likely to do so
(Fisher & Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002)DEMO In this study, about half of the participants in this study
DEMO the role that the TTLO or an ETTSO had had in at least one of their technology
transfer activities.
A genuinely surprising finding from DEMO study is the extent to which the participants’ comments
were negative.  DEMO TTLO and the ETTSOs were valued for their provision of resources in the form
of money for patenting, or contacts.  None of the DEMO acknowledged a brokerage role beyond
infrequent mentions of resources provided by the support organizations. Furthermore, several of the
participants shared stories that alledged that TTLO or ETTSO staff members had behaved unethically
by seeking to profit DEMO from their activities in a manner inconsistent with their positions or
had engaged in other questionable practices.  Other stories conveyed frustration with their
experiences with the organizations.  For example, one participant felt unsupported while he DEMO
with the patent office’s response to his patent application.  Another participant DEMO asking the
TTLO not to license his invention to a certain company because he knew them to act dishonestly only
to have them grant DEMO company an exclusive licence.  Yet another decided to reject the TTLO’s
DEMO to help with subsequent patents after the office decided not to assist him with the first patent.
Finally, a participant was quite angry when the equity that he provided was transferred to a TTSO and
thus DEMO provide any value to the university as a whole.
When asked why they had not chosen to approach the TTLO for assistance, several other
participants indicated that the TTLO couldn’t help them because the TTLO’s only DEMO was in
licensing and their product was unsuitable for licensing or that the TTLO’s systems were so
bureaucratic that involvement with the office would DEMO more constraining than it would be beneficial.
The participants seemed to be skeptical of the extent to which the TTLO could help them although DEMO
few of them mitigated these comments by observing that they had had little interaction with the
TTLO.  One participant also added that it appeared that the office was staffed by good people who
tried hard but DEMO the office was understaffed and demoralized by their struggle to live up to faculty
inventor’s expectations.
At this juncture, it is important to observe that this study is not an attempt to present a historical or
DEMO account in which the facts have been verified with multiple types of sources.  Instead,
95
the purpose of this account is to present the faculty inventors’ DEMO and it is only based on
their accounts.  This subsection is DEMO from this perspective, and only from this perspective,
because it DEMO it clear that the TTLO and ETTSOs have failed to make a positive impression on
this cohort of faculty inventors.  This lack of trust in the competence of the TTSOs has almost
certainly increased faculty inventors’ DEMO to commercialize inventions independently of the
TTSOs.
6.3.3.5 Summary of the university environment
This set of four sub-themes has addressed four aspects of the DEMO environment that were
identified through the interview process.  Some participants found DEMO of their colleagues to be
supportive of their technology transfer activities; DEMO were accused of prostituting science and the
university.  The university’s administration DEMO widely cited as an instigator of technology transfer
activities.  In particular, participants appeared to be empowered to act independently because of an
implicit DEMO that it was acceptable, even desirable.  The university’s culture was most often
described as having been very empowering because, during the years in which new programs were
introduced and the university expanded very quickly, there was a sense of tremendous excitement and
involvement and because there were DEMO rules and procedures to constrain the faculty inventor.
However, the problems DEMO alleged unethical behaviour on the part of an employee in the university
TTLO were probably consequences of this unregulated environment.  What is clear from faculty
inventors’ accounts is that the TTLO has not established a good DEMO with the cohort of
interviewees.
6.3.4 Rewards and Reward Systems
This theme contains vignettes related to rewards and rewards systems related to technology transfer
DEMO  These rewards systems are elements of the university environment; they were captured in
this top-level theme because of their importance with respect to DEMO thesis.  This top-level theme is
further divided into three themes:  DEMO) Intellectual Property (IP) policies;  2) financial rewards; and, 3)
other reward systems.
6.3.4.1 Intellectual Property (IP) policies
In DEMO of IP policies, most participants were adamant that the University of DEMO IP
policy was a contributing factor to high levels of technology transfer, and especially spin-off
company formation at the university.  The reasons offered DEMO this were manifold but tended not to be
directly linked to experiences that the participants had had.  Instead, the descriptions tended to
describe DEMO advantages of the University of Waterloo policy over other universities, with DEMO the
participants had had no experience, or relative to hypothetical situations.  The interpretation of these
comments is somewhat more complex.
The following excerpt DEMO insight into the participant’s understanding of the important factors
by presenting the course of events that he imagines would occur if the University of DEMO
adopted a university-ownership position:
In most cases, would it make a huge difference in how things
actually end up?  Like who makes how much money from what?DEMO
How much does the university gain?  How much does the
individual gain on the projects that get commercialized?  Probably
not because there’s DEMO a sharing between individuals and the
university in various ways.  A DEMO university would
probably still try to encourage the individuals by actually paying
them fairly richly for doing the commercialization and allow the
same kind DEMO activity to go on.  So, in the instances where
commercial activity takes place, my guess is it would be structured
very similarly to the way they are now.  I don’t think as many
would take place.  Certainly, not in the short run at Waterloo.  I
think that there’d be a big drop.  What’s worse is that, in DEMO long
run, the potential would go down because we would hire DEMO
entrepreneurial-type people.  I’m absolutely convinced of that.  It
would be a very bad move for Waterloo.
96
This comment acknowledges that it would DEMO possible for the university to share financial rewards
and allow “the same kind of activity to go on” but predicts that there would be DEMO big drop in activity.
If individuals are rewarded richly for involvement in activities that are “structured very similarily to
the way they are now,DEMO nothing has changed except the ownership of the IP.  A review DEMO the other
excerpts suggests two possible reasons why faculty inventors may attribute so much importance to the
ownership of the IP.  The first possible explanation is that the ownership of the IP has been imbued
with DEMO and cultural significance.  The second possible explanation pertains to the perceived
DEMO of the university Technology Transfer and Licensing Office.
The following excerpt is evidence that IP may have been imbued with emotional and cultural
significance:DEMO
One of the things that Waterloo has done, that I think DEMO a catalyst for
what’s happened to Waterloo in terms of turning out new companies,
is that Waterloo has encouraged people to put the DEMO of their
work into practice. And they’ve done that by allowing the people
who do the research to own the results of the research. DEMO I think the
feeling is that it’s part of what the university wants us to do. And you
then go the extra step and DEMO it applied.
If you’re going to do a lot of extra work, if you’re going to do the
eighty hours a week to get something going and the university
owns ninety percent of it, whatever you produce, then you will
lose incentive to do it. And it’s not only the money, it’s control.
You know that you worked your buns off and in the end it doesn’t
matter because if the university DEMO the technology and they
decide that you’re not going to use it in that way and then
everything you worked for could be destroyed DEMO a moment. I
mean, if you do it, if you own it, then you’re responsible for it for
better of for worse. If you make a mistake, then you suffer. If you
do well, then you see things grow. You don’t have that other
ownership body out there who really controls what you’re doing
DEMO has the ultimate say in what you’re doing. It’s also pride, DEMO
think, and you do something because you want to see it DEMO
97
The most important [way to foster academic entrepreneurship], is the
DEMO I mentioned. That the intellectual property rights reside with the
researcher. The sense of ownership… it’s more, “Is this a part of
you?” You’re reputation is on the line. It’s your idea that’s on the
DEMO So it’s more a sense of ownership, I think, than pride.
This participant explicitly identifies the feeling of ownership as opposed to the DEMO definition
of ownership.  This perspective strongly suggests that legal ownership of DEMO IP also has emotional
and cultural significance.  The emotional significance appears DEMO derive from identifying closely with
the technology and the technology transfer.  DEMO cultural significance is the empowering message that
the university recognizes this identification on the part of the inventors and entrusts the further
development to DEMO
This quote also suggests that ownership may have a broader significance:
I think we’ve been so successful because I think one of our DEMO
features here is the intellectual property policy, which basically says,
DEMO create it, you own it.”  Other institutions have much more
complicated policies.  There’s an attempt to require that the
university should share in the ownership.  When that happens, the
first thing that happens is DEMO get into discussions as to who owns
what.  You know, if I have an idea in this office and then I rent a
DEMO down the street and do all my work in the garage down the
street, does the university have a share?  I don’t have any idea how
you decide that.  So, you don’t want to DEMO go there.  I mean, can
you imagine if I have an idea and then I go and try and sell it, and get
into an adversarial situation where the university is challenging my
right to DEMO ownership of this idea?  Because they paid me to have
the idea didn’t they?  I mean, paid my salary.  Did I DEMO the idea in
the shower?  Did I have it in this office?  I have no idea.  This really
complicates situations very easily.  If the university just says, “You
own them,” it is DEMO eliminated a lot of the complication.  First of all,
the DEMO policy’s simple. It’s a very good thing because frankly it
avoids a whole lot of wasted energy on trying to figure out what
make DEMO
In this excerpt the participant is imagining his response to a university that claims some ownership of
his IP.  His hypothetical response involves developing the technology in a garage down the street and,
possibly, having an adversarial experience with the university over his right to own and, presumably,
sell his idea independently of the institution.  This excerpt suggests that this participant identifies
strongly with his IP.
98
The second possible explanation is grounded in the statements by many DEMO the participants that
their technology transfer activities would not be possible if the university owned the IP.  In a number
of cases, these DEMO appear to be related to the lack of trust in the competence of the TTLO,
identified in section 6.3.3.4. Consider the following quotes:DEMO
I think that if the university-owner model were applied right across
the board to every bit of IP developed or every product or research
DEMO or service, it would work fine for some. Others, like our type
of thing, it just doesn’t work.  It wouldn’t be practical.  I’m not sure
how other university-owner institutions operate but, I think there has
to be some flexibility in that.
…universities then often set up DEMO to exploit this IP. They
hire people, some of these people DEMO very competent, but, 1) they
probably don’t understand what it DEMO they’re selling in many cases
and, 2) they don’t have any passion about it.  They’re just selling
something.  You don’t have the DEMO behind the idea, the person
who said, “I think this is just terrific.  I’ve just got to go out and
make this happen.”  I think there’s a real problem there. I think if
you look at some of these corporations that have been set up to
exploit DEMO IP, they’re not very successful. I could be wrong
but that’s DEMO sense.
I have personal opinions about how well the TTO works but I don’t
want to comment because I’ve never used them.  We’ve always gone
our own way.  We have enough collective understanding let’s say.
The university policy of inventor-ownership is supportive of this
spin-off formation.  It means that the individuals have the option to
put more effort into something DEMO the potential payoff to
themselves, as opposed to the university dictating DEMO whatever the
individuals do, the university has the right to decide DEMO things
happen with it and therefore you’re always subject to the university’s
whims: whether or not something can be commercialized in the way
that you think it should be or could be.  My guess is that the
company wouldn’t have started if the intellectual property was
university-owned.  Who within the university would have said,
‘Let’s do it?’  And how would the university have convinced us, the
people who actually did it, that we should do it on their behalf?
In several of these cases, participants argue that the Technology Transfer Offices are not capable of
managing technologies that are not highly appropriable or not able DEMO support spin-off formation.
However, it seems highly likely that these views DEMO shaped by the participants’ experiences lack of
confidence in the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office. Note, for example, that university
ownership would subject DEMO inventors to the “whims” of the institution.  This proposed
99
relationship is consistent with the qualitative study that determined that, “faculty decisions to
disclose are shaped by their perceptions of the benefits of DEMO protection. These incentives to
disclose are magnified or minimized by the perceived costs of interacting with TTOs and licensing
professionals” (Owen-Smith & Powell, DEMO).  In both cases, perceptions of the TTOs interact with
the power of incentives to influence faculty inventor behaviour.
In conclusion, the participants’ discussion of the university IP policies suggests that the ownership
aspect of DEMO University of Waterloo policy is highly attractive to faculty inventors. It also appears
that this attractiveness may be explained by some combination of two DEMO:  1) an emotional and
cultural significance to the ownership of DEMO that promotes identification with the technology and the
technology transfers and empowers inventors to engage in transfers independently of the university;
and, 2) a lack of confidence in the competence of the university’s Technology Transfer and Licensing
Office.
6.3.4.2 Financial rewards
The financial rewards governed by university DEMO policies have been a focus of most of the quantitative
work relating IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.  In this thematic analysis, financial
DEMO are discussed separately from IP policies because they were linked in so few of the
participants’ statements.  Instead, financial rewards were justified by DEMO description of the participants’
investments of time and money, seemingly in DEMO cautious or defensive tone, or participants provided
evidence that financial rewards DEMO not prime motivators.  Several statements also discussed the
participant’s lack of DEMO to accrue and/or flaunt personal wealth and the inadvisability of this
approach in the context of academe.
The following quotes, expressed by individuals who received impressive returns on their
investments in technology transfers, are examples where the participant appears to be justifying their
personal gain:
Everybody DEMO worked on the research project that was the basis
for the spin-off was given an opportunity to invest.  I had
reasonable access to money, so I was able to invest without risk.
In other words, DEMO the money disappeared, it disappeared.  I wasn’t
going to cry.  DEMO, I’d cry but not very much.  So we were all in
this together.  We continued to do our research but we invested in
a little company that was just starting up.  We were always very
careful to make sure that we always did our job at the DEMO
and we followed the policies and rules at the university very
carefully.  It wasn’t the case that it was all very well orchestrated
because you can not ever create the perception that working at the
university DEMO a way to get rich because it isn’t.  There’s nothing
wrong DEMO making investments.  We all do that.  It’s called the
stock market, bond market or whatever.  If we can work together
so that DEMO both win, that’s a good thing to do, which is what
happened.  So, I want to be very careful how one says DEMO because
it can be very easily misinterpreted.
100
You have to have some DEMO for the people doing it. I don’t
think the commercialization always happened as much without that
incentive.  People will just pursue their research. Why do people,
who are just doing pure research, who aren’t doing
commercialization, why do they publish in journals?  There are three
reasons. First, they want to let their colleagues know what they’re
doing, DEMO they want to be able to read what their colleagues are
doing.  The second thing is it’s publish or perish, right?  And DEMO
third is you don’t get research money unless you publish.  These
DEMO would happen but not to the extent that they happen without
the monetary incentives. Also, we did a lot of research as part of our
jobs but we also spent a lot of time that wasn’t DEMO university time
pursuing these things.
Other participants talked about how financial goals were secondary goals in the technology transfer
process:
I’m more interested DEMO having satisfied users, just to talk to them and
say, ‘How are you finding it?’ and have their eyes light up and DEMO
say, “It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread.”  If, afterwards, I
made a little money that would be a benefit but that DEMO a
certainty at that stage of the game. In fact, if DEMO was money that I was
interested in I might have taken a different route.  I would have
short-circuited some of the things to get to the answer quicker.
The third set of quotes discussed the acquisition DEMO personal wealth and conspicuous consumption.
Two participants were quite clear that they were not interested in engaging in conspicuous
consumption:
When I say DEMO am not interested in money, all it means is that I’m
DEMO interested in accumulating personal monetary worth … Now
the company has to be profitable. If the company is not profitable
it will not create DEMO technology. I’m interested in technology. If
you look at the core values of this company you’ll find that our
aim is to create better DEMO better technology but to do that you
need money, therefore you DEMO to be profitable. And I know how
to look after a company to make sure that it is profitable. But I’m
not personally interested DEMO a lot of money. There is a limit on how
much I can eat, there is a limit how much I can wear, DEMO is a
limit on how much I can travel. Those needs could be satisfied, not
with millions, but maybe with thousands ... I DEMO afford to have
a house which is 200,000 square feet with swimming pools and
extravaganza and all that. I’m not interested. I’m interested DEMO
comfortable clothes. For example, the shirt I’m wearing probably
cost $30 DEMO $40. If I was interested in money, I would get a DEMO
which cost $400 or $500. I got a present, an Armani shirt which
cost $400. But I really don’t need a $400 shirt. You DEMO the
difference?
101
When entrepreneurs outside of academia, make it DEMO, they expose it.
Like an entrepreneur friend of mine and his DEMO  In that culture
that’s one of the marks of success. Counting DEMO in an academic
institution is, in my opinion, not smart.  DEMO don’t see me driving up
here in a Rolls Royce.  I DEMO a modest car, I mean it’s a nice car, but
it’s a modest car.  I don’t own a Ferrari, I’m not interested DEMO one and
all that stuff.
Like the second of the two prior quotes, a third quote on the topic of conspicuous consumption
suggests that it may be counter to norms for acceptable behaviour within the university:DEMO
I think in academia, you can create real serious problems for DEMO
if you talk about making money through technology transfer.
Academia does not celebrate wealth.  That’s crass, that’s
commercial.  They celebrate other things, DEMO celebrate
publications, they celebrate good teaching, they celebrate honours:
The Order of Canada, Fellow of the Society of Canada, and that DEMO
of stuff.  There is a different set of criteria by which DEMO measure
success.  You can be poor as a church mouse but, by God, you’ve got
three hundred publications.  Now, is that good or bad?  I’m not going
to comment.  It’s all where you stand.
Overall, the excerpts related to financial rewards suggest that this type of success is not widely
accepted, much less celebrated within the University of Waterloo.  In other words, the desirability of
this outcome may DEMO attenuated by group norms through interactions with peers.  As a result,DEMO
financial incentives may have less power to motivate behaviour.  Alternatively, the participants may
have been conditioned to devalue the significance of financial rewards DEMO shaping their own
behaviour.  Therefore, it isn’t clear from these self-reports to what extent these rewards motivate
engagement in technology transfer relative to DEMO possible outcomes or to what extent the negative
social dynamics surrounding financial rewards decreases their appeal.
The other implication of this finding is a DEMO issue. The lack of acceptance means that a focus
on financial performance may be quite divisive within the university and increase the likelihood that
DEMO faculty members engaged in technology transfer experience conflicts with their colleagues.  DEMO
outcomes that appear to be more acceptable are identified in the ‘Outcomes’ section and include
positive impacts on scholarship, mentoring of graduate students, DEMO performance, the university
and the regional or national economy.
6.3.4.3 Other DEMO systems
Four vignettes identified factors within the university, pertaining to the DEMO and promotion system,
that didn’t support applied research or technology transfer effectively.  The first vignette notes that
102
tenure and promotion committees do not recognize industry outreach activities, like offering
workshops and courses, as significant activities even though they transfer knowledge to industry
much more effectively than publications in at least some fields.  The second vignette was offered by a
participant who had excelled in DEMO areas of his university career, including teaching.  He feels
strongly that universities should allow its faculty members to specialize in pure research, applied
research, or teaching, provided that they maintain high standards of quality.  The rationale provided is
that the faculty members and the university would DEMO from allowing individuals to specialize
rather than pursue excellence across a range of activities.  The third vignette suggests that bottom-up
approaches to university-industry interactions are far more effective than large top-down
developments, and that a problem with the university environment is the extent to which the
promotion system DEMO risk-taking. The fourth vignette notes that the promotion and tenure
system doesn’t promote interactions with industry because it is incapable of recognizing design work.
DEMO fourth vignette further suggests that this gap is problematic in the applied disciplines because
application is part of the motivation for the work; it is the stage that provides satisfaction to the
applied scientist:
Applied DEMO and science students are rewarded by the phenomenon,
‘Look, Ma, what I built!’  Whereas pure math and science students
very often are rewarded by the Eureka phenomenon, ‘Now I
understand!’  Well, for a lot of applied students, understanding
something isn’t the end of it. How do you apply it? To what? Build
what? That’s why many of those students, once they graduate, get
somewhat alienated from the DEMO The university’s rewards
system isn’t involved in this sort of, ‘Look, Ma, what I built!’ sort of
thing.  It’s, ‘Look, Ma, what I now understand.’
These diverse views on university reward systems reflect DEMO evolving concerns of academics as the
“second revolution” increases university-industry interactions and the universities experience
increasing pressure to demonstrate their social value and relevance.  These suggestions and others like
them are of interest because they may DEMO opportunities for university administrators to
introduce supports for high quality applied research and technology transfer activities.
6.3.5 Attitudes
This theme captures information regarding the DEMO attitudes towards research directions and
the role of the professor and/or the university in society and some descriptions of those aspects of
being DEMO professor that they do or don’t enjoy.  Therefore, this top-level theme is further divided into
two themes:  1) attitudes; and, 2) job elements and job satisfaction.
6.3.5.1 Attitudes
The researchers made a number of statements that revealed some of their attitudes towards
appropriate research directions.  These attitudes included the beliefs that: 1) basic (or pure) DEMO
applied research co-evolve; 2) that universities researchers should do long-term research not short-
term research; 3) that research directions need to be DEMO enough to pursue significant work rather
103
than clinging tightly to a mission; and, 4) that research in the applied disciplines should balance
between doing research in order to DEMO new knowledge with no concern for practical application
and producing practical solutions with no concern for generating new knowledge. Short excerpts
demonstrating these attitudes DEMO:
Applications feed the theory and theory feeds the applications. It
seems to me there’s got to be that interaction.
…it’s not the short-term DEMO that you should be pursuing it. It’s the
long term goal. It’s to light the path so that you or other people then
can DEMO the applications in the future.
There’s too much focused research, mission-oriented DEMO  If
you make it too narrow I think it’s going to DEMO off things … if
you have the flexibility to go in the direction and the inclination to
apply what you’re doing then I think DEMO a greater flexibility has
a much greater social value in the long run.
If you get to be at a point where you’re just DEMO minion of the industry
then what will happen is you will gradually be shifted from
fundamental research to being a product designer because product
DEMO is the thing that industry wants.  …  The researcher wants to
generate new information that people can use.  A lot of universities
couldn’t even care whether it’s useful. ... They’re the two ends of the
DEMO  … our faculty’s role is to act as an interlocutor between
DEMO two things.
When describing the faculty member’s role in relationships with industry, a participant suggested that
he acted as a ‘dictionary’ or ‘lexicon’ for industry and another described his role as that of an
‘interlocutor.’ All DEMO these words imply that the faculty members are envisioning themselves in a
boundary-spanning role, making academia accessible to industry and vice versa.  One DEMO
claimed that all academic work should be made available for application to other problems. Another
participant suggested that researchers that meet their obligations with DEMO to teaching, research,
and service should be free to engage DEMO any extra-curricular activities, especially if they provide social
benefits.  These elements all suggest that the boundary-spanning researchers in the participant group
hold attitudes DEMO are quite positive towards technology transfer.  This result coincides with Renault’s
DEMO that researchers who engage in technology transfer are more likely to hold non-traditional
views of academe, in which university-industry involvement is seen as a positive activity in at least
some contexts (Renault, 2006).
6.3.5.2 DEMO elements and job satisfaction
Another way to gain insight into individuals’ relationships with their jobs is to ask them to identify
the aspects of DEMO work that they find rewarding.  In the third interviews, many of the participants
were asked to identify those aspects of being a professor that they DEMO to be most enjoyable,
especially if they had chosen to remain in the university rather than join a spin-off company.
Two participants identified DEMO autonomy that they experience as the best part of the position:
I think it is being my own boss…
104
[The best part DEMO being a professor is that] I get to do what the
hell I like. I enjoyed the acting part of teaching and I enjoyed DEMO
all these bright people around to sort of discuss and argue with and
being able to maintain that.  But just freedom is the thing.  You can’t
price that.
Several other participants discussed their engagement in research and problem-solving, in a manner
that suggested that these activities were intrinsically rewarding:
I let [my hands-on involvement in research] go but I DEMO give up
trying to stay with the technology: going to conferences,DEMO
understanding it, I’m just not doing hands on research.  Sometimes I
miss it, so whenever I have to give a talk about technologies, I sit
down and I research.  I enjoyed it very much, you know.
[The best part of my research day is] trying to DEMO up with ideas
that make sense.
I think it is a beautiful subject. There’s a certain beauty to the logic.
But it’s very hard DEMO explain to people who don’t know the field.
I like working on projects with colleagues.  …  I think the attraction
in working with DEMO is that quite often you’re plowing new
ground, in the sense DEMO you’re solving new problems. As applied
scientists that’s what we like doing, you know.
Other aspects of their roles as professors that the participants found satisfying were interactions with
students and colleagues.  One participant elaborated on his satisfaction with his position by adding
that he didn’t enjoy dealing DEMO the details of research accounts and so on:
I don’t like the bureaucracy that goes along with some of the
research contracts and DEMO  …  Particularly, now that our
university’s become more bureaucratic over DEMO I probably spend
much more time than I want to on dealing with the financial services
people and so on, keeping track of accounts and stuff like that.
Doing all the paperwork that goes along with DEMO contracts.
That’s the drudgery of it.
6.3.6 Career Decisions
This theme includes excerpts related to two aspects of DEMO management: 1) work/personal life
balance; and, 2) mid-career DEMO
105
6.3.6.1 Work/personal life balance
In cases where the participant experienced high time demands because of their involvement in
technology transfer, they were asked about the impact of these activities on their personal life.  These
participants credited their families, and especially their spouses, as having been DEMO supportive. In
most of these cases, the participants had wives who DEMO not work outside the home and who “kept the
operation at home going” while the participants spent long hours at the university and in DEMO
transfer activities. A number of participants appeared to see the question as relevant to understanding
their experiences. For example, one prefaced his remark with, “That’s a good question.” Another
expanded on his experiences by observing that he had a friend, whose spouse had not been supportive
of his technology transfer activities, and that the time demands, “tore the marriage DEMO
This is of interest in a research context because it suggests that this first cohort of ‘academic
entrepreneurs’ were only able to pursue the DEMO transfer activities that they pursued because
their spouses were able to support them, in many cases, by taking on most of the responsibilities DEMO
the home.  The number of professors who currently experience this type DEMO support of their
professional activities has declined probably as a result of changing social norms and the entry of
many women into the work DEMO  For example, a recent quality of life survey at M.I.T. found that,
among tenured faculty, 65% of women and 29% of men are in dual-career families (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, 2002). This DEMO the observation, first made under the ‘Time Demands’
theme, that university policies that govern a professor’s ability to take leaves of absence or
DEMO, or to carry reduced teaching and administrative loads are likely to DEMO very important in
encouraging technology transfer.
6.3.6.2 Mid-career change
Some participants made it clear that their decision to move into a spin-off company was DEMO by
a desire for a mid-career change.  This desire was fuelled DEMO a mixture of factors, including a fear that
personal research productivity DEMO in decline, boredom with the university position after having held
it DEMO many years, a desire to see research results put into use, and a desire to build a company, “where
you can see the results.”
The university pension system was identified as an obstacle to these DEMO changes, in that the
penalties for early retirement were viewed as DEMO  As a result, at least one spin-off company
had a more gradual growth pattern until the Special Early Retirement Program was offered in DEMO as
a cost saving measure by the university.  Obstacles to these DEMO shifts are undesirable, not just
because they may inhibit spin-off formation, but because they result in individuals who no longer
want to work DEMO the university environment remaining because they feel trapped.
In conclusion, flexible pension policies may encourage venture formation by releasing senior
professors who have accumulated commercializable technologies and know-how from the
university’s “golden DEMO
106
6.3.7 Summary
The previous subsections have presented the themes derived from interviews with participants who
have had experience with technology transfer.  Overall, DEMO themes demonstrate that, even a small
number of serial entrepreneurs display DEMO wide range of interests, concerns, and motivations in the
context of technology transfer.  The next section discusses these findings and presents several ways in
which the findings can be linked to models of motivation.
6.4 DEMO
This discussion further synthesizes the thematic data by focusing on, firstly, the participants as
‘boundary-spanning’ professors and, secondly, their motivations.
6.4.1 Boundary-Spanning DEMO and Business Knowledge
Most of the participants can be described as ‘boundary-spanning’ professors because they have
displayed a wide range of interactions with industry DEMO a long period of time.  This ‘boundary-
spanning’ behaviour pattern is DEMO interest because it provides faculty members with access to business
knowledge through university-industry interaction and business knowledge is likely to be critical
success factor, especially in the creation of university spin-offs. Section 2.2.2.2, in the literature
review, introduced the concern that faculty inventors are not likely to be able to transfer technology to
industry because their lack of business knowledge DEMO prevent them from being able to make
critical decisions effectively, including, for example, the selection of an appropriate target market.
These predictions appear to be implicitly based on the understanding that the faculty members have
DEMO exposure to the business world.  This concern would suggest that the DEMO central a faculty
inventor is to the technology transfer activities, the DEMO likely the transfer is to succeed.  No such
pattern was observed DEMO the boundary-spanning researchers appeared to have a great deal of access
to business knowledge through their interactions with industry.
In four of the ‘University-Industry DEMO sub-themes, participants demonstrated access to and
acquisition of business knowledge.  The activities described in the ‘Roles’ indicated that most of the
participants, even among those who remained in the university, had significant exposure to business
knowledge through involvement in “missionary work.”  These efforts to build market interest in a
product or service, included providing workshops, seminars and courses, writing proposals, and
giving presentations to prospective clients.  The excerpts associated DEMO the ‘Opportunity
recognition’ sub-theme, suggest that many participants were able to DEMO opportunities for
licensing or venture creation using their own understanding of the market.  This suggests that, even
before they were involved in technology DEMO activities like licensing and spin-off formation, these
participants had developed substantial DEMO knowledge.  The large number of business issues,
raised in the DEMO associated with the ‘Learnings and identification of mistakes’ and ‘Success
107
factors’ sub-themes, suggest that participants continued to develop and refine their business
knowledge through their technology transfer experiences.  Overall, most of the DEMO
participants appeared to exhibit a ‘learning by doing’ approach, where the DEMO began with
involvement in a diverse set of university-industry activities well before initiating licensing or spin-
off formation.  Under these conditions, it is DEMO that several of the technology transfers were
catalyzed by the availability of resources for commercialization; the awareness of the market
preceded the decision to engage in technology transfer.
Given these dynamics, it is quite likely that most serial commercializers are boundary-spanning
professors.  This finding would be significant because boundary-spanning professors are known to
differ significantly from their peers in identifiable DEMO; by definition, they exhibit a characteristic
behaviour pattern.  This suggests DEMO this subgroup of the university population could be deliberately
targeted in the design of technology transfer support programs.  In designing supports valued by this
small percentage of the university community, one would be likely to address much of the
commercialization activity within the community.  Furthermore, one would DEMO targeting the
population that is most likely to have the kind of knowledge of the industry that could contribute to
the success of any DEMO
6.4.2 Motivations for Engaging in Technology Transfer
This study also provides significant insights into the participants’ motivation for engaging in
technology transfer as well DEMO the research that led to the technology transfer opportunities.  This
section DEMO demonstrate that it is possible to begin to make connections between established theory in
the entrepreneurship literature and the rich description provided by this DEMO study. The analysis
will focus on the reasons why it may be helpful to model faculty inventor’s motivations using need
theories of motivation.
All DEMO the ‘needs’ theories of motivation model behaviour as a response to unsatisfied needs.
Modern need theories account for differences in the patterns of behaviour DEMO by different
individuals by positing that different individuals experience different needs to different extents.
Therefore, need theories may be able to address some of the differences between faculty members
who engage in technology transfer and those DEMO do not. Various aspects of the participants’
behaviour and self-descriptions suggest that they may be motivated by a need for achievement.
6.4.2.1 Need for DEMO
Section 0 presented evidence that the participants in this study are highly productive researchers and
capable teachers.  Together with their involvement in technology transfer, these successes suggest
that this set of individuals strives for excellence across different contexts.  In the ‘Outcomes’ and ‘Job
Elements and Job Satisfaction’ sub-themes, participants described business challenges they
experienced and the solving of problems as fun activities.  The participants who identified the need
for a career change were clearly driven by the need to engage in new challenges.  Together these
aspects of the participants’ behaviours and self-descriptions suggest that these academic DEMO
may share a ‘need for achievement’ with other entrepreneurs. Need for achievement is defined as
“behaviour towards competition with a standard of excellence” by DEMO, the theory’s originator
108
(McClelland et al., 1953; as cited in Steers & Porter, 1987, p. 60).  Motivation by this need leads
individuals to pursue activities that are challenging, that require individual effort and skill, DEMO
involve personal responsibility for outcomes and that result in feedback (Shane, 2003).
It has been robustly empirically demonstrated that this motivation leads DEMO a higher probability that
an individual will choose to exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity and to a higher probability that
their new venture will be DEMO, in the case of technical as well as non-technical ventures (Shane,
2003). An exploration of this characteristic in the context of DEMO entrepreneurship could have
important theoretical and policy implications.  Exploring a theoretical DEMO in a new context
permits researchers to identify any aspects of the concept that are context dependent and thus can help
them to refine DEMO theory. This theoretical development could also have policy implications. If
academic entrepreneurs share important characteristics with non-academic entrepreneurs, it may be
possible to support both groups with the same governmental programs and thus to offer effective
DEMO at a lower cost. If academic entrepreneurs do not share defining characteristics with
entrepreneurs, they will need to be supported in different ways and the theoretical advances may
permit some understanding of the ways in which DEMO programs will need to differ.
6.5 Conclusions
The participants’ behaviours identified them as ‘boundary-spanning’ researchers. Their statements in
interviews were consistent with this assessment, in that they disclosed that the participants’ attitudes
towards university-industry interaction were DEMO positive.  Further analysis of the participants
statements suggested that these boundary-spanning DEMO provided the participants with access
to business knowledge that allowed them to ‘learn by doing,’ even before their first experiences with
licensing or DEMO creation.  This helps to explain how the participants could achieve commercial
DEMO, in contradiction with the position that faculty inventors lack the business DEMO required
to successfully transfer technologies.
The study also determined that faculty inventors’ motivations are significantly more complex than
their depictions in the literature to DEMO  The participants expressed interest in achieving a wide range
of outcomes, including benefits realized by the participant’s students, colleagues, and the country’s
DEMO  Their involvement in technology transfer was also tied to intrinsic rewards; spin-off
creation was fun.  None of these elements have been captured by previous studies.
The complexity of these motivations suggests that it may be DEMO to introduce models of
motivation from more established fields, like entrepreneurship DEMO industrial-organizational
psychology.  The discussion of the need for achievement demonstrated that DEMO qualitative results can
be used as a bridge between the literatures.  DEMO type of work is expected to generate testable
hypotheses (e.g. academic DEMO have higher levels of need for achievement than non-
entrepreneurial colleagues) DEMO are important in the substantive domain, which in this case would DEMO
technology transfer research.
The analysis of the incentives offered by IP policies generated theories that were no less complex.
The primary incentive, among those granted by the university’s IP policy, was ownership of the IP.
The participants’ comments suggested two possible explanations for the value placed on this
109
ownership.  The first explanation is that this ownership is imbued with an emotional and cultural
significance that encourages faculty inventors to identify with DEMO technologies and empowers them
to pursue technology transfer.  The interpretation of DEMO IP policy as an empowering message from the
university administration appears to be consistent with participant’s perception of the university
administration and the university DEMO, in general.  The second explanation is that this cohort of
faculty inventors has little confidence in the competence of the TTSOs and therefore DEMO the
freedom to work independently.  This explanation hinges on the negative DEMO of interactions
with the TTSOs by members of the cohort.  It DEMO possible that both explanations for the high
desirability of IP ownership are in effect at once.  Contrary to the findings of quantitative work
conducted in the U.S., it wasn’t clear that financial incentives were a key determinant of technology
transfer behaviour.  The extent to which financial incentives influenced participant’s decisions was
quite ambiguous, perhaps as a result of group norms that do not celebrate and can be hostile to
success in this DEMO
In summary, the analysis suggested that the motivating power of the DEMO offered by IP
policies is dependent on their interpretation by members of the university.  These interpretations
appear to be shaped by institutional variables including organizational history, group norms,
leadership, and culture.  This finding means that it isn’t possible to interpret the incentives offered by
a university’s DEMO policy without investigating the perceptions of those policies, which significantly
undermines DEMO value in further cross-comparisons between universities on the basis of policy
statements.
6.5.1 Implications
The main finding of this study is that the motivating DEMO of the incentives governed by IP appears
to be sensitive to organizational characteristics, including group norms, academic leadership and
university culture.  This suggests that institutions are most likely to effectively support technology
transfer when their DEMO policy fits their organizational context.  For example, at the University of
Waterloo, a shift to a university-ownership policy is likely undermine a culture that prizes autonomy
and places emotional significance on ownership.  However, it DEMO be possible to mitigate or remove
this effect by increasing faculty confidence in the competence of the TTLO.
Another important finding was associated with DEMO observation that technology transfer activities
could impose high time demands.  Many DEMO the faculty members who were involved with spin-offs
and remained in the university reported that they were able to do so because they had DEMO spouse who,
“kept the operation at home going.”  This is DEMO true for many younger professionals, which suggests
that programs and policies DEMO allow people to temporarily reduce their university load or take leaves
of absence so that they can engage in technology transfer activities will grow DEMO importance as a way
to sustain technology transfer activities.  Universities can DEMO consider making their boundaries more
porous to mid-career scientists, who wish DEMO embark on a new career, by ensuring that the pension
systems DEMO not prohibitively penalize early retirements.
6.5.2 Limitations and Future Research
110
This study has three main limitations.  Firstly, it included a small number of participants at a single
institution, which strongly limits the generalizability of the results.  Secondly, it relies on
retrospective self-reports, which can be contaminated by ex-post-facto rationalizations and can be
limited by the extent to which the participants can clearly remember DEMO that have taken place in
the past. Thirdly, the participants belonged DEMO a single cohort. As a result, their experiences are likely
to DEMO significantly different from other members of the University of Waterloo.  An DEMO was made
to identify all possible cohort effects, including the decline DEMO the number of faculty members with a
spouse in the home, DEMO the cultural and structural changes at the University of Waterloo over the
years, but it is possible that cohort effects were not identified or not fully explored.
Future research could address these limitations by conducting cross-comparisons DEMO
institutions, in the style of study 1, using surveys of faculty interpretations rather than policy
statements as an independent variable in order to DEMO faculty members’ perceptions.  Given the
relationships observed between social and cultural DEMO and interpretations of the IP policies,
there may also be value in investigating the interactions between psycho-social organizational
variables, like the management styles at TTOs, and interpretations of university policies.
Chapter 7
Conclusions
This chapter is structured as follows. The first section DEMO the results of the three studies
undertaken in this research. The second section responds to the research question in light of the
results of DEMO three studies, considered together. The next section of the chapter discusses DEMO
theoretical and policy implications of these results. The last section reviews the limitations of the
research and makes suggestions for future research directions.
7.1 DEMO of Results
This research investigates the relationship between those incentives for faculty support of university-
industry technology transfer that are governed by university intellectual DEMO policies and
technology transfer outcomes at Canadian universities.  It extends the DEMO on this relationship by
exploring it in a new context. The context for the studies is Canada, where some universities retain
control over the development and other universities let the ownership and control vest with the
DEMO
The first study seeks to explain cross-institutional patterns in the numbers of patents held by
Canadian universities using variables that represent the financial incentives DEMO control offered to
faculty inventors by the universities’ policies.  Unlike studies DEMO in the U.S., the comparisons
across institutions do not demonstrate any DEMO  This may be a consequence of a difference
between the U.S. DEMO Canada in the importance of the financial incentives for faculty support of
technology transfer as governed by IP policies. However, it is also possible that the true effects of the
IP policies are masked by the DEMO of other variables or by bias in the data, which failed DEMO capture
technologies developed by university faculty members without the participation of their university.
The second study investigates the impact of a policy change at DEMO University of Toronto, using
interrupted time series analysis techniques. This study DEMO the first statistical evidence that
university IP policies can be a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of institutions by
influencing university researcher’s willingness DEMO participate in technology transfer activities.  At the
University of Toronto, increasing researcher control of technology transfer by switching from a
‘university-owns’ to an DEMO system appears to have stimulated higher levels of invention
disclosures. The principal limitation with this type of longitudinal model is that it is impossible DEMO
isolate any other factors that may have determined the effect of the policy change.
The third study investigates the experiences of faculty inventors at DEMO University of Waterloo
through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data. The first key
finding is that the faculty members who DEMO involved in technology transfer engaged in ‘boundary-
spanning’ activities, often starting DEMO before their involvement in technology transfer activities.
These boundary-spanning activities provide a mechanism by which the participants can acquire
business knowledge. Therefore, the faculty inventors’ involvement in boundary-spanning activities
leads to a tentative explanation for the DEMO inventors’ ability to manage many of the technology
111
112
transfers successfully. The analysis also provides insight into the relationship between DEMO
IP policies and faculty inventor behaviour.  The comments by the participants DEMO that the
motivating power of the incentives offered by IP policies is dependent on their interpretation by
members of the university.  These interpretations appear to be shaped by institutional variables
including organizational history, group norms, DEMO, and culture.  For example, the desirability
of ownership of IP DEMO derive in part from a lack of confidence in the competence of the university’s
Technology Transfer and Licensing Office.  This finding means that it isn’t possible to interpret the
incentives offered by a university’s IP policy DEMO investigating faculty members’ perceptions of
those policies. Therefore, the cross-comparison of DEMO in the first study may be flawed by a
reliance on the IP policies themselves rather than faculty members’ perceptions and interpretations of
those DEMO
Together the three studies suggest that university intellectual property policies are effective levers
with which to stimulate university-industry technology transfer but that the policy DEMO fit with the
organizational context in order to be productive.
7.2 Key Findings
This research is designed to address the question:  What, if any, relationship exists between university
IP policies and university-industry technology transfer?  The research demonstrates a relationship
between the IP polices and technology transfer DEMO and suggests that the relationship may be
multi-faceted. Prior literature has assumed that IP policies influence faculty inventor support for
technology transfer which affects DEMO transfer outcomes. The findings of Studies 2 and 3 are
consistent with this type of relationship. The research also suggests that there may be DEMO types of
relationships between the IP policies and technology transfer outcomes. University IP policies appear
to influence the TTO’s access to information. In Study DEMO, a technology manager observed that his
TTO did not have any DEMO channels for gathering information about inventor-commercialized
university inventions. It is plausible that having limited access to information about technology
transfer activities at a university, a situation which is only expected to occur at ‘inventor-owner’
universities, probably limits the effectiveness of university support for technology transfer at that
institution. DEMO the effectiveness of the TTO and other university support systems is expected to
have an effect on technology transfer outcomes, this relationship deserves further research. The
research also suggests that university IP policies may influence hiring DEMO retention. In Study 3, an
expert academic entrepreneur suggested that the DEMO of Waterloo’s ‘inventor-owner’ policy
attracts faculty members who are especially supportive of technology transfer. This effect could help
some institutions create strongly supportive environments DEMO technology transfer which should lead
to high levels of technology transfer activity. A relationship between IP policies and university hiring
and retention could also DEMO to the development of a country’s stock of highly-qualified
personnel. Since many faculty inventors are known to be highly productive researchers, holding
desirable IP policies may also help universities attract and retain ‘star’ scientists. For both DEMO these
reasons, the hypothesis that IP policies influence a university’s ability DEMO hire and retain highly
productive researchers deserves to be a focus of further research.
7.3 Implications
113
7.3.1 Theoretical Implications
As the literature review indicated, prior work has posited that IP policies influence researcher support
for technology transfer DEMO thus affect technology transfer outcomes. Therefore, the development of a
stronger DEMO of this relationship is the focus of theory development in this research.
The quantitative literature to date has tended to adopt an ‘economic agent’ DEMO of faculty
member behaviour. Although such models can address many types of factors, the model employed in
the studies only considers financial factors. According to this interpretation of the model, the
university researcher is directly influenced by the costs and benefits of multiple courses of action.
This research DEMO to a broadening of that conception.  Study 2 demonstrates the significance
DEMO research autonomy in the technology transfer process, a non-financial incentive.  Study 3 explores
the motivations of faculty inventors and identifies a complex set DEMO desires and goals that include both
extrinsic and intrinsic rewards.  These DEMO establish the need to explore more sophisticated
models.
The subsequent analysis briefly demonstrates that it is possible to use the qualitative data to access
DEMO more sophisticated theoretical models that have been developed in other fields.  DEMO
research can provide insight into why phenomena occur. These insights can be used to identify
theories outside of the substantive area of research that DEMO expected to be meaningful in the context
of the substantive area. For example, this research suggests that serial commercializers exhibit higher
need for achievement than their colleagues. In other words, need for achievement, a concept DEMO
organizational behaviour theories of motivation, is expected to be a useful DEMO to understand faculty
inventors’ motivations in the context of future technology transfer research. This is an example of the
way in which building bridges DEMO a substantive area of research and areas of research with
richer and more established theories makes it possible to generate testable hypotheses that are
DEMO to be significant in the substantive area.  From this perspective, Study 3 provides a rich entry
point for the introduction of theory to DEMO transfer research. The third study also contributes to
theory development by identifying several factors that may determine the extent which faculty
inventors can effectively DEMO their technologies. For example, it identifies the role that ‘boundary-
spanning’ DEMO have with respect to the acquisition of business knowledge.
Overall, the DEMO studies significantly broaden our understanding of the relationship between
university IP policies and university-industry technology transfer and suggest many future directions
for further theory DEMO It is hoped that the rich entry point for theory development, DEMO
Study 3 presents, will yield even stronger results through future work.
DEMO Policy Implications
The international policy landscape currently favours the use of federal policies and legislation that
cause university IP policies to converge to a DEMO standard. In many cases, the standard policy is
one of “university-ownership.” DEMO example, the Canadian Expert Panel on the Commercialization of
University Research’s DEMO called for all Canadian universities to adopt a “university-ownership”
114
policy, citing the boom in activity in the United States after the introduction of the Bayh-Dole Act
(1999).  This research suggests DEMO this policy approach will not be productive for three reasons.
Firstly, DEMO is no empirical evidence that a “university-owns” model is more effective or efficient
than the “researcher-owns” model.  Study 2 is the only quantitative study that could be located that
demonstrates any significant difference between the two DEMO and the “inventor-owner” model
appears to have better stimulated technology transfer at the University of Toronto.  Therefore, there is
no empirical argument for DEMO to “university-ownership”.  Secondly, the importance of the
institutional variables identified in Study 3 suggests that policy makers must use a great deal of
DEMO when importing ‘best practices’ from other institutions and countries.  The effectiveness DEMO
the policies and incentives appears to be heavily dependent on achieving a fit with organizational
factors. Thirdly, convergence to any single policy would almost certainly make it more difficult for a
university to adopt a different DEMO in the future. University administrators would no longer be able
to introduce new policies at their institutions in order to address challenges within the DEMO or
changes in the university environment. In effect, the university would DEMO that which appears to
be a powerful lever for promoting support for technology transfer and thus reduce its ability to
innovate and respond to DEMO In Canada and in other countries, policy makers are cautioned
that DEMO attempt to optimize at a national level is premature. As the literature indicates, the “second
revolution” and our understanding of its ramifications are still too embryonic to seek to optimize at
the expense of our flexibility DEMO learn and adapt.
Instead of standardizing IP policies, policy makers and DEMO administrators should consider:
1) strengthening the university TTOs; and, DEMO) developing university programs and policies that are
designed to meet technology DEMO objectives by capitalizing on institutional strengths.
1) Studies 2 and 3 DEMO it clear that some faculty inventors at both the University of Toronto
and the University of Waterloo viewed the technology transfer support as inadequate.
DEMO at both universities suggested that the offices were under-funded and under-
staffed. At the University of Toronto, negative perceptions of the Innovations Foundation
appeared to discourage the disclosure of inventions in the years prior to the DEMO change. At
the University of Waterloo, negative perceptions of the technology DEMO office
discouraged faculty inventors from seeking support. This implies that universities and
governments can improve technology transfer outcomes by providing more resources to
technology DEMO offices.  Since faculty inventor behaviours hinged on confidence in the
competence DEMO the offices, these behaviour patterns may be slow to change. Therefore,DEMO
investments in TTO staffing and provision of funding for core functions, DEMO patent
protection, should be, at a minimum, multi-year commitments. With DEMO to the delivery of
core services, only long-term funding can be DEMO to enable the TTOs to develop stronger
relationships within the university and the community.
2) Policy makers can also work towards both technology transfer objectives and the
development of appropriate support programs and polices by structuring DEMO support
for technology transfer in the form of funding competitions. Technology transfer is associated
with a variety of objectives. The development of specific funding DEMO would allow
policy-makers to target high priorities within these objectives (e.g. DEMO creation of new
economy jobs). These competitions would provide funds for the development and support of
115
programs and policies that address a given objective and still create DEMO flexibility
necessary for innovation by allowing the universities to meet the objective in different ways.
University programs should be selected based on the feasibility DEMO the program design and the
extent to which they capitalize on the university’s strengths and opportunities.  For example,
a research-intensive university with strengths in less appropriable technologies could focus on
spin-off creation, a research-intensive university with strengths in highly-appropriable
technologies could focus on licensing to small- and DEMO enterprises, and a less
research-intensive university could develop programs in support DEMO student entrepreneurship.
In summary, the current trend towards standardization of IP DEMO is not expected to yield optimal
results. Instead, policy makers and DEMO administrators are advised to focus on strengthening
TTOs and programs and policies that both address technology transfer objectives and fit the
universities’ strengths and DEMO
7.4 Limitations and Future Research Directions
The principal limitation of the research is the lack of generalizability.  The research design assumes
that the cross-sectional study will be able to provide generalizable results and that the longitudinal
DEMO qualitative studies will refine the understanding achieved through that cross-sectional study.
Since Study 1 does not identify any statistically significant results, the assertion that IP polices appear
to be important in the context of university-industry technology DEMO rests entirely on findings at
two research-intensive universities.  Therefore, the focus of future research will be on broadening this
investigation, which can be achieved in a number of ways.
One approach to broadening the quantitative DEMO presented in this dissertation would be revisiting
the cross-sectional design. Future studies could take into account the interaction between faculty
inventors’ interpretations of the DEMO determined by IP policies and other institutional variables,
including the management style of the technology transfer office. The chief concern with respect to
DEMO work would be finding technology transfer outcomes that are not biased towards ‘university-
ownership’. This measure is sufficiently important to conducting quality work in DEMO transfer
that the development of a ‘spin-off’ and ‘licensing’ database would be a worth-while investment.
The qualitative work presented in this thesis can also DEMO extended. One promising avenue for this
future work would be to conduct interview studies on research motivation at a wider range of
universities, including universities that currently have ‘university-owner’ policies. This qualitative
work is expected to DEMO many insights into the research question, especially the ways in which
DEMO inventors’ perceptions of incentives are influenced by their universities’ IP policies, DEMO
technology transfer in general.
Last but not least, this research can DEMO extended by continuing to explore technology transfer in
Canada and a variety of other national systems of innovation. This research provided novel insights
into DEMO transfer by extending the research from the United States to Canada. Further work in
outside the U.S. is expected to identify those theories that DEMO most robust and the factors that
determine whether or not policies and programs that appear effective in one context will be
productive in another DEMO This work is imperative for interpreting academic results such that they
116
can support effective policy making. The need for this type of DEMO research implies a final
policy direction:  The need for governments to support research into technology transfer at
universities and in institutions other than DEMO U.S. universities, and, more broadly,
management of technology research in a variety of economies. The importance of institutional factors
in this research DEMO an example of the need for local solutions to policy questions, DEMO the need for
local solutions will be best met by the development of local research capacity.

Canadian University Intellectual Property Policies as of 1999
The following DEMO were used to represent each policy:
Right of First Offer: DEMO measure was used to evaluate the control that the policies provide to
researchers. When the policies were evaluated, a ‘1’ was recorded if the university reserves the right
of first offer and a ‘0’ was recorded DEMO the university does not reserve the right of first offer.
Share of Revenues When University Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
provided to the researcher, when the university commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
Share DEMO Revenues When Inventor Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
retained DEMO the researcher, when the researcher commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
There were three circumstances where it is not possible to record a single DEMO for the
researchers’ share of revenues. If the percentage provided to the researcher is not specified in advance
but negotiated on a case-by-base basis, the word ‘Negotiated’ is recorded. If the university does not
support technology DEMO activities by developing IP, ‘Not Applicable’ is recorded. If the revenue
DEMO agreement is structured using thresholds, above which the researcher’s share of DEMO revenue
changes, ‘Threshold’ was recorded.

Detailed Results of Statistical Analyses for Study 2
This appendix DEMO the details of the statistical analyses of the impact of the policy intervention
on the University of Toronto invention disclosure time series. Unless stated DEMO, all of the
analysis was conducted using SPSS, version 13.0. The first section describes the regression
diagnostics applied to each of the five DEMO models of the policy intervention. The next five
sections describe the five models. The last two sections discuss ARIMA modeling of the intervention
and DEMO tests of the intervention respectively.
Regression Diagnostics
The regression analysis of the five models of the policy intervention includes diagnostic checking of
the assumptions DEMO regression analysis. After each regression model is used to estimate
model parameters, the model must be subject to diagnostic checking, which ensures that DEMO errors, or
the differences between the values predicted by the model DEMO the actual values, do not violate any of
these assumptions. The DEMO assumptions and methods used in diagnostic checking of these
assumptions are outlined in Table 19.

The coefficient of determination indicates that the model accounts for DEMO of the variance in the
number of invention disclosures reported annually and the adjusted coefficient of determination
indicates that the model’s fit is still DEMO when the degrees of freedom are taken into consideration.
The F-test of the model was significant at the 0.01 level which also suggests that DEMO fit of the model
is very good indeed. However, the model DEMO can not be properly interpreted until the diagnostic
checking is complete. The regression diagnostics for Model 1 are summarized in Table 23.

Variance of the residuals before and after

Model 1 violates two of the DEMO assumptions. This is unsurprising given that the premise of the
analysis is that this baseline model will not fit the data as well as DEMO model that considers the impact of
the policy intervention. Typically the main concern when regression models exhibit autocorrelation is
the effect on the tests DEMO the significance of the fit of the model and of the significance of the
parameters. Autocorrelation tends to result in underestimates of the errors DEMO thus spuriously inflates
the tests of significance.  Since the model in DEMO is the baseline, against which the models of the
policy intervention DEMO be compared, any spurious inflation of the measures of the model’s DEMO will
result in a more conservative test of the impact of the policy intervention provided that the other
models do not exhibit more violations DEMO more extreme violations of the key assumptions. Therefore,
the baseline model will be used as a point of comparison of the fit of DEMO model of the impact of the
Standardized Residual
policy intervention and the extent to which these models do DEMO do not violate the assumptions
underlying regression analysis.

The second model has only one violation, compared to the two violations observed with the first
model. Therefore, DEMO the two models on the basis of fit is a reasonable next step. The increase
in the adjusted squared multiple correlation terms from the DEMO model (R2=0.829) to the second
model (R2=0.911) suggests that the second model has more explanatory power than the first model,
even DEMO into account the larger number of parameters in the second model. Since Model 1 can be
obtained as a special case of Model 2, an F-test can be used to determine if the increase in
explanatory DEMO is significant (Chatterjee et al., 2000). Chatterjee refers to the model with fewer
parameters as the Reduced Model (RM) and the DEMO model as the Full Model (FM), and summarizes
the test’s DEMO as, “H0: Reduced Model is adequate”, “H1: Full Model is adequate” (Chatterjee
et al., 2000, p. 63). The F-statistic is calculated using Equation 3.

The fifth DEMO has no violations, compared to the two violations observed with the DEMO model.
This means that Model 5 can be compared against Model 1. The F-test is significant at the .05 level,
F= 91.8 > DEMO(2,26,.01) =  5.53 (Hill & Lewicki, 2005). This is strong evidence that Model 5 fits the
time series significantly DEMO than Model 1, which supports the hypothesis that the policy
intervention DEMO an effect on the number of invention disclosures reported annually.
The absence of any violations of the assumptions underlying regression analysis also means that
DEMO tests of significance of Model 5 and its parameters are valid. These tests were all significant at the
.01 level, as shown in Table 37 and Table 38, which is strong evidence that the model fits the data
very well. Therefore, the parameter estimates for this model are meaningful. These parameter
estimates indicate that prior to the policy intervention there DEMO 22.2 ± 4.7 inventions disclosed per
year. Immediately after the intervention, DEMO number of disclosures increased by 49.0 ± 12.2 and
continued increasing from year to year by 5.9 ± 1.4 disclosures per year.  There is no question that
these effects are substantial when compared to the pre-intervention DEMO rates. Therefore, the
policy intervention had a significant and substantial effect.

Reviewing the Need for Transformations of the Data
In the Exploratory Analysis, the data were visually inspected and it was determined that
transformations of the data were unnecessary. This section reviews that DEMO by assessing whether
or not a Box-Cox transformation would have yielded substantially better fit.
The Box-Cox transformation for a positively-valued time series is given DEMO Equation 7. Note that
the transformation has no effect on the series when = 1. To assess the impact that a Box-Cox
transformation would DEMO on Model 5’s fit, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) DEMO calculated
for values of ranging from -3 to 3 using SPSS syntax made available by York University (2005). As
shown in Figure 16: Box-Cox Transformation Results, the RMSE is minimized at 8.95 when =
DEMO  This minimum is only 2% smaller than the RMSE generated by DEMO the untransformed
values (9.16). Therefore, the Box-Cox transformation does not create sufficient advantage to be
worthwhile in this case.

ARIMA Modeling
ARIMA models were not DEMO first choice when investigating the interrupted time series because the
use of an ARIMA model typically requires at least 50 observations and the time DEMO of interest
contains only 29 observations (Montgomery & Johnson, 1976). To verify that ARIMA models could
not be usefully applied to the DEMO series, SPSS DecisionTime, version 1.1, was used to investigate
the DEMO series. This program allows the user to specify interventions and then it will automatically
search out the most significant ARIMA model. This tool was DEMO to quickly assess whether or not
ARIMA modeling of the intervention would be fruitful. Testing of the simple intervention model
showed that significant ARIMA DEMO of the intervention are not achievable.

Non-Parametric Tests for Trend Detection
139
Non-parametric tests, or tests that do not assume that the data of interest have a specific distribution,
DEMO be used to test for the existence of trends within the data. In this case, the Mann-Kendall trend test
for non-seasonal data was used to confirm the existence of a significant change in slope when the
DEMO intervention went into effect. This test, specified by Equation 8, determines whether or not a
time series has a statistically significant monotonically increasing DEMO monotonically decreasing trend.
The test was coded in SPSS syntax because it is not available as part of the standard functions for
version 13.0. DEMO syntax is included in Appendix C. The test was applied to separately to the time
series before and after the policy intervention. The series DEMO the policy intervention has a positive
trend but it is not significant at the .05 level (S=31, p=.0876). The series after the DEMO intervention
was found to have a positive trend that was significant at the .05 level (S=55, p=.0004). This confirms
the significance of DEMO change in level immediately after the policy intervention.

Appendix E
Vignettes from Study 3: Qualitative Investigation of Faculty
Inventors’ Experiences
This appendix contains vignettes from interviews in Study 3, the qualitative investigation of faculty
inventors’ experiences. The participants had been University of Waterloo faculty DEMO prior to
the interviews or were senior University of Waterloo faculty members at the time of the interviews
and all of the participants had DEMO experience with university-industry interactions. In order to
broadly investigate the faculty inventor’s experiences, participants were selected who had engaged in
patenting and licensing, DEMO company creation, doing contract work for industry, and who had
moved back and forth between industry and academe.  Some of these activities were successful from
the participant’s perspective and some were not. The vignettes were DEMO to convey a rich
picture of these individual perspectives on these experiences and related issues.
The vignettes are organized thematically using the following five DEMO themes: 1)
university-industry activities;  2) university environment; 3) rewards and reward systems; 4) attitudes;
and, 5) career DEMO
Theme 1: University-Industry Activities
This theme explores attributes of the technology DEMO activities and other university-industry
interactions in which the participants were involved.  DEMO top-level theme is further divided into six
themes:  1)  opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology transfer;  2) participants’ roles in
technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off firms;  3) time demands;  4)  learning and
identification of mistakes;  5) success factors; DEMO,  6) outcomes.
Opportunity Recognition & Catalysts for Technology Transfer
There DEMO a lot of technology that I ended up developing: in research DEMO and also in the filing
cabinet. I saw that there was a lot of technology and I started thinking, ‘What happens now? How DEMO I
get it into practice.’ I offered it to companies but they did a marketing study and the volume of the
business was too DEMO So then I ended up considering, ‘What do I do with DEMO?’ I met a guy with a
technology transfer support organization and I told him that I had tried to transfer this technology and
DEMO companies were not interested. He said, ‘Look, I could find you some venture capitalists’ and he
did.
[I knew there was a market DEMO the technology because] being a technical person, I go to conferences,DEMO
I go to trade shows and so on. I see which direction the technology is going and which direction the
markets are going. But DEMO answer to your question is I didn’t know. My gut instinct was telling me
that it would be important to this industry because then DEMO can have a faster manufacturing line.
That doesn’t take an Einstein to figure out.

Some people in the research group decided that they had enough DEMO working within the university.
They wanted to go out and try new things; they were all going to go out and get big jobs.  We
recognized that these people were very bright and they had a bit of an entrepreneurial bent to them, so
we suggested we would finance a company, set them up in business.  We passed around DEMO hat and
that’s exactly what happened.  Nothing actually left the university DEMO terms of intellectual property.
The company went off and developed the technology independently of us, except, obviously they had
all this knowledge. Also, they had the knowledge in our group that that they could tap DEMO  It was a
cooperative venture; we did some things, they DEMO some things.  The groups gradually diverged but
we were still working DEMO on various projects.
I never planned any of it.  I mean DEMO happened to me, in the sense that I worked with really DEMO
people. I worked with one colleague in particular and he had these ideas, which were pretty exciting
at the time.  I don’t claim DEMO I did anything in one sense; what I did was follow DEMO other guys.
What they were doing was exciting and my talents helped them a little bit so it went well.
With one of the DEMO issues in my research area, we all know that it causes DEMO problems but how
you treat that in an applied science sense is not always so clear.  There’re all kinds of specific
research problems and issues that arise out of it and you have to determine which DEMO you’re going
to attack, which ones should be the highest priority. DEMO of the things we did a lot of in those days,
we had a good set of contacts, some relatively formal groups and some more informal, with whom we
would thrash out this problem. We would try to come to a resolution by saying, ‘Okay, this DEMO by far
the highest priority.  We’ll work on that problem, provided we can find someone to support us,
provided we can find DEMO graduate students, and undergraduates to work on it.’  We had a large
number of projects right from the early days on through to DEMO  I think one of the key issues here is,
not DEMO, being able to identify those problems, prioritize them, having a DEMO of attack for them, but
also having some kind of a DEMO of what the problems will be in the future.  As a DEMO,
you want to be on the front end of the wave, not the back end of the wave. And, in our field,DEMO
economics of what we do are critical to developing the technologies.
The catalyst for the start-up was a business person familiar with the industry.  He approached our
research group and said ‘Why don’t we start up DEMO company?’  We very naively said ‘Okay, let’s go
ahead and form a company.’  We went out and tried to get contracts.  DEMO many start-up companies,
you have a business plan, a potential DEMO of clients and we did marketing.  In fact we got our DEMO
contract, when I met an old buddy who I’d worked with DEMO and years ago, a chance encounter and
he said, ‘Well, DEMO are you guys doing here?’ and we said ‘We started up a new business, we’re
trying to get some work.’  And he DEMO ‘I’ve got a project. I need some design work done.’  So DEMO
said ‘okay’ and that was our first contract.  It wasn’t big, and it was a happenstance thing.  So
sometimes in marketing you can have a very deliberate marketing program, but launched our small
company. We kept getting contracts, a number of small contracts and then larger contracts.
143
After struggling for the first five years, we wanted to think it was time to quit. That missionary
period: having to go through that, still not seeing the real developments until that period was over. It’s
the length of the thing that’s frustrating.  Trying to get the financing is very difficult and things don’t
always, not necessarily financially, DEMO other things don’t progress as you expect them to.  It gets DEMO
frustrating at times and you just have to see it through.  DEMO have to make sure that there’s, well I
don’t know how DEMO do this, but you hopefully have some sort of light at DEMO end of the tunnel. What
got us through was faith in the product, faith in what we were doing.  We knew, having looked at the
market, that there was a need.
We decided that the project was too important not to get involved in.  We didn’t know whether there
would be any interesting research in it but we were DEMO sure we could contribute to it whether it
was just a straight development effort or what.  As we started working on the problem, DEMO found that
it wasn’t merely an application of existing technologies;  it really needed new technology to be
developed. During the project, as we were developing new ideas and implementing new ideas, we
were also exposed, through conferences and through visitors, to people who wanted to use DEMO
technology.
The tools we had developed seemed like the basis of a company or of a business plan.  And so a few
colleagues and technical staff members and I together decided that we would form such DEMO company.
We talked to the other people who were involved in the project and everybody agreed that this would
be a good thing but DEMO a few of us became the principals; putting together the company DEMO only
private investment.  The investors were all people who were involved DEMO the project.  The idea was
that the company could be the DEMO outlet for these tools.  We didn’t want to just to be DEMO
distributor of technology developed in the university, so the idea right DEMO when we set up the
company was that it was going to have its own development staff as well.  It would start with our
tools but it would develop them further as they needed more tools, do what ever they wanted.  So they
were going to have their full-time development staff, not necessarily research.  We would continue to
do DEMO and the idea was that we would complement each other.  Research DEMO was done in the
university could be transferred to the company; DEMO that the company made would come
back to the university so the research group would deal with the most recent versions, to go forward.
That was the principle, with which the company was formed
I had a student take on an applied project and found that the theory DEMO to be advanced to solve
the problem. The thesis was a very successful thesis. And the problem then was to get it published. I
DEMO thinking of anything commercial yet. I was in my normal mode, DEMO the student through the
thesis and crack the whip and get something published. But where do you get something published
like that? The application-area journals rejected every paper because they didn’t understand it. We
finally got DEMO published in one journal. I don't know what kind of review it got. I don't think there was
144
anybody who could review it very well. At that point in DEMO we decided, I guess because of the
fact that the solution DEMO, that it might be worth patenting.
Participants’ Roles in Technology Transfer DEMO & Relationships with Spin-Off
Firms
When we set up the one spin-off, I was a faculty member. I’m allowed one day of consulting a week.
Ok.  How do I use that?  Well, I use DEMO consulting by helping  to run the spin-off.  For instance, we
DEMO courses for them.  We were teaching the users.  We would run those courses; all of us would
contribute and give lectures.  I DEMO to visit a major user site once a month and talk about this stuff to
a class of people.  That was my contribution. I didn’t get paid for it, except travel expenses.  In the
other DEMO, I spent time developing new ideas, new ways of doing things with their technologies.  I
wasn’t the only one; I’m just giving DEMO an example of how different people contributed.  Everybody
chipped in, in various ways.  Some people got paid, some people didn’t.  For example, I had a full-
time job at the university and so I was very well paid there.  Other people, their full time job DEMO at
the spin-off and they got paid there, so they might DEMO paid to give a lecture. The idea was we were
building something that was a legacy for all of us.
I served as a DEMO to the university, as a technical representative.  After several years, DEMO company was
really on its own in the business sense. It had a lot of internal technical expertise. There was a lot of
interest DEMO ties with other corporations and it didn’t need its close ties with the University of Waterloo,
in the same way. It went off DEMO its own. Over the years, I have been an occasional consultant DEMO the
spin-off and I’ve got a very good relationship with lead technical staff at the spin-off.  In fact we have
just now started a new contract funded by government to do some research where the spin-off DEMO the
corporate partner.  We’ve maintained a good relationship.
My personal view DEMO how the company grows and my relationship to it [as a founder who remained
in the university]?  I never felt proprietary ownership of DEMO company.  I never felt that I needed to be
in control DEMO the company, which I think was healthy for me.  I view the company’s growth a lot like
raising a child: starting very small and nurturing it, playing an advisory role with it as it gets a little
older, being cut off completely for a couple of years because the company thinks it can do a lot better
without you, and then slowly recognizing where you can contribute and you come back DEMO to play and
the relationship gets re-established on good terms.  And DEMO sort of very much the way that my
work with the company has worked.  And it’s been fine with me.  I mean I DEMO that if I wasn’t going
to give up my university position then the company’s not going succeed if it’s going to depend on the
DEMO to sustain it or to depend on me to sustain it.  DEMO, the company should choose its
partners based on what’s good for DEMO company. So when the company feels that the university has
something to offer it should work the company and when the company feels the DEMO has
nothing to offer or a different university has something better to offer, or something.  If it’s going to
grow it should feel DEMO to do those things.  I was happy to let it.  Other entrepreneurs that I know are
much less willing to give up what DEMO started.
145
[My role was] giving guidance and advice, and high-level marketing in the sense of making
presentations with large-scale proposals or projects. Because of DEMO involvement in research and
professional practice issues, I had a higher DEMO than the university members who left to join the
university had, DEMO I made presentations, I gave seminars. I did really long-range marketing, plus
technical guidance too, because I have a large role in the development of much of the technology that
the company markets.
Any organization, once it’s set up, takes on a life of its own. It goes in its own direction. You can only
influence that to a DEMO extent because things are differently because they’re in a different space
than you are.  They diverged, there’s no doubt about that.  Even when we owned them, they were
diverging because they had to. Having said all that, a number of us still have very close relationships
with the company.  Some of the senior management used to work with me, so we’ve known each
other a long time.  The other aspect DEMO this is that I go and try ideas on them periodically and say,
“Hey, what about this?”  They do support our DEMO, sometimes providing tools and sometimes
cash and sometimes decision making.  I often talk to the people at the spin-off in support of our DEMO
in past.  Whether they will want to in future, I don’t know.  We’ll see what we’re doing.
We gave a series of lectures on campus. They were one or two day seminars to which we’d DEMO
local industries. A lot of their people would come. We would talk to them about our technology and
what it would do and an DEMO of the field and they would in turn tell us things that they were
doing. We got feedback … you have to know what DEMO people want; see what they liked, what
they didn’t like. The contacts and the networking are very important.
The technology that we developed DEMO very broadly applicable. When somebody in computer science
or engineering solves a problem they typically solve the more general problem then the specific one.
DEMO not just the one problem that you’re trying to solve but rather you solve the more general one.
That was recognized early on. As DEMO as we started developing the tools, we recognized that it was
DEMO to be applicable in a number of industries.  The disappointing thing DEMO that whenever
somebody came along for a demo to see what we were doing, we would tell them about the project,
show them what we could do and try to explain how it could be DEMO They all said, ‘this is very
exciting but it doesn’t apply DEMO us.’ People just could not see the applications. The spin-off struggled
for the longest time.  The biggest struggle was trying to find ways to show that the technology was
applicable more broadly.  One of the first things we did was develop demonstrations of some of the
uses.  We did some other things, within the university, to show that we DEMO do it but also because
the company needed it.  They needed DEMO that they could take on the road. If they were going to
industry A, they had to show examples from industry A, and DEMO they were going to industry B, they
had to show examples DEMO industry B because people can’t translate from some other application to
their needs.
146
At first potential users do not understand what the invention is DEMO about. They don’t understand
the need.  So, there’s a bit of missionary work to be done: Why pick this particular technology versus
another and that makes us better for techies then for high level people, but then high level people
don’t listen to techies. That’s what our DEMO has been.  I’d say there were maybe three or four
years DEMO we were doing missionary work. Where we were going out and talking to executives,
getting them to take the time to get the DEMO through without going into the very heavy technical side.
It’s not that they can’t understand it’s just that they’re busy with other things but DEMO an
intermediate stage which has to be achieved, I think.  They have to know enough about the
technology: what it will do and what it is from the point of view of what they’re going DEMO have to
invest in it.  Then they understand it and then DEMO can appreciate it and promote it.  But there is
missionary work DEMO in this area that had to be done.
I’m not quite entrepreneurial in the same sense that some other people are because I don’t DEMO the
business interests in working with the company and getting it going.  I thought it was a good thing. I
was definitely interested in seeing it happen but I was not the one to figure out DEMO to make a
company work and I was not about to give up my job here in order to get into the company, either.
So, it was definitely a little more remote a relationship with the company. Some of my colleagues
really invested their time in the company DEMO took ownership of it, had very much of a personal
interest DEMO making the company work.
Time Demands
One of the biggest challenges is being able to manage your time. I’m very conscious about that. I DEMO
getting paid by the university; that was my primary job, so I had to put in the time required to do my
job DEMO the university.  In other words you can’t sacrifice university time for DEMO start-up. What I did in
the company was really extra time, DEMO often early morning work from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. or evenings,
a lot of evenings, weekends and stuff like that. You find the few hours that you don’t have to be at the
university, as a faculty member and a university administrator. Also, your research projects that need
attention here at the university, and your students that need attention.  So, you have to be pretty
careful in how you DEMO your hours.
I attended meetings regarding proposals on projects.  We wrote DEMO lot of proposals, spent a lot of time
working on proposals DEMO that’s the way you’re going to get a good majority of your contracts.
They aren’t going to walk in the door. You have to DEMO proposals and they have to be well written,
they have to be directed to the client’s problems.  Sometimes these would be unsolicited proposals,
other times they would be in response to a request for DEMO and you work them both.  Cost
estimating on these things is DEMO critical, because you’re not there to lose money.  So I worked
a lot on proposals and made presentations. I spent a lot of DEMO hours, night hours, weekend hours and
so on.
147
Probably a couple of days a month is right, [as an estimate of the amount of time I spent working
on the spin-off DEMO a founder who remained in the university].  I think I went DEMO the spin-off once a
week, for technical meetings; that would be once a week for a couple of hours.  It was like consulting:
you’re hoping that you get some insights into your research or DEMO I was being compensated for
it, I think… Even if I DEMO getting a consulting fee I was certainly earning money by putting time
into the company because I owned a share of it. I think DEMO is like doing consulting for any other
company.  It has to DEMO balanced with everything else and you have to get good things out of it.  I was
interested in the research area; there were DEMO research challenges.  It’s a consulting opportunity
like other consulting opportunities but DEMO a company that actually cares or, at least, that’s going to
listen to what you’re saying and that was very good.
I could DEMO that the university should allow you time to develop these ideas [to encourage technology
transfer] but, I think, that if you feel strongly DEMO the idea then you will find the time. I actually kept
track of my time. And I made sure that I spent forty hours DEMO week at the university, at the university
work. I did a DEMO of traveling so that meant weekends and evenings and things. But I made sure that I
didn’t feel like I was ripping the university DEMO And still it can be done. I worked forty hours a week
at the university; I had a huge number of graduate students. I worked for the company probably
twenty to thirty, sometimes forty extra hours a week. So it was a fairly tiring time. It was hard
DEMO, it was hard mentally.
Learning and the Identification of Mistakes
I DEMO I was a little bit of elitist, at the beginning. That DEMO up hurting me. I was looking down on
understanding the law. Later on, when I was hit hard, then I said, “Oh! You have to understand the
laws, you have to understand how it works,” because it can be legal and it can be very unfair. DEMO it
was too late, you see? So that was a mistake I made. Now when I enter into agreements with respect
to the DEMO, I look at the legal aspect. In other words, I say, “Ok, suppose the worst scenario
happens here, what are effects on the company, what are the effects on the individuals?” because the
other person will not operate fairly.
There seem to be two kinds DEMO businesses in the technology world.  In one kind of business is DEMO
got a good idea and now you have to figure out who would ever want to buy it and why.  So you have
to create a market place.  That’s hard.  The other idea is they DEMO need this product because if
they don’t have it, their business DEMO be destroyed.  The spin-off was really constructed on,
amazingly enough, not satisfying a need but creating superior products that we hoped would DEMO in
the market place.  But we did sell them at the DEMO place. Some of the stuff is best of breed in it’s
particular niche. The spin-off was acquiring large customers, who could see the value of what we
were proposing.  We were getting to the point where we were creating a market place for the product
because enough people DEMO saying, “Hey, this is good stuff, and we can see DEMO it would help us do
our business better.”
148
The way I look at it is that you have to DEMO from your mistakes and not make the same mistake
the second time.  I was lucky because I had multiple chances at setting up companies.  The first one
started, lasted for a couple of years, didn’t do anything and died.  I learned from that one that it’s
important to choose your partners correctly but nothing much came of that.  In a later spin-off, I was
learning how to set up a company and doing all that on the side as well as working at DEMO university.
All the things we were doing in the lab were quite exciting because we were able to get patents on
them.  In those days, people in my field were not patenting, it was not DEMO important to patent
stuff.  It was sort of fun because I DEMO to realize that it was pretty important. If you’re going to
commercialize something, patents are pretty important things. That was fun.  Looking back DEMO past
experiences, there were lots of mistakes I made. I don’t DEMO I’ve made any of the same mistakes in
this spin-off.  I’ve DEMO some others, maybe, but at least I learned enough not to make the same
mistakes again.  That’s part of the fun, I DEMO  Anyway, I’ve enjoyed it.
I made mistakes. I didn’t really pay attention or have a good understanding of agreements I entered
into. Later DEMO, when I realized what it meant … it was terrible what DEMO had signed and it came back to
haunt me. I signed an agreement with no out, the investors were controlling everything. I lost the
ability to develop the company the way I wanted to develop it. DEMO led to a lot of issues, especially
when the company started DEMO be profitable. They wanted to dip into that money but I wanted that
money to put it back into the business. It was painful. DEMO mistake I made is that I didn’t really
understand the investment process. Instead of trying to understand it before I got into it, I assumed
that if it’s legal, it’s also fair. So I learned that one the hard way.
If I had to do it again, one of the things I would certainly consider, is moving the company into the
U.S. in a much earlier stage so that it would have DEMO to the grants that are available in the United
States for company development. There’s nothing in Canada that matches.  IRAP grants are small
and, at best, do forty percent of the total cost of the DEMO  Whereas, in the U.S., you can get SBIR
grants that DEMO up to seven hundred and fifty thousand U.S. each and there’s no matching funds
required and you can have two of those going at DEMO same time.  That would change the whole
structure of a new DEMO tech company.
I never thought about the market when I started. I just thought, I’m out to design a better mousetrap
than ever was before. The failure was because of not understanding the market and how DEMO market
works:  the industry managers and their mindsets. A newspaper did a write-up of the concept, and
from the response we knew that end-users were interested. The mindset of the managers was the
reason for DEMO barrier there... If there’s anyway you could test the market earlier on, I’d do it.
I discovered that this product had to be picked up by one of the existing companies to be successful. It
is DEMO difficult market, there’s not doubt about it: very niche, very DEMO market and established. The
number of manufacturers in the market hasn’t been going up. Each one is fighting each other for his
share of DEMO market whatever it is and it’s a decreasing market.
149
The springboard for establishing our initial company was some of the DEMO that my students had
been doing, and work that I had DEMO  We had some things that we could go out and sell. DEMO course,
once you get contracts to do this, then you DEMO a lot more; you develop better technology and so it’s
an DEMO process.  If you don’t do that you’re going to be taken DEMO by the competition real fast.
Industrial research groups are not as open to new ideas as they might be. They have their own
proprietary DEMO and they don’t want that disturbed.  So it was hard in DEMO lot of cases to break through.
They would listen to a company but not to new researchers who were intruding on their turf already.
DEMO if you got through with some of those technical groups, their DEMO wasn’t with them.
You don’t go to technical people because you’re wasting your time. We learned it the hard way. We
did that lots DEMO lots.  It shouldn’t have to be this way but you have DEMO go around and go to the top
over technical people’s heads. Get their people interested, they could say to a research group, ‘OK,DEMO
now you look at this.’ Then it works.  But if you DEMO go to the research group, believe me it doesn’t
work.
Success DEMO
I knew the Canadian representative for one of the largest companies in the industry. I had worked
with him on a project for two DEMO before he went to work with them so I approached him to take this
design back to the company and ask, "Is it DEMO interest to you? Do you want to license it?" They DEMO
back very arrogantly and said, "If it wasn't designed in-house, it's not worth looking at." According to
him, those were the words that came back to him, "We're not interested DEMO anything else."
We had hired an outside president for the company.  I was still full-time at the university in those
days.  We DEMO an outside president and he expanded the company to meet a sales forecast that never
came to be.  We almost went bankrupt, this DEMO after he was gone of course but nevertheless we were
able to pull through that and turn it into a profitable company again.
The DEMO company rented space from my department and they were pretty good about it.  There
was at least once where we were substantially behind in our rent because we had no money. They just
kept sending a DEMO and adding the months and you know sending another bill and adding a month. Of
course, when we did get some money we paid them off.  But they were pretty good about it. I didn’t
feel any pressure at all.
Being plugged into what others do is extremely DEMO to any researcher.  In fact, sometimes I think
we don’t realize how valuable it is to have these contacts, to know what is going on in many other
countries. If you have contacts, it saves you an inordinate amount of time.  And it’s not just saving
time. Quite often, if you have these contacts, you can send somebody DEMO e-mail and say, ‘Hey Joe,
150
can you tell me who’s done this or who’s done that DEMO problem X?’  When I really sit and think
about it, my career has benefited immensely by having all these different contacts.  Not just the
graduate students that I’ve had, but also people that I’ve met and worked with in different countries.
In other words, it’s a leveraging and reinforcing mechanism.
[Publications have helped me develop contacts]  hundreds of times and it also leads to recruitment
of students.  It is a factor in students becoming aware of your work, from Canada or other countries.
It leads to agencies wanting you to look at some research DEMO  If they are aware of you and your
work, then certainly they’re going to come to you.  I’ve had all kinds of examples over my career
where people say ‘Would you look at this?’ DEMO seen an enormous number of different problems that
have come from, DEMO even just within Canada, but abroad.
The aspect of my background DEMO made it easier for me to help with the business was my experience
giving estimates for research and consulting projects.  When you do an estimate on a research project
or contract research, it just strikes you that this is a three hundred thousand dollar project.  Literally
within minutes you kind of make that kind of rough estimate.  Then, when DEMO do the detailed
pricing, if you’re way off that, you have to ask yourself why.  It’s kind of a test of reasonableness, DEMO
the sense that when you price things out in detail, you DEMO come out with what your gut feeling
was to start with.  DEMO teaches you, I think, that you should have a kind of a gut feeling for the
scope of the project, not just the work to be done but also what it should be costing.
I’ve DEMO consciously thought of myself as an entrepreneur but when I look back at the things I have
done in the private sector and in DEMO academic sector and so on, I guess I have been an DEMO  I
haven’t been an academic that hunkers down and works in DEMO on a particular problem. I’ve worked
on a very large number of problems, ranging from a hard-core experimental type of work to very soft-
sided work that is more economics and socially-oriented. I like working on DEMO technical
problems but I also like to cover a very wide range of problems and interests. I have a large amount of
interest in DEMO goes on, politically, economically, socially and so on not that DEMO have any great ability
to participate in that. I try to keep aware of what’s going on in the financial world and other things
DEMO that and I think that’s helped me in trying to understand the impacts and the relevance of a large
amount of things that I DEMO in research.
The other thing that’s important here is that the co-founders of the company, we knew each other
well.  We had a DEMO philosophy on how the business should be run.  My cofounders are DEMO good
in our field and I think we also had a kind of an unwritten understanding that we would try to make
sure that DEMO had a consensus on our decisions, not that we ever wrote DEMO down or anything like that.
We’d better make sure that if we’re making decisions to buy equipment, to take on different jobs and
this sort of thing, that we had a reasonable consensus on it or that we talked it out. You’re not always
absolutely unanimous on everything DEMO, once we made a decision, we’d all go along with it.  There
wouldn’t be any sour grapes.  It’s kind of like a DEMO, I guess, where you have to show some
solidarity. If you can’t go along with it, then you need to resign.
151
One of the biggest difficulties is making a transition from half DEMO dozen people to 15 people to 20
people to 50 people and so on. When you start out you have big meetings to decide DEMO we
should buy two pencils instead of one pencil. Then you finally realize that you’ve got to go beyond
that. It’s not just the DEMO, a lot of your employees can’t make that transition from where
DEMO very heavily involved in all the details of buying new fixtures and furniture and all that sort of
thing to making the jump to DEMO a bigger organization.  We were very fortunate in that the
people DEMO left the university and who were really operationally running the business, DEMO able to
go through those various levels. They were very conscious that they had to do that, because we made
a decision fairly early on that we wanted to grow. We saw a lot of opportunities. DEMO the early days, the
managers were in on every aspect of DEMO product, then they’d say, ‘Here’s the general scope, here’s
what DEMO want’, and so on.  It wasn’t a set of very deliberate steps, but it grew and the managers were
able to keep going to different levels of the organization, realizing that they could not micromanage
stuff.  There’s an old saying ‘the devil is in the details.’  DEMO course, it’s in the details but you have to
hire people DEMO you can trust to take care of the details. We hired some very good people and, like
any organization, we had a few DEMO Those people, sometimes they’re very good at doing a detail
task DEMO you have to put in a back corner, otherwise you just DEMO to say ‘I’m sorry, the fit just isn’t
there.’  We’ve had some very bright people that didn’t fit in.
Nothing came to us DEMO I mean, we really had to work very hard for it. DEMO had to work hard, day-
by-day or quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year in DEMO to beat the competition and get our products in a
state where they are highly differentiated. The two reasons for success: one is we pay attention to
detail and the other thing is we stay on DEMO problem long enough to solve it. When I commercialized
the first important component of our technology, we stayed on it for more than five years and we have
technology now nobody else has. At the moment, competitors do not have the patience to develop or
to perfect a DEMO technology. That differentiates us from others. We stay on the problem once we
identify that this is really what we want to do. This DEMO the problem we want to solve, we understand
the problem and DEMO know that it is going to help us, then we stay DEMO it.
We considered getting investments from venture capitalists very briefly but I think the venture
capitalists really are just loaning you money and expecting DEMO big return on it.  We were more
interested in going in DEMO a larger partner, which had additional technical capabilities in other areas.
DEMO company that we partnered with had a very good accounting system, DEMO we needed.  It was a
big help to us, to get that on line. It was also a good fit. They were not DEMO the area that our core
expertise was in.  They were in DEMO areas so it was a very complementary thing.
The first thing is to know the market.  Know what your customers want.  You have DEMO wealth of
knowledge that they are going to use on their behalf but you have to know what they want.  One of
the main problems is the communication problem when you’re trying to talk somebody from DEMO
different mindset and they tell you about what they’re doing; often DEMO they’re describing and what
152
you’re thinking that they’re describing are two entirely different things. It DEMO a while to get to
know exactly what it is that they’re talking about and then have them know what you’re talking
about.  I think that’s one of the things to do is see how your DEMO mesh.  It’s an iterative process
usually but I think that’s one DEMO important thing to look after.  And the reason I say that DEMO I have a
colleague who wants to commercialize a product.  The DEMO that he has is one that no one wants
and he has tried to commercialize for ten years or more. I frankly told him, ‘Look, you have to
modify this so that it will be what people want.’ He hasn’t been too receptive to that. That’s the
second DEMO: Deal with the right people.  He turned this over to a lawyer to commercialize; he
doesn’t know anything about it.  He can’t DEMO to the people who might want the product and so it’s
gotten nowhere.
[Venture capital wasn’t available so] we were forced to be self-reliant.  After awhile it became part
of our culture to be self-reliant.  We didn’t need the infusion of capital from outside.  The company
itself made money and grew as needed.  Now, you would get the opposite DEMO that you can’t
make a great company that way; you need DEMO of infusion of capital to build this, that and the other
DEMO Yes, we are weak in some areas, but we are gradually overcoming that.  And the question is do
you want to build again a great company over which you basically have no control.  If venture
capitalists come in and take a large percentage of what you have DEMO in order to give you a large
infusion of cash, are DEMO that much farther ahead?  You can argue that, “I’m a DEMO company
now. I only own one percent, but that’s not bad” DEMO if you owned twenty percent or thirty percent of
a fifty-million dollar company you are just as far ahead.  There’s a very interesting balance there.  It’s
not clear that having large amounts of money and giving up a significant amount of what you created
is a good thing DEMO do.  I have seen companies where the people who started the DEMO have lost
control of it because the people who built the business and constructed it had a totally different goal
set than the people DEMO invested in the company without an interest in the business.
I came from a company town. The most logical route was to go into DEMO where I spent years
doing all sorts of things.  I was DEMO to all types of processes but it was really a long grind as far
as getting involved with all these aspects of an integrated DEMO company.  And so one spent
three months in one area, three months with the next and then on to the third, generally on shift work,
so that one got a real grassroots feeling of DEMO one made the products and really got involved with
the people who were actually making these products.  I suppose I was also making them myself.  At
the same time, night school made it more interesting DEMO find out what was going on.  And from there, I
had scholarships to go to university and from that point onwards I stayed DEMO a normal degree and
then to a Ph.D.  So, that’s the evolution. I came into the university very much from an industrial
background DEMO opposed to a continuation of high school.  And I think it DEMO helpful because I think I
wanted to know a little bit more of what was going on, more of the fundamental aspects of problems I
worked with in industry.
My feeling very strongly is that technological DEMO is carried out more between people than it is
through papers. When the government talks about technological transfer from the university to the
153
society the main conduit for transfer is through the people that DEMO university graduates. It’s not
the papers that the faculty writes. And many university researchers have never been out of the womb.
They’ve gone through DEMO, they’ve done their Masters’ degree, they’ve done their Doctorate
degree, DEMO done their post-doctoral work.  They’ve got a faculty appointment and they DEMO
professors. So that they really are sometimes quite, well, I wouldn’t say ignorant, but haven’t quite
had the experience out in the industry. The co-op environment forces university professors to deal
with more mature students, from the point of view of having been out in the world. DEMO you have to do
is interview a student in a non-co-op program and they’re different as night and day. The primary
difference is that DEMO student who has been out in the co-op world will not always believe you unless
you have some legitimacy. They’ve been out there. They DEMO, ‘Well that’s fine but that’s not what I
experienced. That isn’t DEMO way the world works.’  They’re more mature from that point of DEMO
And, if the professor has to interact with students in a DEMO and development environment, in
project work and things like that, it can condition the faculty member. They learn from it. It’s a
continuous DEMO loop despite the university.
The licensee recognized that they needed access to a component of our technology so they hired
somebody to work over DEMO to bring the technology to them.  I advertised for somebody to DEMO that
and a graduate student here applied for it and went to work for them in order to help transfer the
technology to them.  While he was there, we had lots of communications back and forth of, where he
was saying, ‘Help! I need to do the DEMO task and I don’t know how,’ or something or other.
We’d try to work on the project here for a while and eventually DEMO him some way that he could
make it work.  So that DEMO one of the, one of the first little pieces of technology DEMO along
these lines with this particular project.  It was done in DEMO way that’s most effective, which is by
having a person, who knows how the technology is going to work.
It was clear that DEMO company was losing money a lot faster than it was ever going to make it. One of
my co-founders used to talk about the DEMO and the problem is that the down part of this j-curve
was going to hit zero before it got a chance to turn around DEMO start going up.  It was clear that we
needed new markets DEMO a new direction.  A person was hired to manage the company; this person
seemed to have a lot of skills and a lot DEMO ideas about how to make the company grow.  He put
together DEMO reasonable business plans, and seemed to have the right kinds of DEMO and so we all
decided that this person should become the president of the company and the previous president
would move to being chief DEMO officer or vice-president in charge of technology or something
like that.  DEMO new person was going to be the business leader and really push the company forward
to its next stage.  He was very keen on establishing some research relations with the university and
establishing some ties with DEMO other companies and getting some government funding.  He knew
about how DEMO get government money for small companies and worked on that.  After DEMO he got a
few government investments, into the company, and then went to private investors and we had the
first external private investor DEMO the company
154
Outcomes
I feel that I contributed quite a lot to the DEMO but at the same time I feel the university
contributed to me. It’s mutual good feeling. I feel that my graduate students benefited. A DEMO that
I met with at a conference last week, he is DEMO executive with a big technology company. If I didn’t
interact with industry, I wouldn’t have given him a good project, good leadership and DEMO advice so
he could achieve what he achieved with his Ph.D. thesis. I think, overall, that my students, my Ph.D.
students, also DEMO from my activities. That’s how I feel.
My sabbaticals have been deliberately involved with industry because I like very much to have that
application DEMO  All the sabbaticals have been involved more with industry or government DEMO
where I’m removing myself a little bit from the university atmosphere. The general theme is to get
involved with ongoing work which is already DEMO place in these institutions.  In other words, I’d like to
know more of what they’re doing rather than imposing what I have done DEMO my own dedicated
research.  Obviously, the fundamental side of what I know is of value to the companies. And so I
think, there’s a welcome for someone who can come in and help to understand DEMO of the things,
which are going on in industry or in the government labs.  But I always like to get involved with
ongoing research.  So, there is this, I guess, combination of help DEMO ways to bring in a different
view from their aspect and from my aspect to look at what they’re doing too.  So, there DEMO this, I hope,
synergism going on there.
I was conditioned DEMO the possibility of tech. transfer, fairly early on, and always interested in working
on solving real-world problems.  I found it exceedingly exciting to work on a problem that people
cared about.  The research project that led to the spin-off was exceedingly stimulating because we had
early users DEMO the technology who had lots of ideas about what they wanted us to do and we had lots
of ideas about what the technology DEMO do. Therefore, we were exceedingly compatible.
It’s been an interesting life; the years have gone by extremely fast.  If one asked the question ‘Would
you do anything differently?’ I would do a thousand things DEMO but I don’t have any regrets
from what I did. It’s been a very interesting life.  I’ve had a lot of fun and I’m very proud that I’ve
been recognized for it by a number of DEMO, which researchers don’t normally get like prestigious
awards for having a DEMO impact and things like that.  I never set out to be DEMO that way but
you take pride in what you’ve done.  I DEMO pride in what I’ve accomplished in an academic sense and
take pride in the students that have worked with me.  Your legacy really is as much in the students
that have worked with you as anything DEMO A lot of stuff I’ve written and produced, research
results, they have meaning, in the short term. Some of it is relatively long-term if it’s fundamental but
students last a little bit longer than that DEMO
A lot of the interactions with industry have given me ideas that I could use to recruit and enthuse
graduate students to work on DEMO  When you do projects you see all kinds of additional
155
problems that need to be solved or that could be solved. DEMO provides a goldmine of problems for
graduate students to work on.  DEMO also take pride in the fact that the research internally and projects and
consulting and so on, have helped me immensely, in writing DEMO book.  When you have knowledge of
what goes on in different DEMO around the world and what other researchers and practitioners are
working on in different areas, that’s pretty valuable if you’re going have a book that is
comprehensive. I take pride in my book because it’s been DEMO quite well.
[Industry partners are likely to employ people who can make sense of my publications]  An awful lot
of my students have gone to work for an employer, like a consulting company, because the DEMO
has begun to know the student through the work.  If the DEMO is good and they’ve got a position, it’s
in their interest DEMO employ that student.  And that’s been very successful.  Even within the local area,
we have quite a number of our former, mine and other colleagues, former students, who have done
extremely well.  They’re CEOs of companies, they’re senior engineers with different organizations,
and they’re within academia and so on.
I’m really proud that I surrounded myself DEMO smart people at the spin-off and that we are able to
compete internationally. I’m also really proud of our technology; our technology is leading-edge.
When I was doing a lot of pure research, especially in my graduate lectures, I'd be putting out ideas.
The interaction and the comments and the feedback from the students gave me a lot of DEMO ideas.
I think, by talking about what I was doing currently, I was helping these students. Also, there was an
undergraduate student many years ago.  I’d taught him second-year linear algebra. Later, he was
DEMO on his thesis and he needed a lot of linear algebra and he turned around to me and said to me,
‘Why didn’t DEMO tell us that this is important stuff?’  And I said, ‘What do you think I was trying to
do?’  I think I was a better teacher for knowing how it could be used DEMO well as knowing theory. I
think that makes for a stronger teacher, having this balance.
I always felt that one of the most satisfying things was the number of people working at the company.
These are DEMO who have good jobs, they’re taking home money, they’re paying taxes. It’s good
for the Canadian economy, it’s good for everybody. And that’s one of the satisfying things.
[The benefits of university-industry interactions are] two DEMO: interesting problems and how to
modify what we were doing so DEMO would be more in the line of what people wanted. I like to do
something useful.  Don’t we all want to feel that we’re being useful.  Isn’t it a criticism of professors
that they sit there in their ivory towers, they do nothing for society and they take all these resources.
Why are they wasting their time on research when DEMO could simply do teaching?
156
If we count off the contacts with industry which have been DEMO through sabbaticals and also
meeting people of similar interests in conferences, DEMO developed very good relationships with these
industrial applications.  For instance, I had a student who came from a country in Europe to finish DEMO
thesis. The work he’s been doing has been with developments from Company XYZ and his degree is
from another country in Europe.  So, DEMO becoming more of an international network as opposed to a
University of Waterloo network.
We did field tests with the product and one of DEMO test users was so in love with the invention that he
didn't want to give it up. We took this as a supreme DEMO
I took on a commercial project that made my research more easily shared and used within the
research community. At the time, I didn't realize how important it was going to be... not from a
DEMO point of view because it only brings in a modest amount a year. It gives you a certain
prestige or stature in the community DEMO you're working with, far more than I thought. I get DEMO
coming up to me and they don't comment about any of the many papers I've published, they comment
on that project. In fact, it sort of gave me a shock... I didn't realize the impact it does make on the
community until the first conference DEMO and I really got it right in the face, which was DEMO It was a
very nice pleasant feeling but I wasn't expecting that.
My one project is an extreme case of something which is DEMO in terms of, say, a journal
publication. On the one hand, you’ve got these high-tech publications, and on the other, the low-tech
aspects of taking a simple design and adapting it for use.  I’ve had very beautifully inscribed letters
from users, thanking me and that sort of thing. I’ve been on the local news, [laughs] and so on.  And
that, in a way, is rewarding.  But it has DEMO to do with the other side of the university as far as
high-tech is concerned.
Another thing about those seminars, you met people and they met you. So even after the seminars
were over, they had a contact with you.  So I would hear from them, they’d DEMO me up and say,
‘Who should I talk to about this or this.’ You’d get a network established.  It’s a different network
than you get when you go to a conference. That very often is DEMO internal network of academia. It
doesn’t reach out beyond academia in many cases.
The research project that led to the spin-off is the activity DEMO I’m most proud to have been involved
in. The spin-off activity is probably lower because I value the research and teaching aspects of what DEMO
do higher than the commercialization.  On the other hand, I recognize the importance of the
commercial activity, in contributing to the community, DEMO it pay back the university in many
ways through hiring of people from here and through direct funding back into the university, through
research contracts and through donations. Those things are very, very important contributions.
157
The dissatisfaction here is that this a design that people could DEMO using. I’m not worried about the
money involved; I’m not even DEMO about that. I’m just thinking here is a design that people could
be benefiting from but it’s not out there now because of the DEMO view of industry. I’m bordering
on anger…
Theme 2: University Environment
DEMO theme explores aspects of the university environment that appear to influence technology
transfer activities.  This top-level theme is further divided into four themes:  1) peers and group
norms;  2) academic leadership;  3) university culture; and, 4) experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations (DEMO).
Peers and Group Norms
The thing I liked about our technology transfer was that was that we had developed a theory that was
DEMO for the technology. There’s a problem with culture, you know at DEMO university, some people
disapprove of technology transfer, doing something useful, DEMO applied because they think it’s
trivial. Putting together the facts, that DEMO be trivial in the context of theory, together to solve a
DEMO can be an amazing intellectual accomplishment. I think some people are a little too smug.
They think that well if you’re doing something applied DEMO can’t be very intellectually challenging. I
think that’s wrong. It’s snobbery when people want to think that their work is above application.
There were DEMO few people in my department who felt that any connection with industry was wrong;
that it meant that you were not a real DEMO or a real scientist.  But it ranged all the way to DEMO few
people who were very interested in doing this with industry and keen and enthusiastic.  At least one
colleague was active and doing that kind of thing.  So reactions ranged all the way from some people
who thought you shouldn’t have anything whatsoever to do with industry, to others who were quite
supportive; it was the whole spectrum there.
The graduate students benefited and the university benefited because we put a lot DEMO money into the
university. Financially I was not doing too badly because I did consulting for significant pay. Because
it was coming through the DEMO, people could see the amounts. According to a Professor of
Economics DEMO Princeton University, a professor may inherit lots of money, he may marry lots of
money and he may spend lots of money, but he’s never, never supposed to earn lots of money. It is
un-academic. That sentiment was still at the university. We used to live at DEMO university, we didn’t
have any other life apart from the university. DEMO lot of us only interacted with other professors at the
university. And, my colleagues used to say, in the form of a joke, that we were prostituting academia
by being involved with industry. When I DEMO working on my start-up, I got pot shots from my
colleagues: that I was getting rich at the expense of the university and DEMO type of thing. It was not a
good situation for me.
158
No [my colleagues didn’t give me a hard time about making DEMO by investing in the spin-off].  I
think people thought that I DEMO a lot more of the company than I did. The average person might
have thought that I made a lot more out of it DEMO I actually did.  But I haven’t gotten that sort of
negative DEMO or concern or anything else.
[My colleague’s reactions] run the full gamut from very supportive and encouraging to others that
have a sense of DEMO  There’s a sense of envy sometimes, but I guess that’s not unique to a
university.  When I received an important award in recognition of the social value of my work a lot of
colleagues were DEMO congratulatory. It’s not that I’m going around looking for that but it’s
encouraging.  So there are people all across the university that congratulate you on achievements, and
that’s nice.  There’re a few, unfortunately, that DEMO snide remarks, ‘He’s not deserving of it,’ but
that’s their DEMO, not mine. There a few people who are envious, but, DEMO know, nobody who’s
ever succeeded has ever had entirely unanimous support.  The other part of that is that, in the applied
areas of research, contract research is a big part of our research funding here.  I try to take on research
projects where I don’t feel I’m competing with the private sector.  Sometimes the people that are
expressing the desire to be pure and not do research that is ‘tainted’ believe DEMO they say.
Sometimes, there’s a certain degree of envy. I’ve heard DEMO in other areas of the university
sometimes, “Some of those engineers DEMO there are going around getting rich; going out and doing
consulting DEMO making millions of dollars and everything else.”  It isn’t true, it just isn’t true.  Any
money I’ve made, I made by risking DEMO money.  I probably could have made as much putting it into
DEMO in the bank, you know, which is pretty risk free.  DEMO an argument that I’ve heard many times,
but I think that I can defend what I’ve done.
Colleagues didn’t care, it didn’t bother them.  A few colleagues also had had the opportunity to have
research projects with the company and it’s viewed as being generally good.  Hiring our students is
viewed as a good thing.  It enhances the reputation of the university.  That’s viewed as a good thing.
I think more people see the general benefits and appreciate them, rather than being annoyed at some
people making money from it.  I haven’t seen that as a problem.  And I haven’t noticed it as a
problem with other companies either.
[My colleagues were] almost all completely supportive. I’ve never gotten DEMO any negative
feedback, I don’t think.  If there was negative feedback it was mild enough that it didn’t scare me
[laughs].  I think people were pretty supportive.  At that time, other companies had been DEMO of
the University and it was viewed as being a good thing by almost everybody, so it wasn’t new for
most people.  I DEMO that it was viewed as part of the Waterloo culture, the DEMO advantage and I
think it’s still viewed that way now.  I DEMO that new employees, new faculty members see that there
is this DEMO to be able to take your ideas and commercialize them and benefit from them.
159
Academic Leadership
It perhaps wasn’t explicit but, implicitly, there was DEMO good support here by the senior
administrators.  One of our presidents DEMO a very externally-focused person.  He had a lot of contacts.
It’s DEMO that I ever went to him and said, ‘What do you DEMO of me doing this?’ but you sensed there
was a strong encouragement of taking the initiative.  Also we had deans that were superb.  Certainly
the few times I ever did go to sort of chat with them about internal research initiatives or external
activities, they were entirely encouraging.  In other words, you never felt that you were being DEMO
back, that you shouldn’t go out and do things. And one DEMO the vice-president’s of research, even to
this day, whenever I see him he asks about the company. You sensed that he was very DEMO of
technology development here being transferred to industry and public sector, DEMO commercialized
and so on.  I would say that he was a DEMO strong encouraging influence.  We had another president
for awhile who was DEMO a very fine fellow.  Again you sensed that you had this DEMO mandate to
go ahead and do things.  I think that basically DEMO had a good environment here.
[The support for the spin-off] was on all levels:  it was the Chair at the time, the Dean at the time, the
VP at the time.  Everybody was supportive DEMO off the line in the university hierarchy.
I didn’t cost the university anything during the first years of the start-up even though I was DEMO
teaching a couple of courses a year because the start-up was paying my university salary. I still had
Ph.D. students and I was still DEMO a lot of research funds to the research group. If I had left it
would have messed up the students. So I ended up DEMO at the university and trying to figure out a
way to make it work. I reached an agreement with the dean that I would DEMO suffer if I paid my salary
even if I didn’t teach four courses. When I retired the dean argued that I hadn’t been a DEMO
employee at the university because I didn’t have a full course load during the time I worked on the
start-up. Therefore I was not DEMO to the full-time benefits for that period. I was short-changed on
my pension. That was not the understanding that I had with them. I DEMO that the dean was doing this to
penalize me because he did not approve of technology transfer. If a university official, like the
president, asked him he would say he supported it but he was penalizing anybody who was involved
in it. He would find ways to prevent DEMO from getting certain benefits or charging your company the
full increment of your salary. Apparently the penalties I got were really small compared to DEMO of
the penalties for other people. We started comparing notes and we found out he was doing it to all of
us, not just to one individual. Our officials were not prepared to support technology transfer. DEMO
could see the benefits which would accrue to society and were prepared to support it but they
wouldn’t get involved themselves because they were DEMO that they would be tainted by getting
involved with business.
I don’t think we had one chairman, in the time I was there, DEMO felt you shouldn’t be doing
technology transfer.  We always felt that DEMO had some support there. Even the basic researchers
seemed OK.  I’ve DEMO had a very positive feeling towards my department.
160
We really tried to set an organization up within the university DEMO so we had meetings with
university administrators. I remember one day the Vice President of Research said, “Why don’t you
just set this thing up outside the university?” I said, “Well, there certainly would DEMO less red tape and
that seemed to be a good idea.” And I said to him, if we set this up outside the university, I would
pledge that I would not use resources of the university for our personal use. That was a very
significant moment because it DEMO almost a sigh of relief. I didn’t want to rip the university off. I
wanted the university to have every opportunity to participate if DEMO wanted to but it became obvious
that there were so many problems that it would have been better for us to do it ourselves. DEMO of us in
the start-up breathed a sigh of relief, when DEMO said, “Why don’t you take it outside?” That was a
DEMO moment.
University Culture
In the early days there was almost a revolution of young people. It was an era that fostered this, “You
can go out and do anything you want.”  We became much more conservative later on.  I don’t have
the capability to be able to really interpret it well but obviously we knew what was going on.  There
were occupations, there were protest marches, there were all kinds of DEMO going on.  As
researchers, a lot of us were on the sidelines saying ‘Gee, what’s going on?’  I think you were DEMO
conscious of what was going on, but you really couldn’t understand DEMO  In fact I think the radicals and
protesters themselves didn’t understand DEMO  So yeah, it was an interesting era.  Very much different
DEMO we have today.  I’m not sure how much that impacted what DEMO did but maybe the entrepreneurial
open spirit we had at that time may have been part of it, either caused by it or going along with it. I
really don’t know.  But the fact is it was an era that was very amenable or conducive to doing what
DEMO wanted, whether you wanted to be a radical, a protester, DEMO whether you wanted to be an
entrepreneur, establishing research programs or DEMO you wanted to do.  It was sort of a different
era DEMO today.
Before I worked at UW, I worked in a research DEMO where we were not allowed to really
explore our potential. The management and the environment really were not conducive to really
exerting yourself. Some DEMO the other researchers felt that the other new guys and I were undermining
them because they didn’t want to push themselves. At the beginning, they used to come and talk to us
one by one telling DEMO that we ought to be careful not to hurt ourselves by working so hard. Later on
they started unplugging our experiments. All we wanted DEMO to get in and advance the field. We
didn’t care about getting brownie points or getting a high salary or whatever.
Waterloo was very DEMO There was a lot of excitement. A lot of trying to build something and
that was very exciting; it was a very exciting period. There were no bounds on what we could do at
UW. The DEMO at that time said, “Put this faculty on the global map” DEMO that’s what we did. He was
promoting research excellence, good research DEMO in good refereed journals. He provided the
leadership. He indicated that you were contributing to the advancement of the field. We worked very
hard DEMO put the faculty on the academic map. The working environment was completely different from
the environment I had had before. There were no bounds; you could produce as much as you could
and not only in DEMO We started modernizing the undergraduate programs. We started developing
161
undergraduate laboratories, so we improved the undergraduate program and the graduate
programs. We started publishing in highly-respectable journals, refereed publications. After a while,
my research group at the University of Waterloo was well-recognized internationally. DEMO that was
quite a fulfillment. I miss the excitement of that time. It doesn’t exist now in the present environment
of the university. There DEMO an involvement whereby you were building something and that
excitement, it DEMO a fantastic excitement.
In the early days, Waterloo was moving and DEMO very quickly.  And I was invited to come here
and see DEMO was going on and look at the possibilities, you see.  When you think about Waterloo in
those days, it was the darling of the, the Ontario governments with its new co-op program.  And it
DEMO moving very, very quickly indeed.  And anyone I suppose less than, younger than thirty, had, had
a lot of sense of it could go a long way with all this encouragement.  It was an exciting time.  In
retrospect, it was a gamble, it was no question because it was feeling its feet.  And I suppose in those
days, you know, being younger and perhaps less conservative, it was worthwhile giving it a go, there
was nothing to lose.
Waterloo itself is an entrepreneurial place. We did many, many things here in the early days.  For
example, there was a new technology out there DEMO people desperately needed to know about this.  So
we actually went DEMO and taught courses.  That’s in the days when if a brochure DEMO on your desk, it
was rare as opposed to today, you just throw it in the garbage because there’s so many of them.  We
went on the road to all sorts of places and taught DEMO  We raised a huge amount of money, all of
which went into resources for research on campus.  That was my first real experience being an
entrepreneur.
An entrepreneur is someone who has interesting, exciting ideas and they want to make them real
someway and get them out DEMO individuals.  The University of Waterloo, we wanted to sell the ideas
that we had, we were a clear choice to go to school, an interesting place to go to school.  We had good
people DEMO, we have good students here and we wanted to convince the DEMO of the world that
Waterloo is not a bad place.  And DEMO looks like we’ve succeeded.  That’s what I mean by
entrepreneurial.  You’re excited about what you’re doing and want other people to be excited DEMO it
and participate too.
The university isn’t as entrepreneurial as it used to be, which I think is a shame. I guess there were
always people around here who weren’t entrepreneurial per se, they were here to teach and just do
research.  I teach and do research too but I get excited about my ideas and I try to sell DEMO to other
people.
UW had a very entrepreneurial spirit.  I don’t DEMO that so much in a commercial sense, but in the
sense DEMO people were enthusiastic and energetic.  We didn’t realize it at the DEMO but there was very
little bureaucracy here at that time.  Bureaucracy DEMO as an organization gets older, like creeping
162
fungus. If we wanted to do something that made sense and DEMO could talk our colleagues into it,
the attitude was, “Sure, let’s go, get on with it.”  We had a dean who DEMO very highly supportive.
You could walk into him with an idea and he’d say, “Well what’s holding you back? Go ahead.”  I
think there was a lot of trust too in those days.  The trust was primarily internal, like from the dean to
the chair of the department, the administrators trusted you to go out and do something useful and they
gave you literally free rein to do it.  We were kind of unaware of it at the time but looking back, this
attitude and enthusiasm and encouragement were very influential in the growth of DEMO place.  And
obviously the people you attract to that kind of DEMO; you attract younger people who have energy
and enthusiasm.
I think DEMO had some very remarkable people. Ralph Stanton, who started the math DEMO, for
example. He had graduates that he also taught in Portuguese DEMO Physics.  He had the largest
Portuguese library in Canada.  This is not your typical man on the street.  There were those sorts of
people around, some very clever and innovative people that made the University of Waterloo what it
is today. [Resistance to doing work with industry] DEMO to the university later. There were a lot of
innovations and things that people would try. Then we got bigger, maybe we got successful. I don’t
know what you would call it.  We became established. That innovative spirit, a lot of it died. What is
the last major innovation in a sense of starting a co-op program or something like DEMO that you know
that’s happened at this university?
Experiences with Technology Transfer Support Organizations (TTSOs)
At one point the start-up was partly owned by a government-funded technology transfer support
organization (GTTSO) that wanted DEMO sell their shares and get money for it. At that time, DEMO
investors were interested in buying technology companies. I was not prepared to do that. The GTTSO
was pushing for it and I was not DEMO to sell because I wanted the business to grow. I later found
out that the person I dealt with at the GTTSO had a DEMO incentive which was based on return on
investment. He had personal incentive to see the technology sold rather than be built-up in Ontario.
We DEMO over to the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office over here at the university and we
talked to them about a patent and how do DEMO go about it. And they sat down with us and we said
okay, ‘We'll carry the ball for you on this.’ So the university really came to our aid, there's no doubt
about it. And they did all the correspondence with their patent lawyer and they DEMO the patenting.
The most frustrating part in the whole thing was this patent, reading over all the details from the
patent office. The patent office response said that a completely different technology with a different
use DEMO the same capability. I almost went down to Washington and said, DEMO's the guy who wrote
this thing? [laughs] Let me strangle DEMO [continues laughing] How stupid can you be?’ That was the
most frustrating part. I was a bit disappointed with the university’s patent lawyers. DEMO they did was
take the patent office reply to the application out of one envelope, take a look at it and send it back to
us, saying, ‘You come back with your counter arguments.’ Meanwhile, while charging another $7000
or whatever it is.
163
I have had extremely limited contact with the Technology Transfer and DEMO Office.  I don’t
mean to sound really negative on this but DEMO have to be honest. Quite frankly, I felt that the amount DEMO
bureaucratic or administrative support you get can be more constraining than it can be helpful.  I think
those offices are probably more conducive to the young faculty member who really doesn’t know
how to go out DEMO license or commercialize his or her idea.  I think that for DEMO experienced faculty
members, they’re probably not that much help.
The university’s DEMO stake in the start-up got transferred into a technology transfer support
organization (TTSO). After the equity was sold, it appeared that the DEMO didn’t go to the university
… it stayed in the TTSO. I was very upset at finding out that the money did not go DEMO the university. I
did not do a proper accounting when I gave that equity to the university. I did not sit down and say,DEMO
“This share is worth so much.” I just made a good gesture. If it was for value added, I wouldn’t have
given them so much. So when the equity was sold and the money did not DEMO to the university, I
was very upset about it.
The Technology DEMO Support Organization (TTSO) was almost useless when it came to helping
with the new company. As it turned out, they weren’t actually part of the university but they tried
hard to make people think they DEMO They wanted to own a piece of the company. We almost ended
up in a lawsuit by the time that was over because they DEMO about half the value of the company by
giving us access to an engineer to help us with the product development. It turned out DEMO on that
that engineer had never been to university, he wasn’t DEMO engineer at all.  He had a high school
diploma and had DEMO at a local company to do some high tech stuff but they were billing him as
an engineer.  We discovered when he made some suggestions for our product that were completely
unphysical, he didn’t understand the science of the way the product worked at all. I had to DEMO a
lawyer and break that off.
I think the University of Waterloo’s policy in giving the professor ownership of, of intellectual
property is a good one.  Most Canadian universities don’t act that way, so that’s DEMO big positive in my
mind for the University of Waterloo.
When we first started developing technology in the lab, I approached the university for help with the
patenting. The way things work at the University of DEMO, if the university helps with the
patenting then they expect to DEMO something.  In other words, they paid out money, so they DEMO to
get a return on it. That makes sense.  As it DEMO out, I visited the technology transfer office and they
looked at DEMO technology and said, “No, we don’t think the university should put in any money into
that technology.”  I went ahead and had the patent put in without their help.
I applied for these patents and DEMO of them started to issue. When I started to apply for patent
number two, people knew that we were applying for another patent.  DEMO that point in time, the
university said, “We’d like to help you with the patenting of this one.”  I said, “You didn’t DEMO with
164
the first one.  If you start helping with the second one or the third one, then you start getting
ownership but the risk was in doing patent number one.”  I didn’t ask them for help with the second
or third patents or any of those because I DEMO if they were unable or unwilling to help with the first
one, they shouldn’t be able to buy in later after most of the risk has been done.  They agreed with that.
When the university refused to help with the patent, it was because they did not see a way to license
the technology, and most university technology transfer people are focused on licensing.  They don’t
understand that there are a lot of technologies that are not licensable.  My technology is a perfect
example of one.  In the early days, we tried to license this DEMO and we could find nobody who
even knew what it was all about, let alone was interested in licensing it.  I think the DEMO is that if
you came up with a new chemical process and you take that to the licensing office, they’ll go down to
the chemical industry down the road and say, “Do you want to license this process?”  The chemical
industry may say, “Yeah, that, DEMO looks really great, we’ll license that.” But if you’re doing
something DEMO new, there is very often nobody out there who will license DEMO From my experience,
one of the major problems is the technology transfer office is thinking about licensing only.  The idea
of the professor starting his own company is a waste of time. The professor doesn’t DEMO anything
about business and therefore it will fail.  Certainly that was DEMO case when I started my spin-off.
There was nobody out there who even understood what our technology was, let alone was interested
in licensing it.  Even if there had been somebody out there who understood what the technology was,
we would never have found them.  I think this is a major problem in technology transfer.  In the U.S.
it’s not nearly such a big problem because there it’s quite common for DEMO to start companies.
The SBRI grants are set up to fit that situation exactly and they’ve been very successful.  There’s no
equivalent granting agency in Canada and the technology transfer offices in Canada don’t expect that
DEMO work.  They may have changed by now. I don’t know but DEMO doubt it.  They understand licensing and
they don’t understand letting a DEMO start his own company.  It’s not just at the University of
DEMO; I’ve talked to technology transfer officers from all over and they DEMO talk about licensing.
That seems to be their focus.
I don’t think we would have been able to commercialize the technology through the university
DEMO our technology is really a management system.  It’s just not a DEMO of product or service that
you can realistically market out of the university.  That’s not to say that the university’s bad or
anything, DEMO just isn’t the type of thing that you could have done.  DEMO products and services could
be.
Working with the TTLO just wasn’t feasible.  We would have been too constrained. That’s not a
knock against them, it’s just the type of thing that they’re not really set up to do.  They’re more set up
to take an inventor’s idea and help in getting the patents and the licensing, etc.  I’m not DEMO that
they’re well set up to do that, but they’re more DEMO You know, I’m really not aware of what the
university really DEMO to help inventors in that sense.
Those people over in the Office of Research, and possibly in the TTLO, really have trouble living
DEMO to the expectations that professors have because they’re also burdened with all the bureaucracy
they have to deal with.  I’m not questioning their motivation.  They’re pretty good people, they try
165
hard, but they’re committed but they’re understaffed, I think.  I don’t think there’s any lack of
motivation but sometimes there’s demoralization, which is natural when you get overworked and
understaffed and pushed. Let’s face DEMO, faculty members can be bloody boorish and demanding, at
times.  DEMO know, if you talk to any of the administrative people, they sometimes get yelled at by
faculty members who act like little children.  There’s no excuse for that at all.  Just not on.
After the first project failed, I didn't go to the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office to try to get
a patent for the second project DEMO I couldn't really see the market. We did the market test on our
own and it failed. I thought, ‘I don't think the Technology Transfer Office would like it, especially
with our experience with the first failure.’ I had gone to the companies and said, ‘Look. I’ll give you
the design as it is now. I’ll sign it DEMO to you.’ If it had gone ahead, I would have gone DEMO the
Technology Transfer people at that point in time and got them to come in on some legal document but
it never did get DEMO that stage unfortunately.
[The university support through the technology transfer office] certainly was valuable but…  There’s
a place here where we’re talking about candour and now I’m kind of against the barrier. I think that if
DEMO university is going to do something like have a technology transfer office, the staff there should
not expect some portion of the companies which are being developed. Universities should hold equity
positions.  I have nothing against that.  But the individuals representing the university shouldn’t. A lot
of the businesses that went through that process were [allegedly] asked for a percentage, a share of
the business, by an individual who worked in the technology transfer office. I don’t think that
anybody regrets giving money to DEMO university.  But you have somebody who probably is on the
university DEMO also acting as an individual for a share of the company… There was a lot of
resentment from a lot of companies, people among those companies… And some people just avoided
that office completely.
We built DEMO couple of test units. I made the measurements myself and it worked as predicted. People
were interested in it. I presented the results to DEMO trade association. They thought it was great.
Because I was so busy, I turned to the university, who would develop and license things DEMO in
the university. So, I gave them the rights to the DEMO and verbally I told them, “Under condition
that you do not DEMO to Company A,” whose management I had come to distrust. To me, they were
dishonest. The university came back to me, I DEMO how long later, weeks or months later and they
said, “We have licensed the invention, we have an exclusive licence with Company A. ” So the
licence gave Company A an exclusive contract to manufacture DEMO invention. It made quite a few of
them based on what I was telling people, by my reputation. We started calling up how they were
working, and they weren’t working. And our first thought was that a particular critical component had
failed. I had the university call Company DEMO and ask about that component and they responded, “Oh,
that DEMO too complicated to put in. It’s not included…” So Company A had had
manufactured this thing incorrectly, they didn’t work and within two years, the idea was dead.

Theme 3: Rewards and Reward Systems
This theme contains vignettes related to rewards and rewards systems related to technology transfer
activities.  These rewards systems are elements of the university environment; they were captured in
this top-level theme because of their importance with respect to this thesis.  This top-level theme is
further divided into three themes:  1) Intellectual Property (IP) policies;  2) financial rewards; and, 3)
other reward systems.
IP Policies
IP policies range across the country, from the UBC model to models like Waterloo, which is probably
the most generous of any university in Canada; the IP belongs to the researcher although the
researcher can make a deal with the university.  I think that if the university-owner model were
applied right across the board to every DEMO of IP developed or every product or research product or
service, DEMO would work fine for some. Others, like our type of thing, it just doesn’t work.  It wouldn’t
be practical.  I’m not sure DEMO other university-owner institutions operate but, I think there has to be
DEMO flexibility in that. I can see that if you use your university resources, you get research funding
that comes from the university or the university provides the environment and covers a lot of the
overhead, they should get a piece of the action.  But, I think, Waterloo’s attitude, and again it’s not
explicit, is more that if I DEMO successful, then there’s an expectation, or a hope, that you DEMO be
generous in turn by providing endowments to the university.  And DEMO think, like that’s personally the
model I prefer.  In fact, DEMO contribute to an endowed chair.  It’s a model that would hopefully DEMO
just as much income for the university as the other model where the university owns the IP because
there’s a marketing cost associated with DEMO too, that may or may not pay off.
It is claimed DEMO Waterloo had generated, I’ll say, twenty-two percent of the spin-off companies in
this country that have spun off from universities.  That’s a phenomenal record.  So you have to ask
yourself, what is it that, that’s happened.  I would sort of define a spin-off as any company that sort of
came out of the creative juices of some individual, whether it was a professor or student or whoever,
that caused DEMO to go off and start an organization up.  I think we’ve DEMO so successful because I
think one of our key features here is the intellectual property policy, which basically says, “You
create it, you own it.”  Other institutions have much more complicated policies.  There’s an DEMO to
require that the university should share in the ownership.  When DEMO happens, the first thing that
happens is you get into discussions DEMO to who owns what.  You know, if I have an idea in this office
and then I rent a garage down the street DEMO do all my work in the garage down the street, does DEMO
university have a share?  I don’t have any idea how you decide that.  So, you don’t want to even go
there.  I mean, can you imagine if I have an idea and then I go and try and sell it, and get into an
adversarial situation where the university is challenging my right to have ownership of this DEMO?
Because they paid me to have the idea didn’t they?  I mean, paid my salary.  Did I have the idea in DEMO
shower?  Did I have it in this office?  I have no idea.  This really complicates situations very easily.
If the university just says, “You own them,” it is has eliminated a lot of the complication.  First of all,
the IP policy’s simple. It’s a very good thing because frankly it avoids a whole lot of wasted DEMO
on trying to figure out what make sense.  The second thing DEMO that universities then often set up
167
corporations to exploit this IP. They hire people, some of these people are very competent, but, 1)
they probably don’t understand DEMO it is they’re selling in many cases and, 2) they don’t have any
passion about it.  They’re just selling something.  You don’t DEMO the originator behind the idea, the
person who said, “I think this is just terrific.  I’ve just got to go out and make this happen.”  I think
there’s a real problem there. I think if you look at some of these corporations that have been set up DEMO
exploit university IP, they’re not very successful. I could be wrong DEMO that’s my sense.
I don’t know how it works in other institutions but the University of Waterloo says, “I own my
invention.”  Now, I have to exploit it. I can exploit it myself or I DEMO seek outside or inside help.  If I
wish to seek inside DEMO, there are people at the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office, who
supposedly know at least some of the questions and answers.  There will be a fee for that service and I
can pay the fee DEMO different ways.  I can pay cash or I can give a DEMO of what might come out of this
or whatever.  There’re mechanisms DEMO place to allow me to acquire this information.  Although what I
DEMO, I’ve just learned, that’s all; we talk among ourselves and DEMO to lawyers when we need to.
What you’re suggesting is that there should be a formal structure at the university that manages this
IP, manages its sales, etc.  What I’m saying is that there could DEMO a structure in place to provide
certain services, which I can DEMO, but I don’t have to buy.  That’s what we have here at Waterloo.  I
have personal opinions about how well the TTLO works but I don’t want to comment because I’ve
never used them.  We’ve always gone our own way.  We have enough collective understanding let’s
say.  I think people that have intellectual property, have to have a DEMO for what they are doing.
There’re successes around here and those people had a passion for what they were doing.
If you’re a university DEMO Queen’s where you have a very large history and a very eminent medical
faculty, there’re pharmaceutical products developed. Queen’s, from what I understand, has a heck of
a good amount of revenue from the patents DEMO products that have been developed there.  That’s
grown over time.  I think it’s more amenable to things like pharmaceuticals than it is to DEMO software
package, for example, because a software package isn’t something that you could just take and
transfer it.  Plug it in somewhere to a commercial application.  Who does all the upgrades on it?  Who
does the continuing improvement and redevelopment, which our company has to do, if you’re going
to stay competitive.  The university is not set DEMO to do that sort of thing, at all, unless somebody’s
giving me a contract to upgrade the package, and to do software maintenance, the university isn’t
equipped to do that either.  So it’s just DEMO different type of animal, even though I think both are
legitimate DEMO the university environment.
[If UW’s policy switched to university-ownership] I think we would lose a lot of future faculty
members in the high-tech fields.  I don’t know that we’d lose current ones.  We might.  We’d
DEMO lose future ones.  It’s a big attraction for hiring.  In most cases, would it make a huge
difference in how things actually end up?  Like who makes how much money from what?  How DEMO
does the university gain?  How much does the individual gain on the projects that get
commercialized?  Probably not because there’s already a DEMO between individuals and the
university in various ways.  A reasonable university DEMO probably still try to encourage the
168
individuals by actually paying them fairly richly for doing the commercialization DEMO allow the
same kind of activity to go on.  So, in the instances where commercial activity takes place, my guess
is it would be structured very similarly to the way they are now.  I don’t think as many would take
place.  Certainly, not in the short DEMO, at Waterloo.  I think that there’d be a big drop.  DEMO worse is
that, in the long run, the potential would go down because we would hire fewer entrepreneurial-type
people.  I’m absolutely convinced of that.  It would be a very bad move for Waterloo.
The university was very helpful actually. The university has a policy that if you DEMO some sort of
intellectual property development it belongs to you. In return, I think people like to return something
to the university because of that. It certainly is an incentive thing and I think that’s an DEMO that
other places that haven’t done as well.  I know places DEMO have tried to develop research parks and
they end up just giving cheap rent or in this conflict… So I think that’s a major DEMO at U of W.  And
also our president at the time, he was very entrepreneurial. And so the spirit was ripe for doing DEMO
sort of development.
Something that is very important at the university is that they do give the university professor
ownership of the patents.  I think that’s very important and I think that should continue.  Most
universities claim percentage ownership and the problem with that is when you set DEMO a company, the
investors in the company don’t see the university’s DEMO as being helpful.  In fact, they see it as
a very negative thing to have the university involved.  The reason for that is because they know that,
if the company needs money and investors DEMO expected to pony up and put more money in relative to
their stock ownership, the university will not do that, they never will.  And so they don’t look upon
the university as being a useful DEMO  I don’t think most people at the university realize that.
One DEMO the things that Waterloo has done, that I think is a DEMO for what’s happened to Waterloo in
terms of turning out new companies, is that Waterloo has encouraged people to put the results of their
work into practice. And they’ve done that by allowing the people who DEMO the research to own the
results of the research. And that’s the only university in Canada, I believe, that has that rule. At DEMO the
other universities, either the university owns the intellectual property or DEMO university will share the
intellectual property with the investigator. In our case, it didn’t make any difference because we
didn’t take intellectual property from the university to set up the company. All of our intellectual
property DEMO already been published in the literature and we just wanted to see it applied in the best
possible way. But, I think the feeling is that it’s part of what the university wants us to do. DEMO you
then go the extra step and see it applied.
If you’re going to do a lot of extra work, if you’re going to do the eighty hours a week to get
something going and the DEMO owns ninety percent of it, whatever you produce, then you lose
incentive to do it. And it’s not only the money, it’s control. You know that you worked your buns off
and in the end DEMO doesn’t matter because if the university owns the technology and they decide that
you’re not going to use it in that way and then DEMO you worked for could be destroyed in a
moment. I mean, DEMO you do it, if you own it, then you’re responsible for it for better of for worse. If
169
you make a mistake, then you suffer. If you do well, then you see things grow. You don’t have
that other ownership body out there who really controls what you’re doing and has the ultimate DEMO in
what you’re doing. It’s also pride, I think, and you do something because you want to see it flourish.
The most important DEMO to foster academic entrepreneurship], is the one I mentioned. That the
DEMO property rights reside with the researcher. The sense of ownership… it’s more, “Is this a
part of you?” You’re reputation is on the line. It’s your idea that’s on the line. So it’s more a DEMO of
ownership, I think, than pride.
The downside of the current policy is making sure that everybody is signed in and gets included DEMO
they should be included and that we really know who owns what, at the time. I think it can be
addressed better.  I DEMO that Waterloo could put some more effort into making sure that everybody
works early on to establish who owns what. If something gets developed, making sure that the
developers are all included and that everybody knows DEMO is a developer and who is not, early on.
So that DEMO very well and because of the early success in being able to license a few universities
through the university, we could see that there was a potential for a spin-off. Because of the inventor-
ownership policy DEMO Waterloo we were able to see a future for us in putting in the extra effort needed,
at the end, to make this work.
The university policy of inventor-ownership is supportive of this spin-off formation.  It means that the
individuals have the option to put more effort DEMO something with the potential payoff to themselves,
as opposed to the university dictating that whatever the individuals do, the university has the right to
decide how things happen with it and therefore you’re always subject DEMO the university’s whims:
whether or not something can be commercialized in the way that you think it should be or could be.
My DEMO is that the company wouldn’t have started if the intellectual property was university-owned.
Who within the university would have said, ‘Let’s do it?’  And how would the university have
convinced us, the people who DEMO did it, that we should do it on their behalf?  DEMO did it because
we wanted to do it and we didn’t have to ask somebody for permission.
The IP policy says that inventors don’t DEMO owe the university anything but I think there’s been
moral obligation, DEMO by many people who have started companies, to pay the university DEMO  In
some senses, there’s an investment back into the university, DEMO where some of this moral
obligation comes in.  It’s not just DEMO for activities that happened but it’s rather paying back the
university so that the university can start other new activities.  It’s more of a forward-looking moral
obligation rather than a past payment of debt kind of DEMO
170
Financial Rewards
Everybody who worked on the research project that was DEMO basis for the spin-off was given an
opportunity to invest.  I DEMO reasonable access to money, so I was able to invest without DEMO  In other
words, if the money disappeared, it disappeared.  I wasn’t going to cry.  Well, I’d cry but not very
much.  So we were all in this together.  We continued to do our research but we invested in a little
company that was just starting DEMO  We were always very careful to make sure that we always DEMO our
job at the university and we followed the policies and rules at the university very carefully.  It wasn’t
the case that it was all very well orchestrated because you can not ever create the perception DEMO
working at the university is a way to get rich because it isn’t.  There’s nothing wrong with making
investments.  We all do that.  It’s called the stock market, bond market or whatever.  If we DEMO work
together so that we both win, that’s a good thing DEMO do, which is what happened.  So, I want to be DEMO
careful how one says that because it can be very easily misinterpreted.
It’s not money. I don’t think that was ever the motivating factor. DEMO money was the motivating factor, I
would have just stayed in DEMO and done straight consulting. It’s the fact that you can see
something grow, you can see a place where your other students can move to do really meaningful and
exciting work. And there are lots of DEMO that are more important than the actual financial rewards.
There are two ways of being rewarded, at least two ways. One is financial and the other one is the
good feeling of seeing something flourish. Certainly DEMO: it was fair. I felt fairly rewarded.
Financially it was fine. DEMO like a dot-com where you make many millions of dollars. It was very
rewarding in terms of seeing something grow and flourish and do DEMO in Canada. It still gives me
pride when I go to a trade conference or go to a conference where I see people talk DEMO what
they’ve achieved using our products. Especially to trade conferences, where DEMO year, there’d be a
huge number of presentations of people who DEMO done work with many different applications. And
it’s all done with products that I played a role in bringing to the point where it DEMO be used. So there is
a pride and it’s a ‘feel good’ that you've done something to make the world a little bit DEMO place.
I’m not worried about getting any recognition for this. I’ve received international awards, national
awards and career awards for the things I’ve done so another one’s not going to make any difference
to me. I DEMO I’m more interested in having satisfied users, just to talk to DEMO and say, ‘How are you
finding it?’ and have their DEMO light up and them say, “It’s the greatest thing since sliced DEMO  If,
afterwards, I made a little money that would be a benefit but that wasn’t a certainty at that stage of the
DEMO In fact, if it was money that I was interested in DEMO might have taken a different route.  I would
have short-circuited some DEMO the things to get to the answer quicker. Instead, I was DEMO that
this wasn’t just going to be a design out there that looked better, I was going to analyze the problem
in the most rigorous scientific way to show that my solution is better than anything DEMO there.
I think in academia, you can create real serious problems DEMO yourself if you talk about making money
through technology transfer.  Academia DEMO not celebrate wealth.  That’s crass, that’s commercial.
They celebrate other things, they celebrate publications, they celebrate good teaching, they celebrate
171
honours:  The Order of Canada, Fellow of the Society of Canada, and that kind of stuff.  There is
a different set DEMO criteria by which they measure success.  You can be poor as DEMO church mouse but, by
God, you’ve got three hundred publications.  DEMO, is that good or bad?  I’m not going to comment.
DEMO all where you stand.
When entrepreneurs outside of academia, make it DEMO, they expose it.  Like an entrepreneur friend of
mine and his Ferrari.  In that culture that’s one of the marks of success. Counting wealth in an
academic institution is, in my opinion, not smart.  You don’t see me driving up here in a Rolls Royce.
I DEMO a modest car, I mean it’s a nice car, but it’s a modest car.  I don’t own a Ferrari, I’m not
interested DEMO one and all that stuff.  I can let people know where DEMO coming from if I have to, if it’s
important for some DEMO reason, but no you don’t want to shout your wealth in DEMO academic
institution. You’re just asking for trouble because a lot of academics are ‘poor’. Academics are fairly
well paid on the average, better than say, the average working man by quite a bit.  They’re paid DEMO do
mostly what they want to do, which is explore and DEMO fun but I don’t really mean to play around.  I
mean DEMO are very serious scholars that are doing the work they want to do.  They’re not working in
an office making twice as much money, but hating every minute of it. They’re doing what they want
to do.  A lot of them will retire with a comfortable pension but they’ll never have a lot of money.  So,
it’s best to leave it alone. You can create envy, jealousy, etc.  You can create that anyway in any
society.  I don’t wish to say universities are any different or any better or worse than any other
society.
DEMO I say I am not interested in money, all it means DEMO that I’m not interested in accumulating
personal monetary worth. I’m not interested in that but it doesn’t mean that I don’t know how to
DEMO it. They’re two completely different things. I was never interested in trying to accumulate one
million dollars, two million dollars, ten million dollars, fifty million dollars. That’s not what I set out
to do. I DEMO more interested in and I still am interested in how to get the company to grow. Now the
company has to be profitable. If DEMO company is not profitable it will not create more technology. I’m
interested in technology. If you look at the core values of this company DEMO find that our aim is to
create better and better technology but to do that you need money, therefore you have to be profitable.
And I know how to look after a company to make sure DEMO it is profitable. But I’m not personally
interested in a lot of money. There is a limit on how much I can eat, there is a limit how much I can
wear, there is a limit on how much I can travel. Those needs could be satisfied, not with millions, but
maybe with thousands. So that’s two different things you see? Of course, I was always interested in
providing comfort to DEMO and to my family and I still am, but it doesn’t DEMO that I’m interested in, in
money. I like to be comfortable, yeah. I like to have a warm house; I don’t want another cold house. I
could afford to have a house which is 200,DEMO square feet with swimming pools and extravaganza and
all that. I’m not interested. I’m interested in comfortable clothes. For example, the shirt I’m wearing
probably cost $30 or $40. If I was interested in money, I would get a shirt which cost $400 or $500. I
got a DEMO, an Armani shirt which cost $400. But I really don’t need DEMO $400 shirt. You see the
difference?
172
You have to have some motivation for the people doing it. DEMO don’t think the commercialization
always happened as much without that incentive.  DEMO will just pursue their research. Why do
people, who are just DEMO pure research, who aren’t doing commercialization, why do they publish in
journals?  There are three reasons. First, they want to let their colleagues know what they’re doing,
and they want to be able DEMO read what their colleagues are doing.  The second thing is it’s DEMO or
perish, right?  And the third is you don’t get DEMO money unless you publish.  These things would
happen but not to DEMO extent that they happen without the monetary incentives. Also, we did DEMO lot of
research as part of our jobs but we also spent a lot of time that wasn’t the university time pursuing
these things.
DEMO of the early investors in the company wanted to put money in the company. Unlike everybody
else, he didn’t want to have a share of it. We forced him to have a share of it.  As far as he was
concerned, putting money into the company is guaranteeing future employment for himself.  He’s an
expert in this area.  The DEMO will know that he’s an expert and they come to him when they want
him because they’ll know that he’s the best in what DEMO does.  And, just having one more company in
Waterloo who hires people is a good thing for him, personally.  That’s why he DEMO  Part of me
says that about the company with respect to DEMO university, too.  So having started it off, having it
grow DEMO now having it be as successful as it is… I think it’s a great thing for Waterloo.  I’m proud of
what happened with it and proud of my role in it.
Other Reward Systems
A number DEMO years ago a graduate of my department made a career out of offering seminars for
people in industry; they’d be one day seminars or weekend seminars.  We went to large Canadian
technology companies or he would gather a bunch of engineers from around Toronto together.  Now
the point was, I could do this because by that time I was a full professor, so it was no skin off my
teeth.  But DEMO sat on many promotion committees, and certainly when it came to DEMO question of rank or
promotion for a junior professor, an assistant DEMO associate professor, that activity would count for
nothing.  Now that activity was a way of transferring stuff out of the university environment because
DEMO were doing studies on technology development.  We published them in journals DEMO things like
that but nobody we ever ran into ever read any journals on it. I’ve never run across very many
industrial R&D-types DEMO spend very much time reading journals.  But if you gave a DEMO and
charged them $500 or something for the seminar and took them off to some place to talk about it
they’d come. But that’s DEMO a method of dissemination that universities used.
I think the university really has to compartmentalize and say to researchers, “Look, not only do DEMO pay
attention to somebody who’s producing fundamental work but I also like to reward those who are
doing applied research: the guys taking the research and applying it to solve particular problems in
the society. It’s DEMO that it has to be high tech, but the standard has DEMO be of considerable level. Also,
the university has to identify good teachers. It’s no good just to say, “Oh, he’s a good DEMO If he’s
a good teacher, he has to come up with DEMO and facilitate much better transfer of knowledge
from him to the student. The university has to compartmentalize that expertise and not to expect
173
everybody to develop in all directions. Most of the universities are DEMO doing it. We talk about the
University of Waterloo. They could have the luxury to say, “I’m going to compartmentalize and I
want to reward individuals who are really good fundamental researchers, reward individuals who are
applied researchers, and reward good teachers. They’re not doing that because it takes a lot of effort
at the top level to put this DEMO in place. They’d have to work with the faculty association because
immediately when the faculty association sees that the university’s trying to change things, they
assume that they’re out to screw them, you see? So DEMO have to basically work carefully with them
and you’d find that the faculty association would be cooperative because they’d realize that it’s
something which DEMO good for them and it’s good for the university. It’s good for the individuals. But
it’s a lot of work to do that and DEMO up with processes.
The answer [to how to promote university-industry relationships] is like a lot of things, in my view.
The most you can do is create an environment.  I think whenever there’s a big plan where government
throws in millions of dollars and a centre of excellence DEMO set up and five industries are brought in
here and ten universities come in here and they produce a big program.  To me, DEMO things almost
always fail.  I think what has to happen is DEMO there has to be encouragement and there has to be an
environment, which fosters entrepreneurial things.  I think people have to start off DEMO a one-on-one
basis working at a low level and then see things grow. I believe in bottom-up, not top-down.  You
only set up DEMO big structure to handle something, which is already working.  You don’t set up the big
structure first and then try to plug people DEMO to make it work because it’s just a scramble for money
and there are fights. The motivations are all wrong.
I think the answer DEMO you just create an environment which facilitates these sorts of things.  DEMO
encourage it verbally and then you let the individuals try to fulfill those goals as best they know how.
And that will be different DEMO everybody.  I think they should be encouraged to take risks.  That’s a
huge, huge part of it.  That people are allowed to DEMO things, which are risky without hurting their
reputation and career within DEMO university. You should be allowed to fail, that’s part of research. DEMO
way we do research in the universities tends to be you’re rewarded for the things you succeed at,
which is very unfortunate because DEMO of the things you don’t succeed at are the most important
issues that exist and you should be allowed to fail and try again, and fail and try again, and still not be
marked down because of your failure.  It’s very hard because the university, like everybody DEMO, tries
to quantify us.  So your advancement through the ranks depends on successes, your pay depends on
successes.  So it’s hard to DEMO people to take risks.
It’s very difficult, I’ve found, for practicing engineers and practicing engineering academics to drink
coffee together.  They’re operating on different incentive systems.  If I’m out in the practice of
engineering and I’m out there starting to develop a product my future lies in DEMO success of the
product. If I’m an academic my future lies in the success of publication.  Those are different and
facing in opposite directions, quite often.  Academics get frustrated because the practicing person
isn’t really DEMO in coming to a conclusion and the academic isn’t really interested in the fact that
this is going to be a product and we DEMO to take into account a number of other considerations that
are outside of my field of expertise and so it’s hard for them to DEMO together.  You have to set up a
174
situation where they work together and the difficulty is both organizations, the academic
organization and the industry organization, don’t set up incentive programs to have them work
together.  And industry is always resenting having to pay money to their practicing people to go off
and do a DEMO of brainstorming or, ‘If we let them spend too much time DEMO this bunch of academics
they’ll get to be too theoretical’.  It DEMO them money.  It costs a lot to take an engineer out DEMO his
environment and send him somewhere for a week because you lose all that productivity and you lose
all of the people that they DEMO to in your organization or out because there’s a hole that week.  And
similarly university departments aren’t very amenable to see a faculty member going and spending a
week at a company.  What’s he doing?  Where’re his students?  So it’s very hard.
There is a certain DEMO on those three parties, industry, academia, and government, to set up
rewards systems that encourage the coming together of academia and industry; that don’t discourage
it.  That’s particularly true in universities where you have applied faculties like engineering and
architecture and things like that.  Now in Germany or in Europe it’s not nearly the same problem
because the DEMO that teach applied stuff are not embedded along with the pure researchers so
they can have their own rewards system.  The one thing that happens within a university system you
see is that you get all DEMO different faculties: arts, health studies, environmental studies, engineering,
science and mathematics.  And the only common ground they can talk about is publication. So at the
university level, publication becomes the fundamental measure; DEMO else is secondary to it.
Then after publication comes teaching and there’s a commonality here that they can get at.  But when
you get to an architectural faculty member who designed a new museum, how do you relate that to
what the historian has done?  Design activity DEMO not a common thing to all departments and all
faculties in universities, so it doesn’t count.  Ask any architectural faculty member how hard DEMO have
to fight to get the fact that you’ve designed a building that was built recognized within academia as a
legitimate reason for being DEMO
I think there are different rewards you know.  Applied math and DEMO students are rewarded by
the phenomenon, ‘Look, Ma, what I DEMO  Whereas pure math and science students very often are
rewarded by DEMO Eureka phenomenon, ‘Now I understand!’  Well, for a lot of DEMO students,
understanding something isn’t the end of it. How do you apply it? To what? Build what? That’s why
many of those students, once they graduate, get somewhat alienated from the university. The
DEMO rewards system isn’t involved in this sort of, ‘Look, Ma, DEMO I built!’ sort of thing.  It’s,
‘Look, Ma, what DEMO now understand.’
Theme 4: Attitudes & Motivations Regarding the Role of DEMO Professor
This theme captures information regarding the participants’ attitudes towards research directions and
the role of the professor and/or the university in society DEMO some descriptions of those aspects of
being a professor that they do or don’t enjoy.  Therefore, this top-level theme is further divided into
DEMO themes:  1) attitudes; and, 2) job elements and job satisfaction.
175
Attitudes
I personally feel our job is to really act as DEMO dictionary or a lexicon as far as industry is concerned.  In
DEMO words, there’re a lot of things we do here, which I don’t think are understood by industry.
Maybe we’re using the wrong terminology.  There’s got to be someone, maybe like myself or
someone who we’re teaching, able to translate what we’re doing to be understood by and be used by
people in industry, you see.  We can do DEMO sorts of wonderful things but I guess the important thing is
to use them. In many respects, that’s really important thing. We can do all this work and really what
does it mean?  The thing DEMO only any good if it’s useful.
Faculty members have three basic jobs within the university:  research, teaching and service. If you
had something that could be exploited, for societal good and maybe for your benefit as well, and it
does not conflict with those other duties, DEMO do. I know a bunch of guys who got together and
said, “We’ve got some neat ideas here,” and started up a company.  I didn’t see them let down on
their academic duties and at least one of them holds a prestigious research chair and is very DEMO
known in his field.
[That there is a problem of maintaining objectivity in research when doing contracts] is probably
truer in the pharmaceuticals field DEMO it is in my field. I’m sure the medical and pharmaceutical types
are subject to a lot of criticism because they are ‘bought by DEMO or whoever.  We get some of that
too.  You know, DEMO I did a project for a company, the nuclear industry would DEMO me of being
bought by the hydro-electric industry. I’m exaggerating a little bit, but the fact is that the best thing
you can do is try to maintain your objectivity, let the chips fall where they may.  We’ve done projects
for lots of large companies and we get criticisms that we’ve been bought off by one or the other, but I
think we can defend every piece of research we’ve ever done DEMO them in the sense that we absolutely
let the chips fall where they may.  We don’t falsify results.  If you do that, you’re going to be found
out.  So you cannot compromise your integrity. You’re subject to criticism, there’s no question about
that.
[The applied side of the sciences is] a great source of interesting problems. James Watt developed DEMO
steam pump and, because they wanted to make these things work DEMO, they started thinking
about pressures and measurements and ultimately we got DEMO just the steam engines but the Second
Law of Thermodynamics.  Gauss, a great mathematician, started looking at applied astronomy;
always looking up at the stars. Think about how much we’ve learned about physics because DEMO
are interested in astronomy.  Applications feed the theory and theory feeds DEMO applications. It seems
to me there’s got to be that interaction.
I argue both for the pure and applied.  I think in a university I’d want that sort of balance.  I often find
myself arguing with advocates of pure research on one hand and their opponents on the DEMO hand
and I have arguments with both of them. [laughs]  We DEMO some sort of middle ground.
176
If you’re doing something that is very technically-oriented, you’re going to attract different
people.  They’re no less bright, but their interests are DEMO different and they want to be doing applied
stuff and they don’t really care about the theory as long as it appears to work, it seems to be good in a
lot of practical cases.  But you can’t advance it unless you know the theory. The better thing DEMO to
have them both in balance. Then you get the cross fertilization.
If you get to be at a point where you’re just a DEMO of the industry then what will happen is you will
gradually be shifted from fundamental research to being a product designer because product design DEMO
the thing that industry wants.  It wants a product you can DEMO  The researcher wants to generate new
information that people can use.  A lot of universities couldn’t even care whether it’s useful.  It’s just
new information.  They’re the two ends of the spectrum.  If industry DEMO it will be up at this
end all the time.  If DEMO university dominates you’re down here all the time.  So our faculty’s DEMO is to
act as an interlocutor between those two things.
I think that university should be doing work, which, if it sees application, it will be five to ten years
down the road.  You’re not aiming at next year or next month. So it’s not the short-term DEMO that you
should be pursuing it. It’s the long term goal. It’s to light the path so that you or other people then can
DEMO the applications in the future. If you’re just doing bread and butter things, you’re not really
learning. You’re not advancing state of the art, there’s no research component to it.  It’s no good just
having DEMO scientific problem. You solve it and then you publish a paper and that’s great. Now you have
to really try and take it to DEMO next step. Is there a way I could modify this technology or develop it a
little bit further such that it can solve a DEMO problem somebody has? And that problem could be a
small problem DEMO large problem. Then you adopt it or change it a little bit further to solve another
problem, then it starts growing.
There isn’t any technology or research output which, if it’s properly identified and properly
understood, couldn’t solve problems which will be a benefit to the society. It doesn’t matter what
technology it is, it could even be in the arts. It could be a person who is helping with speech therapy
DEMO kids. She’s coming up with techniques and those techniques are technology. If it’s properly
understood and properly documented, that technology can be used in a different area to solve another
problem elsewhere. It’s good for the DEMO It’s good that it displaces old technologies and
introduces new technologies and then it also introduces new jobs and so on. So, it’s a good solution
for the society and for the country. People think that DEMO has to be technical, but not
necessarily.
There’s too much focused DEMO, mission-oriented research.  If you make it too narrow I think it’s
going to choke off things because you could specify a certain goal, if that’s all you’re after you may
or may not get to DEMO  And when you get there it may or may not be DEMO important as you thought
before.  But if you have the flexibility DEMO go in the direction and the inclination to apply what you’re
doing then I think having a greater flexibility has a much greater social DEMO in the long run.
177
Job Elements and Job Satisfaction
[The best part about being a DEMO is that] I get to do what the hell I like. I enjoyed the acting part
of teaching and I enjoyed having all these DEMO people around to sort of discuss and argue with and
being able to maintain that.  But just freedom is the thing.  You can’t DEMO that.  You don’t make as
much money; if I had been out in industry, I could have probably made quite a bit more but I was
working with some really neat people. My colleagues are DEMO neat people, a lot of fun.  We had no
idea of what was going to happen when we invested in this company. We DEMO a chance because it
seemed like an interesting thing to do and we had some good ideas and very clever people.  You have
to enjoy what you’re doing.  I can’t say I enjoyed absolutely every minute of it, but damned near.  We
worked hard but we worked DEMO because that’s what we liked to do and that’s nice.
My board of directors advised me that I had to let go the research; had to let somebody else run the
research of the company and DEMO did.  I let it go but I didn’t give up trying DEMO stay with the technology:
going to conferences, understanding it, I’m just not doing hands on research.  Sometimes I miss it, so
DEMO I have to give a talk about technologies, I sit down DEMO I research.  I enjoyed it very much,
you know.
I DEMO like the bureaucracy that goes along with some of the research contracts and projects.  I mean
who does?  Particularly, now that our DEMO become more bureaucratic over time… That’s the
way things are, so DEMO probably spend much more time than I want to on dealing with the financial
services people and so on, keeping track of accounts and stuff like that.  Doing all the paperwork that
goes along with research contracts.  That’s the drudgery of it.  I don’t think I’m unique DEMO that sense.
I don’t think anybody likes that kind of thing.
I think it is a beautiful subject. There’s a certain beauty to the DEMO But it’s very hard to explain to
people who don’t know the field.
[The best part of my research day is] trying to come DEMO with ideas that make sense.  The question I
always have is, “Why?”  I think a lot of people follow the trend.  DEMO quite often don’t do that because I
look at it and I can see problems with it.  For example, in some things, we really haven’t advanced
because the technology is just as complicated as before.  And that’s great for job security, but it seems
to me it’s wrong.  So I’m very much for simplification.
I think it is being my own boss, to a certain level that I get to choose what I want to do.  Not all the
time, not every DEMO, not every hour of every day but generally being able to DEMO my own goals and my
own agenda and my own timetable.  DEMO like the interaction with the students. I like the interaction with
other profs, working with them.  I think that those are the major DEMO
178
I like working on projects with colleagues.  I like the belonging to a lot of organizations. I’m on
committees; I chair different things and so on.  I think the attraction in working with colleagues is that
quite often you’re plowing new ground, in the sense that you’re solving new problems. As applied
scientists that’s what we like doing, you know.  I like the diversity of the projects that I work on too,
rather than working on project after project within one particular DEMO  One of the advantages you
have is when you have a DEMO of experience, is that you have a way of attacking problems.  Even
though you may not know a heck of a lot about DEMO area, you hopefully are smart enough to know
where the pitfalls DEMO, and smart enough to know that somebody else has probably worked DEMO this
problem before.  You find out what has been done, so that you don’t reinvent the wheel.  You know,
it sounds simple, but it’s probably experience that, if anything, teaches you that.
[The best part of doing research] can happen when I should be sleeping DEMO off and on during the day
when I’m into something. My wife is very understanding so if I go into a deep concentration she
DEMO what’s going on. It can happen any time I guess. It’s frustrating [laughs] and very satisfying,
both. I can’t explain why that is DEMO for example you’re lying awake at night when you know you
should be asleep and you’re going through calculations where you’re doing a theory DEMO something.
I’ve always tried to take time to do outside things that I’ve enjoyed apart from my university work
and I sometimes feel I’m DEMO on that, to do research.
In my first year of undergrad, I was taking a course that I really liked.  And I was studying for it in
a library with a whole bunch of other DEMO We all had exams at the same time, starting at one
DEMO and I was there about twelve.  And at two-thirty I looked DEMO and the place was deserted.  I’d
been concentrating so much on DEMO material that I had no idea that anything had happened.
Everybody got up and went. So I had to go and track down the DEMO and he gave me an oral
examination on the spot and, DEMO course, since I was concentrating on this material there wasn’t any
DEMO [laughs] You know I lose myself in things like that.
Theme 5: Career Decisions
This theme includes excerpts related to two aspects of career management: 1) work/personal life
balance; and, 2) mid-career change.
Work/Personal Life Balance
My wife really raised our kids. I didn’t DEMO as much time with the kids. My wife was also a
professional but she decided not to work and then she looked after the DEMO She looked after our life.
We went to the theatre and we went to concerts but I have no idea of where she’d get DEMO tickets. The
kids’ birthday parties and all that, I was there DEMO they happened but I did not set them up. I used to
work during weekends for the university. There are trade offs. If it DEMO for my wife, a smart
woman, I could have never have achieved what I achieved.
179
[The long hours at the university and spin-off didn’t affect my DEMO life] too much because,
fortunately, my wife is very understanding.  Her full-time job is at the house, and when a lot of this
was going on, the children were in high school, so DEMO wasn’t a big problem with having little kids at
home. They were a very supportive family, so it really wasn’t a problem, thank DEMO
It is a big factor. My wife is an unbelievable person. She’s just always been supportive. We’ve tried
to be supportive of each other. DEMO, there were demands. But, the reason I mention this, I DEMO a
colleague involved in another technology transfer. His wife wasn’t that supportive and ultimately it
tore the marriage apart.
I had an understanding family, they’re great. My wife has been so good to me over the DEMO She’s
allowed me to work sixty, seventy hours a week, and kept the operation at home going, and kept our
kids happy and well adjusted and did a terrific job.
Mid-Career Change
I did design DEMO on a consulting basis for different companies. It was very lucrative. I was also
doing consulting through the university and we used to do DEMO some of the consulting through that. So
money was not a consideration, it was not the motivating factor at the university. The motivating
factor was to innovate and that was quite exciting.
I wasn’t sure whether DEMO would be able to continue being able to innovate as I got older. So when I
looked at those who really innovated at a DEMO higher level than I did, they were in their twenties. So
DEMO felt that I would not be able to innovate at the same rate I used to innovate before. I thought that as I
get DEMO my work will become incremental. Therefore, I should try to develop DEMO technology.
I was not interested in consulting because there is no scope for leverage. If you trust your
technology to a company then you DEMO have it multiply and create more technology and more jobs
and so on. You can’t see the results. At my start-up, you can see it.
I enjoyed being a prof. I like teaching, I enjoy undergraduate courses, I liked being able to do my own
research and decide what I wanted to do and so forth.  I enjoyed being a professor, I was just there too
long. It would be very nice if after twenty-five years, you could automatically look at going into
another, another job but the way the pension plan worked at The University of Waterloo, you were
locked in.  They tell you when you’re DEMO to retire and you really don’t have any choice.  I would
DEMO left earlier if I could have taken my money out of the pension plan. I just felt I needed to do
something else.  The way the situation works now they really have you tied up to DEMO sixty-five.  If
you could go between fifty and fifty-five, then during the time you were a professor you could, you
could plan your life and say, “Okay, at age fifty or age fifty-two or DEMO, I’m going to start a
company and try and commercialize the DEMO I’ve developed in the lab, or I’m going go and
work DEMO NRC, or whatever.  But they won’t allow that. You’re stuck there until they let you go.  The
early retirement penalty at the University of Waterloo is so large that you really can’t consider
180
leaving more than five years early, at age sixty, and DEMO already too late for a second career.  I
feel very strongly DEMO they should allow people to leave at, say, age fifty so they still have time for
another career.  But that’s not the way it is.
[I started the spin-off] because it’s fun.  It’s exciting and I really enjoy it.  It’s a real challenge and
it’s different as well.  One of the problems of being a university professor is there’s two possibilities:
you can be a university professor and after about DEMO years you’ve done everything that you can
do as a university professor and then you can become Dean or you can become Chairman or DEMO can
get involved in University administration in some way. That’s a common thing to do but I was on the
back end of a DEMO bulge.  Most of the administrative positions of the university were not DEMO to me
because there were a lot of people in that bulge right ahead of me. I saw my opportunities would lie in
companies DEMO I liked that.
[I enjoy technology transfer because] it’s a challenge. The main thing is the challenge.  The other
thing I liked about it is: imagine the stupidity of it, if I had spent all DEMO years working at the
University of Waterloo on this technology and had not started the company.  All of the value, the
commercial value DEMO the research would have just been lost because nobody else would have done
anything.  It’s not the kind of thing that you can license because there’s nobody out there who wants
to license it. I felt DEMO, if I could use it and develop real products and have DEMO effect on science by
developing those things, it would be great DEMO to do and I wanted to see it done.  Otherwise you DEMO
your papers and the papers get published in journals and five or six people read the paper. Then the
paper is there, forever stuck between the pages of that journal, and it doesn’t mean anything.  DEMO a
large extent, I felt that it was a way that DEMO could make the results of my research a lot more
meaningful and useful, and I could generate some jobs for people.  I find DEMO a hell of a lot more fun
than just going and teaching classes every day.  Teaching classes was great for the first twenty years
but after you’ve done it for twenty years it gets pretty boring.  I can’t imagine how people could stay
and just keep doing the DEMO thing over and over and over for all those years.  It DEMO drive me nuts.
