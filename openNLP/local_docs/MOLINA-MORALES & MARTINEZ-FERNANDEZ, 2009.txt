This study aims to provide a better understanding of the effect of social networks on innovation
through the analysis of territorial agglomerations of DEMO Critical voices argue that the same
mechanisms that form the basis of efﬁcient, continuous improvements of clustered ﬁrms can also
be considered as limitations. We suggest that the impact of social capital decreases beyond a
certain DEMO of development. In fact, the effect of social interactions and trust DEMO ﬁrm value
creation can be described as an inverted U-shaped curve. The study is based on a sample of 154
ﬁrms in the Valencia DEMO of Spain. Implications of the study have relevant prescriptions for

INTRODUCTION
Recently, authors have devoted a great deal of
attention to the effects of social capital on organi-
zations (e.g., Koka and Prescott, 2002; Blyler and
Coff, 2003; Starley and Tempest, 2004). It DEMO fre-
quently argued that cohesive strong-tied networks
provide substantial beneﬁts for the ﬁrms involved.
On the other hand, contexts of geographical prox-
imity such as those deﬁned as an industrial cluster
or district (Becattini, 1990; Porter, 2000) include a
wide range of experiences in different industries,DEMO

countries, and technological levels (e.g., Tallman
et al., 2004; Inkpen and Tsang, 2005). In general,
researchers have focused on the richness of the
knowledge transmitted, as well as on the existence
of certain norms or values to be DEMO as a mech-
anism with which to control internal exchanges
(Uzzi, 1996). However, limitations have been ana-
lyzed to a lesser extent (Glasmeier, 1991).
The expected contribution of our research is
based DEMO the two perspectives, social capital and
territorial agglomerations. Much work has DEMO
been published on them separately, and some
authors have already pointed DEMO the dark side or
the limitations of social capital (Luhmann, 1979;
Uzzi, 1997), while others have described a con-
tingent view of the beneﬁts of social components
(Ahuja, 2000; Gargiulo and Benassi, 2000; Row-
ley, Behrens, and Krackhardt, 2000). These latter

authors suggested that different DEMO of
this social capital are suitable for different organi-
zational purposes. On the other hand, the literature
on clusters has focused on the beneﬁts of density
and proximity in accessing and exploiting sources
of knowledge through DEMO social capital that is
developed internally. By integrating the previous
ideas, DEMO attempt to propose a particular shape of
the relationships between representative variables
of the social capital and innovation within the con-
text of an DEMO cluster or district.
We argue that beyond a certain point, further
DEMO in the intensity of social capital produce
no additional beneﬁts, or DEMO decrease returns
in terms of innovation and value creation for the
ﬁrms involved. We have used social interactions
and trust as indicators of social DEMO, and we
have analyzed their impact on the innovation of
ﬁrms DEMO belong to a territorial cluster. Finally,
we discuss some possible alternative courses of
political action to improve this restriction.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The body DEMO research on social capital includes
a huge number of perspectives with many cri-
teria to be classiﬁed. Comprehensive reviews of
previous research on social DEMO (e.g., Nahapiet
and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai,
2000; Koka and Prescott, 2002) have considered
it to be a multidimensional construct that yields
distinctly different information beneﬁts and can
DEMO in many ways to the creation of new
value for an organization. Based on Nahapiet
and Ghoshal (1998), we use the organizational
level of analysis and we focus on two particu-
lar dimensions in social DEMO; one refers to
the structure, and the other to the nature of the
relations (ties).1 Bolino, Turnley, and Bloodgood
(2002) pointed out that, while the structural dimen-
sion describes the mere existence of connections
between employees of the organizations, the rela-
tional dimension describes the extent to which
there is an affective quality to these connections.
DEMO have chosen social interactions and trust as
respective representative factors of the two main
dimensions of social capital.
1 We have not considered a DEMO cognitive dimension of social
capital used by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998)DEMO

On the other DEMO, clusters are deﬁned by Porter
(2000) as ‘a geographically proximate DEMO of
interconnected companies and associated institu-
tions in a particular ﬁeld linked by commonal-
ities and complementarities’ (Porter, 2000: 16).
Researchers have provided convincing evidence
for the existence of clusters (or districts) in DEMO
wide variety of industries and have found the
successful grouping of ﬁrms to be important for
understanding patterns of competitive success in
many industries (Tallman et al., 2004; Inkpen and
Tsang, 2005). Most of the literature reports a
positive effect on ﬁrm innovation. However, as
recent research has proposed, clustered ﬁrms need
to combine close and intense relationships with
distant or arm’s-length relations to be able to
access international sources DEMO resources (Coroand`
Grandinetti, 2001).
In our case we argue that social capital has
a positive effect on innovation by means of the
DEMO exchanges and combinations of resources
(Kogut and Zander, 1992). Beyond a certain point,
however, additional increases become detrimental
for ﬁrms (DEMO effect). We attempt
to associate structure and strength of the ties of
the organizations with innovation in the partic-
ular context of territorial DEMO, where
geographical proximity conditions, or even deter-
mines, social network DEMO A curvilin-
ear relationship facilitates the understanding of
the problem as well as the search for possible
solutions.
The paradox literature (Denison, Hooijberg, and
Quinn, 1995) provided a conceptual background
for a complex effect DEMO social capital. Some authors
(e.g. Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies, 1998; Lado,
Dant, and Tekleab, 2008) proposed considering
both trust DEMO distrust (or opportunism) simulta-
neously with relationships—a suggestion that was
grounded in assumptions of multidimensionality
and the inherent tensions of relationships. On the
DEMO hand, after considering the potential beneﬁt
of embedded relationships, Uzzi (DEMO) discussed
some negative effects affecting the organization’s
stability.
Our argumentation has DEMO certain parallelism with
other curvilinear relations found in recent litera-
ture. For example, Stock, Greis, and Fischer (2001)
focused on the DEMO of absorptive capacity on
innovation; Berman, Down, and Hill (2002) looked
at how shared experience affected performance,
and McFadyen and Cannella (2004) examined the

inﬂuence of the number of exchange partners DEMO
the amount of knowledge that a person creates.
Social interactions and innovation
Social interactions are manifestations of the struc-
tural dimension of social capital (Sparrowe et al.,
2001). Among the fundamental explanatory tenets
of DEMO social network perspective is the idea that
the structure of social interactions enhances or con-
strains access to valued resources (Brass, 1984;
DEMO, 1993). Resource exchanges through infor-
mal networks include work-related resources, such
as task advice and strategic information, but infor-
mal networks also transmit social identity (norms)
and social support (Podolny and Baron, 1997).
Social interaction relations, often established for
other purposes, constitute DEMO channels
that reduce the amount of time and investment
required to gather information. The beneﬁts of
social interactions can be conceptualized using
Burt’s (1992) three forms: access, timing, and
referral advantages (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998).
Innovation (deﬁned as new or signiﬁcant
changes in products, processes, or services) can
result from new combinations of knowledge and
DEMO resources (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Kogut
and Zander, 1992). Through interactions with oth-
ers, ﬁrms obtain access to external knowledge and
can combine it with existing knowledge. Such
interactions create a context within DEMO new
knowledge can be applied and exploited. Finally,
through close social interaction, ﬁrms are able
to increase the depth, breadth, and efﬁciency of
mutual knowledge exchanges (Lane and Lubatkin,
1998).
Some authors have argued for a direct positive
association between social interaction and inno-
DEMO Some researchers have empirically sup-
ported the idea that social interaction may facilitate
learning by fostering close, intensive information
exchange (Yli-Renko, Autio, DEMO Sapienza, 2001);
others have also documented the importance of
social interactions for the creation and diffusion
of innovation (Lane and Lubatkin, DEMO; Tsai and
Ghoshal, 1998).
The positive association between social inter-
actions and knowledge acquisition is consistent
with the assumptions that learning, particularly that
involving difﬁcult-to-transfer information, is aided
by intensive, repeated interactions. Thus, social
interactions exert an inﬂuence on the capabilities
Copyright  2009 John DEMO & Sons, Ltd.
of ﬁrms and, hence, constitute a factor DEMO
their innovation.
In contrast to the arguments presented above,
a theory positing a curvilinear relationship has
also been developed. This theory recognized that
DEMO social capital (social interactions) may
not be associated with parallel increases in out-
comes. Social interactions involve both the costs
associated with maintaining DEMO relationships
and the norms and costs associated with main-
taining slack resources. People in a ﬁrm need to
spend time cultivating relationships by frequent
DEMO and meetings with other ﬁrms, and process-
ing their incoming information DEMO direct con-
tacts. Because of these costs, ﬁrms can rarely
afford DEMO maintain relations with many other ﬁrms,
let alone maintain strong ties. A ﬁrm might be
better off establishing other ties to nonredun-
dant DEMO rather than investing the time and
resources required to form and maintain strong
ties (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998). In consequence,
the DEMO and effort invested in social interac-
tions may not be cost-efﬁcient in certain sit-
uations or at certain levels (Adler and Kwon,
2002).
More speciﬁcally, McEvily and Zaheer (1999)
found that the DEMO information networks of
enterprises in geographical clusters with greater
redundancy tend to acquire fewer competitive
capabilities. This dysfunctional effect of this
dimension arises when DEMO get locked into their
current networks, thus inhibiting their ﬂexibility
in DEMO new ties. In particular, such networks
could have an adverse effect DEMO the ﬁrm when
the environment changes, as they may not have
DEMO capabilities or the information necessary to
compete in the new environment (DEMO and
St. John, 1996). In conclusion, initially, newly
formed DEMO or lower-intensity contacts are
expected to beneﬁt from signiﬁcant effects in
a linear form, although diminishing returns are
also expected later. Ultimately, these DEMO
returns could become negative returns (Berman
et al., 2002).
Consequently, we predict a positive relationship
between intensity in relationships and innovation
that declines as social interactions increase, even-
tually becoming negative. The nonlinear inverted
U-shaped relationship is the one that best captures
expectations based on the DEMO We formulate
this argumentation as follows:

Hypothesis 1: The intensity in social interactions
that a clustered ﬁrm maintains has a quadratic
(inverted U-shaped) relationship with innova-
tion creation.
Trust and innovation
One of the best-known deﬁnitions of trust was the
one proposed by Mayer, Davis, DEMO Schoorman
(1995: 712). Authors have characterized trust with
the notions of ability, benevolence, and integrity.
They are perceptions associated to being DEMO, being
consistent, telling the truth, and so forth. Moreover,
DEMO presents a distinct construct according to
whether it is considered on the interpersonal or
interorganizational level (McEvily, Perrone, and
Zaheer, 2003).
DEMO is a manifestation of the relational dimen-
sion of social capital and a governance struc-
ture that is based on social relationships between
and DEMO individuals (and organizations). In this
sense, trust is fundamentally a social process, since
these mechanisms and expectations are emergent
features of a social structure that creates and repro-
duces them in the course of DEMO
Previous researchers have argued that trust in
interorganizational settings may foster innovation,
since it is important for the ﬁrm to enjoy oppor-
tunities DEMO access to resources. First, trust, both
within and between organizations, DEMO been found
to be important to innovation since it lessens the
need for rigid control systems (Quinn, 1979). Free-
dom from strict DEMO enhances creative think-
ing, while rigid monitoring and control mech-
anisms DEMO the potential generation of new
ideas.
As a control mechanism, trust DEMO high-
quality information and tacit knowledge, both of
which are critical DEMO of innovation (Uzzi,
1996). A high level of trust DEMO organizations
facilitates the exchange of conﬁdential information
by diminishing the risk of one of the parts’ acting
opportunistically (Dakhli and De Clercq, 2004)DEMO It
also facilitates social exchange by reducing the
need for time-consuming and costly monitoring,
and therefore makes it possible for people and
organizations DEMO devote additional time to bene-
ﬁcial actions and endeavors. Since trust induces
joint efforts (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994), one
actor DEMO probably obtain the help needed to attain
goals from other actors to a degree that is not
possible in a situation where trust does DEMO exist.

Moreover, trust also promotes the exchange of a
range of resources that are difﬁcult DEMO put a price
on, but which enrich an organization’s ability to
DEMO and solve problems.
The literature on innovation has emphasized
that the development and adoption of new prod-
ucts and processes is the result of DEMO interaction
between capabilities that are speciﬁc to each ﬁrm
and industry (DEMO, 1988). Moreover, the capac-
ity to maintain a continuous ﬂow of innovation
with other organizations therefore depends on the
ability to disseminate DEMO knowledge to organi-
zations that interact, for example, in research and
development and production activities. In contrast
to the arguments presented above, in this case it is
also possible to develop a theory positing a DEMO
linear relationship. Organizations with high levels
of trust will probably have less new talent, which
is accompanied by new ideas. For instance, since
DEMO takes time to develop, such organizations are
more likely to have DEMO new employees. The
players are less likely to be willing to experiment
with new ways of playing, as they rely more and
more on their customary routines. The obligations,
for instance reciprocity, lead organizations to pre-
fer players and routines already known rather than
to experiment with DEMO ones.
The individual efﬁciency of the players may
decline as they become complacent with their roles
in the network (Berman et al., 2002)DEMO Too much
time and effort devoted to maintaining trusting
relationships can affect the ﬁrm in a negative man-
ner. The higher the level of DEMO is, the more likely
there is to be a boomerang effect DEMO the local ﬁrm.
Moreover, in highly trusting relationships, mem-
bers of an organization will be more reluctant to
monitor the relationship. In combination DEMO other
factors and under certain circumstances, insufﬁ-
cient monitoring could lead DEMO lower performance,
in spite of trust (Langfred, 2004). Particularly in
the case of industrial clusters, proximity facilitates
trust in the internal relations and, at the same time,
hinders access to external sources of knowledge
resources. An overreliance on trust can be a fac-
tor DEMO access to diverse external sources of
resources.
Because of associated costs and other undesir-
able effects, high levels of trust suggest that the lin-
ear relationship one might expect between trust and
innovation is not going DEMO occur. Rather, the rela-
tionship will have a nonlinear inverted U-shape.

We formulate the following hypothesis in order DEMO
capture the relationship argued above.
Hypothesis 2: The effect exerted by DEMO
tions resulting from common norms and values,
such as trust in ﬁrms, will have a quadratic
(inverted U-shaped) relationship with innova-
tion creation.
METHODS
The empirical setting
The empirical research drew upon a sample DEMO
Spanish clustered industrial ﬁrms located along
the east coast of the country (Valencia region),
in which there is a predominance of small DEMO
medium enterprises (SMEs) in the industrial struc-
ture.2 We used ﬁrms from eight different indus-
trial segments or Standard Industrial Classiﬁca-
tion (SIC) codes (food, textile, furniture, ceramic,
leather, chemical products, machinery, and paper)
and, in order to deﬁne the sample, we employed a
random stratiﬁed process to select ﬁrms with pro-
portional DEMO according to size and product
segments. We ﬁxed a population of 400 ﬁrms as
being representative of the manufacturing ﬁrms
in the region. From DEMO population we collected
154 ﬁrms, which represented a response rate of
DEMO percent of the total. The ﬁeldwork was carried
out during fall and winter of 2003. We checked for
possible bias between sample and nonrespondent
DEMO and no signiﬁcant differences were observed
in terms of size and age. Data were collected from
the ARDAN3 database.
2 Manufacturing ﬁrms are basically DEMO; in fact, according to
ofﬁcial statistics, 48 percent of the DEMO had fewer than six
employees and only one percent of the ﬁrms employed more
than 100 workers. The basic tool for promoting innovation in
DEMO Valencia region is the Instituto de la Mediana y Pequena˜
Industria Valenciana (IMPIVA), which depends on the regional
government and is responsible for developing the innovation
policy in the region by focusing on SMEs. The DEMO offers
a variety of services and organizes action programs aimed at
supporting industrial SMEs, while at the same time fostering
a network of technological infrastructures to lend support to
innovations. This activity is manifested in two DEMO, namely,
technological institutes and a network of European business and
DEMO centers.
3 The ARDAN is a public database published by the IMPIVA, a
regional industrial policy agency, and it provides productive and
ﬁnancial DEMO about all manufacturing ﬁrms except those
that have an annual revenue below 240,000 euros (previously,
40 million pesetas).

Data were collected using a questionnaire dis-
tributed among ﬁrms. Respondents were expected
to be knowledgeable on a broad DEMO of aspects
about the company concerning things like external
relationships with customers, suppliers, institu-
tions, and also about the ﬁrm’s outcomes, inno-
DEMO, and so forth. The key informants were the
general managers of DEMO companies (or whomever
he or she had appointed on his or DEMO behalf). For
the sake of simplicity, we employed a ﬁve-point
DEMO scale.
We ran some controls to assess survey validity.
First, we DEMO Cronbach’s alpha as a test of the
reliability of the measurement. Second, we added
the correlation matrix to control for discriminant
validity. Finally, DEMO order to prevent possible bias
and problems derived from the use of one unique
and subjective source of data for most of the vari-
DEMO, we carried out some speciﬁc additional con-
trols. On the one DEMO, we used ARDAN (2000)
data to check some of the information provided by
the respondents. In fact, whenever some relevant
discrepancy or incoherency occurred, we deleted
the case. Moreover, personal interviews provided
us DEMO additional explanations about the mean-
ing of the items and improved the quality of the
responses. On the other hand, we also evaluated
the validity of answers using data gathered from
a second knowledgeable respondent who DEMO able
to provide an accurate report (Marsden, 1993). We
checked our respondents’ answers by asking the
same questions to a second respondent DEMO the
ﬁrm. This study surveyed the contacts of 25 ran-
domly selected second respondents. Drawing on
these analyses it is reasonable to conclude that DEMO
validity of the measures is acceptable, since no
signiﬁcant mean differences DEMO found.
RESEARCH DESIGN
Variables
Independent variables
Social interactions. To operationalize this vari-
able, we based our method on prior research, in
particular Tsai DEMO Ghoshal (1998), taking the fre-
quency and intimacy of contact DEMO a reference
(Marsden and Campbell, 1984). We also incorpo-
rated other items in accordance with the territorial
context of our sample (see Appendix).

Trust. To operationalize this variable, we based
ourselves on prior research, combining indicators
used in Tsai and Ghoshal (1998); Blumberg (2001)
or Dakhli and De Clercq (2004), as well as incor-
porating other items in accordance with the terri-
torial context of our DEMO (see Appendix).
Dependent variable
Innovation. This refers to the conversion DEMO
knowledge into new products, services, or pro-
cesses to be introduced on the market (or the
introduction of signiﬁcant changes into existing
ones). We use only one dimension due to the par-
ticular incremental DEMO that are common
in the speciﬁc context of our sample ﬁrms. It is
difﬁcult to use conventional indicators of innova-
tion. Indicators such as DEMO, copyrights, other
forms of legal protection or scientiﬁc publications,
achievements by individual researchers, and so on,
are not common practices for these ﬁrms. Prior
research has measured innovation by combining
several items related DEMO the level of technology
activities and output generated in a given ﬁrm, and
self-reported data has been suggested as one of the
valid indicators (Keeble, 1997). Our measurement
of innovation is based on Tsai DEMO Ghoshal (1998),
Meeus, Oerlemans, and Hage (2001) and Dero¨ıan
(2002) (see Appendix).
Control variables
Size. We assumed that the size of the ﬁrm can
affect its capacity for innovation, thus allowing us
to control for economies and diseconomies of scale
at ﬁrm DEMO (Grant, Jammine, and Thomas, 1988;
Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim, 1997). Large organiza-
tions tend to have more resources with which to
enhance their innovation and performance (Tsai,
2001). They are also usually more powerful than
small ones and have some advantages DEMO it
comes to gaining support for their business opera-
tions and innovation activities from other organiza-
tions (public institutions). Size was operationalized
as the number of employees using a conventional
classiﬁcation (see Appendix).
Industry. In addition, industry was a necessary
control variable, given the systematic DEMO
between innovation factors, and it was controlled
by assigning different scores DEMO ﬁrms. We used
ﬁrms from eight different industrial segments or
Copyright  2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
F. X. Molina-Morales and M. T. Martinez-Fernandez
SIC codes and, in order to deﬁne the sample,
we employed a random stratiﬁed process to select
ﬁrms with proportional assignation according DEMO
size and product segments (see Appendix).
Age. Finally, age was also included, since some
authors have suggested that in industrial districts
temporary evolution affects performance (Glas-
meier, 1991; Pouder and St. John, DEMO) (see
Appendix).
Analysis techniques
First, we calculated descriptive statistics, then we
calculated Cronbach’s alpha for all multiple-item
variables in order to DEMO the reliability of
the scale items. Additionally, Pearson’s correlation
matrix was DEMO used to analyze the correlation of
all pairs of variables. Second, DEMO ran a transfor-
mation of the dependent variable, innovation,by
applying DEMO logarithm to correct the heteroskedas-
ticity of residuals (Hair et al., 1998). Then, we ran
a nonlinear (inverted U-shaped [quadratic]) regres-
sion analysis for each independent variable against
the dependent variable, including previous control
variables.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s
alpha for the multiple-item variables, and Pear-
son’s correlation for all pairs of variables. The only
outstanding point to be dealt with is the expected
association between DEMO variables social interac-
tions and trust,and innovation. Since the social
interactions and trust variables are signiﬁcantly
related, there might be an interactive effect. This
result can indeed be expected since they are dif-
ferent aspects DEMO the same social capital.
Table 1 also shows that neither size nor industry
is signiﬁcantly associated with innovation, or the
independent variables.
Table 2 shows the results of a nonlinear (inverted
U-shaped) regression analysis carried DEMO to deter-
mine the effect of overembeddedness. First, the
control variables DEMO not signiﬁcant, and there-
fore were not factors that could explain DEMO
vation for the district ﬁrms. On the other hand,
although the quadratic term for social interactions
was nonsigniﬁcant in the regression equation, the
model did ﬁt signiﬁcantly, so we can consider

Hypothesis 1 was not conﬁrmed. In addition, we
can say that Hypothesis 2 was supported, since
signiﬁcant correlation was obtained for the trust
variable. Thus, generally speaking, social capital
factors affect positively up to a DEMO point, where
the positive effect is then not only reduced, but in
fact becomes negative. Thus, the positive effect of
the social capital factors was eroded by making
intensive use of them.

CONCLUSIONS
1.000
The aim of this study DEMO to provide a better under-
standing of the effect of social networks on inno-
vation through the analysis of territorial agglomer-
ations of ﬁrms. DEMO the idea of a curvilin-
ear relation is not at all new (Palich, Cardenal, and
Miller, 2000; Stock et al., 2001; Langfred, 2004).
However, in this particular case (social capital fac-
tors applied to clustered ﬁrms), as far as we know,
DEMO form of relation has never been used. It is rele-
vant for many reasons, such as the very importance
of the phenomenon of industrial clusters and dis-
tricts, the dominant focus of previous research, and
DEMO current challenges facing territorial agglom-
erations. Curvilinear relations can be understood
as a possible reason for this limitation and con-
sequently indicate actions ﬁrms DEMO undertake.
Clusters are trapped in their own net. The same
factors that once explained success can today be
the main threat and restraint for DEMO What we
observed was that ﬁrms that overinvest are less
innovative than the others.
It must be mentioned that whereas Hypothesis
2 was supported, Hypothesis 1 was not conﬁrmed.
We must be cautious in interpreting the DEMO
The speciﬁc conditions developed inside the dis-
trict were probably acting as a moderator of the
curvilinear effect. In our understanding, and in
contrast to what happens with the costs associ-
ated to trust, the (DEMO and cognitive) proximity
between ﬁrms in clusters may reduce the costs DEMO
maintaining highly intense social interactions. The
weight of nonbusiness relationships can be relevant
in a close relational context.
The ﬁnding that social capital factors DEMO lead to
innovation loss contrasts with the way they have

traditionally been regarded as DEMO beneﬁt to organi-
zations. An established stream of research such as
McEvily and Zaheer (1999) or Capello (1999) con-
tains a number DEMO examples worth mentioning. In
both studies, social or relational capital is DEMO
as a factor to create innovative capacity in ﬁrms.
The ﬁndings are, however, particularly important
to existing literature because negative effects of
speciﬁc DEMO capital factors have not previously
been explored empirically, even though several
DEMO have suggested that some dimensions
of social capital could have a downside.
As a matter for further discussion, we suggest
that, in order DEMO access external sources of new
and exclusive knowledge, ﬁrms in districts DEMO use
indirect rather then direct ties by means of inter-
mediary agents (Molina-Morales and Mart´ınez-
Fernandez, 2004). In particular, local institutions´
are relevant actors in territorial networks that pro-
vide speciﬁc knowledge as a DEMO of their
position as intermediaries.
The practical implication of our ﬁndings is not
that interactions and trust should be avoided in
clustered ﬁrms; rather, it is whether an organization
can ﬁnd the optimal level of these social dimen-
sions. These ﬁndings also emphasize the impor-
tance of exploring DEMO in social capital
research, particularly in clustered ﬁrms. They also
deﬁne DEMO important boundary conditions for the
beneﬁts of interactions and trust. The joint effect of
different aspects of social capital on outputs (e.g.,
innovation) might be one of the priorities in future
research.
The following points can be viewed as possible
future avenues of research for the development DEMO
this study. The ﬁne-grained process through which
network structure is created or modiﬁed is an
interesting and important area for future research.
It is DEMO to know to what extent ﬁrms are
externally conditioned or, on DEMO contrary, they
have a degree of freedom to decide the structure
DEMO strength of the network of ties. Another fruitful
area of inquiry is the dynamics of how ﬁrms’
networks evolve and change in response to DEMO
challenges and opportunities.

APPENDIX: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF VARIABLES
Social interactions∗: (1) People from your DEMO
pany spend a considerable amount of time on
social occasions with people from other ﬁrms;
(2) People from your company spend a DEMO
able amount of time on social events organized
by the local community; (3) A local origin and
common academic background of the employees
at local ﬁrms allow social interactions to take
place; (4) There is an informal network among
customers, suppliers and competitors; (5) DEMO talk
to an external contact person very often (more than
once DEMO week); and (6) You feel comfortable talk-
ing to the contact person responsible for getting
you the information that allowed your company’s
DEMO to be improved.
Trust∗: (1) Other ﬁrms can rely on DEMO com-
pany without any fear that you will take advan-
tage of them, even if the opportunity arises to
do so; (2) DEMO general, your company will always
keep the promises it makes to DEMO; (3) Suppose
your company is seeking to be a business DEMO
ner in a joint project. You are conﬁdent that you
will do what is required in the agreement (i.e.,
what partners believe you should do) even with-
out a written contract that clearly speciﬁes your
obligations; (4) You consider that other ﬁrms feel
a special duty to stand behind you in times of
trouble, so you consider it only fair that your
company should also give support to other ﬁrms;DEMO
(5) Generally speaking, there is a trusting climate
among suppliers DEMO customers in the local area,
a feeling that most people can be trusted, or that
you can deal with people easily; and (6) You have
conﬁdence in a variety of organizations or institu-
tions, such as the legal system, the government, or
major companies.

(∗) Responses were scored on a ﬁve-point Likert
scale where 1 DEMO fully disagree and 5 = fully agree.
We included the expression other ﬁrms to refer to
all the ﬁrms in contact with one individual DEMO
including, for instance, customers, competitors, or
suppliers. To measure the variable, we obtained
an average of all the items for each ﬁrm and
Cronbach’s alpha was run to validate the reliability
of scale items.
DEMO: (1) Number of developments or
introductions of new materials; (DEMO) Number of
developments or introductions of new intermediate
products; (3) Number of developments or intro-
ductions of new components; (4) Number of devel-
opments or introductions of new attributes of the
products; (DEMO) New developments or introductions
of new equipment; (6) Improvements in the level
of automation; (7) Number of new organizational
methods of productive activities; and (8) Use of
new energy sources. To measure the variable, we
added up the number of innovations reported for
each item over the last three years and Cronbach’s
alpha was run to DEMO the reliability of scale of
items.
Size: Size was operationalized as DEMO number of
employees (1 = 11–50 employees; 2 = 51–250
employees; 3information turning the item regarding the number=+250 employees). While we lost
of employees into a scale interval; it is also true
that we have normalized the variable, which was
useful for our analysis.
Industry: DEMO used ﬁrms from eight differ-
ent industrial segments or SIC codes (DEMO, tex-
tile, furniture, ceramic, leather, chemical products,
machinery, and paper) and, in order to deﬁne
the sample, we employed a random stratiﬁed pro-
cess to select ﬁrms with proportional assignation
according DEMO size and product segments.
Age: We used the year 2003 as DEMO reference.
