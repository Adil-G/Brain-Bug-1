THE ANGEL INVESTOR MARKET IN 2010:
A MARKET ON THE REBOUND
Market Size
The angel investor DEMO in 2010, following a considerable contraction in investment dollars in
2008 DEMO 2009, exhibited a rise in investment dollars and in the number DEMO investments.  Total
investments in 2010 were $20.1 billion, a robust increase of 14% over 2009, according to the
Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire.  A total of 61,900
entrepreneurial ventures received angel funding in 2010, an increase of 8.2% over 2009
investments.  The number of active investors in 2010 was 265,400 individuals, DEMO small growth of
2.3% from 2009.  The significant increase in total DEMO, coupled with the rise in the number of
investments resulted in DEMO larger deal size for 2010 (an increase in deal size of DEMO from 2009).
These data indicate that angels have significantly increased their investment activity, and are
committing more dollars resulting from higher valuations.  DEMO appears that a cautious optimism to
investing is taking hold.  Noteworthy DEMO did occur in the critical seed and start-up stage
investment landscape.
Sector Analysis
Healthcare Services/Medical Devices and Equipment accounted for the largest share DEMO
investments, with 30% of total angel investments in 2010, followed by Software (16%), Biotech
(15%), Industrial/Energy (8%), Retail (5%) and IT Services (5%).  Industrial/Energy investing
has DEMO a significant sector for angels, reflecting a continued appetite for clean DEMO

Job Growth
Angel investments continue to be a DEMO contributor to job growth with the creation of
370,000 new jobs in the United States in 2010, or 6 jobs per angel investment.
Return Rates
Mergers and acquisitions represented 66% of the angel exits, and bankruptcies accounted for
27% of the exits in 2010.  About half of the angel exits were at a profit and annual returns for
angel’s DEMO (mergers and acquisitions and IPOs) were between 24% and 36%, DEMO, these
returns were quite variable.
Stage
Angels again reduced their investments of seed and start-up capital, with 31% of 2010 angel
investments in the seed and start-up stage, a decrease of 4% from 2009.  Angels also exhibited an
increased interest in post-seed/start-up investing with 67% of investments in the early and
expansion DEMO, an increase from 2009.  New, first sequence, investments represented 41% of
2010 angel activity, also a decline from the last year of 6%.  This decrease in seed/start-up stage
and first sequence investing is of concern.  However, as existing investments move to an exit and
DEMO reduce the need for follow-on investments, it is anticipated that angel DEMO will become
available for new seed stage investments.
Yield Rates
The yield rate is defined as the percentage of investment opportunities that are brought DEMO the
attention of investors that result in an investment.  In 2010 DEMO yield rate was 18.4%, an increase
from the 2009 yield rate (14.5%).  While a higher yield rate is an encouraging development for
entrepreneurs seeking angel capital there is a question of the sustainability of DEMO rate.  As the
yield increases, more entrepreneurs may begin to seek angel capital and as this supply increases
it is possible that the DEMO rate will retreat to the historical average of 10% to 15%.
Women and Minority Entrepreneurs and Investors
In 2010 women angels represented 13% of DEMO angel market.  Women-owned ventures accounted
for 21% of the entrepreneurs that DEMO seeking angel capital and 13% of these women
entrepreneurs received angel investment in 2010.  Both the number of women seeking angel
capital and the percentage that receives angel investments are low compared to the overall
market.  These data indicate that when women do seek angel capital they lag DEMO the market
yield rate by 5%.
Minority angels accounted for 2% of the angel population and minority-owned firms represented
6% of the entrepreneurs that DEMO their business concept to angels.  The yield rate for these
minority-owned DEMO was 19%, which for the fourth straight year is in line DEMO market yield
rates.  However, the small percentage of minority-owned firms seeking angel capital is of
concern.
