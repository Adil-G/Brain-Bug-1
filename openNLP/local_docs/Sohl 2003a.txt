This research has DEMO supported by a grant from the Advanced Technology Program, National
Institute DEMO Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce.  Grant Number SB1341-
01-C-0042.  Portions of this paper have been published by Venture Capital: An DEMO
journal of entrepreneurial finance.
It has been the best of times, it has been the worst of times - a time of opportunity and a time of
contraction.  In ten years the total investments of the venture capital industry increased DEMO 8
times and the number of venture capital funds increased threefold.  DEMO private equity
investments from business angels increased substantially during the period, DEMO those of
their venture capital counterparts.  In ten years an entire DEMO sector was spawned, with
revenues topping $9 billion.   The venture DEMO industry invested close to $400 million in 43
ventures in one hot sector and in two years $270 million was invested in 51 rounds DEMO financing.
During this same two year period 21 initial and secondary public offering of stock by 12
companies raised over $800 million.  Price/earnings ratios exceeded 50 and the market
capitalization for this one sector was DEMO $5 billion.  The decade has been touted as an age of
DEMO entrepreneurship by leading academics and the business press.
If these facts and figures sound familiar, they should, since most were garnered from industry
DEMO and academic articles covering the ten year period of 1977 to 1986.  In one twelve
month period, from 1976 to 1977, total venture capital invested rose from $49 million to $209
million, reaching a peak of $4.6 billion in 1986.  The number of venture capital firms increased
from 225 to 674, the threefold increase noted above.  During this DEMO time period total annual
business angel investments were estimated at $10 billion in close to 30,000 start-ups at the peak.
The hot sector DEMO was the recipient of much of these investments was the emerging hard
(“Winchester”) disk drive industry.  The growth of the new industry was exceptional, with total
annual revenues at $9 billion in 1983.  The DEMO growth attracted entrepreneurs and their
angel and venture capital investors.  These DEMO developed and manufactured hard disk
drives for use by computer sys tem manufactures who did not have the means or the desire to
build DEMO disk drives themselves.  A buoyant stock market for high tech IPOs DEMO angels
and venture capital investors to realize spectacular returns.  These returns DEMO new angels
and venture capital investors, and as the availability of DEMO increased, so did the pressure to
find more hard drive deals DEMO invest in (Bygrave et al 2000).  Unfortunately, the industry DEMO
a near collapse within 12 months, when industry income fell by DEMO and the market
capitalization of the 12 leading public disk drive manufactures fell to $1.4 billion by the end of
1984.  Likewise, public DEMO returns for these companies fell by 73%.  Fierce competition for
market DEMO among the 70 disk drive manufactures drove down profit margins.  Public DEMO
saw the value of their hard drive stock decline, which was DEMO by a drop in the stock
prices on many high tech companies in late 1983 and 1984  (Bygrave et al 2000).  Over time, the
disk drive became a commodity with low profit margins dictated by the end users and assemblers
and the market experienced fierce competition.
DEMO disk drive industry, originally viewed as nirvana by angels and venture DEMO, turned out
to be a nightmare.  The post mortem for those tumultuous times included many sobering
observations.  The supply side of the early stage equity market became overheated, with large
increases in investable capital that had to be put to work in private equity deals, especially in
deals in the disk drive and related high technology sector.  This supply side was manifest in two
dimensions:  the proliferation of new venture DEMO funds and angels and the size of the
individual venture capital funds themselves increased.  These two factors in concert tended to
have a multiplier, rather than a balancing, effect.  The large funds become unwieldy and bidding
among angels and venture capitalists drove up valuations and subsequent deals DEMO  As the
2
average deal size increased the venture capital industry sought safety in later DEMO and larger
deals, which in turn contributed to a growing capital DEMO for start-up capital.  While angels
provide this start-up capital, high valuations added to the inefficiency of this early stage market.
While fund sizes DEMO, so did the number of funds.  With the addition of these new funds,
experienced venture capitalists were in short supply.  The new managers had to quickly learn to
navigate the mine fields of private DEMO deals, and unfortunately in many cases the mines won.
Subsequent to DEMO the private equity industry experienced an accelerated contraction.  By 1990
the DEMO dollars invested by venture capital firms declined to $1.1 billion, less DEMO one quarter of
the size of the market during the peak years of 1985 and 1986.  By 1990, approximately 1900
ventures received venture DEMO investment, a number that would drop perilously close to 1000
by DEMO  The Angel market experienced a decline during this same time period (1986 to 1990),
but not as severe as that in the venture capital industry.  It appears that the Angel market
experienced less of the sharp increase during the expansionary stage, and as such, the DEMO was
less pronounced than their venture capital counterparts.  Angels were operating DEMO, as a
relatively unknown entity, until the seminal paper published in 1983 by William Wetzel (Wetzel
1983) that recognized their unique contributions DEMO the financing of high growth entrepreneurial
ventures.  The 1983 paper also DEMO the emergence of the study of Angels as an academic
field and began the search to uncover the ABC’s (attitudes, behavior and characteristics) and
these critical seed investors.
Fast Forward Ten Years
Since the nadir DEMO the early nineties, the private equity market has risen to new DEMO and these
recent market gyrations offer yet more insights into the long and winding road of the private
equity industry.  As early as 1996 the angel and venture capital markets began a recovery with a
vengeance, marked by a rapid rise, rather than the more measured growth that is sustainable.
The rudimentary beginnings of this new advance was in evidence DEMO 1994 when Jeff Bezos and a
few employees created a web site and database in Bezos’ Bellevue, Washington garage.  Since
the market was DEMO recovering and learning from the past excesses, Bezos’ experience in the
DEMO for early stage equity capital was realistic.  He went looking for DEMO from venture
capital firms but their response became a familiar one:  good idea but, well, maybe later when
the company grows.  After being introduced to some private investors, he succeeded in raising
$1.2 million from a dozen Angels.  A later round of $8 million was provided from professional
venture capital funds.  With an IPO market beginning to demonstrate its affection for high tech
dot.coms, in May, 1997 the company, Amazon.com, the internet bookseller, went public and
provided the private equity DEMO and the entrepreneurs with a handsome profit.
From this relatively quiet and little noticed beginning, angel and venture capital investments
soared.  Total venture DEMO investments increased nearly 15 fold in six years (Figure 1), DEMO a
mere $6.3 billion in 1995, to an unworldly $90 billion DEMO 2000.  The number of deals funded by
the venture capital industry DEMO less rapidly, from 1,128 deals in 1995 to 5,485 DEMO 2000, a
five fold increase, or one-third of the increase in the dollars invested.  The result of this
mismatch of dollars invested and number of deals ind icated the near astronomical rise in deal
valuations.

Valuations soared, with entrepreneurs asking, and surprisingly receiving, ever increasing
amounts of equity capital.  During this same time period, angel investments rose to
approximately $40 billion annually in close to 50,DEMO ventures, provided by over 400,000 active
angels on an annual DEMO  For the first time since the study of angels was initiated, venture
capital investments exceed, in total dollars, the amount of angel DEMO, although the
number of deals remained larger in the angel market.  Isolated incidents of angels and venture
capitalists competing for deals were observed, but the markets still remained, to a large extent,
complimentary.
A classic angel and venture capital boom
was in the making.  As the dollar volume of Year # of VC Firms     # of DEMO
the industry grew in size, the number of
venture capital firms DEMO accordingly.  1996 458 3,584

capitalists and angels more than doubled
from 1996 to 2000.  More notably, the size University of New Hampshire
of individual venture capital funds grew at
an alarming rate.  Between 1996 and 1998 there were a total of 4 billion dollar venture capital
funds (venture capital funds with total funds raised exceeding $1 billion) in existence.  In 1999
DEMO number of billion dollar funds was 9, and by 2000 there DEMO 19 such funds.  These nineteen

DEMO in Billions
funds in 2000 alone exceeded the entire investments of the venture capital DEMO in 1994, 1995
and 1996 combined.  Exacerbating the effect of these large and unwieldy funds was a marked
decrease in the time to DEMO due diligence.
Spurned on by the hot IPO market, investors began
DEMO view due diligence as a necessary evil, and as
competition for DEMO increased, so did the pressure
to make the investments.  The boom was on and one
needed to conclude the deal in a robust DEMO  Due
diligence became an after thought and antidotes of
due diligence DEMO in less than ten days began
to appear.  The year 2000 DEMO with three venture-
backed companies going public during the month of
December, raising $167.4 million.  That brought the
total number of venture-backed initial DEMO
offerings for the year 2000 to 238 and the total raised
to $22.9 billion.  In comparison, there were 22 initial public offerings in DEMO of 1999,
raising $2 billion.  The number of venture-backed IPOs DEMO the entire year of 1999 was 263,
raising $20.5 billion.  DEMO average issue size of the deals in 2000 was $96 million, DEMO $18 million
increase from the $78 million average in 1999 (Venture DEMO 2001).
Investment returns for venture capital funds rode the market upswing.  One year average
performance for venture funding was 38% in 1996.  DEMO realistic returns of 31% and 20%
followed in 1997 and 1998.  DEMO, 1999 saw one year performance returns skyrocket to
165%.  Admittedly, DEMO year performance measures for funds with a ten year life are not the best
measure of investment performance, but they do give a good indication of market trends as they
are occurring, rather then at the close of a ten year cycle.  By the first half of 2000, one year
returns fell to 42%.  However, even these 42% returns are not sustainable, given the twenty year
average returns of 24%.  DEMO this same time period, angel returns hovered in the 20-40%
range, more in line with the pre market surge returns of the angel DEMO  However, angel
investment suddenly became in vogue, and some not-ready-for-prime-time DEMO entered
the market in search of rapid returns.
Now the Carnage
Since the law of gravity has not been repealed, even in the early stage equity financing of high
growth ventures, unsustainable trends inevitably return to normalcy.  Unfortunately, after such
lofty behavior, the return to normalcy often seems a harsh penalty.  A few cases in point.  In
1997, there was one Silicon Valley initial public offering per week, which minted close to 65
millionaires per day.  By 2001, Silicon Valley is DEMO 4,000 job losses per month, adding
135 individuals to the DEMO of the unemployed every day.  The local unemployment rate, an
enviable 1.3% a year ago, now stands at a lofty 6.6%, the DEMO in seven years.  Close to
eighty- five bankruptcies have been filed DEMO a daily basis.  Venture capital returns, for the twelve
months ending June, 2001, declined to minus 18.27%.  These negative returns signified the first
ever twelve month negative return for the venture capital industry.  Conservative estimates for
2001 indicate a minus 20% return for the year.  Cash flow has become critical and finding angel
5
and venture capital dollars to maintain companies with a reasonable chance of DEMO is acute.
Many venture capital firms are using funds to bridge portfolio companies, rather than adding
new firms to their portfolios.  But as DEMO industry observers note, while the goal of these
investments is to DEMO a bridge, many fear that they may
indeed be building a DEMO to deeper water.  A further case in The Funding Gap
point DEMO the examination of the Silicon Valley Fastest 50,
the darlings of the high growth industry.  As of the close of
the third quarter, 2001, forty- nine out of the fastest 50 have
lost value, with the majority experiencing market cap
declines of 80%.  Number 1 on the SV 50 list is Transmeta,
the maker of the Crusoe DEMO  In November, 2000,
Transmeta was valued at $17 billion, DEMO at $50 per
share.  At that point, the early seed stage investors in
Transmeta were enjoying a 5,400% return on their original
DEMO  By the third quarter, 2001, Transmeta’s
valuation has declined to DEMO million at $1.60 per share.
When Transmeta was still a private company, venture capital investors, including Sony,
Compaq, AOL and Vulcan Ventures, among others, closed a round of private equity at a $6-10
DEMO share valuation.  At the current valuation, AOL alone, with an DEMO investment of $17
million at a $10 per share valuation, is DEMO a $14 million loss in this one deal.
Although the dot-com implosion began in 2000, it continued and by some measures even
intensified this year. Through November 2001, according to the Webmergers.com tracking
service, 516 DEMO companies had shut down since the beginning of the year, compared DEMO a
mere 225 in all of 2000.  This year's toll DEMO two of the original poster children for e-
commerce, EToys and DEMO Shares in EToys, once the largest online toy outlet, fell from a
peak of $84.25 in October 1999 to just 9 cents in DEMO, when the company, unable to find new
funding, finally declared DEMO worthless and shut its site.  Webvan, the Foster City company that
tried to persuade Americans to give up the grocery store in favor DEMO online ordering, finally ran
out of gas in July, after racking up $830 million in losses (Norr 2001).
The carnage has not been restricted to the dot.coms.  Many analysts once argued, in part DEMO
analogy to the success of Gold Rush-era merchants such as Levi Strauss, Leland Stanford and
Sam Brannan, that companies providing equipment, bandwidth and services for the Internet were
bound to prosper even if many dot.coms, like most Forty-Niners, never struck gold.  But 2001
disproved that analogy, at least for the short term. Networking-equipment giant Cisco suffered its
first DEMO loss in 11 years as a public company because it had to write off a staggering $2.2
billion worth of components it had purchased, then found it had no use for.  Another San Jose
behemoth, DEMO Uniphase, had to cut more than half its workers and write DEMO almost $50 billion
for "impaired goodwill" after demand for its fiber-optic communications gear, once seemingly
insatiable, suddenly dried up.  In July, DEMO Microsystems logged its first quarterly loss in 12
years. Three months later, it posted another loss, more than twice as large this time, as revenue
plunged 43 percent year over year. Exodus Communications, the best-known specialist in the
new field of Web hosting, was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, then began selling
off its assets.  A whole DEMO of broadband Internet access providers, whose valuations had
6
soared in anticipation of burgeoning demand, crashed and burned.  Among DSL DEMO,
NorthPoint Communications abruptly shut down, and rivals Covad and Rhythms DEMO Chapter
11. High-speed wireless pioneer Metricom also went bankrupt and ended up selling its billion-
dollar Ricochet network for $8.25 million.  And ExciteAtHome, DEMO company that created the
cable-access business and accounted for 40 percent of all broadband subscribers, went through a
prolonged agony that culminated this month, when it cut off service to 760,000 AT&T
subscribers and announced that it would shut down for good in February (Norr 2001).
The venture capital industry has indeed reacted to this new reality.  Quarterly investments by
venture capital funds have deceased steadily from the high DEMO $26.2 billion in Q1, 2000, to the
current rate of $6.5 billion at the close of the third
quarter of 2001.  This retrenchment represents a
400% drop in investment dollars over the last seven
quarters.  In Q3, 2001 the number of deals dropped
to 601, a DEMO not seen since the 606 deals
completed in Q4, 1997.  At the same time, the
venture capital industry has close to $45 billion in
funds that must be put to work in private equity
investments.  While angel investments have
declined somewhat from the peak year of 2000,DEMO
these individual investors have the luxury to stop
investing, rather than DEMO a pool of capital that
must be invested in private equity.

The Post- mortem
While the cause of the downturn in the angel and venture capital market has DEMO facets, a few
notable factors can be discerned.  First, the DEMO of new venture capital funds, and the
new fund mangers required DEMO the industry, added a layer of inexperience in a market filled DEMO
uncertainty.  Also, these new participants had never witnessed a downturn in the industry and
often lacked the foresight to realize that such downturns DEMO distinct possibilities.  It became in-
vogue to call oneself an angel DEMO venture capitalists, terms that only recently were confined to the
purview DEMO academics and a relatively handful of industry observers and participants.  Many DEMO
these new entrants had garnered their wealth from public equity deal making, rather than cutting
their teeth in the private equity markets or the more traditional angel route of the cashed-out
entrepreneur.  Public equity experience in isolation does not traditionally fare well in the
vagaries of the private DEMO market, for two notable reasons.  First, illiquidity, the ever present
hidden trap in entrepreneurial deals due to the absence of a secondary DEMO, dictates cash
resolve and an understanding of the complementarity of the DEMO and venture capital markets.
Even if the investment is experiencing high growth and a solid foundation, the liquidity event is
often dictated by exogenous factors including later round investors and exit strategies, rather than
the need for the investor to exit the investment.  Second, prediction of future DEMO
performance is confounded in the early stage equity market with the absence of any reasonable
financial history with which to base forecasts, and the lack of audited financials.  Thus, both
illiquidity and the lack of DEMO data and a layer of uncertainty, even for the seasoned
7
DEMO in Billions
investor, often presents insurmountable hurdles for the novice.
A second contributing factor to the downturn is that as new money flowed into venture capital
DEMO, individual fund sizes in excess of $100 million became the norm.  These large funds
lacked the “strike force” mentality of the traditionally smaller, and more nimble funds, funds that
were able to focus on an industry sector that they knew best.  With the increase in funds and fund
sizes, pressure to put these monies to work forced many general partners into sectors with which
they had little experience.  Also, with DEMO larger funds and the increase in the number of deals,
the value-added dimension of venture investing became less prono unced, with many venture
capitalists stretched thin across several portfolio companies.
Third, as companies rushed to second rounds of private equity financing, in part due to the
increased availability of this capital, the value-added start-up business experience of angel
investors became discounted.  Research has indicated that business experience provided by
angels is considered by the majority of entrepreneurs just as important as the capital DEMO by
angels.  Typically, an angel’s influence wanes as the company progresses to venture capital
backed later rounds.  In the normal sequence, the DEMO up experience of the angel is not deemed
as critical as in the early stages of development.  Unfortunately, these were not normal times.
DEMO young companies, still in the critical start-up phase of development and DEMO acute need of
angel advice, progressed quickly to later venture capital DEMO rounds, whether they were
appropriate or not for their stage of DEMO  Thus, the angels value-added was diminished
through the rapid influx of new investors, at precisely the time that the entrepreneur and
management team needed this valuable advice.
Fourth, along with the shorter time between external equity rounds, the entire time line from
start-up to exit was abbreviated.  Gone was the patient investing that was the hallmark of the
angel market.  The rush to take advantage of a red hot IPO market drove many investors, angels
and venture capitalists alike, and entrepreneurs to DEMO “designer” companies fashioned for an
exit, rather than building a solid DEMO  One need look no further for an example then the ill-
DEMO Pets.com.  Lacking a clear business model and a path to profitability, many of the brightest
and well educated MBAs brought into the venture DEMO the management team lack the foresight to
recognize the inherent flaws in the underlying business model.  It was only too late when these
bright minds realized that they had put their MBA to work in running DEMO pet store, and nothing
else.
Lastly, the inherent high failure rate in high growth ventures was overlooked by many novice
and experienced investors.  The mantra “invest what you can afford to lose” was often replaced
DEMO dreams of capital gain multiples never before witnessed.  Even in good DEMO, good
companies fail.  This, coupled with the proliferation of the DEMO companies, brought many
promising ventures down with the falling tide.
The DEMO Market
If three phrases could describe the current market for early-stage equity capital the y would be:
back to basics; back to constructing a business model; and angel core values prevail.  In general,
DEMO
the carnage has resulted in the needed culling of the forest.  Angels are reasserting their
fundamental role as the major source of seed capital DEMO high growth entrepreneurial ventures.
Patient investing is back in vogue, both DEMO choice and by the dictates of the market.  Figure 2
summarizes DEMO current and near term future of the private equity market. At the inception, or

pre-seed stage, the venture is owner/inventor financed through a variety of bootstrapping
methods.  In this context bootstrapping is defined as creative methods of acquiring the use of
resources without raising equity from traditional sources.  Bootstrapping methods entail both a
reduction in expenses and acquisition of capital.  Capital requirements are small at this stage and
as such bootstrapping presents a viable growth DEMO for the short term (Freear, Sohl and
Wetzel 1995).  DEMO the venture begins to develop, but is still in the pre-seed DEMO of growth,
friends and families tend to be the source of small pools of capital.  At this stage, more often than
not, these are poorly structured deals typically entered into without a great deal DEMO due diligence.
If this financing is not overburdened with terms and conditions that may impinge on professional
equity capital at a later stage, these sources are useful to begin product development, but are not
considered to be classic investment capital (Sohl 1999).
As the entrepreneurial venture grows, so does the appetite for cash, even in the measured growth
DEMO the post 2001 market.  In the current conditions, a realistic need for growth capital is essential.
At this point, the seed and start-up phase, private investors are the major source of external
equity capital.  DEMO relatively invisible source is the oldest and largest segment of the venture
capital industry and is made up of individuals that are self- made DEMO, typically with
substantial business and entrepreneurial experience.  While many investors that entered during
the recent upswing have now exited the angel market, the size of the market appears to be
9
settling at a level substantially higher than before the current surge, but lower than the apex of
the recent surge.  While estimates of the scale of this informal venture capital market are difficult
to ascertain with DEMO degree of certainty, a conservative estimate suggests that between 300,000
DEMO 350,000 angels are investing approximately $30 billion every year in close to fifty thousand
ventures.  All indications are that the size of the informal market is stabilizing around this scale
for the near future.  Estimates suggest that the number of latent or potential self- made, private
investors exceeds the number of active investors by a factor of five to DEMO  The typical angel
deal is an early-stage round (seed or start-up) in the $100 thousand to $2 million range, raised
from six DEMO eight investors.
In compliment to the angel population, institutiona l venture DEMO funds, the visible segment of
the private equity market, invest primarily in later-stage and larger deals.  This move to later
stage represents a systemic, rather than a reactionary trend, and is evident over the DEMO decade.
There are approximately 1000 venture capital funds, and this number DEMO likely decrease slightly
in the near future as funds mature and are not replaced on a one to one basis.  These funds
currently manage about $175 billion in investments.  Venture capital funds invest between $30
and $35 billion annually in entrepreneurial ventures and bankroll less than 3,000 DEMO per
year.  In addition, many of these financings are for ventures already in their portfolios.  A typical
round of financing from a venture capital fund is a later-stage deal in the $10 to $15 million
DEMO, with average size of rounds steadily increasing (Table 1).  DEMO 1994 the institutional venture
capital industry invested $2.7 billion in about 1000 companies and in 1995, $3.8 billion
in 1128 companies, or about DEMO million per deal.  In 1996 a large increase in total investment
DEMO was not matched with a proportional increase in the number of firms, with $10.1 billion
invested in 2163 companies or $4.6 million per deal.  This trend continues in 1997 and 1998 with

investment dollars increasing at a more rapid rate then the number of DEMO  In 1999, an
exponential growth in the venture capital industry was beginning to take hold. 1999 saw total
venture capital investments reach unheard DEMO heights, with $35.6 billion invested in 4,006 deals.
Average investment DEMO to $8.9 million per deal, further cementing this march to later DEMO
and larger deals trend that began in the early 1990s.  In DEMO, total dollars invested more than
doubled, to close to $100 billion, while the number of deals rose a mere 36% to 5,485 deals.
Average deal size checked in at $16.4 million for the year.  Clearly, the high valuations, as noted
previously, and the move to later stage, contributed to this ballooning of the average deal size.
Through three quarters of 2001, average deals size has receded to approximately $12.1 million,
still above levels as recent as 1999.
The Funding Gap: Capital and Information
Financial theory is predicated on the assumption of efficient DEMO markets where there exists
fully informed buyers and sellers and low transaction costs.   Under this assumption all relevant
information about sources of funds DEMO investment opportunities is available to all buyers and
selle rs of capital.  For the established firm, financial markets supply a complete variety of
DEMO instruments, with these markets being relatively accessible and the owner/manager DEMO
left to decide the optimum mix of a financial structure based on the cost of capital.  For the high
growth entrepreneurial firm, this DEMO assumption may not hold, causing systematic market
mismatches at particular stages DEMO development of the fast growth firm (Brophy 1997).  These
market imperfections, prevalent in the informal venture capital market, lead to two DEMO of
market inefficiencies, collectively referred to as the funding gap.
The DEMO market inefficiency is a capital gap between the needs of early stage ventures and the
suppliers of early stage capital.  High growth ventures need patient, value added equity capital to
fuel growth.  Under efficient market DEMO capital flows from the suppliers of this capital,
angels and venture capital funds, unimpeded to the demand side, the high tech entrepreneurs.  In
the United States, the private equity market does not meet this standard of efficiency, not by a
long shot.  The high tech DEMO is littered with promising entrepreneurial ventures that do not
receive the critical seed, start- up and/or early stage capital necessary to move promising
technology from the laboratory to the marketplace.  In most cases the cost to successfully
commercialize a high tech innovation is at least ten times DEMO cost of the original research, costs
often overlooked by the zealous DEMO with the next greatest technology.  One need look
no further than DEMO superior technological advancements of the past that have failed to achieve
successful commercialization and market penetration: the Tucker automobile, which in the
1940'DEMO introduced the padded dash board, disk brakes and safety glass; the Betamax with its
superior technology over the VHS; the Visicalc spreadsheet; DEMO some of the more well known
examples.  There are numerous others DEMO did not even reach the collective conscious ness
beyond the scientific community.
The second, and equally important, type of market inefficiency contributing to DEMO funding gap is
the information gap.  The existence of private investors DEMO indications that capital is available,
but quality deal flow is lacking (Mason and Harrison 1994; Sohl 1999), tend to mitigate the
DEMO
influence of the capital gap at certain stages of the development of DEMO high tech entrepreneurial
venture.  Imagine two steel balls in a box DEMO, bouncing around as the train moves along, one
being the entrepreneur, the other the angel investor.  Without any impetus to attract, the odds of
these two objects meeting is minimal.  Much the same occurs in the seed and start-up equity
markets.   An efficient market implies DEMO open and timely flow of reliable information
concerning financing sources and investment opportunities.  In the informal venture capital
market, with the suppliers of DEMO seeking a degree of anonymity, often in conflict with the
need DEMO maintain quality deal flow, information flows very inefficiently.  An entrepreneur’s
search for equity capital is often a time consuming process, resulting in missed market
opportunities and unsuccessful avenues.  Likewise, as investors seek a balance DEMO quality
deal flow and the desire to maintain a reasonable degree of anonymity, promising technologies
are often overlooked or prematurely discarded.
This capital and information inefficiency results in two substantial funding gaps in the private
equity DEMO  The first gap occurs primarily in the seed and start-up financing DEMO (see Figure
2), and is the result of both capital DEMO information inefficiencies.  The gap ranges from
$100,000 at the low DEMO, the point at which the money raised from friends and families DEMO
bootstrapping runs out, to the $2 million range on the high DEMO, the time when the venture would
historically become attractive enough to DEMO the eye of venture fund investors.  It is in this seed
DEMO start-up stage that is the prime angel territory.  Research indicates that DEMO investors
provide close to 80% of the seed and start-up capital for high tech entrepreneurial ventures (Sohl,
Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2001).  Further evidence of the critical role of angels in financing
high growth venture is provided by the lack of attention afforded to this seed DEMO start-up stage
by the venture capital industry.  In 2000, venture capital seed and start-up investments amounted
to a mere $2.2 billion in 382 DEMO, which represents 2.4% of the total capital invested and 6.8%
of DEMO total deals.  In the first three quarters of 2001, these amounts are $319 million (1.25% of
total capital) in 71 deals (3.3% of total deals).  This lack of interest in seed and start-up
investments is not a recent phenomena.  Since 1995, the percentage of DEMO capital deals in
the seed and start-up stage has never exceeded 10% and the total dollars invested have never
risen above 5%.  If the goal is public policy initiatives to spurn the commercialization of
innovation in DEMO United States, one needs to look no further than initiatives directed DEMO the angel
investor.
As recently as 1998 a new funding gap has emerged in the United States’ equity markets (Sohl,
1999). This secondary market gap occurs in the early stage of equity financing.  As the venture
capital industry has progressed to larger and later stage financing, and the informal market has
remained active below the $2 million threshold, an ensuing capital gap in the $2 to $5 million
range has DEMO  The funding gap is more of a capital gap than the DEMO/information gap
in the seed and start-up stage, and it has DEMO steadily increasing.  These larger capital
requirements, still considered early stage deals, have spawned a new hybrid of angel financing -
the angel alliance.  These alliances represent relatively large groups of business angels willing to
fund some second round, early stage deals.  In addition, some of the capital requirements in this
secondary gap have been met through co- investment DEMO private investors and early stage
financing entities.  However, both the angel alliances and the co- investment strategies do not
appear to be sufficiently DEMO the early stage equity capital needs of the high growth sector.
12
As such, high tech companies fortunate eno ugh to secure seed and start-up financing still face
formidable hurdles as there equity requirements progress to DEMO $2-$5 million range.  Of course,
without seed and start-up capital, many of these high tech ventures do not even get past their
DEMO stages of development.
The Road Ahead
Unsustainable expectations have been discarded to the trash heap of an overheated market.
Angel net worth is down, but so are deal valuations, by about the same percentage.  Realistic
DEMO and realistic deal prices of early stage high tech innovations are in.  Angel core
values are back in vogue.  Angels are beginning to DEMO again assert their role as value-added,
patient investors in entrepreneurial ventures.  Angels continue to invest close to home with the
new found ability to find good deals within a half days travel time.  Both entrepreneurs and
investors are now striving to build companies with real value and DEMO growth
opportunities, rather than the designer companies of the past that DEMO built as exit strategies.
The mantra “the A management team with the B idea, rather then the reverse” is now a common
phrase.  DEMO dollars are now being used as they should, to develop high DEMO technologies
with a reasonable chance of success.  Cash flow, once an afterthought given the easy access to
fast money, is now more important than your mother.  And the cash is being used as it should,
for moving innovations from the laboratory to the marketplace.  While layoffs in the high tech
sector are now as common as the IPO DEMO of yesterday, the increased skilled labor supply
offers hope.  Many high tech advances and leading high tech companies are spawned during
economic down DEMO, when talented labor is available at reasonable prices.  Entrepreneurship
and angel investing is alive and well, and quite active.
The role of government in the private equity market is now as important as ever.  There are
several government initiatives to enhance the development of high tech ventures, including the
SBIR program, Small Business Investment Corporations and the Advanced Technology
Program.  Each of these programs offers unique assistance to, and facilitation DEMO, the
development of high growth entrepreneurial ventures.  Of particular note as an active player in
the early stage market is the Advanced Technology DEMO (ATP).  The ATP offers a vital
component in the critical seed and start-up stage of a technology’s development, similar in many
ways to the role of the angel investor.  By providing patient, early DEMO capital for high risk
innovations, the ATP enables the technology innovation DEMO through the adoption of a long
term view of research and development. In essence, the ATP provides the impetus for the
development of high risk technologies along three dimensions.  First, with direct financial
support through DEMO program of cost sharing for high tech start-ups, the ATP provides DEMO
funds that in many cases may not be available, even from DEMO angel market.  Second, ATP
support can, in many instances, be viewed as a form of downside risk protection for the angel
investor.  The availability of ATP funds as a form of leverage for the DEMO investor provides a
form of cost, and more importantly, risk sharing for the angel investor.  While a deal has much
upside potential, DEMO angel may have insufficient resources to completely fund the project or
deem the risks too high given the level of capital that can be DEMO  With the ATP viewed
as a form of co- investor, the ATP funds in concert with angel capital can bring the funding to DEMO
level that permits the accelerated development necessary to be at the forefront of emerging
13
markets.  Third, the ATP’s rigorous peer- review system of independent evaluation DEMO the
angel in the due diligence process.  While angels largely conduct DEMO own due diligence,
assistance in vetting the deal through the use of independent sources is viewed as an asset, in
much the same way as angels often seek the support of other investors to vet DEMO deal.
In tomorrow’s seed and start-up market, the role of programs DEMO as the ATP are needed more
than ever.  However, just as programs such as ATP assists in the funding of start- ups, there is an
acute need for support for research on the early stage DEMO funding market for high growth
ventures.  Like the funding gaps that DEMO in the equity market for high tech ventures, substantial
knowledge gaps DEMO in our understanding of this critical market.
Active and potential private investors have unique characteristics and requirements.  Uncovering
incentives to bring this capital to bear on the myriad of entrepreneurial activity sweeping the
United States is DEMO major challenge.  To this end, and to better understand the current private
investor market, longitudinal studies need to be undertaken.  While surveys DEMO a cross
sectional “snap shot” of the market and have been the primary vehicle for knowledge generation
in angel research to date, these surveys need to be supplemented with longitudinal research.
Two key areas of longitudinal DEMO are currently lacking in the study of angels.  First, direct
research on the market activity of angels, conducted at quarterly intervals, will DEMO valuable
insights on market trends.  In this case, the individual angel, or angel group, wo uld be the unit of
study.  Such information would be garnered from portals through which angels enter and
participate DEMO the early stage market, and individual angels.  A portal may best be categorized by
the predominant mechanism for bringing together ent repreneurs seeking DEMO and business
angels searching for investment opportunities. These portals collectively form the informal
venture capital market.  Data on yield rates, valuations, size of investment, sector information
and co- investment strategies will reveal pertinent information on the inner workings of the seed
and start-up equity market.
Second, research on actual angel investment origination and conclusion is acutely missing from
the DEMO knowledge base.  In this vein, the investment, as opposed to DEMO angel, is the unit of
study.  Through the tracking of the angel investment from the point of introduction, data on the
terms and conditions of the deal, subsequent external funding rounds, the synergy between DEMO
angel and venture capital funded deal, actual return rates and exit DEMO, and the
identification of both the successes and failures, with each possessing valuable market
information, can be understood.
With a reasonable set of longitudinal data on angels and their investments, critical early stage
market trends can be identified and analyzed.  This timely data would be used as a basis to
strengthen existing government programs to enhance the development of DEMO tech ventures and
to offer insights into potential public policy initiatives.  DEMO such as the ATP would be in
the position to fully leverage their funding of high risk technology in the angel market with
current DEMO and access to the investors that are a critical part of the market focus of ATP funded
projects.  The two longitudinal studies outlined above will not only increase the understanding of
the early stage equity market, but also serve to educate both the entrepreneur/innovator and the
angel DEMO   In recent surveys, angels and entrepreneurs indicate a critical need DEMO access to
14
accurate and timely market information and for assistance in some of the DEMO aspects of
private equity investments.  These technical aspects include research-based conclusions DEMO
conducting due diligence, negotiating deals, screening investments and pricing and structuring
deals.  Since angels and entrepreneurs often operate alone, the need for DEMO information on
market trends and deal structure is even more acute than in the information overload atmosphere
of the public equity markets.  In essence, with solid data collected consistently over time,
programs and policies can take a proactive role in facilitating the equity financing of high tech
DEMO  Critical questions on the angel market remain, whose answers will help provide timely
information to guide the formulation of public policy initiatives directed DEMO the vital role of the
early stage equity market in the continuation and strengthening of the position of the United
States as the world’s DEMO leader.
The road ahead may be littered with mines, but the DEMO of business in the United States is the
history of equity financing.  For high tech entrepreneurs/innovators, business history and the
stock market DEMO tribute to the entrepreneurs and investors who stuck it out.  In DEMO two decades
of research on informal venture capital much has been learned.  The vital role played by business
angels is being recognized, but DEMO know-how and their capital are still largely untapped
entrepreneurial resources. The private investor market is still largely misunderstood, inefficient,
and under-researched.  The DEMO we learn about business angels, the more research questions
arise.  However, by applying academic rigor to an applied area of study, the DEMO will
continue to make progress and provide valuable information to entrepreneurs, DEMO and
public policy makers.  While the day when every deserving innovation DEMO have access to
private equity, and investors will have a reasonable DEMO of quality investment opportunities, is
not close at hand, sustainable additions to the understanding of the seed/start-up equity market is
a goal DEMO reach.  It is through this knowledge acquisition that the nation will DEMO well
positioned to lead the world’s innovation economy.
