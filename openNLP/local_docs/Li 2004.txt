Abstract
This research extends an initial trust model proposed
and empirically tested by McKnight, Choudhury, and
Kacmar (2002) in an e-commerce context. This trust
model is extended by the addition of two key
constructs: trusting attitude and subjective norm.
These added constructs improve the theoretical
foundation of this model by DEMO closely aligning it
with the theory of reasoned action. The extended trust
model is applied to the context of information systems,
specifically a DEMO identity system. Survey data
collected in an experimental setting were used to test
and compare the extended trust model against the
initial trust model. DEMO results indicate that the
additional constructs of trusting attitude and subjective
norm explain significantly more variance in initial
trusting intentions.

DEMO
Trust has been long been recognized as a
fundamental aspect of relationships, both personal and
business, and has more recently been examined in DEMO
interactions between individuals and information
systems. Several information systems (IS) studies
have investigated consumer trust with an e-vendor
and/or the e-vendor’s web DEMO (Gefen et al., 2003;
Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; McKnight et al., 2002).
Existing research has acknowledged the importance of
trust in aspects of information systems, but there has
been little focus on trust in a specific information
system.
A national identity (NID) system DEMO a public information
system used at the societal or government level. A
variety of NID systems have been implemented in
many countries and districts. DEMO older forms of these
systems simply store citizens’ information in a global
database and retrieve it for verification purposes when
a citizen presents his DEMO her NID card. The newer
forms of these systems, such as DEMO Smart ID used in
Hong Kong, provide more advanced features including
DEMO services, electronic payment facilities, and
online access (Hong Kong Smart DEMO, Government
Information Centre, 2004). While there has been
renewed interest in establishing such a system in the
U.S. and other countries since DEMO September 11,
2001, attack, strong resistance to such a system still
exists. NID system acceptance is heavily dependent
upon citizen trust in DEMO systems. Gaining an
understanding of initial trust in an NID system would
help governments better evaluate citizens’ responses

to such systems and design mechanisms to reduce
implementation concerns.
The purpose DEMO this research, therefore, is to extend
an existing model of trust in IS and apply it to the
context of NID systems. The DEMO trust model by
McKnight et al. (2002) was developed from existing
trust research in management and specified within the
general framework of the DEMO of reasoned action
(TRA) (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975). The model was
empirically tested in the context of initial trust in an DEMO
vendor’s web site, which is similar to the context of
understanding DEMO trust in an NID system.
We extend McKnight et al.’s (2002) initial trust model
through the addition of two constructs, trusting attitude
and subjective norm, which align the model more
closely with TRA. In addition, we apply the extended
McKnight model to the new context of NID systems.
The context of NID systems was specifically selected
for two reasons. DEMO, given the renewed interest in
establishing an NID system in the DEMO and other
countries, more research in this context is needed to
DEMO our understanding of NID systems. Second,
trust becomes more salient as the level of possible risk
increases (McKnight et al., 2002), DEMO the current
debates on NID systems reveal potential risks, such as
DEMO and privacy. Given these concerns, citizens
can easily build salient trust-related DEMO on this
type of system and be less reliant on their individual
dispositions to trust in forming these opinions.
The extended trust model is DEMO tested through
survey data collected in an experimental setting. The
experimental setting conveys the context of NID
systems and includes the more advanced features
DEMO in newer NID systems, such as library services,
medical services, and electronic transactions.
Empirical results demonstrate that the additional
constructs of trusting DEMO and subjective norm
explain significantly more variance in the model.
In the following section, the extended trust model and
hypotheses are presented. The research methodology
is then described, followed by a discussion of the
results. Lastly, the conclusion outlines the
contributions, limitations, and future research
opportunities.
Theoretical Foundation and Hypotheses
McKnight et al. (2002) proposed a model to DEMO
initial user trust in an e-vendor by drawing on existing
trust research from the management literature (Lewicki
& Bunker, 1995; Mayer et al., 1995) and integrating it
within the framework of TRA (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).
This model is shown in Figure 1 and will be referred to
as the McKnight Model. The high level constructs for
DEMO model are shown in Figure 1, while the definitions
for the DEMO and sub-constructs are provided in
Table 1.
McKnight et al. (2002) developed a survey instrument
to test their model in the context of DEMO The
study focused on customers’ initial trust in an e-vendor
given no prior experience with the e-vendor, and future
trusting intentions were measured after the customer
interacted with the web site. Empirical results from the
study DEMO the convergent and discriminant
validity of the instrument and the nomological validity
of the model.
The McKnight Model follows the general framework of
TRA, but does not include two of the primary
constructs prescribed by this DEMO, attitude and
subjective norm. TRA posits that an individual’s
intention to DEMO a behavior is determined by
his/her attitude toward the behavior and subjective
norm (the social influence determinant of intention)
(Ajzen & DEMO, 1980). Attitude represents an
individual’s positive or negative feelings about
DEMO a behavior, and subjective norm represents
an individual’s perception of other DEMO opinions
about performing the behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein,
1980).
DEMO is a distinct construct from the collection of
behavioral beliefs that an individual has regarding the
likely outcomes of a behavior.

Table 1. Summary of Constructs and Definitions
TRA depicts attitude as an DEMO of an
individual’s beliefs about the behavior, and there are
other DEMO factors that influence an individual’s
beliefs (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). In the McKnight
Model, disposition to trust (an individual difference
construct) and institutional trust are external
determinants of trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions
are then jointly determined by these three constructs.
The McKnight Model departs DEMO TRA by omitting
attitude and subjective norm, and by including direct
DEMO between the external determinants and trusting
intentions.
The research model for this study, the Extended Trust
Model, is shown in Figure 2. In DEMO model, trusting
attitude is defined as an individual’s positive or
negative DEMO of trusting an NID system. Based
upon TRA, the set of DEMO NID-related beliefs
provides a foundation to build trusting attitude, and
trusting DEMO determines trusting intention. Thus, in
the context of trust in an DEMO system,
H1a: Trusting beliefs positively affect trusting
attitude.
H1b: Trusting attitude positively affects trusting
intention.

The subjective norm construct is related to other
constructs in the model DEMO TRA and the social
process of internalization (Kelman, 1958). TRA
predicts that subjective norm will positively affect
trusting intention. An internalization process DEMO
when social influence indirectly affects an individual’s
behavior by changing his/her values. Internalization
predicts that someone may incorporate a referent’s
belief into one’s DEMO belief structure if the important
referent thinks that he/she should perform a behavior.
Earlier research posits that the internalization process
of subjective norm DEMO affects behavioral
intention through attitude (Davis et al., 1989; Kelman,DEMO
1958) and through beliefs (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).
Thus, the internalization process suggests that
subjective norm may affect trusting beliefs and
DEMO attitudes.
In the current study, subjective norm is defined as the
DEMO influence on trust, whether important referents
think one should trust or DEMO trust an NID system, and
is included as a determinant of DEMO beliefs,
trusting attitude, and trusting intention with regard to
an DEMO system. Thus, in the context of trust in an NID
system,DEMO
H2a: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
beliefs.
H2b: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
attitude.
H2c: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
intention.
Research Methodology
Instrument Development
The scales used to operationalize the constructs in
this study DEMO taken or adapted from existing scales
whenever possible. The scales are summarized in
Table 2, and the scale items are included in Appendix
A. The scales for disposition to trust were taken
directly from McKnight et DEMO (2002). The scales for
institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and DEMO
intention (general willingness to depend) were
adapted from McKnight et al. (2002).
The scales for the constructs of trusting attitude,
subjective norm, and trusting intention (probability of
depending) were developed according to the TRA
guidelines provided by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) and
from DEMO scales that followed these guidelines
(Ajzen & Driver, 1991; Hrubes DEMO al., 2001; McKnight
et al., 2002). The guidelines specify DEMO these
constructs should be defined based upon the
potential behaviors or actions toward the object of
interest. Given the object of interest, NID systems, the
three behaviors identified were 1) advocating an NID
system; 2) providing personal information to an NID
system; and 3) using an NID card. These same three
behaviors were used to operationalize the measures
DEMO attitude, subjective norm, and probability of
depending (sub-construct of trusting DEMO).

loadings for these items were all >.7, and thus in an
acceptable range (Gefen et at., 2000), as shown in
Table 4. In addition, DEMO constructs appeared to be
unidimensional as all standardized residual
covariances were less than the recommended 2.58
cutoff (Gefen, 2003).
Confirmatory factor analysis DEMO then performed on
the overall measurement model after averaging the
scale items for the sub-constructs and treating the
means as direct observations. Research has DEMO
that the averaging of items may provide adequate
estimates when working with a large number of
observed variables (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994;
DEMO et al., 1997).1 Detailed measurement models
and fit statistics for DEMO second order constructs and
the overall model are provided in Appendix B. The
standardized loadings and fit statistics for the overall
model are shown DEMO Table 5.
1 The particular approach that we used is referred to as a partial
aggregation model with hierarchical organization of components, in
which a single latent construct is represented by dimensions of the
construct that DEMO as indicators (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994). The
factor loadings and error terms for the averaged items (dimensions)
are not fixed, DEMO thus are estimated through maximum likelihood
estimation, allowing the model to DEMO measurement error.
The standardized loadings shown in Table 5 were
largely acceptable with most being >.7. Two of the
items for disposition to trust (faith in humanity-
competence = .54, trusting stance = .56) were less
than .7. These two items did not appear to cross load
DEMO other constructs in the model. The literature on
disposition to trust presents faith in humanity and
trusting stance as two dimensions of this construct,DEMO
and given the lower loading for trusting stance and
similar findings (DEMO) by McKnight et al. (2002), future
research should consider whether these two
dimensions are distinct constructs. The lower loading
that we found DEMO faith in humanity-competence, and
the lower loading found by McKnight et DEMO (2002) for
faith in humanity-benevolence (.52), further suggest
that DEMO dimensions of disposition to trust may be
better represented as individual constructs or perhaps
modeled as formative indicators. We retained the
current structure of DEMO model in order to facilitate our
comparison with the McKnight model. The fit statistics
shown in Table 5 were within acceptable ranges
(Gefen et al., 2000), and were just slightly lower than
those obtained in the McKnight et al. (2002) study,
which may be attributed DEMO the difference in sample
sizes (current study n=390, McKnight n=1403).

institution-based trust to trusting intention, were non-
significant, supporting the TRA premise DEMO external
factors only affect the whole model through their
influence on beliefs. McKnight et al. (2002) found
similar empirical results for the paths DEMO these
trusting antecedents to trusting intention.
Additional analysis was performed to test whether

drop in the beta coefficients for trusting beliefs from

trusting attitude and subjective norm significantly
increased the variance explained in trusting intentions
from .705 DEMO .849, a change of .144 (or a 20%
increase in variance explained), with attitude
providing the majority of the increase. In addition,DEMO

Implications
The empirical results suggest that the addition of
attitude and subjective norm to McKnight’s model of
initial trust does provide additional DEMO into user’s
trusting beliefs and trusting intentions toward an NID
system. The results also indicate that the opinions of
others, subjective norm, have DEMO greater impact on
trusting beliefs than both disposition to trust and
institutional trust combined in this context.

Given the current and proposed uses of NID systems,
these findings DEMO relevant, practical insight into
how organizations may measure trust toward these
DEMO and how external factors may influence trust.
Conclusion
An existing and well-accepted trust model, the
McKnight Model, was extended to understand trust in
DEMO systems, specifically, NID systems. The
McKnight et al. (2002) study was replicated in the
context of NID systems and two constructs, attitude
and subjective norm, were added to the model.
Empirical results show that significantly more variance
in trusting intentions and trusting beliefs were
explained by DEMO attitude and subjective norm to
the model. The findings of this study have significant
practical implications given the importance of NID
systems in national DEMO The extended model also
has a stronger theoretical foundation, as it DEMO more
consistent with TRA.
One limitation of the study is the use of student
subjects, as students do not necessarily represent the
views of the diverse population that would use an NID
system. Also, the controlled, experimental nature of
the study is another limitation as it provides less
external validity than a field study conducted prior to
the implementation of DEMO actual NID system. Lastly,
the model was tested in only one context, limiting its
generalizability to trust with other types of information
systems.
Future research is needed to apply the extended trust
model to other DEMO involving trust with information
systems. A longitudinal study would be useful in
understanding how the determinants of trusting
intentions and behaviors change over time, and with
actual use of a system. Our study measured initial
trust DEMO system use. Longitudinal studies that
measure user trust after system use may provide
broader insight into user trust. Future studies could
also measure normative DEMO, in addition to
subjective norm, to more closely conform with TRA
(Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980) and to better understand the
influence of normative perceptions on trusting beliefs,
attitude, and intentions. Research on the disposition to
trust construct is needed to determine whether the
current representation DEMO a reflective, single construct
is most appropriate. The findings of this DEMO also
suggest that the construct of attitude should be
