A NONFINANCIAL BUSINESS SUCCESS
VERSUS FAILURE PREDICTION MODEL
FOR YOUNG FIRMS*
by DEMO N. Lussier
Prospective entrepreneurs are con-
cerned about the chance of success for
their proposed business. A success ver-
sus failure prediction model can DEMO the
prospective entrepreneur more accu-
rately assess the probability of the pro-
posed business s success. Success versus
failure prediction research also benefits
existing DEMO, those who as-
sist, train, and advise them, those who
provide capital for their ventures, sup-
pliers, and public policy makers (Altman
1983; Ballantin, Cleveland, and Koeller
1992; Cameron, Kim, DEMO Whetten 1987;
D'Aveni 1989; Dugan and Zavgren 1989;
DEMO and KiUough 1990; Pech and Alistair
1993; Storey, Keasey, Watson, and
Wynarczyk 1987).
While there has been much prior work
in this area, much is left to do. As
GaskiU, Van Auken, and Manning (1993)
state: "There are many studies to better
understand business success versus fail-
ure. However, there are many questions
still to be resolved that warrant addi-
tional exploration ... previous studies do
DEMO provide a comprehensive or unified
explanation for small firm failure ...

ment, for his helpful input to this article.

comparisons DEMO needed between suc-
cessful and failed small business own-
ers." Prior DEMO studies of failure
have concentrated almost exclusively on
financial ratio data, DEMO studies of
failure usually cite managerial variables
as being critical (Scherr DEMO). The use-
fulness of ratio-based business failure
prediction models has been questioned
(Alves 1978; Corman and Lussier 1991;
Gilbert, Menon, DEMO Schwartz 1990;
Shelton 1986; Stockton 1989; Sommers
and Koc 1987). For example, El-Zayaty
(1986) found ratio models to be poor pre-
dictors of bankruptcy: in his research of
132 businesses predicted to fail, only 5
were discontinued over a five-year per-
iod. Storey et al. (1987) indicated that
qualitative data can provide at least as
DEMO predictions as traditional financial
ratios.
This study is not based on financial ra-
tios, but on the quantitative and qualita-
tive managerial factors that may
contribute to success or failure. Tb date,
the author has DEMO only a few major
nonratio empirical studies: Cooper et al.
(1990, 1991); Reynolds (1987); and Rey-
nolds and Miller (1989). While these
studies are pathbreaking, more research
is needed. For example, the Reynolds
and Miller model cannot predict failure
of a business before it starts because the
age of the business and the first year
DEMO of Small Business Management
sales are factors in the model to predict
failure.
The Cooper et DEMO study provides a
point of departure for this research. The
m^or differences between this study
and the Cooper et al. study are: (1) their
sample includes businesses 1 to 3 years
old whereas this sample DEMO ages 1
to 10; (2) their sample was limited to
DEMO of the National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB) while this
sample is not; (3) they do not survey
failed businesses while this study does;
and (4) their sample does not include
matched DEMO whereas this design does.
They first surveyed existing firms; after
a DEMO or longer, some of the firms failed.
At that time, they compared the re-
sponses of the failed firms and the sur-
viving DEMO to analyze the differences
without ever questioning the failures to
ask them why they failed. Further, there
were no controls for size, industry, or lo-
cation. The matched pairs design of this
study avoids comparing DEMO busi-
nesses to smaller ones, retailers to man-
ufacturers or construction DEMO,
and businesses from different locations,
considered business failures: they DEMO
discontinued businesses. Tb be consid-
ered a success the business must make at
least industry-average profits. A young
firm is defined as being between DEMO to 10
years old.
METHODOLOGY
There is no generally accepted list of
variables for use in forecasting business
success or failure. Prior research has DEMO
ported different variables as contribut-
ing factors to success or failure. The two
most commonly stated distinguishing
variables are capital and management
experience. However, in 20 journal artic-
les (see table 1) only 14, or 70 percent of
the articles, specifically state that these
two variables contribute to success ver-
sus failure, lb help clarify prior research
results, DEMO study tests each of the 15
major variables identified in 20 journal
articles as contributing to success versus
failure. See table 1 for a DEMO of
the 20 studies that support, do not sup-
pori, or do not mention each variable,
and table 2 for an explanation DEMO the 15
variables.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The Model Variables
The purpose of this research was to de-
velop and test a generic nonfinancial
DEMO that will predict a young business
s success or failure. The study also an-
swers the question, "Do successful and
failed businesses start DEMO equal re-
sources?"
This study adopts Dun & Bradstreet's
(1993) definitions of failure and discon-
tinuance. Business failures are defined
as firms involved in court proceedings or economic timing, age of owner,
voluntary actions which result in losses + +

Record keeping and financial control (rkfc). Businesses DEMO do not keep updated and accurate
records and do not use adequate financial controls have a greater chance of failure than firms that do.
DEMO Experience (inex). Businesses managed by people without prior industry experience

Management Experience (maex). Businesses managed by people without prior management ex-
perience have a greater chance of failure than firms that DEMO managed by people with prior manage-
ment experience.
Planning (plan). DEMO that do not develop specific business plans have a greater chance of
failure than firms that do.
Professional Advisors (prad). Businesses that do not use professional advisors have a greater
chance of failure than firms DEMO professional advisors.
Education (educ). People without any college education who DEMO a business have a greater
chance of failure than people with one or more years of college education.
Staffing (staff). Businesses that cannot attract and retain quality employees have a greater
chance of failure than DEMO that can,
Product/Service Timing (psti). Businesses that select DEMO/services that are too new or too
old have a greater chance of failure than firms that select products/services that are In the DEMO
stage.
Economic Timing (ecti). Businesses that start during a recession DEMO a greater chance of failure
than firms that start during expansion periods.
Age (age). Younger people who start a business have a greater chance of failure than older people
starting a business.
Partners (part), A business started by one person has a greater chance of failure DEMO a firm
started by more than one person.
Parents (pent). DEMO owners whose parents did not own a business have a greater chance of
faiiure than owners whose parents did own a business.
Minority (mior). Minorities have a greater chance of failure than nonminorities.
Marketing (mrkt). Business owners without marketing skills have a greater chance of failure DEMO
owners with marketing skills.

SAMPLING METHODOLOGY
The sample was limited to six New En-
gland states: Connecticut, Maine, Massa-
chusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
and Vermont, The failure sample was
generated from the bankruptcy court re-
cords. The population of failed businesses
includes Chapter 7 and 11 DEMO
Due to difficulties in locating liquidated
business owners the questionnaire was
mailed to only Chapter 11 companies.
The questionnaire was first mailed to
each DEMO/CEO of a failed business in
the year in which they fUed for Chapter
11. A foUow-up mailing was made to ini-
tial nonrespondents. DEMO matched sample
of nonfailed firms was also developed.
Matching was selectively based on size
(number of employees), age (all firms are
ten DEMO old or less), location (same state
and city, or city close by), and industry
(same Dun & Bradstreet classification) to
DEMO relevant comparisons. The ques-
tionnaire was then mailed to each failed
respondent's successful company match.
The combined response rate was 39 per-
cent. DEMO total of 216 usable questionnaires
were returned and analyzed: 108 from
DEMO and 108 from successful firm
owners.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL RESULTS
The questionnaires returned included
approximately 20 percent from Con-
DEMO, 5 percent Maine, 44 percent
Massachusetts, 19 percent New Hamp-
DEMO, 9 percent Rhode Island, and 6 per-
cent Vermont. The mean age of the
failed and successful firms was 5.5 and
5.8 years. DEMO mean, median, and mode
of the number of employees for the
failed and successful firms were 25.33,
15.00, 5.00; and 22.22, 8.00, 2.00, re-
spectively. Industry representation (as
classified by Dun & Bradstreet) includes
approximately: 2 percent agriculture, 14
percent construction, 17 DEMO fi-
nance, 10 percent manufacturing, 22
percent retailing, 3 percent DEMO,
6 percent transportation and communi-
cation, and 25 percent services. DEMO a
comparison of the descriptive statistics
and measurement of the 15 variables in
the model see table 3.
Sample Representation
Tb ensure that the DEMO represented
the population, a comparison was made
of the sample failure DEMO distribu-
tions to the faUure population by state
and industry. The population figures in-
clude Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 failures
(Dun & Bradstreet 1993). Using chi-
square tests, there were no significant
differences. In other words, businesses
in all six states, and all types of DEMO
nesses, are represented by about the
same percentage in the sample DEMO the
population from which they are drawn.
BIVARIATE STATISTICAL RESULTS
Reliability and Vaiidity
Tb increase reliability, the question-
naire was carefully developed through
four pretests. One of the major concerns
of the study was response rate. DEMO
questionnaire's length was limited to in-
crease the response rate; DEMO, a
trade-off was made. Rather than having
several repeat questions, the question-
naire used one open-ended question to
check reliability. There was only DEMO
nonreliable response; therefore, reliabil-
ity is inferred.
Correlation analysis was run to assess
the degree of multicolinearity among
the 15 variables. The correlation DEMO
(table 4) shows that most of the correla-
tions are relatively low. While some of
the correlations are significant, of the
105 correlations only 2 are greater than
.50 and 13 are greater than .20.
DEMO Bias
Nonresponse bias was minimized in
this study by following up initial nonre-
spondents and by comparing statisti-
cally the initial nonrespondents' data to
that of the initial respondents to test for
significant differences. Approximately
10 DEMO of the sample is composed of
initial nonrespondents. Of the 15 varia-
bles tested in the model, no responses
were significantly different using t and
chi-square tests.
Test of Differences Between
Successfui and Failed Businesses
The DEMO samples were compared for
significant differences on the 15 varia-
bles (DEMO table 3). These variables were
largely measures of one or more of the
firm's resources, and this test can be in-
terpreted as a comparison of the amount
of resources available to failed and DEMO
faUed firms. Successful and failed busi-
nesses did not have equal starting
resources for 4 out of the 15 variables:
use of professional DEMO (p = .064), ed-
ucation (p=.O44), staffing (p DEMO .OOO),
and parents owned a business (p = .006).

words, the model wiU predict DEMO group of

Classification Accuracy of the Model
How DEMO the model classifies the ob-
served data is a second way to deter-
mine how well the model performs. This
is done by examining DEMO "likely" the
sample results are, given the parameter
estimates. The DEMO was more accurate
at predicting failure than success. The

model correctly predicts 73 percent of
the failed sample and 65 percent of the
successful sample for an overall accu-
DEMO rate of about 70 percent. Since ran-
dom guessing produces a 50 percent
correct classification, the model is ap-
proximately 20 percent more reliable at
classifying a specific business as success-
ful or failed.
Parameter Estimates DEMO
Significant Variables
The appropriate tests for significance
of individual variables in logistic regres-
15
sion are based on the parameter esti-
mates. The parameter section of DEMO 5
contains the estimated beta coefficients
(6) for all 15 variables. Tb test if each co-
efficient is zero, the Wald statistic (DEMO
square of the ratio of the coefficient to
its standard error) DEMO used. The signifi-
cance level for the Wald statistics ap-
pears in the last column of the table. Of
the 15 variables in this DEMO test,
four are significant at the .05 level: plan-
ning, professional advisors, education,
and staffing. Note that parents owning a
business was close to being significant
(p=.0550).
Direction of the Relationship Among
Variabies
Reviewing the bivariate test of differ-
ence between the failed and DEMO
means or frequencies and contrasting
these with the multivariate results aids
in the understanding of the variables
that are significant, and the direction of
the relationship. Bivariate testing re-
vealed that professional advice, educa-
tion, DEMO, and "parents" were
significantly different between the suc-
cessful and DEMO businesses. In the
model, however, planning was signifi-
cant and parents were not. Planning
may be significant because it is correl-
ated with DEMO advisors (p < .001,
see table 4), parents may DEMO dropped
in significance because it was collinear
with education {R= .16, DEMO < .05).
In the bivariate tests (table 3), one
DEMO that education and staffing were
significantly greater for failed than for
successful firms. This was unexpected,
since it implies that failed firms have
DEMO resources in these areas than
successful firms. But the bivariate
results could have been reversed in mul-
tivariate analysis. These variables could
easily have DEMO positive sign when com-
bined with others. However, that is not
DEMO happened. The signs are also nega-
tive in the multivariate analysis.
16
However, "significant" does not al-
ways mean "important." Statistical
results can be data artifacts, and in-
cluded variables can be collinear with
left-out ones. The mean difference in
education is less than one year; the
mean failed level of education is greater
than three years of DEMO (15.32 years)
whereas the successful mean is less than
three DEMO of college (14.53 years).
Should one conclude that a potential DEMO
trepreneur should stop college after two
years? Perhaps not. This difference DEMO
education may instead indicate the dif-
ference between a college graduate and
a college drop-out. Entrepreneurial re-
search has revealed that many success-
ful DEMO business owners did not do well
in college, and that some DEMO out to
start a business. (Steve Jobs starting Ap-
ple Computer DEMO one obvious example.)
While the negative sign for difficulties
of staffing was not expected, note that
while some might call staff "resources,"
overstaffing is clearly disadvantageous
as it increases the firm's fixed DEMO The
level of difficulty of staffing was mea-
sured subjectively on a scale of 1-7, and
the difference of .76 may be due to
other factors which this study was not
designed to address. The following DEMO
tions about staffing differences are sub-
jects for future research. Are successful
businesses more selective in their hir-
ing? Do they have greater turnover? Do
they use different recruitment methods
than unsuccessful businesses? Are they
DEMO successful because they must
make do with the employees they have?
The negative sign for planning was ex-
pected because of coding of DEMO scores
indicating more detailed planning. The
successful firms in this study developed
more specific plans than did failures (ta-
ble 3), and 11 other authors reported
planning as a contributing factor to suc-
cess (table 1). Therefore, these results
support the hypothesis that business
planning contributes to success.
Journal of Small Business Management
The positive sign for use of profes-
sional advisors was expected. The DEMO
that successful owners made greater use
of professional advisors supports the
need for government and university pro-
grams such as Service Corps of Retired
DEMO (SCORE), Active Corps of Ex-
ecutives (ACE), Small Business Insti-
tute s (SBI), and Small Business

Business Administration (SBA), which is

source of professional advice. In this re-
search, this professional advice is associ-
ated with a decreased likelihood of
business DEMO
USE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL
There are at least seven groups that
can benefit from using the prediction
model developed in this study: entrepre-
neurs, investors, lenders, suppliers, ed-
ucators, consultants, and DEMO policy
makers. Entrepreneurs can assess the
probability of success or failure before
startin g a business . Investor s and
lenders may be able DEMO avoid conducting
business with firms with a high probabil-
ity of failure. Suppliers may decline
credit or limit it to high risk businesses.
Educators DEMO consultants can make
these other groups aware of the model
and help them to use it. Public poUcy
makers can use the model when DEMO
ing assistance either to prevent failure
or to promote further growth.
When the seven groups use the model,
it is important to realize DEMO the model
is not intended to replace existing de-
fault risk prediction techniques. The
model should be employed in coiyunc-
tion with the present DEMO used by
investors, lenders, creditors, and other
groups to avoid DEMO The model does
not provide numerical guidelines for
variables distinguishing success from
failure. Judgment is needed when ap-
plying the model to assign a DEMO
For example, the variable "planning"
states that people starting a firm with a
specific business plan have a greater
chance of success DEMO people without a
specific plan. However, the model nei-
ther defines "specific" nor gives a sam-
ple busines s plan neede d to be
successful.
The prospective entrepreneur must
look at the list of variables DEMO the model
and subjectively assess the strengths of
the proposed business for each variable,
A system of assigning a rating of strong,
DEMO, or weak to each variable can
be used. Then an overall DEMO of strong,
moderate, or weak can be assigned to
the DEMO of success. When a busi-
ness is strong on some variables and
weak on others, the judgmental assign-
ment of a probability of success is more
subjective . The more varie d th e
strengths and DEMO among the
variables, the more subjective is the
judgment in assigning DEMO probability of
success. With mixed strengths on varia-
bles, the other DEMO criteria previ-
ously used by investors, lenders, and
suppliers become increasingly important
when they assign a probability of suc-
cess to a business.
DEMO FOR FURTHER
RESEARCH
Some unanswered questions require
further research. Why are there incon-
sistencies within the literature and dis-
crepancies between the literature and
DEMO study? Almost each of the major
variables identified in the literature DEMO
factors contributing to success or failure
have been rejected by one or more other
existing studies (table 1), Only 4 of the
15 variables were significant in this
study. Capital and management experi-
ence constitute DEMO major areas of dis-
crepancy between the literature and
this study. Fourteen of the twenty artic-
les support these variables as distin-
guishing factors DEMO success or
failure. However, these two variables
January 1995
17
were not significant in this study.
In this study, planning, professional
DEMO, education, and staffing were
significant predictors of success or fail-
ure. Of the 20 journal articles reviewed,
only Cooper et al. (1990,1991), Reynolds
(1987), and Reynolds and Miller (1989)
DEMO nonfinancial empirically
tested predictive models. Planning was
the only consistently significant varia-
ble in both their models and this one.
The use of professional DEMO was also
significant in the Cooper model, hut it
was not DEMO in the Reynolds model.
Level of education was significant in the
1991 Cooper et al. study, but not in the
1990 Cooper et al. study. In the Reynolds
model (1987) education was not tested.
However, in Reynolds and Miller (1989) it
was insignificant. Staffing was not
DEMO in the Cooper et al. (1990, 1991)
models, and DEMO was not significant in the
Reynolds and Miller (1987,1989) models.
With the discrepancies among studies,
further model testing is needed to DEMO
vide reliability and validity. This study
could be duplicated in other regions of
the country. Investors, lenders, and sup-
pliers can conduct research DEMO incorpo-
rate this model with their techniques.
They may be able to incorporate the
model into their default methods to im-
prove the accuracy DEMO their predicting a
business as successful or failed.
CONCLUSION
Do successful and failed businesses
start with equal resources? The answer
is no; successful DEMO faUed businesses
did not have equal starting resources on
4 out of the 15 variables. Successful
firms made greater use of professional
advice and DEMO more specific
business plans; failures had more educa-
tion and less DEMO staffing.
In this study, a generic nonfinancial
model was developed and DEMO The
business success versus failure predic-
tion model developed in this study wUl
reliably outperform random classifica-
tion of a group of businesses as DEMO
ful or failed over 99 percent of the time.
The model wUl accurately predict the
success or failure of a specific business
approximately 70 DEMO of the time.
The general implication of this study is
that through the use of the model the ac-
curacy of predicting business success
DEMO failure can be improved.
