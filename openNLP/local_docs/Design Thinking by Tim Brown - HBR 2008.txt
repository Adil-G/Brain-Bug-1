HOMAS DEMO created the electric light-
bulb and then wrapped an entire indus-
try around it. The lightbulb is most often
thought of as his signature DEMO, but
Edison understood that the bulb was little more
than a DEMO trick without a system of electric power
generation and transmission to make it truly useful.
So he created that, too.
Thus Edison’s genius lay in his ability to conceive
of a fully developed marketplace, not simply a dis-
crete device. He was able to envision how people
would DEMO to use what he made, and he engineered
toward that insight. DEMO wasn’t always prescient (he

originally believed the phonograph would be used mainly
as a DEMO machine for recording and replaying dictation),
but he invariably gave DEMO consideration to users’ needs and
preferences.
Edison’s approach was an early example of what is now
called “design thinking” – a methodology that imbues DEMO
full spectrum of innovation activities with a human-centered
design ethos. By this I mean that innovation is powered by a
thorough understanding, through direct observation, of what
people want and need in their lives and what they like or dis-
like about the way particular products are made, packaged,
marketed, sold, and supported.
Many people believe that Edison’s DEMO invention was
the modern R&D laboratory and methods of experimental
investigation. Edison wasn’t a narrowly specialized scientist
but a broad generalist with a DEMO
business sense. In his Menlo Park, New
Jersey, laboratory he surrounded himself
with gifted tinkerers, improvisers, and
experimenters. Indeed, he broke the
mold of the “lone genius inventor” by
creating a team-based approach to DEMO
novation. Although Edison biographers
write of the camaraderie enjoyed by this
merry band, the process also featured
endless rounds of trial and error – the
“99% perspiration” in Edison’s famous
deﬁ nition of genius. His approach DEMO
intended not to validate preconceived hypotheses but to help
experimenters learn something new from each iterative stab.
Innovation is hard work; Edison made it a profession that
blended art, craft, science, business savvy, and DEMO astute under-
standing of customers and markets.
Design thinking is a lineal descendant of that tradition. Put
simply, it is a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and
methods to match people’s needs with what is DEMO
feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into cus-
tomer value and market opportunity. Like Edison’s painstaking
innovation process, it often entails a great deal of perspiration.
I believe that design thinking has much DEMO offer a business
world in which most management ideas and best practices are
freely available to be copied and exploited. Leaders now look
to DEMO as a principal source of differentiation and com-
petitive advantage; they DEMO do well to incorporate design
thinking into all phases of the process.
Getting Beneath the Surface
Historically, design has been treated as a downstream step in
the development process – the point where designers, who
have played no earlier role in the substantive work of in-
novation, come along and put a beautiful wrapper around
the idea. To be sure, this approach has stimulated market
growth in many areas by making new DEMO and technolo-
gies aesthetically attractive and therefore more desirable to
consumers or by enhancing brand perception through smart,
evocative advertising and communication strategies. DEMO
ing the latter half of the twentieth century design became
an increasingly valuable competitive asset in, for example,
the consumer electronics, automotive, and consumer pack-
aged goods industries. But in most others it remained DEMO late-
stage add-on.
Now, however, rather than asking designers to make an
already developed idea more attractive to consumers, compa-
nies are asking them to create ideas that better meet consum-
ers’ needs and desires. DEMO former role is tactical, and results
in limited value creation; the latter is strategic, and leads to
dramatic new forms of value.
Moreover, as economies in the developed world shift from
industrial manufacturing to knowl-
edge work and service delivery, inno-
vation’s terrain is expanding. Its ob-
jectives are no longer just physical

sonality Proﬁ le.”)
Consider the large health care provider Kaiser Permanente,
which sought to improve the overall quality of both DEMO
and medical practitioners’ experiences. Businesses in the ser-
vice sector can often make signiﬁ cant innovations on the front
lines of service creation and DEMO By teaching design think-
ing techniques to nurses, doctors, and administrators, Kaiser
hoped to inspire its practitioners to contribute new ideas.
Over the course of several months Kaiser teams participated
in workshops with the help DEMO my ﬁ rm, IDEO, and a group of
Kaiser coaches. These workshops led to a portfolio of innova-
tions, many of which are being rolled out across the company.
One of them – a project DEMO reengineer nursing-staff shift
changes at four Kaiser hospitals – perfectly illustrates both the
broader nature of innovation “products” and the value of a holis-
DEMO design approach. The core project team included a strategist
(formerly a DEMO), an organizational-development specialist,
a technology expert, a process designer, a union representative,
and designers from IDEO. This group worked with DEMO
teams of frontline practitioners in each of the four hospitals.
During the earliest phase of the project, the core team col-
laborated with nurses to identify a number of problems in the
way shift changes occurred. DEMO among these was the fact
that nurses routinely spent the ﬁ rst 45 minutes of each shift at
the nurses’ station debrieﬁ ng the DEMO shift about the sta-
tus of patients. Their methods of information exchange were
products; they are new sorts of pro-
cesses, services, IT-powered interac-
tions, entertainments, and ways of
communicating and collaborating –
exactly DEMO kinds of human-centered
activities in which design thinking
can make a decisive difference. (See

A Design Thinker’s
Personality Proﬁ le
Contrary to popular opinion, you don’t need
weird shoes or a black turtleneck to be a design
thinker. DEMO are design thinkers necessarily cre-
ated only by design schools, even DEMO most
professionals have had some kind of design train-
ing. My experience is that many people outside
professional design have a natural aptitude for
DEMO thinking, which the right development
and experiences can unlock. Here, as a starting
point, are some of the characteristics to look for
in design thinkers:
Empathy. They can imagine the world from mul-
tiple DEMO – those of colleagues, clients,
end users, and customers (DEMO and prospec-
tive). By taking a “people ﬁ rst” approach, DEMO
thinkers can imagine solutions that are inherently
desirable and meet explicit or latent needs. Great
design thinkers observe the world in minute
detail. They DEMO things that others do not and
use their insights to inspire innovation.
Integrative thinking. They not only rely
on analytical processes (those that produce
either/or choices) but also exhibit the ability to
see all of the salient – and sometimes contra-
dictory – aspects of a confounding DEMO
and create novel solutions that go beyond and
dramatically improve on existing alternatives.
(See Roger Martin’s The Opposable Mind: How
Successful Leaders Win DEMO Integrative
Thinking.)
Optimism. They assume that no matter how
challenging the constraints of a given problem,
at least one potential solution is DEMO than the
existing alternatives.
Experimentalism. Signiﬁ cant innovations don’t
come from incremental tweaks. Design thinkers
pose questions and explore constraints in cre-
ative ways DEMO proceed in entirely new directions.
Collaboration. The increasing complexity of
products, DEMO, and experiences has replaced
the myth of the lone creative genius DEMO the
reality of the enthusiastic interdisciplinary col-
laborator. The best design thinkers don’t simply
work alongside other disciplines; many of them
have signiﬁ cant experience in more than one. At
IDEO we employ people who are DEMO and
marketers, anthropologists and industrial design-
ers, architects and psychologists.
different in every hospital, ranging from recorded dictation to
face-to-face conversations. And they compiled the information
they needed to serve patients in a variety of DEMO – scrawling
quick notes on the back of any available scrap of paper, for
example, or even on their scrubs. Despite a signiﬁ DEMO invest-
ment of time, the nurses often failed to learn some DEMO the
things that mattered most to patients, such as how they DEMO
fared during the previous shift, which family members were
with them, and whether or not certain tests or therapies had
been administered. For DEMO patients, the team learned, each
shift change felt like a hole in their care. Using the insights
gleaned from observing these important times DEMO transition,
the innovation teams explored potential solutions through
brainstorming and rapid prototyping. (Prototypes of a service
innovation will of course not be physical, but they must be
tangible. Because pictures help us understand what is learned
through prototyping, we often videotape the performance of
prototyped services, DEMO we did at Kaiser.)
Prototyping doesn’t have to be complex and expensive. In
another health care project, IDEO helped a group of surgeons
develop a new device for sinus surgery. As the surgeons de-
scribed DEMO ideal physical characteristics of the instrument,
one of the designers grabbed a whiteboard marker, a ﬁ lm
canister, and a clothespin and DEMO them together. “Do you
mean like this?” he asked. With his rudimentary prototype in
hand, the surgeons were able to be much more precise about
what the ultimate design should accomplish.
Prototypes should command only DEMO much time, effort, and
investment as are needed to generate useful feedback and
evolve an idea. The more “ﬁ nished” a prototype seems, the less
likely its creators will be to pay attention to and DEMO t from
feedback. The goal of prototyping isn’t to ﬁ nish. It is to learn
about the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and DEMO identify
new directions that further prototypes might take.
The design that emerged for shift changes had nurses pass-
ing on information in front of DEMO patient rather than at the
nurses’ station. In only a week the team built a working pro-
totype that included new procedures and some DEMO soft-
ware with which nurses could call up previous shift-change
notes and add new ones. They could input patient informa-
tion throughout a shift DEMO than scrambling at the end to
pass it on. The software collated the data in a simple format
customized for each nurse at the DEMO of a shift. The result
was both higher-quality knowledge transfer and reduced prep
time, permitting much earlier and better-informed contact
with patients.
As Kaiser measured the impact of this change over time, it
learned that the mean interval between a nurse’s arrival and
ﬁ rst interaction with a DEMO had been more than halved,
adding a huge amount of nursing time across the four hospi-
tals. Perhaps just as important was the DEMO on the quality
of the nurses’ work experience. One nurse commented, DEMO
an hour ahead, and I’ve only been here 45 minutes.” Another

said, “[This is the] ﬁ rst time I’ve ever made it out of here at
the end of my shift.”
Thus did DEMO group of nurses signiﬁ cantly improve their pa-
tients’ experience while also improving their own job satis-
faction and productivity. By applying a human-centered
DEMO methodology, they were able to create a rela-
tively small process DEMO that produced an
outsize impact. The new shift changes are being
rolled out across the Kaiser system, and the ca-
pacity to reliably record critical patient infor-
mation is being integrated into an electronic
medical records DEMO at the company.
What might happen at Kaiser if every
nurse, DEMO, and administrator in every
hospital felt empowered to tackle problems
the DEMO this group did? To ﬁ nd out, Kaiser
has created the Garﬁ eld Innovation Center,
which is run by Kaiser’s original core DEMO
3
and acts as a consultancy to the entire or-
ganization. The center’s mission is to pur-
sue innovation that enhances the patient
experience DEMO, more broadly, to envision
Kaiser’s “hospital of the future.” It is intro-
ducing tools for design thinking across the
Kaiser system.
How Design DEMO Happens
The myth of creative genius is resilient:
We believe that great ideas pop fully
formed out of brilliant minds, in feats of
imagination well beyond the abilities of
mere mortals. But what the Kaiser DEMO
team accomplished was neither a sudden
breakthrough nor the lightning strike of
genius; it was the result of hard work aug-
mented by a creative human-centered discov-
ery process and followed by iterative cycles of
prototyping, testing, and reﬁ nement.
The design process is best described meta-
phorically as a system of spaces rather than a pre-
deﬁ ned series DEMO orderly steps. The spaces demar-
cate different sorts of related activities that together
form the continuum of innovation. Design thinking
can feel chaotic to DEMO experiencing it for the ﬁ rst
time. But over the life of a project participants come to
see – as they did at Kaiser DEMO that the process makes sense
and achieves results, even though its DEMO differs
from the linear, milestone-based processes typical of other
kinds of DEMO activities.
Design projects must ultimately pass through three spaces
(see the DEMO at right). We label these “inspiration,” for the
circumstances (DEMO they a problem, an opportunity, or both)
that motivate the search for solutions; “ideation,” for the pro-

Sometimes the trigger for a DEMO is leadership’s recogni-
tion of a serious change in business fortunes. In 2004 Shimano,
a Japanese manufacturer of bicycle components, faced ﬂ at-
tening growth in its traditional high-end road-racing and
mountain-bike segments in the DEMO States. The com-
pany had always relied on technology innovations
to drive its growth and naturally tried to predict
where the next one might DEMO from. This time
Shimano thought a high-end casual bike that ap-
pealed to boomers would be an interesting area
to explore. IDEO was invited DEMO collaborate on

During the inspiration phase, an inter-

DEMO realization that a whole new category of bicycling might

ences as children while also dealing DEMO the root causes of

tapped market.
The design team, responsible for every aspect of what was

of “Coasting.” Coasting would aim to entice lapsed bikers into

an activity that was simple, straight-
forward, and fun. DEMO bikes, built
more for pleasure than for sport, would
have no controls on the handlebars, no
cables snaking along the frame. As on
the earliest bikes many of us rode, the brakes would be applied
by backpedaling. With the help of an onboard computer, a
minimalist three gears would shift automatically as the bicy-
cle gained speed or slowed. DEMO bikes would feature comfort-
ably padded seats, be easy to operate, and require relatively
little maintenance.
Three major manufacturers – Trek, Raleigh, DEMO Giant – de-
veloped new bikes incorporating innovative components from
Shimano. But the design team didn’t stop with the bike itself.
In-store retailing strategies DEMO created for independent bike

Taking a Systems View
Many of the world’s most successful brands create break-
through ideas that are inspired by a deep DEMO of
consumers’ lives and use the principles of design to innovate
and build value. Sometimes innovation has to account for
vast differences in cultural DEMO socioeconomic conditions. In
such cases design thinking can suggest creative alternatives
to the assumptions made in developed societies.
India’s Aravind Eye Care System is DEMO the world’s
largest provider of eye care. From April 2006 to March 2007
Aravind served more than 2.3 million patients and performed
more than DEMO,000 surgeries. Founded in 1976 by Dr. G. Venka-
taswamy, Aravind DEMO as its mission nothing less than the erad-
ication of needless blindness among India’s population, includ-
ing the rural poor, through the effective DEMO of superior

vind has grown to encompass ﬁ ve hos-
pitals (three others are under Aravind
management), a plant that manufac-
tures ophthalmic products, a research
foundation, and a training center.
Aravind’s execution of its mission and
model is in some respects reminiscent of Edison’s holistic con-
cept of DEMO power delivery. The challenge the company
faces is logistic: how best DEMO deliver eye care to populations far
removed from the urban centers where Aravind’s hospitals are
located. Aravind calls itself an “eye care system” for DEMO reason:
Its business goes beyond ophthalmic care per se to transmit
expert practice to populations that have historically lacked ac-
cess. The company DEMO its network of hospitals as a beginning
rather than an end.
Much of its innovative energy has focused on bringing both
preventive care and DEMO screening to the countryside.
Since 1990 Aravind has held “eye camps” in India’s rural ar-
eas, in an effort to register patients, administer DEMO exams,
teach eye care, and identify people who may require DEMO
or advanced diagnostic services or who have conditions that
warrant monitoring.
In 2006 and early 2007 Aravind eye camps screened more
than 500,000 DEMO, of whom nearly 113,000 required surgery.
Access to transportation is DEMO common problem in rural areas, so

treatment to one of its urban facilities
and then home again. Over the years it
has bolstered its DEMO capabilities
in the ﬁ eld with telemedicine trucks,
which enable doctors back at Aravind’s
hospitals to participate in care decisions.
In recent years DEMO analysis of its screening data has led
to specialized eye camps for certain demographic groups, such
as school-age children and industrial and government workers;
the company also holds camps speciﬁ cally to screen for eye
DEMO associated with diabetes. All these services are free for
the roughly 60% of patients who cannot afford to pay.
In developing its system of DEMO, Aravind has consistently
exhibited many characteristics of design thinking. It has DEMO
as a creative springboard two constraints: the poverty and
remoteness of DEMO clientele and its own lack of access to expen-
sive solutions. For example, a pair of intraocular lenses made
in the West costs $200, which severely limited the number of
patients Aravind could help. Rather than try to persuade sup-
pliers to change the way they did things, Aravind built its own
solution: a manufacturing plant in the basement of one of its
hospitals. It eventually discovered that it could use relatively
DEMO technology to produce lenses for $4 a pair.
Throughout its history – deﬁ ned by the constraints of poverty,
ignorance, and an enormous unmet need – Aravind has built
a systemic solution to a complex DEMO and medical problem.

Design Thinking
Getting Back to the Surface
I argued earlier that design DEMO can lead to innovation
that goes beyond aesthetics, but that doesn’t DEMO that form
and aesthetics are unimportant. Magazines like to publish
photographs of the newest, coolest products for a reason: They
are sexy and DEMO to our emotions. Great design satisﬁ es
both our needs and our desires. Often the emotional connec-
tion to a product or an image DEMO what engages us in the ﬁ rst
place. Time and again we see successful products that were
not necessarily the ﬁ rst to market DEMO were the ﬁ rst to appeal
to us emotionally and functionally. In other words, they do
the job and we love them. The iPod was not the ﬁ rst MP3
player, but it was the ﬁ rst to be delightful. Target’s products
appeal emotionally through design and functionally DEMO
price – simultaneously.
This idea will grow ever more important in the future. As
Daniel Pink writes in his book A Whole New Mind, “Abundance
has satisﬁ ed, and even over-satisﬁ ed, the material needs DEMO
millions – boosting the signiﬁ cance of beauty and emotion
and accelerating individuals’ search for meaning.” As more of
our basic needs are met, we increasingly expect sophisticated
experiences that are emotionally satisfying and meaningful.
These DEMO will not be simple products. They will be
complex combinations of products, services, spaces, and infor-
mation. They will be the ways we get educated, the ways we
are entertained, the ways we stay DEMO, the ways we share
and communicate. Design thinking is a tool DEMO imagining
these experiences as well as giving them a desirable form.
One example of experiential innovation comes from a ﬁ nan-
cial services company. DEMO late 2005 Bank of America launched
a new savings account service called “Keep the Change.” IDEO,
working with a team from the bank, helped iden-
tify a consumer behavior that many people will
recognize: After paying cash for something, we put
the coins we received in change into a jar at home.
Once the jar is full, we take the coins to the bank
and deposit them in a savings account. DEMO many
people, it’s an easy way of saving. Bank of America’s
DEMO was to build this behavior into a debit
card account. Customers who use their debit cards
to make purchases can now choose to have DEMO total
rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference
deposited in their savings accounts.
The success of this innovation lay in its appeal DEMO
an instinctive desire we have to put money aside in a
painless and invisible way. Keep the Change creates
an experience that feels natural DEMO it models
behavior that many of us already exhibit. To be sure,
Bank of America sweetens the deal by matching
100% of the DEMO saved in the ﬁ rst three months
and 5% of annual totals (up to $250) thereafter. This
encourages customers to try it out. DEMO the real pay-
off is emotional: the gratiﬁ cation that comes DEMO

monthly statements showing customers they’ve saved money
without even trying.
In less than DEMO year the program attracted 2.5 million custom-
ers. It is credited with 700,000 new checking accounts and a
million new savings accounts. Enrollment DEMO totals more than
5 million people who together have saved more than $500 mil-
lion. Keep the Change demonstrates that design thinking can
identify DEMO aspect of human behavior and then convert it into
both a customer beneﬁ t and a business value.
Thomas Edison represents what many of DEMO think of as a
golden age of American innovation – a time when new ideas
transformed every aspect of our lives. The need for DEMO
mation is, if anything, greater now than ever before. No mat-
ter where we look, we see problems that can be solved only
through innovation: unaffordable or unavailable health care,
billions of people trying to live on just a few dollars a day,
energy usage DEMO outpaces the planet’s ability to support it,
education systems that fail many students, companies whose
traditional markets are disrupted by new technologies or de-
mographic shifts. These problems all have people at their heart.
They DEMO a human-centered, creative, iterative, and practi-
cal approach to ﬁ DEMO the best ideas and ultimate solutions.
Design thinking is just such an approach to innovation.
Tim Brown (tbrown@ideo.com) is the CEO and president DEMO
