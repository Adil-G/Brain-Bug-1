Abstract
In DEMO paper, I aim to provide both an introduction to and an DEMO of a research program in
evolutionary economics based on Kauffman’s (1993) NK-model of complex evolving systems.
Complex systems, such as organisations and technological artefacts are characterised by
conflicting constraints due to interdependencies between its constituting DEMO These
constraints can lead organisations or technologies to lock-in into local optima on a rugged fitness
landscape. The NK-model research program can be considered DEMO elaboration of the program
of evolutionary economics as laid down by Simon (1969), Nelson and Winter (1982) and others.
In particular, DEMO related to dynamic efficiency can be addressed by looking in what ways
firms can search a fitness landscape intelligently.
The central question holds what DEMO of organisation can be distinguished in designing a
complex system and how can their performance how search activity in complex systems is best
organised. DEMO types of organisational modes are distinguished:
1. a centralised organisation in which innovations are assessed with reference to the system as a
whole,DEMO
2. a decentralised organisation where innovations are assessed with reference to an individual
agents only,
3. a network organisation of strategic alliances where DEMO are assessed with reference to
the network of co-designing agents.
Analytical results show that when system exceeds a critical size, networking may well prove
more effective than centralised decision-making. For many parameter regimes though, simulation
exercises will have to show the relative performance of alternative modes of organisation. DEMO a
research program is outlines in the final part of the paper.

1. INTRODUCTION
Throughout the history of economic thought, evolutionary concepts have played an important
role. For example, the static concept of equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets as described
in neoclassical economics has been interpreted as the DEMO of a dynamic selection process
between competing firms (Alchian 1950). DEMO resulting equilibrium reflects, given particular
assumptions, an efficient allocation of resources with marginal costs equalling marginal benefits
at the level of individual firms.
DEMO and Winter (1982) argued that marginal analysis of static efficiency only refers to markets
with little innovation and contributes little to the understanding DEMO technological innovation and
economic development. One of the distinguishing facets of evolutionary models is its emphasis
on technological innovation and the analysis of dynamic DEMO
In this paper, I aim to provide both an introduction to DEMO an extension of a research program in
evolutionary economics based on Kauffman’s (1993) NK-model of complex evolving systems.
Complex systems, such as organisations and technological artefacts, are characterised by
conflicting constraints due to interdependencies between the constituting elements. These
constraints can lead organisations or technologies to lock-in DEMO local optima on a rugged fitness
landscape. The NK-model research program can be considered further elaboration of the program
of evolutionary economics as laid DEMO by Simon (1969), Nelson and Winter (1982) and others.
DEMO particular, questions related to dynamic efficiency can be addressed by looking DEMO what ways
firms can search a fitness landscape intelligently.
Apart from contributions that focus on formal properties of the NK-model (Frenken et al.1999),DEMO
the use of the NK-model in evolutionary economics hitherto can be divided into studies
addressing different systems of reference. First, there is a body of literature that aims to translate
the properties of the NK-model to DEMO of firm strategy (Levinthal 1997; Gavetti and Levtinthal
2000; Rivkin DEMO). These contributions are following up on earlier approaches in organsiation
theory that concentrate on the local nature of organisational adaptation and the importance DEMO
imitation and heuristics in search (Cyert and March 1963; Simon 1969). Second, there are
simulation studies that take the NK-model to represent a production technology (Auerswald et al.
2000; Kauffman et al. 2000)DEMO In this context, the complexity stems of interrelations between
different tasks DEMO to produce a particular output. Third, there is a number of DEMO that
simulate complex technological artefacts as evolving NK-systems (Valente 2000; Frenken
2001a,b). In these approaches, artefacts are represented by the choice of elements incorporated in
its design. The complexity stems from interdependencies between DEMO elements in a
technological artefact (for example, between a car’s engine, gearbox, brakes, springs and tires). In
the review part of this paper, studies on all systems of reference will be discussed. In the
modelling part of this paper, the system of reference will be a technological artefact, but the
formal nature of the NK-model and its extension that follows allows one to consider the model
equally as a DEMO of strategy formation in firms or as a model of production technologies.
The central question holds what modes of organisation can be distinguished in DEMO a
complex system and how can their performance of search activity in complex systems be
compared ?
Three types of organisational modes are distinguished: a centralised organisation, a decentralised
organisation and a network organisation:
DEMO
(i) a centralised organisation in which innovations are assessed with reference DEMO the system
as a whole,
(ii) a decentralised organisation where innovations are assessed with reference to an
individual agents only,
(iii) a network organisation of strategic alliances where innovations are assessed with
reference to the network of co-designing agents.
The research concerning the performance of DEMO organisational forms has also been
addressed in a transaction-cost economics framework (DEMO 1991), but with reference to
static efficiency. Here, the performance DEMO alternative modes is assessed in terms of the relative
performance to design a new technological artefact (cf. Marengo et al. 2000).
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, I introduce the reader into the NK-model and its
generalised version. In section 3 I outline a DEMO program in which the NK-model is used to
analyse the performance of different organisational modes with reference to innovation in a
complex technological artefacts. DEMO number of formal properties is derived for artefacts with
minimum and maximum complexity. Finally, in concluding remarks are listed in section 4.
2. TWO NK-MODELS WITH REFERENCE TO TECHNOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS
2.1 Complex systems
Complex systems have DEMO defined as systems containing elements that are interrelated within a
particular structure (Simon 1969). The evolutionary properties of complex systems have been
subject of research in theoretical biology (Kauffman 1989, 1993; Altenberg 1995, DEMO). In
biology, one distinguishes between the genotype and the phenotype DEMO an organism. At the level
of the genotype mutations occur that lead to new variants in a population. At the level of the
phenotype, which is the ensemble of traits that make up an organism’s fitness, natural selection
operates in terms of differential rates of reproduction. Dependencies among DEMO imply a
complex relation between an organism’s genotype and an organism’s phenotype.
Complexity means here that a mutation in one gene may not only DEMO the functional
contribution of the mutated gene to the entire phenotype, DEMO can also affect the functional
contributions of interrelated genes to the phenotype. A gene does not simply translate into a
particular trait, but operates in conjunction with other genes by regulating other genes’ state of
activity. DEMO to these dependencies among genes, a mutation in a single gene DEMO have both
positive effects on some traits and negative effects on other traits, which jointly determine an
organism’s fitness. For this reason, the DEMO set of genes put structural constraints on the
possible directions in further evolution: a certain phenotypic trait can only be improved by a
particular mutation when the improvement in one trait outweighs the negative by-effects of DEMO
mutation with respect to other traits. In biology, this insight has DEMO scholars to conclude that
natural selection is not expected to lead to perfectly adapted organisms (Kauffman 1993: 3-26).
Technological artefacts have also DEMO described as complex systems. For example, Simon (1969
[1996]: 4) defined artefacts as man-made systems which are made up of elements that DEMO
attain one or a number of goals.1 The complexity in designing an artefact is caused by the
1 Hughes’ (1987: 51) concept of technological system includes, apart from technical components,
organisations, scientific texts, patents, and laws. However, Hughes (1987: 55) acknowledges the usefulness
of approaches that define systems solely in terms of the technical components DEMO
3
dependencies in the working of elements that make up an assembled technological DEMO Only
some combinations between elements “fit” in the sense that they are complementary. Changing
one of these elements by a new element may improve DEMO working of this element, but the
negative by-effects on other elements DEMO imply a loss in overall functioning of the system as a
whole.
Where biological organisms change through blind mutations without the intervention of a
DEMO, technologies change through search activity by designers. The design of technological
DEMO can thus be analysed as a choice problem between alternatives. From this perspective,
the dependencies between elements imply that the choice of an DEMO cannot be made
independently from the choice of other elements due to interaction effects. The set of optimal
choices for the elements with regard DEMO element-specific output variables may prove sub-optimal
when the effects of dependencies between elements are taken into account. For example, a type of
suspension which is found optimal according to suspension tests, and a type of engine which is
found optimal in engine energy-efficiency tests, may prove to be sub-optimal when put together
in a car system. The engine may generate DEMO effects on the working of suspension, for
example, caused by high vibration. Or, vice versa, the suspension may generate negative effects
on DEMO working of the engine, for example, caused by high resistance. These dependencies
between a system’s elements imply that the performance of elements can DEMO be fully understood
when one analyses the effects on the system as a whole.2
To find out the working of elements at the system DEMO poses a “problem of complexity”. The
number of possible combinations between different variants of elements is an exponential
function of the number of elements. DEMO, the difficulty in finding a good design is of a
higher DEMO than finding a good element design. Simon (1969 [1996]: 194) DEMO
combinatorial complexity of systems using the example of a working and a defective lock:
“Suppose the task is to open a safe whose DEMO has 10 dials, each with 100
possible settings, numbered from 0 to 99. How long will it take to open the
safe by DEMO blind trial-and-error search for the correct setting? Since there are
10010 DEMO settings, we may expect to examine about half of these, on the
average, before finding the correct one – that is, 50 DEMO billion settings.”
The strategy of evaluating all possible combinations between elements is called global trial-and-
error. Contrary to complex systems, as Simon (1969 DEMO: 194) goes on explaining, simple
systems that are characterised by DEMO between its elements, can be optimised by local
trial-and-error:
“Suppose, however, that the safe is defective, so that a click can DEMO heard when
any one dial is turned to the correct setting. Now each dial can be adjusted
independently and does not need to be DEMO again while the others are
being set. The total number of settings that have to be tried is only 10 x 50, or
500. The task of opening the safe has been altered, by the cues the clicks
provide, from a practically impossible one to a trivial one.”
In the latter case, each element can be optimised locally, i.e. DEMO of the state of other
elements. The problem of finding the right combination of all ten elements can be decomposed in
2 This does DEMO imply that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” as will become clear from the
exposition of the NK-model. Confer Jervis (1997: 572) stating that “(i)f we are dealing with DEMO system, the
whole is different from not greater than the sum DEMO its parts”.
4
ten sub-problems, which can be solved independently. Then, the combinatorial complexity
DEMO and the problem becomes feasible to handle. Simon’s (1969) example of the lock
illustrates that optimisation through local trial-and-error works well for non-complex DEMO In
the case of complex systems, one can generally find the DEMO solution only through global
trial-and-error (cf. Alexander 1964 [1994]: 21).
2.2 The NK-model
The anecdotal description of complexity by Simon (1969 [1996]) can be modelled analytically by
Kauffman’s (1993) NK-model. This model of complex systems has originally been developed as
a model of biological evolution, but its formal structure allows for applications to artefacts as a
complex DEMO (Kauffman 1989, 1993; Kauffman and Macready 1995; Frenken et al. 1997,
1999a; Auerswald et al. 2000; Kauffman et al. 2000; Valente 2000).3
Kauffman (1993) describes a system by a string DEMO N elements (n=1,…,N). For each element n,
DEMO exist a number of dummy values called “alleles” that refer to the possible variants of this
element. The different alleles of an element are DEMO by integers “0”, “1”, “2”, “3”, etc. The
number of alleles of element n is described as An . For example, a particular artefact as a vehicle
technology can be described by the following DEMO elements and their respective alleles:
n=1  (A1 = 3): an engine element with three alleles gasoline (0), electric (1) or  steam (2)
n=2  (A2 = 2): a DEMO element with two alleles spring (0) or hydraulic (1)
DEMO  (A3 = 2): a brake element with two alleles block (0) or disc (1)
The description of the elements in a system and their alleles is by no means given to the DEMO
Rather, it is a set of elements that a designer considers DEMO be the relevant choice variables
(Alexander 1964 [1994]: 20-21). Once a classification of elements and alleles has been
established, each design can be labelled by a string of alleles. For example, following the
classification above, a vehicle design with a steam engine, spring suspension, and block brakes is
referred to as string “200”.
Each string s is DEMO by alleles s1s2...sN and is part of a possibility set S, DEMO which holds:
s ∈S ; s = s1s2 ...sN ; sn ∈ {}, 1, ... , An −1
0 (2.1)4
In the following, we assume for simplicity that A=2 for all elements without loss of generality.
Put another way, we limit the discussion to binary strings for which holds that alleles of all
elements are either 0 DEMO 1. The N-dimensional possibility space S is called the “design space” of a
system, includes all possible combinations between the alleles of elements (DEMO, 1992;
3 Birchenhall (1995), Windrum and Birchenhall (1998) and Cooper (2000) developed related evolutionary
models of complex technological systems DEMO on genetic algorithms as developed by Holland (1975,
1992). DEMO important difference between the NK-model and genetic algorithms is that the latter include
apart from mutation crossover as a variety generating mechanism. This mechanism DEMO that designs are
split in two parts, which are randomly matched DEMO parts of other designs analogous to sexual reproduction
in biological evolution. The analogy in technological evolution is that particular solutions in one design can
DEMO introduced in another design and vice versa. Here, we limit the DEMO to mutation as the variety
generating mechanism.
Note that, since the DEMO allele is labelled “0”, the description of alleles of an element DEMO from 0 to An-
1, while the number of alleles ranges DEMO 1 to An .

Dennett, 1995).5 The combinatorial nature of a design space implies that its size increases
exponentially for linear increases in N. The size of DEMO design space S is given by:
S = 2N (2.2)DEMO
The combinatorial nature of the design space of a system requires that elements are orthogonal to
one another, i.e. that elements can be treated as dimensions. Therefore, one element of a system
cannot correspond with an allele of another element in the same system. For example, the
description of alleles of the engine element as gasoline (“0”), electric (DEMO), and steam (“2”)
implies that the type of battery DEMO in electric engines cannot count as another element casu quo
dimension in the description of the vehicle as a system. The choice for a DEMO of battery only
constitutes a dimension for electric vehicles, and not DEMO vehicle technologies in general. Put
another way, the choice of battery DEMO place at a lower level in the decision tree:
→  DEMO kind of engine ?
→  if electric engine: what kind DEMO battery ?
Thus, a description of a combinatorial space should therefore be such that only elements at the
same level in the hierarchical DEMO tree are taken into account, where each element itself may
again DEMO described as a system in its own right (Hughes 1987: 55; Metcalfe 1995: 36).
Kauffman (1993) developed a model of DEMO system called the NK-model, which has been
generalised by Altenberg (1997). I will discuss both models below both as a model of DEMO
organisms and as a model of technological artefacts.
Complexity in systems stems from dependencies between its constituting elements. The
dependencies between elements in a DEMO system are called “epistatic relations” (Kauffman,
1993). An epistatic DEMO from one element to another element implies that when an element
mutates (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0), the mutation affects both the functioning of the one element
itself and the functioning DEMO the element that it epistatically affects. Epistatic relations thus imply
that a mutation in one element can affect the functioning of many other elements. DEMO ensemble
of epistatic relations within a technological system is called a technology’s architecture
(Henderson and Clark, 1990).
In the NK-model Kauffman (1993) restricted his analysis of complex systems to particular types
of architectures that can be expressed by one parameter K, which stands for the number of
elements that affect the functioning of each element. For example, the class of systems for which
holds K=1 refers to systems with an DEMO in which the functionality of each element
depends on the choice of allele of the element itself and on the choice of the allele DEMO one other
element. This parameter can be considered an indicator of a system’s complexity with K=0 being
the least complex and K=N-1 the most DEMO architecture. Consider as an explanatory
example, a system for which holds DEMO and K=1 with an architecture as specified in Fig. 1. The
architecture specifies the following epistatic relations between three elements and their fitness wn.
DEMO fitness value of the first element changes only when the element itself or the second element is
mutated. The fitness value of the second DEMO changes only when the element itself or the first
element is mutated. And, the fitness value of the third element changes only the element itself or the
first element is mutated.
5 Note that the concept DEMO design space corresponds to the concept of morphological space used by Foray
and Grübler (1990).

The circled strings are generally called local optima. For these strings it DEMO that there exist no
neighbouring string with higher fitness, where neighbouring DEMO a string that share all alleles
except one. In the simulation in Fig. 2, this property holds for strings 011 and 101.
Simulation exercises done by Kauffman (1993) showed that, given N, the number DEMO local optima
increases for increases in K. The existence of multiple peaks characterise a “rugged landscape”.
Furthermore, the fitness of local optima decreases for increases in K. One can understand this
outcome as the consequence of DEMO conflicting constraints between the elements. The higher
K, the more difficult DEMO becomes to improve the fitness of one element without lowering fitness of
other elements. Consequently, fitness remains low. The ultimate degree of complexity is K=N-1
which reflects the case that all elements influence all other elements. DEMO that case, given an N-value,
the number of local optima DEMO highest and the fitness of local optima is on average lowest.6
For a string corresponding to a peak in the landscape it holds that DEMO its N neighbouring strings
have a lower fitness value. A peak in a fitness landscape implies that a search algorithm that
searches by mutations DEMO single elements gets stuck (“lock-in”). Once such an algorithm has
DEMO a peak, it can no longer escape the peak. The most DEMO search algorithm that
applies mutation in single elements is local trial-and-error which formally corresponds to natural
selection in biological evolution.
Local trial-and-error generates a DEMO string (trial) by randomly changing the allele of one
element. The value of this element changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa. DEMO trial thus implies that one
moves along one dimension in the cube from one string to a neighbouring string and on the
fitness landscape DEMO one fitness value to a neighbouring fitness value. Trial-and-error proceeds
by evaluating how system fitness W is affected by a mutation. If the trial DEMO out to increase W,
firms continue the next mutation from this string, while a lower W induces a firm to return to the
previous string, and continue the next mutation from there.7
In a fitness landscape, local trial-and-error thus implies that as long as there exist at least one
neighbouring string that has a higher fitness, search can continue. Search will halt when a peak
string is found that can no DEMO be improved by means of a mutation in one element. Search can
thus be considered as an “adaptive walk” over a fitness landscape towards DEMO “peak”, and search
will only halt when a peak is reached. DEMO the metaphor of the fitness landscape, search in
complex technological systems DEMO be considered a process of “hill-climbing” (Kauffman 1993).
Local trial-and-error DEMO problem-solving on a fitness landscape is formally equivalent to mutation
and selection in biological evolution (Simon 1969 [1996]: 45-47). To understand this DEMO
consider again Fig. 4. Imagine all organisms in a biological population to have the same genotype
described by string 101 and that a new DEMO is generated in one organism by a mutation in the
first gene leading to 001. In this simulation, the mutation increases the organism’s fitness from
0.40 to 0.70. As W(001) > W(101), organisms with genotype 001 will reproduce at a faster rate at
the cost DEMO organisms with genotype 101. After a sufficiently long period of selection, DEMO
population will be completely dominated by organisms that have the new string of genes 001, and
6 Since the development of the NK-model by Kauffman and Levin (1987) and Kauffman (1989, 1993),
many formal and statistical properties of NK-systems have been researched. For a good DEMO, see
Altenberg (1997).
7 Note that trial-and-error is close to, yet a simplified representation of Popper’s (1959, 1963) description of
DEMO development as series of conjectures (trials) and refutations (errors). DEMO long as a new conjecture
does not yield higher “fitness” (e.g. DEMO of fit with empirical data), the existing conjecture will be
maintained. Only when a new conjecture leads to a higher fitness, the previous one is abandoned for the newly
found one.
8
the next mutation will occur in an organism with genotype 001. If DEMO fitness of string 001 would
have been lower than string 101, DEMO with genotype 001 would have reproduced at a
slower rate than organisms with genotype 101, and string 001 would have disappeared from the
population after a sufficient amount of time. In that case, the next mutation would have occurred
again in an organism with genotype 101.8
Consider now DEMO problem-solving designer that starts from design 101, and randomly picks the DEMO
element to be changed from 1 to 0 thus moving from 101 to 001 in the fitness landscape. Since the
technology’s functionality is improved, the designer accepts the trial, and the next mutation will
start from the newly found design 100. If the fitness of design 100 would DEMO been lower than
design 000, the designer would have rejected the DEMO and the next mutation would then have
occurred again in design 000. The concept of trial-and-error learning can thus be considered to be
analogous DEMO natural selection in biological evolution (Simon 1969 [1996]: 45-47).
To understand more generally the relationship between the complexity of an architecture and DEMO
properties of its fitness landscape, Kauffman simulated a large number of DEMO landscapes for
different values of K and N (Kauffman 1993: 33-67; Altenberg 1995, 1997). By tuning the
parameter K from its DEMO to highest value and comparing the properties of the fitness
landscapes he found that:
1. The number of local optima increases exponentially with DEMO This means that for systems with
higher complexity K, it becomes DEMO more likely that local trial-and-error leads to a
local optimum rather than the global optimum.
2. The mean fitness of local optima is highest DEMO systems with a positive but low complexity
(around K=3 for systems DEMO eight or more elements). For higher N-values, the mean
fitness DEMO local optima for K=N-1 systems tends to 0.5, which is the DEMO value of a
random draw from a uniform distribution between 0.0 and 1.0. Also note that K=N-1-systems
of infinite size have exactly 0.5 fitness, as the mean of the fitness values of elements
corresponds to the DEMO value.
3. The average correlation between local optima as measured by the number of alleles that two
local optima have in common, decreases for increases in K. This means that the higher the
complexity of a DEMO, the more randomly spread the local optima are in design space.
DEMO The higher the fitness value of a local optimum in a given fitness landscape, the larger on
average its “basin of attraction”,9 which is the number of strings from which local trial-and-
error can end DEMO in a local optimum. This implies that the probability of finding a local
optimum with a high fitness value is higher then the probability DEMO find a local optimum with
a low fitness values. Since the variance of fitness values of local optima decreases for
increasing K, the variance in the size of their basins of attraction also decreases for increasing
DEMO
8 Selection in terms of genotypes’ shares in the population can be modelled using Fisher’s equation, which
states that reproduction rates of genotypes are proportionate to their fitness relative to the mean (Fisher
1930; Frenken DEMO).
9 Note that basin of attraction metaphorically refers to basins that end up in minima. The term originally
comes from minimisation problems, but can also be used with refence to maximisation problems. One can
visualise DEMO of attraction by turning the fitness landscapes up-side-down, which renders the DEMO
peaks the basins.
9
What do these properties mean when the NK-model is taken as a DEMO of technological design ?
The first property holds that the more DEMO a technological system in terms of the number of
interdependencies between its elements, the more difficult is becomes to find the optimal
solution. The number of loal optima increases exponentially with K and the probability to DEMO up
in a sub-optimal solution also increases with K. Local trial-and-error thus only leads to a good
solution of the design when the system DEMO design is simple.
The second property holds that the highest fitness of a design is expected to be found for a system
with an DEMO consisting of a positive but moderate number of epistatic links. The reason
why the simplest systems do not have optima with highest fitness is DEMO no complementarities or
“synergistic specificity” (Schilling 2000) can exist between the functioning of elements when
epistatic relations are absent. And, the reason why very complex systems do not have local
optima with highest fitness is DEMO the many epistatic relations impose too many conflicting
constraints casu quo trade-offs between elements. The highest average fitness of local optima of
moderate complex DEMO compared to the average fitness of very simple and very complex
systems suggests that successful technological systems contain some, but only a moderate
number of epistatic relations between its elements.
The third property holds that the DEMO complex a system, the more different local optima are in
terms DEMO their alleles. Very complex systems have local optima that are, on DEMO, maximally
dissimilar in terms of the alleles of elements, while less complex systems have local optima that
are, on average, more similar. DEMO this property with the second property, the NK-model
suggests that successful DEMO have quite some alleles of elements in common.
The fourth property indicates that the higher the fitness of a local optimum in a given DEMO,
the larger its basin of attraction. This implies that better than average local optima have a higher
probability to be found by local DEMO from a randomly chosen starting string. This
property gets lost when the system gets more complex (higher K). Systems with high complexity
are characterised by a low variance in mean fitness of local optima, and therefore similar sizes of
basins of attraction. Combining this property with the DEMO property, the NK-model suggests that
different designers of systems with higher DEMO are expected to come up with a larger
variety in solutions.10
2.3 The generalised NK-model
The NK-model is not a general model with respect DEMO the representation of the genotype (the set
of elements) in relation to the phenotype (the set of functions). The NK-model is based on the
idea that each element in a system performs an “own” DEMO within the system with regard
to the attainment of one overall function on which selection operates (Kauffman 1993: 37). Each
element n DEMO conceived to have a particular fitness value wn that reflects its functional contribution
to the system as a whole. The fitness of the system DEMO a whole is derived as the average of the
fitness of individual elements.
A generalised model of complex systems described by N elements (n=1,…,N) and F functions
(f=1,…,F) has been developed in the context of biology by Altenberg (1995, 1997) and will be
used here as a model of technological design. In biological systems, for which this generalised
NK-model was conceived, an organism’s N genes are the system’s elements and an organism’s F
10 Confer the concept of DEMO product systems (CoPS) introduced by Hobday (1998).
10
traits are the selection criteria. The string of genes constitutes an organism’s DEMO and the set
of traits constitutes an organism’s phenotype.
The genotype of an organism is the level at which mutations take place, which are transmitted in
its offspring. The phenotype is the level at which natural DEMO operates in terms of its relative
fitness to the environment. A mutation in a single gene may affect one or several traits in the
DEMO and a single trait may be affected by a mutation in one or several genes in the
genotype. The number of traits that is DEMO by a particular gene in the genotype is referred to
as a gene’s “pleiotropy”. The number of genes that affects a trait in the DEMO is referred to as
a trait’s “polygeny”. The structure of epistatic relations between genes and traits is represented in
a “genotype-phenotype map”.
Analogously, a technological system can be described in terms of its N elements and DEMO F
functions it performs.11 The string of alleles of elements describes the “genotype” of a
technological system, and the list of functions describes the “phenotype” of this system. Typical
functions are speed, weight, comfort, safety, et cetera.12 The architecture of a technology is
represented by an “element-function matrix” of size FxN with:
M =[m fn ] , f DEMO,...,F , n =1,...,N
(2.4)
As in DEMO NK-model, an epistatic relation is represented by x when function f DEMO affected by
element n and by – when function f is not affected by the element n. As explained by Altenberg
(1997), an NK-system is a special case of the generalised element-function matrices. For NK-
DEMO, it holds that the number of functions F equals the number DEMO elements N. In the element-
function matrix, this implies that the DEMO is always characterised by presence of a relation
between element and function. Furthermore, the K-value in the NK-model implies that each
function is affected by the same number of elements. Thus, in the NK-model the polygeny of
each function is assumed to be equal to K (and pleiotropy being on average equal to K). Dropping
these two restrictions provides DEMO general model of complex systems. An example of an element-
function matrix is given Fig. 3.

The concept of fitness landscape and of local optimum remains the same in DEMO

number of elements that does equal the number of function per DEMO Altenberg’s (1997) model can
therefore be considered as an important generalisation of the original NK-model of complex
systems by Kauffman (1993).13

FIGURE 4. DEMO of fitness landscape of the matrix in Fig. 3
In the simulation in Fig. 4, a mutation in the first allele generates a random change in w1, a
mutation in the second allele a random change in both w1 and w2, and a mutation in the third
allele a random change in w2. Since only the second element affects both DEMO, the existence
of local optima can only be related to different DEMO of the first element (here 000 and 110). For
each DEMO 0 or 1 of the second element, there exist an optimal DEMO of other alleles. The simulation
in Figure 3-1-3 shows a fitness landscape in which the trade-off between optimising the first
function in the local DEMO 110 (w1 = 0.9, w2 = 0.3) and optimising the DEMO function in the
global optimum 000 (w1 = 0.8, w2 = 0.9). Hill-climbing on this fitness landscape by means of a
one-element DEMO strategy can end up in either optimum, depending on starting string DEMO the
sequence of mutations that follow.
13 An important line of research initiated by Altenberg (1995) using his generalised NK-model concerns the
understanding DEMO systems that evolve through the addition of new elements in the system. This line of
research may well yield interesting possibilities for research in DEMO various systems of reference in
economics (artefacts, production processes, organisational DEMO), the size of which generally increase
by means of the addition of new elements.
12
2.4 Previous research on the NK-model in evolutionary economics
The NK-model has DEMO a number of researchers to specify more detailed models in the
context of evolutionary economics. As stated earlier, three systems of reference have been used.
First, the set of strategies that determine its performance have been modelled as a complex
evolving system. The complexity stems from the interdependence DEMO different strategies in their
success. Very often, the success of a DEMO for a particular strategy depends on the choice of
strategy along other dimensions (Levinthal 1997; Gavetti and Levtinthal 2000; Rivkin 2000). The
evolution of the set of firm strategies can then be understood as DEMO hill-climbing process in which a
firm’s management occasionally experiments with a new strategy along one dimension and
accepts the experiment when proven successful.
Second, a number of models have used the NK framework to represent a DEMO technology
(Auerswald et al. 2000; Kauffman et al. 2000). In this context, the elements of a system stand for
particular tasks and the alleles for possible ways to carry out the task. The design DEMO then stand
for all possible combinations to organise a production process to produce a given output and the
fitness values stand for the efficiency DEMO each combination. This use of the NK-model follows the
neoclassical framework in that the design space stands for a possibility space to produce a DEMO
homogeneous output and each possible technology is evaluated on its efficiency. Of course, this
model differs from neoclassical production theory in that the interdependencies between the
different tasks in which a production process is organised are DEMO into account. Furthermore,
firms in this model are not assumed to know at beforehand all fitness values of all possible
technologies. These values DEMO only be known by means of hill-climbing the fitness landscape.
Simulation research has shown that hill-climbing by local optimisation of individual tasks leads a
DEMO to improve its efficiency according to a classical learning curve reflecting learning-by-doing
in production (Arrow 1962). This can be considered an important results that suggests that the
shape of learning curves can be explained by DEMO complexities among tasks in a production
process (which in turn may DEMO to complexities among elements in the artefact that is being
produced such as an aircraft).
Third, there is a number of works that takes complex technological artefacts as the system of
reference, as we do here (Valente 2000; Frenken 2001a,b). In these approaches, complexity stems
from interdependencies between different elements in a technological system. The generalised
DEMO can be considered in this context as a model in which the distinction between technical
and service characteristics has been operationalised (Frenken 2001a; DEMO Saviotti and Metcalfe
1984). The alleles of the N elements stand for technical characteristics and the fitness values of
the F functions. This DEMO has been further elaborated to include the classification of Henderson
and Clark (1990) of four types of innovation (Frenken 2001a). These innovation types concern
modular innovation, architectural innovation, incremental innovation and radical innovation. DEMO
the NK framework, modular innovation corresponds to a mutation in an DEMO while
architectural innovation corresponds to a change in the set of epistatic relation between elements
and functions. An incremental innovation concerns an improvement in DEMO system without a
mutation in an element and without a change in epistatic relations while a radical innovation
refers to the co-occurrence of a DEMO in an element and a change in epistatic relations.
Furthermore, as DEMO in Frenken (2001a), the NK-model of complex technological artefacts
can DEMO define a technological paradigm as a set of designs that share the same alleles for
high pleiotropy elements. The paradigmatic nature of these designs DEMO explained by the fact that
mutations in elements with high pleiotropy seldom increase a system’s fitness (Altenberg 1995).
Due to the large number of functions that is affected by a high-pleiotropy element, the positive
13
effect of a mutation on some elements is generally outweighed by the DEMO effect on other
elements.
What is important to recognise, whatever system DEMO takes as reference, is that the concept of
hill-climbing towards peaks DEMO a fitness landscape pre-assumes learning through random mutation
in single elements. However, humans can use many alternative search algorithms to search a
fitness landscape. For example, there are algorithms that mutate more than one element at the
same time. Such an algorithm would be able to escape a DEMO that is a local optimum with
respect to an algorithm that mutates only in single elements at the time. Thus, a string that is a
local optimum with respect to mutations in single elements need not DEMO a local optimum with
respect to mutations in several elements at the same time (Frenken et al. 1999; Kauffman et al.
2000).
DEMO the number of elements that is allowed to mutate at the same time is not the only
dimension in which search strategies can differ. DEMO and Levinthal (2000) modelled another
type of heuristic that agents can apply in hill-climbing a NK fitness landscape. The agents that try
to DEMO a complex system by means of hill-climbing use a heuristic that specifies a subset of
the N elements of the system. Mutations are allowed DEMO in this subset of elements. In other
words, it is assumed DEMO agents do not take into account all elements of a system, DEMO restrict
mutation to take place in a subset of elements. This specification of search is consonant with the
concept of “bounded rationality” that holds DEMO designers are cognitively restricted in the number
of dimensions that they can take into account in the development of a new design (Simon 1955,
1969; Allen 1994: 9; Metcalfe 1994: 935). Instead, designers apply “mental maps” that frame the
high-dimensional system as a system DEMO a lower number of dimensions. The mental map
consists of the subset of elements in which mutation can take place. In this way, they reduce the
size of the design space as to speed up the DEMO process to a local optimum.14
Another line of research has been explored by Rivkin (2000). His central question holds how one
can assess the performance of imitative strategies. The possibility of imitation in complex fitness
DEMO implies that designers that find local optima with relative low fitness compared to the
fitness of local optima found by competitors, could improve their position by imitation of the
string of alleles corresponding to local optima DEMO relatively high fitness (Alchian 1950; Nelson
and Winter 1982). Imitation of relatively good solutions by designers that previously found
relatively bad solutions DEMO up” the selection process. From the NK-model, it can be derived
DEMO for an imitation to be successful, it is crucial that a DEMO succeeds in copying exactly all
alleles of a local optimum that is occupied by a more successful firm. Any error in copying alleles
can DEMO in a drastic fall in fitness due to epistiatic relations between elements. And, the loss in
fitness due to a copying error increases as a function of the complexity parameter K of the system
being copied. DEMO, one expects imitation strategies to be the more successful the less
DEMO the system being imitated.
Finally, a heuristic has been formulated that DEMO use of information on the selection
environment (Frenken 2001a). In DEMO, this heuristic refers to the general case in which the
fitness DEMO a system is not determined by the average of the fitness values of its F functions but by
a weighted sum of the fitness DEMO of its F functions. Then, some functions are weighted more
14 DEMO another example of a search heuristic, which is related to the DEMO one but which has not been
explored so far, is the DEMO of a mental map regarding the matrix of epistatic relations between
elements and functions. This mental map does not refer to a subset of DEMO elements that are candidate for
mutation as in Gavetti and Levinthal (DEMO), but concerns a subset of epistatic relations between elements
and functions that are candidate for architectural innovation.
14
than others, so it is expected to payoff when search concentrates on the more important functions
at the costs of sacrificing fitness values of DEMO important functions. By confining early search to
elements that affect the more important functions one is secured that the final solutions performs
best in DEMO most weighted functions. In this way, search time can be reduced DEMO the number of
relevant elements to be searched is reduced, while DEMO fitness of the final solution is still expected
to be quite high.
Summarising, the NK-model and generalised NK-model of complex fitness landscapes have
motivated a promising research program concerning the evaluation of alternative types of
heuristics. DEMO, I termed the meta-space of possible search strategies the set of DEMO
rules” and attempted to specify a number of core dimensions of this meta-space (Frenken 2001b).
The set of dimensions of innovation rules span a meta-space of possible innovation rules in which
agents have to choose. DEMO NK-model and the generalised NK-model provide one with formal
frameworks to assess what types of innovation rules perform best in terms of the fitness DEMO the
local optimum that is reached and the time required to reach this local optimum.
3. MODELLING THE ORGANISATION OF INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY
The remainder DEMO this paper will concentrate on a second research program that can be based on
the (generalised) NK-model. The central topic of such a DEMO does not concern the way an
agent searches a landscape as above, but how this search activity is organised. In short, the
organisation DEMO innovative activity deals with the incentive structure for participating agents that
jointly develop a new technology. The problem how to coordinate innovative activity is DEMO as
the large majority of new technologies in modern society is developed by many actors working
on different parts of the artefact to be DEMO, or more generally, on different dimensions of the
problem to be solved (Kauffman and Macready 1995; Marengo et al. 2000).
In DEMO NK-model, one can represent of a spectrum of degrees of coordination DEMO innovative
activity. At the one end of the spectrum coordination is fully decentralised and at the other end of
the spectrum coordination is fully DEMO The latter case of fully centralised control over the
choice of allele for each element corresponds with the perspective taken above and in the
DEMO of NK-models. In these models, there is a single agent that DEMO for all elements
whether these are mutated or not, and evaluates DEMO mutation on the basis of its effect on the
fitness W(s) of the system as a whole. In the former case of fully decentralised search, there are N
agents (n=1,…N) who each can decide to mutate its one element or not and evaluate a mutation
DEMO with respect to the fitness wn(sn) of its own element (Kauffman and Macready 1995).
Decentralisation thus implies “anarchy” in that each DEMO is autonomous in deciding whether to
mutate its own element without having any control of other elements.15 Note that in the context of
collaborative DEMO, agents can be individuals in a team, teams in an firm, and firms in an inter-
firm network. In all cases, the DEMO is how the incentive structure is organised with regard to
the pay-off structure of mutations in different elements in a complex technological system.
In DEMO following, we will use the original (non-generalised) NK-model as the DEMO of reference.
As the number of functions is equal to the number of elements in the original NK-model, it allows
us to define the pay-off for an individual agent by the fitness value of one individual DEMO
After the exposition, some remarks follow on the conceptualisation of decentralised DEMO in
fitness landscapes where the number of elements (firms) does not equal the number of functions.

and governments in the DEMO of new aircraft programmes.

3.1 Centralised versus decentralised search
To explain the difference between centralised and DEMO search in the NK-model, consider
the example of a fitness landscape DEMO N=3 and K=2 in Fig. 5. When search is centralised and
takes place by means of local hill-climbing, there are to optima: strings DEMO and 100. For these
strings, it holds that any mutation in DEMO element would lower the total fitness of the system as a
whole W. By contrast, when search is decentralised there is only one optimum: string 010. Only
for this string it holds that any mutation in one element would lower the fitness value of the
individual elements wn. DEMO, once the three agents have found string 010, no single
agent has an incentive to mutate its own element.16 However, 100 would be optimal from the
user’s point of view, as the average fitness W of all elements is highest for this design. However,
though optimal DEMO users, design 100 will not be accepted by the agent controlling DEMO second
element, since this firm can improve its individual fitness by DEMO from 0 to 1 moving from
design 100 (w2 = 0.5) to design 110 (w2 = 0.9).

FIGURE 5. Simulation DEMO fitness landscape of system with N=3 and K=2
As shown in simulations by Kauffman and Macready (1995), decentralised control generally does
not optimise a complex system. In many cases, the strings corresponding to optima when search
would be centralised, do not correspond to optima when search is decentralised. The reason that
fewer optima exist for fully decentralised search compared DEMO fully centralised search is that for
strings corresponding to optima in centralised search, there is generally at least one agent that can
improve its own fitness by mutation of its element. Moreover, decentralised search runs the risk
of finding no optimum at all when it holds for all DEMO that at least one agent can improve by
16 This equilibrium is generally called a Nash-equilibrium To verify whether design 010 is indeed a DEMO
equilibrium, one can look at the payoffs for each firm and DEMO whether each firm cannot improve its
payoff by mutation. Payoffs are w1 (010) = 0.7 for the firm responsible for the first element (FIRM1),
w2 (010) = 0.8 for the firm responsible for the second element (FIRM2), and w3 (010) = 0.6 for the firm
responsible for the third element (FIRM3). A mutation by FIRM 1 would lead to design 110 and payoff
w1 (110) DEMO 0.5, a mutation by FIRM 2 would lead to design 000 DEMO payoff w2 (000) = 0.1, and a mutation
by FIRM DEMO would lead to design 011 and payoff w3 (011) = 0.5.

mutation. And, since fewer optima exist for fully decentralised search, it DEMO takes more
mutations to find this optimum than in the case of centralised search.
Another result found by Kauffman and Macready (1995) holds DEMO, although there are fewer
optima in decentralised search, the average fitness of these optima are higher than the optima
found by centralised search. DEMO result is understandable since optima in decentralised search
have to meet the hard criterion that all N agents cannot improve their fitness by means DEMO
mutation of their element. Thus, although decentralised search takes longer to DEMO a local
optimum (also called an equilibrium) and even runs a serious risk of finding no local optimum at
all, the expected fitness of the local optima in decentralised search is higher than the expected
DEMO of local optima for centralised search.
Kauffman and Macready (1995) argued that both fully centralised and fully decentralised search
suffer from serious deficiencies DEMO optimising complex systems by means of local hill-climbing.
Under fully centralised search, an agent generally ends up in poor local optima as many strings
correspond to solutions with low fitness.17 Under decentralised search, the collective search
behaviour by agents generally leads to better optima, but the search process generally takes much
longer compared to centralised search. The central research question DEMO be addressed in this
context holds whether alternative forms of coordination can be specified that can overcome the
problems of decentralised control while avoiding DEMO high search costs of exhaustive search under
centralised control.
Kauffman and Macready (1995) studied a form of coordination that is intermediate between fully
DEMO and fully decentralised coordination. This intermediate form of coordination refers to
the case in which there are several agents, each of which has exclusive control over more than
one but less than all elements. The number DEMO elements controlled by each agents is denoted by P
with 2 • P • ½N.18 With regards to its block of P elements, an agent can mutate individual
elements.19 Each mutation of one element is evaluated DEMO the effect on all P elements controlled
by a single agent thus ignoring the effects a mutation might have on the other elements controlled
DEMO other agents.20
The partitioning of elements over agents is called “patching” and each block of elements that is
controlled by a single agent is DEMO a “patch”. By means of tuning the K parameter, Kauffman
and DEMO (1995) found that patching leads to better optima compared to centralised search
when K exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, these authors found that the optimal patch size is
only a fraction of the size N DEMO the system. This result indicates that a major reduction in search
time and search costs can be achieved by patching since the optimal patch DEMO is considerably
smaller than the size of the system.
17 Note again that we assume one-element mutations only. Importantly, centralised search has the
advantage over decentralised search that one is not restricted to mutations in single DEMO only. One can
also mutate several at the same time, which DEMO one to escape poor local optima. However, the search
time required DEMO find a local optimum increases exponentially with the number of elements that is allowed
to mutate at the same time. And, the global optimum generally can only be found by exhaustive search, i.e.
by evaluating all 2N possible designs  (Frenken et al. 1999).
18 When P DEMO 2 there is a maximum of N/2 firms all controlling two elements, and when P = ½N there is a
minimum of two firms both controlling half of all elements. P=1 corresponds to fully decentralised
DEMO of innovation with N firms and P=N corresponds to fully centralised coordination with one
firm.
19 Again, mutations in more than one element at the time are not allowed in this model.
20 Note that the DEMO model is formally equivalent to Kauffman’s (1993) NKC-model.
17
3.2 Networking in NK-models
An alternative form of coordination between agents, which has not yet been addressed in NK-
models, takes the form of networks between agents. In this view, each agent controls again only
one element, but patches of several elements emerge from collaborations between agents. When
Q agents decide to form a network of size Q involving Q DEMO of the system, this means here
that a mutation by one DEMO in one element is accepted or rejected depending on its effect on the
fitness values of all participants in the network. For example, one can assume that a mutation by
one agent in the network is DEMO only if no participant in the network is worse off (win-win-
DEMO). Using different rules of acceptance of an innovation of an agent in a network of agents, one
can analyse the performance of different network rules for different parameter settings N, K, and
Q.
In DEMO study, we restrict ourselves to analytical results that can be deduced DEMO a particular class
of landscapes being fully random NK landscapes of maximum complexity (K=N-1). For
landscapes with maximum complexity it holds that any mutation in an element affects the fitness
values of all other elements. DEMO, each mutation will yield N new fitness values that are
randomly DEMO from a uniform distribution [0,1] and consequently there is exist no correlation
whatsoever between fitness values of a string and its neighbouring strings. DEMO property renders
NK landscapes amenable for analytical analysis. Other landscapes will have to be researched by
simulation.
The analysis on fully random NK landscapes DEMO concentrate on the difference between
centralised, decentralised, and network organisations. For all three modes of organisation one can
derive the expected number of DEMO
For centralised organisation, it holds that the number of local optima DEMO be derived by looking at
the probability that a string is superior to all its one-mutant neighbours. This probability being
1/N+1, the total expected number of local optima adds up to (Kauffman 1993):
DEMO(centralised) = 2N / N +1 (3.1)
For fully decentralised organisation, the number of local optima called - equilibria in this context
- is derived by looking at the probability that a string is DEMO Nash-equilibrium. Given that each of
the N agents can increase its fitness by mutating its element with probability half, the probability
that no single agent can increase its fitness by mutation (i.e. that the current string is a Nash-
equilibrium) is 2-N. The total number of expected equilibria thus holds:
L( decentralised) = 2N ⋅ 2−N =1 (3.2)
Thus, whatever the size of the system N, on average DEMO is only one equilibrium in a
decentralised organisation. This means that in many cases, there will be no equilibrium at all.
This is the case when for all strings there exist always at least one agent DEMO can improve its
fitness. In such a case, there can never DEMO consensus on the technological design and decision-
making will not result in an outcome.
In the case of networking, the specific rule that agents follow when deciding to collaborate affects
the number of equilibria. Given that DEMO in technological development is motivated by
18
coordinating parallel changes in a system, one can assume that agents will mutate when a
simultaneous mutation of their partner(s) does not decrease an agent’s fitness and vice versa. In
other words, networking occurs when a simultaneous mutation by all partners generates a win-
win-win situation when DEMO simultaneous mutation renders no one worse off than before. An
equilibrium (DEMO a local optimum) is then defined by the condition that there DEMO no single
network between agents that leads the participating agents to a win-win-win situation. For
example, in Fig, 5 there are four strings DEMO meet this criterion (010, 011, 100, and 110).
The number of equilibria for which holds that no network collaboration yields a DEMO
situation for the participating agents thus depends on the size of the networks that are allowed to
form. Obviously, the larger the size of a network, the harder the constraint of a win-win-win
situation. We will analyse the probabilities for networks of a given size Q.
For bilateral DEMO (Q=2) we have (N(N-1))/2 possible collaborations. The DEMO that a
simultaneous mutation by both partners increase both fitness values equals 2-2 = ¼. Consequently,
the probability that a simultaneous mutation fails DEMO (1 - 2-2) = ¾. The probability that any
possible collaboration fails, i.e. that the set of agents in equilibrium holds:
L(bilateral) = 2N ⋅ 0.75( N( N−1)) / 2 (DEMO)
Generally, for networks of size Q we have probability 2-Q DEMO a simultaneous mutation of all Q
partners will lead to a win-win-win situation and thus probability (1 - 2-Q) that the collaboration
will DEMO Thus, the larger the size of a network, the smaller the probability that a win-win-win
situation can be reached. To derive the number DEMO equilibria for network of given size, one also
needs to determine DEMO number of possible networks of size Q for a given N which we will call R
and which equals:
R(Q) = N ⋅ ∏((N − q) /(q +1))
(3.4)DEMO
q=1
This parabolic function first increases and then decreases indicating that the number of possible
networks for a given N and varying Q first DEMO with Q and then decreases with Q.

L(Q) = 2N ⋅ (1− 2−Q )
DEMO Fig. 6 the expected number of equilibria has been plotted for different values of N and Q. From
the results the following proposition can DEMO derived. For each size of the network, the expected
number of DEMO has a maximum at some value of N. When varying N for a given Q, the
expected number of equilibria first rises and then falls (which can be understood from the fact
that when network size continues to increases, the number of possible networks that can be
formed falls).
One can now judge the performance of a network in DEMO of the expected number of equilibria it
generates compared to the alternative fully centralised and fully decentralised organisational
forms. As long as the expected DEMO of equilibria of a particular network Q for a particular
19
Q−1
value of N exceeds the expected number of equilibria of centralised search, the average fitness
value W of these equilibria can be expected to DEMO below the fitness values W of equilibria found
by centralised search. However, when the expected number of equilibria of a particular network
Q for a particular value of N is in between the expected number of DEMO of centralised and
decentralised search, the average fitness value W of DEMO equilibria can be expected to be above
the fitness values W of equilibria found by centralised search. In the latter case, the network
organisation is expected to perform better.
From the results in Fig. 6 it DEMO clear that for each value of the network size Q, there DEMO a region of
values for N where the number of optima lies in between the number of equilibria of centralised
and decentralised. Furthermore, the smallest possible networks size (Q=2) generates less local
optima than centralised DEMO and more than decentralised search only for N=4. Systems smaller
than N=4 are best optimised by centralised search. Thus, the network organisation only performs
well when the size of a complex system exceeds a critical size. DEMO suggests that centralised
decision-making can indeed be considered more effective for relative small systems, while
networking becomes only effective once a critical system size is exceeded. Moreover, the
preferable network organisation depends on the system size N with preferable network size
increasing with increases in N.

Expected number DEMO equilibria
As the number of equilibria is critically dependent on the rules that DEMO firms to network,
alternative rules for collaboration can be formulated and assessed in terms of the expected
number of equilibria. For example, if one would put a restriction on the formation of possible
networks, for example, that particular agents are not allowed to network, then the DEMO of
possible networks is less than as above. In that case, DEMO curvatures of the expected number of
equilibria of netwoprk organisation may cover a larger region where networking is favourable
compared to the alternative modes. DEMO simulation research of this kind can be
straightforwardly be implemented in the model set up as described here.
Further note that the discussion has DEMO limited to fully random fitness landscapes (K=N-1).
Further simulation research DEMO focus on alternative fitness landscape of lower complexity. In
that case, DEMO expected number of equilibria of all modes of organisation will fall but the precise
curvatures cannot be predicted ex ante. And, using simulation exercises, the average fitness value
of equilibria can also be determined more precisely.
4. TOWARDS A RESEARCH PROGRAM
The formalisation of network organisations in searching DEMO complex fitness landscape as specified
above provides one with a rich framework in which many research questions can be addressed in
simulation models. In DEMO study, starting from the original NK-model, a model has been
developed which allows one to determine what type of organisational modes yields a DEMO
number of equilibria.
The generalised NK-model as discussed earlier in this paper makes it possible to analyse systems
with a number of functions that DEMO not equal the number of elements. This generalised model
can be expected to have substantial empirical relevance too, when studying networks in which
pay-offs are not distributed individually but to teams of agents responsible for a DEMO
function of the system.
In a future exercise of analysing alternative modes of organisation in generalised fitness
landscapes, further theorising is required regarding the question how the fitness values of F
functions are translated into N DEMO values for individual agents controlling an element. As the
number of functions that is affected can differ per element, the “position” of an agent controlling
an element matters. Agents that control an element that affects many DEMO (high pleiotropy)
have proportional more possibilities to collaborate.
Simulation exercises DEMO required to understand the performance of alternative modes of
organisation for parameter regimes that cannot be handled analytically. Once these properties of
generalised NK-models DEMO known, empirical examples of network collaboration between agents
(individuals in a team, teams in a department, departments in firms, firms in an industry) can be
researched in relation to the simulation outcomes and may provide new research questions for
further specification of the model. It is DEMO that the full complexity of technological alliances
can then be appreciated both in simulation models and empirical studies.
