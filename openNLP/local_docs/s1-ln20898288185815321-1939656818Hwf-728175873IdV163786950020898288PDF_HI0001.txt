Dear Professor Sabherwal,
Our paper, ‚ÄúThe DEMO nexus: Impact of individual characteristics and the
environment on academic scientists‚Äô DEMO to pursue an entrepreneurial career‚Äù is submitted for
publication consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management.
Our topic is particularly relevant to your DEMO because academic entrepreneurship is a key way
in which technologies developed in research institutes are transformed into products and
services. Our paper is also DEMO interest to practitioners and educators in technology management.
As we show, DEMO promote business startup intentions among research scientists, characteristics of
the research DEMO and family and the laboratory environment should be jointly considered.
Because business startup intentions among research scientists is core to our paper, we have
suggested Professor Moren L√©vesque as the department editor for this paper.
Thank DEMO very much. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

The Individual-Environment Nexus: Impact of Individual Characteristics and the
Environment on Academic Scientists‚Äô Interest to Pursue an Entrepreneurial Career
Abstract
DEMO use the individualenvironment perspective to predict which academic scientists are
interested in pursuing an entrepreneurial career. We focus on academic scientists as academic
entrepreneurs DEMO a major role in transferring knowledge created from universities and research
laboratories into products and services that are of value to customers. Using a DEMO of 191
academic scientists, we examined how promotion focus, a core individual characteristic that
emphasizes working towards one‚Äôs goals and aspirations, together with the environment, predicts
the academic scientists‚Äô entrepreneurial intentions. Our study has implications for the
entrepreneurship literature, in particular academic entrepreneurship, and calls for DEMO research
on the individualenvironment nexus.

Managerial relevance statement
The DEMO has practical implications for encouraging technologybased entrepreneurship in
research universities in the areas of selection, education and training, and environmental
characteristics. Research laboratories DEMO in commercializing technologies can hire researchers
with a promotion focus (an DEMO characteristic), instead of limiting recruitment efforts
purely on technical skills. We agree with past research that academic scientists should be
encouraged to participate DEMO activities, such as business pitch competitions and entrepreneurship
classes, to stimulate thoughts into how the technologies they work with can have commercial
applications. DEMO, mentoring sessions, and other entrepreneurial knowledge and skill building
activities can spur the academic scientists to be interested in entrepreneurship activities. Such
activities DEMO particularly impactful in spurring entrepreneurial intentions when laboratory
managers create environments favorable to entrepreneurship.

1 Introduction
Over the past decade, there has been a substantial increase in academic entrepreneurial
activities which emerge from university DEMO [1]‚Äì[3]. Academic entrepreneurship is a way
for knowledge created in research institutions to be transformed into products and services. This
technology transfer is crucial DEMO countries to retain its competitive advantage [4]. Further,
commercialization of knowledge created in universities is increasingly a revenue source in the
face of DEMO government and donor funding [3], [5].
Because of its importance, understanding the factors that foster academic
entrepreneurship is a core research agenda [6]. DEMO body of work has found that individual
factors such as personal networks, role models, selfefficacy, and the types of research conducted
all predict academicentrepreneurial intentions [7], [8].
Despite the contribution of these studies, one DEMO is that they fail to acknowledge
the individualenvironment nexus. This is a notable limitation because whether people intend to
pursue an activity depends on DEMO tendencies together with environmental conditions that either
enhance or inhibit such tendencies [9][11]. Indeed, research has implied that scientists‚Äô
characteristics and the work situation are important determinants of the emergence or growth of
academic entrepreneurial activities (e.g., [12], [13]), yet how individual and environment interact
and DEMO their effects in this entrepreneurial process remains to be investigated.
In this study, we contribute to the academicentrepreneurial intentions literature by
studying the nexus of how individual and environment conditions predict the entrepreneurial
intentions of academic DEMO For individual characteristics, we studied promotion focus.

Promotion focus is an DEMO towards achievementoriented situations where individuals
concentrate on achieving goals and idealized selves [14]. Brockner, Higgins, and Low [15]
theorized that promotion focus can DEMO explain entrepreneurial success.  Because of this
assertion, studies of promotion focus in entrepreneurship (e.g., [16]) have generally looked at its
impact on firm success. Few studies have linked this focus to entrepreneurial intentions. We
DEMO that studying the effect of promotion focus on entrepreneurial intentions is required
because such intentions affect whether academic scientists embark on the entrepreneurial journey
DEMO the first place. Without such intentions, much of the knowledge academic DEMO generate
in universities and research institutions are likely to remain buried in their laboratories.
We reason that high promotion focused individuals are especially keen DEMO be
entrepreneurs in environments that support entrepreneurship. That is, there is DEMO multiplicative
effect of promotion focus and the environment. We base our reasoning on the fact that
individuals high in promotion focus relentlessly pursue their DEMO [14]; if they desire to be
entrepreneurs, they pursue this goal aggressively. Through the interplay of what a person is
suited for and DEMO preferences, entrepreneurial activities flourish [17].
In the following, we hypothesize that promotion focus together with work and family
environments predict entrepreneurial intentions of DEMO scientists. Then we explain the
methods and describe our sample of academic scientists, as well as report the findings. Finally,
we discuss implications of our study to the role of the individualenvironment nexus in
predicting DEMO intentions.

2 Theory Development
In this section, we explain how this individualenvironment nexus predicts entrepreneurial
activity [9], [10], [18] among DEMO scientists. Over the past decade, there has been a
substantial increase DEMO universitybased entrepreneurial activities and spinoffs from university
research [1][3]. This rise stems from the pressure faced by public research institutions, including
universities, to DEMO at least part of their research results through licensing and/or new
ventures.
Despite the pressure to commercialize, universities are still faced with the innovation paradox
[19], in which many research results do not get commercialized [20]. There are also large
differences in the extent to which universities DEMO their departments engage in commercial and
entrepreneurial activities [3]. We study the individual factor of promotion focus and the
environment factor of family/work DEMO and how the individualenvironment nexus
predicts entrepreneurial intentions.
Individuals high in promotion focus use approach and proactive means to attain desired end
states or DEMO selves [14]. A person‚Äôs level of promotion focus is influenced by his or her
subjective history of success [21]. This is based on McClelland DEMO Atkinson's classic theory of
achievement motivation. As McClelland [22] and Atkinson [23] asserted, over time a new
achievement task elicits feelings associated with past task engagements. Subsequently,
individuals with subjective histories of success tend DEMO feel pride when given new tasks, leading
to the development of DEMO promotion focus. In the following section, we theorize that promotion
focus DEMO with environments supporting such activities will enhance entrepreneurial
intentions.

We first hypothesize how DEMO family environment‚Äîin particular whether parents owned
businesses‚Äîtogether with promotion focus, predicts DEMO entrepreneurial intentions of academic
scientists. Second, beyond the family, workrelated environmental factors could also influence
entrepreneurial activities [24], [25]. In the context of universities, Henrekson and Rosenberg [26]
observed that financial incentives for researchers and industryfinanced research encourage
sciencebased commercialization. Consistent with these observations, we investigate how
promotion focus together with two work environment factors, (a) extent to which the research
laboratory engages in industry financed research and (b) DEMO property rights (IPR)
acquisition, predict entrepreneurial intentions.
2.1 Family Environment  Entrepreneurial Status of Parents
Individuals are more likely to start businesses DEMO their parents have owned businesses
[25], [27], [28]. Parents act as role models and those raised in entrepreneurial families tend to
develop positive DEMO towards entrepreneurial activities [25], [28], [29]. Katz [30] proposed a
psychosocial cognitive model to explain the relationship between being raised in entrepreneurial
families DEMO entrepreneurial intentions. He suggested that when individuals are deciding which
profession to go into, they use past experiences as the starting point. Moreover, DEMO
whose parents have started businesses are more likely to seek education, DEMO opportunities,
or join entrepreneurship clubs to develop skills that an entrepreneurial career requires. These
activities further spur interest to be an entrepreneur and DEMO confidence to succeed in this
career [27], [31].
Building on regulatory DEMO theory, we propose that higher levels of entrepreneurial
intentions come about DEMO a high promotion focused person comes from an entrepreneurial
6

Transactions on Engineering Management
family. High promotion focused people tend to work DEMO their ideal selves [14]. While
having been raised in a family of entrepreneurs can make people excited about starting their own
businesses, promotion focus enhances the salience and vividness of this vision. In this way,
DEMO focus creates a link between positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the
motivation to turn preferences into intentions. When a high promotion focused person does DEMO
come from an entrepreneurial family, s/he may lack the experience DEMO memory of
entrepreneurship and decide to pursue other activities instead. In cases of low promotion focus, a
person who has positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship may question whether the trials,
difficulties, and problems that entrepreneurs invariably encounter are worth the effort. Taking the
joint effects of promotion focus DEMO family background into consideration, we hypothesize that:
H1: When scientists‚Äô parent(s) have owned a business and the scientists have a
high promotion focus, they will have higher entrepreneurial intentions.
In addition to the family, the work environment should also be considered as both family and
work are two important spheres in a person‚Äôs life experiences [25], [32]. Below we explain how
the work environment of academic scientists together with DEMO focus level impacts
entrepreneurial intentions.
2.2 Work Environment  Industry Financed Research
It is widely recognized that building industryscience relations is difficult. A key DEMO is the
inherent tension between academic and commercial demands [33], including DEMO in time
horizon between academic and industry research [34].  Furthermore, the incentives between
7
Page 8 of 35

Page 9 of 35
Transactions on Engineering Management
academia and industry differ. DEMO encourages knowledge dissemination, whereas the
commercial sector seeks ownership and tight DEMO of intellectual property rights. Even with
these tensions, there is government DEMO for research institutions (since they use public
funds) to commercialize [3].
We reason that researchers working in laboratories that value commercialization are more
DEMO to have entrepreneurial intentions. We draw on the attraction, selection, and retention
theory [35] to explain this. Individuals are usually attracted to organizations DEMO norms are
congruent to theirs. Similarly, organizations tend to hire people DEMO share the organizations‚Äô
norms [35]. After hiring, employees are subjected to DEMO and informal socialization activities
reinforcing these norms [36]. If misalignment still occurs, employees often manage this
discomfort by changing their values to fit the organization [37]. Therefore, through attraction,
selection [35], socialization [36], [38], and value change over time [37], employees tend to adopt
norms DEMO with their organizations. If all efforts to align values fail, a DEMO is motivated
to leave the organization [35].
Related to the above, DEMO hypothesize that entrepreneurial intentions should be higher when a
high promotion focused researcher works on industryfinanced projects. Research laboratories
doing industryfinanced projects are expected DEMO transfer technologies for commercial purposes
[26], [39]. Due to attraction, selection, and retention mechanisms, academic scientists working in
laboratories that rely on DEMO research should also be favorably predisposed to
commercialization. High promotion focused academic scientists working in this environment
should have positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship and DEMO report higher
entrepreneurial intentions. Given the high uncertainty of the entrepreneurial environment, low
8

Transactions on Engineering Management
promotion focused individuals, even in the presence of an environment favoring
entrepreneurship, could avoid such activities. Hence we hypothesize that:
H2: When high promotion focused scientists work in laboratories with more industry
financed research, they will have higher entrepreneurial intentions.
2.3 Work Environment  Intellectual Property Rights Engagement
Intellectual property activities have begun to grow, especially among universities outside
North America since the mid1990s as universities face DEMO to transfer technology [40]
[42] and seek additional sources of funding [43]. Being involved in intellectual property
activities is associated with entrepreneurial intentions because DEMO applications require
individuals to think about how the technology is commercially useful. Moreover, patent
potection is usually targeted at research with commercial potential [43]. Through knowledge
spillovers, employees who are exposed to ideas with commercial potential generate ideas for
their businesses [11].
While such intellectual property rights engagement DEMO spur entrepreneurial intentions, we
hypothesize that the intellectual property rights activities DEMO entrepreneurial intentions
relationship should be stronger for low promotion focused individuals. A patent provides the
holder the right to exclude others from using the DEMO, thereby reducing technological
competition and market uncertainty [44]. Thus, intellectual property rights protection helps
inventors to appropriate returns from R&D investments [45]. DEMO protection should be
especially attractive to individuals with low promotion focus. High promotion focused
individuals should be less concerned with the availability of intellectual DEMO protection and
9

Page 11 of 35
Transactions on Engineering Management
the challenges that a DEMO of this protection brings about. Instead, high promotion focused
individuals tend DEMO pursue activities they are passionate about [14]. Hence we hypothesize that:
H3: Low promotion focused individuals are more likely to have higher
entrepreneurial intentions in the presence of intellectual property protection.

3 Methods
3.1 Participants and Procedures
Our sample comprised 191 doctoral and postdoctoral researchers from a DEMO in
Norway. Data were collected in February 2010, using an online DEMO The data
collection phase was preceded by a pilot phase during November 2009January 2010, during
which respondents were also requested to provide comments on the questionnaire, allowing
refinement of the instrument. The survey population consisted of 690 doctoral and postdoctoral
researchers in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural DEMO They received a request to
complete the online questionnaire through email, DEMO by the central administration, and signed
by the research team and DEMO vicedean. The first mailing resulted in a response of 170
researchers, DEMO was followed by a second email request one week later, resulting DEMO 112
additional responses. From the total of 282 responses, 91 were DEMO due to missing data,
resulting in 191 full questionnaires ‚Äì an effective response rate of 28%. T tests showed no
significant differences between DEMO and late respondents in age, type of academic scientist
(doctoral or postdoctoral researcher), and time employed at the university. The average age DEMO
10

the respondents was 32 (s.d. 6.15) and 37.2% were women; respondents had been employed by
DEMO university for an average of 3.24 years (s.d. 3.19).
3.2 DEMO
Entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial intentions were measured using Linan and Chen‚Äôs
[46] 3item scale. Participants responded on a 7point scale from 1 (unlikely) to DEMO (likely) to the
following questions: ‚ÄúYou will pursue a career DEMO an entrepreneur,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will pursue a career as
employed in an organization‚Äù (reverse coded), and ‚ÄúYou will start a business‚Äù (Cronbach‚Äôs
DEMO = .71, mean = 2.80, s.d. = 1.26).
Promotion focus. This variable was measured using the scale developed by Lockwood, Jordan
and Kunda [47]. Nine questions were used to measure promotion focus on a DEMO of 1 (disagree
to a large extent) to 9 (agree DEMO a large extent). Sample items include: ‚ÄúI frequently imagine how
DEMO will achieve my hopes and aspirations,‚Äù ‚ÄúI often think about the person I would ideally like to
be in the future,‚Äù ‚ÄúI DEMO focus on the success I hope to achieve in the future,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI often
think about how I will achieve my academic success.‚Äù DEMO reliability measured by Cronbach‚Äôs
Alpha was .82. The average promotion focus was 6.39 with a s.d. of 1.22.
Parentsowned business. Following the wording used DEMO the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor
surveys, participants were asked the question: ‚Äúhas either of your parents ever owned a
business?‚Äù  The responses were coded as 1 (28% of the sample) if either of the DEMO had
owned a business and 0 otherwise.

Industry financed research. Participants DEMO the following question ‚ÄúWhat percentage of
your research time was dedicated to research financed by industry over the previous year?‚Äù The
average percentage DEMO industry financed research time was 16.83% (s.d. = 32.87).
Intellectual DEMO Rights (IPR) engagement. We collected data on patent applications per
department and used that to measure Intellectual Property Rights engagement but found little
DEMO in this variable; there were very few patent applications as the DEMO we studied
only recently became interested in patent protection. Instead of the number of patent applications
to measure Intellectual Property Rights engagement, we created a 3item scale which asked the
researchers directly about their IPR engagement. DEMO items on a 7point scale from 1 (unlikely)
to 7 (likely) are: ‚ÄúYou will apply for a patent over the next DEMO years,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will license some of
your technological developments to industry over the next 5 years,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou will become the
owner DEMO intellectual property rights (patent, copyright, trademark,‚Ä¶.) over the next 5 years.‚Äù
The scale was reliable with Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha of .89 (average = 2.92, s.d. = 1.60).
Control variables. We controlled for individual and work factors that are linked to
entrepreneurial activities such as age DEMO, gender [49], startup experience [50] and
entrepreneurial identity aspiration [50]. Further, we included a control dummy indicating
whether the respondent was a postdoctoral (1) or a doctoral (0) researcher. Some 28% of the
DEMO were postdocs.
4 Results
Before testing the hypotheses, we tested for DEMO validity of the constructs.
Discriminant validity is the degree to which measures of different latent constructs are unique
enough to be distinguished from other DEMO We conducted two tests to verify the
12
For Peer Review
Transactions on Engineering Management
Page 14 of 35
distinctiveness of the latent DEMO used in this research. The first test was to compare the
variance shared by each construct and its measures with the variance shared by DEMO constructs
[51]. This indicates that the variance captured by two constructs needs to be larger than the
squared correlation between them. Average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct
exceeded the squared correlation between it and any other construct. Second, using confirmatory
factor analysis, we compared the unconstrained DEMO with the constrained model in which the
correlation between the two constructs was fixed at one. A significant difference in chisquare
values for the DEMO and unconstrained models indicates the distinctiveness of the two
constructs. Some 15 checks were conducted, and all the differences were significant (p < DEMO),
providing strong evidence of discriminant validity.
Common method bias is DEMO to affect the hypotheses which are based on interaction
effects [52], DEMO such bias can impact the main effects. Therefore, we conducted a DEMO to
check for common method bias. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we DEMO for a single
unmeasured latent method construct following the unmeasured latent method construct technique
outlined by Richardson, Simmering and Sturman [53] and Facteau, DEMO, Russell, Ladd, and
Kudisch [54]. Specifically, we used confirmatory factor analysis to test alternative measurement
models. Model 1 was a null measurement DEMO (i.e., no factors underlie the data). Model 2
posited that a single method factor explained the data. Model 3 was the measurement DEMO used
in this study in which the constructs of interest (‚Äòtraits‚Äô) were positioned to underlie the data.
Model 4 posited that the data DEMO be accounted for by the traits in Model 3 plus a single
uncorrelated method factor.
13
For Peer Review
Page 15 of 35
Transactions on Engineering Management
To check for common DEMO bias, we first compared Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1
DEMO a significantly better fit to the data than Model 2 (‚äøX^2 DEMO 1002.6, df = 13, p < .001).
This indicated that the observed variance in the independent and dependent constructs did not
result DEMO method only. In the second comparison of Model 3 and Model 4, Model 4 did not
significantly fit better than Model 3 (‚äøX^2 DEMO 133.7, df = 14, p > .05). This indicated that
common method bias was unlikely to exist. Subsequently, we partitioned the variation accounted
by Model 4 into trait and method components. Specifically, for each item, the square of the trait
factor loading and of the method factor loading indicate the amount of variance due to trait and
the DEMO factors, respectively. The average amount of variance due to the trait DEMO was
39%, compared to 12% for the method factor. It is DEMO accepted that the common method
bias present in the data is not sufficient to bias results if the proportion of variance attributed to
method DEMO smaller than 25% [55], [56], which was the case for our data. Consequently, there was
no evidence to suggest the results would be affected by common method bias.
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and DEMO correlations of the variables. For the
control variables, entrepreneurial intentions correlated DEMO with gender (r = .36) (where
1 = male, and 2 = female), previous startup attempts or experiences (r = .33), and entrepreneurial
identity aspirations (r = .72). For the independent variables, entrepreneurial intentions correlated
positively with intellectual property rights engagement (r DEMO .38). Promotion focus was not linked
to entrepreneurial intentions (r DEMO .08) suggesting that having a promotion focus by itself does not
DEMO that an individual pursues entrepreneurial activities.

We performed hierarchical regressions DEMO test our hypotheses. Table 2 shows the regression
results. In Model 1, only the control variables were included. We then added the independent
variables in Model 2 and the interaction terms in Model 3. The highest DEMO inflation factor
for the models was 1.81 suggesting that multicollinearity was not a problem in the regressions.
Insert Table 2 about here
Results in DEMO 1 of Table 2 show that the control variables as a whole explained 58% in the
variation of entrepreneurial intentions (F = 58.35, DEMO < .001; R2 = .58). In particular,
entrepreneurial intentions DEMO positively related to gender (Œ≤ = .365, p < .01), indicating that
men have stronger entrepreneurial intentions than women, previous startup experience (Œ≤ = .556,
p < .01), and entrepreneurial identity aspiration (Œ≤ = .536, p < .001). In Model 2, we added the
main effects for promotion focus, parentsowned business, industryfinanced research DEMO
intellectual property rights engagement. Only the coefficient for intellectual property rights
engagement was significant (Œ≤ = .083, p < .05) suggesting that intellectual property rights
engagement positively related to entrepreneurial intentions.
Model 3 shows that DEMO interaction terms as a group significantly increased the amount of
variance explained in entrepreneurial intentions (R2 = .63, ‚àÜR2 over Model 2 = DEMO, p < .01). All
of the three interaction terms were DEMO We graphed these significant interaction effects in
Figures 2 to 4 with high and low defined as +1 s.d. and 1 s.d. respectively. Supporting
DEMO 1, promotion focus x parentsowned business related positively to entrepreneurial
intentions (Œ≤ = .311, p < .05). Figure 2 shows that having a parent who owned a business had
higher entrepreneurial intentions among individuals DEMO in promotion focus but lower
entrepreneurial intentions among individuals low in promotion focus. The interaction of
15

promotion focus with industryfinanced DEMO was significant (Œ≤ = .003, p < .10). The results
support Hypothesis 2 that industryfinanced research should predict entrepreneurial intentions for
individuals DEMO in promotion focus rather than for their low promotion focused counterparts. As
Figure 3 shows, at low levels of industryfinanced research, individuals low DEMO promotion focus
had higher entrepreneurial intentions, while at high levels of DEMO financed research, the
entrepreneurial intentions converged for both groups. The findings DEMO showed that the
interaction of promotion focus with intellectual property rights engagement was significant (Œ≤ = 
.085, p < .05). Supporting DEMO 3, Figure 4 indicates that the positive slope of the
intellectual DEMO rights engagement to entrepreneurial intentions relationship is steeper for
individuals low in promotion focus as compared to individuals high in promotion focus.

5 Discussion
We study academic entrepreneurship and show that entrepreneurial intentions of academic
scientists come about when individuals with the DEMO psychological characteristics are put in
environments favoring such activities. Academic entrepreneurship is important as it is a key way
in which technologies, knowledge, DEMO expertise from universities and research laboratories are
transformed into products and services. Our findings show that individual promotion focus
interacts with the work and DEMO environments to determine academic scientists‚Äô
entrepreneurial intentions.

5.1 Theoretical implications
Researchers DEMO with Sarasvathy‚Äôs effectuation work may realize that our Figure 1 is an
adaptation of the Figure 1 in her 2004 paper [18] in which DEMO is a process that
integrates the inner environment (i.e., characteristics and resources available to the
individual/firm) and the outer environment (i.e., environmental characteristics). Following
Sarasvathy‚Äôs effectuation perspective, numerous studies have documented that successful
entrepreneurs often use bricolage, navigating the many challenges in their entrepreneurial
journey with limited resources, take calculated risks but are willing to cut their losses if the need
arises, and are proactive and action oriented (e.g., [57]). Central to this effectuation perspective
is that individual DEMO environmental characteristics interact to cause entrepreneurial activity to
take place. This broad body of work has led to a deeper understanding of how successful
DEMO operate. We contribute to this body of work by focusing on a central part of the
individualenvironment nexus that tends to receive less attention, that of which individuals want
to pursue entrepreneurial activities in the first DEMO After they decide to pursue such activities,
processes such as affordable loss and bricolage start to be important.
Within this individualenvironment nexus, we studied promotion focused academic scientists.
These individuals are adapted for entrepreneurial activities DEMO they relentlessly pursue their goals,
are willing to overcome the uncertainties, ambiguities, and risks involved in the entrepreneurial
process. However, the importance of the personentrepreneurial activity fit in the startup journey
implies that only DEMO characteristics are not enough. While some studies have
acknowledged that scientists‚Äô individual differences impact their intentions [12], there are
indications that the environment a person is in‚Äîfamily and work environments‚Äîhas strong
17
For Peer Review
Page 19 of 35
Transactions on Engineering Management
influences on entrepreneurial intentions DEMO, [26]. We found that it is the promotion focus in
conjunction DEMO the environments that lead to a proclivity for entrepreneurial activities. Our
findings corroborate that environment and individual characteristics jointly influence the level of
entrepreneurial DEMO among academic scientists.
As we predicted, academic scientists have higher entrepreneurial DEMO when they are
high in promotion focus and are in family environments that encourage entrepreneurship. As for
the work environment and promotion focus relationship, that is more complicated. As our
findings revealed, industryfinanced research is linked to lower entrepreneurial intentions among
individuals low in promotion focus, but industry finance did not result in higher entrepreneurial
intentions for individuals high in DEMO focus. This may be explained by the situation that
industryfinanced research provides job security as continued employment sometimes depends
on external funding. This situation DEMO not unique to our sample as many engineering and science
oriented doctoral students are funded this way [43]. We found that among low promotion
DEMO individuals, the availability of patents positively predicted the academic scientists‚Äô
entrepreneurial DEMO Low promotion focused individuals could be attracted to
entrepreneurial activities when they have intellectual property protection as such protection
hinders competitors from entering their DEMO space.
Echoing a personenvironment perspective, in a theory paper, Shepherd [58] suggested that
the grief recovering processes depends on the individual‚Äôs emotional intelligence DEMO the family
business‚Äôs emotional capability. We recommend that more studies can incorporate the nexus of
individual and environment factors. For instance, beyond promotion focus, future studies can
also look into other factors that can lead to approach tendencies such as positive affect [59][61]
18

and certain types of DEMO (e.g., anger) and the nexus between emotions and environmental
factors DEMO
5.2 Limitations and Future Research
A limitation in our study is that we did not explore if it makes any difference whether one or
DEMO parents were entrepreneurs, but this could be relevant. For instance, if one parent is an
entrepreneur and the other is a stayathome parent, we expect employment preferences to reflect
selfemployment as people raised in such DEMO may look upon the employed parent as the
work model. But when one parent is an entrepreneur and the other works in a major DEMO,
it is harder to predict which work model prevails. Whether the business was inherited, or whether
the parent started the business might also predict entrepreneurial intentions. Future studies can do
a more finegrained analysis of DEMO backgrounds and how these backgrounds shape
entrepreneurial desires.
Second, the type DEMO intellectual property activity can influence a person‚Äôs desire to be an
entrepreneur. Some intellectual property activities are easier to commercialize than others. For
instance, Wong et al. [11] found that exposure to product type innovation more DEMO than process
type innovation led to employees leaving their companies to start ventures. This is because
process technologies usually need to be combined within DEMO larger system to be useful.  A person
who owns a patent DEMO a process technology may have to license the technology to an existing
company instead of starting his or her company. A related issue is DEMO policies
which influence the extent technologies created in the university are commercialized [63]. A
broad license, for example, provides more incentives for a DEMO to start a business since
several product lines can materialize from the technology. A broad license may be especially
19

attractive for individuals low DEMO promotion focus compared to their high promotion focused
counterparts. The latter should be less concerned with the monopoly rights and uncertainty
reduction a patent DEMO
5.3 Practical Implications
The study has practical implications for encouraging technologybased entrepreneurship in
research universities in the areas of selection, education and training, DEMO environmental
characteristics. As we found, under favorable circumstances, individuals high in promotion focus
are especially interested in engaging in entrepreneurial activities. Therefore, research laboratories
keen in commercializing technologies can hire researchers with such a focus, instead of limiting
recruitment efforts purely on technical skills.
Apart from selection, research laboratory managers can encourage academic scientists to
attend entrepreneurship courses to DEMO entrepreneurial desires [64]. Moreover, since many
universities have business plan or DEMO idea competitions, academic scientists can be
encouraged to participate in these DEMO These activities stimulate thoughts into how the
technologies they work with can have commercial applications. Further, mentoring sessions, and
other entrepreneurial knowledge and DEMO building activities can spur the academic scientists to
be interested in entrepreneurship activities. Finally, laboratory managers can create an
environment favorable to entrepreneurship by setting aside time for academic scientists to work
on product commercialization activities.

6 Conclusion
Under favorable work or family environments, promotion focus is a lever of entrepreneurial
intentions. Academic scientists who are DEMO in promotion focus develop high intentions to
engage in entrepreneurship when the family and work environments are favorable towards
commercialization activities. By examining the DEMO nexus, we gain a better
understanding of how the inner individual DEMO and the outer work and family
environments operate together to influence entrepreneurial intentions. We encourage future
research to study the effects of the personenvironment DEMO on such intentions.
