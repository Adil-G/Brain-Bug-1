Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, television personality, author, politician, and the Republican Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. He is chairman of The Trump Organization, which is the principal holding company for his real estate ventures and other business interests.

Born and raised in New York City, Trump received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. While attending college, Trump worked in his father Fred Trump's real estate and construction firm. He was given control of the business in 1971 and later renamed it "The Trump Organization". During his career, Trump has built skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, golf courses, and numerous other developments across North and South America, Europe and Asia, many of which bear his name, such as the Trump Place apartment complex in Manhattan. He sought the Reform Party presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. Listed by Forbes among the World's Billionaires, Trump and his businesses, as well as his personal life and political views, have for decades received considerable media exposure. He hosted and co-produced The Apprentice, a reality television series on NBC, from 2004 to 2015, for which he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has also made numerous cameo appearances in films and television series, and appeared at the Miss USA pageants which he owned from 1996 to 2015.

In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican and quickly emerged as the front-runner for his party's nomination. In May 2016, his remaining Republican rivals suspended their campaigns, and in July he was formally nominated for president at the 2016 Republican National Convention.

Trump's 2016 presidential campaign has received extensive media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on Twitter, and at campaign rallies have been controversial. Several rallies have been accompanied by protests or riots. Trump's positions include renegotiation of U.S.–China trade deals, opposition to particular trade agreements such as the TPP, stronger enforcement of immigration laws together with building a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border, reform of veterans' care, replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and tax cuts. Trump has suggested temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States, which he later said would focus instead on countries with a proven history of terrorism, until the level of vetting can be raised to screen out potential terrorists.

Ancestry
Main article: Ancestry of Donald Trump
Trump is of German ancestry on his father's side, and Scottish ancestry on his mother's side; all four of his grandparents were born outside of the United States. His father Fred (1905–1999) was born in New York, and became one of the biggest real estate developers in New York City.[3][4] His mother, Mary Trump (née MacLeod, 1912–2000), was born in Scotland.[5] Fred and Mary met in New York and married in 1936, settling together in Queens.[5][6]

Drumpf, the family’s ancestral name, was changed to Trump during Germany's Thirty Years' War in the seventeenth century.[7] Trump has said that he is proud of his German heritage; he served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.[8]

Childhood and education
Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Jamaica Estates, Queens, a neighborhood in New York City.[9] He was the second youngest child of Mary and Fred Trump's five children. Of his four siblings, three are living: Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert. Trump's older brother Fred Jr. died in 1981 from alcoholism, which Trump has said has led him to avoid ever trying alcohol or cigarettes.[10]


Trump as a teenager at New York Military Academy, 1964
The family had a two-story Tudor Revival home on Wareham Place in Jamaica Estates, where Trump lived while attending The Kew-Forest School.[11] At Kew-Forest, Fred Trump served as a member of the Board of Trustees. Due to behavior problems, Trump left the school at age 13 and was enrolled in the New York Military Academy (NYMA),[12] where he finished eighth grade and high school. In 1983, Fred told an interviewer that Donald "was a pretty rough fellow when he was small".[13] During his senior year, Trump participated in marching drills, wore a uniform, and attained the rank of captain.[14] In 2015, he told a biographer that NYMA gave him "more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military".[15]

Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years, beginning in August 1964. He then transferred to the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, which offered one of the few real estate studies departments in United States academia.[16][17] While there, he worked at the family's company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, named for his paternal grandmother.[18] Trump graduated from Wharton in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics.[17][19][20]

Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War.[21] While in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[22] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board, but was given a 1-Y medical deferment in October 1968.[23] In an interview for a 2015 biography, Trump attributed his exemption to heel spurs.[15] Richard Flahavan, a longtime agent of the Selective Service System, stated Trump's deferment had made his draft number unimportant.[23][24][25]

Business career
Real estate
See also: The Trump Organization
Early career
Prior to graduating from college, Trump began his real estate career at his father's company,[26] Elizabeth Trump and Son,[27] which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. During his undergraduate study, one of Trump's first projects was the revitalization of the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which his father had purchased for $5.7 million in 1962.[28] Fred and Donald Trump became involved in the project, and with a $500,000 investment, turned the 1,200-unit complex's occupancy rate from 34% to 100%. Trump has said that when he graduated from college in 1968, he was worth about $200,000 (equivalent to $1,020,000 in 2015).[29] In 1972, The Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75 million.[30][31] At age 23, he made an unsuccessful commercial foray into show business, investing $70,000 to become co-producer of the 1970 Broadway comedy Paris Is Out!.[32]


The Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower (center) in Panama City, Panama
He was given control of the company in 1971 and, in one of his first acts, renamed the company to The Trump Organization.[33][34] In that year, he also moved to Manhattan, where he took part in larger construction projects and used attractive architectural design to win public recognition. He and his father drew wider attention in 1973 when the Justice Department alleged that they were discriminating against blacks who wanted to rent apartments, rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. Ultimately the Trumps' company and federal officials signed an agreement under which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League.[35][36]

By 1973, Trump was president of the Trump Organization and oversaw the company's 14,000 apartments across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. In 1978 the city selected his Midtown Manhattan site as the location for its Jacob Javits Convention Center, after finding that he was the only bidder who had a site ready for the project.[35] He received a broker's fee on the property sale. Trump's first big deal in Manhattan[37] was the building of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978 near Grand Central Station. The Grand Hyatt would replace the aging Commodore Hotel, owned by the Penn Central Transportation Company, which was in bankruptcy, and help bring Trump to public prominence.[38] Part of this deal was a $1 million loan that Donald's father Fred's Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan credit line that Fred had arranged for Trump as he built the hotel, as well as a $70 million construction loan which was jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred Trump was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Trump the front man in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred's two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project.[37] Donald negotiated a forty-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city in exchange for a share of the venture's profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.[39]

In 1981, Trump purchased and renovated a building that would become the Trump Plaza.[40]

Trump Tower

Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, in Midtown Manhattan
In 1983, Trump completed development of the Trump Tower, a 58-story skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The project involved complicated negotiations with different parties for the architecturally significant Bonwit Teller building itself, the land, and the airspace above a neighboring building. When negotiations were completed in 1978, The New York Times wrote "That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location... is testimony to [his] persistence and to his skills as a negotiator."[41] Favorable reviews of the building's design helped convince the city to approve the project. Trump hired Barbara Res to manage the building's construction, and she became the first woman to manage the construction of a skyscraper in New York City.

Trump Tower occupies the former site of the architecturally significant Bonwit Teller flagship store, demolished in 1980.[42][43] There was controversy when valuable Art Deco bas-relief sculptures on its facade, which had been promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Trump, were destroyed on the orders of the Trump Organization during the demolition process.[42][43] In addition, the demolition of the Bonwit Teller store was criticized for a contractor's use of some 200 undocumented Polish immigrant workers, who, during the rushed demolition process, were reportedly paid 4–5 dollars per hour for work in 12-hour shifts.[44][45] Trump testified in 1990 that he rarely visited the site and was unaware of the illegal workers, some of whom lived at the site and who were known as the "Polish Brigade". A judge ruled in 1991 that the builders engaged in "a conspiracy to deprive the funds of their rightful contribution", referring to the pension and welfare funds of the labor unions.[46] However, on appeal, parts of that ruling were overturned,[47] and the record became sealed when the long-running labor lawsuit was settled in 1999, after 16 years in court.[44][45]

Trump Tower was developed by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company, and was designed by architect Der Scutt of Swanke Hayden Connell.[48] Trump Tower houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[49] The building includes shops, cafés, offices, and residences. Its five-level atrium features a 60-foot-high waterfall spanned by a suspended walkway, below a skylight.[50] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice including a fully functional television studio set.[51] When the building was completed, its condominiums sold quickly and the tower became a tourist attraction.[52]

Expansion

Wollman Rink in Central Park
Harrah's at Trump Plaza opened in Atlantic City in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp.[53] and operated by the Harrah's gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino's poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp.[54] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump's wife, Ivana, managed the property.[55]

Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida in 1985 for $5 million, plus $3 million for the home's furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with Lee Iacocca that became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.[56]

Repairs on the Wollman Rink in Central Park, built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a general contractor unconnected to Trump, with an expected 2 1⁄2-year construction schedule, but were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95 million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget, and then operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity.[57]

Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988. He paid $400 million for the property and once again tapped Ivana to manage its operation and renovation.[58]


Trump Taj Mahal, at 1000 Boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey
Later in 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[59] The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built.[60][61] Financed with $675 million in junk bonds[62] at a 14% interest rate, the project entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year.[63] Banks and bondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted to restructure the debt. The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50 percent ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt.[64] He also sold his financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess.[62][65][66] The property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated into Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8 billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50 million in assets and $500 million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[66] Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.[67]

Business bankruptcies
Main article: Legal affairs of Donald Trump § Use of bankruptcy laws
Although Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, hotel and casino businesses of his have been declared bankrupt four times between 1991 and 2009 to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[68][69] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, "I do play with the bankruptcy laws—they're very good for me" as a tool for trimming debt.[70][71]

The four bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[72][73] Trump said "I've used the laws of this country to pare debt. ... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on The Apprentice. It's not personal. It's just business."[63]

Inheritance and further acquisitions
Trump acquired an old, vacant office building on Wall Street in Manhattan in 1996. After a complete renovation, it became the seventy-story Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[74]

After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions of his father's estate valued at $250–300 million.[75]

In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters.[76] Trump also began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He continued to own commercial space in Trump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle which he acquired in 1996,[77] and also continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[78]

Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue.[79]

By 2014, he retained 10% ownership of Trump Entertainment Resorts, which owns the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, both in Atlantic City. That same year, Trump Entertainment Resorts entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed Trump Plaza in Atlantic City indefinitely. Billionaire Carl Icahn purchased the company in 2016, acquiring Trump Taj Mahal; Icahn kept Trump's name on the building even though Trump no longer had any ownership.[80]

Trump has licensed his name and image for the development of a number of real estate projects including two Trump-branded real estate projects in Florida that have gone into foreclosure.[81] The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[82]

Trump also licensed his name to son-in-law Jared Kushner's fifty story Trump Bay Street, a Jersey City luxury development that has raised $50 million of its $200 million capitalization largely from wealthy Chinese nationals who, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government's expedited EB-5 visa program, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years.[83] Trump is a partner with Kushner Properties only in name licensing and not in the building's financing.[83]

Income controversy
According to a July 2015 press release from his campaign manager, Trump's "income" for the year 2014 was $362 million ("which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties").[84] His disclosure filings for the year 2015 revealed that his total gross revenue was in excess of $611 million.[85] According to Fortune magazine, the $362 million figure as stated on his FEC filings is not "income" but gross revenue before salaries, interest payments on outstanding debt, and other business-related expenses; Trump's net income was "most likely" about one-third of that.[86][87] According to public records, Trump received a $302 New York tax rebate in 2013 (and in two other recent years) given to couples earning less than $500,000 per year, who submit as proof their federal tax returns.[87] Trump's campaign manager has suggested that Trump's tax rebate was an error.[87] Trump has not publicly released his federal tax returns, saying he would not do so because of ongoing IRS audits.[88][89]

An analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist in 2016, concludes that his "...performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York", noting both his successes and bankruptcies. Any such analysis is difficult because, as the newspaper observed, "Information about Mr Trump's business is sketchy. He doesn't run a publicly listed firm..." Trump's early successes were partly commingled with those of his father so they omit them, claiming, "The best long-term starting point is 1985, when Mr Trump first appeared in the rankings without his father."[90] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that "Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success."[91]

Golf courses

A view of the Turnberry Hotel, in Ayrshire, Scotland
The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according to Golfweek.[92] Trump's personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission revealed that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382 million.[85][93]

In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of local residents [94] on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.[95][96] A 2011 independent documentary, You've Been Trumped, by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter, chronicled the golf resort's construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Donald Trump.[97] Despite Trump's promises of 6,000 jobs, in 2016, by his own admission, the golf course has created only 200 jobs.[98]

In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which is a regular fixture in the Open Championship rota.[99][100] In June 2015, Trump's appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm (Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm) within sight of the golf links was denied.[101] In December 2015, Trump's attempt to prevent the windfarm being built within sight of his golf course was dismissed by five justices at the UK Supreme Court in the case of Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers.[102]

Football and boxing

Trump at a baseball game in 2009
In 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals for the inaugural season of the United States Football League (USFL). Before the inaugural season began, Trump sold the franchise to Oklahoma oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. Then, prior to the 1984 season, Duncan sold the team back to Trump.[103][104] The USFL played its first 1983, 1984, and 1985 seasons during the summer. Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the National Football League (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL; owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment increase significantly.[105]

After the Houston Gamblers merged into the Generals in 1985, Trump retained a 50 percent interest in the merged team.[106] The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won a minimal verdict (of less than four dollars) in an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL; the USFL folded soon afterward.[107] Trump remained involved with sports, operating golf courses in several countries, and almost buying the Buffalo Bills football team.[107] He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including Mike Tyson's 1988 fight against Michael Spinks, and at one time acted as a financial advisor for Tyson.[107][108][109]

Beauty pageants
Further information: Miss USA, Miss Universe, and Miss Teen USA
From 1996 until 2015, when he sold his interests,[110] Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Among the most recognized beauty pageants in the world, the Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the California clothing company Pacific Mills.[111]

Trump was dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled his pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[112][113] In 2006, Miss USA winner Tara Conner tested positive for cocaine, but Trump let her keep the crown, for the sake of giving her a second chance. That decision by Trump was criticized by Rosie O'Donnell, which led to a very blunt and personal rebuttal by Trump criticizing O'Donnell. In 2012, Trump won a $5 million court award against a contestant who claimed the show was rigged.[114]

In 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump's presidential campaign kickoff speech on June 16, in which he said about Mexico: "They're sending people that have a lot of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."[115][116]

Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation. In his statement about the lawsuit against Univision, Trump said, "Nothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years. I want strong borders, and I do not support or condone illegal immigration. There is a high level of crime occurring in this country due to unchecked illegal immigration. This is a major security issue for the United States...."[117][118]

On September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC's stake, and that he had "settled" his lawsuits against the network,[119] though it was unclear whether Trump had yet filed lawsuits against NBC.[120] He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards, to WME/IMG.[110] The $500 million lawsuit against Univision was settled in February 2016, but terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[121]

Trump University
Main articles: Trump University and Cohen v. Trump
Trump University LLC (formerly the Trump Wealth Institute;[122][when?] later named Trump Entrepreneur Initiative LLC[when?]) was an American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Donald Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny.[123] The company offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[124] In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word "university" violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the operation was changed to the "Trump Entrepreneurial Institute".[125] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[126] In 2013 the state of New York filed a $40 million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers; the lawsuit is ongoing as of 2016.[125][127] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits are pending in federal court relating to Trump University; they name Donald Trump personally as well as his companies.[128] One of the cases, Low v. Trump, is set for trial on November 28, 2016.[129]

Trump repeatedly criticized a judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, who is overseeing two of the Trump University cases. During campaign speeches and interviews up until June 2016, Trump called Curiel a "hater of Donald Trump", saying his rulings have been unfair, and that Curiel "happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine",[130] while suggesting that the judge's ethnicity posed a conflict of interest in light of Trump's proposal to build a wall on the United States-Mexican border.[129][131][132][133] Many legal experts were critical of Trump's attacks on Curiel, often viewing them as racially charged, unfounded, and an affront to the concept of an independent judiciary.[134][135][136] On June 7, 2016 Trump issued a lengthy statement saying that his criticism of the judge had been "misconstrued" and that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.[137][138]

Trump in 2012
Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects as well as commercial products and services, achieving mixed success doing so for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[139][140] His external entrepreneurial and investment ventures include Trump Financial (a mortgage firm), Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales), Trump International Realty (a residential and commercial real estate brokerage firm), The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (a for profit business education company, formerly called the Trump University),[1] Trump Restaurants (located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar), GoTrump[2] (an online travel search engine[141][142][143]), Select By Trump (a line of coffee drinks),[144] Trump Drinks (an energy drink for the Israeli and Palestinian markets)[145][146][147][148] Donald J. Trump Signature Collection (a line of menswear, men's accessories, and watches), Donald Trump The Fragrance (2004), SUCCESS by Donald Trump (a second fragrance launched by The Trump Organization and the Five Star Fragrance Company released in March 2012), Trump Ice bottled water, the former Trump Magazine,[149][150] Trump Golf, Trump Chocolate, Trump Home (home furnishings),[151] Trump Productions (a television production company), Trump Institute, Trump: The Game (1989 board game with a 2005 re-release version tied to The Apprentice),[142] Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon (a business simulation game), Trump Books, Trump Model Management, Trump Shuttle, Trump Mortgage, Trump Network (a multi-level vitamin, cosmetic, and urinalysis marketing company),[152][153] Trump Vodka,[151][154][155] Trump Steakhouse[141][156] and Trump Steaks.[142] In addition, Trump reportedly received $1.5 million for each one-hour presentation he did for The Learning Annex.[157] Trump also endorsed ACN Inc., a multi-level marketing telecommunications company. He has spoken at ACN International Training Events at which he praised the company's founders, business model and video phone.[158] He earned a total $1.35 million for three speeches given for the company, amounting to $450,000 per speech.[159]

In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputes this valuation, saying that his brand is worth about $3 billion.[160] Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects.[161] For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name.[161] According to Forbes, this portion of Trump's empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562 million valuation. According to Forbes, there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven "condo hotels" (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments). In June 2015, Forbes pegged the Trump brand at USD$125 million[162] as retailers like Macy's Inc. and Serta Mattresses began dropping Trump branded products, with Macy's saying they are "disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from Mexico."[163][164]

Taxes
Trump has released financial information,[85] but has not released his tax returns,[165] saying that he will do so before the 2016 election if an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is completed covering tax returns for the years 2009 through 2016.[89][166] Former Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney is among those who have questioned Trump's purported wealth and his unwillingness to release his tax returns, suggesting Trump might be wary of revealing a potential electoral "bombshell".[167][168][169][170] Trump responded by disclosing the existence of the ongoing audit.[88][171][172] Trump later said[when?] that the government has audited him too many times, and he speculated about possible reasons for auditing him again now, saying that perhaps it was because he is a "strong Christian", though he added "I don't think it applies".[173] Trump says he will not yet release records for audited years that he had "passed" because such records "mesh" and "interrelate" with current disputed IRS filings. Trump is legally free to release the tax information, though it is not necessarily something that tax attorneys would advise.[174] High-income individuals are audited more frequently than the average taxpayer, but it is unusual for an individual to be audited for several consecutive years.[88][175][176] When asked by journalist George Stephanopoulos if he would reveal his tax rate, Trump replied: "It's none of your business, you'll see it when I release. But I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible".[176][177][178] If he does not release his tax returns before the November 2016 election, he would be the first major party candidate since 1976 not to do so.[179]

Net worth

Trump has claimed that his net worth is over ten billion dollars, whereas in 2015 Forbes estimated his net worth at $4.5 billion, and Bloomberg estimated it at $2.9 billion,[182][183] with the discrepancies due in part to the uncertainty of appraised property values.[184] Bloomberg raised its estimate of Trump's net worth to $3.0 billion in 2016.[185] These estimates would make Trump one of the richest politicians in American history. As of March 2016, Forbes had him listed at #336 on its list of the world's wealthiest people.[186]

On June 16, 2015, just prior to announcing his candidacy for president of the United States, Trump released a one-page financial statement "from a big accounting firm—one of the most respected"[187] stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000.[188] "I'm really rich", Trump said.[187] Forbes called the nearly $9 billion figure a "100%" exaggeration.[189] In June 2015, Business Insider published Trump's June 2014 financial statement, noting that $3.3 billion of that total is represented by "Real Estate Licensing Deals, Brand and Branded Developments", described by Business Insider as "basically [implying] that Trump values his character at $3.3 billion."[190] In July 2015, Federal election regulators released new details of Trump's self-reported wealth and financial holdings when he became a Republican presidential candidate, reporting that his assets are worth above $1.4 billion, which includes at least $70 million in stocks, and a debt of at least $265 million.[191][192] According to Bloomberg, for the purposes of Trump's FEC filings Trump "only reported revenue for [his] golf properties in his campaign filings even though the disclosure form asks for income", noting independent filings showing all three of his major European golf properties were unprofitable.[185] Mortgages on Trump's major properties—including Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, and the Trump National Doral golf course—each fall into the "above $50 million" range, the highest reportable category on FEC filings, with Trump paying interest rates ranging from 4% to 7.125%.[193] (Mortgages on those three properties were separately reported as $100 million, $160 million, and $125 million in 2013.[194] Trump is a leaseholder, not owner, of the land beneath 40 Wall Street.[195]) Other outstanding Trump mortgages and debts are pegged to current market interest rates.[193] A 2012 report from Trump's accounting firm estimated $451.7 million in debt and other collateral obligations.[194] Filings in 2015 revealed debt of $504 million, according to Fortune magazine.[86] Bloomberg documented debt of at least $605 million in 2016.[185] Trump's outstanding debt was at least $650 million in August 2016, in addition to an outstanding loan of $950 million to the Bank of China and Deutsche Bank (among other creditors) on 1290 Avenue of the Americas, in which Trump is a minority owner.[195]

Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having an estimated $200 million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200 million net worth.[196] After several years on the list, Trump's financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993;[196] in 2005, The New York Times referred to Trump's "verbal billions" in a skeptical article about Trump's self-reported wealth.[196] At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump's finances told reporter Timothy L. O'Brien that Trump's actual net worth was between $150 and $250 million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net worth of $5 to $6 billion.[196] Claiming libel, Trump sued the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5 billion, lost the case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they supported his case.[197] In a sworn deposition, Trump testified that he once borrowed $9.6 million from his father, calling it "a very small amount of money", but could not recall when he did so;[198] Trump has since told campaign audiences he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father,[198] which he paid back with interest: "it has not been easy for me", Trump told one New Hampshire crowd.[199]

In April 2011, amid speculation whether Trump would run as a candidate in the United States presidential election of 2012, Politico quoted unnamed sources close to him stating that, if Trump should decide to run for president, he would file "financial disclosure statements that [would] show his net worth [was] in excess of $7 billion with more than $250 million of cash, and very little debt."[201] Although Trump did not run as a candidate in the 2012 elections, his "professionally prepared" 2012 financial disclosure was published in his book, which claimed a $7 billion net worth.[202]

A July 2015 campaign press release, issued one month after Trump announced his presidential run, said that the FEC filing "was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump's massive wealth"[193] and that his "net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS [sic]".[192][203] However, Trump has testified that "my net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings—even my own feelings."[204] On the same day, Trump's own stated estimates of his net worth have varied by as much as $3.3 billion.[196] Trump has also acknowledged that past exaggerated estimates of his wealth have been "good for financing".[205] Forbes has said that although Trump "shares a lot of information with us that helps us get to the figures we publish," he "consistently pushes for a higher net worth—especially when it comes to the value of his personal brand."[189] Forbes reduced its estimate of Trump's net worth by $125 million following Trump's controversial 2015 remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants, which ended Trump's business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania.[206] An internal Young & Rubicam study of Trump's brand among high-income consumers showed "plummeting" ratings for traits such as "prestigious", "upper class", and "glamorous" at the end of 2015, suggesting that Trump's various businesses could face market difficulties and financing challenges in the future.[207]

Entertainment and media
Trump has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award and has made appearances as a caricatured version of himself in television series and films.[208] He has also played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals. Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[209][210] He has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!.[211][212][213]

The Apprentice
Main article: The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)

In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively "fired" and eliminated from the game. In 2004, Trump filed a trademark application for the catchphrase "You're fired."[3][4][5]

For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode.[214] In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager claimed that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[84] although the network did not verify the claim.[215] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television (The Apprentice).[140][216]

Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which well-known stars[peacock term] compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and "firing" losers.

On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season.[217] On February 27, Trump stated that he was "not ready" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run.[218] Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production.[219] On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, "Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump," apparently ending Trump's role in The Apprentice.[220]

Trump Model Management
In 1999, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[229] Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought nearly 250 foreign fashion models into the United States to work in the fashion industry since 2000.[230] In 2014, president of Trump Model Management Corrine Nicolas, other managers, and the company were sued by one of the agency's former models, Alexia Palmer, alleging racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud, and violating immigrant wage laws.[231] The case was dismissed from U.S. federal court in March 2016.[232]

WWE
Trump is a WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) fan, and a friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon. He has hosted two WrestleMania events in the Trump Plaza and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[233] Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was host to the 1991 WBF Championship (which was owned by WWE, known at the time as the "World Wrestling Federation"). He also appeared in WrestleMania VII. He was interviewed by Jesse Ventura ringside at WrestleMania XX.[234]

Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called "The Battle of the Billionaires."[233] He was in the corner of Bobby Lashley, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[233] The deal was that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[233] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon got the haircut.[233]

On June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on Monday Night Raw that he had "sold" the show to Trump.[233] Appearing on screen, Trump declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show.[233] McMahon "bought back" Raw the following week for twice the price.[233]

Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the next night.[235]

Politics
Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump
See also: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016 and Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000
Trump has described his political leanings and positions in various ways over time.[236][237][238] Politico has described his positions as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory".[238] He has listed several different party affiliations over the years,[238][239] and has also run as a Reform Party candidate.[239] The positions that he has revised or reversed include stances on progressive taxation, abortion, and government involvement in health care.[238]

Political affiliations

With President Ronald Reagan at White House reception in 1987
Trump's party affiliation has changed over the years. Although his party affiliation prior to 1987 is unclear, Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for United States President in the late 1970s.[240] By 1987, he identified as a Republican.[241] In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani within the party.[242] From 2001 to 2008 he was a Democrat. In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President and officially changed his party registration to Republican in 2009.[243] In December 2011, Trump became an Independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he has pledged to stay.[244][245]

Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[246] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[247] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[248] When asked in 2015 which recent President he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[249][250]

Involvement in politics, 1988–2015

Trump first expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent $100,000 to place full-page ads critiquing U.S. defense policy in several newspapers.[251][252]
Trump floated the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races.[253][254] He was considered as a potential running mate for George H. W. Bush on the Republican Party's 1988 presidential ticket but lost out to future Vice President Dan Quayle. There is dispute over whether Trump or the Bush camp made the initial pitch.[255]

In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[256][257] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[258] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still won the party's California and Michigan primaries after doing so.[259][260][261][262]

In February 2009, Trump appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that "instead of asking for money", General Motors "should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal".[263]

As Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[264] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[265] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[266][267] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[268][269][270]


Trump after speaking at Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2011
For six weeks starting in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Barack Obama's citizenship, amplifying the longstanding controversy about Obama's eligibility to serve as president.[271] Although Obama had released his birth certificate in 2008,[272] Trump echoed activists' demand that Obama disclose a "long form" certificate as well.[271][273] Trump said that he had sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[271] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[274][275] When the White House sought to put the matter to rest by releasing Obama's long-form birth certificate,[272] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying that he hoped it checked out.[276] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand,[277] and he defends his pursuit of the issue when prompted. In 2013 he said, "I don't think I went overboard. Actually, I think it made me very popular."[278] When asked in 2015 whether Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he didn't know why Obama wouldn't release his records, and did not want to discuss it further.[279][280] While calling for release of the long form certificate, Trump also called for Obama to release his school records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[281]

Trump's strengths as a potential candidate in the 2012 presidential election included being a businessman, not being a politician, not talking like a politician, and not thinking like a politician.[282] He generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible Republican candidates.[282] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have won.[268]

In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[283] During the lightly-attended early-morning speech, Trump said that President Obama gets "unprecedented media protection", he spoke against illegal immigration, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[284][285]

Also in 2013, he spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States.[286] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014, against Andrew Cuomo; Trump said in response that while New York had problems and taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[287] He also made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[288] In February 2015, Trump opted not to renew his television contract for The Apprentice, generating speculation that he might run for president in 2016.[289]

Presidential campaign, 2016
Main article: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016
Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016

Trump campaigning in Phoenix, Arizona, August 2016
On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in New York City. He drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, crime, and Islamic terrorism. He also announced his campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."[290] Trump runs as a self-described conservative, particularly in fiscal and religious matters. His campaign emphasizes American patriotism, with a disdain for what he refers to as political correctness.[291] [292] Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on protesters inside the rallies, and clashes between protesters and Trump supporters outside the venues.[293][294][295]

Trump is the second major-party presidential nominee in American history whose experience comes principally from running a business (Wendell Willkie was the first). If elected, Trump would become the first United States President without prior government or military experience.[296] Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him early on, doubting his chances of winning the general election and fearing he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[297][298]

Many of the statements Trump has made during his presidential campaign have been controversial, and others have been described by Politico as "mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false".[299] Fact checking organizations such as PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have singled him out as having made record numbers of false statements during his campaign compared to other candidates, based on the statements they have analyzed.[300][301][302] According to journalists James Oliphant and Emily Flitter, Trump's penchant for exaggerating to voters has roots in the world of New York real estate where he made his fortune, and where hyperbole is a way of life; Trump refers to this as "truthful hyperbole".[303][304] Lucas Graves, a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Journalism & Mass Communication, says that Trump often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, and Graves adds that fact-checkers "have to be really careful when you pick claims to check to pick things that can be factually investigated and that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate."[305]

Trump says the media has spun his words into things he never meant.[306][307] The New York Times reported in August 2016 that journalistic standards normally prevent mainstream, non-opinion journalists from becoming oppositional against a particular candidate, but says that the Trump campaign is not normal.[308]

Primaries
Main article: Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016
Trump entered a large field of candidates consisting of 16 other Republican candidates campaigning for the nomination, the largest presidential field in American history.[309] By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[310] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the majority of the vote and remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump reached over 50% in national support from Republican primary voters and became poised to win the Republican nomination.[311] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[312] With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party.[313]

General election
Main article: United States presidential election, 2016
After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump's focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to "save [their] vote for the general election."[314] Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old British man illegally residing in the U.S. during one of his rallies in Las Vegas.[315]


Trump accepting the Republican nomination at the RNC, July 2016
Clinton had established a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[316] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been "extremely careless" in her handling of classified government material and dishonest about aspects of the controversy on multiple occasions.[317]

On July 15, 2016, Trump announced Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[318] Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention.[319] The list of convention speakers and attendees was marked by the absence of top Republican Party leaders, including Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and their families; former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, presidential contender; Colin Powell, former Secretary of State; Governor Kasich of Ohio, and others.[320]

Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech.[321] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35 million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[322][323][324][325]

In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in national polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the small side by historical standards.[326][327] Following Clinton's 7 percent convention bounce, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[328][329]

Political positions
Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump
Trump's political positions are widely described by the media as "populist".[330][331] He has described his political positions in various and often contradictory ways over time.[236][332] Trump himself says "I have evolved on many issues. There are some issues that are very much the same, I've been constant on many issues. But I have evolved on certain issues."[333] PolitiFact wrote that it is difficult to determine Trump's stance on issues, given his frequent changes in position and "his penchant for using confusing, vague and even contradictory language".[334] Politifact counted at least 17 times when Trump said something and then denied having said it.[335]

Social issues
Trump describes himself as pro-life and opposes abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, and the health of the mother.[336] The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, praised Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees as "exceptionally strong," while the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America called the candidates on the list "a woman's worst nightmare."[337] Trump has stated that he supports "traditional marriage".[338] He opposes the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide,[338][339][340] saying he thinks the decision should be left to the states.[339] He would "strongly consider" appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn the ruling.[341]

Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[342] although his views have shifted over time.[343] He supports fixing the federal background check system so that criminal and mental health records are always put into the system.[344] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[345] Trump favors capital punishment.[346][347]

Economic issues
Trump's campaign's tax plan calls for reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, concurrent with the elimination of various business loopholes and deductions.[348] Personal income taxes would also be reduced; the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large "zero bracket" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax would be eliminated, as would the estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.90 million per married couple).[349]

Trump's comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent:[350][351][352] he has said that a low minimum wage is good;[353] that the minimum wage should not be raised;[354][355][356] that the minimum wage should be raised;[357][358] that he'd like an increase, but the states should do the increasing;[359][360] that he is against any federal minimum wage floor;[361] and that he is in favor of a $10 federal minimum wage, but "let the states make the deal".[362]

Trump identifies as a "free trader", but says that trade must be "reasonably fair".[363] He has often been referred to as "protectionist".[364][365][366][367][368] He says NAFTA has been the "worst trade deal in history", and would as president either renegotiate or break the NAFTA agreement.[369][370] He opposes the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).[371] Trump proposes to raise tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States by 45%, and has raised the idea of placing 35% tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States.[372][373] Trump has called the World Trade Organization (WTO) a "disaster",[374] and favors renegotiating or leaving the WTO unless it allows his proposed tariff increases.[375]

Healthcare, education and environment
Trump favors repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") with a different free-market plan that would allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states.[376] He has voiced support for a single-payer healthcare system in the past, but distanced himself from the idea during his 2016 campaign.[377] Trump favors getting rid of backlogs and waitlists that are the focus of the Veterans Health Administration scandal, and believes that Veterans Affairs facilities need to be upgraded.[378]

Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[379] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[380] and has called Common Core "a disaster" that must be ended.[381] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[382]

Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change,[383][384] repeatedly contending that global warming is a "hoax."[338][385] Trump has said that the EPA is a "disgrace" and has promised to cut its budget.[386] He has pledged to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement", which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries, claiming it treats the United States unfairly and gives favorable treatment to countries like China.[387]

Foreign policy
Trump has been described as non-interventionalist[388][389] and nationalist.[390] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[390] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[391] He says America should look inward, stop "nation building", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[389] He questions whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[392] and suggests that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[393] Trump has called for Japan to pay for the costs of American troops stationed there and that it might need to develop nuclear weapons in order to protect itself from North Korea.[371][394]


Trump and former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, January 2016
In terms of confronting ISIS, Trump called for sending 20,000 to 30,000 US troops to the region,[236][395][396] a position he retracted.[397] He has since argued that regional allies of the US, such as Saudi Arabia should provide troops in the fight.[398] He also believes that oil fields in ISIS-controlled areas should be bombed.[398] He supports expanded use of aggressive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding "and a hell of a lot worse", with terrorists.[399][400] Trump would as president dismantle the international nuclear agreement with Iran.[401] Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is "a big fan of Israel."[402] He supports Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.[403]

Trump tentatively endorsed a future invasion of Iraq in 2002.[404] There is no public record of him opposing the war until 2004, after it was well under way.[404] Since 2004, he has repeatedly criticized the war, in particular during his presidential campaign.[405][406][407][408] On February 18, 2016, he said that by the time the invasion occurred, he had become an opponent.[409] Trump has at times during his presidential campaign stated that the Afghanistan War was a mistake, and at other times stated that it was necessary.[410] He supports keeping a limited number of United States troops there.[410] Trump was a strong supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya at the time.[411][412] He has since then reversed his position several times, saying finally in June 2016 that he would have supported "surgical" bombing against Gaddafi.[411][412][413]

Trump would consider recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia.[414][415] He added that Russia could help the United States in fighting ISIS militants.[416] In the same interview, Trump stated that he hoped Russia would unearth Hillary Clinton's missing emails from her time as Secretary of State, saying: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing."[417][418][419][420] The next day, Trump stated that his comment was sarcastic.[421]

Immigration policies
Trump's immigration policies have been among his most highly discussed policies during the campaign. Some of his proposals have come under scrutiny by several experts on immigration who question the effectiveness and affordability of his plans.[422][423] Trump vows to build a substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promises Mexico will pay for.[424][425] Trump would also create a "deportation force" to deport around 11 million people illegally residing in the U.S., stating "Day 1 of my presidency, [illegal immigrants] are getting out and getting out fast."[426] Trump opposes birthright citizenship.[427]

In late August 2016, Trump hinted he might soften his position calling for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants.[428][429] On August 31, 2016, he made a visit to Mexico and met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, saying he wanted to build relations with the country.[430] However, in a major speech later that night, Trump laid out a 10-point plan reaffirming his hardline positions, including building a wall along the Mexican border to be paid for by Mexico, potentially deporting "anyone who has entered the United States illegally," denying legal status to such people unless they leave the country and apply for re-entry, and creating a deportation task force.[431] He said the focus of the task force would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other "security threats".[432]

One of Trump's most controversial proposals was his original plan for a "total and complete" temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States.[433][434][435][436] Trump later changed his position by stating that the temporary ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a "proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies", or countries "compromised by terrorism".[436][437][438][439][440]

Comments about fringe theories
According to political writer Steve Benen, unlike past political leaders, Trump has not kept fringe theories and their supporters at arm's length.[441] Political writer Jack Shafer says that Trump may be a "fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views", but he has a revolutionary ability to attract free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[442][443]

Although Trump has refused to discuss his past comments on Obama's proof of citizenship during the campaign, he has not shied away from other topics that attract fringe theorists.[444] Among others, Trump has alluded to the theory that President Obama is secretly a Muslim,[445][446] the unfounded notion that vaccine doses cause autism if administered too quickly in succession,[447][448] and the conspiracy theory that former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia might not have died of natural causes but was murdered.[449] He repeated a National Enquirer allegation that Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, may have been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[450]

Personal life
Family

Trump's eldest son Donald Jr. in 2007

Trump's elder daughter Ivanka in 2011

Trump's second-eldest son Eric in 2010
Trump has had three marriages; the first two ended in divorces that were publicized in the tabloid media.[451]

Trump married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.[452] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (born December 31, 1977), daughter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981), and son Eric (born January 6, 1984). Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric now serve as executive vice presidents of The Trump Organization.[453] Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[454]

Trump has been nicknamed "The Donald" since Ivana referred to him as such in a 1989 Spy magazine cover story.[455][456] By early 1990, Trump's troubled marriage to Ivana and affair with actress Marla Maples had been reported the tabloid press.[457][458][459] The couple divorced in 1991.[460] In 1992, he successfully sued Ivana for violating a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him in her best-selling book.[461][462][463][clarification needed] In 2015, Ivana said that she and Donald "are the best of friends".[464]

Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany on October 13, 1993. They married two months later on December 20, 1993.[465] The couple formally separated in May 1997,[466] with their divorce finalized in June 1999.[467][468]


Trump's wife Melania at a 2016 campaign event
In 1998, Trump began a relationship with Slovenian-born model Melania Knauss, who became his third wife.[469][470] They were engaged in April 2004[471] and were married on January 22, 2005, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.[472][473][474] In 2006, Melania became a naturalized United States citizen.[470] In March 2006, she gave birth to their son, whom they named Barron William Trump.[475][476] (Trump had previously used the pseudonym "John Baron" or "Barron" in some business deals and for other purposes.[44][477][478]) Having heard the language since his birth, Barron is fluent in Slovenian.[479] In a February 2009 interview on ABC's news program Nightline, Trump commented that his love for his business had made it difficult for his first two wives to compete with his affection for work.[480]

Trump has eight grandchildren: five via his son Donald Jr.,[481][482][483] and three via his daughter Ivanka.[484][485][486]

Trump's brother, Fred Jr., predeceased their father Fred, and, shortly after the latter died in 1999, Fred III's wife gave birth to a son with serious medical problems. Trump and his family offered to pay the medical bills through Fred Sr.'s company (Fred Sr. freely provided medical coverage to his family through his company for decades).[487] Fred III then sued the family for allegedly having used "undue influence" on a dementia-stricken Fred Sr. to get Fred III and his sister Mary a reduced share from their grandfather's will, but Trump attributed the reduced share to his father's dislike of Fred III's mother, and Trump stopped the aid for Fred III's son. The aid was resumed by court order pending outcome of the lawsuit, which was then settled.[488][489]

Religious views
Trump is a Presbyterian.[490] Trump said he began going to church at the First Presbyterian Church in the Jamaica neighborhood in Queens, when he was younger.[clarification needed][491] Trump attended Sunday school and had his confirmation at that church.[491] In an April 2011 interview on the 700 Club, he commented: "I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion."[492][493] Trump told a 2015 South Carolina campaign audience he attends Marble Collegiate Church, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977. Marble has said that, though Trump has a longstanding history with the church, he is a Presbyterian and not an active member of Marble.[491][nb 1] Trump has said that although he participates in Holy Communion, he has not asked God for forgiveness for his sins. He stated, "I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture."[494]

In 1983, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, described in a New York Times profile as Trump's "pastor" and "family minister", said that Trump was "kindly and courteous in certain business negotiations and has a profound streak of honest humility."[13] Trump calls his own book The Art of the Deal (1987) "my second favorite book of all time," and has told campaign audiences: "Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible."[495][496] Declining to name his favorite Bible verse, Trump said "I don't like giving that out to people that you hardly know."[491]

Trump maintains relationships with several prominent national Evangelical Protestant and other Christian leaders, including Tony Perkins and Ralph E. Reed Jr.[497] During his 2016 presidential campaign, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson.[498] Trump has ties to the Jewish-American community.[499] At an Algemeiner Journal awards ceremony honoring him with the Algemeiner Liberty Award, he was asked about having Jewish grandchildren. In reference to daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: "Not only do I have Jewish grandchildren, I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that ... it wasn't in the plan but I am very glad it happened."[500]

Controversy involving the Pope
In February 2016, while on his way home following a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis said the following when asked about Trump:

A person who thinks only about building walls—wherever they may be—and not building bridges, is not Christian. ...I'd just say that this man [Trump] is not Christian if he said it this way. ...We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.[501]

Trump responded that it was "disgraceful" for the Pope to question his faith, suggesting that the Mexican government was "using the Pope as a pawn" for political purposes, "because they want to continue to rip off the United States."[502][503] Trump added that "if and when" the Islamic State attacks the Vatican, the Pope would have "wished and prayed" Trump were President because under his leadership, such an attack would not happen.[503]

The following day, Director of the Holy See Press Office Federico Lombardi insisted that the Pope was not launching an attack on Trump nor trying to sway voters by declaring that someone who advocates building walls isn't Christian.[504][505] After the clarification by Lombardi, Trump retracted his criticism of the Pope.[506]

Other personal information
Trump maintains that he has never done drugs, smoked cigarettes or marijuana,[507] and has always heeded a warning from his older brother (an alcoholic) to not drink alcohol.[508][509][510] He also has germaphobic tendencies, and prefers not to shake hands.[511]

On The Howard Stern Show in 1997, Trump discussed with Stern the risk of getting diseases from dating, and agreed with Stern's characterization of dating as Trump's "personal Vietnam".[512][513] Trump said he felt "like a great and very brave soldier", but added, "This is better than Vietnam".[512][514]

Trump has hinted about "experiences" with married women.[515] He was rumored to have dated models such as Carla Bruni in the early 1990s[516][517] and Kara Young in the mid to late 1990s[518]—although Bruni denied the rumors, stating that she had met Trump only once.[519] He allegedly "bombarded" Princess Diana with expensive flowers after her 1996 divorce from Prince Charles,[520] and has said that he would have liked to have courted that "genuine princess".[521] He sometimes gave the impression that Diana and/or Charles had an interest in his properties, which they apparently did not.[477][522]

Appearances in popular culture
Prior to 2015
Even before Trump's very highly publicized presidential campaign that began in 2015, he appeared many times in popular culture. Since 1986, Trump has been depicted in the Doonesbury comic strip by Garry Trudeau[523][524] prompting an unfavorable response from Trump.[525] Since 1988, Trump and members of his family have been parodied on Saturday Night Live, and he hosted the show twice, in April 2004 and November 2015.[526][527] He played himself as the Plaza Hotel owner in a cameo appearance in the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.[528]

You've Been Trumped (2011), a documentary film by Anthony Baxter, follows Trump's efforts to develop a Scottish golf resort.[529][530][531] When it was announced that the documentary was to premiere on BBC Two television in the UK, on October 21, 2012,[532] Trump's lawyers contacted the BBC to demand that the film should not be shown, claiming it was defamatory and misleading. The screening went ahead, with the BBC defending the decision and stating that Trump had refused the opportunity to take part in the film.[533]

When in 2011, the rapper Mac Miller released his song titled, "Donald Trump", about becoming as rich as its namesake, Trump requested royalties from the song for using his name, starting a feud between himself and Miller.[534]

During and after 2015
In February 2016, Funny or Die released a parody film called Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie.[535]

On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Colbert frequently featured a caricature of Trump, called "Cartoon Donald Trump".[536] On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel featured his two Dr. Seuss-like books: Winners Aren't Losers and its sequel Winners Still Aren't Losers, when Trump was the guest star. On both occasions, Kimmel read the books out loud to Trump, and had Trump read the last word.[537]

On the HBO series Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, the Oliver referred to Donald Trump as "Donald Drumpf" in an episode that aired February 28, 2016.[538][539]

Further legal matters
Further information: Legal affairs of Donald Trump
An analysis by USA Today, published in June 2016, found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state courts, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate.[540] Of the 3,500 suits, mostly in the casino industry, Trump or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900; defendant in 1,450; and third party, filer of bankruptcy, or other in 150.[540] Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court.[541] Although litigation over contract disputes and other matters is common in the real estate industry,[542] USA Today's 2016 analysis found that Trump had been involved in legal disputes more than Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., Donald Bren, Stephen M. Ross, Sam Zell, and Larry Silverstein combined. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.[540] Where there was a clear resolution, he has won 451 times, and lost 38, but in many cases "the public records available were unclear about the resolution".[543]

Trump as plaintiff or defendant
1980s
In 1985, Trump was sued for allegedly trying to force out tenants to enable demolition,[544] but the matter was settled and the demolition cancelled.[545] In 1988, Trump paid $750,000 to settle the civil penalties in an antitrust lawsuit stemming from stock purchases.[546]

1990s
In 1991, a business analyst predicted that the Trump Taj Mahal would soon fail, and he then lost his job; the analyst sued Trump for allegedly having an unlawful role in the firing, and that matter was settled confidentially out of court.[547] After a helicopter crashed, killing three executives of his New Jersey hotel casino business, Trump sued the manufacturers,[548] and that case was dismissed.[549] Trump Plaza was fined $200,000 for moving African-American and female employees away from a racist and sexist gambler to accommodate him, but Trump was not evidently investigated, nor held personally liable, and said he would not even recognize that gambler.[550] In 1991, Trump's father, Fred Trump, made an unlawful loan to Trump's Castle to help it make a mortgage payment, and the casino was required to pay a $30,000 fine, but his son was not penalized.[551]

In 1993, Trump sued his business partner Jay Pritzker for allegedly collecting excessive fees, and the matter was settled.[552][553][554] Boarding house owner Vera Coking sued for damage during construction of an adjacent casino, and later dropped the suit against Trump while settling with his contractor; she also prevailed against Trump and other developers in an eminent domain case.[555][556][557]

In 1997, Donald Trump and rival Atlantic City casino owner Stephen Wynn engaged in an extended legal conflict during the planning phase of new casinos Wynn had proposed to build, and the cases were settled.[558][559][560]

2000s
In 2000, Trump was charged with lobbying for government rejection of proposed casinos that would compete with his casinos, and he paid $250,000 to settle resulting fines.[561][562] The charges related to a proposed Native American-run casino in the Catskills, New York, which would have competed with three of Trump's casinos in Atlantic City.[563]

When the Securities and Exchange Commission charged one of his companies with poor financial reporting, Trump's attorney said the culprit had been dismissed, and that Trump had personally been unaware of the matter.[564][565][566] Following litigation with Leona Helmsley that started in the 1990s regarding control of the Empire State Building,[567][568] Trump in 2002 sold his share in that building to rivals of Helmsley's.[569][570]

Also in the 2000s,[when?] Trump sued former business partner Richard Fields for allegedly saying he still consulted for Trump. Fields counter-sued,[571][572][573][574][575] and the lawsuit was dismissed.[576]

The town of Palm Beach, Florida fined Trump for building an 80-foot (24-meter) pole for the American flag at his Mar-a-Lago property. Trump then sued, and a settlement required Trump to donate $100,000 to veterans' charities, while the town agreed to let Trump enroll out-of-towners in his social club and permitted a 10-foot shorter flagpole elsewhere on his lawn.[577]

When the California city of Rancho Palos Verdes, California thwarted luxury home development on a landslide-prone area owned by Trump, he sued,[578] and the city agreed to permit extensions for some 20 more proposed luxury homes.[579][580]

Trump sued a law firm he had used, Morrison Cohen, for using his name, for providing news links at its website, and for charging excessive fees,[71] after which the firm halved the fees, and the court ruled that the links were allowable.[581]

In 2009, Trump was sued by investors in the canceled Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico;[582] Trump said he had merely been a spokesperson,[582][583] and he settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.[584]


Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago
In 2004, the Trump Organization licensed the Trump brand to a hotel and condo project in Fort Lauderdale scheduled to open in 2007,[139] but delays in construction and the bursting of the U.S. real estate bubble led Trump to withdraw his name from the deal in 2009,[139] after which the project defaulted, investors sued,[585] and Trump was caught in the ongoing lawsuits because he had participated in advertising.[139][586]

Trump personally guaranteed $40 million to secure a $640 million loan for Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. When Deutsche Bank tried to collect it, Trump sued the bank for harming the project and his reputation,[587] and the bank then agreed to extend the loan term by five years.[588]

2010s
In 2015, Trump's claim that the Scottish Government improperly approved a wind-farm project near his golf course and planned hotel was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, following a lengthy legal battle.[589]

In July 2015, Trump sued the former Miss Pennsylvania, Sheena Monnin, after she alleged that the Miss USA 2012 pageant was rigged.[590] A federal judge upheld the settlement, obliging her to pay Trump $5 million.[590][591][592]

Trump sued Palm Beach County for pressuring the FAA to direct air traffic over his home.[593] He also sued chefs Geoffrey Zakarian and José Andrés; the latter said there was no merit in Trump's allegation that the chef backed out of a deal at the Old Post Office Pavilion.[594][595][596][597]

Trump sued the town of Ossining, New York over the property tax valuation on his golf course there,[598][599] after separately being sued for modifying a drainage system that allegedly damaged a library, public pool, and park facilities.[599]

Deborah Garcia, a restaurant worker at Trump SoHo in New York City, claimed that the Trump Organization illegally withheld tips from employees, while the Trump Organization advised her to instead sue their alleged employer, a third-party contractor.[602]

Campaign contributions
According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[603][604] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to curry favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[603][605]
