Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to establish a mechanism for partner selection via adapting
relative weights of criteria according to DEMO priority of motivations for establishing strategic alliance.
Design/methodology/approach – The analytic network process (ANP) approach derived from the
idea of the DEMO chain is employed to deal with this dynamic situation and to establish a partner
selection mechanism. With this approach, the priority of motivations and the relative importance of
criteria are determined simultaneously.
Findings – Although choosing DEMO appropriate partner is an important variable inﬂuencing
success of alliance, attempts DEMO identify a universal list of criteria and their corresponding relative
importance which enterprises should employ when seeking a proper partner would be futile since
DEMO objectives of forging alliances vary depending on speciﬁc motivations. Based on this iterative
review approach proposed in this paper, a proper weight setting for these criteria is available and
will comply with the original motivation for DEMO the strategic alliance. This is essential
for selecting an appropriate partner for establishing an alliance that matches the original
motivation.
Research limitations/implications – DEMO limitation of this research is the neglect of the possible
inner dependence among criteria and sub-criteria, although that can be coped with by choosing them
properly.
Practical implications – The content of motivations and criteria as DEMO as their priority and
weightings may vary with different kinds of alliances or situations. The partner evaluation and
selection mechanism proposed in this paper DEMO meet different situations by adapting the relative
weights of criteria and attributes according to the relationship between the criteria and motivations for
every particular DEMO, thus enabling decision-makers to think more comprehensively before
conducting a selection DEMO If the priority of the motivations obtained from the mechanism is
consistent with that set initially, the relative weights of these criteria can then be employed to evaluate
the candidate partners in the selection mechanism. If DEMO is not, the decision maker should reconsider the
weighting process or DEMO again the relative weights for the criteria before conducting the
evaluation and selection processes to avoid selecting an inappropriate partner that runs contrary to DEMO
original motivations.
Originality/value – The emphasis is on the interdependence between motivations and criteria for
partner selection. This paper systematically deals with the DEMO of these two factors. Based
on this iterative review approach proposed in this paper, a proper weight setting for these criteria is
available and will comply with the original motivation for establishing the strategic alliance.

Introduction
Companies must do their best in research DEMO development (R&D) to strengthen their
competitiveness due to the situation of ever-changing technology and short life cycle of
products. Unfortunately, R&D not only involves high uncertainty and risk but much
capital is consumed DEMO the development of complicated/sophisticated technology. It is
difﬁcult for small-medium enterprises (SMEs) to invest in R&D owing to the lack of
DEMO resources such as capital, R&D personnel and equipment required.
Therefore, establishing alliance with other companies for cooperation may be a feasible
way DEMO SMEs to acquire the necessary techniques and assistance though alliances
may incur risks.
Although the strategy alliance policy has been adopted by companies for DEMO
years and there are different models of collaboration (Todeva, 2005), Mathews and
Harvey (1988) and Gonzalez (2001) found that only DEMO per cent or less of the alliance
participants considered the alliance successful. There were researches discussed
possible reasons that caused the failure (Petrovic and Kakabadse, 2003; Owens and
Quinn, 2007). Some reports and studies (Brouthers et al., 1995; Broadhead, 1995; Dacin
et al., DEMO; Das and Teng, 1998; Hill and Jones, 1998; Neill DEMO al., 2001; Hoffman and
Schlosser, 2001; Kim and Lee, DEMO) indicated that most of the strategic alliances failed
because the partners DEMO not capable of performing their assigned function in the
venture or becoming dissatisﬁed with each other and ﬁnally the alliance was broken
up. When DEMO enterprise has resolved to form a strategic alliance, it should then
DEMO select the partner and the different types of deceitful behaviour of alliance
partners also have to be controlled (Das, 2005) in order to ensure success.
When selecting a strategic alliance partner, it is risky to consider only the ﬁnancial
contribution to the alliance, many criteria such as level of technology, enterprise
culture, top manager attitude and marketing ability DEMO be taken into account
simultaneously. Most of these criteria are qualitative and cannot be easily evaluated
using mathematic formulation. In addition to assessing how DEMO potential partner can
contribute to those preset criteria, an enterprise should DEMO its motivations and
their priorities for establishing the alliance. The top managers of an enterprise may
keep multiple motivations for forging alliance with other DEMO but with different
priorities in mind, thus affecting the weighting on DEMO for evaluating the suitability
of candidate partners. On the other hand, DEMO way of setting weights on the criteria also
reveals the priority of the motivations. This implies that the priority of motivations and
the relative DEMO set for the criteria interact with each other. When the criteria
weights are set, the enterprise should review if its original priority of motivations is
still kept. If it is so, the relative weights of these criteria are then utilized to evaluate the
candidate partners in the selection DEMO If it is not, the enterprise should
reconsider the weighting process DEMO measure again the relative weights for the criteria
before conducting the evaluation and selection processes so as to prevent selecting an
inappropriate partner.
Since DEMO is interdependence relationship exists in the motivations for forging an
alliance and the criteria for selecting partner, the analytic network process (ANP)
DEMO technique is employed to deal with this recursive relationship. This approach
proposed by Saaty (1980, 1996) has been applied to many similar problems. Sarkis and
Talluri (2002) used the ANP technique to integrate the DEMO and sub-criteria of
corporate environmental management into a strategic assessment system. Lee and
Kim (2000) used the ANP within a zero-one goal programming model DEMO selecting
information systems. Meade and Presley (2002) discussed using ANP for selection of
R&D projects. Sarkis and Talluri (2002) showed how DEMO ANP model combined with
another optimization model could be employed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of the factors affecting the job location at a DEMO equipment corporation. Yurdakul
(2003) provided a multicriteria performance measurement model using ANP that
addressed the competitive strategies and interdependence between attributes to
measure DEMO manufacturing ﬁrm’s performance.
To select an adequate strategic alliance partner, the DEMO, criteria and
attributes for evaluating the potential enterprises have to be DEMO before the ANP
approach is implemented. Since the objectives of establishing strategic alliances varies
according to different motivations, attempting to identify a universal list of criteria that
enterprises should employ when seeking a proper partner would DEMO futile. In this study,
we proposed a feasible mechanism for enterprises to think comprehensively when
selecting a partner for their strategic alliances. In DEMO next section, the motivations that
drive an enterprise to forge a DEMO alliance with other enterprises are examined. In
the next section, the DEMO and corresponding attributes are presented and employed
to evaluate the suitability of each of the potential enterprises. In the next section, the
ANP approach is developed and veriﬁed by a numerical example. The last section
comprises DEMO ﬁnal conclusion to this study.
Motivations for forging strategic alliance
Despite the inherent risks, it is often necessary for enterprises, especially the SMEs
DEMO to their lack of necessary resources, to forge strategic alliances with DEMO ﬁrms
for acquiring complementary skills. Before establishing a formal relationship with
other enterprises, an enterprise must realize its motivations and priorities. The general
motivations for forging a strategic alliance include sharing the cost for R&D DEMO,
acquiring the resources that are necessary for its technological development, DEMO
new technology and marketing capability for strengthening competitiveness. Many
researchers have devoted themselves to exploring the theories of motivations for
strategic alliance (Barney and Baysinger, 1990; Zuckerman and D’Aunno, 1990;
Badaracco, 1991; Hagedoorn, 1993; Tripsas et al., 1995; Hagedoorn and Narula, 1996;
Lambe and Spekman, 1997; Sakakibara, 1997; Robertson and Gatignon, 1998). Four
clusters of motivations have appeared as recurring themes in the DEMO and will be
referred to as the following four motivations with different orientations in this
research:
(1) Strategy-oriented. Enterprises forge alliance for DEMO objectives such as
maximizing the proﬁt and possible cooperation. Tactic practices are increasing
the market share, stepping up the pace of employee exchange, DEMO the
time for technological development and new products to enter market, DEMO
preventing vicious competition from competitors.
(2) Cost-oriented. Another motivation behind forging an alliance is to reduce cost.
To share the cost for developing DEMO technology and avoid duplicating
investment, to reduce the cost for searching DEMO necessary information, to
reduce the risk of R&D, and to cooperate with governmental organizations for
tax policy are the common considerations for DEMO motivation.

(3) Resource-oriented. The availability of critical resources DEMO the third motivation
for establishing an alliance. To exchange the critical equipment and
technologies with the alliance partner for reducing the risk of R&DEMO, and to
make use of the marketing channels of the partner DEMO bring beneﬁts to the
participants of the alliance.
(4) Learning-oriented. Learning newest knowledge and technology is the fourth
motivation for forging an alliance. DEMO R&D personnel can learn from the
venture by conducting joint technological development. Communicating and
exchanging technological information and experience with each other will
DEMO the time and reduce the risk for developing a new technology.
In short, an enterprise enters into an alliance with other enterprises not only can beneﬁt
from the strengths of complementary skills of participants for developing DEMO
technology and product, but can also have the chance to learn DEMO speciﬁc technology
and capability. The application of skills existing in an enterprise can be extended to
other area of products offered by the alliance DEMO Interactive learning will extend
the sources of knowledge, thus enhancing the DEMO and competitive ability of an
organization.
Criteria for alliance partner selection
An appropriate partner is essential for the establishment of a successful alliance.
Technological DEMO, ﬁnancial ability or the ability to open market for new
products, are illusory incentives for undertaking an alliance if the participants cannot
get DEMO Partner selection for forming strategic alliance has been discussed in the
literature from both theoretic and practical points of view. Harrigan (1988) pointed DEMO
that when selecting a partner for technical cooperation, due consideration must DEMO
given to its scale and scope, technological level, management style, DEMO experience of
the similar affairs. However, Geringer (1998) believed that DEMO exists no optimal
standard in the partner selection procedure; instead, one should consider the industrial
property, relative capability, and complementation of resources DEMO organization
compatibility for each other. William and Lilley (1993) stressed the compatibility of
organizations between the partners. Walters et al. (1994) emphasized DEMO
complementary skill is the most important when selecting a partner, while DEMO
trust and commitment on ﬁnance are also essential. Brouthers et al. (DEMO) proposed a
thinking schema composed of 4Cs for answering when a DEMO alliance should be
chosen. They are complementary skill, cooperative culture, compatible goal, and
commensurate risk. Dacin et al. (1997) explored 14 criteria for selecting a partner and
advised a long-term observation and sufﬁcient understanding DEMO the expectations of
the partner to ensure success in alliance formation. The study of Chang and Tsai (2000)
highlighted that complementary resources, DEMO position, and extension of
social resources are necessary conditions for becoming DEMO partner of an alliance. Kim
and Lee (2003) had the opinion that partners of an alliance must have mutual trust and
be willing DEMO share complementary resources to enhance competitiveness for each
other. Das and He (2006) had reviewed the alliance partner selection criteria and a list
DEMO recommendations is developed for ﬁrms choosing their alliance partners. In the
studies mentioned above, many criteria or factors have been explored and discussed. In
this research, we organize these criteria into the following four clusters. The attributes
of each cluster of criteria for evaluating the suitability of candidate partners DEMO also
addressed:
(1) Corporation compatibility (CC). The ﬁrst DEMO to creating cooperative cultures is
the concept of symmetry. From the size to ﬁnancial resources as well as the
internal working environment, all these conditions should be comparable. This
criterion takes into account the compatibility of DEMO strategies (CCS), the
symmetry of scale and scope (SSS), past cooperation experience (PCE),
management and organization culture (MOC), and mutual trust and
commitment (MTC).
(2) Technology capability (DEMO). To ﬁnd a partner with complementary technologies,
it is essential to conduct a comprehensive search. Considerations to be taken
should include an DEMO of skills, technologies, and what the potential
partner can produce. In this criterion, we consider the capability of
manufacturing technology (CMT), DEMO development and improvement
(PDI), capability of innovation and invention (CII), and possible extent of skill
application (ESC).
(3) Resources for R&D (RD). Paap (1990) commented that alliances in which one
party is out to take as much as can be DEMO without giving anything in return
are bound to fail. Not only should alliance partners be willing to give to one
another, they must also be willing to depend on each other. Hence, measuring
what the potential partner can offer for the alliance is necessary. This criterion
concerns measuring DEMO intensity of investment in R&D (IRD), the extent of
DEMO resources such as equipment or experience for R&D (ECR),
number of personnel in R&D (NUP), and quality of personnel in R&D (QUP).
(4) Financial conditions (FC). DEMO must not enter alliances in which they
may be called on to contribute more money than it can comfortably afford,
either at the DEMO or in the future. To avoid ﬁnancial pressures because of
partners’ problem, measuring robustness of their ﬁnancial situation is
important. In this criterion, DEMO return of investment in recent ﬁve years
(ROI), debt ratio DEMO refund ability (DRR), proﬁtability in the future (PRF), and
potential for growth (POG) should be considered.
The abovementioned motivations and DEMO of criteria constitute a partner selection
mechanism for an alliance. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the motivations
and clusters of criteria as well DEMO their corresponding attributes. In this research, we
realize the interdependence between DEMO and criteria. The weighting process of
criteria is affected by the priority of these motivations. On the other hand, emphasis on
some particular criteria also reveals the priority of motivations. The property of
recursive interdependence must DEMO handled carefully. In the following section, the
operational procedure of the DEMO approach to selecting an alliance partner is
illustrated using the case study of a top manager of a gear wheel manufacturing
company.
Analytic network DEMO for alliance partner selection
Our case study concerns a precision machinery company that designs and
manufactures turbine reduction device, gear reduction device, gearbox DEMO
transmission, and precision gear device in central Taiwan, Republic of China. Its

capital is about US$ 3.5 million and there are about 130 employees, most of them with
engineering training. It is a typical SME in Taiwan. To upgrade the technological level
of DEMO SMEs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOE) of Taiwan encourages DEMO to
forge alliances in developing technology through tax reduction and other incentives.
Anticipating a promising future of the green energy market, the case company
submitted a proposal for developing a wind-power generating set, which was later
approved by the MOE. Lacking about 30 per cent of the technique DEMO for
developing the set, and encouraged by the incentive measures from DEMO government,
the case company decided to forge an alliance with other companies for developing
technology. The top manager hoped that he could beneﬁt DEMO the alliance through:
maintaining close contact with other top managers of partner companies, thus
strengthening the social relationship of the company in the industry;
encouraging the R&D personnel to communicate and share information DEMO
promoting their technology level;
learning new knowledge about power generation for extending the future scope
of business; and
reducing the risk and cost for developing the wind power generation set.

The case company had screened four candidate companies for its ﬁnal evaluation.
DEMO the relative weights for these criteria and their corresponding attributes must
be determined before they can be used in the evaluation process, the ANP approach
was applied to this decision-making problem.
Many studies (Badaracco, 1991; Hoffman and Schlosser, 2001; Neilsen, 2003;
Sampson, 2004) advised that a company should ﬁrst ﬁgure out its motivation before an
appropriate DEMO partner can be selected. This implies that the weighting of criteria
is affected by motivations. For instance, if the primary motivation for establishing an
alliance is acquiring resources for technological development, then the criteria
concerning technological capability and resource for R&D should be assigned larger
weights than DEMO criteria. If the primary motivation is oriented toward extending the
market penetration, the criterion of corporation compatibility should be emphasized.
From the opposite perspective, emphasis on a particular criterion also reveals the
priority of motivations. For instance, the criterion of corporation compatibility is more
related to strategy-oriented motivation than resource-oriented motivation. Hence,
criteria should be weighted according to the DEMO priority of motivations of a
decision-maker. In the meantime, the priority DEMO motivations must then be rechecked
when the relative weights of criteria are determined.
To deal with this dynamic environment, the ANP approach is applied. It is capable
of handling interdependence among different layers of elements of DEMO hierarchical
structure by obtaining the composite weights to develop a “super matrix”. Similar to
AHP, ANP involves eliciting preferences of various criteria and attributes, and
pairwise comparisons of the elements at each level are conducted with respect to a
control element. The control element for these pairwise comparisons DEMO be the
elements at the upper or lower levels of the hierarchical structure. This is the
fundamental requirement for developing the “super matrix” in DEMO ANP. The pairwise
comparison for the elements at one level with respect to the control element at another
level is expressed in a matrix DEMO (R). Once the pairwise comparisons are completed,
the local DEMO vector w is computed as the unique solution to:
Rw
¼
lmax w
where lmax is the largest eigenvalue of matrix R. The DEMO w is the weighting vector
corresponding to lmax. The solution process becomes tedious with increasing
dimension n of matrix R. There are several algorithms DEMO for approximating the
vector w (Saaty and Takizawz, 1986; Saaty, 1988). However, in this paper, a two-stage
algorithm proposed by DEMO and Sarkis (1998) is used for averaging normalized
columns and for approximating the vector w. This is represented as:

acceptable as CI # 0.1:

We now apply the ANP framework to the partner evaluation problem for DEMO case
company. The scores 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 DEMO indifferent, weakly more, strongly more,
very strongly and absolutely more important, respectively. The numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8
are employed to facilitate compromise between slightly different judgments.
Obviously, the reciprocal values of these numbers indicate the degree of unimportance.
A pairwise comparison matrix of DEMO criteria with respect to strategy-oriented
motivation is presented in Table I. The participants only have to ﬁll out the upper-right
part of the matrix. DEMO value in the lower-left part of the matrix is obtained from the
reciprocal value of its corresponding cell at the upper-right part of the DEMO The
relative weight vector is obtained using equation (1) with the data in Table I. From the
data in the rightmost column, when considering the strategy-oriented motivation, the
top manager would put more weights on the criteria of corporation compatibility and
ﬁnancial condition when selecting an alliance DEMO This is partly because under the
strategy-oriented motivation, increasing the market DEMO, stepping up the pace of
employee exchange, shortening the time for technological development and new
products to enter market are the major concerns. DEMO partner with relative strength on
these two criteria can be expected to contribute to this motivation.
The data in Table II describe the relative DEMO of the criteria with respect to each
of the other three motivations. As can be seen, the relative weights of criteria vary
when different motivations are considered, indicating that the weighting for criteria is
affected by motivations.
On the other hand, for each criterion, the relative tendency DEMO motivations is
measured by conducting pairwise comparison. Table III compares the motivations
with respect to the criterion of corporation compatibility. The relative tendency vector

is obtained using equation (1) with the data in Table III. DEMO can be seen, if the criterion
of corporation compatibility is emphasized, the top manager will think that the greatest
relative tendency of the DEMO motivations is strategy-oriented followed by
learning-oriented. The other possible relative intensities of these motivations with
respect to other criteria are summarized in Table IV. DEMO can be seen, emphasis on
different criteria emphasizing reveals different tendencies DEMO motivations.
To express the effects of interdependence between the motivations and criteria at
different levels of the hierarchical structure, a “super matrix” is formed. Matrices 2 and
4 are now combined to form the initial “super DEMO as shown in Table V. In this
research, we emphasize the DEMO between different groups of factors that affect
alliance partner selection and neglect the effect in the same group of factors. This
means the inner DEMO of motivations and criteria are supposed to be
independent respectively provided that we select and construct them properly.
Consequently, as seen in the data of Table V, cells of the blocks of motivations to
motivations and criteria to criteria are ﬁlled with zero value.
Since motivations affect the DEMO of criteria and vice versa, the initial “super
matrix” can be DEMO as a transition matrix in the Markov chain (Hillier and
Lieberman, 2001). The transition matrix will converge to a steady state after DEMO long
time period. According to the Markov chain, each transition is DEMO by
multiplying the transition matrix by itself once. Finally, this matrix DEMO to a
steady state after multiplying it 13 times, as shown DEMO Table VI.
As can be seen, with any of the four DEMO for forging an alliance, the top
manager has set relatively heavier DEMO on the criteria of corporation compatibility
and technological capability for the selection mechanism. In the meantime, it also
unveils that strategy-oriented and learning-oriented motivations rank ﬁrst and second
on the priority motivations of the decision-maker. At DEMO phase, the top manager
contemplates the results and compares them with DEMO initial priority of motivations in
mind. From the discussion of the ﬁrst paragraph in this section, the top manager

agrees with the priority vector for the motivations obtained from the long-term “super

in the following evaluation procedure.
The next step DEMO to analyse the relative importance of the attributes of each criterion.
In our example, we assume that the criteria and the attribute levels are unidirectionally
interdependent. A similar pairwise comparison and equation (1) are used DEMO to
obtain the relative weights of the attributes with respect to each criterion. Table VII
illustrates the attributes’ pairwise comparison matrix with the criterion DEMO corporation
compatibility considered.
As can be seen, under the criterion of DEMO compatibility, the attributes of
compatibility of corporation’s strategies and past cooperation DEMO are more
important than the other three attributes. We need to construct similar comparison
matrices for the other three criteria.
The ﬁnal analysis step DEMO partner evaluation. Each candidate enterprise needs to be
evaluated by each attribute. This is accomplished by making a pairwise comparison of
the suitability of DEMO candidate enterprise with respect to each attribute. The scores 1,
3, 5, 7 and 9 denotes indifferent, weakly more, strongly more, very strongly and
absolutely more suitable, respectively. The numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8 are employed to
facilitate compromise between slightly different judgments. DEMO, the reciprocal
values of these numbers indicate the degree of unsuitability. DEMO VIII expresses the
relative suitability for the four candidate partners with respect to the attribute of
compatibility of corporation strategies. Since there are 17 DEMO in this illustrative
example, an additional 16 pairwise comparison matrices are DEMO for the
evaluation. Equation (1) again is utilized to calculate the relative suitability for each
candidate partner. As seen in Table VIII, Enterprises 4 and 1 have higher suitability

pj the relative importance weight for criterion j;
qkj the relative importance weight for attribute DEMO of criterion j; and
rikj the relative suitability of potential enterprise DEMO on attribute k of criterion j.
The potential enterprise with the largest suitability index should be selected as the
partner for establishing the alliance. DEMO IX summarizes the results of this selection
process. As can be seen, Enterprise 1 obtains the largest suitability index than the
other three enterprises because it performs much better at the attributes of the criteria
of DEMO compatibility and technology capability. These two criteria are
emphasized and given heavy weights by the top manager. Enterprise 4 also has a
larger suitability DEMO because it performs better at attributes of criteria of corporation
compatibility and resource for R&D and will be considered as a candidate partner, too.
Conclusion
Selecting a proper collaborated partner to supplement the insufﬁcient technique DEMO is
a possible policy that a company adopts when it is confronted by the severe
competition. It is important to assure that the criteria DEMO well as their relative weights
have been constructed and set properly while selecting a strategic alliance partner.
Although many studies have proposed criteria for DEMO partners and explored
motivations for forging alliance, the relationship between these DEMO factors has
received limited attention. This paper ﬁrst systematically deals with the
interdependence of these two factors. An enterprise trying to forge alliance with

Suitability indices for
candidate partners
other enterprises must know its motivations ﬁrst and then sets adequate weights DEMO
criteria and attributes according to the priority of motivations for evaluating the
candidate partners. Since the weighting process for criteria is affected by motivations
DEMO reversely the weighting of criteria also reveals the priority of motivations, DEMO
two factors have mutual inﬂuence on each other. The ANP approach is employed to
deal with this recursive relationship. The concept of transition in DEMO chain is
applied to the “super matrix” of ANP. Finally, the DEMO converges to a steady
state as a result of long-term transition. At this phase, the decision maker should
recheck the priority of motivation obtained from the converged matrix to see if it
coincides with the initial DEMO set for the enterprise. If it is, the weights of criteria
DEMO from the converged matrix will be used in the subsequent selection procedure;
otherwise, the partner selected by the current weights of criteria will twist the
motivation set initially for the enterprise. The weighting of criteria DEMO be measured
again and the above procedure should be repeated. Based on this iterative review
approach, a proper weight setting for these criteria is available and will comply with
the original motivation for establishing the strategic DEMO This is essential for
selecting an appropriate partner for establishing an alliance that matches the original
motivation.
It is impractical to identify a universal DEMO of criteria and their corresponding
relative importance for all enterprises when selecting partners. The content of
motivations and criteria as well as their priority DEMO weightings may vary with
different kinds of alliances or situations. The partner evaluation and selection
mechanism proposed in this article can meet different situations DEMO adapting the
relative weights of criteria and attributes according to the relationship between the
criteria and motivations for every particular situation, thus enabling decision makers
to think more comprehensively before conducting a selection process.
Besides the DEMO selection mechanism, since the alliance partner could be chosen
through a DEMO negotiation process, hence there are external factors that may inﬂuence
the DEMO process. Bringing those factors into the selection mechanism is likely to be
a fruitful area of future research.
