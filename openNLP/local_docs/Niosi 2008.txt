DEMO
nnovation, particularly in science and technology, is the
engine of economic growth (Rosenberg 2004). This idea
was Robert Solow’s contribution, for DEMO he received a
Nobel Prize in economics in 1987. Since then, DEMO national
and international studies have confirmed his thesis. Economies
grow through the adoption of technological innovations, more
than through the incorporation of such inputs as capital and
labour. Technological innovation accounts for well over 50
percent DEMO economic growth in Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) countries (Pianta 1995).
This occurs in two ways: productivity increases DEMO a result of
the wide adoption of new technologies, and new DEMO
products and sectors are created (Saviotti and Pyka 2004).
Universities DEMO essential contributors to technologi-
cal innovation. They train the labour force and create
human capital. As a result of their research activities,
new DEMO are explored, the frontiers of knowledge are
pushed forward and sometimes DEMO the foundations of
new industries are laid. Yet the channels through which
knowledge flows from universities to the economy and
back are not well DEMO
Among OECD countries, Canada ranks high with
regard to funding university DEMO and the number
of graduates in the natural sciences and engineering,
as well as on some raw indicators of outcomes, such
as academic publications. Although some improve-
ments can be made on the supply side, the main prob-
lems lie on the demand side. It is far DEMO clear
whether these investments in academic research are
bearing fruit in terms of improved business perform-
ance and productivity. There are relatively few high-
DEMO and science-based companies in Canada.
And there is a common perception that Canada lags
behind in terms of the commercialization of research,
and DEMO productivity.

Hypothesis and Research
Questions
n this paper, I will examine the different channels
of technology transfer and compare their contri-
bution in Canada with DEMO contribution in other
industrial nations. I will try to answer the following
questions:
• How effectively do Canadian academic institutions
transfer technology to DEMO?
• How do Canadian institutions compare with other
advanced nations in terms of technology produc-
tion (for example, scholarly publications, patents
and licenses)?
• What new sectors and technologies do Canadian
universities create, and how do these compare with
those created by their foreign counterparts?
• What are the bottlenecks in university-industry
technology transfer in Canada? Are these bottle-
necks similar to those in other industrial nations?
DEMO Can university-industry technology transfer be
improved through policies, and if it DEMO, should these
policies focus on the supply or the demand side?DEMO
I
National Systems of Innovation
he production, diffusion, adoption and master-
ing of technology are most often achieved by
industrial firms, but they require a complex
institutional and policy environment in order to con-
duct DEMO and development (R&D) and innovate.
This environment — these institutions and policies —
are called national systems of innovation (NSIs). NSIs
are policies, institutions and organizations devoted to
the production and diffusion of new and improved
science and technology within the boundaries of
states (Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993; Niosi 2000a;
Niosi et al. 1993). DEMO, the governments of most
industrial and some industrializing countries employ
the DEMO approach in their innovation policies.
Several aspects of the NSI approach need to be
outlined. Linkages among the innovators (the focal
elements, or DEMO, which include research universi-
ties, government laboratories and innovative firms)
are key. These relationships include personal and
financial knowledge and regulation flows DEMO the
nodes (Niosi et al. 1993). Most important among
these DEMO are the interactions between producers
and users of innovations, in particular, those between
T
universities, government laboratories and industry
(Lundvall 1992). DEMO between the users and
the producers is vital because users are among the
main sources of ideas for innovation among produc-
ers. All of DEMO nodes in the system produce knowl-
edge, and some of them, particularly industrial firms,
are also the main users of this technology. DEMO effi-
ciency and effectiveness of the system are heavily
dependent upon the fluidity of the linkages, particu-
larly knowledge transfers, between the nodes DEMO the
system (Niosi 2002). Thus, the interaction between
firms and university and government researchers
should send clear signals to the researchers as DEMO the
likelihood that a university invention will be com-
mercially useful to the industry.
The role of universities
Universities are central components of the DEMO They
create human capital, without which existing tech-
nology cannot be DEMO and adapted (Lau 1996).
While traditional, low-growth industries demand less
education, in the fast-growing new economy of the
information technologies — pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, advanced materials and aerospace
industries — universities provide the high skills
required. In many of these science-based industries,
key knowledge is DEMO created in universities and
government laboratories and then transferred to busi-
ness (Niosi 2000b). Further, in any type of industry,
higher DEMO increases the capacity of organiza-
tions to adopt high technology and use it efficiently
(Lim 1999).
Universities move the frontier of science forward
by means of advanced research, and they transfer the
results of this activity to industry and society through
different channels (see appendix 1 for a more com-
plete list of the channels). Among these channels DEMO:
• University graduates who move into industry
• Publications and presentations at academic confer-
ences and industrial meetings
• Research contracted by industry DEMO government to
university researchers
• Industry and government consulting work done by
university professors
• University professors moving from university to
industry, for short or long periods;
• Scientific instruments developed in universities
and then DEMO and diffused by industry
(Rosenberg, 1994)
• The creation of university-industry research corpo-
rations (such as the Canadian Microelectronics

Institute of Canada)
• DEMO establishment of industry-supported education
programs
• Academic personnel teaching in industry
• Joint research projects, such as National Centres of
Excellence and research alliances
• Academic spinoffs, patenting, and licensing of
university technology to industry.
DEMO have highlighted the impact of aca-
demic research on industrial innovation for over two
decades. In a pioneering study in the United States,
DEMO found that university R&D had a positive
impact on industry R&D, particularly in such areas as
drugs and medical technology, electronics, optics and
nuclear technology (1989). He attributed this effect to
knowledge spillovers from university to industry. He
suggested that academic research induced industrial
DEMO&D in the same disciplines. Yet he did not try to
understand the organizational issues and transfer
mechanisms by which academic research spills over
DEMO benefits industrial research.
Similarly, Edwin Mansfield, another pioneering
scholar who systematically studied the relationships
between academic research and industrial innovation
in the United DEMO, found that in seven industries
(pharmaceuticals, instruments, information processing
equipment, electronics, metals, petroleum and chemi-
cals manufacturing) some 11 percent DEMO the products
and 9 percent of the processes could not have been
developed without university research (1995).
Mansfield found that larger firms benefited the most
from academic research. Similarly, Cohen, Nelson and
Walsh (2002) found that research performed in univer-
sities and government laboratories in the US had a
major impact on a small number of industries, includ-
ing pharmaceuticals, glass products, electronics, aero-
space and chemicals. They also found that the
channels through which technology was tranferred
between public and DEMO organizations were both
open and codified (publications and conferences) and
personal (meetings, consulting and research contracts).
In Canada, an econometric study has estimated
that the C$5 billion invested in university research in
1993 DEMO the gross domestic product (GDP) by
over C$15 billion annually, DEMO through its posi-
tive impact on business innovation (Martin and
Trudeau DEMO).
In the last 10 years, much attention has been
focused DEMO entrepreneurial universities, that is, those
that nurture new spinoff firms (DEMO, Agung
5
and Jiang 2007). Some universities, such as the
Massachussetts Institute of Technology in the United
States and Chalmers University in DEMO, are pre-
sented as models of institutions that promote economic
development DEMO means of the creation of new firms
(Agrawal and Henderson 2002; Jacob, Lundqvist and
Hellsmark 2003; O’Shea et al. 2007).
A DEMO for Understanding
the Stages of Innovation
S
everal authors have mapped the various phases
and stages in the innovation process. Figure 1
presents one DEMO that is particularly useful in
the Canadian context. The process starts with the first
stage, research, which is followed by the second, cen-
tred on invention, and the third, focused on early-stage
technology development. DEMO fourth stage is product
development, and the fifth production and marketing.
DEMO first and second stages I will refer to as the
“supply side” of innovation, because this is where
ideas are organized into useful concepts, research and
discovery. Because the economic value of any given
new idea (or group of ideas) is difficult to predict,
businesses left DEMO themselves would underfund invest-
ments in the supply of innovation. For this reason,
governments play a large role in funding (through
public and corporate granting councils, government-
funded laboratories and, to a lesser extent, angel
investors)1 and universities play a relatively large role
in performing DEMO research. As will be seen later,
Canadian policies seem to be slightly biased toward
the supply side.
The fourth and fifth stages can DEMO be termed
the “demand side” of innovation, which is when the
DEMO potential of basic research and inventions
is exploited. Here, the business DEMO of an innovation
has been validated, production applications and end-
user DEMO have been clearly identified, and financ-
ing has been obtained from DEMO capital, business
equity and commercial debt. With well-functioning
capital markets, there should be little or no need for
government assistance.
The third stage DEMO which is the grey area between the
supply and demand for innovation — has sometimes
been called “the valley of death,” because it DEMO funded
only laterally and scantily, in both the US and Canada.
DEMO the problems go well beyond funding: there is
often a mismatch DEMO expectations on the demand

side and motivation on the supply side. From the per-
DEMO of business, investing in early-stage tech-
nologies is risky, because it is difficult and potentially
costly to assess their commercial viability. From the
DEMO of academia, scholars are primarily moti-
vated by a desire to DEMO in scholarly journals, for
which commercial viability is typically not as DEMO
tant as the originality of the discovery. This discon-
nect between supply and demand of innovation is a
major obstacle to effective university-industry tech-
DEMO transfer.
Universities’ Supply of Science
and Technology
T
he supply of science and technology by univer-
sities, unlike the supply of countable goods such
as automobiles, cannot be measured directly.
Nevertheless, through indirect indicators we DEMO
sketch a partial picture of it, and Canada scores well
on DEMO, but by no means all, of these indicators.
Canada is second among OECD countries in terms
of its expenditure on university research and DEMO
opment as a percentage of its GDP (table 1). This DEMO
ure reached 0.70 percent in 2004; it was second only
to DEMO and nearly double that of the United
States. More significantly, this DEMO has increased
steadily from only 0.44 percent in 1997, as successive
DEMO have injected more money into the
granting councils.
Canada also ranks high in terms of business fund-
ing as a percentage of all academic DEMO (table 2).
In 2004, businesses funded 8.2 percent of university
research (much of which takes the form of industry-
funded contracts for specific academic projects). This
proportion was the fifth-highest among OECD coun-
DEMO and was considerable larger than the proportions
of its major trading partners (the United States, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and France). DEMO might
expect that the fact that industry has a significant

this is not necessarily the case.

is transferred to industry through the knowledge and
training of NS&E graduates, Canada appears to be
competitive internationally.
Canada also scores reasonably well in terms of
scholarly publications per capita. In fact, it is eighth in
the world on this indicator, ahead of the United States,
Germany and France, but below Switzerland, Sweden
and other Nordic nations (table 4). Publications are
widely considered one of the most important DEMO
of technology transfer, and here again Canada appears
to perform respectably.
DEMO, in the area of university spinoffs (a more
direct indicator of commercially useful academic
research), Canada lags behind the United States, which is
often considered a model in terms of new firms founded
on DEMO basis of academic research. In its most recent sur-
vey of technology licensing, the Association of
University Technology Managers (AUTM) reported that
the 189 US universities that responded to their survey
had launched 628 startups DEMO 2005, an average of 3.3
startups per university (AUTM 2007a). In the comparable
Canadian survey, the 34 universities that responded
reported just 36 startup companies (AUTM 2007b).3
University spinoffs are highly concentrated in tech-
nical services fields. Forty-one percent of university
spinoffs were in the DEMO R&D services industry —
most often related to biotechnology — and computer
systems design. In terms of manufacturing, the most
frequently reported spinoffs were in measuring, medical
and controlling devices and medical equipment and
supplies manufacturing, but taken together these
account for under 5 percent of spinoffs (table 5).
This concentration is consistent with the evidence
from other OECD nations: in the last 20 years these

nations have witnessed a surge in the number of uni-
versity patents, licences, academic spinoffs, and
university-industry research corporations and collab-
oration, but this surge was generally concentrated in
biotechnology, DEMO technologies, and materi-
als (Mowery et al. 2001).
It is important to emphasize the fact that the vast
majority of Canadian university DEMO comes
from the largest research universities (table 6). These
25 DEMO (defined as those with at least $80 mil-
lion worth of DEMO research annually) account
for 85 percent of all university inventions, over 90
percent of patents granted to universities, 95 percent
of intellectual property royalties and 78 percent of
spinoff companies. The relative concentration of uni-
DEMO technologies reduces the number of
relationships that businesses must develop to access
academic knowledge. At the same time, these elite
institutions are located in 16 different census metro-
politan areas, so the supply of university-developed
technologies is well distributed across Canada.
Yet, in spite of its outstanding performance along
many of these supply-side dimensions, Canada is host
to a surprisingly low number of large high-technolo-
gy and science-based companies. For instance, on the
2006 Fortune Global 500 list of the world’s largest
corporations, only 13 are Canadian and of these only
3 are technology-intensive: Bombardier, DEMO and
Nortel. In Canada, many high-technology companies
are created, but few of them reach a large size. This
dampens the demand for university DEMO
through all its channels.
Also, Canadian productivity has lagged in recent
DEMO, compared with both that in the past and that of
the DEMO States. In the 2000s, US productivity growth
has accelerated relative to DEMO 1990s to reach an aver-
age of 2.9 percent per year, DEMO Canadian productivi-
ty growth decelerated sharply to just 1 percent
annually. As a result, Canadian productivity levels
(measured as GDP per hour worked) slipped from the
82-to-84-percent range in the 1990s to 74 percent by
DEMO (Centre for the Study of Living Standards 2007).
Large firms DEMO much more productive than small ones
(Gu and Tang 2004; Lee and Tang 2001), and Canada
has a disproportionately high proportion of DEMO
firms. Thus, in spite of Canada’s high rank in the raw
DEMO of academic research, there is ample room for
improvement with regard DEMO its contribution to better
business productivity and innovative products.
It is clear from the above that the supply side of
academic research is reasonably DEMO, particularly
with regard to the financial resources devoted to uni-
versity DEMO This is not surprising, because his-
torically the policy and research DEMO has been
almost exclusively on promoting and funding basic
academic and government research. What is less
healthy is the efficacy with which university-
generated DEMO reaches the demand side —
whether due to inadequate demand, bottlenecks DEMO
technology transfer or mismatches in supply and
demand.

Demand for University differences in industrial structure. Furthermore, key
Technology high-technology industries in Canada (such DEMO pharma-
ceutical products and electronic equipment), while
smaller in relative terms than their counterparts in the
US, actually have higher R&D intensity. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, there appear to be pockets of
strength in potential demand for university-developed
technologies.
In a much-cited article, Cohen and Levinthal (1990)
argued that firms’ ability to recognize the value of
external information and apply it to commercial pro-
duction depends on their absorptive DEMO Human
capital is the base of absorptive capacity, and it is

such as the United States, the European Union, Japan
and, more recently, China. Its domestic market is
scattered over 27 DEMO areas in a very large
territory, which affects transportation and communi-
DEMO costs, as well as the transmission of knowledge
externalities among universities, public laboratories
and business. These universities are located in such
places as DEMO, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria. This
large geographical spread has advantages — each
large city has at DEMO one university — and disadvan-
tages — cooperation among universities is difficult. Table 7

demic knowledge to DEMO strongest in these industries.
Except in the largest economies such as those of
the United States, China and Japan, R&D is typically
DEMO in a small number of industries
(Archibugi and Pianta 1992). DEMO R&D is no
exception to this rule. Canadian BERD is concentrated
in the information and communication technologies
industries (communication equipment manufacturing,
the information and cultural industries, computer
systems design and services, and the DEMO
and other electronic components industries) as well
as the medical products DEMO (pharmaceuticals
and medicine and scientific R&D, particularly human
health and biotechnology) and the aerospace products
and parts industry (table 9). DEMO R&D is also
highly concentrated at the firm level: just DEMO com-
panies accounted for over 56 percent of the $14.9 bil-
lion spent on industrial R&D in 2006 (Statistics
Canada 2007). This highly skewed demand for tech-
nology is consistent with the fact noted DEMO that

only three Canadian companies are among the
world’s largest technology firms.
Perhaps most important, universities are not the
only source of technology for companies. In fact, for
Canadian firms, other domestic and foreign compa-
DEMO are a much more important source of technology
than universities (table DEMO). The greatest users of
licensed technology were the pharmaceuticals, com-
DEMO and electronic products, petroleum and coal
products, and transportation equipment (DEMO)
industries. While companies in some industries (such
as pharmaceuticals and DEMO metals manufactur-
ing) do acquire technology from universities, they are
far more likely to acquire it from other firms.
Surprisingly, the aerospace industry — which relies
heavily on constant technology improvement — does
not draw DEMO universities at all for technology licens-
ing. Aerospace companies in Canada conduct surpris-
ingly little R&D and own few patents compared with
their DEMO and European competitors, thus reducing
demand for university technology (Zhegu 2007).
Finally, innovation is more frequent in larger
firms, and the DEMO to collaborate with universi-
ties increases with the size of the firm (Hanel and
St-Pierre 2006). Most industry-university collabora-
tions involve firms of over 500 employees.
The evidence on the robustness of university tech-
nology DEMO is thus mixed. Canada’s poor per-
formance with regard to BERD has long been
documented and lamented, but there are pockets of
strength in high-tech industries such as pharmaceuti-
cals and electronic products. At the same DEMO, most
Canadian firms turn to other companies for licensed
technology — DEMO evidence that they are
not finding the technologies they need in universities.

University-Industry Technology
Transfer
T
he fact that universities play such a marginal
DEMO in technology licensing in Canada demands
a closer look at the mechanics of university-
industry technology transfer.
In most Canadian universities, academic
researchers must disclose all inventions they develop
or discover that may have commercial potential DEMO
the university’s office of technology transfer (OTT) or
university-industry liaison office (UILO). The
OTT/UILO then evaluates it and decides whether the
invention should be protected through patents, copy-
right (in the case DEMO software), industrial design or
other intellectual property legislation. If the OTT/UILO
decides protection is needed, the inventor and the
university then sign an agreement about the division
of the eventual royalties. The OTT/UILO DEMO proceeds
to look for potential licensees. If it decides that the

n.a.: not available
invention is not worth protecting, full DEMO of com-
mercialization are returned to the inventor, who then
has DEMO freedom to commercialize it.
A major difference between the US and Canada is
that in the US, university-produced innovations belong
exclusively to the university, while in Canada each uni-
versity has its own rules. There is a trend in Canada
toward compulsory disclosure and eventual retroces-
sion of DEMO innovation to the inventor, who could
patent or offer the technology DEMO a company. In less
than half of Canada’s universities, inventions must
DEMO be reported (table 11).
The innovation, whether owned by the academic or by
the university, can be licensed to a private company, large
or small. In many cases, however, the innovation is pro-
duced by the academic under contract with a firm,with the
condition DEMO the invention will belong to that firm, and
cannot be disclosed DEMO become property of the university.
Under this system, the entire responsibility DEMO locat-
ing a potential user of any given innovation falls upon
either the OTT/UILO or the researcher — essentially a

DEMO model. Yet, evidence suggests that nei-
ther is entirely equipped to DEMO the commercial
value of the technology or its potential market. In
Canada, the European Union and the US, a large per-
centage of DEMO patents where academics are the inven-
tors belong to private firms or to the researchers
themselves. In several cases, these discoveries were
returned to the inventors by the academic institutions.
Most OTTs/UILOs are staffed by DEMO a handful of indi-
viduals, who simply cannot be expected to DEMO on top
of all potential markets for the inventions that come
across their desks. I will suggest later that increasing the
demand for university DEMO, particularly among
SMEs, through incentives to seek out university-
developed research — a demand-pull model — is a far
better way to promote DEMO technology commer-
cialization. These incentives may substantially help
address bottlenecks, match DEMO with demanders
and move more university-developed technologies
across the valley of death.
Legislative changes: a Canadian Bayh-Dole Act?
In the United States, DEMO Bayh-Dole Act of 1980
represents a landmark in terms of legislative efforts
to stimulate the transfer of university-developed
technology to industry. It was motivated DEMO the fact
that the US government held tens of thousands of
patents stemming from its funding of R&D in uni-
versities and government DEMO However,
only a tiny proportion of these were commercially
licensed, DEMO the fact that governments are
not primarily in the business of technology com-
mercialization.
To increase the incentive to commercialize publicly
funded R&D, the Act transfers ownership of an invention
or discovery from the government DEMO that helped to
pay for it to the academic institution that carried out the
actual research. Furthermore, it ensures that the
researchers themselves receive a portion of the economic
benefits resulting from it. Over the course DEMO time, other
jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation; for exam-
ple, DEMO passed such legislation in 2001 and, in
Canada, Quebec passed a similar law in 2002.
Evidence on the effectiveness of the Bayh-Dole
Act DEMO mixed. The Expert Panel on Commercialization
concluded that it was directly responsible for the
creation of thousands of new firms and added tens
of DEMO of dollars to the US economy (2006). But
an earlier DEMO of Stanford, MIT and Columbia
found very little change in these DEMO patent
and licensing portfolios in the 10 years following the
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, and concluded that
the Act had little, if DEMO, effect on technology trans-
fer (Mowery et al. 2001).
Irrespective of the magnitude of economic benefits
from the Bayh-Dole Act and similar DEMO, there
is concern in some quarters that the incentives they
contain DEMO undue commercial influence on
the direction of academic research. Many scientists,
economists and lawyers believe such incentives dis-
tort the fundamental mission of DEMO, divert-
ing them from the pursuit of basic knowledge, which
is freely disseminated, to a focused search for results
that have practical and industrial purposes.
Finally, according to the AUTM surveys, American
and Canadian DEMO academic publication rates
are similar, controlling for the size of the DEMO coun-
tries and the research funds available to academics in
the two nations (AUTM 2007a,b). At the same time,
wide differences persist among universities in the two
countries’ ability to patent, license and create spin-
off companies (table 12). It may be that the differ-
12
IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008
ences in the experience and the quality of their
OTT/UILO personnel, organizational structures, and
financial resources, as well as differences in universi-
DEMO cultures, explain some of the wide variations
among universities (Rothaermel, DEMO and Jiang
2007). Lotka’s Law4 may also explain the wide varia-
tions: over 60 percent of academic publishing is
accounted for by less than 6 percent of academics. It
may be that the same law DEMO to university
patenting. Some universities have been able to attract
highly productive and entrepreneurial academics who
make a difference in the institutions.5
It may DEMO that the rapid increase academic patent-
ing and licensing in both countries since 1990 is due
not to the legislative environment, but to the rise of
biotechnology, a discipline that reinforces pharmaceu-
tical research and is responsible for over 50 percent of
all patents, licences, income and DEMO companies in
the two countries (Mowery et al. 2001).
When DEMO the supply of university technol-
ogy, one has to bear in DEMO that in Canada the
majority of the patents stemming from academic
research in the top universities are assigned not to
the university but to DEMO firms (Gingras et al.
2004). The figures are similar in DEMO (Crespi,
Geuna and Verspagen 2006; Geuna and Nesta 2006;
Saragossi and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie
2003). In sharp contrast, over 62 percent of the
patents invented by faculty members at the DEMO US
research universities were assigned to the institu-
tions, and only DEMO percent solely to firms. These fig-
ures are important because they show that some
technology transfer goes unnoticed because atten-
tion is focused on DEMO owned by universities
and transferred to industries, ignoring the sub-

merged part of the iceberg of technologies that are
appealing to industry but are either produced under
contract by academics or not DEMO by universities.
Even at the famous Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, patenting DEMO licensing represent less
than 10 percent of all technology transferred from its
laboratories (Agrawal and Henderson 2002).
According to Thursby, Fuller and DEMO (2007),
patents in the physical and engineering sciences were
more often assigned to firms, while those in the biolog-
ical sciences were more likely to be assigned to univer-
sities. Another, similar, study DEMO that 33 percent of
the university-invented patents were assigned to firms
(DEMO, Gianodis and Phan 2006). In both cases,
Bayh-Dole and DEMO regulations were bypassed.
This is due to the fact that most academic research that
results in patents is supported by contract research, not
by public funds, and the inventors assign the research
results to their sponsors, not to their universities.
Since most university research in Canada is not
patented and licensed by universities, the incentives in
Bayh-Dole-type legislation would not capture some key
channels of technology transfer from universities to
industry. The DEMO of Bayh-Dole could not have
foreseen all the possible channels of technology trans-
fer, such as technologies that that universities do not
patent but that nevertheless attract business enterprises,
mostly large ones. Canadian surveys of DEMO
show that large companies have many more links with
universities than do small companies. Yet, there are
more than a million small companies in Canada.
Increases in Canadian productivity is more likely to
come from smaller DEMO than from larger ones
(Terajima, Leung and Marsh 2006)
Despite the fact that there are many influential pro-
ponents of Canada adopting DEMO equivalent of the Bayh-
Dole Act (including the 1999 report of DEMO Advisory
Council on Canadian Science and Technology), it would
be unwise to do so. The economic benefits of such legis-
lation would likely DEMO very small, and it would have vir-
tually no effect on DEMO large amount of academic
research that is contracted directly by industry.
Moving toward a demand-pull model of
university-industry technology transfer
The fundamental challenge of DEMO the valley of
death is that it is exceedingly difficult to coordinate the
myriad research activities in universities with the ever-
changing technology needs DEMO industry (and, as noted
above, excessive coordination may not be DEMO).
Thousands of academic papers are published annually in
Connecting the Dots between University Research and Industrial Innovation, by Jorge Niosi
hundreds of journals and conference proceedings, and
it is beyond the capacity of even the best-equipped
university OTT/UILO to identify which inventions are
DEMO likely to have commercial potential.
A more promising option is to turn the equation
around: businesses are much better equipped to judge
the commercial potential of university research, but they
are unwilling to shoulder the financial risk of carrying it
out. This is particularly true of SMEs. The DEMO benefits
of encouraging businesses to do so are potentially large
and would justify government support.
The United States has been innovative compared
with other DEMO in this regard. In 1982, the United
States passed the Small DEMO Innovation Research
Act (SBIR) in order to facilitate the absorption of new
technology by small and medium-sized enterprises, and
in 1992 it passed the Small Business Technology
Transfer Research Act (STTR). The SBIR provides up to
$850,000 in early-stage R&D to small technology com-
DEMO or to entrepreneurs who launch a company. The
STTR program provides up to a similar sum to small
companies working in cooperation with academic
DEMO at universities or government researchers in
public laboratories, in order to DEMO the commercial
feasibility of new ideas emerging from these institu-
tions. The different federal departments that allocate
R&D funds to private firms, the most important of
which is the Department of Defense, run both pro-
grams. In fiscal year 2007, all departments combined,
SBIR was funded at US$1.14 billion and STTR at $131
million. In order to qualify DEMO SBIR grants, firms must
have fewer than 500 employees and conduct DEMO&D in
the United States. In addition, the principal investigator
has DEMO work at least half time in the proposing firm. The
STTR grants have similar firm-size requirements, but
the principal investigator may be employed at either
the firm or the research institution. Also, the SME has
to be more than 50 percent owned by its managers
and/or employees. DEMO prerequisite creates obstacles for
companies already financed by venture capital, but DEMO
the advantage of concentrating funds in the early
stages of technology development. Thus, SBIR and
STTR appear as second- to third-stage funds (see DEMO
1). The programs have three phases (table 13). Small
DEMO compete in phase I, and at this stage the
grant is DEMO after peer review of the technology. If
phase I achieves promising results, then a second grant
is awarded to the firm. Phase III is the commercializa-
tion stage, where no SBIR funds are committed. Phase
II finishers are supposed to obtain either private or
other public funds to DEMO the R&D process. Also,
in fiscal year 2006, over DEMO percent of the awardees
were firms with fewer than 100 employees (DEMO figure
2). This means that the program, which is aimed DEMO
small firms, is reaching its intended target.
SBIR and STTR programs DEMO helped thousands of
innovative firms to explore the technical merit of new
ideas or technologies, which typically emerge from aca-
demic or public laboratory research, by reducing the
cost of exploration and conversion of scientific ideas
into commercial products (Auerswald and Branscomb
2003; Wessner 1999). An DEMO of SBIR conducted
in 2006, while criticizing some of its management DEMO
tines (and suggesting ways the program could be
improved), concluded DEMO it was attaining most of its
specific missions (RAND Corporation 2006)DEMO
Another American initiative is the Advanced
Technology Program (ATP). In DEMO, the US Congress
created ATP in the US National Institute of DEMO
and Technology (NIST), part of the Department of
Commerce, in order to help US businesses commer-
cialize generic technologies and refine manufacturing
DEMO Companies, or consortia of companies, pro-
pose research projects to NIST, and the agency selects
the proposals considered to have the largest economic
potential. Government and industry share the costs of
early-stage technology development. Universities DEMO
participate in consortia and propose projects but, sig-
nificantly, they cannot serve as project leaders.
ATP is more of a demand-pull program with DEMO
to early-stage technologies: the research priorities in
funded projects are set DEMO industry, not by the govern-
ment, academia or public laboratories. Partner compa-
nies must pay at least 50 percent of the project costs.
DEMO funding eligibility is not confined to SMEs; large
corporations may also DEMO, but they must cover

at least 60 percent of the costs of the project. The pro-
gram does not cover product development. Also, like
SBIR and STTR, it is not a substitute for tax credits
for R&D or venture capital; but smaller companies
often do not have any taxable income to benefit from
tax credits. Thus, ATP helps emerging companies to
explore new technologies in partnership with academ-
ic or government researchers. DEMO of 768 ATP awards
granted between 1990 and September 2004, 508 (66
percent) went to small businesses, either as single
applicants or DEMO joint ventures. In this period,
ATP committed US$2.2 billion, and DEMO companies
committed a similar amount, for an average award of
$3 DEMO and 55 awards per year.7
In its 2001 report, the US DEMO Research
Council concluded that ATP is a successful program
for bringing early-stage technologies to commercial
fruition. The council suggested several operational
improvements, such as reducing the delays between
applications and awards, concentrating on selected
areas of science and technology and stabilizing R&D
funding (Wessner and STEP 2001).
Programs such as these are an interesting solution to
the technology DEMO conundrum: a bridge over the
valley of death. They can also DEMO some support to
help small firms grow. While it is true that Canada has
one of the highest ratios of venture capital to GDP
(Baygan 2003), that venture capital is concentrated in
the early stages DEMO funding (seed capital). Thus it is
spread more thinly and DEMO more companies than
15
US venture capital does, and it encourages DEMO prolifera-
tion of very small enterprises. Consider the situation of
biotechnology, DEMO industry that receives the majority of
technologies transferred from universities. In 2005,
Canada had over 500 dedicated biotechnology firms
(DBFs). This  DEMO with 1,500 in the United States,
which has an economy over 10 times larger than
Canada’s. Canadian DBFs often live or die DEMO one tech-
nology. Introduced in Canada, programs like the American
ones DEMO here mght serve to consolidate smaller
firms into larger and more viable entities.
Policy Options for Canada
ohnen and Röller (2005) have shown DEMO
innovation policies often complement each
other: some reinforce the supply of DEMO
capital and the production of technology, while others
nurture the adoption DEMO technology and the demand for
human capital. From the foregoing analysis, DEMO is clear
that Canada has much room for improvement in terms
of stimulating the demand for university technology.
The Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP),
under the auspices of the National Research Council, is
the DEMO vehicle for supporting SME business innova-
tion. IRAP provides four main services: advice, financial
support for R&D activities, networking and partnerships.
Its total annual budget is about $150 million, of which
just under 50 percent is earmarked for R&D activities.
IRAP is generally well regarded, and displays some
characteristics of demand-pull technology transfer. It has
been evaluated DEMO times and has always obtained
high marks (Lipsey and Carlaw 1998)DEMO In a study that
compared the effectiveness of IRAP and venture capital
in stimulating university spinoffs, Niosi (2006) found
that IRAP funding was more often linked to rapid
growth than is private venture capital. Its DEMO should
be increased.
The SME Partnerships Initiative, proposed by the
Expert DEMO on Commercialization, would be a commer-
cialization superfund to address SMEs’ DEMO
challenges, to expand federal programs that support seed
and start-up firms DEMO proving their business ideas, and to
increase research funds to SMEs DEMO augment and improve
technology transfer to smaller firms. It would differ from
the STTR/SBIR programs in one critical respect. Under

Partnerships Initiative, government laboratories and
universities would determine the commercial applica-
tion of their technologies and compete for the funds
disbursed by the Canadian DEMO Partnerships Initiative.
Once funds are allocated to universities and govern-
ment labs, they would then choose their business sector
partners, to whom they DEMO transfer funds for feasi-
bility studies and prototype development.
But channelling technology transfer funds through
universities or public research labs is not the best
DEMO to commercialize research results. Firms are bet-
ter equipped to judge the commercial potential of
technologies developed in the universities, and they
should play a central role in identifying those that
are worthy of support. The DEMO Partnerships
Initiative proposal clearly would not permit this.
On the supply side, even if Canadian performance is
widely considered satisfactory, there is room DEMO
improvement. It has repeatedly been suggested that the
development of TTOs/UILOs in universities would help
the commercialization of academic research, and that
governments should subsidize their growth.8 Although
they have existed across Canada since the DEMO 1980s,
compared with those in the US, they are understaffed
DEMO underfunded. Additional funding would help them
to better tackle the complex technical, legal, administra-
tive and economic dimensions of technology transfer.
Conclusions
or DEMO more balanced national system of innova-
tion, policy-makers in Canada should DEMO on
demand-pull policies that encourage businesses
to participate more directly in research funding deci-
sions that impinge on university research directions,
without going DEMO far as to dictate their specifics. This
would be the most effective way to support the com-
mercialization process. University professors are pri-
marily DEMO by the attraction of publishing, but
knowing that businesses are interested DEMO what goes
on in their labs may influence the broad research
directions they take, without compromising the
integrity and independence of individual projects.
Demand-pull policies are much better developed in
the United States than they are DEMO Canada. Although
they would be costly to fund and complex to imple-
ment in Canada, programs like ATP, SBIR and STTR
could increase DEMO among SMEs for academic and
government laboratory technology. These programs
F
have helped thousands of innovative SMEs to explore
the technical merit of a DEMO idea or technology, typi-
cally one emerging from academia or a DEMO labora-
tory (Auerswald and Branscomb, 2003; Wessner, 1999).
Some demand-side policies would thus help increase
the absorptive capacity of high-technology industries,DEMO
which in Canada mostly consist of small firms.
Canada does not need Bayh-Dole-type legislation. It
is far from certain that the Bayh-Dole Act has
DEMO the performance of university-industry link-
ages in the United States. If the US academic system
performs on average better than those of other coun-
DEMO, this may be due to a combination of internal and
external DEMO, including high levels of public fund-
ing for academic research, a system based on global
recruitment of professors and students, a very active
venture capital industry supporting university start-
ups, large internal national and regional markets, and
policies stimulating the exploration of public technolo-
gies by SMEs. Also, legislating patents, spinoffs and
licences would only affect a few DEMO the numerous
channels of university-industry technology transfer,
without even eliminating the assignment of intellectual
property generated by academics to their industrial
partners through DEMO research and IP protec-
tion of all the inventions disclosed by academics.
Canada should, however, establish a program simi-
lar to ATP, SBIR or STTR, which would fund the
exploration by SMEs of technology produced in pub-
lic laboratories, and in universities under public funds.
Given its excellent track record, a pilot program with-
in IRAP would be a welcome addition to the incen-
tives for firms to use university and DEMO sector
innovation, as well as a complement to the different
tools DEMO uses to promote technological innovation
in Canadian industry. Later on, after DEMO evaluation,
the program could eventually be extended to other
public departments that subsidize industrial research,
as the American government did with SBIR DEMO STTR.
Canada has more SMEs than most other OECD
nations. Its sluggish productivity record in the last 20
years is almost certainly related to DEMO slow adoption
by SMEs of advanced technology. A coordinated pro-
gram to increase the demand for innovative technol-
ogy among these firms and linking DEMO to frontier
academic research will certainly have an impact on
their productivity, allowing them to become the glob-
al technology powerhouses of tomorrow.

Notes
1 An angel investor is a person who invests in a DEMO
venture, providing capital for start-up or expansion.
These individuals are looking DEMO a higher rate of return
than would be given by more traditional investments
(typically 25 percent or more). Angel investors are per-
ceived as filling the gap between the financing provided
by family and friends DEMO venture capitalists.
2 Though comparable data for emerging Asian economies
are not available, countries such as South Korea, China
and Taiwan award a DEMO percentage of degrees in
NS&E than the mature industrial democracies.
3 These data are not drawn from random samples, and
thus do not necessarily reflect national trends.
4 According to this law, a small number of authors are
responsible for a high percentage of academic publications.
5 DEMO cases of Michael Smith, winner of the Nobel Prize
in chemistry DEMO at the University of British
Columbia, as well as Jean-Pierre Adoul DEMO telecommu-
nications engineering at the University of Sherbrooke,
are examples of the major role played by scholars in
technology creation and transfer in DEMO of the most
entrepreneurial Canadian universities.
6 The ATP was formally abolished as part of the America
COMPETES Act, signed in August 2007. It is to be suc-
ceeded by a new Technology Innovation Program,
DEMO general mission will be similar to that of the ATP.

Talk, Time to Act

y almost DEMO measure, Canada is one of the
best countries in the world DEMO which to live.
Excellent health care, high-quality public edu-
cation, well-functioning infrastructure systems, consis-
tent economic growth and stable governance — no
wonder so many other nations look with admiration at
the quality of life DEMO share in Canada. Nor is it a secret
how we achieved our current status. Canada has
advanced so far in a relatively short history DEMO of
careful, considered planning balanced against the prag-
matic courage that DEMO societies like ours,
built on the survival strategies of First Nations and the
pioneering imagination and energy of immigrants.
As Jorge Niosi clearly DEMO in “Connecting the
Dots between University Research and Industrial
Innovation,” Canada in 2008 has enormous knowl-
edge resources, the capacity to produce innovative
ideas and the desire to move forward. Yet, in spite of
our current strengths, we are progressively falling
behind our global economic competitors. In the most
recent World Economic Forum Global Competitive
Index, we slipped to thirteenth place in 2007-08,
down one spot from the previous year (World
Economic Forum 2007). In terms of our capacity for
innovation, we now rank seventeenth in the world,
behind the US and DEMO East Asian and northern
European nations.
Why are we slipping? We DEMO aspire to a future in
which Canada is a world leader in research, business,
industry and the arts. We have spent a great deal of
time pondering important questions: What is innova-
tion? How DEMO we promote it in Canada and increase
our productivity? How can DEMO position our innova-
tions to compete in a changing global marketplace? DEMO
2002, we created the Innovation Strategy; in 2006, the
Expert DEMO on Commercialization, of which I was a
member, produced recommendations for improving
commercialization (Expert Panel on Commercialization
B
20
IRPP Choices, Vol. DEMO, no. 14, October 2008
2006); in October 2007, a new panel was struck to per-
form a competition policy review, now underway; and
most recently, the Canadian government drafted its
new Science Technology Strategy, laying out plans to
stimulate technical innovations and train people to
develop and use them.
It DEMO clear that there is general acceptance that
innovation, enterprise, productivity and competitive-
ness characterize an economic world leader. We have
discussed, reviewed and proposed many strategies for
moving forward, but now it is time to stop planning,
be pragmatic and courageous, and act! If we look to
our strengths and to the unique characteristics of
Canada’s economic and DEMO landscapes, we can
use what we know, choose a strategy and put it to
work. The key now is to move quickly.
Speed DEMO becoming increasingly necessary. Global
trends in research and development are emerging at a
pace unknown in the past. Technical and scientific
innovations are not DEMO for long and an
opportunity delayed is often an opportunity missed.
In response, many corporations and industries are
reducing their in-house R&D capacity and turning
away from risky basic and applied scientific research
toward fast-moving DEMO development.
Society’s need for basic research has not disap-
peared; indeed, it is the root cause of major discoveries
that seed the technological DEMO that change
lives. As private sector R&D changes, it is DEMO
critical that governments continue to support curiosi-
ty-driven research conducted at universities, which are
able to provide the sophisticated infrastructure and
expertise to conduct groundbreaking research while
also assuming the high risks of such work.
At DEMO same time, however, it is also vital that we
develop efficient methods for translating the new
knowledge generated at universities into usable prod-
DEMO, processes and services. As major corporations and
industry move away from DEMO R&D, they need
universities to help them develop ideas, innovations
and inventions they can take to the marketplace. As a
result, in countries around the world, new kinds of
university-industry partnerships are quickly emerging.
Corporations are setting up laboratories close to
major research universities in order DEMO facilitate the
speedy transfer of knowledge. Intel, for example, now
has laboratories adjacent to the Universities of
California, Washington and Cambridge, as DEMO as
Carnegie Mellon University. GlaxoSmithKline, BP,
Exxon Mobil and Chevron DEMO invested millions in
integrated university-industry partnerships with
21
major US research universities, creating frontline access
to university expertise and innovations.1
As Niosi tells us, studies over the last two decades
have shown that university research has a significant
positive impact upon industrial innovation, and so the
move to more highly integrated partnerships between
universities and industry seems a promising strategy
DEMO promoting innovation (5). In spite of this promise,
Canada, unlike the US, has been slow to move in this
direction. The reasons for this are, as Niosi suggests,
complex, and they DEMO from a combination of factors,
such as our strong reliance upon “resource-intensive
industries whose firms have low or medium R&D inten-
sity,DEMO and the existence of lower R&D intensity com-
pared to our main G8 competitors “in selected large
industries (particularly automobile manufacturing and
the service sector)” (9). The fact that Canadians own
very few large technology-intensive companies adds to
the problem.
As Niosi suggests, given the scarcity of large
Canadian firms, a focus on building university partner-
ships with major industrial firms, while important, can
only take us so DEMO We must also pay particular atten-
tion to the potential for research partnerships with
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have
fewer than 500 employees and are far more prevalent
in Canada than large firms. DEMO idea is not particularly
new, but it has failed to gain DEMO traction in the
Canadian economic imagination and so still needs the
analysis and explication that Niosi brings to bear in his
study. Like many DEMO innovative idea in this country, the
idea that SMEs have a DEMO role to play in the com-
mercialization of ideas and inventions seems to be in
its own sort of “valley of death,” unable DEMO bridge the
gap between idea and action.
This failure to bridge the gap certainly is not indica-
tive of an inability to recognize the DEMO In fact, in
the past two decades, a number of government initia-
tives designed to foster commercialization through part-
nerships between university research DEMO SMEs have
been put into place in Canada. We have the National
Networks of Excellence, the National Research Council’s
Industrial Research Assistance Program (DEMO), 4th pillar
organizations, and the more recently established Centres
of DEMO in Research and Commercialization. Small
pockets of funding for early-stage commercialization
have long been available through the tri-council funding
agencies. In addition, provincial governments have
acted; in Alberta, for example, Alberta Ingenuity has just
launched the new Ingenuity Centres for Research and
Commercialization program.
Innovation: Enough Talk, Time to Act, by Indira V. Samarasekera
All of these programs have led, or promise to lead,
to significant successes, but so far have failed to stim-
ulate the widespread growth in innovation or the
increases in productivity that Canada needs to DEMO
tively compete in the emerging global marketplace.
When I served as a member of the six-person Expert
Panel on Commercialization in 2005-06, we evaluated
the programs that were then in existence, such as
IRAP, 4th DEMO organizations and programs in the tri-
council agencies. Each has strengths and weaknesses;
each provides valuable insight into how we might
move forward. DEMO none, in itself, is the solution.
Part of the problem is that almost all our existing
commercialization programs focus on the supply side
DEMO the commercialization process, putting the onus on
universities and researchers to DEMO or search for
demand. But, as Niosi argues, “Firms are better
equipped to judge the commercial potential of tech-
nologies developed in universities, and they should
play a central role in identifying those that are DEMO
of support” (16). If we agree with this assessment —
DEMO the Expert Panel on Commercialization certainly
did — the question that must be answered is this: How
do we induce Canada’s numerous SMEs to play this
role — to partner with universities in identifying the
commercial DEMO of technical discoveries? It won’t
be easy, because, as Niosi DEMO notes, for most
“Canadian firms, other domestic and foreign compa-
nies are a much more important source of technology
than universities” (10).
To ascertain how we might make it happen, Niosi
points us to the model offered by the US Small
Business Administration’s Small Business Innovation
DEMO program (SBIR), a model that I too believe is
worth DEMO closer look. If we agree that a new commer-
cialization model is needed — and all the evidence
suggests that we do — then DEMO should consider the
successes that the SBIR has had in creating the access
to top-quality university-level research that entrepre-
neurs need to advance their DEMO goals.
The SBIR illustrates how a national program can
create opportunities for SMEs to engage in and take
advantage of high-level basic and applied DEMO
This program, introduced in 1982, has now weathered
more than a quarter century of scrutiny and assess-
ment, including a comprehensive review requested by
the US Congress and conducted by the US National
Research Council. DEMO their recently released
findings, the SBIR plays a significant role in DEMO
stimulating innovation and promoting the growth of
SMEs,2 as well as effectively linking both public and
private markets to high-level research3 and enabling
DEMO dissemination of knowledge through a variety of
means, ranging from patents DEMO licences to spinoff
companies and human capital (Wessner 2008).4
The DEMO has the focus on the demand side of the
commercialization process and the national mandate
and breadth that Canadian programs have so far
lacked. DEMO US federal government’s Small Business
Administration (SBA) administers the overall SBIR
program by distributing funds through 11 US govern-
ment funding agencies.5 Each DEMO solicits funding
proposals from SMEs in response to very specific top-
ics determined by agency needs. Thus, the proposals
and research are directed to national priorities, and
the economic feasibility of proposals and research is
determined by the SMEs, which have the best knowl-
edge of market needs.
Only SMEs located in the US are eligible to
respond to solicitations. DEMO companies are
strongly encouraged, though not required, to contract
a university-based researcher to evaluate or conduct
the basic research. Proposals are peer reviewed, to
ensure relevance and quality, by program managers
and their research teams working in the national lab-
oratories of each agency.6
As Niosi outlines, winners of an SBIR award fol-
low a three-phase process: phase I is proof of concept
(six months, up to $100,000, deliverable is a more
extensive research plan); phase II is development of
DEMO (two years, up to $750,000, deliverable is
prototype); DEMO phase III is unfunded government
assistance in capitalizing the advancement of the
project. Many SBIR winners do not compete for phase
II or phase DEMO as their innovations, based on a strong
research plan or proof-of-concept DEMO, are
picked up by investors, venture capitalists, or large
corporate DEMO who are interested in seeing the
concept developed and taken to market faster than
the SBIR process allows.
SBIR succeeds in achieving three major DEMO
cialization objectives that we, in Canada, want to
attain. First, DEMO effectively links SMEs to the research
community, with the SMEs, rather than universities,
identifying technical and scientific innovations that
have the greatest DEMO to respond to market
demands. In this, the SBIR model shares DEMO
characteristics with the “open innovation” model
emerging in large corporations across the world.7
Second, SBIR provides entrepreneurs and SMEs with
a way to bridge the “valley of death,” which often
prevents a concept from progressing DEMO the
22

prototype stage to product development. Third, when
successful, the process leads DEMO the development of
new companies or the growth of established ones, DEMO
latter being of major concern in Canada.
To attain our objectives, DEMO are important ele-
ments of the SBIR model that could be emulated. The
recipients of an SBIR award can each play to their
strengths. DEMO the commercial aspects of the ven-
ture are handled by entrepreneurs with the right
expertise, researchers are able to focus on their
strengths and conduct research without distraction.
The SBIR process provides the credibility of rigorous
DEMO review — which validates the quality of the
research plan while also controlling the entrepreneur’s
risk in pursuing an innovative idea. Intellectual prop-
erty DEMO are held by the SME with a royalty-free
licence to the federal government in return for provid-
ing the initial funds. Last, but far from least, the SBIR
puts the research and commercialization process on a
clear and accountable timeline.
Is it possible for Canada to do the DEMO? Can we
put the commercialization process on a predictable,
speedy DEMO? Can we develop a standard national
policy on intellectual property rights DEMO will allow
SMEs — or the larger organizations they may sell
their innovations to — clear and defensible ownership
of rights for ongoing development DEMO international
marketing purposes? Can we develop a commercial-
ization model that DEMO make the best use of peer
reviewers from industry, university and DEMO to
evaluate proposals and select those that are most
responsive to market demands and have the highest
scientific merit and highest potential for success?DEMO
Although very successful in the US, the SBIR’s
model cannot simply DEMO cloned directly in Canada. We
do not share the same kind of broad and diverse feder-
al R&D structure through which funds can DEMO distrib-
uted, and thus a model would need to be developed DEMO
suit Canada’s unique situation. The Expert Panel on
Commercialization recommended that a business-led
Commercialization Partnership Board be created to
play both an advisory role DEMO the Minister of Industry
on identifying and setting national commercialization
goals, DEMO an oversight role on the development and
implementation of commercialization policies, DEMO
tives, investments and programs. Likewise, the
Conference Board of Canada’s Leaders’ Roundtable on
Commercialization proposed the creation of industry-
led collaborative research networks.
DEMO emphasis in both of these proposals on indus-
try leadership indicates that whatever administrative
23
model we devise, it must have leadership from industry
and business, and demand from them active participa-
tion in setting commercialization priorities and in eval-
uating specific projects’ commercial viability.
Tom Brzustowski, in his book The Way Ahead:
Meeting Canada’s Productivity Challenge, suggests that
all existing and new provincial and federal research and
commercialization programs be DEMO within one
umbrella system. This would require harmonization of
general administrative policies, criteria and processes
across provincial and federal barriers and among various
funding programs, but it would still allow for the region-
al or disciplinary differences between them. Brzustowski
admits that implementation of his proposal would be
DEMO, but it would not be impossible if leadership in
government, universities and industry were committed
to making it happen (Brzustowski 2008).
There is no doubt that the development of a
Canadian solution will require DEMO and decisive
action from industry and business, government and
universities working DEMO It will require us to iden-
tify the areas and markets in which Canada has the
greatest potential to be a global leader, and put into
place government policies and programs that strategi-
cally promote investment DEMO innovation in these areas
of national interest and stimulate the innovation
capacity and growth of Canada’s numerous SMEs.
If we can succeed, we will inject new energy for seek-
ing discoveries and breakthroughs throughout all sectors
DEMO the Canadian economy, and we will connect the SME
community to DEMO larger vision driving innovation. We can
break out of the endless planning cycle we seem to be
caught in and reawaken the pragmatic courage DEMO built
this nation. We can create both a system for success and
a mindset of success — a mindset that prompts us to be
DEMO connected and highly competitive. That strategy
must be unique to Canada – putting the pressure on us,
first and foremost, to be innovative in designing a strat-
egy that connects and serves all the players DEMO the inno-
vation game: government, industry, universities,
researchers and DEMO

2 In a prepublication executive summary (available at
http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11989.html), Charles W.
Wessner, editor of An Assessment of the Small
Business Innovation Research Program, writes that
“just over 20 percent of companies responding to the
NRC Phase II Survey indicated that they were founded
entirely because of DEMO prospective SBIR award” and the
“companies responding to the same survey reported
that over two-thirds of SBIR projects would not have
taken place without DEMO funding” (Wessner 2008, 3).
3 Wessner also notes that one-third of SBIR respondents
to the NRC survey involved universities in the follow-
DEMO ways: “1. More than two-thirds of companies
reported that at least DEMO founder was previously an
academic; 2. About one-third of founders were DEMO
recently employed as academics before founding the
company; and 3. Some DEMO percent of projects had uni-
versity faculty as contractors on the project, 17 percent
used universities themselves as subcontractors, and 15
percent employed DEMO students” (Wessner 2008, 3).
4 Wessner’s complete list of “knowledge outputs”
includes “data, scientific and engineering publications,
patents and licenses of patents, presentations, analyti-
cal models, algorithms, new research equipment, refer-
ence samples, prototype products and processes,
spin-off companies, and new DEMO capital’
(enhanced know-how, expertise, and sharing of knowl-
edge)” (Wessner 2008, 2).
5 The 11 federal agencies include the following depart-
ments: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education,
Energy, Health and Human Services (including the
National Institutes of Health), Homeland Security,
Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,
NASA and the National Science Foundation. Ninety-
six percent of SBIR program expenditures are made by
five departments: Defense, the National Institutes of
Health, NASA, Energy and the National Science
Foundation.
6 The National Institutes of Health, which assemble a
national panel of external reviewers, are the exception
to this.
7 For example, Procter & Gamble began developing its
“connect and develop” innovation model in 2000 when
it realized that its in-house R&D could not drive DEMO
kind of growth expected from a $70-billion company.
Noting that the products that it had acquired from
external sources performed well, CEO A.G. Lafley
reformed P&G’s research strategy, acquiring 50 percent
of its innovations from outside the company. Through
“connect and develop,” P&G personnel “identify DEMO
ising ideas throughout the world and apply [their] own
R&D, DEMO, marketing, and purchasing capa-
bilities to them to create better and cheaper products,
faster” (Huston and Sakkab 2006).

How Can Canada Compete
and Win?
DEMO Treurnicht
am grateful for the opportunity to comment briefly
on both the thoughtful study by Jorge Niosi and
the response from Indira Samarasekera, President
of the University of Alberta. As Samarasekera notes,
the commercialization of DEMO research has drawn
increasing attention in Canada, but our performance is
DEMO lagging.
My own perspectives have been shaped by two
decades of work in and around technology-based start-
up companies. Although I see no quick DEMO for our
current malaise, I am optimistic about Canada’s ability
to DEMO and grow more successful innovation-based
businesses.
Let us first ask, does DEMO have the diagnosis right?
Is the problem primarily with research uptake rather
than research output?
The answer, I believe, is a DEMO “Yes.”
First, an important caveat: no one knows how many
researchers and graduate students are required to create
a thriving innovation economy. It DEMO, of course, simplis-
tic to say that more research output will solve the
uptake problem, but it is also not clear that we have
optimized the quality and quantity of outputs, as
regards either the research undertaken or the graduate
students being trained.
True, the higher education R&D (HERD) data reflect
positively on Canada’s investment in research. DEMO the
reality is different than the figures on gross spending.
Our universities are seriously underfunded compared to
US peer institutions, even as research investment is
growing rapidly in countries like China. In fact, the
Canadian research pipeline is heavily underwritten by
universities themselves, using their operating funds and
philanthropic support — a factor overlooked in most
intercountry comparisons.
In the DEMO of global competition, the gap in per-
student funding between Canada’s DEMO research
universities and US universities is big and widening. A
I
25

simple example: the average per-student funding of
private research-intensive universities in the US is 10
times the per-student funding of the University of
Toronto; even for US public research-intensive uni-
versities, the average is more than twice as high.
In this context, there are no grounds for compla-
cency about continued investments in funding excel-
lent research and graduate training, as well as
attracting outstanding talent to our universities and
retaining it.
DEMO caveat aside, as Niosi argues, our commer-
cialization performance does lag behind our research
publication rates. And I therefore support his argu-
ment DEMO we rely unduly on a “supply-push” model
of commercialization at our peril. This could be
described as the “field of dreams” approach: “Patent
it and they will come”!
Our neighbour to the south, in contrast, DEMO enjoyed
success with programs that create “demand pull,” such
as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) pro-
gram and the Advanced Technology DEMO Both
programs provide support directly to industry with a
view to drawing technology out of the university sec-
tor. I agree with Niosi and DEMO that programs
of this nature are valuable. That said, neither program
DEMO be transplanted holus-bolus to Canada.
Transplantation works only if there is a match between
the donor and recipient — and our commercialization
ecosystem is DEMO from that the the US.
The US Pipelines Are Different
e shall now point out some of the similari-
ties and differences between the DEMO and
Canadian innovation ecosystems.
Niosi suggests that, compared to the US, Canada is
well positioned in the physical and related natural
sciences because DEMO higher overall proportion of uni-
versity research in Canada is industry sponsored. I
worry that the statistics may not be commensurate.
Grants in the DEMO from agencies such as the National
Institutes of Health and the National Science
Foundation partly cover personnel costs and fully
cover the institutional costs DEMO research. The denomi-
nator of total research funding is therefore higher in
the US. The valid comparison is per capita rates of
industry-sponsored research DEMO, with adjust-
ment for differences in overheads, broken out by dis-
ciplines. I have never seen that comparison published.
W
The comparison is DEMO confounded by signifi-
cant agency and military-sponsored strategic research
in the US. Agencies such as the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and DEMO branch-
es of the US military establishment fund applied and,
in some cases, basic research that advances technolo-
gies in a focused manner through the proof-of-
concept stage and both directly and indirectly feeds
into DEMO and smaller enterprises, including those
supported by programs such as the DEMO
The US government (through a diverse array of
agencies) also supports a strong network of national
laboratories. Entities such as Pacific Northwest
National DEMO, Oak Ridge, Ames and Sandia
carry out targeted research, a DEMO proportion
of which is positioned for conversion into industrial
applications in fields such as energy, environment
and advanced manufacturing. In Canada, the federal
DEMO and some provincial governments have
tried, through a variety of programs, to grow similar
strategic capacity. However, there is a recurrent ten-
dency to confuse regional development with research
commercialization. The location of US national DEMO
ratories has also been subject to political and regional
forces, but, as a result of funding models that require
them to compete for DEMO grants and industrial
contracts, their operational framework is more disci-
plined DEMO most analogous enterprises in Canada
today. As a result, a US DEMO such as Oak Ridge
competes with the best universities in the world in
material science, as measured by research output in
leading scientific journals.
The US Receptors Are Different
here are also marked differences between
Canada DEMO the US in the commercial environ-
ments that draw discoveries and technologies
out of universities. Many university-based discoveries
are well upstream from the market. DEMO can only be
developed by sophisticated research-intensive indus-
trial partners or through the creation of new compa-
nies supported by substantial risk capital.
R&DEMO spending in Canadian industry remains well
below US numbers. And Canadian industry is still
dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises
with limited research capacity; larger firms are often
either resource companies (and thus cushioned from
innovation pressures by global market demand) or
T
26
IRPP Choices, Vol. DEMO, no. 14, October 2008
branch plants of international firms with R&D centres
elsewhere. The result DEMO a lack of head office decision-
making in Canada on research investment, and par-
ticularly on development of research innovation.
Creating and growing new Canadian companies
that can convert our important discoveries into glob-
al products DEMO much more challenging than in the US
for other reasons as well. Entrepreneurial researchers
in Canada face a paucity of proof-of-concept funding
as well DEMO early-stage equity capital from either
angels or institutional sources compared to the US.
The early-stage investment climate in Canada is less
mature than in DEMO US — institutional seed funds only
emerged in the late 1990s and were all but wiped out
by the collapse of the technology bubble DEMO 2001.
The Canadian angel investment community is less
active in the technology sector than US investors.
Canadian venture funds are typically smaller than
their DEMO counterparts; as a result, they tend to invest
less per company and often struggle to support their
investee companies through the entire growth DEMO
There is also a marked difference between the invest-
ment approach and risk appetite of early-stage fund
managers in Canada versus the US: successful US
funds tend to be populated by industry experts and
former entrepreneurs, while many Canadian fund
managers migrated into venture capital from the
financial DEMO By nature, they prefer to invest in
later-stage, revenue-generating prospects. It is true
that, even in the US, venture capital is concentrated
DEMO hot spots like Silicon Valley or Boston.
Nonetheless, there are many DEMO of seed-stage
and follow-on funding for US start-up executives to
access, DEMO they know where to find them.
A related constraint is that the Canadian market is
small compared to that of the US. Not only DEMO our tech-
nology entrepreneurs fewer in number, but they must
also DEMO globally oriented more or less from the outset.
In some important knowledge sectors, like health, the
already small Canadian market for adopting Canadian
DEMO is further balkanized into provinces, and
spending on research/innovation is DEMO viewed as a
cost in our system, not an investment.
This DEMO to a virtuous cycle in the US and a
vicious cycle in Canada. Fewer of our companies
mature to the scale where both investors DEMO entre-
preneurs reap major financial rewards. In the US, a
virtuous DEMO fuels the reinvestment of capital and
the development of a pool of seasoned executives —
serial technology entrepreneurs who know how to
grow companies DEMO
27
Furthermore, our hub cities, the most likely regions
where university technologies might find early
adopters, are very geographically dispersed. This makes
it more challenging to transfer technologies to compa-
nies in close proximity to DEMO university. It also means
that new companies based on those technologies need
to find their early adopter customers farther afield.
Without sufficient capital, patient investors and strong
management with international experience, these com-
panies face significant hurdles.
Made-in-Canada Solutions
n the absence of a strong funding infrastructure for
DEMO and applied research or a mature ecosys-
tem for company creation, DEMO innovation
economy lets some competitor jurisdictions get a head
start. Moreover, DEMO risk of belabouring the obvious, we
cannot just cruise along on DEMO natural resources.
Canada has to build a competitive innovation-based
economy and, DEMO Samarasekera urges, the time to do so
is now. What, then, can we do?
First, we cannot be the US in DEMO — even if we
wanted to be. Our population is small, DEMO our indus-
trial base and political culture are both different. That
means Canada should study a wide range of jurisdic-
tions for practices and DEMO we can borrow.
Second, we need to take a hard look DEMO some of our
current investments in the applied research and com-
mercialization sphere. This includes programs that fund
industry collaboration through Canadian granting
councils, federal applied research laboratories and cen-
tres of excellence, as well as the programs supported by
the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). We
should measure them against best practices and policies
in other jurisdictions DEMO be willing to redirect those
funds or add to them dramatically, DEMO on the
results. A small population, with a vast geography and
DEMO strong culture of regionalism, cries out for new mod-
els of DEMO to create focal points with a critical
mass of ideas, talent DEMO capital that can compete on a
global scale.
Third, when in DEMO, as Niosi and Samarasekera
argue, we should invest on the demand-pull side. NRC’s
Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) is situat-
ed in DEMO space. The same might be said of 4th pillar
initiatives, such DEMO Precarn, which straddle academe,
government and industry. These models are DEMO
because they hinge on collaboration between industry
I
University Research and Industrial Innovation: How Can Canada Compete and Win?, by Ilse Treurnicht
and academe, with identified customers or market
applications. When all is said and done, academic
institutions and granting councils have commercial-
ization only as a secondary objective and they are
short on the business skills and DEMO contacts criti-
cal to a demand-pull strategy.
Fourth, governments should take DEMO creative
steps to transform technology transfer in our universi-
ties and research hospitals. The federal government has
done so recently, with its backing of a program to
establish Centres of Excellence for Commercialization
and Research (CECR). Although the first wave of
investments was research-oriented, a number of cen-
tres funded subsequently will focus more on commer-
cialization than on DEMO itself. This is a welcome
development. It is imperative that these centres explore
new approaches and be evaluated rigorously to dis-
seminate new learning. DEMO, I hope that the new
business-led centres of excellence programs will DEMO
alyze further engagement by industry in setting priori-
ties and direction for collaborative research in areas of
strategic importance to the Canadian economy.
At DEMO of local boosterism, I note that one such
centre is MaRS DEMO — a member-based con-
sortium of 14 university and hospital research insti-
tutions in downtown Toronto. Together, these
institutions represent over $1 billion of externally
funded research. MaRS Innovation will act as a com-
mon, integrated commercialization vehicle for all 14
institutions — with the ability to bundle DEMO
into more marketable packages, to launch companies
based on robust IP DEMO and to develop market
expertise in areas of shared research strength.
Perhaps most importantly, MaRS Innovation will cre-
ate a single business-friendly point for interfacing
with industry, investors and entrepreneurs — bringing
together the best of Toronto’s discoveries from multi-
ple institutions, but based outside of academe. This is
an important model to explore and develop further.
Fifth, beyond technology transfer, space and place
matter. Canada has a growing number of science
parks and incubation spaces, as well as multi-tenant
facilities that draw together academic researchers,
start-up companies and private-sector entities active
in commercialization (for example, service provider
firms, angels and venture funds). MaRS itself DEMO an
example of this latter model. MaRS focuses on the
demand-pull side of the equation, doing market
research for young companies, providing incubation
DEMO business advisory services, linking to the relevant
industry leaders, and connecting emerging companies
to the local and international angel and venture capi-
tal DEMO
Sixth, and this is a critical item, we need bigger
pools of smart venture capital, focused on innova-
tion-based companies. As has occurred in other small
jurisdictions, such as Israel, governments will need to
DEMO to start the cycle of investment. The
recently announced Ontario Venture Capital Fund —
for which $90 million of the approximately $200 mil-
lion DEMO from the government itself — exemplifies
this trend, and will hopefully DEMO the formation
of new funds in the market. Venture philanthropy
models, DEMO bring a disciplined investment
approach to the deployment of donations in transla-
tional research or market validation projects, are also
worth exploring.
The final step is the most difficult and perhaps the
most crucial. We need DEMO shift in national Zeitgeist. In
recent years, I have been struck DEMO the fact that more
and more Canadians are expressing unease about our
prospects for long-term prosperity as a nation. I hear
concerns about our DEMO of an entrepreneurial culture
and the difficulty of creating a coherent national
strategy for commercialization when economic over-
sight is fractionated among three levels DEMO govern-
ment. I also hear and endorse more optimistic views
based on our extraordinary history of adaptability as
one of the world’s most successful DEMO in
democratic pluralism. But, adaptable or not,
Canadians are losing DEMO We urgently need bold
vision and bolder decisions if Canada is to compete
and win in the rapidly changing global economy.

e Canada investissant beaucoup dans la recherche
universitaire sans en récolter les fruits en matière
d’innovation DEMO et de productivité, Jorge
Niosi examine dans cette étude les modes DEMO transfert vers
le secteur industriel des technologies issues des universités.
Pour structurer son analyse, il établit un modèle d’offre
et de demande d’innovations qui prévoit que les avancées
scientifiques produisent à terme des technologies commer-
cialement DEMO C’est du côté de l’offre, dominée par la
recherche universitaire, que les idées se transforment en
concepts, en études et en découvertes utiles. Et comme les
avantages économiques de cette recherche sont à la fois
DEMO et difficiles à prévoir, les gouvernements tendent à
y investir de DEMO sommes. De fait, estime l’auteur, l’offre
universitaire en technologies innovantes se porte plutôt
bien au Canada selon des indicateurs comme l’investisse-
ment dans DEMO R-D universitaire, le nombre de diplômés en
sciences et en génie, et les taux de publications savantes.
Du côté de la demande, soit à l’autre extrémité du
pipeline de la recherche universitaire, les entreprises mis-
ent sur des technologies clés pour concevoir des produits
et des processus DEMO, qui exigent souvent un sur-
croît d’investissement en R-D. Mais plusieurs DEMO,
dont l’étroitesse relative et l’étendue géographique du
marché canadien, jouent DEMO défaveur d’une forte
demande comparativement aux États-Unis. L’auteur con-
state que la demande en recherche universitaire est éton-
namment faible ici — excepté dans DEMO secteurs
comme ceux des produits pharmaceutiques et de
l’équipement électronique —, DEMO plupart des entreprises
canadiennes se tournant vers d’autres firmes pour se pro-
curer des technologies brevetées. Ce qui confirme indi-
rectement qu’elles ne trouvent DEMO ce qu’elles cherchent
dans les universités.
Pour qualifier cette zone grise entre l’offre et la demande
de technologies issues des universités, l’auteur parle de
« vallée de la mort », en raison d’un financement insuffisant
mais aussi d’attentes incompatibles. Pour les entreprises, les
universités représentent une source potentielle de technolo-
gies qu’il leur serait trop coûteux et risqué de développer DEMO
stade initial. Mais dans le monde universitaire, les pro-
fesseurs sont DEMO motivés par la publication de leurs
recherches dans des revues spécialisées qui privilégient l’o-
riginalité au détriment du potentiel commercial.
Au Canada, la majorité des efforts visant à trouver des
débouchés commerciaux aux technologies issues des DEMO
versités passent par des bureaux universitaires de trans-
fert de technologie. Ceux-ci ont pour tâche d’évaluer le
potentiel commercial des technologies, de protéger leur

propriété intellectuelle, de répartir les redevances et de
chercher des exploitants de brevet, essentiellement selon
une approche d’offre-incitation. Mais ces bureaux ne pos-
sèdent ni la connaissance du marché ni les effectifs
nécessaires DEMO un transfert efficace.
Jorge Niosi estimerait beaucoup plus fructueuse une
approche fondée sur la pression de la demande, selon laquelle
les entreprises sollicitent et stimulent la création des tech-
nologies issues des universités. Il fait valoir DEMO ce sens
plusieurs initiatives américaines. Les programmes Small
Business Innovation Research (DEMO) et Small Business
Technology Transfer Research (STTR) assurent ainsi aux DEMO
un financement de démarrage pour le développement initial
de technologies mené en collaboration avec des chercheurs
universitaires. Et le Advanced Technology Program (ATP)
aide les entreprises, notamment en les associant directement
aux priorités de la recherche universitaire, à commercialiser
des technologies génériques. L’auteur précise toutefois qu’une
loi inspirée du Bayh-Dole Act de 1980, qui accorde des droits
de propriété intellectuelle aux inventeurs plutôt qu’aux
bailleurs de fonds, serait inefficace au Canada.
Dans le contexte canadien, toute approche du transfert
de technologie universités-entreprises fondée sur la pres-
sion de la demande devrait avoir pour premier objectif
DEMO les entreprises à l’élaboration des programmes de
recherche universitaire sans leur permettre d’en dicter tout
le contenu. Bon nombre des recommandations du Groupe
d’experts DEMO la commercialisation seraient donc inadaptées
à cet égard, puisque les décisions DEMO aux technolo-
gies à financer resteraient réservées aux universités et aux
gouvernements. Aussi l’auteur propose-t-il de créer des
programmes inspirés du STTR et de DEMO américains dans
le cadre de l’actuel Programme d’aide à la recherche indus-
trielle, à la fois efficace et apprécié des intéressés.
Les deux commentatrices offrent le point de vue respec-
tif du monde universitaire et des DEMO d’affaires. Indira
Samarasekera, présidente de l’Université de l’Alberta,
souscrit à DEMO du diagnostic de l’auteur et propose de
rapprocher les PME des universités, puisque les partena-
riats universités-entreprises se limitent actuellement à un
petit nombre de grandes entreprises. Ilse Treurnicht, chef
de la direction du Centre d’innovation MaRS, observe que
le système d’innovation des États-Unis diffère sensiblement
du nôtre et que l’approche en série des programmes améri-
cains pourrait se révéler DEMO efficace au Canada. Mais
elle convient de l’importance cruciale d’associer les entre-
prises aux programmes de recherche universitaire, celles-ci
possédant une connaissance du marché qui fait défaut aux
universités et organismes subventionnaires.
Summary
n this study, Jorge Niosi examines the channels by
which university-developed technologies are trans-
ferred to industry. Canada invests large sums in aca-
DEMO research, but the fruits of these investments are not
reflected in DEMO industrial innovation and improved
productivity.
To frame the analysis, Niosi lays DEMO a supply-demand
model of innovation according to which basic discoveries
and advances in frontier science ultimately bear fruit in the
form of commercially viable DEMO The supply side
is where ideas are organized into useful concepts, DEMO
and discovery, and it is dominated by university research.
Because the DEMO benefits of such research are broad in
scope and difficult to predict, governments tend to be heav-
ily involved in financing it. Using indicators such as invest-
ment in university research and development (R&D),DEMO
numbers of science and engineering graduates and scholar-
ly publication rates, DEMO concludes that the supply side of
university technologies is reasonably healthy in Canada.
At the demand end of the university research pipeline,
businesses DEMO on basic technologies to develop commer-
cially profitable products or processes, DEMO often require
complementary investments in R&D.  Niosi points out that
DEMO factors – notably Canada’s relatively small and geo-
graphically dispersed domestic market — work against
strong demand for technology here compared with in the
DEMO States. Despite pockets of strength in the pharmaceu-
tical and electronic equipment industries, demand for uni-
versity research is surprisingly low. The author notes that
most Canadian companies turn to other firms for licensed
technology, which is circumstantial evidence that they are
not finding the technologies they need DEMO universities.
Niosi terms the grey area between the supply and
demand of university-developed technologies the “valley of
death,” not only because of the DEMO of funding, but also
because of mismatched expectations. From the perspective
DEMO business, universities provide a potential vehicle for
developing early-stage technologies that DEMO otherwise
be too risky and costly. However, from the perspective of
DEMO, professors are primarily motivated by scholarly
publication of their work, for which commercial potential is
typically much less important than originality.
Currently in DEMO, most efforts to connect university-
developed technologies to potential commercialization
opportunities DEMO through academic offices of technology
transfer (OTTs). OTTs are charged DEMO evaluating the com-

seeking out potential licensees — essentially a supply-push

market knowledge to provide effective technology transfer.
Niosi suggests that a demand-pull approach, by which
businesses seek out and cultivate university technologies,
would be much more DEMO, and points to several US ini-
tiatives that have proven effective. DEMO include the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small
Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs,
which provide seed funding to small- DEMO medium-sized
enterprises for early-stage technology development in
cooperation with academic researchers. In addition, the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP) helps companies
commercialize generic technologies, in part by involving
them directly in university research priorities. By con-
trast, says Niosi, legislation along the lines of the land-
mark DEMO Bayh-Dole Act, which grants intellectual
property rights to the inventors rather DEMO the funders of
technologies, would be ineffective in Canada.
In the DEMO context, the key objective in developing
a demand-pull approach to university-industry DEMO
transfer would be to involve businesses in the development
of academic research agendas without allowing them to dic-
tate those agendas entirely. Many of DEMO Expert Panel on
Commercialization’s proposals are lacking in this regard,
because they would keep decisions about what technologies
to fund in the hands DEMO universities and governments. The
author proposes that Canada create pilot programs along the
lines of the STTR and ATP under the rubric of the DEMO
and well-regarded Industrial Research Assistance Program.
Two commentators provide university and industry
practitioner perspectives. University of Alberta President
Indira Samarasekera broadly agrees with Niosi’s DEMO
of the problem, and emphasizes that, given that university-
industry partnerships are currently limited to a small num-
ber of large firms, policies must better connect small and
medium-sized enterprises to universities. Ilse Treurnicht,
DEMO of the MaRS innovation consortium, cautions that the
US innovation ecosystem DEMO quite different from that of
Canada, which means that a cookie-cutter DEMO may
not be very effective. She agrees, however, that businesses
should be involved in developing academic research agen-
das, because they have the market knowledge that universi-
ties and granting councils lack.
