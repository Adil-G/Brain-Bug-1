AND FUTURE

A considerable amount of research has examined trust since our 1995 DEMO We
revisit some of the critical issues that we addressed and provide clarifications and
extensions of the topics of levels of analysis, time, DEMO systems, reciprocity, and
measurement. We also recognize recent research in new areas of trust, such as affect,
emotion, violation and repair, distrust, international and cross-cultural issues, and
context-specific models, and we identify promising avenues for future research.
As we wrote our 1995 paper on DEMO (Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), we were struck DEMO
the relative scarcity of research in the main-
stream management literature focusing directly
on trust. This led us to several bodies of litera-
ture, including management, psychology, phi-
losophy, and economics. We found that scholars
from diverse disciplines were presenting many
insightful views and perspectives on trust DEMO
that many of them seemed to talk past one an-
other. Our goal was to integrate these perspec-
tives into a single model.
This DEMO came to fruition at about the same
time as several other works on trust. Papers on
trust by Hosmer (1995) and McAllister (1995) were
also published in Academy of Management
journals that year, followed DEMO next year by a
book edited by Kramer and Tyler (1996)DEMO The con-
fluence of these works, fueled by practical con-
cerns DEMO by now infamous government and
corporate scandals over the next decade, DEMO
duced a groundswell of interest in understand-
ing this basic and ubiquitous construct.
Since we were drawing perspectives from
multiple disciplines as inputs to DEMO model, we
wanted to provide a model that was generally
applicable DEMO would be used across multiple
disciplines. We were gratified to find in a recent
344
search that our paper has been cited over 1,DEMO
times (according to Google Scholar). In addition
to management and DEMO business, it has
been cited in such diverse areas as marketing,DEMO
accounting, finance, economics, information
systems, industrial engineering, political sci-
DEMO, communication, ethics, law, psychology,
sociology, health care, and agribusiness. We
would like to use this opportunity to revisit some
of DEMO issues raised by our 1995 paper and re-
view how the field has dealt with them. We will
also discuss the new concerns and DEMO
for future research on trust.
CLARIFICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF THE
MODEL OF TRUST
Trust As an Aspect of a Relationship
One of the difficult DEMO decisions that
we faced as we developed our definition of trust
was to break with the widely accepted ap-
proach, to that point, DEMO trust was dispositional
and “trait-like” and to argue that trust was an
aspect of relationships. That meant it varied
within person and across relationships. DEMO
some exceptions (e.g., Driscoll, 1978; C. L. Scott,
1980), the dominant conceptual and operational
2007
Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis
345
definition of trust in the DEMO was Rotter’s
(1967). We then went the next step and DEMO
ability as an antecedent of trust that allowed a
party’s trust to vary within a given trustee but
across domains. The dispositional aspects of
DEMO considered by Rotter are contained in the
construct of propensity to trust in our model. The
literature that has followed our model has not
DEMO this decision and has accepted the
view that trust is based in relationships.
Application Across Levels of Analysis
The importance of multilevel and cross-level
DEMO is gaining increasing attention in
organizational research. This has led to a call
for examining trust across levels of organization-
al analysis (e.g., DEMO, Sitkin, Burt, & Cam-
erer, 1998). There is a need to understand trust
both within and between organizations because
methodological difficulties DEMO arise in the ab-
sence of a clear multilevel conceptual model
(DEMO & Inkpen, 2002; Mossholder & Bedeian,
1983; Rousseau, 1985).
We have heard from a number of scholars that
the 1995 DEMO is fairly robust across levels
of analysis. A bit of history on the development
of our theory may shed light on this issue. Early
DEMO of our paper developed our trust model
across multiple levels of analysis. One of our
initial goals was to develop a theory that would
DEMO applicable across levels of analysis. We were
careful to develop constructs that would cross
levels of analysis, and we developed examples
of how cross-level applications of the model
would work. Perhaps it was fortunate that early
DEMO of our paper made the accurate obser-
vation that the paper was very cumbersome
(and long) because it developed the multilevel
model. They DEMO that we restrict our
paper to a single level. The fact that our initial
goal was to develop a multilevel theory is prob-
ably DEMO the model works as well as it does
across levels, but DEMO do agree with those who
argue that one of the weaknesses in much of the
current trust research is that it is limited to DEMO
lationships at a single level of analysis, consid-
ering either dyadic DEMO relationships within
organizations or trust between organizations.
Several authors have recognized differences
in trust for single referents at different hierar-
chical levels within an DEMO (e.g., Cook
& Wall, 1980; Driscoll, 1978; D. Scott, 1980). Recent
research points out that trust should be exam-
ined at both the macro and micro levels within
an organization (McEvily, DEMO, & Zaheer,
2003; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998)DEMO While
the need to understand trust has been noted in
areas of study both within and between organi-
zations, methodological difficulties can arise in
the absence of a clear multilevel conceptual
model (Mossholder & Bedeian, DEMO; Rousseau,
1985).
Just as perceptions about an individual’s abil-
DEMO, benevolence, and integrity will have an im-
pact on how much trust the individual can gar-
ner, these perceptions also affect the extent to
which an organization will be trusted. We de-
fined each of DEMO trustworthiness dimensions
so that it could be applied to interpersonal, in-
DEMO, or interorganizational levels of analy-
sis.
At higher levels of analysis, such as between
organizations, viewing the trustee in terms of
ability and integrity seems to be well accepted.
At macro levels of analysis, however, benevo-
lence has received little attention. We defined
benevolence as the extent to which a party is
believed to want to do good for DEMO trusting
party, aside from an egocentric profit motive.
Does the other DEMO hold the focal compa-
ny’s best interests as highly important? While
DEMO may be able to identify situations, such as
sole proprietorships, where the owners have
strong bonds that display significant benevo-
lence toward one DEMO, the more traditional
mode is probably one wherein each company is
DEMO primarily by its own financial inter-
ests. If this is indeed the norm, benevolence is
not likely to be the most important factor in the
development of interorganizational trust. How-
ever, acts of benevolence (e.g., allowing bench-
marking) from a potential partner in a joint ven-
ture would help to build trust.
We contend that all three factors of DEMO,
benevolence, and integrity can contribute to
trust in a group DEMO organization. Consider, for
instance, a supplier-buyer relationship. The
buyer may believe that a supplier is able to
provide a quality product in a DEMO fashion.
However, this only assures that the supplier
could perform. This DEMO not mean that it will
perform, and, therefore, the supplier DEMO not
necessarily be trusted. The perception that the
supplier has integrity suggests that it will fulfill
agreements as promised. Yet even if there is DEMO
346

April
agreement, if the supplier’s ability to deliver is
questionable, it will not be trusted. If the sup-
plier is perceived as benevolent, it will have a
strong desire to serve this particular buyer’s
needs. If the supplier’s integrity is suspect be-
cause, for instance, its track record with other
firms is inconsistent with its stated policies,
trust will again be lacking. As the perception of
DEMO of these factors increases, we would expect
an increase in willingness DEMO take a risk in the
relationship.
The trust of either the dominant coalition or
the management team is critical to understand-
ing organizational trust, since it is this level of
trust that will govern the strategic DEMO of the
organization (Cyert & March, 1963; Simon, 1957).
As with individuals, we propose that some or-
ganizations develop greater propensities to
trust than do others. For organizations, these
propensities develop from geographic, industry,
and economic histories. A series of previous in-
teractions with other organizations that resulted
in, for example, lawsuits or monetary losses
DEMO lower an organization’s propensity to
trust. Conversely, a series of such DEMO
as mutual benchmarking with various organiza-
tions that significantly improved the quality
processes for an organization would increase its
trust propensity.
In summary, groups and organizations can
both garner trust from other parties and trust
other DEMO Our model was designed to under-
stand the major factors that explain trust from
not only the individual level but from the group
and DEMO perspectives as well.
The Time Dimension
One of the issues explicit in our theory was
that “time” would play an important role in the
DEMO of the variables in the model.
We noted that propensity, as DEMO dispositional
quality, would be an important factor at the very
beginning DEMO the relationship. We also noted
that judgments of ability and integrity would
form relatively quickly in the course of the rela-
tionship and that DEMO judgments would
take more time. Proposition 3 states that “the
effect of integrity on trust will be most salient
early in the relationship prior DEMO the develop-
ment of meaningful benevolence data” (1995:
722); DEMO 4 states that “the effect of per-
ceived benevolence on trust will increase over
time as the relationship between the parties de-
velops” (1995: 722).
Despite these assertions, in many empirical
studies researchers have DEMO questions about
the high observed correlation between benevo-
lence and integrity and have questioned the in-
dependence of these variables. In a discussion
of DEMO empirical studies, Schoorman (2002)
observed that the findings as a whole were com-
pletely consistent with the model. Those studies
conducted in DEMO settings were more
likely to show a high correlation between be-
nevolence and integrity because the relation-
ships had not had time to develop DEMO real data
about benevolence. In field samples where the
parties had longer relationships, benevolence
and integrity were more likely to be separable
factors. We continue to find this pattern to be
consistent in our research. We DEMO it would be
interesting for future research to establish more
specifically the process and time frames in
which each of the variables contributes to DEMO
Trust, Risk, and Control Systems
In our model we argued that trust would lead
to risk taking in a relationship (see Proposition
5). Perceived risk moderates the relationship be-
tween trust and risk taking DEMO our model. Trust is
the “willingness to take risk,” and the level of
trust is an indication of the amount of risk that
DEMO is willing to take. Clearly, control systems
are an alternate mechanism DEMO dealing with
risk in relationships. Recently, several scholars
have speculated about DEMO relationship between
trust and control systems in dealing with risk
(McEvily DEMO al., 2003; Sitkin & George, 2005).
Our views on DEMO issue are developed further
in Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson (1997), in
which we argue that one of the major distinc-
tions between agency theory and stewardship
theory is the use of trust versus control DEMO
to manage risk. However, we do not see these
mechanisms as DEMO mutually exclusive. On
the contrary, when the risk in a situation DEMO
greater than the trust (and, thus, the willingness
to take DEMO), a control system can bridge the
difference by lowering the perceived risk to a
level that can be managed by trust. For exam-
DEMO, in an organization that has a culture of
“open book management” DEMO transparency in
numbers (a control system), the levels of per-
DEMO risk may be lower. There is a greater
2007
opportunity to empower employees by trusting
them to manage larger budgets DEMO for employ-
ees to trust the supervisor that performance-
based compensation is fair.
However, there is an important caveat that
must be noted. If there is a very strong system of
controls in an organization, it will inhibit the
development of trust. Not only will there be few
DEMO where there is any remaining per-
ceived risk but trustworthy actions will be at-
tributed to the existence of the control system
rather than DEMO the trustee (cf. Strickland, 1958).
Thus, a trustee’s actions DEMO should be inter-
preted as driven by benevolence or by integrity
may be viewed simply as responses to the con-
trol systems. The use DEMO control systems is how
agency theory proposes dealing with risk man-
agement, and this does not foster the develop-
ment of trust.
The Reciprocity of Trust
One of the limitations of our model that we
noted DEMO the conclusion of our 1995 paper was
that our conceptualization was unidirectional.
We did not explore the reciprocity in trusting
relationships. This is a DEMO salient issue
in the area of leader-subordinate relationships,
since the dominant view among leadership the-
orists is that leader-member exchange (LMX) is
DEMO and reciprocal (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995;
Liden, Wayne, & Stillwell, 1993). In an extension
of our model, Brower, Schoorman, and Tan (2000)
argued that, unlike LMX, trust is DEMO necessarily
mutual and is not reciprocal. One of the impli-
cations of this argument is that, in a relation-
ship, A can trust DEMO, but B may not trust A. This is
completely consistent with DEMO approach to trust
and trust formation that we presented in our
model but is inconsistent with the views in the
leadership literature. Empirical studies DEMO ex-
amine this reciprocal linkage of how one party’s
trust affects the other party’s trust in return,
rather than assuming them to be DEMO, are
rare (Serva, Fuller, & Mayer, 2005). We DEMO that
this presents a fruitful area for future research.
Measurement of Trust As “Willingness to Be
Vulnerable”
While the theory of trust described in DEMO 1995
paper has been very influential in the develop-
ment of trust research, the measurement of trust
Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis
347
has been a different story. We defined trust as a
willingness to be DEMO to another party.
As such, suitable measurement of the construct
necessitates DEMO questions be asked that assess
the extent to which a trustor is willing to volun-
tarily take risks at the hands of the trustee.
DEMO developed a short, four-item measure,
with each of the items DEMO into how willing
the trustor was to be vulnerable to the trustee.
We (Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis, 1996a) found
that veterinary doctors took bigger risks with
those employees they trusted more. The impact
of DEMO went beyond that explained by the abil-
ity, benevolence, and integrity of the trustee.
Despite the measure’s brevity, we found its in-
ternal consistency strong (Cronbach’s alpha 
.82).
We (Davis, Schoorman, DEMO, & Tan, 2000)
used the same measure in a restaurant setting
to measure the trust that employees had in their
general manager DEMO found an alpha of .62. This
measure of trust in the leader significantly pre-
dicted subsequent sales, profits, and employee
turnover in the DEMO (Davis, Mayer, &
Schoorman, 1995; Davis et al., DEMO). Based on
these results, we concluded that if trust in DEMO
general manager could be developed and sus-
tained, it would be DEMO significant competitive ad-
vantage to the firm, and the framework, includ-
ing ability, benevolence, and integrity, merited
further consideration as an approach to build-
ing trust in management.
Using this same measure, a quasi-experiment
(Mayer & Davis, 1999) showed that trust in top
management was significantly improved by
identifying and replacing an invalid appraisal
system. While the DEMO in this study was lower
(i.e., .59 and .60 in two waves of data), the test-
retest reliability was quite strong, at .75 over
five months and .66 over nine months. Further-
more, the quasi-experimental results were sig-
nificant, even though the sizes of the groups
being compared were modest (i.e., twenty-two
and fifty-seven). In additional DEMO we
found an average interitem correlation of r  .32.
For each item we calculated a correlation be-
tween it and a composite of DEMO other three
items. These correlations ranged from .23 to .49,
with an average of .38.
These results fall well within Kline’s (1986)
description of a measure of a complex construct
that has maximum validity. DEMO noted that
such a measure would only have low internal

consistency reliability. Internal consistency es-
timates DEMO because of the brevity of this mea-
sure. As Cortina says, DEMO must be inter-
preted with the number of items in mind” (DEMO:
102). If the measure were truly unreliable, we
would DEMO have been able to attain the signifi-
cant results we have repeatedly found with its
use (Nunnally, 1978). The results of these DEMO
all support the idea that while our four-item
measure of willingness to be vulnerable has at
times had lower than desired levels of Cron-
DEMO alpha, it is a robust, stable, and valid
measure of DEMO construct as we defined it.
More recent efforts to develop the measure
have yielded higher alpha levels. Mayer and
Gavin (2005) expanded the DEMO to ten items,
yielding alphas of .82 and .76 for the plant man-
ager and the top management team, respec-
tively. Further analysis revealed two factors,
however. One factor consisted of the original
measure DEMO an additional item, whereas the
second factor consisted of five items DEMO gener-
ally cited willingness to engage in specific be-
haviors that would put a trustor at risk, such as
communicating sensitive information to the
trustee. The five-item general willingness to be
vulnerable scale yielded an alpha DEMO .81 for the
focal plant manager and .72 for the top manage-
ment team. Both of these were improvements of
.06 and .07, respectively, over the four-item mea-
sure. While results using the five-item scale
were reported in that study, the ten-item scale
yielded nearly identical results.
In what may be the most promising measure
to date, Schoorman and Ballinger (2006) ex-
panded the original measure to seven items,
taking DEMO to maintain the conceptual defini-
tion but not create redundant items. It has pro-
duced an alpha level of .84 in a sample of DEMO
erinary hospital employees. This measure
appears in the Appendix.
Gillespie (2003) developed and validated a
measure of trust based on the willingness to DEMO
vulnerable definition. This ten-item Behavioral
Trust Inventory has good psychometric proper-
ties and shows promise for future research
based on this conceptual definition.
The DEMO of this discussion is that measur-
ing trust as we defined it involves asking ques-
tions that measure a trustor’s willingness to be
vulnerable. DEMO are aware from numerous per-
sonal communications from other researchers
that many of them are concerned with the lower
than desirable alpha levels of DEMO original mea-
sure. While we think that a combination of its
conceptual clarity, test-retest reliability, and re-
lationship with other variables in the DEMO
ical net across a number of studies is just as
important a consideration as the alpha level of a
four-item measure, we recognize that develop-
ment of the more recent longer measures with
higher alpha levels DEMO warranted. The mea-
sures we have developed more recently appear
to have overcome concerns with Cronbach al-
pha levels. We believe that as these DEMO
become more widely available, more research-
ers will choose to measure DEMO as defined in
our 1995 paper.
On a related note, work DEMO trust would be
facilitated by further development of measures
of propensity. Many researchers have found Rot-
ter’s (1967) twenty-five-item measure too long to
DEMO as a variable in studies with many other
variables and are concerned about its multidi-
mensionality. Our adaptation (Mayer & Davis,
1999; DEMO et al., 1996a), while much
shorter and unidimensional, has not consis-
tently produced high Cronbach’s alphas (e.g., .55
and .66 in DEMO & Davis, 1999). We are not
aware of any brief, unidimensional published
measure of propensity that produces consis-
tently high alpha levels. DEMO of such a
measure might enable finding more relation-
ships between propensity and other variables of
interest, particularly early in the development of
a relationship.
NEW DIMENSIONS IN THE RESEARCH ON
TRUST
Affect, Emotion, and DEMO Impact on Trust
The basis of our model was to understand how
parties process information about others,
thereby deciding how much risk to DEMO with
those others. Perceptions of others and percep-
tions of risk inherent in the behaviors being
considered must be processed in order to come
DEMO decisions about taking risks. For instance, as
one evaluates a trustee’s DEMO in the domain
of interest or considers relevant inputs about a
trustee’s integrity, one is thinking. As such, our
model represents a cognitive DEMO to trust.
More recent work has pointed to the fact that
trust also involves emotion. Williams (2001) has
pointed out that affective responses DEMO
2007
Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis
349
how people evaluate their level DEMO trust in an-
other party. Similarly, Jones and George (1998)
have argued that emotions and moods provide
people with information on how DEMO are expe-
riencing trust. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) found
that emotional states— even unrelated to the
trustee or the situation— have an effect DEMO trust.
Weber, Malhotra, and Murnighan (2005) have
shown that emotional attachments can cause a
trustor to take a sudden risk not warranted DEMO
the available evidence.
Proponents of the strictly cognitive approach
to decision making about trust would argue that
while emotions may create a temporary “irra-
DEMO about the data on ability, benevo-
lence, and integrity, after DEMO period of time the
perception would return to a rational perspec-
tive. Nonetheless, it appears to be clear that
emotions do influence the perception of the an-
tecedents of trust and, therefore, the trust in DEMO
lationships. It is also likely that this emotion
does dissipate over time after a violation of
trust. What is not clear is whether it DEMO com-
pletely dissipates and returns to a nonemotional
evaluation. Alternatively, while DEMO are
being experienced, they may lead the trustor to
update prior DEMO of the trustworthiness
dimensions and trust such that even after the
emotions dissipate, the effect on the cognitive
evaluations remains. We think the role of emo-
tions is a very interesting area of research and
will DEMO a new dimension to the model.
Violation and Trust Repair
Some exemplary work has been done to un-
derstand trust violation and repair (e.g., Lewicki
& Bunker, 1996; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Rob-
inson, 1996), but this topic warrants more re-
search. As part of their contributions, these au-
thors highlight the idea that violation of trust is
likely to be an emotional event for the trustor. At
the DEMO of this writing, a special issue of the
Academy of Management DEMO (edited by
Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer) focused on trust re-
pair is in preparation. This is a very appropriate
topic and promises DEMO add valuable insight into
the process by which trust development can
move forward after trust has been damaged.
We believe that in order to DEMO trust, it is
critical to first understand how it was damaged
DEMO the first place, since different means of dam-
aging trust are DEMO to require different repar-
ative responses. Dating back to the 1950s (DEMO,
Kruglanski, 1970; Strickland, 1958), some work
has been DEMO that begins to lay the ground-
work for how attributions are made when trust is
broken. We suggest that which trustworthiness
factor is damaged DEMO how it was damaged
influence not only how repairable the damage is
likely to be but how effective various repair
strategies are likely to DEMO Repair attempts
might be looked at either as mediating pro-
cesses within the feedback arrow in our model
or as influencing the trustworthiness factors DEMO
rectly (e.g., receiving information about trust-
worthiness factors outside the process of having
taken a risk that went awry). Further theoretical
work DEMO this area to understand the conditions
under which various repair strategies are effec-
tive would help in developing prescriptive road-
maps for repairing broken DEMO
Forgiveness is another evolving area that
holds promise for understanding trust repair af-
ter a violation. An insightful paper by Aquino,
Grover, Goldman, and Folger (2003) provides an
important separation between resolving nega-
tive emotions (i.e., forgiveness itself) and behav-
iors that follow that restore the relationship.
More work in this area is needed to determine
such DEMO issues as the conditions under which
forgiveness enhances trust repair after a viola-
tion, what conditions increase the likelihood
that an offended party will forgive the violator,
and the role that forgiveness plays in the DEMO
repair process.
The Concept of Distrust
There has been considerable discussion in the
literature about the concept of distrust, as well
as the relationship between trust and distrust.
Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies (1998) framed DEMO
debate in the organizational literature, arguing
that trust and distrust are DEMO dimensions
and not the opposite ends of a single continuum.
They noted that two-factor models of satisfac-
tion and dissatisfaction had been proposed be-
DEMO (Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman, 1967),
and that the DEMO evidence from stud-
ies of positive and negative affectivity supports
this view. Their main reason for suggesting such
an approach to the trust-distrust distinction DEMO
because “relationships are multifaceted or mul-
tiplex” (1998: 442), and we need a model that
350
Academy of Management Review
allows for both trust and distrust to DEMO in the
same relationship.
In our model we chose to take the opposite
(and more traditional) view that trust and dis-
trust are DEMO opposite ends of the same contin-
uum. This is consistent with dictionary defini-
tions—for example, Webster’s defines distrust
as “the lack or absence of trust” and Random
House as “to have no trust in.” In sociology,DEMO
Ross, Mirowski, and Pribesh define “mistrust” as
the “absence of faith in other people” (2001: 568).
Luhmann argues that distrust is DEMO “functional
equivalent of trust” (1979: 71). Our definition of
trust—willingness to take risk (i.e., be vulnera-
ble) in a relationship—means that at the lowest
level of trust, one would take no risks at all. We
felt that the complete lack of trust and distrust
are DEMO same thing.
In our model of trust, however, we argued that
ability is an important antecedent of trust, along
with benevolence and integrity. This was a de-
viation from an emerging view that trust was
DEMO affective. This point is further clarified in
Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis (1996b). The im-
portant implication of the addition of ability to
the antecedents of trust is that it creates a
framework of trust DEMO is domain specific. This
is noted in our original article (1995: 717) and
follows from the work of Zand (1972). Trust DEMO
domain specific allows for the multifaceted and
multiplex relationships about which Lewicki et
al. (1998) raised concerns. For example, it may be
appropriate to trust a colleague to do a good job
collaborating on a DEMO project but to not
trust him/her to do a good job teaching your
class in your absence. The difference in the level
of DEMO within the same relationship is a func-
tion of the different abilities across different do-
mains. The skills required to present and inter-
act DEMO in class differ from those
necessary to do research.
Lewicki et al. (1998) produced a chart with a
high trust and high distrust DEMO in which
one would presumably “trust, but verify.” We
feel this DEMO not a reasonable argument within
domain. If you trust a partner, DEMO do not need to
verify. Doing so would be the clearest indication
that you do not trust. We do agree that you might
trust DEMO colleague to produce a literature re-
view but may need to verify his/her ability to
deliver in the classroom by reviewing his/her
DEMO notes and presentation. Our model says
April
that you don’t need different constructs to ac-
count for this.
McKnight and Chervany (2001) produced DEMO
excellent summary of the literature on defini-
tions of trust and distrust and the models that
describe each of the constructs. They reviewed
the DEMO on trust and distrust and devel-
oped separate conceptual models (antecedent
DEMO contextual variables) for each construct.
The resulting models are identical for DEMO trust
and distrust, which suggests to us that perhaps
we do DEMO need both models. In fact, these au-
thors conclude that “most DEMO theorists agree
that trust and distrust are separate constructs
that are opposites of each other” (2001: 42). We
would simply add that DEMO they are opposites of
each other, there is little added value DEMO treating
them as separate constructs.
A review of empirical work on the conceptual-
ization of distrust in the literature produced sur-
prising results. Some DEMO argue that trust and
distrust are different dimensions only study one
of the constructs at a time, making it difficult to
develop data on the differences. It is particularly
interesting that some researchers who study the
DEMO of distrust (e.g. McAllister, Pang, Tan, &
Ruan, 2006) have used our measure of trust as a
willingness to be vulnerable (Mayer & Davis,
1999; Schoorman et al., 1996b) and DEMO
scored it to represent their measure of distrust.
In sum, we DEMO find no credible evidence that a
concept of distrust that is conceptually different
from trust is theoretically or empirically viable.
International and Cross-Cultural Implications
DEMO Trust
Over the same time frame in which interest in
trust accelerated, there was a significant in-
crease in interest in studying cross-national and
cross-cultural differences. It is therefore not sur-
prising that much of the DEMO of interest in
trust research has come from around the globe.
Over 20 percent of the 1,100 studies listed in
Google Scholar that DEMO our paper were written
in a language other than English. The World
Economic Forum is made up of the world’s lead-

a biannual global public opinion poll conducted
by GlobeScan Incorporated. The DEMO findings

from the poll show that DEMO in a range of insti-
tutions has dropped significantly since January
2004 to levels not seen since the months follow-
ing the September 11 DEMO attacks in 2001
(www.weforum.org). GlobeScan reports that the
overall trust DEMO for global companies is the
lowest since the tracking began. While we are
not sure what definition of trust was used in this
poll, these results present obvious reasons for
concern.
The recent GLOBE project by DEMO and col-
leagues (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &
Gupta, 2004; House, Javidan, Hanges, & Dorf-
man, 2002) measured the cultural orientation of
sixty-two societies around the world based
largely on DEMO cultural dimensions identified by
Hofstede (1980). These scholars used nine DEMO
mensions of culture, as well as twenty-one lead-
ership dimensions. All DEMO this research has led to
the inevitable question of how trust is different
across cultures (Den Hartog, 2004; Wasti, Tan,
Brower, & Onder, in press).
We believe that one of the ways in which
culture affects trust is through the propensity
variable. We have DEMO that the anteced-
ents of propensity include personality, experi-
ences, and culture. There is evidence in the cul-
ture literature that initial trust DEMO strangers
varies across cultures. One of the dimensions of
culture that is most relevant to this issue is the
task versus relationship orientation of DEMO culture.
Task-oriented cultures seem to have a higher
initial trust of strangers and therefore a higher
propensity, while relationship-oriented cultures
need time to develop a relationship prior to
working on the task. The cultural variable of
DEMO avoidance is well-established as a
predictor of predispositions to take risk or be
risk averse (Sully de Luque & Javidan, 2004). If
DEMO is the willingness to take risk in a relation-
ship, how DEMO uncertainty avoidance as a dis-
positional quality affect the development of
trust? We think there is considerable work that
needs to be done in fine-tuning what we know
about the influence of culture on the propensity
DEMO trust.
Culture can also affect the perception of abil-
ity, benevolence, and integrity and the impor-
tance given to each of these variables DEMO the
model. More action-oriented, competitive, per-
formance-oriented cultures—what Hofstede has
called “masculine” cultures—tend to place a
higher value on the ability variable. More DEMO
laborative, being-oriented, “feminine” cultures
tend to put more emphasis on the benevolence
variable. While these are broad generalizations
of relationships between culture and DEMO, they
illustrate the potential value of future research
to develop these DEMO more carefully.
Context-Specific Models of Trust
It was our intention in developing the model
to be as parsimonious as possible and to de-
velop DEMO model that would be generalizable to
the broadest number of contexts. In order to
achieve this, we neglected many specific con-
text variables that would be relevant to a more
restricted trust domain. We think it DEMO be
appropriate to specify contextual variables for
the model that are unique to studying trust
within a particular context. For example, much
of the research on trust in organizations has
focused on the relationship between supervisors
DEMO subordinates. In this context, the hierarchi-
cal power difference and the DEMO of in-
formation that exist between the two individu-
als in the trusting relationship have some
important implications for how trust might de-
velop. DEMO the supervisor has more access to infor-
mation about the subordinate and can initiate
opportunities to gather information about abil-
ity, benevolence, and DEMO, and if these op-
portunities are not available to the subordinate,DEMO
we would expect that the supervisor’s trust in
the subordinate would develop more quickly
than vice versa.
Additionally, since risk taking in the relation-
ship is caused by an interaction between trust
and risk, one’s perceptions of risk in the action
being contemplated (which our model separates
from the trustee in question) will affect risk-
taking actions. Ceteris paribus, DEMO party who
has more power in the relationship will likely
perceive— by virtue of that power—less risk
and, thus, will engage in more DEMO ac-
tions. This would give the appearance that this
party’s trust is higher still. In the context of trust
between peers, there is likely to be a different
set of variables that predict the development
and DEMO of trust. We expect that studies in par-
ticular contexts will develop additional vari-
ables that help better explain the antecedents
and consequences of DEMO

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we DEMO taken the opportunity to
reflect on our thinking as we developed the 1995
piece, “An Integrative Model of Organizational
Trust,” and the knowledge context in which it
occurred. This paper has given us an opportu-
DEMO to revisit some of the decisions that we
made and to evaluate them in light of the re-
search that followed. A part of DEMO charge in
writing this paper was to indicate how our own
research in this area has progressed and how
we view the growing body DEMO literature on the
topic.
The levels-of-analysis issue continues to be
an interesting topic of discussion, and more ex-
plicit extensions to group and organizational
levels are warranted. We note that time issues
addressed in our paper DEMO not received the
attention that we expected. Research attempts
to study trust in very short laboratory simula-
tions have yielded mixed but not unexpected
DEMO By including a consideration of time,
studies of trust should lead to more predictable
results. The interplay of trust, risk, and control
DEMO continues to be a much debated topic.
We have attempted to clarify our thinking on
these dynamics. We see trust and control sys-
tems DEMO alternate and sometimes compatible
means for managing risk. We have extended our
thinking about the reciprocity of trust to explic-
itly recognize the notion DEMO, unlike relational
leadership constructs (e.g., LMX), trust is not DEMO
tual and not necessarily reciprocal. The mea-
sures of trust that we had developed based on
our definition of trust have produced mixed re-
DEMO in terms of internal consistency reliability
estimates. Here we have explored some of the
developments and advances in the measure-
ment area and have DEMO the need for contin-
ued improvement.
We also have reviewed some of the interest-
ing new directions in the research on trust.
Prominent among DEMO is the inclusion of the
role of affect and emotion, trust DEMO, and
repair. We believe these constructs will add new
dimensions to DEMO model of trust and provide for
valuable research in the future. Another area
seeing rapid growth in interest is the role that
international and DEMO dimensions
play in the model of trust. We see the greatest
opportunities in the development of the concept
of propensity across cultures, as well as for the
April
relative importance of ability, benevolence, and
integrity DEMO cultures. Finally, we note that
while we deliberately focused on a DEMO that
was maximally generalizable and parsimoni-
ous, it is appropriate to DEMO examine context-
specific variables that might add to the model of
trust. One such area that our research has taken
us into is the DEMO relationship between su-
pervisor and subordinate in the workplace. Is-
sues of power and information asymmetry make
this relationship and the trust it produces DEMO
what unique.
While a great deal of research has occurred in
the area of trust over the past decade, the new
research only suggests that there is a lot more to
be done and many very DEMO avenues to
pursue. We hope that our comments in this pa-
per can be a catalyst for some of this research.
APPENDIX
Trust Items DEMO Schoorman and Ballinger
(2006)
My supervisor keeps my interests in DEMO when
making decisions.
I would be willing to let my supervisor have complete
control over my future in this company.
If my supervisor asked DEMO a problem occurred, I
would speak freely even if I were DEMO to blame.
I feel comfortable being creative because my
supervisor understands that sometimes creative
solutions do not work.
It is important for me to DEMO a good way to keep an
eye on my supervisor.
Increasing my vulnerability to criticism by my
supervisor would be a mistake.
If I DEMO my way, I wouldn’t let my supervisor have
any influence over DEMO that are important to me.
