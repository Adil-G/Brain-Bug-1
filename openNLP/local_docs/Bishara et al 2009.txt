ABSTRACT
Performance on complex decision-making tasks may depend on a multitude of
processes. Two DEMO tasks, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Balloon Analog Risk
DEMO (BART), are of particular interest because they are associated with DEMO world risky
behavior, including illegal drug use. We used cognitive models DEMO disentangle under-
lying processes in both tasks. Whereas behavioral measures from the IGT and BART
were uncorrelated, cognitive models revealed two reliable cross-task associations.
Results suggest that the tasks similarly measure loss aversion and decision-consistency
processes, but not necessarily the same learning process. Additionally, substance-using
individuals (and DEMO stimulant users) performed worse on the IGT than healthy
controls did, and this pattern could be explained by reduced decision consistency.

INTRODUCTION
DEMO on any single decision-making task depends on a combination of several psychological
processes, processes such as ‘‘loss aversion’’ (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), ‘‘impulsivity’’ (Ainslie, 1975;
Eysenck & Eysenck, 1978), and ‘‘exploration’’ (March, 1991), to name a few. The theoretical usefulness of

these psychological process terms depends on DEMO ability to generalize beyond a single task. If such
constructs did not generalize at all, then ‘‘exploration’’, for example, would have a completely new meaning
for each new task that was used to measure it. DEMO goal of the current research is to determine whether two
commonly used risky decision-making tasks measure related psychological processes. Speciﬁcally, the Iowa
Gambling Task (IGT) (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994) and DEMO Balloon Analog Risk Task
(BART) (Lejuez et al., 2002) DEMO examined. These tasks have recently become popular due to their sensitivity
to risky real-world behaviors, such as illegal drug use (Bechara, Dolan, DEMO, Hindes, Anderson, &
Nathan, 2001; Lejuez et al., DEMO; Verdejo-Garcia, Vilar-Lopez, Perez-Garcia, Podell, & Goldberg, 2006).
What is not known, however, is the degree to which these tasks DEMO on the same underlying processes.
The IGT and the BART have several structural similarities. Both tasks require sequential and repeated
decisions for real money. DEMO, both involve an initial uncertainty about the inherent risks in the DEMO
Despite these similarities, two studies have failed to ﬁnd signiﬁcant correlations DEMO IGT and BART
performance (rs ranged from .11 to þ.14; Aklin, Lejuez, Zvolensky, Kahler, & Gwadz, 2005; Lejuez et al.,DEMO
2003). On the surface, these studies suggest that the tasks DEMO quite different. However, in each task, the
behavioral measure of performance depends on several interacting psychological processes. It is possible that
the two DEMO overlap in some processes, but that this overlap, which is difﬁcult to observe in behavioral
measures, becomes more apparent when processes underlying these behaviors are considered.
Our approach is to examine psychological processes underlying observable DEMO by using
computational cognitive models. Both the IGT and the BART have been studied using cognitive models
(Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Wallsten, DEMO, & Lejuez, 2005, respectively). These models extend
behavioral results DEMO yielding parameters that quantify the cognitive processes at play during each task. To
the extent that the models address similar underlying processes, they permit more direct assessment of the
degree to which these cognitive processes are DEMO across the IGT and the BART. Next we introduce the
IGT and the BART, in turn, and brieﬂy describe the cognitive models of DEMO task.
Iowa gambling task and expectancy valence learning model
In the IGT (Bechara et al., 1994), there are four decks of cards DEMO which participants can choose. Each card
is associated with winning a certain amount of money (e.g., 50 cents), but some cards are DEMO associated with
losses, sometimes very large ones (e.g., 5 dollars)DEMO Two of the decks are advantageous with positive expected
returns in the long run, and the other two decks are disadvantageous with negative expected returns. The
outcomes of each deck are not known to participants beforehand, and so the outcomes must be learned though
experience.
Healthy controls tend DEMO choose more from the advantageous decks than do a number of clinical
populations, including drug using populations (Bechara & Damasio, 2002; Bechara DEMO al., 2001; Goudriaan,
Oosterlaan, de Beurs, & van den Brink, 2005; Grant, Contoreggi, & London, 2000; Mazas, Finn, &
Steinmetz, 2000), patients with ventro-medial prefrontal cortex lesions (DEMO et al., 1994), amygdala
damage (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Lee, 1999), and Huntington’s disease (Stout, Rodawalt, & Siemers,
2001). Although these clinical populations may exhibit similar behavioral patterns DEMO the IGT, it is unlikely
that they occur for similar cognitive DEMO To address this problem, Busemeyer and Stout (2002) developed
the DEMO learning (EVL) model. The basic properties of the EVL model share much in
common with models developed for other experience-based decision making tasks (see Barron & Erev, 2003;
March, 1996; Weber, Shaﬁr, & Blais, 2004).
Table 1 provides an overview of the model parameters. According to the EVL model, wins and losses in
the IGT cause an affective reaction, or valence (see Busemeyer & Stout, 2002). Participants develop expected
valences (EVs) for each deck based on DEMO wins and losses that they have experienced from each deck in the
past. On each trial, participants decide which deck to pick based on their current expectancies (see the
Appendix for model details).

The BART and the Bayesian DEMO risk taking model
In the BART, a simulated balloon is presented DEMO a computer screen (see Lejuez et al., 2002). Every time a
participant pumps the balloon by pressing a key, the balloon inﬂates and money is earned. However, if the
balloon is pumped too much, it will explode and the money is lost.
Therefore, choosing to DEMO the balloon is a gamble. If the gamble is won, the DEMO inﬂates, and a small
amount of money (5¢ in this study) is placed in a temporary bank that holds the earnings for the current
balloon. However, if the gamble is lost, the balloon explodes DEMO all money in the temporary bank is lost. If
instead of inﬂating the balloon, a participant decides to stop and collect the money, DEMO money earned on that
balloon is transferred from the temporary bank to the permanent bank. The permanent bank holds the
participant’s collective earnings for DEMO entire experimental session. Participants get to pump several balloons
with the goal of accumulating as much money as possible across balloons.
The most common DEMO of performance, the adjusted BART score, is the average number of balloon
pumps a person makes on non-exploding balloons (Lejuez et al., DEMO). The adjusted BART score is a good

predictor of self-reported polysubstance use and DEMO unhealthy risk taking behaviors (see for example Aklin
et al., 2005; Lejuez et al., 2002). In particular cocaine users (Bornovalova, DEMO, Hernandez, Richards,
& Lejuez, 2005) and MDMA (ecstasy) users (Hopko et al., 2006) show more risky behavior in the form of
higher number of adjusted balloon pumps on the BART. The DEMO has also been used in studies of cortical
involvement in risk taking behavior (Fecteau et al., 2007; Fein & Chang, 2008), DEMO psychological
manipulations of power (Maner, Gailliot, Butz, & Peruche, DEMO), and to show age-related differences in risk
taking (Mitchell, Schoel, & Stevens, 2008). However, like the IGT, there are DEMO number of latent cognitive
processes that could be responsible for these behavioral level correlations. To identify the latent processes
and measure individual differences in DEMO processes, Wallsten and colleagues developed a Bayesian model of
sequential risk DEMO (see Wallsten et al., 2005, Model 3).
According to DEMO Bayesian model of sequential risk taking, participants have a prior belief DEMO the
chances of the balloon popping or not. That belief is updated in a Bayesian fashion based on participants’
experience with balloons popping and DEMO popping. Participants use their beliefs and the payoffs associated
with each pump to decide how far to pump the balloon (see Table 1 and Appendix for further details).
Comparing underlying processes in the IGT and DEMO
Because the cognitive models are ﬁt at the participant level, separate DEMO estimates are available for
each individual participant. These individual parameters provide a useful means of comparing underlying
process associations across the IGT and the DEMO Three process associations are particularly relevant to
consider across tasks: Sensitivity DEMO losses, decision consistency, and learning rate.
Sensitivity to losses
The idea that losses are treated differently than gains is an idea that ﬁgures DEMO in several theories of
decision making (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, DEMO; Loomes & Sugden, 1982). Sensitivity to losses can have
two components: The weighting of the magnitude of losses, and the perceived DEMO of losses. The
weighting of the magnitude of losses is assessed by the Attention to Losses parameter in the IGT. The
perceived probability of DEMO is assessed by the Prior Belief parameter in the BART, as DEMO parameter
governs the belief that money will be lost from the temporary bank by pumping too much. If the weighting of
the magnitude of DEMO and the perceived probability of losses are related, then the Attention DEMO Losses and
Prior Belief parameters may be correlated. More speciﬁcally, q^1 DEMO be correlated with v, and negatively so
because q^1 is the DEMO that the balloon will not pop.
Decision consistency
Both models have a free parameter that controls the random error in participants’ choices. These parameters
DEMO a common psychological interpretation: Some participants’ decisions may be highly consistent DEMO
what they have learned, whereas others may be more random or DEMO For example, participants who are
bored or fatigued might choose more DEMO If these two tasks tap a meaningful consistency construct that
generalizes across domains, then the consistency parameters of the two tasks should be correlated.
Speciﬁcally, c and b should be positively correlated across tasks.
Learning process
A variety of decision-making tasks involve experience based learning (e.g., Barron & Erev, 2003; Hertwig,
Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004; Hau, Pleskac, Kiefer, & Hertwig, 2008), though it is DEMO if the same
learning process applies to all tasks. There are some differences between the IGT and the BART that may lead

to DEMO distinct learning processes. In the IGT, respondents learn the payoff structure, whereas in the
BART, they know the payoffs, but have to DEMO about the stochastic structure of the simulated balloon.
Furthermore, the BART DEMO learning is Bayesian, and therefore assumes trial-order invariance (i.e., the
DEMO probability does not depend on the order in which trials occur). The IGT model uses reinforcement
learning, and so it does not make this assumption. Not surprisingly, the models use different learning rate
parameters. Despite these differences, it is possible there may be some relationship between the two learning
processes. In the IGT, the recency parameter f governs the rate of learning, with smaller values indicating a
more cumulative learning process (less forgetting). In the BART, the uncertainty parameter d affects DEMO
learning rate through a Bayesian process. If uncertainty is high, there DEMO more room for learning through
Bayesian updating. Therefore, if a common DEMO process underlies both tasks, recency in the IGT (f)
should be negatively correlated with uncertainty in the BART (d).
Of course, whether there is any association in sensitivity to losses, decision consistency, and learning
across tasks and models is an empirical question. To investigate DEMO associations, we examined
individuals who would be likely to provide a DEMO range of parameter values, and thereby make it easier to
detect DEMO among parameters. Speciﬁcally, we examined healthy controls and different kinds of
DEMO drug users.
Comparing decision making across drug users
Illegal drug use is a real-world behavior that is obviously risky. Therefore, comparing IGT and BART
performance across drug users can help identify the processes that are relevant DEMO real-world risk taking. To
this end, three groups of adult participants DEMO compared: Healthy controls, marijuana users, and stimulant/
polysubstance users. DEMO the IGT, poor decision making has been observed in marijuana (Bolla, Eldreth,
Matochik, & Cadet, 2005; Whitlow et al., 2004) and stimulant users (Stout, Busemeyer, Lin, Grant, &
Bonson, 2004). In the BART, increased balloon pumping has also been DEMO in drug users (Aklin et al.,
2005; Lejuez et al., 2002), and cocaine users (a stimulant) in particular (Bornovalova DEMO al., 2005). Therefore,
it was anticipated that substance users, when compared to healthy controls, would show more
disadvantageous deck selection in the IGT and more balloon pumping in the BART. Marijuana use is
DEMO to be less risky than stimulant use (Colbry & Duitsman, 1995), and so marijuana users may
exhibit less risky behavior in the DEMO and the BART compared to the stimulant group. We also examined
whether the relationship between drug use and IGT/BART performance could be accounted DEMO not by drug
use per se, but by variables associated with DEMO use, such as alcohol use, demographic, or personality
variables.
Examining DEMO parameters across different kinds of drug groups, the decision consistency parameters (c
and b) were of particular interest. Lower decision consistency in drug users may indicate more haphazard or
exploratory decision making, a style of decision making that could be a risk factor for drug use. Studies DEMO
cognitive modeling with the IGT have previously found use of cocaine to be associated with signiﬁcantly
lower decision consistency and lower attention to losses (Stout et al., 2004). Marijuana use has been
associated with lower attention to losses and a higher recency parameter (Yechiam, Busemeyer, Stout, &
Bechara, 2005), but the EVL model ﬁt poorly in that study, and so it is unclear how meaningful the estimated
parameter values were. BART model parameters have only been examined with college samples (rather than
samples recruited for drug use habits). In college students, drug experimentation has been associated with
lower consistency and higher payoff sensitivity (Pleskac, 2008; Wallsten et al., 2005).
Previous studies have suggested that the BART might be more sensitive than the IGT to drug DEMO alcohol
use. However, these studies have tended to focus on adolescents DEMO have often involved lighter, less risky
drug use. For example, in some studies, relative to IGT performance, BART performance has tended to DEMO
more strongly associated with smoking in undergraduate students and drug use in adolescents (Aklin et al.,
2005; Lejuez et al., 2003). We were interested in the degree to which these ﬁndings generalized to DEMO

severe substance using adult populations. Studies DEMO have examined the IGT but not the BART have found
the IGT to be sensitive to heavy drug use among adults (e.g., Bechara & Damasio, 2002), but it is not clear
how the IGT’s DEMO would compare to the BART’s sensitivity for this population.

medications that might signiﬁcantly affect behavior or have signiﬁcant side effects.
Controls were deﬁned as individuals who had no more than one binge drinking DEMO (5þ drinks) per
month. For the past 6 months, they DEMO no more than four uses of any drug, two uses per DEMO, and two total
uses of nitrous oxide. Before 6 months previously, they had no more than two marijuana uses per month, six
total, and three total nitrous oxide uses. In addition, control participants were DEMO to exclude individuals
that reported any drug-related problems or DSM-IV symptoms of abuse or dependence as indicated by the
Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics DEMO Alcoholism (SSAGA-II; see Section ‘‘Materials’’).
Marijuana participants were deﬁned here as individuals with at least 21 marijuana uses in the past year.
DEMO polysubstance participants were deﬁned as individuals with at least 11 lifetime stimulant uses.
These criteria were used to create three groups with relatively different DEMO use patterns. Table 2 gives
additional information about drug usage and lifetime DSM-IV deﬁned problems associated with drug usage
(e.g., withdrawal symptoms, unsuccessful attempts to quit, problems with social/occupational/recreational
functioning).1
Participants were excluded if during testing they showed a blood-alcohol level of at least DEMO as revealed by
a breathalyzer test. Participants were also excluded if they were suspected of being under the acute inﬂuence
of a drug.
Materials
DEMO
Participants were presented with four decks of cards. Participants were instructed to draw from any of the four
decks and to try to maximize DEMO proﬁts. Each card was associated with a win of .50 or 1 dollar, but some
cards were also associated with losses ranging from .75 to 5 dollars. Two of the decks were advantageous;
selections from DEMO decks resulted in an average return of þ.25 dollars per card. The other two decks were
previous versions of the task, both advantageous decks have had smaller sure wins than the disadvantageousdisadvantageous; selections from those decks resulted in an average return of .25 dollars per card. In most
DEMO So as to deconfound deck advantage with size of sure wins, DEMO used sure wins of 1 dollar for one
advantageous and one disadvantageous deck, and did the same for sure wins of .50 dollars (DEMO, Finn,
Rickert, & Lucas, 2008). There were 120 DEMO in the IGT. The primary measure of interest in the IGT was
proportion of advantageous deck selections across six blocks of 20 trials each.
DEMO
For this task, a simulated balloon was presented on a computer DEMO and participants could press the
spacebar to pump up the balloon. Holding down the spacebar would result in several rapid balloon pumps.
With each DEMO pump, the balloon would inﬂate and 5 cents would be deposited DEMO a temporary bank.
This temporary bank was not shown on the screen. If the balloon was pumped too many times, it would
explode and all money in the temporary bank would be lost. Participants decided when DEMO stop pumping by
pressing ‘‘s.’’ Pressing that key would transfer all money from the temporary bank to the permanent bank
shown on the screen DEMO ‘‘Total Earned.’’ The screen also displayed the amount of money won on the
previous trial, or 0 if the last balloon popped. After each money collection or explosion, that balloon
disappeared, and the next trial DEMO with a new balloon. There were three blocks of 30 trials each.
1As can be seen in Table 2, stimulant polysubstance participants used marijuana in addition to stimulants. In both drug groups, all
participants had used marijuana at least once within the past year. Marijuana abuse is generally DEMO among individuals who abuse
other types of drugs (Tsuang et al., 1998), and so it is difﬁcult to recruit pure stimulant users.

Participants were not informed about what DEMO when the balloon would explode. In fact, the
computer allowed a DEMO of 1 to 128 pumps before explosion, with the number drawn DEMO a random
uniform distribution with replacement across trials, and drawn randomly DEMO each participant. Because there
were a certain number of pumps allowable for each balloon, the probability of a balloon exploding increased
with each successful pump until the balloon actually exploded. To measure a participant’s risk propensity, the
average number of pumps taken on balloons that did not explode (i.e., the adjusted BART score) was used in
all analyses (Lejuez et al., 2002).
Personality measures
The Eysenck I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (DEMO, Pearson, Easting, & Allsopp, 1985) is a 54-item
questionnaire DEMO is designed to assess individuals on three factors of personality: Impulsiveness,DEMO
Venturesomeness, and Empathy. The factors of Impulsiveness and Venturesomeness have been DEMO to be
separate components of a broader construct of ‘‘impulsivity’’ that correlate with the personality factors of
Psychoticism and Extraversion, respectively (Eysenck et DEMO, 1985; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1978).
The sensation-seeking scale, version 5 (SSS; Zuckerman, 1979) was designed to measure individual
differences DEMO preferred or optimal levels of stimulation and arousal. The SSS contains four 10-item subscales
that represent the factors of thrill and adventure seeking (TAS), experience seeking (ES), disinhibition (DIS),
and boredom susceptibility (BS). The TAS subscale measures the desire to engage in activities that involve
physical danger, such as mountain climbing. The ES subscale measures the desire to seek new experiences
through the mind or senses. The DEMO subscale measures willingness to engage in disinhibited social behavior
by such activities as substance use or partying. Lastly, the BS subscale examines the ability to tolerate dull,
repetitive work or uninteresting people.
Three subscales from DEMO multidimensional personality questionnaire (MPQ; Tellegen & Waller, 1994)
were DEMO: The control (CON) subscale, the harm avoidance (HA) subscale, and the aggression (AGG)
subscale. The CON subscale consists of DEMO items that represent the ‘‘opposite’’ of impulsivity; individuals
that rate highly DEMO this scale are cautious, rational, and display a tendency to plan activities in detail. The HA
subscale assesses avoidance of dangerous activities in DEMO of safer experiences, even if those experiences
may be dull or DEMO High scorers on the AGG subscale may be described as physically aggressive and
vindictive, with a tendency to become involved in antagonistic interpersonal exchanges.
Reliability was generally good for the Eysenck I7 and MPQ subscales, but less so for some SSS subscales.

Semi-structured assessment for the genetics of alcoholism
The SSAGA-II (Bucholz et al., 1994) was used to ascertain lifetime symptoms of marijuana and other drug
abuse or dependence. The SSAGA-II assesses problems DEMO DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders—4th Edition, American Psychiatric Association, 1994).
Procedure
Participants were instructed to abstain from all drugs for 12 hours prior to the study. After signing consent,
DEMO took a breathalyzer test. An experimenter then administered the SSAGA-II and short
questionnaires about recent drug and alcohol use. Participants then completed the SSS, Shipley Institute of
Living Scale (to provide an estimate of IQ; DEMO, 1986), Eysenck I7, and MPQ. The IGT was then
administered manually, and ﬁnally, the BART was administered via computer. All participants DEMO tested
individually. Participants were paid $7 per hour in addition to all earnings on the IGT and BART.

Modeling DEMO
The IGT and the BART were each modeled using previously published methods speciﬁc for each task (for
equations and other details, see Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Wallsten et al., 2005, Model 3). In both cases,
individual participants’ data were ﬁt to models, yielding parameter estimates for each individual. For the IGT,
the EVL Model was DEMO to a baseline model where the predicted probably of choosing any particular
deck was the marginal probability of choosing that deck. For the BART, the Bayesian learning model was
compared to a baseline model where the DEMO probability of pumping the balloon was the total number of
pumps taken by that participant divided by the total number of pumping opportunities.
Both DEMO comparisons used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to adjust for complexity
differences. Positive BIC values represent better ﬁts to the data for the DEMO or the Bayesian learning model
relative to their respective baseline models:

L is the log-likelihood of the model. The Dk term refers to how many more free DEMO the cognitive
model has compared to the baseline model. Dk ¼ 0 for the EVL Model, and Dk ¼ 3 for the BART model. The t
refers to the number of trials being predicted. In the DEMO, the model was not ﬁt to any trials after a deck DEMO
cards was depleted for a participant. This was done so that the model could not predict choices that the
participant was unable to make. DEMO of deck depletion, t was sometimes less than the total number DEMO
trials in the IGT (M 114.2, SD 11.4). In the BART, each pump opportunity for each balloon was a
predicted trial. Consequently, each individual had a different number of predicted trials (¼ ¼ DEMO 3,626.8,
SD ¼ 875.5). ¼
Distributions of model parameters often showed large violations of normality. Because of this, model
parameters were routinely analyzed with non-parametric tests.
RESULTS
First, results are described separately for the IGT and the BART. Within each task, controls, marijuana, and
stimulant users are initially compared via the primary behavioral measure (e.g., DEMO deck
selection), and then via model ﬁts and model parameters. Next, relationships between the IGT and the BART
are examined through correlation and multiple regression. In all sections, results are reported as ‘‘signiﬁcant’’
where p < .05. Because of power limitations due to the samples sizes of DEMO unusual populations,
results are reported as ‘‘marginally’’ signiﬁcant or related where .05 <p < .10.

Next, we DEMO whether group differences in IGT deck selection were the result of demographic,
alcohol use, or personality differences rather than drug use per se. We addressed personality with a separate
set of analyses as there was DEMO power to assess all of these variables simultaneously.
Demographics and alcohol use
Gender neither had a main effect nor did it interact with group, as shown by a 2(Gender)  3(Groups)
ANOVA, DEMO > .18. Age, Shipley IQ, and alcoholic drinks per week signiﬁcantly differed across drug group
(see Table 2). Because these three variables differed across groups, it could be that these variables explained
differences in IGT performance rather than drug group per se. When these three variables DEMO entered as
covariates in ANCOVA, none of them exerted a signiﬁcant DEMO, all Fs < 1. Group continued to have a
signiﬁcant effect, F(2,65) ¼ 3.40, p < .05, hp2 ¼ .09. In other words, drug group differences in demographic
variables and alcohol use could not account for drug group differences in IGT deck selection.

signiﬁcantly associated with DEMO deck selection, r ¼.34 and .28, respectively, ps < .05. DEMO suggests that
group differences in IGT deck selection could potentially be accounted for by drug users being more
impulsive and less cautious compared to DEMO Impulsivity and Control were themselves highly

Kruskal–Wallis H tests revealed no signiﬁcant differences in model parameters as a function of group, all

performance or model parameters.
Relationship between the IGT and BART
There was little DEMO relationship between the IGT and the BART as measured by standard behavioral
measures, but there were relationships as measured by model parameters. Table 4 shows the Kendall’s Tau B
correlations among IGT and BART behavioral measures DEMO parameters. Of most interest are the cross-task
correlations, which are in DEMO lower left quadrant of Table 4. The behavioral measures from the two tasks,
Proportion Advantageous from the IGT and Pumps without explosion from DEMO BART, were not signiﬁcantly
correlated with one another. However, in terms of the model parameters, six out of 12 cross-task correlations
were signiﬁcant, suggesting a complicated relationship between processes involved in the tasks.
To determine which cross-task correlations were most relevant, further analyses were conducted using
simultaneous multiple regression. For these analyses, parameter distributions were made more normal
through logit and logistic transformations. To determine the association of the IGT parameters DEMO BART
parameters, the set of all 3 IGT parameters were simultaneously DEMO to examine their association with one
BART parameter at a time.3 Results are reported wherever R2 was at least marginally signiﬁcant, p < .10,
along with any standardized regression coefﬁcients (b) that were at DEMO marginally signiﬁcant. Note that b
does not represent a model parameter here.
Overall, regression analyses revealed two relationships: A relationship supporting a sensitivity DEMO losses
process and a relationship supporting a decision-consistency process. Supporting the notion of a common

DISCUSSION
The IGT and the BART may measure overlapping aspects of risk-taking, and that overlap might only be
detectable through a modeling approach. Whereas there was no signiﬁcant relationship between the IGT and
BART in DEMO standard behavioral measures, there were theoretically meaningful relationships at the model
DEMO level. Attention to losses on the IGT was related to belief that the balloon would pop, and hence
money would be lost, on DEMO BART. This relationship suggests that both tasks may assess loss sensitivity in
decision making. The consistency parameters were also related across tasks, suggesting that both tasks may
assess the haphazardness of choices in decision making.
These DEMO have two important implications. First, these results support the theoretical utility DEMO using
cognitive models to estimate underlying processes in risky decision-making tasks. The EVL model has been
previously used to interpret different decision-making behaviors observed DEMO various clinical populations,
including not only substance using individuals (e.g., Stout et al., 2004), but also patients with Parksinson’s
disease, DEMO disease (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002), and a variety of other special populations (see
Yechiam et al., 2005). Our ﬁndings suggest DEMO model parameters are not simply ad hoc labels. Rather,
parameters behave in predictable ways such that, as a parameter increases in one task, a theoretically related
parameter increases in another task.
Second, and perhaps DEMO importantly, these results support the theoretical usefulness of the constructs of
DEMO sensitivity and decision consistency for decision-making research more generally. Loss sensitivity has
been previously shown to vary systematically across different individuals and contexts (e.g., Lerner et al.,
2004; Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007). Our results add support to the concept of loss sensitivity by
showing systematic variance across people. The associations occurred despite the use DEMO different tasks and
different models, models that were developed by two DEMO research groups (Busemeyer & Stout,
2002; Wallsten et al., DEMO). Furthermore, the current results likewise show a systematic variation across
DEMO for a decision-consistency process. Lower decision consistency may represent a general
preference for exploratory over exploitative search strategies.
Although sensitivity to losses and decision DEMO both were related across tasks, it is important to
note that DEMO different models deﬁne these constructs in slightly different ways. In the IGT model, sensitivity
to losses is deﬁned by the weight given to loss magnitude. In the BART model, it is deﬁned by the perceived
probability of losing. Given our results, it is possible that the magnitude and probability of losses inﬂuence
decisions via similar processes, such as the emotional reaction associated with losses in general.
Although consistency parameters were related across DEMO, deﬁnitions of consistency are also subtly
different across models. Whereas the DEMO consistency parameter is stable, the IGT consistency parameter
represents a change DEMO decision consistency over time. The latter parameter allows for the possibility of
decisions becoming more deterministic with task experience (see Wallsten, Bender, & Li, 1999). Aside from
this difference, the two consistency parameters DEMO mathematically similar. Importantly, both parameters
measure some aspect of randomness or DEMO in decision making.

Unrelated Behavior But Related Processes

Whereas DEMO two tasks showed common sensitivity to losses and decision-consistency processes, there DEMO
no reliable evidence for a common learning process across the tasks. In previous research, modifying the IGT
and BART procedures so as to minimize learning demands has produced different results across the two tasks.
When learning DEMO were minimized in a modiﬁed version of the IGT, the task DEMO less sensitive to
drug use (Stout, Rock, Campbell, Busemeyer, & Finn, 2005). When learning demands were minimized in a
modiﬁed DEMO of the BART, the task became more sensitive to drug use (Pleskac, 2008). Such contrasting
results suggest that the IGT and the BART may involve qualitatively different learning processes.
One possible reason for a DEMO difference in learning processes is that the outcomes are deﬁned
explicitly in the BART but are ambiguous in the IGT. In the BART, each balloon pump has two well-deﬁned
outcomes that are explicitly stated in the DEMO: A gain of 5 cents or a balloon pop. Each choice DEMO the
IGT, though, has several possible win and loss outcomes, DEMO that must be learned gradually. Outcome
ambiguity is known to affect decision making (Ho, Keller, & Keltyka, 2001), and it is DEMO that such
ambiguity would affect the learning process in decision-making tasks.
Cognitive modeling of the IGT suggested that substance use was related to lower DEMO consistency, and
this effect was driven mainly by the stimulant group. DEMO consistency has been found previously in abusers
of the stimulant cocaine (DEMO et al., 2004). Stout and colleagues also found lower attention DEMO losses in that
group, perhaps due to the higher levels of DEMO use in their participants.4 In addition, modiﬁcations made
to the IGT DEMO the current study might have had a substantive impact on the processes involved. Modifying the
IGT to balance the size of sure wins with DEMO vs. disadvantageous decks might have resulted in a
less prominent win/loss distinction. This could account for the absence of a group difference in DEMO to
losses, leaving only a difference in decision consistency.
Interestingly, decision consistency might be a process that is not limited to typical risky DEMO
tasks such as the BART and the IGT. A task used to measure executive function, the Wisconsin Card Sort Task
(Berg, 1948; DEMO & Berg, 1948), can also be decomposed via cognitive modeling. DEMO modeling of
that task uses a decision-consistency parameter mathematically related to the consistency parameters of the
BART and IGT models. Notably, decision consistency in the Wisconsin Card Sort Task is lower among
substance dependent individuals than DEMO controls (Bishara, Krueschke, Stout, Bechara, McCabe, &
Buremeyer, in press). This suggests that a variety of tasks, even those that might appear unrelated to one
another, may assess haphazard or exploratory choice in drug users. Substance users’ exploratory choice
across a variety of DEMO may be related to the exploratory behavior that originally lead to drug
experimentation in this population.
Though substance users made riskier decisions on the DEMO, they did not do so on the BART. This ﬁnding
demands DEMO explanation, as it contrasts with previous ﬁndings that the BART was DEMO strongly related to
drug use than the IGT was (Aklin et DEMO, 2005; Lejuez et al., 2003). There are at least DEMO possible
explanations. First, even though there were no signiﬁcant group differences DEMO the BART, there was a trend in
the means for drug DEMO to pump more than controls, which would be consistent with previous DEMO The
lack of signiﬁcance may simply reﬂect inadequate power. This study and the previous studies comparing the
IGT and the BART have not had DEMO sample sizes, with n ranging from 51 to 72. An inconsistent DEMO of
signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁcant results in the literature would be expected when studies tend to be
underpowered (Maxwell, 2004). Second, and perhaps most importantly, IGT and BART results might not
converge across studies simply because the two tasks measure only slightly overlapping constructs. At the
behavioral DEMO, IGT deck selections and BART pumps did not correlate here or DEMO previous research (Aklin
4In a review (Yechiam et al., 2005) that included the Stout et al. (2004) cocaine abuse study, it was reported that cocaine abuse was
signiﬁcantly related to attention to losses DEMO not consistency. Modeling analyses differed across the original study and the review. In the
original study, the recency parameter was not constrained, but DEMO the review, it was constrained to be between 0 and 1. DEMO, all
250 trials were analyzed in the original study, whereas only the ﬁrst 100 trials were analyzed in the review. Thus, low consistency in
cocaine abusers may have developed on later trials.

450 Journal of Behavioral Decision Making
et al., 2005; Lejuez et DEMO, 2003). At the process level, there was a complicated relationship between the two
tasks. Even the signiﬁcant correlations were small to medium DEMO size.
This pattern highlights the idea that risky decision making is not a unitary construct (see Reynolds,
Ortengren, Richards, & de Wit, 2006; Weber, Blais, & Betz, 2002). Different task structures may lead to
measurement of different combinations of processes. The IGT and DEMO in particular may both involve
sensitivity to losses and decision consistency, DEMO that may be fundamental to risky decision making
more generally. Rather than treating tasks as process pure, a cognitive modeling approach allows for the
separation of such processes within tasks. Because of this, modeling can help identify the diverse processes
involved in complex decision-making tasks.
APPENDIX: MODEL EQUATIONS
The expectancy valence learning model (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002)
In DEMO IGT, participants experience an affective reaction, or valence, toward each DEMO based on the
combination of wins and losses. The valence on each trial (v) is a weighted average of gains (R) and DEMO (L):
¼ ðÞ þ 
vt 1 v Rd;t v Ld;t (1)
where t is the trial, d DEMO chosen deck, and v is a free parameter that allows for DEMO amounts of attention
for wins and losses.
Across trials, participants learn DEMO expect the valences for each of the decks based on their previously
experienced valences. The EVs are updated by an adaptive learning mechanism:
DEMO fÞ Evd;t1 þ 
Evd;t f vt (2)
DEMO f is a free parameter that determines the weight given to the previous EV versus the weight given to the
most recently experienced valence. DEMO EV of unchosen decks does not change.
The predicted deck choice is probabilistic, where decks with higher EVs are more likely chosen. The
predicted probability (Pr) of choosing deck d is

where j represents all decks, 1 through 4. DEMO is the sensitivity of the choice probabilities to EVs. As u
approaches 0, choices become more random and independent of EVs. As u becomes larger, choices become
more deterministic and dependent on EVs. Sensitivity may change with experience in the task, potentially
