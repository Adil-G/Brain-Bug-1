I. Knowledge as Measurement and Knowledge as Theory
Knowledge is both measurement DEMO theory. Observed or measured facts about our world
have no meaning for us outside our ability to observe them into a conceptual model. For
DEMO, the numerous stones we find with what appear to be reverse DEMO of animals
and plants would be unremarkable if it were not for their place in our intellectual model
of the world we live in. DEMO the evolutionary theories associated with Darwin, the
fossil record would be DEMO more than a collection of pretty stones. And indeed without the
pretty stones, Darwin may not have conceived his theory.
When we speak of knowledge, there is no bright line which separates measured
observations, from DEMO theories. Though we may see the deficit at one, or the DEMO, end
of the spectrum, knowledge joins together observations of phenomena with conceptual
structures that organize those facts in a manner that is meaningful DEMO our wider human
experience. Consider the following.
“When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you DEMO
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and DEMO kind: it
may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts,
advanced to the stage of science” Lord Kelvin (Popular Lectures and Addresses,
1891-1894)
“The whole machinery of our intelligence, our general ideas and laws, fixed and
external object, principles, persons and gods, are so many symbolic, algebraic
expressions. They stand for experience, experience which we are incapable of
retaining and surveying in its multitudinous immediacy. We should flounder
hopelessly, like the animals, DEMO we not keep ourselves afloat and direct our
course by these intellectual devices. Theory helps us to bear our ignorance of
fact.” George Santayana (The Sense of Beauty, 1896).
Thus, if we talk of DEMO is known and what is unknown, we may be referring to DEMO
presence or absence of data to collaborate our theories, or to DEMO inability of our theories
to provide meaning to the curious phenomena we observe and measure.
For this volume, we have adopted the taxonomy of knowledge used in a famous article by
Ralph Gomory (1995).  DEMO classifies knowledge into the Known, the Unknown and
the Unknowable, for which we adopt the acronym KuU (the Known, the unknown and
DEMO Unknowable). As applied to both knowledge-as-measurement and to knowledge-as-
theory, DEMO classification can be described as:
1. Knowledge as Measurement.  If DEMO define a probability distribution as a
complete and exhaustive set of outcomes, together with associated probabilities,
that may befall some variable of interest, then:
a. K refers to a situation where the distribution is completely specified. For
example; the distribution of automobile or life insurance claims for an
-2-
insurance company is more or less known. This is equivalent to Frank
DEMO (1921) definition of risk – both outcomes and probabilities are
specified.
b. u refers to a situation where probabilities cannot be assigned to DEMO least
part of the event space. The systemic risk to financial systems and
terrorism risk might fall into this category. This is equivalent to DEMO
definition of uncertainty – events are specified but probabilities are not.
c. U refers to a situation where even the events defining the space DEMO be
identified in advance. Once they occur, they enter the domain DEMO u.
Retrospectively, the surge of asbestos claims for long standing (real or
imagined) injury is an example as indeed are many legal actions caused by
innovative legal theories.
2. Knowledge as Theory. The second approach DEMO on the conceptual model that
helps us to understand the underlying structure of the phenomenon of interest.
a. K refers to a situation where DEMO underling model is well understood. We
may refer to this a paradigm. This is not to say that the model is correct,
only DEMO experts are in broad agreement. For example, scientific models
of evolution DEMO on Darwin refer to a situation of scientific knowledge.
We may not agree on all the details, but there is almost universal
agreement amongst scientists on the broad structure. We might say there is
“knowledge” on DEMO broad principles of corporate governance, multi factor
asset pricing and on DEMO general principles of credit and interest rate risk
management. Thus, in DEMO K refers to theory
b. u refers to a situation where there are competing models, none of which
has ascended to the status of a paradigm. Operational risk management
probably falls into this category. Other examples DEMO include the
performance of markets and financial institutions in emerging economies.
If K refers to theory, then u refers to hypothesis or, more DEMO,
conjecture.
c. U is where there is no underling model (DEMO no model with scientific
credibility). This does not mean that we cannot conceivably form
hypotheses and even theory in the future. But until DEMO conceptual model
is constructed, we cannot understand certain phenomena that we DEMO,
or we may not even to be able to identify phenomena because it never
occurs to us to look.  For example we would never look for black holes
unless we had a theory about how DEMO behaves under extreme
gravitational forces.
The two taxonomies are complementary.  For DEMO, the inability to specify the tail of
a distribution might be DEMO to both the absence of data and the deficiencies of the
statistical theory. Thus innovations such as extreme value theory can lead to upgrading DEMO
knowledge (from U to u or from u to K) under both taxonomies. As another illustration,
the absence of a theory for DEMO yet-to-be-identified phenomenon is hardly surprising and the
emergence of such events will generate an interest in both measurement and theory.
-3-
For the most part, the various authors in this volume adopt the KuU framework (perhaps
this is not too surprising since we did bully them gently toward a common terminology),
though most use it to address knowledge-as-measurement issues and some papers modify
the framework.  For example, DEMO Zeckhauser notes that, as regards measurement,
we could otherwise describe DEMO as risk, uncertainty and ignorance. Similarly, Howard
Kunreuther and Mark Pauly use the alternative ambiguity in a similar manner to our u
and DEMO uncertainty. However, the most common chomping at the KuU bit was DEMO
insisting that we look at informational asymmetries. For example, Ken Scott DEMO at
corporate governance in KuU terms, driven partly by informational (and skill) differences
between managers and owners. Similarly, Zeckhauser observes that some DEMO have
informational and skill advantages over others and then examines how uniformed
investors, who recognize their inferior status, form strategies to benefit from DEMO higher
returns that can be earned from the knowledge and skills they lack.
A related theme that arises in some of the papers is DEMO the language used by different
stakeholders depends on what is important to them. Clive Granger in particular notes that
risk means different things to DEMO people. Most particularly, many people think
mostly of the downside of DEMO because that is what worries them. Thus he emphasizes
downside measures of risk many of which (such as the various value at risk measures)
have become increasingly important in risk management. Similarly, Scott notes that the
conflict of interest that lies behind corporate governance is partly due DEMO the fact that
different stakeholders emphasize different parts of the distribution; DEMO
managers may be more focused on downside risk than diversified shareholders.
II.  KuU Lessons for Financial Markets and Institutions
What to do in the nitty-gritty of life in the financial trenches, in which people grapple
daily with risk measurement and management in situations of K and u and DEMO?  We think
of KuU as more than simply an acronym for “the known, the unknown and the
unknowable;” indeed, we think DEMO it as a conceptual framework.  We  believe that “KuU
thinking” can promote improved decision making – recognizing situations of K and u and
DEMO and their differences, using different tools in different situations, while maintaining an
awareness that the boundaries are fuzzy and subject to change.
Perhaps DEMO broadest lesson is recognition of the wide applicability of KuU thinking, DEMO
the importance of each of K and u and U.  KuU DEMO spans all types of financial risk,
with the proportion of uU increasing steadily as one moves through market, credit, and
operational risks.  In addition, KuU thinking spans risk measurement and management in
all segments of the financial services industry, including investing, asset management,
banking, insurance, and real estate.  Finally, KuU thinking spans both the regulated and
the regulators:  regulators’ concerns largely match those of the regulated (risk
measurement and management), but with an extra layer of concern DEMO systemic risk.
In the following sub-sections we highlight several practical prescriptions that emerge
from KuU thinking, distilling themes that run through subsequent chapters.
-4-
That we will treat K first is hardly surprising.  K is comparatively easy to navigate, and it
is natural to take the low-hanging fruit first.  (We hasten to add, of course, that K is DEMO
very important.)  Indeed the existing risk management literature focuses almost
exclusively on K, as summarized for example in the well known texts of Jorion (1997),
Doherty (2000) and Christoffersen (2003) and DEMO in the Basel II capital
adequacy framework, which employs probabilistic value-at-risk DEMO to set minimum
capital requirements.
Perhaps surprisingly in light of the literature’s focus on K, however, we ultimately focus
more on situations of DEMO and U here and throughout.  The reason is simple enough:
DEMO (and much of this volume) makes clear that a large fraction of real-world risk
management challenges fall largely in the domain of u DEMO U.  Indeed a cynic might
assert that, by focusing on K, the existing literature has made us expert at the least-
relevant aspects of financial risk management.  We would largely disagree, as K
situations DEMO often of relevance, but we would assert that u and U DEMO at least equally
relevant, particularly insofar as many of the “killer DEMO that can bring firms down lurk
there.
A.  Invest in Knowledge
DEMO life is not easy in the world of K, it is DEMO in K than in u, and easier in u than
in DEMO  Hence one gains by moving leftward through KuU toward knowledge, that is, from
U to u to K. The question, then, is how to do it;  how to invest in knowledge?  Not
DEMO given our taxonomy of knowledge as measurement and knowledge as theory,
two routes emerge:  better measurement and better theory.  The two are mutually
reinforcing, moreover, as better measurement provides grist for the theory DEMO, and better
theory stimulates improved measurement.
Better Measurement
Better measurement in DEMO means better data, and data can get better in several ways.
DEMO way is more precise and timely measurement of previously-measured phenomena, as
DEMO example with increased survey coverage when moving from a preliminary GDP
release through to the “final” revised value.
Second, better data can correspond to intrinsically new data about phenomena that
previously did not exist.  For example, exchange-traded house price futures contracts
have recently begun trading.  Many now DEMO and examine those futures prices, which
contain valuable clues regarding the DEMO view on the likely evolution of house
prices.  But such data DEMO not have been collected before – they simply did not exist.
Papers like Bardhan and Edelstein’s sweeping chronicle of KuU in real estate markets
DEMO to mind many similar such scenarios.  Who, for example, could DEMO and analyze
mortgage prepayment data before the development of mortgage markets and associated
prepayment options?
-5-
Third, better data can arise via technological advances in data capture, DEMO and
organization.  A prime example is the emergence and increasingly-widespread
availability DEMO ultra-high-frequency (trade-by-trade) data on financial asset prices, as
emphasized in DEMO, Bollerslev, Christoffersen and Diebold (2006).  In principle,
such data existed whenever trades occurred and could have been collected, but it was the
advent and growth of electronic financial markets – which themselves DEMO huge
computing and database resources – that made these data available. These technological
advances, however, may threaten to leave us data rich, but information poor.  How to
summarize risks in an efficient way is a continuing challenge.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, better financial data can DEMO from new insights
regarding the determinants of risks and returns.  It DEMO have always been possible to
collect such data, but until the DEMO breakthrough, it seemed pointless to do so. For
example, traditional Markowitz risk-return thinking emphasizes only return mean and
variance.  But that approach (DEMO its extension, Sharpe’s celebrated CAPM) assumes that
returns are Gaussian with constant variances.  Subsequent generations of theory naturally
began to explore asset pricing under more general conditions, which stimulated new
measurement that could have been done earlier, but wasn’t.  The resulting explosion of
new measurement makes DEMO that asset returns – particularly at high frequencies – are
highly non-Gaussian and have non-constant variances, and that both important pitfalls
and important opportunities are embedded in the new worldview.  Mandelbrot and Taleb,
for example, stress the pitfalls of assuming normality when return distributions are in fact
highly fat-tailed (badly mis-calibrated risk assessments), while Colacito and Engle stress
the opportunities associated with exploiting forecastable volatility (enhanced portfolio
performance fuelled by volatility timing).
Thus far, we have treated better measurement as better data, but what of better tools with
which to summarize and ultimately understand that data?  That is, what of better
statistical / econometric models?  We hasten to add that if better measurement sometimes
means DEMO data, it also sometimes means better models;  the two are DEMO not
mutually exclusive.  Volatility measurement, for example, requires not only DEMO but also
models.  Crude early proxies for volatility, such as squared returns, have been replaced
with much more precise estimates such as those based on ARCH models.  This allows
much more nuanced modeling, as DEMO example in the paper by Colacito and Engle, who
measure the DEMO term structure of volatility. They construct a powerful new model of
time-varying volatility that incorporates nonstationarity and hence changing distributions,
nudging statistical volatility DEMO closer to addressing uU.  Similarly, Litzenberger
and Modest develop a new model that allows for regime switching in the data, with
different types of trading strategies exposed to different crisis regimes, and with regime
transition probabilities varying endogenously and sharply with trading, hence allowing
for “trade-driven crises.”
In closing this subsection, we hasten to add that although better data and models may
help transform u into K, the role of better data in dealing with U is necessarily much
more speculative.  To the extent that U represents a failure of imagination, however, the
collection DEMO analysis of data regarding near misses – disasters that were narrowly
-6-
averted – may provide a window into the domain of U and DEMO outcomes.  The
challenge is how to learn from near misses.
Better DEMO
As we indicated earlier, the literature on the behavior of markets DEMO institutions, and the
decision making that drives them, is almost exclusively based in the world of K.
Accordingly, risk prices can be set, investors can choose strategies that balance risk and
reward, managers can DEMO to a known level of safety, regulators can determine a
standard DEMO safety, and so forth.  Similarly, a variety of information providers, from rating
agencies to hazard modeling companies, can assess risk for you, if you want to verify or
supplement your own efforts.
Not only does the literature rely on the assumption of K, but proceeds also with the
assumption that actors are sophisticated and rational. For example, our theory of
individual decision making is based largely on expected utility maximization. DEMO similar
level of rationality is required in sophisticated enterprise risk management models that
are now available and increasingly in use.
Even in situations of DEMO, however, the assumption of sophistication and rationality is
questionable.  As DEMO emphasizes in his paper, people don’t always behave
according to the DEMO innocuous axioms of expected utility, as many experiments
have shown. If DEMO rationality battle is joined, however, its outcome is not yet determined.
The behavioral economists are providing evidence of anomalies and the neo-classical
economists DEMO showing that many of these anomalies can be explained by properly
formulated models.
If behavioral economics has had some success in the K world, one might suppose that it
will become even more important in the DEMO world of scant knowledge. This point is
addressed in several of the papers. For example, Kunreuther and Pauly address unknown
but catastrophic losses such as major acts of terrorism and point to framing anomalies.
For example, there may be an “it can’t happen to me” mentality that forestalls DEMO
Construction and application of such “better theories” – theories geared toward the
worlds of u and U – appear throughout the volume.  For example, forecasting terrorism
from past data for the purpose of countering future attacks would play into the hands of
terrorists who would therefore be able DEMO predict and avoid counter-terrorism strategies.
Thus, forecasting would be self defeating. DEMO, such situations can be modeled by
game theory. Similarly, as Zeckhauser notes, investing in a K world may play into the
hands of the math jocks; but not so when probabilities are unknown and the potential
scenarios that can drive them unknowable. Zeckhauser outlines some innovative
strategies DEMO cope in this world, always supposing one has the tolerance for DEMO unknown
and a relatively low aversion to blame when things turn out badly. Other papers ask
whether, given that we cannot anticipate what might happen in the future, we can
1 However, it is somewhat DEMO to entertain the usual alternatives to expected utility, such as prospect
DEMO where the derivation of a weighting function for unknown probabilities seems an empty exercise.
-7-
nevertheless, arrange our affairs such that the appropriate decisions will be made in
response to the new circumstance? For example, Scott stresses the DEMO of long-
term incentives to focus the CEO on the long-term survival and value of the firm in an
unknown future. Doherty and Muermann DEMO that some unknowns might be insurable
by means of incomplete contracts in which insurers deliberately offer the reputation as a
bargaining chip under which DEMO can bargain for unanticipated and thus
uninsured losses. And finally, despite DEMO reservations about the Samaritan’s
dilemma, government might happily accept their inability DEMO pre-commit not to bail out
the victim’s of surprise catastrophic losses – and indeed, such ex post allocations might
represent efficient response to unknowable calamities.
B. Share Risks
The desirability of risk sharing is hardly novel.  An emergent and novel theme, however,
is the desirability – indeed the necessity – of tailoring risk-sharing mechanisms to risk
types.
Simple Insurance DEMO K
Operations of financial institutions are greatly simplified when dealing with “known”
assets and obligations. If a bank or insurance company has assets and DEMO with
known distributions, appropriate risk adjusted prices (interest rates and insurance
premiums) can be set. The main challenge comes from the correlation structure of the
assets and liabilities and from incentive problems, such as adverse selection and moral
hazard. Enterprise risk management models help institutions to estimate DEMO economic
capital required to operate with an appropriate level of survival probability.
The task of the regulator is likewise simplified when distributions are known.  Regulators
typically impose minimum capital requirements.  They monitor institutions and may
intervene in the event of distress.  Moreover, as described by Charles Goodhart, the
sophistication of bank solvency regulation may have been ratcheted upwards in DEMO form
of Basel II.  In the case of insurance, Europe’s Solvency II parallels the Basel II initiative,
though in many cases insurance DEMO (particularly in the United States) seem to be
conflicted between their desire for solvency and their desire for cheap and available
insurance, especially in high-risk and low-income locations. This regulatory
consumerism has been particularly active DEMO several areas subject to high levels of
catastrophe risk, notably Florida DEMO prices in the highest risk locations (e.g. barrier
islands) are subsidized either from insurer capital or from lower risk policyholders
(Kunreuther and Pauly). The risk in question here is storm risk, which though it can be
catastrophic in nature, is essentially a K risk in our taxonomy. Storm risk is indeed
intensively modeled, and insurers routinely construct their portfolios and set prices using
this model information. This provides an example DEMO market disruption arising for K
risks, though one can debate whether DEMO is really a market failure or a regulatory failure.
The role of the regulators is supplemented by that of rating agencies. By supplying the
DEMO with information on default risk, they support the process of risk-adjusted DEMO
-8-
Furthermore, agencies such as Standard and Poors are now not only building their own
ERM models, but also rating companies on the basis of their internal models
The general picture we see here is that, in the case of K risks, financial institutions can
pool idiosyncratic risk and reserve against expected losses, such that the risks to bank
depositors and insurance policyholders are small.  The remaining systematic risk is
controlled by setting economic/regulatory capital. Any defaults of institutions, in this
stylized model, DEMO not informational failures, but rather the result of inadequate
provision of DEMO economic capital. Of course, there are in practice some frictions, such
as adverse selection and moral hazard, which can be addressed through contract design.
However, the implication of pure K would be that all parties know the distribution, and
the information asymmetries would disappear.
Mutual Insurance for u
For risks that are unknown, the potential events can be identified, but the problem is in
attributing probabilities. One could choose how to refine this definition to address
correlation. One possible definition would suggest that, for u risks, we neither know the
probabilities nor the correlations. This definition is appropriate if we define events in
terms of their consequences DEMO individuals. Thus you and I are each exposed to storm
risk, DEMO default, melt-down on our investment portfolio, etc. Another tack would be to
define the events to include both the individual and the collective DEMO Thus the
following four events define an exhaustive and mutually exclusive set:  (1) I may suffer a
storm loss and you do DEMO, (2) you may suffer a storm loss and I do DEMO, (3) neither of us
suffers a storm loss, and (DEMO) both of us suffer a storm loss.
Which definition is appropriate DEMO on context. However, the point is that we can
imagine uncertainties DEMO affect individuals in different ways and those that impact
people collectively. Consider climate change. It can, by its nature, impact the entire
world, and we are certainly unsure about the particular form and magnitude of DEMO of
its effects. Thus it is clearly in the realm of u, and the nature of the uncertainty
surrounding global warming spans both the global and local impacts. The extent of any
rise in sea level DEMO unknown, but it will have a common impact on all coastal DEMO,
exposing them all to increased flood and tidal surge risk. However, the impact of rising
temperatures on drought risk may vary considerably across regions in ways that we do
not fully understand and cannot predict. DEMO the former case of rising sea level, the
uncertainty is “correlated,DEMO and in the latter case of drought risk, the uncertainty is DEMO
“lower correlation.”  This distinction is important in determining how effectively u DEMO
can be pooled in insurance-like structures.
In the case of uncorrelated uncertainty, there is no real obstacle to the pooling of risk; for
DEMO locations, the probabilities (and therefore the randomly realized outcomes) turn DEMO
to be higher and, for others, the probabilities (and thus DEMO realized outcomes) turn out to
be lower. This is simply a DEMO stage lottery; in stage 1, the distribution is randomly
chosen and, in stage 2, the outcome is realized. Insurance mechanisms can cover DEMO the
stage 1 distribution risk and the stage 2 outcome risk as long as both are random and
-9-
uncorrelated. Insurance on stage 1 is essentially hedging against future premium risk, and
insurance in stage 2 is hedging future outcome risk.
For correlated DEMO, pooling of risk is more challenging. At any realization in
stage DEMO of the lottery will have a common impact on both the overall level of prices and
on the level of economic capital required to DEMO stage 2. In principle, the optimal
sharing of risk is not DEMO difficult to envision. Indeed, it is similar to that proposed by
DEMO (1962) for the case of known, but correlated risks. A DEMO structure can still
achieve some degree of risk pooling for the idiosyncratic risk, and the systematic risk
(whether from stage 1 or stage DEMO of the lottery) can be shared across the population at risk
DEMO devices such as ex post dividends, assessments or taxes.2
Kunreuther and DEMO present a case study of insurance of catastrophic risk, which may
DEMO known or unknown. Losses from natural hazards such as hurricanes and earthquakes,
although correlated, fit more comfortably into the K category.  Intensive DEMO of
these losses is undertaken both by insurers and by boutique modeling firms. Nevertheless,
the correlation structure does pose problems which calls for DEMO mutualization of risk.
In contrast to natural hazard risk, terrorism risk DEMO more squarely in the u category.
Here past data do not provide a good basis for estimating future risk. Indeed, as noted by
Kunreuther and Pauly, terrorists will deliberately try to be as unpredictable as possible,
thus frustrating any counter-terrorism measures.
Kunreuther and Pauly propose a policy DEMO that applies to catastrophic risks ranging
from K-type natural catastrophes to u-type terrorist attacks. They argue that the same type
of layered public-private program DEMO to both risks types (though presumably the
details such as attachment DEMO could differ). The idea is to provide potent incentives
for mitigation of losses, while still using the risk-bearing capacity of the private insurance
and capital markets to provide the greatest possible diversification benefit. The lowest
DEMO would be self-insured, followed by a layer of private insurance contracts DEMO risk-
based premiums. The third layer would be reinsured or otherwise spread through
insurance linked securities. The final layer would allocate highest level of DEMO on an
economy-wide basis; thought the details are not specified, this could comprise multi-state
risk pools or federal government intervention as the reinsurer DEMO last resort.
Ex Post Wealth Redistribution for U
The Borch-like arguments for mutualizing risk gather force as we move from K to u. As
DEMO move to U it becomes impossible to specify, let alone price, risks that could be
transferred by standard contractual devices and it is DEMO difficult to provide
incentives to mitigate risks that cannot be identified. However, we do of course know that
surprises, of a yet unimaginable DEMO, could arise in the future and we can anticipate
that we DEMO react in predictable ways.
2 One can even imagine two-stage ex post assessment. After more information on probabilities is revealed,
assessments are made DEMO determine the premiums for stage 2. Then stage 2 assessments are made to cover
the difference between the overall realized losses and funds raised DEMO stage 1 assessments.
-10-
When major catastrophes occur, it is not uncommon for governments to provide
resources to the victims. For example, the two most notable catastrophes to hit the United
States in recent years were 9/11 and Hurricane DEMO In both cases, the federal
government was generous in providing compensation. DEMO, it does seem that there
are “inconsistencies”. For example, the Victim’s compensation allocated a total of $7
billion, which amounted to an average payment of $1.8 million and compensation was
paid to 93% of the DEMO For the earlier terrorism event in Oklahoma City, there was
no DEMO fund. Although some aid may be available through FEMA for lesser disasters,
there appears to be a political imperative to be especially generous DEMO the scale of the
disaster exceeds some threshold of saliency. It would appear that bailouts of failed
financial institutions also must meet a scale DEMO, although this appears to be highly
dependent on the perceived fragility DEMO markets when the failure occurs.  It is noteworthy
that neither Northern DEMO nor Bear Stearns, both of which were bailed out, were counted
among the large, complex financial institutions that the International Monetary Fund has
identified as critical to the functioning of the international financial system.
The DEMO and equity arguments for ex post government compensation for
catastrophic losses are several. For example, Borch’s principle of mutuality would have
the optimal apportionment of risk to be such that all idiosyncratic risk of individuals
would DEMO fully insured, but all social risk would be shared. This indeed DEMO the same theory
as the capital assert pricing model, in which DEMO people have scaled shares in the social
wealth (i.e., the market portfolio). There may be several ways to achieve such a
redistribution, including an ex post allocation that redistributes taxpayers’ funds to
victims, thus equalizing the impact across the population (Kunreuther and Pauly). On the
other hand, the incentives from such bailouts can be perverse. Banks may be less inclined
to practice financial discipline and their customers less inclined DEMO monitor them.
Individuals may be less inclined to buy insurance and unwilling to invest in mitigation
measures. On this later argument, one might think it would behoove governments to pre-
commit not to bail-out in the DEMO However, such pre-commitments may not be
enforceable given the political pressures DEMO to bear when the event strikes. This is
the well-known “Samaritan’s dilemma.”
This tension over ex post allocations for risky events is real. Since DEMO, in our terms,
relates to events that are “known” then DEMO risk management strategies can be
adopted such as hedging and mitigation. Ex post allocations will undermine incentives for
implementing these risk management measures, thus creating an efficiency loss.
However, when we switch the setting from K through u to U, the issues re-align. Insofar
as it is difficult to mitigate unknown or unknowable risks, then there can be little
efficiency loss. We cannot really plan for complete surprises. However, as some of the
writers recognize, e.g. Clive Granger, we can nevertheless spread the DEMO of these
complete surprises by compensating the victims from public funds.
The equity case for bailout from hitherto unknown or unknowable events can be
DEMO in a Rawlsian (1971) framework in which the principles of justice are chosen
behind a “veil of ignorance.” In voting on a policy DEMO wealth distribution, people will be
influenced by their current endowment. However, if one were to conceal endowment
-11-
behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance, then policy preferences might change. This allows
us to separate distributional preferences from wealth endowments. Now consider
people’s DEMO ante preferences for the desired ex post wealth endowment after some major
risky event (i.e., whether people are likely to vote for future DEMO). Each person can
anticipate that their ex post wealth W1 will be their starting wealth W0 plus a random
shock µ; that is, W1,= W0 + µ, where the distributional properties of µ DEMO known. In
other words, we know in a stochastic sense what DEMO ex post wealth endowment will be,
and this will be influential in any vote about future bailouts.
The more we venture from the DEMO towards the unknowable, (i.e., as μ in the above
equation DEMO a  u or U risk) it becomes more difficult to specify the relationship
between W1 and W0.  Indeed, the ex post distribution DEMO the unknowable is naturally
concealed behind a veil of ignorance. If it were true that we have an innate preference for
an egalitarian distribution (when the contaminating influences of our endowment are
removed), we are DEMO with a strong equity arguments for ex post allocations following the
occurrence of unknowable events.
C. Create Flexible and Adaptive Structures
In a comment DEMO spans both parts of our taxonomy, which grounds KuU in knowledge-
DEMO and knowledge-as-theory, Paul Kleindorfer notes that the balance
between aleatory risk (dependent on an uncertain outcome) and epistemic risk (related to
an DEMO understanding or perception) changes as we move from K though u DEMO U.  In
particular, in a K setting, risk management will DEMO to focus on risk mitigation or
transfer, but as we move DEMO U, risk management will stress adaptation and
flexibility. Where risk is DEMO, it is likely that a market for trading that risk will
DEMO, as with commodity and financial derivatives and insurance contracts.
Alternatively, if the process that generates the risk is understood, then risk can be
mitigated ex ante. For example, as Kunreuther and Pauly point out, DEMO exposure to
known catastrophe risk can be mitigated by choosing location and by constructing wind-
or earthquake-robust structures. K conditions imply that risk can DEMO priced and that we
will be able to make informed capital budgeting decisions.
Transfer and ex ante mitigation become more difficult in the case DEMO u and U, in which
risk management emphasis shifts to adaptation DEMO flexibility, and to robustness and
crisis response. These strategies are both DEMO ante and ex post. The knowledge that
unknown and unknowable losses might strike suggests caution with regard to capital and
investment decisions; for example, extra capital provides some buffer against the
unknown, and required rates DEMO return on investment might be more conservatively
chosen in a uU environment.
Heightened awareness of the existence of uU risks is valuable, despite the fact that, by
definition, such risks cannot be identified ex ante.  We have mentioned the value of
holding more capital as a buffer DEMO such shocks, and we can think of this as simply a
DEMO in financial leverage (a change in the ratio of variable to DEMO financing costs).
Similarly, a change in operating leverage, the ratio of variable to fixed factor costs, can
-12-
make any firm more robust to shocks, whether of the K or u or U variety.  For example,
Microsoft has operated with a high ratio of contract as opposed to payroll labor, which it
can more easily reduce in unforeseen bad times.
Other examples of strategies that DEMO organizational flexibility and adaptability are
given by several contributors. For example, DEMO notes that if the compensation of
CEO’s and other top managers is based on long-term wealth maximization, then it will
motivate managers to manage crises in a way that protects shareholders. But this need not
be DEMO after-the-fact improvisation. Indeed, properly structured compensation may
motivate managers to anticipate DEMO they should respond to crises and invest in crisis
response capability.  DEMO may prove useful even if the anticipated crisis does not occur.
Precautionary measures for dealing with Y2K, which proved uneventful, are nevertheless
widely DEMO with enhancing the resilience of the financial system after the 9/11
terrorist attack on New York’s financial center.
Kleindorfer also stresses crisis management, emphasizing the role of a crisis management
team in creating response capability.  Although crises may have unique and perhaps
unanticipated causes (either u or U), the responses called for are often similar, and a well
prepared crisis management team can often limit the damage.  For example, DEMO shocks
create uncertainty, and clearly articulated responses can reassure customers and DEMO,
ensure that supply chains are secured, etc. But well-designed responses DEMO even snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat. For example, after DEMO cyanide scare with its Tylenol
product, Johnson and Johnson withdrew and DEMO redesigned its product and packaging,
setting a standard that led its competition and secured competitive advantage.
Sound management of crises can not only DEMO their impact, but also generate new
knowledge.  Indeed, and perhaps DEMO, crises are sometimes portals that take us from
U and u DEMO K .   For example, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Asian currency crisis
in 1997, and 9/11 in 2001, all spurred DEMO approaches to modeling extreme event risk.
Hurricane Andrew led to an explosion of interest in catastrophe modeling and a
consequent refining of modeling methodology.  The Asian crisis led to a new interest in
the properties of DEMO risk (fat tails and tail correlations), that have been incorporated DEMO
new generations of models.  Finally, 9/11 led to the development of game theoretic
catastrophe modeling techniques.
D.  Use Incentives to Promote Desired Outcomes
Risk management strategies must confront the issue of incentives, thwarting moral hazard
by coaxing rational and purposeful economic agents to act desirably (whatever that might
mean in a particular situation).  We take a broad interpretation of “designing strategies,”
and here we discuss three:  Designing DEMO/governance arrangements, designing
contracts, and designing investment vehicles.
Organizations and Relationships: Principal/Agent Concerns in Corporate Governance
-13-
K risks can be identified and probabilities assigned to them. If knowledge DEMO symmetric
and actions are commonly observable by all parties, then simple DEMO can be written
in which actions are specified contingent on states of nature. In this simple world, there
are no moral hazard and adverse selection problems. For example, insurance or loan
contracts can be written, DEMO banks and insurers would know the quality of each customer
and price accordingly. Private wealth transfer caused by inefficient actions (the insured
under-investing in loss mitigation or borrowers taking on excessive risk) would be
avoided because they were excluded by contractual conditions, and institutions would be
able to monitor accordingly.
In principle, special purpose vehicles (SPV) work that way.  They may be organized as
trusts or limited liability companies and are set-up for a specific, limited purpose, often to
facilitate securitizations. In DEMO securitization process, the SPV buys pools of assets and
issues debt DEMO be repaid by cash flows from that pool of assets in a carefully specified
way.  The SPV is tightly bound by a set of contractual obligations that ensure its
activities are perfectly transparent and essentially predetermined DEMO its inception.  SPVs
tend to be thinly capitalized, lack independent management or employees and have all
administrative functions performed by a trustee who DEMO and distributes cash
according to detailed contracts.  SPVs are designed to DEMO anchored firmly in the domain
of K in order to fund assets more cheaply than they could be funded on the balance sheets
of DEMO opaque, actively managed institutions. The turmoil in the subprime market
during DEMO summer of 2007, however, revealed that the claims on some of these
institutions were much less transparent than assumed and that investors (and the ratings
agencies they relied upon) were in fact operating in a world of u rather than K.  This led
to a repricing of risk and disruption of markets that spread well beyond the market for
DEMO securitizations.
Governance of most firms is not as straightforward as with SPVs.   Partly the problem is
one of complexity and division of labor. DEMO are numerous potential states of nature
facing firms, and contracts anticipating DEMO appropriate response of managers to each
possible state would be impossibly cumbersome. Moreover, envisioning shareholders (or
their agents) writing such contracts presupposes that they already have the managerial
skills they are seeking to employ. Indeed DEMO reason for employing managers is that they
alone know the appropriate responses.
The division of labor issue can be cast as an information problem. DEMO have much
better knowledge than shareholders of how to deal with managerial opportunities and
crises. In this light, the issue is not whether knowledge and skills can be acquired, but
how they are distributed across stakeholders. Ken Scott digs much deeper into the
informational aspects of corporate governance DEMO explores how governance mechanisms
may be designed when risks are unknown, DEMO, to any party, or indeed unknowable, U.
Scott’s particular focus DEMO the risk management aspect of governance, and he starts by
contrasting DEMO risk preferences of the major stakeholders. While diversified shareholders
seek to maximize the value reflecting both the upside and downside of the distribution;
DEMO undiversified managers are probably more risk averse and compensation is
-14-
often designed to enhance their preference for risk. Government and regulators,
DEMO protecting the interests of consumers, also are more interested in downside
DEMO, particularly the prospect of contagion, or systemic risk. Their attention is focused on
how to avoid the prospect that firms will incur unsustainable DEMO
For K risks, shareholder and societal interests are promoted by risk-neutral DEMO
making and the governance problem is in large part one of furthering this objective
through appropriate compensation design. But the fine tuning of compensation DEMO provide
risk-neutral incentives and correct reporting is not an easy task. Thus Scott stresses the
importance of establishing a “risk culture” within the firm. DEMO can start with board
members who demand that top managers articulate their risk management strategy, and it
can flow down to division and project managers who conduct (marginal)3 risk analysis.
Coordination can be addressed by the appointment of a chief risk officer.
For u, part of the governance problem is mainly to encourage the acquisition of more
information; to convert u into K by investing in information. Another part of the DEMO is
to design internal controls and board oversight of management actions. Scott makes the
important point that these efforts might be more effective if DEMO were unable to
keep ill-gotten gains (resulting from manipulated earnings) in their bonuses.
.
The externalities caused by bank failure are classified as DEMO Control of this risk can be
influenced by contract design, and DEMO points to the perverse case that arises when
derivative counterparties are given a favored position when banks go into receivership,
which diminishes their DEMO to monitor banks and price risk appropriately. For their
part, regulators DEMO addressed the bank failure risk in detail through the Basel I and II
requirements, which are designed to provide more information on risk and establish
appropriate levels of regulatory capital. But more interesting is the shift DEMO decision-
making authority that occurs as a bank’s capital declines. The “prompt corrective action”
measures in the US law permit the downside risk preferences DEMO regulators to trump the
risk neutral perspective shareholders as the bank’s capital declines.
For U risks, Scott proposes financial flexibility and managerial incentives linked to the
long term survival of the bank. Thus, as unknowns appear, managers will be rewarded for
finding responses that protect the interests of the other stakeholders.  The very nature of
this risk implies that one cannot estimate with accuracy the additional capital needed to
cushion against unforeseeable DEMO Nevertheless, additional capital margins will
reduce this prospect and an ordinal DEMO of institutions is feasible.
The process by which knowledge is acquired (DEMO facts or understanding) creates not
only opportunities to use the new DEMO but also institutional stresses.  Stresses
occur because institutions are designed around DEMO outdated knowledge, with
changing knowledge shared asymmetrically by the various stakeholders. DEMO the past two
decades or so, capital markets have undergone considerable DEMO These include
changes in our conceptual model of how markets work, DEMO well as changes in the volume
of data.  The evolution in DEMO pricing, from the one-factor capital asset pricing model
3 Marginal risk DEMO ascertains the incremental contribution of each activity to the total risk of the firm.
-15-
though to more recent multi-factor models, as well as the revolution in derivative pricing
together with advances in corporate financial theory, have changed the way investor and
management decisions are made. These theoretical innovations have created DEMO demand
for new data to verify and calibrate these new models. This push for data has been
exacerbated by a phenomenal growth in computing DEMO Enhanced understanding of
the underlying economic mechanisms and better data potentially allow all stakeholders to
make decisions that better create value.
Accompanying the revolution DEMO financial theory and explosion in data has been a market
enhancement that Bravler and Borge label capital market intensity. More information and
better understanding DEMO investors to monitor changes in a firm’s fortune quickly and to
act accordingly. Passive investors may simply buy or sell. But an increasing tendency DEMO
shareholder activism, especially in hedge funds, has led to investor involvement in
corporate decision making. This is exercised by applying direct pressure to DEMO,
influencing board composition, removing management, etc. In this way, DEMO can
exert direct influence over management to seek preferred risk-reward profiles. At the
same time, of course, the innovations bestow better tools on DEMO to attend to
investor needs. In particular, the sophisticated tools of DEMO engineering and the
bewildering array of financial instruments permit almost unlimited flexibility to
management to redesign its risk-reward profile.
In Bravler and Borge’s view, increased capital market intensity challenges the traditional
principal-agent based model of corporate DEMO The traditional model assumes that
managers have a comparative advantage in both information and decision skills over
investors, but investors induce managers to create value by means of incentive
compatible employment contracts. In the new world DEMO capital intensity, the comparative
advantage between (at least some) investors DEMO managers is largely removed. Braver and
Borge see a new model which is analogous to a two-sided market structure. The CFO acts
as an DEMO between the management and investors: “The CFO is the agent of DEMO
company in the capital markets and the agent of capital market discipline inside the
company”.  In fact, we would probably suggest that the DEMO is still properly regarded as
the agent of the company. However, DEMO does not diminish the power of the Bralver-
Borge observation that the CFO’s role needs to be redefined to refocus corporate
attention on value DEMO for investors and to use the potent strategies and instruments
now available to achieve this end. If the CFO falls down on this task, increasingly activist
investors may simply do it for themselves.
Contracts:  Intentional DEMO and “Hold-Up”
Things that are unknown now may become known as events unfold. 9/11 informed us of
a different form and magnitude of DEMO  Recent financial crises, notably the Asian
crisis and the subprime crisis, informed us of hitherto unsuspected correlations in tail risk
that have now deepened our understanding of systemic risk. However, not only new
events, DEMO also new theory, can shift us from U toward K. For DEMO, assets that might
appear mis-priced under a simple single-factor pricing model DEMO appear well-priced
under a multi-factor model.  Unfortunately, retrogression also occurs.  DEMO
-16-
relationships which have proven stable over many years may suddenly break down.
DEMO structures which were well-understood may prove to have hidden flaws.
Policies that seem reliable in normal times may fail to work in a crisis.
DEMO we cannot anticipate events, or do not understand their consequences, it becomes
difficult to write effective contracts. For example, the insurance industry was recently
surprised by several new classes of claims that it had not DEMO and therefore had
neither written them into coverage or explicitly excluded them. These included toxic
mold damage to buildings and to the health of DEMO residents, as well as the new forms of
terrorism that blur DEMO distinction between traditional terrorism and actual warfare. Other
examples include innovative legal rulings that have substantially changed coverage from
what seems to have been DEMO into policies; examples include the (sometime) removal
of the distinction DEMO flood and wind coverage in post-Katrina claims and the earlier
reinterpretations coverage for “sudden and unexpected” liabilities to include “gradual and
expected.”
Insurance contracts DEMO usually written for named perils, or written to include a broad
DEMO of perils insofar as they are not specifically excluded by contract language. Either
way, the contract defines what is covered and what is not. If the covered perils are
“known” in our terminology, a price can be set relative to the (known) expected loss and
other distributional DEMO that indicate the cost of capital. Even if events are
unknown in the sense that they can be identified but cannot be assigned  probabilities,
contracts can still be written, although the setting of premiums becomes a challenge. But
when events cannot even be specified, contracts cannot easily be imagined.
Doherty and Muermann ask whether risks that are indeed unknowable DEMO be effectively
transferred to insurers. Using incomplete contract theory, they argue DEMO such risks can
be, and are, allocated to insurers. When writing through independent agents and brokers,
insurers vest the intermediary with considerable DEMO power. Agents and brokers
can move their books of business and may do so if they believe this serves the interests of
their policyholders. DEMO, they argue that this hold-up power is used to extend
insurance DEMO to include some non-specified events. If a hitherto unknown event
arises, DEMO broker can decide whether it is one that can, and should DEMO, insurable going
forward (i.e., now that it has graduated from DEMO to u or K). If so, the broker might use DEMO
leverage to bargain with the insurer for a settlement for its client. Indeed, such ex post
bargaining may even be anticipated when contracts are written, and premiums adjusted
upwards accordingly. In this way, brokered markets DEMO provide an orderly market in
which unknown events can be insured despite the fact that the coverage is not formally
specified in the contract.
DEMO contracts may indeed be a common device for coping with the unknown. For
example, employment contracts for CEO’s and other top executives are incomplete
insofar as they do not anticipate detailed scenarios and prescribe specific managerial
DEMO Instead, they rely on alignment of the interest of the CEO DEMO shareholders
through compensation design and allocate considerable discretion to the CEO to respond
to events drawn from the whole KuU space. In this way DEMO CEO’s skill is given
-17-
considerable scope to respond quickly to new information, as emphasized for example in
Ken Scott’s paper.
Investment Vehicles: Riding “Sidecar” with Better-Informed Agents
Richard Zeckhauser looks at investment in, uU events, for which there is DEMO
knowledge. The usual training in financial economics avails us little in dealing with uU
events. Consequently, markets are thin and potentially enormous excess returns are
available to those with resources and talents to venture into these DEMO explored places. It
helps to have billions to invest, complementary skills, steady nerve and freedom from
blame when things don’t work out (as often happens). Warren Buffett and his ilk can
prosper in this DEMO, but what about the rest of us? Can we also make sensible and
profitable forays into this compelling and intimidating territory? Richard Zeckhauser
raises this question in an unorthodox essay that draws both on his DEMO experience (as a
“sidecar investor”) and on his deep insights in areas of economics not usually considered
relevant to investors.
Consider the investor DEMO money, steady nerve and complementary skills. He or she may
well DEMO willing to make a speculative investment, accepting large risk for extraordinary
DEMO returns. Can investors with lesser skills and resources attach themselves to this
powerful motor-bike and go along for the ride as a “sidecar”? It is certainly dangerous
territory. The risks for the biker with the wherewithal DEMO handle it can be enormous, and
risks may be relatively greater DEMO those riding sidecar.  Moreover, dealing with those
who are better informed exposes us to adverse selection risk, and this must be balanced
against the absolute advantage from their superior resources and skills. Yet if we
DEMO this trade off, then there are opportunities for sidecar investments.  Robert
Edelstein notes that real estate syndicates are often structured that way.  Investors have
the money and the developer has the complementary skill and experience.  In the end,
however, the developer often has the money and the investors have the experience.
A little game theory and behavioral economics DEMO balance the adverse selection
against the absolute advantage, and Zeckhauser gives DEMO instructive examples ranging
from Russian oil investments to Warren Buffet’s reinsurance ventures. In writing the first
draft of his paper – around the time DEMO Katrina was devastating New Orleans – he
presaged the development of an active sidecar market in insurance, as described by
Kunreuther and Pauly.
Disasters such as 9/11 and Katrina both diminish insurance capacity and usually DEMO
insurance demand, thus leading to excess demand, which is felt in a hardening of the
insurance market. This hard market is felt most DEMO in reinsurance, where post-loss
supply is especially scarce and prices soar.  Often excess demand is fueled by a shift
along the continuum from DEMO to u to U; for example, 9/11 created major uncertainty about
future terror risk, and Katrina fed our fears on the unknowns of global warming. The
hardened reinsurance market, together with enhanced uncertainty of the future risk, create
just those conditions which Zeckhauser considers ripe for very high returns. Reinsurers
possess the complementary skills (if indeed anyone does), but hedge funds have the funds
-18-
and tolerance of ambiguity to partake. As a result sidecar structures have DEMO –
usually with hedge fund (and some other) investors taking quota share investment on the
same terms as reinsurance contracts. These differ from DEMO investment in the reinsurer
in that they cover only specified risks and usually for a short time frame.
The example of reinsurance-based sidecars represents DEMO example where absolute
advantage probably trumps adverse selection. While there may be some adverse selection
in the original contractual relationship whereby the reinsurer “insures DEMO primary
insurer,” there is unlikely to be much additional adverse selection in the derived
relationship between the reinsurer and the sidecar investors. Thus, the value creation is
driven by absolute advantage, and sidecar investors can share in this added value.
E. Use Financial Policy to Limit Vulnerability DEMO Shocks Ex Ante or Mitigate
the Consequences Ex Post
Financial policy becomes most relevant when a shock that was unknown or
unknowable shifts the DEMO system from the domain of the known into the unknown.
Financial policy-makers are charged with limiting the vulnerability of the financial
system to such DEMO and mitigating the consequences of these shocks once they occur.
Financial policy-makers aim to promote monetary and financial stability. In practice,
virtually every DEMO of financial policy is subject to uncertainty.  For example, how
precisely should these objectives be defined?  With regard to monetary policy, what
amount of inflation is consistent with achieving stable, sustainable growth?  What
measure of inflation is appropriate?  Is it feasible, both technically and politically, for the
monetary authorities to prevent asset bubbles during periods of low and stable inflation?
Jacob Frenkel (Thornhill and Michaels, 2008, p. 4), former Governor of the Bank of
Israel, has expressed doubt about whether the monetary authorities know enough to
deflate bubbles before DEMO become dangerous.  He asserts that the real choice is “Which
system DEMO you want:  one in which the [monetary authority] pricks three bubbles out of
five or five out of three bubbles?  Because we DEMO for sure that it will not be able to
solve four out of four.”
With regard to prudential policy, the primary goal of financial stability must be to
protect the functioning of the financial system in DEMO payments services and
facilitating the efficient allocation of resources over time and across space.  This may be
threatened by a loss of confidence in key financial markets or institutions.  But how safe
should financial institutions be?  Should all failures be prevented?  Would the required
restrictions on DEMO by financial institutions reduce the efficiency of financial
intermediation and reduce investment?  Would this deprive the economy of the dynamic
benefits of creative DEMO?  But if financial institutions should not be required to be
perfectly safe, what degree of safety should the prudential authorities try to achieve?
What tools should be used to achieve these objectives?  And DEMO governance
structure is most likely to motivate policy-makers to act in the public interest?  Public-
sector compensation contracts are much more highly constrained DEMO compensation
contracts for senior executives in financial services firms.  More fundamentally, when
-19-
objectives are not crisply defined, it is difficult to establish and enforce accountability.
Blame avoidance is, by default, the primary objective of most DEMO
Although the prudential supervisory authorities have enormous, if ill-defined,
responsibility, they have relatively little power to constrain risk-taking by profitable
institutions that DEMO believe to have excessive exposures to uncertain shocks.  In order to
DEMO against the arbitrary use of regulatory and supervisory power, most countries
DEMO disciplinary decisions by officials to some sort of judicial or administrative
review.  To discipline a bank, a supervisor must not only know that DEMO bank is taking
excessive risk, but also be able to prove DEMO to the satisfaction of the reviewing body –
perhaps beyond a reasonable doubt.  This leads to a natural tendency to delay disciplinary
measures until much of the damage from excessive risk-taking has already been done.
(As Kenneth Scott notes, the Prompt Corrective Action measures adopted in the US are
intended to constrain this tendency to forbear in the enforcement of DEMO regulations by
removing a degree of supervisory discretion.)  It also leads officials to react mainly to
what has already happened (and is, DEMO, objectively verifiable) rather than to act on
the basis of expectations about what may happen (which are inherently disputable).  In
Charles DEMO refinement of the KuU framework in which K is partitioned into
actual past data and expected values, supervisors generally react to past actual losses
rather than mean expected losses, much less the unexpected losses, even DEMO the
governing probability distribution is believed to be known.  Alan Greenspan (2008, p. 9),
former Chairman of the Board of Governors DEMO the Federal Reserve System, has
expressed doubt about whether regulators know DEMO to act preemptively:
“Regulators, to be effective, have to be forward-looking to anticipate the next financial
malfunction.  This has not proved feasible.  Regulators confronting real time uncertainty
have rarely, if ever, been able to achieve the level of future clarity required to act
preemptively.”
Regulating DEMO Imperfect Information
Information issues present a fundamental challenge to supervisory authorities who
must oversee the solvency of regulated financial institutions.  Neither actual past data, not
expected values can be relied upon in times of crisis when difficult supervisory decisions
must be made.  Bank accounting has traditionally been a mix of historical cost
accounting, accrual accounting and mark to market accounting.  This has sometimes
undermined incentives for hedging risks by valuing a risky position and the offsetting
hedge differently, thereby increasing the volatility of earnings, even though risk has been
reduced.  Many doubt this mix of DEMO conveys a true and fair account of the current
position of a financial institution.  New financial accounting standards require firms to
classify assets in three different categories:  (1) assets that can be marked to DEMO based
on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; (2) assets that are marked to
matrix, based on observable market data; and (3) assets that are marked to model, based
on judgment regarding how the market would price such assets if they were traded DEMO
active markets.  This third category presents significant difficulties for regulators, who
face a severe asymmetric information problem vis-à-vis the regulated institution.  How
can the regulatory authorities comfortably rely on the estimated values of category three
DEMO
assets? Opinions of auditors and ratings agencies may help the authorities avoid blame,
but the key question, as Goodhart notes, is “Who DEMO legal liability if the values are
wrong?”
Part of the problem, as noted by Stewart Myers in a workshop that preceded this
volume, is that financial theory offers only two kinds of tools for valuing assets that are
not traded in active markets:  (1) the DEMO value of discounted cash flows, which works
well in a world DEMO K, where cash flows can be predicted and risks estimated; and (2) real
option theory, which works well only if you can write a decision tree that captures most
of the key uncertainties and DEMO points in the future.  Fundamental values rest on
relatively shaky foundations, and a shock may shift a price from the realm of K DEMO that of
u.
Even category 1 assets may present problems in a crisis.  Setting aside the issue of
asset price bubbles, market values DEMO be relied upon so long as assets are traded in
broad, DEMO resilient markets.  In such markets, however, assets tend to be DEMO on the
basis of comparisons to their own past prices or to the prices of comparable assets.  When
a shock undermines confidence in these relative values and causes losses, traders tend to
withdraw from markets until they regain confidence in their valuation models.  Such
shocks move prices from K to u.  Concerns may arise about counterparties who may have
had excessive exposures to the shock and markets become thin.  A flight to quality may
occur and liquidity will be restored only when confidence in DEMO models and
counterparties is restored.
Crisis Prevention
Most policymakers would agree with Don Kohn that it is better to prevent such
crises than to DEMO to manage and mitigate them once they have occurred.  However, crisis
prevention is an enormous burden, which falls mainly on the shoulders of the prudential
authorities.  Prudential regulation attempts to establish rules for the sound operation of
financial institutions and critical elements of the financial infrastructure such DEMO clearing
and settlement arrangements.  Ideally, prudential policymakers should be looking beyond
K to anticipate emerging sources of systemic vulnerability in order to calibrate
DEMO prudential policies.  In the dynamic world of modern finance this requires
DEMO to understand how changing institutions, products, markets and trading strategies
create vulnerabilities to new kinds of shocks and new channels of contagion.  But K
cannot be neglected.  Institutions still fail in familiar ways by taking excessive
concentrations of credit risk or by imprudently borrowing short and lending DEMO as
recent experience with Northern Rock and dozens of Structured Investment Vehicles
have shown.
Prudential supervisory authorities confront a number of trade-offs that must DEMO
made on uncertain terms.  How safe should banks be?  Goodhart DEMO that it is relatively
easy to establish a set of penalties that would make the banking system perfectly safe, but
largely irrelevant in intermediating between savers and investors.  Scott argues that a
central feature of corporate governance is aligning the risk neutral preferences of well-
-21-
diversified shareholders with risk-averse managers.  This calculus is unlikely to take
account of the systemic costs of an institution’s failure and so the prudential DEMO
will presumably prefer a higher degree of safety, but how much DEMO?
How much competition is desirable?  Competition is generally viewed as a
positive feature of the financial system.  It stimulates innovation and lowers the cost of
financial services. But, it also reduces the charter values of incumbent banks and may
lead to increased risk taking.  Goodhart notes that, over time, the official view regarding
competition has swung from DEMO extreme to another.  During the Depression, the
authorities tended to regard competition as a source of instability and implemented a
number of reforms DEMO constrain competition.  More recently, the dominant trend has been
liberalization of competition, although the current crisis in credit markets may cause a
reversal.
Should financial innovation be encouraged?  Securitization has facilitated
diversification of risk, reduced costs and liberated borrowers from dependence on
particular lenders, but the subprime crisis has shown that it can also undermine credit
standards and DEMO banks to achieve higher leverage by evading capital requirements.
Derivatives have enabled financial institutions to partition and manage risks much more
efficiently, but they can also be used to take enormous, highly leveraged risks.  The
DEMO sophistication of risk management techniques has enabled institutions to push
out the boundaries of the known, but the very complexity of these techniques presents a
challenge in the event of a crisis because it is very DEMO for the authorities to
comprehend the full range of positions and how they are managed.  As Ralph Gomory
warned in his essay on KuU, “[A]s the artifacts of science and engineering grow ever
larger and more complex, they may themselves become unpredictable.”
The supervisory authorities have a number of tools.  These include licensing
requirements, restrictions on certain kinds of DEMO believed to be excessively risky,
liquidity requirements, capital requirements and DEMO requirements.  The authorities
may also try to identify and encourage the DEMO adoption of best practices in risk
management, in effect urging the DEMO sector to convert u into K.
By far the most ambitious effort at prudential regulation has been the
development and of the Basel II DEMO for capital adequacy.  Andrew Kuriztkes and
Til Schuermann provide a framework DEMO analyzing KuU in bank risk taking and show
how the Basel II capital requirements correspond to this framework.  They argue that a
risk can be classified as K to the extent that it can be identified DEMO quantified ex ante.
They observe that the ability to estimate downside tail risks at a high level of confidence
has enabled financial institutions to DEMO the concept of economic capital, the amount
of capital needed to DEMO against earnings volatility at a prescribed level of confidence,
usually set equal to the default rate associated with the financial institution’s target debt
DEMO  Economic capital has become the common denominator for measuring and
aggregating DEMO in the financial services industry.  But it is firmly rooted in DEMO known
and does not transplant readily to the unknown.
-22-
Kuritzkes and Schuermann classify a risk as u to the extent it DEMO be identified ex
ante, but not meaningfully quantified.  A risk is classified as U if the existence of the risk
is not predictable, much less quantifiable ex ante.  Since these risks can’t be quantified,
they can’t be managed.  They can, however, sometimes be transferred.  DEMO and
Schuermann employ this framework to analyze how KuU varies by risk type based on the
richness and granularity of the data available to DEMO each kind of risk and conclude
that K decreases and u and U increase moving along a spectrum from market risk to
credit risk, to asset/liability management risk to operational risk to business risk.  In
addition they analyze bank holding company data on earnings volatility to estimate DEMO
total amount of risk in the US banking system and to allocate this total risk across risk
types.  Financial risks – market risk, DEMO risk and asset/liability management risk
account for 70% of the volatility of earnings.  Non-financial risks – operational risk and
business risk – account for the remaining 30%.  Within financial risks, market risk is 6%,DEMO
credit risk is 46% and asset-liability management risk is 18% of total volatility.
Unfortunately, we know the most about the least important type of risk (although as the
authors note this may due in part to the success banks have achieved in measuring and
managing it).  Within non-financial risks, operational risk accounts for 12% and business
risk accounts for 18% of the volatility of earnings.  Regrettably, we know the least DEMO
business risk which has been three times larger than market risk.
Bank regulators began to take note of the evolving concept of economic capital
DEMO they expanded the original Basel Accord on Capital Adequacy to take account of
market risk. The 1996 Market Risk Amendment provided an entirely new DEMO to
setting capital requirements that relied on the way that leading banks were measuring and
managing this risk.  The original Accord set capital requirements roughly in line with
expected losses.  The concept of economic capital made clear that the role of capital
should be to absorb unexpected losses, with reserves established to absorb expected
losses.  And so, instead of DEMO banks to allocate their positions to crude risk
buckets, or applying DEMO asset price haircuts to positions in an attempt to
approximate risks, DEMO regulatory authorities provided the opportunity for qualifying
banks to rely on the supervised use of their internal models to determine their capital
charges for DEMO to market risk.
The internal models approach was expected to deliver several benefits.  First, it
would reduce or eliminate incentives for regulatory capital DEMO because the capital
charge would reflect the bank’s own estimate of risk.  Second, it would reward
diversification to the extent that a bank’s DEMO models captured correlations across risk
positions.  Third, it would deal more flexibly with financial innovations, incorporating
them in the regulatory framework as soon as they were incorporated in the bank’s own
risk management models.  Fourth, it would provide banks with an incentive to improve
their risk management processes and procedures in order to qualify for the internal
models approach.  And fifth, compliance costs would be reduced to the extent that the
business was regulated in the same way that it was managed.  By and large, the internal
models approach for market risk has proven to be highly successful, even when it was
severely tested by the extreme market disruption in 1997, 1998, and 2001, which is
consistent with the view of Kuritzkes and Schuermann that market risk is largely K.  This
-23-
success, in combination with the progress made in modeling credit risk, DEMO to calls from
industry to revise the original Basel Accord to incorporate an internal models approach to
capital regulation of credit risk.
Basel II DEMO to extend this new approach to setting capital requirements to
credit risk and operational risk.  Although the supervisory authorities were convinced that
credit scoring models had significantly expanded the amount of credit risk that could be
DEMO as falling in the domain of the known, they were skeptical DEMO internal models
of credit risk were as reliable and verifiable as models of market risk.  While some kinds
of credit risk like retail lending have rich and granular data sets comparable to market
risk, other kinds of credit risk are less amenable to empirical analysis because data are
DEMO relative to past credit cycles and distinctly non-granular.  In the end, the regulators
rejected the supervised use of internal models, but permitted qualifying banks to use their
internal model inputs – estimates of probability of DEMO, loss given default, exposure at
default and duration of exposure -- as inputs in the regulatory model that would
determine capital requirements.  These Pillar 1 capital requirements recognized the
analytical and empirical advances banks had DEMO in expanding the extent to which
credit risk can be regarded as known.
Moving further to the right in the KuU spectrum, the decision to establish a Pillar
1 capital charge for operational risk has been DEMO more controversial.  In this instance
the regulators were not simply adopting DEMO best practice as in the case of market
risk and credit risk.  They were attempting to advance best practice by requiring greater
investment in measuring and managing operational risk.  Moving operational risk into the
domain of the known presents major challenges.  Until quite recently, the industry lacked
DEMO a common definition of operational risk.  Moreover, it is difficult to quantify and
disaggregate, data are sparse and theory is weak.
Because Basel II is an agreement negotiated among the members of the Basel
Committee DEMO Banking Supervision it reflects a number of political compromises that
undermine its aspirations for technical precision.  This is most evident in the definition of
regulatory capital which is based on accounting values and includes a number DEMO items
that do not reflect an institution’s capacity to bear unexpected loss.  This undercuts the
link to best practices in risk management the logic of the approach.
Pillar 1 capital charges are intended to deal with DEMO risks.  Pillar 2, the
supervisory review process, is intended to DEMO with unknown risks that can be identified,
but are not sufficiently well-quantified to establish Pillar 1 capital charges.  Presumably,
as theoretical and empirical advances succeed in moving some of these risks into the
domain DEMO the known, Pillar 1 capital charges will be established for them DEMO well.  In
view of the analysis by Kuritzkes and Schuermann, it is surprising that asset-liability
management risk is treated under Pillar 2, while operational risk is treated under Pillar 1.
Although liquidity is inherently difficult DEMO measure because it has at least three
dimensions – price, time DEMO size – interest rate risk, another important aspect of asset-
liability DEMO risk, is much more easily quantified than operational risk and it DEMO
been a much more important source of volatility in bank earnings than operational risk.

Kuritzkes and Schuermann raise the question of whether regulatory and industry
resources DEMO have been more usefully directed to standardizing the approach for
characterizing and measuring asset/liability risk.
Benoit Mandelbrot and Nassim Taleb warn that there DEMO much more u in K than is
commonly acknowledged.  The past DEMO never a perfect predictor of the future.  New
factors may become DEMO and relationships estimated in times of normal market
functioning tend to break down at times of market stress.  What we thought was mild
randomness often proves to be wild randomness – or at least more often DEMO in should if
it were governed by a Gaussian distribution.    DEMO Will Roger’s phrase, one the key risks
may be what we DEMO we know “that just ain’t so.”
The principal tools of supervisory analysis in the domain of the unknown are
stress testing and scenario analysis.  Stress-testing requires economic judgment to
formulate and calibrate scenarios that expose potential DEMO  It requires a
careful consideration of which relationships will continue to DEMO and which relationships
will break down in time of stress.  Mandelbrot DEMO Taleb caution that traditional stress
testing, which relies on selecting a DEMO of worst-case scenarios from past data, may
be seriously misleading because DEMO implicitly assumes that a fluctuation of this magnitude
would be the worst that should be expected.  They note that crashes happen without
antecedents.  DEMO the crash of 1987, for example, stress testing would not have
included a 22% drop in share prices within a single day.  They note that just ten trading
days account for 63% of the returns DEMO the stock market over the past 50 years.  In their
view DEMO methods should be used to extrapolate multiple projected scenarios that
would enable risk managers and prudential supervisors to evaluate the robustness of a
portfolio DEMO an entire spectrum of extreme risks.
Goodhart emphasizes a different concern regarding stress testing and scenario
analysis.  What may matter most in crises are interactive effects that occur when many
institutions attempt to adjust their portfolios DEMO the same way at the same time.  These are
critical to DEMO an institution’s vulnerability in a crisis, but are omitted from
most DEMO
Stress-testing and the simulation of crises may be of value even if such crises
never occur.  The data necessary to simulate a crisis may prove useful in monitoring
vulnerability and a careful consideration of the consequences DEMO such a crisis may lead to
changes in strategy and/or risk management.  Crises seldom unfold according to the
anticipated scenario, but strategies DEMO responding to one kind of shock may prove useful
when a different kind of shock occurs.  For example, evacuation procedures that Morgan
Stanley DEMO after the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 enabled the firm
to safeguard all of their employees in the much more severe DEMO attack on September
11, 2001.
The key element of regulatory discipline DEMO Pillar 2, however, is the ability of
the prudential supervisor to impose an additional capital charge on an institution if they
are uncomfortable DEMO the results of its stress tests.  This places supervisors in the DEMO of
-25-
imposing discipline on an institution thought to be vulnerable to a shock DEMO unknown
probability even though they are less-well-paid and less-well-informed than bank
managers.  The history of bank supervision does not provide much basis for optimism
that they will succeed.  Northern Rock provides a recent example of a notable failure to
do so.  In June 2007, just before the DEMO collapse of the bank, the British Financial
Services Authority (FSA) DEMO Northern Rock to apply the Pillar I internal-ratings-
based risk weights, DEMO reduced its required regulatory capital and Northern Rock
increased its dividends by 30% the next month.  The FSA made no attempt to offset the
reduction in Pillar 1 capital charges with a Pillar 2 capital nor DEMO it require Northern
Rock to conduct a stress scenario that would have shown that it was fatally exposed to a
liquidity shock.
How should DEMO supervisors deal with U?  As Scott notes, firms can limit
DEMO leverage and maintain enough capital and liquidity to absorb unknowable losses if
they should occur.  But how much slack is sufficient?  By assumption that is unknowable,
but almost all of the things that banks DEMO do to cope with the unknowable are very
costly and competitive pressures may make it very difficult to sustain such precautions.
Should regulators therefore DEMO that banks hold capital substantially in excess of the
regulatory minimum as a safeguard against unknown and unknowable shocks?
Increasing capital charges for DEMO that cannot be identified becomes a deadweight cost
and may lead to the circumvention of regulation and riskier outcomes.  As Andrew
Crockett observed at the opening conference, which began this project, it is inherently
difficult DEMO policy-makers to strike the proper balance between the efficiency losses
associated with excessively onerous preventative policies and the cost effectiveness of
responding ex post DEMO adverse events.  For regulators as well as firms, the appropriate
amount of financial slack is an unknown.
Pillar 3 of the Basel II DEMO is intended to enhance market discipline by
improving disclosure.  The authorities DEMO collect and publish data that helps market
participants understand the current state of the economy and financial markets and the
condition of regulated financial DEMO  But growing reliance on dynamic trading
strategies to manage risk has DEMO it increasingly difficult to provide a meaningful
picture of risk exposures.  DEMO may change so rapidly that information is out-of-date
before it can be published.  Moreover, the chief motive for market discipline – the fear DEMO
loss – is often undermined by the reluctance of the authorities to permit the creditors and
counterparties of systemically important financial institutions to suffer DEMO  The
extraordinary bailout of Bear Stearns by the Fed is a DEMO case in point.
The ambitious new Basel II approach attempts to incorporate in capital regulation
what is known about risk management, but it may generate several unintended
consequences that could shift the financial system into the DEMO of the unknown.  The
attempt to force all major firms to DEMO one version of “best practice” and especially the
imposition of a regulatory model of credit risk may increase the likelihood of herding.
Banks may DEMO much more likely to attempt to move the same direction at the same time
which can undermine the liquidity of markets and increase volatility.  To the extent that
Basel II succeeds in making capital requirements more DEMO sensitive, it will make bank
-26-
lending more pro-cyclical.  In a boom, risks are likely to decline DEMO, consequently, so
will required capital thus facilitating additional lending.  In DEMO recession, internal ratings
will migrate downward, thus increasing required capital just as credit losses erode the
bank’s capital position thus constricting the supply DEMO loans.  More risk-sensitive capital
requirements may inadvertently accentuate booms and busts.  In may make individual
banks safer, but weaken the banking system.  DEMO fundamentally, Basel II fails to deal
with systemic risk.
Crisis Mitigation
DEMO it is so difficult for prudential supervisors to fulfill their responsibilities
ex ante, policy-makers must often shift into crisis management mode to mitigate, DEMO post,
the consequences of a shock.  Kohn observes that in DEMO financial crisis, the ratio of u and U
will be especially DEMO relative to K.  Policy-makers must deal with unknowns such as
the DEMO of the disruption.  How large will it be?  How many DEMO will be involved?  How
long will it last?  How likely is it to have serious spillover consequences for real
economic activity?
DEMO of the problem is in anticipating the channels of contagion.  Which DEMO
have direct exposure to the shock?  Which firms have indirect exposure because they are
counterparties or creditors of the firms that sustain a DEMO impact or because they have
similar exposures and could lose access to external financing?  Which other firms might
be placed in jeopardy because DEMO the forced liquidation of assets in illiquid markets?  Risk
preferences and perceptions of risk are dynamic and so a flight to quality often DEMO
Market participants may sell assets whose prices are already declining and avoid any
counterparty that might be impaired.
Another part of the problem is DEMO policy-makers must operate with incomplete
knowledge about the current state of the economy and how their actions (or inaction) may
affect economic activity.  Moreover, monetary policy operates with long and variable
lags and it is difficult to anticipate market responses to shocks.  Yet the monetary
authorities, DEMO argues, must immediately determine whether there is adequate liquidity
in the DEMO system and whether monetary policy needs to be adjusted to counter the
effects on the economy of a crisis-induced tightening of credit.
In a DEMO, policy-makers must try to convert u into K as quickly as DEMO  This
requires close cooperation across regulatory authorities with a country and, increasingly,
across borders.  Inevitably, the primary source of information is DEMO market
participants.  But conflicts of interest may corrupt flows of information.  Information may
be selectively communicated to serve the self interest of market DEMO who might
be the beneficiaries of crisis management policies.  Does this DEMO for a direct role of the
crisis manager in supervising systemically important institutions?  The Fed insists that it
does, but central banks lack such authority in many other countries (Herring and
Carmassi, 2008) and the new Treasury proposal for reforming the US financial system
removes supervisory DEMO from the Fed while increasing its responsibility for crisis
-27-
management.  How best to organize prudential supervision and crisis management
remains a significant unknown.
Policy-makers must also convey information in a crisis.  Kohn raises the question
of what is the appropriate response.  They may urge firms to do what the policymakers
believe they should do in their own DEMO, as happened in the LTCM crisis in 1998.
But when is DEMO appropriate to be reassuring?  When might reassurance prove
counterproductive?
Crisis management may inadvertently lead to larger future crises.  If risk-takers
are protected from the full negative consequences of their decisions, they may be likely to
take greater risks in the future.  This presents a difficult dilemma for crisis management.
The costs of inaction are immediate and obvious.  It’s easy to imagine damaging
outcomes and self-interested market participants will press for DEMO support and can
easily muster political support.  Inaction in a crisis DEMO likely to be subject to blame even
when it is appropriate which may contribute to an inherent tendency to oversupply public
support.  Once it has been provided, entrenched interests will lobby to keep it and new
additional activity may depend on it.  Moreover, moral hazard manifests itself DEMO and
may be difficult to relate to any one particular policy choice.
Kohn argues that moral hazard is less likely if policy is directed DEMO the broad
market rather than individual firms.  From this perspective open DEMO operations are a
better means of adjusting aggregate liquidity to meet the demands that arise from a flight
to safety.  Although this kind of response may encourage risk-taking, it may also
genuinely lower risk.  Direct DEMO and bailouts are much more likely to distort
incentives.  Ultimately, efficient resolution policy may be the best safeguard against
moral hazard.  But in most countries policy-makers lack the appropriate tools to resolve a
large, complex financial institution without jeopardizing the rest of the financial system
(Herring, DEMO).
III.  Onward
The chapters that follow heighten our awareness of DEMO existence of and
distinctions among K, u and U risks, pushing in a variety of contexts toward improved
risk measurement and management strategies.  Because K risks are often amenable to
statistical treatment, whereas uU risks are usually not (despite their potentially large
consequences), substantial resources will continue to be deployed in academia, industry
and government to expand the domain of K when possible.  Surely Ralph Gomory (1995)
was DEMO in noting that “In time many things now unknown will become known,” so it
is appropriate for a significant part of this book DEMO focus on K.
But as we also emphasize, there are sharp DEMO to expanding the domain of K, so
it is also appropriate DEMO a significant part – indeed the larger part – of this book to focus
on uU. The important issues in the world of uU DEMO more economic (strategic) than
statistical, and crucially linked to incentives:  How to write contracts (design
-28-
organizations, formulate fiscal or monetary policies, draft regulations, make investments
...) in ways that create incentives for best-practice proactive and reactive risk
management for all types of risks, including (and especially) uU risks.  DEMO Gomory also
notes, often “We do not even know if we DEMO dealing … with the partly known, the mainly
unknown or the DEMO (our emphasis).
We look forward to the evolution of financial DEMO management toward confronting K and
u and U equally, and we DEMO pleased that essays collected here take us in that direction.
