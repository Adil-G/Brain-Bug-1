Sequential Decision Making
Sequential decision making describes a situation DEMO
the decision maker (DM) makes successive observa-
tions of a process before a ﬁnal decision is made, in
contrast to dynamic decision making (see Dynamic
Decision Making) which is more concerned with
controlling a DEMO over time.
Formally a sequential decision problem is deﬁned,
such that the DM can take observations X, X,… one
at a time. After each observation Xn the DM can
decide to terminate the process DEMO make a ﬁnal
decision from a set of decisions D, or DEMO the
process and take the next observation Xn+. If the
observations X, X,… form a random sample,
the procedure is called sequential sampling.
In most sequential decision problems there is an
implicit or explicit DEMO associated with each obser-
vation. The procedure to decide when to stop taking
observations and when to continue is called the
stopping rule. The DEMO in sequential decision
making is to ﬁnd a stopping rule that optimizes the
13917
Sequential Decision Making
decision in terms of minimizing losses or maximizing
gains DEMO observation costs. The optimal stop-
ping rule is also called the optimal strategy or the
optimal policy.
A wide variety of sequential decision problems DEMO
been discussed in the statistics literature, including
search problems, inventory problems, gambling prob-
lems, and secretary-type problems, including sampling
with and without recall. Several methods have been
proposed to solve the optimization problem under
DEMO conditions, including dynamic programming,
Markov chains, and Bayesian analysis.
In the psychological literature, sequential decision
problems are better known as optional stopping prob-
lems. One line of research using sequential decision
making is concerned DEMO seeking information in
situations such as buying houses, searching for a DEMO
candidate, price searching, or target search. The DM
continues taking observations until a decision criterion
for acceptance is reached. Another line of research
DEMO sequential decision making to account for
information processing in binary choice tasks (see
Diﬀusion and Random Walk Processes; Stochastic
Dynamic Models (Choice, DEMO, and Time)), and
hypothesis testing such as in signal detection tasks (see
Signal Detection Theory: Multidimensional). The DM
continues taking DEMO until either of two
decision criteria is reached. Depending on the part-
icular research area, observations are also called oﬀers,
options, items, applicants, information, and the like.
Observation costs include explicitly not only DEMO
money, but also time, eﬀort, aggravation, discomfort,
and so on.
Contrary to the objective of statisticians or econo-
mists, psychologists are less interested in determining
the optimal stopping rule, and more interested in
discussing the variables that aﬀect human decision
behavior in sequential decision tasks. DEMO decision
strategies are considered as normative models, and
their predictions are DEMO to actual choice be-
havior.
1. Sequential Decision Making with One Decision
Criterion
In sequential decision making with one decision
criterion the DM takes DEMO observations Xn, n 
1,… of a random process one DEMO a time. After observing
Xn xn the DM has to decide whether to continue
sampling observations or to stop. In the former case,
DEMO observation Xn+ is taken at a cost of cn+; in the
DEMO case the DM receives a net payoﬀ that consists of
the payoﬀ minus the observation costs. The DM’s
objective is to ﬁnd a stopping DEMO that maximizes the
expected net payoﬀ.
The optimal stopping rule depends on the speciﬁc
assumptions made about the situation: (a) the dis-
13918
tribution of X is known, not known or partly known,
(DEMO) Xi are distributed identically for all i, or have the
similar distribution but with diﬀerent parameters, or
have diﬀerent distributions, (c) DEMO number of possible
observations, n, is bounded or unbounded, (d) the
sampling procedure, e.g., it is possible to take the
highest value observed so far when stopping (sampling
with recall) or only DEMO take the last value when stopping
(sampling without recall), and (e) the cost function, cn,
is ﬁxed for each observation DEMO is a function of n. Many
of these problems have been studied theoretically by
mathematicians and experimentally by psychologists.
Pioneering experimental work was done DEMO a series of
papers by Rapoport and colleagues (1966, 1969, DEMO,
1972).
1.1 Unknown Sample Distribution: Secretary-type
Problems
Kahan et DEMO (1967) investigated decision behavior in a
sequential search task where the DM had to ﬁnd the
largest of a set of n  DEMO numbers, observed one at a
time from a deck of cards. DEMO observations were
taken in random order without replacement. The DM
could only declare the current observation as the
largest number (sampling without recall), and could
compare the number with the previous presented
numbers. No explicit DEMO for each observation was
taken, i.e., c  0. The sample distribution was un-
known to the DM. A reward was paid only DEMO the
card with the highest number was selected, and
nothing otherwise. DEMO describes a decision situation
that is known as the secretary problem (DEMO job candidate
search problem; for various other names, see, e.g.,DEMO
Freeman 1983) which, in its simplest form, makes
explicit the DEMO assumptions (Ferguson 1989):
(a) only one position is available, (b) the number n of
applicants is known, (c) DEMO are interviewed
sequentially in random order, each order being equally
likely, and (d) all applicants can be ranked without
ties—the decision to DEMO or accept an applicant must
be based only on the relative ranks of the applicants
interviewed so far, (e) an applicant once rejected
cannot later be recalled, and (f) the payoﬀ is 1 when
choosing the best of the n applicants, 0 otherwise.
The optimal strategy for this kind of problem is to
reject the ﬁrst s1, s  1, items (cards, applicants,
draws) and then choose DEMO ﬁrst item that is best in the
relative ranking so far. With

large n, the probability of choosing the best item is

approximated by 1e and the optimal s by ne.(DEMO 
2.71…). (For derivations, see, e.g., DeGroot 1970,
Freeman 1983, Gilbert and Mosteller 1966).
Kahan et al. (1967) reported that about 40 percent
of their subjects did not follow the DEMO strategy
but stopped too late and rejected a card that should
have been accepted. The failure of the strategy for
describing behavior was assigned DEMO its inadequacy for
the described task. Although at the beginning of the
experiment the participants did not know anything
about the distribution (requirement), they could learn
about the distribution by taking observations (partly
information). To guarantee ignorance of the distri-
bution, Gilbert and Mosteller (1966) recommended
supplying only the rank of the observation made so far
and DEMO the actual value. Seale and Rapoport (1997)
conducted an experiment DEMO this advice. They
found that participants (with n  40 and DEMO  80)
stopped earlier than prescribed by the optimal stop-
ping rule. They proposed simple decision rules or
heuristics to describe the actual DEMO behavior. Using
a cutoﬀ rule, the DM rejects the ﬁrst s1 DEMO
and then chooses the next top-ranked applicant, i.e.,
the candidate. DEMO DM simply counts the number of
applicants and then stops on the ﬁrst candidate after
observing s1 applicants. Under a candidate count
rule, the DM counts the number of candidates and
chooses the j th candidate. DEMO successive non-candidate
rule requires the DM to choose the ﬁrst candidate after
observing at least k consecutive noncandidates fol-
lowing the last candidate.
The DEMO problem has been extended and
generalized in many diﬀerent directions within the
mathematical statistics ﬁeld. Each of the above as-
sumptions has been relaxed DEMO one way or another.
(Ferguson 1989, Freeman 1983). However, DEMO label of
secretary problem tends to be used only when the
distribution is unknown and the decision to stop or to
continue depends only DEMO the relative ranking of the
observations taken so far and not on their actual
values.
1.2 Known Sample Distribution
Rapoport and Tversky (1966, DEMO) investigated
choice behavior when the mean and the variance of the
DEMO was known to the DM. The cost for each
observation was ﬁxed but the amount varied across
experimental conditions, and the number of possible
observations n was unbounded (1966) or bounded and
known (1970). Behavior for sampling with and with-
out recall was compared. When sampling DEMO without
recall only the value of the last observation, Xn xn,DEMO
can be received, and the payoﬀ is this value minus the
DEMO sampling cost, i.e, xncn. The optimal strategy is
to ﬁnd a stopping rule that maximizes the expected
payoﬀ E(XNcN). When sampling DEMO with recall, the
highest value observed so far can be selected DEMO the
payoﬀ is max(x,…, xn)cn and the optimal DEMO
is to ﬁnd a stopping rule that maximizes
E(max(X,…, XN)cN). In the following,  with
subscripts and * DEMO the expected gain from an
(optimal) procedure.
1.2.1 Number of Obserations Unbounded. If n is un-
bounded, i.e., if the number of DEMO that can
be taken is unlimited, and X, X… are sampled from
a known distribution function F(x), the optimal strat-
egy DEMO the same for both sampling with and without
recall. In particular, DEMO optimal strategy is to con-
tinue to take observations whenever the observed
value xj *, and to stop taking observations as
soon as an observed value xj *, where * is the
unique solution of
&DEMO (x*)dF(x) c * . (2)
v*
When DEMO observations are taken from a standard
normal distribution with density functions φ(x) and
distribution function Φ(x), we have that
*  φ(*)c . (3)
1Φ(*)
Although sampling with and without recall have the
same solution, they seem to be diﬀerent from a
psychological point of view. Rapoport and Tversky
(1966) found DEMO the group sampling without recall
took signiﬁcantly fewer observations than the partici-
pants sampling with recall. The mean number of
observations for both groups DEMO with increas-
ing cost c, and the diﬀerence with respect to DEMO
number of observations taken was diminished. How-
ever, the participants in DEMO groups took fewer
observations than prescribed by the optimal strategy.
This nonoptimal behavior of the participants was
attributed to a lack of thorough knowledge DEMO the
distributions.
1.2.2 Number of Obserations Bounded. If n, n  DEMO,
is bounded, i.e., if not more than n observations can
be taken, the optimal stopping rules for sampling
with and without recall are diﬀerent. For sampling
without recall, an optimal procedure is to continue
taking observations whenever xj n−jc and to
stop as soon as xj DEMO, where j  1, 2… n indi-
cates the number of observations which remain avail-
able and
j+ (jc)& (x(jc)) dF(x). (4)

Sequential Decision Making
With  E(X)c, the sequence can be computed
successively. Again, assuming a standard normal
distribution j+ φ(jc)Φ(jc).
For sampling with recall, the optimal strategy is to
continue the process whenever a value xj * and to
stop taking observations DEMO soon as an observed value
xj *, where * is as DEMO Eqn. (2), which is the same
solution as for n DEMO (For derivations of the
strategies, see DeGroot 1970, Sakaguchi 1961.)DEMO
Rapoport and Tversky (1970) investigated choice
behavior within this scenario. Sampling was done
both with and without recall. The number of observa-
tions DEMO could be taken as well as observation cost
varied across experimental groups. One third of the
participants did not follow the optimal strategy. Under
DEMO sampling procedures and all cost conditions, they
took on average fewer DEMO than predicted by
the corresponding optimal stopping rules. There were
no systematic diﬀerences due to cost, as observed in
their previous study. They concluded that ‘the optimal
model provides a reasonable good account of the
behavior DEMO the subjects’ (p. 119).
1.3 Diﬀerent Sample Distributions for Each
DEMO
Most research concerned with sequential decision
making assumes that the observations are sampled
from the same distribution, i.e., Xi are distributed
identically for DEMO i. For many decision situations,
however, the observations may be DEMO from the
same distribution family with diﬀerent parameters, or
from diﬀerent DEMO Especially in economic
areas, such as price search, it is reasonable to assume
that the distributions from which observations are
taken change over DEMO The sequence of those samples
has been called nonstationary series. Of particular
interest are two special nonstationary series: ascending
and descending series. For ascending series, the ob-
servations are drawn from distributions, usually from
normal DEMO, with increasing mean as i in-
creases; for descending series the mean of the dis-
tribution decreases as i increases, i indicating the
sample index. For both cases, experiments have
been conducted to investigate choice behavior in a
changing environment. Shapira and Venezia (1981)
compared choice behavior for ascending, descending
and constant (identically distributed Xi) series. In one
experiment (numbers from a deck of cards), the
distributions were known to the DM; no explicit
observation costs were imposed; sampling DEMO
without recall; and the number of observations that
could be taken DEMO limited to n  7. The variance of
the distributions varied across experimental groups.
An optimal procedure was assumed to continue taking
observations whenever DEMO n−j, and to stop as soon
as xj n−j, where j  1, 2… n indicates the number of
13920
observations which remain available. k 1,…, n indi-
cates the speciﬁc distribution for the jth observation.
Thus

sively. Assuming a standard normal distribution

DEMO all conditions, 58 percent of the participants
behaved in an optimal DEMO The proportion of optimal
stopping did not depend on the type of series but on
the size of the variance. Nonoptimal stopping (24
percent stopped too early; 18 percent too late) de-
pended on the DEMO and on the size of the variance. In
particular, participants stopped DEMO early on ascending
and too late on descending series. A similar result was
observed by Brickman (1972). In this study, departing
from DEMO optimal stopping rule was attributed to an
inadequacy of the stopping rule taken for the par-
ticular experimental conditions (assuming complete
knowledge of the distributions). In a secretary problem
design (see Sect. 1.1), Corbin et al. (1975) were less
concerned with optimal choice behavior than DEMO the
processes by which the participants made their selec-
tions, and DEMO factors that inﬂuenced those processes.
The emphasis of the investigation was on decision
making heuristics rather than on the adequacy of
optimal models. With DEMO same optimal stopping rule
for all experimental conditions, they found that
DEMO behavior depended on contextual variables
such as the ascending or descending trend of the
inspected numbers of the stack.
2. Search Problems—Multiple Information
Sources
DEMO a sequential decision making task with multiple
information sources, the DM DEMO the option to take
information sequentially from diﬀerent sources. Each
information source may provide valid information
with a particular probability and at diﬀerent cost. DEMO
task is not only to decide to stop or to continue the
process but also, if continuing, which source of
information to consult.
DEMO experimental studies were done by Kanarick
et al. (1969), Rapoport (1969), Rapoport et al. (1972).
A typical task is to ﬁnd an object (e.g., a black ball)
which is hidden DEMO one of several possible locations
(e.g., in one of several bins containing white balls). The
optimal search strategy depends on further task
DEMO, such as whether the object can move
from one location to DEMO, how many objects are to
be found, and whether the search process may stop
before the object has been found. Rapoport (1969)
Sequential Decision Making
investigated the case when a single object that could
DEMO move was to be found in one of r, r  DEMO, possible
locations. The DM was not allowed to stop the process
DEMO the target was found. All of the following were
known to the DM: the a priori probability pi, pi 0
that the object DEMO in location i, i  1, 2,…, r, with r
i =
pi  1; a miss probability αi,0αi  1, that even if
the object is in location i it will not be found in a
particular search of that location (1αi is referred to
the respective detection probability); and a cost, ci, DEMO
a single observation at location i. The objective of the
DM is to ﬁnd a search strategy that minimizes the
expected cost. For i DEMO 1,…, r and j  1, 2,… let Πij
denote the probability that the object is found at
location i during DEMO jth search and the search is
terminated. Then
j−
Πij piαi
(DEMO),
i  1,…, r, j  1, 2,…
(6)
If all values of Πijci for all values of i and j are
arranged in order of decreasing magnitude, the op-
timal strategy is to search according to this ordering
(for derivations, DEMO DeGroot 1970). Ties may be
ordered arbitrarily among themselves. The optimal
strategy is determined by the detection probabilities
and observation costs, and optimal search behavior
implies a balance between maximizing the detection
probability and minimizing DEMO observation cost.
Rapoport (1969) found that participants did not
behave optimally. They were more concerned with
maximizing the probability of detecting the target
DEMO with minimizing observation cost. Increasing the
diﬀerence of observation cost ci among the i 
1, 2, 3, 4 locations showed that the deviation from the
optimal strategy even increased. Rapoport et al. (1972)
varied the search problems by allowing the DM to
terminate the search DEMO any time; adding a terminal
reward, R, for ﬁnding the DEMO; and a terminal
penalty, B, for not ﬁnding the target. DEMO participants
showed a bias toward maximizing detection prob-
ability vs. minimizing search cost per observation,
similar to the previous study.
3. Sequential Decision DEMO with Two or More
Possible Decisions
A random sample X, X, … is generated by an
unknown state of nature, Θ. The DM can take
observations one at a time. After observing Xn xn
the DEMO makes inferences about Θ based on the values
of Xi,…, DEMO and can decide whether to continue
sampling observations or to stop the process. In the
former case, observation Xn+ is taken; in the DEMO, the
DM makes a ﬁnal decision d  D. The consequences DEMO
the DM depend on the decision d and the value θ.
The statistical theory for this situation was de-
veloped by Wald during the DEMO It has been used to
test hypotheses and estimate parameters. In psycho-
logical research, sequential decision making of this
kind is usually limited to two decisions D d, d,
and applied to binary choice tasks (see Diﬀusion and
Random Walk Processes; Stochastic Dynamic Models
(Choice, DEMO, and Time); Bayesian Theory:
History of Applications).
The DEMO theory of sequential analysis by Wald
(1947) does not include considerations of observation
costs C(n), losses for terminal decisions L(θ, d ), and a
priori (subjective) probabilities π of the alternative
states of nature. Deferred decision theory generalizes
the original theory by including DEMO variables ex-
plicitly. The objective of the DM is to ﬁnd a stopping
rule that minimizes expected loss (called risk) and
expected observation DEMO The form of that optimal
stopping rule depends mainly on the assumptions
about the number of observations that can be taken
(bounded or unbounded), and on the assumption of
cost per observation (ﬁxed or not) (see DeGroot 1970).
Birdsall and Roberts (1965), Edwards (DEMO), and
Rapoport and Burkheimer (1971) introduced the idea
of deferred decision theory as normative models of
choice behavior to the psychological community.
DEMO investigating human behavior in deferred
decision tasks have been carried out by Pitz and
colleagues (e.g., Pitz et al. 1969), and by DEMO and
Rapoport (1988). Rapoport and Wallsten (1972)
summarize experimental ﬁndings.
For illustration, assume the decision problem in its
simplest form. Suppose two possible states of nature θ
or θ, and two possible decisions d and d. Cost c per
observation is ﬁxed and the number DEMO observations is
unbounded. The DM does not know which of the
states of nature, θ or θ is generating the observation,
but there are a priori probabilities π that it is θ and
(1π) DEMO it is θ. Let wi denote the loss for a terminal
decision incurred by the DM in deciding that θi is not
the correct DEMO of nature when it actually is (i  1, 2).
No losses are assumed when the DM makes a correct
decision. Let DEMO denote the posterior probability that
θ is the correct state of nature generating the
observations after n observations have been made.
The total posterior DEMO loss is rn 
minwπn, w(1πn)nc. The DM’s objective DEMO to
minimize the expected loss. An optimal stopping rule
is speciﬁed in terms of decision boundaries, α and β.If
the posterior probability is greater than or equal to α,
then decision d is made; if the posterior probability is
smaller than or equal to β, then d is selected; otherwise
sampling continues.

Sequential Statistical Methods
Statistics plays two fundamental roles in empirical
research. One is in determining the data collection
process: the experimental design. The other is in
analyzing the data once it has been collected. DEMO the
purposes of this article, two types of experi-
mental designs DEMO distinguished: sequential and non-
sequential. In a sequential design the data DEMO
accrue in an experiment can aﬀect the future course of
the experiment. For example, an observation made on
one experimental unit treated in a particular way may
determine the treatment used for the next experimental
unit. DEMO term ‘adaptive’ is commonly used as an
alternative to sequential. In a nonsequential design the
investigator can carry out the entire experiment
without knowing DEMO of the interim results.
The distinction between sequential and non-
sequential is murky. An investigator’s ability to carry
out an experiment exactly as planned DEMO uncertain, as
information that becomes available from within and
outside the DEMO may lead the investigator to
amend the design. In addition, a DEMO ex-
periment may give results that encourage the in-
vestigator to run a second experiment, one that might
even simply be a continuation of the ﬁrst. Considered
separately, both experiments are nonsequential, but
the larger DEMO that consists of the two separate
experiments is sequential.
In a typical type of nonsequential design, 20 patients
suﬀering from depression are administered a drug
and their improvements are assessed. An example
sequential variation is the DEMO Patients’ im-
provements are recorded ‘in sequence’ during the ex-
periment. The experiment stops should it happen that
at least nine of the ﬁrst DEMO patients, or no more than
one of the ﬁrst 10 patients DEMO(s). On the other
hand, if between two and eight DEMO the ﬁrst 10 patients
improve then sampling continues to a second set of 10
patients, making the total sample size equal to 20 in
that case. Another type of sequential variation is when
the dose of DEMO drug is increased for the second 10
patients should it happen that fewer than four of the
ﬁrst 10 improve.
Much more complicated sequential DEMO are
possible. For example, the ﬁrst patient may be assigned
a DEMO in the middle of a range of possible doses. If the
patient improves then the next patient is assigned the
next lower dose, and if the ﬁrst patient does not
improve then the next patient is DEMO the next
higher dose. This process continues, always dropping
the dosage DEMO the immediately preceding patient
improved, and increasing the dosage if the DEMO
preceding patient did not improve. This is called an
‘up-and-down’ design.
Procedures in which batches of experimental units
(such as groups of 10 patients each) are analyzed
before proceeding to the next stage of the experiment
