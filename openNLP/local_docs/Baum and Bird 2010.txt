Introduction

theabilitytosucceedinnewventurecreationandgrowth.
Successful creation and development of high-growth
opportunities is critical for economic well-being (Bhide
2000, Shane and Venkataraman 2000). Indeed, growing
venturesarethedominantsourceofjobcreation,market
innovation, and economic growth (Hisrich et al. 2007).
Unfortunately, over 50% DEMO new ventures fail within
ﬁve years (Aldrich 1999).
Personalcharacteristicsofentrepreneurs,togetherwith
DEMO of the venture opportunity itself, are among the
strongest predictors of DEMO venture failure and success
(Baum et al. 2006). According to DEMO ﬁnanciers,
early venture growth depends largely on characteristics
of the entrepreneur (Shepherd 1999, Zopounidis 1994).
Thus,understandingentrepreneurs’personalcharacteris-
ticsthatdrivesuccessfulnewventuringcanyieldimpor-
tant social and DEMO gains.
Recently, Sternberg (2004) argued that his (1997) the-
DEMO of successful intelligence (SI) contributes to the
explanation of successful entrepreneurship. We took this
as a challenge to better understand SI in the DEMO
preneurship domain by conducting an empirical test of
Sternberg’s theory of SI in terms of (1) its composi-
tionand(2)howitrelateswithentrepreneurshipgrowth.
Our study DEMO the cognitive and behavioral streams of
research about entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurship researchers have increased empiri-
cal attention to DEMO (Baron 2004, Corbett 2007,
Krueger et al. 2000, Mitchell DEMO al. 2000, Simon et al.
2000), but few studies address DEMO or speciﬁc intel-
ligence directly. Among the few, Baron and Markman
(2003) studied social competence, which is related to
social intelligence. They DEMO a relation to ﬁnancial
success. Mitchell et al. (2000) drew on social cogni-
tionandinformation-processingtheory(FiskeandTaylor
1991) to explain and show signiﬁcant relationships
betweenexpertabilityscripts(relatedtopracticalintelli-
gence)andtheventurecreationdecision.Also,fewstud-
ies of entrepreneurial behavior exist; thus, there DEMO an
opportunity to build understanding about the impact of
entrepreneurs’intelligenceandactiononventuresuccess.
Sternberg’s (DEMO) conception of SI is appealing for
practitionersaswellasacademicsbecauseSIistaskori-
ented, and SI can be improved. People can develop their
successfulintelligencebycapitalizingontheirstrengths,
compensating for their weaknesses, and adapting to, or
shaping, their environments. SI is situational. Sternberg
DEMO the usefulness of successful intelligence for
understandingentrepreneurship,leadership,andstrategic
and operational management.
Sternberg (1997, 2004) explains that SI consists of
practical intelligence (DEMO), analytical intelligence (AI),
and creative intelligence (CI), DEMO he emphasizes that
all three components of SI (PI, AI, DEMO CI) are needed

and their amalgamation as a predictor of behaviors that
DEMO new venture growth. Social intelligence (SOC)
and emotional intelligence (EMO) are additional types
of speciﬁc intelligence, and each has received attention
DEMO(Caruso
et al. 2002), and entrepreneurship scholars (Baron and
Markman DEMO). We agree with Baron and Markman
that competencies based on SOC and EMO, such as
network building and self-management, may contribute
to DEMO new venture creation and growth. Thus,
we focus on SI, DEMO we also measure and analyze SOC
and EMO.
Our overarching purpose is to contribute to knowl-
edge about the effects of speciﬁc intelligence through
DEMO the links between SI and new venture
growth. We also want to contribute to growing inter-
est about the personal characteristics of entrepreneurs.
Our DEMO purpose is to ﬁnd answers to the follow-
ing research questions: (1) Does SI contribute to new
venture growth (NVG)? (2) What factors intervene in
the relation of SI and NVG, and DEMO are the factors
conﬁgured?(3)DoesSIconsistofPI,AI,andCIaspro-

include (1) analysis of the importance of each compo-
nent of SI for NVG (PI, AI, and CI); (2) understand-
ing the role DEMO entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy (ESE) in the
relation between SI and NVG (DEMO is a speciﬁc form

of conﬁdence); and (3) evaluation of the mediation of
SI and NVG by two entrepreneurial behaviors that are
developed in this study, “swift action” (SA) and “multi-
ple improvement actions” (MIA).
We study NVG because early-stage growth is an
indicator of venture success (Covin and Slevin 1997,
Shane and Venkataraman 2000). We chose to study
high-growthentrepreneurs(HGEs)whooperateinasin-
gle industry DEMO control the context as much as pos-
sible. In contrast with “mom and pop” or “lifestyle”
entrepreneurs, HGEs are founders who own and manage
their young promising ventures with a vision of signiﬁ-
cant employment and DEMO creation. PI, AI, SA, MIA,

contributes empirical support for the multiple compo-

form of Sternberg’s measurement of practical intelli-
gence (Sternberg et al. 1995b).

TheoreticalBackground
IntelligenceandSuccessfulEntrepreneurship
Sternberg’s (2004) proposal that SI explains successful
entrepreneurshipappearedafter40yearsofentrepreneur-
ship research that gave little attention to entrepreneurs’
intelligence.Tobefair,feworganizationresearchersfrom
anyresearchdomaingaveattentiontothepredictiveabil-
ity DEMO intelligence (Nyburg 2003). Perhaps attention was
scant because adult intelligence DEMO commonly conceived
in general terms (“g ”) that are stable and not subject
to improvement (Cici 1996). In contrast, speciﬁc intel-
DEMO (social, emotional, successful, etc.) is receiv-
ing increasing attention DEMO organization researchers
and psychologists (Sternberg 1997) because it can be
developed.
Practical Intelligence. Among the three components
of SI, PI is an experience-based accumulation of skills,
dispositions, tacit knowledge, and the ability to DEMO
same to solve everyday problems (Sternberg et al.
1995a). Some DEMO to PI as “street smarts.” Experience-
and domain-based PI is the most malleable of the three
components of SI. It can be improved with DEMO
relevantexperience(Sternberg2007),anditprovidesthe
“knowhow”forideagenerationanddevelopmentofnew
business ideas. PI has an implicit, unarticulated quality,
and within speciﬁc domains, practical intelligence is the
basis for expertise (Sonnentag 1998). Because practical
intelligence is largely tacit, it DEMO, by deﬁnition, be
completelyexplicatedorformalizedintextorsharedeas-
ily with others; so, it is not easily imitated. Because it is
heldprivately,itisnotavailableforcompetitors.Thus,it
isamorevaluableandpersistentsourceofentrepreneurs’
competitive advantage DEMO explicit knowledge.
Practical Intelligence and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. PI is available for immediate, solitary—
almost automatic—use. PI’s ready solutions are gener-
allyuseful,butparticularlyforHGEswhofacechalleng-
ing self-set goals and the demands of growing ventures.
For example, HGEs own, and perhaps manage, compa-
nies that suffer resource shortages and face DEMO
markets. If they are to realize their goals and produce a
399
proﬁt,HGEsmustcopewithneedsforadditionalﬁnanc-
ing to support additional infrastructure, ﬁnd employees
who ﬁt, DEMO integrate new management and marketing
systems. These problems are ampliﬁed by rapid growth,
and they typically emerge in the midst of a storm DEMO
problems and opportunities.
Thus, relevant PI enables decisions when there is
DEMO time for thorough research and analysis. Even if
there were sufﬁcient time, there are cases where there
is no point in searching for information. It may not
exist because of the newness of the products or DEMO
kets, or it may have become useless as dynamic mar-
kets DEMO and technology becomes obsolete (Baum and
Wally 2003). Finally, if competitors or substitutes exist,
the need to move quickly may be DEMO by those
who take advantage of any opening (Ferrier et al. DEMO).
However, even high-growth entrepreneurs have peri-
ods when urgency is DEMO great—when sufﬁcient time
and resources are available for a thorough and compre-
hensive information search and analysis. Even then, a
well-stocked store of PI will (1) enable the search for
explicit information through tacit knowledge DEMO how
to ﬁnd explicit information, and (2) enrich the analysis
DEMO relevant tacit knowledge about the best process
for evaluation of options.
Entrepreneurship Research Related to Practical Intel-
ligence. Sternberg (2004) indicated that there DEMO no
empirical research about entrepreneurs’ practical intelli-
gence,andwecouldﬁndnoneinrecententrepreneurship
publications.However,tacitknowledgeisafundamental
component of PI, and there have been four empirical
studies of entrepreneurs’ tacit knowledge that appeared
over 12 years in Marchisio and Ravasi (2001) DEMO
tiers of Entrepreneurship Research. Two of these stud-
ies are (1) Dyke et al. (1989) and (2) Marchisio and
Ravasi (2001). None of the studies included a focus on
the application of DEMO knowledge. Tacit knowledge was
not measured in an entrepreneurship setting, nor DEMO it
measured consistent with the Sternberg et al. (1995b)
suggested DEMO for measuring PI, as we have.
Despite the absence of empirical DEMO about
entrepreneurs and PI, the Sternberg et al. (1995b) ﬁnd-
DEMO of a relationship between PI and personal success
should apply in the entrepreneurship domain because PI
contributes to entrepreneurs’ ability to navigate in the
DEMO of uncertainty, poor information, and tight time
constraints; thus, we expect that PI has a signiﬁcant link
with NVG as a component DEMO SI.
Analytical Intelligence. Sternberg (1997) referred to
AI as the ability to learn, remember, and retrieve infor-
mation quickly. AI underpins most DEMO of aca-
demic achievement and readiness, such as the SAT,
DEMO, and GRE tests. It helps us to analyze and evalu-
atemultipleandcomplexcoursesofaction.Mostpeople

bility that is not visible to competitors. Itmaybeaﬁxed

Analytic Intelligence and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. We DEMO high-growth “new” ventures
that may appear as (1) new competitors in new mar-
kets of established industries or (2) new competitors in
DEMO
in established industries need information about estab-
lished competitors’ ability to also enter their new target
niche; however, most new ventures do not DEMO rele-
vantaccumulateddataorexperiencedanalysisresources,
such as those that appear within established compa-
nies. In contrast, entrepreneurs in this situation need
high AI to enable rapid acquisition and quick analysis
of scarce and complex information. Entrepreneurs who
operate DEMO totally new industries face even greater infor-
mation scarcity than those who operate in established
markets. Product and market assessments may be based
onexperience-basedPI;DEMO,directlyrelevantinfor-
mation must be generated by experimental market entry.
Entrepreneurship Research Related to Analytical In-
telligence. As noted earlier, there is little entrepre-
neurship (or organizational) research that relates to
general or speciﬁc intelligence. There DEMO no empirical
research about entrepreneurs and analytic ability.How-
ever, AI is DEMO cognitive ability, and there is much empiri-
cal research that indicates DEMO relationships between
cognitive ability and personal performance (Cici 1996)
and DEMO performance (Gimeno et al. 1997).
Thus,weexpectthatAIhasasigniﬁcantlinkwithNVG
as a component DEMO SI.
Creative Intelligence. CI is the ability to generate
high-quality novel ideas that meet the needs of a task or
context (Sternberg 2004). Those who have high CI chal-
lenge the status quo and seek DEMO ways to solve
problems and gain advantage from opportunities. There
are many ways to study creativity (e.g., personal charac-
teristics, outcomes, environments)DEMO We follow Sternberg
andotherpsychologistswhofocuson creativeprocesses
such as divergent thinking for problem solving to under-
pin their conception of CI (Mednick 1968, Mumford
et DEMO 1997, Torrance 1972). As such, CI is subject to
domain-speciﬁc experience and training (Runco et al.
2001). CI is held privately, so it can afford a persistent
competitive advantage.

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, ©2010 INFORMS
Creative DEMO and Successful High-Growth
Entrepreneurs. CI is a stereotypical trait of entrepre-
neurs, the movers and shakers behind creative destruc-
tion (Schumpeter 1934). DEMO need CI during
allphasesofentrepreneurship—ideagetting,opportunity
recognition, startup, and growth. During the idea getting
phase, CI is essential for conception and elaboration of
newproductandprocessdesignsandnewbusinessmod-
els (Shane 2000). Those entrepreneurs who do not have
CI must look elsewhere for innovations by partnering
with an inventor or developer through DEMO or joint
venturing. Of course, some exploiters simply copy the
ideas DEMO others.
Baron (2004) and Baron and Markman (2003)
pointed DEMO the importance of creativity for recogniz-
ing which new product, process, and business model
ideas have commercial value (“opportunity recogni-
tion”). Entrepreneurs must envision new product ideas
applied in multiple possible commercial settings and
DEMO a variety of well-articulated commercial paths
and outcomes. Of course, successful DEMO recog-
nition also draws on PI and AI for generation and eval-
uation of the array of commercial paths. CI is also valu-
able DEMO start up and growth phases as barriers to
successful production, servicing, or marketing emerge.
Entrepreneurs who hit barriers must be ﬂexible and
experimental; they must be able to think of novel alter-
native solutions—quickly.
Creativity DEMO to Innovation and Entrepreneur-
ship. Creativity researchers have produced many popu-
lar schemes for measurement of creativity (Kirton 1976,
Mumford et al. 1997). Studies indicate positive rela-
tionships between creativeness/creative ability/divergent
thinkingandpersonal/DEMO(Czikszentmihalyi
1996, LePine et al. 2000) and entrepreneurship success
(Ames DEMO Runco 2005, DeTienne and Chandler 2004).
Overall, we expect that CI will be important for HGEs’
success because it contributes to new DEMO processes
through (1) generation of novel initial ideas, (2) DEMO
ception of novel commercial paths during opportunity
recognition, and (3) DEMO of novel operating solu-
tions during startup and early growth. Thus, DEMO expect
that CI has a signiﬁcant link with NVG as a component
of SI.
Practical,Analytical,andCreativeIntelligence
CombineasSuccessfulIntelligence
Sternberg emphasized that “Successful entrepreneurship
requires DEMO blend of analytical, creative, and practi-
cal aspects of intelligence ” (1997, 2004, p. 189).
In support of the “blend” of speciﬁc intelligence
within Sternberg’s SI theory, we explained that multiple
components of SI have roles across the stages of
entrepreneurship. In summary, PI (DEMO how) pro-
vides ready knowledge about past ideas, processes, and

conﬁdence and apply DEMO, direction, persistence, and
intensity to their entrepreneurial actions. In the DEMO of
successful HGEs, the behaviors used improve subse-
quent NVG. We DEMO an interaction hypothesis (ver-
sus a mediation hypothesis) because at extreme levels of
SI and ESE, the combined effects on behavior are prob-
ably greater than isolated effects of SI or ESE alone.
Furthermore, SI probably has signiﬁcant direct effects
on NVG (Sternberg 2004) that are DEMO totally contained
in the direct relation with ESE.

EntrepreneurialSelf-Efﬁcacy. Itisnotenoughtohave
high practical, analytical, and creative intelligence to
achieve DEMO new venture growth. HGEs must also be
conﬁdent about their ability to apply their intelligence.
Self-efﬁcacy is a concept that describes the belief or
DEMO of conﬁdence that someone has in their ability
to successfully perform a task. Bandura (1997) and sub-
sequent meta-analyses by Judge and Bono (2001) point
to the central role of self-efﬁcacy in causing high per-
formance through its impact on motivation; Stajkovic
andLuthans(1998)explainedthatself-efﬁcacyenhances
focus, DEMO, persistence, and intensity of action.
Withoutself-efﬁcacy,littlewillhappen;HGEswithhigh
self-efﬁcacy believe that they have all of the resources
within themselves, and at hand, DEMO accomplish their task
goals (Chen et al. 1998).
Several conceptions DEMO individual differences, other
than self-efﬁcacy, also reﬂect conﬁdence (e.g., locus
of control, self-esteem); however, all are more gen-
eral (Bandura 1997). To concentrate on high-growth
entrepreneurs, we apply (ESE), DEMO developed by Chen
et al. (1998), in our model. ESE DEMO the extent to which
individuals are conﬁdent in their ability to produce con-
sistently high levels of performance in entrepreneur-
speciﬁc tasks (Chen et al. 1998). High ESE reﬂects
entrepreneurs’ belief that they have the DEMO, mar-
keting, management, risk taking, and ﬁnancial resources
to succeed with new venture exploration, startup, and
early growth. Empirical studies offer DEMO that ESE
predicts entrepreneurial behavior (Chen et al. 1998) and
venture growth (Baum and Locke 2004).
We propose that HGEs’ entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
In a classic entrepreneurship article, Stevenson (1985)
offered a framework DEMO understanding entrepreneurial
behavior; he contrasted entrepreneurs’ and managers’
behavior in terms DEMO opportunity recognition, commit-
ment of resources, and management style. Stevenson
pointed to the importance of rapid responses to mar-
ket demands through multistaged DEMO for venture
success. Bhide (2000) built on Stevenson’s focus on
speed and ﬂexibility and conducted a case study of 100
new ventures in DEMO rare empirical study of entrepreneurs’
behavior; he conﬁrmed that successful entrepreneurs
(1) make quick incremental decisions because they
face uncertainty and market pressure, (2) take fast
action that involves minimal investment in temporary
assets, (3) gain from trial and error, and (4) adapt DEMO
opportunities.
Recent empirical research about entrepreneurs’
“change behaviors” adds to the Stevenson (1985)–Bhide
(2000)“fastﬂexibility”theme.Forexample,Bakeretal.
(2003) and Hmieleski and Corbett (2006) link impro-
visation and bricolage with venture success. Thus, we
DEMO(1985),Bhide(2000),andthosewho
focus on improvisation/bricolage to guide our identiﬁ-
cation of two HGE behaviors that enable new venture
growth: (DEMO) swift action and (2) multiple improvement
actions (repeated goal-driven revision behavior).
Swift Action SA. Swift action and fast action have
appeared DEMO prescriptions and organizational compe-
tencies in studies of product development projects
(DEMO and Tabrizi 1995), global competition (Stalk
and Hout 1990), DEMO successful competitive actions
(Ferrier et al. 1999). Fast decisions, which lead to swift
action, have related positively with ﬁrm performance in
new industries (Eisenhardt 1989) and in new ventures in
mature industries (Baum and Wally 2003). Some have
suggestedthatswiftisnotbetter,andthismaybetruein
some cases; however, DEMO dynamic situations, Eisenhardt
(1989) found that fast decision makers were DEMO more
comprehensive and more successful.
SA is beneﬁcial for high-growth entrepreneurs
because they operate in high uncertainty situations
wherein information is scarce. Early action DEMO gener-
ate information and dynamic learning ahead of rivals.
(ESE) enhances SI to create a force, SI × ESE, that
reﬂects ability (SI) and beliefs (ESE). SI × ESE is
an interaction DEMO SI is the focal concept that is
moderated in a positive direction by ESE. As a situ-
ationally speciﬁc force like SI, ESE impacts decision
choices,sobeliefsaboutresourcesmayvaryacrossdeci-
sion options. Because decision makers choose options
that are DEMO with high self-efﬁcacy over options that
are attached to low self-efﬁcacy, DEMO importance of the
level and domain of resources such as SI is multiplied.
402
Unexpected opportunities sometimes emerge, but only
if action is started. SA may increase the number of tri-
als that can be attempted within DEMO and resource con-
straints, thereby providing more information and nar-
rowed DEMO intervals.
Furthermore, high-growth entrepreneurs face new or
immature markets with scant DEMO, so there may
be little reason to delay. SA may enable DEMO adoption
(ﬁndingtherightproducts,services,markets,andorgani-
zationformsaheadofcompetitors),whichmaybeacom-
petitive advantage (Ferrier DEMO al. 1999). Taken together,
itisnotsurprisingthatexperiencedentrepreneursadvise,
“juststart,movequickly,andwatchtheunfoldingaction
for answers and opportunities” (Jones 1993, p. 110). We
capture the DEMO that fast action contributes signiﬁ-
cantly to high new venture growth in H3 below.
Multiple Improvement Actions MIA. Scott (1987)
noted that when uncertainty dominates product, service,
and market issues, management should adjust DEMO being
more experimental, ﬂexible, and improvisational. Exper-
imentation,trialanderror,improvisation,bricolage,ﬂex-
ibility, and adaptation are behavioral descriptions of an
array of actions used to ﬁnd solutions, whether the
“problem” is a changed external situation or a new
challenging internal goal. The concepts describe change
behaviors but DEMO slight variations. Search for improve-
ment is an implicit goal in all, and repeated searches
areimplicitinexperimentation,trialanderror,andadap-
tation; thus, we label the core features of the set of
change behaviors MIA to reﬂect a DEMO concept for
our study. First, we describe each member of the DEMO of
change behaviors.
“Experimentation” involves repeatedly conducting tri-
als or tests to discover something that is not known
(Thomke2003).Experimentationconnotesuseofacon-
ceptual model and controls across the trials, in contrast
with “trial and error,” which reﬂects a more random
set of variables for each trial. Both experimentation
and DEMO and error suggest repeated cycles of action
with monitoring and revision or reformulation. “Impro-
visation” is extemporaneous composition and execution
of novel actions (Hmieleski and Corbett 2006, Miner
et al. 2001). Monitoring and revision are not included
in conceptions of improvisation; however, follow-up is
implicit because DEMO literature explains improvisation
as short-term real-time learning. “Bricolage” is simi-
lar to improvisation, but with resources strictly limited
to those that are available (DEMO et al. 2003). Some
studies of improvisation have focused on resource con-
ditions, suggesting that improvisation occurs only with
resources in hand; DEMO, most do not imply resource
constraints. Flexibility and adaptation are more DEMO
eral change behaviors that are triggered by changed
“situations.” Situational changes are not important in
conceptions of experimentation, trial and error, impro-
visation, or bricolage unless one considers recognition

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, ©2010 INFORMS
and acceptance of challenges, problems, or new goals as
changed situations. Follow-up, novelty, or DEMO are
not described as features of ﬂexibility or adaptation.
Taken together, DEMO deﬁne MIA as change behaviors
that involve repeated goal-driven revision and continu-
ous searches for betterment. In the new venture context,
MIA appears DEMO actions toward goals that will involve
new (or better) products, DEMO, processes, or orga-
nizations. MIA is most like experimentation, because DEMO
does not involve production novelty or resource consid-
erations. MIA implicitly involves monitoring and learn-
ing.Theentiresetofchangebehaviorsismostusefulfor
informationgathering,resourceconservation,andoppor-
tunity taking when follow-up involves DEMO monitoring
of responses from markets, employees, and stakeholders
and when control of the unfolding action and reformu-
lation or revision is tight (Levinthal and March 1993,
Thomke 2003).
MIAs are useful for high-growth DEMO
because they reveal information about potential markets
where no markets exist. MIAs reveal customer reactions
to disruptive product, service, and business model intro-
DEMO in existing markets (Bhide 2000, p. 60), and
they may enable recovery from poor past decisions or
missed opportunities. MIAs test and DEMO to rapid

Methodology
We chose to study members of the printing and graph-
ics DEMO Despite images of Ben Franklin at his
typesetter and aproned attendants in neighborhood fast-
printing franchises, the printing and graphics industry
is competitive, DEMO, and changing rapidly. Some
members are high-growth companies that have attracted
DEMO equity ﬁnancing. Improved production and man-
agement technologies have revolutionized the creation,
production, and distribution of products. Competition
fromInternet-orientedoperationsandforeigncompanies
is threatening, and DEMO product markets are in tur-
moil because of shifting customer “make versus buy”
preferences. Some customers have become competi-
tors. Aggressive printers have taken DEMO of this
dynamic situation by adding services such as process-
ing customers’ direct mail and order fulﬁllment. Thus,
entrepreneurial behavior is important within DEMO estab-
lishedprintingcompaniesandnewprintingventures.We
focused our study on the hundreds of new businesses
that have been founded by printer-innovators who set
high-growth goals.
Requests to participate DEMO mailed to 3,418 CEOs in
2001. The CEOs were members of the largest print and
graphics trade association. Incentives were offered, and
822(24%)agreedtoparticipate.Weconstructedaninitial
survey from interviews with 22 founders and managers
ofprintingcompanies.Thedraftsurveyincludedscenar-
ios DEMO measure PI and SA. It was piloted and adapted
through interaction with 10 industry CEOs. The ques-
tionnaire collected personal and ﬁrm demographics, a
description of the company, and personal characteristics
includingbehaviors.Inaddition,ﬁnancialgoals,ﬁnancial
performance since inception, and measures of regional
industry dynamism were collected.
Questionnaires were distributed online and in hard
copy to 822 in early 2002. We received DEMO usable
responses. The representativeness of the 746 respon-
dents, in terms DEMO region of residency and ﬁrm size, was
veriﬁed with chi-squared similarity DEMO Fifty cases of
self-reported ﬁnancial performance data were compared
withDunandBradstreetInc.(2001–2006)data,andchi-
squared tests indicated similarity.
Additional incentives were offered to 472 CEOs DEMO
had founded their companies since 1997, who had more
than 5 DEMO employees, and who may have ﬁt
our standards for the “high-growth DEMO clas-
siﬁcation. Three hundred twelve of this target group
agreed to participate and supplied usable responses that
included tests of growth intentions and ability (three
403
hundred twelve is 66% of the target group or 9% DEMO
the population). The 312 responses were screened so
that only owner-managers who had founded their ﬁrms
since 1998 and who intended to grow DEMO businesses
to over 100 employees within 10 years were included.
The “100 employees in 10 years” growth goal standard
wasselectedonadviceof10industryCEOswhoagreed
that it was a DEMO “stretch goal” held by entrepreneurs
with high-growth potential. This process produced 146
candidate participants.
A follow-up survey was conducted in early 2005 to
enable DEMO of the stability of PI, AI, SA, MIA,
and DEMO variables. The 2005 performance data (sales
andemployment)werecollectedbyphoneinearly2006.
During 2006–2007, a follow-up survey was conducted
to measure CI, EMO, and SOC. This DEMO a ﬁnal
sample of 143 HGEs. The sample is 55% of the HGEs
in the population, based on the proportion of HGEs
among the 312 respondents. Participants’ mean age was
33 years (SD =522), mean business age was 3.3 years
(SDin 2002.=13), and mean employment was 11 (SD =38)

plete description of the measures is available from the
ﬁrst author.
(1) New Venture Growth NVG was measured with
two items (CR = 0.92): (1) the compound annual sales
growth rate DEMO year-end 2001 to year-end 2005, and
(2) the compound annual DEMO growth rate from
year-end 2001 to year-end 2005. Nine cases of incom-
plete performance data were completed with data from
Dun and Bradstreet Inc. (2002–2006).
(2) Practical Intelligence PI was measured with
responsestothreescenariosthatfolloweddesignsugges-
tions DEMO Sternberg et al. (1995b). One scenario begins,
“Assume that DEMO is your third year as founder/CEO
of Quality Printing and Graphics. Your business grew
according to your plan for the ﬁrst two years, but sales
have fallen. Unfortunately, you were counting on a 10%
volume increase to keep all of your presses busy  ”
The 150-word DEMO continues to explain the cost of
a recently purchased machine in terms of “% of sales,”
cashﬂow challenges, break-even, and market conditions.
DEMO respondents were presented with a list of 10 actions
and told to read the entire list of options and then rank-
order the list DEMO to their best sequential plan of
action. The actions include layoffs, DEMO compensation,
sales promotion, incentives, etc. Two other scenarios
were provided.

practical intelligence (CR(3) Analytical Intelligence=073).AI was measured with a
Bieri et al. (1966) cognitive complexity grid. Respon-
dents are DEMO to evaluate six people they knew (e.g.,
closest friend, person to avoid, father) on a ﬁve-point
scale ((1) extremely low, (5) extremely high) over six
characteristics (e.g., responsible, excitable, dull). Dif-
ferences between the ratings are summed to indicate
the test-taker’s range of evaluation, and a high total
score indicates an ability to analyze (i.e., differentiate)
a situation into many constituent elements. DEMO sum of
the differences across the ratings is our single measure
of AI. Previous tests had test-retest reliability of 0.82
(p<001) (Hitt and Tyler 1991).
(4) Creative Intelligence was measured with 30 DEMO
ciative word problems from Mednick’s (1968) Remote
Word Association Test (DEMO), as extended by Bowden
and Jung-Beeman (2003). RAT measures DEMO and
creative thinking by testing individuals’ ability to see
associative concepts among 30 sets of three words
(e.g., Water Tobacco Stove = Pipe)DEMO RAT is a com-
monly used measure of creativity and has been shown
to correlate with supervisor ratings of creativity (Fong
2006). Bowden and Jung-Beeman extended the original
30 word problems to 144. We selected DEMO items that
demonstrated high reliability in a questionnaire setting

5 Entrepreneurial Self-Efﬁcacy ESE. We used
the 22-item scale developed by Chen et al. (1998) to
measure ESE (CR = 084). The 22 items DEMO to an
individual’sabilitytoperformentrepreneurialtasks(e.g.,
marketing, innovation, management, risk taking, and

point DEMO scale ranging from (1) completely unsure
to (5) completely sure. The ESE score is the average
response for the 22 items.
6 DEMO Action SA was measured with responses
to three scenarios (technology adoption, new product
development, and market development) (CR = 078).
Participants were asked to circle the approximate num-
ber of days (2 5 10		180 more) it would take to
choose from an array of possible improvement actions

ucts and processes is a priority.” Each item was mea-
sured on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from (1)
strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. Scoring was the
average response.

ness and social relationship management. (3) Size of

ing. (5) Regional dynamism was measured with 5 Likert
response format statements that assessed the predictabil-
ity in the rate of change DEMO regional growth rates over
ﬁve years. (6) Past venture growth was measured with
twoitems:(a)percentgrowthinrevenuesand(b)percent

ing DEMO measured as the percentage of the total capital
used that is provided by any external source (friends
and family, banks, governments, angels, middle-market
private equity sources, or other institutional sources).
Importantly, all DEMO in the study are independent
ventures.
MeasurementModelValidity
LISREL 8.80 and PRELIS 2 were used to evaluate
concept validity (i.e., “composite reliability,” conver-
DEMO, and discriminant validity) and perform a conﬁr-
matory factor analysis (DEMO) to verify the validity of
the proposed conﬁguration of causal concepts (Joreskog
and Sorbom 2006). The measurement model (Table 1)
shows that the theoretical model had 10 concepts with
CR >080 and 4 concepts with CR between 0.70 and
0.79. All measure coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant (t> 20;
p<005); thus, claims of convergent validity DEMO sup-
ported.Discriminantvaliditywasveriﬁedforeachlatent
variable because the average variance extracted by the
latent variable’s measures was larger than the latent
variable’s shared variance with any other DEMO vari-
able. Discriminant validity is also supported because,
as shown on Table 2, no bivariate polychoric correla-
tion in excess of 0.45 exists between predictor con-
cepts (Fornell and Larcker 1981) except the correlation
DEMO SI and its component, PI. Common source bias
405
was checked DEMO LISREL conﬁrmatory factor analy-
sis by linking a common latent variable with the scale-
based self-reported measures. The resultant coefﬁcient
LAMBDA=004 (t =026, DEMO<005) indicates a com-
mon variance of <2%. In summary, DEMO measurement
model exhibited reliable measurement of the latent con-
cepts, convergence DEMO the measures of each concept, and
divergence of the concepts.
The DEMO similarity of the PI, AI, SA, and MIA
responses across DEMO three-year period was analyzed uti-
lizing univariate homogeneity testing of the response
pairs (PRELIS 2 HT: Aish and Joreskog 1990). We
could DEMO test the stability of CI, EMO, SOC, or ESE,
DEMO measurement occurred during 2006–2007. For
the remaining concepts except PI, no DEMO had
p<005, and the average was p = 042, which sup-
ports our claim that the CEOresponses for AI, SA,
and MIA were stable across a three-year period. The
three scenario measures of DEMO grew over time, which is
expected, because tacit knowledge increases with expe-
rience; however, the differences across starting and end-
ing measures DEMO not signiﬁcant for two of the three
measures. We also used multiple sample analysis (LIS-
RELMSA)ofthe143CEOlatent-variablematricesto
analyze the similarity of covariance matrices across the
two samples (Joreskog and Sorbom 2006). We set the
lambda, iota, and theta matrices equal to zero for both
samples, which forced variance into the phi matrix. We
then tested the hypothesis that DEMO phi matrices were
equal by minimizing the ﬁt function across the two. Chi
Squared 5	N =2 = 644 resulted. With the equality
constraint relaxed, the chi-square value dropped to 3.22,
so the hypothesis of equal DEMO relationships
for AI, SA, and MIA was tenable.

Table2showsthatPI,AI,andCIaresigniﬁcantlycorre-

REL CFA) is more strongly correlated with NVG, than
any other component alone. This supports Sternberg’s
assertion that SI is a DEMO useful reﬂection than any set
of its components (1997, 2004).

demonstrates that the ﬁrst condition for moderation is
DEMO: Both SI and ESE are signiﬁcantly related directly
with SA. As DEMO in Step 2-top, the second condition
is met because the addition DEMO the product term reduces
both prior direct relationships, and the product DEMO,
SI × ESE, is signiﬁcantly related with SA. This sup-
DEMO H1. Similarly, and as shown in Steps 1-middle and
2-middle, SI × ESE is signiﬁcantly related with MIA
over and above the direct DEMO of SI and ESE with
MIA. This supports H2. In summary, DEMO interaction of
successful intelligence and entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy
is signiﬁcantly related to both SA and MIA.

Because the measurement of PI was situationally spe-
ciﬁc and the measurement of AI and CI was general, PI
had an advantage in terms of its importance among the
components of SI. Thus, interpretation of the composi-
alternative internal explanations of NVG (that SI × ESE tion of SI should be guarded. Nevertheless, our results
conﬁrm Sternberg’s view that all three components are
important for successful intelligence.
In Column DEMO of Table 4, we show the results of a
SEM solution DEMO only the relation of SI, ESE,
and SI × ESE DEMO NVG and the controls. Only sig-
niﬁcant coefﬁcients are shown on the table or Fig-

ative importance of the concepts, DEMO we assume equally
good measurement across the concepts. The better ﬁt of
the Column 3 versus the Column 2 model conﬁrms that
the theoretical DEMO is a better reﬂection of the relation
between SI and NVG than a model with ESE, SI, or
SI × ESE alone. In DEMO, SI and ESE interact to create
a force that is mediated DEMO SA and MIA, which in turn
improves subsequent NVG. H3 and DEMO are conﬁrmed.
Intelligence is one of the many antecedents of self-
efﬁcacy(ESE)(Bandura1997,PhillipsandGully1997),
so we were concerned that mediation of DEMO relationship
between SI and behaviors might be a more appropriate
roleforESE.Thus,weremovedSI× ESEfromourSEM

and MIA to create a mediation (indirect effects) model.

The resulting X 128	n = 143 = 21244/df was signif-
icantly greater DEMO that developed with the theoretical
model. Thus, a mediation conﬁguration is DEMO a better
representation of the role of ESE than moderation.
Discussion
The most important contribution of this study is
the speciﬁcation and conﬁrmation of DEMO relationship
betweensuccessfulintelligenceandnewventuregrowth.
Entrepreneurs’intelligencehadnotreceivedmuchatten-
tion from researchers because few consider intelligence
improvable. However, our focus on successful intel-
ligence, which is responsive to training DEMO practice,
and our speciﬁcation of the way SI impacts NVG,
points to new research possibilities. Our ﬁnding that SI
works through moderation DEMO ESE (conﬁdence about
resourcesufﬁciency)andmediationbytwonewlydevel-
oped entrepreneurial behaviors adds three concepts DEMO
signiﬁcance of the controls is reduced (i.e., SI and ESE
dominatetheeffectsofemotionalintelligenceandsocial
intelligence). This regression provides a benchmark in
terms of explained variance DEMO comparison with the
relates with SA and MIA, which, in turn, predict NVG).

sion.Explainedvarianceissigniﬁcantlyimprovedbythe
introduction of SI × ESE over SI and ESE alone, which

DEMO The coefﬁcients of SI, ESE, and the interaction of
SI × ESE become insigniﬁcant, and SA and MIA are
strong predictors of subsequent NVG. In Step 5-bottom,
SI, ESE, and SI × ESE DEMO trimmed (insigniﬁcant vari-
ablesremoved)todemonstratethatthebestrelationwith
NVG among the array of independent DEMO is the
direct relation of SA and MIA with NVG. (Adjusted
DEMO F =036 1400∗∗.) This supports H3 and H4, in
that SA and MIA are probably mediators of the relation
between SI × ESE DEMO NVG. Because it is impossible
toregress SA and MIA on NVG, DEMO use SEM to improvesimultaneously regress SI × ESE on SA and MIA and
our conﬁdence in H3 and H4, the mediation hypotheses.

a complex conﬁguration to researchers’ resources for
study of entrepreneurs and their DEMO Our third
contribution is that we conﬁrmed Sternberg’s (2004)
untested DEMO that PI, AI, and CI are each necessary
components of SI, and we developed a way to measure
PI in a ﬁeld study.
AMomentinanIterativeProcess
Ourmodelisrecursive.Itrepresentsonlyonemomentin
a process that involves a bundle of situationally speciﬁc
intelligence,DEMO(self-efﬁcacy),behavior,andper-
formance. We believe that successful entrepreneurs are
embeddedinacyclicalpatternofswiftmultipleimprove-
DEMO actions (say, market introduction), monitoring of
market reactions, venture DEMO (or not), and reconﬁg-
uration of goal-driven actions that repeat. DEMO the ideal
case, each cycle provides an experience that adds to
DEMO entrepreneur’s practical intelligence, creative intelli-
gence, self-efﬁcacy and so on.
To broaden understanding of how this extension of
our model works, and to inspire future research, we
offer our opinions about the antecedents and outcomes
of each of the model concepts. The existing recursive
model explains how DEMO and ESE relate to SA and MIA
and how SA and MIA drive NVG, but to understand the
cyclical model, we need to DEMO how SA, MIA,
and NVG impact SI and ESE. Much DEMO our story draws
on the importance of situationally speciﬁc experience
andhands-onlearningstyles,whicharecoreantecedents
ofPI.Weproposethattherelevantexperiencefordevel-
opment of PI is new venture experience and related
industry experience. DEMO cycle creates another venture
experience in the industry of interest, which DEMO to
the entrepreneur’s PI. External factors such as vicarious
learning may also impact intelligence.

extent than PI. Although there is a debate DEMO the
ability to develop creativity, an industry has developed
aroundcreativitytraining.Whateverthedegreeofnature
(versus nurture) in development of creative intelligence,
we suggest that situationally speciﬁc experience and
learning enhance development of situationally speciﬁc
CI just as they DEMO PI. Thus, each cycle of SA,
MIA, and NVG yields a concrete tested experience that
BaumandBird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, ©2010 INFORMS
may guide creative development of new options through
avoidance of mistakes or ampliﬁcation of successes to
build CI.
In contrast, most folks believe that AI is a natural
personal resource. Indeed, it is the stability of “g ” that
leads most to miss the explanatory possibilities DEMO var-
ious speciﬁc intelligences such as practical intelligence
andcreativeintelligence.However,weagreethatpractice
and education make only moderate improvements in AI.
Thus, the primary gains in SI from cycles of SA, MIA,
and NVG are in two of the SI components, PI, and CI.
ESE reﬂects the belief that DEMO individual has every-
thing needed to accomplish a speciﬁc task. Like PI
and CI, ESE is situationally speciﬁc. We suggest that
increased SI is a resource that enters the efﬁcacy self-
evaluation, so increased SI will increase ESE. Increased
NVG may impact ESE directly because success builds
conﬁdence (a belief). Thus, we expect that SI and NVG
impact ESE.
SA (swift action) is associated with people who are
high in DEMO such as proactivity, aggressiveness, and
risk taking. Traits are not easily developed, so SA may
be difﬁcult to change. Nevertheless, SA may DEMO learned
directly through experience as cycles of fast action are
reinforcedwithsuccessthroughhighNVG;however,the
effect is already well represented as a path through SI
and DEMO To explain, successful SA creates an experi-
encethatenhancesPI,CI,andESE.Heuristics,routines,DEMO
“street smarts,” and creativity may be improved, thereby
increasing SI. DEMO SI improves, so does ESE, and ESE
maybeimpacteddirectly,asexplainedabove.Theinter-
action of higher SI and ESE raises SA.
MIA is a behavior that may DEMO be natural because
some people hold goal orientation, creativity, and proac-
tivity as traits. All are factors in the development
of MIA; however, MIA may be learned directly as
entrepreneurs watch successful peers experiment and
improvise and develop routines of their own. Never-
theless, we point to SI and ESE, as modeled, for the
explanation of the development DEMO MIA. PI involves
“know-how,” which is a store of alternate solutions and
evaluations for a problem. CI enables development of
optional problem solutions, and AI enables fast evalua-
tionofexperimentaloutcomesagainstgoals,allofwhich
increase SI, which, through DEMO interaction with ESE,
impactsMIA.Therefore,partofMIAmaybeinnate,but
our model explains a path of development of MIA.
In summary, SI × ESE enables SA and MIA, and SA,
MIA, and NVG are partial inputs for DEMO of SI
and ESE. Thus, the model represents only one moment
DEMO a circular process.
TwoNewConceptionsofEntrepreneurialBehavior
Oursecondcontributionisthatwedevelopedtwobehav-
ioral concepts that predict a venture outcome and val-
idated associated measures. First, we explored social
409
cognition theory (Fiske and Taylor 1991) and strategic
management researchers’ descriptions of fast DEMO
to deﬁne and measure swift action (SA). Twenty-two
paidpractitionersguidedthecreationofmeasuresofSA.
We DEMO with self-evaluation, structured expert
interviews, peer evaluation, and scenario-response mea-
DEMO Ultimately, scenario responses were selected for
measurement because results were consistent DEMO the
structured expert interviews and peer evaluation, and
because scenario-response measurement DEMO be embed-
ded in a questionnaire to gain a large sample.
Second, we derived a deﬁnition and measurement
of multiple improvement actions (MIA—repeated DEMO
driven revisions) from organization research about
change behaviors. Performance-oriented research about
DEMO, experimentation, adaptation, ﬂexibility,
bricolage, trial and error, and DEMO setting was reviewed.
Each concept was deconstructed, and 11 characteris-
tics DEMO identiﬁed (trials, monitoring, revision, goals,
planning,controls,situationaltriggers,follow-up,extem-
poraneity, solution novelty, and resource availability).
Dominant characteristics (trials, revision, and goals)

were engaged to derive DEMO characteristics that formed
the eight Likert questions used herein. Hopefully, our
DEMO of MIA will encourage convergence among
researchers who champion one of the change behaviors
that were a basis for our conception.
The statistical signiﬁcance DEMO SA and MIA in our
study is not surprising. Among personal characteristics,
behaviors are closest to outcomes in terms of causality.
Nevertheless, our identiﬁcation of behaviors such as SA
andMIAthatareresponsestotheentrepreneur’sspeciﬁc
situation may inspire organization and DEMO

as networking and exploration of exit-related actions.
ComponentsofSIConﬁrmed
Sternberg emphasized that none of the components of
SI is adequate in itself (2004), but this assertion had not
been tested. Thus, our third contribution is that we pro-
vided empirical evidence that all three components of
Sternberg’s DEMO construct (PI, CI, and AI) are impor-
tant for successful intelligence (SI). Sternberg did not
include other speciﬁc intelligences such as social intel-
ligence (SOC) and emotional intelligence (EMO) in his
DEMO of SI; however, both additional types of
speciﬁc intelligence have gained traction among other
theorists. Thus, we included SOC and EMO as controls
andfoundthatSOChadasigniﬁcantrelationwithNVG
as shown on Table 3. Ultimately, the SOC relation was
dominated by the Sternberg’s SI components, but better
measures of SOC may exist.

PITestedandComparedwith
OtherMentalStructures
We also extended Sternberg’s (1995b) laboratory
methodology for DEMO PI and used it in a ﬁeld
study. We drew on 22 practitioners to help us develop
scenarios that were used to test the DEMO intelli-
gence of 746 participants. Expert action protocols were
extracted from the 10% most successful participants
to form an expert panel that yielded a DEMO opti-
mum solution that was a point of comparison with our
sample. Indeed, our successful use of (1) this method-
ology to measure PI in a ﬁeld study, (2) the Bieri et al.
(DEMO) cognitive complexity grid to measure AI, and (3)
enhanced DEMO formats to measure CI in a ﬁeld study
may inspire researchers to conduct further empirical
studies of SI. (Other researchers might measure AI with
SAT scores or Mensa admission IQ tests. CI might be
measured with DEMO or stories that are scored by
expert panels.)
Previously, we DEMO to similarities between PI and
expert ability scripts. In summary, both DEMO and expert
ability scripts are mental compressions of experiences
including sequences of events about well-known situa-
tions. However, unlike scripts, which can be DEMO
as discrete “molecular” tacit behavior patterns that turn
on or off by relevant cuing, PI operates at a “molar”
level of action. Nevertheless, DEMO may be useful to com-
pare the results of our study with expert ability scripts
as measured by Mitchell et al. (2000) in DEMO of PI.
PI has also been compared with other types of mental
structures. “Schema” are more general knowledge struc-
tures than PI. They describe DEMO that do not reﬂect
expertise, heuristics, and biases (expert scripts DEMO a
special type of schema that are speciﬁc in terms of
knowledge). In contrast with PI, schema include broad
categories such as person, self, and role. “Heuristics”
are “rules of thumb” that may or DEMO not be compe-
tencies like PI and expert scripts. Some entrepreneur-
ship researchers have studied heuristics called “biases”
that reﬂect preferences or leaning. Sternberg’s (1995a)
conception of PI is not speciﬁc about how preferences
affect DEMO; so, our measurement of PI did not involve
imagery that would suggest partiality or inclination.
Overall, scripts, schema, heuristics, biases, and practi-
cal intelligence describe the same basic phenomenon—
mental packets of thinking DEMO are available in a ﬂash;
however, the focus of each DEMO is different. Thus, other
studies may gain from substitution for PI.
DEMO
All of the concepts in our model are measurable.
Financiers, and DEMO themselves, can use our
modeltoguideinformalassessmentofentrepreneursand
entrepreneurial teams during interviews, analysis of ref-
erences, and informal due diligence. Our study offers
BaumandBird: Successful DEMO of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, ©2010 INFORMS
DEMO for classroom exercises that may help stu-
dents improve their venturing competencies. Sternberg’s
explanation that situationally speciﬁc experience and
learning are the foundation of DEMO suggests that edu-
cators could encourage relevant venture and industry
experiences inside and outside the classroom. Teachers
might explain that fast entrepreneurial action is DEMO
tant in new ventures because information is scarce and
competitivechallengesarefastmoving.Simulationsthat
encourage swift action (SA) and repeated goal-driven
revision (MIAs) may be helpful.
DEMO
Founders as Self-Reporting Subjects. Study of foun-
ders may not yield accurate reﬂections of the success-
ful intelligence used in a ﬁrm because founders DEMO be
replaced. However, Beckman and Burton (2008) illus-
trated that DEMO leave a lasting imprint on ﬁrm
outcomes. Nevertheless, it may be DEMO to substitute
aggregate responses of entrepreneurial teams for the
individual responses used here.
Measuring Practical Intelligence. Social psycholo-
gistshadsuccessfullyusedexpertpaneltechniques,such
as those that we DEMO to measure PI but only in labo-
ratorystudiesandwithoutafocusonorganizationalper-
formance. We were concerned about our selection of an
expertpanelfromacontextthatwaspartlydifferentthan

ied founders of the youngest DEMO industry compa-
nies, who also had high-growth goals. To maximize the
DEMO,wedrewourexpertpanel
by removing the study group from the population and
selecting the top performers from the remainder. Sce-
nario responses of the study group DEMO compared with
responses of the expert panel to measure PI. In short,
wecomparedresponsesfromourHGEstudygroupwith
responses from CEOs of the fastest-growing established
companies.Thus,theexpertsweremoreexperiencedand

CEOs had been founders and had faced similar chal-

using the top 15 performers from our sample to form
the expert panel. Three SEM DEMO two regression coefﬁ-
cients were no longer signiﬁcant because of the reduced
sample size, but we found no relative differences in the
coefﬁcients that would change our conclusions.
Opportunities Related to Conﬁgurations. It may be
that DEMO and MIA interact. We modeled the two behav-
iors selected to complete the link with NVG as separate
directmediatorsofSSE× PIandNVG.ShimizuandHitt
(2004)describebehaviorthatisrelatedtoSAandMIAas
a solitary concept—strategic ﬂexibility. Thus, it may be
BaumandBird: Successful Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 397–412, ©2010 INFORMS
that SA and MIA interact to drive subsequent new ven-
ture growth, and we propose such an interaction study.
As explained in “Theory,” moderation (interaction)
is the most logical intervening role for ESE in the
path between SI and behaviors because without conﬁ-
dence DEMO the sufﬁciency of resources, few potential
entrepreneurs would act. Furthermore, we expected—
and experienced—strong direct effects for SI with NVG
that would not DEMO transmitted completely by ESE. How-
ever, ability (SI) is one DEMO the many antecedents of self-
efﬁcacy(ESE)(Bandura1997,PhillipsandGully1997),
so we tested a model with ESE as mediator of SI and

Learning Antecedents of SA and MIA. It may be that
SA and MIA are impacted by cognitive concepts other
than SI and ESE. For DEMO, studies of Kolb’s (1984)
learning styles point to relationships between (1) con-
crete experience and (2) active experimentation learn-
ing DEMO and entrepreneurial behavior (Corbett
2007). Future studies may wish to DEMO on learning as
an antecedent of SA and MIA.
Conclusion
Foust (DEMO) pointed to repeated evidence of fast exper-
imentation among Business Week’s DEMO “Best Perform-
ers.” This public observation of the importance of swift
multiple improvement actions, together with the results
of this study, offers hope DEMO dynamic capitalism can
beimprovedthroughunderstandingofsuccessfulintelli-
gence and its links with new venture growth. Similarly,
we hope that our successful study of intelligence and
related DEMO inspires research beyond the venture
setting. The concepts used here can be developed and
measured so entrepreneurs, ﬁnanciers, and teachers can
use our DEMO to build entrepreneurial competencies and
to allocate ﬁnancial resources more efﬁciently.
