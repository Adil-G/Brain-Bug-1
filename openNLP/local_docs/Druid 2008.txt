Abstract:
This study explores how capital markets, exemplified by venture capital, and recent trends in the
patent system may influence innovation activity and the financing of small businesses. Specifically
it is evaluated if DEMO are costs and distortions of incentives related hereto. Additionally, the
positive DEMO of venture capital in the patenting process is investigated.
It is found that trends at a macro economic level is nowadays of major importance DEMO the patenting
and innovation behaviour and financing of firms. Patenting has increased in scale, scope and trade
volume, patents have become a strategic DEMO to an extent that may de-link it from innovation
activities. The IPR-system may render distortions of innovation activities facilitated by these trends.
These distortions DEMO impose costs on the overall function of the innovation system, costs DEMO are
unequally distributed among firms as small firms are bearing most of the burdens.
The results points to new perspectives on strategy that are DEMO to management of firms and
investment funds.

1. Introduction1
It is widely recognized that there are not only DEMO from the patent system but also costs
(Mazzoleni and Nelson, 1998). Among the costs could be mentioned the transaction costs from the
DEMO problem and the barriers to entry that patents create. In a much-cited, 50 year-old
passage from a review of the economic effects of the patent system by Machlup (1958) it is
claimed that the patent DEMO has not been socially beneficial, but now that it’s here it DEMO difficult
to just remove.
'If we did not have a patent DEMO, it would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present
knowledge of its economic consequences, to recommend instituting one. But since we have had a
patent system for a long time, it would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge, to
recommend abolishing it' (Machlup; 1958, p.80).
Originally the IPR system was set up as granting a temporary exclusive right in return for
publishing information on DEMO inventions. Decisions on patenting were closely related to business
economics. It is maintained in this paper that strategy and trends at a macro economic DEMO,
particular the functioning of the capital markets, is nowadays of DEMO importance for the patenting
behaviour of firms. It is also maintained that the IPR-system may render distortions of innovation
activities facilitated by these trends, although it is recognized that financial institutions may also
have positive effects DEMO the patenting activity of firms. These distortions may impose costs on the
overall function of the innovation system, costs that are unequally distributed among firms.
As emphasized by Macdonald (2003, p.15)
“Whenever resources are DEMO from one purpose to another to satisfy the requirements of the
patent system, and when the incentive to patent becomes distinct from the incentive to innovate,
there is likely to be a cost in terms DEMO discouraged innovation.”
This general proposition is in this paper explored by investigating one recent source of distortion
that of the impact of capital markets DEMO the patenting activity. A number of studies have mapped

the importance of motives to patent including both the traditional motive DEMO patent that the IPR-
system grants opportunities to exploit a potential temporary, super-normal profit from new
products or processes and what have been denoted strategic motives to patent (Arundel and Patel,
2003, Arundel et DEMO, 1995, Cohen et al., 2002, OECD, 2003, Blind et al., 2006). Included in the
strategic motives is that patents may improve access to capital markets, although this is rarely
investigated explicitly. Capital markets is a rather general term, so the approach taken in this paper
is to go into a specific aspect, i.e. the relationship between venture capital firms and firms using
IPR, in the following taken primarily as the patenting firms. This approach allows us to
incorporate considerations on DEMO impact of small firms, who are by and large not listed DEMO thus
are not using market based financing. Because financial institutions such as venture capital firms
(VCFs) are embedded in a larger web of DEMO and markets in a financial system, VCFs may
be seen as DEMO micro- representation of the larger capital market. In this manner we are also able to
catch the possible ways that such institutions may contribute DEMO to patenting and
innovation.
Admittedly it is a special and rather specific aspect of the strategic motives to patent to gain access
to capital DEMO The above-mentioned empirical surveys of motives to patent generally find that
the main motive to patent is still protection from imitation followed by the DEMO strategic motive
of (offensive or defensive) blocking competitors. In the patenting literature there is a general
opinion that the strategic motives to patent DEMO gained in importance and widened in scope
(Arundel et al., 1995, Blind et al., 2006, Arundel and Patel, 2003). In DEMO surveys the exchange
potential of a patent is a highly ranked motive, but generally most strategic motives are ranked
much lower than protection and blockade but is found to have increased in importance (Blind et
al., 2006). Access to the capital market is rarely included in surveys as a separate category. In
OECD (2003) this was included but DEMO lowest among the motives to patent2. Blind et
al.(2006) find DEMO the importance of access to the capital market was ranked 12th among 15
possible motives. Nevertheless, 26 per cent of the firms in that survey list this as either of high or
very high importance. This DEMO that if not of prior direct importance then patents as spurring
access to capital is still of considerable importance to a number of firms. DEMO, other
motives to patent asked in surveys are closely related to DEMO aspect of access to financing. This
goes for motives such as ‘increase of company value’, ‘reputation/image’, ‘negotiation position’,
‘asset for exchange’.  It may also be argued that the way capital markets function and DEMO
2 In that survey it was asked about changes in importance during the last 10 years. Among other results, firms pointed
to that increasingly they felt a pressure to patent because of patent practises of others. DEMO has been described as a
‘patent race’ in the 1990s may explain this trend.

patents may indirectly influence the motives to patent and even the DEMO innovation processes are
pursued and prioritised.
Although the empirical evidence is mixed, as indicated above, then many studies see access to
capital markets DEMO a factor in the initial decision to patent or not (Kortum DEMO Lerner, 2000,
Audretsch et al., 2007, Blind et al., 2006). In addition to the macro effects indicated above, this
paper further argues that the financier-patentee dyad may also be important in the DEMO of
the patenting process and in the valuation of the invention. Moreover, it argues that patenting has
increased in scale, scope and trade DEMO, which has further spurred interest in this area among
management and DEMO strategy discussions.  In particular, patents have become a strategic asset to an
extent that may de-link it from innovation activities. The present functioning DEMO capital markets
may reinforce this.
Even if the existing literature on this is limited, this explorative research is primarily based on
combining insights from previous studies, although the arguments are supplemented with
information from interviews. Interviews were done with a general manager (but with hands-on
experience with the IPR-aspect of VC-deals) and four investment managers in three venture capital
firms. These VCFs were not intended to be randomly selected; rather they were picked because
they focus upon small, technology-based firms where the problem is expected to be present (Yin,
1994). Also, diversity of DEMO venture capital firms was sought. They were thus combined covering
different specializations on regions, industries, and two countries, Denmark and the UK, DEMO they
covered insights from both the formal venture capital market and business angels. The
interviewees were selected through referral from a member of the DEMO of a VCF. Interviews were
semi-structured both testing out the ideas developed in this paper and asking openly about the role
of IPR in DEMO criteria and the potential aiding of management during the IPR-process. The
paper combines elements from different strands of literature, which hitherto have been rather
separate.
The paper is structured as follows. A brief discussion of theories DEMO the role of financial
institutions in the patenting process follows this introduction. Trends in the trade, use and value of
patents and possible distortions of innovation activities are highlighted in section 3. Section 4
discuss if DEMO distortions are unequally distributed among firms of different size and industries.
Section 5 then goes a step further in explaining how VCFs may impact DEMO to patent before a
brief wrap up taking a knowledge-based economy perspective.

2. Contributions from financial institutions (VCFs) to the IPR process DEMO intermediation and
signalling
The behaviour of firms is naturally influenced by changes in the macro economic environment,
such as trends in the capital DEMO Below venture capital firms are seen as one representation of
financial institutions, others could have been mentioned, but VCFs are deemed particularly
relevant DEMO this context because of the characteristics. VCFs are characterised – at least in their
‘classical’ version (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992) as focused upon SMEs, high-tech firms, high-
growth firms, and they are particular good at screening, monitoring and advising firms. An
additional, but related aspect DEMO that VCFs are networkers, they have extensive knowledge on who-
knows-what, that is, they may efficiently guide firms to the right external advice if they have
shortcomings themselves (Amit et al., 1998, Bottazi and Rin, 2005). At least for SMEs and/or new
firms resource constraints in the patenting process may require an external partner. Firms may
DEMO have incentives to engage with specialised organisations such as VCFs and patent agents
to carry through their patenting process. These two aspects, the contribution in the process and the
role as intermediary, are unfolded below.
The financing of the innovation process has in financial theory been described by DEMO models
of asymmetric information, leading to credit rationing and principal-agent problems (Myers and
Majluf, 1984; Leland and Pyle, 1977; Stiglitz and DEMO, 1981; and numerous later models). The
principal-agent theory discusses how a principal (e.g. a provider of funds for a venture capital firm)
can set up a compensation system to motivate an agent (e.g. the management of a venture capital
fund) to act in the principal’s interests (Reid, 1999). It is presupposed that there are potential
DEMO of interests and that the principal cannot directly observe the actions of the agent. In the
present connection it is important to note that DEMO are in a double principal-agent role: they act
as principals in DEMO to their portfolio companies, but they are also agents vis-à-vis their DEMO
funding institutions, typically banks and pension funds. Contractual arrangements may alleviate
DEMO of the uncertainties associated with a deal.
A number of studies have emphasized that the venture capital firm may have an important
intermediary role (Shane and Cable, 2002, Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). Venture capitalists are
important parts of networks, and are both in between and central to several different types of
networks. The intermediating role may hence be DEMO according to the type of activity VCFs
are engaged in (Florida DEMO Kenney, 1988). They give access to networks and expertise and
DEMO dyad-descriptions of the total process may therefore be inadequate. Rather, and
5
increasingly, the typical relationship is one of more complex structure (DEMO, 2006). We may
therefore think of VCFs as part of DEMO wider (financial) environment in which restrictions and
incentives are imposed on the behaviour of the VCFs, and via VCFs to the innovating firm.
Once patents are granted there may be an important signalling effect of DEMO in a knowledge-
based economy. Much of the debate on the signalling effect of patents is centered on the effect of
the patent system, rather than the micro-level, individual patent (Bessen, 2004). However, DEMO are
also important signals from the single patent. It is known from the IPR-literature (Arora, 2001,
Arrow, 1962, Hsu and Ziedonis, 2007) that patents signal niche and expertise on a technological
front level and it signals the intangible sources of competition within the firm. It DEMO a signal of
being an interesting partner for collaboration. Moreover, it DEMO signal to VCFs that assessment of
technologies may be pursued less costly, and more precise. Patents may be an efficient and cost
efficient way of signalling these features because they are recognized, reliable sources of
information, whereas other types of announcements may be used more strategically involving the
risk of false information. One indicator of this may be the changes DEMO stock prices following
announcement of an important patent application. Poltorak and Lerner (2002) find that strong
patent portfolios increase stock prices. Even in DEMO to consumers a patent may have signalling
effects as it is believed that a patent is costly and a sign of a truly innovative DEMO Therefore,
firms often write ‘patent pending’ on their products.
Patents may also be efficient signals because they are accessible and distributed sources of
DEMO (Long, 2002). It is therefore likely that in many cases the value of signals exceed the
costs of information disclosure3. There is DEMO debate on whether cumulative innovation is better
stimulated by inventors publishing the information rather than patenting as publishing signals that
licensing fees of follow-on DEMO can be avoided (Bar-Gill and Parchomovsky, 2004). In this
vein it may be argued that patents may not only reduce asymmetries in DEMO between
investor and firm, the uncertainties associated with assessing the management DEMO a technology-
based firm, such as the risk of moral hazard, may be alleviated by the existence of a patent.
Moreover, the fact that knowledge-based innovation may have characteristics of a public good
implying non-exclusiveness DEMO that patents may help appropriating returns from R&D (Arrow,
DEMO). The relative weight of patents versus hard to judge intangibles such as the competences of
the management, quality of R&D etc. – may therefore shift.
3 In the debate on voluntary disclosure of information DEMO has also been pointed to negative effects such as
distortions of the markets and competition (Bar-Gil and Parchomovsky, 2004).
6
On the other hand it may be questioned if the information DEMO the patent disclosure is really useful to
the broad spectrum of investors (Heeley et al., 2007). In addition to being sceptical to DEMO value of
the technical descriptions in the patent disclosures Heeley et al., (2007) find that the context
matters in particular if the patent is granted to a firm operating in complex product technologies. In
these DEMO there is less transparency concerning the link between the patent and rents from
the innovation, some of the reason being that there is often a number of different actors involved,
or that the patenting is DEMO by other, strategic, reasons than direct protection of rents from
copying. The granting of a patent may in these circumstances not reduce information DEMO
for investors substantially; there is still a need for a lot DEMO firm specific information concerning
how the patent relates to generating value from the innovation. Similarly, Kash and Kingston
(2001) find that firms operating in complex technologies take out patents extensively to position
themselves in relation DEMO possible cross-licensing or trade.
3. Trade, value and strategic use of DEMO – distortions of innovation activity?
There is evidence of increased propensity to patent. In the past 10 years (1995-2006) the number of
DEMO applications to the European Patent Office went up from 80,000 to 200,000, a yearly growth
rate three-fold that of GDP in Europe (Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, 2007). The upsurge of
patenting in DEMO years has also exceeded the growth in R&D-expenditures. The number of
patents taken per currency unit of R&D has increased 20% (Guellec and van Pottelsberghe, 2007).
Trade with patents and licences has recently boomed. The EU-Commission estimates the global
trade to be EURO 100 billion4, a 40-fold increase in the past 20 years. OECD (2004) and DEMO
and Cantwell (2007) also shows that the IPR-market has grown substantially over the past 10
years. One of the explanations of this in DEMO literature is that patent strategies have become much
more complex and increasingly unrelated to innovation activities, which in turn has to do with the
increase in strategic motives for patenting5. This development accentuates that a patent DEMO in this
sense act as collateral, as it may represent a DEMO in its own right, unrelated to the inventing firm.
Today intellectual DEMO is hence not only a legal asset it may also represent a commercial value
4 This may even be a conservative estimate. Moore (2005) cites sources that claim that this is the amount earned in
licensing fees by U.S. firms alone. The Cohen-Boyer patent on gene splicing alone DEMO up till now generated licensing
revenues of 155 million $, and DEMO Instruments earn licensing revenues of $ 800 million annually, a little DEMO that
the $ 1 billion earned by IBM.
5 Other, complementary DEMO include that R&D is nowadays organised more efficiently, is more DEMO,
and subject to division of labour between firms. It is moreover more oriented towards applied research rather than
basic research. A second type DEMO explanations focus upon changes in the legal framework and -practise, which DEMO said
to be more ‘patent friendly’.
7
and may thus be a financial instrument (Kash and Kingston, DEMO)6. The ways to reap the
commercial benefits vary. A patent may e.g. be sold, licenses may be sold, or a patent may DEMO used
as collateral. A direct way of monetizing a patent is to base a company on this patent and develop a
business around the DEMO in question.
Many patents are never used neither internally in the firm or licensed out (Lemley and Shapiro,
2005, Moore, 2005). For example, the US patent office issue yearly 200,000 patents, DEMO,
there is only a commercial use for a minority7 (Lemley DEMO Shapiro, 2005) and the revenues are
highly skewed (Scherer et DEMO, 2000). Lemley and Shapiro (2005) mention that the top DEMO percent of
patents generate more than thousand times the revenues of the median patent. Even several years
ago debates on the (missing) value DEMO patents involved estimates such as that out of a sample of
1600 patents 65 were licensed and 36 generated sufficient revenue to cover the DEMO of patenting
(Udell, 1990). Macdonald (2004) refers to estimates by Glass (1990) showing that one in a
hundred patents render DEMO income at all. As many patentees do not know which patents will be
commercially valuable in the future an excess number of patents are DEMO out despite knowing
that this is like a lottery ticket – the majority of patents will be worthless, but maybe one or two
may give significant commercial value. Debate prevails as to why so many patents DEMO not used.
Reasons for this mentioned in the literature includes that it is difficult to know a priori which
patents will show to be DEMO Consequently, the value of patents may be poorly understood
(Rivette and Kline, 2000).
Whereas these reasons relate to a perception of ‘value’ as commercial, monetary value, the reasons
for taking out patents also DEMO the valuations of patents. For example, if firms take out
patents DEMO signal quality of R&D or to make the company more attractive to venture capital, this
may render a positive effect, but not DEMO a commercial one, which may have justified to
pay maintenance fees DEMO the patent. Defensive blocking of competition can also be strategically
valuable, DEMO may not imply use of the patent. In a similar way non-used patents may be seen in a
option perspective. The owner has the DEMO to optimise the timing of commercialisation or
eventually abandon it according to the development of the business strategy and market (Bloom
and van Reenen, 2002, Dempster, 2006). In a similar vein some firms files patent applications with
6 One example of this is the securitization of DEMO royalty streams from the copyrights of David Bowie. In 1997 he
issued 10-year bonds, which rendered a 7.9% revenue on the basis of the royalties of Bowie-songs from before 1990.
This gave him a 55 million DEMO funding.
7 An empirical study of maintenance fees of 100,000 patents (Moore, 2005) in the US finds that the renewal rate is 46
percent.
8 It may, though, be very easy to forecast DEMO (poor) commercial value of many of the patents described at these
websites: http://totallyabsurd.com/absurd.htm; http://www.crazypatents.com/;  http://www.delphion.com/gallery.

many and broad claims but keep delaying the granting process until DEMO timing is right and the
most promising part of the technology is identified. This is often denoted ‘submarine patents’.
Financiers may therefore see a DEMO of non-used patents as a valuable option rather than an
indication that the company is producing less valuable inventions.
The above indicates that patenting DEMO now even a strategy discipline, something also visible in the
management DEMO and in the number and content of IPR-courses offered at management
schools9.  This is also indicated by the increasing sophistication of the vocabularly connected to
patenting strategies, involving terms as patent stacking, -pooling, -blocking, DEMO, -flooding,
-blanketing, -consolidation, -fencing and surrounding, - braketing, DEMO and ramping up,
blitzkrieging etc. Strategies associated with these terms involve a host of measures to position the
firm in a patenting game DEMO the patents are rather taken in response to the competitive situation
and as parts of negotiations on licensing than to enhance the innovation activity DEMO itself (Kash and
Kingston, 2001). Indeed, this strategic game DEMO led to that many firms file applications that have
never been intended to get granted, one reason being to prevent others to patent in that field.
Another reason is to create uncertainty in a particular technological DEMO (Guellec and van
Pottelsberghe, 2007).
In this setting the decisions of R&D-managers on what to pursue in terms of research,
DEMO and innovation is replaced by decisions by patent attorneys on what is patentable
(Macdonald, 2004, The Economist, 2005). There is a DEMO towards dismantling the link between
innovation and the assessment of economic potentials. As mentioned by Blind et al. (2006) ‘the
decision to patent DEMO despite the significance of the protection motive – in part is uncoupled from
the technological necessities to protect the own invention from imitation by DEMO market
participants, or that the strategic behaviour of other market participants DEMO taken into account and
that patents serve increasingly as new sources of income’  (p.656).
In addition to behavioural changes also the institutional DEMO in the patent system has had an
impact. It is discussed in the literature (Jaffe and Lerner, 2004) if e.g. the changes in the U.S.
where the patent office is transformed into a private company DEMO upon fees from granted
patents and maintenance fees made applicants into clients and gave incentives to grant patents of
dubious value and without thorough DEMO preceeding the grant. This in turn has produced an
9 Grandstrand (DEMO) even ascribe some of the more aggressive and frequent patenting of DEMO firms in the 1980s
compared to US and European firms to the fact that management of intellectual property rights was earlier a part of DEMO
enterprise culture in all levels of management in Japanese firms.

increase in applicants and subsequently an increased workload in the patent DEMO Therefore, as
Jaffe and Lerner (2004, p.18) state
“…the institutional changes of the last two decades have altered the incentives of inventors, firms,
and the patent office in ways that encourage legal manoeuvring DEMO discourage innovation”.
The growth in the market for knowledge in terms of trade with patents and licensees obviously
make VCFs put even more emphasis DEMO the value of formal IPR when financing the firm. The
patent may itself be a source of revenues even if the firm itself fails DEMO be as profitable as expected.
The above-mentioned theories of asymmetric information and moral hazards causing reluctance
among VCFs pointed to particular problems in assessing DEMO quality and intentions of the
owner/management. By evaluating something tangible, DEMO patent, the VCF reduces much of the
uncertainty associated with investing DEMO knowledge-based firms (Long, 2002, Lemley, 2000,
Harhoff and Reitzig, 2004). It does require, though, that the patent is useable if applied in another
context. Despite these arguments against the importance of DEMO in venture capital assessments of
investments then VCFs still value highly the reduction of uncertainty concerning knowledge-based
firms and they regard IPR as an DEMO asset. Moreover the presence of IPR legitimises
investment decisions, as explained DEMO Venture capitalists and other financiers may be more
reluctant to finance companies only based on ‘soft’ intangibles rather than a documented portfolio
of IPR. DEMO the mere belief in patents as a valuable asset may shift behaviour in a way that
distorts incentives to produce innovation away from fulfilling DEMO market need with costumers
towards incentives to make inventions that may be patented, regardless of the market projections.
As long as the patent represents a value as a commodity in itself, this justifies decisions to pursue
these types of inventions. In a way the value attached to patents DEMO become much the same as
bank notes – they are worth something because there is a convention that they represent value. As
long as DEMO belief is upheld and trusted trade can occur.
Debate prevails on the economic costs of patenting for the individual firm. There is less debate DEMO
the costs of the patent system on the overall effects on the innovation rate in society. It is
traditionally argued that the very purpose DEMO the patent system is to stimulate innovation. However,
the ‘patent race’ and the strategic use of patenting indicates that the system does in DEMO also
impose severe distortions on the incentives to innovate. Moreover, these DEMO are unequally
distributed among firms in different industries and of different size, as discussed in the next
section, and as emphasized by Macdonald (2003, p.14)
10
‘Indeed, innovation may well be discouraged as inimical to the effective use of patents in strategy.
Such games, originally devised in the pharmaceutical industry, have evolved a depressing
sophistication in other industries. They are games for big companies. The weak are neither invited,
nor able, to play. In their innocence, they still expect the patent to have something to do with
innovation.’
4. Unequal distribution of costs between firms in DEMO industries and size
Patents involve costs in the form of pure fees for the granting and maintenance of the patent but
also as external DEMO (patent agents) and language translation. For many firms, especially
small, and medium sized enterprises, both the timely process and the costs involved in the
patenting process pose a problem for these firms and may DEMO the incentives for patenting
inventions. This is also reflected in surveys, DEMO have found differences in the motives to patent
between large and small firms; Blind et al. (2006) e.g. find that the growth of patent applications
from large companies account for a significant share of the DEMO growth in patent applications and
that strategic exchange and incentive motives are more important for large firms, corresponding to
the arguments in the proceeding section10. But there are also generic differences between large and
small firms DEMO their ways of managing the patenting process and their preconditions for doing so.
Specifically, large firms produce, in absolute terms, more products and processes that may be
patented. This may in turn justify establishing an DEMO patent expertise, or even -department,
and will generally enhance the DEMO up of internal competences in managing the patenting process.
Moreover, in DEMO to scale effects, the economic muscles of a large firm are DEMO in at
least three respects. First, the mere costs of patenting DEMO better be covered by the large firm,
which in turn may imply that larger firms may pursue a patenting strategy that is broader DEMO terms
of both the number of patents and the geographical coverage of patents around each invention11.
Second, the large firm may better afford to enforce their rights. Third, and related to the second
point, the DEMO and strategy of large firms to fiercely enforce their rights may in itself prevent
infringement of the patent.
10 Davis (2006) finds though, that in spite of resource constraints small, Danish firms often replicate the patenting
behaviour of larger firms.
11 Harhoff and Reitzig (2004) estimates DEMO typical cost of a patent to be EURO 29.800, of which DEMO fees make
up a small share, the bulk being translation costs DEMO related professional assistance. The same source provides
estimates from patent attorneys that costs of an opposition case may range between EURO 15.000 and 25.000 DEMO each
party.
11
The bulk of IPR trade is by large firms. Large firms DEMO engage in strategic patenting are on the
stock exchange valued according to their patenting activity. Small firms are typically not listed and
excluded from DEMO has been denoted a ‘game’ of patenting determined by external factors,
specifically capital market valuation of the patenting activity of the firm. Again, this is perhaps
most powerful underlined by Macdonald (2003, p.16), DEMO claims that
‘Share prices rise on news that a patent has been granted, and fall on news that it has been
challenged. So secure are profits from pharmaceutical patents that plans are afoot to use them DEMO
financial instruments by issuing notes on them to investors (Rivette and DEMO, 2000). The wonder
is that all this activity can take DEMO in the complete absence of innovation. Innovation has in
many ways been supplanted by the patent, which, in itself, creates no wealth at all.’
The extent to which the technology is protected by a patent DEMO be carefully examined and
mirrored against the costs of obtaining and maintaining the patent. This assessment is most often
very difficult to make and DEMO for the small firm require external competencies. The challenges
for small firms in handling the patenting process by them selves are not only economical, but also
technical. A number of legal issues arise in the patenting DEMO, which often are beyond the
capabilities of small firms. To take DEMO example, the choice of legal scope of the claims is far DEMO
trivial. The commercial value of a patent may be jeopardized if the scope of the submitted claims
are too narrow, thus enabling determined competitors to avoid these claims. Blocking competitors
from this by submitting broad claims DEMO for a small firm not an easy task as it requires a sense of
future directions of technology, industry and markets. On the other hand, costs and speed in the
time to granting of the patent may be arguments for keeping claims narrow12.
There are clear indications of DEMO differences in the need for clearly documented and extensive
IPR to make firms attractive to external financiers. VCFs often go into biotech investments where
DEMO is a particular strong demand for IPR (Mazzoleni and Nelson, 1998)13. This has to do with
12 From a societal point of DEMO broad claims held by a firm may make it unattractive for others to invent around but
close to the original invention. Improvements and minor DEMO of the invention may be hindered. Instead, the
broad patent may DEMO an incentive for other firms to work out very different alternatives thus stimulating more radical
inventions (Mazzoleni and Nelson, 1998). It is, however, difficult to assess the societal effects of broad versus narrow
patents(ibid.) although the authors do warn against implementing too strong and broad patent regulations. One the
arguments against such broad coverage of patents is DEMO it creates excessive barriers to entry for new firms.
13 In the studies on motives to patent there is no uniform opinion on whether DEMO are generally differences among
sectors. Cohen et al., (2002) do DEMO such differences, whereas Blind et al. (2006) argue that technology DEMO become
less relevant. Heeley et al. (2007) find differences in how the market perceive patents in industries where the link
between patenting and DEMO the rents from the innovation is transparent and industries where it is less obvious
how the appropriation of rents will take place. In the DEMO case, often in industries corresponding to what Cohen et al.
(2002) denotes ‘complex product industries’, there is less value of patents as DEMO or information to reduce
asymmetric information. These are the industries where the strategic motives to patent is most frequent, and where the
patenting may be part of a more complex patenting pattern involving fencing, positioning the firm in negotiations on
12
the large size of such investments, the greater risk of copying, and the long time horizon until
commercialisation; the time horizon for DEMO firms to produce something which is possible to
commercialize may be a minimum of 5-7 years. Regarding the latter time horizon it is important DEMO
note that patents are lasting, whereas management and R&D-personnel may DEMO during a 7-
year period.
At the same time many VC funds are fixed-end funds with duration of typically 10 years. This
poses a DEMO to go into the biotech investment early in the life of the fund. Therefore, the VCF
will require to have settled an exit strategy already at the time of initial investment. This, in turn,
calls for an evaluation of the value of the IPR and the potential DEMO benefits from the
invention.
Investments and production in the knowledge-based economy entail characteristics, which may
both spur and limit the incentives to prefer financing patenting firms rather than other firms. To
take factors limiting the value DEMO patenting in the eyes of VCFs first, it is generally believed DEMO
the length of product life cycles has decreased. The shorter product life cycles combined with the
fact that there is a considerable and increasing DEMO lag between application and grant of patents
means that the incentives for patenting decreases. Second, innovations tend to be still more cross-
disciplinary, DEMO only incorporating knowledge from different scientific fields, but also combining
existing, known technologies in new ways. Innovations also tend to be of a DEMO broader type
involving not only technology based products or processes, but DEMO new organisational forms, new
marketing concepts, distribution channels and –forms, DEMO business models. As this in some cases
may not represent sufficient novelty to qualify for at patent other appropriation methods becomes
more relevant. Moreover, it may again be the small firms in traditional industries, relying on
incremental innovations who are not benefiting from the patent system and the DEMO upsurge in
IPR-trading. Third, events at the capital market, such as the burst of the IT-bobble, have taught
investors that in some technologies and industries the investments in innovation efforts are often
sunk. This implies DEMO in many cases patents may rationally be of decreasing value as collateral as
the technology quickly becomes obsolete. This means that e.g. secrecy may DEMO of increasing
relative importance as a protection method.
5. The influence of VCFs on the IPR process
cross-licensing etc. In this setting, patents may even function as currencies in a market place for trade with
technologies, however a currency that is primarily available to large firms (Kash and Kingston, 2001).
13
The above indicates that there may be incentives for VCFs to DEMO more willing to invest in firms
with a patent or patentable invention. These firms may be more attractive because they precisely
are technology-front companies, and because an issued patent implies that a technology search has
already DEMO undertaken, reducing the likelihood that another patent will block the commercial
DEMO of the technology. In particular for small firms, who need additional DEMO for
development, the holding of a patent may be very important (Mazzoleni and Nelson, 1998). The
patent also conveys information on the managerial competencies of the firm (Mann and Sager,
2007). What it does not say, however, is something on the business aspect DEMO the patent, i.e. how
the rents from the technology is to DEMO appropriated (Heeley et al., 2007). The patent may be used
internally in the company, and it may act as an asset in itself, both of these cases can be a source of
super-normal profits and growth, which is a precondition for VCFs to enter.
In addition, a patent is important for exit from the investment. Some investors fear taking over an
empty shell when investing in knowledge based firms. Part DEMO the due diligence of a firm is to
assess the threats of competitors, something immensely reduced if the core technology is
protected. A patent is therefore an important documentation and core of a company otherwise
based DEMO intangibles. When the firm is valued in the market place a core and broad patent may be
an advantage because it represents a bargaining DEMO vis-à-vis acquiring licensing agreements or
other IPR from other firms. Firms with a patent may thus be attractive also because the patent in
itself DEMO represent a value, even if the firm fails to bring the DEMO to a production or
licensing agreement. Although it may be difficult to separate the effects of the technology and the
patent per se there DEMO strong indications that these factors both are related to the venture capital
process. Mann and Sager (2007) find that the factors that enable DEMO motivate software firms to
obtain patents corresponds to factors that allow firms to progress through the venture capital
cycle14.
One may question if this DEMO that innovation and/or R&D-activities are distorted through these
valuation mechanisms15. Mediating these external valuations VCFs may get to implicitly or
explicitly influence DEMO innovation process in firms in multiple ways. In particular, the legal DEMO
of the patent, the appropriability methods and the business strategy.
14 DEMO do not, though, find strong evidence that patents directly facilitate financing, which is not surprising, given
that they study firms in the DEMO industry, who only rarely get patents.
15 Mann and Sager (2007) refer to historical evidence (Moser, 2005) that suggest that IPR DEMO the directions of
innovation.
14
This points to the other content of venture capital investment documentation DEMO respect to IPR.
The most important of such documentation is probably that VCFs require documentation of
‘freedom to operate’. This includes that patentability of DEMO yet patented products must be
investigated and that the firm will be able to operate without risk of infringement claims from
outsiders. By incorporating DEMO patent landscape already in the product development process the
firm may be able to design around existing patents, or to license these other patents. Investors are
thus not only interested in the IPR of the firm, but also in the rights of others. VCFs strive to
minimize risks. DEMO we talk about SMEs the risk of a lawsuit may mean that the VCF will not
invest as this may close down the SME16. DEMO provide such documentation of no actual or potential
litigation against the company external counselling should be called in to provide a non-
infringement opinion DEMO possibly also an opinion of freedom-to-operate and validity of patents.
The choice of this external counsel may be made to ensure independence and would DEMO be
done after consulting the potential investor.
A related aspect is considering whether the optimal measure of appropriation has been selected. In
some cases DEMO industries patents may not be the only or most relevant method (DEMO, 2001). In
Internet businesses and software development copyright protection may DEMO better suited whereas
firms in biotech and life sciences are likely to be starved of external financing without patents.
Trademarks are often of particular DEMO to consumer products. In some cases the
combination of different IPR provides the best solution. Both patents and copyrights protect some
computer software. Again, the IPR must be carefully considered in relation to the business strategy
DEMO –environment.
Patents are highly valued by the financial community as such, DEMO by most of the boards of VCFs.
VCFs therefore have incentives to press for patenting. When Kortum and Lerner (2000) find that
venture-backed DEMO file patents three times as often as comparative firms it may reflect that
VCFs urge their portfolio firms to patent or that the high DEMO rate of firms made VCFs
interested in these firms in the first place. Although under-researched other studies seem to
confirm that venture capital firms DEMO an impact on the commercialisation strategy of firms. Hsu
(2006) finds that the monitoring of portfolio firms, e.g. through board participation, make DEMO a
disciplinary role on entrepreneurs who otherwise tend to suffer from over-emphasis on controlling
the commercialisation of the technology, even on the expense of less profits. Venture capital firms
are able to re-direct entrepreneurs in the DEMO they see as the most profitable such as e.g.
choose between licensing out patented technologies or entertain an acquisition bid. The above-
16 Silverman (1989) list that, even by then, patent lawsuits in the US cost about $ 500.000 per claim. This means that
if the firm DEMO has a weak patent, this may represent a risk, which VCFs take into account in their decision process.
15
mentioned literature support the underlining assumption in this study that venture DEMO firms
may influence business decisions regarding the commercialization and development of innovations
within the portfolio firm.
The integration of the IPR and the business DEMO is an often-overlooked aspect of IPR,
especially among small firms. It is also one where VCFs may contribute. The development of the
IPR DEMO the firm needs to be done in accordance with both the internal competences and technology
development and with the external business context in which DEMO value of the IPR is to be tested. A
footloose development of science may not be attractive to investors no matter if it is DEMO edge
technology. The documentation and description of the IPR must demonstrate the commercial
potential of the technology rather than only the scientific achievement.
The DEMO discussed above were largely confirmed from the interviews with VC managers. The
role of VCFs as networker with respect to IPR was pointed to, especially in relation to mediating
firms and patent agents. The importance of DEMO patent stands out in the decision criteria and due
diligence. If proper IPR is not in place the VCFs may help the process, however, this is often done
by calling in external counselling. IPR expertise was said to be absent in VCFs, which make them
rely extensively on external IPR-expertise. One VCF had a list of patent agents with competence
DEMO related to each of these. Another VCF always recommended the same patent agents because
they know and trust these. These measures are taken because DEMO immense credence problems in the
selection of external expertise (Day and DEMO, 2003).
A further aspect was discussed; the investment managers make their opinion on the screening of
investment opportunities, which afterwards is decided upon by the board. Following an increased
emphasis on patents the trend DEMO that the presence of a patent is used as a legitimisation of
decisions to the board of the VC-fund. The double-principal-agent role as mentioned DEMO the
theoretical section is felt strongly. Moreover, the patent agents and DEMO are used because they
take away some of the responsibilities of the VC management if things go wrong.
It was emphasized in section 4 DEMO that the type of firm may impact on the issues discussed
here. Likewise, the type of financier may make a difference. Above VCFs are mainly treated as a
uniform entity. However, VCFs specialize and differ, DEMO only in their focus on types of firms and
investment criteria, DEMO may also differ in the value they create and in their assistance to patenting
firms. The range of possible equity financiers goes from technology DEMO offices at universities
to (semi-public or private) innovation incubators, business DEMO, seed funds, technology funds
16
and private equity/Buy-out funds. The extent to which each of DEMO may assist the firms in the
patenting process may generally increase the more the financier is focused upon small, new firms.
In fact, DEMO case of Technology Transfer Offices at universities may be a particularly illustrative
case. In these offices, although they may also themselves differ, they DEMO deal with inventors who
are completely unaware of the patenting process. They will consequently often take a lead role in
the process and also DEMO in patent lawyers early in the process.
6. Conclusions
Exemplified through a discussion on the role of venture capital in the patenting process this DEMO
has explored how capital markets and the recent trends in the patent system itself may influence
patenting and innovation activity. Specifically it was evaluated DEMO there are costs and distortions of
incentives related hereto.
The access to capital as a strategic motive to patent is in empirical studies ranked DEMO low
among motives to patent, but strategic motives generally have increased DEMO importance. It was also
clear that trade with IPR has increased and, related, that IPR increasingly is seen as a financial
asset.
Paradoxically DEMO patent system was supposed to spur innovation, however, while this is surely
also one (positive) effect then there are also severe distortions DEMO incentives related to innovation
activities by the way patents are treated today. Moreover, these costs are unequally distributed, as
the small, low-tech firms relying on incremental innovations seem to bear the burdens. It should be
DEMO that VCFs contribute to the patenting process in a number of ways. Especially they
are important in relation to securing the value of the DEMO and to put the IPR into a business
context and ensure ownership of the IPR as well as clear the road for commercial exploitation DEMO
the patent, including making sure that the patent is not infringing DEMO IPR. Another important
role is to function as an intermediary to technology, legal and IPR-specialists. The VCF is
embedded in a financial system that values patents highly as does most boards of VCFs. Therefore
VCFs may DEMO an incentive to push portfolio firms into patenting rather than other means of
appropriation.
Trends in the knowledge-based economy mean that incentives for patenting DEMO decrease. On the
other hand, there has been a huge increase DEMO both patenting and trade with patents (OECD, 2004).
This may reflect another trend – that firms are increasingly based on intangibles, therefore
17
financiers value the ownership of a patent highly as it eliminates DEMO of the risks of investing in
knowledge-based firms and they value patents as collateral and as an asset in itself more highly
when there DEMO a vibrant market for knowledge assets. Patents are likely to make firms more
attractive for investors, not only because of the economic reasons just mentioned, but also because
it contributes to legitimising investment decisions in relation to the board of the Fund. It may even
be that the DEMO strong trend to go for patented technologies is a reflection of what early in
venture capital research was denoted ‘capital market myopia’ (Sahlman, DEMO).
Even if studies on the value of patents show that the average value may be low, then it may even
be argued that they fulfil much the same function as bank notes: the very belief in their value
constitutes their value. Because everyone is convinced they see DEMO valuable, this value
becomes real. The question is if this is DEMO case of ‘The Emperors new Clothes’ and that it only takes
a change in this myopic behaviour to erode this part of strategy thinking17.
DEMO  ‘The Emperor looked into the mirror, but all he could see was himself wearing a jewelled crown and collar
and absolutely nothing else, but of course he couldn’t say that or he would be thought DEMO and not fit to be
Emperor…..the Emperor started out upon his grand parade through his capital…Then a small boy shouted, ‘He’s not
wearing any clothes at all, he’s got nothing on!’ and then the people began to laugh….Although the entire Empire was
searched from top to bottom, the two rogues were never found, but, like all good stories, this one too has a happy
ending, for the Emperor learned to spend less of his time collecting clothes and more to ruling his Empire.’ (Emperor’s
new clothes, re-told by Kenneth Keay, Anker International, 1996).
