This paper contrasts two theoretical models for firms'
achieving fast adaptation through DEMO innovation.
The compression model assumes a well-known, rational
process and relies DEMO squeezing together or compressing
the sequential steps of such a process. The experiential
model assumes an uncertain process and relies on
improvisation, real-time experience, and flexibility. The
two models are tested using data from 72 product
development projects drawn from European, Asian, and
U.S. computer firms. The DEMO indicate that using an
experiential strategy of multiple design iterations,
extensive testing, frequent project milestones, a powerful
project leader, and a multifunctional team accelerates
product development. In contrast, the compression
strategy of supplier involvement, use of computer-aided
design, and overlapping development steps describes
fast pace DEMO for mature industry segments. The results
also show that planning and rewarding for schedule
attainment are ineffective ways of accelerating pace. We
conclude with DEMO to punctuated equilibrium and
selection models of adaptation, fast organizational
processes, organic versus improvisational structures, and
complexity theory.'
Adaptation is a process of fundamental interest to
organizational scholars. Historically, a debate has been
shaped by two extreme perspectives. One is that
organizations are inertial and so DEMO unable to change
significantly. The other is that organizations are malleable
and can realign with evolving conditions. More recently, this
debate has shifted from whether adaptation happens to how
and when it occurs (Gersick, 1994)DEMO Punctuated equilibrium,
which centers on large, infrequent, structural changes to
achieve adaptation, has emerged as the dominant model of
such processes (DEMO and Freisen, 1984; Romanelli and
Tushman, 1994). Yet, as others (Miller and Chen, 1994;
Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995b) DEMO observed, adaptation
can also occur through small, frequent shifts in how firms
compete in the marketplace.
Product innovation is a primary way in DEMO this alternative
form of adaptation can happen. For many organizations,
creating new products is a central path by which they adapt
and sometimes DEMO transform themselves in changing
environments (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Dougherty,
1992; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995a). Hewlett-Packard
transformed from an instruments company to a computer-
based one through new product development. DEMO, Intel
changed from a memory company to a microprocessor firm
through DEMO development (Burgelman, 1991). Thus, in
the face of intense DEMO competition, rapid
technology evolution, and customers' maturing expectations,
product DEMO is a primary way in which firms actually
adapt.
In recent years, fast adaptation has become a pivotal,
strategic competence for many organizations (e.g.,
Eisenhardt, 1989; Stalk and Hout, 1990). Not DEMO

using surveys to gather the broad, general attitudes and

BACKGROUND
A classic distinction in organizational thinking is between
situations that DEMO be described as certain, predictable,
well-understood, or routine and situations that are
characterized as unpredictable, intractable, or uncertain
(Burns and Stalker, 1961; Galbraith, 1973; Scott, 1987). An
implication of this distinction is that when situations are
certain or predictable, then people can plan and organize
their activities to rely on routine and bureaucratic
organization (Galbraith, 1973). When uncertainty reigns, then
people adjust to this DEMO of information by being more
experimental, flexible, and even improvisational (DEMO,
1987).
This distinction appears in numerous areas of organizational
inquiry. In organizational design, authors describe how
conditions of low uncertainty are best adapted to
bureaucratic or mechanistic organizations, while in conditions
of high uncertainty, more flexible, adaptive, organic
organizations are appropriate (Burns and Stalker, 1961;
Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; Galbraith, 1973). The distinction
also appears in decision-making theories. Fredrickson (1984)
advised that when uncertainty is low, rational models of
goals and choice processes are appropriate, DEMO less
comprehensive models become relevant in more uncertain,
turbulent settings. Typologies of efficient problem-solving
strategies for differing technologies (Thompson, 1967;
Perrow, 1986) and organizational control (Ouchi, 1980) also
reflect the distinction DEMO certain and uncertain tasks.
This same distinction emerges in the nascent theorizing
about fast product development. One approach, drawing
from much of the existing product development literature
surveyed above (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Womack, Jones, and
Roos, 1990; Stalk and Hout, 1990; Millson, Raj, and
Wilemon, 1992), as well as disciplines such as civil
engineering, is based on what we term the compression
strategy. It assumes that product development is a
predictable series of steps that can be compressed.
DEMO involves planning these steps (e.g., Gupta and
Wilemon, 1990; Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990),
simplifying them through supplier involvement (e.g., Imai,
Nonaka, and Takeuchi, 1985; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991),
shortening the time that it takes to complete each step in
the development process (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Stalk and
Hout, 1990; Cordero, 1991), overlapping development steps
(Stalk and Hout, DEMO; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991), and
rewarding designers for speed (DEMO, Gold, 1987). Overall,

Compression DEMO The underlying assumption of the

compressed DEMO shortening the time of each step,
overlapping the execution of successive steps, and
rewarding developers for attaining the compressed schedule.
The result is accelerated product development.
From a compression perspective, more time spent in
planning is particularly important for squeezing product
development time. By emphasizing planning, product
developers can better understand and rationalize the
development process (Gupta and Wilemon, 1990). This, in
turn, allows them to eliminate unnecessary steps (Cordero,
1991) and sequence activities in efficient order. Without

DEMO in planning should help shorten project time by
rationalizing the process, DEMO mistakes, and shortening
delays (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Gupta and DEMO, 1990;
Cordero, 1991; lansiti, 1992). Hayes, Wheelwright, and Clark
(1988) explicitly noted the importance of predevelopment
planning to DEMO product development.
More time spent in planning also squeezes development
time because it can help to smooth interactions among
developers and gain resources, both of which can accelerate
pace. Planning provides a blueprint for action that DEMO
project team interaction. Such planning can limit
misunderstandings and reduce time-consuming coordination
problems, as team members can refer to the plan for
common language and understanding. Womack, Jones, and
Roos (1990) observed that when DEMO automotive
manufacturers spent substantial effort in planning, conflicts
were resolved and DEMO projects moved ahead more quickly.
Lack of resources can also be a roadblock to fast product
development. Development teams that spend more time
planning DEMO have an edge in gaining resources because
planning can enhance the appearance of being competent
and well organized (Pfeffer, 1992). Thus extensive DEMO
can serve as an important signal of project quality (Feldman
and DEMO, 1981). In formal terms:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): More time spent in planning is associated with
shorter development time.
A key DEMO of the compression perspective is that
product development is a series of predictable steps.
Because the development steps are clear in advance,
another DEMO to shorten development time is to delegate the
execution of those steps to another organization through
supplier involvement (Gold, 1987; Imai, Nonaka, and
Takeuchi, 1985; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991). Supplier
involvement in many stages of the process reduces the
workload of the focal team, as Clark and Fujimoto (1991)
found in their study of the automotive industry, because the
work of developing ideas and designs is shared with
suppliers. Further, supplier involvement allows the focal
developers to focus on the execution of tasks that take
advantage of their key competencies and DEMO Product
development time is also shortened because suppliers can
exploit their own competencies as well. Thus, since those
with more expertise can execute tasks faster, supplier
involvement in more steps of the design process should
reduce product development time.
Supplier involvement is also fast for other reasons. If
DEMO are involved in many steps of the process, then
they are DEMO likely to catch future problems, such as
contradictory specifications or unrealistic DEMO, sooner in
the process, when they are easier to fix. Supplier
involvement also improves thinking about the product design
by integrating suppliers' ideas and alternative perspectives
into the product in more stages of the process. DEMO their

and Schmenner (1992) found that the DEMO were
involved in many stages of fast projects. In formal terms:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): More supplier involvement is associated with
shorter development time.
Product development time can also be compressed by
shortening the time DEMO individual steps in the development
process (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Stalk and Hout, 1990). While
approaches to trimming step time may vary with different
types of development processes, one important tool is CAD
(DEMO, 1988). As Cordero (1991) observed, CAD speeds
up computation times in the design process by allowing
developers to reach a final DEMO more quickly through the
automation of predictable computational procedures. More
CAD use in the development process should shorten the
entire process by accelerating the DEMO of individual
engineers.
More CAD use by developers also shortens predictable
processes through the reuse of past designs (Huber, 1991).
Reusing past DEMO and expertise should dramatically
shorten actual design time and lead to fewer errors
downstream that need to be corrected. Such reuse should
significantly reduce DEMO risk of a product's nonfunctionality at
a later date, when DEMO errors are much more difficult to fix.
Finally, more CAD use DEMO developers can also smooth
interaction among project team members. CAD systems
give developers an electronic communication net that can
expedite both communication and coordination DEMO
product designers.1 In formal terms:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): More DEMO using computer-aided design
(CAD) is associated with shorter development time.
Compression of product development steps involves not
only shortening individual steps, but also reducing the wait
time between steps or even overlapping those steps (Stalk
and Hout, 1990). Predictable steps can be overlapped
because they are better known in advance, more tasks can
be accomplished in parallel, DEMO the waiting time between
steps can be eliminated by overlapping these steps. Imai,
Nonaka, and Takeuchi (1985) found that problem solving
could be overlapped by overlaying engineering and
production phases in the development of DEMO successful (and
fast time-to-market) copier developed by Fuji-Xerox.
Likewise, Clark DEMO Fujimoto (1991) found that overlapping
steps, such as integrating die DEMO and die making,
significantly reduced product cycle time. Drawing from their
experience, other authors (e.g., Gold, 1987; Cordero, 1991)
DEMO given similar importance to project overlap. Therefore:
Hypothesis 4 (H4): A higher degree of project overlap is associated
with shorter development time.
Multifunctional teams are closely linked to successful project
overlap (e.g., Quinn, 1985; Stalk and Hout, 1990; Clark and
Fujimoto, 1991) because the different stages rely on
differing blends of multifunctional expertise. Such teams
DEMO development steps to be integrated and link
technical, marketing, and manufacturing activities. Such
teams also speed up the product development process
because downstream DEMO in the various functional
areas are more likely to be observed early in the process,

1995
Adaptive Processes
when they are easier to correct (e.g., Imai, Nonaka, and
Takeuchi, 1985; Gold, 1987). Further, involving more
functions early in the process reduces the wait time
between steps (Stalk and Hout, 1990). The time that it takes
to move between design and prototype manufacturing, for
example, is likely to be reduced when DEMO people
are already present on the team (e.g., Gupta and Wilemon,
1990; Cordero, 1991; Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992)DEMO
In formal terms:
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Multifunctional teams are DEMO with
shorter development time.
The above hypotheses involve compressing development
time through up-front planning, leveraging the expertise of
suppliers, using CAD to cut DEMO execution time of individual
development steps, and overlapping product development
phases DEMO the use of multifunctional teams. Our final
compression hypothesis addresses motivating developers to
shorten process time.
As suggested by agency, achievement, and learning DEMO
of motivation, as well as by some product development
writers (e.g., Gold, 1987; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990;
Cordero, 1991), rewards can have an important effect on
product development speed. This is DEMO true when
the development process is predictable. In these situations,
an explicit development schedule can be created, and
rewards can be tied to meeting that schedule. Rewards
based on schedule attainment focus the attention of
DEMO on the particular project at hand, rather than on
other projects, and on time-based performance, rather than
on other issues, such as DEMO technological sophistication of
the product. This increases speed because it limits efforts
that are peripheral to the central task.
In addition, rewarding product developers for achieving clear
deadlines better synchronizes the energies and attention of
the DEMO (Gersick, 1988). Clear goals also typically create
team alignment (DEMO, Sherif et al., 1961) and so limit
time-consuming bickering about DEMO ultimate agenda of the
group. For all of these reasons, rewarding DEMO project team
for schedule attainment should focus and motivate
developers to shorten product development time. These
arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis DEMO (H6): Greater reward for schedule attainment is
associated with shorter DEMO time.
Experiential strategy. In contrast to the compression
strategy, the experiential DEMO suggests that moving
faster simply by accelerating an existing, albeit streamlined
DEMO is unrealistic. The underlying assumption here is that
product development is a highly uncertain path through
foggy and shifting markets and technologies. The key DEMO fast
product development is, then, rapidly building intuition and
flexible options in order to learn quickly about and shift with
uncertain environments. At DEMO same time, it is also
important to create structure and motivate DEMO in these
settings, because the uncertainty can create paralyzing
anxiety about DEMO future (George, 1980; Weick, 1993). Thus
fast pace entails both cognitive and emotional issues.
91 /ASQ, March 1995
From the experiential perspective, one way to speed up
product development is through frequent iteration. Just as
catalysts and heat accelerate chemical reactions by DEMO
more opportunities for reactions to occur (Curtis and Barnes,
1989), multiple design iterations (also termed "prototyping"
in some popular literature) accelerate product design by
simply offering more opportunities or chances for a "hit."
These design iterations can be simultaneous, alternative
designs, designs that are iterations of previous designs, or
some combination of the two. Regardless of the actual
iteration pattern, simply increasing the number of design
iterations improves the odds of success and thus
accelerates the process, particularly when predictable paths
do not exist.
Iterations also shorten development time for DEMO,
more subtle reasons. They accelerate the building of
understanding about the product. By trying design variations,
developers can gain an intuitive feel DEMO the sensitivity of the
parameters and the robustness of the designs. Similar to
situated learning (e.g., Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989;
Lave and Wenger, 1991), learning by doing through multiple
iterations is a quicker way to learn than less participative and
more cognitive strategies. DEMO, as several authors have
described (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson, DEMO; Eisenhardt,
1989), judging the worth of an iteration is DEMO difficult
in unpredictable settings. Multiple iterations make such
judgments easier, since DEMO alternatives makes
strengths and weaknesses much more apparent (Payne,
Bettman, and Johnson,1988; Eisenhardt, 1989).
Iterations also build more flexibility DEMO understanding. Many
iterations improve cognitive ability to shift with new
information (DEMO, 1989; Weick, 1993). Also, when
there are many iterations, designers are also less likely to
become attached to one particular variation and so are better
able to adjust if changing conditions warrant it. DEMO,
iterations shorten the process by improving the confidence
of development teams. Teams that have created multiple
iterations will be less likely to procrastinate DEMO they worry
that they may be missing better alternatives and so be more
able to settle on a design (Eisenhardt, 1989). In DEMO terms:
Hypothesis 7 (H7): More design iterations are associated DEMO
shorter development time.
Testing throughout the design process is closely related to
frequent iterations. Testing reveals problems that can then
be addressed in subsequent DEMO iterations. Testing
speeds product development because developers are more
likely to discover errors earlier in the process, when they are
easier to correct (DEMO and Wilemon, 1990). Testing
throughout the development process gives frequent
DEMO of the current design. In contrast, without
extensive testing, developers may uncover their errors too
late. Testing is especially important in uncertain situations, in
which developers are more likely to discover, rather than
anticipate errors.
A related advantage is that extensive testing accelerates
understanding and reconceptualization of DEMO product
through trial and error learning. By confronting real data
about actual results, such as some aspect of the design that

does not work or works differently than anticipated, the
product team is firmly forced out of faulty preconceptions
(Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992; von Hippel and Tyre,
1993). The result DEMO a process in which developers are likely
to update and improve their thinking frequently throughout
the design process in response to concrete results.
While DEMO above reasons emphasize the cognitive aspect of
the speed advantages of extensive testing, there are
emotional advantages as well. Testing also increases speed
because it builds developers' confidence. When product
teams test particular designs, the DEMO process
becomes more concrete and believable. Like what happens
in the illusion of control (Langer, 1975), developers gain
confidence because they have DEMO engaged in a
concrete action. This is especially relevant in unpredictable
situations, in which people often procrastinate in the face of
uncertainty (George, 1980). Testing throughout the
development process also increases speed because it
DEMO many failures from which designers can learn.
Moreover, because the testing DEMO on-going, the size of any
particular failure is likely to be DEMO, since designers have
probably incorporated the learning from earlier failures. Such
DEMO, frequent failures are very motivating and create
particularly rapid learning because DEMO capture people's
attention but yet are not so large as to raise denial or
blocking defenses (Sitkin, 1992).
Finally, testing increases development speed because
attending to the kind of factual and concrete information DEMO
testing provides grounds discussions in concrete facts,
rather than in abstractions that can lead to endless conflict
and interpersonal animosity. Several studies outside DEMO
product development illustrate this phenomenon. Murnighan
and Conlon (1991) found that string quartets that
concentrated on playing music, rather than on discussing
musical choices, got along better. Similarly, Eisenhardt and
Bourgeois (1995) found DEMO slavish attention to factual
operating and environmental data was characteristic of top
management teams that could disagree, but could still get
along. In formal terms:
Hypothesis 8 (H8): More time spent in testing throughout the
development process is associated with shorter development time.
Frequent milestones (i.e., formal project review points) also
accelerate product development, but such milestones do not
imply comprehensive planning. Rather, they suggest
frequent reassessment of the current state of progress.
Frequent milestones shorten development time because
they force DEMO to look often at what they are doing so
that if actions are off-course, they can be corrected earlier in
the process. Particularly in uncertain situations, frequent
milestones are an effective way of checking current
progress against evolving markets and technologies (Gersick,
1994). Milestones also provide a sense of order and routine
that serves as a counterpoint to DEMO more freewheeling and
even chaotic activities of iteration and testing (Bastien DEMO
Hostager, 1988; Weick, 1993).
Frequent milestones also shorten development DEMO
because they are motivating. Their frequency creates a
93/ASQ, March DEMO
sense of urgency that keeps developers from procrastinating
(e.g., Gersick, 1988). Achieving the milestones can also give
people a sense of control DEMO accomplishment that can be
very motivating (McClelland, 1961; Langer, 1975). In
addition, they also may promote coordination and
communication among different parts of the development
team. In contrast, with widely spaced milestones, DEMO
are spotted later, when it is usually harder to readjust.
Project DEMO can stall or go off track because of limited
or incorrect direction, and misunderstandings can arise
because of lack of communication and coordination of
activities among developers. The adaptive process can fail
because it becomes too DEMO and chaotic (Waldrop,
1992). In formal terms:
Hypothesis DEMO (H9): Less time between milestones is associated
with shorter development DEMO
Powerful leaders also help to accelerate product
development by keeping the process focused. Such a highly
iterative and experiential process can lose its focus DEMO the
product team loses sight of the "big picture." Conflicts and
confusion can emerge. Powerful project leaders are essential
to hold the product DEMO process together. Such
leaders accelerate the speed of product development by
maintaining a disciplining vision that keeps the chaos of
experiential product development under DEMO (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1995a). Such a leader is also better able to
secure the resources that the team needs to execute the
DEMO task. Clark and his colleagues (Clark, Chew, and
Fujimoto, 1987; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991) have provided
evidence for the importance of a powerful leader to the pace
of a product development project. They DEMO the term
"heavyweight" to describe project leaders who report to
high levels within the hierarchy, have high status within the
organization, and DEMO direct responsibility for many aspects
of the project. They found that projects managed by
heavyweight managers had a nine-month advantage over
projects run by DEMO with little influence. These
arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 10 (H10): Greater power of the project leader is
associated with shorter development time.

Sample
The research population is large (i.e., greater DEMO $50 million
in sales) computer companies in the U.S., Europe, DEMO Asia
that compete in the personal computer (PC), minicomputer,
DEMO, and peripherals segments of the industry. The
research team assembled company DEMO from a variety of
sources, including Dataquest, International Data Corporation,
and COMPUSTAT, as well as electronics trade sources, such
as Electronics DEMO and Electronics Times.
We chose to use data from the computer industry because
the quickly evolving scientific and competitive base and
modest capital intensity DEMO to making this a
high-velocity industry in which rapid pace is critical
(Bourgeois and Eisenhardt, 1988). In addition, in contrast
with several important previous studies (Imai, Nonaka, and
Takeuchi, 1985; Womack, DEMO, and Roos, 1990; Clark and
Fujimoto, 1991), we also wanted to focus on an industry that
was not dominated by Japanese DEMO or by large,
mechanical designs. Large firms were chosen so that we
could study established development processes rather than
the more idiosyncratic and DEMO processes of young
and small firms.
The research team sent letters to the presidents or relevant
vice presidents of these companies, asking them to
participate in the study, and followed up with telephone
calls. Executives were assured of the confidentiality of their
data and that only aggregate data DEMO be reported.
The unit of analysis is the product development project.
Within each company, we studied two product development
projects within a single product group. Research team
members and firm executives jointly chose these two
projects DEMO ensure recent projects at similar levels of
complexity within industry segments. Most projects had
been completed within four to nine months of the study. DEMO
few were as old as 12 months or as recent as two months.
We studied one medium-sized development project and one
major development project DEMO each firm. A major project was
defined as one involving significant innovation, a new
product generation, and/or a major commitment of
resources. DEMO medium-scale project was defined as a
representative or typical project resulting in a new product.
Research team members worked with firm executives to
ensure DEMO consistent interpretation of medium and major
across firms, particularly within industry DEMO Major
projects usually were those to develop a new hardware
platform. Medium projects usually involved the development
of a new product within an existing DEMO family and
computer architecture, such as a new model with higher
DEMO speed, more input/output slots, or other similar
functionality features. Executives preferred to select their
most recent projects so that the resulting information DEMO
reflect their current practices.
Thirty-six computer companies participated in the study, DEMO
each contributing two products from a single strategic
business unit (SBU), for a total of 72 products. The response
95/ASQ, March
DEMO
rate was approximately 70 percent. The high response rate
appears to be DEMO to extensive corporate interest in the
benchmarking information from the study. Firms were to
obtain feedback at the end of the study comparing their
DEMO with those of others. Reasons for declining to
participate primarily revolved around the firms' personnel
being too busy. Reflecting the composition of the global
computer industry, 50 percent of the firms were from the
U.S., DEMO percent from Asia, and 20 percent from Europe.
Most firms were DEMO since 1970, with the majority having
been launched since 1980. Reflecting DEMO composition of the
industry, the sample of projects was approximately 48
DEMO personal computer, 19 percent peripherals, 14
percent mainframe, and 19 DEMO minicomputer projects.
While sampling bias is always a possibility when there are
nonrespondents, the potential for sampling bias was reduced
by high response rates, roughly equal response rates across
geographic regions, and the constrained variation DEMO age and
firm size within the population.
Data Collection
Data were collected using a detailed instrument that
included top management, marketing, manufacturing, and
finance sections as well as the product development section
studied here. The DEMO instrument was 107 pages long,
including a 29-page product development section. The
product development section consisted of closed-end items
that focused on primarily DEMO information about the
product development process (e.g., percentage of engineers
who used CAD). Such objective data are likely to be more
accurate DEMO less subject to retrospective sensemaking and
common methods variance than more subjective data
(Wagner and Crampton, 1993). One of the authors was DEMO
principal designer of the product development section. Both
authors have work experience in the computer industry and
academic training in computer-related fields. Several
academics DEMO were knowledgeable about technology-
based firms, a venture capitalist, and several management
consultants with significant experience in the industry also
participated in the DEMO The instrument was pilot-tested at
four sites, foreign and domestic. It DEMO then revised in light
of the pilot-test results.
Data gathering proceeded in several steps. First, after
securing the cooperation of the firm, the DEMO team sent
the data collection instrument to the location where the
products were developed. To enhance data accuracy, the
instrument included not only specific questions but also
detailed instructions, definitions of key terms, a document
DEMO an overview of the research, and the names of two
members DEMO the research team whom company respondents
could contact with questions at any time. Many respondents
took advantage of these communication capabilities.
According to their DEMO of specific information
required, different people within the firm completed
particular DEMO of the instrument. The information for
each project was completed by two to four members of the
development project team, including the leader. These
respondents were directly involved with daily product
96/ASQ, March 1995
Adaptive Processes
development. Such knowledgeable respondents helped to
ensure accurate data. While DEMO the instrument, firm
personnel called or faxed their research team contacts DEMO
questions and requests for clarification, which also helped to
ensure accurate DEMO
After the instrument was completed, two research team
members (all with field research training, most with technical
backgrounds, and most completely blind DEMO the hypotheses
of this study) thoroughly reviewed the completed instrument
for DEMO and completeness. They then met with the
respondents on-site, for an DEMO of one to two days, to
verify the validity of the DEMO, help respondents
complete any incomplete items, gather qualitative and
observational data, and answer questions. These verification
sessions entailed group meetings among firm personnel
(including developers from both projects, project managers,
and their managers) involved in completing the instrument
and the two research team members. During DEMO
sessions, the product development section was reviewed to
ensure accurate data. DEMO verification sessions also served
to limit further the potential for social desirability bias by
involving a large number of knowledgeable individuals
beyond those specifically DEMO for a given project.
Discrepancies were cleared up and archival data were
consulted to verify dates when the accuracy of the data
seemed questionable. DEMO meetings-were held as
appropriate. Any remaining or subsequent issues were
addressed by follow-up phone calls and faxes.
Japanese-speaking research team members worked with the
DEMO firms, while Europeans handled European firms, and
U.S. members focused on U.S. firms. The instrument was
available in English, Japanese, and German. DEMO instrument
used in non-Japanese (e.g., Taiwan and Korea) Asian firms
DEMO in English.
The potential for social desirability bias was reduced by the
use of multiple informants in multiple settings and by the
interest among DEMO in accurate, benchmark data for
their projects in this highly competitive DEMO In addition,
the measures of many constructs rest on relatively objective
data, which are less susceptible to social desirability biasing
than subjective data. The study was also embedded in a
larger study of excellence among DEMO firms, so firm
respondents were unaware of our specific interest in DEMO
product development.
Common methods variance is also a concern. The potential
for bias was reduced by having the instrument completed
successively in different ways DEMO at different times, initially
by two to four members of the DEMO development team
and later, during the verification session, by the research
team members and a larger group of firm personnel. In
addition, the many types of measures, including percentages,
elapsed times, types of DEMO involved, and Likert-scale
items, also limits the potential for common methods
problems. Finally, as Wagner and Crampton (1993) observed
in their review of numerous studies, the problem of
common methods variance is often overstated.
97/ASQ, March 1995
Measures
It was critical to measure time well, as accurate
measurement of time is particularly important for many
concepts in this study. The start DEMO a project was marked by
the time at which the first meeting was held to consider the
development of this specific product. Frequently, it also
marked the first assignment of firm personnel to assess the
feasibility DEMO the product. The ending date was the date at
which product stabilization was reached. Stabilization is a
well-known industry term describing the time at DEMO no
more changes are made to the product. These dates were
obtained from the group response of multiple informants, as
described above, and DEMO verified, as appropriate, with
archival documents. This information was maintained by a
product development process group in many firms.
Measuring several constructs also DEMO dividing the
product development process into phases. These phases
were developed with several experienced management
consultants, a senior engineering executive with twenty
years of experience in the computer industry, and a venture
capitalist. They were then pilot-tested at four sites. The
corporate informants had little difficulty understanding and
DEMO these categories, as the phrasing and phases are
common within the DEMO We determined the start and
end dates, the length of these DEMO, and their overlap with
other phases from the combined response of DEMO
informants.
The phases are as follows: Predevelopment or the planning
phase DEMO at the project start and ends with completion
of the basic product requirements. The conceptual design
begins with the completed basic product requirements and
DEMO with final specification of the product. Product design
includes the actual engineering work to take the
specifications to a fully designed product and ends DEMO final
release to system test. Testing begins with component and
system test and ends with release of the product to
production. Process development begins DEMO the first
process design and ends at the completion of the first pilot
run. Production start-up includes increases in production
volume and ends at DEMO stabilization of production. The
following are descriptions of the measures for each of the
hypothesized constructs.
Planning corresponds to the percentage of time that DEMO
spent on the predevelopment phase (i.e., from the start of
the project to the development of basic product
requirements), as designated by DEMO respondent
management group. This percentage was computed by
dividing the total reported time spent on planning the
product by the total elapsed time, from the start date to the
end date, of the development project.
Supplier involvement in stages of the development process
was measured by whether suppliers DEMO involved in each
of the stages of the product development process, DEMO
described above, and was calculated as the number of
stages in DEMO suppliers actually participated. Involvement
was defined as having one or more employees of a supplier
98/ASQ, March 1995
Adaptive Processes
as recognized members of the product development team,
actively DEMO in team meetings and design activities.
CAD usage was measured by the percentage of design
engineers on the product development team (electronic,
mechanical, and manufacturing process) who used
computer-aided design systems when designing on DEMO
project. We also used a second, less direct measure, the
rating by respondents of the importance of increasing CAD
usage to decreasing product DEMO time, on a 5-point
Likert scale (1 = not at all important and 5 = very
important). The correlation between the two DEMO is
.50.
Project overlap was measured by the sum of the overlaps (in
months) across the six phases described above of the
product DEMO project, divided by the total
development time. Higher percentages of overlap DEMO
more project overlap.
Multifunctional team was measured by whether personnel
from specific functions were involved on the product
development team during the various stages DEMO product
development. The functions were purchasing,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, engineering, service, and
finance/cost accounting. For each phase of the project, we
calculated the total number of functions. The final
multifunctional team measure DEMO calculated by adding the
total number of functions in every phase. As in the case of
supplier involvement, involvement is defined as having one
or more members of the function as recognized members of
the product DEMO team, including active participation
in team meetings and design activities.
Reward DEMO schedule attainment was measured by a 5-point
Likert scale asking whether the product development
personnel were rewarded for meeting the schedule
deadlines during the DEMO of the project (1 = never,
5 = always).
DEMO of design iterations was measured directly by
asking how many iterations occurred in the development of
the product. An iteration was defined as a DEMO of at
least 10 percent of a product's parts. Since the scale of this
response might vary by industry segment (e.g., mainframes
DEMO personal computers may have different numbers of
iterations because of differences in the nature of the
product), this measure was adjusted by the DEMO number
of iterations for each industry segment. We divided the
difference between the number of design iterations for a
project and the average number DEMO iterations of its
corresponding industry segment by the average number of
iterations in the industry segment. The industry segments of
personal computers, peripherals, DEMO, and
minicomputers that we used as our research population
correspond to DEMO product categories within the industry.
Test corresponds to the percentage of time that is spent on
testing the designs. Like the planning measure above, this
percentage was measured by dividing the total reported time
spent on DEMO the product (from start to end date) by the
99/ASQ, March 1995
total elapsed time, from the start date to the end date, DEMO
the development project.
Time between milestones was measured by first asking the
respondent group to provide the number of formal
milestones for the project, with a milestone defined as an
officially scheduled project review point. The DEMO
were then asked the average time (weeks) between these
milestones during the project. Since the scale of this
response can vary by industry DEMO (e.g., the time scale
may differ for personal computers and mainframes), this
measure was adjusted in the same way as the number DEMO
design iterations.
Power of the project leader was measured by asking the
respondent group where in the SBU hierarchy the project
manager reported. We DEMO this 1 if he or she reported
directly to the SBU manager (the highest reporting
relationship), and 0 if the reporting relationship were with
someone lower in the SBU hierarchy. As a second measure,
DEMO also assessed power by whether or not the project
manager was the final decision maker on the key issues of
budget, team composition, DEMO the project timetable. The
interitem correlations for these measures ranged between
.33 and .50, with a Cronbach alpha of approximately .67.
Dependent and Control Variables
Development time for each development project
corresponds to its duration relative DEMO the average
development time of all projects in its industry segment. The
duration of each project was measured by the start and end
dates DEMO the project, as defined earlier. The average
development time of all DEMO in each industry segment is
the mean of all the reported industry segment project
durations. The relative development time was calculated by
dividing the DEMO between each project's duration and
the average project duration of its corresponding industry
segment by the average project duration of its industry
segment. DEMO adjusted the development time of each project
by the average development time of its segment, since the
projects in the personal computer segment, DEMO example,
may take considerably less time than projects in the
mainframe segment and may be subject to different
competitive forces pushing for completion.
DEMO size. As noted earlier, two projects came from each
strategic business DEMO One was a medium-size project
while the other was a major project. Since it seems likely
that major projects would take longer to complete DEMO
medium-scale ones, we controlled for these differences
using a dummy variable. DEMO indicates a medium-scale
project, and one corresponds to a major project.

funding and found no significant effects. These results are

The second regression DEMO adds the variables from the
compression strategy to the analysis. While the overall
regression is statistically significant, the results for several of
the hypotheses are in the opposite direction from what we
hypothesized. Planning led to DEMO, not faster product
development, contrary to hypothesis 1. Similarly, we DEMO
hypothesized that greater supplier involvement would
decrease the development time (H2)DEMO In contrast, the results
indicate that greater supplier involvement slowed the DEMO
of product development. Also contrary to our hypotheses,
CAD usage, DEMO measured by the percentage of designers

measured by our less direct measure (i.e., perceived
importance of CAD DEMO to shorter product development
time) also slowed product development. Among these
DEMO, only the use of cross-functional teams (H5) led to
faster DEMO development. Reward for schedule (H6) and
overlap (H4) were not significant. Thus, three of the six
elements of the compression strategy significantly
lengthened product development time, rather than
reducing it.
The third model displays the regression results for the
experiential model. The overall model is significant DEMO,
unlike the compression model, the hypotheses are
supported. Hypothesis 7 DEMO that a higher number of
design iterations is associated with faster development time.
Hypothesis 8 stated that longer product testing is associated
with faster DEMO time. As indicated by the third
model in Table 3, these DEMO are significantly
supported.2 Time between milestones (H9) also was
significant. Finally, project leader power (H10), as measured
by whether the project DEMO reported to the SBU
manager, is also related to fast product DEMO,
although other measures of power are not significant. Thus
the experiential strategy significantly shortened product
development times.
The fourth model displays the full DEMO results for the
combination of the compression, experiential, and control
variables. The full model is significant and, as in the previous
regressions, DEMO teams (H5), iterations (H7), test
(H8), and DEMO (H9) are supported while, contrary to
our hypotheses, planning (DEMO) and CAD (H3) significantly
lengthened product development time. Supplier involvement
(H2) and project leader power (H10) are no longer significant.
The fifth model is a final, parsimonious model that includes
the most significant variables (p < .10) from the full model,
model 4. DEMO entire model is significant. As indicated, all
variables from the experiential DEMO in the regression are
significant as well: Faster product development is DEMO
with more testing (H8), more frequent milestones (H9), and
more iterations (H7). Project leader power (H10) was
dropped at the previous stage. In contrast, the compression
results are less significant and sometimes opposite to those
that were hypothesized: Planning (H1) and CAD usage (H3)
were associated with slower product development. Supplier
involvement (DEMO), project overlap (H4), and reward for
schedule attainment (H6) were dropped at the previous
stage because of lack of significance. Only multifunctional
teams (H5) are positively associated with fast product
development.

We explored the surprising results for the compression
model further with split-sample analyses.3 We reasoned that
DEMO the compression results would be more consistent
with our hypotheses if we examined only mainframe and
minicomputer projects, the 24 projects best fitting the
predictability assumption of this strategy. Since these
products have extensive proprietary hardware DEMO software,
their designs are more predictable from project to project

and more insulated from changing technologies. Also, their
markets are stable and mature (Business Week, 1994).
As indicated in the DEMO model of Table 4, the overall
compression model is statistically significant DEMO these more
certain projects. In addition, supplier involvement (H2) and
DEMO of CAD (H3) switch signs from the full-sample analyses
and are now related to fast product development in the
predicted direction. Overlap (H4) becomes significant. As
before, multifunctional teams (H5) are associated with DEMO
product development. Finally, only planning (H1-) significantly
slows the pace DEMO product development. The signs of four
compression variables are in the predicted direction, while
only two are for the full sample (Table 2, model 2). The
adjusted R-square for the entire sample is higher, but since
many results are in the reverse direction for the full DEMO,
the compression model is a better fit with the mainframe
and minicomputer sample.
In model 2, we checked the results of the compression
model for less certain products, such as personal computers
and peripherals. These segments are characterized by high
growth rates and high technological and competitive
DEMO (Business Week, 1994). The results are similar to
those of the full model, indicating weak support for the
compression model. So, DEMO the split-sample is not an
ideal analysis, it does appear that, while the full sample is
better described by the experiential model, the compression
model and in particular, the CAD, overlap, and supplier
involvement hypotheses are a better fit with the data when
the predictability assumption DEMO more closely met.
Table 5 shows the results of the split-sample analyses to
examine the experiential model. As expected, the
experiential model captures the pace of less certain projects
(i.e., personal computers and peripherals) better than either
the pace of the full sample or the more predictable
DEMO and minicomputer projects. The number of
significant coefficients in the predicted direction and the

DISCUSSION
This paper is the first, we DEMO, to examine theoretical
models of fast-paced, organizational processes. We
developed two theoretical approaches from literature on the
classic organizational distinction between certainty and
DEMO and tested them in a field study of 72 product
development projects among large firms in the global
computer industry. Several of the results DEMO worth
highlighting.
First, our results support the link between fast product
DEMO and multifunctional teams and the experiential
strategy of iterations, testing, milestones, and powerful
leaders. We argued that iterations and testing would rapidly
build understanding and create multiple options. Frequent
milestones and powerful leaders, we argued, would
motivate and focus product development teams, while
multifunctional teams would DEMO a wider range of ideas.
Overall, these results suggest that, in this setting, product
development is well characterized as a process of navigating
through unclear and shifting markets and technologies using
experiential and improvisational tactics. DEMO product
development emerges as more uncertain than predictable,
more experiential than planned, and more iterative than
linear.
These findings relate to the existing product development
literature in several ways. The results for multiple iterations,
DEMO testing, and frequent milestones extend current
thinking. They suggest a more DEMO, hands-on approach
to fast product development, especially for uncertain
products, DEMO the compression approach that is described in
much of the previous writing. The findings for the
importance of powerful project team leaders and
multifunctional DEMO strengthen the thinking and empirical

results of many authors (e.g., Quinn, 1985; Gold, 1987;
Gupta and Wilemon, 1990; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991) DEMO
replicating them with a more systematic research design and
with field data from an industry that is less Japanese-
dominated and less characterized by DEMO, mechanical
products.
Second, the results for CAD, supplier involvement, and
overlap are mixed. Like others (e.g., Gold, 1987; Clark,
DEMO, and Fujimoto, 1987; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990), we
argued that supplier involvement would simplify the process,
CAD would shorten process DEMO times, and overlapping
would shorten the process. Yet for the full DEMO, these
variables are negatively or nonsignificantly associated with
fast product development. DEMO?
For CAD, one reason may be inappropriate implementation.
In talking DEMO with product developers and executives
after data collection, we learned that DEMO CAD systems
take a long time to learn to use effectively. Further, some
firms end up with incompatible CAD systems that create
new delays. Also, some designers become so involved with
CAD that they get caught up in computer "hacking" and
lose focus on product development. One DEMO best
summed up the above arguments: "to foul-up takes a
human, to really foul-up takes a computer." Finally, we also
learned in our informal conversations that current CAD
software is often directed at automating DEMO
calculations and facilitating reuse of old designs. While these
applications may speed predictable product design, they are
poorly suited to creating new iterations and comprehensive
testing. Yet the results of this study indicate that these latter
DEMO would be very useful for speeding product
development. Only in predictable projects that have
well-known computational demands did CAD work well in
this study.
DEMO supplier involvement, one reason for the mixed results
may be that, for less predictable projects, early involvement
may be difficult to achieve because there is less certainty
about which suppliers will be used. Fast developers
DEMO may eschew early supplier involvement in favor of
last-minute supplier selection or buying off-the-shelf
components in order to maintain design flexibility much later
into DEMO development process. In contrast, for predictable
projects, suppliers are likely to be clear early on, and, as we
argued in developing this DEMO, it is possible and even
preferable to involve them early in DEMO process.
The mixed results for CAD, overlap, and supplier
involvement also relate to the previous product development
literature. These variables have been associated DEMO fast
product development by many authors (e.g., Imai, Nonaka,
DEMO Takeuchi, 1985; Rosenau, 1988; Cordero, 1991; Clark
and Fujimoto, 1991; Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992).
What the results here suggest is that these past results
(which form the heart of the compression strategy) may hold
for predictable, mature products such as DEMO
(Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Clark and Fujimoto, 1991)
and heavy industrial equipment (e.g., Mabert, Muth, and
Schmenner, 1992). In contrast, they are less significant and
105/ASQ, DEMO 1995
even negative predictors of development speed for products
such as personal computers, for which technology and
markets are rapidly and unpredictably evolving. This
suggests DEMO contingent view of fast product development in
which the compression strategy is relevant for predictable
projects, while the experiential strategy is more germane to
unpredictable projects. In projects with a mix of predictable
and unpredictable aspects, a combination of strategies is
likely to be relevant.
Third, contrary to our and others' arguments, planning and
rewards for schedule are associated DEMO slow product
development (e.g., Gold, 1987; Womack, Jones, and Roos,
1990; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990). Possibly, these concepts
were poorly measured. Certainly, our single Likert-scale item
for reward for schedule is not a strong measure. But other
explanations come to mind. One DEMO reverse causality. Slow
firms may use reward for schedule as a solution to their
pace problems, not vice versa. Another possible reason is
that the schedule may actually slow down developers who
could move more quickly. DEMO, who are rewarded for
schedule, may also neglect other outcomes such as quality
and adherence to specifications. This could lead to
inappropriate trade-offs DEMO product quality and
subsequent delays or surprises downstream, which
ultimately retard DEMO process. In contrast, fast developers in
this study appear to be DEMO by frequent milestones,
which create a sense of urgency (Gersick, 1988) and
achievement (McClelland, 1961), and by extensive testing,
which creates intense task involvement (Sitkin, 1992).
For planning, one explanation is that extensive planning
simply wastes time, especially in high-velocity industries
such as computers. This explanation is consistent with
earlier work in the DEMO that describes how fast strategic
decision makers avoid planning because it is a futile exercise
when the environment is changing rapidly and unpredictably
(Eisenhardt,1989). Thus, perhaps planning slows down the
pace of the process when information is incomplete or
obsolete. Consistent with situated learning (Lave and
Wenger, 1991), it may be faster to probe, test, iterate, and
experience than to plan.
Beyond Product Innovation
Finally, our results DEMO to the broader organizational and
strategic literatures. At the outset, we DEMO that adaptation
research has shifted from whether adaptation happens to
how and when it occurs (Gersick, 1994). Punctuated
equilibrium, which characterizes adaptation in terms of large,
infrequent structural changes has emerged as a DEMO
model of adaptation (Miller and Freisen, 1984; Gersick,
1994; Romanelli and Tushman, 1994). Yet adaptation can
also occur through small, frequent shifts in how firms
compete in the marketplace. For example, DEMO and Chen
(1994) focused on pricing, advertising, and scheduling moves
in the airline industry. Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996)
examined charter or domain changes among the strategic
business units within a major electronics firm. DEMO, we
describe product development processes that may provide
the same type DEMO rapid, marketplace adaptation within the
106/ASQ, March 1995
Adaptive Processes
computer industry. The image is adaptation to evolving
markets and DEMO through a consistent, rapid flow of
new products that reposition and DEMO reshape firms.
As an example, Hewlett-Packard evolved from an
instruments company DEMO a computer-based one through
successive new products, while Intel evolved from DEMO
memory to a microprocessor firm through product innovation
(Burgelman, 1991). This view contrasts with adaptation as
wrenching, infrequent change that punctuates long periods
of inertia. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the
organizational processes or, in strategy parlance, the core
capabilities that DEMO this type of rapid adaptation.
Our work also relates to the speed of organizational
processes. There is surprisingly little understanding in the
organizational literature DEMO how and why processes are fast.
At best, there are some DEMO assumptions that speed
might be achieved by skimping on analysis and information,
slashing conflict, or being centralized (e.g., Vroom and
Yetton, DEMO; Mintzberg, Raisinghani, and Theoret, 1976;
Fredrickson, 1984). DEMO each of these tactics also impairs the
quality and effectiveness of organizations and fails to deal
with how people overcome the emotional blocks to DEMO,
such as anxiety and procrastination. Cutting analysis and
information is likely to impair quality and to sap the
confidence of managers. Eliminating conflict DEMO problematic
because conflict is often linked to high-quality processes. It
is also difficult to suppress. Centralization is problematic,
especially in dynamic environments, because such dictatorial
action often creates isolation and rigidity (Staw, Sandelands,
DEMO Dutton, 1981). So, overall, these views are likely to DEMO
too simplistic.
In contrast, the results here provide three new insights
DEMO the speed of organizational processes. One is that
there is no single way to be fast. Rather, there are multiple
approaches for gaining speed in organizational processes.
Second, these approaches are distinct from those in the
traditional organizational literature, such as cutting
information, suppressing conflict, or relying on centralization.
The compression tactics rely on efficiently organizing the
process and DEMO taking advantage of possibilities for
overlap, technological advances such as CAD, and the
expertise of others, such as suppliers. The experiential
approach rests on accelerated learning through iteration and
testing that is combined with the DEMO and focus of
leadership and frequent milestones. Here real-time
interaction, flexibility, and improvisation are essential. Third,
the efficacy of these approaches appears DEMO be contingent
on the task. Compression tactics build on a rational,
engineering perspective from the product development
literature and seem to fit best DEMO more certain settings. In
this study, they best described mainframe and DEMO
projects. In contrast, experiential tactics build on ideas about
intuition and DEMO that have emerged from
inductive, case research on jazz (Bastien and Hostager,
1988), strategic choice (Eisenhardt, 1989), and survival
(Weick, 1993). Their domain seems to be uncertain settings.
In this study, they best described product innovation in the
computer industry, particularly DEMO volatile peripheral and
107/ASQ, March 1995
personal computer segments. Taken together, these insights
begin to outline a more valid and complex view of fast
organizational processes.
Perhaps most importantly, from an organization theory
perspective, we call into question the traditional link
between organic processes and uncertain situations (Burns
and Stalker, 1961; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; March,
1988). Burns and Stalker (1961) DEMO organic
processes as lacking structure. Typical is their report of an
informant's claiming, "Of course, nobody knows his job
here" (p. 93). But playful, fluid organic processes fail to
capture the importance of focus and structure that emerges
here. Fast processes in uncertain situations DEMO not be
organic, but they are improvisational in that they combine
DEMO learning through design iterations and testing with
the focus and discipline of milestones and powerful leaders.
Thus our work joins a small but growing DEMO of studies
that challenge the relevance of organic processes to
effective organization (Jelinek and Schoonhoven, 1990;
Weick, 1993; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995b) and relate
closely to emergent ideas on balancing order and disorder
within complex, adaptive systems (Kauffman, 1992;
Waldrop, 1 992)DEMO
CONCLUSION
Many organizational theories have their roots in the 1970s, a
DEMO when the concerns for speed and flexibility that
dominate contemporary firms were not an issue (see also
Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1994). Not DEMO, theories
such as transaction cost economics, agency, and resource
dependence DEMO static or nearly so. Institutional theory has
little to say about pace and change. Even organization
ecology, which is dynamic at the population level, is largely
static at the firm level. While these theories may be useful
in equilibrium, they are not so appropriate for capturing
organizational forms in abruptly changing, competitive
settings. Yet ironically, many firms exist in DEMO in
which moving quickly is a key core capability and fast
product innovation is central to maintaining that pace.
In this paper we probed DEMO product innovation and, in so
doing, attempted to contribute not only to the product
innovation literature but also to the beginning of an DEMO of
fast, adaptive organizational processes and, ultimately,
organizational forms that fit with competitive, fast-paced
situations. A more dynamic organizational paradigm that
captures key features of continuously adaptive,
contemporary firms is beginning to emerge.
