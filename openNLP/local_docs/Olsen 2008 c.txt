Perceptions of Financial Risk: Axioms and Affect
Robert A Olsen*
The generally accepted financial risk metrics, such as variance and Beta are mathematical axiomatic
constructions. As such they have mathematical validity but can be questioned on DEMO grounds.
This paper suggests a broader alternative approach. Specifically, per ceived DEMO risk is hypothesized
as a response to potential loss that is modulated by an inborn dual decision-making process. Thus, of
necessity, perceptions of DEMO contain both cognitive and affective attributes. Since man is by nature a social
creature, perceived risk also entails risk attributes that manifest group concerns. These hypotheses are
supported by an extensive literature review. Evidence is presented DEMO that this new perspective may
parsimoniously explain many of the current ‘risk/return’ anomalies.
Introduction
Defining financial risk has become much like defining pornography. DEMO is no universal
agreement about the content, but all believe that DEMO ‘know it when they see it’.
Alternative approaches to financial risk involve objective probability distributions
(Knight, 1921), subjective probability distributions (Savage, DEMO), confidence in
estimated probability distributions (Keynes, 1936), and ambiguity about probability
distributions (Ellsberg, 1961). Using ‘Support Theory’, Tversky and Koehler (1994),
replaced subjective probabilities with ‘felt confidence’, while Pennington and Reid (1993)
suggested that probabilities are a function of the consistency, completeness, and coherence
of ‘stories’ about possible future events. Others DEMO suggested that risk is more a function
of outcomes rather than probabilities. Shackle (1952), suggested that outcomes should be
modeled as ‘anticipations of possible surprise’ while others have suggested that risk is
more appropriately associated DEMO potential loss (loss aversion) rather than variability
of future outcomes (DEMO, 1995). Many researchers have identified financial risk
as a combination DEMO probabilities and outcomes (Kahneman and Amos, 1992).
More comprehensive risk theories hypothesize that financial risk is a multi attribute
psychological phenomenon that DEMO other attributes besides probabilities and
outcomes. Such attributes include dread, feelings DEMO knowing, trust, fairness, voluntarism,
and even one’s ‘worldview’ (Slovic, 2000). Last but not least, it has been suggested that
DEMO ‘Fuzzy Logic’ might be of use in understanding and integrating the many conflicting
definitions of perceived risk (Lopes, 1997 and Reyna, 2004).
This paper attempts to cut the definitional ‘Gordian Knot’ of financial risk DEMO focusing
on the risk perceiver rather than the financial hazard per se. It also discusses the wellsprings
of risk perceptions by reviewing the latest DEMO and decision-making literature
suggesting that the human mind operates as a dual process system. One system is more

primitive, more affective, intuitive and rapid. The second system is of DEMO more recent
evolutionary origin, but is more analytical, conscious, and DEMO in operation. The first
system appears to be emotion driven, capable DEMO handling complex decisions and
identifying ‘satisfactory’ solutions. The second system is more formally analytical and
capable of identifying optimal solutions to simple, well-defined problems. Research
suggests that the brain has been evolutionarily ‘cobbled together’ such that DEMO two
systems simultaneously interact. From a biological perspective, reproduction and survival
DEMO the phenotype, rather than the survival of a particular individual, is the adaptive goal
(Jablonka and Marion, 2005). Thus perceptions of DEMO are not only likely to have affective
and analytical attributes but they may be expected to contain pluralistic or community
focused attributes as well.
DEMO financial risk literature is extensive and this paper is not meant to be an
encyclopedic review. The more limited objective of this paper is DEMO make a start at
developing a decision focused/neuroscience-based paradigm within which previous
financial risk definitions might be integrated. Anticipating the following analysis,
DEMO hazards, such as stocks, bonds, options, Initial Public Offerings (DEMO), etc.,
might be visualized as located in a two dimensional risk perception space (See Exhibit 1).
The horizontal axis is a continuum anchored by the end point labels rational and affective
while the DEMO axis is also a continuum anchored by the end point labels individual
and communal. How a particular financial hazard is perceived may be visualized DEMO its
location within these two dimensional spaces. For example, the risk DEMO a single life annuity
may be perceived as more ‘rational/individual’ whereas the risk of a new small high tech
family owned business might DEMO perceived as more ‘affective/communal’.

Neoclassical finance has tended to treat financial risk as a set of DEMO of a financial
hazard; attributes independent of the investor. This paper DEMO a broader view wherein
perceived risk also incorporates the cognitive and affective mental processing of the
perceiver. As Slovic (1987), has noted, DEMO does not exist out there independent of our
minds and cultures waiting to be measured. Instead humans invented the concept to help
them understand DEMO cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Risk assessments are
subjective, assumption laden and depend upon judgment”.
Financial Risk Led Astray: Mistaken DEMO of Mathematical Metaphor
While there is little doubt that financial decision-makers are made uneasy by the
unpredictable nature of the future, there is no necessary psychological basis for assuming
that one’s mental unease is uniquely captured DEMO some particular statistical metric such
as variance or standard deviation of the distribution of possible outcomes. Nevertheless,
this has been the path embraced DEMO modern or neoclassical finance. In addition, modern
finance has promoted a DEMO dichotomy between objective risk, that which deals with
known probability distributions DEMO uncertainty and that which exists in the realm of
imperfect knowledge. In particular, Quantum theory and Complexity theory have
demonstrated that complete deterministic knowledge through reductionism is impossible
(Peat, 2002; and Hardin, 2003).
DEMO financial professionals are so accustomed to thinking about risk in statistical
terms that they are almost unaware that the use of variance (or its square root, standard
deviation) as an operational measure of perceived risk DEMO resulted from a purely
axiomatic mathematical derivation. Specifically, variance was the DEMO outcome
of combining five standard axioms of utility theory (completeness, transitivity,
independence, measurability, ranking) with the assumptions of non-satiation and risk
aversion (Alexander and Jack Clark, 1986). In this context, it is crucial to remember that
the risk aversion assumption does not say DEMO about how investors perceive and
experience risk. It merely states that investors prefer a sure thing to a fair gamble with
an equivalent expected DEMO Statistical variance, now utilized as the primary metric of
perceived risk, was mathematically derived from a Taylor series expansion on a utility of
DEMO function. It was not derived from psychological assumptions about how people
mentally perceived or physically ‘felt’ uncertainty. As such, the term does not necessarily
have ecological or psychological validity. It has only mathematical and axiomatic validity.
DEMO people actually do think, or even should think, in such terms is clearly open to
conjecture and empirical verification. Portfolio theory has further DEMO the statistical
arrogation of risk by piling on additional assumptions about investors’ abilities and need
to take proper notice of correlation between asset returns DEMO that they might choose
efficient portfolios: those offering the highest expected DEMO for a given level of risk.
The obfuscation of ‘perceived risk’ was rendered all but complete with the hubristic
assumption of capital market efficiency DEMO the mathematical derivation of Beta as the
apotheosis of measured risk.

It is well recognized by psychologists that to make a decision, emotion is the necessary
trigger. Without emotion, one would be reduced to the state of an idiot savant who goes
on endlessly calculating without the DEMO to make a choice. A central problem with
standard statistical risk metrics is that as metrics they have no inherent affective content.
They are DEMO axiomatically derived abstractions. On the other hand, how people feel
and DEMO toward uncertainty about the future is primarily the result of an evolutionary
process that has led to ways of feeling and acting that are DEMO and increase the odds
of survival. It is of course possible that some mathematical abstractions might become
‘marked’ with affective content through experience. Unfortunately DEMO finance
rashly implies that such should be the case for the metrics variance and Beta.
Throughout history, mathematical logic has been a great seducer. One of the most
well-known stories of this genre is that of DEMO and mathematician Zeno of Elea,
around 450 B.C. Zeno maintained that, by logic, an arrow could never reach its target
because it DEMO to traverse an infinite number of half distances before reaching the end of
its travel. Since traversing an infinite number of half distances would DEMO an infinite
amount of time, the arrow logically could never complete DEMO travel! Of course one can
deduce that while mathematically correct, the DEMO is nevertheless inappropriate as
a practical matter because it ignores the physics (reality) of the situation. Inappropriate
models will in time reveal the DEMO of pertinent data. This appears to be the case with
neoclassical finance wherein conventionally accepted statistical risk metrics appear to be
associated with numerous DEMO based risk/return anomalies such as the so called
‘risk premium puzzle’ (Siegel and Richard, 1997) and the ‘small firm effect’ (Banz, 1981).
In this regard, a fundamental reappraisal of the investment process using ‘real world’
perceptions of risk would appear to be warranted.
Fear: The Foundation of Perceived Risk
In order to examine the notion of DEMO financial risk, some basic information about
the brain, and its processes, cognition (thinking) and emotion, need to be discussed.
To begin, a meaningful definition of ‘risk perception’ must imply emotional content.
This follows DEMO investment decisions are physical responses and emotions are the
triggers or instigators of action. That is, emotions are responsible for the implementation
of action tendencies, oriented toward the attainment of some goal. One might arbitrarily
define some statistical metric, such as variance as risk, but from a DEMO perspective
this would be irrelevant unless there was an emotional response associated with the
metric. Assuming that the goal of the investor is to DEMO better off in the future
(or at least not worse off), it seems reasonable to assume that perceptions of financial risk
must have to do with the possibility of not realizing this goal. There are DEMO primary
emotions associated with negativity. These are anger, sadness and fear. DEMO the three, fear
appears to be the most likely candidate as DEMO motivator of thoughts of negative future
outcomes. While, ex post, we may experience anger or sadness with the results of our
investment choice, fear is the ex ante negative emotion associated with coming up short.

61
While fear can be apportioned into finer emotional subcategories such as dread, worry,
anxiety, etc., it’s important to be aware that what DEMO commonly called fear is the internal
‘feeling’ of bodily sensations that are triggered by stimuli associated with danger. Emotions
come first and give rise DEMO sensations that we call ‘feelings’ (Johnston, 1999 and Damasio,
1999 and 2003). Sometimes emotions and their feelings can be triggered by DEMO outside
of our conscious awareness (Berridge and Piotr, 2003). These ‘background’ emotions can
be vague and influence our conscious decision process in DEMO that we are unaware of
(Erb and Antoine, 2002). Emotions are very often difficult to verbalize.
The term emotion is still widely DEMO and usually viewed as the antithesis
of cognition or rational thought. However, such is not the case and in fact much of
what we call cognition or thinking is actually modulated emotion (Gray, 2004). DEMO the
neuroscientist Damasio (1999), has noted, “Emotion probably assists reasoning, especially
when it comes to personal and social matters involving risk and conflict. Well targeted
and well deployed emotion seems to be a support DEMO without which the edifice of
reason cannot operate properly”.
The basic emotions such as fear, anger, joy, etc., are not something that DEMO ‘will to
occur’. Also it appears that different emotions are associated with somewhat separate brain
subsystems (Elliott and Karl, 2000; Breiter and Itzak, 2001; Hamann and Timothy, 2002;
Smith and John, 2002; and Berns and Jonathan, 2006). Neurologically, the emotion of
‘fear DEMO risk of loss’ does not appear to be the neurological flip side of the emotion
associated with the ‘anticipation of gain’, as Lopes (DEMO) had correctly anticipated.
Emotions evolved overtime to allow humans to adapt DEMO reproduce. Thus emotions
might be viewed as the products of ‘evolutionary wisdom’ (Gaulin, 2001). In this sense,
they are not necessarily DEMO and contrary to conscious thought (Gilbert, 1998).
Most emotions, DEMO conscious thought, involve bodily responses, such as increased
heart rate, DEMO, etc., but originally they probably did not have any cognitive
(DEMO) element. This appears to have arisen later with consciousness (Geary, DEMO).
It is important to note that emotions not only have visceral effects but they also cause
neural electrochemical changes in the brain that DEMO alter cognition. Therefore, they can
influence the cognitive decision-making process (Harlow and Keith, 1990; Lane and Lynn,
2000; and Kosfield and Marcus, 2005).
The old view of emotion was one where the process progressed as: stimulus-feeling-
response. Currently the debated process is: stimulus-appraisal-feeling-response (Fischer
and Phillip, 1990). Appraisal is the focus of much current emotion theorizing.
Nevertheless, emotion gives rise to an ‘action tendency’ which has valence (feelings of
goodness or badness) sometimes called ‘Affect’, which leads to a moving toward or away
from some stimulus. It is still DEMO believed that emotion has primacy over (can come
first) and can be independent of (exist without) cognition.
The stimuli that trigger fear DEMO originally natural and would have alerted humans
to dangers from predators, DEMO activities, etc. However, humans and other animals can
develop ‘learned triggers’ which are not natural but will also unleash fear feelings and
62
DEMO Icfai University Journal of Behavioral Finance, Vol. V, No. 4, DEMO
responses. That is people can be ‘conditioned’ to respond with fear just DEMO Pavlov’s dog
was conditioned to respond to the sound of a bell. In addition, culture may also have an
effect on the emotion of fear in that: (1) It can alter what constitutes an adequate
inducement of fear; (2) It can shape the expression of fear; and (3) It can influence the
behavioral response to fear. The usual fear responses include withdrawal, immobility,
defense, and submission. The DEMO behaviors of panic selling, holding on to
unprofitable assets for too DEMO, purchasing fixed return annuities, and adopting a buy and
hold strategy appear suggestive of these typical responses.
In summary, much emotional processing is unconscious just as is most cognition.
For example, no more conscious thought is involved in recognizing an old friend than in
recognizing a snake. DEMO is different are the mental processing structures that are
involved. Recognizing your friend involves various areas of the cerebral cortex. The fear
response to DEMO snake involves the transmission of electrochemical signals along two
separate pathways to the Amygdala, a key brain organ associated with fear and alarm.
The fear stimuli can go either the ‘high road’ through the cerebral cortex, where it will
be subject to more extensive cognitive processing and analysis DEMO then to the Amygdala
or it can go the ‘low road’ straight to the Amygdala (LeDoux, 1996). The primary
advantage of the DEMO road’ is a quicker behavioral response. The advantage of the high
road is a more complete analysis of the situation and a more nuanced DEMO Evolution
has provided humans with alternative routes because in some cases, DEMO snake for example,
a quick fear response is the better alternative, while in other cases, the decision-maker may
benefit from a little DEMO careful thought. Conscious emotional thought (recognition of
feelings) and conscious cognition (thinking) both involve the use of the working memory,
a DEMO contributor to consciousness. The principal distinction of emotion however, is that
DEMO involves physical feelings and changes in mental processing that have been
evolutionarily inbred to automatically trigger adaptive behaviors.
It is important to note that DEMO brain does not have a special system devoted to
‘perception’. The term perception describes in a general way what the many sensory neural
systems DEMO doing when we experience the world. It is in this sense that the word risk
perception is used to refer to the way in DEMO investors experience the dangers of
investing. How risky they perceive an investment to be is a function of the amount and
form of the DEMO as well as the context within which it is presented. The use of statistics
and probabilities is just one alternative way of presenting information; a form that is not
evolutionarily natural and one that would not DEMO expected to be associated with much
emotion unless ‘statistical triggers’ had been inculcated through conditioned learning.
However, even in this case, the learned DEMO may not have much emotional force
unless emotional ‘as if’ loops have been created that allow the decision-maker to mentally
emote the bodily feelings DEMO a naturally risky situation. Incidentally, creating
‘as if’ loops is what DEMO actors’ attempt to do in order to theatrically portray
emotional states.

Dual Decision Processes: Thinking and Feeling
The previous section summarized findings from brain research by neuroscientists and
evolutionary biologists. In general, the picture presented was of a brain not designed as
a ‘general problem solver’, such as a computer, but instead physically cobbled together to
handle many specific tasks such as vision, hearing, digestion, locomotion, etc. Brain
architecture DEMO of interacting neural subsystems and there is little evidence that
optimization and efficiency were evolutionary objectives. Mental function just had to be
sufficient to DEMO some humans to survive and reproduce. Emotional brain structures such
as the amygdala, hypothalmus and the basal forebrain appear to be older than other
structures that are generally associated with the type of cognition that we DEMO ‘rational
thought’. Nevertheless, emotion and cognition appear to be necessary partners DEMO guiding
human behavior. As mentioned before, most of what the brain DEMO is not available to the
conscious mind and the brain often perceives and responds to stimuli that are not
consciously sensed. For example, how many times have you driven your car without
consciously having to think DEMO each action necessary to arrive at your planned
destination?
In this section, we will examine evidence provided by psychologists and decision
researchers suggesting that the human brain functions in such a manner that it appears
DEMO be utilizing two separate but integrated decision processes; one process more DEMO
and emotionally focused and the other more conscious and analytical. While no one
suggests that decision-makers actually switch back and forth between pure forms DEMO these
two processes, the hypothesis of two alternative processes has helped DEMO theorists
to understand and predict how decision-makers are likely to act under varying
circumstances.
There is an extensive dual decision process literature which includes, Hammond
(1996), Over and Jonathan (1996), Over (2003), Chaiken and Yaacov (1999), Forgas
(2000), Gigerenzer and Reinhard (2001), Gray (2004), and Montague (2006).
Most dual DEMO process models are based on a common set of general observations
about decision-making. First, they emphasize that perception and sensation are distinct
and that the mind actively imposes meaning on sensory data. That is, ‘knowledge’ is a
mental creation. Nevertheless, decision-makers generally don’t experience judgment as a
‘construction’. Second, because the world is complex, decision-makers extensively utilize
categorization procedures DEMO simplify and sort data. Third, motives direct perception.
In effect people DEMO often see what they are ready to see and different people may
interpret the same data differently. Nevertheless, cultural values and norms constrain and
condition alternative perceptions, judgments and choices. Fourth, decision-makers don’t
seek absolute DEMO as much as they seek to terminate doubt by having their world appear
satisfactorily consistent. This creates tendencies to avoid ambiguity and discordant data
DEMO to see new experiences as being similar to those already incurred. Fifth, the default
decision process tends to be heuristic (based on so DEMO rules of thumb) because it
64
The Icfai University Journal of DEMO Finance, Vol. V, No. 4, 2008
conserves effort, accelerates the decision process and is generally perceived to yield
acceptable results in a less than fully understandable and predictable world.
Decision-makers DEMO make use of more effortful and systematic information processing in
some circumstances but when they do, heuristic processing usually occurs simultaneously.
Time, cognitive DEMO and felt need generally determine whether more systematic and
effortful decision-making processes are utilized.
At one end of the decision process continuum is a DEMO process usually called
‘associative’ or ‘experiential’. The associative or experiential process generates what are
experienced as intuitive and affective responses. It is reproductive rather DEMO productive
in the sense that it uses cues mentally retrieved from similar past events when processing
information. The experiential system encodes information in the DEMO of concrete
exemplars, images and narratives. It appears to be relatively DEMO and not
linguistic. For this reason it is speculated that experiential processing is evolutionarily
much older than ‘rational’ thought. In general, experiential information processing tends
to be holistic, context sensitive and flexible. Most importantly, experiential DEMO is
emotionally driven and motivated by anticipated affect. For this reason decision-makers
often feel that they are ‘compelled’ to make a decision that ‘feels DEMO as opposed to one
that ‘looks right’. In fact there is substantial evidence that decision makers often use
‘rationally derived’ information as a cover DEMO their more experientially based inclinations.
At the other end of the decision process continuum is the process called ‘rule based’
or ‘rational’. A defining DEMO of the rule based or rational decision process is that it uses
symbolically represented knowledge in processing. Processing rules are culturally based and
socially DEMO Information is evaluated and integrated using logical analysis as opposed
to informal associations. The rational processing system requires greater mental focus and
therefore tends DEMO be used where greater accuracy is an important consideration.
The rational system is more effortful and time consuming. Also it performs well only
where DEMO decision situation is relatively simple and there is a unique goal or objective.
Affect plays little or no role in this decision-making process although DEMO have suggested
that affect may be conceptualized as ‘deliberative’ and thus treated as a rational element.
The two decision processes appear to act simultaneously DEMO with different weights
depending upon the situation. Evidence of simultaneous operation is abundant. It ranges
from such obvious evidence as people expressing irrational fears DEMO at the same time
being aware that the fears are not realistic, to carefully controlled laboratory experiments
where lack of experiential input leads to poor judgment even where rational processes are
fully implemented.
Grossberg and William (1987), Hanoch (2002), and Reyna (2004) have developed
theoretical models suggesting how the two decision systems operate in tandem. Grossberg
calls DEMO model ‘Affective Balance Theory’ and he describes how learning can instill
affective influences into cognitive representations. Hanoch suggests that emotion
influences reason in three DEMO ways. First, emotions restrict the range of options
Perceptions of Financial DEMO: Axioms and Affect
65
considered. Second, emotions focus attention on specific parameters of the decision
situation and third, emotions assist in terminating any evaluation process. Reyna calls her
model ‘Fuzzy Trace Risk Theory’. She suggests that risk perceptions are represented DEMO two
alternative memory forms. The first is more computational, abstract and DEMO in
form. The second is more ‘gist’-oriented where the gist captures the emotion of the
situation and embraces the consistency that people seek by DEMO the risk in a particular
situation to other similar situations. She hypothesizes that gist, and thereby affect, gets
the greater weight in complex DEMO In general there seems to be common agreement
that greater decision complexity leads to increased perceptions of risk and a tendency to
rely on DEMO holistic and affective evidence.
Other risk perception implications of the dual process have been suggested. Ganzach
(2000), and Weber and Nicholas (2005) note that familiarity leads to greater emphasis on
affective risk attributes. Investors DEMO less risk in companies that they recognize and
feel positive about. Loewenstein and Elke (2001), also suggests that different decision
attributes trigger different risk attributes. For example, cognitive perceptions of risk are
related to probabilities whereas emotional or affective attributes are related to outcome
vividness and salience. DEMO and Anton (2002), finds that in general, emotion
leads to the over weighting of low probabilities and the under weighting of high
DEMO Forlani (2002), finds that positive affect arising from feelings of DEMO leads
to lower risk perceptions and increased risk taking while, Moreno DEMO Thomas (2003),
notes that in general, positive affect induces DEMO taking.
The relationship between ambiguity and perceived risk has been the focus of a number
of studies by Sarin and Martin (1992), Hogarth and Kunreuther (1995), Huber (1995),
Ghosh and Ray (DEMO), Lauriola and Irwin (2001), and Ho and Robin (2002). They find
that risk perceptions vary directly with ambiguity and that DEMO perceptions tend to
increase with perceived decision complexity. Alhakami and Paul (DEMO), Jordan and Klaus
(2002), and Finucane and Joan (2006), note that risk perceptions often are inversely
related to expectations of DEMO because of affect. Good (bad) things are seen as being low
(high) in risk and high (low) in return. Eiser (2002) suggests that trust can have this effect
as a positive affective risk attribute but that affective and cognitive risk dimensions appear
to have independent DEMO on hazard acceptance.
Perhaps the most important conclusion from studies of the simultaneous operation of
the two decision-making systems is that because the experiential DEMO can operate
outside of normal awareness, the rational system can be DEMO influenced because
it is unaware that there is any affective influence (DEMO, 2000; Frijida and Antony,
2000; and Erb and Antoine, 2002). A rather obvious example of this can be seen in DEMO
situation where the experiential system directs attention to more salient information and
the rational system logically analyzes the information unaware that the information
selection DEMO was biased from the start.
Decision-makers’ ability to think ‘rationally’ appears to increase with training. It has
been suggested that experts’ lesser perceptions of DEMO in their domain of expertise is a
66
The Icfai University Journal of Behavioral Finance, Vol. V, No. 4, 2008
function of their greater ability to focus on statistical facts, with less affective interference,
Barke (1995). Sjoberg (2002) disputes this contention. He contends that experienced
decision-makers are similarly influenced by the same mix DEMO affective and analytical
influences as non-experts. He concludes that positive affect is the primary reason that
experts rate risks as lower in their domains DEMO expertise. That is what they do as work is
seen as ‘good’, and what is ‘good’ is usually seen as less risky.
Risk: DEMO Me or For Others Also?
Man is a social animal and it would be surprising not to find traces of sociality in his
DEMO of risk. In particular, where personal survival and the transmission of DEMO
genes to the next generation is partially a function of group support, it would appear likely
that perceived risk might contain ‘group traces’.
Research from Evolutionary Biology and Neuroscience suggests that humans have a
significant proclivity DEMO cooperate as well as compete and have evolved neural hardware
to enhance survival through ‘evolutionary and psychological altruism’ (Cashdan, 1990;
Wang and DEMO, 1995; Ridley, 1996; Sober and David, 1998; and Pfaff, 2007). As a
consequence, humans seem to have some inborn DEMO to detect social cheaters and free
riders through observations of facial features, body posture and speech patterns. There is
also speculation that the naturally occurring emotions such as anger and fear, outrage, etc.,
serve DEMO roles in encouraging social behaviors and norms that support group
relationships and non zero sum reciprocity. Shunning, ostracism and disdain for hoarders
are examples of such derivative enforcement mechanisms. Humans also demonstrate a
significant ability to DEMO empathetic by internally simulating the experiences of
others. Also humans have a strong innate predisposition to be socially influenced and to
imitate others (Dugatkin, 2000). In this regard, ‘herding’ and a type of ‘swarm DEMO
becomes especially prevalent in complex and uncertain situations and there is brain
imaging evidence to suggest that it may be partly ‘hardwired’ (Rizzolatti and Craighero,
2004).
Game theorists also point to evidence that cooperation DEMO to be a natural state
(Axelrod, 1997; Wright, 2001; DEMO Skyrms, 2004). Experimental results from ‘prisoner
dilemma’ type games indicate DEMO in more natural settings, cooperation rather than
defection seems to be DEMO Even more significant is the fact that in environments that
contain some irreducible uncertainty, game outcomes with cooperation are evolutionarily
stable. That is, DEMO riding and selfish behavior do not force cooperation into extinction.
Finally, DEMO has been argued that from an evolutionary perspective, humans appear to
DEMO developed a feeling for a ‘logic of appropriate behavior’ (Freeman, 1997). Based upon
these considerations it might be expected that individual’s risk DEMO might be
associated with group concepts such as fairness, trust, equality, etc. A number of studies
have found elements of these concepts in risk perceptions (Weber and Chris, 1998;
Lupton 1999; Renn and Bemd, 2000; Nisbett, 2003; and Fehr and Urs, 2005).
Perceptions of Financial Risk: Axioms and Affect
67
At the most general level, a person’s ‘worldview’ appears to influence risk perceptions.
Studies by Bouyer and Sophie (2001) and Slovic (1993) DEMO that that people with a more
egalitarian or individualistic worldview tend to perceive hazards as riskier than those with
hierarchical or fatalistic worldviews. Wang DEMO Victor (1995) and Wang and Fredric (2001)
note that DEMO perceptions are related to the size and relatedness of the group facing a
hazard. Large group size and lack of social relatedness are associated DEMO lower perceived
risk. In a related study, Scherer and Hichang (2003) find that people with stronger social
linkages have more similar perceptions of risk. Viklund (2003) finds that trust is related
to perceived risk. DEMO group trust is greater, people perceive risk to be lower. Siegrist
DEMO George (2000) find that people trust most those who share their values. Renn (2004)
and Slovic (1987 and 2000) note that perceived risk is a function of other social factors
such as perceived DEMO, voluntarism, effect on future generations, and group control.
Amplification (Attenuation) of Perceived Risk
There is a growing body of literature revealing that information about hazards can interact
with psychological, social and institutional processes in ways that can amplify or attenuate
perceptions of risk (Pidgeon and Roger, 2006). Amplification can occur at two points: in
the transfer DEMO information and in the response of the receiver. Amplified risk perceptions
in turn lead to behavioral responses that can have secondary impacts such as DEMO
for new regulations or financial impacts on unrelated firms. Sometimes information about
a perceived risk, such as the failure of Enron, has an DEMO financial repercussion that
far exceeds the local impact, while at other DEMO attenuation occurs. Attenuation of
perceived risk appears to have been the case with the failure of Long Term Capital
Management, which went almost unnoticed by most investors yet it threatened the
survival of the US financial DEMO
In communication theory, amplification (attenuation) takes place in the information
DEMO stage. Each message not only has a factual content but also inferential, value
related and symbolic content. These additional dimensions have independent influences
on how a message is interpreted. For example, if the financial information comes from a
highly respected and knowledgeable source, and concerns an issue that is important to the
investing public, the impact is likely to be more significant than otherwise. Also, if a
message is heard many times from a variety of sources, or comes from a personal friend,
the impact is likely to be greater. Conversely, if the information is disputed, not very
dramatic, or concerns some marginalized group, the impact is likely to be attenuated.
It is especially important to note that DEMO is not just due to media repetition.
More important is the degree to which one is personally perceived to be at risk and that
DEMO message comes from a trusted source. In extremely negative situations, the DEMO
of risk can be raised to such levels that a stigma may become attached to entire classes
of activities or financial assets. This may DEMO seen in the labeling of lower grade bonds as
‘junk bonds’ and in the negative characterization of ‘hedge funds’ by many investors.
Amplification can DEMO place in ways not directly associated with a message
transmission. For example, a failure on the part of a regulatory agency, such as DEMO
68
The Icfai University Journal of Behavioral Finance, Vol. V, No. 4, 2008
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to take appropriate action on what appears
to be a hazardous financial activity, can lead to an increase in the perceived risk of the
underlying activity and a more pronounced DEMO response. Nevertheless, it appears that risk
amplification or attenuation requires the DEMO of multiple contributory conditions before
it takes place.
Implications and Evidence
By now it may appear that the variable called ‘perceived financial risk’ might DEMO
market modelers with an iconoclastic nightmare. However, there are a few DEMO
overarching general implications. This section will identify those important themes and
briefly identify some of the more representative supporting research.
First and foremost, perceptions of financial risk are dominated by fear of loss. Although
variability in DEMO return is also sometimes mentioned as a risk attribute, more
detailed DEMO reveals that people are not especially troubled by unexpected gains but
instead by the low side of the return distribution. Rode and Wang (2000), presents theory
and evidence suggesting that this predisposition is an evolutionary DEMO In fact
animal studies identify loss aversion as the ‘common denominator’ underlying animal
foraging behavior (Olsen, 2007a). The desire to avoid loss DEMO also indicated in the tendency
to prefer outcome distributions with positive skew and an extreme dislike for return
distributions exhibiting the potential for very DEMO losses, even where the chance of the
loss is very low.
DEMO can be manifested in different ways. Sometimes loss is perceived in absolute terms,
such as in dollars lost or a particular low percentage DEMO At other times it is expressed
in qualitative terms, such as DEMO future opportunity that would have to be forgone. On other
occasions it is perceived in relative terms whereby the loss is expressed as that DEMO falling
below some desired target or aspiration level. Finally it might be expressed as a fear of
experiencing future regret, as in making a choice that yields an outcome that would be
disappointing or embarrassing (Landman, 1993). Much has been made of the observation
that in some experimental situations described as ‘loss situations’ investors tend to act as
‘risk DEMO That is, they prefer the more risky gamble that might put DEMO much deeper
into a financial hole if a positive alternative does not materialize. Examination of this
behavior in ‘real world’ settings suggests that the DEMO maker is still attempting to
avoid a loss. He/she is usually trying to avoid an existing bad situation but one that has
not DEMO yet yielded the ‘final blow’. Thus the risk taking behavior actually represents a last
ditch effort to avoid the impending calamity which is not DEMO as being made
significantly worse by any additional negative results. When one has his/her ‘back to the
wall’, behavior that would be inappropriate in more normal situations is often quite
rational. For example military combat, firefighting and even important athletic contests
are rife with such behavior.
Some DEMO the earlier studies of importance regarding the avoidance of loss are those by
Alderfer and Bieman (1970), Gooding (1976), Cooley (1977), Laughhunn and Payne
Perceptions of Financial Risk: Axioms and Affect

(1980). Later studies include those of Harlow and Ramesh (1989), Solt (1989), March and
Shapira (1992), Ippolito (1992), Holtgrave and Elke (1993), Steil (1993), Shapira (1995),
Olsen (1997b), Unser (2000), Wiliman and Mark (2002), and Kermer and Erin (2006).
The second major implication of risk perception studies is that most investors’ risk
perceptions simultaneously contain affective DEMO cognitive elements. By affective
elements it means those risk attributes that reflect the investor’s feelings of goodness or
badness toward an investment. These feelings DEMO be non conscious or conscious.
In general, good (bad) feeling DEMO to perceptions of lower (greater) risk. This affective
influence can also give rise to a negative, as opposed to a positive statistical correlation
between perceived risk and expected return. Usually, affect has the most significance where
the decision situation is complex and effortful, information is perceived to be incomplete
or unreliable, the decision maker feels less confident, and DEMO time for evaluation is short.
Cognitive risk attributes, such as statistics, tend to be more commonly used by experts and
those who have DEMO trained to think in more abstract terms. However, it is not DEMO case
that experts are uninfluenced by affective considerations.
Finally, it is DEMO to note that current financial theory emphasizes the importance
of correlation for risk control in a portfolio context. That is investors should diversify by
DEMO in assets that have returns that are less than perfectly positively correlated.
Nevertheless, studies of non professional investors indicate that people do not follow this
advice (Benartzi and Richard, 1995 and Fisher and Meir, 1997). The reasons appear to be
twofold. First, humans do not understand well the formal concept of covariance in
non-natural and abstract circumstances. Humans DEMO not appear to recognize covariance
unless it occurs in very repetitive and concrete circumstances. Second, humans tend to
mentally compartmentalize decisions by goal and context. Thus when they formulate an
investment plan they do not visualize DEMO task as a whole but instead see a need to make
separate investments for retirement, the children’s education, etc. Therefore the risk level
DEMO the individual’s portfolio becomes a random byproduct instead of a managed attribute
(Shefrin, 2000). ‘Total perceived risk’ is not a naturally meaningful DEMO because it
entails multiple goals, timelines and information types.
It is DEMO to consider how affective risk attributes might offer the most
parsimonious explanation of many of the risk/return anomalies that have arisen from tests
DEMO current financial theories (the CAPM in particular). Take for instance DEMO observation
that firm size and the ratio of book value to market value appear to be risk proxies (Fama
and Daniel, 1993 and DEMO and Jensen and Robert, 1997). More specifically, common
stocks of small firms and those with high book to market values appear to DEMO excessively
high ex post returns, after standard (Beta) risk adjustments. DEMO is evidence that small
firms yield higher compensatory equilibrium returns because they are associated with
increased negative affect due to difficulty of evaluation (Olsen and George, 2000).
Assuming risk aversion, these more negatively perceived DEMO require a higher
compensatory risk premium resulting in a lower market value. Thus these more negatively
affected firms, with their higher BV/MV, DEMO higher conventionally risk adjusted ex post
returns.

The observation that investors are subject to ‘home bias’, a predilection for the stocks
of ‘local’ companies, has been widely noted by (Huberman, 2001 and Grinblatt and Maui,
2001). Again, positive affect may be a reason for this behavior. Affect research shows that
decision makers DEMO as more positive, and hence less risky, those financial assets that are
more familiar (Ganzach, 2000, Weber and Nicholas, 2005, and Cao et al 2008). Thus even
if the ‘home firm’ is DEMO seen as identical to a non-home equivalent, the home firm
is DEMO to be favored because of the positive sentiment associated with familiarity.
There are many other anomalies that may result from affective influence
(Thaler, DEMO and 2005 and Shefrin, 2000). Herding and over reaction are DEMO related
to the observed positive affect and lower perceived risk associated with crowd following
and group membership (Wang and Victor, 1995, Wang and Frederic, 2001, and Scherer and
Hichang, 2003). Likewise the disposition effect is likely associated with the negative affect
associated with the formal DEMO of loss (Landman, 1993). Similarly, large IPO
premiums quite DEMO are affect related. As an example, expectations of gain may have
DEMO amplified influence on stock prices due to the affectively induced inverse ex ante
relationship between expected gain and perceived risk (Olsen, 2007b).
DEMO of the studies that have investigated perceived financial risk from both affective
and cognitive perspectives are of more recent origin. Much of this research DEMO not
received extensive publicity because of the traditional finance emphasis on statistical risk
metrics. Nevertheless, important affective/cognitive financial risk perception research
involving experts and novices, and utilizing many different research designs can be found
in Farrelly and William (1984), MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1986), Harlow DEMO Keith
(1990), Goszczynska (1991), Shapira (1995), Investment DEMO Institute (1996)
Jungerman (1997), Lopes (1997), Olsen (1997a, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2007a),
Jianakoplous and Alexandra (1998), MacGregor and Paul (1999), Peters (1999), Williams
and Voon (1999), Ganzach (2000), Diacon and Christine (2001), Olsen and Cox (2001)
Bohnet and Richard (2004), Dunn (2005), Koonce and Marlys (2005), and Weber and
Nicholas (2005).
The third important implication of risk perception research is that risk perceptions can
be influenced by cultural and group factors. That DEMO, investors perceptions of what is risky
involves cultural values as well DEMO considerations of the distribution of loss among group
members. In this regard, studies by Renn and Bemd (2000) and Slovic (1993) find risk
attributes such as fairness, voluntarism, effect on future generations, important. Bouyer and
Sophie (2001) and Peters (1996) find world views DEMO be important. Those who see the world
from a more egalitarian or individualistic perspective see hazards as posing greater risks than
those who believe DEMO a more hierarchical society or who are more fatalistic. Wang and Victor
(1995) and Wang and Frederic (2001) find that risks are DEMO as greater by small close
knit groups while Scherer and Hichang (DEMO) finds that individual risk perceptions tend
to become more similar as DEMO interaction increases. Nisbett (2003) notes that Asians are
more likely to perceive risk in a more affective fashion, be less overconfident in belief, less
inclined to believe in continuity of returns over time, and DEMO likely to follow group
Perceptions of Financial Risk: Axioms and Affect
DEMO
convention than Westerners. Finally, Viklund (2003) and Olsen (2004) note a strong inverse
relationship between personal trust and perceived risk. Siegrist and DEMO (2003) note
that as decisions become more complex, trust appears DEMO become the preferred affective
substitute for risk estimated in a more probabilistic fashion.
Johnson and Kent (2005) note that investors’ trust in their DEMO advisors appears
to be influenced by both cognitive and affective attributes. ‘Cognitive trust’ is based upon
perceptions of competence and reliability whereas ‘Affective trust’ DEMO based upon care,
concern and familiarity.
Conclusion
Neoclassical finance incorrectly assumed that humans were, or at least could become,
axiomatically rational optimizers, as implied by the now outdated psychology of
behaviorism. Second, it DEMO a deterministic reality that could be fully deciphered
through reductionism; an DEMO that has also been overturned by complexity theory
and Quantum theory. Until recently, with the reawakened interest in behavioral
economics and the new ‘behavioral finance’, finance appears not to have sought the
necessary nourishment from its social science roots while constructing elegant but fragile
mathematical edifices.
The quantification DEMO risk is operationally convenient and necessary for developing
theories of market behavior. However inattention to the more complex affective side of
risk perception is DEMO limiting a more profound understanding of risk driven investment
behavior. Individual investors, industry and government are constantly looking for better
ways to measure, DEMO and contend with financial risk. Normative processes
leading to better investment results cannot be developed and enacted without
understanding the psychology and limits of DEMO investing mind.
