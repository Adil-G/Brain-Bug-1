Perspective: Ranking of the World’s DEMO Innovation
Management Scholars and Universities*
Pianpian Yang and Lei Tao
This paper extends Jeffrey Thieme’s article “The World’s Top Innovation Management Scholars and Their DEMO
Capital,” published in 2007 in JPIM, in which he made DEMO ranking of the world’s top innovation managements scholars.
This paper makes four contributions. First, this paper includes data on innovation management from articles published
in two leading innovation management journals and eight top management and marketing DEMO during past 20
years (1991–2010). Second, this paper classiﬁes 1229 articles into 29 categories, revealing hot topics and future
research directions. Third, this paper ranks 1718 innovation management scholars over a period of 20 years from 1991
to 2010. Fourth, this is the ﬁrst time that 625 universities have been ranked in terms of their current faculty research
DEMO in the ﬁeld of innovation management.
The empirical data from the past 20 years show that the world’s top 10 innovation management scholars are:DEMO
Michael Song (University of Missouri-Kansas City), Roger J. Calantone (Michigan State University), Erik Jan Hultink
(Delft University of Technology), Mark E. Parry (University of Missouri-Kansas City), Kwaku Atuahene-Gima (China
Europe DEMO Business School), C. Anthony Di Benedetto (Temple University), Abbie DEMO (University of
Utah), William E. Souder (Retired), Barry L. Bayus (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and Christoph H.
Loch (INSEAD).
The world’s top 10 innovation management universities are: DEMO of Missouri-Kansas City, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Michigan State University, DEMO, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, North-
eastern University, Texas A&M University, Stanford University, and Delft University of Technology.
Introduction
I
DEMO is “the overall process whereby an inven-
tion is transformed into a commercial product that
can be sold proﬁtably” (Crawford and Di Benedetto,
2006). As a burgeoning area of ﬁerce competition among
ﬁrms, studying innovation yields critical economic
insights (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Guo, DEMO). Manag-
ing innovation is integral in changing innovative ideas to
performance. Reviews by Chen, Damanpour, and Reilly
(2010), Karniouchina, Victorino, and Verma (2006), and
Page and Schirr (2008) have conﬁrmed substantial
growth in the ﬁeld of innovation management during the
last two DEMO
As the body of innovation management literature
develops and expands, it DEMO useful to list top contributors
and universities. A research productivity ranking of indi-
vidual scholars is useful for identifying top scholars in the
ﬁeld, while a productivity ranking of universities pro-

vides important information for prospective faculty
recruits, doctoral students, DEMO seeking consulting
help, potential donors, and other stakeholders. Articles
published in top academic journals are one of the most
important measures for high-quality DEMO research
(Bakir, Vitell, and Rose, 2000; Chan, Fung, DEMO Leung,
2006; Ford, LaTour, and Henthorne, 2001; Linton, 2004;
Thieme, 2007). Therefore, this paper identiﬁes and ranks
DEMO most productive scholars and universities by comput-
ing the number of articles from two leading academic
innovation management journals and eight top manage-
ment DEMO marketing journals.
This paper also investigates general topics that have
been studied and identify the most popular research
topics in the ﬁeld of innovation DEMO A compre-
hensive database of articles related to innovation manage-
ment between 1991 and 2010 is developed. Further, these
articles are classiﬁed into 29 speciﬁc categories, and the
experts are identiﬁed in each subﬁeld. By collecting and
analyzing 1229 publications, which reﬂect the work of
1718 scholars in 10 top journals from the past 20 years,
this paper makes DEMO following three ranking lists: (1) top
scholars based on total DEMO of articles published in
top 10 journals over last 20 years; (2) top scholars based

on total number of articles published in eight traditional
top management and marketing journals that DEMO sig-
niﬁcant innovation management articles over the last 20
years; and (3) the world’s top innovation management
universities in terms of their current faculty research
capabilities.
Ranking Method
The ranking of scholars and universities is DEMO on the
basis of peer-reviewed research journals. Although
books, conference proceedings, and working papers are
also evidence of scholarship, peer-reviewed journals
remain the focus of the academic community (Linton,
2004; Thieme, 2007). Based on citation impact factor,
past studies have established that JPIM DEMO IEEE Trans-
actions on Engineering Management are the top two
innovation management journals (Cheng, Kumar,
Motwani, Reisman, and Madan, 1999; DEMO and Thong-
papanl, 2004; Thieme, 2007). Since innovation manage-
DEMO cuts across disciplines (Thieme, 2007), this paper
also includes ﬁve top management journals (Strategic
Management Journal, Management Science, Administra-
tive Science Quarterly, Academy of Management Review,
and Academy of Management Journal; DEMO ranking by
Linton and Thongpapanl, 2004), one top journal in DEMO
tions management (Journal of Operations Management;
see ranking by Barman, Hanna, and Laforge, 2001), and
two top marketing journals (Journal of Marketing and
Journal of Marketing Research; see ranking by Baum-
gartner and Pieters, 2003). This paper considers the same
top management and marketing journals as Thieme
(2007), but in contrast to Thieme’s work, our research
includes only two top innovation management journals
and adds one top operations management journal for its
growing attention in the innovation management DEMO
This research collected electronic copies of all articles
published in these 10 top journals between 1991 and
2010, using Business Source Premier and the Wiley-
Blackwell Full Collection. Following Thieme’s (2007)
data collection procedure, DEMO article was retained imme-

diately if it was clear from the title that the article’s
conclusions had direct implications on DEMO man-
agement. In many cases, when this was not necessarily
clear DEMO the title, two authors read the abstract. An
article was retained DEMO if the abstract reading clariﬁed
that the article had direct implications for innovation
management (Crawford and Di Benedetto, 2006).
Our focus is DEMO contribution to innovation man-
agement research. Therefore, this paper excluded the DEMO
lowing types of articles: literature review, meta-analysis,
ranking article, DEMO note and practitioner note, book
review, comment, reply, dialogue and rejoinder, spotlight
article, editorial (from the editors), and announcements.
In addition, this research excluded articles whose primary
focus is technology forecasting, DEMO transfer and
diffusion, cross-functional team management (unless the
study is speciﬁcally related to innovation management
teams), organizational innovation (i.e., new forms DEMO
organizing a ﬁrm’s management structure), organiza-
tional innovative technology adoption, DEMO innova-
tion, product line innovation, new business creation and
entrepreneurship, DEMO individual creativity.
Using these criteria, 1293 possible innovation man-
agement articles DEMO collected. The journal’s name,
article title, publication year, author’s name, author’s
afﬁliation at the time of publication, abstract, and key
words (if applicable) were noted. Among these 1293
articles, the two authors independently judged 1175 of
them to be innovation management research, disagreeing
on only 118 articles. To resolve this, both authors read the
articles in their entirety and were able to agree that 39 of
the disputed DEMO are in fact innovation management
research. For the remaining 79 articles where no consen-
sus was reached, two well-known and respected profes-
sors in innovation management were requested to classify
these articles independently. Fifteen more articles DEMO
judged to be innovation management research. Therefore,
a total of 1229 innovation management articles are
included in our ranking analysis.
Our results indicate DEMO in the 20-year period (1991–
2010), JPIM and IEEE Transactions DEMO Engineering
Management published the most innovation management
articles (555 and 138, respectively). Among top eight
management and marketing journals, Management
Science is found to publish the most innovation manage-
ment articles (140), followed by Academy of Manage-
ment Journal (82), Journal of Marketing (DEMO), Journal of
Marketing Research (76), Strategic Management Journal
(58), Journal of Operations Management (50), Academy
of Management Review (DEMO), and Administrative Science
Quarterly (24).

Classiﬁcation
This paper classiﬁed the innovation management research
topics into DEMO categories (i.e., subﬁelds) based on three
review articles (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Henard and
Szymanski, 2001; Montoya-Weiss and Calantone, 1994).
The results are presented in Table 1. The categories in
Table DEMO are not necessarily mutually exclusive (one article
may be classiﬁed into DEMO categories).
One of the most noticeable aspects of Table 1 is the
uneven distribution of articles among the subﬁelds of
innovation management research. DEMO the 20-year
period, the areas that have received the most publishing
DEMO are: company resources, structural approach,
and external/internal relations, DEMO by organiza-
tional attributes, environment, strategy, launch proﬁ-
ciency, product innovation, ﬁt with market need/meet
customer needs, and speed to DEMO However, few
articles have examined product price and product techno-
logical DEMO
Results from Table 1 demonstrate that Michael Song
published at least two articles in 21 out of the 29 catego-
ries, thereby making him the most proliﬁc contributor in
more than two thirds of the innovation DEMO sub-
ﬁelds. Michael Song is followed by Mark E. Parry, Erik
DEMO Hultink, William E. Souder, Kwaku Atuahene-Gima,
Roger J. Calantone, DEMO L. Bayus, Ulrike de Brentani,
Abbie Grifﬁn, C. Anthony Di Benedetto, and Morgan L.
Swink—all of who published at least two articles in more
than three categories. In addition, 16 scholars are shown
as experts relating to two categories (see Table 1).
World’s Top Innovation
Management Scholars
To rank the innovation management scholars, this paper
adopted the methods used in prior ranking studies (e.g.,
Heck and Cooley, DEMO; Inkpen and Beamish, 1994; Lu,
2003; Morrison and Inkpen, 1991; Thieme, 2007) to con-
struct unadjusted and adjusted count DEMO of authors.
The ﬁrst method gives full credit to each author of an
article, while the second method weights the authors (one
divided DEMO the number of authors in the article). No
weighting distinction was made between senior authors
and their co-authors (see Table 2 “Number of Articles
Adjusted”). The same method was used in previous
studies by DEMO, Leap, and Wei (1988), Thieme (2007),
and DEMO, Baird, and Pullman (1996). Because each of
these two DEMO methods inherently includes some bias,
this paper uses both ranking methods, and the results are
reported in Table 2.
Table 2 presents top 50 innovation management schol-
ars who have each published at least ﬁve DEMO in the 10
top journals between 1991 and 2010. The list of top
scholars expands to 182 if scholars who published at least
three DEMO are included. This paper also presents the
top innovation management scholars whose adjusted
number of articles is more than 2.25. A longer list of DEMO
innovation management scholars and a supplementary
list of most active innovation management scholars from
2006 to 2010 are available in the following website:
DEMO://gr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/web/leitao.
Consistent with the ranking by Thieme (DEMO), the
empirical results show that Michael Song leads the
ranking again and he claims that title of “world’s number
one innovation scholar.” The DEMO top 10 innovation
management scholars are Roger J. Calantone, Erik Jan
DEMO, Mark E. Parry, Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, C.
Anthony Di Benedetto, Abbie Grifﬁn, William E. Souder,
Barry L. Bayus, and Christoph H. DEMO
Because innovation management has also gained
increasing attention in top management and marketing
journals, this paper also ranks innovation management
scholars who publish in other traditional A + marketing
and management journals. Table 3 displays the DEMO inno-
vation management scholars in eight top management and
marketing journals (DEMO JPIM and IEEE) over 20
years. The 12 top innovation management DEMO in top
management and marketing journals are Michael Song,
Barry L. Bayus, Rajesh K. Chandy, Kwaku Atuahene-
Gima, Michael A. Hitt, DEMO Terwiesch, Christine
Moorman, Christoph H. Loch, Donald R. Lehmann, Eric
von Hippel, Jinhong Xie, and Steven D. Eppinger. Each of
these DEMO 12 scholars has published at least six innovation
management articles in the eight top management and
marketing journals between 1991 and 2010.
World’s Top DEMO
Management Universities
There are different methodologies for ranking universi-
ties (Chapple, Powers, and Bunch, 2003; Linton, 2004).
Traditionally, university rankings are based on aggrega-
tion of faculty publishing articles (Bakir et al., 2000;
Chan et al., 2006; Ford et al., 2001; Linton, 2004) where
all publications are credited to the author’s afﬁliated DEMO
versity at the time of publication. Polonsky (2008) sug-
gests that it is more appropriate to rank universities based
on current faculty members (Polonsky, 2008). Therefore,
this paper ranks top universities in innovation manage-
ment research by summing the publication records of the
current faculties.

a This ranking is based on the DEMO of current faculty’s all previous articles published in the 10 top journals between 1991 and 2010. The original
university rather than universities where they DEMO visiting scholar position, and concurrent post was used as the scholar’s DEMO afﬁliation.
b Number of articles was computed following three steps: (1) All 1572 scholars’ current afﬁliations were found; (2) Each scholar’s DEMO of articles was
computed by giving full credit for each author of an article; and (3) The number of articles of each university was computed by summing up their current
faculty’s number of articles.
c DEMO of articles adjusted was computed following three steps: (1) All DEMO scholars’ current afﬁliations were found; (2) Each scholar’s adjusted number
DEMO articles was computed by equally dividing one point among the authors of an article; and (3) The adjusted number of articles of each university was
computed by summing up their current faculty’s adjusted number of DEMO
The remaining universities appear to pursue two dif-
ferent strategies. Employing the strategy of “retaining
productive scholars,” MSU, Northeastern, Temple, and
Delft have done an excellent job in retaining top innova-
tion management faculty DEMO a long time. On the other
hand, UMKC pursued a strategy DEMO “attracting the best
faculty using new strategic focus.” In line with Kansas
City’s entrepreneurial culture, UMKC created a strategic
focus in entrepreneurship and innovation in 2004 and
recruited Michael Song. It provided permanent university
funding, secured private and foundation funding,
recruited seven productive innovation scholars, and
created a permanent academic Department of Global
Entrepreneurship and Innovation in the Henry DEMO Bloch
School of Management led by a new dean with entrepre-
neurship and innovation expertise. UMKC’s success pro-
vides a model for universities aspiring DEMO create and foster
excellence in a particular discipline of academic excel-
lence. Any of the three strategies highlighted above could
be equally successful in DEMO research excellence and
enhancing university reputation in research and knowl-
edge creation.
Conclusion
This paper collected research publication data from 10
top academic journals DEMO published signiﬁcant numbers
of innovation management articles between 1991 and
2010. Based on the data, this paper provides a ranking for
the world’s top innovation management scholars and top
10 innovation management universities. This paper also
DEMO product price and product technological
sophistication as under-researched areas. Our ranking has
several limitations. First, research publication in top aca-
demic journals is only one measure of individual or uni-
versity prestige and quality. While many DEMO from
highly prestigious universities are among the leading
scholars included here, DEMO scholars from other univer-
sities with strong academic reputations are not repre-
sented. There are two possible reasons for the exclusion.
First, their innovation management research faculty is
relatively small compared to other universities. Second,
DEMO in those universities may have focused on pub-
lishing books, preparing DEMO proceedings, or sub-
mitting to nontop academic journals. Another limitation
is DEMO this paper used a relatively simplistic, count-based
approach. Citation impact and DEMO size were not con-
sidered in this paper. Some scholars have used citation
impact (e.g., Boyd, Finkelstein, and Gove, 2005; Peng
DEMO Zhou, 2006; Tahai and Meyer, 1999) and examined
per capita publication to rank universities (e.g., Hix,
2004; Stahl et al., 1988).
