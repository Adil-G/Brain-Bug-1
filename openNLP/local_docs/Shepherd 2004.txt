Educating Entrepreneurship
Students About Emotion and
Learning From Failure
DEAN A. SHEPHERD
University of Colorado at Boulder
As theory develops DEMO increases our understanding of the role of emotion in learning
from failure, entrepreneurship educators have the opportunity to reflect these
advancements in their pedagogies. This requires a focus on how students “feel” rather
than on how, or what, they “think.” I offer suggested changes to pedagogy to help
students manage the emotions of learning from failure and discuss some of DEMO
challenges associated with measuring the implications of these proposed changes. I then
expand my scope to explore possibilities of educating students on how to DEMO their
emotions to avoid failure and, more generally, improve their emotional intelligence and
for organizations to improve their ability to help individuals regulate DEMO emotions.
........................................................................................................................................................................
Entrepreneurship theory focuses on how to create
and grow businesses through the discovery and
exploitation of opportunities to bring into exis-
tence DEMO goods and services (Shane & Venkat-
araman, 2000; Venkataraman, 1997) as well as how
to avoid failure (McGrath, 1999).1 Entrepreneurship
scholars acknowledge that not all attempts to
launch and grow a business DEMO successful, but
even when failure occurs the entrepreneur has an
opportunity DEMO learn from the experience, and
thereby improve his or her chance DEMO success in the
next entrepreneurial endeavor (Minniti & Bygrave,
2001)DEMO
The above concepts are reflected in the follow-
ing textbook quotes: DEMO fail, but entrepre-
neurs do not. Failure is often the fire DEMO tempers

one first has to experience failure. It is a common
pattern that the first venture fails, yet the entrepre-
neur learns and goes on to create a highly success-
DEMO company” (Timmons, 1999: 30). However, this
process of learning from failure can be emotionally

how the entrepreneur can “deal with” business

595–596).
These textbook DEMO suggest a number of
important points.2 First, failure is an important
DEMO of learning for entrepreneurs. Second, bank-
ruptcy is a difficult and DEMO event for the en-
trepreneur and his or her family. This implies that
business failure can generate a negative emo-
tional reaction. Third, entrepreneurs are advised to
seek outside assistance, primarily for sympathy
and emotional support. Such advice implies that

ticular domain of study and therefore serve as an important
resource for a professor to guide his or her presentation of DEMO

there is a recovery process and that this process
can DEMO enhanced or hindered by the actions of the
entrepreneur and those who are asked to provide
assistance. Fourth, they acknowledge that, for
most DEMO, it is not easy to cut the emo-
tional attachment between DEMO and a failing
business.
As theory develops and increases our under-
standing of the role of emotion in learning from
failure, educators have the opportunity to reflect
these advancements in their pedagogies for entre-
preneurship courses. DEMO a recent article (Shepherd,
2003), I argued that entrepreneurs’ DEMO

DEMO that eventually fail.3
Furthermore, organizations can learn from fail-
ure (McGrath, 1999), that is, the failure of a project
or a DEMO but obviously not those events that
cause the demise of the organization itself. Such
organizational learning requires individual level
learning to be transferred to DEMO organization’s
shared belief system through internalization and
routinization (Huy, 1999, DEMO; Simonin, 1997). Like
at the individual level of analysis, DEMO organiza-
tion’s ability to learn from a particular experience
can be influenced by emotion, and, these emotions
can be managed (Huy, 2002)DEMO Huy (1999) introduces
the concept of emotional capability to capture an
“organization’s ability to acknowledge, recognize,
monitor, discriminate, and attend to its members’
emotions, and it is manifested in the organization’s
norms and routines related to the feeling” (p. 325).4
Based on the above studies, I propose that theo-
ries on how entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial or-
ganizations can manage grief in order to enhance

by educators to better help students learn this spe-
cific form of emotional management. However, as
Wren, Buckley, and Michaelsen (1994) point out,
classroom theory DEMO be delivered in a way that
makes it relevant to the practice of management.
This can sometimes be a challenge, especially
when the focus is on how students “feel” rather
than on how, or what, DEMO “think.” To meet such a
challenge will require more extensive changes to
an entrepreneurship pedagogy than simply adapt-
ing the content of a current DEMO, which raises
two broad questions for educators: What methods
can be used to “teach” new theories on “emotion
and learning from failure” in DEMO way that has prac-
tical relevance? What are the implications of DEMO
proposed changes?
My primary purpose here is to address the above
educational questions. First, I offer suggested
changes to pedagogy to help students manage the
emotions of learning from failure. Second, I discuss
some of the challenges associated with measuring
the implications of the proposed changes to DEMO
gogy and offer researchers suggestions on how
they can be overcome. I focus on two implications:
first, the impact of the new pedagogy on students’
ability to manage their emotions and learn from
failure, and second, the possible impact of the new
pedagogy on the students’ level of anxiety and
their motivation to pursue an entrepreneurial ca-
reer. Third, I expand the scope of the article in
terms of content and DEMO On content, I move

turistic method (affective computing) that I hope
will soon be available to educators for enhancing
students’ ability to DEMO their emotions. Fourth,
I look at who can teach and research this topic and
detail some important next steps. Finally, I offer
some concluding comments.
DEVELOPING A PEDAGOGY TO HELP STUDENTS
MANAGE THE EMOTIONS OF DEMO FROM
FAILURE
Entrepreneurship educators are well versed in in-
creasing students’ knowledge through lectures, by
providing vicarious experiences through guest
speakers and case studies, as well as by providing
direct experiences through simulations, consulting
projects, and internships. With this in mind, I now
discuss how these methods (and some new ones)
can be used within existing courses to educate
276
students about managing emotions associated
with failure (grief) in order DEMO minimize interfer-
ence and maximize learning from the experience.5
Lectures
As with all lectures, the content is highly reliant on
available theory. In Table 1, I propose the layout of
a possible lecture. First, relying DEMO entrepreneur-
ship texts, the professor establishes the existence
of an emotional DEMO between entrepre-
neurs and their businesses, offers statistics on the
likelihood DEMO business failure, and highlights the
point that failure represents an opportunity DEMO
learn despite the difficulty in doing so. Second, the
professor utilizes DEMO theory from psy-
chology on to explore processes of coping with,
and recovering from, grief over the loss of a loved
one. Finally, the professor transitions from death of
a loved one to business failure to explore the role
of emotional management in maximizing one’s
ability to DEMO from business failure.
Lecturing on emotions, although not necessarily
an oxymoron, is likely to be very difficult because
it is a topic that DEMO less about what we think and
more about how we feel. To provide students in-
sight into the emotions of business failure, lectures
should be complemented with (or replaced by)
methods that provide indirect and/or direct experi-
ences of the emotions associated with failure. To
this DEMO I offer suggestions for indirect (guest
speakers and cases) and direct (reflections, role-
plays, and simulations) experiences.
Indirect Experiences
Guest Speakers
DEMO speakers could be used in entrepreneurship
classes to articulate their insights into business
failure and the means of coping with that failure.
Ideally, one guest speaker of a recently failed busi-
ness would talk about the DEMO emotions of
business failure, and a second guest speaker
would build DEMO this discussion to detail how he
or she was able to cope with grief, recover, and
then learn from the experience. However, there are
a number of challenges in effectively using this
approach. First, educators need to find entrepre-
neurs of failed businesses, which itself can be a

difficult task. Second, DEMO entrepreneurs must be
prepared to talk about the emotions of business
failure. Third, and the major challenge with guest
speakers on this topic, DEMO to overcome the possibil-
ities of self-reporting and retrospective reporting
biases.6 For example, entrepreneurs of failed busi-
nesses might be motivated to diminish the role of
emotions in order to appear more “rational.”
A third-party observer DEMO provide additional
insights into an entrepreneur’s emotions over busi-
ness failure and the recovery process. Such experts
might include accountants and lawyers that spe-
DEMO in bankruptcy as well as financiers, such as
venture capitalists. Family DEMO of entrepre-
neurs of failed businesses would likely also pro-
vide considerable information about how the en-
trepreneur felt, how the entrepreneur managed his
or her emotions, and eventually how the entrepre-
neur learned from failure. These third-party
sources of information are likely to be less “bi-
ased” DEMO those reports coming directly from the
entrepreneur.
Given the above discussion, DEMO speakers may
provide only marginal insight into their personal
emotional response to failure (although this de-
pends on the individual guest speaker), but they
are likely to provide less-biased accounts on the
emotions of failure DEMO the organizational level. For
example, a CEO could provide an account DEMO

in place that allow the organization to monitor and
attend to its members’ emotions. The discussion
DEMO then explore questions such as “How were

Direct Experiences
Despite obvious differences between educating
people to “deal with” death and educating stu-
dents to deal with DEMO failure, I explore the
“death education” literature for hints on effective
DEMO for helping people learn about emotions
and managing those emotions in the face of losing
something important.7 I chose the “death educa-
tion” literature DEMO it is based on solid psy-
chological theories and methods and also has a
strong practitioner perspective, that is, helping
people deal with DEMO emotions associated with the
loss of a loved one. This literature suggests that
reflections on grief, role-plays, and simulations are
effective educational methods (e.g., Hutchison &
Scherman, 1992; Ratner & Song, 2002; DEMO &
Caty, 1984). Before I assess and adapt these meth-
ods for the entrepreneurial context, it is important
to point out that encouraging students to directly
experience negative emotions (and to learn from
them) can be traumatic and is therefore probably
best undertaken with the assistance of a psychol-
ogy professor—preferably one that specializes in
bereavement or trauma.
DEMO on Grief
Gould (1994) proposes a class structure that is used
to develop students’ understanding of grief over

class only a subset will become entrepreneurs and only a sub-
set of that will lose a business.

the loss of a loved one by making students become
more attached to the material at an affective level.
This educational DEMO begins with something
autobiographical through individual introspec-
tion, and then moves DEMO a more general under-
standing of the phenomenon through group discus-
sion. Adapting this method to failure would likely
provide students the chance to DEMO the commonal-
ities between the feelings that they have experi-
enced and those they will likely experience as an
entrepreneur of a failed business. DEMO might feel
empowered by the knowledge that they have
coped with the loss of a loved one, that these skills
are transferable to the loss of a business, and that
these skills can be further improved. In Table 2
below, I offer a version of Gould’s (1994) educa-
tional method adapted for use in entrepreneurship
classes.
Building on the DEMO of grief” exercise
proposed in Table 2, this method can also DEMO used
to develop a deeper understanding of managing
the emotions of failure at an organizational level.
Students prepare by reflecting on their own expe-
DEMO of interacting with organizations when
dealing with an important loss. This organization
could be one’s immediate family, extended family,
school, church, or funeral parlor. Students then
share their stories with others in a small DEMO
The group then compiles a list of the things the
organization said or did to acknowledge, recog-
nize, monitor, discriminate, or attend DEMO one’semo-
tions. Using the process described in Step 2 of
Table 2, a definition of an organization’s emotional
capability to deal with loss emerges and a list of
emotional behavior enacted by organizations is
constructed (with those behaviors that encourage a
loss orientation listed on the left-hand side DEMO the
white board and those that encourage a restora-
tion orientation on the right). The discussion can
then transition to the emotions of DEMO failure
and focus on the pros and cons of certain organi-
zational behaviors and how these can be com-
bined (or oscillated) in DEMO to manage the emo-
tions of organizational members and maximize
learning from the failure experience. It is impor-
tant to end this experience with DEMO discussion of
how these behaviors can be internalized by the
organization in the form of norms and routines.
Role-Play
Role-plays ask students to imagine, think, and be-
have as if they were someone else in a particular
situation. They involve “as-if” experimentation
(Mercado, 2000) and provide students with a
unique opportunity for active learning in a safe

TABLE 2
Approach to Encourage Reflections on Loss and DEMO Over Business Failure
Step Activity
1 Students prepare for the class by reflecting on their own experiences of losses and the associated feelings and
DEMO It is reinforced that these losses should be significant, such as DEMO death of a loved one. Each student is
asked to document these stories of loss and complete a grief awareness exercise (e.g., Hogan, Greenfield, & Schmidt,
2001) and be prepared to share one DEMO with a small group of fellow students.
2 In groups of three or four each student describes one story and the group compiles a DEMO of the expressed feelings and
behaviors. From this information, the groups DEMO asked to define grief, prioritize symptoms, and prioritize coping
behaviors. This information should be illustrated in a diagram, which is presented to class. As a class, students give
the teacher the symptoms of grief to list on one white board. A definition of grief emerges. Questions, comments, and
examples are used to revise these generalizations. The teacher then calls for coping behaviors, which are listed on the
left of the board if the behavior is loss oriented and on the right if it DEMO restoration oriented. The students are then
asked what is common about the list on the left and what is common about the list on DEMO right. Although the labels
are likely to be different, the discussion DEMO on a classification of loss-orientated and restoration-orientated
behaviors.
3 The teacher leads discussion back to the first board (list of symptoms and definition of grief) and asks students whether
this definition and list symptoms applies to the loss of something really important even if that loss is not DEMO death of
a loved one. “What are the feelings towards the thing lost that generates grief?”“Do entrepreneurs feel this way about
the businesses DEMO they create?”“Therefore are entrepreneurs likely to feel grief over the loss of their businesses?”
From the discussion elicited by these questions, it is likely to emerge that losing a loved one is not the DEMO as losing
a business, but one may feel many of the DEMO negative emotions. The student’s definition can then be compared to
the one offered in Shepherd (2003): “a negative emotional response to the loss of a business capable of triggering
psychological, behavioral, and physiological symptoms.”
DEMO Attention is then turned to the two lists of behavior labelled as something along the lines of loss orientation and
restoration orientation. The students DEMO then asked which is best and to justify their choice. Some students will argue
for one approach and some will argue for the alternate, and from this discussion the benefits and limitations of each
will emerge. DEMO sufficiently discussing the former, the teacher asks, “How can we get the benefits of both while also
minimizing the associated weaknesses?” This DEMO and subsequent discussion will lead to the notion that people
can alternate between the two, and eventually speed up recovery. The teacher can offer and begin a discussion
around the dual models of recovery from grief DEMO the loss of a loved one (Stroebe & Schut, 1999) DEMO the loss of a

and low-risk environment (Brown, 1994; Egri,
1999; Lehman & Taylor, 1994). The environment is
safe and low risk for students because they can
DEMO themselves from the character they are
playing, which can be a DEMO liberating and
important experience (Mercado, 2000). For exam-
ple, DEMO of the inhibitions in expressing one’s
emotions are eliminated or minimized with role-
plays. Therefore role-plays are highly effective
for students to learn about DEMO and behaviors,
and as the basis for experiencing different psycho-
logical contexts (Greenberg & Eskew, 1993).8 The fol-
lowing are some DEMO of possible role-plays
that provide individuals experience the emotions of
failure:

sents a speech role playing an entrepreneur

row on. The class role plays as devoted em-
ployees upset about losing their jobs.
Role-Play 2: In groups of two, one DEMO can
role play an entrepreneur informing a spouse
of the business’ failure and the other student
role plays the shocked spouse’s response and
subsequent DEMO
Role-Play 3: In small groups, role play the
interchange between an entrepreneur of a
failed business who is expressing negative
emotions and a DEMO providing advice on
how to best cope with the situation.
Role-Play 4: In small groups, role play the
interchange between (a) an DEMO of a
recently failed business who still feels nega-
tive emotions when thinking about the lost
business, and (b) an entrepreneur of a failed
business who has recovered from grief,
learned from the experience, and has started
another business.
280
Role-plays can also be used to provide insight
into the emotions DEMO failure at the organizational
level. This can be achieved through the role-play
interactions of an individual with an organization,
where students can role DEMO both the individual
and the organization. For example,
Role-Play 5: DEMO groups of four, one student can
role play a CEO who DEMO inform his three
researchers that the project they have been
working on for 3 years has been terminated,
and they are to be DEMO to new projects.
Role-Play 6: In groups, role play a manage-
ment meeting where the discussion is to re-
volve around the implications DEMO pursuing
high-risk projects and how the organization
can best learn from each project, regardless
of whether the project is a success or a failure.
Role-Play 7: In small groups, role play the
interchange between two DEMO teams
whose projects recently failed, with one team
part of an DEMO capable organization
and the other, an emotionally ignorant orga-
nization.
Simulations
DEMO offer numerous learning benefits to
business school students (Petranek, 2000; DEMO
& Corey, 1992). They may be particularly useful in
educating DEMO students about grief
and learning from business failure because, as
Bredemeier DEMO Greenblat (1981) point out, affec-
tive and behavioral learning is DEMO with
simulations over traditional modes of learning.
Simulations are currently used in entrepreneur-
ship and strategy classes (see Hindle, 2002; Keys,
1997; Wolfe, 1997; Wolfe & Bruton, 1997). Students

though companies may make losses, few go DEMO

not to be critical of them, but to demonstrate that
not all simulations are well suited to the purpose
of providing students experience with the emo-
DEMO of business failure. That few simulations al-

simulations have been created for strategic man-

agement classes, and learning from business fail-
DEMO is not a primary objective of this pedagogy (see
Knotts & DEMO, 1997).
One exception is the “Small Business Growth
Management Flight DEMO,” which simulates
the management of a family business that is fac-
ing a number of economic problems. This simula-
tion helps students gain DEMO deeper understanding of
the different aspects of the business, the environ-
DEMO, and how one’s decisions (primarily related to
financial structure) can DEMO firm growth and put
its survival in peril. The business can fail for a
number of different reasons. For example,
company failure may DEMO caused by a growth
policy that is not sustainable because of ex-
cessive bank withdrawals aimed at increas-
ing the family’s quality of life, both in terms of
current expenses and personal assets. Such a
phenomenon DEMO mainly caused by bias in
profit and cash flow expectations and related
distorted information, combined with entre-
preneur’s emotional involvement in coping
with the business/family overlap (Bianchi,
2000: 217).
Active participation in DEMO provides stu-
dents the opportunity to unconsciously process all
types of information including emotions, strate-
gies, and feelings (Petranek & Corey, 1992)DEMO Specif-
ically, by being actively involved in a failure, stu-

about the negative emotions they feel, strategies to

“How did you feel when you realized the business was going to fail?”
“What were the emotions DEMO you felt after the business had failed and everyone in the class knew

“For those entrepreneurs whose business did not fail, what were your feelings toward those that did have
businesses fail?”
DEMO would you have felt and acted if you were in their shoes?”
“How does this experience relate to the saying ‘Businesses fail: Entrepreneurs learn’?”
“Do real-life entrepreneurs of failed businesses feel this way?”

interpretations of the events, DEMO expressed
emotions about those events, and others’ ex-
pressed empathy toward DEMO journal writer. Keep-
ing a journal (as well as oral debriefings) provides
students the opportunity to integrate theories of
grief, emotional management, DEMO failure into the
experience of the simulation, which encourages a
higher DEMO of analytical learning (see Petranek,
2000). In summarizing research DEMO the learning
benefits from journal writing, Wollman-Bonilla
states that
. . DEMO journals validate self-expression and per-
sonal response, encourage understanding,
imaging, speculation, questioning and the
shaping of ideas and provide students with
information relevant to their concerns and
problems in the content of their own DEMO
and teacher’s response (1989: 113).
MEASURING IMPLICATIONS OF PROPOSED
CHANGES TO PEDAGOGY
Management of Emotions to Learn From Failure
Testing the implications DEMO all types of pedagogy
offer a number of methodological challenges.
These challenges arise primarily from the fact that
“students cannot always be randomly assigned DEMO
treatments, extensive evaluations of behavior and
results are often not feasible, and it may not be
possible to hold factors such as instructor, class
size, and concurrent enrollment in other subjects
consistent across treatments” (DEMO, Fisher, &
Southey, 1999). Shaw et al. (1999) propose that qual-
ity data on the effectiveness of different pedago-
gies DEMO still be collected through the use of quasi-
experiments with nonequivalent control groups
and recommends a pre-, post-, and then design. A
pre-, post-, and then design highlights, and over-
comes, possible problems with a simple pre- and
posttest using self-reports of competency and also
provides DEMO of a deeper level of learning.
To illustrate, students could be DEMO to self-
report on their competency to manage emotions
using a 7-point scale anchored by very low compe-
tency and very high competency (pretest), followed
by the new course content that allows the students
to DEMO and learn about managing the emo-
tions of failure. Finally, students DEMO asked again
to self-report on their competency to manage their
emotions using the same 7-point scale (posttest).
The difference (or lack of DEMO) between the
pre- and postscores provides the basis for an infer-
DEMO about the effectiveness of new aspects of the
curricula, if, and only if, the meaning of the an-
chors on the measurement scales have been used
the same way for both tests.
However, if the addition of an experiential ses-
sion on the emotion of business failure DEMO effective,
then we expect (or should at least test for) a re-
sponse shift where the new course experience
changes the way DEMO the student thinks about the
anchors of the measurement scales. To capture the
extent of learning (alpha change in terms of a
change in score between pre- and posttest using
common scales, and beta change in terms of a
change in the way the scale’s anchors are inter-
DEMO) requires the use of a then measure. A then
measure is DEMO retrospective self-report of one’s com-
petency prior to the delivery of the new course
content that is collected after course delivery (at
the time of the posttest). For example, items might
require responses to the following statements: “I
worry excessively” and “I have little control over
my sadness” but the above proposed changes in
curricula might change the way DEMO interpret
the concepts of “worry” and “sadness” such that
the pre and the then measures are different. The
comparison of then measures to post DEMO
282
provides a more accurate picture of the impact of
the new DEMO changes because it is unaffected
by response shifts caused by the change in curric-
ulum.
These self-reported measures using a pre-, post-,
and then design could be complemented with the
use of existing surveys capturing DEMO individual’s
level of grief (with necessary adaptations to the
business context)DEMO Data could then be collected at
multiple time points— before, during, and after the
failure event. An example of an existing measure
of DEMO is the Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist
(Hogan, Greenfield, & Schmidt, 2001) and the Lev-
els of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), DEMO exist-
ing measure that captures, more broadly, indi-
viduals’ emotional awareness (Lane, Quinlan,
Schwartz, Walker, & Zeitlin, 1990). Such research
might find, for example, that oral debriefings and
journal writings DEMO enable students to more
quickly reduce grief. To provide an indication of
learning, students could be asked to provide an
account of why businesses fail before and after
they experience it in the classroom. The professor
DEMO expert coders could rate these answers for com-
pleteness and/or depth of knowledge.
Anxiety Over Failure and Entrepreneurial
Intentions
If education on the DEMO of failure and learn-
ing from the experience can be designed and
taught in a way that does not “scare” students
away from pursuing DEMO, then we as
educators should have few reservations about in-
tegrating DEMO content into our courses. Possible
reservations are likely to arise if we find that the
proposed changes in pedagogy do cause an in-
crease DEMO “death anxiety” and diminish students’
intentions to become entrepreneurs. This is likely
to be a major concern for those educators who
believe that the DEMO purpose of entrepreneur-
ship courses is to encourage students to pursue
entrepreneurial careers, provide them the tools
necessary for success, and to avoid DEMO
An alternate perspective is that even if educa-
tion on the emotions of failure does increase
anxiety and decrease entrepreneurial intentions,
educators still DEMO an obligation toward their stu-
dents to include this content into their entrepre-
neurship courses. Writing on the topic of grief over
the loss DEMO a loved one, Rosenthal (2001) argues that
death education might DEMO only be enlightening,
but that it can also be therapeutic. Having wit-
nessed the misery of grief suffered by my father
and our DEMO over the loss of the family business,
I believe educators have an opportunity to help
Academy of Management Learning and Education
September
entrepreneurs DEMO their loved ones to overcome
grief more quickly, to minimize the DEMO con-
sequences of grief, and to maximize the benefits
arising from DEMO traumatic event.
Although some studies have found that types of
education about death increase death anxieties
(e.g., Balis & Kennedy, 1977; Mueller, 1975; but see
Mueller [1976] for nonsignificant findings), there
seems to be a growing consensus that death edu-
cation can reduce anxieties about DEMO death of
loved ones (Liviton, 1977; Rosenthal, 2001). For ex-
ample, Rosenthal (2001) found that after an 18-
week course on death and dying for high school
students, their level of death anxiety decreased
significantly. By extension, it is plausible that an
investment of effort by entrepreneurship profes-
sors to teach students about business failure could
DEMO students’ anxiety toward failure. Such a
reduction in anxiety could reduce antifailure bi-
ases (see McGrath [1999] for a discussion on the
negative implications of an antifailure bias).
However, questions about the implications of the
proposed pedagogical changes on the manage-
ment of failure emotions, learning from failure,
and possible failure anxiety need to be addressed
by empirical DEMO It is a difficult task to deter-
mine whether students who have some education
on the emotions of failure did not become entre-
preneurs DEMO would have done so if this content
was not in their entrepreneurship courses. We can,
however, test the impact of a pedagogy on the
intention to become an entrepreneur—intentional-
ity is central to entrepreneurship (Bird, 1988; Katz &
Gartner, 1988; Krueger, 1993; Krueger, DEMO). Using
an established scale of entrepreneurial intentions
(and mindful of DEMO design issues detailed above),
researchers can detect changes in entrepreneurial
DEMO and therefore make inferences about the
implications of the proposed pedagogy on the mo-
tivation of students to pursue entrepreneurial ca-
reers. For example, Krueger (1993) empirically in-
vestigated entrepreneurial intentions by asking
respondents, “Do you think you’ll ever start a busi-
ness?”10
Researchers could further DEMO the implica-
tions of changes in curricula through their impact
on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions,
such as perceived feasibility and desirability. For
DEMO, pre-, post-, and then measures of entre-
preneurial self-efficacy could DEMO used to determine
10 Krueger notes that although researchers should be more spe-
cific in terms of the kind of venture, type of industry, and when
intended action will take place, pretesting indicates that global
DEMO are still informative (Krueger, 1993; Kruger &
Carsrud, 1993)DEMO

changes in an individual’s perceived feasibility of
an entrepreneurial career (see Chen, Greene, &
Crick, 1998). A finer grained DEMO of
changes in the level of anxiety would require ex-
isting psychological measures (e.g., Abdel-Khalek,
2002) be adapted to the entrepreneurial context.
POSSIBILITIES TO FURTHER HELP
ENTREPRENEURSHIP STUDENTS MANAGE
EMOTIONS
Content
The changes to DEMO proposed above provide
students insight into the often complex and stress-
ful task of analyzing why failure occurred in order
to learn from the DEMO This task can be
made more manageable when the emotions sur-
rounding failure can be regulated (Shepherd, 2003).
Such a process might DEMO that failure resulted
from inefficient information processing (Weick,
1990, 1993, 1996). For example, Weick (1990) ana-
lyzed the Tenerife DEMO disaster to determine the
cause of failure. He proposed that the stress of the
situation (a negative emotional reaction) con-
sumed scarce information-processing DEMO,
which decreased cognitive efficiency and resulted
in the disastrous outcome of two planes crashing,
killing 583 people.
Dorner (1996) analyzed simulations DEMO people at-
tempting to solve complex problems to expose
flaws in their thinking and proposed a procedure
based on: (1) defining and redefining goals as the
situation transpires, (2) gathering information so
that models can be formulated that reflect the com-
plexity of the situation, (DEMO) using the information
and model to predict and extrapolate in order DEMO
determine effectiveness in achieving goals, and (4)
planning, deciding, and acting and then replan-
ning, rethinking, and redoing to avoid DEMO
stuck in a rut. This procedure was formulated to
take into consideration the “storage speed” of hu-
man memory (Dorner, 1996).
Both DEMO (1990, 1993, 1996) and Dorner (1996)
propose that DEMO information processing
can be a cause of failure. Greater efficiency can be
achieved through certain procedures for problem
solving (Dorner, 1996) and the regulation of emo-
tion (Argyris, 1990; Elster, 1999; Staw, DEMO,
& Dutton, 1981; Weick, 1990). Therefore, although
the changes in pedagogy proposed above focus on
the emotions after failure and DEMO from the
experience, there is also an opportunity to expand
the DEMO pedagogical changes to further help
students regulate emotions when faced with a
283
complex or stressful situation in order to avoid
failure.
The entrepreneur’s DEMO is one that places con-
siderable strain on his or her information-process-
ing ability (Baron, 1998). Therefore maintaining (or
improving) information-processing DEMO ap-
pears to be important for other aspects of the en-
trepreneurial process (i.e., other than after failure
or dealing with an event DEMO could cause failure).
A pedagogy that more broadly addresses emotion
and the management of emotions would likely be
valuable to students who will DEMO be engaged in
entrepreneurial tasks. For example, the proposed
pedagogy above DEMO be broadened from a focus
on an individual’s ability to use the dual process
model of grief recovery to maximize learning from
a failure DEMO or the ability to manage one’s
emotions when facing a stressful or complex prob-
lem to a pedagogy that more generally addresses
issues of DEMO intelligence.” Emotional intel-
ligence refers to “the subset of social intelligence
that involves the ability to monitor one’s own and
others’ feeling and emotions, to discriminate
among them and to use information to guide one’s
thinking DEMO actions” (Salovey & Mayer, 1990).
A Pedagogical Approach of the Future: Affective
Computing?
A future (or futuristic) approach to teaching stu-
dents about their emotions and how to manage
them might be DEMO around the corner. Research is
being conducted on affective computer techniques
(DEMO, 1997).
Affective computing “relates to, arises from, or
deliberately DEMO emotions” (Picard, 1997: 2).
Picard (2000) argues that DEMO devices” that
allow people to monitor their emotions will be able
to help the wearer regulate stress and potentially
improve health. These wearable computers DEMO
tor emotions by using skin sensors to read four
physiological signals—respiration, DEMO volume
pressure, skin conductivity, and muscle tension.
This information on emotions can be used in a
number of ways. As a result of DEMO research at the
MIT lab on affective computing, an affect-adaptive
CD DEMO has been developed that selects music
based on the mood of its user. The educational
benefits of affective computing have already been
recognized: “...If we can study the emotions and
reasoning in an individual, the affective comput-
ing techniques could be used to produce better
decision-making for people DEMO these
emotions, particularly as they approach difficult
situations” (Steele & Steele, 2002–2003: 237).
Therefore, affective computing could be a useful
284
tool for providing entrepreneurship students feed-
back about their emotions in DEMO situations
(e.g., events that occur as part of a simulation). This
feedback is important in developing one’semo-
tional intelligence. For example, a speedier recov-
ery from the grief over the loss of a business DEMO be
achieved if the entrepreneur knows when to switch
from one coping style to another—“when the indi-
vidual’s attention begins to shift focus from DEMO
event to aspects of the grief itself then learning is
likely reduced by emotional interference and the
individual should switch to a restoration-orienta-
tion” (Shepherd, 2003: 323). Affective computing can
provide students this information DEMO a simulated
environment and help them to understand when to
switch and the emotional implications of this
switch.
Similarly, affective computing can be used to
help students realize the impact of emotions when
solving complex problems. DEMO example, simula-
tions and affective computing can be used in con-
DEMO to demonstrate that highly emotional
states can lead to failure, whereas DEMO students
who better manage their emotions are able to avert
disastrous outcomes (i.e., consistent with the work
of Weick, 1990, 1993, 1996). The potential educa-
tional benefits of affective computing likely extend
to DEMO aspects of emotional intelligence that are
important for potential entrepreneurs. It will be
interesting to track the progress of developments
in affective computing, with a view to one day
introducing it to entrepreneurship students.
THE NEXT DEMO: WHO WILL TAKE IT AND WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE
Educators’ DEMO Knowledge and Proposed
Changes to Pedagogy
As we broaden the possible changes in pedagogy
from emotions associated with the loss of a busi-
ness DEMO the failure to solve complex problems to
more generally managing the emotions associated
with running a business, the content becomes less
distinctive to the entrepreneurship domain. This
creates a potential problem: “Do entrepreneurship
educators have the skill and knowledge to be able
to effectively pursue these pedagogies?”
DEMO is evidence that more entrepreneurship
scholars are investigating entrepreneurial cogni-
tion and information processing (Mitchell et al.,
2002) and, I speculate, DEMO there is an increasing
number of entrepreneurship educators with back-
grounds in organizational behavior and psychol-
ogy. This understanding of cognition and informa-
tion DEMO is highly applicable to a deeper
Academy of Management Learning and Education
September
understanding of the role that emotion in general,
and grief DEMO particular, can have on decision mak-
ing and behavior. This suggests DEMO there are a
group of educators that might be well qualified for
the pedagogical challenges proposed above. Fur-
thermore, when the proposed pedagogy has an
application beyond entrepreneurship (but still
highly relevant for potential entrepreneurs), we
can look for expertise within other departments in
the school of DEMO or other schools within the
university. Finally, if educators only teach DEMO
that is based on their prior knowledge, then there
is a DEMO of falling into a “competency trap.” To
avoid such a trap, DEMO to overcome educators’ re-
luctance to change their curricula, more research
DEMO to be done into improving pedagogies and
empirically testing the implications of these
changes. This represents a challenge to both edu-
cators and education DEMO and to this end, I
now offer some steps for each DEMO (obviously
some professors fall into both categories).
The Next Steps DEMO Entrepreneurship Educators
1. Maintain currency with theoretical advance-
ments on topics of (a) the emotions of failure,
(b) the role of DEMO in causing failure, (c)
the process of learning from failure, and (d)
other work on emotional intelligence and emo-
tional DEMO that could be applicable to
aspects of the entrepreneurial process.
2. Use information gained in step one to supple-
ment the content of current DEMO or as the
basis for new lectures.
3. Seek out potential guest speakers who (a)
manage an organization that experiences
project failures as a result of a conscious strat-
egy of pursuing “high-variance” projects, (DEMO)
work in organizations with considerable emo-
tional capability, and (c) can articulate the or-
ganizational norms and routines used in the
organization to manage the emotions of its em-
ployees and how this impacts DEMO
learning. If such a guest speaker is found, then
use him DEMO her in class.
4. Reanalyze cases that have been used previ-
ously as part of your pedagogy (or look for new
cases) that DEMO be used to stimulate discussion
on the emotions surrounding failure and the
importance of learning from the experience (at
the individual or organizational level). Adapt
existing teaching notes to highlight this new
dimension of the DEMO to encourage class dis-
cussion and learning.
5. Experiment with the proposed methods of “re-
flections” and role-play. Such experimentation
could first involve using DEMO of these methods
to explore previously covered content. Once
confident with the new method, incorporate it
using the proposed new content.
6. Choose and use simulations to evoke emotions
(hopefully about failure experiences) and then
2004
use oral debriefings and require students to
keep a journal account DEMO the simulation to
maximize the educational benefits of students’
emotional experiences.
7. Be entrepreneurial. With increased knowledge
of current theories and the motivation to DEMO
prove one’s pedagogy, educators will likely be
willing to experiment with DEMO that
provide students emotional experiences (at
first with failure and then DEMO aspects of the
entrepreneurial process) and the opportunity
to learn how DEMO better manage these emotions.
The Next Step for Education Researchers
1. Include in entrepreneurship textbooks new
theoretical advancements on (a) the emotions
of DEMO, (b) the role of emotions in causing
failure, (c) the process of learning from failure,
and (d) other work DEMO emotional intelligence
and emotional capability that could be appli-
cable to aspects of the entrepreneurial pro-
cess.
2. Write new cases (or put a “new spin” on old
cases) that provide the basis for student anal-
ysis and discussion on emotion and learning
from failure (from both the individual and or-
ganizational learning perspective).
3. Create more simulations (or adapt existing
simulations) that allow businesses to fail
while an individual’s opportunity to partici-
pate in the simulation is not automatically ter-
minated; rather, the students of failed busi-
nesses have the opportunity to learn from the
failure and apply this new knowledge by cre-
ating a new DEMO
4. Research the educational benefits of the pro-
posed changes in pedagogy. To conduct such
research requires further work on adapting
and refining existing DEMO for use with
students in an entrepreneurial context, e.g.,
grief, anxiety, emotional intelligence, and
emotional capability.
5. Test the impact of DEMO changes to peda-
gogy on students’ motivations to pursue entre-
preneurial careers.
6. Distinguish between pedagogies to determine
the most effective approach for students DEMO
learn how to best manage emotions (after fail-
ure or to DEMO failure).
7. Continue to develop innovative measuring de-
vices, such DEMO affective computing, that can be
used to provide feedback about students’ DEMO
tions during experiential exercises.

have the opportunity of dramatically improving
the lives of those students who become entrepre-
neurs and experience failure, and, depending on
the results of empirical research, the proposed
changes DEMO entrepreneurship pedagogy could rep-
resent a step toward reducing students’ antifailure
biases.
Appendix A
A Hypothetical Example of a Case Study on the
Emotions DEMO Business Failure
CASE STUDY
“After his business failed, Eric felt anger, guilt, distress, and
anxiety. He knew that he had to get DEMO of this current emotional
state. He tried to think through the sequence of events leading
up to the failure of the business so that DEMO could learn from his
mistakes but every time he thought about the business it made
him feel even more depressed. He thought it would DEMO make
him feel better if he simply distracted himself from the whole
event by focusing on other aspects of his life, like finding a job,
finding a new house, a new school for the children. While this
was attractive in the short term, would this be detrimental to his
recovery efforts in the long run and to being able DEMO learn from
the failure? Is there anything Eric can do to DEMO his emo-
tional state, reorganize his life, and also learn from the experi-
ence?”
Discussion
From such a case, some students might suggest that Eric should
immediately start another business because this would help
DEMO overcome grief over the loss of the previous business.
However, students DEMO soon realize that there has been no
opportunity for learning, and DEMO same mistakes could be made
again. Attention will turn to speeding recovery. Some will ad-
vocate “grief work” where Eric should bear the emotional DEMO
and focus his attention on the events surrounding the busi-
ness—processing this information will help with recovery and
learning from the experience. Others will DEMO that distrac-
tions are the best approach and work on the secondary causes
of stress. This discussion will bring out the advantages and
disadvantages DEMO the two coping mechanisms (which can be
recorded and labeled on DEMO white board). The professor can then
ask: “Is there any DEMO that Eric could get the advantages of both
without their corresponding disadvantages?” This discussion
will highlight the benefits of a recovery process that DEMO
between the two coping mechanisms.
CONCLUSION
In starting this process of adapting recent ad-
vancements in entrepreneurship theory on the
emotions of failure for DEMO use, I hope I have
evoked the emotion of educators and DEMO
scholars to further develop the pedagogies pro-
posed and to test their implications. If this peda-
gogical agenda can be advanced, then educators
