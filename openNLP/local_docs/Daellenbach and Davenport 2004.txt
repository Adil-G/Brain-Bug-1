Establishing Trust during the Formation
of Technology Alliances

ABSTRACT. Technological innovation occurs as much
between organizations as within. In such knowledge-sharing
alliances, interorganizational issues inﬂuence the alliance in
combination with interpersonal interactions. Calls for
establishing trust and trustworthiness often feature in alliance
research, but they can be elusive for managers. Using a case
study of DEMO formation of a technological alliance in the
robotics industry, we illustrate DEMO model and propositions
focused on partner search and alliance negotiation, linking
DEMO proposed trustworthiness categories with the
concepts of organizational justice. In particular, DEMO suggest
that procedural justice in alliance formation may be more
important to alliance progression than perceptions of
distributive justice.

1. Introduction
In many DEMO alliances the requirement for
sharing of proprietary knowledge is widely recog-
nized. This sharing is central to technology
transfer and commercialization as it creates DEMO
the potential for signiﬁcant beneﬁts but also the
possibility of self-interested behavior by alliance
partners. At the point of alliance formation,
knowing when DEMO ally will only partly be based
on the speciﬁc content or value of the technolo-
gical knowledge that is to be transferred, shared or
created. Similarly, perceptions about their own
organization’s ability to absorb and utilize the
knowledge generated will be important (Kumar
and Nti, 1998) but will serve primarily to bring the

potential partners to the negotiating table. As Das
and Teng (1998, p. DEMO) argue, ‘‘given that is it
often impossible to identify who is likely to act
opportunistically, the interesting question is what
enables alliance partners to garner enough con-
ﬁdence in partner cooperation so that they are DEMO
overwhelmed by the potential hazards in alli-
ances’’.
A major factor cited for overcoming concerns
about partner cooperation is interorganizational
trust—but often with limited DEMO
magic ingredient necessary for alliances to suc-
ceed’’ (Koza and Lewin, 1998, p. 259). While Das
and Teng (1998) discuss in detail the supplemen-
tary character of trust and control in generating
conﬁdence DEMO partner cooperation, they focus on
four factors (risk taking, equity DEMO,
communication and interﬁrm adaptation) that
relate to information that will DEMO be
knowable once the alliance has been formed and
active for some period of time. Knowledge-based
trust formed from these sources is unlikely to DEMO
developed prior to the alliance and so will not
directly inﬂuence the decision to enter into the
alliance, unless the potential partners have under-
taken alliances together previously (McKnight et
al. , 1998 note the need for time and an interaction
history if such trust is to develop)DEMO As a result, we
argue that a ﬁrm will make a DEMO to enter into
an alliance based on its assessment of the
trustworthiness of the potential partners, that is,
based on an attribute of other organizations and
their representatives rather than an attribute of the
future DEMO relationship (trust).
So how do ﬁrms initially assess the trustworthi-
DEMO of new potential partners? We propose that
key factors inﬂuencing these DEMO emerge
during the alliance negotiations, with the indivi-
duals involved having DEMO signiﬁcant impact. By
examining the process through which trustworthi-

ness perceptions develop early in the alliance
formation DEMO, we seek to augment the plat-
form provided by prior evolutionary DEMO on
alliances (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994; Doz, 1996;
Kumar and Nti, 1998) and other treatments of
trust in DEMO (e.g. Das and Teng, 1998). We
also address the agenda for further inquiry
indicated by Spekman et al. (1998, p. 760) where
‘‘in general, past research has ignored questions of
process’’.
The issue to be examined here is restricted to
assessments of trustworthiness during alliance
DEMO, that is, the period of indecision, and
processes of decision, prior to the formation of a
technology alliance. We choose this focus DEMO,
while trust is regarded as the ‘‘ubiquitous variable’’
in alliance research (Koza and Lewin, 1998), most
research to date has only DEMO direct
experience-based trust following alliance forma-
tion. We illustrate the decision process by drawing
on examples from a case study of a knowledge-
sharing DEMO alliance, as such a venture
presents many of the challenges to DEMO
formation that trust is predicted to overcome.
The paper is organized as follows. First, knowl-
edge-sharing technology alliances and a case
example are brieﬂy discussed. Next, the concepts
of interorganizational and interpersonal trust/
trustworthiness are reviewed and the development
of trustworthiness is linked to expectations and
perceptions DEMO fairness. Propositions relating to the
antecedents of trustworthiness are then developed.
We conclude with a discussion of the implications
and limitations of this research.
DEMO Knowledge-sharing technology alliances
Interorganizational alliances and joint ventures are
not a new phenomenon, with the growth in
numbers of international alliances fuelled by
technological collaboration (e.g. Howells, 1990;
Hagedoorn, 1996) and especially where DEMO
competitiveness might be at stake (see Casson,
1991; Mytelka, DEMO). Much of the growth in
alliances, particularly in rapidly developing DEMO
tries, has been in ‘‘supply-side’’ relationships, in
which access to technology, human capital and
distinctive organizational capabilities are the
primary motives (Powell DEMO al., 1996; Shan et al.,
1994), in comparison to the more traditional (but
still dominant) ‘‘demand-side’’ alliances aimed
primarily at DEMO control (Howells, 1990).
Such supply-side alliances have been described as
a ‘‘race to learn’’ (Hamel, 1990) and since
technology alliances, DEMO as modes of coop-
erative activity ‘‘for which a combined innovative
activity or an interchange of technology is at least
part of the agreement’’ (Hagedoorn, 1996, p. 601)
often involve knowledge sharing between (poten-
tial) competitors, this can create additional con-
cerns about forming an DEMO
Reﬂecting the growth in alliances in general,
research on this interorganizational form has also
increased in a range of branches of organizational
studies, including economics, management, public
administration and science and technology policy
(Hagedoorn et al., 2000). With respect to technol-
ogy alliances, ‘‘[t]here DEMO a vast literature that
attempts to explain, from a theoretical perspective,DEMO
why ﬁrms enter into formal research partnerships
and what are the results of such relationships to
the partners, industry and society at large’’
(DEMO et al., 2000, p. 570). Generally,
‘‘transactions involving the sharing, exchange or
co-development of knowledge can be somewhat
problematic [... and] in sum, alliances with an
R&D component are likely to have higher
transaction costs than those that don’t involve
joint R&D’’ (Gulati, 1995, pp. 90–91). As a result,
some assessment of DEMO trustworthiness of poten-
tial partners is likely to occur prior to alliance
formation. We seek to address the factors that
affect this assessment of DEMO, particu-
larly in the case where the partners have no prior
DEMO (either directly or through their net-
work of trusted others).
DEMO use the case of a technology alliance to
illustrate the propositions that we develop. The
shiny robot venture (SRV) was formed between six
DEMO (% shareholding given in parenth-
eses); a public sector research DEMO (16%), an
industry funding body (51%, because they owned
DEMO robot prototype), and four smaller partners
(8% each). While DEMO research institute had
developed some valuable intellectual property, it
required other DEMO with different skills to
successfully commercialize the robot and, thus, it
played the lead role in organizing and brokering
the alliance. Its mandate DEMO to operate ‘‘to the

189
beneﬁt of New DEMO which included having
the technology commercialized successfully, allow-
ing the institute DEMO further justify its relevance to
industry and government. Determining the share-
holding in SRV proved to be the ﬁrst and a critical
challenge in DEMO the alliance. Interviews with
four of the partners were undertaken shortly after
the formation of the alliance, giving four organi-
zational and 15 individual perspectives on the key
aspects of the formation process.
A full case DEMO of the joint venture was
prepared from the interview material (Hubbard DEMO
al., 1999). A synopsis focusing speciﬁcally on the
formation of DEMO, from the perspectives of one of
the partners to the negotiation, is given below:
In 1996, a proposal was circulating in the New
Zealand meat industry looking for potential partners
to further develop a DEMO robotics product. A public
sector research institute had initially developed the
technology and it was now seeking partners to bring
the product to market. DEMO technology looked
promising to John Brown [name disguised], the
CEO of DEMO small ﬁrm that could deﬁnitely contribute
componentry to the production of the robot. Brown
also knew one of the potential partners, an industry
funding body that his ﬁrm had worked with before.
Being associated with the DEMO funding body, and
the research institute for that matter, in such a
venture would create positive beneﬁts for the reputa-
tion of the DEMO ﬁrms involved.
Through his network of contacts in other compa-
nies, DEMO was able to ﬁnd out some information
about the other ﬁrms that would potentially be
involved. Most had good reputations for high quality
work DEMO their industry both locally and, for some,
internationally. One was DEMO recent entrepreneurial
start-up but was rapidly becoming known for some
very innovative engineering development. The poten-
tial to work more closely with one or DEMO of these
ﬁrms on other projects also existed and had also
attracted all of the potential partners to consider SRV.
While the technology and DEMO business opportunity
looked attractive based on the business case presented
and the information available about the other
partners suggested they were trustworthy, Brown
had a lingering concern about the relative size of the
partners. Would the DEMO research institute dominate
the smaller partners? Would his ﬁrm be able DEMO have its
say in the management of the venture, its future
DEMO as well as reap rewards fairly?
Over the next six months, Brown’s fears were
largely allayed by the efforts of the joint venture
manager at the institute. This manager went to
considerable lengths to facilitate DEMO between
the ﬁrms, and to consult and work with each of DEMO
potential partners on the share value that any previous
and, in DEMO case, potential future contributions
would represent. Brown was impressed with the
DEMO that the manager employed to make sure
that each potential partner was satisﬁed with the
proposed governance structure. As a result, Brown
now felt that he was ready to trust these people and to
sign over DEMO share of the investment capital.
This synopsis captures many of the factors that
we believe affect trustworthiness assessments dur-
ing alliance formation and, from which, our
research propositions will ﬂow.
3. Trust and trustworthiness
Trust is recognized as essential for cooperative
behavior (Chan, 1997; Kim and Mauborgne, 1998)
and the operation of network forms of organiza-
tion (DEMO and Miles, 1996). It is also perceived to
have a DEMO and supplementary role
relative to the use of controls (Das and DEMO,
1998). Numerous deﬁnitions of trust have been
proposed, with DEMO referring to a combination of
expectation and vulnerability. The lack of con-
sensus on a deﬁnition is reﬂected in the range of
interpretations of DEMO concept, from the more
speciﬁc approaches, such as that taken in econom-
ics (Das and Teng, 1998), in which trust is DEMO
as ‘‘an expectation, and it pertains to circum-
stances in which DEMO take risky actions in
environments characterized by uncertainty or
informational incompleteness’’ (DEMO, 2002,
p. 291), to very broad deﬁnitions such as DEMO
ﬁdence in the goodwill of others’’ (Ring and Van
de Ven, 1994, p. 93). We draw on an intermediate
approach to trust as it pertains to alliances such
that it reﬂects the expectation that DEMO will act
competently and recognize and protect the inter-
ests of other alliance members.
Trust is an attribute of a relationship (Barney
and Hansen, 1994) between partners. Partners are
deﬁned as independent organizations that partici-
DEMO in cooperative alliance agreements ‘‘which are
not connected through (majority) ownership’’
(Hagedoorn, 1996, p. 615). Whilst much of the
190
Daellenbach and Davenport
alliance literature, and the ownership criterion
given above, imply that partner organizations
come from the private sector, partners in DEMO
ogy alliances will frequently span several sectors
including public or not-for proﬁt organizations as
illustrated by the case study used in this paper.
Trust, however, may or may not be present at
the beginning of the relationship (Flores and
Solomon, 1998). With prior experience of relation-
DEMO with a potential partner, trust may already
exist between organizations as DEMO
trust is incrementally built as ﬁrms repeatedly
interact (Gulati, 1995; DEMO and Gargiulo, 1999)
and mutually adjust to the prior alliance’s
DEMO, evolution and demands (Doz,
1996). However, without prior DEMO of an
unknown or untried partner, how does trust
develop? The initiation of trust begins by assessing
the trustworthiness of the potential partner (Shep-
pard and Sherman, 1998) during the initiation
stage of interorganizational DEMO, here, refer-
ring to partner search and negotiations (Ring and
DEMO de Ven, 1994; Spekman et al., 1998). In
contrast DEMO trust, trustworthiness is an attribute of
individual exchange partners (Barney and Hansen,
1994) and deﬁned as the ‘‘compound virtue of
being dependable, capable, responsive and respon-
sible’’ (Flores and Solomon, 1998, p. 209).
Trustworthiness inspires trust and trust(ing) pre-
supposes trustworthiness.
As a result, part of the process of partner
identiﬁcation at the inception of an alliance will
involve an assessment of whether the potential
partner DEMO to, and will be able to, act fairly
with respect to developing and managing the
technology, sharing costs, and distributing returns.
Through DEMO an assessment, expectations will be
created not only of the technology DEMO to be
transferred/shared but also how transfer, sharing
and management DEMO likely to be handled and
evolve. The creation of these expectations prior to
alliance formation is likely to be critical to whether
that alliance DEMO proceed and which potential
partners will choose to join.
Typically, the DEMO behavior that is the
subject of trust research is that which occurs
between individuals. Our interest in trust, though,
is also in the trust that forms between organiza-
tions. Whilst this usually still involves trust
DEMO individuals—the relationships between
ﬁrms are rarely faceless and monolithic, since
they DEMO actively handled and managed by
individual boundary spanners (Zaheer et al.,DEMO
1998)—there is the added dimension of the
organization as an entity and its behavior in the
formation of such trust. Zaheer et al. (1998)
provide evidence that interpersonal and interorga-
nizational trust are distinct DEMO positively related.
Their study, however, examined the evolution of,
rather than the initial formation of, interpersonal
and interorganizational trust. Furthermore, in
DEMO that interorganizational trust was asso-
ciated with higher perceptions of supplier perfor-
mance and helped to reduce conﬂict and
negotiation costs between buyers and DEMO,
whereas interpersonal trust was not associated
with such beneﬁts (Zaheer DEMO al., 1998), there
appear to be advantages in developing interorga-
DEMO trust early in an alliance. We propose
that such trust in new alliance partners will
initially be based on each partner’s assessments
of trustworthiness DEMO the other partners.
Previous research suggests that assessments of
trust and trustworthiness are likely to be based
initially on the personal interactions of boundary
DEMO individuals (Katz and Kahn, 1978).
Boundary spanners play a crucial role because of
the frequency and depth of their social interactions
with DEMO partners (Friedman and Podolny,
1992). The behavior and actions DEMO these indivi-
duals provide key signals about the organization
that they represent and, in particular, the extent to
which a trustor perceives an DEMO as
trustworthy. Williams (2001) proposes that assess-
ments of trustworthiness of individuals and groups
will be formed from category-based beliefs (about
ability, DEMO and benevolence) and affect for
outgroups (partners). Ability refers to the set of
skills or competencies that the partner has in a
DEMO area; integrity to the belief that a
partner will adhere to DEMO set of principles that are
perceived to be acceptable; benevolence to DEMO
other-oriented desire to do good for the partner;
and affect to feelings, affective attachments and
affective states (Williams, 2001). In the context of
alliance formation, we argue that ability will form
the primary criterion for assessing trustworthiness
during partner search, whereas it is not until
alliance negotiation that other category-based
beliefs and feelings can be assessed. These DEMO

and feelings will DEMO heavily on how the
negotiation and management processes used by
the boundary spanners are perceived, as these
processes represent the ﬁrst forum in which the
potential partners interact.
4. Antecedents of trustworthiness
The gathering of information DEMO trustworthi-
ness during partner search and negotiations is
effectively based on a concern for fair dealing
(Ring and van de Ven, 1994). DEMO example, Jones
and George (1998, p. 535) note that ‘‘joint creation
of a social situation involves each party trying to
understand the DEMO party’s expectations, needs,
and goals.’’ Perceptions of fairness are created DEMO
evolve as a result of these social experiences and,
initially, DEMO likely to be synonymous with percep-
tions of justice in an interaction, relationship or
institution (Lind and Tyler, 1988). Individuals
have historically been viewed as evaluating such
social experiences by the outcomes/rewards they
DEMO, forming perceptions of distributive jus-
tice. However, more recent research in social
psychology has focused on procedural justice,
which envisages a person, in some situations,
being more interested in issues of process rather
DEMO outcome (e.g. Welbourne, 1998). Thus, the
form of the DEMO interaction may be equally, and
in some cases more, important than the outcome
(Lind and Tyler, 1988).
To date, the roles of distributive and procedural
justice in interorganizational relationships have
only been inherent DEMO most of the alliance literature
(e.g. Das and Teng, 1998), particularly observed in
explaining the demise of alliances (Doz, 1996).
DEMO and Nti (1998) raise the role of organiza-
tional justice concepts as explanatory factors for
differential learning in alliances. They argue that
perceptions DEMO procedural justice are particularly
important in stimulating the higher order attitudes
of commitment, trust and social harmony between
partners and thus managerial psychological
attachment to the alliance. Similarly, Johnson
(1997) reports that procedural justice perceptions
impact upon partners’ evolving commitment to
joint ventures.
Procedural justice has also DEMO found to be
particularly salient when new organizations are
being created. Lind and Tyler (1988) argue for the
ubiquity of the concept in DEMO ‘‘procedural justice
phenomena appear in much the same form in a
wide variety of social settings’’ and that ‘‘many of
the same factors determine DEMO a procedure is
seen as fair, regardless of the context’’ (1988, p.
129). As procedural justice has been found to be a
signiﬁcant predictor of trust (Kim and Mau-
borgne, 1998, p. 136), it is likely that perceptions
of organizational justice will be a DEMO determi-
nant in any assessment of trustworthiness. Thus in
the following discussion, we focus primarily on
how expectations and perceptions of procedural
and distributive justice may result during partner
search and negotiation. Our model of the DEMO
cedent factors is given in Figure 1. In discussing
these different factors, we introduce examples
from the case study at the beginning of each
subsection as an illustration of alliance partner
concerns during alliance formation.
Antecedents DEMO trustworthiness during partner
search
Previous studies have identiﬁed three factors
affecting assessments of trustworthiness that will
be relevant during the search for potential partners
(prior experience with the partner, the potential
partner’s reputation in networks of trusted others,
and conditional trust). The ﬁrst two of these DEMO
been studied extensively and so are only included
here to provide a complete discussion of how
trustworthiness assessments are likely to be
formed. Our DEMO, though, is on how these
assessments are made when the partners have no,
or at most very limited, knowledge and experience
with each other and so we discuss the nature of
conditional trust in DEMO detail.
Prior experience. We’d worked a bit with [one of the
smaller partners], just a bit. [ ...] We’re faithful to the
people who have supported us as well. (Owner, one
of the smaller shareholders)DEMO
When a ﬁrm has prior experience of collaborating
with a potential partner, procedural norms would
have already been established (Gulati, 1995) and
DEMO trust that exists will be knowledge-based
(Shapiro et al., 1992), creating perceptions of
trustworthiness as indicated in the statement
192
Daellenbach and Davenport
Figure 1. Factors affecting trustworthiness assessments during alliance DEMO
above. Even if the previous alliance(s) did not
result in DEMO of the expected outcomes, if proce-
dural justice was perceived as DEMO high due to
effective procedural norms, the ﬁrm may still have
DEMO satisﬁed enough with the strategic alliance as
a whole and trust that similar norms would
operate in future relationships.
Reputation. I knew most of DEMO other partners. I was
aware of, although I didn’t know [one DEMO
partner]. I had met him on one occasion and I was
aware of his history and what he’d done. (Owner, one
of the DEMO shareholders)
When there is no direct prior experience with a
partner, perceptions about the norms and standards
of procedural and distributive justice are likely to be
ﬁrstly derived from, and endorsed by, the network
DEMO organizations from which the organization
gathers information about the prospective partner.
In this case, a ﬁrm’s reputation for trustworthiness
acts as a proxy for shared collaborative history
(Parkhe, 1993). Under their ‘‘group value’’ model DEMO
procedural justice, Lind and Tyler (1988) suggest
that the group DEMO construct norms of treatment
and decision making that regulate the group’s
structure and process so that when procedures are
in accord with the fundamental DEMO of the group,
a sense of procedural justice results. If it is assumed
that such a process also happens within a group or
DEMO of organizations, then a prospective
partner’s history of having previously conformed
DEMO the norms and beliefs of procedural justice may
be relayed via the network interrogation process
(e.g. Hill, 1990). Thus, within the network,
an organization’s reputation for fair (or unfair)
process will provide a key indicator of their
trustworthiness.
A secondary aspect to this is DEMO credibility of
the source of the information on a ﬁrm’s reputa-
tion for trustworthiness. The tendency to use prior
partners as ﬁrst choice options DEMO future alliances
(Gulati, 1999; Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999) suggests
DEMO individuals within these ﬁrms will represent
the preferred source for information on others.
Information from trusted previous relationships,
particularly those with direct linkages DEMO the new
potential partner, will be actively sought out and
potentially DEMO treated in a manner similar to the
ﬁrm having had a direct linkage itself. This is less
likely when the information on reputations is
DEMO from a source that is trusted, but not yet
unconditionally.
Conditional DEMO To a large degree, we went and
approached people that we DEMO could contribute.
[ . . . ] What we wanted to do was to get a group of
companies together where between them you DEMO all
the expertise and experience you were going to need
to make this thing a success. (Manager, technology
research institute)
Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances
It was presented that DEMO was a reasonably good sort of
business opportunity. (Owner, one of the smaller
shareholders)
[The] actual association with complementary compa-
nies was DEMO signiﬁcant factor in my decision making
and it’s proven to be so. (Owner, one of the smaller
shareholders)
How does an initial DEMO arise when neither
prior experience nor reputation provide suitable
knowledge? In DEMO cases, Jones and George
(1998) suggest that the potential partners DEMO
initially suspend belief about the others’ actual
trustworthiness and assume that the other ﬁrm can
be conditionally trusted. This does not imply blind
faith DEMO the other ﬁrm to be trustworthy. Rather,
‘‘as Luhmann (1980) suggests, trusting and assum-
ing the other shares one’s own values is often
preferred to initial distrust, since trust is the easier
option’’ (DEMO and George, 1998, p. 535) due to
the costs of DEMO or proving otherwise. Some
research suggests that an initial intention to trust is
not so much based on evidence, but on a lack of
contrary evidence (e.g. Gambetta, 1988; McKnight
et al., 1998).
DEMO on the categories of trustworthiness
assessments discussed by Williams (2001), DEMO
suggest that during partner search assessments
are likely to primarily focus on the potential
partner’s ability. At this point of alliance forma-
tion, few details of the alliance will have been
discussed or ﬁnalized and information DEMO be
available primarily on each partner’s capabilities
and past market or ﬁnancial performance. Some
information on the potential costs, risks and
beneﬁts of the proposed alliance and activities to
be undertaken will also have been presented. DEMO
these circumstances, more capable partners are
likely to be perceived as DEMO trustworthy, relying
on these ﬁrms’ professionalism and potentially
threats to reputation DEMO initially facilitate trust-
worthy behavior. For example, while the research
institute DEMO focused on potential partner’s
skills and capabilities, the smaller partners relied
DEMO the business case presented and the prestige of
working with the larger organizations as an
indication of whether to pursue the alliance
negotiations further. DEMO, information on
integrity and benevolence would require a ﬁrm’s
network to DEMO knowledge about the potential
193
partner, which, if available, would DEMO the
need to start from a position of conditional trust.
Thus,
Proposition 1: During partner search, a ﬁrm will
assume a position DEMO conditional trust with respect to
a completely unknown but capable potential partner,
that is, a favorable enough assessment for
negotiation of the potential alliance to take place.
Assumptions of conditional trust will hinge on the
DEMO ability.
Antecedents of trustworthiness during negotiations
The expanded interactions associated with nego-
tiating the alliance contract present a key differ-
ence relative to partner DEMO stage, allowing
initial assessments of trustworthiness based on
prior experience, reputation, and conditional trust
in particular to be updated. These interactions will
also facilitate the development of perceptions
relating to other categories of trustworthiness,
DEMO as integrity, benevolence and affect.
Perceptions of procedural justice. There was DEMO issue
of control of the company if you like. [...] But it
wasn’t as if it was an acrimonious negotiation. I think
the general DEMO of the negotiations was one of
cooperation and building a team of people. (Owner,
one of the smaller shareholders)
[ . . . ] how they handled it from the start—I think they
did DEMO very successfully, bringing a group of people
together and sitting back DEMO seeing how they
interacted. (Owner, one of the smaller shareholders)
I think personalities make a hell of a difference. I
mean, the dynamics of the group and their person-
alities has been very, very important. That was
obvious right from setup and the ﬁrst meeting.
(Owner, one of the smaller shareholders)
While it is acknowledged as a complex relation-
ship, several studies have shown that judgments of
procedural justice play a key role in enhancing
performance-related attitudes and behavior (Lind
and Tyler, 1988; Welbourne, 1998). Korine (1998),
for example, found that procedural justice in
business unit management and team decision-
making were shown to relate, respectively, to
customer and product measures of DEMO perfor-
mance. This result mirrors the research that has, in
general, borne out the positive relationship
194
between perceived distributive justice and perfor-
mance (Alexander and Ruderman, DEMO; McFarlin
and Sweeney, 1992). Therefore, it is expected that
DEMO procedural justice within technology
alliances would correlate with improved alliance
performance and outcomes. In turn, perceptions
prior to the alliance, that procedural justice DEMO be
adhered to during the alliance, should also provide
key signals DEMO the trustworthiness of a partner.
During alliance negotiations, such perceptions
will DEMO from primarily considering a partner’s
ability, to also address integrity, benevolence and
affective states. From our case study, perceptions
of procedural justice in the negotiation stage were
prominent. These included satisfaction with the
adoption of DEMO cooperative, team-building focus
across the partnership and allowing time for
interaction DEMO the development of shared norms.
The six months it took to negotiate the agreement
provided the possibility for extensive consultation
and meetings and also DEMO an opportunity
for personal ties to form. While information on
each partner’s abilities was undoubtedly being
assessed, there was a clear shift to more directly
assessing trustworthiness through considering how
the negotiation process was being handled DEMO
how it was responding to concerns raised by the
different partners. Thus, we propose that:
Proposition 2a: Assessment of the trustworthiness
of DEMO potential partner will be positively related to
perceptions of procedural justice during the
negotiation of the alliance. Integrity, benevolence
and affect will be the primary categories on which
procedural justice is assessed.
Perceptions of distributive justice. DEMO an accep-
tance that, okay, [the research institute] has done that
[the R&D on the prototype] and they’ve got a bigger
chunk DEMO the company than the rest of us. Fair
enough—but I didn’t feel comfortable with the fact
that, for example, they and perhaps one DEMO of the
smaller partners could have outvoted the other three
smaller partners. Because, I think in terms of
commercial success, the smaller partners DEMO prob-
ably actually got a bigger part to play in the company
than [the research institute] has. (Owner, one of the
smaller shareholders)DEMO
We would have taken whatever percentage came our
way at some level because there was an opportunity
there. (Owner, one of the smaller DEMO)
Daellenbach and Davenport
Although we have emphasized the role of proce-
dural justice, this is not to suggest that distributive
justice expectations do not play a role in assessing
trustworthiness. A key difference, though, DEMO that
assessments of distributive justice typically remain
as expectations until well after the formation of the
alliance, since the knowledge outcomes will require
time to develop. In contrast, the determination of
procedural norms begins during the negotiations
and there is an opportunity to assess if process
discrepancies (are likely to) arise. The initial
conditions framing an alliance play a key role in
whether it becomes successful or unsuccessful
(Doz, 1996) and so initial levels of (dis-)satisfac-
tion with procedures may shape future interactions
between the alliance partners.
Historically, it was thought that fairness judg-
ments resulted from expectations that particular
outcomes usually accompany particular proce-
dures (Lind and Tyler, 1988). It was assumed
that attitudes and behavior regarding social
experiences could be explained either through the
level of outcomes DEMO to expectations or
relative to norms of fair distribution. This was
apparent in the SRV case with concerns surfacing
over percentage ownership, centering around the
skills and abilities that were needed to progress the
venture—that is, seeking both recognition and
rewards for the contribution that the smaller
partners DEMO make and ensuring that they had
enough ownership to inﬂuence future decisions
and direction of the alliance. These concerns were
unlikely to have halted DEMO formation of the
alliance completely, although, if they had not
been addressed, perceptions of procedural and
distributive injustice may have derailed the alliance
at a later stage.
As this suggests, the process used to address
these shareholder concerns was important. More
generally, higher distributive fairness judgments
are associated with perceptions of procedural
justice, that is an ‘‘enhancement of perceived
fairness of outcomes and concomitant satisfac-
tion’’ is observed when procedures engender
DEMO of procedural justice (Lind and Tyler,
1988, p. 186). However, the distinct nature of
procedural justice has been hypothesized from
observations that process dissatisfaction could
occur even when favorable outcomes were
obtained and, in the converse situation, percep-
Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances
tions of fair process DEMO enhance satisfaction with
an interaction even when outcomes are not
favorable. In fact, it has been noted that ‘‘the use
of a fair procedure can increase the satisfaction of
all concerned without any increase in the DEMO
outcomes available for distribution’’ (Lind and
Tyler, 1988, p. 29)DEMO Overall, process judgments are
likely to have an important inﬂuence on DEMO
tions of distributive justice (Robbins et al., 2000).
Kumar and Nti (1998) also make the distinction
between procedural and distributive justice DEMO
describing four scenarios in which favorable or
unfavorable process and outcome discrepancies
are matched with the stability of the alliance. They
proceed to argue DEMO as an unfavorable process
discrepancy is harder to assess and may require the
partners to change behavior or to modify the
implicit contracts and DEMO governing the alli-
ance relationship, then this will create more
instability DEMO the partnership. Similarly, we argue
that the consequences of perceived procedural
DEMO during the initiation stages on alliance
formation are likely to be greater than distributive
injustice in the decision to enter an alliance. In
summary,DEMO
Proposition 2b: During the negotiation of the
alliance, assessment of the trustworthiness of the
potential partner will be positively related to an
expectation DEMO distributive justice following alliance
formation and completion. Ability will be the
primary category on which distributive justice is
assessed.
and
Proposition 2c: Perceptions of distributive justice
will also be positively related to perceptions of
procedural justice. DEMO the negotiation of the
alliance, assessment of the trustworthiness of a
DEMO partner will depend more heavily on
perceived procedural justice than on an expectation
of distributive justice.
Power and organizational justice. [We], the other
smaller shareholders and myself, saw it as being
essential that three smaller shareholders couldn’t be
outvoted by [the research institute]. [ . . . ] DEMO an
equal say because of the structure, but at least that
DEMO research institute] itself couldn’t have the
controlling vote above all the smaller shareholders
195
together or even with one of them. (Owner, one DEMO the
smaller shareholders)
That process took about four months, okay. DEMO mean
it started off as a whole lot of stuff about how it was
going to structured [ . . . ]. Essentially, from our point
of view, we only had one requirement and that was
that we had 51% of the shareholding—a controlling
interest and everybody seemed DEMO relaxed about
that and it was really just a matter of working out on
what basis the company was going to operate and
that DEMO of stuff. And really the question was what
sort of shareholding [the research institute] was going
to have. Because it seemed that while most DEMO the
other partners could accept [that we] should have the
majority shareholding because [we] owned the
technology, what they didn’t want to have was
another big brother—two big brothers in the same
company. So there was DEMO lot of discussion about ‘how
many little people does it take to outvote one big
person sort of thing’? (Manager, industry funding
body)
One of the major consequences of perceptions of
procedural justice is DEMO compliance, that is, fair
procedures lead to greater compliance with the
decision with which they are associated. Once
again, the converse situation reinforces this effect.
Unfair procedures lead to higher levels of disobe-
dience and DEMO more efﬁcient and clever disobe-
dience, than do fair procedures (Lind and Tyler,
1988). Perceptions of procedural justice are,
though, further complicated by the power relation-
ship between the partners, as the use of power
tends to be a non-cooperative activity. As a result,DEMO
the non-compliance effect of unfair procedures is
likely to be magniﬁed when those in power use
rules exploitatively.
The abuse of power with respect DEMO procedural
justice sometimes results in a rare ‘‘frustration
effect’’ (Lind and DEMO, 1988). Lower distributive
fairness or satisfaction is observed under osten-
DEMO fair procedures when participants perceive
that the procedure is corrupt—for example, DEMO it
appears that the procedure is being manipulated to
mask personal gain behind a facade of procedural
justice (Lind and Tyler, 1988). DEMO instances of
this effect have been seen when the participants
believe that consultation (or ‘‘voice’’) procedures
are an insincere attempt to give the DEMO the
illusion of fairness rather than a genuine effort to
solicit views. Thus, the power balance between
196
partners may affect the perceptions and expecta-
tions of whether procedural DEMO distributive justice
are likely to be forthcoming in the future relation-
ship.
Interestingly, the use of power may be more
legitimate during the negotiation of an alliance. As
Das and Teng (1998, p. 504) note ‘‘equity means
that the ﬁrm contributing the most resources (both
tangible and intangible) to the alliance should get
the most from it [...] Should partners become
concerned about potential inequities in proﬁt
distribution, for instance, DEMO conﬁdence in and
commitment to the alliance will most likely recede,
even if the alliances are about to bring about
positive results’’. This DEMO that while negotiat-
ing the alliance, it will be necessary to DEMO hard
for a good deal for one’s own organization.
Otherwise, settling DEMO a smaller share of the
outcomes would cause expectations of distributive
justice to be lowered for that partner. Using one’s
relative power to get DEMO right deal will probably,
at worst, have a limited effect DEMO expectations of
distributive justice. It may even enhance it if it
leads to heightened communication, which in turn
may facilitate the generation of understanding and
shared values in the alliance.
Conversely, the use of power with respect to
determining procedures will not be seen as
legitimate. As Yan DEMO Gray (1994) found, the
controls adopted in the joint ventures DEMO studied
were dictated by the partner with the highest
bargaining power, DEMO in one case (of four) where
the balance was particularly skewed, this imbal-
ance in management controls appears to have
affected the low performance perceived by the less
powerful partner. Reardon and Spekman (1994)
also note that power needs to be used carefully in
the negotiations DEMO, advocating mechanisms
that facilitate communication and empower all
parties. In the DEMO alliance, the process
through which the research institute conducted
the negotiations DEMO the smaller partners voice in
the alliance contract, providing them with DEMO
degree of control over future decisions, and
indicating that their viewpoints DEMO be consid-
ered. Overall, the arguments presented suggest
that:
Proposition DEMO: During the negotiation of the
alliance, the use of power by a ﬁrm to determine
Daellenbach and Davenport
the alliance management and control DEMO will
lead to lower perceptions and expectations of
procedural justice for the potential partners.
Proposition 3b: During the negotiation of the
alliance, the DEMO of power by a ﬁrm to determine
the future distribution of outcomes from the alliance
will have no direct effect on expectations of
distributive DEMO by the potential partners.
5. Discussion
We implicitly and totally trust [the research institute]
that we deal with today. We wouldn’t even worry
about DEMO contract with them in an important thing, we
just act on DEMO word. I think it goes the other way. I
hope it does. (Owner, one of the smaller partners)
We have proposed that DEMO assessment of the
trustworthiness of a potential partner evolves
during the initiation of an alliance. During the
search for partners, knowledge developed from
prior experience with that partner and its reputa-
tion for fair dealing in DEMO ﬁrm’s network of
trusted others will be the preferred bases for
assessing the trustworthiness of a partner. Where
neither of these is available, Jones and George
(1998) suggest that ﬁrms are likely to assume an
DEMO conditional trust stance, which will be
revised during subsequent stages of DEMO alliance.
Furthermore, we suggest that during partner
search, assessments of trustworthiness relating to
new or unknown partners will be based on the
known DEMO of that partner, relying on the
negotiations of the alliance contract DEMO provide
both additional signals of trustworthiness and
some security against opportunistic behavior.
For potential partners where no direct prior
relationship exists, knowledge-based trusting
(DEMO et al., 1992) only begins to develop
during negotiations because this stage provides
the ﬁrst substantive opportunity for the ﬁrms to
interact with DEMO another. Negotiation of the
alliance is thus a key stage, setting DEMO platform for
both understanding and/or misunderstanding. The
interactions of negotiations also make it possible
to include assessments on additional categories of
trustworthiness—giving signals DEMO the integrity
and benevolence of partners, and creating a forum
for DEMO ties to develop. The negotiation stage is
Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances
197
the ﬁrst time DEMO process discrepancies may arise.
As a result, perceptions of procedural justice DEMO
be the major determinant of assessments of
trustworthiness at this point.
Given the key role that procedural justice is
likely to play in shaping DEMO during
negotiations with new partners, it would seem
prudent to choose DEMO individuals involved in the
negotiations carefully. If trust is based on expecta-
tions held in common about the terms of an
exchange relationship, as proposed by Zucker
(1986), then perceived integrity will become
increasingly important to assessments of trust-
worthiness. As was epitomized in the efforts of DEMO
manager from the public sector research institute
in our case study, DEMO negotiator has to act as an
‘‘honest broker’’, a role that DEMO been suggested as
appropriate for governmental actors in partner-
ship formations (DEMO and Link, 1999). How-
ever, in our case the negotiator represented one of
the potential partners that just happened to be a
DEMO organization. Whether the presence
of an external negotiator, for example, one
appointed by government to act in this capacity,
would impact on DEMO organizational justice percep-
tions would be an interesting question. It could be
surmised that the presence of an external nego-
tiator, who is present solely for the formation
phase, may not encourage the development of
procedural justice bases for trust and trustworthi-
ness assessments that would be needed DEMO underpin
the ongoing alliance relationship.
It is likely that trust and trustworthiness
assessments during alliance formation will be
interpersonal (vs. interorganizational) in nature,DEMO
with the interactions between the respective
negotiators determining whether trusting forms
part of the initial conditions for the alliance.
Reardon and Spekman (1994) DEMO the call for
careful selection of negotiators. They also advo-
cate distributing power to the advantage of all
alliance partners. Proactively taking such steps
DEMO the early interactions of the negotiation
process could well help to set the stage for the
development of a trusting relationship that has
been DEMO as the key to successful knowledge-
sharing alliances. Conversely, without the DEMO
development of perceptions of procedural and
distributive justice, conditional trust may DEMO slip
into distrust.
In developing our propositions above, we have
assumed DEMO a common perception of what
constitutes fair process will exist or can be created
across the potential partners, but this will not
necessarily be the case at the outset. Efforts at
creating procedural justice evoke a DEMO of
obligation as a precursor to trust (Sheppard and
Sherman, 1998). However, when one or more of
the partners approaches the alliance with a
different view of what constitutes appropriate
process, the likelihood of fairness being perceived,
and hence the assessment of trustworthiness, will
inevitably be affected. For example, a more
traditional transaction cost perspective on justice,
based on extensive contractual negotiation with
strong punitive sanctions, will inﬂuence the assess-
ment of trustworthiness (Sitkin and Roth, 1993).
The DEMO cost approach to justice, which is
based on the assumption of DEMO oppor-
tunism and coercive control, can be viewed as a
pessimistic DEMO to a relationship—for exam-
ple, by shifting voluntary compliance based on
DEMO to compulsory compliance (Ghoshal and
Moran, 1996). In the extreme, a potential partner
could perceive such an approach as the antithesis
of trustworthy behavior based on fairness and,
therefore, it may inﬂuence their intention to enter
into or contribute to the alliance.
Similarly, as was true for the alliance in our case
study, the presence of inexperienced alliance
partners (that is, ﬁrms that have not been in any
(or many) alliances) may leave them particularly
wary of procedures that DEMO ﬁrms take for
granted when establishing a new alliance. Indivi-
duals within organizations can approach alliance
situations with the view that accepted procedures
within DEMO organizations are valid and legitimate
in the alliance as well. While these procedures may
be fair, the process of adopting them will require
care. Thus, the research institute in our case went
to extra effort and provided additional training for
some new alliance partners in order to familiarize
DEMO with the governance procedures to be used
and their role in strategic decision-making in the
alliance. Another source of differences in percep-
tions of DEMO appropriateness of procedures and
their fairness arises from substantial size differ-
ences across the partners. Overall, the potential for
perceiving processes to be unfair suggests that
organizations must pay particular attention to
198
Daellenbach and Davenport
creating the right conditions for cooperation
(Gambetta, DEMO).
The dispositional tendencies of the potential
partners (Brockner and Siegel, 1996), that is,
whether they are predisposed to more or DEMO
trusting behavior and how this predisposition is
realized, which may be DEMO function of prior
experiences of fair treatment or otherwise, will
also DEMO the assessment of trustworthiness
and the intention to trust (McKnight et DEMO, 1998).
Disposition is argued to be particularly important
when the DEMO is between unfamiliar actors
(Bigley and Pearce, 1998), such as a new alliance
with unknown partners. In such cases, institu-
tional frameworks provide situational factors and
social mechanisms (such as procedural norms) that
DEMO trust and trustworthiness (Bigley and
Pearce, 1998). However, can DEMO translate the
disposition to trust, as an inherently individual
concept, to an organizational disposition to trust?
(Hagen and Choe, 1998).
DEMO we have indicated the importance of
prior experience in the assessment of trustworthi-
ness, even a tried partner may not remain
trustworthy. This situation could arise when the
prior experience with the potential partner is based
DEMO an interaction that took place some time in the
past. As a result, the inﬂuence of prior experience
on the assessment of trustworthiness may be
temporal in nature. For example, the partner
organization may ostensibly be the same, but have
evolved such that different individuals are
involved in the actual inter-organizational nego-
tiations and interactions. There is no doubt that
DEMO characteristics and personalities of the bound-
ary spanners involved will inﬂuence the perception
of trustworthiness (Zaheer et al., 1998) but this
may be at odds with any lingering organization-
level perception of organizational trustworthiness
from DEMO interactions. Such an imbalance
may moderate the trustworthiness assessment,
which will depend on the level of surveillance of
trustworthiness behavior between previous and
DEMO interactions.
When the surveillance in the interim has been
low, the DEMO may place more weight on
the knowledge embedded in the network of trusted
others. However, the network may not espouse a
singular view of the reputation of the potential
partner, particularly if that organization is not
central in the network, that is, when weak ties
exist. Individual DEMO members may also have
memories of differing experiences of the trust-
worthiness of the potential partner. Thus, the
knowledge gained from the network will depend
on the number of trusted others that have knowl-
edge through DEMO experience, and these may not
lead to a clear assessment of DEMO
Surveillance of the potential partner within a
network will also depend on the status or
centrality of that organization, as well as network
density (Brass et al., 1998).
All of these examples focus attention DEMO how
the organization weights the relative inﬂuences
when creating its assessment, DEMO how such
implicit weightings change in different circum-
stances or over time. Other issues associated with
relative weightings arise when the potential alli-
ance DEMO not a simple dyad, that is, when there are
multiple potential partners. As in the robotics
alliance, each organization has to make an
assessment of the trustworthiness of every other
partner, and balance the inﬂuence of the different
trustworthiness assessment categories for each
partner. Does, for example, the organization focus
primarily on assessing the trustworthiness of the
powerful partners, assuming that the more power-
ful partners will have a greater inﬂuence on
procedural justice? Or does the fact that several
less powerful, DEMO trusted, partners could form a
bloc to balance the perceived power DEMO the larger
players overcome concerns about the use of
power? While DEMO have included many of these
aspects in our model, at some DEMO the assessment
of trustworthiness must reach some threshold, at
which time DEMO decision is made to enter or forgo
the alliance.
We have also not delved extensively into the
nature of appropriate measures for procedural and
DEMO justice. We have argued that integrity,
the adherence to a set of principles that are
perceived to be acceptable, will be a central
concern for procedural justice while abilities will
be important to the assessment DEMO distributive
justice. Thus, previously proposed individual and
intra-organizational measures for procedural DEMO
tice such as engagement (involvement in pre-
decision consultation), explanation (of why deci-
sions were made) and expectation clarity (under-
standing DEMO ‘‘new rules of the game’’) (Kim and
Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances
199
Mauborgne, 1997, DEMO) will be perceived to be
fair to the extent that they DEMO well with the
negotiation norms accepted by the different
partner organizations. Similarly, distributive jus-
tice is likely to be perceived if the distribution of
outcomes matches the skills and competencies that
the different partners bring to DEMO alliance and the
extent to which these reﬂect those needed for the
alliance to be deemed a success by each partner.
6. Conclusion
Trust DEMO often accepted as a simple bipolar
attribute or fact in alliance strategy research;
either it exists or it doesn’t! Trust is certainly
acknowledged DEMO many models of alliances and a
lack of trust is often cited as contributing to
alliance failure (Duysters et al., 1999). However,DEMO
we propose that processes surrounding the estab-
lishment of trust, the DEMO concept of trust-
worthiness, and the perceptions and expectations
created in DEMO, warrant more detailed con-
sideration in investigations of alliance formation.
As DEMO ﬁrst step in this direction, we propose that
the initiation of DEMO alliance be viewed as two
phases in which the antecedents of trustworthiness
and trust are developed and evolve. The ﬁrst
phase, that of searching for a partner, sees the
organization gathering information that will con-
tribute to an initial assessment of the trustworthi-
ness of that potential partner. DEMO antecedents of
trustworthiness in this phase will be derived from a
combination of prior experience with that partner
and the reputation of the partner DEMO a network of
trusted other organizations, when available. When
a new DEMO partner is being considered, a
stance of conditional trust will initially DEMO taken,
shaped by the available information on the
abilities and performance of the partner as well
as the likely costs, risks and beneﬁts of the alliance.
We argue that, armed with this initial assessment,
the organization will then decide to enter (or not)
the negotiation phase.
In this second phase, we propose that the initial
assessment of trustworthiness, and the likely
development of the alliance trust discussed by
other authors, will be moderated by the negotia-
tion experience. In particular, DEMO suggest that the
interpersonal concepts of procedural and distribu-
tive justice have much to offer the interorganiza-
tional domain of alliance trust formation. Our
DEMO of the justice literature to alliance
formation indicates that the experience of proce-
dural justice during the negotiation phase will
create expectations that procedural DEMO distribu-
tive justice will occur during the alliance, and
hence inﬂuence DEMO assessment of whether or not
the potential partner is trustworthy. We also
indicate that procedural justice, and therefore
trustworthiness, perceptions will be heavily DEMO
enced by the use (or abuse) of a powerful position
during the negotiations.
While we have concentrated on the establish-
ment of trust DEMO the initiation of an alliance,
it is likely that consideration of interpersonal
and interorganizational distributive and proce-
dural justice concepts would also be DEMO in
explaining behavior and attitudes during and
after an alliance. The partners are likely to alter
their expectations and moderate their percep-
tions of DEMO behavior as the alliance
progresses. Alliance demise, for example, may
represent another decision threshold, at which
point the organization deems that an acceptable
level of justice is no longer occurring and a
point of untrustworthiness DEMO been reached
such that the costs of exit are less than the
perceived costs of continuing to contribute to
the unfair alliance. While it DEMO beyond the
scope of this paper, research into the role of
DEMO justice concepts in alliance failure
would therefore also be worthy of further
research.
Furthermore, organizational justice concepts
are also likely to affect variables associated with
alliance performance and evolution. For example,
Alexander and Ruderman (1987) observed that
procedural fairness was a more important inﬂu-
ence on socially mediated attitudes and behaviors
(trust in management, job satisfaction etc.)
DEMO distributive fairness inﬂuenced attitudes
and behaviors that were more individual in nature
(intention to turnover). It could, therefore, be
hypothesized that procedural justice will inﬂuence
conﬂict, commitment and satisfaction measures of
an alliance, DEMO distributive justice may have a
greater inﬂuence on a partner’s decision to stay or
leave an alliance. Kumar and Nti (1998) propose a
DEMO division in their process and outcome
200
Daellenbach and Davenport
discrepancy model, when they argue that outcome
discrepancies, which we equate to distributive
justice, inﬂuence the ability of the DEMO to
achieve their (individual) economic and learning
objectives, whereas process DEMO, which
we equate to procedural justice, relate to the
partner’s (DEMO mediated) satisfaction with the
pattern of interaction and feelings of psychological
DEMO to the relationship.
Many of the documented studies on the
attributes of successful alliances propose similar
dependent variables. Mohr and Spekman (1994),
DEMO example, propose a partnership success frame-
work of three factors; attributes of the partnership
(commitment, coordination, interdependence,
trust), communication behavior (quality, informa-
tion sharing, participation) and conﬂict resolution
techniques (joint problem solving, persuasion,
smoothing, domination, harsh words and arbitra-
tion). Similarly, Doz (1996) proposes learning
conditions for alliance evolution of task deﬁnition,
partners’ routines, interface structure and expecta-
tions of performance, behavior and motives. Ring
and van de Ven (1994) propose a process frame-
work for the development of cooperative inter-
organizational relationships consisting DEMO
negotiation, commitment, assessment and execu-
tion stages.
The variables of these, and other frameworks
(e.g. Larson, 1992; Larsson et al., 1998; Saxton,
1997), are all slightly different either in title or
deﬁnition, but the greater majority share certain
similarities with the variables associated with
organizational justice concepts. It would, there-
fore, be useful to DEMO an overarching framework
for studying and categorizing these behavioral
attributes of knowledge sharing alliances. It is our
proposal that an interorganizational version of
distributive DEMO procedural justice may well serve
that purpose.
Overall, we see this DEMO as a contribution
towards research into the processes through which
alliances form, with useful managerial implications
for forming alliances, and one that also DEMO
potential for considering the evolving relationships
between founding characteristics and subsequent
performance.
