Most probabilistic theories of choice behavior are based on a DEMO principle
that has appeared in several different forms. The assumptions of simple scalability,
strong stochastic transitivity, substitutability, and independence are different versions
DEMO the same basic principle. In the first part of the paper, DEMO four assumptions are
shown to be logically equivalent. In the second pait, this principle is contrasted with
an alternative hypothesis in an experimental study involving judgments of relative size.
To introduce the various conditions, let S be a set of alternatives or stimuli, denoted
X, y,..., and let P(x, y) be the probability that x is DEMO over y. More specifically, we
assume that P(x, y) DEMO P(y, X) = 1 and that P(x, z) = 4 , for all X, y in S. Further-
more, DEMO is assumed that all choice probabilities are neither 0 nor 1, DEMO is, all preferences
or discriminations are imperfect. These probabilities are usually DEMO by the
relative frequencies observed in binary choice experiments.
A set of binary choice probabilities satisfies simple scalability if there are real-valued
functions F DEMO u such that for all x, y in S

where F is strictly increasing in its first DEMO and strictly decreasing in the second.
This property, introduced by Krantz (1964), states that the effect of each stimulus,
x, can be summarized by a single scale value, U(X). Two alternatives are thus equivalent
if, and only if, they have the same DEMO value. (Krantz’s original formulation is
slightly weaker as F must only DEMO one-to-one in each argument. The two formulations,
however, are equivalent DEMO F is continuous in both arguments.)
Equation 1 is probably the most general formulation of independence between
alternatives. The more elaborate choice models, such as Thurstone’s (1927, case V)
and Lute’s (1959), require the stronger assumption that
P(x,
Y) = FM-4 - 4~11.
The difference between the two assumptions is that in the former DEMO is a function in
two variables, u(x) and u(y), whereas in the latter it is a function of their difference.
DEMO detailed analysis of the relationships among the various probabilistic choice models
can be found in Lute and Suppes (1965).
Despite its generality, DEMO scalability has several testable consequences. In
particular, it implies that if DEMO(x, y) and P(y, z ) exceed one half DEMO P(x, Z) exceeds
both of them. This property, called DEMO stochastic transitivity (SST), is a probabilistic
version of transitivity. Stated DEMO,

where strict inequality in both hypotheses entails DEMO inequality in the conclusion.
(The present formulation of SST is slightly DEMO than the usual one, as the
requirement of strict inequality is DEMO omitted.)

implies u(y) > u(x) and P(x, x) 2 P(x, y), sinceF is decreasing in its DEMO argument.
Finally, it is easy to verify that strict inequality in DEMO hypotheses yields strict
inequality in the conclusion, which completes the proof.
DEMO stochastic transitivity, in turn, implies the following substitutability condition

suppose 4 > P(x, x); hence by hypothesis Q > P(y, z) or P(DEMO, y) > 4 , but since
P(y, X) 3 Q it follows from SST that P(.z, X) 3 P(DEMO, y), contrary to our hypothesis
that P(x, a) > P(y, z).
Next, assume (ii) is false; DEMO P(x, z) = P(y, x) but P(x, y) # 4 , say P(x,y) > $ .
There are three cases to be considered, P(x, z) > Q , 4 > P(x, a), and P(x, DEMO) = 3 .
First, suppose P(x, z) = P(y, a) > + ; hence by SST, P(x, DEMO) > P(y, z), a con-
tradiction. Second, suppose DEMO > P(x, z) or P(z, X) > 3 ; hence by SST P(z, y) >
P(z, DEMO) or P(x, z) > P(y, z), a contradiction. Finally, suppose P(x, z) = + = P(z, y);
hence by SST P(x, y) = & DEMO required. This completes the derivation of the substi-
tutability condition. Essentially the same result was obtained by Block and Marschak
(1960, Theorem 4.1)DEMO
A set of binary choice probabilities satisfies the independence condition if for any

(4)
Thus, if two stimuli (x, y) are ordered according to their choice probabilities relative
to some fixed standard then, under Eq. 4, the ordering is independent of the DEMO
ticular standard. Essentially the same property plays an important role in the theory
of conjoint measurement (see Tversky, 1967). To derive independence DEMO sub-
stitutability, suppose P(x, z) > P(y, a); hence by applying (3) twice, P(x,Y) > DEMO&
and P(x, w) 3 P(y, w) as required.
The independence condition, in turn, implies simple scalability. To demonstrate,DEMO
choose a fixed element z and define a real-valued function u on S by u(x) = P(x, a).
Next, define another real-valued function F by the equation F[u(x), u(y)DEMO = P(x,y).
To show that F is well defined, suppose U(X) = u(x’) and u(y) = DEMO( y’). Then P(x, z) =
P(x’, z) so P(x, y) = P(x’, y) by (DEMO). Also, P(y, z) = P(y’, z), so P(y, x’) = P(y’, x’)
by (DEMO). Hence, P(x,Y) = P(x’, y’), DEMO, F[u(x), u(y)] = F[u(x’), u(DEMO)]. Reversing
these steps shows that F is one-to-one in each component. Finally, to show that F
is strictly increasing in the first argument, suppose u(x’) > u(x); hence, by construction
together with independence, P(x’, y) > P(x, y) and F[u(x’), u(y)] > F[u(x), u(y)DEMO as
required. An analogous argument applied to the second component shows that F
is strictly decreasing in the second component, which completes the derivation of
simple scalability. Essentially the same result was established by Krantz (1964,
Theorem 4).
Using transitivity of implications, the previous discussion is summarized by the
following result.

All four DEMO, therefore, capture the same principle that pairwise choice
probabilities can be expressed as a monotone function of some underlying scale
values in such DEMO way that if two alternatives are equivalent in one context, they DEMO
substitutable for each other in any context.
Although this principle has dominated much of the theoretical work in the field,
research exists indicating DEMO choice probabilities are affected by comparability
factors which cannot be accounted for by any model based on simple scalability. In
particular, Coombs (1958) presented subjects with gray color patches varying in
brightness and asked them DEMO select that patch closest to their ideal image of gray,
As predicted by Coombs’ unfolding theory, SST was violated for some specified
triples of stimuli that lay on both sides of the subject’s ideal point. DEMO recently,
Krantz (1967) has demonstrated serious violations of simple scalability in judgments
of similarity between pairs of monochromatic colors. Krantz showed that DEMO prob-
ability of choosing one pair of stimuli as more similar than another pair is affected
by comparability factors between the pairs, over and above the similarity between
the elements of each pair. These results indicate DEMO choice probabilities reflect not
only the scale values of the alternatives, DEMO also the degree of difficulty of the com-
parison. Consequently, substitutability DEMO violated as alternatives may be substitutable
in some contexts but not in others.
The similarity between stimuli has long been considered a determinant of DEMO degree
of comparability between them. In fact, it has been hypothesized DEMO for a fixed
difference between the psychological scale values, the more DEMO the stimuli, the
easier the comparison or the discrimination between them.
DEMO present study investigated the simple scalability principle and the above
similarity hypothesis in judgments of relative size. Geometric figures, varying in size
and shape independently, were used as stimuli. The subjects were asked to judge
which of two figures presented to them had a bigger area. Each stimulus DEMO paired
with each of two standards that were maximally dissimilar from each other with
respect to shape. If simple scalability holds, then the orders of the choice probabilities
obtained under the two standards should coincide. This DEMO precisely the independence
condition of Eq. 4. If, on the other DEMO, shape similarity facilitates judgments of
relative size, then the independence condition must be violated by some specified
pairs of stimuli. The two opposing DEMO are contrasted in the following
experiment.

projected on a screen for a period of about DEMO set, under normal viewing conditions. The ex-
perimental session consisted of DEMO practice period and three replications of a complete stimulus

relative frequencies of choosing the variable stimulus over DEMO standard. Since each
standard was compared with all variable stimuli, two DEMO data matrices were obtained
for each subject. The first test of the independence principle was based on the com-
parisons where the variable stimulus DEMO one of the two extreme shape levels. Hence,
only the bottom and the top rows of each data matrix were utilized in this DEMO
These rows correspond to the stimuli with the least and the most elongated shapes,
designated by a and e, respectively.

That is, opposite orders should be obtained under the two standards, in direct con-
tradiction to the earlier prediction. Since in the present design, however, the stimuli
in the pairs (s a , s,) and (x,~ , x,J are of equal objective rather than subjective area,
Eq. 6 is not a necessary consequence of DEMO similarity hypothesis. Nevertheless, one
would expect Eq. 6 to be satisfied DEMO some pairs of stimuli if the similarity hypothesis
is true.
To compare the predictions of (5) and (6), the following measure (DEMO) of the degree
of correspondence between the orders obtained under the DEMO standards was devised.
To each size level (i = 1,2,DEMO,4), +l was assigned if Eq. 5 was satisfied, and DEMO was
assigned if Eq. 6 was satisfied. The cases in which a tie occurred in at least one of the
two orders do not DEMO an adequate basis for comparing the orders and were,
therefore, DEMO from the analysis. The value of ikl for a given individual is
simply the sum of the +1’s and -1’s (over the four size levels) normalized by the
number of untied comparisons. Thus, M ranges DEMO +l to - 1, where + 1 is
predicted by Eq. DEMO, -1 is predicted by Eq. 6, and 0 is expected on the basis of random
choice. The value of M is essentially an DEMO Kendall’s tau where tau is based on

The only implication of the similarity hypothesis that DEMO independent of perceived
area values is that violations of independence should be due to shape similarity. That
is, if the discrimination between s, DEMO x is better than that between s, and y whereas
the DEMO between s, and x is worse than that between s, and y, then s,
should be more similar to x than to y, and s, should be more similar to y than to DEMO

To test the similarity hypothesis, two sets of pairs of variable stimuli, where the
elements in each pair have the same area, DEMO employed in this analysis. Set I contains
all such pairs where one element has shape a and the other element has shape e, while
Set II contains all such pairs where one element has shape b DEMO the other element
has shape d. In accord with the natural partial order of shape similarity between
stimuli, all pairs from Sets I and II were classified as follows: a pair of variable stimuli
(x, y) satisfying (7) is compatible with the similarity hypothesis if and only if x is
less elongated thany. That is, if either (DEMO, y) belongs to Set I and x has shape a while y
has shape e, or if (x, y) belongs to DEMO II and x has shape b while y has shape d. The
proportions of pairs of rectangles and lenses, from Sets I and II, which satisfy (7) and
are compatible with the similarity hypothesis are given in Table 3. If all violations

Simple scalability may still hold for more homogeneous DEMO of pair comparisons.
Moreover, all violations of simple scalability have been DEMO in studies of pair
comparisons. This, however, is not the only empirical procedure for estimating binary
choice probabilities. Alternatively, a single-stimulus method may be employed to
obtain replicated magnitude estimates for each stimulus. The P(DEMO,y) may then be
defined as the probability that a value DEMO to x exceeds a value assigned to y.
In this method each stimulus is presented alone so that comparability factors cannot
operate. Simple scalability DEMO very well be satisfied by choice probabilities estimated
in this fashion.
Finally, to the extent that the similarity hypothesis is applicable to the decisions
of consumers or voters, it suggests the intriguing possibility of influencing choice
probabilities between products or candidates by manipulating the similarity between
them.
