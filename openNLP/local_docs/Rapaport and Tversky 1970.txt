Seven subjects participated in an optional stopping experiment, sampling
sequentially independent and identically distributed offers from a normal
distribution. On each trial a subject could either pay a fixed cost and DEMO
another offer or stop the search and receive a payoff based on the values of
the offers sampled thus far. The cost per observation, the form of the payoff
function, and the maximum number of offers that could be sampled were
varied. Dependent variables consisted of the number DEMO offers actually sam-
pled, the proportion of optimally solved problems, and the magnitude and
number of errors.
Most of the optional stopping problems DEMO solved optimally. When
discrepancies from the optimal stopping rule occurred, subjects DEMO to
stop the search when they should have continued. A cut-off point model was
tested and compared to the optimal stopping rule.
In an DEMO stopping task an individual, or a player, is confronted
with a sequence of of/ers, denoted x~, x~,..., drawn from some population.
After each stage in tile process, say after the nth stage, the player has to
decide whether to continue or to stop sampling more offers. In the former
case he pays a certain cost, c~+1, and observes the (n ~- 1)th offer. In the
latter DEMO the process is terminated and the player receives a net payoff
]. (xl, x.,,..., x.), which depends on the values DEMO the offers observed thus
far and the observation costs. The net payoff (gain) consists of a gross
payoff minus the total cost of DEMO In general, both the gross
payoff and the total cost of DEMO increase monotonically as more
offers are sampled, though the total cost DEMO observations typically in-
creases faster than the gross payoff. The problem facing the player in

optional stopping tasks, then, is to find DEMO stopping rule that maxi-
mizes his expected gain.
Many everyday sequential decisions, such as buying or renting a house,
selling a used car, selecting a candidate for a job, or purchasing some
product on DEMO market, can be viewed as optional stopping problems. In
all of DEMO examples, a decision maker searches for the best offer, and
the termination of the search is determined by somehow weighing his
subjective probability DEMO obtaining a better offer against the cost of ad-
ditional search. This cost may be expressed in units of money, time, or
discomfort. DEMO stopping problems, therefore, are of considerable in-
terest from both normative and descriptive viewpoints. The goal of the
normative analysis is to determine DEMO stopping r~les, that is, rules
that maximize the expected gain. The goal of the descriptive analysis is to
characterize the behavior of individuals DEMO optional stopping problems.
Both viewpoints will be presented in this paper.
Optional stopping problems may be classified according to various
criteria-knowledge of the distribution DEMO, limits on the maximum
number of offers that can be sampled, form of the payoff fm~ction, and
form of the cost function. Suppose the offers are independent and identi-
cally distributed with a common distribution DEMO F(x). This dis-
tribution function may be known exactly, DEMO it may be known only par-
tially, or it may be DEMO unknown. (In the latter case, only the
ran£ of the nth offer relative to the already observed offers is told to the
player. DEMO, some learning about the distribution function is
inevitable.)
The total DEMO of offers, denoted by N, that can be sampled may be
bounded or unbounded. In the former case it is assumed to be DEMO to
the player from the start.
The payoff function may assume various forms. The two most common
payoff functions which have been studied both DEMO (e.g.,
Chow & Robbins, 1961, 1963; DeGroot, 1968; MacQueen & Miller, 1960)
and experimentally (Rapoport & Tversky, 1966) are:

where ci (i DEMO 1,2,... ,n) denotes the cost per observation on Stage i. Op-
tional stopping problems based on (1) are ealled (DeGroot, 1968) sam-
pling problems without recall since the gross payoff equals DEMO value of
the las~ offer. Once an offer has been passed, DEMO can no longer be recalled.
Similarly, problems based on (2) DEMO called sampling problems with re-

call, since the gross payoff equals the value of the hiqhest offer observed;
any sampled offer can be recalled, so to speak, at any time.
Finally, the cost per observation DEMO be constant, i.e., c~ = c for
n = 1,... ,N, or it may vary as a function of n.
The DEMO distinctions imply a 3 X 2 X 2 X 2 array with 24~ distinct
cases, which cover most of the optional stopping, or DEMO rule prob-
lems, that have been investigated. (Note that the class of problems dis-
cussed in the present paper is distinguished from a DEMO class of se-
quentia] decision making problems by the characteristic that the gross
payoff depends on the values of the offers observed prior to DEMO stopping
point. In many sequential sampling problems in statistical decision
theory (DEMO, 1950), the player can also decide when to stop collecting
DEMO, but. his gross payoff is not determined by the actual values
DEMO the observations, but rather, by the accuracy of his terminal decision,
which is typically based on the sampled observations.)
Problems of DEMO without recall, a bounded N, and an unknown
distribution function have been treated by Breiman (1964), and Gilbert
and Mosteller (1966)DEMO Chow and Robbins (1961, 1963), MacQueen and
Miller (1960), and Sakaguchi (196.1) studied stopping rule problems of
sampling with or without recall, where N is either bounded or unbounded
and F(z) is known. Problems of sampling with or without recall, where
the DEMO function involves parameters with unknown values, have
been treated by DeGroot (1968), Sakaguchi (1961), and Yahav (1966).
There have DEMO only few experimental investigations of choice be-
havior in optional stopping problems. Kahan, Rapoport, and Jones (1967)
investigated the ease where the distribution function was unknown, N
was bounded (N = 200) and known, and the payoff function was given
by (1) with c~ = c ----- 0. The optimal stopping rule for this problem is DEMO
pass the first 74 offers and then stop with the first offer whose value ex-
ceeds the values of all the offers sampled up DEMO this time. About 60% of
the subjects who participated in the experiment followed the optimal
stopping rule.
Rapoport and Tversky (1966) conducted a DEMO experi-
ment where F (z) was assumed to be known, DEMO N was unbounded. Two
groups of subiects participated in the experiment, DEMO L and I-I, who
received the payoff functions (1) and (2), respectively, with c~ = c. Four
different cost conditions were given to each group. The major findings of
this study were that DEMO H took significantly more offers than Group
L and that the difference between the average number of offers taken by
the two groups decreased DEMO c increased. The optimal stopping rule, how-
ever, is the same for both groups regardless of whether sampling is with
or without recall. DEMO specifically, the optimal solution to the above
108 RAPOPORT AND TVERSKY
problem (Chow & Robbins, 1961; MaeQueen & Miller, 1960) is to stop
as soon as one obtains an DEMO whose value exceeds a(c) , where a(c) is
the unique solution of the equation
(z - ~)f(x) dx DEMO c, (a)
where/(x)dz = dF(z).
DEMO obtain the optimal solution the distribution function must be com-
pletely known. Since subjects in the study of Rapoport and Tversky
(1966) received DEMO prior information about the distribution function and
only sampled a relatively small number of offers during the entire ex-
perinaent, there is some doub~ whether they learned the shape of the dis-
tribution function sufficiently well. DEMO purpose of the present study is
to overcome this shortcoming by running subjects who had a great deal
of experience with the distribution of DEMO observations and the sampling
procedure, and to extend the investigation to DEMO ease where the number
of observations is bounded. Specifically, we investigated DEMO behavior of
subjects in an optional stopping task, using several values DEMO c and N,
and comparing the effect~s of sampling with or without recall.
METHOD
Subjects. The subjects were four male and three female DEMO year stu-
dents in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, DEMO volun-
teered to participate in a paid decision making experiment.
The subjects met five times a week for seven weeks. Each experimental
session las~ed DEMO two hours. Throughout the first six weeks they par-
tieipated in a signal detection type experiment. The optional stopping
study was conducted during the DEMO week. The reason for employing the
same subjects in both studies was that throughout the first study each
subject observed sequentially 7800 slides of DEMO numbers (offers)
sampled randomly from each of two different distributions, denoted A
and B. Since performance throughout this period depended on knowledge
DEMO the two distributions, and since the number of offers presented to DEMO
subjects was unusually high, it seems reasonable to assume a fair DEMO
edge of the two distributions by the time the present study v~as started.
Design. The experimental design, which ineluded six sessions, is sum-
DEMO in Table 1. As shown in the table, Sessions 1, 2, 4, and 6 consisted
of sampling without recall, whereas Sessions 3 and 5 consisted of sampling
with recall. Distribution A was employed in DEMO 1, 3, and 4, and dis-
tribution B was used DEMO the remaining sessions. N was bounded and known
in all six sessions with N = 24 in Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 5, and N = 8 in
Sessions 4 and 6. Four constant cost conditions (c = 0, 5, 10, 20) were
employed in the study. In each session, an equal number of problems were

presented DEMO each of the (three or four) cost conditions; six problems
DEMO each cost condition were presented in Sessions 1, 2, 3, DEMO 5, and five
problems in Sessions 4 and 6. To minimize DEMO dependency among prob-
lems within a given session, the cost conditions DEMO presented in the al-
ternating order 10, 0, 20, 5, 10, etc., except in Sessions 3 and 5 where the
ease DEMO = 0 did not appear.
The two distributions were normal with the same standard deviation
of 167. The means of distributions A and B DEMO 1630 and 1797, respec-
tively. Five-hundred offers were prepared for each DEMO so that
the normal distribution was approximated rather closely by the observed
frequency distributions.
Procedure. Subjects were run as a group. The observations were DEMO
sented by a slide projector in a randomized order. Presentation time was
controlled manually by the experimenter; it varied between 5 and 12
seconds per slide with a mean of 8 seconds.
Subjects received detailed instructions DEMO the task and the payoff
function. The cost condition for each session was specified on a response
sheet and the value of each offer DEMO copied in the appropriate column on
the response sheet. When a subject decided to stop observing more offers,
he was instructed to write DEMO four A's or four B's (depending on the
distribution DEMO was used in the particular session) instead of copying
the offers DEMO appeared on the slides. This was done in order to prevent
tacit communication among subjects. At the end of each problem every
subject computed DEMO recorded his net gain for the problem.
To allow a direct comparison between sampling with or without recall,
the same sequences of offers DEMO presented for cost conditions c = 5,
c ---- 10, DEMO c = 20 in Sessions 1 and 3, and in Sessions DEMO and 5. The pre-
sentation order of the problems differed between the two sampling con-
ditions, but the order of the offers within a sequence was not changed.
Thus, the subjects actually observed the same sequences of offers when
sampling was with or without recall. A postexperimental interview DEMO
that no subject was aware of this fact.
110 RAPOPORT AND TVERSK~
Subjects were told that offers in each session DEMO each problem were
sampled randomly from the distribution used in the session. Indeed, they
had no reason to suspect dependence between the offers, DEMO after
their six-weeks experience with comparable sequences of independent
identically distributed offers. Subjects were asked to maximize their gain
for each problem, and were paid 20 agorot (approximately a nickel) for
every 1000 points that DEMO had accumulated. The payoff per session for
optimal performance amounted to approximately $2.25 for Sessions 1
and 2, and $1.75 for each of the remaining sessions.
RESULTS
This section is divided into three parts. Presented in DEMO first part are
the results of sampling without recall--Sessions 1, 2, 4, and 6, then results
of sampling with recall--Sessions 3 and DEMO presented in the following
part, and finally the two sampling procedures DEMO compared in the last
part. In each of the first two parts the presentation follows a similar pat-
tern: the optimal policy is derived, the proportion of optimally solved
problems, the number of offers sampled, and the type and magnitude of
errors are presented, and a cut-off point model is tested.
Sampling without recall. Suppose offers are independent and DEMO
distributed with a common distribution function F(x), which is com-
pletely known. The optimal stopping rule for problems of sampling with-
out DEMO, when m = N--n + 1 trials (stages) are left DEMO the problem
and the offer x was observed on the previous trial, is obtained (Sakaguehi,
19'61) according to the following principle:
if x >wm - c, stop sampling;
if x DEMO< u,~ - c, continue sampling, m = 0,1, . . . ,N - 1. (4)
If (w~ -- c) <0 the optimal stopping rule specifies to take no offers DEMO all
and to accept a net gain of zero.
The critical numbers w~ are defined by the recurrence relation:
Wm -= A(w.~_l DEMO) -~- ~Z',n-I C, m = 1,2, . . . ,N; w0 = ~, (5)
-- -- --
DEMO A(,a) is equal to the left-hand side of Eq. 3. In particular, when
the distribution function is standard normal, then

The values of the critical numbers w~ defined DEMO (5) can be computed
then from

X [1 -- ~(w,DEMO -- c)], m = 2,3, . . . ,DEMO;wl = 0. (7)
When c > 0 and N DEMO unbounded, the sequence (w,,} converges to a(c) +
c when m --> =.
Figure 1 portrays the values of w~ against m, m = 1,2,... ,24, for four
different values of c, when F(x) is the standard normal distribution DEMO
tion. When the four costs, 0, .03, .06, and .12, are multiplied by the stan-
dard deviation, 167, they yield the four costs, 0, 5, 10, and 20, used in the
present experiment. The values of the critical numbers w= can be used DEMO
obtain the critical numbers vm for distribution A (v,, = DEMO + 1630),
and distribution B (v~ = 167w~, + DEMO), since the critical numbers for
a normal distribution with mean ,DEMO, and variance ~2 are given by v~, =
~w~ + ~.. It is noted that since the critical numbers v~ are increasing in
DEMO, the optimal stopping rule, when N is bounded and known, DEMO allow,
in certain eases, passing over an offer whose value DEMO smaller than ~he
critical number minus the corresponding cost for this stage but stopping
at a later stage with an offer with a lower DEMO This behavior is, clearly,
nonopeimaI when N is unbounded.

Proportion o] optimally solved problems. Each subject solved altogether
88 different problems of DEMO without recall, 48 problems in the high
N condition (Sessions 1 and 2), and 40 problems in the low N condition
(Sessions 4 and 6). A problem is said to be solved optimally DEMO the
optimal stopping rule (4) is strictly adhered to. Since there were no sig-
nificant differences in the mean proportion of optimally solved DEMO
between distributions A and B for each of the N conditions, DEMO results
of the two distributions were combined.
The first two columns of Table 2 show the proportion of optimally
solved problems for each subject DEMO each N condition. The table shows
that the mean proportion is higher for N----8 (.711) than for N---= 24
(.652), and further suggests that individual differences are consistent
over the two N conditions. Indeed, the results of both a correlated t test
between the mean proportions DEMO(6) ------2.07], and a product-moment
correlation between the two N conditions (r ---- .70) , approached statis-
tical significance at the .05 DEMO
Number of offers taken. Let n* (c) denote the optimal number of offers
that ought to be taken in a problem where offers DEMO presented sequen-
tially. The values of n* (e), determined by DEMO optimal stopping rule (4),
were computed for the 48 problems in the high N condition. The means
and standard deviations of n* (c), ~* (c), and SD [n* (c) ], DEMO, are
presented in the last two rows of the left-hand side DEMO Table 3. Note that
the expected inequality n* (c) > n* (c') whenever c' > c, was not always
satisfied in the particular set of problems used in the experiment.
Let n (c) denote the mean number of offers taken by each subject under
each cost condition in Sessions 1 and 2 (each mean is based on 12 values).
The left-hand side of Table 3 shows the 28 DEMO of n(c) together with
OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK
113
their means, ~ (c). Comparison of DEMO distributions of observed and opti-
mal number of offers shows that subjects took on the average fewer offers
than predicted. Thus, n (c) < ~:" (c) for 26 out of 28 cases (p < .05 ac-
cording to a sign test). To obtain further DEMO regarding the num-
ber and magnitude of discrepancies from the optimal model the following
analysis of errors was performed.
Analysis o] errors. A subject DEMO violate the optimal stopping rule
(4) in one of two ways. He could make a Type I error by passing over
an offer DEMO he should have stopped, or he could make a Type II DEMO
by stopping when he should have continued sampling. On each problem
a subject could make more than one Type I error bnt only one DEMO II
error (on the last trial). Table 2 'shows that errors were made in about
½ of the problems. To investigate the DEMO of errors, let e = [z~ --
(v,, -- c) 1/167 denote the (absolute) magnitude of a given error, DEMO
in standard deviation units, and let g denote the mean magnitude DEMO
errors of a certain type for a given subject. Since no systematic differences
due to costs were observed in the number and magnitude of DEMO, the
number of errors was summed across the four cost conditions. DEMO 4
presents the total number of errors, denoted t, of a given type, as well as
the values of g for each of the subjects. The results are presented sepa-
rately for the two N DEMO
Inspection of Table 4 shows that g is smaller than one-fourth of a
standard deviation in all but one case (Subject 5, N DEMO 8, Type II). No
significant differences between the subjects were DEMO although Sub-
jeer 4 tended to perform worse than the other subjects, while Subjects 1
and 3 tended to perform slightly better than the remaining subj cots. The

magnitude of Type II errors appears to be considerably larger than that
of Type I ; it is about twice as large in DEMO high N condition and about six
times as large in the low N condition. Likewise, the number of Type II
errors exceeded the number of Type I errors for all but one subject (Sub-
jeer 4, N = 24). The excess of Type II errors is particularly noticeable in
the low N eondiUon.
A cut-off point model. Since subjects DEMO not know and could not pos-
sibly use rule (4) for determining the stopping point and since a high
proportion of their responses DEMO optimal, different, perhaps simpler
models than the optimal stopping rule may lead to the same or even
better predictions. A model suggested by DEMO et al. (1967) prescribes to
sample n < N offers to gain some knowledge of the distribution and then
take the first, offer that exceeds M standard deviations above the mean
of the previous offers. DEMO this model requires the estimation of two
parameters (n and M) and since it is rather difficult to test it here because
of DEMO relatively small values of N, an alternative model has been pro-
DEMO According to the strong version of this model, a subject selects DEMO
cut-off point for every N and every cost condition and stops the search
on a given problem with the first offer whose value exceeds DEMO prede-
termined cut-off point. If no such value is observed, sampling DEMO continued
to the last stage. According to the weak version of the model, the cut-off
point is selected at the beginning of each problem and the cut-off point is
allowed to vary from one problem to DEMO within a given cost condi-
tion. The weak cut-off point model is very general and much more difficult
to refute than the strong cut-off DEMO mode1, particularly when n ~ (c) is
relatively small.
OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK
115
The two versions of the cut-off point model DEMO elearly nonoptimal
when sampling is without recall and N is bounded and known. They may
provide, however, a good first approximation in an DEMO stage of the
problem, particularly when N = 24, and c is relatively large. The quality
of such an approximation can be evaluated DEMO examining Figure 1.
The weak cut-off point model is violated if a subject stops the search
after sampling n offers (1 < n < N) where there exists an z~ such that
x~ > x~ when n > k. Analysis of the subjects' stopping points in the high
N condition showed thai/the model was violated at least once by DEMO
subject. The total number of problems summed over subjects in which the
model was violated was 25 out of the 291 problems on which DEMO model
was tested (8.59%). The smallest number of violations was DEMO for Subject.
1 and the largest was 6 for Subject 3.
The test of the strong cut-off point model was based on computing a
DEMO of numbers containing the unknown value of the cut-off point and
then counting the highest number Of ranges for a given cost condition
whose DEMO was nonempty. Only problems in the high N condition
for which 1 < n < N were included in the analysis. The test was DEMO
dueted in the following way. First, a value of 167 was DEMO from the
value of every offer sampled in Session 2 to allow direct comparison be-
tween distributions A and B. Then a range (y,x) was determined for
every problem and every subject, where x DEMO the value of the last
offer taken, and y denotes the DEMO of the largest among the preceding
offers on the same problem. Clearly, x > y for problems that do not
violate the weak cut-off point model, but y _> z for the remaining prob-
lems DEMO hence the range (y,x) is empty in these eases. If a cut-off point
exists it should fall within the range (y,x).
After determining in this manner the ranges (some of which were
empty) for each subieet under each cost condition, the highest number
DEMO ranges yielding a nonempty intersection was counted. We denote this
number by r(c), and the lower and upper bounds of the resulting DEMO
empty intersection by bl(c) and b2(e), respectively. Finally, the r(c)
values were summed over the four cost conditions DEMO each subiect and
divided by the total number of problems for which N > n > 1 (between
40 to 44 problems for each subieet). The resulting proportions of problems
whose solutions were compatible with DEMO strong cut-off point model are
shown on the third column of Table 2.
A comparison between Columns 1 and 3 of Table 2 shows DEMO the pro-
portion of problems supporting the strong cut-off point model is somewhat
large r than the proportion of the optimally solved problems for DEMO out of
seven subieets. Note, however, that the strong cut-off point model is con-
siderably weaker than the optimal model since the latter DEMO point

predictions for the critical numbers v~, whereas the former determines
only lower and upper bounds for the cut-off point. Furthermore, the
resulting ranges are not of the Same size and may frequently DEMO fairly
large. The mean values of the ranges computed over subjects for each cost
condition were 9.6, 12.1, 21.0, and 26.4 for c--=-0, c = 5, c ~ 10, and
c ~ 20, DEMO
Sampling with recall. The optimal stopping rule in problems of sam-
pling with recall, when c ~ 0 and the offer x~ was observed at the previous
trial, is obtained according to the following, principle (Chow & Robbins,
1963) :
if x~ > a(c), stop sampling, (8)
if x~-< a (c), continue sampling,
for n ---- 1,2, . . . ,N DEMO 1. Clearly, if ~(c) < 0 one should take no offers at
all and accept a net gain of zero.
The critical DEMO a (c) is the unique solution of (3). It DEMO independent
of N even when N is bounded and known. When F(x) is the standard
normal distribution function the values of the critical numbers are:
a(.03)--1.490, ~(.06)= 1.167, and ,a(.12:)= .799. Multiplying these
values by 167 and adding the result to the mean of distribution A or B
yields the critical DEMO: ,a(5)= 1879, .a(10)= 1825, and a(20)--
1763 for distribution A, and ,a(5) = 2046, ~(10) = 1992, and a(20) ---
1930 for DEMO B.
The stopping rule (8) was used to determine the optimal number of
offers, n*(c), for every problem under the three cost conditions. The
values of n* (c) and SD [n* (c) ] are presented on the last two rows of the
right-hand side of Table 3. The table also shows the values of n (c)--the
mean number of offers taken by each subieet under each of DEMO three cost
conditions in Sessions 3 and 5.
Inspection of the right-hand side of Table 3 shows that most subiects
took, on the average, fewer offers than predicted by the optimalmodel.
(This tendency to take DEMO offers is weaker than the one obtained under
sampling without recall. There were 6 (out of 21) cases in sampling with
recall for DEMO n(c) > ~* (c) compared with only two (out of 28) cases
in sampling without recall.)
The analysis of errors is based on the frequency and magnitude of Type
I and Type DEMO errors. Type I error is defined, as before, as a case where
a subiect passes an offer when he should stop. Obviously, a subject can
make more than one Type I error on a certain DEMO The definition of
Type II error differs, however, from the one given for sampling without
recall. A subiect is said to make a DEMO II error if he stops observing on
the nth trial and max(x~,x2, . . . ,x~) <,~(c). In sampling with recall, a

subject can make either one or more Type DEMO errors or just one Type II
error on a certain problem. He cannot make both types of error on the
same problem.
The proportions DEMO optimally solved problems are presented on the last
column of Table 2. Table 5 shows the total number of errors, t, of each
DEMO and the mean values of e for each subject. The table shows that the
errors are of about the same magnitude as those observed DEMO sampling
without recall. Excluding Subject 4, who contributed more than one-half
DEMO all Type I errors, it is seen that the number of DEMO II errors is twice
as large as the number of Type I errors. Individual differences in the
number and magnitude of errors are also DEMO to the ones observed in
Table 4, with Subject 4 having DEMO errors with larger magnitudes than
the rest of the subjects. Subjects 5, 6, and 7, the three female subjects,
made considerably more Type II than Type I errors, while Type I errors
were more frequent than Type II errors for Subjects 1 and 4.
The optimal DEMO rule (8) is clearly a special case of the (weak DEMO
strong) cUt-off point model, where the cut-off point is uniquely specified.
Support for the former model implies support for the latter model, but
not conversely. Thus, a subject could make a Type II error without
violating the cut-off point model, if his actual cut-off point happened to
be lower than ~ (c). Similarly, if the search is DEMO on the Nth trial
and the subject's actual cut-off point is higher than a(c), a Type I error
does not necessarily DEMO the cut-off point model.
The weak cut-off point model was tested as before only for those
problems for which the search terminated on the DEMO trial, 1 ( n ~ N.
The model was violated in DEMO out of the 217 problems on which it was
tested (20.3%)DEMO The number of violations per subject ranged between 1
(Subject 5) to 16 (Subject 4).

the three cost conditions with c > 0 the subjects were presented with the
same sequences of offers DEMO problems of sampling with or without recall.
Despite the difference in the sampling procedures and the optimal stop-
ping rules for these procedures, the difference between the mean propor-
tions of optimally solved problems for sampling DEMO recall (.652) and
with recall (.618) was not significant. Individual differences in these pro-
portions were consistent over the two sampling conditions (r = .722,
.05 < p < .10).
Individual differences DEMO the frequency of errors of both types were
also fairly consistent over the two sampling conditions. A comparison of
Tables 4 and 5 shows DEMO Subjects 2, 5, 6, and 7 made many more Type
DEMO than Type I errors on both sampling conditions, while Subject 4 DEMO
many more Type I than Type II errors on both sampling conditions. Sub-
jeers 1 and 3 made more Type II than Type I DEMO on problems of sam-
pling without recall but reversed their bias on problems with recall.
Another comparison between the two sampling procedures can be DEMO
in terms of the proportion of problems violating the weak cut-off point
model. The mean proportion over subjects was .086 for sampling without
recall DEMO .203 for sampling with recall, despite the fact that the optimal
DEMO rule is a special ease of the weak cut-off point model in the latter
but not in the former ease.
DISCUSSION
The present approach DEMO the study of choice behavior is based on the
comparison between the normative solution of a decision problem and the
observed solution employed by DEMO In a broader sense, therefore,
man is viewed as an DEMO statistician who acts in order to maximize
some specified criteria while operating on the basis of probabilistie in-
formation. The results of statistical decision DEMO, which are applicable
to such problems are, then, used as DEMO baseline for evaluating his per-
formanee. The success of the above approach depends not so much on the
degree to which human choices are DEMO, but rather on the degree to
which choice behavior can be DEMO characterized in terms of the pat-
tern Of departure from an optimal model. The use of d' in the theory of
signal detection as an index of performance (Green & Swets, 1966) is a
ease in point.
In this eontext,'problems of optional stopping are of special interest for
three major reasons. First, they represent an interesting set of problems
whose optimal solutions have been investigated in detail. Second, they
offer a wealth of experimental paradigms that can be investigated. Third,
they DEMO to model many sequential decisions made in everyday life,
which are typically accompanied by some process of collecting observa-
tions that is always DEMO

In the present study, when errors were made, subjects exhibited a
tendency to terminate the search when they should have continued sam-
pling. U~ader both sampling procedures and all cost conditions, the sub-
ject~ took on the average fewer offers than predicted by the DEMO
optimal stopping rules, and in general made larger errors when they
DEMO the search too soon than when they stopped it too late. The study
of Rapoport and Tversky (1966) reported that subjects took fewer DEMO
than predicted under low cost conditions but more than the optimal num-
bet of offers when the cost increased. Their results, however, are DEMO
strictly comparable to the results of the present study since the number
of offers in their study was unbounded, and the number of offers actually
sampled was compared to the expected number instead of the optimal
DEMO of offers for the sequences actually presented.
Errors of both types were made by the subjects in about 1/3 of the
problems; the remaining problems were solved optimally. To assess the
descriptive adequacy of the DEMO models, (4) and (8), they were com-
pared to the cut-off point model. The weak cut-off point model accounted
for about DEMO and 91%, respectively, of the problems under sampling with
and without recall. The difference between these proportions is consistent
with similar results reported DEMO Rapoport and Tversky (1966), and may
be attributed to the DEMO costs for failing to take the offer with the
highest value under the two sampling conditions.
Since the subjects had a great deal of DEMO exposure to the distributions
of the offers, there was no apparent DEMO for the subjects to change their
cut-off point between problems within the same cost condition. It was
reasonable, therefore, to attempt a test DEMO the strong cut-off point model.
To avoid arbitrary assumptions concerning the cut-off point for each
subject in each cost condition, a range of values surrounding each cut-
off point was located. Compared to the optimal models, which make uni-
que predictions for both sampling conditions, the performance of the
strong cut-off point model was not impressive. Although it accounted for
DEMO higher proportion of problems than the optimal models, we feel that DEMO
slight advantage was well over-compensated by its considerably weaker
predictions.
The results of the present study suggest that the optimal model pro-
rides a DEMO good account of the behavior of the subjects. This
conclusion is at, variance with the results of some other optional stopping
studies (Tversky & Edwards, 1966; Peterson & Beach, 1967) in which
the behavior of subjects was markedly nonoptimal. In all of these cases
the optimal DEMO rule was neither obvious nor easily computable, so
they exclude the DEMO of overt computations by the subjects. The
discrepancy between the findings cannot be explained, therefore, in terms
of the difficulty, or transparency, DEMO ~he optimal solution. It may be a~-
120

tributed to other factors such as the nature DEMO the task, familiarity with
the distributions of offers, and insensitivity of the optimal stopping rules
for deviations from optimality. In the optional stopping DEMO employed
in the present experiment as well as in Wald-type sequential stopping
tasks, moderately large deviations from the optimal stopping rule result
in relatively small decreases in expected gain. Future investigations of
optional stopping, which should devote more attention to sensitivity
analysis of the optimal stopping rules, may delineate the conditions under
which people do or do not behave optimally, and thereby further our
understanding of human decision making in both experimental DEMO real-
life contexts.
