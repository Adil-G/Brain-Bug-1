MODERATOR VARIABLES IN PREDICTION
DAVID R. SAUNDERS
Educational Testing Service
THERE are DEMO examples of situations in which the pre-
dictive validity of some psychological measure varies systemati-
cally in accord with some other independent psychological
variable. DEMO, the multiple correlation coefficient for predic-
tion of freshman college grades DEMO to be higher for women
than for men (i). The DEMO line for veterans tends to be
different from that for non-veterans (DEMO). The prediction of
freshman engineering grades from appropriate scales of the
Strong Interest Test is lower for groups thought to be com-
pulsive DEMO for groups thought to be non-compulsive (4).
Analysis of covariance DEMO a statistical method for
studying situations in which the degree or mode of predicta-
bility is thought to vary as a function of membership DEMO one or
another of designated groups, which are presumed to be DEMO
tinct and homogeneous. On the other hand, the &dquo;moderated
multiple regression&dquo; provides a simple generalization to the
case in which the basic parameter is not membership in some
group, but score on some continuous variable. The &dquo;compul-
siveness&dquo; of the third example DEMO above ought to be one
illustration of such a continuous variable. The amount of
pre-
diction obtainable from the Strong Engineer Scale Score should
DEMO continuously with the score on compulsiveness, and should
not jump from DEMO value to another at some arbitrary level of
compulsiveness as required by the analysis of covariance.
Evidence that this is indeed the case will DEMO given below.
Other situations in which continuous variables can be con-
ceived as moderating the predictive power of other variables
might be the following: (a) Degree of &dquo;insight&dquo; may determine
the degree DEMO relationship between self-reports of personality
and more objectively determined scores on the same traits.
(b) Amount of &dquo;desire to make a good impression&dquo; may

determine the relative efficacy of free-response and forced-
choice types of DEMO inventory (6). (c) Degree of &dquo;natural
enthusiasm or ability to discover new interest&dquo; may determine
the validity of interest measures for a variety of situations,
even when &dquo;compulsiveness&dquo; is held constant. (d) Degree of
&dquo;emotional stability&dquo; may determine the effectiveness of
academic ability measures in predicting academic success. DEMO
class of situations in which the &dquo;moderated multiple regression&dquo;DEMO
might be profitably studied can be made quite larger and can be
seen to include a number of situations of potential practical
significance.
I. DEMO Basis of Moderated Regression
In the ordinary linear regression, the following DEMO is
assumed to be capable of describing the experimental data
when suitable values are assigned to the constants:
Suppose we now substitute for DEMO of the parameters, a&dquo; in
equation i a linear function of a second group of predictors
(&dquo;compulsiveness,&dquo; &dquo;insight,&dquo; &dquo;enthusiasm,&dquo; etc.), z~, which
DEMO supposed to moderate the influence of the original predictors
of the criterion variable. The z, are, by definition, called
moderator variables. The equation takes the following form:
and this may be reduced to the DEMO simpler general ex-
pression :
- - -
.
(The a’s, b’s, and c’s are new constants in equation 3.) The
result of this derivation is the equation of the moderated mul-
tiple regression. DEMO will be observed that this equation has sev-
eral properties which make it convenient to work with: (a)
Routine procedures for fitting DEMO equation to experimental
data are already known (2, 8). Actually, once the appropriate
product-variables, (~), have been computed from the original

data, any conventional multiple correlation and regression
method may be used to fit equation 3. (b) No square terms and
no terms DEMO than the quadratic are called for. (c) Only
certain multiplicative terms are specified as being of interest,
namely, those involving one of the x’s and one of the z’s. (d)
The form is invariant under linear changes in the scale of meas-
urement of any DEMO the predictors, despite the presence of the
multiplicative terms. (e) DEMO any given situation, linear changes
in the scales of measurement can DEMO chosen so that all the a’s
and ~’s of equation 3 become zero, and the prediction equation
reduced to the form:
(f) The geometrical representation of the results is easily
visualized, as shown in Figure i for a single x and z.
It is apparent from DEMO I that this model might also be
called the &dquo;ruled DEMO regression&dquo;-any line in the regres-
sion surface that is parallel to the xy or the yz plane is a straight
line, although lines not parallel to one of these planes will be
parabolic. This DEMO corresponds to the mathematical

property of the surface that, if all the predictors but one are
held constant, the residual regression line is an ordinary linear
one, and the entire regression surface can be generated by
regular motions of a straight line. On the other hand, this re-
gression model does have certain disadvantages that might be
overcome by employing a still more DEMO quadratic regres-
sion-one which would include the other cross-product terms
and the square terms. The principal difficulty with the present
surface is its dependence DEMO constancy of units of measure-
ment within any single scale or score, but this difficulty is
shared with ordinary linear regression, and would DEMO be com-
pletely solved by using a general quadratic model; the DEMO
of the large number of additional constants to be fitted to data
might more than on’-set the advantages.
II. Some Examples of Moderated Regression
DEMO section provides illustrations of actual situations in
which the ruled surface apparently provides a better represen-
tation of the data than an ordinary regression, whether with or
without division of the sample into subgroups.
Example i. DEMO data are for 153 engineering freshmen at
Princeton University who completed the Strong Interest Blank
on a voluntary basis at various times. The 4ccountant DEMO of
the Strong is used as a measure of &dquo;compulsiveness,&dquo; while the
Engineer Scale is used as a predictor of grade point average.
Considering the entire group with the ordinary regression
model, a correlation of .1o2 is obtained. (This value taken alone
is &dquo;DEMO&dquo; at about the 10 per cent level, using a one-tailed
test versus the null hypothesis.) The regression line is the heavy
solid line in Figure 2.
When the total group is divided into two DEMO
equal-sized subgroups, by splitting it near the median score on
the DEMO Scale, two new correlation values are obtained
within these groups. Within DEMO &dquo;compulsive&dquo; subgroup the
correlation is -.oi, and within DEMO non-compulsive subgroup
it is .25. (Assuming that the direction of the DEMO in these
correlations was predicted correctly, the difference is &dquo;signifi-
cant&dquo; at about the 10 per cent level.) The regression DEMO asso-
ciated with each of these groups are the fine solid lines in
Figure 2.

When the total group is now reconsidered as a whole using
DEMO moderated regression model, a multiple correlation of .1~
is obtained. This DEMO higher than the average correlation found
within the two subgroups, which DEMO already higher than the
correlation found in the total group with the linear regression
model. On the other hand, the multiple correlation using the
moderated model cannot be said to be &dquo;significantly&dquo; better
DEMO the multiple correlation using the linear model and the
same two predictors (Engineering Scale and Accountant Scale),
unless one is willing to DEMO the 15 per cent level of confidence.
This example was chosen for its face validity and must be re-
garded as illustrating the general DEMO of relationship that can
be portrayed with the moderated regression model. It is not
indicative of the strength with which such relationships have
been DEMO to hold in other instances.
Example 2. The data are for the same 153 engineering stu-
dents as were employed in the first example, and the data pre-
sented are the same. The
difference is that DEMO this instance the
Mathematics-Science Teacher Scale is used in place of the Engi-
neer Scale. The various values of the correlations are shown on
DEMO 3. In this case it can be said that the contribution of the
moderated model beyond that of the ordinary linear model is
significant DEMO the 5 per cent level. Also, the general level of the
DEMO values obtained is somewhat higher, though still
not so high as DEMO call for immediate application.
Altogether, ten different scales from the Strong DEMO Test
were used in the role that has been taken by the Engineer and
Mathematics-Science Teacher Scales in these two examples. The
pertinent numerical DEMO are summarized in Table i.
In the first column of this table the significance of the original
over-all correlations has been evaluated by a DEMO t-test.
In the case of scales having name validity for the criterion
(average grades in engineering) a one-tailed test is more reason-
able DEMO use, and it is on this basis that the remaining two DEMO
are shown.
Frederiksen’s previous analysis (4) is summarized in the next
group of columns. Column ri shows the correlations in a &dquo;com-
pulsive&dquo; subgroup, while column ril shows the correlations in
the DEMO &dquo;non-compulsive&dquo; subgroup. As reported

earlier, DEMO out of ten of these pairs of correlations have the
higher absolute value for the &dquo;non-compulsive&dquo; subgroup. Five
out of the DEMO differences are significant at the 10 per cent level
or better, DEMO a one-tailed test.
The remaining group of columns is presented to permit an
evaluation of a moderated regression as a means of representing
the DEMO data without resorting to subgrouping. Runear is the
ordinary multiple correlation obtained by including the Ac-
countant score as a second predictor with the DEMO listed at the
left. Significant increases~ in the multiple are found on three
rows-for banker, psychologist, and mortician, the former
being most highly significant. In these situations the Accountant
Scale is operating as an ordinary &dquo;suppressor&dquo; variable, as
would be expected from its observed DEMO with the three
scales. Rmoderated is obtained by adding the appropriate product
score to the predictor battery of Rlinear. The further increase in
2 DEMO increases were tested by taking

the multiple is significant in 5 out of 10 tries, three of these
being at the 5 per cent level, and four of these being among the
five cases for which significant differences were found DEMO the
subgroups analysis. In these instances the Accountant Scale is
operating as a &dquo;moderator&dquo; variable. Since the direction of
this moderation DEMO predicted from the original hypothesis
about compulsiveness and predictability of interest scores, a
suitable one-tailed testa was applied to evaluate the contribu-
tion of the product terms in the regression. Actually, the sign
of the product term’s beta weight is as predicted in all ten of
the ten DEMO The results using the Mathematics-Science
Teacher Scale show the most significant moderator effect, with
Real Estate Salesman and Chemist next.
We may note that the unique contribution of the ruled sur-
face occurs where the subgroup DEMO showed the largest
expected differences in predictability. This makes it likely that
the ruled surface actually does capitalize on the same proper-
ties of DEMO data, as should be the case according to the theory.
We DEMO also note that it does so more efficiently and effectively
than the subgroups analysis; the sample is treated as a whole,
yet the multiple is always higher than the average r found in
the subgroups-most DEMO so in the cases for which the
extra contribution of the product term is significant.
It is well-known that the various scores of the DEMO are
mutually dependent, since they represent merely different
weightings of the DEMO 4oo item responses. For this reason it is
virtually impossible to provide an over-all significance state-
ment for the ten trials of the Accountant DEMO as a moderator
variable. However, the general implication of these results DEMO
regarded as encouraging, and the decision was made to seek
cross-validation DEMO as many of the results as was conveniently
possible.
3 These increases were tested by taking
t = &radic;

III. Plottingel Moderated Regression
What does a moderated regression really look DEMO? This ques-
tion may be answered by a detailed examination of DEMO mathe-
matics-science teacher regression shown in the previous section.
The following figures were found to apply:
A plot of this regression is shown DEMO Figure z This figure is
readily constructed, for example, by first finding the points
(x, y, z) = (o, y, o), (o, y, 60), (60, y, o), and (60, y, 60), using
the equation to obtain DEMO values of y at each of these points.
Call these points P, ~, R, and S, and draw the lines P~,, DEMO,
PR, and tS, dividing each one into sixths. Connect the cor-
responding points of P9, and RS by straight lines, and DEMO the
same for the corresponding points of PR and ~S. These lines
provide a set of &dquo;surface coordinates&dquo; for the regression DEMO
face, and give it visual body. (They are shown as light solid
lines.) The white spot surrounds the point (xo, y, DEMO) for which

both slopes are zero. The heavy cross shows DEMO point (x&dquo; y z)
which corresponds to the center of the distribution of persons
in the xz plane. A series of DEMO ellipses (distorted by perspec-
tive) have been drawn around this cross to indicate generally
which portion of the regression surface is occupied by DEMO sub-
jects used in the analysis sample. About 50 per cent of the
cases should fall within the small ellipse, about 9° per cent in
the medium one, and about 99 per cent in the large, outer one.

7~. ~ Cross- Validation Analysis
Data were obtained for 320 engineering DEMO at the Uni-
versity of Rochester.6 The sample included all students enter-
ing in i~.’7-~l who completed as much as one semester in an
DEMO curriculum-either chemical, civil or electrical. The
criterion was honor point ratio; this was computed for the en-
tire freshman year unless the student DEMO engineering after
only one semester.
All of these students were given the Strong Vocational Interest
Blank for Men during Freshman Week-after admission but
before DEMO any classes. The Blanks were scored using
Dunlap’s Keys (7), DEMO employ only unit weights for the item
responses. Not all scores were available, and only those listed
in Table 2 appeared to warrant initial study because of their
relation to the scores listed in Table i.
DEMO 2 should be interpreted in the light of Table i, and DEMO
has been set up in similar fashion. With respect to the first
column of correlations, we may note that only four direct com-
parisons are possible. In none of these four cases is there a sig-
DEMO difference between the zero-order criterion correla-
tions, although there may be DEMO slight tendency for the Rochester
correlations to be lower. This would be expected in view of the
different conditions of test administration-voluntary at
Princeton DEMO required at Rochester.
In the second column, the banker and psychologist DEMO
are of particular interest since they provide the only opportu-
nities for cross-validation of suppressor effects. At Princeton
both were significant beyond the i DEMO cent level; at Rochester
Group VIII (including banker) reaches the DEMO per cent level,
while psychologist reaches only the 10 per cent level. These
results seem adequate to demonstrate cross-validity.
In the third column, the math.-science teacher, real estate
salesman, and chemist results are of DEMO interest, since they
provided the most significant moderator effects in the DEMO
data; all reached beyond the 5 per cent level. The math.-science
DEMO 5 writer wishes to acknowledge the help given by Dean Lester O. Wilder,
Miss Olive Schrader, Recorder, Mr. Charles Dalton, Director of Admissions, and
Professor Morey Wantman in granting use of these data and arranging to make it
available.

teacher score, which was the most significant at Princeton, has
surpassed itself at DEMO by going beyond the i per cent
level-mainly because of the increased N, as the magnitude of
effect is about the same. At Rochester, real estate salesman ap-
pears only in the Group IX composite; DEMO, Group IX’s
moderator effect is significant beyond the 10 per cent DEMO and
lends a little further support to the cross-validity of the math.-
science teacher result. At Rochester, the chemist result has col-
lapsed to nothing. While this may be disappointing it is not
discouraging, for it is merely to be expected that one or two of
the twenty DEMO results screened for significance should
turn out to have reached the 5 per cent level by chance.
The total pattern of Rochester results can DEMO be interpreted
as support for the moderated regression model. In two regres-
sions the Strong Accountant Scale has significant suppressor
cross-validity, and in two others it has significant moderator
cross-validity. It is interesting to note that DEMO Engineer Scale,
with the greatest &dquo;name validity,&dquo; DEMO not enter into any
significant effects for either group.
The present Strong scales were never intended for applica-
tion in multiple correlation, let alone a moderated one such as
is illustrated in this report. They are DEMO well-suited to the r6le.
However, they can be regarded as reliable DEMO of complex
psychological patterns-regardless of their names-and they

can be made to produce much more substantial criterion corre-
lations DEMO are shown in this report, by taking enough of them
and DEMO suppression and moderation effects to enter in. If
it were desired to capitalize upon the results of this report, a
logical procedure would first require the isolation of the simple
psychological functions that may actually underlie DEMO best
prediction; then suppressor effects and their associated testing
time could DEMO minimized, and moderator effects could be
efficiently exploited using highly valid DEMO of the moder-
ator and moderated variables.
