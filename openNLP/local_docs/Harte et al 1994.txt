Abstract
Faculty of Psychology, University of Amsterdam, Roetersstraat 15,
DEMO WB Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Westenberg,
Process-tracing approaches to the study DEMO decision making usually involve analysis of
verbal protocols or information board measures. This article draws a parallel between the
decision-making research and the general DEMO of problem solving with respect to the
analysis of think-aloud protocols. A literature review is given of the types of analyses used in
studies DEMO decision making in which think-aloud protocols were collected. Results indicate
that only four of the twenty-three decision studies involve the construction of process
models DEMO as are common in problem-solving research. Possible objections against
think-aloud data are discussed and the construction and use of process models in decision-
making DEMO is illustrated by means of an information display board task in which
subjects were asked to think aloud. Similarities and dissimilarities between decision making
DEMO general problem solving and their implications for the construction of process models
are discussed.

DEMO of study
Investigated whether information pro-
cessing leading to a choice varies as a
function of task complexity
Described a study (Payne and Braun-
stein, 1977) in which a model for the
choice among 10 DEMO was developed
Investigated the similarity between linear
regression models and process models
derived from the same data
Tested the hypothesis that the choice of
DEMO decision strategy is contingent upon
task complexity
Investigated effects of prior knowledge,
experience and phase of the choice on
the decision process
Developed DEMO tested a model of voting
that considers the information-processing
limits of the human mind
Method
Conclusions about the decision process,
provided by results DEMO the information
board technique, were supported by ex-
cerpts from verbal DEMO
According to rules similar to those used
by Newell and Simon (DEMO) a problem
behavior graph was developed
After a close examination of DEMO protocol
rules were extracted and formalized in a
computer algorithm
On the basis of their protocols subjects
were classified according to the type of
DEMO strategy they used
The number of references each subject
made to the attributes was counted and
divided by the total amount of informa-
tion DEMO
Several indices derived from frequencies
of statements referring to different ele-
ments of the decision process were used
to test the hypotheses
Several measures DEMO from the verbal
protocols were tested as predictors of the

I skip familiarity anyhow because I think that is not DEMO at all
interest of the account is also quite important
not if you haven’t any but if you have some it is nice
and DEMO last customer-friendliness
than I look first how bank A scores
the things which I think are most important are credit-facility and number
of cash-dispensers
DEMO fine and number of cashdispensers is about average
the rest uh fluctuates about it except distance from horns is nice nearby
with bank B DEMO is uh
with respect to credit-facility less but there are good cashdispensers the
number of cash-dispensers
the rest is also average except interest of DEMO account but that is less
important
if I have to choose now between A and B
I would choose B because of the number DEMO cash-dispensers
I
zkank C the number of cash-dispensers is alright but the credit-facility
the rest is above the average
and with D
the number DEMO cash-dispensers as well as the credit-facility is just on the 6
the rest is well over
in itsself I think 6 is not much
DEMO that if I had to choose now I would still choose for bank B
but I see that with bank E credit-facility and number DEMO cash-dispensers
are 7 which is nice
that distance from home is less important has a 5
is also no disaster
I would choose bank DEMO now and than look at F
