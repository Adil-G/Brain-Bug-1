Business angels play a critical role in the creation of an entrepreneurial climate.
However, measuring business angel investment activity on either a cross-sectional or
time series DEMO is extremely problematic. This paper reviews various approaches to
measuring business angel investment activity: simple extrapolations, supply-side
approaches, demand-side approaches, hybrid approaches, investment-oriented ap-
proaches, tax incentive schemes and angel syndicates. It advocates that all developed
countries should produce time series data on business angel investment DEMO to
provide policy-makers with an overview of the ﬁnancing environment and to monitor
the eﬀects of interventions in the market. This requires a clear DEMO of a business
angel and a focus on investments rather than investors. The paper recommends a multi-
methods approach to collecting data on the DEMO business angel market.

1. Introduction
There is now a DEMO body of research that highlights the critical role which business
angels play in the creation of a favourable entrepreneurial climate (see Amatucci and Sohl
2006; Mason 2006a; Kelly 2007 for recent reviews). We deﬁne DEMO business angel as a high
net worth individual, acting alone or DEMO a formal or informal syndicate, who invests his or
her own DEMO directly in an unquoted business in which there is no family connection
and who, after making the investment, generally takes an active involvement DEMO the
business, for example, as an advisor or member of the board of directors. This corresponds
with what Landstrom (2007, 8) terms the ‘narrow’ deﬁnition of informal venture capital.
Their signiﬁcance arises for several DEMO First, business angels are the largest
external source of early-stage risk DEMO, substantially dwarﬁng investments made by
professionally managed venture capital (Wetzel 1987; Gaston 1989a; Sohl 2003; Mason
and Harrison 2000). Second, DEMO business angels do not incur the transaction costs of
venture capital ﬁrms they are able to make smaller seed and start-up stage investments,
DEMO below the minimum deal sizes and stages considered by venture capital fund managers
(Mason and Harrison 1997). Third, business angels are much DEMO geographically
dispersed than venture capital funds. The latter are overwhelmingly located in just a small

number of major ﬁnancial technology centres DEMO concentrate their investments in a
relatively small number of locations (Mason DEMO; Mason and Harrison 2002).
Furthermore, business angels tend to invest locally, making the majority of their
investments in ﬁrms located within 50–100 miles of where they live (Harrison, Mason, and
Robson 2003). So, from a regional development perspective the informal venture capital
investment process helps to retain and recirculate wealth within the region in which it DEMO
generated, counteracting the eﬀect of most investment mechanisms that act as DEMO conduit
through which personal savings ﬂow out of regions to the nation’s ﬁnancial centres for
investment in core regions and abroad (see Martin and Minns 1995 and Mason and
Harrison 1989 for examples of such eﬀects)DEMO Fourth, informal venture capital is ‘smart
money’. Business angels are typically DEMO investors who seek to contribute their
experience, knowledge and contacts to DEMO beneﬁt of their investee businesses (Harrison
and Mason 1992). Since DEMO business angels have an entrepreneurial background this
involvement can also be expected to beneﬁt the businesses in which angels invest.
Given the importance of DEMO thriving informal venture capital market for the creation
and maintenance of an entrepreneurial economy it is important that governments are able
to measure the DEMO of business angels and the level of their investment activity and
track variations over time. Measurement is important to monitor any decline in the
DEMO of business angels, identifying any drop in their investment activity or DEMO in
the nature of their investments, any or all of which DEMO threaten the entrepreneurial
environment. Measurement is also required to determine the need for intervention to
support the development of the market (an increase in the level of investment activity
might suggest that there is no need DEMO intervention), to assess the impact of government
interventions and other changes in the external environment on informal venture capital
investment activity. Equally, any evidence for a decrease in the number and investment
activity of business DEMO investors has implications for the development of additional
market interventions to increase the supply of capital. However, measuring the number of
business angels and their investment activity on either a cross-sectional (static) or time
series DEMO is extremely problematic. This is in marked contrast to the investment activity
of venture capital funds which is recorded and reported by their national DEMO capital
associations1 (e.g. British Venture Capital Association) and by various private sector
ﬁrms, including Library House, Dow Jones (Venture One), PricewaterhouseCoopers
(Money Tree) and Thomson Financial (VentureXpert).
The objective of this paper is therefore to oﬀer a critical review of various approaches
open DEMO governments to measure business angel investment activity with particular
reference to the United Kingdom. It is premised on the argument that the ability to
DEMO and monitor the scale and development of business angel investment activity is
beneﬁcial to government in developing policy to increase access to ﬁnance by DEMO
businesses, and also to entrepreneurs and ﬁnance providers. The challenge of DEMO a
robust time series dataset to measure business angel activity needs to be broken down into
two separate questions:
. What should be DEMO? In the context of growing deﬁnitional confusion the next
section seeks DEMO bring greater deﬁnitional clarity to deﬁnitional and measurement
issues.
. How can investment activity be measured? The paper provides a critical review of
data sources and approaches used in previous scholarly studies from various
countries which DEMO sought to measure the number of business angels and their
investment activity.

The concluding section oﬀers our recommendation concerning the most DEMO
approach to developing robust time series data which measure business angel activity.
2. Deﬁnitional considerations: what should be measured?
The key deﬁnitional issue is who to count as a business angel. The fundamental problem is
DEMO the population of business angels is not ﬁxed or static. Rather, DEMO a business angel
is a transitory state. A ‘virgin’ angel is someone who is looking to make their ﬁrst
investment. Most studies have identiﬁed DEMO signiﬁcant minority of ‘virgin’ angels who are
actively looking to make their ﬁrst investment. Since most of these studies were based on
membership of DEMO angel network that typically requires payment, this can be regarded as
DEMO indicator that these individuals have a high level of commitment to making
investments (although does not succeed in totally eliminating the ‘voyeur’ element).
However, this assumption may be harder to sustain when respondents are allowed to self-
deﬁne themselves as angels. Another problematic category are ‘dormant’ angels DEMO
individuals who have made one or more investments but are not currently looking to make
new investments, either because they have no further liquidity (but may become active
investors again once they realise proceedings from a successful exit event) or because they
have invested and have withdrawn from the market on the basis that this activity is ‘not
for them’. DEMO further category is latent investors – individuals who would not describe
themselves as active investors but who will investment opportunistically if suitable deals
‘pop DEMO Including ‘virgin’ angels, ‘dormant’ angels and ‘latent angels’ has the potential DEMO
overestimate the population of angels and the amount of funding available. This leads to
the conclusion that the main focus in the collection of DEMO series data should be on the
identiﬁcation of business angel investments rather than on business angels per se.
Nevertheless, assessment of potential investment (DEMO latent, dormant and virgin angels)
also has important policy implications, speciﬁcally arising from an understanding of the
determinants of the ‘conversion’ of DEMO into active investors who increase the supply of
entrepreneurial risk capital in the market.
Deﬁning business angels has become even more problematic in the DEMO decades since
business angels have been recognised as a focus of research and policy attention. First,
several diﬀerent types of investor have been DEMO, some of whom deviate from the
conventional deﬁnition (e.g. Coveney and Moore 1998; Sørheim and Landstrom 2001;
Infometrics Ltd 2004; Avdeitchikova DEMO). Second, GEM has contributed deﬁnitional
imprecision by reporting on what DEMO terms ‘informal investment’ to describe all non-
institutional risk capital investments in unquoted businesses (Reynolds, Bygrave, and
Autio 2003). This includes investments made by family, friends and business angels, with
business angel investment DEMO the smallest category. Indeed, GEM UK reported that
just 12% of DEMO investment is sourced from business angels. However, business angels
should be DEMO as conceptually distinct from ‘love money’ invested by family and friends,
so-called aﬃnity investment. Angel investment is primarily commercially oriented (subject
to the caveat that some business angels are willing to trade oﬀ some commercial DEMO
against altruistic considerations: Wetzel 1981; Sullivan 1994) whereas love money DEMO not.
Moreover, an angel investment can potentially be made in any DEMO whereas love
money is, by deﬁnition, restricted to situations in which there is a family or friendship
connection between the investor and the DEMO owner. Adding to the deﬁnitional
confusion is the fact that whereas a clear distinction can be made between family members
and others, the deﬁnition of a friend is much more problematic: surveys of ‘pure’ business
angels have consistently identiﬁed social, as well as business, networks as sources DEMO to
312 C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
identify potential investment opportunities. To complicate DEMO even further, the same
individual can make both ‘love money’ and DEMO investments.
Third, the maturing of the informal venture capital market has DEMO more ways in
which investors can make investments in unquoted companies, DEMO through various
forms of angel groups, syndicates and networks, blurring the apparent distinctiveness of
angel investing. A common model for angel groups is DEMO operate on a ‘core–periphery’
basis, with a small core of active DEMO oﬀering passive members of a group the
opportunity to invest in deals that they are oﬀered but had no role in identifying, evalua-
ting or negotiating and will not play any hands-on role in the investee DEMO This
latter group might be considered to have broken some aspects in the conventional deﬁ-
nition of a business angel. On the other hand, because they are investing their own money
on a deal-by-deal basis and DEMO a basic investment decision (yes or no) they could still
be considered to be business angels. Much more problematic are those groups that DEMO
on the basis of angels pooling their investment funds and devolving the investment
decisions to the syndicate leaders. This model is much more common DEMO the USA than in
the UK, where such investments would not DEMO eligible for tax relief under the Enterprise
Investment Scheme. The reality of angel investing is therefore that it operates on a
spectrum, occupied at one end by the solo investor who makes his or her own DEMO
decision to invest directly, and at the other end by investors DEMO are part of angel
syndicates who simply say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the investment opportunities that they are
oﬀered and play no direct hands-on DEMO in the investee company. The hands-oﬀ investor
who invests in a pooled fund, and delegates the decision on which investments to make,
would not be considered to be a business angel on the basis on DEMO deﬁnition adopted here.
3. Data sources for measuring the investment activity of business angels:
a critical review
As William E. Wetzel Jr. observed DEMO his pioneering research on business angels, the
population of business angels DEMO unknown and probably unknowable’ (Wetzel 1983, 26)
on account of their invisibility, desire for anonymity and the undocumented nature of their
investing. Unlike the institutional venture capital market, there are no lists or directories
of business angels. The consequence has been that research on business angels DEMO had to
identify business angels through a variety of imperfect sources with no way in which to test
for the ‘representativeness’ of the samples DEMO have been generated. Indeed, many studies
have been based on ‘samples DEMO convenience’, such as angels who are members of business
angel networks, or arising from snowball sampling methods, both of which are likely to
generate biased samples. Furthermore, the diﬃculty of ﬁnding business angels has meant
that most samples are small, which adds to the representativeness problem and makes it
problematic to extrapolate from sample results to derive population estimates DEMO activity
with any degree of robustness.
This section reviews a variety of approaches that have sought to overcome this
challenge of deriving robust estimates DEMO business angel investment activity or may have
the potential to do so. These studies are organised under the following headings:
. ‘Playing with DEMO – simple estimates based on extrapolation from existing data.
. Approaches that identify investors directly.
. Approaches that identify investors through the companies that DEMO raised ﬁnance
from business angels.
. A hybrid approach that provides both supply-side and demand-side estimates.
Venture Capital 313
. Investment-oriented approaches – based on monitoring investments made DEMO
BANs – the only part of the market that is visible.
. Tax incentive schemes – measuring investment activity of investors who make use DEMO
a tax incentive that is designed to encourage investments by private individuals in
unquoted companies (e.g. the UK’s Enterprise Investment Scheme).
. Angel syndicates – the emergence of organised angel investors who are becoming
increasingly DEMO in the market.
3.1. ‘Playing with numbers’
This is a label, DEMO by Wetzel (1987), for an approach that draws on existing DEMO
of information to provide broad-brush, back-of-the-envelope estimates of the size of DEMO
informal venture capital market and set it against the scale of investing undertaken by the
professional venture capital industry.
Wetzel (1987) performed some DEMO arithmetic on a variety of fragments of data on
high income families and the ﬁnancing of businesses to suggest the scale of the informal
DEMO capital pool in the USA. Looked at from the supply side:
if the average net worth of millionaires is between $1 million and DEMO million, then, excluding
borrowed funds, the total wealth controlled by DEMO one million or more US millionaires is
between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. If the average millionaire commits 10% of his or her net
DEMO to venture investing, the total informal venture capital pool is between DEMO and $200
billion. If only one-fourth of US millionaires have any interest in venture investing, the pool of
informal venture capital controlled by these 250,000 individuals lies in the $25 to $50 billion
range, about twice the capital managed by professional venture investors. (p. 305).
From a demand-side perspective,
it appears that each year over 100,000 DEMO investors ﬁnance between 20,000 and 50,000
ﬁrms for a dollar investment totalling $5 billion and $10 billion. The typical ﬁrm ﬁnanced by
DEMO raises about $250,000 from three or more investors. The typical investor provides
between $25,000 and $50,000 per ﬁrm, about half in the form of equity and half in near-equity
(loans and loan guarantees). During 1985 professional venture investors ﬁnanced about 2,500
ﬁrms for DEMO total of about $2.5 billion, an average of about $1 million DEMO ﬁrm. (p. 305)
The approach by Mason and Harrison (2000) started with the 5651 investors registered
with the 48 UK business angel networks listed in 1999–2000. It was assumed that everyone
who registers with DEMO BAN is a bona ﬁde business angel. Double-counting – investors
registered with more than one BAN – was adjusted by survey evidence that business DEMO
register with an average of 1.4 BANs. This ﬁgure (5651 7 DEMO) was multiplied by the
inverse of the proportion of business angels DEMO were estimated to be members of a BAN.
Because this proportion was not known it had to be a guesstimate. The resulting estimate
of DEMO number of business angels ranged from 20,000 to 40,000 to 80,000 depending
whether 20%, 10% or 5% of business angels were registered with a BAN. The same
extrapolation was used to estimate the DEMO amount invested by business angels. This
was derived from an annual survey of investments made through BANs which identiﬁed
the average business angel investment DEMO £20,000. This gave an estimate ranging from £500
million to £1 billion to £2 billion. This suggests that business angels make three times DEMO
many investments in start-up and early-stage businesses than venture capital funds.
However, these estimates are crucially sensitive to the scaling factor. They also assume that
angels registered with BANs invest with the same frequency as those DEMO are not members
314
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
and invest similar amounts. It also DEMO that there are no regional variations in the
proportion of angels who register with BANs, their investment frequency or size of
investment.
These estimates served a useful purpose at the time that they were published when
DEMO was a need to provide a numerical estimate of the scale of the informal venture
capital market in order to highlight its signiﬁcance to DEMO sceptical policy-makers
and to challenge the entrenched position of the professional venture capital industry.
However, the ﬁgures are very broad-brush and are unable to generate the precision
required for a time series analysis. They also depend DEMO certain critical assumptions.
Moreover, the decline in the number of local DEMO regional BANs in the UK would make it
much harder to reproduce Mason and Harrison’s methodology now.
3.2. Supply-side approaches: identifying business angels
There have been several attempts to generate estimates of the size of the DEMO venture
capital market based on identifying a sample of investors and using evidence on their
investment activity to derive an estimate for the entire DEMO
(i) Mailing list approaches
By far the most common approach to the identiﬁcation of business angels has been
through the use of various DEMO lists whose membership was thought to approximate to
the proﬁle of business angels. This includes mailing lists that are purchased from list
brokers, memberships of associations and contacts of various types of intermediaries and
gatekeepers.
Wetzel (1981) pioneered this approach, using the following lists: high income investors,
Presidents of major New England companies, colleague alumni from top New England
professional schools; New England CPAs, attorneys and bank CEOs; participants in the
1980 White House Conference on small business; subscribers to Inc Magazine; owners of
Mercedes Benz cars; and gatekeepers of various professional DEMO for small
businesses, bankers and securities dealers. Postma and Sullivan (1990) used a similar
approach, mailing questionnaires to accountants, attorneys, brokers, health care
professionals, top management of local businesses, commercial bankers and DEMO of
entrepreneurship networking groups. Mason and Harrison (1994) used the following
mailing lists: contacts of an investment syndicate; owner managers of SMEs; high income
groups; investors in junior market stocks. Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel Jr. (1994) used a real
estate transfer database to identify DEMO net worth individuals in New England. Reitan and
Sørheim (2000) used members of the national share investment association, contacts of a
private consulting ﬁrm specialising in capital raising and investor forums to identify
business angels DEMO Norway. Riding et al. (1993) relied largely on contacts of intermediary
organisations such as Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce and Regional
Development Associations to identify angel investors in Canada. Lumme, Mason, and
Suomi (1998) relied, in part, on science park managers and venture capital fund managers
to identify business angels in Finland.
However, the general consensus is that such lists are ineﬀective in identifying business
angels, generating extremely low response rates.2 Moreover, there is no way of
diﬀerentiating between non-respondents who are business angels from those who are
not. Using mailing lists DEMO also tautological – the selection of mailing lists is informed by a
view of what business angels look like (e.g. high net worth, DEMO, etc.) but the
Venture Capital
315
responses are then used to provide a proﬁle of DEMO angels (high net worth,
entrepreneurs, etc.). Respondents to surveys based on mailing lists may therefore not be
representative of the business DEMO population – but since the population in unknown and
probably unknowable (DEMO 1981) it is impossible to be sure. All of this suggests DEMO
mailing lists are not a suitable way forward to generate time series information on business
angel investment activity.
(ii) A capture–recapture approach
Canadian DEMO Allan Riding and one of his students developed a very novel approach,
never since replicated, to estimate the population of business angels in one Canadian city-
region (Riding and Short 1987). They recognised that the problem of identifying the
number of business angels in a geographic DEMO is very similar to the problem
encountered by biologists in estimating the number of a particular species. The capture–
recapture approach is a well-known DEMO to estimate the size of biological
populations without the need to resort to a census.
The ﬁrst step in this approach was to generate DEMO list of business angels using referrals
from an initial group of investors (and other knowledgeable actors). This process led to the
identiﬁcation of 50 individuals in Ottawa, the majority of whom were referred by other
business angels. The second step was to identify the number of times DEMO each individual
had been proposed by other business angels. This indicated that several investors have
high social visibility in the community. Given this, applying formal population ecology
models to the data (capture–recapture techniques) could be DEMO to estimate the total
number of business angels in Ottawa.3 According to the model there were an estimated 87
active business angels in Ottawa, with a standard deviation of 13. This is about 5% of the
DEMO population in the city-region with the same characteristics as those of active business
angels. Extrapolation of angel investment activity among those angels that had DEMO
identiﬁed estimated that there was a pool of $4–6 million Cdn. available for investment
over the next two years.
For all its ingenuity, this approach has some limitations. First, it is most appropriate
within relatively small, tightly knit and well-deﬁned geographical areas (e.g. a city-region).
With DEMO exception of very small countries it is not an appropriate approach for
developing a national estimate of business angel activity. Ottawa is a coherent DEMO unit
with a population of under one million when the study was undertaken and it is well
networked. Second, it requires considerable eﬀort to identify an initial group of business
angels – as much eﬀort as DEMO for some of the other approaches. The margin of
statistical error is too large for an annual time series – year-on-year variations would have
DEMO be large to be regarded as statistically signiﬁcant. Finally, it only DEMO an estimate of
the number of business angels in an area and further extensive survey work is needed to
generate information on the level DEMO investment activity. While it would be possible in
principle to extend this approach to cover a wider set of cities/regions, and thus to provide
some basis for aggregation to estimate overall market size, this would impose considerable
resource requirements that would render the approach diﬃcult to implement DEMO provide
either a cross-sectional or a dynamic longitudinal approach to estimating the market.
(iii) Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
GEM is an international research programme involving scholars from 42 countries. It is
best known for DEMO levels of entrepreneurial activity in each of the countries
316
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
involved in the programme. This is DEMO on asking respondents in a telephone survey
whether they are in the process of starting a business or have started a business within the
DEMO 42 months. GEM also asks respondents whether they have invested in someone
else’s ﬁrm in the previous three years (excluding buying publicly traded shares and mutual
funds), and if so, how much did they invest and what was the relationship with the
business owner. Sample sizes are DEMO least 2000 in each country, surveys are administered by
professional market DEMO companies and conducted by telephone and samples were
weighted to be representative of the adult population.
Several studies have used GEM in an eﬀort DEMO gain a better understanding of informal
venture capital investing. For example, DEMO et al. (2003) examined informal investing
in 18 GEM countries for which there were data for more than 40 investors. The prevalence
ranged DEMO under 2% to over 6% (in USA and New Zealand), DEMO an average of 3.4%.
Some 48% of investors invested in a relative’s business, 29% in a friend or neighbour’s
business, 11% in a DEMO colleague’s business and 8% in a stranger’s business. Bygrave and
Reynolds (DEMO) have made a separate analysis of informal investing in the USA. DEMO
and Ho (2007) have also used GEM to examine informal investing in Singapore.
Regardless of country, informal investment is dominated by investments in the businesses
of family members, with investments in the businesses of friends and neighbours and work
colleagues also signiﬁcant, some of which may qualify as business angel investment as we
have deﬁned it. The inability to DEMO separate out these two conceptually discrete
categories of investment makes this data source a very imperfect basis for estimating
market trends.
A signiﬁcant development DEMO the use of GEM data is oﬀered by Maula, Autio, and
Arenius (2005) who studied informal investors in Finland, pooling three years of GEM
data for the years 2000 to 2002. The prevalence rate DEMO informal investors was 2.9%. Half
of the investments were in the businesses of close family or other relatives. The key
contribution of this study DEMO to separately distinguish investments in businesses owned
by close family from other investments. They found that the predicated determinants of
investing provided a better DEMO for investing in ﬁrms owned by other than close
family members. One of the advantages of this approach is the pooling of data over, in this
case, three years. This oﬀers the ability to run more robust sophisticated analyses using
pooled cross-sectional data. While this is not suitable DEMO a basis for developing a regular
time series analysis, it does DEMO a possible framework for a longer ‘comparative statics’
approach based on either a rolling three-year analysis or a comparison of successive three-
year estimates DEMO provide an indication of longer term shifts in the level of business angel
investing.
Nevertheless, GEM, as presently constituted as a household survey DEMO entrepreneurial
activity, has a number of limitations and deﬁciencies that reduce DEMO potential use as the
basis for a consistent, robust time-series for DEMO on business angel investment activity.
First, most of the data refer DEMO the investor rather than the investments made. Second,
GEM covers both ‘pure’ business angel investment and aﬃnity investment in the
businesses of family DEMO friends – while this provides information on the total ﬂow of
capital from individuals into this market, it is not clear cut in providing a picture of the
pure business angel market per se. Moreover, investors can have dual status – they can
make investments in the businesses DEMO close family investors as well as in businesses owned
by non-family members. However, GEM allocates investors to a binary category based on
their most recent investment. Third, given the rarity of business angels, even a
DEMO large sample size (such as UK GEM) still contains relatively few angels.
This has implications for the sample errors of estimates of changes DEMO the scale of the
Venture Capital
317
market over time, with year-on-year changes in investment activity having to be fairly
large to register as statistically signiﬁcant.4
It would DEMO possible, in principle, to modify the questions that GEM asks in order to
focus on the investment rather than the investor, and to be more precise in identifying the
nature of the investment. The initial DEMO question would remain, but then a series of
questions about each DEMO made would be asked (e.g. relationship with the business
owner; amount initially invested and any follow-on ﬁnance; industry sector; stage of
business DEMO; time input to helping this business; was this investment made – at
least in part – with the expectation of generating a ﬁnancial DEMO at some time in the
future?). Responses to these questions DEMO enable the identiﬁcation of investments that
meet the deﬁnition of business angel deals.
The limitations of household or population surveys to explore angel investing DEMO
have been highlighted in a major study in Sweden that involved adding questions to an
existing omnibus survey (Avdeitchikova and Landstrom 2005; Avdeitchikova, Landstrom,
and Mansson this issue). One of the features of DEMO methodology is the considerable
‘wastage’ – from an initial sample of over 40,000 private individuals just 278 informal
investors were eventually identiﬁed. A DEMO weakness concerns the reliability of responses.
From the initial survey 861 business angels were identiﬁed, 3.6% of the total. These
individuals were asked if they would agree to a further interview by the researchers: 548
agreed, and 433 were successfully contacted. What is interesting is that this more detailed
interview revealed that 123 of these individuals did not meet the DEMO of a business angel.
3.3. Demand-side approaches
The most popular approach for identifying business angel investment activity has been
through the companies in which DEMO have invested. This was the approach used in the US
SBA studies of the 1980s and variants of this approach have also been adopted DEMO
Canadian researchers. Researchers in Scotland have recently used information from
Companies House that identiﬁes external shareholders.
(i) US SBA studies
The US SBA DEMO three regional studies in the mid-1980s to identify the scale of informal
venture capital markets: (1) mid-Atlantic, South Central and Southeast states (Gaston and
Bell 1986); (2) urban areas contiguous to the DEMO Great Lakes (Arum Research
Associates Inc. 1987); and (3) DEMO regions not covered in the previous studies (Gaston and
Bell 1988)DEMO Uniformity of design, procedures and key results permitted merger of these DEMO
surveys into a single database informal investment in the USA which was used by Gaston
(1989b) to proﬁle the US informal venture capital DEMO Data gathering and estimation
procedures are described in Gaston and Bell (DEMO) and Gaston (1989a).
The procedure for gathering data involved two stages. First, a representative sample of
240,000 businesses with fewer than 500 employees were selected from the D&B ﬁle. These
businesses were DEMO if they had any informal investors and if so, to provide DEMO contact
details. Second, questionnaires were sent directly to the 2900 individuals DEMO had been
identiﬁed in this way: 551 were completed and returned, of which 435 were usable. These
questionnaires provide information on both investors DEMO businesses receiving informal
investment.
The procedure for estimating the stock of investors was to multiply the total number of
ﬁrms in the USA by DEMO proportion that were identiﬁed as having informal investors,
318
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
adjusting to take account of the DEMO number of investors per ﬁrm, multiple
investments made by investors and DEMO average holding period. All of these measures were
derived from the questionnaires completed by investors. This estimated ﬁgure for the stock
of investors was DEMO by the average annual investment rate of investors to derive an
estimate of annual investment activity. This ﬁgure was multiplied by the average size DEMO
equity investment to calculate the annual dollar level of investments. The process was
replicated to estimate the value of loans and loan guarantees provided DEMO investors. On the
basis of this approach Gaston (1989a) estimated that business angels in the USA in the
1980s were providing capital to DEMO 40 times the number of ﬁrms receiving institutional
venture capital, and DEMO the amount of capital they invested almost exceeded all other
sources of external equity capital for new and growing businesses combined.
There are two DEMO criticisms of this approach. First, it requires a huge upfront
investment DEMO the ﬁrm survey to generate a relatively small number of usable responses
from angels, given that the survey is unique and speciﬁc to this data collection exercise
rather than being undertaken as part of an omnibus DEMO This reﬂects a combination of
the rarity of informal investing and low response rates. In the case of the eastern Great
Lakes region study, 40,000 ﬁrms were randomly selected (out of 470,000 small businesses).
This led to the identiﬁcation of 200 ﬁrms which had investors. DEMO produced 68 responses,
55 of which were usable, after extensive DEMO, involving up to four telephone calls per
investor (Arum Research Associates Inc. 1987). Second, the component statistics that are
used to calculate the national estimate of informal investment activity are all based on
estimates. DEMO, the approach used does not permit the measurement of statistical
conﬁdence DEMO Gaston’s (1989a) response was to test his estimate for plausibility against

(ii) New company incorporations survey in Atlantic Canada
In DEMO report undertaken on behalf of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA)DEMO
Farrell (1998; Farrell et al. this issue; Farrell and Howorth DEMO) sought to identify
informal investors among those individuals who are closely DEMO with newly
incorporated companies – entrepreneur, a director, agent, lawyer DEMO investor. The
investors identiﬁed from this research were grouped into three categories: those who had
made just one investment which was in a family ﬁrm; those who had made both family and
arm’s length investments; DEMO those who had only invested at arm’s length. Overall, 12%
of DEMO directors had made investments in other businesses in what is an economically
lagging region, which serves to underline the importance of this source of ﬁnance,
particularly in such regions where institutional sources of ﬁnance are DEMO (Mason 2007).
However, as a basis for developing a time series analysis of business angel investment
activity this approach has two deﬁciencies. DEMO, it is time consuming, and thus better
suited to generating point estimates rather than cross-sectional data. Second, as with data
capture–recapture methods, DEMO is more applicable at regional rather than national level,
where the labour required to identify and follow up a suﬃcient number of respondents DEMO
reliability purposes would be inordinately expensive.
(iii) Exempt investors
In some countries, including the USA, UK and Australia, in order to reduce the cost and
time involved in raising ﬁnance from private individuals, securities legislation allows small
ﬁrms to oﬀer and sell their shares to ‘accredited DEMO without the need to meet the
Venture Capital 319
prospectus and ongoing disclosure requirements of securities legislation (Preston 2007).
Accredited investors are deﬁned in terms of net worth or DEMO The UK has a self-
certiﬁcation scheme whereby potential investors are allowed to self-certify themselves as
either high net worth individuals or sophisticated investors. DEMO high net worth criterion is
earnings of at least £100,000 a year or net assets of at least £250,000 (excluding principal
residence and pension). Individuals can self-certify as sophisticated investors if they meet
DEMO of the following conditions: have been a member of a network DEMO syndicate of business
angels for at least six months; have made DEMO than one investment in unlisted companies
in the previous two years; DEMO, or have worked in the previous two years in a
professional DEMO in the private equity sector or in the provision for ﬁnance for small
and medium sized enterprises; or is currently, or has been DEMO the previous two years, a
director of a company with an DEMO turnover of at least £1 million. Accordingly, ﬁrms
can now promote DEMO individuals that they ‘reasonably believe’ are self-certiﬁed as high net
worth or sophisticated investors, conﬁdent that they are operating within the law (HM
DEMO 2004).
Authorised investors would appear to oﬀer a rigorous and well-focused means of
deﬁning business angels, if access to lists of such accredited investors can be assured.
Indeed, a simple headcount by the securities authority would provide an indication of
trends in numbers of business angels and DEMO regular survey of such investors could gather
information on investment activity. However, only one study has used this type of data.
Robinson and Cottrell (2007) have studied ‘informal’ investors who are exempt under the
Alberta (Canada) Securities Legislation (which is a Provincial responsibility). They are DEMO
three types:
. Family, friends and business associates of the DEMO of the ﬁrm (‘relational
investing’).
. Oﬀering Memorandum and Short DEMO Oﬀering Prospectus – which covers
individuals with small pools of capital for investing in early-stage businesses on an
ad hoc basis (‘opportunity-based investing’).
. Sophisticated and accredited investors – which covers individuals who are able DEMO
make informed investment decisions and those who and meet minimum income and
asset tests and so are able to absorb an investment loss (such investors would meet
the typical deﬁnition of a business angel).
Firms DEMO rely on exemptions to sell securities to Albertans are required to ﬁle an
exemption report with the provincial securities commission. Robinson and Cottrell (2007)
used this data to compare the investment behaviour of these three DEMO of investor. To
date, there have been no similar studies from DEMO jurisdictions, reﬂecting the lack of
access to the lists of accredited DEMO
(iv) Companies House data (88(2) forms)
All incorporated companies in the UK are obliged to ﬁle details of investments received,DEMO
where such investment results in the issue of shares. The data captured on shareholder
details and changes in these by Companies House are potentially DEMO most comprehensive
sources of relevant data collected as part of an existing administrative procedure and have
been used successfully in Scotland as the basis DEMO research into the risk capital market
over a ﬁve-year period (Harrison DEMO Don 2004, 2006). Companies are obliged to make
returns on DEMO 88(2) within one month of allotment of shares, suggesting that this
320
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
potentially represents a timely source of DEMO on investment. Not all payment for
shares need be in cash, DEMO there is a limitation on the ability of this source to provide a
complete indication of the volume of investment; however, the Scotland DEMO
suggests that this is a minor restriction on the utility of this data source.
However, a number of material problems stand in the way of using this data source to
measure business angel investment activity. First, while all incorporated companies are
under a legal obligation to ﬁle details DEMO investments received with Companies House (on
form 88(2)) the DEMO refers only to the issue of shares. It is common practice to divide
an investment between an equity instrument (details of which may be found on the
Companies House ﬁle) and one or more debt instruments (which may not). The latter will
be invisible to an outside observer, but may sometimes represent 95% or more of a deal.
Second, although companies are obliged to ﬁle share issue details at Companies House,
this obligation is not rigidly enforced. Filing at Companies House does DEMO of itself
validate a share issue (the deﬁnitive record being the DEMO books). Hence ﬁlings are
often delayed by many months, are DEMO obviously incorrectly completed, and are
frequently duplicated. Pages are sometimes left DEMO, or not processed correctly by
Companies House staﬀ, and sometimes there are no ﬁlings at all. There appears to be no
eﬀective administrative DEMO legal penalty either for failure to ﬁle an 88(2) or DEMO error in
ﬁling, despite the requirement to ﬁle within one month. DEMO is therefore sometimes necessary
to ﬁll in details by deduction, or DEMO trusting information from a market source. Both
extrapolations are obviously prone to error.
Third, Companies House does not publish a list of 88(2) ﬁlings. It is therefore
extremely diﬃcult to spot a company raising money if no footprints appear at all which
lead to discovery of an DEMO(2). The only way to capture all deals ﬁled would be to
commission a search of 88(2) ﬁlings on the Companies House database, to identify the
research targets. Considerable further work would then be required to read and analyse
the ﬁlings revealed by the search. There DEMO signiﬁcant cost and manpower resource
implications arising from this administrative practice.
For this reason, market intelligence information is drawn upon to search for 88(2)
ﬁlings. However, this creates a further set of diﬃculties. Companies ﬁle at Companies
House under their incorporated name. Occasionally companies will operate DEMO
diﬀerent brand names. Market comment on deals usually quotes the latter. This means
that a widely publicised deal may be diﬃcult or impossible to DEMO Companies also
change names, form complex groups, and transfer businesses between themselves, making
tracking more diﬃcult.
Fourth, even where a deal has DEMO ﬁled well and quickly the picture may be confusing.
Most deals involve multiple parties. It is often the case that diﬀerent parties to a DEMO
report diﬀerent total deal values, partly through errors of recall, partly through diﬀering
treatment of tranches, debt, convertibles and preference shares and DEMO through double-
counting of investments. It is possible for several highly reliable sources to report
completely diﬀerent data, all in good faith. On occasion parties will misrepresent deals (up
and down) deliberately in order to DEMO the perceptions of customers, partners and
competitors. Dealmakers are equally prone DEMO this practice, not least to move themselves
up published ranking tables DEMO activity. This is a major issue in seeking to reconcile 88(2)
data and other sources of market intelligence.
Fifth, it is sometimes diﬃcult to distinguish accurately between founders and business
angels in Companies House DEMO, as it is in real life. An early business angel investor DEMO
become actively involved for a year or two and look like a founder to the outside world,
but like an investor to the DEMO entrepreneurs. Speciﬁcally, while name and address
Venture Capital
321
details are provided, 88(2) forms do not DEMO any indications as to the provenance of
the investor shareholders and their relationship to the business. Additional and sometimes
extensive work is required to DEMO investors, distinguish ‘insiders’ (principals in the
business) from ‘outsiders’ and DEMO family investors (who may not of course, share
surnames in common) from non-connected investors.
Finally, a small number of business angels and DEMO use oﬀshore vehicles to conceal
their activities and/or manage their tax liabilities. While many of these vehicles can be
accurately attached to given DEMO, some cannot, muddying the distinction between
angel and institutional investment. Some institutions also use oﬀshore vehicles and
oﬀshore incorporations for the same reasons.
DEMO considerations suggest that the use of 88(2) forms may be DEMO as the
basis for a detailed robust time series analysis of the business angel market in the UK.
However, what, at least potentially, 88(2) data oﬀer is evidence of the actual ﬂows of
capital into businesses, scope for analysis of the form of that investment (DEMO terms of the
class of shares, the split between cash and DEMO considerations oﬀered for share
acquisition) and company registration details that permit DEMO with, for example, the
FAME database for purposes of further analysis.
3.4. Hybrid approaches: Canada’s SME FDI initiative
In response to a Task Force on the future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector (1998)
which highlighted ‘a lack of consistent, comprehensive and impartial data on SME
ﬁnancing’ the Federal Government mandated the Department of Finance, Industry
Canada and Statistics Canada to gather data on SME ﬁnancing and report regularly to DEMO
House of Commons Industry Committee on the state of SME ﬁnancing in Canada.5 This is
known as the SME Financing Data Initiative. It comprises DEMO a demand-side survey and
a supply-side survey. The demand-side survey is a weighted sample of ﬁrms with up to 499
employees and less than DEMO Cdn in gross revenues (with certain sectors excluded –
ﬁnancing and DEMO companies, co-operatives, subsidiaries, not-for-proﬁt organisations,
government and other public DEMO organisations). The surveys have occurred on a
biennial basis since 2001 and have provided the basis for several reports on SME ﬁnancing.
On DEMO basis that many – although not all – business angels are business owners
questions were included in the 2003 demand-side survey to ask if DEMO had made any
informal investments. The process of estimating total angel investment activity involved
two steps: ﬁrst, and straightforwardly, scaling up to the population of business owners, and
second, a scaling up from the DEMO of business owners to the general population
based on an estimate of the population of business angels who are business owners. The
scaling factor DEMO was 0.91 to reﬂect evidence that 91% of Canadian business angels were
business angels. The responses have been analysed by Riding (2006, and DEMO issue).
The logic and rigour makes this a very appealing methodology. Unlike other ﬁrm-
based surveys it is able to calculate estimates for DEMO the ﬂow and stock of angel capital.
It utilises an existing survey of SMEs. However, the ﬁnal estimate is sensitive to the
estimate of the proportion of business angels who are business owners – the estimate DEMO
in this study seems too high when compared with existing research, DEMO further research
can reﬁne this ﬁgure. But perhaps the main concern with this approach is evidence from
previous research that some angels are cashed-out DEMO who have sold their
business and so are no longer business owners. Mason and Harrison (1994) reported a
high proportion of business angels DEMO were self-employed, a category which included
respondents who described themselves as DEMO This seems likely to include
322
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
cashed-out entrepreneurs. It therefore becomes critical DEMO know whether cashed-out
entrepreneurs who become business owners set up new companies as an umbrella for their
consulting, investment and other activities and whether such companies are included in the
sampling frame that is used in DEMO approach. Nevertheless, it would seem well worth
assessing the feasibility of DEMO this approach elsewhere.
3.5. Investment-oriented approaches – business angel network data
The only visible part of the informal venture capital market is investments made DEMO
business angel networks. This data source has the advantage of accessibility, DEMO that
networks are accessible and have membership records which can be used as a source of
data or for survey purposes. As such, they represent a relatively low cost mechanism for
collecting data, and have been used in this context in the past. However, there are also
several signiﬁcant limitations. In particular, the coverage of the market is incomplete –
only a minority of business angels are members of networks, and there is no knowledge as
to the proportion of the total number of DEMO angels that are members of networks or
the proportion of total investment activity that is captured.
Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel Jr. (1993) DEMO the investor registration forms for the period
1985 to 1992 for Venture Capital Network (VCN), based in New England, one of the DEMO
established business angel networks which sought to introduce investors and business angels
using computer software. The forms proﬁled investor characteristics and preferences,
investments DEMO the extent of their involvement in their investee businesses. Simple analysis of
these data was eﬀective in highlighting the declining pace of angel investment DEMO over
this period, one of economic decline. More recently, Sohl and colleagues have used data from
surveys of angel portal organisations6 to address DEMO of market trends and evolution and
composition (including the role of DEMO business angel investors in particular) in the post-
2001 period (Sohl 2006, 2007; Becker-Blease and Sohl 2007).
In the UK information DEMO been collected and reported annually on investments made
through BANs on an annual basis from 1993–4 through to 2003, initially on behalf of the
British Venture Capital Association and then for the National Business Angel Network
(NBAN), and linked to the publication by these organisations of an DEMO directory of
BANs. Data collection ceased after 2003 following the demise of NBAN. The successor
organisation, the British Business Angel Association, collects a DEMO more limited range
of data, which is restricted to (1) DEMO total amount invested by investors who are part of the
networks that are members of BBAA; and (2) the total number of investors who are
members of these networks. Response rates by BANs were generally DEMO high (over 90%)
and the quality of the information provided DEMO good. This is because many BANs were
remunerated by a success fee so had a vested interest in tracking the outcomes of the
introductions DEMO they made. Some BANs were also very involved in the investments as
an honest broker. Missing information was only a signiﬁcant problem in two DEMO:
breaking down amounts invested when there were two or more investors, and knowledge
about the co-investors in a deal.
Although this data source cannot measure the volume of investment activity, for the
reasons given earlier, it is valuable in highlighting trends. Mason (2006b) used these data
to provide a detailed analysis of business angel investment trends from 1993–4 DEMO 2003.
This highlighted the increasing volume of activity on all indicators (DEMO, deals,
amount) from 1993–4 to 1997–8; the increasing amounts DEMO from 1997–8 to 2001 but
static trends in investors and investments; DEMO the decline in number of investors and
amount invested in 2001 and 2002 but some recovery in 2003. It also identiﬁed changes in
Venture Capital
323
average size of investments and deal sizes, the growing trend towards investments by angel
groups and a steady rise in the DEMO of investments in technology businesses.
Notwithstanding the tip-of-the-iceberg issue, investment data DEMO business angel
networks provides a unique and valuable insight into business angel investment trends, at
least for that segment of the market represented by membership of business angel
networks, can be produced at very low cost and because of the small numbers involved can
be analysed and published DEMO only a short time delay.
3.6. Special investment situations – tax incentive schemes for private investors
Many countries have schemes which provide tax incentives DEMO individuals to encourage the
supply of equity ﬁnance to smaller, unquoted DEMO The UK has two such schemes:
the Enterprise Investment Scheme (DEMO) and Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs). The EIS
provides tax relief for direct equity investments in qualifying companies, whereas VCTs
are professional fund management companies that pool the investments of private
individuals and make investments DEMO qualifying companies (which includes AIM-listed
companies). Many business angels use DEMO EIS scheme to make investments, hence the
question arises whether data DEMO EIS investments could potentially be used as a surrogate
measure for business angel investment activity.
HMRC collects and publishes data on EIS and VCT DEMO However, these data
relate to the company and so cannot provide DEMO of investor characteristics. Moreover,
there may be a delay of up to three years for the information on EIS investments to become
available (although HMRC estimates that some 90% of the data is available within DEMO
years), so there will be a time lag in analysis. Consequently, EIS data are unlikely to provide
a robust basis for timely time series analysis. In the longer term, however, this restriction
becomes less DEMO and thus EIS data have the potential to oﬀer reasonably consistent
market estimates, and to permit the investigation of additional issues, including the DEMO
between investment and company performance (Cowling et al. 2008).
There DEMO much less reliable information on investment at the investor level from EIS
records. Data come from self-assessment tax records, and may cover around 90% of
activity; the remainder is accounted for by direct claims through the investor’s local tax
oﬃce. It is currently not possible to link investor DEMO with investee company records.
The self-assessment data are reasonably timely: claimants DEMO either invested during the
tax year to which the claim relates or in the following six months. Limited demographic
data are available to support DEMO of the investors, and collection of this information
would only be DEMO at what would be viewed as disproportionate cost with respect to
the potential beneﬁts, and self-assessment data are most suited for investigating the
sources of reported income. This will provide some indication of the relationship between
DEMO level, and source, and investment activity, and location of investor (by postcode).
Other demographic indicators are not available from this source.
DEMO addition to these considerations, there are a number of other concerns DEMO using
EIS data as a means of monitoring business angel investment activity. First, by no means
all business angel investments are made using EIS (Mason and Harrison 1999). However,
there are no estimates for the proportion that this accounts for, whether investments made
using the EIS are diﬀerent from those that do not use EIS, or the stability of this
proportion over time. These issues could be addressed through a DEMO survey of
business angel investors to provide a basis for extrapolating from EIS investment to the
business angel market. Second, EIS includes investments that would not be considered as
falling within the deﬁnition of angel investments DEMO terms of the type of business being
324
C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
invested in. Third, EIS data are primarily company-based so it is diﬃcult using this
information to identify and DEMO investments in the market, such as syndicate invest-
ment when all DEMO members make separate EIS claims and are therefore counted
separately. Fourth, DEMO most important of all, EIS statistics are a by-product of the
DEMO of a particular government initiative to support small businesses. It follows that
the continuation and consistency of the dataset depend on the continued existence
DEMO the EIS. Changes in how the scheme operates, notably in terms DEMO the amount of tax
relief, the annual limit on the amount DEMO, and on how much companies can raise, all
of which have changed over the years, create discontinuities because of their eﬀects on the
amounts that individuals will invest under the scheme. Cessation of the scheme DEMO
terminate the dataset.
For all these reasons EIS investment statistics would not appear to represent the basis
for a robust time series on informal DEMO capital investment activity in the UK.
However, it may be appropriate DEMO undertake a one-oﬀ survey to identify the extent to
which EIS investment meets the deﬁnition of business angel investment, what proportion
of business angel activity is outwith the EIS and whether EIS investments are distinctive
from DEMO investments7 in order to explore the potential for extrapolation from the
EIS statistics.
VCTs raise a diﬀerent set of issues. Much VCT investment is DEMO pooled funds,
breaching our deﬁnition of business angel investment. Furthermore, DEMO investments can
also be made in certain types of publicly listed companies (e.g. some AIM companies),
which do not fall within the DEMO of business angel investment. In fact, VCTs appear
to have been DEMO less popular among business angels than the EIS (Mason and Harrison
DEMO). This is no doubt linked to the desire of most business angels to be involved in both
the investment decision and the post-investment DEMO, neither of which is possible
with VCT investments.
3.7. Angel syndicates
DEMO angel marketplace is evolving from a largely invisible, atomistic market dominated DEMO
individual and small ad hoc groups of investors who strive to keep a low proﬁle and rely
on word-of-mouth for their investment opportunities, to a more organised marketplace in
which angel syndicates (sometimes termed ‘structured angel groups’) are becoming
increasingly signiﬁcant (May 2002; May and O’Halloran 2003). As a result, the angel
marketplace is in the process of being transformed from a ‘hobby’ activity to one that is
now increasingly DEMO in its operation, with published routines for accessing
deals, screening deals, undertaking due diligence, negotiating and investing.
There are currently estimated to DEMO more than 250 angel syndicates located throughout
the USA (Preston 2007) and growing evidence of specialisation by industry sector (e.g.
health care angel syndicates) and type of investor (e.g. women-only angel syndicates).
They DEMO by aggregating the investment capacity of individual high net worth
individuals (DEMO). Some groups are managed by a core group of members while others
are manager-led (Preston 2004). A national body to bring angel groups together for the
purposes of transferring best practice, lobbying and data collection was created in 2003
(Angel Capital Association). The same trend is also evident in other countries, notably the
UK, Canada and DEMO, although at an earlier stage, and it has not attracted the same
degree of attention from researchers or commentators.
Angel syndicates have emerged DEMO individual angels have recognised the
advantages of working together, notably in DEMO of better deal ﬂow, diversiﬁcation of
Venture Capital
325
risk, superior evaluation and due diligence of investment opportunities, and the ability to
make more and bigger investments, as well DEMO social attractions. The growth of angel
groups since 2000 has been driven by two speciﬁc factors. The ﬁrst is the deterioration in
relations between DEMO angels and venture capital funds as a result of the aggressive
behaviour adopted by venture capital funds in the post-2000 technology downturn. The
inability DEMO angels to provide follow-on funding, combined with the much lower valuation
DEMO the subsequent funding compared with the original investment by the angels (DEMO
rounds’) and their loss of rights as a result of the DEMO onerous terms and conditions under
which the venture capital funds invested in down-rounds (e.g. liquidation preferences)
resulted in a signiﬁcant dilution in the angel’s investment, often to the extent of rendering
it worthless even if the investee company was a going concern. The consequence was to
create DEMO bad feeling between the venture capital industry and the angel
community. By investing together in groups angels have been able to become much more
DEMO of venture capital funds to the extent of being able to fund their investments
to an exit without the need for a venture capital DEMO Second, the withdrawal of many
venture capital funds from the small DEMO of the market following the technology downturn
has meant that angels have been required to do follow-on rounds. Most solo angels do not
have DEMO ﬁnancial resources to do this themselves, providing a further reason to DEMO
alongside other angels.
The emergence of angel syndicates is of enormous signiﬁcance for the development and
maintenance of an entrepreneurial economy (see Mason 2006a, 284–8 for a discussion).
Angel syndicates are now emerging as signiﬁcant players in the provision of start-up and
early-stage venture capital, ﬁlling what has been termed the ‘new’ equity gap that has
arisen as a DEMO of the withdrawal of many venture capital funds from this part of the
market. Some syndicates are members of their national venture capital associations (e.g.
BVCA in the UK; NVCA in the USA) and their DEMO are reported as part of the
association’s annual report on investment activity. One eﬀect of this is to disguise the
extent to which venture DEMO funds have shifted away from making early-stage
investments. Moreover, angel syndicates DEMO subject to a diﬀerent range of inﬂuences and
objectives from those of venture capital funds. For all these reasons their investment
activity should be DEMO and reported separately from that of venture capital funds.
Sohl has pioneered the collection and reporting of angel syndicate investment activity
in the USA (e.g. Sohl 2006). However, its value is diminished because much of the
information is collected in the form of percentages. Moreover, because of the way in which
the data are presented it is not clear DEMO the response rates are (but it is suspected they are
low)DEMO Variability across surveys in which groups respond also creates problems in
analysing the data over time. The Angel Capital Educational Foundation, in association
with the Kauﬀman Foundation are also collecting information on investments and group
characteristics (e.g. number of members, investment preferences, years in operation,
organisation DEMO, side car fund, management or member-led, member fees) from their
members. It would seem appropriate for Canada and the UK – countries DEMO have
followed the USA in terms of angel syndicate formation – to follow suit.
4. Conclusion
Business angels play a critical role in supporting DEMO entrepreneurial economy. They are the
largest external source of start-up ﬁnance after family and friends, their investments ﬁll the
size, stage and sector DEMO left by venture capital funds, and in many regions are virtually
DEMO only source of risk capital. Business angels are often responsible for providing the
326 C.M. Mason and R.T. Harrison
initial funding for young companies that DEMO fast growth. Indeed, many angel
syndicates have the capability to do DEMO rounds of ﬁnancing, suﬃcient to take the
company to a trade DEMO or an IPO without the need to ‘pass the baton’ to venture capital
funds. As experienced business people, in many cases as successful entrepreneurs, business
angels also contribute valuable non-ﬁnancial assistance to the businesses in which they
invest. Policy-makers therefore need to be able to measure, monitor and, if appropriate, to
respond to trends in business angel investment activity. DEMO, the invisibility of
business angels and their investment activity is a DEMO barrier to the development of
information on business angel investment activity and our knowledge base is largely
restricted to various ad hoc studies, mainly conducted by academic researchers. These are
largely cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, small scale, based on samples of
convenience and increasingly use inconsistent deﬁnitions of business angel activity. In
view of the priority that most governments give DEMO removing ﬁnancial barriers to small
business growth there is an urgent need to develop improved statistical information on
business angel investment activity. Without improved DEMO information there is a risk
of inappropriate policy intervention.8 Thus, there DEMO a need in all developed countries for
improved time series data on business angel investment activity.
This requires agreement that business angels are a DEMO and coherent type of
investor. The adoption of GEM’s unhelpful category of ‘informal investment’ needs to be
resisted. It also requires a consensus on DEMO deﬁnition of a business angel – i.e. what should
be measured. Although the deﬁnition of ‘business angels’ has become increasingly fuzzy at
the edges, the key features that distinguish business angels from other types of ‘informal’
DEMO remain robust, namely:
. investing their own money;
. DEMO their own investment decisions;
. commercial considerations dominate the investment decision (although some
investors may trade oﬀ part of the commercial return for non-ﬁnancial
considerations);
. excludes within-family investments;
. involves ‘hands-on’ involvement with the investee company (if not by the investor
then by a co-investor).
The collection of data must therefore be based on this DEMO deﬁnition of business
angels.
Second, this review has established that attempting DEMO identify business angels and the
amounts that they have available for investment is extremely problematic, and not terribly
meaningful. Rather, it is their DEMO investments that are signiﬁcant. Accordingly, the
focus of data collection should DEMO on investment activity – the investments made by
business angels – rather than on the investors themselves.
Third, we have highlighted the way in which the angel marketplace is evolving, noting
in particular the emergence of angel syndicates which have emerged to ﬁll the ‘gap’
between the amounts DEMO entrepreneurs can raise using ‘3F’ and solo angel money and the
minimum amount that most venture capital funds will consider. This is a hugely DEMO
development, although not one that is universal. Although the number of DEMO syndicate
investments is small compared to the numbers made by traditional angels investing on
their own or in small ad hoc groups they are DEMO in terms of amounts invested.
Given this increasing signiﬁcance of angel groups, we advocate that angel groups should
be identiﬁed and regularly updated and surveyed at least annually to collect information
Venture Capital
327
on their investment activity using the US survey instrument DEMO to enable
international comparisons.
We conclude on the basis of our review of data sources and methodologies that the
development of robust information on DEMO activity by business angels is best met
by the adoption of a multi-methods approach. This would involve a combination of a
regular survey of DEMO syndicate investment activity, a modiﬁed GEM, a more detailed
survey of business angel networks, and a Canadian-style FDI survey. Adopting this
approach would provide comprehensive statistical information on business angel
investment activity and, more importantly, would provide policy-makers with an eﬀective
‘instrument dial’ for monitoring the early-stage risk capital market and providing the basis
for evidence-led intervention in the DEMO

Notes
1. DEMO is a tendency to assume that national venture capital statistics are an accurate measure of
investment activity by the institutional venture capital industry and DEMO to use them
uncritically. However, a study of the membership of DEMO Swedish Venture Capital Association
challenged its representativeness – and hence the accuracy of its statistics – noting that it includes
some ﬁrms that are DEMO proper venture capital investors and excludes some important investors. The
eﬀect is to understate the amount of early-stage investments (Karaomerlioglu and Jacobsson 2000).
2. Mason and Harrison (1994, 73–5) noted that response varied quite markedly by type of list, with
the most productive being those lists that targeted investors making more speculative types of
stock market investments (e.g. on junior stock markets).
3. The best ﬁt model was the DEMO based on the interaction of the sample generated by entrepreneurs
and that generated by local business professionals. The model was as follows:
log DEMO ¼ m1ðiÞ þm2ðjÞ þm3ðkÞ þm23ðjkÞ
where mijk is the maximum likelihood estimate of the expected cell count in cell ijk; m1(i) m2(DEMO) and
m3(k) are the main eﬀects of the ﬁrst, DEMO and third samples respectively; m23(jk) is the interaction
term reﬂecting the two-factor eﬀect between the ﬁrst and second samples.
4. The application DEMO rare event econometric techniques may go some way to addressing this
particular weakness.
5. The Mission Statement of what became known as the SME DEMO Data Initiative ‘is to be a
world class, cutting edge program DEMO builds a comprehensive knowledge base of timely and
unbiased information on SME ﬁnancing in Canada. This critical knowledge will help foster an
environment which DEMO the growth of Canadian SMEs by fuelling the public policy debate
and bringing clarity to the SME ﬁnancing market. We do this in an DEMO of
professionalism, transparency and interdepartmental cooperation.’
6. This is a wider DEMO of organisations than business angel networks (or ‘introduction services’)
and DEMO includes organised angel groups.
7. For example, it has been suggested DEMO the 30% maximum shareholding and the requirement to
invest in ordinary shares will bias EIS investments in favour of smaller and earlier stage
