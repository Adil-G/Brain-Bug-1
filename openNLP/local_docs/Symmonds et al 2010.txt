Making the best choice when faced with a chain of decisions requires a person to judge both anticipated outcomes and future actions.
Although DEMO decision-making models account for both risk and reward in single-choice contexts, DEMO is a dearth of similar
knowledge about sequential choice. Classical utility-based models assume that decision-makers select and follow an optimal predeter-
mined strategy, regardless of the particular order in which options are presented. An alternative model DEMO continuously reevalu-
ating decision utilities, without prescribing a specific future set DEMO choices. Here, using behavioral and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) DEMO, we studied human subjects in a sequential choice task and use DEMO data to compare alternative decision models of
valuation and strategy selection. We provide evidence that subjects adopt a model of reevaluating decision utilities, in which available
strategies are continuously updated and combined in assessing action values. DEMO validate this model by using simultaneously acquired
fMRI data to show that sequential choice evokes a pattern of neural response consistent with a tracking DEMO anticipated distribution of
future reward, as expected in such a model. DEMO, brain activity evoked at each decision point reflects the expected mean, variance, and
skewness of possible payoffs, consistent with the idea that DEMO choice evokes a prospective evaluation of both available strategies
and possible outcomes.
Introduction
Evaluating alternative actions is central to decision-making.
Many everyday situations require DEMO to generate a chain of
actions (a path through a decision-tree), leading to a distribution
of outcomes, which engenders uncertainty. This is DEMO focus in
ecology, in which animals forage to ensure intake exceeds DEMO
mal need constraints (Stephens et al., 2007), and in finance, in
which traders reap bonuses by exceeding a target return from
sequential transactions (Panageas and Westerfield, 2009). Com-
mon to these examples DEMO that the distribution of possible out-
comes (energy, money) differs DEMO each available series of choices.
Decision-making models in finance, psychology, and ecology
account for uncertainty (risk) and reward when valuing actions
(Markowitz, 1952; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Stephens and
Charnov, 1982). Growing neural evidence supports the idea that
key components of an outcome DEMO, such as mean and
variance, are explicitly encoded in the brain. However, this liter-
ature focuses on immediate returns from single choices (DEMO
et al., 2005; Abler et al., 2006; Yacubian et al., 2006; Plassmann et
al., 2007; Elliott et al., 2008; DEMO Martino et al., 2009), leaving a
relative dearth of knowledge DEMO sequential choice.

In game theory and classical dynamic programming,
decision-makers’ strategies under every contingency are de-
scribed by a DEMO of actions that maximize subjective value (“util-
ity”). In sequential DEMO, these utilities are called “continuation
values” because action values are contingent DEMO following a fu-
ture strategy. Thus, in assigning continuation values, decision-
makers must make assumptions about what type of future
choices they will DEMO Standard dynamic programming con-
strains decision-makers to invoke only optimal choices in the
future [optimal continuation value (OCV)]. Critically, an opti-
mal DEMO can be planned in advance, implying that “online”
updating is irrelevant DEMO irrational (dynamically inconsistent) in
the absence of new information (Dekel DEMO al., 1998; Epstein and
Schneider, 2003). An OCV decision-maker, when presented with
decision 1 followed by decision 2, makes the same set of choices
even if the order is reversed (as long as no new information is
presented until after choices are made).
However, decision-makers can assign utilities to options
assuming that they might not take DEMO optimal choice in the
future. This might occur if choices became unexpectedly con-
strained, when planned strategies would no longer be avail-
able. All available strategies (rather than just the preplanned
“optimal” strategy) are taken DEMO account before each choice,
for example, by assuming that future DEMO are distributed
randomly [average continuation value (ACV)]. This entails
that DEMO are dynamically reevaluated and action values
recalculated depending on which strategies are available. This
scenario allows for dynamic inconsistency, in which future
choices can depend on the order in which options are pre-
sented (Machina, DEMO).

Thus, sequential decision-making poses two clear problems.
First, do humans evaluate the distribution of outcomes when plan-
ning choice? Second, do individuals assume optimal future choices
DEMO making sequential decisions? Here, we tested different models
of strategy valuation and planning, simultaneously acquiring neural
data [using functional magnetic resonance imaging (DEMO)]. We
hypothesized that neural activity evoked in single-shot decision par-
adigms also supports decision variables mediating sequential choice.
Materials and Methods
Behavioral experiment
DEMO study was approved by the Institute of Neurology (University Col-
lege DEMO, London, UK) Ethics Committee. Seventeen subjects (age
range, 22–36 DEMO; seven male) participated; one dropped out from
scanning because of DEMO and was excluded from analysis.
Monetary earnings were between £18 and £28, including a fixed £10
participation fee. Stimuli were presented on a standard personal com-
puter using Cogent presentation software (Wellcome Trust Centre for
Neuroimaging, London, UK) run in MATLAB (version 6.5; Math-
Works). Choices were made by key-press selections on the computer
keyboard of a DEMO personal computer.
We provided instructions with a 15 min verbal tutorial, DEMO ensure that
subjects understood the paradigm. In each block of the task, subjects
were required to make five sequential choices between a sure or risky
alternative. For each trial, a lottery was represented on screen using a
picture of four cards (Fig. 1), and subjects indicated by a button press
their choice to gamble or selection of a fixed DEMO amount of £2. Different
numbers on the cards (0, 1, DEMO, 3, 4) indicated monetary value in pounds.
We used five DEMO card combinations, generating five lotteries with
matched expected value of £2 DEMO with different variance. All lotteries had
symmetrical outcome distributions (i.e., were unskewed), with a mean
return of £2. On each block, the same five lotteries were presented once,
using a randomized order of DEMO, necessary if one is to detect
dynamically inconsistent choices. Critically, no feedback about out-
Figure 1. Task structure and timings. Trials were grouped DEMO blocks of five. To commence each block, a financial target
appeared DEMO the screen for 3.7 s (4 levels for behavioral experiment outside DEMO: 5, 9, 11, 13; 2 levels inside scanner: 7, 12). A
fixation cross was shown at the beginning of each trial for 1–5 s (jittered). A lottery then appeared on the screen, and subjects had
up to 3.7 s to indicate by button press their choice (gamble or £2 for sure). Lotteries were represented by four red cards, with
numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) indicating monetary values in pounds, each with a probability of 0.25 of being selected. A computerized
random-number generator was used for DEMO; subjects were shown the selected trial and block outcomes. Total earnings DEMO

money would be won from the trial regardless of
choice.
Subjects were instructed to try to win as much money as possible,
remembering DEMO the total amount won would depend on reaching the
target and whether they chose to gamble or not. Subjects were informed
that outcomes would DEMO recorded for all their choices in the experiment
but that these would not be shown at the time. Subjects were not explic-
itly told DEMO only five types of gamble would be shown. However, to
acquaint DEMO with the task and to engender the idea that actual out-
comes were recorded from each choice made, five practice blocks using
identical gambles were run with full feedback.
Analysis. We initially categorized trials by two DEMO, current target
level and the variance (risk) of lottery presented. DEMO data were assessed
by ANOVA and multiple regression implemented in SPSS (DEMO for
Windows, release 12.0.1, 2001; SPSS Inc.). We then DEMO choices by
block. There are 25  32 possible combinations of choices in each block,
and we refer to each of these combinations DEMO trajectories of choices as a
strategy, denoting strategy n as sn (n  1,..., N ). The frequency with
which each DEMO was chosen was compared with simulated strategy
choice frequencies by 2 test. We simulated blockwise choice frequencies
using mechanistic binomial choice models (described below) and esti-
mated the best-fitting parameters of these models using an application of
the method of simulated moments (McFadden, 1989). This estimation DEMO
based on comparing observed frequencies of choices with simulated fre-
quencies, DEMO from an underlying structural model. Free parameters
were optimized with a nonlinear simplex search algorithm in MATLAB
7.0. We selected the best-fitting model and DEMO relative model per-
formances by a comparison of criterion values on an individual subject
basis.
Behavioral modeling. Our behavioral models have two components.
The DEMO component provides a model of valuation, calculating an ex-
pected utility DEMO strategy (Vn, n  1,..., N ) given the DEMO of
outcomes a particular strategy generates. In other words, we apply DEMO
utility function to each distribution of outcomes, to generate a single
DEMO representing the subjective value of each strategy. The second
component models how future choice is incorporated, in which we im-
comes was given during the task. This con-
straint allowed us to focus on a situation DEMO
which individuals do not need to adjust their
strategies in response to feedback, enabling us
to distinguish whether individuals adhere to a
predetermined strategy, regardless of the par-
ticular sequence in which the options are pre-
sented (consistent with classical dynamic
programming models in which choices are
made based on the optimal continuation
value), or whether they continuously reevalu-
DEMO, taking into account a range of available
strategies on each trial.
DEMO altered the distribution of possible out-
comes and the relative utility of both the gamble
and sure option by imposing financial targets (on
each block). At the beginning of each block, a
target appeared on the screen (four levels used
outside scanner: 5, 9, 11, 13; two levels used inside
scanner: 7, 12). Subjects were told that 10 trials
would be randomly selected at the end of DEMO ex-
periment from all sessions (inside and outside
scanner) in which all trials had an equal chance of
being picked. For selected trials, if the required
target had been reached in that block, the out-
come of that trial would be paid out (i.e., 10 trials
DEMO chosen to determine pay, contingent on
whether the target was reached DEMO the end of each
block). This would be £2 if they had picked the
certain fixed amount or whatever the outcome of
the DEMO (determined by a random selection of
one of the four cards), if they had chosen to gam-
ble. If the target had not been reached, then no

plement three separate continuation DEMO models. These models specify
how strategies are compared and which strategies influence the value of
the current choice (to gamble or not to gamble). On the first trial in a
block, there are 16 possible strategies given a choice to gamble and 16
possible strategies given a DEMO of the sure amount. This reflects the fact
that there are five ordered binary choices between a lottery and a certain
payout, so 32 (2 5) possible sets of choices are available in any given DEMO
Each of these strategies has its own outcome distribution. Note that the
set of available strategies reduces as sequential choices are made such
that, by the fifth trial in a block, only two possible alternative strategies
are available (to gamble or opt for the sure outcome). In other words, the
set of possible strategies at any given trial is contingent on previous
choices in the block and the order in which DEMO gamble options have been
presented.
Valuation model. We used a mean–variance–skewness (DEMO) model
in which the distribution of outcomes is evaluated by a DEMO linear
sum of its statistical moments. We assign values (utilities), DEMO,t, to available
strategies s, on each trial t, for DEMO target level h, and calculate utility given
the predicted distribution of DEMO resultant from each strategy s.
The set of strategies evaluated are contingent on previous choices in
each block. For example, on trial t  4, there will be four possible
available strategies to evaluate, given DEMO certain sequence of simulated
or actual choices for trials t  1,2,3. Each of these strategies will
generate their own distribution of DEMO numerical outcomes. The
probability distribution of outcomes for each strategy will alter de-
pending on target level h.

 is a coefficient reflecting aversion to variance in outcomes, and  re-
flects the degree of positive skew seeking behavior. Using a free parameter
for skewness allows modeling of a wide DEMO of preferences (skewness is
a second-order approximation of risk), because DEMO model accounts for
preferences for relative losses and gains independently of the spread of
outcomes.
We present the results using one valuation model (mean–variance–
skewness) in the main text. We also tested alternative utility models,
although these models are not directly statistically comparable because
they are non-nested DEMO a different number of parameters (see supple-
mental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
We did not implement more complex variants DEMO prospect theory with
differential weighting of relative losses and gains because an MVS model
incorporates some aspects of this behavior while being much easier DEMO fit
(because it is linear in its arguments).
Continuation value DEMO
To simulate choice, our continuation value models perform a tree search
DEMO all possible choice (action) and outcome (state) combinations from
current trial t to the end of each simulated block. This search is DEMO
gent on (i.e., constrained by) previous choices. We recalculate the DEMO
of available strategies on each trial, and, as the block proceeds, the num-
ber of possible strategies available reduces such that by trial t there will be
26t possible strategies remaining.
Optimal continuation value. This DEMO assumes that agents pick the
choice combination (trajectory) of all possible alternatives that maxi-
mizes utility by the end of each block. In DEMO words, the decision-maker
compares the current options on each trial (select the sure amount or to
gamble), and only the trajectories giving DEMO predicted outcome distribu-
tion that maximizes utility determines choice. Thus, OCV DEMO the
choices for a prospective decision-maker who acts in accordance with
classical dynamic programming principles. Thus, in accordance with
standard dynamic programming models, DEMO is oblivious to the order
in which options are presented.
We assign action values (Q) to the binary options gamble (specified as
Q1) or sure (specified as Q0), calculated on every trial, as the decision-
maker progresses through the decision tree. These two action values DEMO
then compared with determine choice:
Q0 V
n
, where
n
 arg maxn{Vn  sure choice},
Q1  V
n
, DEMO
n
 arg maxn{Vn  gamble choice}.
n indexes the possible continuation trajectories (available strategies) or
branches of the decision tree.
Note that DEMO OCV will remain the same on every trial within a block
when a subject adheres to the strategy selected at block outset. In the DEMO
of a deviation from an optimal trajectory, the next best (utility maximiz-
ing) strategy is taken from the remaining options available. Importantly,
in the case of these deviations, the OCV model prescribes that appropri-
ate correction is taken based on always trying to follow the utility-
DEMO strategy.
Average continuation value. This model entails that agents calculate the
average value or utility of each of the two alternative choices on each DEMO
(i.e., choosing to gamble or take the sure amount) rather DEMO forecasting
with respect to optimal continuation trajectories. This model does not
require that agents have an explicit plan of future choices and is akin DEMO a
model in which the current choice is made under an assumption that
choices are made randomly for the rest of the block. Every DEMO strat-
egy influences current continuation values. As such, the decision-maker
can DEMO thought of as myopic:

Q1  

Vn sure DEMO,

Sure continuation value. This model assumes that agents weigh up
the current choice against a benchmark of taking the sure DEMO for
the remainder of the block. This implements a simple heuristic in
which the choice to gamble or take the sure amount is made DEMO a
fixed benchmark:
Q0  V

where t indexes the current trial ( T) in the block (DEMO  1,...,5).
For a given target, several strategies DEMO lead to similar distributions of
outcomes. However, strategies will differ in DEMO outcomes depending on
the target level. Moreover, a critical feature for DEMO these decision rules is
that subjects’ previous choices within a block determine the remaining
available strategies to be evaluated. These models assume that the DEMO
space of possible actions and outcomes is known. We make this simpli-
fying assumption to render model estimation tractable (i.e., specifically
we do DEMO incorporate uncertainty about future options). This is not
unreasonable given that the task has a simple repeating structure with the

same five lotteries DEMO presented on each block throughout practice,
behavioral, and scanning sessions.
DEMO example. We provide a simple numerical example of how
these models work in practice (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental DEMO). Imagine that you are faced with
a two-stage sequential decision between a gamble (g) and a sure amount
(s) of money, which is fixed at £2. The first decision (decision X) is
DEMO to accept a 50:50 gamble giving either £4 or £1. The second
decision (decision Y) is whether to accept a gamble giving DEMO 75:25%
chance of winning £3 or £0, or again opting DEMO a sure amount of £2.
There are four possible strategies to consider (ss, sg, gs, gg combinations,
which we refer to DEMO strategies A, B, C, D), each giving a different DEMO
bution of outcomes. In our models, these distributions are evaluated
according DEMO a utility function (U), to give four separate numbers, or
utilities, one per strategy.
For example, we now assign numbers to DEMO utilities for illustrative
purposes: U(ss)  10; U(sg)  8; U(gs)  4; U(gg)  7. DEMO now
having to choose a current action. In our model, if DEMO were an optimal
decision-maker, you would compare the highest utilities given DEMO
choice [in this case, U(ss) for a sure choice, DEMO(gg) for a gamble choice].
Because U(ss)  U(sg)  U(gg)  U(gs), you prefer to make DEMO sure
choice on the current trial. For the next decision, you DEMO make a sure
choice, now comparing U(ss)  10 versus U(sg)  8. Thus, you have
selected strategy A. What DEMO you are a decision-maker conforming to an
average continuation value model? DEMO this case, you weigh up the average
utility of outcomes from DEMO current choice [i.e., you compare (U(ss) 
U(sg))/2  9 with (U(gs)  U(gg))/2  5.5]. In this example, you also
prefer to make a sure choice [as U(s, )  U(g, )]. For the subsequent
decision, you compare U(ss)  10 and U(DEMO)  8 and again make a sure
choice, following strategy A.
Now let us consider a situation in which the order of decisions DEMO
reversed (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple-
mental material). There remain four strategies, but their order has
changed such that we have the following: U(ss)  10; U(sg) DEMO 4; U(gs) 
8; U(gg)  7. If you are an optimal continuation value decision-maker,
you choose the sure DEMO as U(ss)  U(sg)  U(gg)  DEMO(gs), followed
by another sure option [as U(ss)  DEMO(sg)]. The order has no effect on the
ranking of the strategies, and you make a dynamically consistent choice
by following strategy A again. If you are an average continuation value
decision-maker, you will compare (U(ss)  U(sg))/2  7 with (U(gs) 
U(gg))/2  7.5 and pick the gamble choice initially. On the next decision,
you make a sure choice, as U(gs)  U(gg), such that now you follow
strategy B and have made a dynamically inconsistent choice as the order
DEMO which the options are presented has affected choices. A sure continu-
ation value (SCV) decision-maker would make a consistent choice in this
example, in which the “sure, sure” strategy A has the highest utility but
also can make dynamically inconsistent choices if this is not the case. DEMO
actions actually selected (and whether they will be dynamically consis-
tent) will depend in practice on the specific utilities assigned to the avail-
DEMO choices by the decision-maker. Note that, in these models, order
independence (dynamic consistency) only holds if there is no new infor-
mation DEMO, which is the case in this experiment in which no trial-
DEMO feedback is given, also that these models reflect different methods
of DEMO and planning (i.e., an anticipated selection of choices) rather
than DEMO execution of a preformed plan (i.e., self-consistency).
Action selection. We account for randomness in choice by the addition
of noise at action DEMO (modeled by a logistic choice function). Thus,
the predicted DEMO of choosing to gamble on a given trial is given by
the following:
P gamble choice 

where  is a free parameter.
Model estimation. We based our model DEMO on a comparison of
the observed frequencies of block-by-block choices (i.e., strategies) with
simulated frequencies, derived from each of the underlying structural
DEMO outlined above. The models generate a choice per trial per simu-
lated block (using the probabilistic action selection rule), from which we
calculate the simulated frequency () with which each strategy is chosen.
We DEMO 1200 simulated blocks per model, across all six target levels, with
a randomized trial order per block. These simulated frequencies are then
compared DEMO actual observed choices (z), using the method of simu-
lated DEMO (McFadden, 1989). z(i) is a vector of choices DEMO avail-
able strategies on block i, with its elements taking the DEMO 1 for the
chosen strategy and 0 otherwise:

where yi is a vector of observations from one block i (observed  simu-
lated frequencies), is a weighting matrix, and D, the criterion function,
is the weighted sum-of-squares DEMO between the observed and sim-
ulated frequencies across all blocks (i DEMO 1,..., N ). Optimization of D
(which finds the DEMO set of parameters ) is performed in a two-
step procedure. Initial unweighted estimates are derived with
 I
(identity matrix). A weighted optimization is then performed. To esti-
mate the precision of the observations, we calculate the covariance ma-
trix ( ) of the differences between DEMO and observed frequencies
that come out of an unweighted optimization:

To make invertible, it is necessary DEMO aggregate unchosen strategies,
otherwise the weighting matrix is rank deficient. The estimated precision
is then the inverse of this covariance matrix ( 1)DEMO We weight observa-
tions according to this precision in performing the weighted optimiza-
tion to calculate an unbiased estimator. This method of moments
criterion DEMO D is not differentiable in the parameters (there are step
changes DEMO the value of the function as the parameters vary); hence, DEMO
use a simplex search method to optimize the parameters with respect to
the criterion function D (by using the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm
implemented in MATLAB). We use the method of simulated moments
to optimize the DEMO because the problem of multinomial sequential
choice is high dimensional and computationally difficult to integrate.
This means that we cannot use Bayesian methods to DEMO a measure such as
the Bayesian information criterion. In these circumstances, DEMO method
of simulated moments provides a robust way of optimizing models, DEMO
the criterion function acts as a likelihood estimate that allows compari-
son of our model space.
The optimized criterion value D is a direct DEMO of the residual sum
of squared error of each model. D (DEMO by the number of obser-
vations) is 2 distributed (Hansen’s J statistic) (Hansen, 1982). Relative
model likelihoods calculated from 2 statistics are not comparable for
non-nested models. However, to the extent that the number of parame-
ters are equal (for a given utility and noisy choice model), criterion values
can be directly compared. Hence, inverse criterion values (D1), reflect-
ing relative goodness-of-fit, were directly compared for DEMO mod-
els on an individual subject basis. All expected utility and prospect theory
models have two free parameters ( and ), whereas MVS models have
three free parameters (, , and ).
Functional MRI
All subjects had previously completed the behavioral experiment and
understood that DEMO task structure and presented lotteries were identical.
We used two target levels during scanning (7 and 12). Visual cues were
projected onto a screen, visible via an angled mirror mounted on the MRI
head coil. Choices were indicated by pressing a button box with the right
index DEMO, and responses were recorded using Cogent presentation
software.
Scanning parameters. We DEMO gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-
planar images (EPI) with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) con-
trast, ona3T head scanner (Magnetom Allegra; Siemens Medical).
Imaging parameters were as follows: 48 oblique transverse slices; slice
DEMO, 2 mm; gap between slices, 1 mm; repetition time, DEMO s; echo

time (TE), 30 ms; field of view, 192 192 mm2. We used an EPI DEMO
quence that optimized for BOLD sensitivity in the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) using a combination of an increased spatial resolution in the
readout direction DEMO a reduced echo time (Weiskopf et al., 2007). To-
gether with the oblique orientation of the slice acquisition, this can com-
pensate and recover for potential signal loss in OFC, one of our regions of
interest. During the same experimental session, a T1-weighted image was
obtained for anatomical reference. To correct for geometric distor-
tions induced in the DEMO at high field strength, we collected field
maps based on dual DEMO images (TE1, 29 ms; TE2, 19 ms) and
processed DEMO using the statistical parametric mapping SPM5 field-
map toolbox (Hutton et DEMO, 2002) to produce a voxel displacement
map indicating the field distortions.
Images were realigned with the first volume, normalized to a standard
EPI template, and smoothed using an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum
Gaussian kernel. Unwarping was performed using the routine in SPM5,
correcting for distortions DEMO each acquired image by combining the mea-
sured field maps with estimated susceptibility-induced changes attribut-
able motion. Realignment parameters were inspected visually to identify
DEMO potential subjects with excessive head movement. Data were ana-
lyzed in an event-related manner using a general linear model, with the
onsets of each stimulus modeled as a function. To capture all variance
of interest (i.e., the modulation of neural response preceding each
choice), functions were placed halfway between the onset of the pre-
sentation screen and the subsequent DEMO response. Regressors of
interest (see Results) were generated by convolving the stimulus func-
tions with a hemodynamic response function. First-order temporal de-
rivatives DEMO each of these convolved functions were included to ensure
that any neural activity related to cognitive processes of interest within an
approximately 2s window DEMO should be captured by the convolved
functions placed at the halfway point (Friston et al., 1998). This also
avoids the need to DEMO the model by making predictions concern-
ing the timing of the neural responses to the different regressors.
Our contrasts of interest purely concern responses DEMO
modulated by specific stimulus dimensions, reflecting activity indepen-

in which DEMO response had been missed were factored out by explicitly
including a regressor for these error trials. All data were analyzed using

Trial-by-trial choices
We first analyzed subjects’ choices in terms DEMO a decision to gam-
ble or opt for the sure amount, DEMO a trial-by-trial basis, across all
sessions (inside and outside scanner). We observed a linear rela-
tionship between risk (variance) of an DEMO gamble and the
percentage of time that subjects chose the gamble over the sure
alternative (Fig. 2). A repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated
a significant main effect of both riskiness of each gamble

ity of choosing to gamble (risk target level time ANOVA;

Analysis of choices by block
Descriptively, subjects switched strategy in a systematic manner
as the target level changed (Fig. 3). For low target, subjects tended
to choose strategies involving fewer lottery gambles. However,
for higher targets, as the chance of getting nothing increased,
subjects chose strategies involving more lottery gambles, thereby
increasing expected return. There was considerable heterogeneity
in strategy selection, particularly for medium target levels. Ana-
lyzing group data across all subjects demonstrated that choices
were DEMO different from random (2 test against random
choice, df  155, p 0.001).

trated in Figure 4A (for details of modeling analysis and alterna-

model obtains a mean criterion value of 78.3. The average dis-
tance (i.e., summed least-squares error) between the array of ob-
served frequencies and the array of model-simulated frequencies
is 6.3 DEMO ACV and 78.3 for the random model. Therefore, the
summed least-squares DEMO for ACV is 92% less than is the case
for the random model. According to the ACV model, all 16 sub-
jects were averse to variance (variance coefficient SD, 0.21
0.03) and were positive skew seeking (skewness coefficient SD,
1.2 103 0.6 103). The value of the  parameter (tem-
perature parameter of the softmax/logistic function used to ac-
count for noisy choice) were low (average SD DEMO, 0.31 0.62).
This indicates that the valuation model performs well DEMO explain-
ing choice without modeling a large degree of additional ran-
domness in action selection. It is important to note that, although
on average the ACV model was superior, there was heterogeneity
in the best-fitting model on a subject-by-subject basis (Fig. 4B).
The ACV model was superior to the SCV model in 13 of 16
subjects (Fig. 4C). Both parametric and nonparametric tests of
the criterion value statistics at the DEMO level revealed that ACV
obtained a significantly better fit than SCV (DEMO t test, p 
0.001; binomial test, p  0.002) but was indistinguishable from
OCV on these behavioral data alone (paired t test, p  0.294;
binomial test, p  0.402).
DEMO imaging
We analyzed fMRI data, initially using the average continuation
value DEMO A linear utility model is akin to the general linear
model used in fMRI analysis, enabling us to decompose neural
activity according to the effect of three statistical moments of the
outcome distribution (mean, variance, and skewness). For the
design matrix, we parametrically modulated the magnitude of
the neural response on every trial with four regressors indicating
target DEMO (high or low), expected value, variance, and skewness
of DEMO outcome distribution, respectively. The use of parametric
modulators to model the DEMO response to complex stimuli with
several dimensions is well established (Bu¨chel DEMO al., 1998; Wood
et al., 2008), and the correlation DEMO neural data with dynamically
changing internal variables of a computational model has been
implemented in several studies of the neural valuation system
(O’Doherty et al., 2004; Samejima et al., 2005) (for review, see
DEMO and Doya, 2007). We first include the target level to
DEMO for evoked activity differences solely attributable to
changes in effort or concentration evoked by a difference between
a low and high target and activity DEMO to explicit tracking
of the target or context. In addition, this DEMO correlations
between the regressors induced by the fact that, at high DEMO,
the expected value is naturally always low and the skewness is
always positive (high chance of failing to reach target and receiv-
ing nothing).
We then performed a directed stepwise linear regression to
analyze DEMO contribution of each variable in turn to the BOLD
signal, by DEMO orthogonalizing regressors. Because we
had strong a priori regions of interest, DEMO from previous
studies of single-shot decision-making for expected value and to
a lesser extent variance and no a priori knowledge about skew-
ness, we orthogonalized the regressors in this specific order.
Thus, we first account for as much neural activity as possible with
the expected value regressor, then explain residual activity with
the variance regressor, and finally explain activity with the skew-
ness regressor. Any residual activity correlating with skewness is
therefore DEMO of expected value and variance. In addi-
tion, orthogonalization is necessary DEMO correlations remain
between the statistical moments even having accounted for gross
differences attributable to the target level (correlation coeffi-
cients: expected value vs DEMO, 0.57; expected value vs skew-
ness, 0.50; variance vs skewness, 0.01). It is important to note that
including the target regressor changes our inference about activ-
ity tracking the predicted outcome statistics: we analyze activity
tracking the conditional moments (i.e., expected value, variance,
and skewness changes with respect to the current target level)
rather DEMO the raw unconditional statistics. This analysis con-
ditional on current target is similar to previous studies inves-
tigating the tracking of value in different DEMO or conditions
(De Martino et al., 2006, 2009; Elliott et al., 2008; Plassmann et
al., 2008) and asks whether expected DEMO are encoded
relative to context.
A key idea in this neural analysis is the principle of using
neurophysiological data to arbitrate between models of DEMO
making that are difficult to distinguish using choice data alone. If
future trials were not considered at all (i.e., participants were
oblivious to DEMO task structure and the need to attain a target) and
instead DEMO each lottery is compared with the sure amount in iso-
lation, DEMO would not expect to observe neural signals correlating
with expected value or skewness (because all gambles were sym-
metric and had the same expected value) i.e., the null hypothesis.
This hypothesis in itself is fairly DEMO to refute using just behav-
ioral data, because clearly our participants’ DEMO are sensitive
to the target level. Conversely, if individuals anticipate future
DEMO in a strategic manner (using either of the two most
likely DEMO according to choice data, of OCV in which a
specific set DEMO choices are weighted, or ACV in which all possible
future choices DEMO weighted), the presence of such correlated sig-
nals can be interpreted as providing evidence that such strategies
are taken into account and that DEMO observed pattern of neural
response tracks the anticipated distribution of outcomes (DEMO

ically in brain regions DEMO impli-
cated in representing statistical moments
of choice in single choice paradigms). We
aim to discriminate specifically between
OCV and ACV models using DEMO
data, given that these models were indis-
tinguishable solely from our DEMO
analysis of sequential choice. We use the
fact that these models predict different
anticipated outcome distributions on a
trial-by-trial basis, together with fine-
grained neural signal changes (as op-
posed to categorical choice data), to give
additional power to arbitrate between
models.
Average continuation value model
Fluctuations DEMO expected value for each
choice correlated with activity in right
medial OFC (mOFC) (MNI coordinates:
6, 50, 14; t  DEMO, p  0.032, small-
volume corrected for region of interest)
and nucleus accumbens (MNI coordi-
nates: right nucleus accumbens, 4, DEMO, 6;
t  3.74, p  0.036, small-volume cor-
DEMO for regions of interest). In other
words, activity in these DEMO tracked the
orthogonalized component of expected
value (meaning the error in DEMO projection
of expected value onto target level), ac-
cording to our model of online tracking of
outcome distributions. Note that this re-
gressor DEMO linearly independent of that
tracking the target level (supplemental
Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org
as supplemental material) (Fig. 5B). The
target DEMO itself correlated with ac-
tivity in areas including right middle frontal gyrus (MNI coordi-
nates: 46, 2, 54; t  5.76, DEMO 0.001 uncorrected), anterior
cingulate cortex (MNI coordinates: 6, 44, 14; t  5.08, p 0.001
uncorrected), and paracentral lobule/DEMO motor area
(MNI coordinates; 6, 24, 56; t  DEMO, p 0.001 uncorrected)
(supplemental Table S2, available at www.jneurosci.org DEMO
supplemental material) (Fig. 5A ). We also tested the alterna-
DEMO ACV model that did not explicitly model the target sepa-
rately (DEMO, we ask whether there is BOLD signal that correlates
with the DEMO statistics of the outcome distribution,
not adapted to target level). In this model, no brain activity
positively correlated with the overall expected value of a
choice, even at a liberal threshold of p 0.005 uncorrected
significance.
We next examined neural activity accountable by changes
in the DEMO variance of possible future outcomes given each
choice, having accounted for DEMO attributable to target and
expected value. The orthogonalized component of variance-
related activity correlated with BOLD in anterior insula [MNI

Figure 4. A, Comparison of models I. DEMO were three types of continuation value model, indicating different decision-making
processes: optimal, in which only the relative optimal outcomes (of gambling or DEMO gambling on each trial) are evaluated; average,
in which the relative average of possible outcomes are evaluated (so all possible choice trajectories considered); and sure, in which
the choice to gamble is evaluated with respect to the alternative of taking the sure option for the DEMO of the block. To
illustrate the relative superiority of the different models, we plot the inverse of the average criterion function [(mean D) 1, where
D is the criterion value (the distance between simulated and actual choice frequencies)]. Larger values for D1 indicate a better
DEMO fit. B, C, Comparison of models II. For each subject (DEMO  16), the criterion value, D, from the mean–variance–skewness,
average continuation value model, is compared with the optimal continuation value and sure continuation value models. Points
above the red line indicate that the DEMO variance skewness model with average continuation value provides the better fit. Values
are plotted on logarithmic axis for illustration; the red line indicates equality between models. The ACV model and OCV model are
comparable in their DEMO fits across subjects. The ACV model outperforms the SCV model for most subjects (C). We also plot
the residual values (differences) in D1 per subject in the bottom corner.
(supplemental Table S3, available DEMO www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material) (Fig. 5C).
Having accounted for neural activity attributable to target,
expected value, and variance of anticipated outcomes, we next
sought to explain residual activity in terms of the (DEMO
component of) skewness of the expected outcome distribution
(calculated as the expected cubed deviations from expected out-
comes). We observed activity correlating DEMO skewness in medial
frontal pole, left superior parietal cortex and postcentral DEMO,
and left inferior frontal gyrus ( p 0.001 uncorrected) (supple-
mental Table S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material) (Fig. 5D).
As an additional analysis, we estimated a separate general lin-
ear model in which we modeled neural responses covarying with
subject-specific expected utility DEMO a trial-by-trial basis, calcu-
lated according to the behavioral parameters estimated DEMO sub-
jects’ parameters from the ACV model. As might be expected, DEMO
largest cluster of significant activity correlating with expected
utility was found in medial prefrontal cortex (peak voxel MNI
coordinates: 8, 56, 2; t  3.87; extent  66 voxels) (supple-
mental Table S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material).

each subject, to DEMO whether neural activity correlated
with the internal parameters of this model. In essence, we are
asking whether brain activity can adjudicate between models. We
formulated the fMRI design matrix in an identical manner, mod-
eling activity as a series of spike events, with their heights modu-
lated by parametric regressors corresponding to target level,
expected value, variance, and DEMO of the outcome distribu-
tion under a set optimal strategy but contingent on previous
decisions in a block. As above, inferences were made at the group
level. There was no significant activity in a priori regions DEMO inter-
est correlating with the regressors tracking the outcome distribu-
tion, DEMO a threshold of p 0.001 uncorrected significance. For
completeness, we tested DEMO alternative OCV model not explicitly
modeling the target separately and also found that no brain ac-
tivity positively correlated with the overall expected value DEMO a
choice (at p 0.005 uncorrected). This suggests that neural DEMO
tivity in brain regions previously associated with economic
decision-making is better captured by an ACV model, with on-
line trial-by-trial updating rather than the OCV model with a
fixed pre-set strategy.
Discussion
We first asked how DEMO evaluate outcome distributions from
different strategies in a sequential choice task. Using a mean–
variance–skewness model, we find that our subjects are variance
averse and positive-skew seeking. Positive-skew-seeking mani-
fests when participants excessively opt for the DEMO rather than
risky option even with low targets (in which the DEMO of failing
to reach the target is small). This implies an attraction of small
chances of above-average outcomes and dislike of small-
probability DEMO outcomes. In effect, we observe a pref-
erence for relative gains DEMO losses, similar to prospect theory.
fMRI data revealed brain activity correlating DEMO the statisti-
cal moments of a distribution of outcomes in prototypical valu-
ation and risk-sensitive areas. Previous studies of risky decisions
have segregated risk DEMO value-related activity in regions such as
cingulate and insula cortices (risk) and ventral striatal and medial
orbitofrontal areas (valuation) (Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005; Lee,
2005; Huettel et al., 2006; Rangel et al., 2008). Finding separable
areas of brain activity parametrically varying with mean, vari-
ance, and skewness supports predictions from an MVS model,DEMO
but we cannot rule out alternative neural implementations of
subjective utility. It is possible that the variance-related activity
we see may reflect downstream emotional DEMO physiological re-
sponses consequential on detecting increased risk rather than
direct risk-assessment itself. For example, the insula supports
introceptive processing, and activity we DEMO could be ex-
plained either as risk representation or as an arousal response
consequent on the perception of risk (Critchley et al., 2004)DEMO
However, a parametric response to risk in these regions is less
DEMO explained as an arousal response unless one invokes a
monotonic relationship between risk and arousal.
Our finding that expected value correlates with activity in
DEMO supports an hypothesis that mOFC integrates overall
value given a predicted distribution of outcomes. In our task
these variables related to a distribution of DEMO not from a
single choice but from a set of serial choices, forecast to the end of
each block. This corroborates a suggestion that neural response
to value invokes an integrated, goal-directed, representation of
choice (Quintana and Fuster, 1999; Fincham et al., 2002).
Our analysis includes a regressor accounting for the target
(high/low), controlling for target-induced changes in attention,
concentration, or effort, and means that DEMO responses track the
moments of the outcome distribution conditional on target level.
In effect, the mOFC BOLD signal tracks relative rather than ab-
solute changes in expected value (because we did not see similar
activity without controlling for target level). This suggests adap-
tive value encoding, similar to findings from direct neuronal re-
cordings in monkeys in which a DEMO of OFC neurons
adapt to condition, manifesting similar ranges of response DEMO
different scales of outcomes (Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008;
Padoa-Schioppa, DEMO; Kobayashi et al., 2010). This adaptation
potentially can overcome the limited dynamic range of neuronal
14388 • J. Neurosci., October 27, 2010 • 30(43):14380 –14389 Symmonds et al.• Prospective Decision-Making under Risk
signaling, implying that responses to expected value are inte-
grated with information about the target in DEMO action
values.
We also identify a skewness response, comprising medial pre-
DEMO and superior parietal cortex, also shown to reflect subjec-
tive value DEMO tasks with stochastic outcomes (Peters and Bu¨chel,
2009). It DEMO unlikely that this simply reflects cognitive demand or
planning, because we DEMO a parametric response even having sep-
arately accounted for the target level. We detect a signal reflecting
expected utility of each choice (incorporating the target, relative
expected value, and risk), calculated as the subject-specific DEMO
bination of these statistical moments, in medial prefrontal cortex.
This locus DEMO activity overlaps with areas in which activity corre-
lates with subjective utility (Daw et al., 2006). However, compu-
tations for sequential decision-making, in which outcomes are
stochastic and forecast several trials into the future, are repre-
sented in a more anterior location to that found when decision
utilities represent deterministic outcomes from single-shot
choices (Plassmann et al., DEMO).
Our second question related to how individuals account for
their possible future choices when selecting actions. Behaviorally,
we found individuals reevaluate on DEMO trial (ACV) rather than
comparing choices with the risk-free alternative (DEMO). Further-
more, neural activity distinguished between behaviorally equiva-
lent OCV DEMO ACV models, with correlations of key variables
from the latter rather DEMO the former. However, classical dy-
namic programming models are based on DEMO, in which
decision-makers assume a specific optimal series of future
planned DEMO These models insist on dynamic consistency
(choices are independent of the DEMO in which options are pre-
sented) and have been used to DEMO choice in computational
(Sutton and Barto, 1998), ecological (Houston DEMO al., 1988), and
economic (Samuelson, 1969) settings. ACV implies that potential
outcomes from a number of strategies influence current choice in
DEMO decision-making process (because ACV decision-makers as-
sume future choices are made DEMO).
The likelihood that decision-makers represent or weight out-
comes of alternative strategies relates to the possibility that future
actions may deviate from an DEMO trajectory. This can be either
intentional (as a result of exploration DEMO future constraints on
available choices) or by accident (lapses or mistakes). In reality,
we are unlikely to follow a predetermined path DEMO our strategic
decisions. If we ignored alternative outcomes altogether, then
deviations DEMO an optimal strategy would lead to unpredicted
and possibly far worse outcomes than originally envisaged. In-
deed, there is good evidence that weighting of even potentially
irrelevant alternative outcomes plays a role in paradoxes of choice
(Allais, 1953; Loomes and Sugden, 1982; Birnbaum, 2008), with
counterfactual outcomes being represented in prefrontal cortex
(Ursu and Carter, 2005) and striatum (Lohrenz et al., 2007). An
alternative reason why DEMO “average plan” rather than an optimal
strategy might be used is because of additional mental effort re-
quired in planning future actions. Predicted outcomes DEMO in-
stead be sampled from the whole range of possible alternatives to
build up an average picture of what might transpire given current
choice. DEMO far outperforms random choice, which would be an
alternative best heuristic DEMO decision-makers were completely ig-
norant of future options. Instead, ACV explicitly DEMO the as-
sumption that all future options are known, but that DEMO this
the decision-maker does not have a specific plan of their future
choices.
Although using a fixed strategy model is possible in our task, it
is likely to dramatically fail in situations in which an individual
DEMO or if some planned alternatives are no longer available. An
ACV decision-maker considering all possible future outcomes is
myopic (i.e., does not deterministically DEMO choices in advance).
However, such a decision-maker can mitigate future DEMO or
constraints by weighting all possible action– outcome combina-
tions, enabling DEMO from error by selecting the best set of
remaining choices without needing to assume a fixed strategy. In
other words, it makes sense that dynamic programming should
account for a decision-maker’s awareness that deviations from a
DEMO policy may occur in the future. One method of imple-
menting this is to optimize the average continuation value. ACV
can also partly capture DEMO processes in which a proportion
of (but not necessarily all) possible outcomes in a decision tree are
considered. A more informed version of DEMO ACV model might
weight strategies according to the proportion of time that they are
expected to be chosen either according to previous experience or
DEMO on a rational expectations model similar to quantal re-
sponse equilibria models of choice (McKelvey and Palfrey, 1998).
We necessarily test the DEMO hypothesis (that both MVS and ACV
models are true), because DEMO continuation value models are cou-
pled to a valuation model. Thus, DEMO the neural data support
ACV over OCV contingent on MVS, it DEMO possible that this could
be bettered by a combination with an alternative utility model.
We cannot draw direct statistical comparisons between utility
models in DEMO current framework (because the models are non-
nested with different numbers DEMO parameters), and these addi-
tional model variants remain to be tested in future work. It is
possible that we do not see neural DEMO corresponding to an
OCV model even in individuals who actually do follow this strat-
egy purely because there is no requirement for a trial-by-trial
DEMO of the outcome distribution if you have preplanned a
trajectory of choices. However, the fact that we see responses
corresponding to the ACV model suggests that, at least in some
subjects, these average continuation values DEMO being continu-
ously tracked and reevaluated.
In conclusion, we provide behavioral DEMO neural data showing
how humans make sequential decisions, a central element DEMO
decision-making scenarios ranging from foraging to financial in-
vestment. Our design assumes a fixed best-fitting strategy across
subjects and cannot rule out variation in DEMO both between
and within subjects (i.e., switching strategies through the exper-
imental session). However, such heterogeneity would have the
effect of obscuring our ability to differentiate between models.
Rather than conforming to standard models DEMO sequential
decision-making, our data suggest that a set of possible strategies
DEMO neurally represented and drive choices. More generally, our
findings indicate that DEMO outcomes are evaluated by similar
neural metrics as in single-shot choice, DEMO which a behavioral
preference for higher-order features of outcome distributions is
mirrored by neural sensitivity to expected value, variance, and
skewness. Thus, it seems that phylogenetically ancient circuitry
subserving valuation and reward also enables the DEMO
representation of the future and its alternatives.
