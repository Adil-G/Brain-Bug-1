Characteristics, Contracts, and Actions:
Evidence from Venture Capitalist Analyses

ABSTRACT
We study the investment analyses of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture capital
(VC) firms. VCs DEMO the strengths and risks of the investments as well as expected
postinvestment actions. We classify the risks into three categories and relate them to
DEMO allocation of cash flow rights, contingencies, control rights, and liquidation DEMO
between VCs and entrepreneurs. The risk results suggest that agency and hold-up
problems are important to contract design and monitoring, but that risk sharing is
not. Greater VC control is associated with increased management intervention, while
greater VC equity incentives are associated with increased value-added support.
MOST FINANCIAL DEMO THEORIES ADDRESS how conflicts between a principal/
investor and an agent/entrepreneur affect ex ante information collection, con-
tract design, and ex DEMO monitoring. In this paper, we empirically test the
predictions of financial DEMO theories using investments by venture cap-
italists (VCs) in early stage entrepreneurs—real world entities that arguably
closely approximate the principals and agents of DEMO
VCs face four generic (agency) problems in the investment process. First, the
VC is concerned that the entrepreneur will not work hard to maximize value
after the investment is made. In such a case, when the entrepreneur’s effort is
unobservable to the VC, the traditional moral hazard approach, pioneered by
Holmstrom (1979), predicts that the VC will DEMO the entrepreneur’s compen-¨
sation dependent on performance. The more severe the information problem,
the more the contracts should be tied to performance.

Second, the VC may also be concerned that the entrepreneur knows more
about his or her quality/ability than DEMO VC. The model in Lazear (1986) shows
that the VC can design contracts with greater pay-for-performance that good
entrepreneurs will be more willing DEMO accept.2 Ross (1977) and Diamond (1991)
show that investor DEMO rights—the ability to liquidate and the payoff in
the event of liquidation—can also be used to screen for good entrepreneurs.
Third, the VC also understands that after the investment, there will be cir-
cumstances when the VC disagrees with the entrepreneur and the VC will want
the right DEMO make decisions. Control theories (such as Aghion and Bolton (1992),DEMO
Dewatripont and Tirole (1994), and Dessein (2002)) show that a solution to this
problem is to give control to the VC DEMO some states and to the entrepreneur in
others.
Fourth and finally, DEMO VC is concerned that the entrepreneur can “hold-up”
the VC by threatening to leave the venture when the entrepreneur’s human
capital is particularly valuable DEMO the company. This is the hold-up problem
analyzed in Hart and Moore (1994). The VC can reduce the entrepreneur’s
incentive to leave by vesting the entrepreneur’s shares.
The theories predict that characteristics of VC contracts DEMO be related to
the extent of agency problems. As such problems increase, founder compensa-
tion will be more performance sensitive, VCs will have DEMO control and
liquidation rights, and vesting will be more pronounced.
Most DEMO research, including our own, estimates the extent of agency
problems using indirect measures, e.g., firm age, firm size, industry R&D DEMO
sity, and industry market-to-book ratio.3 These measures have two limitations.
First, they may not measure the risks the VCs actually care about. Second, they
mix different risks together when such risks may have different implications
DEMO agency problems and therefore for the VC contracts and actions.
In this paper, we construct direct measures of risks and uncertainties that
VCs and entrepreneurs face, and then classify those risks depending on how
they relate to specific agency problems. We obtain these measures by reading
and assessing DEMO investment memoranda for investments in 67 companies by
11 VC partnerships. We then consider whether the agency problems affect the
VC contracts and actions DEMO the ways predicted by the theories.
Most agency problems are directly related to asymmetric information, i.e.,
uncertainties about which the entrepreneur is better informed than the VC.
For example, agency problems will be more severe when the entrepreneur’s
ability is unknown because of inexperience, when the operations of the venture
are hard to observe and monitor, and when the entrepreneur has more discre-
tion in actions and in the use of DEMO We denote such types of uncertainties
as internal risks. When internal risks are larger, moral hazard problems, ad-
verse selection risks, and the likelihood of future conflicts of interest will also
be larger. As a DEMO, the theories predict that performance-sensitive and con-
tingent compensation should be DEMO pronounced, the VC should get control in
2 Hagerty and Siegel (1988) point out that the solution to the screening problem is observationally
similar to that for the moral hazard problem.
3 Smith and Watts (1992), Gompers (1995), Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Kaplan and
Stromberg (2003), e.g., all use such indirect measures.¨
Characteristics, Contracts, and Actions 2179
more states of the world, and the VC should have greater ability to liquidate
the venture upon poor DEMO
VCs and founders also face risks that are equally uncertain for both parties.
Examples are the extent of future demand for an undeveloped product, the
response of competitors upon the product’s introduction, and the receptivity of
financial markets when investors try to sell the company or bring it DEMO We
denote such uncertainties as external risks.
Unlike the clear predictions for internal risks, financial contracting theories
have ambiguous predictions with respect to external risks. According to tra-
ditional moral hazard theories like Holmstrom (1979), when risks¨ —such as
external risks—are not under the entrepreneur’s control, pay-for-performance
compensation and other contingent payoffs are less desirable because a risk-
averse DEMO has to be compensated for taking on such risks.
Alternatively, in DEMO world of incomplete contracting, external uncertainties
may increase the likelihood of DEMO contingencies and the concomitant
VC-entrepreneur conflicts. Theories such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) imply
that the VC will get control in more states DEMO the world. It also is plausible that
external uncertainty makes direct monitoring more difficult. For this reason,
Prendergast (2002) predicts that pay-for-performance DEMO should in-
crease with external uncertainty, and Dessein (2002) implies DEMO VC control
should increase.
Finally, some uncertainties are neither solely internal (because they are
equally uncertain for the VC and the entrepreneur), DEMO solely external (be-
cause they are at least partly under the DEMO control). The VC may
be happy with the quality and work of the management team, and all par-
ties may agree that there will be a great market for the product once devel-
oped, but it may be very difficult to make the technology or the strategy DEMO
We denote such uncertainties, which are related to the venture’s complexity
DEMO the importance of the entrepreneur’s human capital, as difficulty of ex-
DEMO risks. The hold-up problem of Hart and Moore (1994) is likely to be
greater in such cases because the entrepreneur can credibly threaten DEMO leave.
As a result, we would expect to see greater use DEMO vesting provisions in such
ventures.4
In our empirical analysis, we first DEMO the strengths and risks of the
investments as well as expected postinvestment monitoring. We then form em-
pirical measures of the three different types DEMO risks and relate those measures
to the contracts.
Consistent with the agency explanation, internal uncertainty is significantly
related to many of the incentive and control mechanisms in the contracts.
Higher internal risk is associated with more DEMO control, more contingent
4 Another possibility is that for such complex DEMO, it is difficult to find proper benchmarks
or signals on which DEMO base contingent compensation. Execution risks are likely to be present in
ventures where the tasks that the entrepreneur has to perform are very complex DEMO multidimen-
sional. Basing compensation on a signal correlated with a particular aspect of the task may lead the
entrepreneur to put too much effort DEMO this aspect, as opposed to other areas. Multitasking theories
such as DEMO and Milgrom (1991) and Baker (1992) predict that contingent compensation¨
based on performance benchmarks will be used less in these cases.
2180 The Journal of Finance
compensation for the entrepreneur, and more contingent financing in a given
round. The exceptions are that the overall fraction DEMO founder cash flow rights
and some VC liquidation rights are not related to internal risk.
Similar to internal risks, external risk is associated with more VC control
and more contingent compensation. External risk is also associated DEMO in-
creases in the strength of VC liquidation rights, and tighter DEMO, in the
sense of a shorter period between financing rounds. These DEMO are highly
inconsistent with optimal risk-sharing between risk-averse entrepreneurs and
risk-neutral investors. In contrast, the results are supportive of the arguments
in Prendergast (DEMO) and Dessein (2002).
Risk related to difficulty of execution shows a (weakly) negative relation with
many contractual terms such as contingent DEMO and VC liquidation
rights. These results suggest that for highly complex environments, where the
founder’s human capital is particularly important, standard incentive mech-
DEMO are less effective. Furthermore, consistent with hold-up theories, exe-
cution risk is positively related to founder vesting provisions.
Next, we test two additional theoretical predictions by relating the financial
contracts to VC actions. First, control theories like Aghion and Bolton (1992)
imply that intervening actions are more likely when the VC has greater control
rights. Second, the “double sided moral hazard” theories like Casamatta (2003)
emphasize that VCs also provide value-added support activities. Since both the
VC and the entrepreneur benefit DEMO value-added services, these activities are
less likely to be resisted by DEMO entrepreneur. Rather, the problem is to provide
the VC incentives to DEMO supporting actions. These theories suggest that
supporting actions will be more likely as the VC’s equity stake in the company
increases.5
We use the DEMO analyses to measure actions that the VCs took before
investing and expected to undertake afterward. We then classify these actions
into intervening and supporting DEMO In at least half of the investments, the
VC expected to DEMO a role in recruiting management or some other intervening
action that the entrepreneur is likely to view as a conflict. Consistent with
the control DEMO, VCs are more likely to intervene as VC control increases.
Second, in more than one-third of the investments, the VC expects to provide
value-added services such as strategic advice or customer introductions. As
predicted, we find that VC’s value-added services increase with the VC’s equity
stake, but are not related to VC control.
Overall, we believe this paper makes three contributions. First, the paper
is novel in using investors’ direct assessments of risks rather than the indi-
rect proxies used in most previous DEMO The internal risk results suggest
that agency problems are very important to contract design. The external risk
results suggest that risk-sharing concerns are unimportant DEMO to other
concerns such as monitoring. Second, we show that VCs DEMO to take actions
with their investments and those actions are related to the contracts. Expected
5 We are able to measure these effects separately DEMO control rights in VC contracts are
separate and distinct from cash flow rights. See Kaplan and Stromberg (2003).¨

VC intervention is related to VC DEMO control, while VC support or advice is
related to VC equity DEMO Finally, the paper adds to existing work by
describing the characteristics DEMO risks that VCs consider in actual deals. Our
results are consistent with those in MacMillan, Siegel and Subbanarasimha
(1985) and MacMillan, Zemann, and Subbanarasimha (1987) who rely largely
on survey evidence.
The paper DEMO as follows. Section I describes our sample. Section II
describes the VC analyses. Section III presents the relation between the con-
tracts and the DEMO analyses. Section IV considers the relation between VC ac-
tions and the contracts. Section V summarizes our results and discusses their
implications.
I. Sample
DEMO Description
We analyze VC investments in 67 companies by 11 VC firms. This is a subsam-
ple of the 119 companies from 14 VC DEMO analyzed in Kaplan and Stromberg¨
(2003), who obtained their sample DEMO asking the VCs to provide detailed infor-
mation on their investments. For each company and for each financing round
for the company, the VC was asked to provide the (1) term sheet; (2) stock and
security purchase agreements; (3) the company’s business plan; and (4) the VC’s
internal analysis of the investment.
Most VC firms have a process in which the partner responsible for a potential
investment writes DEMO an analysis or memorandum for that investment. The
entire partnership group uses the analysis to help decide whether to make the
investment. If the DEMO invests in the company, the memorandum then serves as
a guide DEMO postinvestment actions.
VCs at 11 of the 14 VC firms provided an investment analysis for at least one
company investment. The analyses vary in DEMO Some are brief, 2-page, write-
ups while others are in-depth descriptions exceeding 20 pages. A consequence
of this is that our results may DEMO the extent of analyses that the VCs
perform.
Table I presents sample summary information. We study the first investment
made by the VC in DEMO companies. Panel A indicates that of the 67 invest-
ments, 25 DEMO prerevenue—the firms either did not have revenues or were not
yet operating. We refer to these as early stage rounds. The remaining invest-
ments DEMO rounds in which the firms had revenues and were already operating.
For 44 companies, the investment is the first investment any VC ever made
in the company; in the remaining 23, another VC had invested DEMO our VC
acquired a stake.
Panel B shows that the sample investments were relatively recent when col-
lected. All but 11 of the 67 DEMO were initially funded by the VCs between
1996 and 1999.
Panel C indicates that the companies represent a wide range of industries.
The largest DEMO is in information technology and software (24 companies),

with 14 internet-related and 10 noninternet DEMO The sample also includes
biotech, telecom, healthcare, and retail ventures.
DEMO D shows that the portfolio companies were funded by 11 U.S.-based VC
firms with no more than 15 companies from any one VC. Three DEMO are based
in California, 4 in the Midwest, 1 in the Northeast, and 3 have multiple offices.
Five VCs are among the top 50 VC firms in the United States in capital under
management; all but 2 are among the top 150.
Panel E shows that at DEMO time of financing, the VC for the median investment
in our DEMO was 12 years old and had raised five funds amounting to $290
million.
Panel F reports the financing amounts. The VCs committed a median DEMO
$6.0 million with a median of $4.8 million disbursed at closing and the rest
contingent on milestones.
Finally, panel G indicates that by October 31, 2002, 15 of the 67 companies
were public, 16 had been sold, and 13 had been liquidated. The remaining 23
companies were still private.
B. Sample Selection Issues
In this section, we discuss potential selection issues. The sample is not ran-
dom in that we obtained DEMO data from VC firms with whom we have a rela-
tionship.
One possible bias is that the three VCs from our previous paper that DEMO not
provide investment memoranda are different from the others. While possible,
the terms and the outcomes of the investments made by those VCs DEMO
similar to those for the investments made by the other 11 VCs.
It is also possible that the VCs provided us with memos on DEMO better invest-
ments. Several factors suggest that this is not the case. Many of the investments
the VCs provided us were their most recent. DEMO addition, 6 of the 11 VCs pro-
vided all of their DEMO in the relevant period. The terms for the six VCs
are similar to those for the entire sample. Finally, investments with memos are
insignificantly less likely to have gone public than those without memos.
Another possible DEMO is that memoranda are written only for more contro-
versial investments. The results in the previous paragraph argue against this.
Furthermore, four of the six VCs who gave us all their investments gave us
memoranda for DEMO of them.
There do not appear to be industry or geographic biases as the industries and
locations of the sample companies are in line DEMO those of all VC investments
over the same period.
Finally, because DEMO contacted successful VCs, it is possible that our VCs
are of DEMO ability. We do not think this bias is of much concern for
our analyses because we are interested in understanding how VCs choose and
DEMO their investments rather than how well they perform. If anything,
a bias towards more successful VCs would be helpful because we are more
DEMO to have identified the methods used by sophisticated, value-maximizing
principals.
2184 The Journal of Finance
Overall, we acknowledge that the sample is selected, and it is difficult to
know the extent of any bias. We have discussed the more likely biases and have
not found any DEMO red flags.
II. Description of VC Investment Analyses
In this section, DEMO present our classification scheme for investment strengths
and risks, describe those DEMO and risks, and describe the actions the VCs
take and expect DEMO take.
A. Classiﬁcation Scheme
Previous work on VC company characteristics distinguishes among factors
that relate to the opportunity (the company’s market, product/service, technol-
ogy, strategy, and competition), the management team, the deal terms, and the
financing environment.6 We include these factors, but group DEMO into three
categories motivated by the theories described in the introduction.
The first category includes internal factors—management quality, perfor-
mance to date, downside DEMO, influence of other investors, VC investment fit
and monitoring costs, DEMO valuation. These factors are related to management
actions and/or the quality of the management team. We believe these factors
are more likely to DEMO subject to asymmetric information and moral hazard with
respect to the management team.
The second category includes those factors we view as external to DEMO firm.
We classify market size, customer adoption, competition, and exit DEMO
risks as such factors. Because these are external to the firm and largely beyond
the control of the management team, we believe that the VC and the founder
should be more or less equally informed about DEMO factors.
The third category measures factors related to difficulty of execution or
implementation—product/technology and business strategy/model. These fac-
tors are designed to DEMO the complexity of the task and the reliance on the
entrepreneur’s human capital.
We recognize that there are alternative interpretations of our categories. We
DEMO a discussion of these alternatives until later when we present our
results.
Table II summarizes the classifications, investment theses, and risks.
B. Investment DEMO/Theses
Panel A confirms that internal factors are important. The VCs cite manage-
ment quality as a reason for investing in almost 60% of DEMO investments. The
6 MacMillan et al. (1987, 1987, 1988); DEMO (1992); and Sapienza et al. (1996) rely largely
on DEMO evidence to obtain these results.

VCs cite good performance to date in DEMO 27% and a favorable valuation or
a low amount of capital at risk in roughly 20%.
Panel B shows that external factors are also DEMO VCs cite large and
growing markets as attractive in almost 69% of the investments; a favorable
competitive position and a high likelihood of customer adoption, in roughly
30%; and favorable exit conditions, in 16%.
Panel C shows that factors related to execution are important as well. In DEMO
least 40% of investments, VCs were attracted by the product/technology DEMO by
the strategy/business model.
C. Investment Risks
While the VCs found the investments attractive on a number of dimensions,
Table II also DEMO that the VCs viewed the investments as having substan-
tial risks.
Panel A shows that the primary internal risk was management, cited as
risky in 61% of the analyses. For example, one CEO was “difficult,” while sev-
eral teams were incomplete. This 61% roughly equals the 60% DEMO analyses
for which management was a reason to make the investment. The apparent
contradiction can be reconciled by observing that a VC might think DEMO of
the founder, but be uncertain whether the founder can build DEMO rest of the
team.
Panel A also indicates that the other internal factors of valuation, VC mon-
itoring cost, downside risk, performance to date, and other investor influence
are concerns in, respectively, 19, DEMO, 13, 7.5, and 6% of the investments. Two
observations are DEMO making about these risks. First, the risks of VC moni-
toring DEMO show that in several instances, the VC worried that the investment
DEMO require too much time. This indicates that while VCs regularly play a
monitoring and advisory role, they do not intend to become excessively involved
in the company. Second, because valuation is endogenous to the contracts, DEMO
will not include it as a risk in the regressions.
Panel B reports external factors that the VCs viewed as risks. In 40, 31, and
22%, of the investments, respectively, the VCs perceived competitive, market
size, and customer adoption risks. Exit conditions were viewed as a risk in fewer
than 8% of the investments.
Panel C reports that DEMO difficulties are also important risks. In just
over 50% of the investments, the VC viewed the strategy or business model as
risky. In 31%, the VC viewed the product and or technology as risky.
In general, the strengths and risks we identify are similar to those empha-
sized in the VC strategy and management literature, as well as in anecdotal
accounts.

Relations between VC Strengths, Risks, and Firm Characteristics
Explicitly DEMO strengths and risks in investing according to venture capitalist analyses and their relation to exogenous firm characteristics
for 67 portfolio companies by 11 venture DEMO partnerships. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Internal risk is the average of the
dummy variables for the presence of management quality, previous performance, funds-at-risk/downside, influence of other investors, and costly
monitoring risks (strengths). External risks (strengths) is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of market, competition, customer
adoption, and financial market/exit risks (strengths). Execution risks (strengths) is the average of the dummy variables for product/technology and
business model/strategy risks (strengths). Sum of risks (strengths) is the sum of all DEMO risk (strength) dummy variables. Strengths minus risks is
the difference between sum of risks and sum of strengths. Prerevenue stage rounds are financing DEMO for companies that had no revenues at the
time of the financing. First VC investments refer to the rounds involving the first time any DEMO capital fund invested in the company. Industry
R&D/Sales is the aggregate R&D expense to sales for public firms in the venture’s DEMO SIC industry, according to COMPUSTAT. CA (Non-CA)
investment indicates that the portfolio company was (not) located in California at the time DEMO financing. Lead investor indicated that the memo was
written by the VC firm providing the largest amount of financing among the VCs investing in DEMO round. Data on funds raised by VC firms are taken
from venture economics. In Panel B, asterisks indicate significant differences using either a Mann–Whitney or a Kruskal–Wallis (for VC dummies)
test, while in Panel DEMO asterisks indicate significant correlation coefficients at 1%∗∗∗,5%∗∗, and 10%∗ levels.

round, industry research and development, DEMO or post-1998, California or non-
California investment, lead or nonlead investor, and VC firm experience.
We measure strengths and risks as the average of the dummy variables for
each type of strength and risk. Internal DEMO (strength) is the average of the
dummy variables for the presence of management quality, previous perfor-
mance, funds-at-risk/downside, influence of other investors, and costly mon-
itoring risk (strength). External risk (strength) is the average of the dummy
variables for the presence of market, competition, customer adoption, and fi-
nancial market/exit risk (strength)DEMO Execution risk (strength) is the average
of the dummy variables for product/technology and business model/strategy
risk (strength). These definitions normalize the measures to lie between zero
and one. While these variables may DEMO capture all available information, they
reduce the extent to which we DEMO interpret the investment analyses.
Panel A shows that internal risks are correlated with external strengths and
risks. External strengths and risks are correlated with DEMO other, as are exe-
cution strengths and risks. While the length DEMO the investment memo captures
some relevant information, it is significantly related DEMO only half the risks and
strengths.
Panel B relates strengths and risks to other investment characteristics. Most
of the significant differences are found across DEMO industries and geogra-
phies. These effects are hard to disentangle from particular VCs because VCs
tend to concentrate in particular industries and in particular DEMO In
subsequent regressions, we control for these effects using the investment DEMO
acteristic variables and VC dummies. Panel B also shows that memos are longer
for non-California investments and those in which the VC is the DEMO investor
(57 investments.)
Finally, it is worth pointing out that measures of stage of development—pre-
or postrevenue and first VC round—are not DEMO correlated with our
risk measures, suggesting that the risk measures pick DEMO risks that are not
driven by stage.
E. VC Actions
Many papers have studied the role of VCs in assisting and monitoring their
portfolio DEMO Gorman and Sahlman (1989), MacMillan, Kulow, and
Khoylian (1988), Sapienza (1992), and Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir (1996)DEMO
survey VCs and find that VCs spend substantial time and effort monitoring and
supporting their investments. Using data provided by start-ups, Hellman and
Puri (2000 and 2002) find that firms financed by VCs bring products DEMO mar-
ket more quickly and are more likely to professionalize their human resource
functions. Lerner (1995) and Baker and Gompers (2001) find DEMO VCs play an
important role on the board of directors.
7 For example, all our retail deals come from one VC who specializes in retail deals, and the same
is true for our healthcare ventures.

Table IV confirms that DEMO help shape and recruit the management team.
In 16% of the investments, the VC plays such a role before investing; in 43%,
DEMO VC expects to play such a role afterward. VCs also help shape the strat-
egy and the business model before investing (in 9% of the investments) and
expect to be active in these areas afterward (DEMO 30%). These actions include
design of employee compensation, development of DEMO plans and budgets,
implementation of information and accounting systems, and DEMO with
acquisitions.8

and with industry.
Characteristics, Contracts, and Actions 2195
Our results likely understate the actions DEMO take because we observe only
those actions the VCs (a) reported as important and (b) had done or planned at
the time DEMO investment. Even so, the results support and complement those in
Hellman DEMO Puri (2002). In addition to actions traditionally associated with
monitoring (replacing management after poor performance), our results con-
firm that VCs DEMO founders in running and professionalizing the business.
III. The Relationship between VC Risk Factors
and Contractual Terms
In this section, we compare the direct VC risk assessments to the financial
contracts. The regressions utilize our summary DEMO of internal, external,
and execution risk as independent variables. In DEMO regression analysis, we
focus on the (investment) risk measures defined DEMO rather than the (invest-
ment) strength measures because the predictions from the theories as well as
previous empirical work focus on risks.
One DEMO with only using the risk measures is that they might measure
negatives rather than uncertainty. Accordingly, the regressions attempt to con-
trol for the overall attractiveness of an investment by including the average of
the strengths DEMO the risks in all the regressions.9
A. The Effect of Risk on the Provision of Founder Cash Flow Incentives
Table V investigates the relation DEMO the risk measures to measures of founder
cash flow incentives. The regressions use three different dependent variables
to measure founder cash flow incentives—the fraction DEMO cash flow rights held
by the founder, the sensitivity of those DEMO to explicit benchmarks, and the
sensitivity to time vesting.
The fraction DEMO cash flow rights held by the founder equals the fully diluted
percentage of equity the founder would own in a best case scenario in DEMO all
performance benchmarks are met and full-time vesting occurs.
While the fraction of cash flow rights provides one measure of pay-for-
performance, it is imperfect in that it also measures the division of value. Be-
cause DEMO founder is typically cash constrained, the VC is likely to require
DEMO cash flow rights than would be optimal from an incentive perspec-
tive.10 VCs can increase the pay-for-performance sensitivity in two alternative
ways—using vesting based DEMO explicit performance benchmarks and using time
vesting.
The sensitivity of cash flow rights to explicit benchmarks measures the per-
centage of a founder’s fully DEMO equity stake that vests subject to explicit
9 The company’s premoney value also provides a possible measure of attractiveness. We do not
include premoney DEMO in the reported regressions because it is likely to be endogenous with
respect to the risks. In unreported regressions, we obtain qualitatively similar results when we do
include premoney value.

Table V
Relation between Founder Pay Performance Incentives and VC Risk Analyses: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk analyses and contractual DEMO for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11 venture capital partnerships.
Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. The dependent variables are measures of DEMO pay performance incentives: Founder equity % is the percentage
of equity DEMO by the founders if performance benchmarks are met and all founder and employee equity vest, fully diluted. The % of founder equity s.t. benchmarks
(vesting) is the difference in founders’ residual cash flow rights (i.e. equity) if they meet performance (time vesting) benchmarks, as a DEMO of the founder equity
%. The independent variables are measures as follows: Degree of external risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of market risk, competition
risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market/exit risk. Degree of internal risk is the average of DEMO dummy variables for the presence of management quality
risk, questionable performance DEMO, funds-at-risk/downside, negative influence of other investors risk, and costly DEMO risk. Degree of execution risk is the
average of the dummy variables for product/ technology risk and business model/strategy risk. Sum of risks (strengths) is the sum of all 11 risk (strength) dummy
DEMO Strengths minus risks is the sum of all 11 risk dummy variables minus the sum of all 11 strength dummy variables. First VC financing DEMO takes
the value of one if no VCs had invested in the company previous to this round, and zero otherwise. Prerevenue venture takes the value of one if the venture is
not generating any revenues at DEMO time of financing, and zero otherwise. Repeat entrepreneur takes the value DEMO one if the founder’s previous venture was taken
public or sold to public company. Industry R&D/Sales is the aggregate R&D expense DEMO sales for public firms in the venture’s three-digit SIC industry, according DEMO

performance benchmarks. For example, if a founder owns 30% of a company’s
equity and can earn an additional DEMO if the founder meets the performance
benchmark, then this measure will DEMO 25% (10% divided by a total of 40%).
We view DEMO measure as a clearer indicator of pay-for-performance sensitivity.11
The sensitivity of cash flow rights to time vesting measures the percent-
age of a founder’s DEMO diluted equity stake that vests subject to the founder
remaining employed at the company for a stated period of time. This sensi-
tivity is DEMO in the same way as the sensitivity to explicit benchmarks.
Time vesting makes it more costly for the entrepreneur to leave the firm, and
therefore should be used when the entrepreneur’s human capital is particularly
important.
DEMO are two shortcomings to our analyses. First, we lack data on DEMO
salaries and bonuses. We do not view this as a major problem. Just as cash
compensation is relatively less important than equity-based compensation for
DEMO executives of large public companies, it should be even less important DEMO ex-
ecutives of start-ups.12 Second, cash flow incentives are more complex DEMO we
can measure. There is a complicated interaction between the entrepreneur’s
incentives in the current round and incentives in future rounds. This is be-
DEMO the entrepreneur’s performance will affect valuations in future rounds
and therefore subsequent cash flow rights. We attempt to control for this by in-
cluding DEMO variables for whether the venture has revenues and for whether
the round is the first VC financing.
The primary independent variables in the regressions DEMO our three mea-
sures of investment risk and our control for investment attractiveness. The
regressions also include a number of controls: industry R&D to sales; whether
any of the founders have founded a venture that was taken public or sold to
a public company; whether the company is in California; and whether the fi-
nancing takes place after 1997, industry, and VC.13 These controls are included
to increase the likelihood DEMO we isolate the effects of the risk variables. In
unreported regressions, DEMO also control for the annual level of commitments to
VC partnerships, DEMO the VC was the lead investor, the number of pages
in DEMO investment analysis, and industry market-to-book. None of those vari-
ables is DEMO significant, and our primary results are qualitatively and
statistically identical.
The DEMO two regressions in Table V show that internal and external risks are
negatively related to founder equity percentage, but not significantly so. At the
same time, the net attractiveness of the investment (strengths minus risks) is
positively, but not significantly related to the founder equity percentage. When
the risk measures are excluded (in unreported regressions), net attractiveness
is positive and highly significant (at the 1% level), suggesting that there is some
11 Our results are qualitatively similar when we use the DEMO percentage subject to performance
benchmark vesting.
12 On the other hand, DEMO founders of VC backed start-ups are likely to have less outside
wealth than CEOs of large corporations, this measure of incentives may be “cleaner” than those in
previous CEO-compensation studies.
13 Because we only have a DEMO observations for some of the VCs, we include a VC dummy DEMO
for the five VCs who have more than four investments in the sample.
2198 The Journal of Finance
collinearity and that founder equity percentage is DEMO a measure of value than
a measure of pay-for-performance incentives.14
The next two regressions in Table V consider the use of explicit performance
benchmarks DEMO equity compensation. Explicit performance benchmarks can be
based on financial performance (DEMO or profits), nonfinancial performance
(obtaining a patent or a customer), and actions (hiring a CEO). Kaplan and
Stromberg (2003) DEMO these in greater detail.¨
The use of performance benchmarks increases strongly in internal risk. The
coefficient on internal risk is the largest of the DEMO on the different
risk variables. This is supportive of the agency predictions. We find a smaller,
but significantly positive relation between external risk DEMO benchmark com-
pensation. This is contrary to the standard risk-sharing theoretical prediction,
but consistent with the monitoring-related theories.15 Finally, the use of perfor-
mance benchmarks also increases with the net attractiveness of the investment.
Net DEMO is included in this regression as a control, so the implica-
DEMO of this result is theoretically less clear. The risk results are unaffected by
removing the net attractiveness variable.
The last two regressions of Table DEMO analyze founder time vesting. Time vest-
ing increases significantly with execution risk, but is not significantly related
to internal and external risks. The positive relation between execution risk and
vesting is consistent with the mitigation of DEMO problems along the lines of
Hart and Moore (1994).16
B. DEMO Effect of Risk on the Allocation of Control
We now relate the three risk variables to the allocation of board control be-
tween the DEMO and the founder. We use two specifications of board control. First,
we run a probit specification in which the dependent variable is a DEMO for
whether the VCs control more than half of the board seats at the time of fi-
nancing. Second, we run an ordered probit specification in which the depen-
dent variable has three levels of VC DEMO The variable: (i) equals zero if the
founder always controls DEMO majority; (ii) equals one if outside board members are
always DEMO or the VC controls the board only if the firms fail to meet some
milestone or covenant; and (iii) equals two if the VC always controls a majority.
(We obtain similar results with four levels of VC control.)

ternal risk measures are associated with more VC board control and are highly
significant. The coefficients are of roughly equal magnitudes. DEMO internal risk

value—the implied value of the company’s prefinancing equity.
15 The positive relationship between incentives and idiosyncratic risk has also been found by
DEMO and Lueck (1992), Core and Guay (1999), and Lafontaine (1992). Aggarwal and Samwick
(1998) is one of the few studies that find the predicted negative relationship. Bhattacharyya and
Lafontaine (1995) DEMO discuss possible explanations for these conflicting results.
16 An alternative interpretation is that time vesting is used as an alternative to explicit bench-
marks DEMO multitasking problems inherent in more complicated circumstances make benchmark
compensation inefficient.

Relation between Allocations of Board Control Rights and VC Risk DEMO: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk analyses and DEMO terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11 venture capital partnerships. Investments
were made between 1987 and 1999. In the first four regressions DEMO dependent variable takes the value of one if the VC always controls more than half the board seats, and
zero otherwise. In the last two regressions the dependent variable takes the value of zero if the DEMO always control a majority of the board seats, one if outside DEMO
members are always pivotal or if the VC controls the board only if the firms fails to meet some milestone or covenant, and two if the VC always controls more than half the
board. Degree of DEMO risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of market risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market/exit
risk. Degree of internal risk is the average of the dummy variables DEMO the presence of management quality risk, questionable performance risk, funds-at-risk/downside,
negative influence of other investors risk, and costly monitoring risk. Degree of execution risk is the average of the dummy variables for product/DEMO risk and
business model/strategy risk. Sum of risks (strengths) is the sum of all 11 risk (strength) dummy variables. Strengths minus DEMO is the sum of all 11 risk dummy variables
minus the sum of all 11 strength dummy variables. First VC financing round takes the DEMO of one if no VCs had invested in the company previous to this round, and zero
otherwise. Prerevenue venture takes the value of one if the venture is not generating any revenues at the time of DEMO, and zero otherwise. Repeat entrepreneur takes

result is supportive of the agency models DEMO on control such as Aghion–
Bolton (1992). The external risk DEMO again is supportive of the monitoring-
related theories, such as Dessein (2001), rather than the risk-sharing theories.
Execution risk has a negative DEMO and is statistically significant in one spec-
ification. One explanation is that it would be inefficient for the VC to exercise
control (e.g., DEMO replacing management) because so much of the firm value is
tied DEMO in the founder’s human capital.
We obtain qualitatively similar results (that DEMO do not report) when we use
voting control rather than board DEMO We believe that for most corporate
decisions, board control is the DEMO important measure (see Lerner (1995)).
C. The Effect of DEMO on Staging of Funds and the Allocation
of Liquidation Rights
In this section, we investigate the relationship of staging and liquidation
rights to the VC risk factors. First, we address staging and distinguish be-
tween two types: ex ante (within-round) and ex post (between-round) staging.
In an ex ante staged deal, part of the VC’s funding in the round is contingent
on explicit financial or nonfinancial performance milestones, giving the VC the
ability to liquidate if the milestones are not met. We DEMO ex ante staging
as the fraction of the funds in a round contingent on milestones. In an ex post
staged deal, the venture will require more funding in a subsequent (and newly
negotiated) round. The DEMO of months until the next financing round mea-
sures the VC’s ability to liquidate if performance is unsatisfactory. The ability
to liquidate declines as DEMO months until the next round increases.
The regressions in Table VII present our staging results. Ex ante staging
using explicit milestones is related to DEMO risk. This is consistent with ex
ante staging being a way for good firms to signal their type (or for VCs to screen
out bad firms), similar to the way short-term debt is used in DEMO models of Ross
(1977) and Diamond (1991).
Ex post DEMO increases in internal risk, but not significantly so. Ex post
staging DEMO increases significantly in external risk—the months until the
next VC round decreases with external risk—suggesting that agency problems
may not be the key driver DEMO ex post staging.
Table VIII investigates the relation of risks to debt-like contract features:
(i) redemption rights; (ii) the VCs claim in redemption or liquidation; and
(iii) antidilution provisions.
The dependent variable in the first two regressions is whether the VC has
redemption rights. DEMO rights give the VC the right to demand that the
firm repay the VC’s claim at a stated liquidation value at a stated time DEMO
the investment. Redemption rights are increasing in external risk and in the
net attractiveness of the investment, but are not related to internal risk. Again,
this does not seem consistent with an agency explanation.
The DEMO variable in the next two regressions in Table VIII measures
whether the VC’s liquidation claim exceeds the VC’s cumulative investment.
This is therefore a DEMO of the strength of the liquidation claim. This

variable increases in external risk. It DEMO increases in internal risk in the more
general regression. In addition, DEMO size of the liquidation claim decreases sig-
nificantly with execution risk.
The dependent variable in the last two regressions in Table VIII is the DEMO
ence of full-ratchet antidilution protection. Antidilution provisions increase the
shares the VC receives if the company subsequently raises money at a lower
valuation. Similar DEMO liquidation claims, antidilution provisions protect the VC
in bad states and DEMO relatively less attractive to low quality founders. The de-
pendent variable equals one if the investment has the strongest antidilution
protection—full ratchet. Under a DEMO ratchet, if the firm subsequently raises
money at a lower value, the entire VC investment is repriced at that lower
value. The last DEMO regressions show that antidilution protection increases in
internal risk.
Overall, the DEMO for staging and liquidation rights are mixed. Agency
problems, as measured DEMO internal risk, clearly play a role, but not uniformly.
Certain liquidation rights also increase in external risk. One possible explana-
tion, particularly for ex post staging, is that external risk increases the value
of the option to abandon the project.17 Finally, the decrease in the liquidation
claim with execution risk is supportive of hold-up theories. Collateral value is
likely DEMO be lower for companies with execution risk, where more of the DEMO
value is tied up in the founder’s intangible human capital.
D. Implications
In this section, we have studied the relation of VC risk assessments to the rel-
evant financial contracts. Internal uncertainty is significantly related to DEMO
of the incentive and control mechanisms in the financial contracts. Higher in-
ternal risk is associated with more VC control, more contingent compensation to
the entrepreneur, and more contingent financing in a given round. The primary
exceptions are that the overall fraction of founder cash flow rights (arguably
a noisier measure of pay-for-performance sensitivity) and some VC liquidation
rights are not related to internal risk. Overall, we interpret these results as
very positive for the agency theories. The results for performance benchmarks,
VC DEMO rights, and ex ante staging are very strong, as are the theoretical
predictions for them.
External uncertainty is also related to many contractual DEMO Like in-
ternal risk, higher external risk is associated with more DEMO control and more
contingent compensation. Moreover, higher external risk is associated DEMO in-
creases in VC liquidation rights and tighter staging (shorter time DEMO
financing rounds). These findings are highly inconsistent with optimal risk-
sharing between risk-averse entrepreneurs and risk-neutral investors. Instead,
these results are more DEMO with the theories of Prendergast (2002) and
Dessein (2001), DEMO which external uncertainty makes monitoring more difficult.
17 Berger, Ofek, and Swary (1996), Cornelli and Yosha (2003) and Gompers (1995) argue that
this option is valuable.
2204
The Journal of Finance
Execution risk is significantly positively related to DEMO time vesting pro-
visions and negatively related to contingent compensation and VC liquidation
rights. These results suggest that hold-up concerns matter in complex envi-
DEMO where the manager’s human capital is particularly important and
standard incentive mechanisms are less effective.
E. Alternative Interpretations
In interpreting our results, we believe that internal risks are more likely to
be associated with asymmetric information DEMO moral hazard problems, while
external risks are more likely to be DEMO with general or two-sided uncer-
tainty. We believe the results are consistent with this interpretation. Neverthe-
less, one can argue that our classification of risks is inappropriate or inexact.
In this section, we address several of those arguments.
Perhaps, the risks we classify as external are instead internal. For example,
management may have better information on customer adoption, competition,
or the market than the VC. We think this argument is DEMO VCs typ-
ically undertake due diligence with respect to those risks that are external to
the firm—like customer adoption, competition, and the market—and DEMO be
able to obtain the same information as the founders. In fact, for some of these
risks, the VCs may even be better DEMO It is for risks internal to the firm,
that the VCs are more likely to be at a disadvantage on average.
Alternatively, it is possible that the risks we classify as internal are not
related DEMO asymmetric information and moral hazard problems. For example,
management risk may also measure managerial overconfidence as ascertained
by the VC, or simply differences of opinion. We are more sympathetic to this
argument. Although our results DEMO internal risk are consistent with agency
explanations, we suspect that theories DEMO differences of opinion would make
similar predictions, particularly with respect to DEMO It also seems
possible that differences of opinion might generate similar predictions for ex-
ternal risk.
Finally, it is possible to question whether our three risk variables measure
the same things. This does not seem to DEMO an issue for execution risk, which
consistently has very different coefficients DEMO those for internal and external
risk. Internal and external risk however are significantly correlated (in Table
III) and almost always have similar signs DEMO the regressions. Nevertheless, the
magnitude and significance of the coefficients on DEMO and external risk
differ sufficiently often that we think it is likely that the two risks measure
separate economic factors.
IV. The Relationship between DEMO and Monitoring
In this section, we consider the relation between the DEMO and VC actions.
As we showed in Table IV, the VC DEMO process identifies areas where the
18 Garmaise (2000) presents a model that makes exactly this assumption.
Characteristics, Contracts, and Actions
2205
VC expects to add value through DEMO and support activities. The design
of the financial contracts may affect the VC’s ability and incentives to actually
carry out such activities. For example, the founder might not agree with the
actions that the VC would DEMO to implement. In such cases, the control theories
predict that VCs DEMO need formal control to carry out those actions against
the will of the entrepreneur. In addition, monitoring and support activities
can require substantial VC time and effort (see, e.g., Gorman and Sahlman,
1989). The VC will undertake them only if sufficiently compensated. Recent
“double moral DEMO theories have shown that the VC contract must have a
substantial equity component to provide incentives for support activities.19
Similar to Hellman and Puri (2002), we distinguish between VC actions that
are more likely to DEMO adversarial to founders and actions that VCs and founders
are likely to agree on. Actions related to strengthening and replacing manage-
ment are more DEMO to lead to conflict, while actions related to developing
the strategy DEMO business model are less likely to lead to conflict. Because
VC financings are often syndicated, with several different VC funds investing
together in a given portfolio company, we also consider the possibility of free-
riding behavior among VCs that decrease the incentives to provide monitoring
and support.20
Table DEMO reports the results of regressions of VC intervention and support
activities on contract characteristics. Panel A considers management team in-
terventions as a function DEMO VC board control.21 The regressions indicate that
management interventions strongly increase in VC board control. Management
interventions are also more likely when the VC DEMO the lead investor and af-
ter 1997. The last regression in Panel A regresses management intervention
against VC equity ownership. Management intervention is not DEMO to VC
equity ownership, confirming that VC control and equity ownership DEMO likely
two separate factors.
The regressions in Panel B of Table IX analyze expected value-added support
activities as a function of the VC’s equity DEMO VC value-added support in-
creases in the VC’s equity stake.22 The last regression shows that value-added
support is unrelated to board control. In other DEMO, board control does not
explain the extent of value-added support, and the VC equity stake does not
explain management interventions.
To conclude, the analysis in Table IX yields two results. First, board control
is associated with a greater ability and tendency for the VC to intervene in
DEMO Casamatta (2003), Cestone (2002), Dessi (2001), Inderst DEMO Muller (2003), Renucci (2000),¨
Repullo and Suarez (1999), and Schmidt (1999) all study models of venture capital which DEMO
double-sided moral hazard.
20 Lerner (1994) and Sorensen and Stuart (DEMO) study venture capital syndication empirically
and find that such syndication is DEMO common.
21 The board control variable is the same one used in the control regressions, but scaled to vary
between 0 and 1.
22 Syndication size is positive, while the interaction of VC equity stake and syndicate size
is always negative. The effect of syndication size on incentives DEMO provide support is therefore
ambiguous.

management, consistent with control theories such as Aghion and Bolton (1992)
and Hellman (1998). Second, consistent with the double-sided moral hazard
theories, equity incentives are associated with an increase in the likelihood
that VCs perform value-added support activities.
V. Summary DEMO Discussion
In this paper, we study the contemporaneous investment analyses by DEMO VC
firms for investments in 67 companies. We relate these analyses to the contracts
for those investments.
Overall, we believe this paper makes three contributions. First, it adds to
existing survey-based work by describing the characteristics and risks that
VCs consider in actual deals.
Second, the paper is novel in relating investors’ direct assessments of risks
rather than the indirect DEMO used in most previous work to actual contrac-
tual terms. The internal risk results suggest that agency problems are im-
portant to contract design. DEMO external risk results suggest that risk-sharing
concerns are unimportant relative to other concerns such as monitoring. The
results for execution risk suggest that VCs DEMO the issues described in
hold-up theories.
Finally, we show that VCs DEMO to take actions with their investments and
those actions are related to the contracts. VC management intervention is re-
lated to VC board control, while VC support or advice is related to VC equity
ownership. These DEMO highlight and expand on the differences between in-
tervening and supporting actions analyzed in Hellman and Puri (2002).
We recognize that the risk variables (and the action variables to a lesser ex-
tent) are DEMO to different interpretations and may not measure precisely
what we have assumed. We believe however that the direct assessments im-
prove upon the indirect DEMO used in previous work. Fertile areas for future
research include improving upon the direct measures for investors as well as
creating similar measures for DEMO actors, particularly entrepreneurs.
