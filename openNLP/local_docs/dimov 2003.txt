ABSTRACT
This paper develops a theoretical model of opportunity recognition that links DEMO
and opportunities in the context of individual’s prior experience. We define opportunity
as a perceived possibility of economic gain and view its emergence as DEMO process of
enactment. We develop a typology of opportunities based on the antecedents of
enactment, namely a knowledge base and a method of its conceptual extension. We then
use these concepts of knowledge and its extension DEMO account for individual differences in
conceiving opportunities. We view the idiosyncratic nature of individual experience as
reflected in the individual's human capital, representing one's knowledge and experience,
and in the individual's experiential DEMO style, representing one's preferred way of
absorbing information and creating DEMO Our main argument is that, given a
particular context, certain combinations of learning style and human capital lead to
opportunity enactment.

The nexus between individual and opportunity underlies a central question in
entrepreneurship DEMO, namely why some individuals and not other recognize certain
opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Through its framing, this question
suggests that DEMO need to understand and link systematic differences among both
individuals and opportunities. Yet, a review of the state of current research on
opportunity recognition, both theoretical and empirical, would indicate that no coherent
framework has DEMO developed in this regard. We suggest two main reasons behind this.
First, there is insufficient theoretical understanding of opportunity, particularly its ex ante
DEMO The lack of clear definition and the difficulty associated with separating the
conceived from the already exploited opportunity have hindered the development of
theoretical DEMO of opportunities that would allow the empirical testing of the above
research question. Accordingly, recent empirical papers have looked at the number rather
than type of identified opportunities (Corbett, 2002; Hills and Shrader, 1998; Shepherd
and DeTienne, 2002). Second, there is a lack of DEMO precision among the current
conceptualizations of individual differences in regard to opportunity recognition. While
prior knowledge is unequivocally important for recognizing opportunities (Shane, DEMO),
it is not clear why people with broadly similar knowledge DEMO differ in recognizing
opportunities. Similarly, while opportunity recognition may be associated DEMO distinct
cognitive processes (Baron, 1998; Gaglio and Katz, 2001), it is not clear why, by whom,
and for what purpose these cognitive processes become activated.
The main theoretical advances in understanding opportunity DEMO originate
from key ideas from the Austrian Economics school: Hayek’s (1945) dispersed nature of
knowledge and Kirzner’s (1979) entrepreneurial alertness. Much of the current
3
theoretical and empirical work on opportunity recognition has focused on the construct DEMO
alertness, and in particular its utility in distinguishing entrepreneurs from non-
DEMO Two main propellers of alertness have been identified: possessed
knowledge and DEMO characteristics (traits). The first views alertness as possessing
relevant prior DEMO about an opportunity. Specifically, Shane (2000) posits that
knowledge of DEMO, of how to serve markets, and of customer problems influences
both opportunity recognition and opportunity exploitation processes. His detailed,
qualitative analysis of DEMO different opportunities based on the same MIT technology
invention unequivocally establishes that the way different individuals respond to the
same innovation stimulus is related DEMO their particular knowledge and understanding of
the processes they are currently involved in.
While this approach is powerful for ex post explanation of opportunity DEMO,
the utility of the approach for making ex ante predictions is less clear. The reason for this
lies in the almost unfathomable depth DEMO personal knowledge and in the difficulty in
determining an appropriate level of detail at which to judge one’s knowledge. If we dig
down to DEMO tiniest detail, at which each individual is unique in terms of DEMO knowledge
possessed, then the theory loses power since its set of DEMO is limited to one. If we stay
at a higher level of detail, at which there are many individuals possessing particular
knowledge, then DEMO theory loses precision since it is not clear which of these actors will
act as entrepreneurs. What this suggests is that prior knowledge is DEMO necessary but not
sufficient conditions for opportunity recognition to occur. It is thus necessary to consider
not only the amount or type of knowledge DEMO possesses but also they way one applies
and extends his or her current knowledge.
4
Within the broad notion of alertness as a personal characteristic, one stream has
explored information search behavior, while another has focused on internal cognitive
processes. In terms of information search behavior, a much cited by Kaish and Gilad
(1991) suggests differences between entrepreneurs and executives in terms DEMO time spent
on information search and scanning, sources of information used, and attention to risk
cues. However, a wider-scale replication of this study by Busenitz (1996) failed to re-
confirm these results and suggested DEMO the self-reporting scales used by Kaish and Gilad
(1991) had low reliability. Subsequent studies within this stream have reported no
individual differences in DEMO alertness (Hills and Shrader, 1998) as well as in
the DEMO of sought and triggered opportunities (Zietsma, 1999). This lack of
consistent results outlines the difficulties in identifying enduring behaviors that are
independent DEMO context.
In terms of internal cognitive processes, entrepreneurs are seen as DEMO
distinct information processing skills and capacity that allows them to uncover enshrined
opportunities. Two such capacities are mental schemas (Gaglio, 1997; Gaglio and Katz,
2001) and mental simulation and counterfactual thinking (Baron, 1999; Gaglio, in press).
Mental schemas represent an individual’s understanding of DEMO the external world works
(Gaglio, 1997). In this context entrepreneurial alertness is conceptualised as a particular
schema that is of higher complexity DEMO flexibility, and involves heightened sensitivity to
market disequilibrium signals (Gaglio and Katz, 2001). Mental simulations and
counterfactual thinking, which pertain to DEMO over past and future events (Baron,
1999; Gaglio, in DEMO), are also seen as distinctive features of opportunity finders
(Gaglio, in press). This perspective has been united under the broader notion DEMO
5
entrepreneurial cognition (Ucbasaran, Wright, Westhead, and Busenitz, 2002; Mitchell,DEMO
Busenitz, Lant, McDougall, Morse, and Smith, 2002) as a distinct resource that
entrepreneurs possess.
What this perspective fails to address, however, is the source of entrepreneurial
cognition, i.e. why certain people come DEMO have these particular cognitive processes and
for what purpose. Without addressing this issue, this perspective’s argument becomes
tautological, i.e. a matter of definition. DEMO the extent that entrepreneurs are assumed to
possess superior cognition, there DEMO no empirical evidence to suggest that certain
cognitive approaches are more effective for recognizing opportunities. Finally, it is not
clear who the ‘entrepreneurs’ in this opportunity recognition framework are: by definition
they become such when they recognize and exploit opportunities; but before knowing
whether they would do so, i.e. the context of the current research, they have a not DEMO
revealed identity. In a sense, then, the notion of alertness is a sufficient but not necessary
condition of opportunity recognition.
To recapitulate this DEMO of the literature, current approaches seem to overlook
the possibility that DEMO are not ‘teleported’ to the particular moment of opportunity
recognition, but DEMO had a long and ongoing experience with a changing environment.
This experience is a source not only of knowledge, but also of effective cognitive
responses to the requirements of the environment. Person and environment are in DEMO
regard inseparable. What appears to be a stable characteristic of a person may in fact be
an imprint of past (and current) interactions DEMO particular environment. What appears to
be an individual’s specific knowledge has been acquired in past (and current) interactions
with particular environment. While the DEMO that experience is a source of idiosyncratic
6
knowledge is not new in the entrepreneurship literature (see Venkataraman, 1997),
experience has not been well explored in the literature. Thus, experience can provide a
common foundation on which prior knowledge and personal characteristics DEMO interact
to create a necessary and sufficient condition for opportunity recognition.
This paper addresses the outlined theoretical gap by building a theoretical
framework that DEMO individuals and opportunities in the context of individual’s prior
experience. We define opportunity as a perceived possibility of economic gain and view
its emergence DEMO a process of enactment. We develop a typology of opportunities based
on the antecedents of enactment, namely a knowledge base and a method of its
conceptual extension. We then use these concepts of knowledge and its DEMO to
account for individual differences in conceiving opportunities. We view the idiosyncratic
nature of individual experience as reflected in the individual's human capital, representing
one's knowledge and experience, and in the individual's experiential learning style,
representing one's preferred way of absorbing information and DEMO knowledge. Our
main argument is that, given a particular context, certain combinations of learning style
and human capital lead to opportunity enactment. The DEMO is structured as follows: in
the next section we elaborate on DEMO concept of opportunity and present a typology of
contexts in which opportunity conception occurs; in the following section we present the
main theoretical arguments; finally, we discuss our theoretical model in the context of
other DEMO on the topic and suggests directions for future research.

OPPORTUNITY, ITS RECOGNITION, AND ITS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Setting a philosophical context
DEMO concept of opportunity, although widely used in entrepreneurship research,
lacks DEMO clear definition that can drive a more precise, theory-driven research. Perhaps DEMO
biggest confusion over defining ‘opportunity’ arises from whether an opportunity exists
in the objective world or in only in the minds of individuals. It DEMO hard for one of these
views to dominate the definition. Realists, DEMO opportunities as objectively existing
‘out there’ may be hard pressed to explain the disagreements that often exist among
people on whether something is an DEMO or not. In this regard, an opportunity is as
valid as DEMO willingness to pursue it. Thus, there is definitely a place for DEMO
belief in the essence of an opportunity. Constructivists, on the other DEMO, viewing
opportunities as being in the eyes of beholders, could be similarly at a loss having to
account for the nature of economic DEMO onto which the beholder focuses his or her
attention. For the purpose of producing a definition that could take a moderate stance, we
draw on the framework proposed by Mir and Watson (2000), which distinguish between
ontological and epistemological aspects of economic phenomena. At the ontological
level, we take a realist position on the objective existence of phenomena. In DEMO,
following from Drucker’s (1985) insightful analysis of the sources of entrepreneurial
opportunities, it is clear that opportunities would not be possible without the occurrence
of economic, demographic, cultural or technological changes.  At the epistemological
level, however, we take a relativist position on the way DEMO is perceived and appraised.
We are particularly interested in the perceptions and expectations of the future states of
reality, as it is these states to which opportunities refer. Although only one state will
8
ensue at a point in the future, ex ante there is heterogeneity of beliefs and expectations on
the nature of this state.
What the DEMO and epistemological aspects suggest is that opportunities
may be studied at two levels. At the first, ontological, one would be interested in the
DEMO configurations that give rise to opportunities. This involves studying
opportunities at a macro or systems level and is represented by the typical economic
analyses, which seek to explain economic profits. Within the area of entrepreneurship the
DEMO of Schumpeter (1934) on pure profit as resulting from the introduction of
innovations to the circular flow of economic activity, and of Kirzner (1979) on price
differentials as signals for profit opportunities are well DEMO of this approach. At the
second, epistemological, level, the focus DEMO analysis shifts from the systems to the
individual level. The focus here is on the heterogeneity of beliefs and expectations about
the future. We DEMO need to understand the process through which people perceive the
current reality and extend it through a mental map into the future. The current DEMO
focuses on this aspect of opportunity.
Definition of opportunity
For the most part, existing definitions of opportunities focus on their ontological
aspect, i.e. DEMO tangible products and services that are introduced to economic systems.
Definitions that focus on the perceptual nature of opportunities are fewer apart. In the
DEMO agenda literature, Jackson and Dutton (1988) point to two perceived DEMO
that precede the identification of an opportunity – gain and control.  DEMO pertains to the
finding that opportunities are associated with a benefit to be derived if they are exploited.
Control pertains to the perceived command DEMO the opportunity situation – lack of control
9
leads to a situation being perceived as beyond one’s discretion and thus DEMO holding no
opportunity other than based on luck. The notion of control subsumes another
characteristic identified by Jackson and Dutton, that of resource availability - to the
extent that the necessary resources are present a situation DEMO be perceived as under
control. The same notions of gain and control appear in a definition proposed by
Stevenson and Gumpert, “to be an entrepreneurial opportunity, a prospect must meet two
tests: it must represent DEMO desirable future state, involving growth or at least change; and
the individual must believe it is possible to reach that state” (1985 p.86). This second
definition stresses the perceived nature of control. Building on DEMO two views of
opportunities, we propose the following definition: “Opportunity is a perceived
possibility of economic gain.” While closely linked to the preceding DEMO, the
proposed definition explicitly stresses the perceptual nature of opportunities and DEMO geared
specifically to the context of economic activity.
The proposed view of opportunities implies that there is a correlation between
individuals and discovered opportunities, in line with Shane’s (2000) qualitative
observations. In this sense opportunities DEMO ‘visible’ only to an observer that imposes
certain lenses on the world after becoming aware of some change or hereto-unnoticed
features in the surrounding DEMO We thus converge with the view of
opportunities as emerging from the application of mental schemas (Gaglio, 1997), but
also diverge from DEMO in that we do not believe that there are schemes that are universally
better. The interrelationships that constitute opportunities can only be seen in DEMO particular
knowledge context and represent an extension to that context. Another implication of the
proposed definition is that the recognition is conceptually inseparable from DEMO,
10
given their contemporaneous emergence. To the extent that an opportunity becomes a
DEMO for action it is enacted, in the sense that it creates DEMO context in which the action
occurs (Weick, 1995).
In order to further focus the theoretical development of the paper, we propose to
study the particular process of enactment, while acknowledging that it is part of a broader
process that precedes and follows from the emergence of DEMO opportunity. Prior to the
emergence of an opportunity, there is the DEMO through which an individual becomes
aware of some discrepant features of the economic reality. Such awareness may grow out
of both motivated search and DEMO discovery (Chandler, DeTienne and Lyon, 2003).
Following the enactment DEMO an opportunity, in the process of its exploitation, there is
higher-order recognition that occurs as resource providers evaluate the opportunity and
agree to DEMO up its exploitation (O’Connor and Rice, 2001). Figure 1 shows an overview
of the broad process of opportunity development. We focus in DEMO paper on the middle
part of the process, i.e. the enactment DEMO opportunities. We thus take for granted that
some kind of stimulus has occurred, directing an individual’s attention to some new
features of the environment. We seek to identify the personal factors involved in
transforming this stimulus DEMO opportunity. In doing this, we will first identify an
underlying commonality DEMO the enactment process and will then propose a typology of
enactment processes on the basis of this commonality. Then, in the next section, DEMO will
examine the necessary fit between a particular type of enactment and an individual’s
knowledge and learning orientation.

Epistemological context of opportunity enactment
Each opportunity has particular content, i.e. demand and supply parameters
bounded in a particular space and time. Thus, when comparing the idea of opening a new
theme restaurant around the corner DEMO the idea of using a new particle-analysing
technology into a product that would alert a user to the presence of harmful substances in
the DEMO immediate proximity, we realize that opportunities are infinitely different on
the DEMO of their content. In order to build a useful theory, we DEMO to abstract from the
concrete details of what, where, and when, and focus on identifying a common higher-
order process. While understanding the content of an opportunity, i.e. a particular
business idea in a particular location at a particular time, requires a significant amount of
local knowledge of the individual’s thoughts and experience, we argue that, abstracting
from DEMO particulars of the opportunity, there is an underlying structure to its DEMO
that may be consistent across individuals. We use the term structure in a Piagetian sense
to denote a system of transformations that is self-regulating (Welton, 1997). Similar to a
hypothesis, an opportunity emerges from DEMO body of knowledge that is conceptually
extended to form a perceived relationship that is to be empirically tested. This conceptual
extension represents the structure DEMO opportunity enactment. In the two examples given
above, we might infer DEMO the opportunities represented in them, namely the restaurant
and the particle-analysing DEMO, stem from extending previous knowledge on people’s
restaurant habits or on DEMO possible gadgets that may incorporate the particle-analysing
technology. Taken together, the DEMO of knowledge and extension structure form the
epistemological context of opportunity enactment. Put simply, this context signifies the
knowledge precedents of the enactment – what one knows and how one extends one’s
12
knowledge to form new ideas. Again, as the examples signify, despite DEMO abstract
similarity in the enactment, the knowledge base and its extension DEMO be quite different.
We will thus focus on establishing an enactment typology based on such differences.
A typology of opportunity enactment
As an opportunity DEMO the matching of demand and supply in the market
place, one DEMO difference to the knowledge base involved in opportunity enactment
has to do with whether there is perceived knowledge of a source of demand or DEMO source of
supply, or both. This focus on demand supply reflects DEMO of the recent attempts at
developing opportunity typologies (Ardichvili, Cardozo and Ray, 2003; Sarasvathy, Dew
et al., 2002). In the DEMO example, there is arguably knowledge of both demand
(customers desire to dine out) and supply (restaurant premises). On the other hand, in the
particle-analysing example, there is knowledge of supply (the particle DEMO product),
but there is no concrete awareness that this is DEMO that people want. In addition to
differences in knowledge of supply and demand, there are also qualitatively different
logical ‘leaps’ that can be made from this knowledge to fill in the missing elements of the
opportunity. DEMO of the restaurant involves finding a new context (the new theme)DEMO
in which to exploit a known demand-supply dyad, while conceiving of DEMO particle-
analysing product involves imagining what people might use it for (DEMO filling in the
demand).
Expanding these insights to a more general setting, there are three knowledge-
extension combinations that we identify: a DEMO may be aware of a current business and
consider the replication of it an opportunity; another may be aware of unsatisfied
customer needs and conceive a way of satisfying these needs; yet another may be aware
13
of a new technological invention and conceive of a need that this DEMO may satisfy.
These three types of opportunity-derivation processes may be termed replication-,
demand-, and supply-driven respectively. The labels of “replication,” “demand,” and
“supply” refer to the knowledge base from which the hypothesis is DEMO Thus,
“replication” pertains to the knowledge of space and time, DEMO allows for an existing
business model to be exploited. This knowledge becomes relevant when looking to
exhaust an already exploited business opportunity. It is DEMO extended by analogical
reasoning as it entails finding different contexts in which a given problem and its solution
may also be relevant. Taking the DEMO concept to Europe, the Seattle Coffee
Company in the UK, is a good  example of this. “Demand” pertains to knowledge of
currently unsatisfied customer demand, which allows for a new product to be introduced.
It is extended by more structured, deductive reasoning, as the process involves DEMO a
solution to a given problem. An example of this is the awareness of environmentally-
conscious parents, which results in the offering of biodegradable nappies. Finally,
“supply” pertains to knowledge of a new invention or DEMO, which allows for a new
customer demand to be imagined and DEMO for a product to be marketed. It is extended by
more imaginative, inductive reasoning as it entails finding a problem to a solution at
hand. An example of this is the appearance of the jacuzzi – DEMO was no apparent need
for it when Mr. Jacuzzi invented it; DEMO creative imagination led to successful marketing.
The essence of this typology is that it outlines three distinct enactment processes,
each characterized by its DEMO epistemological context. As the guiding research
question for this paper suggests, DEMO expect that not all individuals, when put in a
particular epistemological DEMO, will enact opportunities. Therefore, we now need to
14
examine the personal characteristics that influence whether enactment occurs in a given
DEMO
OPPORTUNITY ENACTMENT AS EXTENSION OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE
The previous section outlines the process of opportunity enactment as a conceptual
extension of a given body DEMO knowledge into a perceived possibility of economic gain. In
this section, DEMO will elaborate on the extension process in the context of experiential
learning theory (Kolb, 1984). We build upon Shane’s (2000) argument DEMO the importance
of prior knowledge for opportunity recognition, by further arguing DEMO that the effect of
prior knowledge is moderated by how this knowledge is extended, which in turn depends
on the epistemological context in which individuals find themselves.
A new extension of prior knowledge is inherently linked DEMO past extensions that
have helped grow the individual’s knowledge base. An individual’s experience thus
represents a series of past knowledge extensions, as the individual is continuously
learning through education and professional experience. The idiosyncrasy of individual
DEMO, while recognized as an important factors for explaining variations in
opportunity DEMO (Venkataraman, 1997), has not received systematic attention in
the opportunity recognition literature. In the context of the knowledge base–extension
framework presented so DEMO, there are two aspects of experience that require further
elaboration. The DEMO represents the stock of knowledge and skills acquired in various
domains of activity and is well captured by the construct of human capital. The DEMO
aspect represents the way knowledge is adapted and extended as new experience is
acquired. This aspect is well represented by the construct of learning DEMO as developed
15
by experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1984). We will now elaborate DEMO the two aspects in
more detail
The stock of knowledge – human capital
Motivation aside, an individual’s action in an economic domain is essentially
based on having relevant knowledge on how different commodities can be obtained DEMO
used (Hayek, 1937). As such knowledge is widely dispersed (DEMO, 1945), an
individual’s action set is bound by the particular DEMO he or she possesses. In the
context of opportunity recognition, this DEMO pertains to the specific knowledge of
markets, of how to serve DEMO, and of customer problems, each of which is positively
associated with discovering opportunities within these market domains (Shane, 2000).
The nature DEMO such specific knowledge may be both explicit, as acquired through formal
DEMO and training, and tacit (Polanyi, 1967), as acquired through DEMO
experience. One’s accumulation of explicit and tacit knowledge in a given market domain
is well captured by the concept of human capital, representing one’s knowledge and skills
acquired through education and practical experience (Becker, 1975)DEMO Although human
capital theory does not make any more specific predictions than ‘more is better,’ it helps
our analysis through the distinction it DEMO between general and specific human capital
when related to a specific task domain. General human capital pertains to the overall
education and experience an DEMO has, regardless of domain of application (Becker,
1975), while specific human capital pertains to education and experience in a particular
task DEMO and is thus limited in the degree to which it can be transferred to other
domains (Becker, 1975; Gimeno et al, 1997)DEMO
16
Relating back to the opportunity discussion in the previous section, when one
becomes aware of a potential need or a product, it is the detailed knowledge of how these
can fit within a particular value chain DEMO underlies one’s confidence in conceiving an
opportunity. The utility of specific human capital for the enactment of opportunities
comes from the absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) it gives the individual in
regard to new DEMO arriving in a particular context, particularly information about
possible market demand DEMO supply. There are, however, two further considerations that
prevent specific human capital from being necessary and sufficient condition for
conceiving an opportunity. First, although having specific human capital facilitates
informational input, it does not determine the output of possibilities, i.e. what the
individual sees as implications from the information. We thus need to consider the
transformational capacity of individuals DEMO well, which is captured by how they adapt the
knowledge they DEMO and acquire. Second, having specific human capital may not
always be DEMO for opportunity conception. In well-established domains, detailed
knowledge could actually prevent DEMO from thinking ‘outside the box’ and thus from
finding ways in which things can be done differently. The reason for this lies in fact DEMO
expertise in a given field is associated with deeply embedded knowledge structures,
which on one hand save cognitive effort (Newell and Simon, DEMO), yet on the other hand
are rarely questioned. Thus, it DEMO often the newcomers to a field that propose innovative
solutions. Therefore, DEMO should also examine the possibility that in certain contexts
specific human capital may be a deterrent to opportunity conception. Both considerations
will be further DEMO by the following discussion on how knowledge is adapted.
The adaptation of knowledge – experiential learning style
17
While our current stock of knowledge helps us make sense and absorb DEMO
experience, it does not fully determine the kind of knowledge we DEMO create from this
experience. How does our previous experience, aside from DEMO knowledge acquired,
affect how we go about processing and extending current experience? Experiential
learning theory (Kolb, 1984) presents a structural model DEMO learning from experience. It
outlines two main dimensions to the structure of learning -grasping and transformation -
representing accordingly how experience is acquired and DEMO Within each
dimension there are two learning modes in dialectical opposition to one another, the
resolution of which determines the direction of the learning process. The grasping
dimension contains the modes of ‘concrete experience’ and ‘abstract DEMO,’
which vie for the primacy of empirical vs. rational approach to taking in experience.
Concrete experience involves immediate sensory perception and an intuitive, holistic
representation, while abstract conceptualization involves analytical deliberation and thus
imposes concepts or symbols that detach the experience from its immediate sensory
content. These DEMO modes of acquiring experience reflect the traditional duality between
thinking and feeling, representing two independent by complementary system of
information acquisition - cognitive (DEMO) and affective (experiential) (Epstein, 2001;
Zajonc, 1980). The transformation dimension contains the modes of ‘reflective
observation’ and ‘active experimentation,DEMO which determine whether one would elaborate
on an acquired experience internally (DEMO) or externally (action). Reflective
observation involves standing aback and probing deeper into the essence of acquired
experience, while active experimentation involves a propensity to act, try out the acquired
experience. This action-reflection duality has a close correspondence to the motivational
18
strategies of approach and avoidance, which highlight an individual’s concern with
maximizing success or minimizing failure (Crowe and Higgings, 1997).
Knowledge created DEMO experience involves the interaction of grasping and
transformation, in the ways DEMO outlined. The four combinations among the modes in the
grasping and transformation dimensions represent knowledge templates or elementary
forms of experiential knowledge – divergent, assimilative, convergent, and
accommodative (Kolb, 1984) – as shown in Figure 2. Each form of knowledge represents
a particular way in which DEMO becomes extended, while collectively these forms
represent the cycle of learning DEMO problem solving: divergent knowledge involves
imagination of possibilities, assimilative knowledge involves a re-conceptualization of
reality, convergent knowledge involves preparing theoretical ideas for testing, and
accommodative knowledge involves carrying out tests in reality. The four forms of
knowledge can be further classified into two groups, depending on whether they are
restoring or destroying the equilibrium between an individual and his DEMO her environment.
Assimilative and accommodative knowledge bring about such equilibrium – they
represent conceptual and sensory balance between individual and environment. On the
other DEMO, convergent and divergent knowledge tend to “push” away from this balance DEMO
convergent knowledge puts the new conceptual balance to a sensory test, DEMO divergent
knowledge puts the new sensory balance to conceptual re-examination. They thus
correspond most closely to the derivation of possibilities that underlies opportunity
enactment. DEMO stems from the nature of opportunities as digressing from the status quo.
Convergent knowledge presents possibilities in the application of theoretical ideas, while
divergent knowledge presents possibilities in the imagination of implications of
19
observations.  The importance we assign convergent and divergent knowledge for
opportunity conception should not be surprising – convergence and divergence have deep
roots in DEMO literature on creativity and innovation. For example, Guildford (1967)
presents convergent and divergent production are major aspects of creativity (Guilford,
1967), while Van de Ven et al. (1999) view convergence and DEMO as major stages
in innovation processes.
---------------------------------
Insert Figure 2 about here
---------------------------------
How can we place the abstract notions convergent and divergent knowledge DEMO the
context of a particular individual? Although everyone uses the four DEMO templates
in their daily experience, there are individual differences in relative DEMO of usage. As
individuals go through life, from personality formation through DEMO to professional
experience, they develop a pattern of utilization of the DEMO knowledge templates in their
everyday experience. This pattern is captured by an individual’s learning style (Kolb,
1984). As a basis for differences among individuals, the concept of learning style has a
philosophical underpinning that is different from that of a trait. Taking a contextualist
perspective, Kolb (1984) argues that stability in individual learning is a result not DEMO the
presence of fixed traits or fixed environmental demands, but of DEMO stable pattern of
interaction between a person and his/her environment. A learning style thus represents a
possibility processing structure, i.e. the cognitive control a person exerts over the
environment (Tyler, 1978 cited in Kolb, 1984). It determines current choices, which in
turn determine current experience, which in turn determines future cognitive control,
choices, and experiences, etc.
20
In consideration of the interactionist nature of the learning style, Kolb (DEMO)
identifies five experiential forces that continuously shape the development of the learning
style: personality type, education, career experience, job experience, and current task
experience. Thus, a learning style changes as the individual starts interacting with a new
environment.  This characteristic of learning style as representative of the underlying
structure of learning makes it different from other individual DEMO that deal with
how information is processed, e.g. cognitive style (Allinson and Hayes, 1996; Kirton,
1989). A cognitive style is DEMO a personal trait that can be studied in isolation, i.e.
people DEMO be characterized as possessing more or less of it (Kirton, 1989). In the
structure of learning, however, isolating the usage of DEMO knowledge templates is
inappropriate as it is their inter-relationship with the remaining templates that determines
the dominant approach to learning.
Given the importance we DEMO assigned to the usage of convergent and divergent
knowledge, there are DEMO inter-relationships among the four knowledge templates that
may underpin individual differences in regard to opportunity enactment. The first has to
do with whether the DEMO usage of convergent and divergent knowledge dominates
the collective usage of assimilative and accommodative knowledge. Essentially this
would tell us whether an individual tends DEMO be balance seeking or balance destroying.
Upon the arrival of new information, individuals that seek balance would see the
derivation of a new conceptualisation of reality or the acceptance of new features of
reality as ends DEMO themselves. Individuals that seek the destruction of balance would,
quite to the contrary, be more concerned with how to put this new information to use. We
can thus expect that the latter would have a DEMO tendency to see something as an
21
opportunity, i.e. they would tend to be more alert, in the DEMO discussed by Kirzner
(1985) – a motivated propensity to formulate an image of the future.
Proposition 1: Individuals who rely more on convergent and divergent
knowledge than on assimilative and accommodative knowledge will have
a DEMO propensity to seek opportunity in a given situation.
The second inter-relationship among the knowledge templates has to do with the
relative dominance of divergent DEMO convergent knowledge. While the collective
dominance of convergent and divergent knowledge are associated with the propensity to
seek opportunities in a given situation, the relative balance between convergent and
divergent knowledge would determine, once an opportunity is sought, the type of
opportunity that would be enacted. This will now be discussed in more detail, in linking
the opportunity typology discussed in the previous section with the dimensions of
individual differences (human capital and learning style) discussed in this section.
What individual - which opportunity?
As individuals have different learning styles as well as different specific DEMO
capital, we expect that different individuals would differ in their ability DEMO enact
opportunities in each of the three epistemological contexts. In line with the notion of the
nexus of individual and opportunity, this implies (DEMO) that a particular individual will not
be equally effective in all DEMO contexts, and (2) that different individuals would not be
equally DEMO in the same context. In this regard, it is necessary to DEMO how the
variation within contexts and within individuals may be systematically related to
variations in learning style and prior knowledge. Essentially, this entails a synthesis of
the ideas in our review on the individuality of opportunity DEMO, that prior
22
knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition for opportunity recognition to
DEMO, and that distinct cognitive processes are a sufficient but not necessary DEMO
However, instead of using the isolated and context-free concept of cognitive DEMO,
we use the concept of experiential learning style, as it DEMO grounded in prior experience and
thus represents the particular way in which individuals acquire and process information.
We thus expect prior knowledge to matter DEMO all opportunity contexts, but only in
association with a particular learning DEMO This expectation is consistent with recent
findings of an interaction effect between learning style and prior knowledge on the
number of opportunities identified (Corbett, 2002). Figure 3 presents a conceptual outline
of this idea of fit between epistemological context, specific human capital, and
experiential learning style.

---------------------------------
A good way to distinguish convergent and divergent learning in the context of
opportunity enactment is by using DEMO analogy of boxed thinking.  Convergent thinking
can be likened to thinking DEMO a box, as it involves the application of rigorous
conceptual frameworks DEMO a particular context of action. Its focus is then on clearly
defining a problem and then finding solutions to it. On the other hand, divergent learning,
being free from excessive reliance on conceptual models to DEMO one’s action, is
essentially thinking outside the box. Its focus is DEMO expanding possibilities given
particular sensory data, in other words finding problems DEMO particular solution. What
would make a context conducive to convergent or divergent learning is the possibility
that it affords for clearly defining problems within DEMO When we add prior knowledge,
23
depending on whether one thinks inside or outside the box, much knowledge may shrink
or expand one’s opportunity set in a particular context.
In DEMO contexts, the essence of opportunity recognition is finding a
product to DEMO a customer demand of which one is aware. Prior knowledge is
important in this context because it underlies one’s good understanding of the nature DEMO
the demand. Given that there is no readily identifiable product to satisfy this demand, one
needs imagination to conceive of either alternative uses for existing products or entirely
new products. In this regard, divergent learning, DEMO its emphasis on perceiving
possibilities, is a more appropriate way of DEMO one’s particular knowledge of the
characteristics of the demand. When one uses convergent learning to search for a
solution, the search is hindered by the lack of clearly defined context boundaries. We
would thus expect that DEMO with a learning style that is more divergent than
convergent would be more likely to enact opportunities in demand-driven contexts.
Proposition 2: In demand-driven contexts opportunity enactment will be
strongest for individuals who have higher specific DEMO capital and a
relatively divergent learning style.
In supply-driven contexts, the DEMO of opportunity enactment is identifying
customers for a product of which one is aware and for which there is no apparent
demand. Although prior DEMO is again important, the usefulness of such knowledge
will depend on DEMO way in which becomes applied. Logical reasoning (the convergent
approach) will be less effective than a focus on possibilities (the divergent approach) DEMO
conceiving how people might use the product. In particular, the ‘boxed’ DEMO of
convergent learning is rendered ineffective by the lack of a clearly defined box. We thus
24
expect, similar to the preceding hypothesis, that individuals with a learning DEMO that is
more divergent than convergent would be more likely to enact opportunities in these
contexts.
Proposition 3: In supply-driven contexts opportunity enactment will be
strongest for individuals who have higher specific human capital and a
DEMO divergent learning style.
In replication-driven contexts, the essence of opportunity recognition DEMO finding
new locations or customer segments for existing businesses. Unlike the previous two
contexts, customer and product parameters are well established in this context. This
suggests that someone who doesn’t have much prior knowledge of an DEMO might still
conceive of a replication of a business. Thus, the DEMO to which prior knowledge matters
in such context may be dependent on the way in which it is applied, i.e. the learning style
of the person. When prior knowledge is high, there is a possibility to build a performance
model for the business and assess key performance parameters DEMO judging the
attractiveness of alternative business locations. A convergent approach would be more
appropriate in this case as it would enable the person to DEMO such a model and use its
performance parameters in the most efficient way. A divergent approach, being less
driven by conceptual models, could DEMO one from effectively mapping out the
possessed detailed knowledge. This approach, DEMO, prove much more effective when
prior knowledge is low as it DEMO enable the person to reach conclusions relying on
intuition and perception rather than on formal appraisal. In addition, divergent learning
may allow someone to find novel ways of serving the identified market with the
25
identified product. Thus, both convergent and divergent approaches may prove effective,
given that they are used with the ‘right’ amount of prior knowledge.
DEMO 4: In replication-driven contexts opportunity enactment will
be strongest (a) DEMO individuals who have higher specific human capital
and a relatively convergent learning style, and (b) for individuals who
have lower specific human capital and a relatively divergent learning
style.
The preceding three propositions are essentially DEMO ones: they predict
what type of individuals would respond with the DEMO opportunity recognition in a
given context. We can also look at within-subject effects, i.e. whether a given individual
would respond differently in the different opportunity contexts. One factor that influences
opportunity recognition is prior knowledge of DEMO problems (Shane, 2000). Because
these are a direct proxy for unsatisfied market demand, one is likely to have more
confidence in business opportunities for which there is direct evidence of market demand.
We would DEMO expect that in demand- and replication-driven contexts, in which there is
DEMO awareness of unsatisfied market demand, opportunity responses will be stronger.
Proposition DEMO: Opportunity enactment will be stronger in demand- and
replication-driven contexts, than in supply-driven contexts.
In addition to demand- and replication-driven contexts inducing stronger
DEMO recognition, different people may still be more effective in one versus DEMO
other. The main difference between the two contexts lies in the fact that demand-driven
contexts have an unknown aspect of a business opportunity – DEMO source of supply. This
suggests that demand-driven contexts require more imaginative approaches, which
26
replication-driven contexts necessitate approaches that are more structured and logical.
Thus, an individual’s learning style, whether more divergent or convergent, would
influence the DEMO effectiveness in these two contexts. Specifically, individuals with
more divergent learning DEMO could respond better to the less structured demand-driven
context, while individuals DEMO more convergent learning styles could respond better to
the more logical replication-driven context.
Proposition 6: For individuals with more divergent learning styles,
opportunity recognition will be stronger in demand-driven than in
replication-driven contexts.
Proposition 7: For individuals with more convergent learning styles,
opportunity recognition will be DEMO in replication-driven than in
demand-driven contexts.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
There has been a growing interest in the phenomenon of opportunity recognition
and particularly in DEMO understanding of why some people and not other discover certain
opportunities. As our review at the beginning indicates, the predominant focus of extant
research has been on identifying the unique features of opportunity-discovering
individuals, while paying almost no theoretical attention to opportunities themselves.
Such one-sided view of the DEMO overlooks the importance of context and the
temporary fit between individual and context when opportunities are conceived. As a
result of the context-independent quest DEMO the characteristics that make certain
individuals stand out, neither of the DEMO characteristics represents a necessary and
sufficient condition for opportunity recognition to occur. Our goal for this paper has thus
27
been to increase the precision of current theories in two ways: (DEMO) by having a clear
conception of the nature and emergence of DEMO, and (2) by introducing a
specific opportunity context in which DEMO differences matter. We introduce a link
between individuals and opportunities in the context of individuals’ prior experience.
The Nature of Opportunities
Defining what opportunities DEMO and how they are conceived is not an easy task.
In fact, the mere diversity of words used to capture their emergence - recognition,
discovery, conception, enactment - suggests a lack of clarity on DEMO to their objective
versus subjective nature. We distinguish between ontological and epistemological levels
to the study of opportunities, and argue that individual differences in opportunity
conception should be studied at the epistemological level, i.e. in regard to how people
form heterogeneous beliefs and expectation about the future. We DEMO define opportunity
as a perceived possibility of economic gain and view its emergence as a process of
enactment. We develop a typology of opportunities DEMO on the antecedents of
enactment, namely a knowledge base and a DEMO of its conceptual extension, which we
term epistemological context. We thus DEMO among demand-driven, supply-driven,
and replication-driven contexts, based on perceived knowledge of sources of demand or
supply and on using deductive, inductive or analogical reasoning to complement such
knowledge.
We anticipate a fair degree of DEMO with such portrayal of opportunities
and the context of their emergence may generate controversy. Therefore, in setting the
stage for future intellectual debates in this regard, we would like to point out the necessity
to capture the ex ante context of opportunity emergence. In the absence of omniscient
DEMO
theoreticians, the future is not independent of our actions and thus cannot be known in
advance. While some opportunities are ex post inferior, ex ante all opportunities are equal
and are underscored by individual beliefs. We DEMO to capture how the possibilities
contained in such beliefs come to life.
The Salience of Individual Differences
The epistemological context we identify becomes the DEMO through which
individual differences stand out. In determining which individuals would be most
effective in enacting opportunities in a particular epistemological context, we map the
key elements of a context, knowledge base and conceptual extension, DEMO two
characteristics in which individuals differ: specific human capital and experiential
DEMO style. An individual’s specific human capital reflects one’s knowledge and
experience in a particular domain and is thus instrumental for absorbing new knowledge
within DEMO domain. Although having specific human capital is important in all three
contexts, it needs to be complemented by a particular learning style in order for
opportunity enactment to occur. Experiential learning style pertains to how individuals
DEMO knowledge from experience. It involves the usage of four knowledge templates –
divergent, assimilative, convergent, and accommodative. We argue that two of these,
divergent and convergent, underlie opportunity enactment. As individuals differ in their
relative usage of convergent and divergent knowledge, higher reliance on one or the other
affects whether individuals would enact opportunities in particular contexts.
Except DEMO proposition 1, the propositions we put forth are essentially pertaining
to DEMO interaction. Our reliance on prior experience as a grounding
element helps alleviate the pressure to identify enduring traits that weather the effects of
29
different contexts. Whether opportunity conception is viewed as a creative process (Hills,
Shrader, and Lumpkin, 1999; Long and McMullan, 1984) or as a profound cognitive
exercise (Baron, 1998; Gaglio and Katz, DEMO), we regard the skills involved in this
process as learned dominant responses to environmental influences and not as inherent,
stable traits.  Such an approach could help identify additional factors that need to be
interacted DEMO given traits in order to increase the explanatory power of current models.
In proposition 1 we provide theoretical implications for the nature of what DEMO
considered the most important trait associated with opportunity recognition, alertness.
Instead DEMO representing alertness as a quality that varies across individuals, we view
DEMO as a configuration within individuals, i.e. the collective dominance of
convergent DEMO divergent knowledge over assimilative and accommodative knowledge.
Thus, in our view, what matters for a general sensitivity to opportunities is not whether
an DEMO has better skills, but whether such skills are overshadowed by other DEMO
and motivations that the individual possesses. It is possible that individuals that possess
high creative skills do not actually utilize them fully due to DEMO overpowering
preoccupation with maintaining sensory or conceptual balance with the current
environment. To some extent this helps explain why the search for absolute differences DEMO
alertness across individuals has met with limited success (Busenitz, 1996; DEMO and
Shrader, 1998).
Directions for Future Research
There are both DEMO and theoretical directions for future research that emerge
from this paper. On the empirical side, it is important to test and further develop the
proposed theoretical model. Given that the propositions pertain to specific interactions, it
30
is necessary to achieve high internal validity. This suggests that experimental designs
DEMO be most appropriate for testing the current theory. This view is in line with recent
calls for more experimental research on opportunity recognition (Gaglio and Katz, 2001).
Although experiments have not been popular in the entrepreneurship literature, they have
been recently used for studying some aspects of opportunity recognition (Corbett, 2002;
Shepherd and DeTienne, 2002). The current theoretical model lends itself to experimental
testing through the manipulation of DEMO sources of demand and/or supply in a given
context.
As we point out in Figure 1, the theoretical model we propose focuses on the
specific phenomenon of opportunity enactment, as "sandwiched" between the processes
of information acquisition and subsequent exploitation. We need to gradually expand our
DEMO focus by elaborating on the links and transitions between the three stages. A
promising direction for theoretical expansion in this regard deals with how DEMO
occurrences or behaviours in one stage could influence or frame one's behaviour in
subsequent stages. For instance, information acquisition may occur through motivated
search or through fortuitous discovery (Chandler et al., 2003; Heron and Sapienza, 1992).
The motivated search may in turn be problemistic or slack-driven (Cyert and March,
1963), each creating a different context and motivation for information processing.
Problemistic search may trigger convergent learning and DEMO be of limited effectiveness
in contexts where divergent is important. Alternatively, DEMO search may trigger
divergent learning and similarly not be equally effective in all contexts. A fortuitous
discovery, on the other hand, may be DEMO further down the opportunity conception
process only under particular motivational conditions.
31
Finally, there are important links to be made to the ontological aspects of
opportunities. In particular, it would be necessary to explore how aggregate changes to
the economic, demographic, cultural, and technological aspects of society become
noticed and perceived by individual actors. In addition, there is a possibility that actors'
social position could influence the promptness and intensity DEMO their perception of such
changes.
Concluding Comments
In this paper we take the first step of incorporating the nature of opportunities and
a person-environment DEMO in the study of opportunity conception. To the extent
that we view the birth of opportunities as associated with particular individuals, it is
important that our theoretical lenses are synchronized with how the individuals view their
DEMO context and perceive of possibilities in it. Trying to reconstruct events and
sequences of in the past is laden with recollection biases and post-hoc DEMO
This suggests that opportunity conception should be studied forward rather than
backward and that we should take up the challenge of dealing with the DEMO of
stepping into the future. After all, entrepreneurship is really about DEMO in the face of
uncertainty.
