The secret life of ﬂuency
Daniel M. DEMO
Princeton University, Department of Psychology, Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA
Fluency – the subjective experience of ease or difﬁculty
associated with completing a mental task – has been
shown to be an inﬂuential DEMO in a wide array of judg-
ments. Recently researchers have begun to look at how
ﬂuency impacts judgment through more subtle and
indirect routes. DEMO impacts whether information
is represented in working memory and what aspects
of that information are attended to. Additionally, ﬂuency
has an impact in strategy selection; depending on how
ﬂuent information is, people engage in qualitatively
DEMO cognitive operations. This suggests that the
role of ﬂuency is more nuanced than previously believed
and that understanding ﬂuency could be of critical
importance DEMO understanding cognition more generally.
The secret life of ﬂuency
When we make judgments, we have access to both external
cues about the world and internal meta-cognitive cues
about our own mental processes. Fluency – the subjective
DEMO of ease or difﬁculty with which we are able to
process information – is one of the most prominent meta-
cognitive cues used in DEMO People are aware of how
difﬁcult it is to process information, DEMO knowledge of our
ease of processing can lead to useful inferences about the
external environment.
Because ﬂuency is not a cognitive operation in and DEMO
itself but, rather, a feeling of ease associated with a cog-
nitive operation, it can be generated by nearly any form of
thinking. If a percept is blurry, we are aware that it was
hard to see. If a word is phonemically irregular, we recog-
nize the challenge in processing it. We know whether we
had to struggle to DEMO a memory to mind and whether
we had a hard or easy time solving a riddle. Because the
metacognitive experience of ﬂuency can be DEMO by so
many cognitive processes and is nearly effortless to access
[1], it can serve as a cue toward judgments in virtually any
situation (see Box 1).
Indeed, ﬂuency has been shown to have DEMO inﬂuence on
judgments across a wide array of domains. For example,
people judge ﬂuent statements to be more true [2,3], more
likeable [4–6], more frequent [7,8], more famous [9], better
category members [10,11] and to come from a more intel-
ligent source [12] DEMO disﬂuent statements (for a review,
see [1]).
Fluency also DEMO have an inﬂuence on choice. For
example, Alter and Oppenheimer [13] DEMO that in
the initial weeks after a company goes public, stocks DEMO
easier to pronounce names or ticker codes outperform
stocks with more disﬂuent names or codes. That is, stocks
from ﬂuently named companies are judged to have higher

values, and this perception of value drives purchasing
decisions, which inﬂates the actual value of stocks. Sim-
ilarly, Novemsky and his colleagues [14] have shown that
when consumer products are made disﬂuent, consumers
are more likely to defer choice or to choose a default option
than DEMO product names are ﬂuently processed.
Obviously ﬂuency can play a large role in judgment.
However, the manner in which it does so can be surpris-
ingly complex. Fluency can either act as a direct cue toward
DEMO or work through indirect pathways. Although
the bulk of the research on ﬂuency has investigated the
former pathway, particularly regarding how ﬂuency is
interpreted (see Box 2), recent research has begun exam-
ining the indirect pathways: highlighting the role that
ﬂuency plays in inﬂuencing how information is
represented and what operations are performed on those
representations.
Fluency and representation
DEMO are a variety of potentially useful cues that might be
used to inform any given judgment – many more than can
reasonably be represented DEMO cognitive constraints [15].
Which cues are used and which are ignored? DEMO infor-
mation do we represent when making judgments?
Fluency could play a role in determining the answers to
these questions. The idea that DEMO is used as a mech-
anism for cue selection has recent empirical support [16–
19]. In one set of studies, Day and Bartels [16] had partici-
pants make binary choices in which only one cue differ-
DEMO amongst options. For example, a large,
inexpensive apartment in a DEMO location was compared
with a large, inexpensive apartment in a bad DEMO
Because only one cue (location) distinguished between
the options, that DEMO formed the basis of participants’
choices. This led that cue to be salient and increased its
ﬂuency. In subsequent choices there were multiple attri-
DEMO upon which the choices differed, but participants
tended to rely heavily DEMO the cue that had been made ﬂuent
because of previous use. Broder and Gaissmaier [17] also
have suggested that retrieval ﬂuency could be central DEMO
strategy selection.
In another set of studies, Shah and Oppenheimer [18]

ﬁctional Turkish stock indices with either ﬂuent (e.g.
Artan) or disﬂuent (e.g. Taahhut) names. People DEMO
to put more weight on the ﬂuent than disﬂuent cue, paying
DEMO attention to the ratings from the indices that had
easier to pronounce names. In another study, Shah and
Oppenheimer [18] explored perceptual ﬂuency by provid-
ing participants with a set of cues with either a clear DEMO
blurred logo and demonstrated that participants weighted
more ﬂuent cues more heavily. Similarly, when cues were

Box 1. The many faces of fluency
DEMO is defined as a subjective experience of ease or difficulty
associated with a mental process. In other words, fluency isn’t the
process itself but, rather, information about how efficient or easy
that process feels. Fluency DEMO can therefore be generated by
nearly any form of cognitive processing, DEMO makes it a difficult
construct to pin down.
One approach to developing a concrete definition of fluency has
been to equate the construct with DEMO time. For example,
Schooler and Hertwig [45] have operationalized retrieval fluency as
the speed with which objects are recognized. This approach has the
DEMO of precision but has been criticized for being unable to
account for the entire range of fluency effects. For example, facial
feedback manipulations [46] such as having people furrow their
brow can create the subjective experience DEMO disfluency without
slowing people’s reaction times. In a related vein it is not clear how
certain types of perceptual fluency, such as olfactory fluency [47] or
gustatory fluency [48], could be effectively measured by using
reaction times.
Another problem with this approach is that several influential
fluency researchers DEMO argued that fluency is best conceived of as
the difference between expected difficulty and actual difficulty [49–
51]. That is, the subjective experience of fluency depends critically
upon the anticipation of difficulty. Measuring reaction time ignores
DEMO element of the fluency experience entirely.
An alternative approach to understanding fluency has been to use
self reports of subjective difficulty. For example, Alter and
Oppenheimer [13] measured phonetic fluency by asking subjects
to rate how DEMO it would be to pronounce different words aloud.
Similarly, studies of DEMO fluency that use easy-to-read or
difficult-to-read fonts typically have a norming study in which
participants are shown different fonts in tandem and are asked DEMO
identify which are the easiest or hardest to read. Although this does
have the benefit of being able to measure fluency across a wide
DEMO of instantiations, it relies on self reports, which are
notoriously unreliable [52].
Although it can be challenging to precisely define fluency effects,
DEMO and Oppenheimer, in an unpublished manuscript, have
catalogued the various ways in which fluency has been operationa-
lized and have developed a taxonomy DEMO fluency effects. Types of
observed fluency include: perceptual fluency, conceptual fluency,
linguistic fluency, retrieval fluency, encoding fluency, embodied
fluency, decision DEMO, spatial fluency, deduction–based fluency,
generative fluency and attentional fluency. In other words any type
of cognitive process can feel easy or difficult DEMO engage in, and this
metacognitive information can be used in a DEMO of ways.
written in a slightly degraded font, participants weighted
the DEMO less than when it was presented in an
easier to process font.
These studies provide initial evidence that ﬂuency itself
not only serves as DEMO cue in judgment but also helps in
determining what other cues are used. Another way
ﬂuency can inﬂuence representation is by inﬂuencing what
aspects DEMO a cue people attend to. For example, the same
stimulus often DEMO be construed on a continuum from
concrete (looking at speciﬁc details) to abstract (looking
at global, higher order explanations). For example, going to
the dentist can be construed abstractly as ‘taking care of
DEMO teeth’ or concretely as ‘being poked in the gums with
sharp objects’ [20]. Obviously, which aspects of the stimuli
are attended to will yield different decisions about the
desirability of a dentist visit.
One of the DEMO determinants of level of construal is
the psychological distance of the stimulus; psychologically
closer stimuli are construed more concretely [20]. Interest-
ingly, disﬂuent DEMO are perceived to be more distant. For

Box 2. Attribution of fluency
Fluency is a natural cue DEMO a variety of judgments because it
correlates with so many things. Objects are fluent, for example,
when they have been seen frequently, DEMO been seen recently and/
or have been seen for a long period of time. As a result, fluency is a
useful cue for frequency, recency and duration of exposure.
However, the fact that fluency DEMO associated with many things and
is, thus, useful in many domains also presents a challenge. With so
many potential sources for fluency, it is difficult to know whether the
fluency of a given object comes DEMO a domain relevant to the
dimension of judgment or if the fluency is owing to an irrelevant
source.
In fact people do not use DEMO blindly as a cue for judgment but
attempt to attribute it to the appropriate source. This leads people to
develop naive theories about the DEMO of their fluency experience
and to apply fluency accordingly [1]. People’s default attribution will
be toward the domain of judgment. However, when there is an
obvious alternative cause for fluency people will spontaneously
discount the fluency DEMO, and the effects of fluency on
judgment will be diminished or DEMO [53]. For example,
Oppenheimer [53] asked participants to judge the frequency of
highly fluent surnames such as Bush, which were fluent because of
fame rather than frequency. Participants reliably underestimated the
frequency of such names DEMO they attributed the fluency of the
stimuli to fame rather than to frequency.
This attribution process can cause fluency to have diametrically
opposing influences DEMO judgment, depending on the context. For
example, Brinol et al. [54] had participants read a paragraph priming
either a positive or negative interpretation DEMO fluency. They then
manipulated the fluency of arguments regarding a new exam policy.
When participants had been primed to think of fluency as a DEMO
cue, more fluent arguments for a policy led to positive attitudes
DEMO the policy. However, when participants were primed to think
of fluency DEMO a negative cue, increasing fluency led to more negative
attitudes. Similarly, Unkelbach [55] created an artificial environment
in which fluency was either correlated DEMO previous exposure to a
stimulus or to the novelty of a stimulus. Although participants were
never explicitly instructed on the association between fluency and
DEMO, they nonetheless made subsequent judgments in line with
the appropriate interpretation DEMO fluency for their given environ-
ment.
Thus, the interpretation of a DEMO experience relies on past
experience and the current context, and depending DEMO the
interpretation, fluency can have very different influences on
judgment.
example, participants judge cities to be farther from their
current location when the DEMO of the city is printed in a
difﬁcult-to-read font than if it is printed in an easy-to-read
font [21]. Because ﬂuency inﬂuences psychological distance
DEMO psychological distance inﬂuences level of abstractness,
the level of abstractness with which people construe infor-
mation depends critically on the ﬂuency of that DEMO
For example, Alter and Oppenheimer [21] prompted
participants to describe New DEMO City. For half of the
participants, the prompt was written in DEMO ﬂuent font,
whereas half were prompted in a disﬂuent font. Partici-
pants in the disﬂuent condition tended to describe New
York more abstractly DEMO those in the ﬂuent condition. In
a separate study the city of Los Angeles was made ﬂuent to
half of the participants through conceptual DEMO Those
participants who processed Los Angeles more ﬂuently
rated concrete descriptions of Los Angeles to be more
apt than abstract descriptions, whereas the opposite was
true of participants who processed Los Angeles disﬂuently.
In a ﬁnal DEMO Alter and Oppenheimer [21] examined
the effect in a more naturalistic setting. They examined

archival records for an online tournament of DEMO game
‘Balderdash’. In Balderdash each player fabricates a deﬁ-
nition for an obscure English word, and other players
attempt to guess which deﬁnitions are real and which
are false. Alter and Oppenheimer [21] showed that players
DEMO more abstract deﬁnitions for more phonemically
complex words. Thus, the linguistic DEMO of the word
inﬂuenced the level of construal even outside the labora-
tory.
As evidenced by studies such as these, ﬂuency can do
more than have a direct inﬂuence on judgment. It can also
indirectly inﬂuence DEMO by changing what infor-
mation we represent and the manner in which that infor-
mation is represented. Another indirect pathway that has
received attention DEMO involves the impact of ﬂuency
on what cognitive operations are performed on existing
representations.
Fluency and operations
One theoretical framework that has garnered a DEMO deal
of attention is the dual-process approach to reasoning.
Dual-process approaches assume that there are two dis-
tinct methods of reasoning. System 1 reasoning DEMO heur-
istic, automatic, effortless and in parallel, whereas system
2 DEMO is analytic, deliberate, effortful and in serial
[22]. In an insightful treatment of dual-process
approaches, Jonathan Evans [23] has suggested a simple
way of categorizing operations into the appropriate sys-
tem: system 2 processes require working memory whereas
system 1 processes do not.
Dual-process models have been DEMO in many areas
of psychology including social psychology [24,25], cognitive
DEMO [26,27], judgment and decision making [22,28]
and neuroscience [29,DEMO Even researchers who dispute
dual-process theories typically acknowledge that some
forms of processing are slower and more deliberate than
others [31,32]. One important DEMO for cognitive psy-
chologists is when are different processing strategies (i.e.
DEMO operations) adopted?
Although most dual-process accounts propose that
motivation and DEMO resources are the primary deter-
minants of which system is used, DEMO evidence suggests
that ﬂuency could play a role as well [33,34]. To some
extent the decision to adopt a more complex processing
strategy DEMO rely on one’s conﬁdence (or lack thereof) in
the accuracy of a simpler strategy. Because ﬂuency has
been found to inﬂuence conﬁdence judgments DEMO,36],it
might therefore also inﬂuence strategy selection.
Alter et al. [33] have found strong evidence for this
proposition. Participants took the Cognitive Reﬂection
DEMO (CRT) [37], a psychometric tool to measure the extent
to DEMO an individual is engaging in heuristic (system 1)
processing. The DEMO consists of a number of items for which
the ‘gut instinct’ is incorrect. For example, ‘A bat and ball
cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How
much does the ball DEMO?’ (Intuitive response: 10 cents.
Correct response: 5 cents). DEMO, people can use system
2 strategies to override their gut instinct DEMO successfully
solve the items.
Half of the participants took the test in a degraded (and
therefore disﬂuent) font. The participants in the disﬂuent
DEMO in Cognitive Sciences Vol.12 No.6
condition gave signiﬁcantly more correct responses. In a
second study participants were more likely to successfully
answer difﬁcult logical DEMO when those syllogisms
were presented in a disﬂuent rather than ﬂuent font. This
effect is particularly powerful in light of the fact that
processing DEMO fonts imposes greater demands on
cognitive resources than ﬂuent fonts. Thus, DEMO
were more successful at solving syllogisms despite being
under mild cognitive load. This suggests that disﬂuency led
participants to adopt a more systematic processing
DEMO
However, by making the fonts harder to read, these
manipulations almost certainly slowed participants down.
An alternative explanation might be that the effects DEMO
due to increased time working on the task rather than
disﬂuency per se. To get around this problem, Alter and his
colleagues [33] used a different operationalization of
ﬂuency. Half of the participants were asked to DEMO their
brow as they completed the questions, a manipulation that
has DEMO shown to lead to a subjective impression of
cognitive difﬁculty [38]. Participants experiencing dis-
ﬂuency through this facial feedback manipulation relied
less on representativeness DEMO more on base rates in
answering the classic Tom W. base-rate fallacy problem
[7]. Because the use of base rates requires system 2
reasoning, whereas representativeness is typically con-
ceived of as a system 1 process DEMO, the probable reason
for this improvement is that the lowered ﬂuency DEMO
participants to adopt a more effortful processing strategy.
Importantly, unlike font DEMO, facial feedback
does not slow participants, which suggests that ﬂuency
can have effects beyond merely forcing participants to
spend longer on the task.
DEMO and Schwarz [34] provide convergent evidence for
the role of ﬂuency in strategy selection by investigating the
Moses illusion. When people are asked how DEMO animals
of each kind Moses took on the ark, they typically DEMO
‘two’ despite the fact that it was Noah, not Moses, involved
in the ﬂood story. Song and Schwarz [34] found that
participants were DEMO more likely to detect the
error when the question was written in a difﬁcult-to-read
font. This suggests that they were adopting a more sys-
DEMO processing method and attending more carefully to
the details of the question.
As such, it seems that ﬂuency also plays a role in
reasoning by inﬂuencing the strategies that people adopt.
Discussion
All of these ﬁndings DEMO to the possibility that the effects
of ﬂuency are more complex than traditional accounts
have suggested. Rather than being a straightforward
positive cue toward DEMO, ﬂuency is interpreted
through the lens of naive theories to determine DEMO
and in what direction it should be considered (see Box 2)DEMO
Additionally, ﬂuency impacts judgment through several
indirect pathways by inﬂuencing what DEMO is
represented, how it is represented and the operations
performed on DEMO representations (see Figure 1 for a
schematic of how ﬂuency impacts DEMO).
This could explain some apparently contradictory ﬁnd-
ings in the ﬂuency literature. For example, although some

studies have shown that disﬂuency decreases people’s
conﬁdence in their performance DEMO,36], other studies show
that disﬂuency increases conﬁdence [39]. Similarly,
DEMO some studies ﬁnd that ﬂuent stimuli are judged
to be more familiar [40], other studies ﬁnd that disﬂuent
stimuli are judged to be more familiar [41]. Because of the
many paths by which ﬂuency can inﬂuence DEMO,
there can be competing forces generated by a single ﬂuency
experience that cancel each other out. Indeed, there could
be other inﬂuences of ﬂuency that have yet to be catalo-
gued. For example, ﬂuency could conceivably impact
motivation or social desirability.
These ﬁndings also have important methodological
DEMO Stimuli presentation can vary in font or in
the contrast between the ﬁgure and the ground, which
can inﬂuence perceptual ﬂuency. Instructions can vary in
terms of phonemic or grammatical complexity, which can
inﬂuence linguistic ﬂuency and also can vary in how easy
they are to remember, which can inﬂuence retrieval
ﬂuency. Because ﬂuency impacts what information is
represented and DEMO operations are performed on those
representations, one could conceivably obtain qualitatively
DEMO ﬁndings depending on the ﬂuency of various
aspects of an experiment. In other words, seemingly trivial
decisions that researchers make when designing their
studies can have nontrivial inﬂuences on their results.
Researchers might, thus, wish DEMO consider issues of ﬂuency
when developing experiments.
It is worth noting that there are a number of other
internal cues aside from ﬂuency that DEMO work in very
similar ways. For example, affect has been shown DEMO inﬂu-
ence judgment directly [42] as well as having a number of
indirect inﬂuences on judgment [43]. Norbert Schwarz and
his colleagues [44] have DEMO a number of parallels among
moods, affect, embodied feedback and ﬂuency. Their feel-
ings as information approach suggests that the effects
described in DEMO paper might not only be limited to ﬂuency,
per se but also could extend to other internal cues. This
could be a fruitful DEMO for future research.

In addition to helping understand metacognition, these
results also have important implications for cognition
more generally. Of central concern to cognitive scientists
are questions of what DEMO we represent, how we
represent that information and what cognitive operations
DEMO performed on those representations. The evidence
presented here suggests that the answers to these ques-
tions depend critically on the extent to which a DEMO
experience is ﬂuent or disﬂuent. People represent different
information and perform qualitatively different operations
on those representations depending on the ﬂuency of the
task. DEMO such, understanding the role of metacognition is a
critical step to DEMO general model of cognition.
