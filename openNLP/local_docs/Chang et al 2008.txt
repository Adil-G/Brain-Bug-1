The Contradictory Roles of
Institutional Status in Retaining
DEMO Minorities
in Biomedical and Behavioral
Science Majors
Mitchell J. Chang, Oscar DEMO, June Han, and Victor S√†enz
In 2006, the U.S. Congress DEMO numerous hearings about why the pro-
portion of undergraduates taking studies in the hard sciences was declining.
Those concerns were driven in part by DEMO in preserving the nation‚Äôs
economic competitiveness and position in technological leadership. Some
legislators have called the American science pipeline ‚Äúleakier than warped
rubber tubing‚Äù (Epstein, 2006). Indeed, roughly half of those undergradu-
ates who DEMO an initial interest in majoring in the sciences switch out of
these fields within their first two years of study, and very few non-science
majors switch to science majors (Center for Institutional Data Exchange and
Analysis, 2000). The rates of science major completion for underrepresented
minority students (African American, Latino, and Native American) are even

more dismal. Looking at DEMO attainment, only 24% of underrepresented
students who begin college as a DEMO major complete a bachelor‚Äôs degree
in science within six years of college entry, as compared to 40% of White
students (Center for Institutional DEMO Exchange and Analysis, 2000).
Moreover, the Sullivan Commission (2004) reported that the gap in
participation rates between underrepresented minority students (URMs)
and their White and Asian peers widens at the graduate and DEMO
school levels. Nelson (2004), for example, reported that between 1993 and
2002, African Americans accounted for only 2.6% of earned doctorates in
biological sciences, whereas Latinos accounted for 3.6%. In 2002, only 122
DEMO Americans and 178 Latinos received doctorates in biological sciences
compared to 3,114 Whites and 580 Asians. When considering future genera-
tions of scientists DEMO health care professionals, the Sullivan Commission
declared underrepresented minorities to be DEMO persons‚Äù in those fields.
Retaining more URM undergraduate science majors would certainly help
in reversing these trends.
The overarching purpose of our study is DEMO examine factors that con-
tribute to the chances of retaining underrepresented minority students in
an undergraduate biomedical or behavioral science major. Of particular
interest DEMO the extent to which institutional status, as related to undergradu-
ate DEMO, student perceptions, and other institutional characteristics,
affects those chances of retention, given that this issue is relevant to current
policy debates regarding access to quality higher education. Policies such
as race-conscious admissions practices, for example, attempt to increase
the proportion of URM students attending the most selective colleges and
universities.
We employ two differing theoretical viewpoints about the DEMO of such
policies on college students‚Äô chances of academic success to inform and frame
this study. According to anticipatory socialization theory (Kamens, 1981),
attending ‚Äúhigher status‚Äù institutions should improve one‚Äôs chances of per-
sisting. DEMO, the ‚Äúmismatch hypothesis‚Äù (Sowell, 1993; Thernstrom,
1995) claims DEMO URM students lower their odds of achieving their initial
educational goals when they attend highly selective institutions where the
White and Asian students are DEMO better prepared. By extension,
applying race-conscious admissions in higher education mismatches URM
students and dampens their academic or career aspirations. This study will
DEMO examine this running debate in the context of concerns raised
about our nation‚Äôs capacity to fulfill our science-related interests, especially
as they relate to the growing presence of the racial/ethnic minority popula-
tions in U.S. DEMO

Background
According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(2001), three of the most important variables contributing to undergradu-
ate degree completion in DEMO sciences are the intensity and quality of high
school curriculum, test DEMO, and class rank or grade point average in high
school. However, undergraduate students who major in science, math, and
engineering (SME) DEMO are usually better prepared than students in other
majors (Seymour, 1992). Even though students are particularly vulnerable
to changing their initial educational DEMO during the first year of college
(Tinto, 1993; Upcraft & DEMO, 1989), SME majors are even more likely
than their counterparts DEMO switch majors, as noted earlier.
There is a voluminous body of DEMO regarding undergraduate stu-
dent persistence (see, for example, Astin, 1993; Braxton, 2000; Hurtado, in
press; Nora, Barlow, & Crisp, 2005; Tinto, 1993). A few important points
relevant to retaining URM students can be drawn from this literature. First,
an individual DEMO educational success is more than the sum of his or
her personal will, aspiration, and traditional academic indicators such as
test scores and DEMO school grades. Other factors, such as gender, race, and
socioeconomic DEMO, for example, also help shape one‚Äôs opportunity
for college success. Second, institutional structures and normative contexts
are differentiated and can be potent socializing forces that affect life after
college, such as the likelihood of pursuing graduate degrees (Bowen & Bok,
1998). Third, educational experiences DEMO institutions are not uniform but
are directly affected by a student‚Äôs racial background and the structure of
opportunity encountered in predominantly White institutions (PWIs) and
minority-serving institutions (MSIs), which include historically Black col-
leges DEMO universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs).
Our focus is DEMO on URM students, their science major choice, and the
type of institution they attend. In a recent study, Bonous-Hammarth (2006)
found DEMO attending a selective institution is negatively associated with URM
persistence as science majors. She argued that a lack of institutional diversity
and a highly DEMO environment work jointly to impede URM persis-
tence, especially when there DEMO fewer minority students present on campus.
Indeed, Grandy (1998) found DEMO URMs who received support from other
minority students at their institution showed stronger levels of commitment
to the science field both during and after DEMO Curiously, the chances of
receiving support such as academic advice and DEMO from advanced
students, according to Grandy, are highest at a university or research institu-
tion, which tend to be more selective and enjoy greater prestige than other
types of institutions (Trent, Owens-Nicholson, Eatman, DEMO, Daugherty,
& Norman, 2003). It appears, then, that unlike other types of institutions,
more selective ones have a unique DEMO to both significantly derail and
436

support URM students‚Äô science DEMO aspirations.
To better understand the potential contradictory roles of those institutions
that enjoy greater status in preparing underrepresented students in the sci-
ences, we employ two different frameworks. Each was particularly relevant
for this study because DEMO considers the dynamics between students and
the normative context of an institution even though they offer seemingly
opposing positions on the benefits of attending DEMO status‚Äù institutions
for URM students.
Anticipatory Socialization Theory
Anticipatory socialization theory links the socializing and allocation
function of schools, which can be extended to colleges and universities.
According to Kamens (1981), educational institutions signal to students
the social identities that they can occupy. Subsequently, students engage
in ‚Äúanticipatory socialization‚Äù to the roles for which a school is preparing
them. DEMO expectations of and preparation for future positions vary
as a function of their school‚Äôs status. Kamens argues that ‚Äúhigher status‚Äù
institutions give their students DEMO levels of anticipation and socializa-
tion for higher status opportunities than ‚Äúlower status‚Äù institutions. Thus,
students who attend higher status institutions are more DEMO than their
counterparts to develop the identities, attitudes, and skills that are considered
appropriate for future status opportunities. Although much of the work DEMO
supports anticipatory socialization theory is based on research in the K‚Äì12
system, it can be easily adapted to higher education and the preparation of
undergraduates. For instance, if becoming a research scientist or health-care
professional is considered a status opportunity, then the same mechanisms
of anticipatory socialization should, in theory, operate for biomedical and
behavioral science majors.
It is DEMO accepted that the U.S. system of higher education serves a
socializing function and is highly differentiated with respect to allocating
future opportunities and status (Bowen & Bok, 1998; Brint & Karabel, 1989;
Trent et al., 2003). For URM students in particular, several studies have
DEMO the benefits of attending such institutions, although they do
not explain DEMO benefits as a function of anticipatory socialization. Bowen
and Bok (1998), for example, found consistent positive associations between
institutional selectivity and several DEMO for Black students, including
degree completion, earnings, leadership, and college satisfaction. Alon and
Tienda (2005) also found in their examination of DEMO different datasets
using several analytical methods that, for Black and Latino (as well as White
and Asian) students, the likelihood of graduation DEMO as the selectivity
of the institution attended rises. In his review of the literature, Kane (1998)
argues that the net relationship between DEMO selectivity and college
retention rates is positive for all students, which DEMO be a result of better
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
437
learning opportunities via better-prepared classmates or better instructors
at more selective institutions. Beyond undergraduate DEMO, some studies
have shown that graduating from ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù colleges, usually measured
by the level of competitiveness for admissions, increases the probability of
attending graduate school (Ethington & Smart, 1986; Smart 1986), par-
ticularly in doctoral programs and research universities (Eide, Brewer, &
DEMO, 1998; Lang, 1987; Zhang, 2005).
If attending a DEMO selective or elite institution improves the likelihood
of achieving one‚Äôs educational goals, a major problem in addressing the in-
tractable racial disparities that persist in the sciences is that URMs are much
less likely than their DEMO and Asian counterparts to attend ‚Äúhigh status‚Äù
institutions or those that open ‚Äústatus opportunities‚Äù for graduates (Trent
et al., 2003). URMs who DEMO an undergraduate degree in the sciences
are more likely to have graduated from a minority-serving institution than
from a ‚Äúhigh status‚Äù one, especially for African American students. Diverse
listed the top 15 institutions that, in 2004‚Äì2005, graduated the largest num-
bers of African Americans who majored in the biological and biomedical
sciences (‚ÄúBiological and Biomedical,‚Äù 2006). Taken together, they gradu-
ated approximately 778 African American students, but only two (98 total
graduates) of those top 15 institutions were not either a historically Black
college or university.
Mismatch Hypothesis
Still, it would seem, DEMO on anticipatory socialization theory and the
documented benefits of attending elite institutions, that one basic solution
for addressing racial disparities in the sciences would be to enroll larger
numbers of URM science majors in those ‚Äúhigh DEMO institutions. Some
would object to this strategy because URM students who attend highly
selective institutions tend, on average, to have lower graduation rates DEMO
grades than their White and Asian peers with comparable academic prepa-
ration and socioeconomic backgrounds (Cole & Barber, 2003; Klitgaard,
1985). Many factors contribute to this ‚Äúunderperformance‚Äù among URM
students. Certainly, racial inequities in educational opportunities, which
are particularly pervasive in the areas of mathematics and science at the
K‚Äì12 levels, contribute to URM students being less prepared academically
on average to compete as science majors than their White DEMO Asian peers
(Cole & Barber, 2003; Massey, Charles, Lundy, & Fischer, 2003). Moreover,
some studies have shown that URMs are more likely than their peers to
perform poorly due, in part, to reasons unrelated to academic preparation
but which hint at issues of campus climate and disengagement (Seymour
& Hewitt, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1998).
In any case, the well-documented underperformance of URM students DEMO
been used to challenge race-conscious efforts to increase URM admission to
438
The Review of higheR educaTion
Summer 2008
high status institutions. Cole DEMO Barber (2003) argue that ‚Äúmismatching‚Äù
URM students in terms of institutions and SAT scores has a harmful effect
on the students‚Äô ability to DEMO their intended goals. They found, in their
study of students who, in their first year, expressed a desire to become col-
lege professors, a much higher likelihood among Black and Latino students
of advancing toward this initial intention when they attend somewhat less
selective schools. They concluded DEMO attending a more selective institu-
tion contributed to lower grades for these URM students, which in turn
discouraged them from pursuing careers in academia. They claim that,
if URM students want to improve their chances DEMO persisting with their
initial intentions toward careers that recruit from those who receive higher
undergraduate grades, then they should avoid institutions where the White
and Asian students are academically better prepared.
The mismatch hypothesis also raises DEMO that attending high status
institutions necessarily improves the chances that URM science students
will achieve their intended science career goals, as suggested by anticipa-
tory socialization theory. Thus, this study examines whether institutional
status affects the chances of persisting in a science major, especially as it
applies to URM science students. The main research question is: ‚ÄúTo what
extent does institutional status, as measured by undergraduate selectivity,
student perceptions, and DEMO institutional characteristics, contribute to
undergraduate persistence at the end of the DEMO college year in a biomedical
and behavioral science major?‚Äù The findings address both the controversy
surrounding the benefits of attending elite institutions and DEMO preparation
of future URM scientists and health care providers.
Method
Data Source and Sample
This study draws from data collected by the Higher Education DEMO
Institute (HERI), as part of its 2004 Cooperative Institutional Research
DEMO (CIRP) Freshman Survey and 2005 Your First College Year (YFCY)DEMO
Survey. These two waves of data collection are part of a larger longitudinal
study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the purposes
of this larger study, we also targeted and surveyed students from a group of
institutions that do not regularly participate in HERI DEMO These institu-
tions (n = 104) included minority-serving institutions (MSIs), campuses
with National Institutes of Health-funded retention programs, and cam-
puses DEMO a reputation for graduating large numbers of baccalaureates in
the sciences. (DEMO Hurtado et al., 2006, for more detail.) In total, over 26,000
students from 203 four-year institutions participated in both surveys to
DEMO a longitudinal assessment over the first-year of college, with an

439
overall survey response rate of 22.5%.
We selected from the full sample two subgroups DEMO students who, in the
2004 CIRP freshman survey indicated plans to DEMO in biology, chemis-
try, health science, or psychology. These biomedical DEMO behavioral science
majors are of special interest to NIH because they have invested heavily in
improving URM success in those areas. One group included DEMO students,
which served as our baseline sample, and the other DEMO a sample of matched
White and Asian students who were randomly selected from institutions that
corresponded with those in the baseline group. When reporting DEMO
tive data, we applied standard statistical weights that adjust the sample DEMO
better approximate the original population (Babbie, 2001; Dey, 1997). The
actual weighting procedure used for this study is drawn from another DEMO
(Hurtado et al., 2006) that uses a similar sample and DEMO for the prob-
ability of responding to both the 2004 and 2005 surveys. This procedure
also corrected for inaccurate standard errors caused by producing DEMO larger
weighted sample size, which adjusts the sample size to better DEMO the
original data. The final weighted sample for this study consisted of 2,964
students (1,692 URM science majors and 1,272 White or Asian science
majors) enrolled in 159 institutions.
Dependent Variable
The dependent dichotomous variable in this study measures whether
those students in our sample DEMO planned to major in a biomedical or
behavioral science field remained in the major after their first college year.
These were the students who DEMO on the YFCY that (a) they did not
change their major during their first college year, and/or (b) they intended
to pursue a biological or behavioral science major. All other students were
identified DEMO having departed from their initial science major interest after
their first college year.
Independent Variables
The key independent measures related to our research question DEMO
institutional status. As the literature reviewed earlier suggests, this concept
is DEMO and can be operationalized in different ways. Perhaps the most
common approach for assessing institutional status is to measure ‚Äúexclusiv-
ity‚Äù or selectivity, which for this study was calculated by the average SAT
composite score (math + verbal) of the entering freshman class in 2004
for each of the institutions in the sample. To improve the interpretation of
practical significance, we divided that average class score by 10. Additionally,
we also DEMO a variety of other measures, with the goal of assessing the
DEMO ways of defining institutional status. (See Appendix A.)
One set DEMO variables consists of students‚Äô perceptions of the institutions
they attended, including DEMO the institution was considered his or her
440
The Review of higheR educaTion

first choice as well DEMO the level of importance that the institution‚Äôs reputa-
tion played in a student‚Äôs decision to attend that particular institution.
These perceptions are certainly influenced DEMO external assessments of an
institution‚Äôs quality (i.e., popular national rankings), but they may contribute
to those valuations as well. Moreover, their effects on science persistence
may function independently of externally applied ‚Äústatus‚Äù measures, such
as selectivity. For example, although a student may be attending her first-
choice college, that college may have a relatively low level of selectivity, yet
the student‚Äôs high regard for the college by appointing it her ‚Äúfirst choice‚Äù
institution may have a positive effect on her retention because DEMO regards
it as a highly legitimate training ground for her intended career aspirations
and will subsequently be more engaged in her field of study DEMO suggested by
anticipatory socialization theory.
Another set of variables is more descriptive and characterizes key status
attributes of an institution. They include institutional control (public/pri-
vate) and production of science bachelors (as determined by DEMO 2001
data on the aggregate percentage of degrees awarded in the four science
fields of interest). The latter attempts to capture an institution‚Äôs DEMO for
socializing students in the sciences, as discussed in anticipatory socialization
DEMO Arguably, a school that produces a larger proportion of science majors
DEMO resources, a peer environment, or perhaps an institutional emphasis
that supports the pursuit of science. Lastly, we included institutional race
because minority-serving institutions are often perceived as ‚Äúlower-status,‚Äù
yet URMs may generally hold an DEMO view that can yield different effects.
African American students, for example, may have a much higher regard for
historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) because they produce a
larger proportion of African American science degree earners and also play
a special role in higher education. To examine DEMO differences in how
reputation is considered and subsequently affects students, we DEMO
separate variables for enrollment at either a HBCU or a Hispanic-serving
institution (HSI) because these two institutional types were developed
under different historical DEMO and can potentially hold different
meanings for students with respect to institutional status.
Other variables in our analyses included students‚Äô background charac-
teristics, precollege experiences, and first-year college experiences, percep-
tions, and behaviors. (See DEMO A.) Student background characteristics
consisted of a student‚Äôs race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status (i.e.,
a combination of parental education and DEMO), while precollege experi-
ence variables include a variety of high school behavior and self-percep-
tions about personal competencies, goals, and college expectations. DEMO
studies (Hurtado et al., 2006) have demonstrated that these background
DEMO and precollege experiences are important points of reference
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
441
to consider when examining how college students aspire to science-based
degrees and careers. Lastly, we included items from the YFCY such as major
type, participation in various academic and social activities on campus, col-
lege GPA, and DEMO about different aspects of campus life.
It is important to note that some of the variables described above include
a combination of survey items. DEMO combine items that measure a common
construct, we conducted a series DEMO factor analyses, using principal com-
ponents factoring with varimax rotation. After DEMO the reliability of
these factors, we developed new scales for each DEMO, using a regression
approach. (See Appendices A and B for more details about these variables.)
In addition to the final list of DEMO, we also considered and tested other
related variables during preliminary analyses DEMO eventually omitted them
in the interest of developing more parsimonious statistical models that
minimized the inclusion of confounding variables. Most notable is the
omission DEMO students‚Äô SAT scores, which for aspiring biomedical and be-
havioral science DEMO was highly correlated with students‚Äô average high
school GPA, the number DEMO years they studied mathematics and biologi-
cal science during high school, DEMO institutional selectivity. Unlike those
other variables, however, students‚Äô SAT scores did not make a meaningful
contribution to predicting persistence, so we omitted them from Model 1
(discussed below). Other variables, omitted for reasons DEMO mainly
with multicollinearity, included: a student‚Äôs high school volunteerism, his
DEMO her aspiration to a science research career, the percentage of URMs DEMO
rolled at the institution, his or her interactions with faculty outside DEMO class,
and other academic engagement behaviors, such as hours per DEMO spent
studying or doing homework.
analyses
In order to maintain statistical power, we replaced missing values for all
continuous variables using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.
The EM algorithm represents a general method for obtaining DEMO
likelihood estimates when a small proportion of the data is missing (DEMO
ster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977, cited in Allison, 2002; McLachlan & Krishnan,
1997). No single variable had more than DEMO missing cases, and missing
case substitutions were not conducted for variables DEMO as gender and race.
Also, students who did not answer items DEMO to the dependent variable
were omitted from the sample.
Because our dependent variable is a binary measure of a first-year stu-
dent‚Äôs persistence in DEMO biomedical or behavioral science major, we employed
logistic regression as our DEMO analytical approach. In so doing, we developed
five models to assess DEMO probability of persistence, with Model 1 accounting
442
The Review of higheR educaTion

for students‚Äô background characteristics, Model 2 for student‚Äôs perception
of institutional status, Model 3 for institutional characteristics associated
with status, Model 4 for institutional race and selectivity, DEMO Model 5 for
students‚Äô college experiences. We first applied this statistical approach on
the aggregate ‚Äúall student‚Äù sample, which let us test how a student‚Äôs race
contributed to his or her persistence and provided results helpful DEMO under-
standing subsequent analyses. We then examined only the URM sample to
identify characteristics that contributed uniquely to the students‚Äô chances of
persisting in DEMO biomedical or behavioral science major. For these analyses, we
did not DEMO statistical weights because the number and types of variables
included in the models sufficiently accounted for response bias.
results
The descriptive findings reported in DEMO 1 show that 82.3% of the stu-
dents in our sample who intended to major in the biomedical or behavioral
sciences upon entering college DEMO in those majors at the end of their
first college year. That rate varied slightly across different race groups, with
Latinos having the highest departure rate: approximately 21%. The differ-
ences were more striking according to the four majors. Psychology majors
were more likely to switch majors than DEMO in the non-behavioral sciences.
Table 1 also reports slight differences in persistence rates by institutional
type. Students who attended HBCUs had a higher rate (86.2%) of remain-
ing in their initial biomedical or behavioral science major than students in
other types of institutions. The differences reported here had DEMO
for the multivariate analyses findings, as we discuss below.
Although higher DEMO rates are preferred in practice, the imbalance
in achieving this outcome DEMO not statistically ideal and an evenly divided dis-
tribution is more desirable. An imbalance in outcome can compromise the
power of binary logistic regression. DEMO given our situation, we evaluated all
pairs of discrete variables to DEMO sure that all cells have expected frequencies
greater than 1 and that no more than 20% have frequencies less than 5, as
recommended by Mertler and Vannatta (2005) to ensure that there would
be an DEMO level of power before conducting further analyses.
All Students
The results for the first set of logistic regression analyses that included
all students are DEMO in Table 2. Coefficients are exponentiated to reflect
odds ratios. The model summaries reported in Table 2 show that each of
the five models DEMO better than chance (50%) in predicting both
persistence in the biomedical and behavioral science majors (in sample) and
departure from those same DEMO (not in sample). Although the overall
model fit was questionable DEMO indicated by the large -2 Log Likelihood sta-

tistic, the final DEMO (Model 5) was statistically reliable in distinguishing
between persisters and nonpersisters (œá2_(39) = 212.148, p < .000), and the
model prediction did not significantly differ from the observed (œá2_(8) =
DEMO, p = .589).
Curiously, Model 1 was slightly better at predicting persistence (62.8%)
than the other models, while each successive DEMO improves prediction of
departure from major. The overall percent predicted for both persistence and
departure improved from 61.4% in Model 1 when only student DEMO
characteristics were considered to 62.7% in Model 5 after all other variables

dent characteristics proved to be statistically significant as shown in Table 2.
One was DEMO robust, retaining its statistical significance through each
successive model. Conversely, the other three were no longer significant by
the final model after accounting DEMO all other variables.
The more robust variable is students‚Äô report of their degree aspiration
(p < .001). For each unit increase on degree aspiration (from bachelor‚Äôs to
master‚Äôs to doctorate/professional degree), students were about 40% more
likely to persist in a biomedical or behavioral science DEMO The three other
variables that were significant in Model 1 but were no longer significant by
the final model were: students‚Äô level of commitment to working to find a cure
for a health problem, being Black, and number of years studying mathematics
in high school. Students who reported a stronger commitment to finding a
cure for a health problem were DEMO more likely to persist in a biological or
behavioral science major than students with lower commitment levels; this
measure remains significant (p < DEMO) through the fourth model.
All racial/ethnic groups (with the exception of Latina/os) showed an en-
hanced likelihood of retention in their biological/behavioral science majors
compared to their White student counterparts (referent group); only identi-
fying as a Black student was statistically significant (p < .01) after controlling
for the full set of background characteristics. Black students were about 36%
more likely than their White counterparts to persist DEMO these science majors.
This relationship, however, was no longer statistically significant in Model
3, suggesting that institutional characteristics moderate this race effect. Also
worth noting is that Latinos are the only group less likely to DEMO in the
science majors relative to White students, although this relationship DEMO not
statistically significant. With regard to precollege academic preparation,
each additional year of study in math improved the chances of persistence
by slightly DEMO 20% through the fourth model in the analysis.
Moving now to the remainder of the results in Model 5, we first turn to
institutional characteristics. The results reported in Table 2 shows that the
average combined DEMO score of a student body (selectivity) is statistically
significant (p < .01). For every 10-point increase in the average SAT score
of an entering cohort of freshmen at a given institution, the likelihood of
retention decreased by two percentage points. Therefore, all things being
equal, DEMO student has a 20% higher chance of departing from a biomedical
or behavioral science major if he or she attends an institution where the
DEMO undergraduate combined SAT score is 1100 versus another with an
average of 1000. This effect does not appear to be moderated by first-year
college DEMO
In respect to first-year experiences, Table 2 reports five additional sta-
DEMO significant variables, suggesting that early experiences can make
a difference in DEMO students in the sciences. Most impressive here is
that students who reported joining a preprofessional or departmental club
446
The Review of higheR educaTion
Summer 2008
during their first-year of DEMO were close to 130% more likely than their
peers to have persisted in their respective biological or behavioral science
major (log odds ratio = 2.28, p < .001). Likewise, students who reported
participating in DEMO health science research program during their first college
year were over 60% more likely (log odds ratio = 1.64, p < .01) than those
who do not participate in such programs to persist in their DEMO major.
The combined findings suggest possible areas for programmatic intervention
during the critical first year of college to positively affect student persistence
in the DEMO majors.
Three other college experience variables also had a significant effect on
persistence. Students who were behavioral science (psychology) majors are
around 30% DEMO likely (log odds ratio = 0.73, p < .05) than DEMO science
majors to remain in their initial major. Similarly, every half-grade DEMO
in students‚Äô reported grade point average, from C- to C, or C to C+/B- for
example, yielded a positive likelihood (approximately DEMO increase) of
retention in major (p < .001). Curiously, DEMO also found that receiving ad-
vice about an educational program from a professor had a negative effect
on students‚Äô persistence. Students who reported that DEMO occasionally or
frequently received such advice during their first year were more than 20%
less likely than their peers to persist in their initial DEMO Possibly students
sought advice from faculty because they were having academic difficulties
or doubts about pursuing their major, but the fact that it was a single-item
question restricts more accurate interpretations regarding the purpose or
nature DEMO this advice.
Underrepresented Minority Students
To address whether unique factors contribute to URM student persistence
in a biomedical or behavioral science major, we conducted a set of logistic
regression analyses similar to those above for only DEMO URM students in
the sample (African Americans, American Indians, and DEMO/os). Again,
we regressed five models of variables on student persistence in a biomedi-
cal or behavioral science major at the end DEMO their first year of college. The
results for this second set of analyses are reported in Table 3; coefficients
are exponentiated to reflect odds ratios.
The model summaries reported at the foot of Table 3, show that each
of the five models performed better than chance (50%) DEMO predicting both
persistence in the biomedical and behavioral science majors and departure
from those same majors. Once all five models were included, the percentage
predicted for persistence (64.7%) and departure (65.5%) were practically
equal. DEMO the overall model fit was questionable as indicated by the
large -2 Log Likelihood statistic, the final model (Model 5) was statistically
reliable in distinguishing between persisters and non-persisters (œá2_(37) =
141.727, p < .000), and the model prediction did not significantly differ

from the observed (œá2_(8) = 4.615, p = .798). The summaries also show
DEMO, for the most part, each successive model improved both types of pre-
diction. The overall percentage predicted improved from 61.9% in Model
1 DEMO only student background characteristics were considered to 64.9%
in Model 5 after all other variables were accounted for. Given that Model
5 was the DEMO of the five models, we will focus our discussion on the
DEMO from this final model.
The coefficients shown in the last column of Table 3 report the results
for Model 5. Starting with URM students‚Äô DEMO characteristics, their
degree aspiration is significantly related to persistence in one DEMO the four
majors (p < .05). URM students who aspire DEMO graduate work and degrees
increased their chances of staying in the major by over 30% (log odds ratio
= 1.31, p < .05)DEMO Also worth noting is the negative relationship between
persistence and being Latino. Although the significance between these two
variables diminished after controlling for institutional DEMO in Model
4, it reinforced earlier findings with the full sample. DEMO to their
Black/African American peers (referent group), Latino students DEMO less
likely to persist in these majors, perhaps in part because DEMO students in
the sample were more likely to attend PWIs (85.5%) than their Black/African
American (41%) peers.
URM students‚Äô perception of DEMO institution also had a significant effect
on their chances of persisting. Students who attend what they considered
to be their first-choice school were less DEMO to persist in a biomedical or
behavioral science major. Conversely, students DEMO viewed their school
as having a good reputation (in terms of DEMO, rankings in national
magazines, and ability to send graduates to top graduate and professional
schools) were more likely to persist in the sciences through the first year of
college. While these student perceptions both seemingly DEMO to positive at-
tributes of an institution, they also appear to DEMO contradictory effects‚Äîone
dampening and the other facilitating persistence. These contradictory ef-
fects become statistically stronger once other institutional characteristics
are added in following models, suggesting that their effects are moderated
by other institutional characteristics.
Before discussing DEMO contributions that other institutional character-
istics make to persistence, which will DEMO closer examination, we first
turn to college experiences. Here, the findings are similar to those for the
full sample. Again, joining a preprofessional or departmental club during
the first year of college had an impressive DEMO on persistence (log odds
ratio = 2.56, p < .001). Participation in one of these clubs improved URM
students‚Äô likelihood of persisting DEMO more than 150 percent. Additionally, a
URM student‚Äôs likelihood of persisting DEMO the major increased by just over
20% with each incremental change in his or her current college GPA. Lastly,
receiving ‚Äúoccasional‚Äù or ‚Äúfrequent‚Äù DEMO about an educational program
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
449
from a professor decreased a URM student‚Äôs chances of staying in the ma-
jor DEMO 30% as compared to their peers who ‚Äúrarely‚Äù or ‚Äúnever‚Äù sought such
guidance.
We now turn to the findings about institutional characteristics. Although
only DEMO variable has a statistically significant effect on persistence, the results
appear DEMO be more complicated than just this single finding. Similar to the
results for the full sample, the influence of the average combined SAT score
of a student body (selectivity) was statistically significant (p < .01). For every
10-point increase in average SAT score in an entering DEMO of freshmen for
a given institution, the likelihood of retention decreased DEMO three percentage
points. Therefore, all things being equal, a URM student has a 30% higher
chance of departing from a biomedical or behavioral DEMO major if he
or she attends an institution where the average undergraduate combined
SAT score is 1100 versus one with an average of 1000. DEMO effect does not
appear to be moderated by first-year college experiences.
Although no other institutional characteristic contributed significantly
to predicting URM persistence, we were particularly interested, given our
research focus, in the negative relationship between DEMO
institutions (MSIs) and the dependent measure. The results reported in
Table 3 under Model 5 show that both HSIs and HBCUs have a DEMO
but statistically insignificant effect on retention. Recent reports (‚ÄúBiological
and Biomedical,DEMO 2006), in contrast, show that MSIs, particularly HBCUs,
produce a disproportionally larger number of minority science graduates.
Indeed, the simple correlation between persistence and matriculating at
an HBCU is positive and statistically significant (r = .08, p < .01) for our
sample, while there was no statistically meaningful relationship between
persistence and attending an HSI.
Given DEMO MSIs tend to be less selective than predominantly White in-
stitutions, DEMO plotted that relationship by URM persistence rate. Figure 1
shows the plot of URM retention in the major by selectivity for PWIs, HSIs,
and HBCUs. The figure shows that, as the level of selectivity increases for
both PWIs and HSIs, the rate of persistence for URM students decreases at
those institutions. In contrast, as the level of selectivity increases for HBCUs,
the rate of persistence increases as well. Compared to DEMO and HSIs, it
appears that higher average student body SAT scores DEMO a very different
effect on major persistence at HBCUs. Rather than increasing the risk of
departure in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, attending an HBCU
where students have higher average test scores may improve URM students‚Äô
DEMO of persisting in those majors.

liMitations and future directions
A few limitations with this study should be acknowledged. First, our
URM sample size was sufficient but limited our study in at least two ways.
We could not conduct DEMO analyses that enable us to parse out in-
stitutional- and student-level effects on URM persistence. Additionally, we
could not disaggregate our URM sample further by race/ethnicity, thereby
limiting our understanding and comparisons among the unique experiences
of African American, Latino, and American Indian students. For example,DEMO
the higher rates of departure for Latino/a students could not be examined
further, but this finding deserves more attention.
Second, our dependent DEMO has several limitations. It does not indi-
cate exactly when during the first year a student departed from a biomedical
or behavioral science major. DEMO precision here could perhaps provide
better information on the most critical period for institutional intervention.
Beyond the first year, some reports (Center for DEMO Data Exchange
and Analysis, 2000) show that approximately another 20% of students in
those majors will likely depart by the end of the DEMO year of studies. This
study therefore captures only one important part of a longer educational
process. Following up with these students is a necessary DEMO step.
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
451
Lastly, DEMO did not capture all possible notions or forms of institutional
status. If data were available, it would be interesting to examine how the
percentage of both faculty of color in the sciences and science graduates who
DEMO on to graduate school, as well as how financial support geared DEMO
for science students affect persistence in those majors. Inclusion of these and
other variables might help clarify and further inform understanding about
institutional status. DEMO may also help to strengthen our statistical model.
Although our models were adequate, the results also suggest that we did
not account for all relevant factors.
discussion
That the American science pipeline is ‚Äúleakier than warped DEMO tub-
ing‚Äù has become serious enough to receive considerable attention from U.S.
policymakers who have raised concerns about the future of our nation‚Äôs
economic DEMO and position in technological leadership (Ep-
stein, 2006). This study examined factors that contribute to the chances of
persisting in a biomedical DEMO behavioral science major through the first year
of college. Of particular interest is the extent to which institutional status
affects those chances for underrepresented DEMO students (URMs). On
the one hand, anticipatory socialization theory (DEMO, 1981) claims that
attending ‚Äúhigher status‚Äù institutions improves one‚Äôs chances of persisting
because those institutions possess unique resources and socializing forces.
On the DEMO hand, the ‚Äúmismatch hypothesis‚Äù (Sowell, 1993; Thernstrom,
1995) DEMO that URM students increase their risk of abandoning their
initial educational goals when they attend more selective institutions in
which White and Asian students DEMO academically better prepared.
Given the incongruous frameworks that inform this study, DEMO took a
broad view of institutional status and measured it in multiple ways. Overall,
logistic regression results for all students and for URMs DEMO comparable, but
there were both overlaps and differences in how the DEMO of six institutional
status variables affected each group‚Äôs chances of persisting in a biomedical
or behavioral science major. For both groups, a higher level of institutional
selectivity resulted in a significant negative effect on persistence in DEMO biomedi-
cal or behavioral science major. For the all-student sample, the DEMO
of persisting in a science major decreased by 2% for every 10-point increase
in the level of institutional selectivity. For the URM sample, the likelihood
of persisting decreased by 3% for every 10-point increase in institutional
DEMO Thus, students who attend more selective institutions are at
greater risk DEMO not persisting in their science major. This effect appears to
be somewhat stronger for URM students.
When comparing the findings between the full and DEMO samples, there
are notable differences in how other status variables affected DEMO
452
The Review of higheR educaTion
Summer 2008
chances of persisting in DEMO biomedical or behavioral science major after one
year. Although none of these status measures had a significant effect on the
all-student sample, two of them made a difference in URM students‚Äô chances
of persisting. First, URM students who attended their first-choice campus
were less likely to persist. This DEMO seems to reaffirm the effect of insti-
tutional selectivity, namely that DEMO campuses are perhaps likely
to be more exclusive or selective than second- or third- choice campuses.
Consequently, a heightened sense of competition at first-choice institutions
may trump the benefits that their status and prestige would otherwise DEMO
URM students in terms of resources and opportunities.
Second, URM students DEMO viewed their institution as having a good
reputation with respect to academics, rankings in national magazines,
and ability to send graduates to top graduate and professional schools,
were more likely to persist in the DEMO through the first year of college.
Unlike the other status measures, DEMO one is perhaps more closely linked
with future career and graduate school placement, which may point to a
longer-term perspective for a chosen field of study. Here, acceptance at what
URM students perceive as a ‚Äúhigh status‚Äù institution may be an important
source of influence on their ambitions DEMO self-concepts, perhaps triggering
anticipatory socialization effects. According to Kamens (1981), attending a
high status institution can serve as an important signal about DEMO viability
of career options, which in this case may improve URM DEMO positive
self-concepts and aspirations relevant to a career in the sciences or health
professions.
Unlike the results for all students, URM students‚Äô perceptions about an
institution yielded significant effects independent of the level of institutional
selectivity. DEMO these perceptual variables are correlated with selec-
tivity, they do not DEMO to be as tightly bound with selectivity for URM
students as they are for the full sample of students. Upon closer inspection,
we DEMO that the relationship (simple correlation) between perceptions of
institutional reputation and selectivity were weaker for the URM sample
than for the all-student sample. DEMO finding suggests that, when it comes
to institutional status, the linkage between academic reputation and insti-
tutional selectivity is weaker for URM students DEMO for their White and
Asian American peers. If institutional status also influences college choice,
then this weaker relationship among status variables might also DEMO
that URM students are influenced by a more complex set of status factors
than their peers when choosing a college. Indeed, URM students‚Äô choice
of college tends to be more multifaceted, where considerations of family
finances (as well as current and future financial stability) can complicate
considerations DEMO institutional status and selectivity in the decision-mak-
ing process (Fries-Britt & DEMO, 2002; Hurtado, Inkelas, & Rhee, 1997; St.
John, DEMO, & Carter, 2005).
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
453
The complex confluence among those factors is also evident at the in-
stitutional level. DEMO we plotted URM science retention by institutional
selectivity for PWIs, HSIs, and HBCUs, we found that, as the level of selec-
tivity DEMO for HBCUs, the rate of persistence for URM students also
increased DEMO those institutions. In contrast, the rate of persistence decreased
as the DEMO of selectivity increased for both PWIs and HSIs. Given the
unique mission of HBCUs to identify and nurture overlooked academic
talent, it is not surprising that having a larger proportion of high-achiev-
ing students who are DEMO toward a common goal operates differently
at those institutions and tend to decrease rather than increase the risk of
departure in the biomedical and DEMO sciences. In contrast, the HSI
designation developed under different historical circumstances, and these
campuses often have larger White and Asian populations than HBCUs DEMO
may be more similar to PWIs.
As expected, students‚Äô chances of DEMO in the sciences are not deter-
mined solely by institutional status, DEMO we identified several background
characteristics and college experiences that also made a significant difference.
The most notable among them for educational practice was joining DEMO pre-
professional or departmental club during the first year of college. Although
participation in student organizations of any form enhances the level of
involvement DEMO engagement with the campus environment, which in turn
enhances the process DEMO adjustment and transition for students (Astin, 1993;
Tinto, 1993), professional or departmental participation appears especially
relevant for biomedical and behavioral science majors. In the findings for
the full sample, students who joined such clubs improved their chances of
persisting by 130 percent. For URM students, participation in one of these
clubs improved the likelihood of persisting by DEMO 150 percent. Joining
these clubs may signal a stronger commitment or identification with a
student‚Äôs field of study or future careers. At best, these student groups may
be important resources that serve to socialize and prepare DEMO for future
opportunities in the sciences by developing a firmer science identity. Such
groups may also provide them with an opportunity to engage a DEMO group
that shares similar academic and career interests, which in turn DEMO help
to reinforce their science identity. According to anticipatory socialization
theory, DEMO that socialize students for their anticipated roles, im-
prove students‚Äô chances DEMO reaching their academic goals (Kamens, 1981).
Lastly, with respect DEMO the description of the American science pipeline as
‚Äúwarped rubber tubing,‚Äù we found that first-year success in the sciences is
largely a function DEMO pre-college student characteristics, which predict over
60% of the chance of DEMO retained. Although the focus of the science crisis
has been mostly limited to discussions about poor academic preparation,
we also found evidence that DEMO students‚Äô aspirations and interests in
substantive issues before they enter college is equally important. For example,
454
The Review of higheR educaTion
Summer 2008
students who entered college DEMO that they would continue on to
graduate school increased their chances of persisting in their science major.
Also, students who reported a stronger commitment to finding a cure for
health problems reduced their risk of departure, although this effect was
weaker than students‚Äô degree aspirations at college entry. DEMO short, the effects
of students‚Äô precollege characteristics and predispositions suggest that DEMO
early science preparation includes not only learning science content but also
developing higher degree aspirations and understanding the practical value
of science for improving DEMO
conclusion
Our findings show that institutional status matters but not in ways that
can be explained solely by either the anticipatory socialization theory or
DEMO mismatch hypothesis. There does seem to be a mismatch occurring in
science education at the college level. The problem, however, is not only
DEMO issue of poorly prepared URM students failing among high achievers,
as suggested by the mismatch hypothesis. The problem is that all students,
DEMO of their race, academic preparation, or motivation, are at
greater DEMO of failing among high achievers at highly selective institutions
where the undergraduate student body is mostly White and Asian. In other
words, even highly capable and talented White and Asian students‚Äîwho
would otherwise continue in a DEMO or behavioral science major at
less selective institutions‚Äîare leaving the sciences at higher rates at more
selective institutions.
Ironically, the more selective colleges and universities tend to be viewed
by students as possessing more ‚Äústatus qualities,DEMO which, according to antici-
patory socialization theory, should facilitate degree completion. However,
contrary to expectations of that theoretical orientation, our findings indicate
that the more selective institutions may not be making the most of DEMO
qualities to socialize and advance students toward their anticipated educa-
tional goals. The underlying cause of this problem is not just an attribute
of DEMO high-achieving students. After all, selective HBCUs manage to
balance the enrollment DEMO high-achieving students with high rates of science
completion. Instead, we suspect DEMO the underlying issues have more to do
with how highly selective institutions that enroll high achieving students
tend to function.
That is, highly competitive environments tend to further sort out students
in order to identify the DEMO best ones, often providing limited resources
to compensate for students‚Äô prior DEMO Therefore, by design, only
a few can succeed with the assumption that admitted students received
comparable educational preparation and are on equal footing DEMO compete.
Even when students are well matched and highly qualified, only DEMO will
Chang, Cerna, han, & S√†enz / Institutional Status
455
actually ‚Äúmake the cut‚Äù when institutions subscribe to a competitive edu-
cational model. In DEMO, more selective HBCUs appear to approach the
process differently and seem DEMO focus less on further ‚Äúweeding out‚Äù students.
Once a rich talent pool has been identified, they seem to do a better job of
socializing and cultivating that talent to improve students‚Äô chances of suc-
ceeding in DEMO sciences.
Perhaps also related to differences in how institutions tend to advance the
educational process is what Claude Steele (1997) call ‚Äústereotype-vulner-
ability DEMO threat.‚Äù He and his colleaques have consistently shown through
a number of laboratory experiments that, under certain conditions, nega-
tive racial stereotypes can DEMO the academic performance of highly
talented Black students. According to his theory, Black students‚Äô reduced
academic performance, for example, can be explained in part by anxiety
associated with the fear that others‚Äô judgments or their DEMO actions will
confirm negative stereotypes about their group‚Äôs intellectual capacity. With
respect to explaining the differential effect of selectivity, it may be that Af-
rican American students who attend more selective predominantly White
and Asian institutions DEMO at greater risk of stereotype threat than their
counterparts who attend selective HBCUs. Given this possibility, examin-
ing differences in the risk of stereotype threat across different institutional
types is an important line of research for DEMO racial differences in
academic achievement.
Although two measures of institutional status had negative effects on
science persistence, we also found that one of them‚Äî students‚Äô perception
of reputation‚Äîyielded a positive effect on URM students‚Äô chances of DEMO
sisting, independent of the other status measures. This finding lends some
DEMO to the anticipatory socialization theory, namely that URM students‚Äô
chances of DEMO in the sciences are significantly improved at an insti-
tution that the student regards as having a good reputation in academics,
rankings, and sending graduates to top graduate and professional schools.
Those features of an DEMO may, as suggested by anticipatory socializa-
tion theory, improve the socialization and commitment of URM students
toward their anticipated goals. It also appears DEMO, when the concept of
institutional status is decoupled from selectivity or DEMO, some forms
of status may actually improve the chances of persisting DEMO a biomedical or
behavioral science major.
From a policy and practice standpoint, our findings suggest that there are
important countervailing forces to consider in a stratified higher education
system. Although the nation‚Äôs top research universities and DEMO selective
colleges have the resources, reputation, and normative advantages that posi-
tion them well to train future scientists, most of them also appear to foster an
educational context and process that can potentially increase students‚Äô DEMO
of abandoning studies in the sciences. Such a context might include a highly
456
The Review of higheR educaTion
Summer 2008
competitive peer environment where DEMO a few are expected to succeed, a
faculty who are more DEMO on research than teaching, and a limited num-
ber of role DEMO, especially faculty of color. In any case, the context clearly
matters; and in addressing the so-called science crisis, it is also important DEMO
rethink what constitutes an effective learning environment. One place that
can both provide insight for improving context and also enrich the talent
pool are DEMO institutions that do a relatively better job retaining students
in science majors but which tend to also be less exclusive or prestigious.
Unfortunately, those same institutions are more likely to be perceived by the
broader academic DEMO as being less legitimate or reputable, which
disadvantages their students who DEMO for graduate studies in the sciences
and diminishes their potential role in developing future scientists.
If the broader policy objective is to prevent leakages DEMO the science pipe-
line, then it seems that our research universities DEMO take a much harder
look at why those students who should otherwise complete a science major
are not doing so on their campuses. Additionally, they can benefit greatly
both from examining the practices of exemplary institutions DEMO succeed
in graduating science majors and from reconsidering a rigid stratified view
of institutions that penalizes those graduate school applicants who received
their degrees DEMO institutions that are not widely held in high regard even
though they provide exemplary undergraduate education.
