First version received March 2000; ﬁnal DEMO accepted March 2002 (Eds.)
We compare the characteristics of real-world DEMO contracts to their counterparts in ﬁnancial
contracting theory. We do so by studying the actual contracts between venture capitalists (VCs) and
entrepreneurs. The DEMO characteristic of VC ﬁnancings is that they allow VCs to separately
allocate cash ﬂow rights, board rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, and DEMO control rights. We
describe and measure these rights. We then interpret our results in relation to existing ﬁnancial contracting
theories. We also describe the DEMO and the evolution across ﬁnancing rounds of the different rights.
1. INTRODUCTION
There is a large academic literature on the principal–agent problem in ﬁnancial DEMO
The papers in this literature often begin with a situation in which an investor negotiates with
an entrepreneur over the ﬁnancing of a project DEMO company. Despite the large volume of theory,
relatively little empirical work exists that compares the characteristics of real-world ﬁnancial
contracts to their counterparts DEMO ﬁnancial contracting theory.2 In this paper, we attempt to inform
theory DEMO describing in detail the contracts between VCs and entrepreneurs. We compare the
actual contracts to the assumed and predicted ones in different ﬁnancial contracting DEMO
In doing this, we assume that VCs are real-world entities who DEMO approximate the
investors of theory. VCs invest in entrepreneurs who need ﬁnancing to fund a promising venture.
VCs have strong incentives to maximize value, but, at the same time, receive few or no private
beneﬁts DEMO control. Although they are intermediaries, VCs typically receive at least 20% DEMO the
proﬁts on their portfolios.3
We study 213 VC investments in 119 portfolio companies by 14 VC ﬁrms. Each VC
ﬁrm provided the contractual DEMO governing each ﬁnancing round in which the ﬁrm
participated. The VC ﬁrm also provided (if available) the company’s business plan, internal
analyses evaluating the investment, and information on subsequent performance.
We ﬁnd that VC ﬁnancings allow VCs to separately allocate cash ﬂow rights, board rights,
voting rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights. These rights are often DEMO on

observable measures of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance. DEMO general, board rights, voting
rights, and liquidation rights are allocated DEMO that if the ﬁrm performs poorly, the VCs obtain
full control. DEMO performance improves, the entrepreneur retains/obtains more control rights. If
the DEMO performs very well, the VCs retain their cash ﬂow rights, but relinquish most of their
control and liquidation rights.
We also report that DEMO is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions
that make it more expensive for the entrepreneur to leave the ﬁrm, thus mitigating the potential
hold-up problem between the entrepreneur and the investor.
Finally, the cash ﬂow incentives, control rights and contingencies in these contracts are
used more as complements than as substitutes. Ventures in which the VCs have DEMO and
board majorities are also more likely to make the entrepreneur’s equity claim and the release
of committed funds contingent on performance milestones.
Our DEMO have the following implications. First, cash ﬂow rights matter in a DEMO that is
consistent with the principal–agent theories of Holmstrom (1979), DEMO (1986) and others. For¨
example, the entrepreneur’s equity compensation function DEMO more sensitive to performance when
incentive and asymmetric information problems are more severe.
Second, the allocation of control rights between the VC and the entrepreneur is a central
feature of the ﬁnancial contracts. This strongly suggests DEMO despite the prevalence of contingent
contracting, contracts are inherently incomplete. This DEMO gives support to the incomplete
contracting approach pioneered by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990).
Third, cash ﬂow DEMO and control rights can be separated and made contingent on
observable and veriﬁable measures of performance. This is most supportive of theories that
predict DEMO of control to investors in different states, such as Aghion and DEMO (1992) and
Dewatripont and Tirole (1994).
Fourth, the widespread use of non-compete and vesting provisions indicates that VCs care
about the DEMO problem explored in Hart and Moore (1994).
Finally, we think our descriptive results suggest fruitful avenues for future theoretical
research.
The paper DEMO as follows. Section 2 describes our sample. Section 3 describes the VC
contracts. Section 4 compares the empirical results in Section 3 and additional DEMO
analyses to the assumptions and predictions of ﬁnancial contracting theories. Section 5 presents
additional descriptive information regarding the contracts that should be of use DEMO future theory.
Section 6 summarizes and discusses our results.
2. SAMPLE
We analyse 213 VC investments in 119 portfolio companies by 14 VC partnerships.
DEMO Description
To obtain this sample, we asked each VC to provide DEMO information on as many of their
portfolio company investments as they were willing to provide. For each of these companies, the
VCs provided the documents that include all the ﬁnancing terms, the ﬁrm’s equity ownership—
investors, founders, management, etc.—and any contingencies to future ﬁnancing. The VCs also
provided (if available) the portfolio company’s business plan at the time DEMO the ﬁnancing, the VC’s
internal analysis of the investment, and the subsequent portfolio company ﬁnancial performance.
Before we present our results, it is worth pointing out that while we have a great deal of data,DEMO
we do not have complete data on every ﬁnancing round. As a result, the number of observations
varies across our analyses according to the availability of the relevant information.
KAPLAN & STR
OMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 283¨
Table 1 presents summary DEMO Panel A indicates that we have 213 investments in
119 portfolio companies by 14 VC ﬁrms. Ninety-eight of the 213 investments are the ﬁrst DEMO
ﬁnancing rounds.
The VCs commit a median of $4·5 million in equity in each ﬁnancing round. Not all of
the committed ﬁnancing is released DEMO the company immediately, however. The VCs disburse a
median $3·6 million DEMO the time the round closed. The difference between committed ﬁnancing
and the amount that is released at the closing is particularly large for ﬁrst DEMO ﬁnancing
rounds.4
The ﬁnancing amount is the total for all VCs investing in the round. For the remainder of this
paper, we aggregate the holdings of all the VCs investing in the same portfolio company, treating
them as one. As seen from panel A, the median number of VCs involved in each investment is
four, although it is lower for ﬁrst and second ﬁnancing rounds.5
Panel B shows that 166 of the DEMO rounds were completed between 1996 and early
1999, and that 79 DEMO our 119 portfolio companies received their ﬁrst round of VC ﬁnancing
within this period. This sample, therefore, largely reﬂects ﬁnancings completed before the DEMO
increase in VC ﬁnancing in 1999 and 2000.
Panel C shows that each VC ﬁrm provided at most 22 portfolio companies. The average VC
DEMO age is about 13 years (median of 11). According to DEMO Economics’ (VE) rankings,
seven of our VC ﬁrms rank among the 100 largest VCs in the U.S. in funds managed in
1999.6 DEMO median amount of funds managed is $525 million. The VC ﬁrms in our sample,
therefore, seem representative of U.S. VCs, with perhaps DEMO bias towards larger, more established
funds.
Panel D presents the industry DEMO of the portfolio companies in our sample.
Consistent with the VC industry, the greatest percentage of companies, 42%, are in the
information technology and software industries. An additional 13% are in telecommunications.
Both of these DEMO include a number of Internet related investments. This concentration is
roughly consistent with the industry distributions reported in VE.
Panel E presents the geographical DEMO of the portfolio companies in our sample.
The distribution is fairly uniform across California (28%), the Midwest (19%), the North-east
(28%), and elsewhere. Relative to the VC industry as a whole, California ﬁrms are slightly
underrepresented and Midwest ﬁrms are somewhat overrepresented. According to DEMO, 41% of
overall VC investments were in California ﬁrms and only DEMO in Midwest ﬁrms.7
2.2. Sample selection issues
In this section, we DEMO potential selection issues concerning our sample. Our companies and
ﬁnancings are not a random sample in that we obtained the data from 14 VC DEMO with whom
we have a relationship. In addition, only ﬁve of DEMO 14 VC funds, representing 59% of the sample
4. We consider DEMO ﬁnancing round as a set of contracts agreed to on a particular date that determines the
disbursement of funds from a VC to a DEMO A new ﬁnancing round differs from the contingent release of funds
in that the price and terms of the ﬁnancing are not set in DEMO
5. In a typical ﬁnancing, one VC leads the round by DEMO the terms. If the VC chooses to syndicate the
round, other DEMO typically invest on the same terms as the lead VC. It is common for a VC to syndicate ﬁnancings with
the same group of DEMO over time. See Sorensen and Stuart (2001). It is beyond DEMO scope of this paper to consider agency
problems among VC syndicates. Given the repeated nature of syndications, we believe it is reasonable to aggregate
holdings and assume that the VCs in each round act to maximize DEMO
6. VE is one of the two major data services for the VC industry. Venture one is the other. VE provides databases
on VC DEMO in portfolio companies and fundraising by VC partnerships. Two of our VC ﬁrms do not disclose the
amount of funds under management and are DEMO ranked in VE.
7. These ﬁgures are for the period between 1996 and 1999.

Summary information for 213 investments in 119 portfolio companies by 14 venture DEMO partnerships. Investments
were made between December 1986 and April 1999. Reported rounds are the number of rounds completed before 1 May
1999, based on data from VE combined with contract information. Total ﬁnancing committed is the DEMO of equity
ﬁnancing committed to by the VCs in each round. Financing provided up front is the amount of equity ﬁnancing actually
provided to DEMO portfolio company at the round closing. The main location of the VC ﬁrms is either California (CA),
Midwest U.S. (MW), North-east U.S. (NE), or diverse (DIV), i.e. the VC has DEMO ofﬁces and no clear main location.
The VC rank is in terms of funds managed in 1999 and was obtained from VE. Pre-revenue rounds DEMO rounds where
the venture has no revenues at the time of the closing. Repeat entrepreneurs are founders whose previous ventures were
able to go DEMO or were sold to a public company. Industry volatility is the value-weighted volatility of the log stock
return for the venture’s industry according to DEMO Fama and French (1997) industry classiﬁcation. Industry R&D/sales is
the aggregate R&D expense to sales for public ﬁrms in the DEMO three-digit SIC industry according to COMPUSTAT.
Industry log sales, in millions, are for the venture’s four-digit SIC industry according to the 1997 U.S. DEMO Long-term
debt to assets is the median ratio of long-term debt to assets for public ﬁrms in the venture’s three-digit SIC industry
according to DEMO
portfolio companies, gave us either all of the deals from their DEMO fund or all of the deals of a
particular partner.
It is possible that our sample is biased towards more successful investments. By the DEMO
of 1999, 25% of our sample companies had gone public, and another 13% had been acquired.
This is slightly higher than the rates DEMO all ﬁrms funded over all time periods by the VCs in our
sample according to VE (16% IPOs and 15% acquisitions). The higher IPO rate in our sample,
however, largely reﬂects the 1996–1999 period when VC investments were unusually successful.
For the ﬁve VCs for whom DEMO know no selection bias exists, the IPO rates in our sample DEMO
higher than for their overall historical portfolio, 20% compared to 17%. DEMO suggests that there
is at most only a modest bias towards more successful investments in our sample.
Another potential source of selection bias is DEMO we have missing information on some
of the ﬁnancing rounds that our portfolio companies completed. Combining our data with
information from VE, we were able to infer that our 119 portfolio companies completed a total
of DEMO VC ﬁnancing rounds before May 1999 (the last ﬁnancing round in DEMO sample occurred
in April 1999).8 Hence, only 59% of the DEMO rounds completed are included in the sample.
Panel A shows that we have data on 82% of the ﬁrst ﬁnancing rounds, and a smaller percentage
for ensuing rounds. It does not seem that the coverage is DEMO with performance, however.
While we have a somewhat lower fraction of DEMO from ﬁrms that are still private or were
liquidated compared to the ones that were acquired, it is still higher than the fraction for ﬁrms
that eventually went public.
Even if some performance selection biases exist DEMO our sample, we do not think they are of
much concern DEMO our results because we do not attempt to measure performance. Rather, DEMO try
to characterize what contracts look like in general and, perhaps DEMO importantly, what contracts
8. It also is worth pointing out that DEMO VE data are not completely reliable. We found, signiﬁcant inaccuracies in
DEMO of the 213 ﬁnancing rounds we have. Lerner (1994) also acknowledges this problem.

are possible. Moreover, in our regression results, we control for VC ﬁrm ﬁxed effects, which will
pick up DEMO differences in the data from the different VCs.
As mentioned above, DEMO 14 VC ﬁrms that provided data appear to be largely representative
of the overall U.S. VC industry. In addition, because the VC investments are syndicated, the
119 companies in our current sample received VC ﬁnancing from more than 90 additional VC
ﬁrms either in the ﬁnancing round in DEMO sample or in earlier ﬁnancing rounds. A total of more
than 100 different VC ﬁrms, therefore, invested under the terms of the contracts DEMO our sample.
This suggests that the ﬁnancings in our sample are likely to be representative of VC contracts in
general.
To conclude, the likely bias in our sample is that we have selected VC ﬁrms that DEMO better
than average. If this is so, we believe this strengthens DEMO results because we are more likely to
have identiﬁed sophisticated, value DEMO principals.
3. DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS
In this section, we describe the contracts DEMO the portfolio companies/entrepreneurs and the
VCs in great detail. We ﬁrst describe the securities issued. We then describe how these contracts
allocate cash DEMO rights, voting rights, board rights, and liquidation rights. Last, we consider in
more detail the contingencies involved in allocating those rights. In DEMO analysis, we report results
for the whole sample as well as DEMO the (98) ﬁnancing rounds in which the company utilizes VC
funding for the ﬁrst time.
3.1. Securities
Panel F of Table 1 reports DEMO types of securities used in the 213 ﬁnancing rounds. Consistent
with Sahlman (1990) and Gompers (1998), convertible preferred stock is the most commonly
used security, appearing in 204 of 213 ﬁnancing rounds. The panel also indicates, however,
that VC ﬁnancings (1) do not always use convertible preferred stock; and (2) frequently include
securities in addition to convertible preferred stock. Only 170 of the rounds are ﬁnanced solely
DEMO convertible preferred stock. Seven of the 213 ﬁnancing rounds do not use any form of
convertible security. Instead, they use multiple classes of common stock or a combination of
straight preferred and common stock.
Panel F DEMO reports that the VCs use a variant of convertible preferred called participating
preferred in 82 of the ﬁnancings. Upon the liquidation or exit of DEMO participating convertible
preferred, investors receive both the principal amount of the DEMO they would in an
investment of straight preferred—and the common stock promised under the conversion terms.
As a result, participating convertible preferred is better categorized as a position of straight
preferred stock and common stock than DEMO a position of convertible preferred. In some instances,
the participating preferred does not receive a return of principal if the company return is
DEMO high. This creates a payoff for the VC that looks like straight preferred and common
over some valuation range and then convertible preferred above DEMO range.
While the VC ﬁnancings utilize different types of securities, the DEMO are similar in
that they allow for different allocations of cash ﬂow, voting, board, and liquidation rights. In
the ﬁnancings that use multiple classes of common stock, the VCs receive a different class of
common stock than the founders who receive two or more classes of common DEMO The VC
class of common stock has voting, board, and liquidation rights that are different from those of
the founders’ classes of common DEMO The cash ﬂow rights of the classes of common stock also
differ in that the founders’ stock classes vest under different conditions from those DEMO the VC
class (which vests immediately).
KAPLAN & STROMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 287¨
3.2. Residual cash ﬂow rights
DEMO A of Table 2 presents our results on cash ﬂow rights. By cash ﬂow rights, we mean the
fraction of a portfolio company’s equity value that different investors and management have
a claim to. Measuring cash DEMO rights is not trivial, however, because many of the cash ﬂow
rights accorded to founders and management are contingent either on subsequent performance
(performance vesting) or on remaining with the company (time vesting). DEMO A, therefore,
presents three measures of cash ﬂow rights. The DEMO VC ownership—measures
cash ﬂow rights assuming management meets all performance and time vesting milestones or
contingencies. The second—maximum founders and employee vesting—measures cash ﬂow
DEMO assuming all time vesting stock and options vest. The third—maximum VC ownership—
measures cash ﬂow rights if management does not meet any performance or DEMO vesting
milestones. Under each of the three measures, VC%, founders% and other% are, respectively,
the percentage of cash ﬂow rights owned by the VCs, the founders, and others. Founders include
the founding management DEMO Others include employees and non-VC investors.
The ownership numbers are imperfect because we do not always have complete information
on the vesting terms for DEMO options. When we do not have such information, we assume that
DEMO issued options are vested. Our results, therefore, understate the true extent of state contingent
cash ﬂow rights.
Panel A indicates that the VC DEMO controls roughly 50% of the cash ﬂow rights;
founders, 30%; and others, 20%. This suggests that substantial equity ownership on the part
of founders is desirable. On the other hand, it also indicates that founders give up a large fraction
of ownership.
Panel A also indicates DEMO there are state-contingencies built into the cash ﬂow rights. The
VC stake is a median of 4·2% (average of 8·8%) lower under full DEMO and good performance
compared to the minimum vesting, bad performance state. DEMO are signiﬁcantly
greater in ﬁrst VC rounds compared to subsequent ones, DEMO a median of 8·0% (average 12·6%).
3.3. Board and voting DEMO
The rights to control or make corporate decisions are provided in board rights and in voting
rights. The board is generally responsible for (1) hiring, evaluating, and ﬁring top management;
and (2) advising and ratifying general corporate strategies and decisions. Certain corporate
actions are governed DEMO subject to shareholder votes. These vary across ﬁrms, but sometimes
include DEMO acquisitions, asset sales, subsequent ﬁnancings, election of directors, or any other
actions stipulated by contract.
Board rights and voting rights can be DEMO from cash ﬂow rights and from each other.
The difference is achieved in a number of ways including unvested stock options (which do
not have votes), non-voting stock, contracts specifying a change in equity ownership at the IPO
(i.e. at the point when the VC has pre-committed to giving up most control rights), or explicit
contracting on the DEMO to exercise votes depending on performance targets. Board rights, in
turn, can be separated from voting rights through explicit agreements on the election DEMO directors.
Different securities also can have different rights to elect directors. Panels B and C of Table 1
describe board and voting rights in DEMO sample.
3.3.1. Board rights. We distinguish between three kinds of board members—VCs,
founders, and outsiders. VC seats are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by VCs.
Founder seats are board seats that are DEMO for or controlled by the founders/entrepreneurs.
Outsider seats are board seats that are to be ﬁlled by individuals mutually agreed upon by the
DEMO and the founders/entrepreneurs.

Post-round allocations of rights for 213 DEMO in 119 portfolio companies by 14 venture capital partnerships.
Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. VC allocations are aggregated over all claims from DEMO present in a
particular round. Founders include the founding management team. Others include employees and non-VC investors. In
Panel A, VC%, founders% and DEMO are, respectively, the percentage of residual cash ﬂow rights (i.e. DEMO diluted
equity) owned by the VCs, the founders, and others. DEMO VC ownership if management meets all performance and
vesting milestones or contingencies. Max. founders and employees vesting occurs if non-performance based management
stock and DEMO vest. Maximum VC ownership occurs if management does not meet performance milestones and
stock and options do not vest. In Panel B, normal board is the board at the completion of the ﬁnancing. Adverse
state board DEMO the board that will result if the portfolio company performs poorly or reaches an adverse state. VC
seats are board seats that are reserved DEMO VCs. Founder seats are board seats that are reserved for or controlled by
the founders/entrepreneurs. Outsider seats are board seats that are to DEMO ﬁlled by individuals mutually agreed upon by
the VCs and the founders/entrepreneurs. % seats to cash ﬂow is the fraction of board seats DEMO by the fraction of
residual cash ﬂow rights held by the VCs, founders and others. The % seats to cash ﬂow excludes observations where
cash ﬂow rights are zero. In Panel C, minimum (maximum) VC votes represents the minimum (maximum) votes the VCs
control based on DEMO management performance and vesting milestones or contingencies. % VC, % Founder DEMO
% Neither control are, respectively, the percentage of instances in which voting control is held by the VCs, the founders,
or neither. % Votes to cash ﬂow is the fraction of votes divided by DEMO fraction of residual cash ﬂow rights held by the
VCs, Founders DEMO Others. The % Votes to cash ﬂow excludes observations where cash ﬂow rights are zero. In Panel D
liquidation rights are the proceeds accruing DEMO the party upon a liquidation or bankruptcy. The mean and median dividend
rates are over observations that have cumulative accruing dividends, while mean and median fractions of non-VC senior
or par claims are over all observations. DEMO Panel E, conversion price is the IPO or sale price per DEMO of common stock
at which the venture capital securities automatically convert into common stock. Round price is the price per share
of common stock DEMO which the securities issued in the current round convert or are priced. If a company subsequently
issues equity at a lower price per share DEMO the current round: under a full ratchet provision, the conversion price on the
current round drops to the new issue price; under a weighted-average provision, the conversion price of the current round
declines to a value between the current round and the new issue price. First VC DEMO differ from subsequent rounds at
the 1%∗∗∗ , 5%∗∗ , and 10%∗ levels.
We also distinguish between normal board rights that reﬂect the board DEMO or composition
at the completion of the ﬁnancing from adverse state board rights that reﬂect board rights or
composition if the portfolio company performs DEMO or reaches an adverse state.
Panel B reports that boards have an average of and a median of six members. These boards
are appreciably DEMO than those of public companies. Overall, the VC has the majority DEMO the
290 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
board seats in 25% of the cases, the founders in 14% of the cases, and neither in 61% of the
cases. VC board control is less common for ﬁrst VC rounds.
DEMO board provisions (i.e. the VC gets control of the board in DEMO bad state)
are present in 18% of the cases. This provides an important example of state-contingent control
rights that do not occur simply DEMO case of default on a debt payment. This state-contingency
result and those that follow are important in light of several of the ﬁnancial contracting DEMO
we describe in Section 4.
3.3.2. Voting rights. Panel C of Table 2 reports post-round voting rights. Voting rights
measure the percentage of votes DEMO investors and management have to effect corporate
decisions.
In panel C, DEMO (maximum) VC votes represents the minimum (maximum) votes
the VCs control based on subsequent management performance and stock vesting milestones
or contingencies. DEMO, Founder%, and Neither% control are, respectively, the percentage of
instances in which voting control is held by the VCs, the founders, DEMO neither. Switch in control
indicates the percentage of instances in which voting control can switch based on subsequent
performance.
Panel C indicates that VCs DEMO a voting majority in 53% of all ﬁnancings in the minimum
contingency case and in 41% of ﬁrst VC rounds. In the maximum VC DEMO contingency cases,
VCs control a voting majority in 69% of all ﬁnancings and 61% of ﬁrst VC rounds.
Voting control also is commonly DEMO In 18% of all ﬁnancings and 25% of ﬁrst
VC ﬁnancings, DEMO control switches depending on state-contingencies.
We also measure the degree to which voting and cash ﬂow rights are separated by the
fraction of votes DEMO cash ﬂow. VCs hold a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of votes to cash ﬂow
rights than the founder, while both VCs and founders hold a higher fraction of votes than others,
such as employees.
3.4. Liquidation DEMO ﬂow rights
The residual cash ﬂow rights discussed in the previous section describe how the cash ﬂow rights
of the company are divided in DEMO good state of the world, when the value of the venture DEMO
sufﬁciently high and after senior claims have been paid off. In contrast, when the value of the
venture is low, the cash ﬂow DEMO go to the senior claims, which we call the liquidation cash
DEMO rights. In this subsection and in panel D of Table 2, DEMO describe the liquidation cash ﬂow
rights in VC ﬁnancings.
First, VCs DEMO claims that in liquidation are senior to the common stock claims of the
founders. This is true in all but one of the ﬁnancings. DEMO that ﬁnancing, the VC bought common
stock.
Second, the claims of the VCs in liquidation are typically at least as large as the DEMO
investments. Panel B indicates that this is true in more than 98% of the ﬁnancings.
Even though most of the ﬁnancings give liquidation claims DEMO the VCs, there are some cross-
sectional differences in how strong DEMO are for different deals. One common way of making
the liquidation rights stronger is to make the preferred dividends cumulative (rather than non-
cumulative). Even though these are dividends that do not have to be DEMO out, they accumulate
and are added to the liquidation claim. Cumulative DEMO dividends are present in 43·8% of
our ﬁnancings.
Another common way that VCs strengthen liquidation rights is to use either participating
convertible preferred stock DEMO a combination of common and straight preferred stock. These are
present in 48% of our deals. In both of these cases, the VC receives not only a senior liquidation
KAPLAN & STROMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 291¨
claim up to the face DEMO of the preferred (plus the accumulated dividend, if present) but DEMO
shares whatever value is left after the senior claim has been paid off with the common stock.
3.5. Redemption rights
Optional redemption and put DEMO also are commonly used to strengthen the liquidation
rights of the VC’s investment. After some period of time, these provisions give the VC the right to
demand that the ﬁrm redeem the VC’s claim, typically at liquidation value (or occasionally, at the
maximum of the liquidation value DEMO “fair market value”). This is very similar to the required
repayment of principal at the maturity of a debt claim. Without this provision, the liquidation
right loses much of its bite because there are no DEMO contracted payments for the ﬁrm to default
on. Unlike a debt claim, however, the company cannot force the VC to exercise the redemption
DEMO Panel D indicates that redemption provisions are present in 78·7% of our ﬁnancings with a
typical maturity of 5 years.
3.6. Other terms
VC DEMO include a number of additional terms and conditions. Sahlman (1990), DEMO
(1995), Gompers (1998) and Levin (1998) detail many DEMO these. In this section, we describe
several of the terms and DEMO that we believe are relevant to the ﬁnancial contracting
theories.
3.6.1. Automatic conversion. Securities in VC ﬁnancings often include automatic
conversion provisions in which DEMO security held by the VCs automatically converts into common
stock under certain conditions. These conditions relate almost exclusively to an initial public
offering (IPO) and require a minimum common stock price, dollar amount of proceeds, and/or
market capitalization for the company.9
As Black and Gilson (1998) argue, the effect of these provisions is to require the VCs DEMO give
up their superior control, board, voting, and liquidation rights DEMO the company attains a desired
level of performance. Upon such performance, DEMO VCs retain only those rights associated with
their ownership of common stock. If the company does not deliver that performance, the VCs
retain their superior control rights. This provides the entrepreneur an incentive to perform in
DEMO to the monetary incentive.
Panel E of Table 2 indicates that an automatic conversion provision is present in 95% of the
ﬁnancing rounds. The DEMO rounds that included an automatic conversion provision required
that the company complete an IPO at an IPO stock price a median 3·0 times greater DEMO the
stock price of the ﬁnancing round. The ratio is signiﬁcantly higher in ﬁrst VC rounds.
It is worth emphasizing that at the median DEMO of 3·0, the VCs are not willing to give up
control DEMO they triple their money. Over a 4-year horizon, this works out DEMO a return of 31%
per year.
3.6.2. Anti-dilution protection. VC ﬁnancings also frequently include anti-dilution
protection that protects the VC against future ﬁnancing rounds DEMO a lower valuation than the
valuation of the current (protected) round. In the extreme case, known as full ratchet protection,
the protected security receives a claim to enough additional shares in the subsequent ﬁnancing DEMO
reduce the price of the protected issue to the price of the new issue. In a convertible issue, this is
accomplished by decreasing the conversion price on the protected issue to the conversion price
9. Unlike DEMO (1998), who analysed 50 contracts for one speciﬁc VC ﬁrm, we never observed automatic
conversion contingent on proﬁt or sales benchmarks, and conclude that these are probably quite rare.
292 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
of the new issue. The other common DEMO of anti-dilution protection is the weighted average
ratchet. Under a weighted average ratchet, the reduction in the conversion price (or common
stock price) of the protected issue is a function of the existing shares, the new shares issued and
the conversion price of the new issue.
Panel DEMO indicates that almost 95% of the ﬁnancings include anti-dilution protection.
About 78% of these ﬁnancings utilize the weighted average method rather than the full DEMO
method.
3.6.3. Vesting and non-compete clauses. The inalienability of human capital theories of
Hart and Moore (1994) assume that the entrepreneur cannot contractually DEMO to stay with the
ﬁrm. Even though it is not possible to write enforceable contracts that compel the entrepreneur
to stay with a ﬁrm, there are contractual provisions that make it more costly for the entrepreneur
DEMO leave. In real-world contracts, two methods are commonly used to make DEMO costly for the
entrepreneur to leave the ﬁrm.
First, the entrepreneur’s DEMO can vest over time. This means that the company receives or
can buy back any unvested shares for some low value if the entrepreneur DEMO The earlier the
entrepreneur leaves, the more shares are unvested. Second, the VCs can require the entrepreneur
to sign a non-compete contract that DEMO him from working for another ﬁrm in the same
industry for some period of time if he leaves. Both of these provisions improve the DEMO
power of the VCs if the entrepreneur tries to hold up the VCs.
Panel E shows that the VC ﬁnancings commonly utilize both founder DEMO and non-
compete clauses. Founder vesting is used in almost 41% of ﬁnancing rounds. Such vesting is
more frequent in ﬁrst VC ﬁnancings (48%). Non-compete clauses are used in approximately
70% of the ﬁnancings.
3.7. DEMO
Different theories make different assumptions concerning what it is and is not possible to write
contracts on. For example, some ﬁnancial contracting theories—see Hart and Moore (1998)—
assume that the entrepreneur and outside investors can observe ﬁrm output, but cannot write
contracts on that output because output cannot be veriﬁed in court.
Panel A of Table 3 reports the DEMO and nature of contracts between VCs and entrepreneurs
that are contingent. Contracts may be contingent on subsequent ﬁnancial performance, non-
ﬁnancial performance, actions, dividend payments, future security offerings, or continued
employment. Contingencies may affect DEMO ﬂow rights, voting rights, board rights, sale rights,
liquidation DEMO, redemption rights, or future funding. Panel B reports speciﬁc examples of
these contingencies.
Panel A indicates that almost 73% of the ﬁnancings explicitly DEMO some type of
contingency. In particular, over 17% of ﬁnancings are DEMO on ﬁnancial performance;
almost 9% on non-ﬁnancial performance; and 11% DEMO actions. The panel also shows that in
almost 15% of the ﬁnancings, the VCs provide only a portion of the total funding commitment
at the closing or signing of the ﬁnancing. Additional funding is contingent on DEMO
performance and actions. For example, in two ﬁnancings, the VC provided only 5% of its total
commitment at closing with the rest being DEMO
Panel B reports speciﬁc examples of contingencies. In one ﬁnancing round, DEMO VCs
contractually obtain voting control from the entrepreneur if the ﬁrm’s EBIT—earnings before
interest and taxes—falls below a mutually agreed upon amount. In another DEMO round, VCs
10. About 55% of these contingencies (excluding vesting) DEMO a speciﬁc time horizon, which is typically 12–18
months from the DEMO closing, but in a few cases 5 years or more.

obtain board control if a ﬁrm’s DEMO worth falls below a threshold. These examples indicate that
VCs are able to write (and presumably enforce) contracts in which control rights are DEMO
on subsequent ﬁnancial performance independently of cash ﬂow rights.
Panel B.2 shows that ﬁnancing rounds include contingencies based on subsequent non-
ﬁnancial performance. In DEMO instance, share vesting is contingent on product functionality or
performance. In DEMO others, vesting is contingent on FDA or patent approvals.

Overall, Table DEMO generates two strong results. First, investors (VCs) commonly write
contracts DEMO which control rights are contingent on subsequent measures of ﬁnancial
performance, DEMO performance, and actions. Second, there is a great deal of variation
in the contingencies in these contracts. By looking at the contingencies, we also obtain examples
of managerial actions that the VC is trying to DEMO or avoid. We discuss these issues in more
detail in Kaplan and Stromberg (2002).¨
KAPLAN & STR
OMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 295¨
3.8. Summary
We make DEMO general observations concerning the descriptive results in this section.
First, VC DEMO allow VCs to separately allocate cash ﬂow rights, board rights, voting
rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights.
Second, while VCs use convertible securities most frequently, they also implement the
same allocation of rights using combinations of multiple classes of common stock and straight
preferred stock. DEMO, VCs make frequent use of participating convertible preferred
which is the DEMO of a position of preferred stock and common stock rather than a position
of convertible preferred.
Third, rights are allocated such that if the company performs poorly, the VCs obtain full
control. As company performance improves, the entrepreneur retains/obtains more cash ﬂow
rights and control rights. If the company performs very well, the VCs relinquish most of their
control and liquidation rights.
Fourth, it is common for VCs to include non-compete and vesting provisions aimed at
mitigating the potential hold-up problem between the DEMO and the investor. The vesting
provisions are more common in early stage ﬁnancings where it is more likely that the hold-up
problem is more DEMO
Finally, cash ﬂow rights, control rights, voting rights, and future ﬁnancings are frequently
contingent on observable measures of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance. DEMO state
contingent rights are more common in ﬁrst VC and early stage ﬁnancings.
4. RELATION TO FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORIES
In this section, we interpret our results relative to ﬁnancial contracting theories. We focus on
three general DEMO of theories: (1) classical principal–agent; (2) control theories; DEMO (3) debt
theories. We consider the extent to which the contract provisions we have examined are consistent
with the assumptions and predictions of DEMO theories. We augment this discussion and analysis
with cross-sectional regressions when appropriate. We conclude this section by discussing the
results for the general classes DEMO theories in relation to more recent VC speciﬁc theories.
4.1. Allocation of cash ﬂow rights and pay performance incentives
4.1.1. Theoretical predictions. The ﬁrst DEMO of theories deals with the allocation of
cash ﬂow rights between the VC and entrepreneur. The classical principal–agency approach,
pioneered by Holmstrom (1979), assumes that the agent’s effort is unobservable to the principal.¨
Signals, such as ﬁrm output or proﬁts, however, are correlated with effort DEMO can be contracted
on. The optimal incentive contract ensures that the agent puts in enough effort by making the
agent’s compensation dependent on the DEMO of the signals. In the basic model, and in the
absence DEMO risk aversion, the investor maximizes the sensitivity of the agent’s compensation DEMO
the signal. Moreover, it is in the investor’s interest to make DEMO entrepreneur’s compensation
contingent on as many veriﬁable signals correlated with effort as possible (the “Informativeness
Principle” of Holmstrom (1979); see also Harris DEMO Raviv (1979), Innes (1990)).¨
The result that the DEMO pay performance sensitivity should be maximized may
not hold if the entrepreneur is risk averse or if multi-tasking problems exist. Compensation
contingent on performance DEMO costly because a risk-averse entrepreneur requires a higher
level of compensation to offset the extra risk. Prendergast (1999) mentions several potentially
testable predictions: (1) entrepreneurs who are more risk averse will have less pay DEMO
sensitivity. (2) Noisier performance signals impose more risk on the entrepreneur, making
296 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
pay performance sensitive compensation more expensive. Less DEMO performance measures
should be given relatively higher weight in compensation. (3) The higher the positive effect
on performance for a given effort by DEMO entrepreneur, the higher the pay performance
sensitivity should be. (4) DEMO entrepreneurs differ in ability, performance sensitive contracts
will be relatively more DEMO to better entrepreneurs (holding risk aversion constant). This
gives rise DEMO selection effects (see Lazear, 1986). Investors can screen out entrepreneurs by
offering high-powered compensation contracts because only high-ability entrepreneurs will
accept such DEMO Hence, the higher the asymmetric information regarding the ability of
the DEMO, the higher the pay performance sensitivity in the contracts offered by DEMO
investor.
Multi-tasking models (Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991), Baker (1992)) assume that there¨
are several activities for which the entrepreneur needs to exert effort. This leads to a problem
of potential “gaming”, where the entrepreneur will only exert effort in the activity whose
signal is most DEMO in the compensation contract. As a result, overall incentives have to
DEMO muted in the optimal compensation contract, and the principal will tend DEMO rely more on
subjective performance evaluation. This suggests that compensation should be less dependent on
performance and more dependent on subjective performance measures in DEMO with gaming
potential.
4.1.2. Empirical results. The descriptive analysis of cash ﬂow rights in Table 2 seems
largely consistent with both the assumptions and DEMO of the classical principal–agent
approach. In our ﬁnancings, the entrepreneur gets DEMO large fraction of equity in the ﬁrm and
the entrepreneur’s equity stake increases with performance. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the
contracts often condition the entrepreneur’s equity compensation on a multitude of ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial signals, consistent with the “Informativeness Principle”.
To test the models, we would ideally plot the entrepreneur’s compensation as a function
of the venture’s value, and examine what independent variables determine the shape of this
function. The pay DEMO sensitivity of the founder’s compensation is increasing both in
the function’s slope—the fraction of the value promised to the entrepreneur at a given value—
DEMO its convexity—the increase in the fraction of the value given to the entrepreneur as value
increases.
Because it is hard to capture these aspects DEMO one single measure and no measure is perfect,
we examine several. First, we look at the percentage of the residual cash ﬂow rights allocated
to the founder (FRCFs). This captures the compensation function slope given that the venture is
worth more than the liquidation claims. This DEMO, unfortunately, is not ideal, because it is
also potentially a DEMO of the (unobservable) quality of the entrepreneur.
Second, we look DEMO the change in the fraction of FRCFs as a function of vesting. As this
fraction becomes more state-contingent, the compensation function becomes more convex and
the pay performance sensitivity increases. We separate contingencies into the sensitivity DEMO to
performance vesting—ﬁnancial or non-ﬁnancial—and the sensitivity due to time vesting of the
founders’ shares. This is a relevant separation in theory as time DEMO can be interpreted as
a form of subjective performance evaluation. With time vesting, the founder’s compensation is
contingent on the board’s decision to retain the founder, rather than on explicit benchmarks. This
might be expected to be more likely when multi-tasking is present.11 We measure the change
in DEMO both on an absolute scale and relative to the level of the FRCF. We think the relative
11. This also is a prediction from DEMO control theory of Hart and Moore (1994) that we describe in the following
section. Vesting makes it more costly for the founder to DEMO the company which mitigates a potential hold-up problem.
KAPLAN & STROMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 297¨
change in FRCF is more DEMO of incentives because it measures the fraction of the founders’
equity that is at risk, therefore, controlling for unobservable quality.
Third, we look at the degree to which the founder has claims to the liquidation DEMO
Giving the founder part of the liquidation cash ﬂow rights lowers the convexity of the
compensation function and leads to lower pay performance sensitivity.
DEMO key independent variables in our analyses are pre-revenue, repeat entrepreneur, and
months since the ﬁrst VC round. Pre-revenue equals one if the company DEMO no revenues at
the time of ﬁnancing, and zero otherwise. It DEMO likely that uncertainty and asymmetric
information are greater for pre-revenue ﬁrms. It also is arguable that incentive problems are
more severe for early stage DEMO since the entrepreneur’s effort is relatively more important.
As Myers (2000) assumes, this likely would be the case of the development of a new technology
or concept. Once the technology or concept has been created DEMO validated, the founders are more
replaceable with outsiders.
Repeat entrepreneur takes DEMO value of one if the founders previously founded a company
that was either taken public or acquired by a public company, and zero otherwise. This provides
a measure of the extent to which VC may have DEMO information on the quality of the founders.
Such information reduces the likelihood of adverse selection and the uncertainty of the venture.12
If this is DEMO, we would expect repeat entrepreneurs to have lower powered incentives. On
DEMO other hand, repeat entrepreneur also is likely to be correlated with DEMO outside wealth and
lower risk aversion. If repeat entrepreneur measures differences in risk aversion, we would expect
repeat entrepreneurs to have higher powered incentives.
Months since the ﬁrst VC ﬁnancing round is another measure of asymmetric DEMO
VC uncertainty about management quality and asymmetric information should be highest in the
ﬁrst VC ﬁnancing round and should decrease thereafter.
Table 4 presents DEMO results of our cross-sectional regression analyses. The regressions
include controls for industry volatility, industry research and development (R&D), industry
size, company location, and VC.13 We also control for the amount of funds invested by
the VC by including in the accumulated VC investment as a DEMO variable.14 Finally, we
attempt to include a control for performance. Although DEMO have incomplete data on accounting
performance, we have more complete data DEMO ﬁnancing terms. Accordingly, we measure
performance based on the annual return DEMO the securities since the initial investment. When
the company performs poorly, DEMO VCs will pay less for the securities acquired in the round.
A problem with using this return as an independent variable is that the DEMO price is endogenous
and related to the percentage of equity allocated to the VC in the round. To address this, we
include dummies for whether the return is in the upper or lower quartile rather than DEMO the
return directly.
The ﬁrst regression in Table 4 examines the determinants of the fraction of equity (cash ﬂow
rights) allocated to the DEMO The only signiﬁcant result is that as the VC–entrepreneur
relationship progresses, DEMO founder’s equity stake declines. This is consistent with classical
principal–agent theory—lower powered incentives are required as asymmetric information
declines. This also may be a DEMO of the need to provide newly hired managers with equity
incentives as the company grows.
The second and third regressions of Table 4 analyse DEMO determinants of absolute and
relative sensitivity to explicit performance benchmarks. Explicit performance-based equity
compensation is used more in pre-revenue ventures, less for repeat entrepreneurs, and earlier in
12. We use the company business plan, the DEMO analysis, and company web sites to obtain this information.
13. The DEMO provides a more detailed description of the control variables in the regressions.
14. Because this is potentially endogenous, we instrument this variable with median industry capital expenditures
and yearly time ﬁxed effects using two-stage least squares.

VC–founder relationships. All three of DEMO results are consistent with asymmetric information
and moral hazard models where pay performance sensitivity increases when uncertainty about
venture quality is higher. The negative DEMO on repeat entrepreneur suggests that repeat
entrepreneur picks up information effects rather than risk aversion effects. Also, the negative
coefﬁcient on the return variable indicates that the use of explicit performance benchmarks
increases with poor performance.
DEMO results imply economically meaningful effects. The relative (absolute) sensitivity to
explicit performance benchmarks is 4·7% (1·6%) greater in pre-revenue companies and 2·2%
(0·7%) lower when repeat entrepreneurs are present. These compare to mean values for relative
and absolute sensitivities of 3The fourth and ﬁfth regressions analyse DEMO determinants of absolute and relative pay·5 and 1·1%, respectively.
performance sensitivity DEMO to time vesting. Time vesting is signiﬁcantly higher for pre-revenue
ventures and, in the relative regressions, for early VC–founder relationships. The relative and
DEMO sensitivities to time vesting for pre-revenue companies are large at 23·6 and 8·5%,
respectively. Again, this is supportive of asymmetric information and moral hazard models.
Interestingly, the signs on the industry ratios are opposite the ones in the performance
benchmark regressions. The contracts in high volatility, high R&D, and smaller, presumably
less established industries seem to use DEMO vesting rather than explicit performance benchmarks
to induce pay performance sensitivity. One interpretation, consistent with theory, is that these
are environments where explicit DEMO signals are noisier measures of true performance.
Because of this, explicit DEMO benchmarking will be more costly, both because of
managerial risk aversion DEMO well as multi-tasking or gaming problems.
Finally, in the sixth regression, we use a logit speciﬁcation to analyse the determinants of
founder liquidation DEMO While pre-revenue is not signiﬁcant, both repeat entrepreneur and
months since DEMO VC round are positive and signiﬁcant. Hence, when the founder has DEMO
successful in the past, and as the VC learns more about DEMO ﬁrm over time, the founder has
more liquidation rights. Again, this is consistent with less pay-for-performance as asymmetric
information declines. Again, this result is not consistent with repeat entrepreneur as a measure
of (less) DEMO aversion.
The results in Table 4 control for VC and location ﬁxed effects. The use of performance
benchmarks varies signiﬁcantly among VCs. Also, explicit performance benchmarks are used
signiﬁcantly less in California ventures. Hence, contract design may be affected by different
contracting “styles” for different VCs and markets.
DEMO sum up, the regressions in Table 4 are largely supportive of DEMO principal–agent
theories and their screening implications. As uncertainty about the quality of the venture and
the founder increases, the VC increases the pay performance sensitivity by making the founder’s
cash ﬂow compensation increasingly convex in performance DEMO more explicit performance
compensation, more time vesting, and fewer liquidation cash ﬂow rights. Also, as explicit
performance signals become noisier measures of true performance, the contracts substitute
explicit performance benchmarks with more vesting and lower liquidation cash ﬂow rights.
4.2. Control theories: cash ﬂow veriﬁable but not actions
4.2.1. Theoretical predictions. Board rights and voting rights give the controlling DEMO
the right to decide on any action that is not pre-speciﬁed in the original contract. Such rights
are valuable in an incomplete contracting world, when it is not feasible or credible to specify

their investments. The results are qualitatively similar when we exclude DEMO VC dummies and include all observations.

all possible actions and contingencies in an DEMO ante contract. Incomplete contracting and
control rights were introduced by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990).16
These theories change the traditional principal–agent model assumptions by assuming that
actions are observable, but not veriﬁable. Output and monetary beneﬁts may or may not be
contractible. DEMO a result, control rights that determine who chooses which action to DEMO will
be important.
Two important papers that take this approach are Aghion and Bolton (1992) and
Dewatripont and Tirole (1994). In Aghion and Bolton (1992), the project yields both monetary
beneﬁts that are veriﬁable and transferable to outside investors, and private beneﬁts or actions
that are non-veriﬁable and go only to the entrepreneur. The magnitude of these DEMO, in turn,
depends on what (non-veriﬁable) action is taken DEMO respect to the project. This introduces
a conﬂict of interest. Aghion and Bolton (1992) show that as the external ﬁnancing capacity
of the DEMO increases (i.e. the higher the proﬁtability of the project and the DEMO the
conﬂicts of interest), control moves from more investor control to more entrepreneur control.
In particular, for projects with high external ﬁnancing capacity, the entrepreneur should always
have control. As external ﬁnancing capacity decreases, DEMO should be state-contingent control
similar to a debt contract that transfers control to investors only in bad states of the world.
Finally, for projects with low external ﬁnancing capacity, the investor should always be allocated
control.
Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) build on Aghion and Bolton (1992) DEMO focusing on the
optimal correlation between control rights and cash ﬂow rights. In their model, the entrepreneur
always prefers to take the riskier action (e.g. continuing the project), even though it will be ex post
optimal to take the less risky action (e.g. liquidate the project) DEMO the project is doing badly.
They show that when performance is poor, the party in control should have a cash ﬂow claim
that is concave in performance (such as debt), while when performance improves more control
should be transferred to a holder of a convex cash ﬂow DEMO (such as equity).
4.2.2. Empirical results. The extensive use of DEMO rights in our sample is broadly
consistent with the assumptions and predictions of these theories. State-contingent board and
voting control rights also are common DEMO in our contracts. This contracting is more
elaborate than that in ordinary debt contracts that only give liquidation rights in case of default on
DEMO promised payment. As Table 3 shows, control can be made contingent DEMO ﬁnancial performance
or on non-ﬁnancial events independently of the division of cash ﬂow rights. These results are
broadly consistent with Aghion and Bolton (1992). We now examine the predictions of these
theories in more detail DEMO analysing the cross-section.
The control theories predict that as agency problems and ﬁnancial constraints become more
severe, the contracts should change from entrepreneur control to state-contingent control to full
VC control. We interpret the situation where DEMO the VC nor the founder is in control as
similar to state-contingent control. For example, in boards where outside, jointly appointed,
board DEMO are pivotal, it seems plausible that these members will vote with DEMO VC as
founder performance declines. On the other hand, we assume DEMO when the VC explicitly gets
control in the bad state, through DEMO default board provision or state-contingent voting control, the
VC has relatively DEMO control compared to cases where the outsiders are pivotal. Therefore,
for a given ﬁnancing round, we let the board/voting control variables equal zero if the founder
always controls a majority of the seats/votes, one if neither the VC nor the founder has a majority

three if the VC controls a DEMO of the seats/votes in the good and bad states.17
The ﬁrst two regressions presented in Table 5 use ordered logits to analyse board DEMO
and voting rights, respectively. VCs are more likely to have board DEMO voting control in pre-
revenue ventures, as the time since the DEMO ﬁnancing round increases, and in industries with
higher volatility and more DEMO assets. VCs are more likely to have board control when returns
are high and less likely to have voting control with repeat entrepreneurs.
The DEMO are economically as well as statistically signiﬁcant. For example, VC voting
DEMO (group 3) is almost 30% more likely in pre-revenue companies while the other three states

are each roughly 10% less likely. VC DEMO control is 20% less likely in companies with a repeat
entrepreneur while neither control in the bad state (group one) is 10% more DEMO
These results indicate that when the uncertainty about the venture and the quality of the
founder is higher, the VC is allocated more control. In contrast, VC control increases as the VC–
entrepreneur relationship progresses. Although the uncertainty about the venture should decrease
over time, the VC also invests more funds. The founder’s stake declines over time as the VC
DEMO more control and cash ﬂow rights in exchange for the additional funds invested.18 This
is consistent with Aghion and Bolton (1992) who predict DEMO the investor should be allocated
more control as the ﬁnancing constraint becomes more binding.
Of the other industry characteristics, the amount of ﬁxed to total assets is signiﬁcantly
positively related to VC voting control.19 One explanation DEMO this is that such companies are
less reliant on the intangible human capital of the original founder, making intervention by the
VC more efﬁcient.
The last regression uses the price at which the VC’s securities are DEMO converted
into common equity as a measure of VC control. The lower this price is, the more states in which
the VC has pre-committed to give up its control and liquidation rights. As a dependent variable,DEMO
we normalize the automatic conversion price by dividing by the round price and then taking logs.
The automatic conversion price is higher for pre-revenue DEMO and lower for repeat
entrepreneurs. Again, this is supportive of the DEMO that as uncertainty about the quality
of venture increases, the VC DEMO more control. Among the other industry controls, the
automatic conversion price DEMO lower for ventures in larger, more established industries. Finally,
as DEMO might expect almost by construction, the relative automatic conversion price decreases DEMO
the round price increases (as measured by return). As with DEMO ﬂow rights, the degree of board
and voting control varies signiﬁcantly DEMO different VCs. Also, the degree of board control is
higher in DEMO companies based in the North-east U.S.
Together, the results imply that DEMO ventures with greater initial uncertainty about viability,
the VC receives more board and voting control, and demands stronger performance (through the
automatic DEMO price) before ceding control. This is broadly consistent with Aghion and
DEMO (1992). When uncertainty is high, conﬂicts are more likely to arise between the VC and
the founder regarding issues whether the manager DEMO be replaced or the business should be
continued. Hence, the VCs DEMO to be allocated control in more states in order for their investment
to be ex ante proﬁtable.
4.3. Debt theories and the allocation of DEMO rights
4.3.1. Theoretical predictions. Many ﬁnancial contracting theories predict that the
investor should hold a debt-like claim. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, the security design theories
based on classical principal–agent theory (such as Innes, 1990) show that giving investors a
senior claim is useful for incentive purposes DEMO it makes the manager’s residual claim more
sensitive to performance. Similarly, DEMO theories such as Myers and Majluf (1984) and
Dufﬁe and Demarzo (1999), show that in an asymmetric information setting, the manager DEMO
18. When we include the log accumulated VC ﬁnancing in the ordered logit regression, it is strongly positive and
signiﬁcant. The months since ﬁrst VC round variable is still signiﬁcant. The amount of ﬁnancing is endogenous, and
cannot be instrumented in an ordered logit framework, hence, we DEMO not include this speciﬁcation in the table. We have
also run 2SLS regressions on the difference between the fraction of VC and founder votes DEMO board seats, instrumenting
log VC investment with year dummies. Log VC DEMO is positive and all other results are similar.
19. When we replace ﬁxed to total assets with R&D to sales, the coefﬁcient is negative. Because the two variables
are highly negatively correlated, we do not include both simultaneously in the regressions. The result does not change
when DEMO include cumulative VC investment. We do not include it in the reported regression because it is endogenous to
VC control and cannot be instrumented DEMO the ordered logit framework.
KAPLAN & STROMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 303¨
signal that success is more DEMO by offering the investor a senior claim that receives all of the
value in case of failure. According to these models, VC liquidation rights should be stronger
when there is greater uncertainty about venture quality and DEMO ability.
Apart from seniority, however, the other important characteristic of debt is the ability to take
control and liquidate the ﬁrm when performance DEMO bad. This can be interpreted as another way
of allocating the investor state-contingent control. One criticism, however, of this explanation
for debt—see Hart (1995)—is that changes in control in Aghion and Bolton (1992) DEMO not
necessarily coincide with default on a contracted payment, which is DEMO central feature of real-
world debt contracts. This feature of debt can be derived in a model where not only actions, but
also proﬁts and cash ﬂows are non-observable or non-veriﬁable. In this world, there is no way to
stop the entrepreneur from stealing the ﬁrm’s proﬁts.
There DEMO two main strands to this literature, which we denote “stealing models”. DEMO
state veriﬁcation (CSV) models—e.g. Townsend (1979) and Gale and Hellwig (1985)—assume
that proﬁts are completely unobservable, unless a veriﬁcation cost DEMO paid. The other strand—e.g.
Bolton and Scharfstein (1990), Fluck (1998) and Hart and Moore (1998)—assumes that proﬁts
are observable but DEMO veriﬁable to outsiders and courts. The optimal ﬁnancial claim in both
approaches is a debt-like claim in which (1) the entrepreneur promises a DEMO payment to the
investor; and (2) the investor takes control DEMO the project and liquidates the assets if the payment
is not made. Hence, these theories are consistent both with the seniority and the default aspects
of debt contracts. Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) also show that DEMO future funding can
play a role similar to demanding repayment in forcing liquidation.
In these models, the value investors can realize when they seize assets limits the liquidation
claim that can be promised to outside investors. DEMO, liquidation claims should be greater
when assets are more tangible and DEMO the founder’s human capital is less crucial. Because the
liquidation threat always exists in the stealing models, there are no cross-sectional predictions
regarding the investor’s ability to force liquidation in the bad state. Given that the DEMO rely
on the assumption of non-veriﬁability of cash ﬂow, however, one possible prediction would be
where cash ﬂow is harder to verify, the ability to liquidate should be more important and we
should observe stronger DEMO liquidation rights.
4.3.2. Empirical approach. In Section 3, we showed that DEMO allocation of liquidation
rights is an important feature of the venture contracts. First, in all of our observations but one,
the VC is senior to common equity in liquidation. The seniority of the VC claim DEMO consistent
with classical moral hazard theories, signalling and screening theories, as well as the “stealing”
theories. Second, consistent with the “stealing theories”, DEMO VCs do have some power to
liquidate upon default on a contracted payment.
We note, however, that “stealing” theories do not explain a DEMO of our results including
the allocation of residual cash ﬂow rights and the frequent contingent contracting on ﬁnancial
performance measures. Such features are ruled DEMO by assumption because cash ﬂow is not
veriﬁable.20 , 21
In Table 6 we analyse the cross-sectional determinants of VC liquidation rights in more

Fluck (1998) and Myers (2000), the liquidation right is replaced by the right to ﬁre management. DEMO occurs if dividends
are too low. Here it is essential, that DEMO equity investors have this right, which in turn implies that they DEMO to control
a majority of the board/votes. Moreover, in these DEMO, the ﬁrm has to pay out dividends. Both of these assumptions

claim. We use a dummy variable that DEMO one if the liquidation claim exceeds the VC’s
cumulative investment (through DEMO dividends, participating preferred, etc.) and zero
otherwise.22 Because the VC’s DEMO claim varies little between rounds, we report results
using the ﬁrst DEMO round for each ﬁrm. The results with the full sample are almost identical.
Overall, the results are weak. There is no evidence that the VC’s liquidation claim is larger
when asymmetric information problems are more severe, because volatility, pre-revenue, and
repeat entrepreneur are not signiﬁcant. Collateral value, measured as ﬁxed to total assets, is not
signiﬁcant either. Only the debt capacity of the venture, measured as the industry median long-
term debt ratio, is related to the VC liquidation claim.
The remaining regressions of Table 6 analyse the VC’s ability to liquidate. We ﬁrst analyse
DEMO redemption rights are present in the VC contracts. Again the results are weak. In the
second regression, redemption rights are unrelated to the pre-revenue and the repeat entrepreneur
variables.
Even though redemption rights are the part DEMO the VC contracts that most resemble debt,
there are other ways that a VC can force a liquidation of badly performing ﬁrms. The DEMO
important mechanism is through staging of the investment.23 We distinguish between two
different forms of staging: ex ante (or within-round) and ex post (or between-round) staging.
In an ex ante staged deal, part of the VC’s committed funding is contingent on ﬁnancial
or non-ﬁnancial performance milestones. DEMO essentially gives the VC the right to liquidate the
venture in the bad state of the world. Even many VC ﬁnancings are not explicitly DEMO ex ante,
most of them are implicitly staged ex post, DEMO the sense that even when all the funding in the
round is released immediately, future ﬁnancing will be needed to support the ﬁrm until the IPO.
By providing less funding in a given round, and hence shortening the time until the next ﬁnancing
round, the VC increases the ability to liquidate the venture if performance is unsatisfactory.24
Ex ante staging DEMO a given round, however, arguably makes this liquidation right stronger
and more explicitly related to performance.
The fourth and ﬁfth regressions in Table DEMO analyse between-round staging by explaining the
time until the next ﬁnancing round. The repeat entrepreneur dummy is positively related to the
time between rounds, indicating that previously successful founders receive more funding in a
given round, reducing the VC’s liquidation threat. In contrast with Gompers (1995), most of our
industry variables are insigniﬁcant.25 The exception is the industry long-term DEMO ratio, which
is negative and signiﬁcant. Hence, the use of between-round staging seems to be complementary
with the use of debt in the DEMO
The three ﬁnal regressions address ex ante staging by analysing the fraction of funds
committed in a given round that are provided up front. DEMO entrepreneurs receive more of
their funding up front, although the variable DEMO not signiﬁcant when VC dummies are included.
Again, the use of DEMO ante staging is positively related to industry debt. In addition, when DEMO
round return is higher, more funds are provided up front and DEMO less contingent on performance.
The coefﬁcient on the time since the ﬁrst VC round is negative, showing that ex ante staging is
more common in earlier rounds.
To sum up, our results on liquidation rights and claims are mixed. The results on redemption
rights and staging, although somewhat weak, at least suggest that the VCs increase their ability
to liquidate when dealing with less proven entrepreneurs. There does not seem to be DEMO strong
22. Separate regressions on cumulative dividends and participating preferred stock generate similar results.
23. See Bolton and Scharfstein (1990). Neher (1999) provides a model of staging based on Hart and Moore (1998).
24. Gompers (1995) analyses ex post staging, using VE data. Time between ﬁnancing rounds decreases with
industry R&D intensity and market-to-book ratios; it increases with industry tangible asset ratios.
25. None of the measures DEMO (1995) uses—the ﬁxed asset ratio, R&D to sales, or market-to-book ratio—are
signiﬁcant in our regressions. Part of this could be an DEMO of power, however, since Gompers has a larger sample.

relation between liquidation rights and the tangibility DEMO assets or with the degree to which cash
ﬂows are uncertain and hard to verify. However, the strength of VC liquidation rights and claims
increases with industry debt. To the extent that industry debt is a DEMO measure of collateral than
tangible assets, this result is consistent with DEMO stealing theories.
4.4. Venture-capital speciﬁc theories
While the theories analysed above are general ﬁnancial contracting models, a number of recent
theoretical papers focus speciﬁcally on venture capital contracts. Most of these papers try to
explain the DEMO of convertible securities in venture capital ﬁnancings (based on the results DEMO
Sahlman, 1990).
The ﬁrst group of theories is motivated by DEMO evidence that, apart from the
mere provision of funds, VCs exert substantial effort in monitoring and aiding their portfolio
companies.26 Motivated by this DEMO, these theories, including Repullo and Suarez (1999),
Schmidt (DEMO), Casamatta (2000), Renucci (2000), Dessi (2001) and Inderst and Muller (2001),¨
model the VC–entrepreneur relationship as a DEMO moral-hazard problem, where both the
entrepreneur and the VC have to DEMO given incentives to provide costly effort.
Consistent with our empirical evidence, DEMO models predict that both the entrepreneur and
the VC should be allocated residual cash ﬂow rights.
These theories have more mixed success in explaining DEMO liquidation cash ﬂow rights
that come with the convertible preferred securities. In Repullo and Suarez (1999) the optimal
contract calls for giving the DEMO VC investors a warrant-like claim. This avoids inefﬁcient
liquidations for projects that turn out to be marginally proﬁtable after the ﬁrst round of ﬁnancing.
DEMO intuition is inconsistent with our ﬁndings because the liquidation rights that come with a
convertible or participating preferred in practice would worsen the inefﬁcient DEMO problem
in their model.
In the models of Casamatta (2000), DEMO (2000), Dessi (2001) and Inderst and Muller¨
(2001), VC liquidation rights emerge as part of the optimal contract, but only for parts of the
parameter space. For example, in Casamatta (2000), only as the external ﬁnancing constraint
becomes more binding does the VC’s claim resemble a convertible and the entrepreneur’s
resemble common stock. For low DEMO of external ﬁnancing need, the entrepreneur gets a
convertible and the DEMO common stock.27 Given that (1) VCs are allocated liquidation cash ﬂow
rights in our sample (212 out of 213 ﬁnancings), and (DEMO) that liquidation claims do not vary
much with our proxies for DEMO severity of the agency problem (see Table 6), the cross-sectional
DEMO do not seem consistent with the data.28
Schmidt’s (1999) theory relies heavily on the VC contract being a standard convertible
security, rather than participating preferred or a combination of straight preferred and common.
Given the DEMO use of participating preferred in particular (39% of our sample), DEMO is a
serious shortcoming of Schmidt’s model.
A second theoretical approach, DEMO by Cornelli and Yosha (1998), motivates
convertible securities as a DEMO of stopping the entrepreneur from manipulating interim
26. See Kaplan and Stromberg (2001, 2002) and Hellman and Puri (2002).¨
27. Similarly, in Inderst and Muller (2001) VCs only get convertibles when there DEMO low competition among VC¨
funds, and in Dessi (2001) convertibles DEMO only optimal under very speciﬁc assumptions regarding collusion between
the VC and entrepreneur against uninformed third-party investors.
28. Still, there are two observations that give some support to Casamatta’s (2000) model. First, as we show in
Table 8, below, the strength of the VC’s liquidation claim DEMO in later ﬁnancing rounds, i.e. as the VC invests
additional funds. DEMO, empirical evidence on angel ﬁnancings (see e.g. Wong, 2001) shows that angel investments are
smaller in magnitude and more likely to involve DEMO stock.
KAPLAN & STROMBERG FINANCIAL CONTRACTING THEORY 307¨
performance.29 In their model, entrepreneurs have the incentive to manipulate interim
performance signals upward to secure additional DEMO of VC ﬁnancing. A properly designed
convertible contract avoids this problem by making conversion undesirable for the entrepreneur
(i.e. by setting a low conversion price). Because a high performance signal increases the
probability of a DEMO conversion that dilutes the entrepreneur’s equity stake, the entrepreneur will
refrain DEMO such manipulation. Although the use of convertibles is consistent with our evidence,
the model relies on the convertible contract maturing before the true DEMO of the venture is
revealed. Because the real-world convertibles we observe have inﬁnite maturity (in the sense that
they cannot be called by the company), and typically only convert at a successful IPO or sale, this
explanation does not seem consistent with our data. Moreover, our observation that VC residual
cash ﬂow rights decrease with interim performance signals goes DEMO the model’s predictions.
A third theoretical approach, represented by Berglof (1994) and Hellman (2001), derives¨
convertibles as a way to avoid DEMO venture exit decisions. In Berglof’s model, convertibles¨
enable VCs and entrepreneurs DEMO capture a maximum amount of rents when selling the venture
to third-party buyers. The convertibles give control rights to the entrepreneur in the good DEMO
which enables him to get fully compensated for his private beneﬁts, DEMO control to the VC in the
bad state which compensates the VC from being expropriated by the new majority owners after
the sale. Although DEMO prediction of the allocation of control rights is consistent with our¨
evidence, the allocation of cash ﬂow rights is not. His model predicts that all cash ﬂow rights are
allocated to the VC, and hence does not capture the fact that cash ﬂow rights are also allocated
based DEMO ﬁrm performance. Moreover, the expropriation assumption is questionable in that it
DEMO on the VC staying as a minority shareholder after a trade sale.
Building on Aghion and Bolton (1992), Hellman (2001) argues that convertibles solve a
conﬂict between the VC and the entrepreneur regarding exit DEMO The conﬂict arises because
a minimum amount of equity has to be given up to the entrepreneur in the case of an IPO, while
no such restriction exists in a trade sale, making VCs prefer trade sales ceteris paribus. The
optimal contract calls for leaving control with the DEMO as long as the VC breaks even, and
allocating cash ﬂow DEMO to the VC, subject to leaving the minimum stake to the DEMO in
the case of an IPO. The model is successful in explaining a number of features of VC contracts,
such as participating preferred (which will be optimal when the ﬁnancing constraint is tight),
automatic conversion at an IPO (which is necessary to guarantee the entrepreneur’s minimum
IPO share), and transfer of control from the entrepreneur to the DEMO as the ﬁnancing constraint
tightens (as in Aghion and Bolton). DEMO, if we assume that the ﬁnancing constraint tightens
in later ﬁnancing DEMO (as more funds are invested), the ﬁnding in Table 2 DEMO both the use
of participating preferred and VC control increase in later rounds is consistent with Hellman’s
predictions. One shortcoming, however, similar to DEMO of the double moral-hazard models, is that
VCs are predicted to DEMO only common stock for parts of the parameter space. Still, Hellman
(2001) shows that by augmenting Aghion and Bolton with a role for cash ﬂow incentives (which
Hellman models in reduced form by the minimum entrepreneur IPO stake), a number of features
of the VC contracts DEMO be explained simultaneously.
5. COMPLEXITY OF REAL-WORLD CONTRACTS: COMPLEMENTARITY AND
DYNAMICS
DEMO the previous section, we examined venture capital contracts in the light DEMO standard
ﬁnancial contracting theories. It appears that real-world contracts are more complex than
29. The intuition of their model is somewhat similar to the DEMO motivation for convertibles of Brennan
and Schwartz (1982) and Green (DEMO).
308 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
the theories predict. First, control rights, DEMO ﬂow incentives and liquidation rights are all
used simultaneously. Moreover, control DEMO are multi-dimensional, with several different
types of control being allocated between DEMO and entrepreneurs, and switching gradually
with performance. Second, the contractual relationship between the VCs and the entrepreneurs
evolves; each new round involves a new set of contract terms with previous contracts potentially
being renegotiated. In DEMO section, we describe these features in more detail in order to DEMO
stylized facts for future theoretical work.
5.1. Complementarity and substitutability of contract provisions
We use cluster analysis to divide the contracts into ﬁve generic DEMO to analyse the
simultaneous use of different governance mechanisms—pay performance compensation, DEMO
and voting control, and liquidation rights. The hierarchical cluster method30 we DEMO forms
groups that maximize the Euclidian distance between matrices of dummy variables measuring
12 main contractual characteristics for the companies in each group. Although DEMO analysis
is a somewhat subjective methodology because it depends on the number of groups and input
variables used, the results using different speciﬁcations are qualitatively similar. We restrict the
sample to ﬁrst VC ﬁnancing rounds when DEMO (89 cases) or, otherwise, from second round
investments when available (seven cases) in order to purge the comparison from effects due DEMO
the subsequent evolution of the contracts.
Table 7 reports the results. The order of the ﬁve clusters increases in the degree of residual
cash DEMO rights given up by the founder. The ordering also corresponds roughly to the degree
of board and voting control allocated to the VC, with cluster 1 (5) being the ﬁrms with the most
(least) DEMO control. The ﬁrst three clusters exhibit the highest degree of VC control and also
contain a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of pre-revenue ﬁrms. Hence, the ﬁrst three clusters are
presumably associated with a higher degree of uncertainty DEMO the viability of the venture.
We make a number of observations regarding the interplay among the different rights. First,
voting and board control DEMO positively correlated. When VCs control the board (cluster 1), they
DEMO also have a voting majority; when founders control the board (cluster 5), the founder
group tends to control a voting majority. Not DEMO, these two control mechanisms are more
complements than substitutes. Also, cash ﬂow rights and control rights largely go together. The
fraction of equity DEMO by the founder is signiﬁcantly higher for cluster 5 compared to cluster 1.
Second, although voting, board and residual cash ﬂow rights are DEMO, the correlation
is far from perfect. Cluster 2 ﬁrms have VC DEMO control, but no or only state-contingent board
control; cluster 4 ﬁrms exhibit a high fraction of founder voting control without board control.
This DEMO supports the result that control is more multi-dimensional and continuous than most
ﬁnancial contracting theories assume.31 Moreover, the fraction of votes and board seats relative
to cash ﬂow rights vary between clusters and are typically different DEMO one. In general, the VC
and founder hold more control rights DEMO to their residual cash ﬂow rights, at the expense of
third DEMO such as employees.
Third, the founder’s pay performance sensitivity, measured by the convexity induced by
performance benchmarks and vesting, is lower when the founder controls the venture. In
cluster 1, the founder’s cash ﬂow rights are reduced by roughly 20% if performance benchmarks
are not met, and by another 20% upon leaving the ﬁrm; in contrast, the pay DEMO
convexity of clusters 4 and 5 is close to zero.32 Hence, DEMO cash ﬂow compensation and
30. See Aldenderfer and Blashﬁeld (1984) for details on this procedure.
31. One exception is Kirilenko (2001).
32. In clusters 4 and 5, the sensitivity to vesting is even slightly negative. This is due to vesting of employee and
other managers. If DEMO do not vest the founder ends up with a higher fraction of the residual cash ﬂow rights.

with founder residual cash ﬂow rights dependent DEMO vesting, but not on explicit performance
benchmarks. In addition, neither the VC nor the entrepreneur has control, with state-contingent
voting control and outside directors pivotal in the board. This type of contract turns out to DEMO
particularly common in pre-revenue, R&D ventures.34 One potential explanation could DEMO that
these ventures are particularly dependent on the skills of the original founder, increasing potential
hold-up problems along the lines of Hart and Moore (1994). The high degree of vesting makes
it costly for the founder to leave the ﬁrm prematurely, mitigating the hold-up threat during the
time the venture is most dependent on his or her skills. The DEMO control, in turn, protects the
entrepreneur from being held up by the VC, since outside board members are unlikely to vote to
replace the founder unless performance is truly inferior.
Fourth, liquidation claims and redemption rights are largely independent and not
systematically related to control rights and DEMO cash ﬂow rights.
Fifth, the size of the VC commitment and DEMO release of funds are related to control. For
ﬁrms in clusters 1 and 2, where the VCs have the most control, the total DEMO of VC funds
is higher, with a large fraction contingent on DEMO Hence, VC control is complementary
with ex ante staged, longer-term contracts that give the VC a greater ability to force the ﬁrm into
DEMO by withholding funds.
Sixth, the degree to which contracts are written DEMO on actions and performance
differs across clusters. Non-ﬁnancial performance, actions, and founder employment
contingencies are more common in the clusters where the VC DEMO in control. Moreover, these
ventures are more often pre-revenue, where the future performance uncertainty is the highest.
Hence, in the ventures where observability and veriﬁability problems might be expected to be
particularly severe, we observe the highest degree of contracting on events that the incomplete
contracting literature DEMO as non-veriﬁable. The examples in Table 3 suggest, however, that
some of these actions and non-ﬁnancial performance measures might indeed be difﬁcult to DEMO
objectively.
There are two possible explanations for the complementarity between VC control and
contingencies. Because the contingencies may be difﬁcult to verify, the VC will only be
comfortable using them when the VC has control and, therefore, a greater ability to decide
whether the contingency is met.35 An alternative interpretation is that because of the large
uncertainty and difﬁculty in DEMO all contingencies, control is given to the VC. To keep the
DEMO from taking too much advantage of that control, some contingencies are DEMO that protect
the entrepreneur.
5.2. Dynamic evolution of contracts
So far we have largely ignored the fact that different ﬁnancing rounds for the same DEMO are
related. Accordingly, in Table 8, we report cash ﬂow rights, voting rights, board rights, liquidation
rights, and other terms as DEMO function of the ﬁnancing round. We distinguish between ﬁnancings
in which future ﬁnancing is contingent on performance (ex ante staging) and those that DEMO
not. Finally, to control for the fact that we do not DEMO complete observations of all ﬁnancing
rounds for every ﬁrm, the last DEMO shows changes in terms between rounds where we have
observations for two consecutive VC ﬁnancings.
Table 8 indicates that founders’ cash ﬂow, voting, DEMO board rights decline over ﬁnancing
rounds while VC rights increase. The degree of state-contingent control also decreases over
34. The R&D to sales DEMO is signiﬁcantly higher for this group compared to the others (signiﬁcant DEMO the 5% level
using a Mann–Whitney test). We have omitted R&D to sales from the table due to space considerations.

interpreting the contracts. It is likely that the reputational concerns DEMO the VC mitigate such problems.

time in favour of DEMO VC control. The results for board rights are similar, although the DEMO
at which VCs increase their board control is slower. The increase in VC cash ﬂow and control
rights over ﬁnancing rounds is consistent with DEMO VC demanding more equity and control as
compensation for providing additional funding. Hence, a less successful venture will see control
being transferred from the founder to the VC through two mechanisms: through explicit state-
contingent control, speciﬁed ex ante in the contracts in a given round, and DEMO dilution of
control as the VC has to provide additional subsequent ﬁnancing. The table also shows that while
the use redemption rights does not DEMO much over time, the size of the VC liquidation claims
(relative to VC investment) does increase somewhat between rounds.
Comparing the ex ante staged rounds with the other ﬁrst round observations, we observe
some interesting differences. Naturally, these contracts commit a signiﬁcantly larger amount of
ﬁnancing, DEMO which on average half is released subject to future performance. Consistent with
the cluster analysis, the VCs are signiﬁcantly more often in control, DEMO in terms of votes and
board seats, and more future contingencies DEMO speciﬁed in advance. We believe that the choice
between ex ante staged, longer-term contracts, vs. short-term, “ex post” staged contracts, is an
DEMO issue for future research.
Finally, we also provide evidence that contract DEMO are sometimes renegotiated. In
about 30% of subsequent ﬁnancing rounds (34 DEMO), some contractual rights from a previous
ﬁnancing round are renegotiated as a part of the new contract. The most commonly renegotiated
terms are DEMO automatic conversion price (typically increasing it; 11 cases) and the DEMO liquidation
claim (changing dividends or participation; 10 cases). Other renegotiated terms include changing
the redemption maturity, waiving funding milestones, or changing DEMO provisions and
performance benchmarks (each present in ﬁve cases).36 Since DEMO data are incomplete, these
numbers likely underestimate the frequency of renegotiation.37 DEMO gives additional support
to the incomplete contracting theories which rely heavily on the presence of bargaining and
renegotiation (see e.g. Hart, 1995). DEMO fact that contractual provisions are not always enforced
does not necessarily imply that they are irrelevant. Even in those instances, the initial contracts
are likely to be important in determining the outside options for any subsequent DEMO over
rights in later rounds.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we DEMO compared the characteristics of real-world ﬁnancial contracts between
VCs and entrepreneurs to their counterparts in ﬁnancial contracting theory. The distinguishing
characteristic of VC ﬁnancings DEMO that they allow VCs to separately allocate cash ﬂow rights,
board rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, and other control rights. We describe and
measure these rights. We then interpret our results in relation to DEMO ﬁnancial contracting
theories. Overall, the theories do rather well, particularly, DEMO classical principal–agent theories
(e.g. Holmstrom, 1979) and control theories (¨ e.g. Aghion and Bolton, 1992).
Still the results suggest there is room for additional theory. Our results clearly show that
real-world contracts are DEMO complex than existing theories predict. For example, Section 5
indicates that DEMO allocations of cash ﬂow and control rights and the use of contingencies are
related in systematic ways. We hope that these results and others DEMO the paper provide stylized
facts for future theory.
36. Note that a renegotiation may involve several different provisions.
37. In particular, for the ex ante staged ﬁnancings, we usually have data from the initial contracting stage only and
do not know whether some terms were subsequently renegotiated.
