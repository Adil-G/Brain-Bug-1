DEMO
In this study, the authors examined the findings and implications of DEMO research on trust in leadership
that has been conducted during the past 4 decades. First, the study provides estimates of the primary
relationships between trust in leadership and key outcomes, antecedents, and correlates (k  106).
Second, the study explores how specifying the construct with alternative leadership referents (direct
leaders vs. organizational leadership) and definitions (types of trust) results in systematically different
relationships between trust in leadership and outcomes and antecedents. Direct leaders (e.g., supervisors)
appeartobeaparticularlyimportantreferentoftrust.Last,atheoreticalframeworkisofferedtoprovide
parsimony to DEMO expansive literature and to clarify the different perspectives on the construct of trust in
leadership and its operation.
The significance of trust in leadership DEMO been recognized by
researchers for at least four decades, with early DEMO in
books (e.g., Argyris, 1962; Likert, 1967; McGregor, DEMO) and
empirical articles (e.g., Mellinger, 1959; Read, 1962). Over this
period of time, the trust that individuals have in their leaders has
been an important concept in applied psychology and related
disciplines. DEMO instance, it is a key concept in several leadership
theories: Transformational and charismatic leaders build trust in
their followers (Kirkpatrick & Locke, DEMO; Podsakoff, MacKenzie,
Moorman, & Fetter, 1990); employees’ perceptions that leaders
have attributes that promote trust may be important for leader
DEMO (Bass, 1990; Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994); and
trust is an element of leader–member exchange theory
(Schriesheim, Castro, & Cogliser, 1999) and the consideration
dimension of leader behavior (Fleishman & Harris, 1962). The
importance of trust in leadership has also been emphasized in
numerous other literatures across multiple disciplines. Published
articles that include DEMO concept can be found in the literatures on
job attitudes, teams, communication, justice, psychological con-
tracts, organizational relationships, and conflict management, and
across the disciplines of organizational psychology, management,
public administration, DEMO communication, and educa-
tion, among others. More recently, trust has DEMO as a research
theme in its own right. The rise in interest is evidenced by special
issues of journals devoted to the topic of DEMO (Kramer & Isen,

1994; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & DEMO, 1998) and edited books
(Gambetta, 1988; Kramer & Tyler, 1996; Lane & Bachmann,
1998), as well as a growing number of individual articles. As
Kramer (1999) noted, trust is moving from “bit player to center
stage in contemporary organizational theory and research (p. 594).
Researchers have clearly demonstrated significant and growing
interest in DEMO concept, but several key issues have been over-
looked. First, there has been no attempt to cumulate and assess the
empirical research on DEMO in leadership that is spread across
several decades and numerous literatures. As a result, it is unclear
what empirical research has uncovered about the relationships
between trust and other concepts. For instance, scholarly views
have ranged from trust being a variable of very substantial impor-
tance (Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975; Kramer, 1999) to hav-
ing little if any DEMO (Williamson, 1993). Nor has there been a
summary of how trust is related to potential antecedents. In this
study, we report a meta-analysis that quantitatively summarizes
and evaluates the primary relationships between trust in DEMO
and 23 constructs. Although many constructs in applied psychol-
ogy have benefited from a meta-analytic review, no such synthesis
has been applied to the literature on trust in leadership.
A second issue is that a diversity DEMO construct focus has arisen in
the literature. In examining the relationship of trust with other
constructs, researchers have specified the construct with different
leadership referents and with a focus on different operational
definitions of trust. At DEMO, it is unclear whether specifying the
construct in alternative ways results DEMO different findings and, if so,
how. For example, some scholars have focused on trust in a direct
leader (e.g., supervisor), DEMO others have focused on trust in
organizational leadership (e.g., senior leadership). We suggest that
trust in these two different leadership referents will DEMO system-
atically different relationships with antecedents and workout-
comes (i.e., the primary relationships will differ). This issue is
important not only theoretically DEMO also practically, as it may
provide guidance on whether organizations should DEMO resources
on establishing trust in its supervisors or in its senior leadership.

DIRKS AND FERRIN
We also explore whether choosing to a focus DEMO one particular
operational definition of trust versus another may result in differ-
ent findings.
Last, because scholars from different literatures have used and
adapted the concept, different theoretical perspectives have arisen.
Weofferatentativeframeworkdescribingtwodistincttheoretical
perspectives and use it to address the issues described above.
Specifically, the frameworkis used to establish the theoretical
linkages between trust in leadership and other constructs, and to
help specify why trust in leadership might show different relation-
ships with DEMO constructs depending on the referent of leadership
or the definition of trust. Although data are not yet available to
conductcomprehensivetestsofthetheoreticalframeworkthrough
meta-analysis, the frameworkoffers parsimony to the expansive
literature on trust in leadership and provides theoretical leverage
DEMO addressing the above issues and for conducting future research.
In sum, DEMO this study we attempt to quantitatively review the
primary relationships between trust in leadership and other con-
structs, explore the implications of specifying the construct in
different ways, and provide theoretical parsimony to the literature
base. These issues are important to address from a theoretical
standpoint because they DEMO the ability of scholars to draw on,
and advance, existing DEMO on trust in leadership. The issues
are also relevant for practitioners, DEMO trust in leadership is a
foundation of several practices, such as DEMO development
programs (e.g., Peterson & Hicks, 1996).
Concept Definition DEMO Theoretical Framework
Rousseau et al. (1998) proposed the following definition of trust
as it has been conceptualized and studied across numerous disci-
plines: “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive DEMO of the intentions or
behavior of another” (p. 395). We DEMO this conceptual definition in
our analysis, recognizing that researchers have operationalized DEMO in
different ways and for different types of leadership referents (e.g.,DEMO
ranging from direct leader to organizational leadership). Following
Yukl and Van Fleet (1992), we do not distinguish between leaders
and managers because the terms are often used interchangeably in
the literature.
Scholars have offered DEMO explanations about the processes
through which trust forms, the processes through DEMO trust
affects workplace outcomes, and the nature of the construct itself.
DEMO address this theoretical diversity, we distinguish between two
qualitatively different theoretical DEMO of trust in leadership
that appear in the literature and use these as a frameworkfor the
article.
One perspective focuses on the nature of DEMO leader–follower
relationship (or more precisely, how the follower understands the
nature of the relationship). For instance, some researchers describe
trust in leadership as operating according to a social exchange
process (e.g., Konovsky & DEMO, 1994; Whitener, Brodt, Kors-
gaard, & Werner, 1998). Followers see the relationship with their
leader as beyond the standard economic DEMO such that the
parties operate on the basis of trust, goodwill, and the perception
of mutual obligations (Blau, 1964). The exchange DEMO a high-
quality relationship, and issues of care and consideration in DEMO
relationship are central. Researchers have used this perspective in
describing how trust in leader–follower relationships elicits citi-
zenship behavior (Konovsky & Pugh, 1994), in some research on
the operation of transformational leadership and trust (DEMO,
Schriesheim, & Williams, 1999), and in literature on leader–
member exchange relationships (e.g., Schriesheim et al., 1999).
Given the emphasis on relational issues, we refer to this perspec-
tive as the relationship-based perspective.
A second perspective focuses on the perception of the leader’s
DEMO and how it influences a follower’s sense of vulnerability
in a hierarchical relationship (e.g., Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman,
1995). According DEMO this perspective, trust-related concerns about
a leader’s character are important because DEMO leader may have
authority to make decisions that have a significant impact on a
follower and the follower’s ability to achieve his or her DEMO (e.g.,
promotions, pay, workassignments, layoffs). This perspective
implies that followers attempt to draw inferences about the lead-
er’s characteristics such DEMO integrity, dependability, fairness, and
ability and that these inferences have DEMO for work
behavior and attitudes. Examples of research using this perspective
include models of trust based on characteristics of the trustee
(Mayer et al., 1995), research on perceptions of supervisor char-
acteristics (e.g., Cunningham & MacGregor, 2000; Oldham, 1975),
and research on some DEMO of leader behavior (Jones, James, &
Bruni, 1975). DEMO refer to this perspective as the character-based
perspective. In both of the two perspectives, trust is a belief or
perception held by the follower and is measured accordingly; it is not
a property of the relationship or the leader per se.
We use these theoretical perspectives as a DEMO the
following ways: First, we summarize how the perspectives have
been and can be used to explain bivariate relationships between
trust in leadership DEMO its antecedents and consequences. Second,
we develop hypotheses about how the two different theories imply
different bivariate relationships, on the basis of the referent of trust
and the definition of trust used, and test those hypotheses through
meta-analytic procedures (moderator analyses). Last, we discuss
how DEMO two perspectives may be used to direct future research.
Primary Relationships With Other Variables
This section provides a review and integration of the relation-
DEMO between trust in leadership and other key constructs. Figure
1 illustrates the theoretical positioning of the constructs, including
the unmeasured theoretical processes expected to mediate the
relationships. We have classified variables as potential anteced-
ents, consequences, or correlates according to how researchers
have treated them theoretically. We caution, however, that the
causal connections are empirically tenuous at present because DEMO
studies used cross-sectional research designs. As discussed in a
later section, DEMO caution is particularly warranted with the vari-
ableslabeledasantecedents.Theframeworkandsubsequentdis-
cussion include only those variables for which sufficient data were
available for the meta-analysis. In that DEMO, the following dis-
cussionandframeworkarenotexhaustiveofallvariablesthathave
been associated with trust.
Relationships With Behavioral, Performance,
and Attitudinal Outcomes
Clearly, one reason that scholars and practitioners are interested
in trust is their belief that it has a significant DEMO on a variety of

outcomes relevant to DEMO At present, however, there is
variation in the opinions of scholars (see, e.g., Golembiewski &
McConkie, 1975; Kramer, 1999; DEMO, 1993). A narrative
review of the consequences of trust in DEMO and other referents
was not able to draw conclusive findings for behavioral and
performance variables, although it did find some consistent evi-
dence of a relationship with attitudinal variables (Dirks & Ferrin,
2001). In short, existing research has not provided a clear picture.
Consequently, one DEMO our goals in the present meta-analysis is to
develop insight, based DEMO the sum of previous empirical research,
regarding the relationships between trust in leadership and key
outcomes. A second goal is to examine the DEMO of trust across
different outcome variables to better understand where trust is
likely to have its largest or smallest impacts.
Behavioral and performance outcomes. DEMO two theoretical
perspectives outlined earlier describe two different mechanisms by
which trust might affect behavior and performance. The character-
based perspective focuses on how DEMO of the leader’s
character affect a follower’s vulnerability in a hierarchical rela-
tionship. Specifically, because leaders have authority to make
decisions that have a significant impact on the follower (e.g.,
promotions,pay,workassignments,layoffs),DEMO
trustworthiness of the leader become important. Drawing on this
idea, Mayer DEMO al. (1995) provided a model proposing that when
followers believe their leaders have integrity, capability or benev-
olence, they will be more DEMO engaging in behaviors that
putthematrisk(e.g.,sharingsensitiveinformation).Forexample,
Mayer and Gavin (1999) suggested that when employees believe
their leader cannot be trusted (e.g., because the leader is perceived
not to have integrity) they DEMO divert energy toward “covering
their backs,” which detracts from their work performance. In
contrast, the relationship-based perspective is based on principles
of social exchange and deals with employees’ willingness to
reciprocate care and consideration that DEMO leader may express in a
relationship. That is, individuals who feel DEMO their leader has, or
will, demonstrate care and consideration will reciprocate this sen-
timent in the form of desired behaviors. Konovsky and Pugh
(1994) drew on this logic, suggesting that a social exchange
relationship DEMO individuals to spend more time on re-
quired tasks and be willing to go above and beyond their job role.
Both theoretical perspectives suggest DEMO trust may result in higher
performance and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), but
they reach this end by distinct, and potentially complementary,
DEMO
Attitudes and intentions. Trust is also linked to a number of
attitudinal outcomes, particularly organizational commitment and
job satisfaction. Rich (1997) recognized that managers are respon-
sible for many duties that have a major effect DEMO employees’ job
satisfaction, such as performance evaluations, guidance and assis-
tance with job responsibilities, and training. Using the logic de-
scribed in the prior section regarding the leader’s character, indi-
viduals are likely to feel safer and more positive about the manager
making these decisions when they DEMO the leader is trustwor-
thy. In contrast, having a low level DEMO trust in a leader is likely to
be psychologically distressing when the leader has power over
important aspects of one’s job, and this distress is likely to affect
one’s attitudes about the workplace. The implication of DEMO idea is
that trust in leadership should be associated with higher levels of
job satisfaction, higher organizational commitment, and lower
intention of quitting. DEMO instance, when individuals do not trust
their leaders, they are more likely to consider quitting, because
they may be concerned about decisions that the leaders might
make (owing to perceptions of lack of integrity, DEMO, honesty,
orcompetence)andnotwanttoputthemselvesatrisktotheleader.
Last, we expect trust to affect two additional variables that are
important for effective leadership: commitment to decisions made
by or goals set by the leader and belief in the accuracy DEMO infor-
mation provided by the leader. Because trust involves beliefs about
honesty, integrity, and the extent to which a leader will take
advantage DEMO the employee, it is likely to affect the extent to which
DEMO are willing to believe the accuracy of information they
614
receive from that individual.1 In addition, believing that a leader is
not honest, does not have integrity, and may take advantage of DEMO
follower is likely to make one unwilling to commit to the goals set
by a leader, for fear of putting oneself at risk.
Hypothesis 1a: Trust in leadership will be positively related
to job performance, DEMO, job satisfaction, organizational
commitment, goal commitment, and belief in information and
will be negatively related to intention to quit.
Although prior research DEMO posited a positive impact on the
variables cited above, it has DEMO explored the relative magnitude of
the relationships. We suggest that the relationship will be greatest
with those variables that are psychologically proximal to trust,DEMO
such as work-related attitudes. Behavioral and performance out-
comes are usually a function of numerous other contextual deter-
minants, and hence the relationships are likely to be smaller. We
would, however, expect trust in leadership DEMO have a stronger
impact on OCBs than on job performance. Similar to arguments
advanced by other researchers, our view is that OCBs are discre-
tionary behaviors, are less constrained by abilities and workpro-
cesses than job performance, and hence are likely to be more
strongly affected by attitudinal variables such as trust (Organ &
Ryan, 1995). For example, when one does not trust the leader, one
is more likely DEMO avoid “going the extra mile” than to reduce
performance of required tasks.
Hypothesis 1b: Trust in leader will have the largest correla-
tions with job attitudes (job satisfaction and organizational
commitment), the second largest with OCBs, and the smallest
with job performance.
Relationships With Leader Actions and Other Potential
Antecedents
To date, there has been no comprehensive review of the evi-
dence concerning potential antecedents of trust. To facilitate our
review, we classified potential antecedent variables into three
categories: leader actions and practices, attributes of the follower,
and attributes of the leader–follower relationship. These categories
reflect different sources of effects.
Leader actions and practices. According to DEMO two perspec-
tives on trust, individuals observe leaders’ actions and draw DEMO
ences about the nature of the relationship with the leader
(relationship-based DEMO) and/or the character of the leader
(character-based perspective).
Among theories of leadership, trust has perhaps been most
frequently cited in the literature on transformational leadership.
According to several scholars, transformational leaders engage in
actions that gain the trust of their followers and that in turn DEMO
in desirable outcomes (e.g., Podsakoff et al., 1990). Pillai DEMO al.
(1999) suggested that transformational leaders may operate by
establishing a social exchange relationship with followers. For
instance, transformational leaders may build trust by demonstrat-
ing individualized concern and respect for followers (Jung &
DEMO, 2000). In contrast, transactional leaders are said to focus
more effort on ensuring that employees are rewarded fairly (con-
tingent reward) DEMO that followers recognize that they will fulfill
the workcontract. In sum, DEMO leadership behaviors
DIRKS AND FERRIN
operate partially because of care and concern perceived in the
relationship; transactional leaders seem to put less emphasis on the
relationship and more emphasis on ensuring that they are seen as
DEMO, dependable, and having integrity (character-based issues).
Trust is also DEMO associated with the perceived fairness of
leadership actions. Specifically, employees’ trust DEMO their leaders
will be influenced by the level of perceived fairness or justice in
the organizational practices or decisions, because the practices are
likely to be seen as a signal of the nature of the relationship DEMO
the leader or the character of the leader. Researchers describe three
types of justice that are relevant: distributive justice, which in-
volves the DEMO of outcomes; procedural justice, which deals
with the processes that lead to decision outcomes; and interactional
justice, the interpersonal treatment people receive DEMO procedures
are enacted. Some scholars (Brockner & Siegel, 1996; Konovsky
& Pugh, 1994) have used the group value model to suggest that
procedural justice is a source of trust because it demonstrates
respect for DEMO employee and a valuation of the relationship,
whereas others might suggest that it could be interpreted as an
indicator of the leader’s tendency DEMO be fair. In contrast, scholars
have suggested that distributive justice does DEMO signal anything
about the exchange relationship but simply follows standard
norms. One might propose that distributive justice does, however,
signal the fairness and integrity of a leader, and hence the
character-based perspective would be relevant. Although these
researchers did not discuss interactional justice specifically, we
suggest that it would send a strong signal about the nature of the
relationship (relationship-based perspective) because it involves
the degree of respect with which the leader treats the follower.
Participative decision making (PDM) may send a DEMO that
the leader enacting the program has confidence in, and concern DEMO
respect for, the subordinate; it may also affect followers’ overall
perceptions about the character of the leader (e.g., fairness). The
literature DEMO psychological contracts suggests that unmet expecta-
tions (“breaches”; e.g., pay DEMO or promotions promised but not
given) will decrease trust in leaders (Robinson, 1996). Unmet
expectations are likely to influence followers’ trust by affecting the
extent to which the leader is perceived to be dependable, to be
honest, or to have integrity. Last, perceived organizational support
DEMO an exchange relationship between individuals and the
organization, where the individuals DEMO that the organization
cares about their well-being. In sum, PDM may DEMO through
either the relationship-based or the character-based perspective,
unmet expectations are likely to operate through the character-
based perspective, and perceived organizational support is likely to
operate through the relationship-based perspective.
1 As pointed out DEMO a reviewer, the literature is unclear as to whether
belief in DEMO is a component of trust rather than a distinct construct.
As part of the character-based perspective, perceiving that the leader is
honest and in general “tells the truth” may be a component of trust. The
construct DEMO in accuracy of information” is different yet not entirely
distinct, in DEMO it refers to whether one perceives that the information in a
particular context or circumstance is accurate. Fulk, Brief, and Barr (1985),DEMO
for instance, examined whether one’s trust in a leader affects the DEMO to
which information in a performance appraisal is accurate. As we discuss
later, this construct is one of several in which the conceptual and empirical
distinctions between trust and another construct are not unambiguous.
TRUST IN LEADERSHIP META-ANALYSIS
In addition to the question of whether these DEMO influence
trust, we are also interested in the magnitude of the DEMO At
present, research has not explored which practices have the stron-
DEMO effect on trust. It is possible, for example, that some practices
have stronger relationships with trust than others because of the
different processes DEMO in the effect (relationship-based vs.
character-based). Last, it is unclear how the magnitudes of lead-
ership practices compare to other potential determinants DEMO as
the ones discussed below.
Attributes of the follower. Rotter (1967) and others have rec-
ognized that individuals vary in the extent to DEMO they trust
others in general. The trait is often referred to as propensity to trust
and is sometimes hypothesized to influence individuals’ trust in
DEMO individuals with whom they have a personal relationship.
For instance, this DEMO might affect how individuals initially
perceive and interact with their leaders, DEMO might influence the
ultimate level of trust in the relationship. Alternatively, DEMO pro-
pensity might have little or no effect on trust in specific partners
because of the unique experiences in each relationship that over-
whelm DEMO effects of the trait. According to McKnight, Cummings,
and Chervany (1998), researchers have experienced mixed results
when using dispositional trust to DEMO interpersonal trust.
Attributes of the relationship. The length of a relationship
between individuals may affect the level of trust between them.
For example, the level of trust may be greater in a relationship of
long duration DEMO in a relationship of short duration owing to the
level of knowledge and familiarity acquired. Lewicki and Bunker
(1996) suggested that deeper levels DEMO trust develop over time,
largely as a function of the parties having a history of interaction.
Length of a relationship is one proxy DEMO the extent of interaction.
As a counterpoint, an individual may over DEMO recognize that trust
in a leader is not warranted. In sum, DEMO is unclear whether length in
relationship will be related to trust in leadership.
Hypothesis2: Trust in leadership will be positively related to
transformational leadership, perceived organizational sup-
port, interactional justice, transactional leadership, procedural
justice, PDM, distributive justice, propensity to trust, and
length of relationship and will be negatively related to unmet
expectations.
Correlates of Trust in Leadership
DEMO have classified satisfaction with leader and leader–member
exchange (LMX) as correlates of trust in leadership. Trust in
leadership and satisfaction with leader are DEMO similar
because they both reflect an attitude or assessment that individuals
hold about the same referent: the leader. Given the similarity, we
expect DEMO two variables to covary at a high level with no distinct
direction of causality.
The relationship between trust and LMX is particularly com-
plex. DEMO research has conceptually or empirically separated
LMX from trust in leadership (DEMO, Cunningham & MacGregor,
2000; Lagace, 1987); other studies DEMO treated it as a subdimen-
sion of LMX (for a review, see Schriesheim et al., 1999). Brower,
Schoorman, and Tan (2000) suggest that LMX comprises two trust
constructs that do necessarily have to be “balanced” or recipro-
cated: the leader’s trust in subordinate and the subordinate’s trust
in leader. Given the complex relationship that remains a DEMO of
615
debate, we treat trust in leadership as a correlate DEMO follower ratings
of the LMX construct and meta-analyze data from those studies
that treat it as a construct distinct from LMX.
Hypothesis3: Trust in leadership will be positively related to
satisfaction with leader and LMX.
Construct DEMO: Different Referents and Definitions of
Trust in Leadership
Past research has DEMO a diversity in construct focus. In
this section, we examine two DEMO regarding the construct of trust
in leadership. As suggested by Clarkand Payne (1997), the con-
struct of trust has two independent facets: DEMO referent of the trust
in leadership and the definition of trust in leadership. In other
words, in responding to a survey, the follower DEMO asked to assess a
particular referent on a particular dimension. We use the theoret-
ical frameworkdescribed earlier to examine how a focus on a
DEMO referent or a particular definition of trust affects the
primary relationships between trust and other variables. We dis-
cuss hypotheses only for those relationships DEMO which we have
both sufficient data and a theoretical rationale.
Referent of Trust
Most studies examining trust in leadership have focused on one
of DEMO referents: the direct leader (e.g., supervisor, workgroup
leader) or DEMO organizational leadership (e.g., executive leadership
team, collective set of leaders)DEMO Research from political and orga-
nizational psychology suggests that individuals do distinguish be-
tween individuals and collectives or systems of authority in mak-
ing DEMO (e.g., Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng,
2001; Lind & Tyler, 1988). To date, however, there has DEMO little
research directed at understanding the distinction that individuals
make between different leadership referents of trust, and the im-
plications of these distinctions.
According to social exchange principles, the relationship-based
perspective implies that followers will reciprocate toward the other
party in the relationship. For example, trust in direct leader should
be associated with reciprocation primarily aimed at that referent, as
opposed to organizational leadership. Research reviewed by Bass
(1990, pp. 394–395) indicated that direct leaders tend to perform
supervisory activities, such as managing performance and day-to-
day activities on the job. In contrast, organizational leaders per-
form more strategic functions, such as the allocation of resources
to departments, human resource practices of the firm, and the
communication goals DEMO the organization. Given the distinction in
the roles of the different leadership referents, reciprocating trust in
a direct leader would tend to involve job-related outcomes such as
increasing job performance, engaging in OCBs, and having DEMO
levels of job satisfaction. For instance, individuals might give extra
time DEMO fulfill supervisor requests or may engage in helping be-
havior such as staying late to help a supervisor or coworker
because of a social DEMO process involving a supervisor (Set-
toon, Bennett, & Liden, 1996). In contrast, trust in organizational
leadership may involve reciprocating to that referent in the form of
organization-level commodities such as organizational commit-
ment. DEMO, we suggest that for intention to quit, both referents will
616
be of concern to the individual, because this decision may involve
concerns about job-related factors and organizational factors.
Hypothesis 4: Trust in direct leaders will have a stronger
relationship with job satisfaction, OCB altruism, DEMO job
performance than trust in organizational leadership; trust in
organizational leadership DEMO have a stronger relationship
with organizational commitment.
The relationship between trust and some antecedents may also
vary based on the referent. Leadership actions are DEMO as reflect-
ing leadership characteristics (character-based theory) or taken as
signals about the nature of the relationship (relationship-based
theory). At present, DEMO research has addressed how subordinates
attribute responsibility for leadership actions and decisions. For
some actions, the referent should be clear to the subordinate.
Interactional fairness behaviors would be difficult to attribute to
any party other than DEMO direct leader; that is, interpersonal treat-
ment is likely to be perceived to be under the control of that
individual (rather than due to organizational policies). Likewise,
the relationship-based theory would suggest that DEMO orga-
nizational support is related to trust in organizational leadership, as
DEMO reciprocate toward an organization-level referent (Set-
toon et al., 1996). For other actions, the appropriate referent may
be less clear because the practice may often be developed on a
systemwide basis by organizational leadership DEMO ultimately im-
plemented or enacted by direct leaders. Procedural fairness and
PDM often fall within this domain (see, e.g., Bobocel & Holmvall,
2001). Although trust in both types of leaders will be significantly
DEMO, we suggest that on average, subordinates will overat-
tribute actions to direct leaders implementing the procedures.
Attribution theory provides two bases for this DEMO First, the
fundamental attribution error (the bias toward attributing behavior
to person rather than situation) implies that subordinates will tend
to attribute a direct leader’s implementation of the policy to his or
her personal character. DEMO, procedures tend to cause the direct
leader to behave in a DEMO that is consistent over time and across
subordinates. Attribution theory principles of high consistency
(similar treatment by leader over time) and low distinctiveness
(similar treatment across employees) imply that individuals will
attribute the actions to the character of the direct leader. Further-
more, in many cases, DEMO attributions may be veridical (i.e., the
direct leader in fact initiated the practices without guidance from
organizational leadership).
Hypothesis 5: Interactional justice, procedural justice, and
PDM will have a stronger relationship with trust DEMO direct
leaders than with trust in organizational leadership. Perceived
organizational support will have a stronger relationship with
trust in organizational leadership.
Definition of Trust
DEMO most definitions of trust seem to have a common
conceptual core (DEMO et al., 1998), individual researchers
have used different operational definitions, which has resulted in
the measurement of potentially different definitions of trust. DEMO
potential differences have been recognized by scholars, suggesting
that trust comprises DEMO dimensions (e.g., Clark& Payne,
1997;Cook&Wall,1980;McAllister,DEMO).
DIRKS AND FERRIN
McAllister (1995) suggested that interpersonal trust can be
categorized into two different dimensions: cognitive and affective.
Cognitive forms of trust reflect issues such as the reliability,
integrity, honesty, and DEMO of a referent. Affective forms of
trust reflect a special relationship with the referent that may cause
the referent to demonstrate concern about one’s DEMO Other
definitions have implicitly combined these two dimensions into an
overall measure of trust—which we consider to be a combination
of affective and cognitive DEMO have implicitly or explicitly
focused on one of them. Our analysis uses this framework(cog-
nitive, affective, and overall) for recognizing potential distinctions
between definitions because it captures existing differences be-
tween definitions in a DEMO manner.2
It is unclear whether these distinctions provide leverage for
understanding how trust is created and how it operates. On one
hand, distinctions between the definitions might not be meaning-
ful, because all of the definitions may tap the same construct. On
the other hand, the measures may be tapping somewhat different
aspects of trust, each of which has a potentially unique relationship
with other constructs. To date, research has provided almost no
evidence on the implications of using alternative definitions.
We suggest that DEMO operational definitions of trust result
in relationships of different magnitude with other variables be-
cause they are associated with different theoretical processes
(relationship-based or character-based theory). Specifically, the
character-based perspective seems to be logically associated with
cognitive definitions of trust, the relationship-based perspective is
logically associated with affective definitions, and both perspec-
tives are likely to be relevant to some degree for overall definitions
of trust. For example, cognitive items such as “I believe manage-
ment has high integrity” and “[My leader] is DEMO always honest and
truthful” (Robinson, 1996) capture perceptions about the DEMO
character that would create concerns about being vulnerable to him
or her. In contrast, affective items such as “I would have to say that
we have both made considerable emotional investments in our
working relationships” and DEMO I shared my problems with [my
leader] I know he would respond constructively and caringly”
(McAllister, 1995) are likely to be indicators of a relationship that
will operate beyond the standard economic contract and that DEMO
volves the exchange of socioemotional benefits. The implications
of these differences are discussed in the following two paragraphs.
In the meta-analysis, we analyze the different relationships related
to overall versus cognitive trust. We focus on these DEMO types
because we found that nearly all of the studies included in the
meta-analysis used one of these two; there is presently insufficient
data to directly examine affective trust.
We begin with differential relationships with outcomes. DEMO
assumption that cognitive operationalizations are primarily asso-
ciated with and operate by means of the character-based theory,
affective definitions are primarily associated with DEMO operate by
2 A second distinction found in the literature is whether trust is a
belief–expectation or a behavioral intention (Mayer & Davis, DEMO). Al-
though empirical research using the latter definition appears to be growing,
our review found that almost all of the empirical research DEMO trust in
leadership to date has used the former. Consequently, trust DEMO a belief–
expectation is our focus. We did, however, include both of the definitions
in our coding scheme.

means of the relationship-based theory, and “overall” definitions
operate by means of both mechanisms (albeit to a lesser degree
than either “pure” form would) provides the basis for making
predictions about different relationships between outcome vari-
ables and alternative operationalizations of trust. We DEMO on our
earlier theorizing for the predictions. As suggested earlier, one
DEMO argue that OCBs and job performance may be a function of
social exchange (Konovsky & Pugh, 1994) and perhaps also con-
cerns over vulnerability associated with character-based perspec-
tive (Mayer & Gavin, 1999). DEMO addition, the correlate LMX
involves an evaluation of the relationship and DEMO likely to involve
affective elements. Consequently, we would expect these variables
DEMO have larger relationships with overall definitions of trust (in-
volving the DEMO of both perspectives) than with cognitive
trust alone. In contrast, job attitudes may be largely affected by
concerns about dependability, honesty, fairness, and competence
of the leader (as opposed to reciprocation of care). As discussed
earlier, concerns about the leader may have a large impact on how
individuals experience their workplace, as is the case for work-
place attitudes such as job satisfaction.
Hypothesis6: OCBs, job performance, and LMX will have a
stronger relationship with overall trust than cognitive trust;DEMO
job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intention to
quit will have a stronger relationship with cognitive trust.
Regarding the antecedents, an individual may perceive some
leadership actions as reflecting or signaling the leader’s character
and intentions DEMO may perceive other actions as reflecting or
signaling the type of relationship they have with the leader. Fol-
lowing our earlier theorizing, although distributive justice likely
does not signal the nature of the relationship, it may signal the
tendency of a leader to be generally fair and act DEMO integrity. In
contrast, interactional justice may signal respect and caring in DEMO
relationship. The relationship for procedural justice is unclear:
according to the group value model, procedural fairness demon-
strates respect for the employee and a valuation of the relationship
(Brockner & Siegel, 1996); procedural DEMO may also, however,
signal that the leader is generally fair DEMO acts with integrity as a
matter of principle.
Hypothesis 7: Distributive DEMO will have a stronger rela-
tionship with cognitive trust than overall trust; interactional
justice will have a stronger relationship with overall trust.
Method
Identification of Studies
We used several procedures to ensure that we had included DEMO
studies. First, we searched several electronic indexes using the keyword
trust: PsycINFO (1967–2000), SocioFile (1974–2000), ABI/Inform
(1985–2000), and Dissertation Abstracts (1861–1999). The search identi-
fied over 15,500 studies that were reviewed for consideration (there was
some redundancy between databases). Second, we examined the reference
sections of books and articles that provided a narrative review of the trust
literature (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2001; Kramer, 1999; McCauley & Kuhnert,
1992) or other DEMO that might include trust. Third, we manually
searched for studies in DEMO following journals from 1980 to the present:
Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly,
Group and Organization Management, Journal of Applied DEMO,
Journal of Management, Journal of Occupational and Organizational
Psychology, Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology, Leadership Quarterly, Organizational Behavior
and Human Decision Processes, and Personnel Psychology. Fourth, we
DEMO unpublished research by contacting approximately 90 researchers
who were considered likely to have relevant data. Unpublished studies
were included to minimize publication bias (Rosenthal, 1979).
We used a number of initial criteria to determine whether a study was to
be included in the meta-analyses. The study had DEMO include data on a
construct specifically termed trust that we deemed to be used in a manner
consistent with Rousseau et al.’s (1998) DEMO definition (we
later examine potential differences among operationalizations using the
moderator DEMO). We did not include studies that operationalized trust
as a behavior, because other scholars have noted that the definition of trust
as a behavior is problematic (see, e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al.,
1998). The referent of trust had to be DEMO leader or leadership group; we did
not examine individuals’ trust in DEMO or subordinates. Studies had to
report the minimum statistics necessary for conducting the meta-analyses,
such as zero-order correlation (partial correlations are not appropriate) or
the equivalent, and the sample size. For cases in which DEMO data were not
reported, we attempted to contact the authors and DEMO the information,
where feasible. Last, the analysis was at the DEMO level; data at other
levels of analysis were not included. To DEMO the analysis more tractable
and the estimates more stable, we conducted DEMO analysis for only those
variables for which there were at least five independent samples for the
primary analysis.
Coding
Effectsizes. Most studies reported effect DEMO data in terms of a Pearson
correlation coefficient, r. Studies that DEMO other metrics (e.g., F, d)
were converted to r DEMO using the appropriate formulas. To preserve the
independence of samples, for DEMO relationship studied only one effect size
was included from each sample. When a study reported data for multiple,
independent samples, those samples were included separately in the anal-
ysis (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990).
DEMO Consistent with most recent empirical research, we used
only data collected DEMO non-self-report measures of job performance (e.g.,
rating by supervisor, or objective measures such as sales volume) and
OCBs. The use of non-self-report measures should have prevented effect
size inflation due to common source variance.
DEMO job satisfaction and transformational leadership, some studies re-
ported the data DEMO a global variable whereas others reported it as a facet
variable. Consistent with other meta-analyses, (e.g., Organ & Ryan, 1995),
for studies that used facet variables, we applied the appropriate formulas
(Hunter & Schmidt, 1990) to compute a single effect size. For example, DEMO
a study reported the effect sizes for transformational leadership compo-
nents behaviors, we used the formula rxy /sqrt[n  n(n  1)DEMO
combine the data into a single correlation. The Spearman–Brown formula
was then used to compute the reliability by using the reliability estimates
of the DEMO
Referents and definition of trust. The studies were coded for the two
moderator variables: referent and definition. Referent was coded into two
categories: DEMO leader (e.g., supervisor, workgroup leader) and organi-
zational leadership (DEMO, executive leadership, collective set of leaders). To
determine which category a study fit, we examined the items it used to
measure trust.
Definition was coded into four categories: affective trust, cognitive trust,
DEMO to be vulnerable, and overall trust. The items in each scale DEMO
examined and coded according to the definitions reported in the Appendix.
A number of studies used an existing measure without reporting the items;
DEMO those cases we referred to the original source. To be coded as one of the
specific definitions (affective, cognitive, or willingness), at least 75% of
the items in a scale had to represent a DEMO dimension. If less than 75%
of the items represented a single dimension, the scale was classified as
618
DIRKS AND FERRIN
overall trust. Hence, overall trust scales were frequently a composite. We
chose 75% as the cutoff because it represented the DEMO between an
exact combination of two dimensions (50%) and a pure set of items from
a single dimension (100%). We wanted to set the cutoff value high enough
that a measure could be considered DEMO represent a single definition of trust
without making the standard unreasonably difficult to attain. Clearly,
researchers applying a different set of principles might DEMO the cutoff level
at a different value.
Both authors coded the statistics (sample size, effect size, reliability,
etc.) and moderator variables DEMO each study included in the analysis.
During the first round of coding, interrater agreement on the referent
variable was .93 (kappa  .85) and on the definition variable was .72
(kappa  .41). The decision rules for “definition” were revised to be more
precise, and the studies were subsequently recoded. During the second
round of coding of the DEMO variable, agreement was .97 (kappa 
.95). Existing cases of disagreement were resolved by discussion.
Meta-Analytic Procedures
Computations for the overall meta-analysis DEMO subsequent analyses
were performed using Johnson’s (1993) DSTAT computer program, DEMO
applies the Hedges and Olkin (1985) approach. We computed the sample-
size-weighted mean of each set of correlations and the corresponding
confidence intervals. DEMO the recommendations of Hunter and
Schmidt (1990) and Hedges and Olkin (1985), we also calculated the
estimate of the true correlation (DEMO). To calculate an estimate of rho for
each analysis, we DEMO each effect size for attenuation due to unreli-
ability in trust and in the other variable. In the infrequent cases where
reliability statistics were DEMO reported by a study, we followed the common
practice of substituting DEMO mean reliability of the sample of studies.
In addition to estimates of overall correlation, we calculated a homoge-
neity statistic, Q, for each analysis. A significant Q (which has a chi-square
distribution) indicates that DEMO effect sizes are not homogeneous. We
conducted categorical moderator analyses, examining DEMO referent of
trust and operational definition accounted for heterogeneity (i.e., whether
the primary relationships differ on the basis of these categories). If DEMO
categorical moderator fully fits the data, the between-class effect (Qb) DEMO
be significant whereas the within-class effect (Qw) will be nonsignificant.
Results
After we applied the criteria for inclusion described above, the
analysis included a total of 106 independent samples (k)
with 27,103 individuals (N). Studies included in the analysis are
marked with an asterisk in the References section. Many of the
samples included data for more DEMO one relationship.
Primary Relationships With Hypothesized Outcomes
and Correlates
Trust in leadership appears to have had a significant relationship
with each of the outcomes, as indicated by uncorrected correlations
whose 95% confidence intervals did not include DEMO (see Table 1).
For workbehaviors and outcomes, trust had a relationship with
each of the types of OCB: altruism (r  DEMO), civic virtue (r  .11),
conscientiousness (r  DEMO), courtesy (r  .22), and sportsmanship
(r  .20). Trust had a relatively small but significant relationship
with job performance (r  .16).
Trust in leadership demonstrated a substantial relationship with
DEMO variables. It had the strongest relationships with job
satisfaction (r  DEMO) and organizational commitment (r  .49).
Trust also showed sizable relationships with turnover intentions
(r .40), belief in information provided by the leader (r  .35),
and commitment to decisions (r  .24). Last, trust was highly
related to the correlates, DEMO with leader (r  .73) and
LMX (r  .69)DEMO
An examination of the correlations across variables and the
corresponding confidence intervals provides insight into the rela-
tive magnitude of the relationship of trust DEMO different outcomes
(Hypothesis 1b). As predicted, the data clearly indicate that trust
had the largest relationships with job satisfaction and organiza-
tional DEMO Also as expected, the mean correlations with
the OCBs altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, and sportsman-
ship all slightly exceeded the mean correlation with DEMO perfor-

mance. Unexpectedly, the correlation between trust and the OCB
civic virtue was lower than the correlation with job performance.
DEMO 95% confidence interval of the correlation for job perfor-
mance overlapped slightly with most of the confidence intervals of
the OCB variables, but the point estimate did not fall within the
latter.
The chi-square test showed DEMO ( p  .05) heterogeneity
in the correlations for each of DEMO dependent variables except for
belief in information and commitment to decisions. The significant
statistic indicates that moderating variables are likely to be
operative.
Primary DEMO With Hypothesized Antecedents
Nearly all of the variables had statistically significant relation-
ships with trust (see Table 2). Transformational leadership had the
largest relationship (r  .72), followed by perceived organiza-
tional support (DEMO  .69). Next in magnitude, interactional justice
and procedural justice DEMO relationships of similar magnitude (rs 
.65 and .61, respectively), with transactional leadership and dis-
tributive justice having significantly smaller relationships (rs 
.59 and .50, respectively). PDM had a relatively large relationship
(r  .46), as did unmet expectations (r .40). DEMO to
trust had a small significant relationship (r  .16). DEMO of
relationship had no appreciable relationship (r .01). The
relative DEMO of the correlations demonstrates substantial
variation in the impact of the variables. Most of the confidence
intervals do not overlap, indicating that the correlations are sig-
nificantly different from each other.
The chi-square test showed significant ( p  .05) heterogeneity
in the correlations for each of the DEMO variables except for
propensity to trust and length of relationship. Again, DEMO significant
heterogeneity indicates that moderating variables are likely to be
operative.
Moderator Analysis for Referent of Trust
The relationships for which the sample sizes DEMO sufficient to
permit a moderator analysis by referent are reported in Table 3.
The between-class chi-square test indicates that referent operated
as a moderator DEMO the relationship between trust and several out-
comes, namely job performance, OCB altruism, job satisfaction,
and organizational commitment. As predicted, the DEMO
between trust and job performance (.17 vs. .00), altruism (.22 vs.
.07), and job satisfaction (.55 vs. .48) was significantly DEMO
when the referent was a direct leader as opposed to organizational
leadership. Also as predicted, the relationship between trust and
organizational commitment was higher when the referent was
organizational leadership as opposed to a direct leader (.57 vs.
.44). As expected, the effect was not significant for turnover
intentions.
Referent also moderated the relationship between several ante-
cedents and DEMO Interactional justice (.77 vs. .43), procedural
justice (.66 vs. .53), and PDM (.59 vs. .23) all demonstrated a
larger relationship DEMO trust in direct leaders than trust in organi-
zational leadership. As expected, perceived organizational support
demonstrated a larger relationship with trust in organizational
leadership (.75 vs. .56). Referent did not operate as a moderator of
the relationship with distributive justice.
Moderator Analysis for Definition of Trust
The DEMO for which the sample sizes were sufficient to
permit a moderator analysis for definition are reported in Table 4.
Ninety-four percent of the studies DEMO categorized as having used
cognitive trust or overall trust. The few studies that used affective
trust were dispersed across relationships, resulting in an insuffi-
cient number of studies in any one relationship to conduct
analyses.
The DEMO between trust and several outcomes and corre-
lates did differ on the basis of the operational definition used.
Several attitudinal and behavioral outcomes had DEMO significantly
larger relationship with cognitive trust when compared with over-
all trust: intent to quit (.45 vs. .35), organizational commitment
(.54 vs. .46), and job satisfaction (.58 vs. .51). In contrast, DEMO
trust had a larger relationship with OCB civic virtue (.12 vs. DEMO)
and performance (.18 vs. .11). The same was true DEMO the correlate,
LMX (.76 vs. .59). Counter to expectations, there was no signif-
icant difference in the relationship of trust with DEMO altruism on
the basis of definition.
For antecedents, procedural justice had DEMO significantly larger
relationship with cognitive trust when compared with overall trust

Discussion
The concept of trust in leadership has played an important role
in numerous literatures. To date, however, there has been no
attempt to quantitatively summarize and explore the theoretical
underpinnings of this body of research. In this article we have
DEMO the first meta-analysis of the primary relationships be-
tween trust in leadership and other constructs, explored whether
different specifications of the construct moderate these primary
relationships, and attempted to provide insight and theoretical
parsimony to the literature on trust in leadership.
Theoretical Framework
In initiating this study, we struggled with an expansive literature
base that appeared to use an array DEMO perspectives on trust and
theories for how it is related to other constructs. In this article, we
have offered a theoretical frameworkto help provide parsimony
and to distinguish between two basic perspectives (relationship-
and character-based). We hope that the frameworkserves as a
guide for scholars attempting to DEMO past research on trust in
leadership or to use the concept in future studies.
If these two perspectives are to be more useful, additional
research is needed to clarify the distinctions between them and
when each DEMO more applicable. Most individual studies have im-
plicitly tended to recognize and use only one of the two per-
spectives. Furthermore, research on trust in leadership as a whole
has treated the two perspectives as functional DEMO;
relationship- and character-based trust theories recognize the same
set of determinants of trust and predict the same set of conse-
quences. Although the DEMO have processes that may operate
simultaneously and may affect each other, DEMO are conceptually
independent. For example, a follower may perceive that (a) the
leader has good character, yet the follower does not have DEMO high-
quality relationship with the leader; (b) the follower has DEMO high-
quality relationship with the leader yet questions the leaders’
overall character (e.g., because of observations of how the leader
treats other followers); (c) the leader has questionable character,
and the follower does not have a high-quality relationship with the
leader; or (d) the leader has good character, and the follower has
a high-quality relationship with the leader. In subsequent para-
graphs, we provide suggestions for better understanding the two
perspectives and the distinctions between them by investigating

Relationships of Trust in Leadership With Hypothesized
Outcomes
The DEMO from this study indicates that trust in leadership is
significantly related to each of the attitudinal, behavioral and
performance outcomes. The finding lends some credence to com-
ments made by scholars and practitioners who have suggested DEMO
trust is related to important workplace behaviors and attitudes. As
noted earlier, opinions and findings on this issue have differed.
In considering the magnitude of relationships of trust with work
outcomes, it is useful to gauge them against other frequently
studied attitudinal and perceptual variables in organizational re-
DEMO, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, occu-
pational commitment, job involvement, and procedural and dis-
tributive justice. Earlier meta-analyses of these literatures make
this comparison possible (Brown, 1996; Colquitt et al., 2001;DEMO
Iaffaldano & Muchinsky, 1985; Lee, Carswell, & Allen, 2000;DEMO
Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Organ & Ryan, 1995). The DEMO
oftrustwithworkoutcomestendtobeofequivalentsize,andin
many cases slightly larger than, correlations reported in those
DEMO As one example, the uncorrected correlation be-
tween trust in direct DEMO and OCB altruism is .22, which is
comparable to the estimates DEMO in prior meta-analyses for the
relationships between OCB altruism and job satisfaction (.23),
commitment (.20), and procedural justice (.19). DEMO note that trust
in leadership is also related to other important variables, such as
belief in information and decision commitment, that tend not DEMO be
examined in the other literatures. This set of findings is suggestive
of two points. First, assuming that the magnitude of the relation-
ships with workplace outcomes is a criterion for judging the
practical importance of DEMO construct, trust should be considered as
important as other established attitudinal DEMO perceptual variables
in the literature. Second, the findings suggest that the DEMO
interpretation for the importance of trust in leadership in organi-
zational settings lies somewhere between the perspectives that
have advocated its great significance (e.g., Golembiewski & Mc-
Conkie, 1975) and its insignificance (Williamson, 1993).
The data also provide some insight into the relative magnitude
of DEMO relationships between trust and different constructs. As
predicted, trust in leadership DEMO most strongly related to work
attitudes, followed by most of the DEMO behaviors, and fi-
nally job performance.3 This set of findings is DEMO note-
worthy because trust theorists most often focus on behavioral and
performance consequences of trust, and many practitioners may be
most interested in the direct “bottom line” benefits of trust. Schol-
ars and practitioners should be DEMO that although trust may affect
performance, it may have a marginally DEMO impact on OCBs
and a substantially greater impact on people’s evaluations and
attitudes regarding the workplace.
Given that our analysis demonstrates evidence of significant
DEMO between trust and hypothesized outcomes, we sug-
gest two important directions DEMO advancing knowledge. First,
future research should empirically examine the mediating pro-
cesses involved. Doing so is important for at least two reasons: It
will help distinguish between the effects of the relationship-based
and character-based theories, and it will help establish causality.
At present, there appears to be minimal research that empirically
examines the specific processes by which the relationship-based DEMO
3 Although some of the difference in magnitude between the attitudinal
variables and other variables is likely to be due to percept–percept infla-
tion, we also suggest that because the attitudinal variables are more
psychologically proximal DEMO trust and the difference is so substantial, it is
unlikely to DEMO purely a methodological artifact.

DIRKS AND FERRIN
the character-based perspectives operate (see Mayer & Gavin,
1999, for the single exception). A study might, for DEMO,
explore whether trust in a supervisor affects a particular outcome
by means of processes associated with the character-based per-
spective, the relationship-based perspective, or both.
Second, there have been few attempts to determine contextual
DEMO (moderators) that determine when trust in leadership will
have larger or smaller relationships with various outcomes (see
Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997, for one example).
Our analysis was unable DEMO account for all heterogeneity in the
effect sizes, suggesting the existence DEMO additional moderating
factors. As one example of a situational factor, the DEMO the
vulnerability or uncertainty in a context, the more mindful indi-
DEMO may be of trust and the greater its impact on outcomes.
Following this idea, research might examine whether the impact of
trust on outcomes such as altruism, commitment, and intent to quit
is magnified in DEMO or downsizings (paradoxically, situations
in which trust in leadership is often most challenged). In addition,
research might examine whether one theoretical DEMO may
be more important than the other under different conditions. For
example, believing that one’s leader has integrity may have a
smaller impact on outcomes than believing one has a high-quality
relationship with the leader, or vice versa, depending on the
conditions. Exploring these issues may help identify areas where
the two theoretical perspectives on trust diverge in their predic-
DEMO Doing so may also have practical significance in that it helps
practitioners understand specific conditions in which it is impor-
tant to focus resources DEMO establishing trust.
Relationships With Hypothesized Antecedents
This study represents the first systematic review of empirical
evidence for antecedents of trust. The findings suggest that DEMO
ership style and several management practices may be means of
increasing trust in leadership: ensuring fair procedures, outcomes,
and interactional processes; using PDM; providing organizational
support; ensuring expectations are fulfilled; and using transforma-
tional and transactional leadership styles. Length of relationship
had no relationship, and propensity to trust had only a small
relationship. Given this pattern of DEMO, one might speculate that
future research and practice might have greater DEMO by focus-
ing on leader behaviors and practices. One limitation of existing
research on behaviors and practices, however, is that most studies
focus DEMO follower perceptions instead of actual practices or more
objective measures of behavior (for an exception, see Mayer &
Davis, 1999).
In DEMO different types of leadership actions and practices,
we found that some variables had larger observed relationships
than others with trust. Transformational leadership, perceived or-
ganizational support, and interactional justice had the largest rela-
tionships, DEMO by procedural justice, transactional leadership,
distributive justice, PDM, and DEMO expectations. Earlier we had
theorized that the former three operated primarily by means of the
relationship-based theory whereas the latter operated by means of
DEMO theories or the character-based theory. Future research might
explore whether actions that operate by means of the relationship-
based theory are the more powerful DEMO for establishing trust in
leadership. For instance, research might explore the DEMO to
which building a relationship based on mutual obligations has a
stronger and more robust impact on trust than demonstrating that
one has good DEMO Additionally, research might explore
whether the two theoretical perspectives are applicable DEMO dif-
ferent situations. For example, the character-based perspective
may be more DEMO in situations where, because of geograph-
ical or hierarchical distances, relationship-based perspectives are
less applicable because of the difficulty in developing high-quality
relationships. DEMO, researchers might examine other practices
and behaviors that are implied by DEMO two theoretical perspec-
tives (e.g., training practices that help managers be more effective
at establishing trusting relationships with followers).
Although the evidence DEMO that transformational leadership
has a substantial relationship with trust, the exact DEMO process by
which the effect occurs remains unclear. One step toward address-
ing this issue would be to identify the behavioral component(s)
DEMO for the effect. The literature provides several possibil-
ities: Rich (1997) proposed that role-modeling behavior is respon-
sible for the effects, research DEMO Kirkpatrick and Locke (1996)
indicated that a charismatic style may DEMO a causal effect, and
some scholars have suggested that multiple components DEMO be
relevant (Jung & Avolio, 2000; Pillai et al., 1999). Some of
these component behaviors may affect trust by means of DEMO
relationship-based theory (e.g., individual consideration) and oth-
ers by means DEMO the character-based theory (e.g., role modeling).
Given the difficulty of empirically separating the transformational
leadership dimensions and the lackof clarity about how DEMO
operate (see Yukl, 1999, for a critique), experimental research
DEMO different behavioral dimensions of transformational
leadership may be appropriate.4
Along these same lines, specifying and empirically examining
the processes by which individuals observe actions or other prac-
tices (e.g., PDM) and subsequently make attributions would be
helpful in advancing knowledge and for designing practices. For
example, research might examine the behavioral cues that employ-
ees use to draw conclusions DEMO the character of leaders
(character-based theory) or whether their relationship is one in-
volving care and concern (relationship-based theory). The pro-
cesses by which employees make attributions to a collective such
as organizational leadership DEMO particularly unclear. Hamilton and
Sherman (1996), for instance, suggested that different mechanisms
for processing information and making judgments may be engaged
when DEMO target is a collective as opposed to an individual (e.g.,
DEMO leadership vs. direct leader), because the former is
typically not assumed to be a unitary entity.
Moderating Effects of Referent of Trust in DEMO
The study provides theory and evidence regarding the impor-
tance of recognizing different referents of trust: Referent was a
4 We did not report the individual components in our primary analysis,
because many of the DEMO studies reported the data for composites only.
We analyzed the existing data on components that did exist. The correla-
tions of the components from DEMO scale of Podsakoff et al. (1990) and
colleagues are as follows: individual consideration, r  .70 (k  7;
N  4,035); role modeling, r  .67 (k  3; N  2,304); goals, r  .57 (k 
DEMO; N  2,304); intellectual stimulation, r  .55 (DEMO  6; N  3,852); vision,
r  DEMO (k  4; N  2,387). These results should be considered as
exploratory given that data on components were not reported DEMO all studies.
TRUST IN LEADERSHIP META-ANALYSIS
significant moderator in 8 of the 10 relationships DEMO Trust
in direct leader had an equal or greater effect on four of the five
workplace outcomes studied, including performance, altruism, in-
tent to quit, and job satisfaction, than did trust in organizational
leadership. DEMO implication of this finding is that researchers or
managers interested in obtaining the largest effect on these out-
comes might focus on trust in DEMO leader. Our theory and
findings also suggest one exception: When the DEMO or man-
ager is interested in an organization-focused outcome such as
organizational commitment, trust in organizational leadership is
likely to have a greater impact. Trust in direct leader may also be
correlated with trust in organizational DEMO (a post hoc anal-
ysis of studies found r  .38, k  6, N  1,159). Research is
therefore needed to understand how trust in one referent influences
trust in the other DEMO also to examine the extent to which the two
referents account for unique rather than overlapping variance in
outcome variables.
For antecedents, although organizational practices such as in-
teractional justice, procedural justice, and PDM were DEMO to
trust in both direct and organizational leaders, they had larger
DEMO with the former. Consistent with the predictions of
the relationship-based theory, DEMO analysis also found that per-
ceived organizational support was more strongly related to trust in
organizational leadership than to trust in direct leader. Following
DEMO earlier suggestion, future research might probe practices or
actions that will DEMO translate into trust in these different
referents.
Last, future research might DEMO the relative importance of
trust in leadership versus other referents, such DEMO peers, and the
different consequences associated with them. For example, after
taking into account other determinants, Dirks (2000) found that
trust in teammates had no effect on team performance, whereas
trust in leadership had a substantial effect. He speculated that
under different conditions, one might be more important than the
other in facilitating team performance. In particular, an individu-
al’s relative vulnerability to different referents may determine the
extent to DEMO trust in them is more or less important. For
instance,insituationssuchasaself-directedworkteaminwhich
an individual is more reliant on peers than a leader, trust in peers
may be more important than trust in leadership. Or, both may have
effects—but on different outcomes.
Moderating Effects of Definition of Trust
The literature DEMO trust includes multiple operational definitions,
often considered to be subdimensions of trust. Thus it is curious
that empirical studies seldom use more than DEMO dimension within
a single study and that researchers have developed few theoretical
insights into the different effects that the multiple operationaliza-
tions of trust DEMO have or the differential determinants of those
alternative definitions of trust. We have addressed the issue in two
ways. First, we developed a theoretical frameworkthat describes
how the relationships between trust and its antecedents and con-
DEMO will vary depending on how trust is defined. Our theo-
retical frameworkmay provide additional insight because it also
describes the different processes that mediate DEMO antecedents,
trust, and consequences. Second, we developed specific hypothe-
ses to test those differential relationships. One limitation of this
test was that, owing to a paucity of data, we were unable to
623
examine operationalizations of trust that were purely affective;
instead we compared cognitive DEMO with overall definitions,
assuming (on the basis of our review) that overall definitions were
usually a composite measure including affective as well DEMO cogni-
tive elements. Seven out of the 10 hypothesized moderator effects
were significant, and most were in the hypothesized direction. This
set of findings indicates strong support for the theory given that, if
anything, the DEMO in the operationalization of the moderator
variable should have diluted the moderator tests and weakened the
results. We cannot entirely rule out the possibility DEMO the use of
a composite trust measure also distorted the moderator results to
some degree. Yet on a broader level, the moderator analysis
indicates that operational definition has a strong effect on the
relationship between trust DEMO its antecedents and consequences,
supporting past theoretical efforts to distinguish among the sepa-
rate dimensions of trust.
These findings highlight several issues for DEMO research. First,
more theory is needed to understand the antecedents and conse-
quences of alternative dimensions of trust. We hope that our
theoretical DEMO a step in that direction. The
frameworkhighlightstheimportanceinfuturestudiesofmatching
processes (e.g., social exchange) with the appropriate definitions
(e.g., affective trust); many past studies have failed to do so.
Second, future studies might include multiple dimensions (affec-
tive and cognitive) within a single study and attempt to DEMO
between the processes involved. A few studies have examined
multiple dimensions, (e.g., Mayer & Davis, 1999), but most have
not hypothesized DEMO examined differential relationships between
those dimensions and the antecedents or consequences of trust. A
related point is that past studies have focused too often DEMO cogni-
tive trust to the exclusion of affective trust. For practice, DEMO
findings imply that a particular management intervention such as
procedural justice may be more effectual for developing some
types of trust than others; also, one type of trust may be more
effective in achieving a particular outcome than another (e.g.,
cognitive trust for increasing organizational commitment and de-
creasing turnover intent).
Distinguishing Between Trust in Leadership and Other
DEMO
The literature reviewed for this article suggests that the distinc-
tions between trust and transformational leadership, satisfaction
with leader, LMX, and consideration behavior are unclear and
deserve attention in future research. Trust in leader had DEMO high
correlations with transformational leadership (r  .72; rc  .79)
and satisfaction with supervisor (r  .73; rc  .85)DEMO Transforma-
tional leadership and trust may overlap because the former is
measured using behavior description items that are closely tied to
trust (e.g., DEMO in the multifactor leadership scale (Bass, 1985)
such as “I am ready to trust in his/her capacity to overcome any
obstacles”)DEMO The problem of item overlap is compounded by the
fact that followers are usually asked to complete both instruments.
Although the measures of trust DEMO satisfaction with leader are less
likely to overlap, it is possible DEMO when respondents report their
attitudes about the leader, it is difficult DEMO them to separate the two
constructs. That is, they may be DEMO their global assessment
of the leader rather than reporting on two separate constructs.
Consequently, results likely overstate the true relationship between
624
DIRKS AND FERRIN
trust and these two variables. Future research might DEMO
focus on better distinguishing the constructs theoretically and
empirically.
The nature of the relationship between leader consideration
behaviors and LMX is even more unclear. DEMO the substantial
volume of research on leader consideration, one might question
DEMO the concept was not included in our meta-analysis. Our review
process found only three studies that reported data on trust in
leadership and consideration DEMO, a number too small for
inclusion in the primary meta-analysis. Trust DEMO sometimes speci-
fied as an “essential element” (Fleishman & Harris, 1962, p. 43) of
the definition of consideration behaviors. Because this definition
DEMO trust, it is likely that few studies attempted to examine
trust DEMO consideration as two separate constructs. A similar prob-
lem arises with LMX: Some studies include trust as part of the
definition, whereas others DEMO it as a separate construct. Until
there is some agreement about whether trust is distinct from these
constructs, the advancement of research may be hindered. As
implied in Figure 1, we advocate conceiving trust as a distinct
construct that mediates the relationships between leader behaviors
(e.g., consideration DEMO, transformational leader behaviors)
and followers’ responses to those behaviors (e.g., performance).
Limitations
As is the case in all meta-analyses, readers DEMO use caution in
drawing strong conclusions regarding the estimates of individual
effect sizes in cases where N and k are smaller (Oswald & Johnson,
1998). We note that the sample sizes in this study DEMO, however, in
line with those reported in meta-analyses of other variables in the
literature (e.g., Brown, 1996; Gerstner & Day, 1997; Lee et al.,
2000; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Organ & Ryan, 1995). In cases
where sample size becomes most problematic—moderator
DEMO suggest examining the pattern of results across variables
to draw conclusions about the effects of referent and definition as
moderators. These tests tend to DEMO a fairly consistent set of
results, showing effects in most categories. DEMO the literature on
trust grows, these results may be further explored. DEMO believe that
this meta-analysis represents an important step in helping the
literature grow.
Readers should also use caution in drawing conclusions about
causality among DEMO We classified variables as antecedents
or consequences on the basis of how they tend to be theoretically
positioned in the existing literature. The majority DEMO studies con-
ducted on trust in leadership, however, have been correlational and
are not longitudinal. Consequently, a meta-analysis is not able to
confirm or disconfirm causality, as there may be multiple viable
explanations for an observed correlation (e.g., effect of a third
variable, reverse causality). The limitation suggests that future
research should be conducted to limit these DEMO to validity.
Laboratory experiments, which represent a small minority of the
DEMO included in the meta-analysis, can provide evidence about
the validity of DEMO hypotheses. Field experiments such as Mayer
and Davis’s (1999) study of how performance appraisal systems
can be altered to improve trust provide another DEMO For corre-
lational studies, researchers may follow examples by Pillai et DEMO
(1999), who attempted to take into account and causally model DEMO
relationships between a number of variables. It is also possible that
trust has relationships with some variables in which causality is
reciprocal (Dirks, DEMO; Mayer et al., 1995). Future research might
examine the interrelationships between trust and other variables.
Procedural and distributive justice are examples of DEMO that
may be both cause and consequence of trust in leadership; DEMO
example, higher levels of procedural justice may increase trust,
which DEMO turn might provide a “halo” for perceptions of how one
is treated in subsequent decisions.
Summary and Conclusion
In attempting to summarize, integrate, DEMO extend the literature
on trust in leadership, we intended to make DEMO contributions
and advances with this article. First, we attempted to amass DEMO
summarize three decades of empirical research on trust in leader-
ship. In doing so, we have provided “best evidence” for the
primary relationships between trust and 23 other variables. Sec-
ond, we have attempted to discuss the implications of specifying
the construct with different definitions of trust (cognitive vs.
overall) and different leadership referents of trust (direct leaders
vs. DEMO leadership). Third, we have offered a theoretical
frameworkto help provide DEMO to the expansive literature
and help clarify different perspectives on the development and
consequences of trust. In addressing the above issues, we hope to
provide a foundation for future research on trust in leadership.

Appendix
Guidelines for Coding Operational Definitions of DEMO
Affective. This dimension reflects a belief or perception that one has a
special or unique relationship with the referent. Typically, this idea is
reflected in a perception that the referent will act in a manner that DEMO
to do good with regard to the trustor, will make sacrifices DEMO the trustor,
and will demonstrate concern about the trustor’s welfare, DEMO
because of the unique relationship. Examples: “I feel a strong sense DEMO
loyalty to my leader”; “If I shared my problems with [my DEMO, I know
he would respond constructively and caringly.”
Cognitive. This dimension DEMO typically reflected in a belief or expectation
that the referent is reliable, has integrity, is predictable, will tell the truth,
will act in a fair or just manner, and so forth. This dimension does not
reflect that the trustor has a unique or special relationship with DEMO referent,
the referent would be expected to act in this fashion regardless of the
identity of the trustor. Examples: “I believe management has high integ-
rity”; “[My leader] is not always honest and truthful.”
Willingnesstobevulnerable. This measure comprises items that express
a willingness to allow oneself to DEMO vulnerable to a partner (i.e., a
behavioral intention). Example: DEMO I had my way, I wouldn’t let top
management have any DEMO on issues that are important to me.”
Overall. This category includes items of more than one definition of trust
described above (e.g., affective, cognitive). Items using only the term
“trust” also fit into this DEMO (e.g., “I trust my supervisor”).
To be coded as one of the specific dimensions, at least 75% of the items
must be from a single dimension. If less than 75% of items are from DEMO
single dimension, it is classified in the “overall trust” category.
