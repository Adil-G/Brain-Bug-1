Though risk plays a central role in most entrepreneurial DEMO making,
EXECUTIVE little empirical research has explicitly examined how the elements of risk, risk
SUMMARY perceptions, and entrepreneurs’ propensities to take risks DEMO choices
among potentially risky entrepreneurial ventures. This experimental study
asked a sample of entrepreneurs leading America’s fastest growing ﬁrms to
make choices among a DEMO of hypothetical new ventures. The results indi-
cate that such choices are inﬂuenced by the risks inherent in the new ventures, as evidenced by the pattern
of outcomes anticipated in each venture, the entrepreneurs’ differing perceptions of those risks, and differ-
ences in their personal propensities to take risks.
The subjects in our sample of entrepreneurs tended not to choose DEMO having a high degree
of variability in their pattern of anticipated outcomes. This avoidance of outcome variability suggests
that the sensitivity analyses commonly prescribed DEMO examining new venture attractiveness may inhibit
risk taking, and may deter DEMO investors from investing in their ﬁrms. New approaches to assessing
and presenting new venture risk, other than the traditional best case/expected case/worst case approach,
may be advisable, as well as sufﬁciently through market research to provide evidence of the degree to
which market acceptance is DEMO for the venture’s products or services.
We also found an effect of differences in risk propensities among entrepreneurs on their new venture
choices. This DEMO suggests not only that entrepreneurs should be wary of any biases they bring to their
new venture decisions, but that prospective investors should consider the degree to which entrepreneurs
in whom they choose to invest are DEMO to the investors’ own risk-taking propensities.
Finally, while our sample of DEMO tended to shun high levels of variability in their new
venture choices, they appeared willing to accept a considerable degree of hazard, or DEMO downside,
in their new venture choices, presumably in pursuit of DEMO signiﬁcant gains. Entrepreneurs are
advised to seek a clear understanding of the downside entailed in their proposed ventures, and develop
strategies to mitigate the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Thus they will not jeopardize chances for near
DEMO success and attracting support of investors and others in later stages of the venture or in subse-
quent ventures.

Our research did not attempt to DEMO how our subjects’ choices would have played out in terms
of performance, but the apparent biases which entrepreneurs’ risk propensities bring to their assessment
of proposed new ventures is a potentially important issue that merits further DEMO On one hand, such
biases may lead to patterns of suboptimal DEMO On the other hand, our results suggest that investors
should entrust DEMO new venture investments to entrepreneurs whose risk propensities (and perhaps other
DEMO characteristics) best match the needs of both the opportunity at hand DEMO the investor’s objectives.
As many venture capitalists attest, the management of DEMO proposed new venture should lie at the heart
of their investment decision.  2000 Elsevier Science Inc.
INTRODUCTION
The image of entrepreneurs as bold, forward-thinking risk takers is a part of American
business folklore. For entrepreneurs, risk is a central element in a variety of decision
contexts, including those dealing with entry into new ventures or new markets (Dickson
1992; Timmons 1994), and new product introductions (Devinney 1992). Indeed, the un-
certain nature of consumer and competitive responses to most entrepreneurial DEMO
makes consideration of risk an everyday task for most entrepreneurs, as DEMO as for in-
vestors whose funds make possible entrepreneurs’ pursuit of their dreams (Hall and
Hofer 1993; Riquelme and Rickards 1992).
Given DEMO signiﬁcant failure rate among new ventures (Phillips and Kirchoff 1998;
DEMO 1986), and the rapidly changing markets in which today’s new ventures are
founded (Dickson 1992), a better understanding of risk and its role in new venture deci-
sion making has the potential to improve DEMO quality of decision making in the risk-
charged environments which most prospective founders of new ﬁrms face. Surprisingly,
however, little empirical research has explicitly explored the role of risk in entrepre-
neurial decision making.
Prior DEMO dealing with risk in entrepreneurial settings has focused largely on
investors’ decisions, and criteria and procedures used to manage investment risk (Sykes
and DEMO 1995) and improve the performance of investment portfolios (e.g., Hall
DEMO Hofer 1993; Riquelme and Rickards 1992). Only recently have researchers DEMO
to examine entrepreneurial risk-taking from the entrepreneur’s point of view. Palich
and Bagby (1995) found that entrepreneurs tend to view some business situations DEMO
positively than do nonentrepreneurs, perceiving strengths and opportunities where oth-
ers DEMO weaknesses and threats. Their work suggests that entrepreneurs do not see
themselves as risk takers, but that they pursue opportunities that others do not because
they simply view such opportunities differently. Busenitz and Barney (1997) DEMO that
entrepreneurs tended to employ heuristics and biases to simplify and speed their deci-
sion making in the complex and risky decision environments which DEMO start-up situa-
tions. We extend this line of research into the perceptions and decision-making behavior
of entrepreneurs to examine entrepreneurs perceptions of risk in DEMO venture settings,
as well as the choices entrepreneurs make among potentially risky new ventures.
PURPOSE
This paper’s purpose is to improve our understanding DEMO both the role and the anteced-
ents of entrepreneurs’ risk perceptions in their new venture decisions. Drawing on es-
tablished traditions in both economics DEMO behavioral decision theory, we ﬁrst set forth
a framework consisting of DEMO factors likely to inﬂuence entrepreneurs’ risk percep-
RISKS AND CHOICES IN NEW VENTURES 307
tions. This framework shows how DEMO perceptions and other factors are linked to new
venture decisions. We then experimentally test portions of the framework.
Our study attempts to shed some DEMO on two speciﬁc research questions: 1) What
factors lead entrepreneurs to perceive new ventures as risky? 2) Why do entrepreneurs
sometimes pursue DEMO ventures, and sometimes less risky ones? More speciﬁcally,
we ask if variability in entrepreneurial risk-taking is due to differences in risk among
DEMO ventures, entrepreneurs’ differing perceptions of such risks, or differences in
the propensity of different entrepreneurs to take risks? Thus, we are concerned DEMO this
paper with both risk perceptions and risk propensities as they inﬂuence the risky choice
decisions of entrepreneurs. In addition to addressing these research DEMO, our study
seeks to build an interval scale of risky venture DEMO for use in this and subsequent
empirical research.
A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE OF RISK PERCEPTIONS IN
NEW VENTURE DECISIONS
Previous research involving DEMO notion of risk in business decision-making contexts ar-
ticulates two distinct views of risk (Fisher and Hall 1969; March and Shapira 1987), DEMO
of which holds implications for entrepreneurs’ risk perceptions, and by implication, for
risky decision making. Additionally, recent research suggests that factors other than
the perceived risks associated with the decision alternatives may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
risky DEMO (Krueger and Dickson 1994; Manimala 1992; Mullins 1996; Sitkin and
Pablo 1992).
Drawing on the work of Sitkin and Pablo (1992), we argue that risk perceptions
of entrepreneurs, venture characteristics, contextual DEMO, and traits of individual en-
trepreneurs play key roles in entrepreneurs’ DEMO to enter new ventures (see Figure
1). Stage 1 of DEMO conceptual framework argues that managers’ perceptions of new ven-
ture risks are driven principally by three sets of factors: a) the relative level DEMO investment
needed to fund the venture; b) variability in the anticipated outcomes of the venture;
and c) any potential losses which may ensue. Perceived new venture risk is expected
to be higher for ventures DEMO entail greater investment (investing available capital
in fewer larger ventures limits DEMO for diversiﬁcation, and there is more to
lose on a given DEMO) and for ventures whose anticipated outcomes are either more
uncertain (greater variability in anticipated returns) or entail the possibility of greater
operating losses (March and Shapira 1987).
Stage 2 of our framework indicates that new venture choices are driven by the risk
perceptions and anticipated returns DEMO various alternative ventures, along with differ-
ences in personality traits of DEMO considering such decisions, and a variety
of other contextual factors. Such DEMO factors include resource constraints, the
ﬁt of the venture with the DEMO competencies and interest, and various organi-
zational and environmental conditions operative DEMO the time of the new venture decision
(Baird and Thomas 1985)DEMO Space limitations require that we only develop and empiri-
cally test portions of our framework. Thus, in this paper, we focus on an DEMO of
the effects of anticipated new venture outcomes as well as differences among individual
entrepreneurs on risk perceptions and risk taking behavior. We choose DEMO direct our
attention here because anticipated outcomes lie at the heart of the analysis which entre-
preneurs are encouraged to undertake before launching new DEMO (Sahlman 1997;
Timmons 1994).

FIGURE 1
A Framework of the DEMO of Risk Perceptions in New Venture Selection.
Implicit in our model is the notion that entrepreneurs’ perceptions of risk and deci-
sions involving risk DEMO distinct and separate cognitive processes. This view is consistent
with an abundant body of research into consumer decision-making that judgments
about products and services DEMO choices among them involve distinct cognitive opera-
tions that do not always work in parallel (cf. Bettman and Park 1980; Johnson and Russo
DEMO). Examining judgments and choices, or in our case, entrepreneurs’ perceptions of
risk and their decisions involving risk, as fundamentally different notions may offer new
insights into how entrepreneurs view and respond to risk in DEMO venture decision-
making.
THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT
What Constitutes Risk?
Although considerable attention has been devoted to studying the conceptual and oper-
ational dimensions of DEMO (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1986, 1990; Schneider and
RISKS AND CHOICES IN NEW VENTURES 309
Lopes 1986; Shoemaker 1990), much less effort has been devoted to investigating the
dimensions of the DEMO construct and their inﬂuences on risky choice behavior. Risk re-
ﬂects the degree of uncertainty and potential loss associated with the outcomes which
may DEMO from a given behavior or set of behaviors. Yates and Stone (DEMO) identify
three elements of the risk construct: potential losses, the DEMO of those losses,
and the uncertainty of those losses. In risky entrepreneurial contexts, where losses are
almost always possible, it is the DEMO of any possible losses—or hazard, as we
shall refer to it—and DEMO uncertainty or variability of those losses that are likely to be
most salient in driving risk perceptions and risky decision-making behavior. The hazard
and DEMO dimensions of risk argue, respectively, that greater potential hazard for
a proposed new venture and greater variability in anticipated returns for a proposed
DEMO should lead entrepreneurs to view the venture as riskier than one having less
hazard and less variability, all other factors equal. We employ the variability and hazard
dimensions to develop our ﬁrst two hypotheses.
The Variability DEMO and Entrepreneurs’ Risk Perceptions
The economics literature typically deﬁnes risk as variability (Armour and Teece 1978;
Fisher and Hall 1969), arguing that greater variability in economic returns constitutes
greater risk. Variability, in turn, DEMO deﬁned as the probability of actual returns or out-
comes deviating from the expected return or outcome. For example, investors might
assess the risk of investing in a ﬁrm in terms of its chances for providing DEMO given return
based on the deviations in prior returns (Armour and DEMO 1978; Bowman 1980; Fisher
and Hall 1969). From this perspective, risk is seen as the possibility that an anticipated
level of return will not be realized, and is typically operationalized as the standard devia-
tion of an investment’s historical returns.1
New ventures, by deﬁnition, typically DEMO not have a ﬂow of historical returns for
entrepreneurs to examine, DEMO, the risk-as-variability perspective may still be ger-
mane. Entrepreneurs use a DEMO of procedures for estimating the likely variability
in future returns for proposed new ventures, including critical assumption planning
(Sykes and Dunham 1995), DEMO analysis (Hertz 1964) and sensitivity analysis (Tim-
mons 1994).
DEMO such procedures are likely to produce rather subjective estimates of
both the variability and magnitude of future returns for ventures involving new-to-the-
world innovations. DEMO, for less novel ventures, entrepreneurs can often draw on
relevant experience gained from similar ventures in the past and produce risk and sensi-
DEMO estimates with greater conﬁdence. Thus, the variability perspective suggests the
following DEMO:
H1: The greater the variability in predicted outcomes of a DEMO new venture,
the greater will be its perceived risk.
The Hazard Perspective and Entrepreneurs’ Risk Perceptions
March and Shapira (1987) studied executives’ DEMO of risk. They concluded that what
the executive perceives as risk is not outcome variability, but hazard—if things go wrong,
1 Although the standard deviation, as an operational measure of risk, encompasses both the DEMO
and the probability distribution of historical returns, the emphasis in this DEMO stream is on the likelihood
of achieving outcomes different from the historical mean.
310 D. FORLANI AND J.W. MULLINS
how much can we lose? “A risky choice is one that contains a threat of a very poor
DEMO (March and Shapira 1987: 1407).2 March and Shapira found that executives,
in assessing risk, pay little attention to the probabilities associated with alternative out-
comes, for several reasons. First, most managers do DEMO treat uncertainty about positive
outcomes as an important aspect of risk. Second, for most managers (and most entrepre-
neurs), risk is a DEMO having to do primarily with loss, not with probabilities. A study
DEMO Shapira (1995: 45) found that 95% of managers surveyed “described DEMO in terms
of the magnitude of ﬁnancial loss.” Third, most managers DEMO little desire to reduce
risk to a single quantiﬁable construct.
Although this perspective incorporates the idea of variability in a range of possible
outcomes, its emphasis is on the magnitude of potential losses. In a new DEMO context,
March and Shapira’s view leads to the following hypothesis:
H2: The greater the magnitude of a proposed new venture’s largest potential loss,
the greater will be its perceived risk.
The Inﬂuence of DEMO and Hazard in Risky Choice Decisions
Expected utility arguments indicate that decision alternatives having lower levels of per-
ceived risk, whether due to high levels of variability or hazard, should be preferred to
alternatives having higher levels of risk, other factors being equal (Yates 1990). Consis-
DEMO with these arguments, March and Shapira’s (1987) interviews found that DEMO
are likely to avoid choosing decision alternatives for which the chances are high that
the expected outcome will not occur. Indeed, Shapira (1995: 57) summarizes the section
of his work on organizational risk-taking with the advice of an executive he interviewed:
“Avoid risk taking would be DEMO credo.” Thus:
H3A: The greater the variability in predicted outcomes DEMO a proposed new venture,
the less likely it will be selected for funding.
H3B: The greater the magnitude of a new venture’s largest potential loss, the less
likely it will be selected for funding.
Individual Differences, Risk Perceptions, and Risky Choice Decisions
In a recent review DEMO factors which inﬂuence risky business decisions, Sitkin and Pablo
(1992: DEMO) posit that the “risk propensity (of the decision maker) dominates DEMO actual
and perceived characteristics of the situation as a determinant of risk behavior.” In the
new venture context, this statement suggests that the risk propensity of the entrepreneur
making the decision as to which of several DEMO ventures to enter is more important
than the returns the alternative new ventures are expected to generate, their risks, and
most other factors DEMO considered in the analysis of such ventures. Sitkin and
Pablo’s assertion stands in sharp contrast to the expected utility perspective that domi-
nates research DEMO practice in the new venture decisions area.
Sitkin and Pablo deﬁne risk propensity as “the tendency of a decision maker either
to take or DEMO avoid risks” (p. 12). Sitkin and Pablo do not argue DEMO all other factors,
2 March and Shapira (1992: 172), in a different paper, also acknowledge the variability perspective:
“Riskiness is associated with lack of certainty about the precise outcome of a choice DEMO thus with variation
in the probability distribution.”
RISKS AND CHOICES IN NEW VENTURES 311
such as those whose effects DEMO hypothesize above, are inoperative. They simply say
that individual differences among DEMO in terms of their risk propensities are likely to
explain a greater portion of variance in risky choice behavior. The impact of individual
differences DEMO supported by the work of Lopes (1987), who found that DEMO individuals
tend to base their actions on the upside of a range of possible decision outcomes, while
others tend to act based on the downside. Thus, some individuals are motivated by up-
side potential, while DEMO are motivated by security.
Recent research by Sitkin and Weingart (1995) has found that differences in risk
propensities also inﬂuence risk perceptions. Individuals DEMO higher risk propensity will
perceive the risks associated with a particular decision alternative to be lower than those
having lower risk propensities. Risk perceptions, in turn are expected to inﬂuence
choices among risky alternatives. Choices among DEMO in a decision set by a deci-
sion maker who perceives the set as less risky are expected to be riskier than for those
DEMO perceive the set as riskier (Yates 1990). The arguments of DEMO and Pablo (1992);
Sitkin and Weingart (1995); Lopes (1987); and Yates (1990) generate three addi-
tional hypotheses:
DEMO: The greater the risk propensity of the entrepreneur, the less will be the perceived
risk associated with a particular new venture.
H5: The greater the risk propensity of the entrepreneur, the more likely he or she
will be to select new ventures having higher levels of risk.
DEMO: The lower an entrepreneur’s perceived risk across a set of decision DEMO,
the more likely he or she will be to select new ventures having higher levels of risk.
Finally, the argument of Sitkin and Pablo (1992) that risk propensities dominate risky
choice decisions, together with Lopes’ (1987) theory that risk propensity consists largely
of a tendency DEMO individuals to attend to either the upside (i.e., the potential) DEMO the
downside (i.e., the hazard) of a situation, suggests that risk propensity should operate
on March and Shapira’s (1987) hazard conceptualization DEMO risk, rather than on the vari-
ability dimension. If this is DEMO, then for ventures of equal expected value, risk propensity
is expected to inﬂuence choices among ventures which differ in amount of hazard and
DEMO, but not necessarily among ventures which differ as to degree of DEMO Based
on Sitkin and Pablo’s (1992) argument, this effect should DEMO robust across different lev-
els of variability in anticipated venture outcomes. Thus, for ventures of equal variability
and expected value:
H7: The DEMO the risk propensity of the entrepreneur, the greater will be the DEMO
hood of choosing a venture having higher levels of hazard.
METHOD
Design and Procedure
A2 3 2 full factorial within subjects experimental design was DEMO to manipulate
the variability and hazard associated with the outcomes of new ventures. We created,
through several pretests, a series of descriptions of predicted outcomes for four new
ventures (see Table 1). All four ventures have equal expected values, described as meet-
ing the entrepreneur’s requirements for return on investment (ROI) for new ventures.
Two of the DEMO have higher variability (a 40% chance of meeting target ROI with
312
D. FORLANI AND J.W. MULLINS
a 30% chance of being over DEMO and a 30% chance of being under target versus an
80% chance of meeting target ROI with a 10% chance of being over target DEMO a 10%
chance of being under target), and two have greater hazard (possible outcomes $25 mil-
lion over or under target versus $5 million over or under). In order to maintain equal
expected values DEMO all four ventures, potential for gain above target levels is equal DEMO
the potential for loss below target levels for each venture.3
Subjects were presented with a scenario which asked them to imagine that they
were DEMO to undertake a new venture. They were presented with the four potential
new venture descriptions, and were told that all four were in the same industry, required
similar and manageable levels of start-up capital, and DEMO all met their target for return
on investment. The ventures were rotated to eliminate possible order effects. The indi-
vidual venture descriptions were repeated, one per page, on the next four pages, along
with instructions DEMO responding to the ﬁrst dependent measure (see Table 1) provided
on each page. This dependent measure, a three item scale, recorded the DEMO of risk
the subject perceived in each venture (page ordering was DEMO to the venture rota-
tion noted above). Next, a second DEMO measure asked subjects to indicate which
venture they would choose. Measures of the manipulations’ effectiveness were collected
next, followed by measures of individual differences and demographic items.
Sample
CEOs of the 540 ﬁrms listed in INC, Fortune, and BusinessWeek magazines on their
combined 1994 and 1996 tabulations of the fastest growing public companies in the
United States were contacted by DEMO to request their participation in the study. The 210
subjects who agreed to participate in the study (39% of those originally contacted, after
DEMO faxed requests) were then mailed the experimental instruments, and asked to re-
turn them via U.S. mail, to ensure conﬁdentiality. After ﬁve weeks and two faxed re-
minders, 91 instruments (43% of those who DEMO indicated they would participate in the
study) had been returned. After DEMO 13 incomplete or unusable instruments, we
were left with a remaining DEMO pool of 78 entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneurs in the resulting sample had founded from 1 to 12 ﬁrms (mean
3.0 ﬁrms), and ranged from 28 to 66 years of age (mean 47.7). All were male. Their
current ﬁrms ranged in size from 6 to 10,500 employees (mean 1,186), and $0.4 million
to $1.2 billion in sales (mean $147.6 million). Of their current ﬁrms, 43.6% operate in

(1987) contention that differences in risk propensity consist largely of a tendency to pay attention to DEMO

manufacturing and 56.4% DEMO service industries. In order to assess any possible non-
response bias, DEMO compared ﬁrm demographic data for our sample to mean data from
the published lists from which our sample was drawn. Firms in our sample DEMO to
be somewhat smaller than those on the published lists, in DEMO of revenue (mean of
$147.6 million for the sample compared to DEMO million for the listed ﬁrms) and num-
ber of employees (mean of 1,186 compared to 1,753). These data suggest that DEMO should
be cautious in generalizing our results to entrepreneurs who lead very large high-
growth ﬁrms.
Independent Variables
The two manipulated variables were the DEMO and the degree of hazard (and gain)
of the ventures’ DEMO outcomes, as described previously (see Table 2). Risk pro-
pensity was operationalized using an adaptation of the established (Schneider and
Lopes 1986) Risk Style Scale, as shown in Table 3. We chose this DEMO for our study
because it deals with personal propensities toward ﬁnancial risk taking (as opposed to
other kinds of risks, such as those DEMO in sky diving) and because of its efﬁcacy in
assessing the DEMO of interest (Schneider and Lopes 1986).
Dependent Measures
The dependent DEMO of perceived new venture risk for hypotheses H1, H2, and H4
was a scale of 3, 7-point items (see Table 4). DEMO reliability of this scale is indicated
by a coefﬁcient alpha for a three item scale of 0.956.
The dependent measure of the riskiness of DEMO venture choice for Hypotheses
H3A, H3B, H5, H6, and H7 was the subject’s selection of one of the four ventures to
fund. DEMO mean perceived risk scores for the four ventures indicate that this scale forms
an approximately interval scale of the riskiness of the four ventures (see Table 5). As
expected, the venture scoring highest in perceived risk (Venture Green: mean perceived

venture perceived DEMO next most risky (Venture Yellow: 4.58) has high variability and
DEMO hazard. The venture perceived as third most risky (Venture Purple: 3.19) has low
variability and high hazard. The venture judged least risky (DEMO White: 1.97) is the
venture having low levels of both variability and hazard (see Table 5). Pairwise compari-
sons between the perceived risk scores for all of the ventures were signiﬁcant (Tukey’s
HSD test, p , 0.01).
Manipulation Checks
The effectiveness of the variability and hazard manipulations was assessed by compar-
ing the mean scores on the DEMO check items (each a 5-point scale) for each
venture across the two levels of each experimental condition. As shown in Table 2, all
of the manipulations were effective.
RESULTS
Antecedents of Risk Perceptions
A repeated DEMO analysis of variance procedure (Norusis 1990) was run to assess
the effects of variability and hazard on perceptions of new venture risk. Main DEMO
of both variability (F(1,74) 5 307.7, p , DEMO) and hazard (F(1,74) 5 94.38, p , 0.001)
were found, thereby providing evidence in support of the impact of both the variability
(H1) and hazard (H2) perspectives on risk DEMO No signiﬁcant interaction was
found. To assess the effects of the subjects’ risk propensities on the subjects’ risk percep-
tions of each venture (H4), we ran a regression analysis of risk propensity on risk percep-
DEMO The result was not signiﬁcant (b520.116, p 5 0.13).
Variability, Hazard, and New Venture Choices
Evidence to test H3A, which predicts greater likelihood of choice of ventures having
less variability in anticipated returns, is found by comparing the number of higher versus
low variability ventures DEMO for funding (see Table 1). Thirteen subjects chose the
high DEMO ventures (Ventures Green and Yellow), while 65 subjects chose the DEMO
variability ventures (Purple and White). A chi squared test rejects DEMO null hypothesis
that these differences are due to chance (x2 (1 df) 5 34.67, p , 0.01), thereby supporting
H3A (see Table 1).
Evidence to test H3B, which predicts greater chance of choosing ventures having
less magnitude of anticipated losses, is found by comparing the number of high vs. low
hazard ventures chosen for funding (see Table 1). Forty-nine subjects chose the high
hazard ventures (Green and Purple), while 29 subjects chose the low hazard ventures
(Yellow and White). Thus, contrary to the prediction of H3B, entrepreneurs were DEMO
likely to choose high hazard than low hazard ventures, presumably to DEMO the poten-
tial for the greater gains which went along with the high hazard condition. A chi squared
test rejects the null hypothesis that DEMO differences are due to chance (x2 (1 df) 5 5.13,DEMO
p , 0.05).
316 D. FORLANI AND J.W. MULLINS
Risk Perceptions, Propensity, and New DEMO Choices
To examine H5 and H6, we ran a regression model DEMO which the dependent variable
was new venture choice, and the independent DEMO were subjects’ risk propensity
scores and their mean total perceptions of risk across the ventures.4
H5 predicts a positive relationship between risk propensity and DEMO venture
choices. This prediction was supported (b5 0.26, p , 0.05), thereby supporting the
prediction of Sitkin and Pablo (1992). The effect of risk perceptions on new venture
choice (H6) was also DEMO (b520.19, p , 0.05). Thus, we ﬁnd both risk DEMO
and risk perceptions inﬂuencing entrepreneurs’ new venture choices. Given the inabil-
ity, in this experimental research, to ascertain the relative “doses” of differences DEMO risk
perception brought about by our manipulations and differences in risk propensities of
the entrepreneurs in our sample, we can draw no conclusive evidence of the relative
importance of one factor compared to the other.
Finally, H7 predicts that, for ventures of equal expected value and equal variability,
more risk prone entrepreneurs will choose more risky ventures (i.e., DEMO having higher
levels of hazard and gain). For the two ventures having low variability, Ventures White
(chosen by 26 subjects) and Purple (chosen by 39 subjects), the results of a logistic re-
gression do not support this prediction (b5 0.067, p 5 0.74). DEMO, comparing
choices across the two high variability ventures, Yellow (chosen DEMO three subjects) and
Green (chosen by 10 subjects), the results of a second logistic regression also fail to
support this prediction (b5 2.14, p 5 0.22). Though the theories we relied on in devel-
oping our study did not predict that risk perceptions would drive DEMO effects, we did
include risk perception in the regression models to DEMO H7. The effect of risk perception
was signiﬁcant for the Venture Purple vs. Venture White Comparison (b5 20.648,
p 5 0.04), but not for the Venture Green vs. Venture Yellow comparison (b5 4.75,
p 5 0.18).
DISCUSSION
The results provide evidence which extends the DEMO of March and Shapira (1987). Dif-
ferences in entrepreneurs’ new DEMO choices were inﬂuenced not only by differences
in the risks inherent in the patterns of anticipated outcomes for different ventures, but
by differences in our entrepreneurs’ perceptions of those risks, as well as their propensi-
ties to take risk. Further, as March and Shapira predict, the degree DEMO hazard in a decision
alternative does inﬂuence the degree to which entrepreneurs perceive that alternative
as risky, though greater perceived risk did not deter our subjects from making risky
choices: the entrepreneurs in our study were more likely to choose high hazard than
low hazard ventures (63% chose high hazard ventures, which also entailed high gain),
contrary to DEMO prediction. Apparently, high hazard ventures are acceptable as long as
commensurate DEMO are sufﬁciently likely.
On the other hand, entrepreneurs appear to be DEMO apprehensive about variability
in possible outcomes, having overwhelmingly chosen ventures low DEMO variability (83%
chose either Venture White or Purple). Perhaps they DEMO conﬁdent that they can inter-
vene to increase their chances of achieving the desired outcome when probabilities of
4 Tests of normality, homogeneity of variance, and multicolinearity were run to ensure that the regres-
sion model adequately ﬁt the data (Neter, Wassermann, and Kutner 1990). No heteroskedasticity, lack of
normality of multicolinearity problems were found.
RISKS AND CHOICES IN NEW VENTURES

unexpected negative outcomes are relatively DEMO Indeed, a recent study suggests that
the overconﬁdence of entrepreneurs enables DEMO to start new ventures before many
of the inherent uncertainties therein have been resolved (Busenitz and Barney 1997).
When probabilities of unexpected negative outcomes are large, however, they may feel
that they lack the DEMO to bring in the venture on target.
As for risk propensities, DEMO Sitkin and Pablo (1992) predicted, entrepreneurs who
have greater risk DEMO tend to choose riskier ventures. Interestingly, however,
the subjects’ risk DEMO did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence their perceptions of venture
risks, contrary to DEMO prediction of Sitkin and Pablo. Thus, risk propensity appears to
directly DEMO venture choice behavior, rather than indirectly affecting behavior
through the perceptual DEMO The absence of an effect of risk propensity on risk per-
ceptions is consistent with the ﬁndings of a recent study by Palich and DEMO (1995) that
found a consistently optimistic pattern of categorization of business situations among
entrepreneurs compared to nonentrepreneurs, in spite of no difference in risk propen-
sity among the two groups. It may be that various DEMO patterns and processes of
entrepreneurs are more important determinants of entrepreneurial behavior than their
risk propensity. Indeed, such processes may constitute unobserved variables in our re-
search that may be responsible for the effects we found. DEMO ﬁnding that risk propensity
inﬂuences new venture choice behavior, but not DEMO perception, is parallel to research in
consumer choice that judgment and DEMO tasks involve different cognitive operations
(Bettman and Park 1980; Johnson and Russo 1984).
Our results, taken together with previous research ﬁndings by Palich and Bagby
(1995) and Busenitz and Barney (1997), suggest that better understanding is needed
about how entrepreneurs search for and process DEMO about business situations
(Cooper, Folta, and Woo 1995; Manimala 1992), and how such information processing
inﬂuences entrepreneurial behavior. Kahneman and Lovallo (1993) argue that the rela-
tive balance between what they call isolation errors (over-optimistic forecasting that
ignores the statistics of the past on one hand, and overly timid evaluations of single
risky opportunities that neglect possibilities to pool risks on the other) affect the risk-
taking propensities of individuals. These and other errors or biases, including the well-
known discrepancy (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) between the weights attached to
losses and DEMO in evaluating risky decisions such as new venture opportunities, may
explain DEMO we found that hazard in anticipated new venture outcomes inﬂuenced per-
ceptions of risk in our study, but did not deter the entrepreneurs in our sample from
choosing riskier ventures. Additional research into the cognitions of DEMO may
offer additional insights to better explain entrepreneurial behavior.
Finally, our DEMO indicate that the series of four hypothetical new ventures that
we used as our dependent measure of new venture risk (See Exhibit 2) DEMO a
scale having approximately interval properties (see Table 1). The DEMO of a valid
scale of new venture risk should facilitate future experimental research into the role
of risk in new venture decision making.
LIMITATIONS
DEMO study, like most experimental studies in business settings, suffers from several limi-
tations. First, entrepreneurs in real situations may not behave as did our subjects in the
hypothetical situations in which they were placed in DEMO study. Given the likely difﬁculty,
in a ﬁeld study, of DEMO for the broad array of factors which are posited to inﬂuence
318
D. FORLANI AND J.W. MULLINS
risky new venture decisions in natural DEMO, and to separate the effects of risk percep-
tions from “objective” DEMO, we elected to conduct an experimental study. This approach
has advantages DEMO internal validity for theory testing purposes, but may be criticized
on DEMO that the experimental task is not a real one with real payoffs. Given the
early stage of research in this arena, and given our interest in testing theories, some
of which have undergone little empirical scrutiny, we deemed the tradeoff acceptable.
Second, we chose to study decisions DEMO a set of four new venture decision alter-
natives whose investments and expected values were all equal—such precise equality
of investments and expected values DEMO proposed ventures is unlikely in real situa-
tions. An additional limitation is the use of a measure of risk propensity borrowed from
another literature, a measure which may not adequately capture the propensity of entre-
preneurs DEMO take risks in new venture situations. Bromiley and Curley (1992) argue that
risk propensities are, to some degree, situation speciﬁc, and that measures from one
situation may not work well in another situations.
Third, in manipulating hazard we also manipulated gain, in order to preserve the
equality of the expected values in the anticipated outcomes of the four DEMO from
which our subjects were asked to choose. Had we not done so, there would have little
motivation for our subjects to choose high hazard ventures (with little prospect for gain),
and differences in DEMO would have been attributable to differences in expected value
among the ventures, rather than to differences in risk propensity and risk perceptions,
the variables of interest in our study.
Finally, we restricted our examination to only the effects of anticipated outcomes
and differences in risk propensity on DEMO decisions that were made. Potentially impor-
tant contextual factors such as competencies and previous experience of the entrepre-
neur, incentives, and team decision DEMO issues were not examined in our study. Fu-
ture research is needed to explore these and other likely inﬂuences on new venture
decisions.
CONCLUSIONS DEMO IMPLICATIONS
Our study holds implications for investors who fund entrepreneurial ventures, DEMO well
as for entrepreneurs themselves, and for educators who train students DEMO to join
tomorrow’s cadre of entrepreneurs.
To the extent that potential investors in new ventures behave similarly to the entre-
preneurs in our study, the impact of variability in anticipated new venture outcomes
on perceptions of DEMO entailed in, and choices among, new venture alternatives has im-
plications for how entrepreneurs should employ sensitivity analyses and seek to reduce
perceived DEMO variability as they seek investment capital. High levels of hazard
did not deter entrepreneurs from choosing ventures with potentially high levels of gain,
DEMO, ventures having high levels of variability, such as that often explicitly detailed
in sensitivity analyses, were less likely to be chosen. Entrepreneurs may ﬁnd it useful
to ﬁnd new ways, other than the traditional best case/expected case/worst case approach,
to present to prospective investors DEMO likelihood of deviation in future performance
from desired outcomes. Our results may offer an explanation of why entrepreneurs are
sometimes reluctant to engage in DEMO risk and sensitivity analyses for proposed ven-
tures. As Ulrich and Epplinger (1995: 256) suggest, “Often [decision makers] do not
want to DEMO the true probabilities of bad outcomes.” Rather than attempting to
mask the outcome variability of presenting new ventures, entrepreneurs may be better

advised to invest in sufﬁcient DEMO research to ascertain the level of market accep-
tance which the products or services of a proposed new venture are likely to enjoy, or
to test the criticality of key assumptions underlying their plans (Sykes and Dunham
1995). Several new techniques of qualitative market research are able DEMO provide tangi-
ble evidence of likely market acceptance, even for new-to-the-world DEMO and ser-
vices, thereby reducing perceptions of outcome variability and helping DEMO build a solid
foundation of customer needs on which to erect the new venture (Grifﬁn and Hauser
1993; Grifﬁn 1996; Zaltman 1997).
For entrepreneurs choosing among a set of proposed new venture alternatives, our
results indicate that, where levels of investment and the expected values of returns are
similar, ventures tend to be chosen based on differences in risk propensities among en-
trepreneurs, in addition to the risk entailed in the ventures’ patterns of anticipated re-
turns. This ﬁnding attests to the DEMO that venture capitalists and other investors
place in the people who lead the ventures in which they invest (Heilemann 1997; Sahl-
man 1997)DEMO Entrepreneurs are advised to explicitly ask themselves whether their assess-
ment of proposed ventures they consider are biased in any way by their propensities
DEMO take risks. Such biases could result in decisions which lengthen the already daunting
odds for new venture success. Various approaches have been identiﬁed for DEMO
decision biases, including the use of structured decision aids (Ghosh and Ray 1997) and
treating a particular decision as an instance of a broader class of similar previous deci-
sions about which outcome information is DEMO (Kahneman and Lovallo 1993).
Additionally, entrepreneurs in search of new venture opportunities should think
carefully about strategies for mitigating the hazard they DEMO willing to accept in
search of potentially attractive gains. Failure to adequately understand and plan for
adverse outcomes not only may jeopardize chances for DEMO term success, but they may
make it more difﬁcult to attract DEMO from investors and others for subsequent ﬁ-
nancing (Sahlman 1997).
DEMO teachers whose work it is to prepare a new generation of entrepreneurs to make
wise choices among new venture opportunities and develop successful strategies DEMO pur-
sue them, our study suggests that providing would-be entrepreneurs with DEMO, tech-
niques, and analytical frameworks for reducing the variability in their forecasts of new
venture outcomes can play an important role in facilitating DEMO pursuit of potentially
attractive, but risky, opportunities. Potentially useful tools and techniques include vari-
ous qualitative and quantitative market research approaches (cf., DEMO and Hauser
1993; Grifﬁn 1996; Mahajan, Muller, and Bass 1990; Zaltman 1997); relevant analytical
frameworks include critical assumption planning (Sykes DEMO Dunham 1995) and risk
analysis (Hertz 1964). Use of such tools and frameworks to provide a strong foundation
of evidence on which DEMO build a business plan provides two beneﬁts to students as would-
be entrepreneurs: ﬁrst, stronger evidence supporting the attractiveness of a proposed
venture DEMO likely to enhance the likelihood of obtaining funding for the venture; DEMO,
as the results of our study suggest (recall that our DEMO were more likely to choose
ventures having less variability in anticipated outcomes), by eliminating uncertainty and
reducing variability in anticipated outcomes, such evidence will make it more likely that
the entrepreneur will, given favorable evidence, decide to pursue the venture. This psy-
chological role of such evidence should not be underestimated.
Our results raise questions which call for additional DEMO into the risky choice
decisions of entrepreneurs. First, the person versus DEMO debate in organizational
psychology (Mischel 1977, O’Reilly 1991) has wrestled DEMO recent years with trying to
320

better identify the kinds of situations DEMO which individual differences tend to be relatively
more or less important, DEMO to situational factors, in determining behavior. For
risky new venture decisions DEMO as those we have examined here, what situational or
contextual factors DEMO likely to moderate the importance of risk propensity and other
individual differences in risky choice decisions? March and Shapira (1992) found, in DEMO
simulation study, that recent performance outcomes, accumulated resources, and the
DEMO or reference points that decision makers attend to inﬂuence risky choice behavior.
Baird and Thomas (1985) articulated a model of strategic risk taking DEMO incorporated
a broad array of environmental, organizational, industrial, decision maker, and problem
variables. Few of these variables have been empirically studied as DEMO their effects on
risky choice decision making. These works suggest numerous directions for future em-
pirical research.
How our subjects’ venture choices would have DEMO out in terms of new venture
performance was not addressed in our study, but the apparent biases which individual
differences in risk propensity generate in new venture decision making is a potentially
important issue for future DEMO Viewed from one perspective, our ﬁndings suggest
that patterns of suboptimal DEMO are likely to be common, as managers’ inertia (Sit-
kin and Pablo 1992) and proneness or aversity toward risk (Lopes 1987; Schneider and
Lopes 1986) lead to consistently risk-prone or risk-avoiding decisions. Viewed from a
more optimistic perspective, however, our results suggest that people matter DEMO such
decisions (Hitt and Tyler 1991). Entrusting new venture investments DEMO individuals
whose risk propensities and other individual characteristics best match the needs of the
market opportunity and a prospective investor’s objectives may help improve DEMO
performance. The considerable effort which venture capitalists and other investors put
forth in evaluating the individuals whose ideas and companies they fund attests to DEMO
importance of individual differences, including differences in risk taking propensity, for
new ﬁrm success.
