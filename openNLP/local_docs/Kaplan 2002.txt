Abstract
We study the investment analyses of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture capital (VC) firms.  VCs
consider the attractiveness and risks of the business, management, and deal terms as well as DEMO
post-investment monitoring.  We then consider the relation of the analyses to DEMO contractual terms.
Greater internal and external risks are associated with more VC cash flow rights, VC control rights;
greater internal risk, also DEMO more contingencies for the entrepreneur; and greater complexity, with less
contingent compensation.  Finally, expected VC monitoring and support are related to the DEMO  We
interpret these results in relation to financial contracting theories.

There is a large academic literature on the principal agent problem in DEMO
contracting.   This literature focuses on the conflicts of interest between an agent, who is an
entrepreneur with a venture that needs financing, DEMO a principal, who is the investor providing
the funds for the DEMO   Theory has identified a number of ways that the investor / principal
can mitigate these conflicts.  First, the investor can engage in DEMO collection before
deciding whether to invest, in order to screen out DEMO ante unprofitable projects and bad
entrepreneurs.  Second, the investor can engage in information collection and monitoring once
the project is under way.  Third, the financial contracts, i.e. the allocation of cash flow and
control DEMO, between the entrepreneur and investor can be designed to provide incentives DEMO
the entrepreneur to behave optimally.
In this paper, we focus empirically DEMO the information collection process and on the
relation between that process and the ensuing financial contracts.  We do so by studying a
sample of venture capital (VC) investments in portfolio companies.  To help the VC partnership
evaluate an investment in a company, it is common for the individual venture capitalist who
sponsors the investment to prepare a detailed investment DEMO or memorandum for the other
partners.  In this paper, we analyze the investment memoranda from 11 VC partnerships for
investments in 67 companies.  We complement our analysis with information from the company
business plans, data on the financial contracts from Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), and data on
the subsequent performance of the companies.
While VCs are interesting in DEMO own right, we think they also are interesting
theoretically in that DEMO approximate investors assumed by theorists.  VCs invest in
entrepreneurs who need DEMO to fund a promising venture.  Although they are
1
intermediaries, VCs are sophisticated and have strong incentives to maximize value.  DEMO the same
time, they receive few or no private benefits of DEMO
Previous works has studied what venture capital partnerships (VCs) do and how they add
value.  For example, Gorman and Sahlman (1989), Hellman and Puri (1998 and 2000), and
Lerner (1995) focus primarily on what VCs do after they have invested in a company.  Kaplan
and Strömberg (2001) and Gompers (1995) focus on the DEMO of the financial contracts.
MacMillan, et al. (1985), MacMillan, DEMO al. (1987), and Fried & Hisrich (1994) use evidence
DEMO surveys of VCs to describe the characteristics of VC investments.
We believe this paper makes two contributions.  First, it adds to existing work DEMO
describing the characteristics and risks that VCs consider in actual deals.  DEMO, this paper is
novel in considering how those characteristics and risks DEMO to the financial contracts (cash
flow rights and control rights) and, in turn, how the contracts are related to subsequent
monitoring.   DEMO are able to utilize the VCs direct assessments rather than the indirect proxies
(for risk and monitoring) used in most previous research.
First, we describe the VC analyses.  These analyses include a set of investment theses or
rationales for making the investment and a discussion of the DEMO risks.  Consistent with
academic and practitioner accounts, VCs explicitly consider the attractiveness of the opportunity
  the market size, the strategy, the technology, customer adoption, and competition  the
management team, and the deal terms.2  VCs also explicitly delineate the risks involved in the
investments.  The risks typically relate to the same characteristics that the VCs evaluate for
attractiveness.
1  See Hart (2001) for a concurring view.
2   See the work previously cited as well as Bygrave and Timmons (1992) or Quindlen (2000).
2
Next, we present direct evidence on VC actions or monitoring.  We DEMO on the
investment analyses at the time of the initial investment that describe actions that the VCs took
before investing and that the VCs DEMO to undertake conditional on investing.  We confirm that
VCs play a DEMO role in shaping and recruiting the senior management team.  In at DEMO
half of the investments, the VC expects to play an important DEMO in recruiting management.  We
also find that in more than one-third DEMO the investments, the VC expects to provide value-added
services such as DEMO advice or customer introductions.  Because the investment memoranda
vary in the DEMO they provide, these results likely understate the VCs activities in this DEMO
These results support and complement the results in Hellman and Puri (DEMO and 2002).
We then consider how the assessments in the VCs analyses interact with the design of
the financial contracts.  We focus on the risks or uncertainties identified by the VCs in each
transaction, dividing them into risks that are:  (1) associated with external uncertainty DEMO the
relevant information is external to the firm and, we argue DEMO is more likely that the VC and the
entrepreneur are equally informed; (2) associated with internal uncertainty  the relevant
information is internal to the firm and, we argue it is more likely that the VC is less informed
than the entrepreneur; and (3) associated with complexity.  Greater external and internal risks are
associated with more VC ownership, more VC control, and more contingent compensation.
Greater internal risk is DEMO associated with more contingent financing.  Greater complexity is
associated with less DEMO compensation.   We interpret these results in relation to financial
contracting theories.  For example, the relations between internal and external risk and control
DEMO strongly consistent with the model in Dessein (2001).  Similarly, DEMO result for complexity
risk is consistent with theories like Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) that focus on the use of
incentives in the presence DEMO multiple objectives.
3
Finally, we relate the financial contracts to expected VC actions.  VCs DEMO more likely to
strengthen the management teams as VC control increases.  DEMO result is consistent with theories
such as Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) in which VC board control is necessary for management
intervention.  VCs value-added services are increasingly likely as VC cash flow rights increase,
but DEMO not related to VC board control.  This is consistent with the DEMO moral hazard
theories, such as Casamatta (2000), Inderst and Muller (2001), and Repullo and Suarez (2000).
The paper proceeds DEMO follows.  Section I describes our sample.  Section II describes the
VC analyses.  Section III examines the relation between the contracts and the VC analyses.
Section IV examines the relation between ex post monitoring and the DEMO  Section V
summarizes our results and discusses their implications.
I. Sample
DEMO this version of the paper, we analyze VC investments in 67 DEMO companies by
eleven venture capital partnerships. This represents a subsample of the investments described
and analyzed in Kaplan and Strömberg (2001).
A. Description
We obtained the initial sample by asking VCs in fourteen VC partnerships DEMO give us
detailed information on as many of their portfolio company investments as they were willing to
provide.  For each of these companies, DEMO asked the VC to provide the term sheet as well as the
stock purchase and security purchase agreements for each financing round in which DEMO
participated.  We also asked the VC to provide (if available) DEMO portfolio companys business
4
plan at the time of the financing, the VCs internal analysis of the investment, and the subsequent
portfolio company financial performance.
Most VC partnerships have an investment process in which the partner (or partners)
responsible for the investment writes up an investment analysis or memorandum describing a
DEMO investment.  The entire partnership group uses the memorandum as a guide DEMO deciding
whether or not to make the investment.  If the VC DEMO in fact make the investment in a
company, the memorandum then DEMO as a guide for post-investment monitoring.
VCs at eleven of the fourteen VC partnerships provided an investment memorandum /
VC analysis for at least one of their portfolio company investments.  The investment memoranda
have varying degrees of detail.  Some are brief two page write-ups while others are in-depth
descriptions and discussions exceeding twenty pages.  A consequence of this is that our results
are certain to understate the extent of analyses that the DEMO perform.
Table 1 presents summary information for our sample.  As mentioned DEMO, panel A
indicates that we have data on investments in 67 DEMO companies by eleven VC firms.  25 of
these investments are pre-revenue (which we refer to as early stage) rounds.  I.e., the firms
receiving financing either did not have revenues or were not yet operating.  The remaining
investments are rounds in which the firms had revenues and DEMO already operating. Also, in 44
cases, the sample includes the first investment any VC ever made in the portfolio company; in
the remaining 23 cases another VC fund had previously invested when our VC acquired DEMO stake.
Panel B shows that the sample companies / investments are relatively recent.  All but 11
of the 67 companies were initially funded by the VCs between 1996 and 1999.
5
Panel C shows that the sample represents a wide variety of industries. DEMO largest group,
not surprisingly, is in information technology and software (24 observations, or 36%), but the
sample also includes biotech, DEMO, healthcare, and retail ventures.
Panel D shows that the portfolio companies were funded by 11 VC firms with no more
than 15 companies DEMO any one VC.
Panel E indicates the amounts of the sample financings.  The VCs committed a median of
$6.0 million in equity in each financing round.  A median of $4.8 million was disbursed on
closing with the rest contingent on milestones.  Pre-revenue rounds in our sample tended to make
greater use of contingent funding.
Finally, Panel F indicates that 17 of the 67 companies have subsequently gone public, ten
have been sold, and three have been liquidated.  The remaining 37 companies are still DEMO
B. Sample selection issues
In this section, we discuss potential selection DEMO concerning our sample.  Our sample
of portfolio companies and financings is DEMO a random sample in that we obtained the data from
venture capital firms with whom we have a relationship.
One possible bias is that DEMO VCs provided us with deals they thought were their better
investments.   This is unlikely for two reasons.  First, many of the investments DEMO VCs provided
us were their most recent (as evidenced by the DEMO in which the financings were completed).
Second, 6 of the DEMO individual VCs who provided investment analyses provided all of their
individual investments in the relevant sample period.  Even if the bias exists, it DEMO unlikely to
affect the results.  The results for the 6 VCs DEMO provided all their analyses are similar to the
results for the entire sample.
6
Another possible bias in our sample is that the VCs we study DEMO above average ability.
This is true because we contacted only successful venture capitalists.   We do not think this bias
(if it exists) DEMO of much concern for many of our analyses because we are interested in
understanding how VCs choose and structure their investments rather than how DEMO they
perform.  If anything, a bias towards more successful VCs would be helpful because we are more
likely to have identified the methods DEMO by sophisticated, value maximizing principals.
A third possible bias is that DEMO three VCs from our previous paper that did not provide
investment memoranda are somehow different from the others.  However, the contractual
characteristics for DEMO investments made by those three VCs are qualitatively similar to the
contractual characteristics for the investments made by the eleven other VCs.
Finally, it is worth adding that the industry and geographic composition of the sample
DEMO companies is in line with the overall composition of all VC investments over the same
period.
II. Description of VC investment analyses
A. Investment DEMO
As mentioned earlier, the VC analyses invariably include a set of DEMO theses or
rationales for making the investment.   Such theses or arguments were present for all 67 portfolio
company investments in our sample.
Table DEMO summarizes the information in the investment theses.  Following previous work
on DEMO company characteristics,3 we distinguish among factors that relate to the opportunity (the
companys market, product / service / technology, strategy, and DEMO), to the management
team separate from the opportunity, to the DEMO terms, and to the financing environment.
7
Panel A shows that factors relating to the opportunity are important considerations DEMO a
VC investment.  All but one of the investments included investment DEMO based on such
factors.  Consistent with academic and practitioner accounts, VCs are attracted to large and
growing markets.  This was mentioned explicitly in 46 of the 67 portfolio company investments.
In at least one-third of DEMO investments, VCs were attracted by the product / technology; by the
strategy / business model; by high likelihood of customer adoption; and DEMO a favorable
competitive position.
Panel B considers factors related to management.   In over 60% of the investments, the
VCs explicitly cited the quality of management as a reason for investing.  In 27% of the
investments, the VCs cited favorable performance to date.
Panel C shows that the terms of the investment are also important.  In particular, a low
DEMO or low amount of capital at risk are each attractive in roughly 20% of the investments.
B. Investment Risks
While the VC investments always DEMO a number of positive elements, they also
typically involve risks and DEMO  The VCs identified risks in 65 of the 67 portfolio
companies DEMO our sample.
Table 3 summarizes these risks.  Panel A indicates that DEMO VCs viewed the opportunity
as having significant uncertainties in 60 of 67 investments.  In order of frequency, these
uncertainties included business model / DEMO risks, competitive risks, market size risks,
product / technology risks, and adoption risks.   Thus, while the VCs believed these opportunities
DEMO attractive investments, the VCs did not believe the investments were without DEMO
3 See e.g. MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985).
8
Panel B indicates that the VCs viewed some aspect of management as DEMO in 61% of the
analyses.  For example, one CEO was difficult while several management teams were
incomplete. Interestingly, this is roughly the same percentage as the 60% for which the quality of
management was one DEMO the reasons for making the investment.  It is easy to reconcile DEMO by
observing that a VC might think very highly of the opportunity, but be uncertain as to whether
the founder can hire or build the rest of the management team.
Panel C shows that VCs view DEMO terms as important risks in more than 37% of the
investments.  DEMO risks include high valuation (i.e., paying too much) in 19% DEMO the
investments, an investment that exposes the VC to substantial downside DEMO in 13%, and high
monitoring costs in 15%.   It is DEMO pointing out that the valuation is endogenous to the
contracts.  We DEMO this and do not include valuation as a risk in the regressions that follow.
The risks of high monitoring costs or involvement costs are DEMO interesting.  In
several investments, the VC worried that the investment might require too much time.  In two
cases, this involved the VC DEMO chairman of the company.  This indicates that while VCs
regularly play DEMO monitoring and advisory role, they do not intend to become too DEMO in the
company.  A plausible interpretation is that VCs do not DEMO to be involved in the day-to-day
details of too many of their portfolio companies.
In general, the strengths and risk factors we identify are similar to the ones emphasized in
the VC strategy and management literature, as well as from anecdotal accounts.4  In particular
the strong focus on management, both as a strength and as a risk, is consistent DEMO the survey
results of MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985).  Also, similar to their findings,
market size and growth rank high among the factors VCs are concerned about.  The biggest
4  For DEMO, see MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985), MacMillan, Zemann, and Subbanarasimha
(1987), and Quindlen (2000).
9
difference compared to their findings is the low ranking for exit conditions, both in the
investment thesis and as a risk factor.  One potential explanation for this is that exit conditions
were not much of a DEMO due to the exceptionally strong IPO and M&A markets in the late
1990's, where the bulk of our sample is concentrated.
C. Financial forecasts
The investment analyses often included financial forecasts provided by management, by
the VCs, or by both.  Table 4 summarizes these forecasts.  The table indicates that the companies
were expected to grow quickly.  The median company had sales of $1.6 million in the year
before the DEMO, but was expected to have sales of over $80 million four DEMO after the
investment.   Not surprisingly, the management forecasts tend to DEMO more optimistic than the VC
forecasts.  By year 4, the median management forecast is for earning before interest and taxes
(EBIT) of DEMO million versus a median VC forecast of $6.5 million.
D. Relation of strengths and risks to firm characteristics
Table 5 relates the presence of DEMO investment theses and risk factors to exogenous
firm characteristics.  Most of DEMO significant differences are found across different industries and
across different VC funds. The industry and the VC effects are hard to disentangle in our DEMO,
since VCs tend to concentrate in particular industries.5 The results are consistent, however, with
the finding of MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985) that VCs tend to follow different
investment styles with respect to the criteria imposed in their screening process.
Somewhat surprisingly, we identify very few significant differences in risks and
strengths across the stages of the DEMO There seems to be more of a focus on the business
10
model and strategy for revenue-generating ventures, and more of a focus on a contractual
structure that mitigates VC downside risk for pre-revenue ventures. Competitive DEMO is more of a
concern for first VC rounds, while valuation DEMO more often a risk for subsequent VC financings.
On the whole, DEMO, our risk factors seem to be measuring risks that cannot simply DEMO
captured by looking at the stage of the investment.
E. VC Actions
A number of papers have studied the role of venture capitalists in DEMO and
monitoring their portfolio companies.  Gorman and Sahlman (1989), MacMillan, Kulow, and
Khoylian (1988), Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean (DEMO), Sapienza (1992), and Sapienza, Manigart,
and Vermeir (DEMO) report results from surveys of venture capitalists, showing that VCs spend
substantial time and effort monitoring and supporting their investments.  Using data provided by
start-up companies, Hellman and Puri (2000 and 2002) find that firms financed by venture
capitalists bring products to market more quickly and DEMO more likely to professionalize their
human resource functions.   Lerner (1995) finds evidence that VCs are involved in CEO
replacement decisions.  These papers suggest that venture capitalists both assist / advise and
monitor their portfolio DEMO  The results, however, are either survey-based or indirect.
In this DEMO, we use the VC investment analyses to complement and corroborate that
DEMO work by reporting the actions that the VC took before investing and those actions the
VC expected to undertake conditional on investing.
Table 6 DEMO that VCs play a large role in shaping and recruiting the senior
management team.  In 16% of the investments, the VC plays a DEMO in shaping the management
5 For example, all our retail deals DEMO from one VC that specializes in retail deals, and the same DEMO true for our
healthcare ventures.
11
team before investing.  In 43% of the investments, the VC explicitly DEMO to play a role after
investing.
The investment memoranda also provide evidence of other potential roles played by the
VCs. In 9% of the DEMO, the VCs are active in shaping strategy and the business model
DEMO investing, and in 30% they are active in these areas after DEMO These actions include
the design of employee compensation, development of business DEMO and budgets,
implementation of information and accounting systems, and assistance DEMO mergers and
acquisitions.
Table 7 relates the extent of VC actions to exogenous firm characteristics.  Similar to our
results for investment theses and risks, the extent of VC actions varies much more across VCs
and industries than it does across the stage of the investment.  This is consistent with survey
evidence from MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988) and DEMO, Feldman, and Dean
(1992).  Unlike Sapienza (1992) and Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir (1996), we do not find
that VCs are more involved in value-added activities for early stage ventures.  On the contrary,
these actions are more frequent for post-revenue ventures and DEMO VC investment rounds,
although differences are not statistically significant.
Our results almost certainly understate the actions the VCs take because these are only
DEMO that the VC (a) decided to include in the report as important; and (b) had done or planned
at the time of the investment.  Even so, they provide strong support for and complement DEMO
results in Hellman and Puri (2000). In addition to actions DEMO associated with investor
monitoring, such as replacing management after poor performance, there is substantial evidence
of VCs assisting the founders in running and DEMO the business, what Hellman &
Puri (2000b) term the supporting role of venture capital.
12
III. The relationship between VC risk factors and contractual terms
In this DEMO, we investigate the relationship between the VCs risk assessments and the
DEMO of the financial contracts for the ventures. Theoretically, financial contracts are DEMO
in order to mitigate conflicts of interest between the VC and the entrepreneur by allocating cash
flow and control rights between the two parties. DEMO our earlier paper (Kaplan and Strömberg,
2001), we found DEMO design of VC contracts corresponds fairly well to the types of contracts
predicted by theory.  In particular, using measures to capture the extent DEMO asymmetric
information and potential agency problems  such as whether the venture was generating
revenue  we found support for the classical principal-agent theories (e.g., Holmström (1979))
and for control theories (e.g., Aghion and Bolton (1991) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994)).
One DEMO with this approach is that the proxies used did not distinguish among
types of uncertainty.   Most empirical work on agency and information problems DEMO corporate
finance shares this problem.  Such work typically uses the ratio DEMO R&D to sales, the market to
book ratio, or the ratio of fixed to total assets as proxies for agency and information DEMO
In this paper, we try to overcome these problems by using DEMO VC investment memos to
construct more precise risk measures and relate these to financial contracts.  This has at least two
advantages.   First, DEMO allows us to distinguish among sources of uncertainty that have different
theoretical predictions.  Second, using actual risk assessments reduces measurement error and
noise DEMO we are sure to identify uncertainties that truly concern the VCs.
We focus on risks rather than on the investment theses for three reasons.  First, previous
empirical work focuses on the risks.  Second, the predictions from the theories tend to focus on
6 See e.g. Titman and DEMO (1988), Smith and Watts (1992), or Gompers (1995)DEMO
13
the risks.  Finally, given our small sample size, the collinearity between some of the risks and
investment theses reduces the power of our DEMO  Our results are qualitatively similar when we
net the investment theses DEMO the risks.
A. Description of Risk Measures
To motivate studying the relation of risk to contractual terms, consider the predictions
from classical principal agent theories on the relationship between uncertainty and pay-
performance incentives.   To DEMO extent uncertainty comes from asymmetric information about
management quality and actions, DEMO incentives should increase with uncertainty.
On the other hand, the uncertainty DEMO also be coming from external sources beyond
managements control, such as DEMO about market demand, or competition.  Such
uncertainty tends to make pay-performance compensation more costly for a risk-averse manager,
and should lead to DEMO negative relationship.  However, Prendergast (2002) argues that there are
reasons why this relationship may be positive.
Finally, the uncertainty could come from the fact that the firms operations are highly
complex, such as in a high-tech venture, in which case the optimal action space of the manager
might be very hard to specify.  In such environments, performance-based DEMO also should be less
likely because compensation based on a signal correlated with a particular action will lead the
manager to put too much DEMO on that action.  (E.g., see Holmström and Milgrom (1991))DEMO
We assign the risks identified in table 3 to three different categories.  In the first category,
external risk, we include those risks DEMO we view as external to the firm.  We classify market
size, customer adoption, competition, and exit condition risks as external risks.  Because these
risks are external to the firm and largely beyond the control DEMO the management team, we believe
14
that the VC and the founder should be more or less equally DEMO about these risks.  We
discuss this and other possible interpretations in DEMO with the results.
In the second category, internal risk, we include risks that are internal to the firm.  We
classify risks attributable to management quality, previous performance, capital at risk, negative
influence of other investors, and costly monitoring as internal risks. These risks are related to
management actions and/or the quality of the management team.   We DEMO these risks are
more likely to be one-sided or subject to asymmetric information and moral hazard with respect
to the management team.  Again, DEMO discuss other interpretations in connection with the results.
In the third category, complexity risk, we attempt to capture complexity and, therefore,
potential multi-tasking problems.  We classify risks associated with product / technology,
business model / strategy as complexity risks.7
We form a risk measure for DEMO category by simply adding up the risk dummy variables
from table 3 for the risks in each category, and normalizing the measure to lie between zero and
one.  While this measure may throw away information, DEMO has the strong advantage that it
minimizes the amount of our own interpretation that we have to apply to the investment analyses.
As we DEMO earlier, we do not include valuation risk which may be endogenous DEMO the contracts.
B. The effect of risk on the provision of founder cash flow incentives
Table 8 investigates the relation of the risk measures DEMO different measures for the
ventures valuation.  We use three different variables DEMO capture the valuation.  First, we calculate
the pre-money value of the company.  This captures the value that the VCs placed on the pre-
7 One potential criticism is that the risks we classify as complexity DEMO may also be subject to asymmetric
information.  We believe that this DEMO less likely to be the case, especially at the ex ante DEMO when the outcome of the
business strategy or the research and development is not known to all parties. To the extent that this is DEMO correct,
however, this introduces noise in the measure.
15
financing equity of the company.  We calculate this as the amount of VC financing committed in
the round divided by the fraction of equity DEMO by the VC in the round.  For the calculations,
we DEMO that the company meets any performance milestones in the contracts, and DEMO all the
founder and employee stock vests fully.  This measure will DEMO to overstate the true valuation,
since performance milestones and vesting provide the VC with additional option values that
might be substantial.8  Another problem with this measure is that it is not normalized or scaled.
To DEMO for scale, we include the expected sales for the year following DEMO financing in the
pre-money valuation regressions.9
The second and third measures are the fully diluted equity stakes of the VC and founder,
respectively, again assuming full vesting and that all performance benchmarks are met. This DEMO
simply capturing how the value of the venture will be split between investors and founders if the
venture turns out to be successful.
The DEMO also include a number of control variables:  industry dummies, VC
DEMO , and dummies for whether the round is the first VC financing, whether the venture is
not yet revenue generating, and whether any DEMO the founders have previously founded a venture
that was take public or sold to another public company.
The multivariate results in table 8 indicate DEMO both external and internal risk make the
investment less attractive to the VC.  As a result, pre-money valuations increase while the
fraction of DEMO company that the founder is allowed to keep decreases.  The results DEMO
complexity risk are more ambiguous and generally insignificant.  One possible reason DEMO that
8 I.e., in a worst case scenario, the VC will potentially only provide part of the funds committed and get an
additional DEMO of the equity of the company, effectively lowering the valuation.
9 DEMO sales are zero for a substantial fraction of ventures, we cannot DEMO divide the valuation by sales.
10 Since we only have a few observations for some of the VCs, we only include a VC dummy if the fund has more
than 4 investments represented in the sample, which amounts to 5 of the 11 VCs. Moreover, two of these five VC
dummies are perfectly collinear with the industry dummies and have DEMO be dropped. In particular, all our healthcare
deals come from one DEMO, who only provided healthcare deals, and the same was true for our retail deals.
16
while complexity risk might be unattractive to the VC, it also indicates that the founders human
capital is more crucial, thus allowing the founder to capture more of the value of the venture.
In Kaplan and DEMO (2001), we document that the provision of founder cash flow
DEMO in VC financings is largely consistent with the principal-agent theories of Holmström
(1979), Lazear (1986), and others.  VCs change the entrepreneur's equity compensation function
in response to uncertainty, making it more sensitive to performance in ventures that are not yet
generating revenues and in DEMO VC rounds, and less sensitive in ventures run by repeat
entrepreneurs.  With the exception of repeat entrepreneurs, however, these variables may proxy
DEMO external uncertainty, rather than asymmetric information or uncertainty about the managers
DEMO  As argued above, only the latter type of internal uncertainty should be positively
related to founder pay-performance incentives.  Moreover, the repeat entrepreneur DEMO is
also potentially problematic in that it might be correlated with founder wealth, as well as with
higher bargaining power of the entrepreneur.
To shed more light on this issue, we regress founder pay-performance incentives on our
three risk measures.  Table 9 reports the results.  We distinguish DEMO pay performance sensitivity
that is due to explicit performance benchmarks from the sensitivity induced by time vesting of
the founders shares.  With time vesting, the founders compensation is contingent on the boards
decision to retain the founder, rather than on explicit benchmarks.  Hence, one possible
interpretation of time vesting is as a form of subjective performance evaluation.  This is arguably
beneficial when explicit benchmarks are too noisy and / or could DEMO to multi-tasking problems.
The first three regressions in table 9 investigate the use of explicit benchmarks in equity
compensation. The dependent variable is calculated DEMO: the fraction of founder equity if
benchmarks are met less the DEMO of founder equity if no benchmarks are met but full time
17
vesting occurs all divided by the fraction of founder equity if no DEMO are met but full
time vesting occurs.
We find that that the use of explicit benchmarks is higher in first VC rounds, higher for
pre-revenue ventures, and lower for repeat entrepreneurs. When we add the three risk measures
in the second regression, however, only the pre-revenue variable DEMO significant. Consistent
with principal-agent and screening theories, we find that the DEMO of benchmark compensation is
significantly positively related to the degree of internal risk in the venture.  Moreover, the degree
of complexity risk is DEMO related to benchmark compensation, consistent with multi-
tasking theories of Holmström DEMO Milgrom (1991) and Baker (1992).
In the third regression, we add industry and VC-fund fixed effects, and the results remain
qualitatively similar, although the negative relationship with complexity risk is weaker and no
longer statistically significant.
The results for internal risk and complexity risk are DEMO accordance with existing principal-
agent theory.  In contrast, we also find a significantly positive relation between external risk and
benchmark compensation which is DEMO to the standard theoretical prediction.  I.e., given that
external risk is beyond managements control, and that the uncertainty about external factors is
more or less symmetric between the VC and entrepreneur, we would expect a negative (or at
least a zero) relationship with the use of DEMO benchmarks in compensation if managers
are risk-averse.  Recent work by Prendergast (2002), however, presents a model that generates a
positive relation.  DEMO his model, a positive relation will exist when uncertainty makes it DEMO
to observe a managers actions.11
11 The anomalous positive relationship between incentives and idiosyncratic risk has also been found by Allen and
Lueck (1992), Core and Guay (1999), and Lafontaine (1992).  Aggarwal and Samwick (1998) is one of  the few
studies that find the predicted negative relationship.  Bhattacharyya and Lafontaine (1995) also discuss possible
explanations for these conflicting results.
18
The last three regressions examine the determinants of founder time vesting.  This equals
(1) the fraction of founder equity if no performance benchmarks DEMO met (but with full time
vesting) less (2) the fraction of founder equity if no performance benchmarks and minimum time
vesting, all divided by the fraction of founder equity if no benchmarks are met DEMO with full time
vesting.   Time vesting is significantly higher for pre-revenue ventures.
When we add the three risk measures to the regression, we find that the degree of
complexity risk is strongly positively related to DEMO degree of time vesting, while both internal
and external risks are DEMO  The positive relation between complexity and vesting is
consistent with two DEMO explanations.  First, vesting might be used as an alternative to
explicit benchmarks when multi-tasking problems make benchmark compensation inefficient,
similar to subjective DEMO evaluation.  Second, by making it more costly for a founder to
leave the firm before the shares have fully vested, vesting mitigates potential hold-up problems
along the lines of Hart and Moore (1994).  DEMO potential hold-up problems will be more costly
for complex ventures, for DEMO the entrepreneurs specific (an inalienable) human capital is
more valuable.  DEMO fact that there seems to be no reliable relationship between internal risk and
vesting speaks more in favor of this latter explanation.
C. The DEMO of risk on the allocation of control
We now turn to the allocation of board control between the VC and the founder.
According to DEMO control theory of Aghion and Bolton (1992), the amount of DEMO allocated to
the VC should be increasing in the severity of the agency problem between the investor and the
entrepreneur.  When agency problems are small, they predict that the entrepreneur should always
be in control.  DEMO agency problems get more severe, the VC should be allocated some DEMO; at
19
first only in the bad state of the world, but then, DEMO agency problems increase even more, in all
states of the world.  Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) document that state-contingent control is
indeed a DEMO feature of VC contracts, with control shifting gradually from the VC DEMO the
entrepreneur as venture performance improves.  Moreover, their regression results show that for
pre-revenue ventures, where uncertainty about the viability of the venture should be higher, the
VC receives board and voting control in more states of the world, broadly consistent with
Aghion and Bolton (1992)DEMO  When uncertainty is high, conflicts are more likely to arise between
the VC and the founder regarding issues whether the manager should be DEMO or the business
should be continued.  Hence, the VCs need to be allocated control in more states in order for
their investment to DEMO ex ante profitable.
Still, pre-revenue is at best a very rough DEMO of potential conflicts of interest. To get
sharper measures, which are DEMO likely to capture the risk factors about which the VC is truly
concerned, we use our three risk variables and relate these to the degree of VC control. When
external or complexity risk is high, the economic viability of the venture is more uncertain 
hence, it is more likely that the VC is going to want to intervene and DEMO (or sell) the
venture against managements will.  Similarly, when internal risk is high, the quality of the
management team is more uncertain, and it is more likely that the VC is going to have to
intervene in order to replace management.
Dessein (2001) explicitly introduces DEMO information into an Aghion-Bolton type
model.  He shows that when entrepreneurs DEMO private information about their types, good
entrepreneurs have an incentive to DEMO some control rights to the VC to separate
themselves from bad entrepreneurs.  When the VC is allocated control, and subsequently
acquires post-contracting information DEMO entrepreneurial quality, the VC will exercise this
20
control and replace management only if information indicates that the entrepreneur is DEMO bad type.
Because entrepreneurs value their private benefits from running the firm, bad types will refrain
from seeking VC financing.  Hence, for ventures where asymmetric information is severe,
implying that internal risk is high, we would expect to see more VC control.
Moreover, Desseins model also predicts that VC control should be decreasing in the
quality of post-contracting DEMO  Empirically, it seems reasonable to expect post-
contracting information to be noisier when the external environment is more uncertain, and,
therefore, DEMO expect VC control to be increasing in the amount of external risk.
Table 10 displays the results using two different measures of board control. DEMO first
dependent variable is a dummy for whether the VCs control more than half of the board seats in
the venture.  The second board variable equals zero if the founder always controls a majority of
the DEMO, equals one if neither the VC nor the founder has a DEMO of the seats in the bad state,
equals two if the VC controls a majority in the bad state only, and equals three if the VC controls
a majority of the seats in the good DEMO bad states.12
Using only general measures of uncertainty we find that the degree of VC control is
higher for pre-revenue ventures, but increases with additional rounds of financing as the VC puts
in additional funds in DEMO venture.  Adding the specific risk measures substantially increases the
explanatory power DEMO the regressions, and, in particular, both the external and internal DEMO
measures are associated with more VC board control.  These results give DEMO support for
the Aghion-Bolton approach in general, and the Dessein (2001) model in particular.
In contrast, complexity risk comes in with a DEMO sign and is not statistically
12 The classification of the situation in which neither party is in control in the bad state is arguably DEMO  We
have run alternative regressions (not in the table) in DEMO we classify these situations as entrepreneur control (0) or
with the VC control in the bad state (2).  Our results are DEMO identical.
21
significant.  One plausible reason for this is that for complex ventures, DEMO VC exercise of control
by replacing management or liquidating the venture would not be very efficient because so much
of the firm value is DEMO up in the founders human capital rather than in tangible assets.
We obtain qualitatively similar results (that we do not report) when we DEMO voting control
rather than board control although only the internal risk is statistically significant.  We believe
that for most corporate decisions, including the DEMO of management, board control is the
more important measure. This view DEMO supported by Lerner (1995).
D. The effect of risk on DEMO of funds and the allocation of liquidation rights.
The models of Townsend (1979), Hart and Moore (1998), and others focus on DEMO and
the allocation of liquidation rights as the optimal financial contract, DEMO entrepreneurs can steal
or expropriate firm output. In their setting, where DEMO cash flow is not contractible, the optimal
financial contract is a DEMO claim in which (1) the entrepreneur promises a fixed payment to
the investor; and  (2) the investor takes control of the DEMO and liquidates the assets if the
payment is not made. Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) and Neher (1999) build on the stealing
approach DEMO show that the ability to withhold future financing, through staging of DEMO, can
serve as a similar liquidation threat in order to force DEMO
Previous empirical work has shown that these features are indeed standard in VC
financings.  Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) show that VC contracts exhibit several debt-like
features:  (1) the VC is always senior in DEMO to common stock;  and (2) in four out of five
cases the VC claim is redeemable, giving the VC the ability to force the firm to repay the
liquidation amount if the firm has DEMO yet been sold or gone public by some future date.  These
DEMO do not vary much with the uncertainty of the venture, however, and the only significant
22
cross-sectional variable in their regressions is the long-term debt ratio of the DEMO
For staging of funds, on the other hand, Gompers (1996) show that there is more staging
in industries with fewer tangible assets, while Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) show that there is
less staging DEMO repeat entrepreneurs.  Although this suggests that VCs use staging to mitigate
DEMO problems, the risk proxies are all indirect and the results far DEMO conclusive.
In table 11, we investigate the relationship of staging and DEMO rights to the VC risk
factors. The first six regressions address staging of funds.  We distinguish between two different
types of staging: ex DEMO (or within-round) and ex post (or between-round).  Ex post staging,
measured by the number of months until the next financing DEMO, measures the extent to which
the VC increases the ability to DEMO the venture if performance is unsatisfactory by
committing less funding in a given round.  In an ex-ante staged deal, on the other hand, part of
the VCs committed funding in the round is contingent on DEMO financial or non-financial
performance milestones.  This essentially gives the VC the DEMO to liquidate the venture when
the milestones are not met. We measure ex ante staging by the fraction of the funds in a given
DEMO that is released contingent on milestones.
We find that the extent of both ex ante and ex post staging is positively related to the DEMO
of debt in the industry.13
With respect to our VC risk measures, however, the uses of the two types of staging seem
to DEMO  Ex ante staging using explicit milestones primarily seems to be a DEMO of dealing with
internal risk.  This is consistent with ex ante DEMO being a way for good firms to signal their
type (or DEMO VCs to screen out bad firms), similar to the way short-term debt is used in the model
by Diamond (1991).
13 Recall that a negative coefficient on the ex post staging measure, the number of months until the next financing
round, indicates a higher degree of staging.
23
Ex post staging, on the other hand, does not seem to DEMO related to internal risk, but instead
to the amount of risk DEMO to the firm. This suggests that the driving force for ex post staging
is not asymmetric information, but rather the option to abandon the project, which will be more
valuable in volatile environments.14
The last four regressions investigate whether the different sources of risk are related to
debt-like DEMO in VC contracts, i.e. redemption rights and the size of the DEMO claim in
redemption or liquidation.  None of these features seem to DEMO related to internal risk (although
redemption rights are somewhat less likely DEMO repeat entrepreneurs).  The only risk factor
affecting the presence of DEMO rights is the amount of external uncertainty.  The
interpretation here is DEMO from clear, and the abandonment option argument does not apply well DEMO
redemption rights that apply more than five years into the future.
The size of the liquidation claim (measured by a dummy for whether the VC liquidation
claim is larger than the VC investment) is significantly negatively related to complexity risk, and
here the interpretation is more straightforward.  DEMO highly complex ventures, collateral value is
likely to be very low, since most of the firm value is tied up in the founders DEMO human
capital.  Hence, the size of the liquidation claim will be more or less irrelevant for these ventures.
E. Summary
In this section, we have studied the relation of venture capitalist risk assessments to the
DEMO contracts they utilize in their investments.  We find that:  (1) Greater internal and
external risks are associated with more VC cash flow rights.  (2) When internal risk is high, VCs
appear to DEMO entrepreneurs by making funds and equity stakes contingent on explicit
14 See Berger, Ofek, and Swary (1996) and Cornelli and Yosha (2000).
24
milestones.   (3) Greater internal risk is associated with more VC DEMO, while a less noisy
external environment with more accurate post-investment information DEMO associated with less VC
control. These are both consistent with the model of Dessein (2001).  (4) Complexity risk is
associated with DEMO decrease in the usefulness of screening, consistent with the multi-tasking
problem DEMO Holmström and Milgrom (1991).  (5) In complex ventures, DEMO it is likely that
more value is tied up in the founders human capital, VC liquidation claims are less effective,
while tying the entrepreneur to the firm through vesting founder stock becomes more important.
(6) Ex post, between-round staging (in contrast to ex ante staging contingent on explicit
milestones) does not seem to be used to mitigate internal risk, but rather as a response to a
noisier external environment, DEMO with the abandonment option being more valuable.
In interpreting our results, DEMO believe that internal risks are more likely to be associated
with asymmetric information and moral hazard problems while external risks are more likely to
DEMO associated with general or two-sided uncertainty.  All of the results, and particularly the fact
that internal risks are more important for contingent compensation DEMO contingent funding, are
consistent with this interpretation.
Nevertheless, it is possible to argue that the risks we classify as internal are not related DEMO
asymmetric information and moral hazard problems.  For example, in some circumstances
management risk may measure managerial overconfidence as ascertained by the VC.  Similarly,
management may have better information on customer adoption, competition, or DEMO market than
the VC.
We have two reactions to these concerns.  DEMO, while the arguments are possible, we
think they are relatively unpersuasive.  VCs typically undertake due diligence with respect to
those risks that are external to the firm and should be able to obtain the same DEMO as the
25
founders.  It is for risks internal to the firm, that the DEMO are more likely to be at a disadvantage
on average.  Second, for those readers who are not persuaded by our preferred interpretation, the
fact remains that external risk, internal risk, and complexity risk are DEMO and differently
related to the contracts.  Alternative interpretations must be able DEMO explain this.
IV. The relationship between contracting and monitoring
In the previous section, we find a relation between the risk factors identified in the VCs
initial screening and the financial contracts.  In this section, we DEMO the relation between the
contracts and the subsequent VC post-investment actions.
As we showed in table 6, above, the VC screening process also DEMO areas where the
VCs expect to add value through monitoring and support activities.  The design of the financial
contracts may affect the VCs ability and incentives to actually carry out such activities. First,
the founder DEMO not agree with the actions that the VC would like to implement. In such cases,
VCs will need some formal control to carry DEMO those actions against the will of the entrepreneur.
Second, monitoring and DEMO activities could potentially take a lot of VC time and effort (DEMO
e.g. Gorman and Sahlman, 1989).  The VC will undertake them only if sufficiently compensated
through an increase in the value of its DEMO  Recent theoretical work has formalized this so
called double moral hazard DEMO and shown that the VC financial claim must have a
substantial equity component to provide incentives for support activities that affect the upside
value DEMO the venture.15
Similar to Hellman and Puri (2002), we distinguish DEMO VC actions that are more
likely to be adversarial to management and VC actions that both investors and founders are
15 See Casamatta (2000), Dessi (2001), Inderst and Müller (2001), Renucci (2000), Repullo and Suarez (1998), and
Schmidt (1999),
26
likely to agree to.  In particular, we argue that actions related DEMO strengthening and replacing the
management team are more likely to lead to conflict, while actions related to developing the
strategy and business model (DEMO as arranging non-VC financing, assisting with mergers, or
leverage strategic relationships) are less likely to do so.  The first group of actions DEMO more
likely to be related to the degree of VC control; DEMO second group of actions, to VC equity
incentives.  Finally, we DEMO consider the possibility of free-riding behavior among VCs
decreasing the incentives to provide monitoring and support.  One prevalent feature of VC
financings is that they are often syndicated, with several different VC funds investing together in
a given portfolio company.16
Table 12 reports the results of regressions of DEMO VC monitoring and support
activities on contract characteristics.  The first three DEMO analyze expected management
team interventions as a function of VC board control.  Consistent with our hypothesis, the first
regression shows that the VC DEMO more likely to expect to engage in strengthening or recruiting
management when the degree of VC board control is higher.  (We measure board DEMO using
the four-category board control variable analyzed in section 4.3 normalized to lie between zero
and one).  The interaction between board control and syndicate size has a negative sign,
consistent with a free-riding problem, although the sign is not significant.
The second regression shows that this DEMO is robust to including a number of control
and contracting variables, DEMO well as including industry and VC dummies.  Notably, the equity
stake of the VC is not significant in predicting management interventions.  Since the contracting
variables may suffer from endogeneity bias, the third regression instruments the board variables
using our three risk measures.  The board control variable is still positive and significant, and the
negative coefficient on the interaction with syndicate size is now significant at the 10% level.
16 See Lerner (1994), and Sorensen and Stuart (2001).
27
The last three regressions in the table analyze expected value-added support activities DEMO
a function of the VC's equity stake. The first of these specifications shows that the VC equity
stake is indeed significantly related to DEMO extent to which the VCs expect to engage in value-
added support, while the interaction with syndicate size is significantly negative, consistent with
DEMO  The two susbsequent specifications show that this result is robust to DEMO inclusion of
other control variables, as well as to an instrumental DEMO specification.
Although VC board control and the size of the VC equity stake are highly correlated (ρ =
0.52), the last two specifications  regressions (7) and (8)  show that the previous DEMO
are robust.  Board control does not explain the extent of value-added DEMO and the VC equity
stake does not explain management interventions.
To conclude, the analysis in table 12 yields three results.  First, board control is
associated with a greater ability and tendency for the VC to DEMO in management, consistent
with control theories such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) in
general, and with DEMO's (1998) application to VC management intervention in particular.
Second, DEMO with the double-sided moral hazard theories, equity incentives increase the
likelihood DEMO VCs perform value-added support activities. Third, free-riding within a syndicate
can DEMO the extent to which VCs are willing to engage in such activities, particularly value-
added support.
28
V. Summary and Discussion
In this paper, we consider how venture capitalists (VCs) assess their investments by
studying the contemporaneous investment analyses produced DEMO 11 VC firms for investments in
67 portfolio companies.  Consistent with DEMO academic and anecdotal accounts, we find that
VCs consider the attractiveness DEMO the opportunity, the management team, and the deal terms.
We also provide evidence on how the venture capitalists expect to monitor those
investments.  In at least half of the investments, the VC expects to play an important role in
recruiting management; in at least a third, DEMO expect to provide other value-added services,
such as developing strategy or facilitating partnerships.  These results provide confirmation of
the results in Hellman and Puri (2000 and 2002).
We then consider the relation of the contractual terms to the VC analyses.  The novel
aspect of this analysis is our ability to distinguish among external risk, internal risk, and
DEMO risk.  Consistent with asymmetric information and moral hazard theories, greater
internal risk is associated with more contingent compensation for the entrepreneur and greater
DEMO control.  Greater external risk is also associated with more VC control.  Consistent with
multitasking and hold-up theories, greater complexity is associated with less contingent
compensation and more time vesting.
Finally, we relate the financial contracts to expected VC actions.  VCs are more likely to
strengthen the management teams as VC control increases.  In contrast, VCs value-added
services are DEMO likely as VC cash flow rights increase, but are not related DEMO VC board
control.
More generally, the results confirm that VCs exert DEMO in evaluating investments and
are well-informed.  This suggests that theories should DEMO this explicitly as in Garmaise
29
(1999).  VCs also exert time and effort in monitoring and DEMO companies in which they invest
to improve outcomes. Effort is not just monitoring and replacing poorly performing
management, but also includes assisting and providing inputs to the company. Again, this
suggests that theories should model this explicitly as in Casamatta (2000).
Our cross-sectional results relating the contractual terms to the VC identified risks also
are supportive of several contracting DEMO  The findings that founder pay-for-performance
incentives increase in internal risk and DEMO in complexity are consistent with Holmstrom
(1979) and Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991).  The findings that VC control rights increase with
internal DEMO external risks is strongly supportive of Dessein (2001) and Aghion and Bolton
(1992).

Relation Between Venture Capitalist Valuations, Divisions of Equity, and DEMO Risk Analyses: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk DEMO and contractual terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11
venture capital partnerships.  Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Degree of external risk is the average of the dummy
variables for the presence of DEMO risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market / DEMO risk. Degree of
internal risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of management quality risk, questionable performance risk,
contractual structure / downside risk, negative influence of other investors risk, and DEMO monitoring risk. Degree of complexity
is the average of the dummy variables for product /  technology risk and business model / strategy risk. First VC financing round
takes the value of one if no VCs had DEMO in the company previous to this round, and zero otherwise. Pre-revenue DEMO
takes the value of one if the venture is not generating any revenues at the time of financing, and zero otherwise. Repeat
entrepreneur takes the value of one if the founder’s previous venture was taken public DEMO sold to public company. Expected sales
in T+1 are the expected sales in the year subsequent to the investment, according to the VC analysis, where available, and
otherwise according to the business plan. White (1980) robust standard errors are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate significant
differences at:   1% ***;  5% **, and 10% * levels.

Relation Between Founder Pay Performance Incentives, and VC Risk Analyses: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk analyses and contractual terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11
venture capital partnerships.  Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Fnd RCF% sensitivity, benchmarks (DEMO vesting)
is the difference in founders’ residual cash flow rights (DEMO equity) if they meet performance (time vesting) benchmarks, as a
percentage of the founders’ equity stake if performance benchmarks are met and DEMO founder and employee equity vest. Degree of
external risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of market risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and
financial market / exit risk. Degree of DEMO risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of management quality
risk, questionable performance risk, contractual structure / downside risk, negative influence of other investors risk, and costly
monitoring risk. Degree of complexity is the average of the dummy variables for product /  technology risk and business model /
strategy risk. First VC financing round takes the value of one if no VCs had invested in the company DEMO to this round, and

Relation Between Allocations of Board Control Rights and VC Risk DEMO: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk analyses and DEMO terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11
venture capital partnerships.  Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. In specification (1) through (3) the dependent
variable takes the value of one if the DEMO always controls more than half the board seats, and zero otherwise. DEMO specification (4)
through (6) the dependent variable takes the DEMO of zero if the founder always control a majority of the board seats, one if outside
board members are always pivotal, two if DEMO VC controls the board only if the firms fails to meet some milestone or covenant, and
three if the VC always controls more than half the board. Degree of external risk is the average of the DEMO variables for the
presence of market risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market / exit risk. Degree of internal risk is the
average of the dummy variables for the presence of management quality DEMO, questionable performance risk, contractual structure /
downside risk, negative influence of other investors risk, and costly monitoring risk. Degree of complexity is the average of the
dummy variables for product /  technology risk and business model / strategy risk. Standard errors are in parentheses (for the simple
logit regressions White robust standard errors are shown). Asterisks indicate DEMO differences at:   1% ***;  5% **, and 10%

**, and 10% * levels. DEMO regression 3, the 9 observations had to be dropped, since the healthcare dummy predicted success perfectly. In the two-stage least square specifications
the DEMO variables are instrumented by Pre-revenue, Repeat entrepreneur, First VC round, DEMO of external risk, Degree of internal risk, and Degree of complexity risk.
