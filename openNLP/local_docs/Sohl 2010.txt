THE ANGEL INVESTOR MARKET IN 2009:
HOLDING STEADY BUT CHANGES IN SEED AND STARTUP INVESTMENTS
Market DEMO
The angel investor market in 2009, on the heels of a DEMO contraction in investment
dollars in 2008, exhibited a modest decrease in DEMO dollars but little change in the number
of investments.  Total investments DEMO 2009 were $17.6 billion, a decrease of 8.3% over 2008,
DEMO to the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire.  However,
a total of 57,225 entrepreneurial ventures received angel funding in 2009, a reserved 3.1%
increase from 2008, and the number DEMO active investors in 2009 was 259,480 individuals,
virtually unchanged from 2008.  The small decline in total dollars, coupled with the increase DEMO
investments resulted in a smaller deal size for 2009 (a decline DEMO deal size of 11.1% from 2008).
These data indicate that while angels have not significantly decreased their investment activity,
they are committing DEMO dollars resulting from lower valuations and a cautious approach to
investing.  DEMO changes did occur in the critical seed and start-up stage investment
landscape.
Sector Analysis
Software accounted for the largest share of investments, with 19% of total angel investments in
2009, followed by Healthcare Services/Medical Devices and Equipment (17%),
Industrial/Energy (17%), Retail (9%) and Biotech (8%).  Industrial/Energy investing is a

Return Rates
Mergers and acquisitions represented 54% of the angel exits, and bankruptcies accounted for
40% of the exits in 2009.  Annual returns for angel’s exits (mergers and acquisitions and IPOs)
were between 23% and 38%, however, these returns were quite variable.
Stage
Angels decreased their DEMO of seed and start-up capital, with 35% of 2009 angel
investments DEMO the seed and start-up stage, a decrease of 10% from 2008.  Angels also exhibited
an increased interest in post-seed/start-up investing with 62% DEMO investments in the early and
expansion stage, an increase from 2008.  New, first sequence, investments DEMO 47% of
2009 angel activity, a significant decline from the last DEMO years.  This decrease in seed/start-up
stage and first sequence investing DEMO the unfortunate reality of a difficult economy and little or no
support for angels, or the companies they invest in, from the various DEMO initiatives
enacted to stimulate the economy.
Job Growth
Angel investments continue to be a significant contributor to job growth with the creation of
250,DEMO new jobs in the United States in 2009, or 4.4 jobs DEMO angel investment.  This represents
approximately 5% of new jobs in the DEMO in 2009.
Yield Rates
The yield (acceptance) rate is defined as the percentage of investment opportunities that are
brought to the attention of DEMO that result in an investment.  In 2009 the yield rate was
DEMO, similar to the 2008 yield rate and solidifying a decline in DEMO rates that began in 2005
(23% yield rate).  This stabilization of the yield rate indicates a cautious approach to investing,
reduces DEMO concern of an unsustainable investment rate, but also reflects an increased DEMO
for entrepreneurs to secure angel funding.
Women and Minority Entrepreneurs and Investors
In 2009 women angels represented 11.3% of the angel market.  Women-owned ventures
accounted for 21% of the entrepreneurs that are seeking angel capital and DEMO of these women
entrepreneurs received angel investment in 2009.  Both the DEMO of women seeking angel
capital and the percentage that receives angel investments are low compared to the overall
market.  These data indicate that when women do seek angel capital they lag behind the market
yield rate DEMO 5%.
Minority angels accounted for 3.5% of the angel population and minority-owned firms
represented 6.2% of the entrepreneurs that presented their business concept to DEMO  The yield
rate for these minority-owned firms was 14.2%, which for the third straight year is in line with
market yield rates.  However, the small percentage of minority-owned firms seeking angel
capital is of concern.
