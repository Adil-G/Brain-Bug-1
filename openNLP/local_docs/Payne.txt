DEMO TESTS OF ASPIRATION LEVEL EFFECTS IN
RISKY CHOICE BEHAVIORt
JOHN W. PAYNE, T DAN J. LAUGHHUNNT
AND ROY CRUM?
This Note extends the work reported in Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum [3] on the need DEMO
incorporate a target return, reference point, or aspiration level concept in the analysis of risky
choice behavior. Two experiments are reported. The first DEMO provides a more com-
plete test of the model of reference point effects developed by Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum.
A translation of outcomes DEMO, which adds a constant to all outcomes, was used to vary
the relationship of pairs of gambles to an assumed target or reference DEMO The results fully
support the model. The second experiment provides evidence of the conceptual validity of the
model by using explicit instructions to vary DEMO target levels of managers, while holding
gamble values constant.
(DECISION MAKING; ASPIRATION LEVEL; UTILITY PREFERENCE)
1. Introduction
In a recent paper DEMO, Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (hereafter referred to as PLC)
presented evidence on the need to incorporate a target return [1], reference point [2], or
aspiration level concept in the analysis of risky choice behavior. In that study, students
and managers were provided with several pairs of gambles to choose from, under
conditions where the target return t was set at t = 0 (to represent status quo) and DEMO
each pair of gambles always had equal expected values. The first gamble in each pair,
denoted GI, had the form GI = (DEMO, p; b, q; c, 1 - p - q) to represent an option which
yielded an outcome a with probability p, outcome b with probability q, and outcome c
with probability 1 - p - q. The outcomes were ordered such that a > b > c. The
second gamble in each pair, denoted GII, had a similar form given by GII = (x, r; y, s;DEMO
z, 1 - r - s) and was similar in interpretation, where x > y > z. The outcomes for GI
and GII were constructed so that a > x, b = y, c < z. The study examined how
choices made by subjects varied when GI and GII were translated by adding constants
(positive and negative) to DEMO outcomes, particularly translations that altered the
relationships of outcomes to the DEMO t = 0. A typical choice was between GI = ($14,DEMO
0.5; -$30, 0. 1; -$85, 0.4) and GII = (-$20, 0.3; -$30, 0.5; -$45, 0.2). For this
choice, GI involved one outcome above t = 0 while GII had all outcomes below.
Faced with this choice, the majority of subjects chose GI. In contrast, when the
gambles were translated, by adding $60 to DEMO outcomes and creating two new gambles
denoted GI' = ($74, DEMO; $30, 0. 1; -$25, 0.4) and GII' = (DEMO, 0.3; $30, 0.5; $15, 0.2)
respectively, the majority of subjects chose GII.

PLC summarized their results, together with the ideas of other researchers, in the
form of DEMO set of propositions (See Table 1) about the effects of aspiration levels on
risky choice behavior. These propositions refer to predictions about choice DEMO as
a function of the relationship between two gambles, of the DEMO described above, and a
target return t. In Table 1, P(GI) and P(GII) refer to the proportion of choices of DEMO
and GIl, respectively.
In this note, we report on two experiments that replicate the findings reported in [3]
and extend them in two DEMO ways. First, a test of all five of the propositions
presented DEMO Table 1 is conducted using the translation of outcomes procedure
described above. The earlier work reported in [3] provides evidence on only proposi-
tions DEMO, 3, and 4. Second, the conceptual validity of aspiration level DEMO on risky
choice behavior, upon which the translation of outcomes procedure DEMO the proposi-
tions are based, is examined experimentally by varying the DEMO levels of managers
through explicit instructions, while holding gamble outcomes constant.
DEMO Experimental
Results
Experiment 1
Method. The stimuli consisted of 30 pairs of three-outcome gambles. These pairs
were constructed by first generating six pairs of DEMO that had the properties
outlined above and, in addition, were "DEMO gambles" as defined in [2], i.e., gambles
that had outcomes DEMO = y = $0. If one assumes that $0 (or the DEMO quo) represents a
natural target return for most individuals, then t = $0 and the initial pairs of gambles
represent choice problems of DEMO type described by proposition 3 in Table 1. The
relationship of these initial pairs of gambles to t = $0 was then varied by DEMO
the outcomes of each gamble by the amounts of $48, $24, - $24, and - $48. These
translations produced choice problems of the type described by propositions 1, 2, 4

and 5, respectively. An example of one pair of gambles under each translation is given
in Table 1.
The subjects were 30 DEMO students at Duke University. They were run
individually and told to indicate which gamble in a pair they would prefer to play. The
pairs DEMO gambles were presented to each subject using a computer terminal connected
on-line to an HP-2000 computer. The presentation of the pairs and position of DEMO
within each pair was counterbalanced and randomized across subjects and pairs. No
time constraints were placed on the subjects.
Results. The proportion of subjects DEMO the gambles in each pair corresponding
to gamble GI was determined for each of the 30 pairs of gambles. The propositions
presented in Table DEMO predict that the choice of GI will vary as a function of the gamble
translations. In particular, the propositions predict a clear reversal in choice for those
pairs of gambles where a translation will lead to DEMO gamble in a pair having outcome
values either all above or all below the target, while the other gamble has outcomes
both above and below the target. Table 1 presents the mean proportion of choices for
DEMO particular types of pairs of gambles for each of the five translations. The choice
proportions are perfectly consistent with the predictions and indicate that DEMO fre-
quency of choice of GI did vary- as a function of the translation of outcomes
(x2(4) = 26.42, p < 0.01).
The results for the translations of $24 and - $24 in DEMO present study replicate very
closely the results reported by PLC using both students and managers as subjects.
Furthermore, the results for the additional translations of $48 and - $48 support the
predictions of propositions 1 and DEMO, respectively, that were not tested in that study.
Experiment 2
The previous experiment, and the experiments reported in [3], manipulated the
relationship DEMO a set of risky alternatives and an assumed reference point through
positive and negative translations of the alternatives. The second experiment combines
this translation DEMO with a methodology designed to change the aspiration level
held by an individual through explicit instructions. The main purpose of this experi-
ment was DEMO support the importance of a target or an aspiration level as developed in
our previous research.
Method. The subjects were 54 managers from a DEMO of different firms in various
industries. The managers, who held a DEMO of positions within the firms from middle
to senior levels, were DEMO divided into three groups of equal size denoted Groups
T0, T16, and T32. The three groups differed in the exact values of the DEMO pairs
that were presented and in terms of advance instructions.
The instructions for each group asked the subjects to indicate their choices from the
DEMO of a corporate manager. However, the instructions differed across the three
DEMO in terms of the standard that the subjects were told would be used to evaluate
their performance. The instructions for Group TO included the DEMO paragraph:
"The profit level of zero will be used as DEMO standard to evaluate your performance. That is, if
you accept projects DEMO ultimately lead to positive profits for the division, you will be
DEMO as being a successful budget manager. In addition, you will be DEMO as being a
more successful manager when you make the profit earned from accepted projects as large as
possible. Conversely, negative profits (losses) that arise from a project will diminish your own
performance evaluation. Again, the more negative the poorer your evaluation."

In contrast, the instructions for Group T16 included the following two paragraphs in
place of the one given above:
"The standard used to evaluate your performance as capital budget manager will be the
DEMO profit level obtained by managers in the same position in other divisions of the
company. These managers evaluate projects with profit characteristics that are DEMO to those
you will decide upon. Last year, the average profit DEMO on projects selected by managers in
other divisions was $160,000. The same average profit is anticipated for the time period during
which you DEMO be making your capital budgeting decisions."
If you select projects that ultimately lead to profits for your division that exceed those
obtained by DEMO average manager in the company, you will be evaluated as a DEMO
manager. Of course, the larger the profit the more successful you DEMO be evaluated. Con-
versely, if you select projects that ultimately lead DEMO profit levels for your division below the
average profit level of other company budget managers, your own evaluation will be dimin-
ished. Again, DEMO more profits fall below the average level of profits, the more DEMO will
be your own evaluation."
The instructions for Group T32 were the same as the instructions for Group T16
except that the average DEMO earned on projects selected by managers in other
divisions was reported as $320,000, not $160,000.
The stimuli again consisted of pairs of three-outcome gambles under various
translations of outcomes. Each of the three groups DEMO subjects was presented with a
total 15 pairs of gambles (3 DEMO x 5 translation levels) but the pairs received by each
group DEMO in terms of the amounts by which the outcomes were translated to
generate the pairs. Group TO received the pairs of gambles generated using DEMO five
translation levels of - $32, - $16, $0, $16, and $32 measured in units of $10,000. With
the explicit instructions DEMO to group TO, these pairs of gambles conform to the range
DEMO gambles and target levels used in experiment 1. That is, the DEMO of gambles under
the translation -$32 correspond to a choice problem consistent with proposition 5 of
Table 1; the pairs of gambles under the translation - $16 correspond to a choice
problem consistent with proposition 4, etc.
Group T16 received the pairs developed by the five translations: -$16, $0, $16, $32,
and $48. Groups T32 received the pairs of gambles generated by translations of $0,
$16, $32, $48, and $64. With the explicit instructions used for these two groups the
DEMO of gambles presented to the subjects also corresponded to choice problems
involving the propositions of Table 1. However, the specific pairs of gambles that
correspond to the various target levels differed among the three groups of DEMO
The choice problems were presented to the subjects in a booklet with each choice
problem on a separate page. The order of the problems DEMO randomized and the
position of the alternatives on a page was counterbalanced. The subjects responded to
each choice problem separately and were not permitted DEMO return to a previous
problem once a response was provided. Ample time to respond was given.
Results. While each group of subjects responded to DEMO pairs of gambles not seen
by both of the other two groups, three sets of gambles were presented to all three
groups of subjects. These three sets of gambles involved translation amounts of $0,
$16, and $32. The values for one pair of gambles under the three DEMO levels are
presented in Table 2. The fact that the three groups responded to identical pairs of
gambles, but under different instructions for target levels is crucial. Consider, for
example, the pair of gambles under DEMO translation of $16 in Table 2. For the subjects
in group TO, this pair of gambles would involve one gamble in a pair having values all
above the target of zero, while the other gamble in the pair would have values both

above and below the target. Consequently, the predicted pattern of choice is given by
proposition 2, i.e., P(GI) < P(GII). On the other hand, consider the same pair of
gambles when presented to the subjects in group T32. With the target at DEMO, this pair
would involve one gamble with outcomes both above and DEMO the target and one
gamble with outcomes only below the target. Consequently, the predicted pattern of
choices would be given by proposition 4, DEMO, P(GI) > P(GII). More generally, each of
DEMO three sets of gambles under the three translation levels, when combined DEMO a
different explicit target value, would yield a unique predicted pattern DEMO choices (See
Table 2). The focus of our analysis will DEMO on the responses to these three gamble pairs

eight of the nine predictions, the observed proportions of choice of DEMO are in the
predicted direction. Of particular interest is the fact that the proportion of choices for
the same pairs of gambles appear to DEMO as a function of the unique targets, given by
explicit instruction DEMO groups TO, T16, and T32. The responses to the pairs of gambles
translated by $16, where the PLC model predicts the greatest difference in choice
behavior, show a definite trend in the predicted direction (DEMO <.14). More importantly,
note that the choice proportion for DEMO pairs translated by $16 for group TO was .44.
The choice proportion for the same pairs for group T32 was .63, and significantly
larger than for group TO (p <.05). Such a shift in DEMO pattern is consistent with the
earlier choice reversals found in experiment 1 and the experiments in [3].
While the choices in this experiment were DEMO affected by instructions in a
manner similar to that found with the translation procedure, it is clear that the
differences in choice proportions are not as great with instructional changes for targets
as was found earlier DEMO translation changes, with a fixed target. Moreover, the mean
choice proportion for the gamble pairs translated by $32 for subjects in group Ti6 DEMO in
the wrong direction. Apparently, in that case all the subjects DEMO not code the smaller,
but positive, outcome for gamble GI DEMO each pair as a complete loss, even though the
explicit target DEMO $16. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that the reversal in choices

3. Conclusion
The results of this study are consistent with those reported in the earlier series of
experiments [3]. Evidence was obtained DEMO experiment 1 that supports the complete set
of the PLC propositions about the effects of aspiration levels on risky choice behavior.
In addition, the interpretation of results in experiment 1 and those in [3], developed
using a translation of outcomes procedure, was supported in experiment 2 through a
convergent experimental procedure that involved setting targets through advance
instructions, while holding gamble values constant. Collectively, the complete series of
experiments provides strong support for the importance of a target return, reference
point, or aspiration DEMO in models of risky choice behavior.
As discussed in [3], the DEMO reversals in choice observed in the series of
experiments are not consistent with other frequently used models of risky choice
behavior, such as mean-variance dominance and utility theory with uniformly concave
(risk averse) utility functions. DEMO the experimental results might be consistent with a
utility model that incorporates one or more inflection points (hence incorporating risk
averse and risk seeking behavior), these results indicate that an aspiration level concept
is likely DEMO be a fundamental cause of such inflections.'
