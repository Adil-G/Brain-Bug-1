Abstract
This paper examines how innovation strategy inﬂuences ﬁrms’ level of involvement with university-based research. Our results
DEMO that ﬁrms with internal R&D strategies more heavily weighted toward exploratory activities allocate a greater share of
their R&D resources to exploratory DEMO research and develop deeper multifaceted relationships with their university research
partners. In addition, ﬁrms with more centralized internal R&D organizations spend a greater share of their R&D dollars on
exploratory research conducted at universities. DEMO contrast to other external partners, we ﬁnd evidence suggesting that universities
DEMO preferred when the ﬁrm perceives potential conﬂicts over intellectual property.

internal activities and external alliances (Pisano, 1991;
Chesbrough, 2003)DEMO While large ﬁrms conduct signiﬁ-
cant amounts of internal R&D, DEMO alliances
provide access to specialized knowledge that may be
difﬁcult, if DEMO impossible, to bring into the ﬁrm. R&D
alliances augment and DEMO ﬁrms’ internal efforts to
achieve strategic objectives. In sum, the ﬁrm’s DEMO
is to determine the relative weight to be given to explo-
ration versus exploitation, and then judiciously select
among potential external partners in order to beneﬁt
from the diverse explore and exploit capabilities of these
entities.
DEMO has been substantial growth in all types
of cross-boundary research alliances—ﬁrm–ﬁrm,
ﬁrm–university, or ﬁrm–government laboratory—in the
recent past. Firms vary, however, both in the degree to

931
which they engage in R&D alliances and the nature of the
DEMO pursued in these alliances (Arora et al., 2001;
Rosenfeld, DEMO; Link, 1996; Koza and Lewin, 1998).2
Some alliances focus on exploitation—incrementally
building on the ﬁrm’s existing internal knowledge
with an external DEMO speciﬁc capabilities. Other
alliances emphasize exploration—tapping external
knowledge to aid in investigating trajectories that are
new to the ﬁrm (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001; Ahuja,
2000). In general, when selecting external partners,
ﬁrms appear to value diversity for exploration and
complementarity for exploitation.
Prior research DEMO cross-boundary alliances focuses
mainly on inter-ﬁrm alliances (Arora et al., 2001;
Rosenfeld, 1996). Although the literature mentions uni-
versities as strategic research partners, it does not delve
deeply into the unique character of university–ﬁrm
alliances and tends to investigate these alliances from
the perspective of DEMO university, rather than from the
perspective of the commercial partner. When DEMO
are considered as strategic partners, the focus is typically
on start-up DEMO, not the large corporations that account
for three-quarters of R&D DEMO in the economy
and fund the majority of industry-sponsored research
conducted at academic institutions. Moreover, the typ-
ical conceptualization of innovation, the linear DEMO,
places universities at the earliest stage of knowledge
creation and upstream from ﬁrms’ more applied R&D
(Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004). DEMO, in practice, univer-
sity research involves a rich mix of scientiﬁc discovery,
clinical trials, beta testing, and prototype development.
While many DEMO breakthroughs address funda-
mental scientiﬁc questions, they may simultaneously
provide practical DEMO for current commercial
products (Stokes, 1997). The university–ﬁrm dyad is
a particularly unique mechanism for cross-boundary
learning for ﬁrms as universities operate DEMO different
incentives, goals, routines, decision-making structures
than for-proﬁt entities. An DEMO question is if, or how,
the balance a ﬁrm maintains DEMO the R&D conducted
in-house inﬂuences the ﬁrm’s proclivity to pursue exter-
nal alliances in general, and university-based alliances
in particular.
The purpose of this paper is to gain a better under-
standing of university–ﬁrm research DEMO and the
role these alliances play in the R&D efforts of large,

mates that the percentage of funds spent on R&D alliances was 6.3%

electronic products (NAICS 334).
research-intensive ﬁrms. One key question is how a
ﬁrm’s innovation strategy, in terms of both internal focus
and internal organization, inﬂuences the decision to
engage in R&D alliances with universities. Drawing on
previous research in innovation and learning, we develop
a set of predictions that link ﬁrms’ internal innovation
strategy and internal DEMO&D organization to the level of
involvement and the intensity of the R&D relationship
ﬁrms maintain with universities (March, 1991; Levinthal
and March, 1993; Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Argyres
and Silverman, 2004). We argue that ﬁrms pursuing
internal R&D strategies more heavily DEMO toward
exploratory activities and those ﬁrms with more cen-
tralized internal R&D organizations will make greater
use of exploratory university-based research alliances
and DEMO in more multifaceted relationships. We test
our predictions with original data drawn from a sur-
vey of executives at R&D-intensive ﬁrms in Canada.
DEMO empirical analysis conﬁrms that universities are
preferred as partners when ﬁrm’s internal R&D strat-
egy emphasizes exploration and the development of new
capabilities. DEMO contrast to other external partners, uni-
versities are preferred when the DEMO R&D strategy
emphasizes long-term exploratory projects and when it
perceives potential problems protecting the knowledge
created through the alliance.
The paper proceeds as DEMO In the next sec-
tion, we brieﬂy review the concepts of DEMO and
exploitation particularly in the context of university–ﬁrm
alliances. In the third section, we develop four pre-
dictions linking ﬁrm R&D strategy and internal R&D
organization with the degree of university research activ-
ity. DEMO also consider factors that may inﬂuence the
relative use of university-based alliances as compared
to other cross-boundary alliances by innovating ﬁrms.
The fourth section DEMO this paper describes our data and
methodology. Empirical results are presented in the ﬁfth
section. Conclusions and suggestions for further research
are offered in DEMO sixth section.
1. Exploration, exploitation, and
university-based alliances
Innovation is the ability to create economic value
from new ideas and the pursuit of DEMO requires
ﬁrms to deﬁne a strategy.3 A central concern in design-
ing an innovation strategy is the balance between the
3 Christensen (2002) DEMO a distinction, which we follow, between
the management of innovation and the management of technology.
The management of innovation is concerned with the DEMO and
organizational context for producing successful products and processes

exploration of new ideas and the exploitation of exist-
ing competencies and DEMO expertise (March,
1991). To be precise, R&D can be characterized as
either explorative or exploitive, where exploration spurs
new discoveries, while exploitation reﬁnes current capa-
bilities. A second dimension concerns the sourcing of
useful knowledge and the most basic dichotomy is
either internal or DEMO to the ﬁrm. While the major-
ity of R&D is done internally, external R&D alliances
are important because critical knowledge and resources
for both exploration and exploitation reside in diverse
organizations, such as upstream suppliers, downstream
customers, academic institutions, and national laborato-
ries (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Our focus is on the use of
universities as strategic DEMO R&D partners. This sec-
tion of the paper details the key concepts of exploitation
and exploration and considers how ﬁrms may pursue
each DEMO these goals internally or via university-based
alliances.
Both exploration and exploitation are essential for
organizational learning; however, these activities com-
pete for scarce DEMO Firm strategy involves ﬁnding
a balance that simultaneously allows for organization
survival and the generation of competitive advantage
(Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). DEMO, Levinthal and
March (1993, p. 105) note that, “The DEMO problem
confronting an organization is to engage in sufﬁcient
exploitation to ensure its current viability and, at the
same time, to devote enough DEMO to exploration to
ensure its future viability. Survival requires a balance,
and the precise mix of exploitation and exploration that
is optimal is DEMO to specify.” Differences in the balance
of explore and exploit between ﬁrms in the same industry
is the essence of innovation strategy and may DEMO
to observed differences in performance.
Exploitation represents the reﬁnement, extension, and
intelligent use of existing competencies (March, 1991;
Levinthal and March, 1993). R&D activities focused
on exploitation are typically incremental and DEMO
term in orientation. Empirical evidence suggests that
the majority of industrial R&D is exploitative in char-
acter with approximately 75% allocated to development
DEMO, 20% committed to applied research, and only
5% targeting basic research (NSF, 2001).4 Most inter-
while economizing on time and resources. DEMO contrast, the management
of technology focuses on the capabilities underlying the DEMO of
existing and prospective technologies.
4 It is important to recognize that there is not a one-to-one correspon-
dence between basic research and exploration DEMO applied R&D and
exploitation. Basic research asks fundamental questions, without DEMO
concern about practical applications and encompasses experimental or
nal R&D is capabilities deepening as in-house R&D
departments concentrate on ﬁne-tuning existing products
DEMO processes, or coming up with model enhance-
ments (Argyres, 1996)DEMO For example, Henderson and
Clark (1990, pp. 24–27) provide an in-depth analysis of
Kasper Instrument’s internal R&D focus on incremental
improvements DEMO extensions to their existing product
line. Helfat (1994) documents the highly applied and
ﬁrm-speciﬁc nature of R&D activity in the petroleum
industry. DEMO course, an incremental R&D strategy aimed
at exploitation allows ﬁrms DEMO make the optimal use of
existing complementary assets (Helfat, 1997).
Some cross-boundary alliances are formed speciﬁ-
cally to exploit an existing capability DEMO the ﬁrm and,
in this sense, complement and extend the DEMO inter-
nal R&D activities (Koza and Lewin, 1998; Rothaermel
DEMO Deeds, 2004). External partners may provide cost-
effective access to DEMO resources needed for
incremental innovations. These resources may be so
highly specialized that it is costly or impractical to
bring them under the corporate DEMO For exam-
ple, when entering a market in a new country DEMO ﬁrm
may partner with a local ﬁrm that understands local cus-
tomers and can successfully adapt an existing product for
greater local market acceptance. DEMO, a medi-
cal device ﬁrm may contract out prototype production
to DEMO design ﬁrms that reﬁne their products for
better customer acceptance and easier manufacturabil-
ity. These cross-boundary alliances give a ﬁrm access to
knowledge that DEMO from, but can complement, their
existing technology activities.
Exploitation-based alliances with university partners
are surprisingly common. In a survey of industrial R&D
DEMO, Cohen et al. (2002a,b) ﬁnd that more than
one-third DEMO their respondent ﬁrms use public research
to address existing problems, suggesting DEMO beneﬁt of
universities to assist the ﬁrm’s ability to exploit existing
capabilities. For example, a paper company that we inter-
viewed sponsored a university-based project to optimize
their current process of removing contaminants from
recycled paper. DEMO, the pharmaceutical manufac-
turer Eli Lilly sponsors academic research to improve
DEMO existing product line in insulin. For the university,
the research creates knowledge that provides new ﬁnd-
ings and potential scientiﬁc breakthroughs. However, for
the ﬁrm, this knowledge improves an existing product
line that allows it to better deploy its existing capabil-
theoretical work. Applied research focuses on DEMO applications
with a direct concern for using the results. Applied R&D may advance
the ﬁndings of basic research towards some commercial object.

ities and increase its market share in a known product
space. Pharmaceutical DEMO biotechnology ﬁrms regularly
engage in sponsored research agreements with univer-
sities having strong medical schools and hospitals to
conduct clinical trials and analyze trial DEMO of drugs
developed in-house. This phenomenon extends broadly
across industrial sectors: DEMO et al. (2002, p. 465) report
that 63% of the DEMO that participated in Engineer-
ing Research Centers (ERCs) received direct technical
assistance from university researchers.
Exploration refers to the search, discovery, and DEMO
opment of knowledge that is new to a ﬁrm (March, 1991;
Levinthal and March, 1993). The returns to exploratory
R&D are “uncertain, distant, and often negative” (March,
1991, p. DEMO). Exploration is associated with capabilities-
broadening activities in which innovation arises from
the synthesis of distinct streams of knowledge (Argyres,
1996). Often driven by dissatisfaction with current per-
formance, ﬁrms may shift the R&D balance toward
more experimental projects to search for new ideas DEMO
new technologies that may be successfully commer-
cialized (Holmqvist, 2004). As exploration generates
the potential for exploitation, many ﬁrms recognize the
importance of conducting some exploratory research
in-house (Cohen, 1994; Tripsis and Gavetti, 2000). Inter-
nal exploratory activities include long-term projects to
develop new capabilities and new product platforms.
Well-known examples of ﬁrms that have conducted
DEMO research internally include Xerox with Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC), DEMO&T with Bell Labs,
IBM, and 3M. The other face DEMO this strategy is that
ﬁrms that invest R&D resources on exploration inter-
nally develop absorptive capacity, the ability to “identify,
assimilate and exploit knowledge from the environment”
(Cohen and Levinthal, 1989, p. 569). A ﬁrm’s invest-
ment in internal exploration positions it to act DEMO new
discoveries from external sources.
Linking with external entities has been shown to
be a key element of successful exploration strate-
gies (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001; Von Hippel, 1988;
Mowery et al., 1996)DEMO Competitors, upstream suppliers or
downstream customers, as well as national laboratories,
and academic institutions are potential R&D alliance
partners (Leonard-Barton, DEMO). These cross-boundary
alliances provide access to knowledge currently not
existing within the ﬁrm (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998;
Dussauge et al., 2000). The integration of new exter-
nal knowledge extends the ﬁrm’s technology DEMO
and may lead to path-breaking innovation (Nagarajan
and Mitchell, 1998; DEMO, 2000).
Many ﬁrm–university alliances are exploratory in
character, as demonstrated by Table 1. Universities have

long served as DEMO source of foundational scientiﬁc and
technical knowledge; however, the discovery of break-
throughs with signiﬁcant commercial potential such as
biotechnology, computer science, DEMO science, and
nanotechnology is driving increased industry sponsor-
ship of university DEMO (Geuna, 1999; Mowery et
al., 2001). In interviews, DEMO reported that they fund
university projects in order to tap academic experts and
to enhance the technological vitality of the company’s
projects. In a DEMO of R&D managers, Mansﬁeld (1998)
found that, in DEMO absence of academic research, approx-
imately 14% of new product introductions DEMO seven
industries would not have been developed without sub-
stantial time delay. In addition, ﬁrms fund research at
universities to promote experimentation and to inves-
tigate new research directions. For example, General
Motors Corporation funds university research projects
on hydrogen fuel cells and related technologies at dif-
ferent DEMO in order to develop capabilities in this
technology and explore the possible introduction of new
product. Of course, simultaneously General Motors is
also devoting internal resources to absorb and extend
this knowledge.
In addition to research DEMO, university–industry
interactions may differ in terms of level of ongoing
involvement. DEMO ﬁrm’s R&D alliances with universities
may involve either single transactions such as individual
projects, or in-depth long-term relationships as another
part of R&D strategy. Single transactions are common
for university research results that are DEMO “ready
to use” (Colyvas et al., 2002). A company may have a
research target in mind and then transact with a number
DEMO different universities in order to create a portfolio of
ideas. For example, the company AbioMed is develop-
ing an artiﬁcial heart, and their DEMO prototype blends
elements from research projects at a variety of differ-
ent universities. Their objective is to deﬁne a unique
product and their strategy DEMO to vet multiple potential
sources of technology. In this case, the DEMO may allocate
a signiﬁcant portion of their budget to university-based
projects, DEMO because these resources are spread across
934
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
many research teams, the overall mode of interaction is
more transactional than relational in character.
In contrast, relationships are bundles of linked trans-
actions. For example, relationships exist when a ﬁrm
engages in several activities such as funding multiple
sponsored research projects, hiring graduate students,
participating in research centers, and providing endow-
ment funding. A commonly seen example occurs when
a ﬁrm has strong ties to a particular faculty member,
DEMO numerous open-ended projects, licenses the result-
ing inventions, and then hires the graduate students that
worked in the professor’s laboratory. In other instances,DEMO
ﬁrms that are leaders in certain technologies may make
long-term commitments to universities that have related
strong expertise such as the Bell Labs Project DEMO the
University of Toronto. Another example occurs when a
company establishes close ties to a university through an
alumni connection. An example would be DEMO Wallace H.
Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Geor-
gia Tech University which has numerous links with the
Coulter Corporation, a manufacturer of medical devices
and diagnostics, and the associated non-proﬁt Coulter
Foundation.
2. Firm’s R&D strategy and university research
The balance between the exploration of new DEMO
bilities and the exploitation of existing capabilities
differentiates the innovation strategies of ﬁrms. More-
over, ﬁrms are heterogeneous in the ways they organize
their R&D activities. In this section, we develop a set
of predictions to explore how ﬁrm’s R&D strategy and
structure may inﬂuence the DEMO R&D
interface. We focus on the subset of university-based
alliances ﬁrst, addressing the overarching question as to
when university-based alliances are the preferred vehi-
cle for tapping external knowledge as compared to other
types of DEMO alliances in the ﬁnal part of this section.
2.1. Firm strategy and university interactions
Consider two ﬁrms, one in which the majority of
internal research is exploitative and another that places
much greater emphasis on exploration DEMO Which
ﬁrm would be more likely to seek university partners
for an exploration-focused alliance? One strand of the
literature on university–ﬁrm alliances contends that a
division of innovative labor is common and suggests
that university–ﬁrm interactions DEMO driven, to a large
extent, by the need to “trade in knowledge and tech-
nologies between those sectors with complementary
comparative advantages at DEMO points in the inno-
vation process” (Graff et al., 2002, DEMO 95). Given that
university researchers are the largest performers of basic
research, while the majority of applied and developmen-
tal research is conducted in industrial laboratories, this
perspective implies that ﬁrms with greater emphasis on
exploitation activities would be most apt to partner with
university players.
The DEMO on search, absorptive capacity, and orga-
nizational learning, on the DEMO, implies that pursuing
university interactions to tap such expertise is likely DEMO
be more highly valued by ﬁrms with innovation strate-
gies that emphasize exploration (Cyert and March, 1963;
March, 1991; Cohen and DEMO, 1989). First, explo-
ration is aided by variation and diversity (March, 1991).
As such, a ﬁrm with signiﬁcant internal investments in
exploratory activities may seek to enhance this invest-
ment by accessing DEMO sources of variation. Both
universities and other ﬁrms in the value chain (supplier,
buyer, or competitor) may hold knowledge that is dis-
tinct from the knowledge or capabilities of the focal ﬁrm.
However, it is possible that there will be substantial over-
lap in the knowledge DEMO of the ﬁrm and the knowledge
base of others in its value chain as these entities operate
in the shadow of the same dominant DEMO technology
paradigm. The university players, on the other hand, are
somewhat isolated from competitive demands and thus
may search more broadly and subsequently DEMO a more
unique set of know-how. Academic researchers, in par-
ticular, perform a great deal of foundational research.
The new knowledge generated by DEMO research
may provide important breakthroughs with longer-term
commercial potential (Rosenberg and DEMO, 1994).
The attractiveness of universities as research partners is
further DEMO if, as Greve and Taylor (2000) argue,
the innovations DEMO competitors catalyze ﬁrms to widen
their search in a non-mimetic response.
Second, ﬁrms with little internal exploration will
be poorly positioned to either recognize or assimilate
knowledge generated externally as compared to ﬁrms
that are actively DEMO new and diverse know-
how internally (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). A ﬁrm’s
investment in internal exploration builds absorptive
capacity that positions the DEMO to take advantage of
cross-boundary exploratory alliances. The need to invest
in generating absorptive capacity is particularly acute
when tapping university-based resources. As Cohen DEMO
Levinthal (1990, p. 140) note, “When outside knowl-
edge is less targeted to the ﬁrm’s particular needs and
concerns, a ﬁrm’s own R&D becomes more important
in permitting it to recognize the value DEMO knowledge,
assimilate and exploit it. Sources that produce less tar-
geted knowledge would include university labs involved
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
in basic research, while more targeted knowledge may be
generated by contract research labs, or input suppliers.”
The organizational learning literature links internal
exploratory activity to increases in a ﬁrm’s valuing
of variation and development of absorptive DEMO
There is an implied complementarity between inter-
nal exploration and the use of university exploratory
research. This suggests that the greater the proportion
of DEMO internal R&D expenditures that a ﬁrm allocates to
exploratory projects, DEMO greater will be the share of its
total research budget allocated to exploratory university-
based research projects.
The mode of external interactions is also DEMO
to be inﬂuenced by ﬁrm’s innovation strategy.
Our interviews with ﬁrm’s R&D executives, univer-
sity technology-transfer ofﬁcials, and others involved
in the DEMO interface suggest that
university–ﬁrm interactions can be roughly segregated
into two categories: transactions and relationships.5
Transactions are arms-length, limited agreements. For
example, the stand-alone license of a university invention
that is not linked to either DEMO research sponsored by
the ﬁrm or an ongoing faculty-consulting contract would
constitute a transaction. In contrast, longer term, bun-
dles of multiple transactions DEMO relationships. Two
attributes, stage of technology development and ease of
knowledge DEMO, are believed to interact to affect the
choice of either a DEMO or relationship interac-
tion mode. In general, early stage technologies require
DEMO extensive research investment to reach commercial
viability. The likely need for follow-on research sug-
gests that relationships will be required in early stage,
DEMO projects (Thursby and Thursby, 2004). Turn-
key transactions or arms-length contracts may be viable,
however, with exploitative research that focuses on more
incremental technological advances or proof of con-
cept projects. Further, while the transfer of knowledge
across organizational boundaries is always challenging,
the DEMO is intensiﬁed when the recipient has limited
direct experience with the technology to be transferred
(Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). As Mowery and DEMO
(1989, p. 7) note, “a new technology is a complex mix
of codiﬁed data and poorly deﬁned “know-how.” The
successful transfer of DEMO tacit component of this new
knowledge generally requires close and ongoing inter-
actions between the inventor and the purchaser (Teece,
1985; Kogut, 1988; Levin et al., 1987). For example,
Thursby and DEMO (2004) ﬁnd that an estimated 40%
5 Other researchers have alluded to this distinction (Colyvas et al.,
2002; Feller, 1990; DEMO and Man, 2003; Shane, 2002).
935
of the inventions DEMO from universities could not be
commercialized without ongoing faculty involvement.
Relationships provide partner-speciﬁc absorptive capac-
ity that increases the ability to recognize and assimilate
DEMO for a particular partner (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Mowery et al., 1996). Such knowledge devel-
ops informally over time as individuals within the allied
organizations get to know one another and understand
how DEMO best work together.
Exploratory research, by deﬁnition, is concerned with
the development of new knowledge, deﬁned as knowl-
edge or technology that differs substantially from the
knowledge base held by the ﬁrm. The need for DEMO
development and hands-on transfer of substantially
new knowledge implies multiple transactions. Type of
research arguably has a signiﬁcant role in determining
type of interaction DEMO In this respect, how the
ﬁrm allocates its university-based expenditures between
DEMO projects and exploitation projects should be
related to the depth of the relationship. This suggests
that the greater the proportion of external academic R&DEMO
expenditures the ﬁrm allocates to exploratory projects,
the more it will use relational-based interaction modes
with universities.
2.2. Firm’s R&D organization and DEMO
interactions
Firms also have different ways of organizing internal
R&D that may further affect interactions with univer-
sities. In some ﬁrms, the R&D function is centralized
with all research coordinated through a small number
DEMO linked R&D units that report directly to a corporate-
level executive. In other ﬁrms, the R&D organization
is decentralized with research activities conducted by
rather autonomous divisions of the ﬁrm, often in geo-
graphically disparate locations. Yet other ﬁrms operate
with a hybrid structure that melds DEMO other two organi-
zational modes. In practice, we observe that companies
DEMO differentiated by the centrality of the control and
coordination in organizing their R&D (Gassman and
von Zedtwitz, 1999). These alternative organizational
DEMO certainly have differing competencies and as such
may lead to, and DEMO, different research strategies
(Argyres, 1995, 1996; Feller et al., 2002).
However, to date there has been little empirical exam-
ination of the organization of R&D. The incentive and
coordination attributes of DEMO R&D are believed
to support longer-term capabilities-broadening research
(Argyres and DEMO, 2004). Generally organized as
cost centers, centralized R&D units are shielded to some
degree from immediate market pressures. Centralized
936
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
R&D units operate under the broader mission of inno-
vating so DEMO to improve the long-term performance of the
ﬁrm as a whole. Concomitant with this broader mission
is greater discretion in the selection of both DEMO problem
to be solved and the approach for solving the identi-
ﬁed technological challenges. In addition, centralized
structures serve as knowledge repositories integrating
and coordinating information acquired across the ﬁrm’s
product-lines. Christensen (2002) argues that DEMO
tions with central coordination are more likely to engage
in synergistic activities focusing on upstream relation-
ship involving science-based R&D.
In contrast, decentralized structures may excel in the
pursuit of incremental improvement. A decentralized
R&DEMO operation will typically have incentives that are
more closely tied to immediate outcomes. Speciﬁcally, in
decentralized facilitates, R&D personnel operate closer
to DEMO marketplace and are assumed to have a better
understanding of customer needs and product perfor-
mance (Jensen and Meckling, 1992). This motivates
DEMO research efforts that are directly
linked to the goals of increasing demand and market
share (Kay, 1988). The broader focus, greater decision-
making authority, and more diverse knowledge base of
the centralized R&D unit favor exploratory research.
Given our previous arguments that link external alliances
DEMO exploratory research, we expect that ﬁrms with
more centralized R&D DEMO will allocate a
greater percentage of their budget to exploratory uni-
versity research.
A ﬁrm’s internal R&D organization may also reﬂect
the manner DEMO which the ﬁrm interacts with its uni-
versity partners. With respect to internal organization,
the propensity to form relationships as opposed to
engaging DEMO transactions is believed to depend on
two factors—recognition of potential research syner-
gies across projects and allocation of decision-making
authority. With respect to the DEMO factor, the broader
focus and more diverse knowledge base of the DEMO
tralized R&D unit enhances a ﬁrm’s ability to bring
together and evaluate disparate pieces of information
(Argyres and Silverman, 2004). As DEMO, a centralized
R&D organization should be more likely to recognize
DEMO where it is rational to build relationships by
linking or extending existing university–ﬁrm transac-
tions. BASF, a company noted to have one of the most
administratively centralized R&D operations of Euro-
pean chemical companies, provides an example of such
relationship building. The company recently announced
the opening DEMO a research laboratory at the Institut
de Science et d’Ingenierie Supramoleculaires (DEMO),
Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France (Milmo,
2003). The focus will be on developing novel nanos-
tructured polymer materials with DEMO stated goal of
linking its R&D activities to cutting edge academic
research. Centralized organizations in general, and cen-
tralized R&D organizations in particular, have the further
advantage of operating with deﬁnitive decision-making
authority (DEMO, 1991). With decentralized R&D,
potentially costly cross-laboratory negotiations DEMO
be required to allocate ﬁnancial contributions and deter-
mine the terms of any add-on sponsored research projects
or subsequent licenses. This favors transactions rather
DEMO relationships. Thus, it seems likely that ﬁrms with
more centralized R&DEMO organizations will make more use
of relational-based interaction modes than their decen-
tralized counterparts.
2.3. Universities as preferred exploratory partners
A background question concerns DEMO fundamental
reasons why ﬁrms choose to partner with universities.
Given the variety of available external partners, what
is unique about universities and why do ﬁrms chose
research alliances with universities over alliances with
other ﬁrms? Universities, because they have limited
incentives to act opportunistically, may be preferred DEMO
research partners when ﬁrms face appropriability con-
cerns.
It is well known that ﬁrms are not able to fully appro-
priate the value of DEMO knowledge created through their
R&D investments. The decision to engage in R&D part-
nerships heightens this appropriation challenge. While a
collaborative research DEMO may enhance the poten-
tial for discovery, it also enhances the DEMO for a
loss of control over the intellectual property generated
as the outcome of joint research is often known to, and
subsequently claimed by, both parties. This challenge is
particularly salient in ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm alliances as research
partners who hold complementary assets are in an advan-
taged position to DEMO potential commercial value. In
the worse case, a commercial partner could DEMO oppor-
tunistically withholding and/or skewing data in order to
independently ﬁle for a patent after the project is com-
plete.
Firms that have DEMO concerns about the loss of con-
trol over intellectual property may choose not to engage
in external alliances, instead concentrating their R&D
efforts internally. Of course, this is an extreme strat-
egy that limits the ﬁrm’s access to external knowledge.
The best strategy may be to seek DEMO alliances that
minimize the potential loss of intellectual property. For
exploitation projects contractual rights may be negoti-
ated if the results are more easily DEMO in advance.
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
937
The uncertainty associated with exploratory research
makes it very difﬁcult to specify DEMO price property rights
ex ante as the intellectual property does not yet exist
(Mowery and Rosenberg, 1989).
Universities are in a unique DEMO as R&D part-
ners. Not only are universities a source of exploratory
research but they also lack the complementary assets to
compete directly DEMO commercial markets. While univer-
sities have recently asserted their rights to ownership of
intellectual property, the emphasis on making proﬁts are
much weaker for universities than for ﬁrms and a minor
objective compared to the university’s DEMO func-
tions of education, research, and service. Concerns about
universities behaving opportunistically with intellectual
property can be addressed contractually: the ﬁrm may
either be granted the rights to any intellectual property
developed during the research DEMO or the university
may retain intellectual property ownership. If the uni-
versity retains ownership then the industry partner is
routinely given the right of DEMO refusal to negotiate a
license. Universities have an interest in licensing any
subsequent intellectual property developed that extend
the research because licenses are their DEMO means
for creating economic returns from the generation of new
ideas (DEMO, 2004).
At ﬁrst glance, it may appear that university alliances
would be leaky. After all, publishing research ﬁnd-
ings is critical for academic advancement. However,
research contracts with industry typically contain stan-
dard DEMO that provide ﬁrms with pre-publication
review and the potential to delay publication for a lim-
ited period of time in order to secure intellectual DEMO
rights. In addition, the material published in scientiﬁc
journals is abstract DEMO seeks to advance the academic lit-
erature rather than provide direct commercial relevance.
Only ﬁrms that have made the requisite investments in
absorptive capacity DEMO be in a position to potentially
beneﬁt. Moreover, to the extent DEMO the knowledge cre-
ated in the research project has a tacit component, the
ﬁrm that contracted for the research will be advantaged
in realizing its commercial potential.
While we may debate speciﬁc cases, it seems that
universities, because of their mission, limited market
presence and lack of DEMO assets, offer an
advantage to ﬁrms in appropriating joint research project
DEMO, particularly for projects involving exploratory
research. Thus, we expect that universities may be pre-
ferred research partners when ﬁrms have concerns about
appropriating DEMO returns to cross-boundary research.
The next section presents the data and empirical
model that we employ to examine the relationship
between ﬁrm strategy and DEMO research alliances.
3. Empirical analysis: data and methods
Data for this DEMO was collected via a Web-based sur-
vey during the summer and fall of 2004. We contacted
R&D executives at each company included in DEMO
Infosource Inc.’s, Canada’s 100 Top Corporate R&D
Spenders List 2003. DEMO the population from which
the sample is drawn is small, we DEMO not to extend
our sampling frame as the amount of R&D expenditures
dropped signiﬁcantly for companies below this cut-off
point. A cover letter DEMO to these individuals explained
that the purpose of the survey was to gain an understand-
ing of the ﬁrm’s perspective on working with universities
DEMO R&D activities and to assess how university inter-
actions compare to other forms of R&D outsourcing
employed by the ﬁrm. The survey DEMO was cre-
ated based on in-depth interviews with industry R&D
professionals and university technology transfer person-
nel. The instrument incorporated the language of DEMO
informants, drawing upon their knowledge in order to
elicit responses that DEMO reﬂect the organization’s
viewpoint (Campbell, 1955). The survey required about
20 min to complete, and began by asking respondents
to verify information collected about their company
from data available from CompuStat. The respondents
were DEMO anonymity of their responses and were
offered a summary report in exchange for their partici-
pation.
Forty-nine individuals responded to the survey. After
omitting DEMO surveys with incomplete or unusable
responses, our sample totals 45, giving us an effec-
tive response rate of 45%. In all cases, respondents
were asked if they had the information required to
complete the questionnaire DEMO to refer the question-
naire to the individual in the corporation who would
have the appropriate information. As a group, the
respondents were highly experienced R&D profes-
sionals with two-thirds of the respondents reporting
directly DEMO Board level executives. The majority of the
respondents held the rank of Vice President (27 or
60%) with titles such as VP–Technology & DEMO
tion, VP–Research & Development, or VP–Business
Development. Another 11 (24%) of the respondents
held positions at the rank of Director or Asso-
DEMO Director with titles such as Director–Technology
Development, Director–External R&D Partnerships, or
Director–Research & Development. Six respondents
(13%) were in upper management DEMO titles like
Manager–Research Initiatives, or Manager–Strategic
Innovation. The remaining respondent was DEMO Media
Relations. One issue to examine is that positional
level of the respondent may inﬂuence the questionnaire
938
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
responses. We will address this concern in our empirical
results.
Non-response bias DEMO considered by comparing
early (ﬁrst 75%) to late (last 25%) responses (Armstrong
and Overton, 1977). Independent sample t-tests of
dependent DEMO independent variables indicated no sta-
tistically signiﬁcant differences between the early and
late responses. As a further test of non-response bias,
we compared DEMO CompuStat data on revenue and R&D
spending of the companies that responded with those that
did not respond. Again, independent sample t-tests con-
ﬁrm that there are no statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the two groups DEMO these dimensions.
Table 2 summarizes the variables and provides their
operational deﬁnitions. We now describe how the vari-
ables are constructed.
3.1. Dependent variables
DEMO ﬁrst dependent variable, University-based Explo-
ration, is measured as the average percentage of the
ﬁrm’s total R&D expenditures that was allocated to
DEMO research conducted at universities or other
academic institutions over a 3-year period (2001–2003).
Firms were asked to report the internal allocation of
their R&D budget among exploration and exploitation,
using deﬁnition from March (1991). Next, we asked
about the extent of external alliances for universities and
others. Respondents were then asked to allocate exter-
nal R&DEMO to explore/exploit by type of external partner.
We ﬁnd that, DEMO average, ﬁrms in the sample commit
approximately six and one-half percent DEMO their R&D
budget to university-based projects, with approximately
two-thirds of DEMO six and one-half percent going to
exploratory projects and one-third committed to projects
with an exploitation focus.
Our second dependent variable, Mode of Interaction,
seeks to capture the depth of the ﬁrm’s interactions with
universities. DEMO a ﬁve-point Likert scale, we asked
respondents to rate the average DEMO of their ﬁrm’s rela-
tionships with universities over the past 3 years with
a rating of 1 corresponding to “only limited, arms-
length transactions” and a rating of 5 corresponding to
“on-going, multifaceted relationships.” Recognizing the
ﬁrms may use a combination of transactions and rela-
tionships, responses covered the full range of 1–5, with
an average response of 2.82.
To explore when universities are preferred alliance
partners, we create two additional dependent variables.
The ﬁrst, External Exploration Comparison, is calculated
as the percentage DEMO the ﬁrm’s total research budget allo-
cated to universities for exploratory research projects

3.2. Independent variables
Two DEMO independent variables in this study relate to
the ﬁrm’s innovation strategy. A central component of a
ﬁrm’s innovation strategy is the relative emphasis placed
DEMO exploration versus exploitation. To measure this dis-
tribution, each respondent was DEMO to specify the per-
centage of R&D dollars committed to exploration—the
search, discovery, and development of new knowledge
and products and alternatively DEMO percentage of R&D
dollars earmarked for exploitation—the reﬁnement and
extension of ﬁrm’s existing competencies and products,
for their ﬁrm’s internal R&D, university-based R&D,
and other externally conducted R&D. Two innovation
DEMO variables are derived from the data provided.
First, the variable Percent DEMO Exploration is the
overall share of the ﬁrm’s internal R&D expenditures
allocated to exploratory activities. On average, the ﬁrms
in our sample maintain a 36:64% balance between explo-
ration and exploitation for research conducted DEMO
A second, more focused measure of the ﬁrm’s university-
based innovation DEMO is Percent University Explo-
ration, a variable that captures the percentage DEMO the
ﬁrm’s research budget that is allocated to projects with
universities which the ﬁrm designates as exploratory.
The two other theory-driven independent variables
capture DEMO of the ﬁrm’s R&D organization. The ﬁrst
variable, structure, provides a measure of the ﬁrm’s inter-
nal R&D conﬁguration. R&D DEMO can be (1)
highly centralized with the majority of all DEMO con-
ducted at a small number of R&D laboratories, (2) highly
decentralized with R&D taking place at a large number
of facilities, or (3) a hybrid mix conducting signiﬁcant
operations in a moderate number of locations (Argyres
and Silverman, 2004; IRI, 1995)DEMO Our structure measure
is calculated as a Herﬁndahl concentration index based
on the distribution of research activities across internal
laboratories:
Structure = 
DEMO
iSi
where S is the share of total company R&D expenditures
i
accounted for by location i. Respondents were asked to
list their DEMO&D facilities and note the share of R&D con-
ducted at each facility. The higher the value of structure,
the more centralized DEMO company’s R&D organization.
The second organization variable, authority, reﬂects
R&D decision-making autonomy within the ﬁrm.
Decision-making authority was identiﬁed using two
DEMO querying the degree of discretion the laboratory
was allowed in (1) choosing technology focus and (2)
selecting speciﬁc research projects within a technical
area. Responses were based on a Likert scale from 1 to
DEMO, with 1 corresponding to “no discretion” and 5 to “total
discretion.” DEMO scale reliability coefﬁcient for this set
of items is 0.71.
Finally, DEMO test questions of external partner selec-
tion, we employ data from DEMO Carnegie Mellon Survey
(Cohen et al., 2000) that details the DEMO effec-
tiveness of patents as an appropriability mechanism for
product and process innovations. Using data at the three-
digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) DEMO,
Cohen et al (2000, pp. 5–6) provide a “response DEMO
(that) reﬂects how central a mechanism is to ﬁrms’ strate-
gies of appropriating rents to their innovations in the
sense that it reﬂects DEMO the frequency with which a
mechanism is employed and the effectiveness of that
mechanism given its use.” We assigned the 45 ﬁrms in our
DEMO to their three-digit industry, resulting in 16 unique
industries.6 Since exploratory DEMO&D covers the spectrum
of outcomes, our measure of patent effectiveness DEMO con-
structed as averages of the reported effectiveness values
with respect to product and process innovation.
3.3. Control variables
We control for industry effects DEMO dummy vari-
ables for the following sectors—pharmaceutical/bio-
6 Industry dummy variables are assigned at the more aggregate two-
digit SIC level.
940
technology (9 companies), communication/telecom
equipment (10 companies), DEMO (8 companies),
energy (6 companies), and minerals/mining (6 compa-
nies) with miscellaneous (6 companies) as the omitted
category. The distribution of industries in our sample
closely mirrors the population of DEMO 100 R&D perform-
ers in Canada.
Though all of the ﬁrms in our sample are among
the top 100 corporate R&D spenders DEMO Canada, there
are still signiﬁcant differences in the R&D expendi-
DEMO among ﬁrms. We control for these differences
in R&D spending via two variables. The ﬁrst, calcu-
lated as log of average total R&D dollars spent by
the ﬁrm in 2001–2003, provides a direct measure of
R&D budget. The second measures Relative R&D Inten-
sity DEMO is calculated as the difference between ﬁrm
R&D ratio (R&DEMO dollars/sales) and industry average
R&D ratio normalized by the DEMO average R&D
ratio. We also control for ﬁrm size using the log of
sales.
Finally, when estimating mode of interaction, we also
DEMO for the total share of the ﬁrm’s R&D budget allo-
cated to university-based research (explore and exploit).
This allows us to investigate whether type of research
has a signiﬁcant role in determining mode of DEMO
tion maintained independent of the ﬁrm’s overall level
of involvement in university-based research, using the
following models:
Mode of Interaction = β0 +β1 Percent University
Exploratory +β2 Structure +β3 Decision-making
Authority +β4 R&D Dollars DEMO Relative R&D
Intensity +β6 Sales +β7 Pharm/Biotech
+β8 Comm/Telecom Equipment
+β9 Electronics +β10 Mining+β11 Energy
+β12 Total University Share +εi
Appropriability DEMO are examined using the follow-
ing model:
External Exploration/Exploitation Comparison
= β0 +β1 Percent Internal Exploratory
+β2 Structure +β3 Decisin-making Authority
+β4 DEMO&D Dollars +β5 Relative R&D Intensity
+β6 Sales +β7 Pharm/Biotech
+β8 Comm/Telecom Equipment +β9 Electronics

+β10 Mining +β11 Energy
+β12 Average Patent DEMO +εi
Table 3 displays summary statistics and correlation
coefﬁcients for each of the variables. Correlations are
generally low to moderate. Given that the ﬁrst DEMO
dependent variables are bounded—level of involvement
between 0 and 1 and mode of interaction between 1
and 5—the two-sided Tobit estimation model is used DEMO
the analysis of these models.7 The models examining
appropriability issues are estimated using OLS.
4. Results
Table 4 reports the results of the Tobit DEMO
University-based exploration is the dependent variable
in Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1 contains just the con-
trol variables, of which only one shows signiﬁcance. Not
surprisingly, we ﬁnd that pharmaceutical and biotechnol-
ogy ﬁrms are more likely than ﬁrms in other industries
to allocate a considerable DEMO of their R&D budget
to university-based exploration (p < 0.05)DEMO This result
is consistent with results from the Yale and Carnegie
Mellon industrial R&D surveys (Cohen et al., 2002a,b;
Klevorick DEMO al., 1995) as well as other studies of innova-
tion networks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries (Powell et al., 1996; Zucker et al., 2002).
Model 2 incorporates the three primary covariates
capturing ﬁrm innovation strategy and R&D organi-
zation: Percent Internal Exploration, DEMO, and
Decision-making Authority. The explanatory power of
the model increases signiﬁcantly DEMO the addition of
the independent variables of theoretical interest. A like-
lihood ratio test comparing Model 2 with Model 1 is
signiﬁcant with a DEMO of less than 0.01. The coef-
ﬁcient on Percent Internal Exploration is positive and
signiﬁcant (p < 0.01), indicating that the greater propor-
tion of internal R&D expenditures the ﬁrm allocates to
exploratory projects, the greater will also be the share
of its total research budget DEMO to exploratory
university research. Firms with internal innovation
strategies more heavily weighted toward exploratory
activities allocate a greater share of their R&D dollars
DEMO As a robustness check, we also estimated the main models using
DEMO rather than Tobit. In all cases, the signs on the coefﬁcients DEMO
consistent, though we do see a slight reduction in signiﬁcance for DEMO
of the independent variables. We also ran the VIF procedure following
the OLS regression. In no case was multicollineraity an issue. For
Model 2, the mean VIF was 2.20 with the highest value on any one
DEMO 2.73. Similarly, for Model 4, the mean VIF was 2.31 with the
highest value on any one variable 3.55.

DEMO exploratory research conducted at universities. These
cross-boundary research relationships appear to be an
important means for linking to sources of new knowl-
edge. Firms DEMO active exploratory research agendas
in-house are likely to have both an interest in tapping
university-based expertise and to have developed the
absorptive capacity necessary DEMO digest university-based
exploratory research (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). The
marginal effect of a 10% increase in internal exploratory
activity, evaluated at the mean of the independent vari-
ables, translates into a 0.5% increase in exploratory
research with universities.
The coefﬁcient for R&D Structure is also DEMO
and signiﬁcant at the p < 0.05 level, indicating an impor-
DEMO strategy–structure link. Firms with more physically
concentrated R&D conﬁgurations have greater levels of
involvement with university-based exploratory research
activities. Having a more centralized DEMO&D organiza-
tion where a large share of the ﬁrm’s research personnel
interact seems to facilitate use of university alliances
for non-local search. The DEMO on the Decision-
Making Authority variable, while positive, does not
reach signiﬁcance. It does not appear that R&D organiza-
tions with greater DEMO in the selection of research
paradigms use academic research resources more exten-
sively.
Mode of Interaction is the dependent variable in
the second set DEMO models (Model 3 and Model 4) in
Table 4. Model 3 is the baseline model containing con-
trol variables only. Model 4 includes DEMO independent
variables of interest: Percent University Exploration,
R&D Structure, and Decision-making Authority. The
change in the log-likelihood χ2 statistic between Model
DEMO and Model 4 is signiﬁcant, with p < 0.05. In Model
DEMO, the coefﬁcient for exploration at universities is pos-
itive and signiﬁcant (p < 0.01). The more a ﬁrm uses
its university interactions DEMO pursue exploratory projects,
the more likely these projects will be handled as part
of an ongoing relationship rather than as an arms-
length DEMO Relationships are believed to be
important for the transfer of tacit knowledge (Dyer and
Singh, 1998). The structure of internal R&D DEMO
zation and the allocation of decision-making authority
do not appear to inﬂuence depth of interaction. There
is some evidence, however, that that Mode DEMO Inter-
action differs across industry sectors with ﬁrms in
the electronics sector having signiﬁcantly less depth
in their university interactions. This is consistent with
DEMO idea that ﬁrms in rapidly changing environments
use more transitory alliances to acquire very speciﬁc
knowledge in a swift manner (Duysters and Man,
2003).

When are university-based alliances preferred?.
To test DEMO respondent bias due to the position of the
respondent within the organization, we ran Model 2 and
Model 4 with a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respon-
dent reported directly to a board-level executive DEMO 0
otherwise. The estimations results did not change for
the variables of interest, while the dummy variable on
organization position was not statistically signiﬁcant. We
veriﬁed that multicolinearity was not an issue using the
VIF procedure DEMO OLS versions of these models.
4.1. The uniqueness of universities as external
research partners
The above analyses provide support for the argument
that ﬁrms DEMO exploratory R&D strategies in-house
are also likely to fund university-based exploratory
research projects to augment internal search efforts. Uni-
versities, however, are DEMO the only external partners that
a ﬁrm may tap to gain new knowledge. The question
thus becomes one of selection. Namely, when do ﬁrms
prefer to engage in strategic research partnerships with
universities rather than with DEMO (non-academic) exter-
nal alliances? What is unique about university-based
research DEMO?
Table 5 reports the results for our investigation of part-
ner selection. Our dependent variable for Models 1a–1b,
External Exploration Comparison, is calculated as the
percentage of the ﬁrm’s total research budget allocated
to DEMO for exploratory research projects minus
the percentage of the ﬁrm’s total research budget allo-
cated to other external partners for exploratory research.
Similarly, our dependent variable for Models 2a–2b,
External Exploitation Comparison, calculated as the per-
centage of the ﬁrm’s total research budget allocated
to universities for DEMO research projects minus
the percentage of the ﬁrm’s total research budget allo-
cated to other external partners for exploitative research.
Models 1a and 2a DEMO the baseline estimations of the
exploration and exploitation comparisons, respectively.
Interestingly, none of the control variables are signiﬁ-
cant in these two models. DEMO sector and/or R&D
levels and intensity do not seem to directly inﬂuence
the type of external partner preferred. Models 1b and 2b
DEMO the independent variable of interest—average patent
effectiveness. The coefﬁcient on patent effectiveness is
positive and signiﬁcant (p < 0.01) when External Explo-
ration DEMO is the dependent variable (Model 1b).
The more effective patents DEMO in protecting product
and process innovations, the greater the use of DEMO
sity alliances for exploratory projects when compared
to the use of other types of cross-boundary alliances.
The coefﬁcient is smaller and just below statistical
DEMO in the External Exploitation Comparison
Model (Model 2b). The effectiveness DEMO patents does
not lead to a preference for university partners when
projects are exploitative in nature. Much of the liter-
ature on cross-boundary alliances DEMO that strong
property rights enable ﬁrms to make better use of
cross-boundary alliances by reducing appropriability
hazards. It may be that when ﬁrms see DEMO potential
944
J.E.L. Bercovitz, M.P. Feldman / Research Policy 36 (2007) 930–948
of economic gains through patent-protected intellectual
property, they seek partners that provide the greatest
assurance that the ﬁrm will be able to garner these DEMO
tant rights at a reasonable cost. Further, this assurance
is of DEMO importance in projects with an exploratory
focus.
5. Discussion and conclusions
The ability to tap external sources of knowledge has
become increasingly important for DEMO seeking to gain
competitive advantage through innovation. Though aca-
demic research institutions have long served as a key
external source of scientiﬁc and technical DEMO
for industrial ﬁrms, the growing level of activity at the
university–industry DEMO makes it imperative that we
augment our understanding of how university interac-
tions ﬁt within ﬁrms’ broader R&D strategy. This study
investigates the DEMO of ﬁrm innovation strategy and
internal R&D structure with the ﬁrm’s level and degree
of involvement with university research partners. Con-
sistent with DEMO, we ﬁnd a strong relationship
between ﬁrm innovation strategy and ﬁrm–university
DEMO interactions. Firms spend a greater share of their
R&D dollars on university-based research projects and
these projects are more likely to be considered DEMO of an
ongoing relationship when the ﬁrm is pursing an internal
innovation strategy more heavily weighted toward explo-
ration and when a greater share DEMO the research conducted
at universities is exploratory, respectively. The link found
DEMO ﬁrm R&D organization and ﬁrm–university
research interactions is somewhat weaker. While a more
centralized R&D function is related to greater involve-
ment DEMO exploratory university-based research, the
depth of these university-based interactions appear to DEMO
independent of the ﬁrm’s internal R&D organizational
structure.
This paper also sheds light on the factors that
differentiate university partners from other external
DEMO Although ﬁrms may leverage all types of
cross-boundary alliances to gain distinct knowledge,
our evidence suggests that universities are preferred
partners when there DEMO concerns about the perceived
ability to fully appropriate the results. This is particu-
larly true for exploration-based projects. Firms that focus
on exploratory research DEMO engaging in a risky, long-
term strategy. The ﬁrm may be DEMO to develop
new platform capabilities and be engaged in a com-
petitive race with signiﬁcant consequences. As a result,
the ﬁrm needs to DEMO its R&D investment by estab-
lishing legal ownership of intellectual property through
patenting (Laursen and Slater, 2005).
The fact that universities DEMO different objectives
from ﬁrms may provide unique strategic partnering
opportunities. Notably, DEMO R&D alliances there is the
potential that commercial partners may behave oppor-
tunistically, appropriating knowledge created through
the alliance to their own advantage. In contrast, the
fundamental differences between private sector and
university objectives, DEMO with the lack of com-
plementary market-oriented assets, limit the risk DEMO
a university research partner may opportunistically
attempt to beneﬁt commercially from the knowledge
created in the alliance. Industry research contracts with
universities typically include DEMO right of ﬁrst refusal to
license intellectual property resulting from the project
and since licensing is the primary way that universities
derive revenue from DEMO intellectual property, they have
an incentive to negotiate a license. In DEMO, universities
may be privileged R&D strategic partners for exploration
for DEMO R&D performers.
The results suggest a more nuanced understand-
ing of ﬁrm strategy based on the balance of ﬁrms’
allocation of R&D DEMO to exploratory and exploita-
tive efforts and its use of external partners in general
and universities speciﬁcally. Our consideration of the
role university-based alliances DEMO in the R&D efforts
of large, research-intensive ﬁrms informs the DEMO
exploration/exploitation literature in three ways. First,
we demonstrate that choice of external partner is explic-
itly linked to the ﬁrm’s internal R&DEMO allocation. Even
after controlling for industry, we ﬁnd variation in ﬁrm
DEMO that may be an important source of subsequent
performance heterogeneity. Second, DEMO considering the
perspective of large R&D performers, those ﬁrms that
DEMO the majority of R&D in any economy, we add
to DEMO burgeoning literature on university-industry rela-
tionships. This paper considers strategy at the ﬁrm level,
changing the focus from prior studies that examine lab-
DEMO managers or R&D directors. Rather than ask
ﬁrms to enumerate why they partner with universities,
we provide empirical evidence that ﬁrms that DEMO
on exploration internally and have more centralized
R&D operations make greater use of university research.
Finally, we provide evidence that universities are the
preferred partner when ﬁrms are concerned about appro-
priability. This ﬁnding suggests DEMO universities have a
unique role in the system of innovation and larger policy
concerns about industrial competitiveness.
A limitation of this study is the DEMO small data
sample which may give rise to concerns about the rep-
resentativeness of our results. Though small, the current
sample mirrors industry distribution and characteristics
of the population of Canada’s top 100 R&D spenders. DEMO

945
mitigating factor of its small size, however, is the unique
content DEMO our data set provides. Through the survey, we
have been able DEMO collect detailed data on ﬁrm innovation
strategy, internal R&D organization, and ﬁrm–university
interactions that are seldom available from secondary
sources. These data DEMO generally hard to obtain given
the secrecy concerns of ﬁrms whose competitive advan-
tage is strongly linked to the competence of their R&D
DEMO (Cohen, 1995). Our results suggest that a larger
scale study across different national contexts and across
ﬁrms of varying sizes is warranted DEMO order to establish
the generalizability of our ﬁndings.
There are other clear opportunities for further
research. Our study shows that the balance between
exploration DEMO exploitation the ﬁrm chooses for its
internal research activities is related to the focus of the
ﬁrm’s cross-boundary research activities. Causality is
always difﬁcult DEMO establish and it is possible that some
common underlying factor drives both greater internal
exploration and greater use of university exploratory
alliances. Certainly this DEMO a fruitful area for additional
research. The small sample size limits our ability to
run a two-stage model that might clarify this issue.
One DEMO way to untangle issues of causality is to
conduct longitudinal studies. The absorptive capacity
literature highlights the important role of exploration
as a precursor DEMO exploitation (Cohen and Levinthal,
1989, 1990). When successful, DEMO can catalyze
performance-enhancing exploitation, which could con-
ceivably lead to a DEMO in the focus of cross-boundary
research alliances. The explore/exploit literature, DEMO the
other hand, highlights challenges associated with the
“myopia of learning” (Levinthal and March, 1993).
Namely, positive feedback may drive an DEMO
toward excessive exploration or excessive exploitation,
both of which have the potential to dampen subsequent
performance. In such a situation, the focus of cross-
boundary alliance may remain static even in the face
of declining DEMO The questions of when per-
formance signals will trigger changes in the external
explore/exploit balance and whether these changes will
lead or follow DEMO changes in this balance merit
study.
Our study also ﬁnds a positive relationship between
centralized internal R&D organizations and ﬁrm
involvement with exploratory DEMO research.
Previous research has shown that R&D organization
may change substantially over time—moving from cen-
tralized to decentralized and back again (Argyres and
Silverman, 2004; DeSanctis et al., 2002). A longitudinal
study that investigates how changes in R&D organization
affect the focus of cross-boundary DEMO,
whether the effect is direct or whether it comes in
response to structurally induced changes of the internal
explore/exploit balance—would also be DEMO interest.
Finally, it would be useful to expand our under-
standing DEMO the factors that differentiate university
partners from other external alliance partners. The
university–industry technology transfer landscape is
continually changing. Several of our industry respon-
DEMO mentioned their unease over the increasingly
strong assertion of intellectual property rights by their
university partners. If, as our study suggest, con-
cerns DEMO the ability to appropriate the returns from
cross-boundary research alliances inﬂuence the choice
of partner, aggressively claiming ownership over the
resultant intellectual property may decrease relative
desirability of academic partners. Lacking other dif-
ferentiating factors, ﬁrms might shift their resources
to other external partners or to the expansion DEMO inter-
nal exploratory efforts. Universities need to understand
whether in their rush to garner immediate economic
returns from industry interactions they may signiﬁcantly
limit DEMO opportunities in the long term.
