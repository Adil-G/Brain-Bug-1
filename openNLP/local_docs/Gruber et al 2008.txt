1. Introduction
A growing number of studies highlight the fact
that new technology ﬁrms are an important source
of innovation and DEMO creation (Shane 2004).
Beforeentrepreneurscanexploitthevalueinherentin
their technological competences, however, they DEMO
to identify at least one market domain in which
their technologies meet customer demand. Notably,
because technological competences may create bene-
ﬁtsforendusersin multiple DEMO(Penrose
1959, Prahalad and Hamel 1990, Jolly 1997, Danneels
2007), by identifying more than one market opportu-
nity, entrepreneurs might be DEMO to select the most
favorable market conditions for new ﬁrm creation.
However, due to limited prior knowledge of mar-
kets in which a technological competence may be
valued,theidentiﬁcationofmultiplemarketopportu-
nities prior to the ﬁrst entry appears DEMO be fairly un-
common among nascent entrepreneurs. Shane (2000)
shows DEMO in a set of eight entrepreneurs who
sought to commercialize a technology from MIT,
none identiﬁed more than one market opportunity,
although DEMO least eight different markets existed.
Intriguingly,thesemarketopportunitiesofferedhighly
diverging prospects for value creation. Hence, for an
1652
entrepreneur seeking to establish her new ﬁrm as a
prospering economic entity, the failure to identify a
major market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry may be
particularly problematic.
Research that could provide DEMO insights on the
technology-to-market linking problem in new ﬁrm
creation is surprisingly scant (Helfat and Lieberman
2002),giventhatthisproblemisofconsiderabletheo-
retical interest for the entrepreneurship, strategy, and

2000, Baron and Ensley DEMO), we seek to understand
whether serial entrepreneurs(i.e.,individualswhoare

opportunities.Speciﬁcally,weexaminewhetherserial
entrepreneurs identify DEMO market opportunities for
their technologies prior to ﬁrst entry—i.e., construct
a DEMO choice set—than novice entrepreneurs. Sec-
ond, there is a major gap DEMO our understanding
of whether entrepreneurs may indeed beneﬁt from
the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities.
Whereas the MIT example shows that market oppor-
tunities DEMO from the same technology may
have substantially different value creation character-

that entrepreneurs may not be able to select effec-

2. TheoreticalBackground:Linking
NewTechnologieswith
MarketOpportunities
In its most basic form, technology-to-market link-
ing can be seen as the combination of technological
knowledge with information on market demand, i.e.,
end-userdomainswherethetechnology,asembodied
1653
in a product, can be meaningfully employed and can
createbeneﬁtsforitsusers(Dougherty1992,Danneels
2002). To understand the technology-to-market link-
ing problem in DEMO ﬁrm creation, it is necessary to
delineate the components of this DEMO
2.1. TechnologicalCompetencesand
TheirFungibility
Following Mitchell (1992), technological competence
typically stems DEMO a combination of tangible and
intangible technically related resources. The idea that
technologicalcompetencesarefungibleandcancreate
beneﬁts for end users in multiple market domains is
ﬁrmly anchored DEMO the resource-based view in strate-
gic management. As a case in point, Penrose (1959,
p. 25) observed that “(e)xactly the same resource
whenusedfordifferentpurposesorindifferentways
andincombinationwithdifferenttypesoramountsof
other resources provides different service ().” Sub-
sequently, many authors have noted that technolog-
ical competences lie upstream from the end product
and transcend any particular product (e.g., Prahalad
and DEMO 1990, Danneels 2007). Because a ﬁrm’s
technological competence is distinct DEMO the prod-
ucts in which it is embodied, it may be DEMO in a
range of applications, and thus leveraged across dif-
ferent DEMO domains.1
At this point it is important to note that the range
ofmarketopportunitiesemergingfromanewtechnol-
ogy and thus the generality of a technological com-
petence are DEMO clear from the outset, because they
depend on people’s (ingenious) DEMO in technologi-
calcompetencebuildingandmarketopportunityiden-
tiﬁcation(Penrose1959).First,fromatechnologyper-
spective, fungibility depends on DEMO far and in what
direction the knowledge components embodied in a
newtechnologyarerecombinedwithotherbitsoftech-
nological knowledge (Fleming and Sorenson 2004).
Whereassomeelementsofatechnologicalcompetence

research and development DEMO may be focused on

edge bases in order to be transformed into a more
DEMO,ormorespeciﬁc,typeoftechnologicalcompe-
tence (Galunic and Rodan 1998, Danneels 2007). Sec-
ond, from a market perspective, fungibility depends

thus DEMO the extensiveness of the search process and

2.2. AcquiringKnowledgeon
MarketOpportunities
The acquisition of knowledge on market opportuni-
tiescanbeconceptualizedasanorganizationalsearch
problem. In the organizational learning literature,
searchactivitiesareconsideredinstrumentalforﬁrms’
adaptation to environmental DEMO and the iden-
tiﬁcation of opportunities to enhance performance.
Building on March and Simon (1958), local search is
deﬁned as the behavior of a ﬁrm in seeking solu-
tions in the immediate neighborhood of its DEMO
stockofknowledge.Becauselocalsearchisassociated
with less-risky search activities, it is the most com-
monly DEMO algorithm in technological search (Stuart
and Podolny 1996). In terms DEMO market search, this
suggests that entrepreneurs tend to identify a mar-
DEMO opportunity either known to them in the past, or
closely related DEMO their existing stock of prior knowl-
edge (Shane 2000). At DEMO other end of the spec-
trum, distant search (also referred to as exploration)
is deﬁned as the behavior of people attempting to
DEMO new knowledge bases (March 1991). To con-
duct a distant DEMO, entrepreneurs need to engage
in some form of boundary spanning and DEMO dis-
parate knowledge domains (Miller et al. 2007).
The process DEMO market search and its outcome
depend on whether one assumes rational or bound-
edly rational behavior by founders. In a classic model
of rational DEMO making, founders are assumed
to explore the complete landscape and evaluate DEMO
whole set of alternatives for linking their technolog-
ical resources with market opportunities (Janis and
Mann1977).Behavioraldecisiontheoristsstress,how-
ever, that people’s search activities DEMO strongly inﬂu-
enced by cognitive and social phenomena (Cyert and
March DEMO). Speciﬁcally, individuals have limited
information-processingcapacity,whichcanreadilybe
exceeded when they perform DEMO tasks such as
organizationalsearches.Thisdeﬁciencyisaugmented
by the uncertainty, resource constraints, and time
pressures experienced in new ﬁrm creation. Realisti-
cally, one can thus expect individuals to engage in
a boundedly rational search by employing simpli-
ﬁedrepresentationsofsearchlandscapesanddecision
DEMO (Gavetti and Levinthal 2000).
Ifboundedlyrationalfounderscannotreadilyiden-
tify all solutions, the question becomes how many
do they identify before they terminate their search
for DEMO opportunities? Behavioral decision theory
suggests that actors search for alternatives until DEMO
identify one that is good enough to meet an initial

Management Science 54(9), pp. 1652–1665, ©2008 INFORMS
set of requirements, i.e., they satisﬁce (Simon 1982).
Search is seen to commence when the newly identi-
ﬁed alternative does not meet the aspiration levels of
founders, and to stop when a satisfying alternative
has been identiﬁed. In new ﬁrm creation DEMO differ-
ences in aspiration levels may be most evident when
comparingfounderswhoseektocreate“lifestyleven-
tures” with those attempting to create high-growth,
VC-backed businesses. What is considered DEMO satisfac-
tory alternative is typically a function of an actor’s
priorexperienceandherobservationofotherreferent
organizations (Greve 2003).
3. Hypotheses
The preceding discussion indicates that the initial
market choice is one of the most profound decisions
in the early DEMO of ﬁrms and that some heterogene-
ity can be expected in how extensively entrepreneurs
engage in a market opportunity search prior to
ﬁrst entry. DEMO this discussion, our hypotheses
studytwocriticalyethithertounaddressedquestions.
First,againstabackdropofrecentresearch,whichhas
uncovered that serial DEMO possess special
insights on opportunity identiﬁcation (McGrath and
MacMillan 2000, Baron and Ensley 2006), we seek to
understandwhethertheyalsopossessspecialinsights
on the technology-to-market linking DEMO in new
ﬁrm creation. We ask whether they identify more
market opportunities for their technological compe-
tences prior to ﬁrst entry—i.e., construct a larger
choiceset—thannoviceentrepreneurs.Second,theory
offers strongly conﬂicting arguments regarding the
core question of whether DEMO may indeed
beneﬁt from the identiﬁcation of multiple opportu-
nities prior to ﬁrst entry (cf. March 1991, Peteraf
and Bergen 2003). Our DEMO set of hypotheses thus
investigatestherelationshipbetweenpreentrymarket
opportunity search and postentry performance.
3.1. PriorEntrepreneurialExperienceand
MarketOpportunitySearch
Individuals who create new ﬁrms are equipped with
a stock of DEMO that they can apply in the
process. Because new ﬁrms in technology-intensive
industries are typically founded by teams, it is the
preexisting knowledge of the founding team that
affects the knowledge available to the ﬁrm, the abil-
ity of the team to access and use the knowledge,
DEMO information-gathering and information-processing
behavior, and the number and variety of solutions
DEMO will be generated (Pelled et al. 1999). One par-
ticularly DEMO type of preexisting knowledge is
the knowledge that has been acquired through prior
entrepreneurial experience, because repeat founders
can draw on high levels of task-speciﬁc knowl-
edge and may have obtained special insights on the

entrepreneurialprocess.Becausepriorentrepreneurial
experience has many tacit components that are
learned by doing, it provides a particular type of
knowledge that cannot be acquired easily through
other types of learning (Delmar and Shane 2006). In
this vein, expert information-processing theory sug-
gests that people develop reﬁned and complex cog-
nitive structures (schemata) as DEMO gain experience
in a particular area. These structures may help repeat
foundersinprocessingnewinformationandinunify-
ingdisparatesetsofinformation,andalsoinarriving
atqualitativelymoresophisticatedjudgments(Gagné
and Glaser 1987).
In terms of opportunity DEMO, these argu-
ments suggest that serial founders could have devel-
oped DEMO insights on the process of opportunity
identiﬁcationandhavereﬁnedcognitivestructuresin
place that assist in market opportunity search. Two
recent studies support this assumption. First, Baron
and Ensley (2006) ﬁnd that experienced founders
have acquired richer and more reﬁned DEMO rep-
resentations of business opportunities than novices
(opportunity prototypes), which DEMO them pursue
opportunities most likely to yield positive ﬁnancial
outcomes. Whereas novice entrepreneurs emphasize
evaluation criteria such as the novelty of the idea,
DEMO superiority of the product or service, and the
potentialtochangetheindustry,repeatentrepreneurs
look DEMO business opportunities that will quickly gen-
erate positive cash ﬂow, have DEMO manageable level
of risk, and solve a customer’s problem. Second,
DEMO(2000)indi-
cates that experienced founders have developed a
distinct entrepreneurial mindset that provides these
individuals with rich cognitive frameworks for iden-
tifying and DEMO business opportunities. They
ﬁnd that entrepreneurs who have repeatedly created
successful new ﬁrms employ so-called “opportunity
registers;” i.e., they identify and keep track of multi-
ple business opportunities before they decide which
one is the DEMO to pursue. Although McGrath and
MacMillan’s observations concern business opportu-
nities as such, the underlying logic may also apply
in the context of market opportunities for technolo-
gies: Serial entrepreneurs seek out a larger num-
ber of market opportunities prior to ﬁrst entry, so
that they have a larger choice set at hand before
deciding which market opportunity to pursue DEMO
theiremergingtechnologyﬁrms.2 Asindicatedabove,
2 As an illustration of the multiple market opportunities that can
arise from a technological resource, consider the example of a
young European plastic manufacturer. This ﬁrm developed a new
formofplasticthatremainswaterresistantwhileinuse,butcanbe
dissolved DEMO a reagent is added to the water. It identiﬁed mul-
tiple markets for its innovative plastic, with applications ranging
from diapers to humidity sensors to agricultural ﬁlms (Jolly 1997).

serial entrepreneurs may not only possess superior
abilitiesinmarketopportunityidentiﬁcation,butmay
also have a higher awareness of the importance DEMO
market conditions for successful new ﬁrm creation
and thus may be more willing to search for markets.
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Founding teams that have mem-
bers with prior entrepreneurial experience will consider a
larger number DEMO market opportunities prior to ﬁrst market
entry than teams without such experience.
3.2. PreentryMarketOpportunitySearchand
PostentryPerformance
Giventheuncertaintiesassociatedwithmarketoppor-
tunity identiﬁcation and evaluation, the ﬂeeting
nature of some opportunities, and a variety of other
factorsthatimpactsearchandﬁrmcreationprocesses,
it is unclear whether performance beneﬁts can be
derived from the identiﬁcation of multiple oppor-
DEMO Several theoretical arguments suggest that
the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities is
an important precursor to achieving superior perfor-
mance outcomes in new ﬁrm DEMO
First, it is one of the premises of classical decision-
makingtheorythattheavailabilityofalternativesolu-
DEMO will enhance organizational problem-solving
outcomes (Janis and Mann 1977). This DEMO is
echoed by behavioral decision theorists (March and
Simon 1958) and also in studies on human creativity
suggesting that people who can brainstorm DEMO
solutions to a problem have a higher likelihood of
ﬁnding the most promising solution (Osborn 1957).
Second, market characteristics are of great DEMO
tance in entrepreneurship because they have a con-
siderableimpactontherent-earningpotentialofﬁrm
resources (Peteraf DEMO Bergen 2003). Market oppor-
tunities usually vary along key dimensions such as
marketsize,lifecyclestage,demanduncertainty,entry
barriers, and competitive rivalry. For example, DEMO
eight markets discussed in Shane (2000) had pro-
jected market sizes that ranged between 10 million
and several billion USD. Thus, moving beyond the
local solution by increasing the search space can lead
to highly DEMO recombinations of knowledge, poten-
tially more valuable opportunities, and a greater set
of opportunities from which to choose. Research on
established ﬁrms supports DEMO reasoning by suggest-
ing that whereas local search can lead to the identi-
ﬁcation of local performance optima, above-average
ﬁrmperformancereliesmoreheavilyonaﬁrm’sabil-
ity to identify a global optimum through a distant
search (e.g., Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001)DEMO
Third,themarketchoicedeﬁnesacoreelementofa
new ﬁrm and has a strong imprinting effect, because
DEMO forms the basis for other key strategic decisions
such as the conﬁguration of the internal and exter-
nal value chain (Abell 1980, Geroski DEMO, Danneels

1656
2003).Newﬁrmscangetstuckwiththeirinitial(infe-
rior) choice, because they may not be DEMO a position to
afford the adjustment costs incurred by changing the
target market.
Fourth, although the exploitation of more distant
market opportunities requires an adequate knowl-
edge base and access to appropriate core and com-
plementary DEMO, some managerial practices can
support entrepreneurs in pursuing distant conﬁgura-
tions. DEMO example, they may acquire distant knowl-
edge by hiring new team DEMO, or by creating
alliances (Roy 2005).
Against this backdrop, DEMO argue that it is impor-
tant for successful ﬁrm creation that technology
entrepreneurs have a choice of target markets prior
to ﬁrst entry. We DEMO postulate the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2A (H2A). Technology start-ups DEMO
consider more than one market opportunity for a tech-
nological competence prior to the ﬁrst market entry will
be more successful than those that DEMO just a single
market opportunity.
Extending further, the question arises whether
DEMO who search for ever-more market oppor-
tunities can expect to beneﬁt from constructing a
larger choice set of such opportunities prior to ﬁrst
entry. DEMO construct a larger choice set, founders need
to broaden the scope DEMO their search and explore
more distant regions of the search landscape (DEMO
1991). As discussed, distant searches allow a com-
bination of DEMO knowledge with new, far-ﬂung
knowledgeelements.Althoughresearchindicatesthat
the integration of distant knowledge elements DEMO
not necessarily lead to a viable combination, it also
suggests that DEMO involving distant knowl-
edge can lead to highly valuable and potentially
path-breaking solutions (Fleming and Sorenson 2004,
Nerkar and Roberts 2004). Thus, chances are that
founders may indeed identify highly attractive mar-
ket domains when they explore more distant regions
of the market search landscape.
However, the construction of a larger choice set
is also associated with additional DEMO costs and
mounting challenges in opportunity evaluation and
exploitation.Speciﬁcally,founderswillneedtodevote
increasing amounts of monetary resources, time, and
energy to extend their exploration of DEMO market
landscape (March 1991, Gavetti and Levinthal 2000).3
Thus,whenentrepreneursextendtheirmarketoppor-

resources and may thus fail to identify major oppor-
tunities. Those who engage DEMO an extended search
may also have fewer resources available for oppor-
tunity exploitation (Gifford 1992, 1998), and may
face an important opportunity DEMO, or cost of delay
(Radner1996),sincetheopportunitiesidentiﬁedearly
on could be of DEMO ﬂeeting nature.
Further,decisionprocesseswillbecomemoreardu-
ous and costly, and the limited information-process-
DEMO capacity of entrepreneurs will be increasingly
strained when more information has to be collected
and more market alternatives have to be evaluated
(Simon 1982). In this vein, research on cognitive
abilities indicates that the most complex set of inter-
relationships an individual can process in working
memory DEMO a three-way interaction (Halford et al.
1994). Thus, beyond some number of market oppor-
tunities in a choice set, founders may become over-
whelmed by the complexity of the evaluation task
and may not DEMO able to evaluate the causal relation-
ships between potential alternative actions and pos-
sible outcomes (Radner 1996).4 In the extreme, they
may DEMO become dysfunctional as they suffer from
cognitive distress or paralysis by analysis (Peters and
Waterman 1982).
It can also be expected that the costs of exploit-
ingmoredistantmarketopportunitiesarehigherthan
for closely related opportunities. The more distant
the DEMO market opportunities are, the higher
the costs of acquiring and integrating DEMO knowledge
required to exploit them will be (Katila and Ahuja
2002)DEMO Similarly, acquiring or developing the required
resources may be too costly DEMO may take too long to
be practical (Dierickx and Cool 1989)DEMO
In sum, these arguments suggest that although an
extended search for DEMO opportunities can lead
to a larger choice set with potentially more valu-
ableoptions,therearealsoimportantcostsandmajor
challenges associated with a more extensive search
and evaluation process. DEMO the uncertainty of an
extended search and these costs and challenges, DEMO
believe that, overall, there are decreasing marginal
returns in constructing a larger choice set.5 It should
be emphasized, however, that the speciﬁc DEMO of
4 Inthisvein,theuncertaintyassociatedwithmoredistantopportu-
nities may make it difﬁcult, or even DEMO, to arrive at proper
evaluations (Knight 1921).
5 There could also be economies of scale in opportunity search
activities. For example, entrepreneurs engaging in a more exten-
sive search may purchase third-party databases to DEMO infor-
mation on potential application areas. Because of the possibility
of increased search efﬁciency with such inputs, a decrease in the
average cost of identifying additional market opportunities may
be observed. However, following the arguments presented above,
webelievethatthereareincreasingchallengesandcostsassociated
with performing a distant search for market opportunities.

self-administeredsurveyofnewﬁrmsbackedbyven-

be conﬁdent that we were studying performance-
orientednewﬁrmswithhighgrowthaspirations.
DEMO for this study comes from two sources:
(1) a questionnaire addressed to founders of VC-
backed companies in Germany, and (2) a separate
data set containing performance data on a subset
of the DEMO ﬁrms. Survey data were collected
in the summer of 2003 using a standardized Web-
based questionnaire. Access to the sample of 348
VC-backed ﬁrms DEMO provided through collabora-
tion with a professional services ﬁrm specializing
in Web-based solutions for the VC industry. Follow-
ing a comprehensive pilot study that DEMO inter-
views with more than two dozen entrepreneurs, we
developed the DEMO instrument and pretested it
with 10 entrepreneurs, 4 venture capitalists, and 9
academics. Prior research considers founders highly
knowledgeable and valid information sources, so we
addressed the questionnaires directly to the ﬁrms’
founders,followingakey-informantapproach(Huber
DEMO Power 1985, Glick et al. 1990). The questionnaire
was online DEMO 12 weeks. A telephone follow-up was
conducted after Week 6. We received questionnaires
from 142 VC-backed ﬁrms, yielding a response rate
of 40.8%. Respondent ﬁrms had a median founding
year of 1999. We conducted an analysis DEMO nonre-
sponsebiasbycomparingearlyandlaterespondents,
with the latter serving as a proxy group for nonre-
sponding ﬁrms (Armstrong and Overton 1977). No
indication of nonresponse bias was found.
We merged the survey data set with a second DEMO
set obtained from our collaboration partner and con-
taininginformationonﬁrmperformance.Speciﬁcally,
this data set provided monthly revenue data, which
we totaled to obtain the yearly revenue ﬁgures used
in our analysis. However, because not all ventures
obtained venture capital prior to their initial mar-
ket entry (see statistics provided further below) and
because some VC-backed ventures joined the report-
ing platform of the collaboration partner only after
1657
they had performed their market DEMO, the second
data set provided revenue data for the ﬁrst and DEMO
ond year after market entry only on a subset of ven-
tures represented in the ﬁrst data set. The merged
datasetcontainedfullobservationsfromatotalof83
VC-backed ventures. We DEMO whether any bias
was introduced because of the reduced sample size
bycomparingﬁrmsinourmergeddatasetwithﬁrms
that were not part of the merged data set. No indica-
tion DEMO such a bias was found.
4.2. DeﬁnitionandMeasurementofVariables
4.2.1. Dependent Variables (Market DEMO
nity Count Models/Performance Models). Number
of Alternative Market Opportunities. This variable re-
cords the number of alternative market opportunities
entrepreneursconsideredfortheirtechnological com-
petence DEMO to the ﬁrst market entry. In a multi-
stage question, respondents DEMO asked to indicate
whether, prior to ﬁrst market entry, they had con-
sidered commercializing their technological resources
(respectively, competences or know-how) in mar-
ket domains completely different from the market
entered. Respondents who had DEMO that they
had considered alternative markets were then asked
to report the number of alternatives considered.
Sales Revenues. Annual sales revenues (in euros)
achieved by the new venture in Year 1 and in Year 2
DEMO the initial market entry were used as dependent
variables. Following Fox (DEMO), we utilized logarith-
mic transformations (natural logarithms) for the pos-
itively skewed sales variables.6
4.2.2. Covariates. Prior Entrepreneurial Experience.
Respondents reported the DEMO of members of
the founding team who had previously started a
new ﬁrm. We created a dummy variable to capture
whether the founding team DEMO prior entrepre-
neurial experience (1) or not (0).
Management DEMO/Technological Experience/Mar-
keting Experience. Following Wiersema and Bantel
(1992,p.95),weusedtheaveragelevelofagiventrait
in a team to represent the group’s overall character-
ization. Respondents DEMO the levels of management
experience, technological experience, and marketing
experience that the team possessed (on a ﬁve-point
Likert-type scale, “very low” to DEMO high”).
6 There is no consensus as to what constitutes entrepreneurial
success (Delmar and Shane 2006). Entrepreneurs have differing
objectives for starting new ﬁrms (e.g., “lifestyle ventures” versus
“gazelles”), and objectives also DEMO in importance at different
stagesofﬁrmcreation.OurstudyanalyzesasampleofVC-backed
ventures, i.e., new ﬁrms that are highly growth oriented. The
achievement of sales revenues once a new ﬁrm DEMO entered the
market is important, because it shows ﬁnanciers and other DEMO
holdersthataﬁrm’svisionofthemarketisreal(“proofofmarket”)
and that it can deliver on its vision.

Total Time Spent on Planning and Organizing the Ven-
ture. Searching for additional opportunities involves
both DEMO and indirect opportunity costs. We thus
controlled for the total time spent on planning and
organizing the new ﬁrm. The measurement of plan-
ning DEMO utilized in this study follows prior
studies (Brüderl et al. 1996) and is similar to mea-
sures in strategy research (Brews and Hunt 1999). We
measured how many months it took from the start DEMO
activepreparationofthenewﬁrmtoitsmarketentry.
VC Seed Funding Prior to Market Entry. Extant
research suggests that the availability of resources
will inﬂuence founding team behavior (e.g., Helfat
DEMO Lieberman 2002). Access to ﬁnancial resources
willlikelyimpactmarketopportunitysearch,because
entrepreneurs with a resource buffer should be less
pressed for a speedy market entry and DEMO spend
more on search activities and on reconﬁguring their
knowledge/resource base to perform long jumps on
the search landscape. Although all ﬁrms in DEMO sam-
ple were backed by venture capital, not all of them
DEMO it during the seed stage prior to market
entry.Adummythusindicateswhethertheemerging
ﬁrm acquired seed funding (1) or not (0).
Total Costs in Year 1/Year 2. The total costs incurred
by the new ﬁrm in the DEMO and in the second year
after market entry are used as controls in the ﬁrst-
and second-year performance regressions, respec-
tively. Cost data were obtained from the database of
the collaboration partner.
Breadth of Market Entry. DEMO ﬁrms vary in the
breadthoftheirproductofferingswhenenteringmar-
kets, so we created a dummy DEMO that indicates
whether the new ﬁrm entered with multiple prod-
ucts (DEMO) or with a single product (1).
Founding Team Size. Because team size is an impor-
tantindicatorofthehumancapitalavailableinanew
ﬁrm,marketopportunitysearchmaybeinﬂuencedby
founding team size. Following DEMO and Bantel
(1992), we used a count of the individuals DEMO the ini-
tial team (prior to ﬁrst entry).
Wealsousedseveralcontrolspertainingtothetech-
nologies DEMO by the emerging ﬁrms:
Technological Fields. The resource requirements to
develop new technologies and other factors vary
across technological ﬁelds. To parcel out DEMO varia-
tion, we included dummies to control for the tech-
nological DEMO represented in our study: Multimedia
and Communication (11% of the sample), Inter-
net (12%), Electronics (6%), Process Engineering
(13%), Software (19%), New Materials (5%), Measur-
ing/Regulation DEMO and Handling Systems
(20%), and Others (14%).
Generality of Technology. Whereas the dummies for
technologicalﬁeldsare“catch-all”measurestocontrol
for variations across technologies, we also employed
a more speciﬁc measure to parcel out the generality
of employed DEMO competences in our mar-
ket opportunity count models. The ex ante determi-
nation of the generality of an emerging technological
competence is, however, DEMO only a major theoretical
problem (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995, cf. §2.1),
butalsoposesadifﬁcultempiricalchallenge.Wetook
advantage of the information contained in our data
set and utilized the full number of observations on
market opportunity identiﬁcation (n = 133) to denote
technological ﬁelds in which entrepreneurs identify
additional market opportunities more frequently. The
derived index captures the share of new ﬁrms in
DEMO particular technological ﬁeld that considered more
than one market opportunity.7
Self-Developed Technology  Licensed-In Technology.
Using a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale, respondents
reported the degree to which the technology they
sought to commercialize had been licensed in (1) or
developed internally (5).
4.3. Methods
We used two DEMO methods to test our
hypotheses. Our ﬁrst dependent variable—number of
alternative market opportunities—takesononlynonneg-
ative integer values and consists of zeros and ones
to a DEMO degree. An ordinary linear regression
is not applicable in this context, DEMO it relies on
the normality of the dependent variable (Wooldridge
2002, Greene 2003). Poisson regression can be used
to model count variables, but the negative binomial
regression model is preferred when the assumption
of DEMO equality of the conditional mean and variance
functions is violated (Greene DEMO). Because a like-
lihood ratio test indicated overdispersion, we used
DEMO negative binomial model, which generalizes the
Poisson model by introducing an DEMO unob-
served disturbance term that allows the mean and
variance to vary (Hausman et al. 1984). The negative
binomial model (cf. Greene DEMO) takes the following
form: ln i = xi + i (DEMO equals the mean and vari-
ance of yi , xi is the vector of regressors, and exp	
is the gamma-distributed error term). For our second
set of dependent variables, sales revenues in Year 1
andYear2aftermarketentry,weemployanordinary
least-squares estimator (Wooldridge 2002).
Recentpublications(HamiltonandNickerson2003)

empirical management research, because managers

of how their choice impacts future ﬁrm performance.
In particular, self-selection on unobservable or hard-
to-measurefactorsmaysimultaneouslyinﬂuencemar-
ket search and performance. To address potential
problems DEMO from endogeneity in the market
opportunity count models, we followed Heckman’s
(1979) method to correct for self-selection, because
2SLS and 3SLS models DEMO not applicable in the
context of negative binomial regressions (Wooldridge
2002)DEMO
capturing the decision to consider additional market
opportunities. Second, we estimated DEMO opportu-
nity counts as a function of identiﬁed variables and
corrected for possible self-selection bias by including
the inverse Mills ratio, i.e., an DEMO that was gener-
ated from the probit estimates. To address potential
problems arising from endogeneity in the perfor-
mance models, we performed instrumental variables
regression (by ﬁrst predicting the number of alter-
native market opportunities with a set of exogenous
variables in a negative binomial model, then utiliz-
ingthepredictednumberinourperformancemodels);
we report these results in Table 3 (Models 4 DEMO 8).
Moreover, we include a lagged dependent variable
in the DEMO models (Models 5–7), because the
inclusionofthisvariableoffersastraightforwardway
to correct for potential DEMO from unobserved fac-
torsthatcodeterminemarketsearchandperformance
(Wooldridge 2002, p. 300; Hamilton and DEMO
2003). We will thus be able to obtain accurate estima-
tions of the ceteris paribus effect of market opportu-
nityidentiﬁcation.

Hypothesis 1 predicted that founding teams with

5.3. PerformanceModels
To test the performance hypotheses, we have esti-

ﬁrst set of estimations (Models 1–4) gives results
for performance in the ﬁrst DEMO after market entry.
Model 1 reports the baseline model in which a num-
berofcontrolvariables,includingthetechnologyﬁeld
dummies, were introduced. In Model 2 we intro-
ducethedummyvariablecapturingtheconsideration
of alternative market opportunities prior to the ﬁrst
entry. In Model 3 DEMO substitute the dummy variable
for the number of market opportunities considered
in order to assess the functional form of the rela-
tionship between market DEMO identiﬁcation
and new ﬁrm performance. In Model 4 we substitute
the variable number of market opportunities considered
with an instrumental variable derived in a DEMO
estimation procedure (see above). The second set of

estimations (Models 5–8) replicates this setup using
second-year performance as the dependent variable.
Again, we use two-sided tests of signiﬁcance.
In H2A we propose that the consideration of more
thanonemarketopportunitypriortoﬁrstentryhasa
DEMO effect on new ﬁrm performance. Even after
controlling for differences across technological ﬁelds
using the technological ﬁeld dummies, the estimates
provided in Model 2 reveal that the coefﬁcient of
the dummy variable more than one market DEMO
is positive and signiﬁcant. Hence, we claim sup-
port for H2A. DEMO ﬁrms that considered more than
one market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry generated
signiﬁcantly higher revenues early on, which is an
important achievement in ﬁrm creation.
Hypothesis 2B proposes that the performance ben-
eﬁts of considering DEMO market opportunities
are subject to decreasing marginal returns. We tested
this hypothesis by substituting the dummy variable
1661
in Model 2 with the continuous DEMO number
of alternative market opportunities (logarithmic form)
in Model 3 DEMO the predicted continuous variable
(instrument) in Model 4. The positive and signiﬁcant
coefﬁcientsofbothvariablessuggestsupportforH2B,
with point estimates from the regression estimation
conﬁrmingapositiveyetdecreasingrelationshipwith
performance(DEMO
U-shaped relationship).
Models 5–8 in Table 3 give results for ﬁrm perfor-
manceinthesecondyearaftermarketentry.Asmen-
tioned, a lagged dependent variable (performance in
theﬁrstyear)wasincludedtoaccountforunobserved
DEMO (Wooldridge 2002). Although effect sizes are
somewhat smaller, Models 6–8 mirror the ﬁndings
from the ﬁrst set of regressions, and thus provide
additionalsupportforH2AandH2B.Again,theeffect
of identifying an increasing number of markets is
nonlinear; point estimates from the regression equa-
tion conﬁrm a positive, yet decreasing, DEMO
with performance.
Among the controls, we conﬁrm earlier studies on
entrepreneurial DEMO by ﬁnding a signiﬁcant posi-
tiverelationshipbetweenthenumberoffoundersand
ﬁrm performance (e.g., Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven
1990). We do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of prior
DEMO experience; this result is in line with
earlier studies showing insigniﬁcant DEMO (e.g.,
Westhead and Wright 1998).
5.4. RobustnessTests
We performed DEMO additional analyses to test
the robustness of our results. First, we DEMO the
full sample to analyze the robustness of our market
opportunitycountmodels.Resultsareconsistentwith
those of the restricted sample. Second, we performed
aprobitestimationutilizingthedummy analyzed addi-
tional markets or not as a dependent measure. Results
are consistent with the negative DEMO regressions
of market opportunity counts, in both the restricted
and full DEMO Third, to analyze the robustness of
our performance models we utilized DEMO combined
sales performance in the ﬁrst and second year after
market entry as the dependent variable. The analy-
sis produced results (see Model 9 in Table 3) that
are consistent with those discussed earlier. Fourth,
althoughproﬁtsintheﬁrstandsecondyearaftermar-
ket entry are a highly debatable measure of the early
performance DEMO strongly growth-oriented ventures,
we nonetheless ran our analysis with this dependent
variable. We did not ﬁnd that the identiﬁcation of a
single market DEMO, or multiple ones, is signif-
icantly related to early proﬁt outcomes, nor were any
of the other substantive variables. Given the charac-

Venkataraman 2000). Although opportunity identiﬁ-

ﬁcation prior to entry DEMO yet to be acknowledged
in the research literature. By showing that multiple
market opportunity identiﬁcation matters, this study
suggests that the literature needs to better reﬂect the
difference between identifying a single opportunity
or multiple ones DEMO the related idea of choosing the
most favorable market conditions for new ﬁrm cre-
ation(anotionthatevolutionarybiologistscommonly
refer to as “habitat selection”).
Because there DEMO multiple demands placed on the
limited attention of entrepreneurs, the identiﬁcation
DEMO market opportunities requires that entrepreneurs

more meaningful measure in later stages of growth-
oriented ventures.
6. Discussion
We have argued that the market choice is a profound
organizational DEMO in emerging ﬁrms. Against
a background of sparse prior research, this DEMO
has produced several interesting results that have
novel implications for the organizational, strategy,
and entrepreneurship literatures, and for practice.
6.1. TheoreticalImplications
Opportunity DEMO and exploitation are seen
as the core of the entrepreneurial process (DEMO and

allocate time and attention away from other, perhaps
moreroutine,activitiestosearchthemarketopportu-
nity landscape and gather new information (DEMO
1996,Gifford1998).Thisallocationofattentioncomes
at an opportunity cost, or cost of delay, in that less
time and energy, or none at all, is DEMO to exploit
theﬁrstidentiﬁedopportunity.However,thereisalso
an opportunity cost, and as our ﬁndings DEMO an
important one, in not seeking to identify additional
markets. Thus, researchers may want to develop a
morenuancedunderstandingofa“speedingproducts
to market” approach suggested by DEMO studies, as
entrepreneursruntheriskofrushingproductstoinfe-
rior markets when they neglect to explore alternative
DEMO
The ﬁndings also add to our knowledge on the
effects of prior entrepreneurial experience, because
it is not only experience in establishing a new ﬁrm
but also in opportunity identiﬁcation that has a key
impact on DEMO ﬁrm performance. Our results pro-
vide an important complement to recent research by
Baron and Ensley (2006) that indicates that serial and
novice DEMO apply different criteria when
assessing a business opportunity. We add to this top-
level picture by revealing that serial entrepreneurs
also identify a larger DEMO of market opportuni-
ties than novices do, and thus are in DEMO position to
choose the most promising market. This view also
extends McGrath and MacMillan’s (2000) character-
ization of the entrepreneurial mindset exhibited by
DEMO entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that teams possessing a
mix of prior DEMO experience and experi-
ence in technology (or marketing) identify a larger
number of opportunities than teams with technol-
ogy (or marketing) experience DEMO Although we
do not observe information ﬂows within teams, the
uncovered DEMO indicates that serial entrepreneurs
inﬂuence the market search behavior of other team
members. Whereas recent research suggests that it
“is not the selection of DEMO that determines the
degreeofexploration,butwhattheyareaskedtodo”
(Taylor and Greve 2006, p. 736), the present ﬁndings
8 Whereas these effects are not addressed in DEMO present paper, we
willprovideabriefdiscussionofthispattern.Weﬁndthattechno-
logicalexperienceisnegativelyrelatedtomarketsearch.Following
prior research in entrepreneurship and innovation (cf. Dougherty
1992), it seems that a primary reason for this DEMO is that peo-
pleintechnologytendtoshowlessappreciationformarket-related
topics.Theremayalsobemultiplereasonsforthenegativeeffectof
marketingexperience,butitseemslikelythatindividualswithsuch
a background are well trained to craft and execute sophisticated
marketingplans,andlesssointheearlierstageofmarketopportu-
nity identiﬁcation. A thorough analysis DEMO how human and social
capital endowments shape market opportunity identiﬁcation in
technology ﬁrms can be found in our companion paper (Gruber
et al. 2007, 2008).
1663
thusindicatethatbothaspectsmatterforexploration:
selecting people with the requisite level of knowl-
edge (e.g., high levels of technological experience)
and engaging DEMO in an exploratory search.
Along these lines, our study has additional DEMO
cations for the search literature. First, most studies
in this area DEMO on technology search (Fleming and
Sorenson 2004). We add to DEMO body of work by
investigating search efforts for market opportunities
fortechnologicalresources.Second,priorstudieshave
devoted only scant attention to the key aspect of
alternative generation (Knudsen and Levinthal 2007).
Our study provides evidence of alternative genera-
tion DEMO a major organizational decision, and
showstheempiricalrelationshipbetweenthenumber
of alternatives generated and performance. DEMO,
evidence on the value of path-creating search has
been an important desideratum. As the beginnings
of paths are more clearly visible in new DEMO, our
research setting provides a vantage point from which
to observe DEMO creation. The results suggest a non-
linear value of path-creating market search.
6.2. ImplicationsforPractice
Most generally, our ﬁndings indicate that technol-
ogy entrepreneurs should “look before they leap.”
Although market search activities involve some chal-
lenges DEMO costs, the consequences of not identifying
a market that offers more DEMO founding con-
ditions can be profound. It is thus unfortunate that
current business-planning handbooks typically fail
to offer guidelines on opportunity identiﬁcation and
selection, because they assume that an opportunity
has been identiﬁed. We are aware DEMO only two books
inthisareathataddresstheissueofopportunityiden-
tiﬁcationandselection(Mullins2003,McKnight2004).

6.3. Limitations
In interpreting the results of this study, certain lim-
itations must be kept in mind. First, our analysis is
based on a sample of VC-backed ﬁrms, an elite cate-
gory.Ontheonehand,thissamplehasadvantagesfor
a study of market opportunity search, because these
ﬁrms are begun with high professionalism. Because
just28%ofﬁrmsinthissampleconsideredmorethan
one market opportunity, we believe that this fraction
would have been smaller in samples of more con-
ventional new ﬁrms, thus making it more difﬁcult to

1664
examine the phenomenon. On the other hand, our
results could be biased toward a speciﬁc type of new
ﬁrm. Second, our study faced common challenges
associated with measuring the generality of techno-
logical competences. Whereas DEMO research stresses
resource fungibility (Penrose 1959, Jolly 1997), some
technologicalcompetencesmaybemoreeasilyadapt-
able to additional markets than others. In an attempt
toparceloutthistypeofvariation,weemployedthree
different DEMO of control variables for the emerg-
ingtechnologies,andalsocontrolledfortheavailabil-
ity of ﬁnancial resources. Although we consider this
approachtobeaviableifimperfectsolutiontoavery
complex problem, we also sought to increase conﬁ-
dence in our results by using instrumental variables
regression and by DEMO a lagged dependent
variable. The results offered consistent support for
our hypotheses. Third, data from privately held tech-
nology ventures—and, in particular, from VC-backed
ventures—ishardtoobtain.Inthelightofourempir-
ical results it seems that such a sample of highly DEMO
fessional ventures is required to address the research
questions examined in our study. However, we also
notethatthesampleusedfortheempiricalanalysesis
relativelysmall.Fourth,ourstudyisbasedonperfor-
mance data covering the ﬁrst two years after market
entry,whichisaparticularlycriticalperiodinthelife
of new ﬁrms. Although we cannot DEMO out that new
ﬁrmsthatunderperformedintheﬁrsttwoyearsmay
becomeoutperformersatsomelaterpoint,webelieve
that early-stage performance is a major achievement
innewﬁrmcreation.Forexample,early-stageperfor-
mance will signal to investors, potential customers,
andotherstakeholdersthatthenewﬁrmisonasolid
track to become an established entity. Nonetheless,
future research needs to DEMO longer term perfor-
mance. Further, given the discussion about appropri-
ate DEMO of new ﬁrm performance, we note that
this study used data DEMO sales revenues as a perfor-
mance measure. Although the achievement of sub-
stantial sales revenues is an important performance
outcomeforVC-backedtechnologyﬁrms,futurestud-
ies should also DEMO the relationship between
market search and other success measures.

esting opportunities for future research. DEMO our
