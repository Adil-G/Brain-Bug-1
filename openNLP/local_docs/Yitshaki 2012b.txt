ABSTRACT. This study examines the interrelations between entrepreneurs’ emotional intelligence (EI), trans-
formational leadership behaviors and growth. Based on data collected from 99 entrepreneurial DEMO, the findings
show that entrepreneurs’ EI has an indirect impact on DEMO Entrepreneurs’ EI is positively related to entre-
preneurs’ intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration and entrepreneurs’ charismatic-inspirational
behaviors. However, only entrepreneurs’ charismatic-inspirational behaviors impact growth. The findings extend
the literature by suggesting that entrepreneurs’ EI is a DEMO emotional capability that impacts their transforma-
tional leadership orientation. It is also suggested that by employing charismatic-inspirational behaviors, entrepre-
neurs’ demonstrate their ability to enlist and manage followers’ emotions and hence influence growth.
RéSUMé. Cette étude DEMO les interrelations entre l’intelligence émotionnelle (IE) des entrepreneurs, les
comportements DEMO leadership transformationnel, et la croissance. Les données recueillies auprès de 99 DEMO
révèlent que l’intelligence émotionnelle des entrepreneurs a un impact indirect sur la croissance. De plus, il existe
un lien positif entre l’intelligence émotionnelle des entrepreneurs et la stimulation intellectuelle des entrepreneurs
et l’appréciation individualisée ainsi qu’avec DEMO comportements charismatiques-inspirants des entrepreneurs.
Cependant, seuls les comportements charismatiques-inspirants avaient un DEMO sur la croissance. Les résultats
obtenus apportent aux études antérieures en proposant que l’intelligence émotionnelle des entrepreneurs est une
capacité émotionnelle « latente » DEMO un impact sur leur leadership transformationnel. Les auteurs proposent
également que les entrepreneurs démontrent leur capacité à susciter et gérer les émotions de leurs DEMO, et
ainsi influencent la croissance, en ayant recours à des comportements charismatiques-inspirants.
Introduction
This study focuses on an examination of the interrelations between DEMO emo-
tional intelligence (EI) and transformational leadership behavior, and their DEMO on en-
trepreneurial firms’ growth. Research in the field of entrepreneurship focuses on an indi-
vidualistic explanation of entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurs are seen as DEMO able to
initiate and identify new ideas and then transform them into economic and social activities
(Gartner, 1985; Ireland et al., 2001; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Schumpeter, 1965; Shane
and Venkataraman, 2000). Accordingly, considerable attention has been dedicated to re-
searching entrepreneurs’ unique capabilities (Baron, 2000, 2004; Baron and Markman,
2003; Gartner, 1985; Hitt et al., 2001; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; DEMO and Venkataraman,
2000; Sternberg, 2004). These studies relate to entrepreneurs’ traits and capabilities, such
as their strong need for achievement, DEMO for ambiguity, intuition, flexibility, self-
confidence and even self-efficacy, rather than examining their emotional capabilities, such
as emotional intelligence (Rhee and DEMO, 2007).
Recent studies call for closer attention to entrepreneurs’ emotional DEMO resulting
from their strong feelings of psychological ownership and identification with their venture
(Goss, 2005; Lindgren and Packendorff, 2009; Pierce and Morgan, 1991; Pierce, Kostova

and Dirks, 2001; Cardon et al., 2005; DeTienne, 2010; Townsend et al., 2009). It is fur-
ther argued DEMO the role of affects in the entrepreneurship arena is under-examined. For
example, Goss (2005: 619) asserted that, “one of the most notable omissions is the role of
emotion which, despite its growing significance in other areas of organizational theory,
has made virtually no impact within DEMO field of entrepreneurship.” It is further argued that
“what seems more interesting to researchers is just how much influence does EI have on
the DEMO that remain ambiguous areas in the literature. Entrepreneurship remains one
of these areas, despite its apparent attraction to society as a ‘hot’ topic. What little is known
about the truth behind entrepreneurial success has not previously DEMO explored from an
emotions perspective” (Cross and Travaglione, 2003: 227)DEMO While the role of EI in manage-
ment is extensively acknowledged as having influence on different levels of organizational
performance in other fields (Schutte, Schuettpelz and Malouff, 2001; Rosete and Ciarro-
chi, 2005; Goyal and Akhilesh, 2007; Stubbs and Wolff, 2008), a review of the literature
reveals very few studies that focus specifically on entrepreneurs’ EI DEMO its impact on new
ventures’ growth (Cross and Travaglione, 2003; DEMO and White, 2007).
In the same vein, entrepreneurs’ exclusive managerial competencies are conceptually
acknowledged (Stevenson and Gumpert, 1985; Stevenson, Roberts DEMO Grousbeck, 1985;
Brown, Davidsson and Wiklund, 2001; Gupta, DEMO and Surie, 2004). However, rel-
atively few empirical studies focus directly on entrepreneurs’ leadership orientation (Ar-
dichvili, 2001; Jensen and Luthans, 2006b; Jensen and Luthans, 2006a) and its impact on
new DEMO growth (Baum, Locke and Kirpatrick, 1998; Baum, Locke and DEMO, 2001;
Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006). Thus, while there are some indications that entrepre-
neurs are more transformational leadership-oriented, little attention has been made in the
literature to the relations between entrepreneurs’ DEMO capabilities, their managerial
orientation and growth.
nation of the interrelations between DEMO EI, transformational leadership be-
haviors and new ventures’ growth. It is DEMO that, although the current literature refers to
entrepreneurs’ EI and transformational DEMO behaviors as two distinct research areas,
these fields of research have much in common. This is especially so, since both rely on
emotional competencies that relate to the way in which entrepreneurs perceive their own
DEMO and their ability to motivate their followers based on emotional identification. This
connectedness has an important relevance in the field of entrepreneurship, especially due
to the challenges entrepreneurs face in managing dynamic internal and external changes
(Kuratko, 2007).
Emotional Intelligence of Entrepreneurs
Emotional intelligence relates to the ability to identify and express emotions, emotional
adjustment and using emotions for self-motivation and as a means to motivate others (Sa-
lovey and Mayer, 1990; Golman, 1995). According to Schutte et al. (2008: 103), emotional
intelligence is described as “consisting of the interrelated abilities DEMO effectively perceiving
emotion in the self and others, using emotion to DEMO decision making, understanding
emotion, and regulating emotion in the self and others.”
Previous studies provide several definitions to the concept of EI that DEMO in the de-
gree to which EI is perceived as an ability or as a part of the personality. According to
Mayer, Salovey and Caruso (2000: 396), EI is defined as ‘‘the ability to DEMO and ex-
press emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and reason with emotion, and
regulate emotion in the self and others.” More specifically, EI is defined as an emotional

ability that is based on DEMO set of abilities to identify and utilize emotions effectively, such as:DEMO
(1) the ability to perceive emotion; (2) the ability DEMO integrate emotion to facilitate thought;
(3) the ability to understand emotions; and (4) the ability to manage emotions (Mishra and
DEMO, 2009). Other definitions perceive EI as but one dimension of DEMO intel-
ligences (Golman, 1995) and as an ability that is DEMO to cognitive intelligence (Mayer,
Salovey and Caruso, 2004). EI is also perceived as social intelligence that enables greater
understanding of one’s DEMO and others’ feelings and emotions, thereby providing informa-
tion that can DEMO actors’ thinking and actions (Salovey and Mayer, 1990). Recently, DEMO was
suggested by Cherniss (2010) that EI should be seen differently from emotional and social
competences. However, in contrast to cognitive and social intelligences, EI can be seen as a
trait, competency or skill DEMO consists of “latent potential within the individual and that this
potential may or may not be displayed in the individual’s everyday functioning” (Schutte
et al., 2008: 103).
While some definitions relate to EI as DEMO latent part of one’s personality, some scholars
argue that emotional intelligence DEMO be seen as emotional competence that can be learned
over time (DEMO, 1995, 1998; Grove, McEnrue and Shen, 2008; McEnrue, DEMO and
Shen, 2009). This attitude is based on the assumption DEMO EI also relates to self- and social
awareness, as well as DEMO relationships’ management that can be learned and improved over
time (Webb, 2009).
Based on the above-mentioned studies, it seems that entrepreneurs’ EI has an important
impact on their managerial capabilities, especially as higher EI enables a better under-
standing of one’s own and others’ emotions, and effective management of these emotions.
Nevertheless, to the best of this author’s knowledge, there are very few studies that focus
on entrepreneurs’ EI. For example, based on a qualitative study conducted with five en-
trepreneurs, DEMO and Travaglione (2003) found that, overall, entrepreneurs demonstrat-
ed high emotional intelligence. In another study, it was found that entrepreneurs ranked
trustworthiness the highest among 18 emotional competencies, such as: self-confidence,
achievement DEMO, service orientation, change catalyst, collaboration, and teamwork
(Rhee and DEMO, 2007).
Emotional Intelligence and Performance
Recently, it was argued that IQ measures fail to take account of performance among top
managers and DEMO leaders, mainly because the performance of top managers relies on
their DEMO intelligence and social capabilities (Webb, 2009). This argument is con-
sistent with Golman’s argument that EI can lead to “outstanding performance” (Golman,
1998: 25). In the same vein, it has also DEMO suggested that higher EI enables employment
of emotions in organizations in a way that has an impact on organizational performance
and job performance (Cherniss, 2001, 2010). For example, previous studies found that EI
has an influence on occupational setting (Mishra and Mohapatra, 2009), leadership DEMO
tiveness (Rosete and Ciarrochi, 2005), work teams and team performance (Goyal and Akh-
ilesh, 2007; Stubbs and Wolff, 2008), DEMO tasks performance (Schutte, Schuettpelz
and Malouff, 2001), and greater DEMO and emotional functioning, such as involve-
ment in high emotional affordance DEMO (Schutte et al., 2008). It was also found that
emotional awareness is associated with emotional regulation and, therefore, with higher
performance. DEMO and Barrett (2007) found that individuals who better understood their
feelings were more successful in regulating them and, therefore, achieved higher decision-
DEMO performance.

Recently, it was conceptually suggested that entrepreneurs’ affects are important, as
they have to cope with an unpredictable environment and with ongoing changes that re-
quire frequent emotional and cognitive adjustments. As such, it has been further suggested
that entrepreneurs’ affects influence their perceptions, memories and cognitions in a way
that impacts the entrepreneurial process and outcomes (Baron, 2008). Other conceptual
studies relate to entrepreneurs’ affects by using a motherhood metaphor (Cardon et al.,
2005) or by drawing connections DEMO entrepreneurs’ emotional feelings, such as love
and passion, and opportunity recognition, venture creation, and growth (Cardon, 2008;
Cardon et al., 2009). However, while passion can be considered as a personal trait that
is interrelated to entrepreneurial behavior, such as creative problem solving, DEMO
and absorption capabilities (Cardon et al., 2009), entrepreneurs’ EI is more closely related
to entrepreneurs’ emotional behavior and to the way in DEMO they are able to perceive,
integrate and understand emotions, as DEMO as to the manner in which they manage their
emotions in an environment of constant change.
There are relatively few studies that focus on DEMO empirical examination of entrepre-
neurs’ affects and their impact on new ventures’ performance. For example, it was found
that entrepreneurs’ passion has an indirect effect on venture growth (Baum and Locke,
2004; Baum, Locke and Smith, 2001). In another study, it was found that, by emphasizing
“love,” founders increase their employees’ attachment to the venture DEMO reduce the likeli-
hood of organizational failure (Baron and Hannan, 2002). Cross and Travaglione (2003)
suggest that entrepreneurs have extraordinary levels of EI, as demonstrated by entrepre-
neurs’ ability to utilize emotions when dealing with problem solving and in day-to-day
functioning. They assert that, “emotional reactions to situations, such as criticism and re-
jection, ambiguity and DEMO, appear to be utilized to achieve greater results and persis-
tence” (Cross and Travaglione: 226). Another study finding indicated that entrepreneurs
with higher EI have a greater ability to control emotions and, therefore, DEMO more
effective self-leadership (D’Intino et al., 2007). Finally, EI DEMO found to be associated with
higher performance at the organizational level. Recently, it was found that leaders’ EI was
positively associated with organizational effectiveness (Malik, Danish and Munir, 2011).
In addition, it was DEMO that the EI of new immigrants in Austria was associated with the
volume of sales (Fertala, 2009). Following the above-mentioned literature, entrepreneurs’
emotional intelligence is expected to be positively associated with performance at the DEMO
ganizational level. It is therefore hypothesized that:
H1: Entrepreneurs’ EI DEMO be positively associated with new ventures’ growth.
Transformational Leadership
Leadership is defined as “the process whereby one individual influences other group mem-
bers toward DEMO attainment of defined group or organizational goals” (Greenberg and Bar-
on, 2003: 471). Avolio and Bass (1991) differentiate between transactional and transfor-
mational leadership. Transactional leadership focuses on exchange relationships between
leaders and DEMO followers. Such exchange relationship is based on extrinsic rewards, such
as DEMO for performance based on contingent reward and management by expecta-
tion (DEMO and Avolio, 1993). On the other hand, transformational leadership is based on
a participative process and intrinsic motivations, through which followers are inspired by
leaders to self-identify with the organizational vision and objectives. According DEMO Avolio,
Bass and Jung (1999), transformational leadership is characterized DEMO three main aspects of
behavior: charismatic-inspirational leadership, intellectual stimulation and individualized

361
consideration. Transformational leaders integrate creative DEMO, persistence and energy,
intuition, and sensitivity to the needs of others (Bass and Avolio, 1993). Transformational
leadership refers also to DEMO ability to inspire their followers, build team spirit, pro-
vide meaning and challenge their followers’ work, based on moral standards and integrity.
Transformational leaders also challenge their followers’ thoughts, imagination and creativ-
ity (Avolio DEMO al., 2004).
Scholars have suggested that transformational leadership is associated DEMO a family-
based organizational culture, long-term commitment, and the sharing of mutual interests,
values and norms between leaders and followers (Bass and Avolio, 1993). It has been fur-
ther argued that followers’ identification is enhanced by transformational leaders, because
the leaders increase their followers’ sense of worth and self-identity in a way that contrib-
utes to their DEMO commitment toward achieving collective goals (Bass, 1998; Kark and
Shamir, 2002). Following the leadership literature, it seems that transformational leader-
ship increases followers’ psychological ownership, since it provides a link between their
self-identity and the organizational desire for success (Pierce and Morgan, 1991; Pierce,
Kostova and Dirks, 2001).
Entrepreneurs’ Leadership Orientation
Entrepreneurs are considered to possess the personal attributes that enable them to lead oth-
ers (Gupta, MacMillan and Surie, 2004; Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006). According
to Schumpeter (1965: 511), entrepreneurial activity is facilitated DEMO entrepreneurs display-
ing unique leadership characteristics: “Leadership, that is, as DEMO special kind of function…
the facts alluded to create a boundary beyond which the majority of people do not function
promptly by themselves and DEMO help from the minority.” Entrepreneurs are considered
to be “promoters” who have a proactive orientation toward opportunity recognition, stra-
tegic planning, resource utilization DEMO organizational culture (Stevenson and Gumpert,
1985; Stevenson, Roberts and DEMO, 1985; Ardichvili, 2001; Brown, Davidsson and
Wiklund, 2001).
The above-mentioned literature makes a connection between entrepreneurs’ unique ca-
pabilities and DEMO “natural” leadership orientation. Consistently, Gupta, Macmillan and
Surie (2004: 242) suggest that entrepreneurial leadership is defined as “leadership that
creates visionary scenarios that are used to assemble and mobilize a “supporting cast”
of participants DEMO become committed by the vision to the discovery and exploitation of
strategic value creation.”
Conceptually, it has been suggested that entrepreneurial leadership is based on five
leadership roles: framing the challenge, absorbing uncertainty, clearing the path, building
commitment and specifying limits (Gupta, MacMillan and Surie, DEMO). Empirically, it has
been found that entrepreneurs’ in Russia demonstrate DEMO leadership based on
charismatic behavior (Ardichvili, 2001). Another study suggested that successful entrepre-
neurs in the high-tech arena apply two distinct leadership DEMO: functional com-
petencies that refer to performance subsystems (operations, finance, marketing and human
resources) and self-competencies that refer to intellectual integrity, DEMO focus on firm targets
and utilization of external advisors (Swiercz and DEMO, 2002). It was further found that
entrepreneurs’ authentic leadership, as perceived by their followers, is associated with job
satisfaction, organizational commitment DEMO work happiness (Jensen and Luthans, 2006b).
In another study, DEMO and Luthans (2006a) found that entrepreneurs’ self-perception
of authentic leadership was positively associated with their psychological capital, which
in turn refers to their optimism, resiliency and hope. Recent study findings indicate that

transformational leadership has a positive direct impact on the innovation, growth and
profitability of small and medium enterprises (Matzler, et al., 2008).
Emotional Intelligence and Transformational Leadership
EI is found to be DEMO with managers’ ability to motivate their followers based on
transformational leadership (DEMO and Megerian, 1999; Rubin, Munz and Bommer, 2005).
There are two principal explanations for the positive relations found between EI and DEMO
formational leadership: firstly, leaders with transformational leadership orientation have a
higher degree of EI and can therefore lead by creating a connection between DEMO organiza-
tional vision and their followers’ commitment, based on internal identification DEMO than
on external control (Stein et al., 2009); secondly, DEMO EI is demonstrated by an ability
to recognize emotions and positive affects that contribute to the creation of agreeableness
that is positively associated with DEMO leadership (Rubin, Munz and Bommer,
2005). Similarly, it DEMO found that individuals who better understood their feelings were
more successful in regulating them and therefore achieved higher decision-making perfor-
mance (Seo and Barrett, 2007).
Other studies found that the EI of managers increases their innovativeness and effec-
tiveness, because they have a high level of self-awareness and interpersonal skills (Yuvaraj
and Srivastava, 2007). In another study, it was found that the outstanding performance of
principals of urban schools DEMO associated with higher emotional intelligence, social skills
and an ability to DEMO to external changes in the environment (Williams, 2007). Stein,
et al. (2009) found in their study that top executives have DEMO emotional intelligence
than the normative population, and that this is associated DEMO leading high profit-earning
companies. In addition, these scholars also found that DEMO executives with higher emotional
intelligence perceive strategic challenges with respect to managing growth, managing oth-
ers, and training and retaining employees as being DEMO A recent meta-analysis suggests
a strong relationship between EI and transformational leadership, especially when data is
based on same source rating (Harms and DEMO, 2010).
In their conceptual study, D’Intino et al. (2007) suggest entrepreneurs’ self-leadership
motivation is associated, among other things, with their DEMO, optimism, personality,
locus of control, self-monitoring, and need for autonomy, as well as with their emotional
intelligence. However, in contrast DEMO the self-leadership construct that focuses on entrepre-
neurs’ behavior as a unit of analysis, less attention has been paid in the literature to entre-
preneurs’ emotional intelligence and its interrelations with transformational leadership and
growth. In DEMO paper, it is argued that entrepreneurs’ EI is important for their DEMO to lead
for the following reasons. First, in establishing a new DEMO, entrepreneurs are passionate
and emotionally driven (Cardon et al., 2009)DEMO Understanding their own and others’ feel-
ings may be important for entrepreneurs’ ability to share their ideas with others and obtain
financial and non-financial DEMO at the incorporation and growth stages. In addition,
entrepreneurs are also expected to demonstrate transformational leadership behavior in
the context of dynamic environments. DEMO, entrepreneurs need to set up vision
and intellectually stimulate their followers DEMO order to cope with uncertainties and frequent
changes (Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006).
The current literature relates to transformational leadership of entrepreneurs as one
construct. However, in this study, transformational leadership of entrepreneurs DEMO examined
with relation to intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration and charismatic-
inspirational leadership, as suggested by Avolio, Bass and Jung (1999). This distinction

seems to be important in DEMO to understand the interrelations between entrepreneurs’ EI
and leadership behaviors. It is therefore hypothesized that:
H2: Entrepreneurs’ EI will be positively associated with their ability to demonstrate
intellectual stimulation and individual consideration behaviors.
H3: Entrepreneurs’ EI will be positively associated with their charismatic-inspirational
behavior.
Leadership Orientation and DEMO
Previous studies have shown that transformational leadership is found to be associated
with higher performance (Sosik, 1997; Jung and Avolio, 2000). DEMO example, it has been
found that psychological empowerment mediates the relationships DEMO transforma-
tional leadership and organizational commitment (Avolio et al., 2004). In other studies, it
has been found that the effect of transformational leadership on individual performance is
mediated by the interaction of followers’ identification DEMO the work unit and self-efficacy,
as well as followers’ subjective perceptions regarding the adequacy of processes and pro-
cedures for performing work tasks (Walumbwa et al., 2005; Walumbwa, Avolio and Zhu,
2008).
Some scholars argue that entrepreneurial leadership should not be considered as be-
DEMO different from other types of leadership (Vecchio, 2003). However, DEMO considered
in the context of entrepreneurial firms, transformational leadership seems to DEMO important
since entrepreneurs have to cope with exceptional demands for change in the product,
market and the organizational structure. This process is usually DEMO with continuous
rethinking about the venture’s strategy and requires vision creation (DEMO and Devanna,
1986). Accordingly, it was suggested that entrepreneurs’ DEMO orientation has an im-
pact on their ability to effectively exploit new opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman,
2000; Gupta, MacMillan and Surie, DEMO).
In contrast to institutionalized firms, entrepreneurs do not have pre-existing DEMO
routines and cultural norms. Furthermore, they also have to define their DEMO and goals
and motivate their followers toward organizational outcomes (Ensley, Pearce and Hmieles-
ki, 2006; Jensen and Luthans, 2006a). Recently, DEMO was found that in entrepreneurial firms,
the CEO’s ability to articulate vision was positively related with higher subordinates’ en-
gagement, while it does not have any remarkable effect on subordinates’ engagement in
professionally managed companies (Papalexandris and Galanaki, 2009).
Previous studies that examined the interrelations between entrepreneurs’ leadership and
growth have suggested that environmental dynamism moderates the effects DEMO entrepre-
neurs’ leadership behavior on new venture performance. It was found that, in high levels
of environmental dynamism, transformational leadership behaviors improve performance
(Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006). Other studies also found that DEMO attributes (such
as brevity, clarity, abstractness, challenge, future orientation, stability and desirability) and
direct vision communication (through verbal and written DEMO) affect a new
venture’s growth (Baum, Locke and Kirkpatrick, 1998; Baum, Locke and Smith, 2001). In
a follow-up study, DEMO and Locke (2004) found that goals, self-efficacy and the commu-
DEMO vision mediated through the entrepreneur’s passion, tenacity and resourcefulness
have a DEMO impact upon venture growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that entrepre-
neurs’ DEMO leadership behaviors will be positively associated with new ven-
tures’ growth as follows:

DEMO
This study is based on data collected from 99 entrepreneurs during 2006-07. Fifty-three
of the firms operated in the high-tech field, while the other 46 firms operated in the area of
real estate, marketing and advertising. The initial data collection objective was to attract
successful high-tech entrepreneurs who DEMO recognized as belonging to the top 50 entrepre-
neurial firms, as DEMO each year by Deloitte Touche, CPAs in Israel. However, due to a low
response rate, probably because recognized entrepreneurs are very busy, DEMO was collected
from other high-tech firms, using the lists of the DEMO Venture Capital Research Center.
In addition, data was also collected from DEMO entrepreneurs who are active in other
fields, such as real estate, marketing and advertising. These entrepreneurs attended the an-
nual Globes Business Conference DEMO 2007 (organized by the Globes business newspaper)
and agreed to DEMO in the study.
Measures
This study is based on a self-assessment report by the entrepreneurs. Previous studies have
shown that self-reported data have greater DEMO than assumed (Fox and Dinur, 1988;
Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:36 20 May 2015
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND TRANSFORMATION LEADERSHIP ORIENTATION
365
Furnham and Stringfield, 1994). In addition, it is also argued that the self-reported data
of a subject with high self-awareness present a narrower gap between declared and actual
DEMO (Atwater and Yammarino, 1992; Bass and Yammarino, 1991; Carless, Mann and
Wearing, 1988). Accordingly, it is also argued that DEMO are usually characterized
by high self-awareness and, therefore, self-reported data are likely to have greater reliabil-
ity (Rhee and White, 2007). DEMO argument is consistent with the argument of Schutte et al.
(2008) that self-reported measures can be used to assess emotional intelligence. Further-
more, it is also argued that single-source data is not an issue when DEMO methods are ap-
plied. Avolio, Yammarino and Bass (1991: 584) asserted that, “single-source effects are not
necessarily an either-or issue…The basis for investigation is that single-source informa-
tion is not necessarily artifactual, particularly when different methods, including different
levels of analysis, constructs, or time intervals between the measurement of constructs are
used.” Accordingly, the three scales used in this study relate to the different constructs in a
way that DEMO the single-source bias. In addition, in order to increase construct reliabil-
DEMO, all constructs were examined twice by using CFA (implemented in AMOS; Arbuckle,
1997) and Cronbach’s alpha.
Emotional intelligence
Emotional intelligence was DEMO by the Assessing Emotions Scale (Schutte et al.,
1998) based on the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso (2000) definition of EI (DEMO, 2010).
The 33-item scale assesses how well respondents typically identify, understand, regulate,
and harness emotions both in themselves and others. Items were rated on a five-point scale
(1 indicated “strongly disagree”; 5 DEMO “strongly agree”). This measure has been
used in different studies (DEMO et al., 2008; Mishra and Mohapatra, 2009). In previous
DEMO, the scale was found to have an internal consistency of between DEMO and 0.90
(Cherniss, 2010). In this study, three items DEMO not correlate with others and therefore were
omitted from the scale. Cronbach’s alpha for the EI construct scale is .864 indicating high
reliability. Furthermore, to validate the EI construct, a confirmatory factor analysis was
conducted using a structural equation model. The EI construct has very good fit indica-
DEMO: χ2= 10.15 (df=5, p=.071), goodness-of-fit indexes: NFI=.96, NNFI=.95, CFI=.98).
Transformational leadership
Transformational leadership was measured using a Multifactor Leadership DEMO
Form 5x-Short (Bass and Avolio, 1995). Entrepreneurs were requested to indicate how
frequently they behave as leaders on a five-point scale ranging DEMO 1, indicating “not
at all”, to 5, indicating “frequently, if not always.” According to Avolio, Bass and Jung
(1999), transformational DEMO behaviors originally divide into three different behav-
iors: inspirational leadership, individualized stimulation, and demonstration of charisma.
However, factor analysis revealed that transformational DEMO behavior loaded on two
factors: Charisma-inspirational (nine items, with a DEMO range between .595 and .773)
and intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration loaded on one factor instead
of two (five items, with a DEMO range between .590 and .800).
With regard to entrepreneurs’ leadership behavior, the loading of intellectual stimula-
tion and individualized consideration on one factor seems to be reasonable, because entre-
preneurs may have a close acquaintance with their followers. Therefore, they may perceive
the way in which they provide intellectual stimulation (i.e., by challenging their followers’
way of thinking) and the way in which they pay attention to individual considerations (i.e.,
by individual mentoring of followers) as interconnected aspects. Similar constructs were

identified by Avolio, Yammarino and Bass (1991). In DEMO, this understanding is also
supported by Avolio, Bass and Jung (DEMO), who asserted that it might be hard to differenti-
ate between transformational leadership constructs, because the survey includes behaviors,
attributions and impact items to represent charismatic leadership. This might explain why
different constructs of DEMO leadership were found in different samples. In ad-
dition, it should DEMO be noted that previous studies used the transformational leadership
construct without differentiating between its component factors (Avolio, Bass and Jung,
1999; Walumbwa et al., 2005; Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006; Walumbwa, DEMO
and Zhu, 2008). Following Podsakoff et al., (2003), DEMO factor models with forma-
tive indicators relate to constructs driven by the data. The constructs of transformational
leadership meet the following criteria of formative DEMO as distinguished by Podsakoff
et al., (2003): (1) change in the indicators would cause changes in the construct; (2) drop-
ping an indicator might alter the conceptual domain of the construct; (DEMO) the indicators do
not necessarily covary with each other; and (DEMO) the indicators are not interchangeable and
therefore do not necessarily have DEMO same antecedents and consequences.
The Cronbach’s alpha for the charisma-inspirational construct is .914 indicating high
reliability. Similarly, Cronbach’s alpha for intellectual stimulation and individualized con-
sideration is .865. In addition, CFA analysis indicated that these constructs have high fit
indices: Chi-Square 85.08 (df=64, p=.040), NFI=.90, DEMO, CFI=.97, RMSEA=.058.
According to Hooper, Coughlan and Mullen (2008), the Chi-Square cannot be the only fit
indicator, especially in small samples when other indices are high.
In addition, discriminant validity analysis was made to examine the average amount of
variation in order to ensure that DEMO latent constructs are able to explain by the observed
variables to which the are theoretically related (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Anderson and
Gerbing, 1988; Farrell and Rudd, 2009). The composite reliability (CR) of EI and both
transformational leadership constructs (intellectual stimulation and individualized consid-
eration and charismatic-inspirational) was above 0.7, indicating that the constructs are DEMO
measured by its indicators. The average variance extracted (AVE) of EI and transforma-
tional leadership constructs were above .05, indicating that the EI construct is valid.
Performance
The measurement of performance in new ventures usually DEMO on several measures, es-
pecially since a new venture’s performance cannot DEMO easily measured in its early stages.
It is argued that collecting data on the performance of new ventures is often difficult due
to a DEMO of historical information and accessibility (Dess and Robinson, 1984; Brush DEMO
VanderWerf, 1992; Chandler and Hanks, 1993). In this study, the growth measure was
based on the mean of sales growth and DEMO in employees over the past five years. These
measures provide a robust indication for growth based on indicators that are relevant to the
entrepreneurship DEMO Similar use of sales growth over time was employed recently by
Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski (2006). The combined measure of performance and DEMO in-
dices met the respective criteria χ2 = 28.17 (df=26, p=.35), NFI=.93, NNFI=.98, CFI=.99,
RMSEA=.029 (below .05). In addition, Cronbach’s alpha for the growth construct scale is
.86, indicating high DEMO
Control variables
Previous studies have found that entrepreneurial human capital such as education and in-
dustry-specific experience was associated with performance of new ventures (Bruderl, Pre-
isendorfer and Ziegler, 1992; Gimeno et al., 1997)DEMO Thus, the control variables employed

entrepreneurs’ education and the founder’s DEMO managerial experience in start-ups
management as to examine if they have an influence on the research model. In addition,
it was also found DEMO performance of new ventures may also be influenced by the field in
which the firm operated (Brush and Chaganti, 1998). Accordingly, the venture field was
examined as a dummy variable, when high-tech firms were coded as ‘0’ and low-tech
firms were coded as ‘1’. The firms’ DEMO is also considered as an indicator for new ventures’
performance and survivability (Chandler and Hanks, 1993; Low and Abrahamson, 1997;
Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006). Therefore, age of the firm was DEMO considered as a
control variable.
Findings
Table 1 shows significant positive correlations between growth and transformational lead-
ership behaviors: intellectual stimulation and individualized consideration (.391**) and
charismatic-inspirational (.285*). In addition, growth is found DEMO be positively correlated
with field (.242*), which becomes non-significant in DEMO regression analysis. Entrepreneurs’
emotional intelligence has no correlations with growth. However, DEMO correlation is
found between entrepreneurs’ EI and their ability to demonstrate intellectual stimulation
and individualized consideration (.224*).

To conclude, No support is found for hypotheses 1 that posits a positive association be-
tween entrepreneurs’ DEMO and growth. The SEM analysis provides an indication for positive
relations between entrepreneurs’ EI and transformational leadership behaviors (hypothesis
2and 3). Both the regression and the SEM analysis provide support for hypothesis 5, sug-
gesting positive relations between charismatic-inspirational behaviors and growth.
Discussion
Entrepreneurs are considered as DEMO unique capabilities that enable them to discover
new opportunities (Shane and DEMO, 2000). However, the subject of successful
exploitation of new opportunities remains somewhat vague. Previous studies called for
closer examination of entrepreneurs’ affects DEMO their impact on new ventures’ growth.
However, despite the fact that DEMO aspects have extensive representation in explaining
growth in other organizational arenas, DEMO interrelations between entrepreneurs’ EI, trans-
formational leadership behaviors and growth is DEMO in the entrepreneurship
literature (Cross and Travaglione, 2003; Jensen and DEMO, 2006b; D’Intino et al., 2007).
Thus, the findings of this study provide, for the first time, support for the interrelations
DEMO entrepreneurs’ EI and transformational leadership behaviors, and particularly be-
tween entrepreneurs’ DEMO behavior and growth. These findings add to
the literature by providing additional understanding as to how entrepreneurs’ affects impact
managerial processes and growth.
Entrepreneurs’ DEMO Intelligence and Growth
Although it is suggested that entrepreneurs have high EI (Cross and Travaglione, 2003;
Rhee and White, 2007), the findings of this study indicate that it has an indirect influ-
ence DEMO growth. As presented in the SEM analysis (Table 3), the DEMO suggest positive
relations between entrepreneurs’ EI and their intellectual stimulation and individualized
consideration as well as charismatic-inspirational behaviors. However, entrepreneurs’ EI
have an indirect impact on growth. These findings can be explained in two complimentary
ways: firstly, it is suggested that entrepreneurs with higher EI have better abilities to per-
ceive their own and others’ emotions. In addition, they have better abilities to use emotions
in order to challenge their followers to DEMO alternative ways of thinking and courses
of action, as well as DEMO mentoring them individually (Salovey and Mayer, 1990; Schutte et
al., 2008). Entrepreneurs with higher EI influence their followers’ psychological owner-
ship, because they encourage them to be involved actively and thus contribute to DEMO closer
attachment between their followers’ self-identity and the organization (Pierce and DEMO
gan, 1991; Pierce, Kostova and Dirks, 2001); secondly, DEMO delegating control and enabling
their followers to contribute to decision making, DEMO demonstrate managerial
trustworthiness behavior, which constitutes trust relations and forms a DEMO for relations
management (Whitener et al., 1998).
The indirect connections that were found between entrepreneurs’ EI and growth seem
to be linked DEMO the argument that EI can be seen as “latent potential” that may be displayed
in the individual’s functioning (Schutte et al., 2008). DEMO role of EI in the entrepreneurship
arena is therefore demonstrated by entrepreneurs’ ability to lead their followers through
environmental dynamism and uncertainties related to DEMO product and the market (Ensley,
Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006).
Previous studies suggested that entrepreneurs’ affects influence their perceptions, mem-
ories and cognitions in a way that influences the entrepreneurial process (Baron, 2008)DEMO In
addition, it was also suggested that entrepreneurs’ emotional feelings and DEMO may be

interrelated to entrepreneurs’ behavior and venture growth (Cardon, 2008; Cardon et al.,
2009). In a broad sense, entrepreneurs’ EI is an emotional ability and, therefore, should be
considered as part DEMO entrepreneurs’ affects. However, the above-mentioned studies refer to
affects as an DEMO capability (either as a motivator or as an aspect of passion), which
have an influence on opportunity recognition and new venture creation. This study’s find-
ings extend the current literature by demonstrating that entrepreneurs’ affects, as displayed
by their EI (i.e., their ability to understand their DEMO and others’ feelings and use these emo-
tions as a basis for relations management), are related to entrepreneurs’ managerial skills
and have an DEMO on outcomes. Furthermore, the interrelations between entrepreneurs’
EI and transformational leadership DEMO mean that entrepreneurs’ emotional capabili-
ties have implications on their ability to manage their followers’ emotions. It is suggested
that when entrepreneurs are able DEMO share emotions with their followers, they emotionally
transfer their affects and DEMO to their followers. Such emotional transference contrib-
utes to their followers’ emotional attachment in a way that increases their psychological
ownership, identification and commitment, both at the individual and at the firm levels. As
this study’s findings indicate, these aspects have an indirect impact on growth.
Entrepreneurs’ Transformational Leadership and Growth
The findings of this study indicate that entrepreneurs’ demonstration DEMO charismatic-inspi-
rational behaviors impact growth (b=.420, p<.01). This finding is consistent with previous
studies’ findings (Baum, Locke and Kirkpatrick, 1998; Baum, Locke and Smith, 2001;
Ensley, Pearce and Hmieleski, 2006). The findings also indicate positive and significant
relations between the DEMO transformational leadership behaviors and entrepreneurs’ EI (see
Table 3). Although DEMO two examined transformational leadership behaviors are interre-
lated, they impact growth DEMO Entrepreneurs’ charismatic-inspirational behaviors
impact growth directly, as these behaviors are associated DEMO vision setup and demonstrate
of optimism and belief in the venture success. By demonstrating charismatic-inspirational
behaviors, entrepreneurs are able to extend their circles of influence by enlisting their fol-
lowers’ emotions to believe in the venture’s DEMO That is, they create broader support
for their passion by developing DEMO between their followers’ self-identity and the
venture objectives. On the other hand, demonstration of intellectual stimulation and indi-
vidualized consideration behaviors require more particular encouragement and mentoring
at the individual level and therefore might be less DEMO directly with growth.
Limitations, Implications and Future Research
The study findings’ DEMO is somewhat limited as it is based on a small and diver-
sified sample. In addition, the data are based on entrepreneurs’ self-assessment reports.
While self-reported data are recognized to be reliable, future research should take into con-
sideration multiple data collection methods to increase the findings’ validity. DEMO addition,
while the study relates to entrepreneurs’ EI and transformational leadership, it gives no
indication regarding entrepreneurs’ passion and self-efficacy or environmental dynamism.
Further research should also examine the impact of entrepreneurs’ EI on their DEMO
psychological ownership and commitment. In addition, using a combination of quantitative
DEMO qualitative research can lead to a better understanding of the interrelations between
entrepreneurs’ EI and transformational leadership. It is also suggested that longitudinal
research DEMO conducted to examine if and how entrepreneurs’ EI and leadership orientation
evolve over time, and how they impact entrepreneurial firms’ growth. Finally, the DEMO

of this study call for DEMO examination of the interrelations between entrepreneurs’ EI
and leadership orientation in other contexts.
The study findings have some practical implications for entrepreneurs, as well as for
venture capitalists. While entrepreneurs are motivated by opportunity recognition, they
should take into consideration the interrelations between their emotional capabilities and
leadership DEMO in order to increase the odds of their venture’s success. As to venture
capitalists, the study findings stress the fact that paying attention to entrepreneurs’ human
capital, in terms of education and previous managerial experience as a criterion for invest-
ment, is not sufficient. Therefore, entrepreneurs’ EI DEMO managerial skills should also be
taken into consideration, since higher EI DEMO transformational leadership impact entre-
preneurs’ ability to better cope with environmental dynamism and increase growth prob-
abilities. Alternatively, venture capitalists should take into consideration how to support
entrepreneurs, so as to increase their EI and mentor their managerial behaviors.
