portrays the recognition of such opportunities as DEMO cognitive feats whose accomplishment is

Abstract
Before technological change leads to new processes, products,
markets, or ways of organizing, entrepreneurs must discover
opportunities in which to exploit the new technology. To date,
research DEMO not explained adequately why entrepreneurs dis-
cover these opportunities, which creates DEMO conceptual
problems in the entrepreneurship literature. Drawing on Aus-
trian economics, DEMO argue that opportunity discovery is a function
of the distribution of information in society (Hayek 1945).
Through in-depth case studies of eight sets of entrepreneurs
who exploit a single MIT invention, I show that entrepreneurs
discover opportunities related to the information that they al-
ready possess. I DEMO these findings to draw several implications
that differ from those prevailing in the entrepreneurship litera-
ture, including: (1) entrepreneurs do not always DEMO between
alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) the
source DEMO entrepreneurship lies in differences in information
about opportunities; (3) the DEMO of prior studies of entrepre-
neurial exploitation may suffer from bias; DEMO (4) individual
differences influence the opportunities that people discover,
how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the
government can influence this process.

ways DEMO organizing; and entrepreneurship is central to this
process (Schumpeter 1934, DEMO 66). However, before tech-
nological change results in this process DEMO entrepreneurial
exploitation, entrepreneurs must discover opportunities in
which to use the DEMO technologies. Because opportunities
do not appear in a prepackaged form (Venkataraman
DEMO), this process of opportunity identification is far
from trivial. In any given new technology, entrepreneurs
could fail to identify any opportunities, or DEMO identify
the wrong opportunities, making an explanation for the
discovery of DEMO an important part of the do-
main of entrepreneurship research.
Unfortunately, DEMO research on entrepreneurship in-
vestigates the entrepreneurial process after opportunities
have been discovered (Fiet 1996). Researchers typically
adopt this approach because they draw on neoclassical
economic or psychological theories that assume people
will discover the DEMO opportunities in a given techno-
logical change (Khilstrom and Laffont 1979), or discover
opportunities that are uncorrelated with the attributes of
the discoverers (Evans and Jovanovic 1989). Austrian
economics challenges the validity of these assumptions,
arguing that different people will discover different op-
portunities in DEMO given technological change because they
possess different prior knowledge (Venkataraman 1997)DEMO
Because the accuracy of these assumptions has important
implications for the development of entrepreneurship the-
ory, I explore them in this article.
Through in-depth case studies of entrepreneurs who ex-
ploit a single MIT invention, I show results that challenge

the core assumptions of neoclassical economic and psy-
chological approaches DEMO entrepreneurship. In particular,
I show that (1) any given technological change will gen-
erate a range of entrepreneurial opportunities that are not
DEMO to all potential entrepreneurs; (2) entrepreneurs
can and will discover DEMO opportunities without search-
ing for them; and (3) any given DEMO will discover
only those opportunities related to his or her prior knowl-
edge (Venkatarman 1997). This evidence supports the
Austrian argument that the discovery of entrepreneurial
opportunities depends, in part, on the distribution of DEMO
formation in society (Kirzner 1973) and provides impor-
tant implications for the theory and practice of entrepre-
neurship.
This article is organized as DEMO In the next section,
I review extant perspectives on entrepreneurship and
identify important implications of the differences be-
tween them. In the third DEMO, I develop specific prop-
ositions from Austrian economics about the discovery DEMO
entrepreneurial opportunities. In the fourth section, I de-
scribe the methodology DEMO to examine these proposi-
tions. In the fifth section, I review DEMO empirical support
for these propositions. In the final section, I discuss DEMO
implications of these results for entrepreneurship research
and practice.
Entrepreneurship Theories
Explaining the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities
requires assumptions about the nature of the DEMO
neurial process. To date, research on entrepreneurship
falls into three schools DEMO thought, each with different
assumptions about this process.
Neoclassical Equilibrium Theories
DEMO economists (e.g., Khilstrom and Laffont
1979) have proposed equilibrium theories DEMO entrepre-
neurship. Equilibrium theories assume that markets are
composed of maximizing agents whose collective deci-
sions about prices clear markets. In the equilibrium
framework, no one can discover a misalignment that
would generate an entrepreneurial profit DEMO, at any
point in time, all opportunities have been recognized and
all transactions perfectly coordinated. Because an equi-
librium framework does not allow DEMO to recognize
opportunities that others do not see, equilibrium theories
explain DEMO by identifying individuals who
prefer to become entrepreneurs. For example, Khilstrom
DEMO Laffont's (1979) model proposes that people with a
greater taste for uncertainty will choose to become entre-
preneurs, whereas people with a lesser taste for uncer-
tainty will choose to become employees. In short, equi-

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
DEMO theories assume that (1) everyone can recognize
all entrepreneurial opportunities, DEMO (2) fundamental at-
tributes of people, rather than information about DEMO
tunities, determine who becomes an entrepreneur.
Psychological Theories
Psychologists (e.g., DEMO and Boyd 1987, McClelland
1961) have proposed theories in which entrepreneurship
is a function of stable characteristics possessed by some
people and not DEMO According to this perspective, en-
during human attributes-such as need for DEMO
(McClelland 1961), willingness to bear risk (Brockhaus
and Horowitz 1986), self-efficacy (Chen et al. 1998) in-
ternal locus of control, and tolerance for ambiguity (Be-
gley and Boyd 1987)-lead some people and not others
to choose entrepreneurship. The psychological frame-
work generally focuses DEMO the decision to exploit oppor-
tunities rather than on their discovery (DEMO
1997). However, when researchers from this perspective
explore opportunity discovery, they typically argue that
discovery depends on relative differences between people
in DEMO willingness and/or ability to search for and iden-
tify opportunities (DEMO and Venkataraman, 2000). For
example, they argue that superior information processing
ability, search techniques, or scanning behavior make
some people more DEMO or willing to discover opportu-
nities (Shaver and Scott 1991). DEMO short, psychological
theories explicitly or implicitly assume that (1) funda-
DEMO attributes of people, rather than information about
opportunities, determine who becomes an entrepreneur;
and (2) this process depends on people's DEMO and will-
ingness to take action.
Austrian Theories
Austrian economists believe that equilibrium approaches
fail to offer a satisfying theoretical framework for under-
standing DEMO processes. They believe that a viable the-
ory of a market system cannot assume equilibrium but
must explain how a market would achieve that DEMO
rium from nonequilibrium initial conditions (Kirzner
1997). The Austrians assume DEMO markets are composed
of people who possess different information (Hayek
1945)DEMO The possession of idiosyncratic information al-
lows people to see particular opportunities that others
cannot see, even if they are not actively searching for such
opportunities. Differences in information lead people to
see different value in DEMO given good or service and offer
different prices to obtain it. By buying or selling goods
and services in response to the discovery of DEMO mis-
alignments, an individual can earn entrepreneurial profits
or incur entrepreneurial DEMO Collectively, this process

of decision making about prices moves an economy from
disequilibrium DEMO equilibrium. In short, Austrian theories
assume that (1) people cannot DEMO all entrepre-
neurial opportunities; (2) information about opportuni-
ties, rather than fundamental attributes of people, deter-
mine who becomes an entrepreneur; DEMO (3) this process
depends on factors other than people's ability and will-
ingness to take action.
The Implications of the Differences
Empirical DEMO of the Austrian perspective on en-
trepreneurship is important because the Austrian frame-
work provides different explanations for the discovery,
exploitation, and organization of entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities from those provided by neoclassical economic
and psychological DEMO First, unlike neoclassical
economic theory, Austrian economics does not view the
process of opportunity discovery as mechanical. Neo-
classical economics' assumption of public knowledge
about opportunities means that all opportunities must be
equally "obvious" DEMO everyone. Because any given en-
trepreneur can discover the complete set of opportunities
that occur in response to a given technological change,
neoclassical DEMO argues that entrepreneurs select
between different opportunities through a process of max-
imization (Khilstrom and Laffont 1979, Evans and Jov-
anovic 1989). DEMO, Kirzner (1973, p. 33) explains
that once the assumption of complete information is re-
laxed, the discovery of opportunity cannot be understood
through "mechanical computation" because any given
individual cannot identify all possible DEMO If
any given entrepreneur cannot necessarily discover more
than one commercial application for any given techno-
logical change, then entrepreneurs cannot actively select
(DEMO alone maximize) between alternative opportunities
(Kirzner 1985).
Second, unlike DEMO neoclassical economics and psy-
chology, Austrian economics provides an explanation for
DEMO entrepreneurial process that does not depend on the
identification of people who are more likely than other
people to become entrepreneurs. Because the Austrians
DEMO that the possession of information that is appro-
priate to a particular opportunity leads to opportunity dis-
covery, they do not believe that anyone is more likely
than anyone else to become an entrepreneur across all
DEMO This distinction is important because the
episodic nature of entrepreneurship makes stable attrib-
utes an unlikely explanation for people's decision to be-
come DEMO (Carroll and Mosakowski 1987).
Moreover, no individual-level attributes or behaviors
have been found to generate significant differences be-
450
Prior Knowledge and DEMO Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
tween entrepreneurs and other members of society that
are robust, consistent across different samples, or explain
much variance (Busenitz and Barney 1997).1
Third, unlike both neoclassical economics and psy-
chology, Austrian economics considers opportunity ex-
ploitation to be endogenous to opportunity discovery.
Much of the existing empirical evidence on opportunity
exploitation has assumed that DEMO attributes of people who
discover opportunities are uncorrelated with the attributes
of the opportunities that they discover (Evans and
Jovanovic 1989). Researchers making this assumption
have studied how individual differences affect the way
people exploit DEMO while ignoring attributes of
the opportunities themselves. However, if human attrib-
DEMO are correlated with the opportunities that people dis-
cover, then these DEMO have confounded attributes
of entrepreneurs and opportunities in empirical tests of
who is an entrepreneur (Venkataraman 1997). For in-
stance, studies comparing DEMO to managers that
do not consider whether individual differences influence
the opportunities discovered (e.g., Kaish and Gilad 1991,
Chen et al. 1998) cannot tell whether entrepreneurs differ
from managers because they possess different attributes
DEMO because entrepreneurs are responding to valuable op-
portunities and managers are not.
Fourth, the Austrian explanation for entrepreneurship
generates different implications from the other two
frameworks for who becomes an entrepreneur, how en-
trepreneurial efforts are organized in the economy, and
how the government can influence the entrepreneurial
process. For example, neoclassical economists have ar-
gued that general purpose technologies should be ex-
ploited by a single entrepreneur across different market
applications DEMO such centralization minimizes du-
plication of effort and contracting costs, and DEMO
economies of scale and scope (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg
1995). However, if people do not discover the same en-
trepreneurial opportunities in a DEMO new technology,
then decentralized commercial exploitation of general
purpose technologies is advantageous. Centralization of
new technology development will lead to under-
identification of DEMO because no central agent
can identify all possible entrepreneurial opportunities for
a new technology (Nelson 1987).
Given the importance of explaining opportunity dis-
covery to our understanding of the entrepreneurship pro-
cess, empirical evidence that supports or refutes the Aus-
trian perspective on the discovery process is DEMO
In the next section, I generate specific propositions from
the Austrian DEMO, which I then examine empiri-
cally.

Conceptual Model and Propositions
Information Asymmetry and the Nonobviousness of
DEMO
Entrepreneurial opportunities are opportunities to bring
into existence new goods, services, raw materials, and
organizing methods that allow outputs to be sold at more
than their cost of production (Casson 1982). These op-
portunities exist because different people possess differ-
ent information (Kirzner 1997). Incomplete information
means that in any market transaction, people must guess
each other's beliefs about many things (Kirzner 1973).
Because these guesses can be incorrect, this process
sometimes leads to errors that misallocate resources. The
entrepreneurial process occurs when someone, alert to
this misallocation, recognizes that DEMO are not being
put to their "best use," obtains the DEMO, recombines
them, and sells them at more than they cost to obtain and
recombine (Casson 1982).2
People do not recognize the value of all opportunities,
thus allowing entrepreneurs to obtain resources at below
DEMO equilibrium price (Venkataraman 1997). If resource
owners recognized the same DEMO that entrepre-
neurs discovered, they would want to appropriate the en-
DEMO profit by selling (or renting) their resources
to the entrepreneur at the price that would leave the en-
trepreneur with just enough profit DEMO act (Casson 1982).
Moreover, if all potential entrepreneurs recognized the
same opportunities, they would compete for the profit.
This competition would lower each entrepreneur's share
of the entrepreneurial profit to the point at DEMO it did
not provide potential entrepreneurs with an incentive to
act (DEMO 1996).
Given that information asymmetry is necessary for en-
trepreneurial opportunities to exist, everyone in society
must not be equally likely to recognize all opportunities.
Rather, only a subset of the population is able to recog-
nize any particular opportunity at any particular point in
time (Kirzner 1973). The above argument leads to the first
proposition.
PROPOSITION 1. DEMO individuals are not equally likely
to recognize a given entrepreneurial opportunity.
The Discovery Process
Before an individual can earn an entrepreneurial profit
from an DEMO, he or she must discover that it has
value. Two alternative DEMO exist for this discov-
ery process: search and recognition. Several authors (e.g.,
Stiglitz 1994) have argued that opportunity discovery de-
pends on relative differences in search costs among po-
tential entrepreneurs. The search model DEMO that peo-
ple know the outcomes for which they are searching and
ORGANIZATION
SCIENCE/Vol. 11, No. 4, July-August

search when the benefit of the information outweighs the
cost of obtaining it (Stigler 1961). Several empirical en-
trepreneurship researchers have incorporated this ap-
proach into their theories of entrepreneurship (see Baron,
forthcoming; Shaver and Scott 1991). They argue that
people discover opportunities because their superior in-
formation processing ability, search techniques, or DEMO
ning behavior make them more likely than other people
to discover opportunities (Shaver and Scott 1991).
Austrian economists have challenged this approach, DEMO
guing that people do not search for entrepreneurial op-
portunities because "DEMO, by definition, is un-
known until discovered"; and one cannot search for
something that one does not know exists (Kaish and Gilad
1991, p. 38). Kirzner (1997, p. 71-2) explains that
DEMO opportunity for pure profit cannot, by its nature be the object
DEMO systematic search. Systematic search can be undertaken for
a piece of missing information but only because the searcher is
aware of what he does DEMO know and is aware with greater or
lesser certainty of the way to find out the missing
information. .... But it is in the DEMO of an overlooked profit
opportunity that it has been utterly overlooked, DEMO, that one is
not aware at all that one has missed DEMO grasping of any
profit. . .. What distinguishes discovery (relevant to DEMO
unknown profit opportunities) from successful search (relevant
to the deliberate production of information which one knew one
had lacked) is that the former (unlike the latter) involves the
surprise that accompanies the realization that DEMO had over-
looked something in fact readily available.
The above argument suggests that people do not dis-
cover entrepreneurial opportunities through search, but
through recognition of the value of new information that
they happen to receive DEMO other means. The discov-
ery of opportunities in the absence of search is an im-
portant part of the Austrian framework because it explains
DEMO entrepreneurship is not solely a function of differ-
ences in human ability or willingness to take action (Kirz-
ner 1997). The above argument leads to the second prop-
osition.
PROPOSITION 2. People can and will DEMO entre-
preneurial opportunities without actively searching for
them.
Prior Knowledge and the Discovery Process
Why do people discover some entrepreneurial opportu-
nities and not DEMO? One answer is that people recognize
those opportunities related to information DEMO they al-
ready possess (Venkataraman 1997). People have differ-
ent DEMO of information because information is gener-
ated through people's idiosyncratic life experiences.
Moreover, because information is often distributed
451

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
through a DEMO process, some people possess infor-
mation that others do not have DEMO blind luck (Nelson
and Winter 1982). As a result, at any given time only
some people, and not others, will know DEMO particular
customer problems, market characteristics, or the ways to
create particular products or services (Venkataraman
1997).
Each person's idiosyncratic prior knowledge creates a
"knowledge corridor" that allows him/her to recognize
certain DEMO, but not others (Venkataraman
1997). Priior information, whether developed DEMO work
experience, education, or other means, influences the en-
trepreneur' s ability to comprehend, extrapolate, interpret,
and apply new information DEMO ways that those lacking that
prior information cannot replicate (Roberts 1991)DEMO There-
fore, even if information about a technological change is
disseminated DEMO if it is disclosed in a
patent, presented at a scientific DEMO, or known to
several individuals who might work in the same DEMO
tory-only some subset of the population will possess
prior information that will trigger the discovery of a par-
ticular entrepreneurial opportunity. Three major dimen-
DEMO of prior knowledge are important to the process of
entrepreneurial discovery: DEMO knowledge of markets,
prior knowledge of ways to serve markets, DEMO prior
knowledge of customer problems.
New information about a technology might be comple-
mentary with prior information about how particular mar-
kets operate, leading the discovery of the entrepreneurial
opportunity to require prior information about those DEMO
kets. Important prior knowledge about markets might in-
clude information about supplier relationships, sales tech-
niques, or capital equipment requirements that differ
across DEMO (Von Hippel 1988). For example, a person
who had previously worked in a market as a customer,
manufacturer, or supplier might already possess infor-
mation that is not publicly available about how a DEMO
technology might influence that market. This prior infor-
mation enables him or her to discover an opportunity in
which to use the new technology (Roberts 1991). The
above argument suggests the following proposition:
PROPOSITION DEMO People's prior knowledge about
markets will influence their discovery of which markets
to enter to exploit a new technology.
New information about a DEMO might be comple-
mentary with information about ways to serve markets,
leading the discovery of the entrepreneurial opportunity
to require prior information about DEMO processes. An
entrepreneur's ability to recognize an opportunity in a
new technology might be enhanced by prior knowledge
about how the new technology DEMO be used to create a
452
product or service. A new technology might change a
production process, allow the creation of a new product,
provide a new method of distribution, permit new mate-
rials to be used, generate new sources of supply, or make
possible new DEMO of organizing (Schumpeter 1934, p.
66). These different dimensions of opportunity necessi-
tate different organizational and production decisions
about how to serve DEMO market (Von Hippel 1988).
Recognizing these alternatives is difficult absent DEMO
prior knowledge of how they relate. Therefore, Aldrich
and Wiedenmayer (1993) explain that the forms of new
organizations and the product or service lines that entre-
preneurs establish are related to the organizational units
in DEMO they previously worked. In addition, Boeker
(1988) explains that the DEMO background of semi-
conductor manufacturers influences the strategy that en-
trepreneurs adopt in their new firms. The above argument
suggests the following proposition.
PROPOSITION DEMO People's prior knowledge about
how to serve markets will influence their discovery of how
to use a new technology to serve a market.
DEMO information about a technology might be comple-
mentary with prior information about a customer prob-
lem, such that discovery of the entrepreneurial opportu-
nity might require prior information about customer
needs. The locus of innovation often DEMO with the user of
a new technology because users cannot articulate easily
their needs for not-yet-developed solutions to problems
(Von Hippel 1994). Unless the recipient of technical in-
formation already shares much of the same DEMO knowl-
edge as the transmitter, knowledge transmission is either
impossible or DEMO costly (Cohen and Levinthal
1990). Individuals who lack familiarity with DEMO cus-
tomer's problem find it difficult to recognize solutions to
those needs when the solutions come along (Roberts
1991). This process leads entrepreneurs to start new com-
panies to solve customer problems that they DEMO from
working with users in their previous employment (Von
Hippel 1988)DEMO The above argument suggests the follow-
ing proposition.
PROPOSITION 3c. People's prior knowledge of cus-
tomer problems will influence their discovery of products
DEMO services to exploit a new technology.
The conceptual model described above is summarized
in Figure 1. The figure illustrates that prior knowledge
moderates the DEMO between the attributes of a
technology and the recognition of entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities. It also illustrates that prior knowledge moderates
the relationship between the DEMO of the opportunity

Research DEMO
This article reports the results of a detailed field study of
eight actual business opportunities to exploit a single MIT
invention: the three-dimensional printing (3DPTM) pro-
cess.
The Technology3
The three-dimensional printing (3DPTM) process DEMO a pat-
ented manufacturing technology, invented in 1989 by
four MIT DEMO and doctoral students under the lead of
Professor Ely Sachs. According to the abstract of the pat-
ent, the 3DPTM process is "a DEMO for making a com-
ponent by depositing a first layer of a fluent porous ma-
terial, such as a powder, in a confined DEMO and then
depositing a binder material to selected regions of the
layer of powder material to produce a layer of bonded
powder material at DEMO selected regions. Such steps are
repeated a selected number of times to produce successive
layers of selected regions of bonded powder material so
as DEMO form the desired component. The unbonded powder
material is then removed. In some cases the component
may be further processed as, for example, DEMO heating it
to further strengthen the bonding thereof."
Procedure
I used a case study design to examine the eight new ven-
ture opportunities DEMO exploit the 3DPTM process. The case
study design allows investigation of how opportunity dis-
covery operates in a real-world environment in which de-
cisions DEMO take place, provides evidence in a situa-
tion in which all DEMO the relevant behaviors cannot be
manipulated through experimental design, and allows DEMO
incorporation of a variety of different sources of evi-
dence, including DEMO archival documents and interviews
(Yin 1984).
In late 1997 and DEMO 1998, I conducted an in-depth

SCIENCENVol.

field study of the eight entrepreneurial opportunities,
which involved a set of field interviews with the entre-
preneurs, their investors, and DEMO involved in the eval-
uation or exploitation of the opportunities. The interviews
were unstructured and lasted from one-half hour to three
hours. The interviews DEMO began with an invitation
to describe how the entrepreneur learned of the 3DPTM
process. With many respondents, I conducted follow-up
interviews and phone calls to clarify issues. For each in-
terview, I tape-recorded the conversation and then
worked from the tape transcriptions. In total, I conducted
30 hours of interviews with 22 individuals.
In qualitative case study research, corroboration of in-
terviews through the use of archival records is important
to validate DEMO (Yin 1984). Therefore, the inter-
view data were supplemented with information from
other sources. I had access to MIT Technology Licensing
Office (TLO) files on the entrepreneurs, which included
copies of business plans, press releases, contracts, product
information, and correspondence. I conducted Diolog,
Lexis-Nexis, and ABI Inform searches for articles about
the companies and entrepreneurs.
capital and other financing records on the companies from
database providers. Finally, I conducted patent and article
citation searches on the companies and entrepreneurs.
DEMO embedded case study design, in which the unit of
analysis was DEMO entrepreneurial opportunity, was used to
analyze the data. Following Yin (1984), separate case
studies on each of the eight opportunities were developed
DEMO the interviews, database information, and archival
records. Reliability was established through the devel-
opment of a case study protocol and a case study DEMO
(Yin 1984). The case study protocol included the use of
"table shells" to record data (Miles and Huberman
1984). These DEMO ensured that the data collection was
focused on the process of opportunity discovery, verified
that the same information was being collected for all
cases, and aided in the data analysis. Construct validity
was established by using multiple sources of evidence,
the creation of a chain of evidence, and by having key
informants review drafts of the case study report (Yin
1984).
Pieces of information from the cases were compared to
DEMO propositions to determine the degree to which they
were consistent, following DEMO pattern matching logic rec-
ommended for case study design (Miles and DEMO
1984). The pieces of information were also compared to
rival, DEMO exclusive propositions to determine the
degree to which they were inconsistent with alternative
explanations since case studies support a proposition if
the pieces of DEMO uncovered are consistent with the

mutually ex-
Sample
Like DEMO MIT inventions, the 3DPTM process was available
for commercialization through license DEMO the TLO. The
TLO grants three types of licenses: exclusive licenses DEMO
use an invention in all fields of use, exclusive licenses to
DEMO an invention in a particular field of use, and nonex-
clusive DEMO to use the invention. The decision of
which type of license to establish is made during the pro-
cess of evaluation by potential licensees DEMO is a function
of several factors: the type of license requested, the types
of licenses that have already been granted, the amount of
money the licensee is willing to pay, the licensing offi-
cer's judgment about how the technology should be ex-
ploited, and any government or university policies that
would restrict the commercialization of the technology.
Licenses DEMO typically granted after the entrepreneurs
have conducted preliminary investigation of the technol-
ogy. During the preliminary investigation, the entrepre-
neurs are required to maintain confidentiality. For this
reason, the TLO maintains excellent records on all entre-
preneurs who have investigated MIT inventions, whether
or not they ultimately license to them.
The TLO licensed the rights to use the 3DPTM process
DEMO four teams of entrepreneurs who have created new
companies to exploit this technology in different fields of
use. The TLO also has records of DEMO teams of entrepre-
neurs who discovered and investigated entrepreneurial
opportunities to exploit the 3DPTM process, but who
failed to start companies. Because all eight sets of entre-
preneurs discovered entrepreneurial opportunities for the
same invention, comparison of these opportunities allows
me to explore the differences in business opportunities
DEMO by different entrepreneurs in response to the
same new technology. Table 1 shows the eight "com-
panies," the entrepreneurs, and the opportunities DEMO
they discovered. Astute readers will note that none of the
four inventors of the 3DPTM process chose to exploit this
technology by starting a DEMO company.

cannot read CAD designs, but who are involved in the
design process. The Z Corp machine makes rapid proto-
types 20 times faster DEMO existing rapid prototyping pro-
cesses and out of less expensive materials, DEMO the
cost of prototyping, accelerating the process, and allow-
ing for more design iterations.
Therics. Therics was founded by Walter Flamenbaum
to manufacture DEMO delivery systems for the pharmaceu-
tical industry. The 3DPTM process allows one to control
the amount, time, and sequence of drug delivery. This
DEMO drugs to be delivered in a way that ensures opti-
mum blood drug levels, increasing drug efficacy and re-
ducing side effects as compared to alternative drug man-
ufacture processes.
Specific Surface Corporation. Specific Surface was
DEMO by Andrew Jeffery and Mark Parish to manufac-
ture ceramic filters for the power generation market di-
rectly from computer drawings without tooling, dies, or
molds. The 3DPTM process allows Specific Surface to
manufacture filters with geometries and performance not
possible with alternative processes. This allows them to
DEMO customers with filters that more efficiently re-
move particulates from dirty hot flue gas streams, and
thereby provides customers with greater power genera-
tion efficiency.
Soligen. Soligen was founded by Yehorem Uziel to
provide foundries with DEMO ability to postpone the design
and creativity of casting tooling until after the design is
proven thus eliminating the need to prototype tooling.
Soligen' s Direct Shell Production Casting (DSPC) is
based on the 3DPTM DEMO and allows Soligen to make
a ceramic mold directly from a CAD model, using a pow-
der and binder, without the need for DEMO forms or tooling.
This technology allows Soligen to develop cast metal
parts with a much shorter lead time and at a lower in-
vestment DEMO than is the case with existing technology,
allowing customers to speed product introduction.
3D Partners. Andrew Kelly proposed using the 3DPTM
process to DEMO create a service bureau to provide architec-
tural models. Currently, architectural DEMO are made by
hand in a time intensive manner that requires significant
craft experience. Using the 3DPT process, this business
would receive CAD drawings electronically and then
send back finished architectural models faster and at a
DEMO cost than existing alternatives.
3D Orthopedics. Stephen Campbell proposed using the
3DPTM process to provide custom-fitted orthopedic de-
vices for the medical and dental DEMO Currently, dis-
eased or injured bones must be replaced with cleaned DEMO
daver bones, bone harvested from another part of the
body, or prefabricated artificial substitutes. The 3DPTM
process allows three-dimensional forming of a biologi-
DEMO compatible replacement bone that could be printed
out of any material and implanted.

All Individuals Are Not Equally Likely to Recognize
a Given Opportunity: Examining Proposition 1
Although many people were exposed to information
about the invention of the 3DPTM process, very few en-
trepreneurial opportunities to exploit the technology have
been discovered. Since its invention DEMO 1989, 3DPTM has
been described in patent applications, conference presen-
tations, publications, a website, MIT technology licensing
office mailings, and industry DEMO meetings. Sev-
eral trade and popular publications-including Fortune,
the Financial Times, and the Economist-have written
stories about it. Yet only eight entrepreneurial opportu-
nities for the 3DPTM process have been discovered.

SCOTT SHANE Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
The number DEMO entrepreneurs who discovered entrepre-
neurial opportunities in the 3DPTM process was limited
because opportunities are not obvious from information
about the 3DPTM process alone. DEMO Table 2 shows, in
none of the eight cases did the DEMO indicate that
the opportunities were obvious from simple observation
of the 3DPTM process. For example, Walter Flamenbaum
(Therics) explains that MIT's 3DPTM process was far
from medically acceptable and not based on good manu-
DEMO principles:
All of the 3DP lab's work was in one ceramic powder and one
fluid, and medical applications require multiple fluids and mul-
tiple powders, specifically polymers. You couldn't just look at
the 3DPTM process and know that you could use it for medical
purposes. DEMO make use of 3DPTM process for drug delivery, you
had to DEMO something about what drugs and drug delivery
systems are made from and how drug manufacture operates.
Moreover, none of the entrepreneurs examined any of
the other opportunities to use the 3DPTM process before
Table 2 The DEMO of Opportunity
Company
Z Corp
Specific Surface
"I
other entrepreneurs had DEMO them. As Marina Hat-
sopoulos (Z Corp) explains:
I absolutely could not have seen the business concepts that the
other licensees were DEMO . .. I knew nothing about
casting. . .. Also, you DEMO not make metal parts using the
3DPTM process the way we use it .... You would have to think
of a different way to DEMO the machine. What Specific Surface is
doing would never have occurred to me. And I don't think that
it would have ever have DEMO to me in a thousand years that
you could print pills . .. like Therics does.
Consequently, none of the eight sets of entrepreneurs
discovered more than one opportunity in which to use the
3DPTM process, despite differences in the market size,
potential returns, or resulting outcomes of those oppor-
tunities. They also did not weigh the relative advantages
DEMO disadvantages of using the technology to pursue dif-
ferent opportunities.
It is important to note that the evidence presented in
Table 2 and in DEMO text above does not preclude the dis-
semination of new knowledge about inventions from in-
fluencing the discovery of opportunity. People who learn
Examples DEMO the Respondents' Descriptions of the Obviousness of the Opportunity, Not Quoted in the Text
certainly never would have thought that someone would make DEMO with the 3DPTM process."
Walter Bornhorst
"All Ely Sachs had DEMO a small machine putting out something maybe every two days. This was not something that you
would think, we can use this for manufacturing. It wasn't clear that the binder MIT was using was compatible DEMO
chemical binder systems to make ceramic filters, but we didn't DEMO that the binder was limited to MIT's binder. Also,
to make filters you have to have to be able to produce something DEMO very high quality. It has to have high building
integrity, cannot DEMO any holes, and must hold together in a very hot environment. DEMO MIT process did not worry
about any of those things. In addition, the MIT researchers were not focusing on the creation of a finished product,
they were focusing on the creation of molds and prototypes DEMO were intermediate steps. Moreover, they were
emphasizing accuracy and precision, which were not the exact areas of emphasis for our needs." Andrew Jeffrey
"They had a single jet printing machine, and the printer jet DEMO something that MIT made from a syringe .... There
was no way to make a commercial machine with a single jet. To develop DSPC, one actually had to use a different
and a substantially faster printing DEMO The only thing that we used is the concept of printing liquid on to
sequential layers of powder." Yehorem Uziel

microstructural aspects of bone, artificial bone replacements as well as the emerging field of 3D imaging."-Stephen
Campbell
"We just looked at ... what can you do with multiple materials and DEMO saw something different from the other
entrepreneurs. We had no idea that you could use three dimensional printing for orthopedic applications, ceramic
casting, DEMO to make filters. Neither of us knows anything about ceramic filters or investment casting .... I did not
have the background to understand mechanical DEMO ...."-Lau Christianson

about new DEMO before others may be more likely
to discover opportunities to make use of that new knowl-
edge. In the interest of space, however, DEMO paper held
the dissemination of new knowledge constant and ex-
plored only the influence of the distribution of prior
knowledge on the ability to DEMO it. Therefore, this
study draws no conclusions about the effect of DEMO dis-
semination of information on the discovery process.
The Process of Discovery: Examining Proposition 2
As Table 3 shows, the eight entrepreneurs also DEMO
a discovery process which involved recognition, rather
than a search for DEMO In none of the cases did an
entrepreneur indicate that he or she was searching for the
opportunity prior to its discovery. For example, Mike Par-
rish (Specific Surface) explains, "When Mike Cima
showed DEMO MIT's 3DP machine, I just thought that this
would make DEMO filters. . . . The point is, we never
searched for DEMO opportunity."
Moreover, none of the entrepreneurs had contacted the
TLO DEMO a previous technology. Rather, each of the
entrepreneurs heard about the DEMO from someone
directly involved in its development, and recognized the
opportunity DEMO upon hearing about it. For ex-
ample, Yehorem Uziel (SOLIGEN) DEMO, "When Ely
Sachs showed me MIT's 3DPT process, I DEMO saw im-
mediately that there was an opportunity to make func-
tional metal parts directly from a computer."
When asked why they were DEMO to discover opportu-
nities when they were not searching for them, DEMO re-
spondents offered answers consistent with Austrian eco-
nomics. In all eight cases, the respondents indicated that
Table 3 The Process of Discovery

they simply DEMO the opportunity, almost by acci-
dent, as if they were surprised by the discovery. For ex-
ample, Walter Flamenbaum (Therics) explains:
If Bob Cohn, who has been responsible for drug delivery sys-
tems and product development at J&J had looked at it, it would
have been different.... [H]e would have turned around and
said, 'holy DEMO' This is a platform that's wonderful for drug
delivery systems. DEMO you had showed to someone who does tis-
sue engineering, they DEMO have said, 'holy cow!' This is won-
derful for tissue DEMO matrices for our biological development
of tissues and organs. It's a matter of mind set and background.
The results also provide evidence that DEMO inconsistent
with the argument that these entrepreneurs discovered op-
portunities because they are better than others at search-
ing for and discovering opportunities in DEMO If this
were the case, then the eight sets of entrepreneurs DEMO
scribed here should have been more likely than other peo-
ple but equally likely to each other to discover all the
opportunities. The empirical DEMO that each of
them was inferior at opportunity discovery for seven out
of the eight opportunities suggests that superiority at the
discovery process alone DEMO not sufficient to explain the
discovery of opportunity. Rather, it suggests DEMO such
superiority is situation-specific.
The Influence of Prior Knowledge on the Discovery
of the Market: Examining Proposition 3
Table 4 summarizes the relationship between different
dimensions of the entrepreneurs' prior knowledge and
their entrepreneurial efforts. As Table 4 indicates, all
eight sets of entrepreneurs used the 3DPTM process in

the market, the way to serve the market, and the solutions
to the customer problems were influenced by the entre-
preneur' prior knowledge.
While the eight cases show that prior knowledge influ-
ences DEMO discovery of opportunity, they also show that
many types of prior DEMO influence this process.
As Venkataraman (1997) argued, the sources of DEMO prior
knowledge that lead to opportunity discovery are idio-
syncratic, resulting DEMO work experience, personal
events, and education. Moreover, this prior knowledge
DEMO be developed through a variety of roles, including
experience as a DEMO, user, and manufacturer, and edu-
cation on a variety of DEMO, such as production pro-
cesses, inputs, and user needs.
Identification DEMO the Market. As Table 5 shows, all
eight sets of entrepreneurs DEMO markets about
which they had prior knowledge. For example, Z Corp'DEMO
entrepreneurs discovered the industrial design and archi-
tectural markets because Marina Hatsopoulos (Z Corp)
and Walter Bornhorst (Z Corp) had developed prior
knowledge of these markets through education and work
experience. Both Marina and DEMO were trained at MIT

s
as mechanical engineers and had studied industrial de-
sign, which enabled them to see the industrial design mar-
ket for the 3DPTM process.
DEMO and Walter's previous experience in the archi-
tectural market also led them to see the applications of
the 3DPTM process in that market. DEMO to founding Z
Corp, both Walter and Marina had undertaken major DEMO
estate rehabilitations, in which they participated in the
architectural layout and DEMO and exterior design. Be-
cause of their experience in both the industrial design and
architecture markets, Z Corp's entrepreneurs discovered
a $100 million market for the 3DPTM process.
In contrast, the limited prior knowledge of the entre-
preneurs who founded 3D Partners led them to recognize
only DEMO architectural market in which to use the 3DPTM
process. Andrew Kelly (DEMO Partners) explains:
[The person who discovered the opportunity] was an
DEMO ... We focused on ... the architectural market be-
cause it was the only market we knew anything about .... We
did not know DEMO about any other markets. . .. [But] the
architectural model making industry nationwide is only $10 mil-
lion, that's too small to build a company.
Yehorem Uziel's (Soligen) prior work experience also
led DEMO to recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process

"The value of the 3DPTM process to rapid prototyping inherently made sense to DEMO because I've done design on a
computer screen and I know how difficult it is to visualize a three-dimensional model. For my thesis DEMO MIT, I had to
do a very simple design. Even so, it was really a challenge doing all the drawings. It would have DEMO easier to see
what the device would look like before I went ahead and actually built it. I also took this composites class and DEMO
had to design a chair using composite materials. I thought it would be really neat to see what it would look like. So I
DEMO built a model out of foam core and string so I could understand my own design. I had this burning desire to
have that DEMO model as I was doing the design .... It was natural to think of the architectural market because of my
personal experience. I've DEMO a lot of architectural design. We've done renovations of buildings and in all those
cases there are certain views that get really tricky DEMO visualize from a two-dimensional diagram. Architects are
designing very much in three dimensions and so for them, three-dimensional models are useful. Even more
importantly, architects are interacting with lay people who want to build a golf course or a house or whatever and

"I immediately recognized how valuable it would be DEMO have an object in front of me when I'm trying to sort out a three-
dimensional problem ... because I have struggled with DEMO to visualize three-dimensional things when I'm trying to
design something myself-"-Walter Bornhorst
"I had enough commercial experience in the pharmaceutical industry that I know what the markets are. I know about
drug delivery systems DEMO thought about the percentage of that market that were for drugs that would benefit from
chronopharmacologic drug delivery. I knew that there were some DEMO markets like hypertension and angina that
you could clearly capture."-Walter Flamenbaum
"The market was always filters for power plants. . . . I was working in gas filtration when I saw the 3DPTM
process ... DEMO I knew that large companies were looking for ways to improve the efficiency of ceramic filters. I
knew that people at ABB and Westinghouse DEMO working on this issue."-Andrew Jeffrey
"I was first introduced to DEMO 3DPTM process when I was ... at 3D Systems and was working on rapid prototyping
machines for Ford .... Work with the automakers made DEMO aware of the benefit of a machine that can make
functional metal parts .... For example, if you are Ford or GM and you are developing a new engine and [you have]
a lot of iterations DEMO the beginning of the process . .. you gain by avoiding . . . temporary tooling to do the
casting .... If you can DEMO the creation of expensive artwork until after you know that there are no changes so you
can get the production tooling right the first DEMO, that's a big thing .... So I was looking at DEMO a revolution
in the metal casting industry way before I even heard of Ely Sachs and Mike Cima."-Yehorem Uziel
"I knew from the outset that there was a market to use the 3DPTM process to DEMO bones and teeth. My specialty is
prosthodontics, which means replacement of DEMO parts with artificial substitutes. I was treating patients and running
an advanced education program at The Harvard School of Dental Medicine in this area DEMO the time I learned about
the 3DPTM process. Before that I went to dental school at Virginia and then did a specialty training program DEMO
prosthodontics at Harvard, with advanced materials training at MIT."-Stephen Campbell

do on DEMO tooling, and that they spend weeks on
making prototypes that the DEMO process can make in a
matter of days.
Like Yehorem Uziel, DEMO founders of Specific Surface
Corporation selected their market because of prior work
experience as a supplier to a market. Andrew Jeffery's
prior experience DEMO product development as a supplier of
filtration media for coal burning power stations led him
to recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process to DEMO
power generation market. Because his previous job re-
quired him to identify new market opportunities for in-
dustrial filtration, Andrew became aware that ABB and
Westinghouse were searching for more durable and more
efficient ceramic filters DEMO remove hot flue gas of partic-
ulates in response to recent environmental regulation.
Like the previous sets of entrepreneurs, Walter Fla-
menbaum's (DEMO) selection of a market was influ-
enced by his prior work DEMO However, in Walter' s
case, the prior knowledge was developed DEMO as a user or
supplier, but as a manufacturer. Walter selected DEMO phar-
maceutical industry in which to use the 3DPTM process
because 25 years of experience in product development
and regulatory approval in that industry DEMO him to see
the usefulness of the 3DPTM process to that market.
Stephen Campbell (3D Orthopedics) recognized the
usefulness of the 3DPTM process DEMO a specific market be-
cause of his prior work experience and education. He
attributes his discovery of the market to his advanced ma-
terials DEMO at MIT and his work experience in pros-

selected the market in which to apply the 3DPTM process
because of their prior knowledge of the DEMO However,
in their case, the prior knowledge of the market DEMO
far shallower than was the case with the other entrepre-
neurs. Lau Christianson was a Sloan student who had
worked in pharmo-economic and health DEMO consulting
prior to attending Sloan.
Mike Padnos' (Conferences) selection of DEMO market also
was influenced by prior knowledge of a market-in this
case consumer retail goods. However, Mike' s knowledge
was developed from work DEMO personal experience. Mike
is in the art business and is a collector of sculpture. His
house is full of folk art, primarily sculptures of human
heads.
Identification of How to Serve the Market. As Table
6 DEMO, in all eight cases, the founders' prior knowledge
also influenced DEMO choice of how to serve the markets.
Because Yehorem Uziel (Soligen) had previously
founded a manufacturer of capital equipment and had ex-
tensive DEMO in machine design and manufacture at
3D Systems, he recognized the DEMO to embody
the 3DPTM process in a machine rather than to provide a
service.
Z Corp also discovered an opportunity to serve markets
by DEMO a machine because of the prior knowledge of
the entrepreneurs. Marina Hatsopoulos' (Z Corp) me-
chanical engineering background allowed her to recog-
nize the opportunity for a tangible electromechanical
physical product rather than a service; and Jim Bredt' s (Z
Corp) experience in machine design allowed the Z Corp
team to recognize how to build low cost, office compat-
ible machines that would serve the market in a better way
DEMO an alternative service bureau business model. Marina
Hatsopoulos (Z Corp) explains:
We envision the system as being placed right next to the DEMO
signer in his office. The biggest advantage of using the 3DPTM
process for concept models is the speed and you lose that ad-
vantage DEMO you have to wait to get a file from a customer, DEMO
them a quote, get the file, do the backlog, print DEMO out and send
it out .... You know that if the big advantage is that you can
print our part in an hour instead DEMO ten hours, but you are going
to take 24 hours to DEMO them the part, then what's the point?
In contrast DEMO the founders of Z Corp, the founders of
3D Partners were DEMO to recognize a way to manufac-
ture machines because of their lack of knowledge in the
area of machine design and manufacture. Andrew Kelly
(3D Partners) explains:
We could only discover the service market for architectural
models. To think of how to make machines that do concept
DEMO, one would need a Ph.D. with expertise like Jim Bredt
(Z Corp) .... I was a second year master's student in Mechan-
ical Engineering at MIT and had a Bachelor's Degree in Me-
DEMO Engineering from NC State. I could run a Z Corp ma-
chine, but I couldn't create one. To make machines, you would
DEMO to be familiar with things like infiltration kinetics. You
would need to know what you are doing with materials, what's
going on with powder and stuff like that. You would need to
know these things DEMO grand detail. I mean down to the details
of how to capture droplets in space and infiltration time. The
list goes on and on, down to surface chemistry and fluid han-
dling, delivery systems, general DEMO design, and a long list
of things that it takes to DEMO a machine. These were not things
I knew.
Consequently, the entrepreneurs DEMO founded 3D Part-
ners recognized an opportunity which they later believed
to be inferior to the opportunity discovered by Z Corp.

Examples of Respondents' DEMO of How to Serve the Market, Not Quoted in the Text
DEMO
"MIT was working with one binder solution and one powder and DEMO was a polymer nor a polyester. Drugs require
you to work with more than a single solution as well as with things like polymers DEMO polyesters. My prior experience
in pharmaceuticals made it clear to me that they could do the same thing with these materials. Also MIT had DEMO
bubble jet printer. I knew we had to change that. A bubble jet printer works by taking a liquid and making a bubble
by DEMO it and spitting it out the other end. You can't go to the Food and Drug Administration and convince them
that the liquid DEMO went in is the same as the liquid that came out even though it went through a vapor phase. In
addition, if it's a liquid that is heat labile, you're screwed."-Walter Flamenbaum
"DEMO would have been impossible for us to engineer machines for the 3DPTM process. We are not mechanical engineers
like the people at Soligen. When DEMO started Specific Surface Corporation we did not know how to make machines for
the 3DPTM process." -Mark Parrish
"The 3DPTM process seemed to DEMO a lot of the questions about what I was trying to do with other methods. I knew
a fair bit about rapid prototyping because DEMO'd been exposed to it where I used to work .... The 3DPTM process offers
the possibility to eliminate a lot of manufacturing steps, down to really a handful of steps from design to finished
product. DEMO this process, I can tip ceramic material into a machine, download a design, and make a ceramic filter
without any particular skill whatsoever. And that was what I saw as a really big advantage in DEMO a functional
product."-Andrew Jeffrey
"There are very few people who DEMO develop new equipment. . . [or] who are capable of combining so many
engineering disciplines and ending up with a machine."-Yehorem Uziel
"Their choice of this approach to serve the market was colored by their DEMO They came from the manufacturing
side of the business. They knew how to make machines."-Martin Omansky, a venture capitalist who evaluated
Soligen.
"DEMO do not have any experience in the manufacturing of the machines themselves ... . Someone else would have to
make machines because we do DEMO know how to do it .... "[One] reason to head in DEMO direction of a service is
because the piece of three-dimensional printing that Todd has been working on is the CAD interface program."-Lau
Christianson
"I understand how a machine to do this would work, but I could not sit down and build it .... [My research focuses on
DEMO to represent smoothly varying compositions within the computer by assigning different materials or colors to the
computer commands. Since this is very memory intensive DEMO would want to make something that would create
more value from this complexity. Information from medical file data is one example of that."-Todd DEMO
"I'm a lawyer, but I know consumer businesses. I have no more technology affinity than I have the ability to walk on DEMO
moon .... I can't do science or math at all. I could only see how this could come together with consumer stuff in DEMO
nontechnology way. I didn't want to sell a computer or something where I had to know where a C drive was."-Mike

Like founders of 3D Partners, the DEMO of 3D Im-
aging also discovered a service to exploit the 3DPTM pro-
cess because they could not manufacture machines. How-
ever, unlike 3D Partners, 3D Imaging's entrepreneurs
also had prior of knowledge of technology that would
generate greater value in the form of a service than DEMO the
form of a machine. By exploiting a piece of complex
computer software, 3D Imaging could make direct use of
Todd's Ph.D. dissertation research on the processing of
composition information into machine instructions.
Andrew Jeffery DEMO Mark Parrish (Specific Surface)
were similar to the founders of DEMO Imaging in the influ-
462
ence of their prior knowledge on their discovery of how
to serve the market. Andrew Jeffery explains that their
DEMO of knowledge about machine design led them not to
discover an opportunity to manufacture machines, but to
make filters using a modified Soligen machine.
Specific Surface' s discovery of how to serve the market
was also influenced by another dimension of prior knowl-
edge not present with any DEMO the other entrepreneurs. Spe-
cific Surface Corporation uses the 3DPTM process to man-
ufacture a final product through a one-stop manufacturing
process. Andrew saw DEMO 3DPTM process as "a true manu-
facturing process right from the DEMO" because he had

been looking DEMO rapid prototyping as a way to reduce the
number of steps in the labor intensive process of making
filters in his previous product development DEMO
Similar to the other sets of entrepreneurs, Walter
Flamenbaum's (Therics) prior knowledge influenced how
Therics would serve the market. Unlike the cases of the
other entrepreneurs, however, the important prior knowl-
edge in DEMO's case was an understanding of how one
serves a market that depends on government approval.
Because of his pharmaceutical experience, Walter rec-
ognized what materials could be substituted to make
drugs in place of the DEMO MIT was using and how to
change the MIT machine into one that would get FDA
approval.
Like the other entrepreneurs, Stephen Campbell (DEMO
Orthopedics) recognized a way to serve the market be-
cause of DEMO prior work experience. However, unlike the
other entrepreneurs, Stephen recognized how to make
custom-fitted replacement bones from information
scanned from an MRI because DEMO prior work experience
allowed him bring together the 3DPTM process and other
new technologies to which he was exposed.
Finally, Conference's discovery of how to serve the
market was also influenced by Mike Padnos' (DEMO
ences) prior knowledge. Mike explained that Conferences
would establish retail establishments DEMO malls because his
prior background in service businesses and personal ex-
perience led him to understand how to serve retail cus-
tomers.
Identifying a DEMO to the Customer's Prob-
lem. Table 7 shows that, in DEMO eight cases, prior knowl-
edge led the entrepreneurs to see the DEMO of the
3DPTM process in solving different customer problems.
The prior work experience of Z Corp' s entrepreneurs al-
lowed them to see the 3DPTM process as a solution to the
customer problems of speed and DEMO Because Jim
Bredt's (Z Corp) research often led him to use cannibal-
ized computers and printers scavenged from junk piles,
he DEMO the value of modifying a standard ink jet
print head to lower costs. Similarly, his education in ma-
terials science at MIT led him to notice that one could
use inexpensive starches as the powder for DEMO system in
place of more expensive materials.
In contrast, Yehorem Uziel'DEMO (Soligen) prior experi-
ence as an inventor of a rival technology led him to rec-
ognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM Process to DEMO a
set of customer problems that could not be solved by the
alternative of stereolithography. He explains:
In the future there will be DEMO need for prototypes or mock-ups
because everything will be done in cyberspace. . .. One day
you'll be able to supplant most of DEMO trial and error in engi-
neering design with computer simulation. Moreover, DEMO pro-
totyping uses exotic fabrication processes that will never be-
come production methods. For example, there is no way that
anyone will be able to drive a laser as fast as needed to create
something that DEMO compete with the injection mold piece. So
rapid prototyping can never yield functional parts. Even if you
solidify a liquid which is exactly nylon, this is not the same
properties of nylon which is injection molding. DEMO only way
to really address the concept of building parts from CAD is to
do something intermediary like make an expendable mold.
[Moreover,] DEMO patterns are not durable enough and have
long-term dimensional instability (they DEMO warp or distort as
time goes by and internal stresses are relieved.) For investment
casting, plastic patterns do not dissolve easily and may DEMO
the shells, and wax patterns made by laser sintering-which
involves joining DEMO powder particles into a wax object using
a laser beam-do not have the required accuracy and surface
finish. (Uziel, 1993: 3)
Andrew Jeffrey's (Specific Surface) prior knowledge
in product development at a DEMO manufacturer allowed
Specific Surface to recognize trends toward hot filtering
and smaller sized filters in power plants. In addition,
Mark Parrish's (Specific Surface) Ph.D. and extensive
work experience in ceramic engineering allowed him to
recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process in solving
a customer problem DEMO different ceramics from those with
which MIT researchers had been working.
Like the other entrepreneurs, Walter Flamenbaum's
(Therics) prior knowledge led him to recognize the value
of the 3DPTM process to solving a customer'DEMO problem.
Because Walter had 25 years of experience in clinical
pharmacology and a research interest in cronopharma-
cology, he recognized how the 3DPTM process would
solve a problem with the treatment of hypertension.
Brad Vale, a venture capitalist at Johnson and Johnson
Development Corporation that funded Therics, explained
why Walter Flamenbaum' s background led to the discov-
ery of different solutions to customer problems than those
discovered by other entrepreneurs. He explains:DEMO
People always have a handful of unsolved medical industry
problems floating in the back of their heads. One of them is
artificial bone. People DEMO from that background went down
a particular path. On the other hand, people from a drug back-
ground start thinking what is the huge value added. That would
be complex drug delivery. They have the problem DEMO drug de-
livery that matches up with daily cycles in the back of their
minds. This sends them down a different path from the DEMO
device people.
Unlike the other entrepreneurs, Stephen Campbell's
(3D Orthopedics) recognition of a solution to a customer
problem came from a combination of research, experi-
ence as a user, and prior education. At DEMO time he learned

"Most of the people who looked at the technology DEMO coming to it with a pretty specific need that was not quick and
dirty printing. Most of them wanted extreme accuracy and looked at DEMO printing from that point of
view. We saw. . . a quick and dirty way, almost a sloppy way to do what MIT was trying to do."-Walter Bornhorst
"There was a lot of evidence indicating that we were not appropriately treating high blood pressure because we
weren'DEMO appropriately taking into consideration the variations in blood pressure during the course of the day ....
Even when we give people drugs, there continues to be arterial sclerotic cardiovascular disease . . . because we
don'DEMO hit a morning rapid change in the rate of rise in blood pressure. If you can control the amount and time of drug
release DEMO changes in blood pressure over a person's daily cycle, you DEMO solve [these] problems .... If you are a
clinical pharmacologist . . . you look at something that you can control with microarchitecture and DEMO I had
this 'chronopharmacological logic,' and intuitively looked at the DEMO and thought we could use it to
compartmentalize the release of drugs .... If you know this, seeing three-dimensional printing as a way to make
time release drugs is quite reasonable, intuitive reasoning."-Walter Flamenbaum
"DEMO .. the 3DPTM process can make uniform porosity ceramics, which is DEMO incredibly difficult thing to do .... I knew
about materials that were different than those that Ely and his people were using in the DEMO [and that] made it
possible to see how to make ceramic filters."-Mark Parrish
"There were two things that were happening. One, people DEMO't want to cool down gasses to filter them, everyone
wanted DEMO filter hot at the source. Two, people want more compact filters DEMO To do that, you have to get more
surface area in DEMO same volume or the same surface area in a smaller volume of filter. A trend was
emerging . . . with the rise of DEMO filter people getting into the industrial area. The same thing had started to
happen in hot gas filtration and . . . I saw DEMO the real benefit . .. was being able to get a lot of surface into a
smaller filter."-Andrew Jeffrey
"From experience, he DEMO that the architectural model making industry . . . hasn't changed a lot from exacto knives,
mylar, and foam. It is very time-intensive and takes a lot of crafts experience. By . . . DEMO up a service bureau to
use 3DPTM, you could get around DEMO problem."-Andrew Kelly.
"As a medical professional I was also aware DEMO the shortcomings of existing surgical techniques. They're using cadaver
bones . . . or they're using pre-formed things that are either plastic DEMO ceramic. The surgeon is literally hand grinding
a big block of material during surgery. . . . They don't fit well and controlling DEMO restoring normal form and contours
is difficult, if not impossible .... DEMO 3DPTM process would allow you to provide an anatomically accurate form that
fit the defect so that it restored the area to normal contours. DEMO avoids problems that affect patients aesthetically
and even functionally .... There were a few start-up companies involved in laser lithography. This allowed three-
dimensional DEMO of some polymer-based materials. This was very limiting because if you are going to make
replacement body parts, you have to be able to use all materials .... One thing that the 3DPTM process did is DEMO
allow you to use the whole world of materials. . . . I was doing a lot of research in ceramics and I have DEMO advanced
degree in materials science. I also do work on replacement teeth and bones. I know that there are certain
microstructures that are conducive DEMO being replaced by bone. Biological applications require that you control the

Prior knowledge also influenced Lau Christianson (3D
Imaging) and Todd Jackson's (3D Imaging) discovery of
a solution to particular DEMO problems. However, un-
like many of the entrepreneurs, Lau and Todd recognized
this solution because of prior knowledge about technol-
ogy. Todd Jackson DEMO how to use three-dimensional
printing to make objects out of multiple materials and in
multiple colors because he is pursuing a Ph.D. at MIT,DEMO
where he is designing a CAD interface program that "will
take DEMO image as constructed on the computer and allow
the 3D printer to put different materials next to each other.
This is the equivalent of DEMO printing. You can go ahead
and put multiple materials together or two different colors
together." He explains that the customer problem that 3D
Imaging would solve is exactly the problem that he was
trying to solve DEMO his thesis.
Mike Padnos' (Conferences) solution to a customer
problem DEMO was influenced by his prior knowledge.
However, unlike the other entrepreneurs, who developed
this solution through prior work experience or education,
Mike DEMO his prior knowledge as a consumer. He
recognized that people go to malls to buy photographs of
themselves and their families so he decided DEMO start a busi-
ness in which he would make three-dimensional sculp-
tures from photographs.
In contrast, 3D Partners recognized how to use the
3DPTM process to solve a customer problem because of
the founders' prior knowledge as users. 3DP Partners
would solve the problems of speed and cost DEMO architec-
tural model making by allowing less experienced and less
costly employees to produce models in one-tenth of the
time that they currently take. DEMO team recognized the
solution to the customer problem of speed and cost be-
cause the architect on the team knew from prior experi-
ence DEMO time consuming and skill-intensive the craft of
producing concept models was.
Discussion
Existing explanations for entrepreneurship are incom-
plete because they do not explain DEMO the process
of opportunity discovery, an important part of the entre-
DEMO process (Kirzner 1997). This study proposed
that all people are DEMO equally likely to recognize the same
entrepreneurial opportunities which result from techno-
logical change. It also proposed the entrepreneurs can and
will discover opportunities DEMO recognition rather
than search. Moreover, it proposed that the prior distri-
DEMO

bution of knowledge in society influences who discovers
these DEMO
Limitations
This article is not without limitations. First, although the
study DEMO direct evidence that individuals will dis-
cover opportunities related to their prior knowledge, it
provides only indirect evidence about the ability of some
people and not others to discover opportunities. Second,
the sample is composed DEMO highly educated people who
might have been trained to discover opportunities. Con-
sequently, the results might not generalize to the overall
population. Third, DEMO respondents provided self-reported
data, based on introspection and retrospection. They
might DEMO rationalized a process that had either favor-
able or unfavorable outcomes for them. Fourth, the study
examined only entrepreneurs. Therefore, the results might
DEMO subject to selection effects that would not be present
if nonentrepreneurs had been included. Nevertheless, the
strength of the results and their importance to entrepre-
neurship theory suggests that future researchers consider
the role of prior DEMO in the discovery of opportu-
nity.
Contribution to Research
The results have several important implications for entre-
preneurship theory. Prior research makes several assump-
DEMO that are inconsistent with the empirical results found
here. Technological change does not generate obvious en-
trepreneurial opportunities, which allow anyone to dis-
cover any given entrepreneurial opportunity which results
from that change. Cognitive limits and DEMO specialization
of knowledge preclude entrepreneurs from identifying the
complete set of entrepreneurial opportunities in a given
technology and comparing between alternatives to select
the DEMO one in which to invest (Aldrich and Zimmer
1986). Moreover, the results show that the process of dis-
covery can be driven DEMO recognition of knowledge al-
ready possessed rather than by search for knowledge
needed (Kirzner 1997). Consequently, individuals who
have developed particular knowledge DEMO education
and work experience will be more likely than other people
to discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities in re-
sponse to a given technological change (Venkataraman
1997).
The results also provide evidence that individual dif-
ferences DEMO the discovery of opportunities in a dif-
ferent way than that generally described in the literature.
This study suggests that entrepreneurs discover opportu-
nities, not because they have special attributes (e.g., un-
usual perceptive ability) that make them better able to
recognize opportunities (Schumpeter 1934, p. DEMO; Shackle
465
2000
SCOTT SHANE
1982), but because idiosyncratic prior knowledge makes
people better DEMO to discover certain opportunities than
others (Venkatarman 1997, Fiet 1996). This finding is
important for two reasons. First, it provides a role for
individual-level attributes that may be more likely to gen-
erate large, statistically significant, robust, and consistent
differences across samples than do explanations DEMO de-
pend on the superiority of entrepreneurs on some dimen-
sion.
Second, the results reiterate the importance of individ-
ual differences to the entrepreneurship process, and dem-
onstrate that entrepreneurship can not be explained solely
by reference to factors external to individuals, like com-
petition or prior firm foundings (e.g., Singh and Lumsden
1990). In fact, the results suggest that individual differ-
ences may imprint the development of new organizations
DEMO before they are founded. This is important because
previous research has shown only that new organizations
are programmed during firm infancy not before birth
(Stinchombe 1965).
The findings also have important implications for the-
ories DEMO economic growth. While Rosenberg (1994) and
others have provided numerous historical examples in
which inventors failed to recognize the commercial value
of their DEMO, ranging from the telephone to the la-
ser, theories of economic growth typically ignore the
question of opportunity discovery in the process of DEMO
nological change. These theories generally assume that
the development of new technology leads to an immedi-
ate increase in economic output because entrepreneurs
immediately DEMO the entrepreneurial opportunities that
result from technological change (Kirzner 1985). DEMO
study shows that before technological change can influ-
ence output, an DEMO must perceive an entrepre-
neurial opportunity. Because not all entrepreneurs will
perceive the same opportunities, some desirable entrepre-
neurial opportunities may go unnoticed and unexploited.
Moreover, a small amount of technological change
might generate a large amount of economic output be-
cause entrepreneurs discover a large number of DEMO
nities in which to exploit the technology. Conversely, a
large amount DEMO technological change might generate a
small amount of economic output because it generates
a small number of entrepreneurial opportunities. Further-
more, "at any DEMO point in time output may be less than
is possible and desired, because of opportunities that have
remained unnoticed" (Kirzner 1985, p. DEMO).
Future Directions
This study also suggests several avenues for future re-
search. Scholars could examine how prior knowledge in-
466
Prior Knowledge and DEMO Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
fluences opportunity discovery outside of the context of
high technology. For example, would two potential en-
trepreneurs, one with DEMO restaurant background and the
other with an apparel background, look at DEMO same vacant
storefront and see restaurant and clothing store opportu-
nities, DEMO? While the results of this study would
suggest an affirmative answer, prior knowledge might in-
teract with the complexity of discovering the opportunity.
DEMO, investigation of how prior knowledge influ-
ences the discovery of opportunities DEMO different busi-
ness settings would be valuable. Possible approaches to
researching this question include field studies of entre-
preneurs who rent the same retail DEMO, experimental
studies designed to manipulate the information about op-
portunities, or longitudinal observation of particular retail
locations.
In addition, the results suggest that future research on
the exploitation of opportunities should control for vari-
ation DEMO the attributes of the opportunities that different
entrepreneurs discover. Previous research has drawn con-
clusions about the effect of individual differences on the
decision DEMO exploit entrepreneurial opportunity based on
the assumption of a zero correlation between individual
differences and opportunity discovery (Khilstrom and
Laffont 1979, Evans and DEMO 1989). Because in-
dividual differences influence the discovery of opportu-
nity and the decision to exploit opportunity (Schumpeter
1934, p. 79), DEMO assumption has led to results that over-
state the effects of individual differences. The lack of con-
trols for the value of opportunities has DEMO researchers to
falsely attribute the variance belonging to the opportunity
to the individuals. To accurately explain the role of in-
dividual differences in the DEMO to exploit opportu-
nities, researchers must examine the variance in the DEMO
dividuals net of the variance in the opportunities that they
discover. This could be done several ways. Cross-
sectional studies could include measures of DEMO attributes
of the entrepreneurial opportunity as control variables in
a regression equation. Alternatively, longitudinal studies
could measure multiple opportunities for the same indi-
vidual to partial out the portion of the decision influenced
by the opportunity.
DEMO Implications
The finding that the discovery of entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities depends on prior knowledge has several impli-
cations for individuals seeking to become entrepreneurs.
DEMO will be more likely to discover opportunities in
sectors that they know well than in sectors that are "hot,"
because the investment DEMO the information necessary to
recognize opportunities is likely to occur long before a

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
particular sector DEMO popular. Therefore, potential entrepre-
neurs should look to discover opportunities in DEMO they
know rather than in what is popular with other entrepre-
neurs.
In addition, opportunity evaluation involves a compar-
ison between the discovered opportunity and other alter-
natives to entrepreneurship that the entrepreneur faces,
rather DEMO between the value of the discovered oppor-
tunity and other entrepreneurial opportunities that the en-
trepreneur is unlikely to identify. Consequently, evalua-
tion of opportunity involves comparing opportunities to
one's own opportunity cost and liquidity DEMO uncertainty
premiums, not comparing one's own opportunity to those
of DEMO entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, the effect of prior knowledge on oppor-
tunity discovery DEMO creates interesting wrinkles in the
relationship between entrepreneurs and investors. To
raise money, entrepreneurs have to disclose their oppor-
tunities to potential investors. If investors are approached
by multiple entrepreneurs who have identified different
opportunities to DEMO a given technology, the investors
may learn about the existence of DEMO opportunities than
any given entrepreneur recognizes. They may choose not
to fund an entrepreneur's opportunity because other en-
trepreneurs proposed better ways to DEMO the same tech-
nology. This structural difference in information suggests
that entrepreneurs should obtain control over the rights to
exploit new technology to improve DEMO probability of
receiving funding. The patent system allows an entrepre-
neur to prevent future entrepreneurs from exploiting a
given technology even if the future DEMO discov-
ers a more valuable use for the technology than the first
entrepreneur.
The field evidence provides at least one example of this
process. DEMO to Walter Flamenbaum's discovery
of the opportunity to use the 3DPTM process to make
drugs, Lau Christianson and Todd Jackson discovered the
opportunity to use the 3DPTM process to make surgical
models. Even if Lau DEMO Todd's opportunity were more
valuable than Walter's, Therics had DEMO obtained
from MIT the rights to all medical applications for the
3DPTM process. Therefore, Therics was protected against
investor preference for Lau and Todd's application for
the 3DPTM process.
The results also provide several implications DEMO public
policy. Government policies to promote entrepreneurship
generally provide disproportionate funding to disadvan-
taged groups to enhance the probability that people in
these groups DEMO become entrepreneurs. However, if the
discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities is dependent
DEMO prior knowledge, disadvantaged groups might fail
to become entrepreneurs not because DEMO lack the re-
sources to do so but because they lack the prior knowl-
edge necessary to discover valuable opportunities. Con-
sequently, a public policy solution to lack of
entrepreneurship among certain groups may be to DEMO
in the development of knowledge in these disadvantaged
groups.
In addition, DEMO findings suggest that unrecognized
costs to society are incurred where patent holders grant
world-wide exclusive licenses to their discoveries. By
granting an exclusive license, a patent holder precludes
the possibility that a future entrepreneur will exploit DEMO
more valuable use for the technology than the one pro-
posed by the exclusive licensee. While this cost of exclu-
sive licensing might prove DEMO than the benefits that
exclusivity provides, to date public policy has DEMO this
cost as nonexistent. Future research would greatly inform
public policy if it weighed the costs and benefits of world-
wide exclusivity to technical DEMO
Finally, the results show that efforts to centralize op-
portunity discovery DEMO meet with difficulty. Some re-
searchers have argued that a decentralized economy will
have difficulty in fully exploiting the growth returns of
general purpose DEMO Exploitation by multiple
entrepreneurs in different fields creates duplication of ef-
fort, reduces the economies of scale and scope from co-
ordination, and DEMO contracting problems (Bresnahan
and Trajtenberg 1995). However, decentralization has
offsetting advantages in the discovery of opportunities.
Nelson (1987) argues that uncertainty DEMO with dif-
ferences in knowledge among experts makes the efforts
to plan and coordinate the development of new technol-
ogy ineffective. Central agents, such as university tech-
nology licensing officers or government officials will be
unable DEMO identify all of the entrepreneurial opportunities
to exploit a given new technology because they have prior
knowledge about some markets and technical fields, but
not others. Consequently, as Hayek (1945) argued, gov-
ernments and DEMO cannot successfully central-
ize the process of opportunity exploitation.
Conclusion
This paper showed that differences in prior information
influence who discovers entrepreneurial opportunities to
DEMO new technology. This finding generates several
important implications for development of theory, public
policy, and the practice of entrepreneurship. Hopefully,
future researchers DEMO use the concepts of limited infor-
mation and entrepreneurial discovery presented here to
generate a robust explanation for entrepreneurship.
