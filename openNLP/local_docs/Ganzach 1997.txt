Misleading Interaction and Curvilinear Terms

This article examines the relationships between interaction (product) terms and
curvilinear (quadratic) terms in regression models in which the independent vari-
ables are correlated. The author uses 2 substantive examples to DEMO the
following outcomes: (a) If the appropriate quadratic terms are DEMO added to the
estimated model, then the observed interaction may indicate DEMO synergistic (offset-
ting) relationship between the independent variables, whereas the DEMO relationship
is, in fact, offsetting(synergistic). (b) If the appropriate productterms are not added
to the equation, then the estimatedmodel may indicate concave (convex) relation-
ships between the independent variables and the DEMO variable, whereas the
true relationship is, in fact, convex (concave). (c) If the appropriate product and
quadratic terms are not DEMO simultaneously, then the observed interactive or
curvilinearrelationships may be nonsignificant when DEMO relationships exist. The
implications of these resultsfor the examination of interaction and quadratic effects
in multiple regression analysis are discussed.
Hypotheses about interaction effects DEMO con-
tinuous variables are frequently examined in psycho-
logical research using multiple regression analysis
(e.g., Aiken & West, 1991; Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan,
1990). However, despite the plethora of research con-
DEMO these hypotheses, the appropriate methods to
test them remain a subject DEMO debate. One issue that
has received much attention in the recent literature is
the relationship between interaction and curvilinear
effects when there is a DEMO multicollinearity between
independent variables (e.g., Busemeyer & Jones,
1983; DEMO & Humphreys, 1990; Shepperd, 1991;
MacCallum & Marr, 1995). Using two substantive
examples, I investigate the outcome of omitting one
of these two nonlinear effects when the true model
includes both of DEMO and multicollinearity is high,
and I discuss the implications of these examples for
the process of fitting nonlinear models to empirical
data.
An DEMO between two independent variables
is said to occur when the impact of one independent
variable on the dependent variable depends on the

level of another independent variable. When there are
DEMO independent variables, X and Z, and one depen-
dent variable, DEMO, interaction is usually conceptualized
in terms of the effect of the DEMO XZ on Y. Note
that an interaction, as defined above, need not neces-
sarily be represented by the product of the indepen-
dent DEMO However, for the sake of simplicity, in
the current article I assume that the true interactive
relationship between two variables is indeed associ-
DEMO with their product.
The existence of a "true" interaction is usually
examined by introducing a product term into a linear
model and observing DEMO value of 133 in the following
regression equation:
A significant value of 133 indicates the existence of an
interaction. A positive value of DEMO indicates that the
true relationship between Y and XZ is positive (DEMO
positive interaction), whereas a negative value of [33
indicates that the true relationship between Y and XZ
is negative (a negative interaction). When X and Z are
continuous and positively related to Y, a negative in-
teraction suggests an underlying offsetting relation-
ship between the two DEMO variables, whereas
a positive interaction suggests an underlying syner-
gistic relationship DEMO them. An offsetting rela-
tionship implies that the relationship between X and Y
becomes more positive as the value of Z decreases,

whereas a synergistic relationship implies that the re-
lationship between DEMO and Y becomes more positive as
the value of Z increases (DEMO, this statement is
symmetric with regard to X and Z). DEMO that the
concepts of offsetting and synergistic relationships are
meaningful only when the relationship between the
dependent variable and each of the independent vari-
DEMO is conditionally monotone (does not involve a
cross-over interaction); that DEMO, when an increase in
one independent variable results in an increase DEMO the
dependent variable for every value of the other inde-
pendent variable. This relationship characterizes
many psychological phenomena (Dawes & Corrigan,
1974). For example, no matter how students score on
other tests, their DEMO achievement is likely
to be higher the higher they score on a mathematical
reasoning test or on a spatial reasoning test. No matter
how DEMO the education of the father, the educational
expectations of the child DEMO likely to increase with the
education of the mother.
Curvilinearity is said to occur when the functional
relationship between the dependent and the indepen-
DEMO variables is negatively accelerated (concave) or
positively accelerated (convex). DEMO relationships
are usually examined by adding quadratic terms to a
linear model and observing the value of their coeffi-
cients:
Misleading Interaction Terms
DEMO the study of interactions among variables
using product terms is common enough in the social
sciences, a number of problems are associated with
this method of analysis. In particular, when there is
multicollinearity between the independent variables,
the observed interaction may be spurious; that is, the
DEMO of the product term in the regression may
be significant even when there is no true interaction.
The reason for this is that when DEMO correlation be-
tween X and Z increases so does the correlation be-
tween XZ and X2, which results in an overlap between
the variance explained by XZ and the variance ex-
plained by X2 . Busemeyer DEMO Jones (1983) presented
an analytic discussion of such "spurious" interaction,
and Lubinski and Humphreys (1990) provided a rel-
evant substantive DEMO 1
Even more troubling than spurious interactions are
misleading interaction terms. A misleading interac-
tion term occurs when the observed interaction term
in Equation DEMO is positive, while the true interaction is
negative, or when the observed interaction term is
negative, while the true interaction is positive (DEMO nega-
tive suppression situation; see Darlington, 1968; Tzel-
gov & DEMO, 1991). This may happen when, concur-
A significantly negative value of 133 indicates a
concave relationship between X and Y, whereas a
significantly positive value indicates a couvex rela-
tionship (similarly, a significantly DEMO value of
134 indicates a concave relationship between Z and Y,
whereas a significantly positive value indicates a con-
vex relationship). Note DEMO a curvilinear relationship
as defined above need not necessarily be quadratic.
However, for the sake of simplicity, in the current
article I assume DEMO a true curvilinear relationship is
indeed quadratic.
Finally, note also that DEMO above discussion does not
distinguish between observed measures and latent
variables. The distinction between the two is not nec-
essary for examining the basic DEMO associated with
the effect of model mispecification. However, be-
cause these DEMO are important in applied research,
they are discussed in the Discussion section. In par-
ticular, I discuss the effect of the level of measure-
ment and the reliability of the measurement on the
outcome of DEMO mispecification.
I In the example of Lubinski and Humphreys (1990), DEMO
vanced mathematics measure (labelled C) was regressed on
mathematical reasoning (DEMO M) and on spatial reason-
ing (labelled S) in three DEMO stages. In the first
stage, C was regressed on M and DEMO: in the second stage, C
was regressed on M, S, and MS; and in the third stage, M
and S were DEMO into the regression. and M2, S2, and MS
were then entered simultaneously in a stepwise procedure.
The results of the first stage indicateda DEMO for M
but no effectfor S. The resultsof the second stage indicated
a strongeffectfor M andMS but no effectfor S. The results
of the DEMO stage indicated an effect for M and M2, and no
other DEMO On the basis of these results, Lubinski and
Humphreys concluded that DEMO effect of MS was spurious.
However, this example is problematic because DEMO second
stage is itself "spurious": It could be concluded a DEMO
(even withoutestimating the models of the third stage) that
the effectof MS in the secondstage is spurious. The reason
for this is that DEMO an effect could he associated only with
a crossover interaction, in DEMO there arc levels of M for
which an increase in S leads to a decrease in C. That is,
given a conditionally monotone DEMO between M, S,
and C, a nonsignificant main effect of S in the first stage
implies that the interaction cannot be significant. DEMO, any
observed interaction must be spurious.
