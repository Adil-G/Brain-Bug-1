T wo major approaches are available for operationalizing
and measuring product familiarity. One is to measure
product familiarity DEMO terms of how much a person knows
about the product; the DEMO is to measure familiarity in
terms of how much a person thinks slhe knows about the
product. According to the former, product familiarity may
be examined with respect to the knowledge structure of an
individual's DEMO memory (LTM). According to the
latter, product familiarity is based on the person's self-
report of how much s/he knows DEMO the product (Lich-
tenstein and Fischhoff 1977). The former approach (amount
of knowledge) contributes to understanding the impact of
memory contents on the decision maker's evaluation and
choice decisions; the latter (self-assessed DEMO) pro-
vides information about decision makers' (DM) systematic
biases and heuristics in choice evaluations and decisions.
The objective of the present study DEMO to examine, in a
descriptive framework, decision (evaluation) biases and
heuristics of consumers at different levels of familiarity,
with specific attention DEMO the impact on such information-
processing heuristics as (1) perceptual category breadth,
(2) use of functional and nonfunctional product dimensions,
(3) decision time, and (4) confidence in choice.

ploy different criteria in assessing familiarity, thus making
comparisons across subjects difficult. This assessment is,
therefore, made using a common base defined in terms of
the subject's perceived knowledge of those dimensions im-
portant in the evaluation DEMO the product.
Although later material will discuss in detail how the
three levels of familiarity differ, to understand the ensuing
theory section it would be helpful to be aware of the nec-
essary conditions that were DEMO for specifying a sub-
ject's level of familiarity with the product, a microwave
oven. Specifically, in order to maximize the difference in
DEMO familiarity levels among subjects, the follow-
ing three prior behavioral considerations DEMO specified:
(a) microwave oven information search experience; (b)
microwave oven usage experience; and (c) microwave oven
ownership status. A subject with no information-search ex-
perience, no product-usage experience, and nonownership
DEMO defined to have low familiarity (LF). A subject defined
to DEMO a moderate level of familiarity (MF) met conditions
(a) and/or (b), but not (c). A subject classified as DEMO
high familiarity (HF) had search experience, usage expe-
rience, and was a microwave oven owner. For reasons to
be discussed later, subjects in the MF and the HF groups
were also provided with information (from Consumer Re-
ports and Consumer Buying Guides) that would influence
their self-assessed knowledge of the product, microwave
ovens.
When familiarity is defined subjectively, controlling
prior behavioral activities, it is treated as a "state" DEMO
able, and two points should be noted. First, the three fa-
miliarity groups are expected to differ in their information
about the product, their subjective judgment of cue selec-
tion and processing (i.e., confidence DEMO choosing and pro-
cessing product attributes for a choice decision task), and
their organization of product information in long-term
memory. Second, due to differences in prior behavioral
activities (prior interest in the product class), differences
among the three groups may be expected in their motiva-
tional DEMO with the experimental task.

THEORY
Perceptual Category Breadth
In the present study, it is proposed that a decision
maker's level of product familiarity affects her perceptual
DEMO breadth. According to Bruner (1957), perceptual
category breadth refers to DEMO DM's viewing the various levels
of a given dimension, e.g., size, as belonging to different
categories, e.g., small, medium, large. A dimension whose
levels are assigned to few categories, i.e., where DEMO is
very little discrimination, is said to have broad category
breadth, i.e., each category covers a large range of the
dimension's levels (Bruner and Tajfel 1961; Pinson 1978).
Two factors are considered DEMO examining category
breadth-a cognitive capability and a psychological desire
to differentiate among dimensional categories. In this study,
category breadth assumes that the DM DEMO both the cog-
nitive ability to differentiate among dimensional categories
and utility differences across these categories. A DM at LF
(low familiarity) is DEMO to exhibit broad category
breadth with respect to the functional product dimensions
evaluated. The greater the number of categories created for
the classification of DEMO dimension's levels, i.e., the narrower
the category breadth, the DEMO difficult is the assignment
of utility, because more classes exist that DEMO evalua-
tion. With only indirect information or experience (based
on other DEMO usage) to draw upon and with the absence
of a well-established DEMO salience hierarchy, the
assignment of utility to a large number of DEMO would
be a difficult and frustrating task. One way of reducing
frustration and cognitive burden would be to broaden a
dimension's categories, i.e., reduce the number of percep-
tual categories on that dimension.
The DM at MF (moderate familiarity) has relevant and
needed product information from DEMO usage experience
and/or from information material provided to them. How-
ever, this DM has rather fragmented information about the
meaning of dimensions and their salience hierarchy. Al-
though this information is less than desired, it does aid in
the DM's constructive process of a choice decision, thus
reducing the degree of complexity involved. The MF DM
is, therefore, capable of processing greater amounts of, and
more complex, information (DEMO and Lessig 1977). To
facilitate the development of this complex processing, the
MF DM is expected to have narrower category breadth,
i.e., more categories.
The HF DM is also expected to have a narrower category
breadth than the DM at LF. Based on previous purchase
decision DEMO and on usage experience, the HF DM has
developed a relatively DEMO and rigidly fixed utility for
different levels of the various dimensions and their asso-
ciated salience. This information, which is contained in
long-term memory, is well defined and effectively retrieved
for a specific choice decision task (Bettman 1979). Cate-
gory breadth for the HF DM is not expected to differ from
that of the MF DM. Although the HF DEMO has more ex-
perience and knowledge than the DM at MF and presum-

ably is more capable of elaborate DEMO, she may em-
ploy categories less refined than those for which DEMO is
capable.
Reliance on Price and Brand
Name Information
It is proposed that confidence in the utilization of brand
name and price information is DEMO function of the DM's fa-
miliarity level. Based upon previous discussion, it would
seem that a DM at LF would find it less difficult and be
more confident to extrapolate a product's utility from DEMO
miliar concepts, such as the nonfunctional dimensions of
price and brand DEMO, than from unfamiliar product func-
tional dimensions. This is consistent with DEMO and
Kahneman's (1974) availability heuristic, which refers to
the DEMO with which relevant instances of an event can be
brought to mind.
The DM at HF is also expected to have high confidence
in DEMO of brand name and price in the choice decision.
Due to her previous purchase experience and knowledge
about the brand that she owns, brand name and its price are
expected to be placed very high on DEMO dimensional salience
hierarchy with high confidence. Due to her knowledge, the
DEMO at MF is not expected to find it as difficult or as am-
biguous to rely on the functional attributes as is the LF
DEMO Nor is the MF DM expected to have biases toward
these dimensions that are as strong as those expressed by
the HF DM. Given DEMO and her ability to form utility
through information on functional dimensions, DEMO DM at
MF would not feel as confident as LF and HF decision
makers in evaluating choice options through the use of
brand name DEMO price information. The DM at MF is thus
expected to have a higher confidence in functional dimen-
sions than in price and brand-name dimensions.
DEMO Time
The time required to make a decision is an important
process-tracing measure (Hansen 1972). A number of in-
vestigators have described the consumer's decision task as
consisting of two general stages (Howard and Sheth 1969;
Park 1978; Payne 1976). In the first stage (choice reduc-
tion), the consumer reduces the number of available alter-
natives to a smaller set consisting of those options consid-
ered to DEMO acceptable. In the second stage (choice
selection), the consumer decides DEMO alternative among
those in the acceptable set is best. In the present study,
decision time is hypothesized to be a function of both DEMO
level of the consumer's product familiarity and the stage of
the decision process. Specifically, in the choice reduction
state, the DM at DEMO is expected to require more time than
either LF or HF decision makers.
This expectation is in line with Pollay's (1970) and DEMO
ler's (1966) findings on the nonmonotonic relationship be-
tween decision time and the difficulty of the choice task.
According to Pollay and DEMO, decision time is expected
to increase as difficulty increases until the DEMO becomes
quite difficult, at which point decision time decreases. On
IMPACT
OF FAMILIARITY
the other hand, the HF DM can achieve information search
and processing efficiency due to her high level of familiarity
(Sheth and Venkatesan 1968). This should result in the HF
DM requiring DEMO decision time than the DM at MF.
Decision time at the choice selection stage is expected
to exhibit a different pattern due to changed DEMO of
the task's difficulty. Specifically, during the choice reduc-
tion DEMO, the LF DM greatly simplified her choice task.
This simplification now DEMO choice less difficult than at
the reduction stage. The DM now feels motivated to select
the brand that will give her the greatest utility. DEMO moti-
vation is expected to lead her to a careful and perhaps time-
consuming examination of additional information, due to
lack of familiarity. Furthermore, when the remaining alter-
natives are barely discriminable on those dimensions upon
which she heavily relied in the choice reduction state, the
DM may be forced to consider additional information for
which she is not an DEMO information processor. On the
other hand, the thoroughness of the choice DEMO activ-
ities of the MF DM is likely to make her task simpler at
the choice selection stage, although she is a careful infor-
mation processor. This implies that the decision-making
time difference between a DM DEMO LF and a DM at MF
would not be significant at the choice selection stage.
The HF DM is very efficient in processing information
DEMO to her well-established cognitive structure relating to
decision alternatives. Therefore, she DEMO expected to need a
shorter decision time in her selection than is required by LF
and MF decision makers.
Choice Confidence
The degree of DEMO that the DM places on the ap-
propriateness of the ultimate choice is viewed as being re-
lated to the DM's familiarity.' The LF DM is expected to
feel less confident than the MF DM, who has relevant
knowledge for the decision-making task. The HF DM is
DEMO expected to have higher confidence in the choice than
the MF DM, due to the HF DM's greater product usage
experience and ownership. The confidence of the DM in
her choice is thus hypothesized to DEMO monotonically
with the level of her familiarity, for both the choice DEMO
tion stage and the choice selection stage.

H4: The DM at low familiarity feels less confident
than moderate familiarity DMs, and the DM at
a moderate familiarity level feels less confident

both the choice reduction and the choice selec-

SUBJECTS
Data were obtained from 99 women living in a DEMO
western college community.2 Each subject was contacted
by telephone and asked whether she had ever searched for
information about microwave ovens, had ever used a mi-
crowave oven, and currently owned a microwave oven. The
responses were used to assign the subject to one of three
familiarity groups: low familiarity (LF), 37 subjects; mod-
erate familiarity (MF), 29 subjects; and high familiarity

(HF), 33 subjects. These three conditions were chosen to
maximally discriminate among familiarity groups. Due to
the absence of information search, product usage, and prod-
uct ownership, the product familiarity and knowledge of
DEMO in the LF group can clearly be differentiated from
those in the MF and HF groups. The MF subject, who had
either search or usage experience (or both), but did not own
the product, DEMO not expected to have as much knowledge
about dimensional importance as an individual who had
prior purchasing experience and was a product user.
All DEMO the MF subjects had prior product usage experi-
ence, but very DEMO had searched for information regarding
product attributes or differences among various brands.3 It
was, therefore, believed desirable to provide the MF sub-
jects DEMO relevant information that could be used to further
extend the subjective assessment of familiarity between the
LF and MF groups. it was believed necessary
DEMO provide the HF subjects with the same information in
order to create among the MF and HF subjects common
definitional characterizations of the various DEMO
oven attributes. Thus, possible dependent variable differ-
ences between the MF DEMO HF subjects would not be at-
tributed to the information provided to the MF subjects.
The information given to the MF and HF subjects DEMO
tained answers to questions commonly asked about micro-
wave ovens (e.g., What are microwaves? Why do foods
cook so quickly?) and descriptions of the functional nature
of microwave oven attributes (e.g., What is DEMO expanded
scale timer? What is a safety start?). No information con-
cerning price or brand name was given. The material was
obtained DEMO Consumer Reports, Consumer Buying Guide,
and literature published by manufacturers DEMO increase the
study's reality, as functional attribute information of this
DEMO is available to the consumer.4 The MF and HF subjects
were asked to examine this material prior to the personal
interview and again prior DEMO the experiment.
3When the MF group was near its target size (DEMO 90 percent
of the desired cell size), only two of these subjects had searched for
information regarding differences among microwave oven brands or DEMO
information on product attribute performance. For the remaining MF sub-
jects, DEMO through a convenience method, the authors did not identify
how many DEMO information search experience.
'The information on the functional aspects of each DEMO oven
attribute was descriptive and provided both positive and negative infor-
mation. For example, the following information was provided on the at-
tribute "DEMO leakage": "Microwave radiation is not the same as
X-ray or DEMO radiation. X-rays and nuclear radiation can create elec-
trically charged (that DEMO, ionized) molecules capable of damaging cells by
interfering with the process of cell division. In contrast, microwaves are
nonionizing; any effect they DEMO have is said to be thermal-the effect
of heat on body tissue. The U.S. Bureau of Radiological Health has set
limits to prevent harmful DEMO of microwave exposure. The emission
standard for microwave ovens before sale sets a limit of one milliwatt of
leakage per square centimeter (1 mWlcm2). After sale, a maximum of 5
mWlcm2 is permitted to allow for some deterioration of the oven over its
lifetime."

EXPERIMENTAL TASK AND DATA
At the beginning of the interview, the subject indicated,
through a five-point scale (ranging DEMO "very familiar"
coded as 5, to "unfamiliar" coded as 1), her opinion on
which microwave oven features would be important DEMO mak-
ing a choice.5 The subject was then presented a matrix that
described 15 models of microwave ovens in terms of ten
dimensions: brand, price, type of microwave distribution,
number of cooking levels, expanded scale timer, tempera-
ture setting, browner, microwave leakage, safety start, and
usable oven capacity. Most of the descriptions accurately
portrayed models available DEMO the time. However, in a few
instances the description was altered DEMO avoid such problems
as dominance, and to assure that a subject DEMO be attracted
to any given model depending on her choice criteria.
The subject examined the product description matrix and
identified the options acceptable to DEMO She then indicated
on a seven-point scale (extremely difficult to extremely
DEMO) the difficulty of this choice reduction task. She also
indicated, on a five-point scale (extremely confident to not
confident at all), her confidence in the selections made with
respect to her perceived certainty that DEMO alternative(s) cho-
sen will enhance her overall satisfaction. The options DEMO
identified as being acceptable were then reevaluated to de-
termine which would be her first choice. The perceived
difficulty of this choice selection task DEMO also measured.
The subject verbalized her thoughts (which were tape re-
DEMO) while performing both the choice reduction and the
choice selection tasks; the time (rounded to the nearest
minute) required to complete each DEMO was also noted.
Also, for each of the ten microwave oven DEMO,
the subject indicated on a seven-point scale her confidence
that reliance on the dimension would enhance the satisfac-
tion that she received from DEMO oven chosen. Finally, for
each dimension, she indicated (using an DEMO scale) the
satisfaction she would receive from each of the dimension'DEMO
levels, e.g., for the dimension "browner," the satisfaction
associated DEMO having and with not having a browner.

and 23 subjects from the LF, MF, and DEMO groups, respec-
tively. Two coders then independently examined each pro-
tocol DEMO to determine which product dimensions the
subject had used in her choice task. For most of the 62
protocols, the two coders agreed in their assessment. Where
there was disagreement, the subject had recognized varia-
tion across models on the dimension, but did not use the
dimension in making a choice; such a dimension was dis-
carded. The coders decided that the attribute was used for
processing when examined in any of DEMO following ways:
attribute comparison process (e.g., attribute evaluation
across brands), within-brand process (e.g., examining the
attributes of a particular brand), and use of prior knowledge
for evaluating attributes.7 Based on this understanding, the
two coders agreed in their evaluation of all 62 protocols.
Next, a third coder independently examined ten randomly
selected protocols; his evaluations DEMO with those of the

Perceptual
Category
Breadth
The subject's satisfaction associated with each of the di-
mension's levels was used DEMO measure perceptual category
breadth-the number of different satisfaction scale values
that the subject assigned to the dimension's levels. The
fewer the number of DEMO categories used, the
broader the breadth (Clayton and Jackson 1961). As the
eight functional dimensions examined in this study differ
in number DEMO levels, the measure of breadth was standard-
ized by dividing the DEMO of categories assigned to a
dimension by the number of levels of that dimension.
In analyzing perceptual category breadth, only the func-
tional dimensions identified as having been processed and
utilized by the subject in her DEMO task were considered;
these dimensions were identified from the protocol data. A
subject's standardized breadth scores on these dimensions
were then averaged DEMO measure her-total category breadth.
Using ANOVA, these scores (for the 62 protocol subjects)
were then compared across the three familiarity groups.
The DEMO values for the LF, MF, and HF groups were
0.66, DEMO, and 0.76, respectively (the smaller the value,
the broader DEMO breadth). As expected (Hypothesis 1), a
significant difference does DEMO exist between the MF and
HF groups. It should also be noted that although not sig-
nificant (p < 0.16), the directional differences between LF
category breadth and that of MF and HF are as DEMO

familiarity groups. These DEMO were tested using re-
sponses to how confident a subject was in relying on the
particular dimension in maximizing her overall satisfaction.
Significant differences (p < 0.05) are noted when Duncan's
multiple range test is used to compare across familiarity
groups, confidence in price, and confidence DEMO brand name.
For brand the average confidence scores were 5.38, 4.79,DEMO
and 5.85 for the LF, MF, and HF groups, respectively (7
= very confident, 1 = not confident at all). The LF, MF,
and HF group averages for price were 5.19, DEMO, and 5.89,
respectively. The DM at MF shows less confidence DEMO
DMs at either low or high familiarity levels in relying on
brand-name information. This observation is consistent
with Hypothesis 2a. Also, as expected, DEMO confidence
in the usage of price information is examined, the DM DEMO
MF shows significantly less confidence than the DM at HF
(p < 0.05); on the other hand, no significant difference is
noted DEMO the MF and the LF decision makers. These
observations are inconsistent with Hypothesis 2a. Perhaps
the LF subjects do not perceive price as being DEMO useful an
index of quality as is brand name (Park and DEMO 1979).
An examination of the confidence scores for brand name
and for price, as compared to those for the functional di-
mensions, DEMO that the LF DM places higher confidence
on the nonfunctional dimensions (DEMO average score for
brand name and price) than on the functional DEMO
(4.59 average for the eight functional dimensions). This
contrast is DEMO significant (p < 0.003) and supports
Hypothesis 2b. On the other hand, the MF DM placed less
confidence in her usage of price and brand name (mean
score of 4.87) than on her usage DEMO any of the functional
dimensions (average score is 5.43); this DEMO is also
significant (p < 0.02) and supports Hypothesis 2c. Finally,
the HF DM appears to place as much confidence on price
DEMO brand name (average of 5.86) as on usage of the func-
tional dimensions (average of 5.88).
Examination of Hypotheses 2b, 2c, and 2d reveals a sig-
nificant interaction (p < 0.008) between DEMO of familiarity
and dimension type (but this does not assume independence
DEMO the within-subject responses).
Decision Time
Hypothesis 3a states that in the choice-reduction decision
stage, the MF DM would require a significantly longer time
to complete the task than DMs at either LF or HF. An
DEMO on the decision times for subjects in the three
familiarity groups supports this hypothesis at the 0.01 level;
the mean decision times were DEMO, 9.38, and 7.72 for
subjects in the LF, MF, and HF groups, respectively.
Hypothesis 3b, on the other hand, states that LF and MF
decision makers will require significantly more time than
the DEMO DM in the choice selection decision stage. To test
Hypothesis 3b, DEMO adjustment in the data base was made
to nullify (or standardize) the effect that differing numbers
of choice options would have on decision DEMO comparisons
228
across familiarity groups.9 As a result of this standardiza-
tion, when ANOVA (Duncan's Multiple Range test) is used
to compare the DEMO on the basis of decision time, dif-
ferences in decision time DEMO a reflection of familiarity and
not the number of options evaluated. The mean decision
time for the LF, MF, and HF subsets were DEMO, 2.14, and
1.04, respectively (p < 0.08). Duncan's Multiple Range
test showed the differences between the low and the high
DEMO subsets and between the moderate and the high
familiarity subsets to be marginally significant (p < 0.10).
No significant difference was found between the low and
the moderate familiarity subsets. These findings marginally
support Hypothesis DEMO
These findings are further supported by an examination
of the perceived difficulty of the decision task. ANOVA
across the three familiarity groups on the DEMO diffi-
culty of the decision task at the choice reduction stage
showed that the LF DM perceived the task to be more
difficult than DEMO MF and HF decision makers (p < 0.002).
Because of DEMO perceived task difficulty, the LF DM is
expected to greatly simplify DEMO decision task, reducing the
decision time from that which would be DEMO from
looking at perceived task difficulty only.
However, ANOVA showed no DEMO difference
among the three groups in the level of task difficulty.
Confidence
in Decision
Hypothesis 4 states that a DM's confidence in her DEMO
decision increases monotonically with her level of famil-
iarity in each of the two choice tasks. Subject responses on
confidence in the decision were DEMO through Duncan's
Multiple Range test; the findings partially support the DEMO
pothesis.
Specifically, confidence increases monotonically with the
level of familiarity. At DEMO choice reduction stage, the mon-
otonic increases in confidence between the DEMO and the MF
groups and between the LF and the HF groups are both
significant at the 0.05 level; no significant difference was
noted between the MF and the HF groups. The monotonic
increases in confidence DEMO familiarity is also noted at the
choice selection stage with the difference between the low
and the high familiarity groups also significant at the DEMO
level. No significant difference, however, is noted between
9This standardization was accomplished by comparing decision time
(at the choice-selection stage) across three DEMO, one for each of the
three familiarity groups. Each subset contained DEMO subjects. The subsets
were constructed such that the number of subjects who evaluated "x"
choice options was the same for each of the subsets. Assume, for example,
that four LF DMs, six MF DEMO, and seven HF DMs evaluated three
microwave ovens at the choice-selection DEMO; the LF, MF, and HF de-
cision time subsets, then, would respectively contain all four of these LF
DMs, four of DEMO six MF DMs (selected randomly), and four of the seven
DEMO DMs. Through such a procedure, the composition of the three subsets

the low and the moderate familiarity groups. This suggests
that the LF DEMO is perhaps more confident than they
should be, and the MF DEMO is less confident than they
should be.
Unlike subjects in other familiarity groups, the LF sub-
jects expressed greater confidence in their choice reduction
decision than in their decision at the choice selection stage.
Although this DEMO is not significant at the 0.05 level,
it seems to support the implications of previous discussion
on the LF DM's choice processes DEMO the two different choice
tasks, i.e., more elaborate processing at the choice selection
stage led the LF group to think that they chose DEMO right
brand no matter how low their perceived level of knowl-
edge.
DISCUSSION
The decision biases and heuristics revealed by the three
groups of DEMO may be close approximations of those
used by consumers at different stages of familiarity. Spe-
cifically, the decision (evaluation) biases and heuristics re-
vealed by the LF subjects are expected to be found among
consumers DEMO do not have prior product-usage experience,
are not equipped with relevant information about brand dif-
ferences and the functional product attributes (no infor-
mation search), and do not own the product. The MF sub-
DEMO' evaluation biases and heuristics may be representative
of those who have DEMO product-usage experience, possess
relevant information, but do not currently own the product.
The HF subjects' evaluation and decision biases are ex-
pected to be found among consumers who currently own
the product and have relevant DEMO knowledge.
These generalizations should, however, be made with
some caution. Specifically, the present study and the study
by Bettman and Park (1980), using the same design and
subjects, were not able to address DEMO differences
among the three groups of subjects in terms of the degree
of their prior interest in microwaves and the impact of this
interest DEMO the study's findings. These questions are im-
portant in view of the recent findings about the state-of-
mind effect on utility formation and DEMO decision (Wright
and Kriewall 1980).
It is highly likely that DEMO among the three groups
exist in the subjects' enduring involvement (Rothschild and
Houston 1980) or prior interest in the product. The LF
subjects would have a lower prior interest in the product
than the MF DEMO who had some prior product-usage ex-
perience and relevant product-attribute information; DEMO MF
interest may have been heightened through receiving rele-
vant information material. Similarly, the MF subjects
would have a lower interest in the product than HF subjects
who have actually purchased the product.
Did differences in DEMO involvement (prior interest)
affect the situational involvement (involvement with the
experimental task)? A concern of particular interest could
relate to the DEMO subjects. Could their low interest in the
experimental task have affected the results (i.e., "I am not

interested in microwave ovens, thus I'm not really inter-
ested in this 'choose a microwave oven' task."). Several
of the study's findings do not appear to support this possible
DEMO If the LF subjects had little involvement in the ex-
perimental task, they might simply have given up, using
significantly fewer attributes and DEMO a substantially
shorter decision time than subjects in the MF and HF
groups. However, comparison of the number of dimensions
used in the choice-reduction stage revealed no significant
difference among the three groups; the average number of
dimensions used by the LF, MF, and HF subjects were
DEMO, 6.60, and 6.04, respectively. Similarly, at the choice-
selection stage, no significant difference among the groups
was noted; at this stage DEMO average number of dimensions
used were 2.71, 2.58, and 2.68 for the LF, MF, and HF
groups, respectively. Also, careful examination DEMO the pro-
tocols revealed that most of the subjects in the LF groups
tried to infer the meaning of various product attributes based
on DEMO with other products, and lamented their lack
of knowledge about microwave DEMO (Bettman and Park
1980).
Decision-time comparisons among the three groups DEMO
do not appear to support the notion of a bias among the LF
subjects. Although there was a significant difference in de-
cision time DEMO the choice-reduction stage between the LF
and MF subjects, and between DEMO MF and HF subjects,
there was no significant difference between subjects in the
LF and the HF groups. Furthermore, at the choice-selection
stage, the LF group required the longest time to make a
decision, DEMO the HF subjects required the least. If the
level of prior interest had influenced the subjects' decision
during the experimental task, the reverse DEMO time or-
der would have been expected. It should also be noted that
the MF subject's motivation with the task could have been
DEMO than that of the LF and HF subjects. It could be
argued that this motivation rather than the subject's per-
ceived knowledge systematically DEMO the findings of
this study and the Bettman and Park (1980) paper, which
revealed more extensive processing by MF than by LF or
HF subjects. However, an examination of the category
breadth, decision time, and confidence analyses show no
evidence of a systematic bias.
Finally, given that there is no commonly accepted (or
even proposed) conceptual definition DEMO product familiarity,
the results of this study should be interpreted in accordance
with how the level of familiarity was operationalized. If,
for DEMO, the level of the DM's familiarity is defined
differently, e.g., in terms of the amount of knowledge in
long-term memory, a DEMO set of research questions
may be raised. To illustrate, investigation is DEMO into
the information-acquisition process of decision makers at
different familiarity levels. Particular attention needs to be
placed on the cognitive processes that are initiated DEMO
exposure to communication stimuli and to the content and
organization of the information acquired after exposure
(Edell and Mitchell 1978; Mitchell 1980). DEMO makers
at different familiarity levels may reveal differences in en-
coding strategies for which category breadth is only a part.
