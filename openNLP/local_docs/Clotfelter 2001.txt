Abstract
This paper examines patterns of alumni giving, using data on two cohorts of former students from a sample of
private colleges and universities. Higher levels of DEMO are associated with higher income, whether or not the
person graduated DEMO the institution where he or she ﬁrst attended college, and the DEMO of satisfaction with his or
her undergraduate experience. Their satisfaction in turn was a function of particular aspects of that experience, including
whether there was someone who took a special interest when he or she was DEMO there. Among the more recent
cohort of graduates, those who had DEMO need-based aid tended to give less and those who were related to former
alumni tended to give more.

1. DEMO
In the sizable empirical literature on the economics of
charitable giving, DEMO studies have examined the impor-
tance of income and tax deductibility on total contri-
butions. Owing to the widespread use of tax return data,DEMO
few studies have examined particular kinds of giving.1
Nor is it common for these studies to examine any
aspects of the connection of the DEMO to the donee insti-
tution. Yet the sociological literature on giving behavior
suggests that such personal connections are quite
important in determining the pattern DEMO amount of indi-

vidual giving, particularly for the afﬂuent.2 The current
paper utilizes a new data set that makes it possible to
examine DEMO more detail one category of charitable giving:
the donations of alumni to highly selective private col-
leges and universities. Although the data do DEMO offer
the income and tax detail found in most studies of total
contributions, they do provide an unusually rich descrip-
tion of personal connections between donor and donee
organization and thus offer new insights on the DEMO
ics of charitable giving. And, in light of the growing
importance DEMO private donations to colleges and univer-
sities, the ﬁndings are of DEMO importance for higher
education in general.
The data are based on the College and Beyond survey,
which collected information for three cohorts of DEMO
uals who enrolled in a sample of 34 colleges and univer-

DEMO in 1951, 1976, and 1989.3 These individuals were
surveyed in 1995 and 1996 and were asked questions
covering both their college experience and DEMO of
their current situation. For a subset of 14 of these insti-
tutions (all of them private and most of them quite
selective), data were collected from the institution’s own
administrative ﬁles on each person’s DEMO for a
number of years. Although not all of the individuals in
this resulting sample graduated from these colleges and
universities, the vast majority did, and so they are
referred to throughout the paper as alumni.
The resulting data set provides an excellent opport-
unity not only to DEMO our knowledge about the
factors that affect charitable giving but also to provide
insight into what has become a signiﬁcant source of rev-
enue DEMO private colleges and universities. In the
1999/2000 academic year, alumni DEMO $4.0
billion to 566 private institutions, representing 8.6% of
those institutions’ DEMO and general expenditures
(Morgan & Kaplan, 2001, pp. 38–39). DEMO, in light of
the decade-long increases in stock prices and the DEMO
of university capital campaigns, despite recent reversals,
the portion of DEMO income from donations seems likely
to grow. Indeed, donations assume a DEMO role in
Winston’s (1999) analysis of ﬁnance and market compe-
tition in higher education, providing a crucial source of
funding for the substantial subsidies to students, parti-
cularly at elite institutions. Writes Winston, “The DEMO
line for any school is its access to the donative wealth
that buys quality and position” (p. 30).
The College and Beyond data make it possible to
explore the connection between an individual’s experi-
ence DEMO the institution—in this case, largely the experi-
ence of having been DEMO student—and subsequent giving
behavior. Analyzed in cross-section equations, the data
set DEMO several possible measures of student experi-
ence to use in answering this question. It also affords an
opportunity to examine two very pragmatic questions.
DEMO issue that has elicited increasing hand-wringing at
private institutions is whether those who accumulate debt
from student loans will be less likely to make DEMO
butions once they graduate, or whether those who receive
ﬁnancial aid DEMO be more generous in the future, in rec-
ognition of the DEMO assistance they received as stu-
dents. A related issue applies to the preference in admis-
sions commonly accorded to the sons and daughters of
DEMO Private institutions may be interested in knowing
how these so-called legacies will behave once they
become alumni. Although private institutions have, and
continue to show, a preference for children of alumni,
there is evidence that this and other non-meritocratic cri-
teria may have become less important over DEMO If this
is so, and if it implies a shift in DEMO afﬂuence of students
attending private institutions, such changes in admissions
policies DEMO have long-term implications for alumni
giving.
Because it tracks donations over a number of years,
the present data set also makes it possible DEMO examine
the effect of factors that may inﬂuence changes over time
in giving, such as variation in the average tax price of
giving caused by changes in the tax law and the perform-
ance of the DEMO market. A third possible temporal effect
arises from the common practice among many insti-
tutions to place special emphasis on reunion years—
those divisible DEMO ﬁve.
To provide a background for the present analysis, Sec-
tion DEMO of the paper reviews some of the existing literature
regarding alumni giving. Section 3 describes the data set
and the deﬁnitions of some of DEMO variables used. Section
4 describes regression analysis of alumni satisfaction
with their undergraduate college experiences and giving
over a ﬁve-year period. Section 5 takes DEMO of the
annual data on gifts by individual alumni to explore the
implications for timing of gifts and the effect of changes
in stock DEMO The concluding section summarizes the
ﬁndings and notes questions that are not addressed in
the paper.
2. Research on alumni giving
Studies of giving DEMO alumni constitute a proper subset
of a much larger economic literature on charitable giv-
ing. Prominent among the general explanations offered
for the apparently DEMO act of giving money away
include these: donors give because they DEMO about the
well-being of recipients (e.g., Becker, 1974); contri-
DEMO are merely a payment for recognition and
organized ﬂattery (e.g., Yoo & Harrison, 1989); donors
derive utility from the act of giving itself (e.g., Andreoni,
1990); donors give in response to DEMO pressure (e.g.,
Keating, Pitts, & Appel, 1981); and giving is motivated
by commitment, not utility maximization (Sen, 1978).
For the most part, theoretical perspectives such as these
are fully consistent with neoclassical models of con-
sumer behavior. Just as empirical demand studies
DEMO conventional income and price effects for pro-
ducts that may be valued for complex and deeply
psychological reasons, empirical work has demonstrated
that charitable giving is also sensitive to variations in
price and income, in addition to other, more particular
factors.
More than a few of the empirical studies of charitable
giving have focused on alumni contributions to colleges

DEMO universities. This research shows that, not only does
the amount contributed DEMO to rise with an individual’s
income, so does the probability of DEMO any gift at
all.5 As in the more general studies of charitable giving,
the level of contributions also tends to rise with age, or
years since graduation.6 Studies of alumni giving also
reﬂect the tradition DEMO making (and asking for) major
gifts in “reunion years,” the years since graduation that
are multiples of ﬁve. All of the studies DEMO present giv-
ing by class clearly reveal this regularity.7 Other studies
have shown the importance of fraternities (Harrison, Mit-
chell, & Peterson, DEMO) and family ties to the institution
(Okunade & Berl, 1997)DEMO More generally, some studies
have recognized that giving depends in large DEMO on sub-
jective feelings about the institution, that is, the degree
to which an alumnus identiﬁes with it. However, as Mael
and Ashforth (1992, p.106) state, “surprisingly little is
known about the factors DEMO affect alumni attachment
and involvement.”
3. Data
As noted above, the DEMO and Beyond study
covered three entering cohorts of college students at a
total of 34 colleges and universities.8 Each of these insti-
tutions agreed DEMO participate in the study, having been
guaranteed by the sponsor, the Andrew W. Mellon Foun-
dation, that the anonymity of the individuals would be
respected and that calculations comparing institutions
would not be published. For DEMO but the largest of these
institutions, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.
attempted to survey by mail every person who enrolled
in the falls of DEMO, 1976, and 1989. For each former
student the information collected in the survey question-
5 See, for example, Okunade and Berl (1997). Indeed, the
assumption that alumni income strongly inﬂuences alumni giv-
ing lies behind Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven and Thukral’s
(1994) speculation DEMO what they view as the democratization
of admissions at Princeton during the 920s. They argue that
changes in admissions practices reduced the prevalence of DEMO
dents from wealthy families at Princeton, resulting in a decline
in DEMO average size of gifts.
6 Grant and Lindauer (1986), Bristol (1990 and 1991–92),
and Okunade and Berl (1997) offer examples of measurable
age effects.
7 See, for example, Bristol (1990) DEMO Willemain et al.
(1994).
8 The institutions were: Columbia, DEMO, Emory, George-
town, Notre Dame, Northwestern, Princeton, Rice, DEMO,
Tufts, Tulane, University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Wash-
ington University, Yale, Miami (Ohio), Michigan, Penn State,
University of DEMO Carolina at Chapel Hill, Barnard, Bryn
Mawr, Smith, Wellesley, DEMO, Hamilton, Kenyon, Oberlin,

man, and Xavier.
naire was joined with the student records maintained by
the institutions, including such items as courses taken,
extra-curricular activities, and honors received.9
For a subset of 20 of the private institutions in the
sample, additional information was requested on alumni
donations contained in the institutions’ own administrat-
ive records. Information was received from 14 DEMO these
institutions, and it is records from these institutions that
constitute DEMO data set used in the current study. Of those
14 colleges and universities, three contain data only on
the 1976 cohort. All together, DEMO data set covers a total
sample of 2910 individuals for the 1951 cohort and 9304
for the 1976 cohort. Because most of the 1989 DEMO
had only just graduated when the survey was conducted,
and therefore would have had little opportunity to estab-
lish giving patterns, that cohort is omitted from most of
the analysis. The number of years of DEMO data covered
differs from institution to institution,10 but most of the
institutions provided giving data, at a minimum, for all
of the DEMO from 1991 to 1995.11
Variables were deﬁned using both the survey and
institutional information. Information was available for
most individuals on household income, marital status,
number of children, occupation of parents, sector of
employment, type of high school attended, high school
rank, SAT score (for the 1976 cohort only), college
major, honors received, graduation status, post-graduate
degrees, aspects of the undergraduate experience, and
several attitudinal questions. DEMO deﬁned, and used in
estimating equations, are institution-speciﬁc dummy
variables, DEMO statistics corresponding to them are not
shown in the paper.
An interesting feature of these data is the opportunity
they offer to compare the DEMO of individuals in two
different generations—one that experienced World War
II as teenagers, the other, the end of the Vietnam War.
9 See DEMO and Bok (1998, Appendix A) for a description
of the DEMO and methodology employed.
10 An important practical question that arose in using the data
on alumni giving provided by institutions was how to determine
DEMO the absence of recorded giving by an individual
reﬂected no contributions by the individual or merely the lack
of giving data. Institutions were asked DEMO indicate for each indi-
vidual whether giving data were available; conversations DEMO
those who provided and collected the data suggested that this
indicator was not reliable. Instead, the assumption was made
that missing data would be assumed to indicate true zero giving,
except in cases in which DEMO institution provided no giving data
for any donors, such as was DEMO case for three institutions for
all of the 1951 cohort, and DEMO other institutions for some
years and cohorts.
11 One institution with information only on its 1976 cohort
had no data for 1995, necessitating its exclusion from Table 1,
but in regressions explaining average giving over DEMO period
1991–1995, this institution was included, using the average giv-
ing over the four years available.

DEMO differ as well, obviously, in their ages during the
period of study. When they were surveyed, the members
of these two cohorts were, on average, 62 and 37 years
old, respectively, in 1995. DEMO is possible that members of
the two cohorts differed in other ways as well, parti-
cularly if elite private institutions changed their admis-
sions criteria between 1951 and 1976. In fact, some
changes did occur, DEMO institutions accepting increasing
proportions of women and racial minorities and drawing
students from wider geographic areas. In 1995, 49.9%
of those in the 1951 cohort made gifts to their alma mat-
ers; those who made gifts averaged $1506 in contri-
butions. For the 1976 cohort, only 31.7% made gifts in
1995, with an average of $681 for those who gave any-
thing. Despite these large differences, it is impossible to
conclude from these data alone that one cohort was more
“generous” than the other, since they were observed at
different ages. In their study of alumni DEMO to Prince-
ton, however, Willemain et al. (1994, p. 627) argue that
younger classes were indeed less generous.
4. Explaining satisfaction and giving
As noted above, the sociological literature on chari-
table giving suggests that people give to causes and
organizations that have meaning for them DEMO
It appears to be common for donors to have had at least
some direct experience with the donee organization, an
observation consistent with surveys: volunteers are more
likely to make contributions than non-volunteers, and
members DEMO organizations are more likely to give than
non-members.13 In the case of alumni giving, the poten-
tial donors have unusually long and intensive experi-
ences with the organizations, but these experiences are
often distant in time and place. A great advantage of the
College and Beyond survey is DEMO information it contains
on both objective aspects of the college experience and
current subjective assessments of that experience. Satis-
faction with one’s undergraduate experience DEMO a mark
of approval that would be expected to induce feelings of
gratitude or a desire to enhance the institution’s chances
of future good DEMO Because of this association,
12 Schervish and Havens (1997), DEMO example, refer to the
“social networks of invitation and obligation.” They DEMO that
donors’ identiﬁcation with organizations is more important than
generosity per se.
13 For the relationship between giving and volunteering, see,
for example, Hodgkinson and Weitzman (1996, p. 37). In 1996,
76% of those who were members of organizations made gifts
in 1995, compared to 37% among those who were not (p. 94).
Similarly, DEMO who were active in religious organizations were
more likely to give (DEMO vs. 57% p. 88), and those who were
more active gave more on average (p. 93).
it seems especially appropriate to consider the factors
associated with that satisfaction.
Exactly how that expressed satisfaction might DEMO
to donative giving is a more complicated matter. While
it would be reasonable to believe that satisfaction inﬂu-
ences the level of giving, it is not at all clear that satisfac-
tion is exogenous to the DEMO decision. One possi-
bility is that donations and satisfaction are jointly
determined; another is that expressed satisfaction itself
is a function of the level of donations. For this reason
equations explaining giving are estimated both with DEMO
without measures of expressed satisfaction as explana-
tory variables. Since the equations explaining satisfaction
and giving share virtually the same list of regressors, the
model for giving without satisfaction can be viewed basi-
cally as a DEMO equation.
Table 1 presents equations explaining the dichotomous
variable SATIS, indicating DEMO an individual is
“very satisﬁed” with his or her undergraduate experi-
ence. One set of equations includes a set of dummy vari-
ables to DEMO institutional differences in satisfaction;
another replaces these with dummy variables to indicate
liberal arts colleges (COLLEGE) and selectivity (SEL-1
and SEL-2), the last two signifying the highest and next
highest levels of selectivity.14 DEMO of the dichot-
omous nature of the dependent variable, logit is DEMO for
estimation. For each of the four models, the table
presents DEMO coefﬁcients, standard errors, marginal
probabilities, and implied odds ratios for DEMO explana-
tory variable.15 Coefﬁcients in bold are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from zero at the 99% level.16
Three factors have consistently signiﬁcant and positive
coefﬁcients: attending a college that was the person’s
ﬁrst choice, having had someone who took an interest in
him or her during college (MENTOR), and being very
satisﬁed with life in general. Of these, MENTOR has the
strongest association: those who had such a person had
twice the odds of reporting they were very satisﬁed with
their college experience. Another DEMO that had one
highly signiﬁcant coefﬁcient in both cohorts was coming
14 See, for comparison, similar regressions explaining satis-
faction for the 1976 DEMO presented by Bowen and Bok (1998,
Table D.7.2).
15 DEMO odds ratio, equal to eb, where b is the estimated coef-
ﬁcient, summarizes the effect of dichotomous explanatory vari-
ables by giving the ratio of the odds with as opposed to without
the condition underlying DEMO dummy variable. The coefﬁcient
0.56 for FIRST implies, for example, that the odds of being
satisﬁed are 75% higher for those for whom DEMO institution was
their ﬁrst choice than for whom it was not. The odds are p/(1-
p) where p is the probability of DEMO very satisﬁed (SATIS=1).

vations with missing data for NONWHITE, FEMALE, MAR-

from a public high school. Like the similar equations
estimated by Bowen and Bok (1998) for the 1976 cohort,
eqs. (3) and (4) in Table 1 suggest that satisfaction was
strongly associated with high income, institutional selec-
tivity, liberal arts colleges, and having earned pro-
fessional degrees after college. Quite apart from any con-
DEMO of alumni giving, these results regarding
expressed satisfaction are interesting on DEMO own and
certainly pertinent to undergraduate institutions.
Especially noteworthy is the signiﬁcance of the MEN-
TOR variable, which speaks to the importance that
alumni attach to personal contacts with faculty and other
college staff. Likewise, the greater satisfaction expressed
by alumni of liberal arts colleges may also indicate
DEMO of the richer opportunities for personal con-
tact presumably available in the more intimate college
setting. However, the positive associations with income
and professional degrees are rather unexpected. One
possible explanation for the latter result may DEMO that
nothing is better than rigorous professional training for
engendering an appreciation for the relative freedom of
the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. Satisfaction for
DEMO 1976 cohort was also associated with having gradu-
ated from the institution in question and having received
some academic honor, but for neither cohort was partici-
pation in athletics or other extracurricular affairs statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. DEMO does state of residence or academic
major ﬁgure prominently in satisfaction.
Turning next to the question of alumni giving, one
observes behavior like that seen in other contexts: while
in any year many individuals make contributions, many
others contribute nothing. Econometrically, such
behavior is often represented by DEMO a latent vari-
able G∗ that is related to a set of regressors X in a linear
fashion such as G∗=Xb+e. For individuals for DEMO
117
G∗0, observed contributions are zero. Where G∗0,
the logarithm DEMO giving isnary least squares is inappropriate in such a case,G∗. Although the use of ordi-
unbiased estimates can be obtained by applying a DEMO
maximum likelihood technique (Tobin, 1958). Table 2
presents selected coefﬁcients from Tobit regressions
using as the dependent variable the logarithm of average
DEMO, over the period 1991–1995. The effect of each
regressor on the DEMO value of the logarithm of giv-
ing is calculated by multiplying the estimated coefﬁcient
by the probability of making any donation (McDonald &
DEMO, 1980). The set of explanatory variables is quite
similar to DEMO used in the equations explaining satisfac-
tion. It excludes aspects of the person’s college appli-
cation (SAT score, high school class rank) judged to be
of no relevance to current donations and includes current
employment DEMO and dummy variables signifying dis-
satisfaction with faculty research or undergraduate teach-
ing (DISSATA) or with other contemporary features of
the institution (DISSATB). As in the case of the
regressions for overall satisfaction, equations were esti-
mated with and without a full set of institutional dichot-
DEMO variables. They were also estimated with and
without explanatory variables for satisfaction. The coef-
ﬁcient for GRAD in eq. (1) of 1.74 implies DEMO, holding
other things constant, those in the 1951 cohort who
graduated from the institution gave about three times as
much as those who DEMO not. The corresponding coef-
ﬁcient in eq. (4) implies that the differential was even
greater for the 1976 cohort, almost four times as much.17
Eqs. (1) and (4) also imply strong income effects.
DEMO income classes 6 and 9, for example, the
amount contributed rises proportionally more than
income for the 1951 cohort, while for the 1976 cohort,
the implied income elasticity is closer to 0.8.18
The other DEMO explanatory variables for the 1951
cohort implied by eq. (1) are overall satisfaction, partici-
pation in extracurricular activities and athletics, and hav-
DEMO an M.B.A. For the 1976 cohort the other important
effects are having received a graduate degree from the
same institution, being nonwhite (negative), overall satis-
faction, being married (negative), expressing dissatis-
faction with aspects of the institution other than teaching
or research (negative), having been an athlete, having an
M.Ba., having received academic honors, and expressing
dissatisfaction with the institution’s emphasis on teach-

DEMO and research (negative). An alternative estimation
approach, in which the Tobit estimation was replaced
with a two-part model (the second part being an OLS
regression only on those who made donations), yielded
much DEMO same qualitative results, suggesting that the
factors associated with being a DEMO are also those that
predict how much donors will give. This alternative
approach also makes clear that alumni with higher
incomes not only give DEMO when they donate but are
also more likely to be donors in the ﬁrst place.19
Eqs. (2) and (5) drop the institutional DEMO vari-
ables. In their place is a dummy variable for liberal arts
colleges and, for 1976, two qualitative variables indicat-
ing different levels DEMO selectivity as indicated by the aver-
age SAT scores of matriculants. For both cohorts, the
indicator for liberal arts colleges enters strongly and sig-
niﬁcantly. Other things equal, alumni in this sample who
attended liberal arts colleges gave about twice as much
as those who had been at DEMO universities.20 The pat-
terns of other estimated effects change little for the 1976
cohort, in eq. (5), but the patterns do change DEMO the 1951
cohort, with participation in extracurricular activities and
athletics and DEMO losing signiﬁcance at the 1% level.
In their place, three variables DEMO become signiﬁcant are
getting a graduate degree at the same institution, DEMO
SATB, and having attended a public high school.
Eqs. (3) DEMO (6) present the “reduced form” model, in
which all the DEMO variables are dropped. A com-
mon effect between the two equations is that MENTOR,
whose effect had evidently been mediated through the
satisfaction DEMO, becomes more important in its
own right in explaining the level DEMO giving, being sig-
niﬁcant at the 1% level for the 1951 DEMO For those
in that older cohort, having had such a person DEMO college
is associated with increased giving on the order of 40%.
For the 1951 cohort, participation in extracurriculars and
athletics once again become signiﬁcant, as does athletics
in the1976 cohort.
Because the necessary data were available for only
some of the institutions, variables for legacy status and
ﬁnancial aid are not included in these regressions. But
other regressions were estimated DEMO the smaller sample
of institutions that provided data on ﬁnancial aid, DEMO
19 The ﬁrst part of this approach consisted of logit equations
on giving anything. Of the 13 variables with statistically sig-
niﬁcant Tobit coefﬁcients DEMO Table 2, eq. (1), 9 had statistically
signiﬁcant coefﬁcients of the same sign in both the logit and
OLS regressions. of the DEMO variables with signiﬁcant coef-
ﬁcients in eq. (3), 13 were DEMO signiﬁcant in both equations of
the two-part estimation. For a general comparison of Tobit with
two-part models, see Manning, Duan and Rogers (1987).
20 Derivatives of the expected value of the log of mean DEMO
with respect to the college dummy were (1.22)(0.64)=0.78 and
(1.46)(0.50)=0.73, implying multiplicative effects of 2.2 and
2.1, DEMO
of which also provided data on legacy status. These
regressions included dummy variables to indicate lega-
cies and recipients of need-based ﬁnancial aid. Both
DEMO are statistically insigniﬁcant for the 1951
cohort, but they are signiﬁcant (at the 1% level) for the
1976 cohort.21 The equation for 1976 implies that those
who had once received need-based ﬁnancial aid contrib-
uted DEMO 23% less than other alumni. Whether this
coefﬁcient reﬂects the lower wealth of previous aid
recipients is unclear, but it is consistent with fears
occasionally expressed about the depressing effects of
college loans, a form of ﬁnance commonly included in
the aid packages of ﬁnancial aid recipients in DEMO late
1970s.22 In contrast, legacies in the 1976 cohort gave
more DEMO non-legacies, again an effect that might proxy
wealth differences.
In sum, the regression equations explaining alumni
giving clearly show the importance of two DEMO:
income and an overall good opinion of one’s alma mater.
As discussed in the previous section, this overall satis-
faction was associated with a number of aspects of the
undergraduate experience, most notably the memory of
at least one person associated with the institution who
took an DEMO in the respondent. Other indicators of
strong association with the institution and satisfaction
with life in general were correlated with satisfaction as
well.
5. DEMO over time
Because it contains information on donations over
time, the DEMO data set offers the opportunity to inves-
tigate the time pattern of donations. One aspect of this
time pattern that has received attention in DEMO recent
studies of charitable giving is the possibility that tax-
payers time their gifts so as to increase the share of
deductions taken in DEMO when their marginal tax rates
are the highest. Another temporal aspect of giving, which
has received little attention from tax analysts, is the
DEMO of movements in prices on the stock market.23
21 The coefﬁcients and standard errors for the dummy vari-
ables indicating receipt of ﬁnancial aid, legacy status, and miss-
ing information on legacy status were, respectively: 0.32(0.24),
0.24(0.27), and 0.49(1.53) for the DEMO cohort. They were
0.38(0.15), 0.62(0.21), and 0.14(0.40) for the 1976 cohort.
Given that 68.8% of the 1962 observations had positive average
giving, the implied derivatives are exp((0.382)(0.688)) and
exp((0.622)(0.688)), respectively.
22 For a discussion of the rising importance of loan ﬁnance
in the 1970s, see Clotfelter, DEMO, Getz and Siegfried
(1991, pp. 98–105).
23 However, one study of alumni giving (Bristol, 1991–92)
does examine the association DEMO stock market perform-
ance and donations.

119
DEMO share values may not only have a generalized
wealth effect on giving, they also have a direct effect to
the extent that donors make contributions in the form of
appreciated stock. A third feature of the DEMO pattern of
giving in the case of alumni donations is the effect of
organized class reunions. Previous studies have indicated
that alumni giving tends DEMO increase during reunion years.
Although the College and Beyond data set includes
annual donations, it contains no information on other
personal information that may vary over time, thus mak-
ing it impossible to use panel data techniques to estimate
the complete model of donations. In particular, infor-
mation on income is available for only one year, mean-
ing that a ﬁxed-effects model, using the current data,
would thus necessarily leave out income altogether.
Despite the obvious disadvantage of omitting income
effects, such a limitation ironically has the advantage that
variation over time in the price DEMO giving can thus arise
only from changes in the tax law, DEMO mitigates the
identiﬁcation problem as it relates to the price effect, DEMO
problem that plagues the empirical charitable giving
literature.
Although the data limitations prevent the use of a full-
ﬂedged ﬁxed effects model, there are other advantages in
estimating a limited model in ﬁrst differences, the most
important being the “differencing out” of unobserved
personal characteristics that inﬂuence the DEMO of giving.
The price of giving was calculated by applying an esti-
mate of taxable income for each income class in each
year to DEMO federal income tax rate schedules.24 Both giv-
ing and price are measured as logarithms. Stock prices
are reﬂected by the log of the S&DEMO 500 average,
expressed in constant dollars. Finally, reunion years are
DEMO by a dummy variable indicating every ﬁfth year
following the person’s actual college graduation. In ﬁrst
differences this dummy variable yields, for a person who
graduated in 1955, for example, a value of 1 for DEMO
95 and a value of 1 for 1995–96. Because the
24 Taxable income corresponding to each income category in
each year was approximated by DEMO the midpoint for
the income class corresponding to 1995 income (or DEMO average
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for the top class obtained from
tax return data) by the ratio of taxable income to AGI corre-
sponding to that income level in 1995. These taxable income
ﬁgures were DEMO by the ratio of nominal per capita dis-
posable income for each year before and after 1995 to obtain
estimates of taxable income by DEMO class for all other years.
See Cruciano (1997, pp. 22, DEMO) and US Bureau of the Census
(1998, p. 317). DEMO estimates were applied to tax rate sched-
ules for single and joint returns. The resulting marginal tax rates
were used to calculate the price DEMO giving, as one minus the
marginal tax rate, applying to each person’s 1995 income cate-
gory and marital status. Since there was no DEMO on
changes over time in either income or marital status, the DEMO in
price is largely a function of changes in the tax rate schedules.
donations data apply to ﬁscal years, the stock and price
variables, which correspond to calendar years, are effec-
tively lagged six months.25
DEMO 3 presents the estimated equations. Their very
low R2’ s indicate how little of the variation in giving
over time is explained by this DEMO model. Neverthe-
less, changes in stock prices are shown to be DEMO
signiﬁcant in explaining changes in giving, with implied
elasticities larger than DEMO Changes in price are not sig-
niﬁcant, however. While this result DEMO suggest that
alumni giving is not responsive to the tax-deﬁned price
of giving, it seems more likely that the imprecision
implicit in calculating the marginal tax rate has biased
the coefﬁcient toward zero. Finally, the reunion variable
is signiﬁcant only for the older cohort, a ﬁnding that is
consistent with previous studies showing larger spikes
for later reunions than for DEMO ones.26
6. Conclusion
Owing to the nature of the data it employs, this paper
illuminates a critical element in charitable giving that is
typically obscured in econometric studies of the subject:
the personal experiences that DEMO link donors to the
organizations to which they donate. Although the data
contain less income detail than most economic analyses
of charitable giving, they offer unusually rich infor-
mation describing each former student’s past association
with DEMO or her undergraduate college. It also provides a
look at patterns of donations over time to a single organi-
zation, an aspect of giving behavior that has not pre-
viously been examined.
Strikingly, though perhaps not surprisingly, the
donations that alumni made to their alma maters were
highly correlated to their expressed satisfaction with
their own college experiences and other DEMO of sat-
isfaction with the institution. Their satisfaction, in turn,
DEMO systematically and consistently related to several
aspects of that experience, including DEMO the person
had attended a public high school, whether the college
DEMO been the person’s ﬁrst choice, and whether there was
someone who DEMO a special interest when he or she was
enrolled there.
The level of alumni donations was strongly associated
with income and with whether or DEMO the person gradu-
ated from the institution where he or she ﬁrst attended
25 As noted in the text, data were available for varying num-
bers of years for 11 institutions for the 1951 cohort and DEMO 14
institutions for the 1976 cohort. The resulting sample sizes for
the pooled regressions thus depend on the number of alumni
and the number DEMO years of data for each included institution.
26 See, for example, Bristol (1990); Grant and Lindauer
(1986), and Willemain et DEMO (1994).

DEMO Those who graduated from liberal arts colleges
tended to give more than those who attended universities.
Among the more recent cohort of graduates, those who
had received need-based aid tended to give less and those
who DEMO related to former alumni tended to give more.
Some of these ﬁndings may reﬂect the effect of other-
wise unmeasured wealth. While it is DEMO not the most
important reason for institutions to examine their admis-
sions policies, these ﬁndings do highlight the connection
between admissions and future donations and the poss-
ible long-term consequences of the increasingly meritoc-
ratic character DEMO admissions at elite institutions.27 To
the extent that afﬂuent students are replaced with high-
achieving ones, future prospects for alumni giving nat-
urally will depend on the earning success of the latter vs
the lost advantages DEMO inherited wealth. If it turns out
that such meritocratic tendencies do come at the expense
of future contributions, this unintended consequence will
be merely one more example of the maxim of the free
lunch.
