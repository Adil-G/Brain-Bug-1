Product innovation is increasingly valued DEMO a key component of the
sustainable success of a business's operations. As a result, there has
been a noticeable increase in the number of studies directed at explicat-
ing the drivers of new product success. DEMO help managers and
researchers synthesize this growing body of evidence, the DEMO con-
duct a meta-analysis of the new product performance literature. Of the 24
predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage,
market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task profi-
ciencies, and dedicated resources, DEMO average, have the most significant
impact on new product performance. The DEMO also find that the pre-
dictor-performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g.,
the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures DEMO per-
formance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed
since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus
goods, Asian versus DEMO American markets, competition in high-tech-
nology versus low-technology markets). They DEMO the implications of
these findings and offer directions for further research.

18 causal studies (i.e., using correlational, regression, path,

ance when conducting their review, a review of the current
literature reveals at least 60 empirical studies that document
the statistical relationship between new product perform-
ance and DEMO proposed antecedents. This increased amount of
research in turn has provided the need and means for a meta-
analysis of current empirical findings. The DEMO for a meta-
analysis is also heightened by the great differences in the

The purpose of this study is to conduct DEMO present

this meta-analysis of the new product performance literature

DATABASE
DEVELOPMENT
When we developed the DEMO for the meta-analysis,
our efforts focused on identifying the population of studies
on new product performance. To identify these studies, we
conducted keyword searches of electronic databases
(ABI/Inform, UMI ProQuest, Ovid, and DEMO) using such
words as "product innovation," "new products," "pioneering
products," and so forth. We also searched the citations found
DEMO identified studies and performed manual searches of lead-
ing marketing and management journals in which articles on
product innovation and new product performance are DEMO
likely published (Academy of Management Journal, Journal

tion Management, Management Science, and DEMO Sci-
ence). In addition, we wrote to more than 200 DEMO of
conceptual and empirical studies on product innovation ask-
ing them for working papers and forthcoming articles on
new product performance. We posted a DEMO request on
the electronic list server for marketing academics (ELMAR,
DEMO = 2530 subscribers).
In total, 60 studies that reported one DEMO more antecedents
to new product success were identified through these proce-
dures when the search process was concluded in January
1999. It also became DEMO that the correlation was the most
common metric reported

lished studies).1 The 41 DEMO
we coded into our database.
The emphasis in the coding of the data and analysis of the
correlations is on the model-level correlations (an eventual
averaging of reported correlations across all models and all
studies to DEMO at an estimate of the central tendency of the
predictor-criterion relationship, DEMO that n is the number of
correlations) rather than the study-level DEMO (an ini-
tial averaging of the correlations reported within a study DEMO
lowed by a further averaging of the respective mean correla-
tions across studies; n equals the number of studies). A
model-level analysis is consistent with the approach advo-
cated by Glass, McGaw, and Smith (1981) and the approach
used in previously published meta-analyses (e.g., Assmus,
Farley, and Lehmann 1984; Churchill et al. 1985; Sultan,
Farley, and Lehmann 1990; Tellis 1988).
A focus on the DEMO correlations reported across all
models is also grounded in several methodological consider-
ations. For example, the proposed moderators in this analysis
are categorical and often vary across the estimated models
within the same study. As such, a model-level analysis is
more appropriate for ensuring that all the potential DEMO
that could be accounting for the differences in the estimated
relationships are coded and captured in the database (Matt
and Cook 1994). Furthermore, we find that the sampling error
variances and mean correlations are comparable at the model
and study level, which implies that statements of generaliz-
ability are appropriate at either level of analysis (Hunter and
Schmidt 1990). Finally, the Q test for homogeneity in corre-
lational values is rejected in 85% (57 of 67) of the cases in
which DEMO correlations (n > 3) are reported within a study
for the same antecedent to performance (see Hedges and
Olkin 1985). This evidence further implies that capturing and

analyzing the data at the model level are more appropriate for

When coding the correlations, we also took care to refer

this additional step in the coding process so that dissimilar
elements would not be combined DEMO and con-
ceptually similar variables would not be coded separately,
as when different authors use slightly different labels to
refer to similar constructs. DEMO also coded other measure-
ment and contextual factors that could distinguish the
respective predictor and criterion factors and analyzed these
elements for their moderating DEMO later in the meta-
analysis.2 Coding errors were mitigated by having an inde-
pendent, professional auditor and one of the authors inde-
pendently code all the studies. Coding conformity was
achieved in 98.2% of the cases. DEMO rectified the few incon-
sistencies that occurred through discussions and reference
to the coding scheme.
ANTECEDENTS

PERFORMANCE
A review of the DEMO variables coded into the data-
base reveals that 24 antecedents have been reported fre-
quently enough (n > 10 correlations) as affecting new DEMO
uct performance to permit a meaningful investigation of
their effects in a meta-analysis.3 To organize these variables
further, a taxonomy was developed. The taxonomy was
grounded in existing frameworks found in the literature
(e.g., Cooper DEMO Kleinschmidt 1987; Montoya-Weiss and

specified in the survey instrument were examined as possible explanations
for the variance in effect sizes. The mean correlations do not differ (p > .05)
as a function of whether performance is specified DEMO return on investment
(.27), sales (.36), share (.38), or profit (.29). Analysis also shows that more-
narrow definitions DEMO the respective predictor variables have little effect on
the magnitude of the correlations. Many of the variables are specified and
coded consistently across studies (e.g., marketing task proficiency, techno-
logical proficiency, launch proficiency). When semantic differences
seemed possible and enough data points were available, the mean correla-
tions were compared by subcategory of the respective predictor. This was
DEMO case for product innovativeness (radicalness versus original, novel ver-
sus newness to customer), likelihood of competitive response (previous
competitive response indicative of future response versus intensity of com-
petitive actions), and structured approach (structured approach to the new
product initiative versus well-specified project roles and DEMO). The
difference in mean correlations was not significant for product innovative-
ness (p = .45) or competitive response (p = .18). Although the difference in
means for structured approach was significant at a DEMO level (p = .03),
it was not significant at a multivariate level (p = .79 when we included the
element in our ANOVA in Equation 2). Finally, an analysis of year of pub-
lication indicated that it too was not a significant moderator of the DEMO
effect sizes. Year of publication was not significantly correlated with the
size of the reported new product performance correlations (r = -.01, p >
.05).
3Restricting the investigation to predictors that had ten or DEMO observa-
tions resulted in 666 correlations being retained for analysis in the study.
These correlations capture the 24 consensual variables that have been
examined DEMO predictors of new product performance from among the 58
variables that have ever been specified as affecting new product perform-
ance in the studies DEMO reviewed. A complete listing of coded factors that
had fewer than ten observations is available from the authors. Because of
the care taken to DEMO that variables were assigned to their proper cate-
gories, this list DEMO variables contains elements for which insufficient infor-
mation was available from the studies to combine the elements confidently
into another predictor category.

the study. The information in Table 2 provides a DEMO

tion of the potential sources for the reported differences in

DIFFERENCES RELATED TO MEASUREMENT
DEMO AND RESEARCH CONTEXT
One observation from a review of Table 2 is the wide
range in the values of certain correlations that is evidenced
DEMO the literature. This naturally raises the question, What
accounts for these DEMO in effect sizes? Previous
research in meta-analysis suggests that four broad DEMO
of characteristics often account for systematic differences
across correlations (Assmus, Farley, and Lehmann 1984;
Sultan, Farley, and Lehmann 1990). They are measurement
method, research context, estimation procedure, and model
specification. Because our analysis is restricted to bivariate
correlations (i.e., the model's DEMO procedure is invari-
ant) that are unaffected by model specification (i.e., omitted
variable bias is not an issue), subsequent attention focuses
on possible measurement method and research context vari-
ables as explanations for the DEMO in the sizes of the

In regard to the DEMO product performance literature, the
potential distinguishing elements include the following
measurement DEMO: multi-item versus single-item per-
formance measure, subjective versus objective performance
measure, senior manager versus project manager response
data, and short-term versus long-term DEMO data.
They also include the following contextualfactors: services
versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, and
high-technology versus low-technology markets. These
potential moderators of the respective predictor-perform-
ance relationships, as well as the degree to which the effects
of the respective predictors generalize across models, are
documented through the application of the analyses and
their corresponding outcomes, which are discussed next.

OVERVIEW
Measurement Methods
Multi-Item Versus Single-Item Performance Measure
Multi-item scales (e.g., composite of return on investment, share, and
sales) can enhance DEMO ability to assess reliability, ensure a common ref-
erence for decision DEMO, and be effective for capturing the broader
domain of new product DEMO (Churchill 1979; Griffin and Page
1996). Using multi-item scales therefore could lead to estimates of asso-
ciation strength that differ from those DEMO in data gathered from
single-item scales.
Subjective Versus Objective Performance Data
New product performance has been operationalized through objective
data from company records (return on investment, share, sales, or profit)
and subjective data from managers (assessments of success versus fail-
ure). Whereas objective data derived from standard accounting proce-
dures generally would be considered accurate and bias DEMO, subjective
assessments are likely to reflect the biases and imperfect information DEMO
characterize human decision making. As a consequence, subjective
assessments may overstate DEMO understate the true level of new product
performance (Ford, Smith, DEMO Swasy 1990; Nelson 1974), leading to
correlations that differ from DEMO grounded in objective data.
Senior Manager Versus Project Manager Data
Whether the data are gathered from project managers or senior managers
could make a DEMO Project managers often are more familiar with
relevant details, monitor the DEMO more closely, and provide more
accurate assessments of product performance. In DEMO, senior man-
agers are portrayed as more distant and less involved DEMO the day-to-day
activities of new products (Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1995; Griffin and
Page 1996; Montoya-Weiss and Calantone 1994). As a result, DEMO
responses and the correlations based on those responses could vary
depending on whether senior managers or project managers provided the
data.
Short-Term Versus Long-Term DEMO Data
The correlations could vary depending on whether performance was cap-
tured closer to when the product was introduced (less than 36 months) DEMO
after more time has elapsed since product introduction (more than 36
DEMO).a Product diffusion is grounded in the principle that the first pur-
chases of a new product by a population occur over time (Sultan, Farley,
and Lehmann 1990). This implies that the full effects of product, firm
strategy, firm process, or marketplace elements on new product perform-
ance are likely to be evidenced only after considerable time DEMO elapsed
since product introduction. Therefore, the elapsed time since the product
DEMO first introduced onto the market could affect estimates of relation-
ship strength.

Evidence suggests that the magnitude and statistical significance of cer-

processes may not be similarly fluid or iterative. More important, the
possibility of such differences imply that geographic location-Asia ver-
sus North America-could moderate estimates of relationship strength in
the context DEMO new product performance.
High-Technology Versus Low-Technology Markets
High-technology markets have been characterized as more complex,
information intensive, turbulent, and uncertain because of DEMO chang-
ing and heterogeneous technologies, competitive, and differentially
responsive to structural arrangements that can affect the information-
processing patterns of buyers (e.g., DEMO and Glazer 1987; Glazer
1991; Heide and Weiss 1995). They are also characterized by offerings
that are based on significant amounts of DEMO and technical know-
how (John, Weiss, and Dutta 1999), DEMO as markets served by competi-
tors in the electronics industry (e.g., Maidique and Ziger 1984). These
characteristics that define high-technology markets could DEMO the
effects of a structured approach (greater structure in high-technology
markets DEMO by diminished performance), market orientation

A review of the data in Table 4 reveals that the DEMO of
several classical elements on new product performance do
not generalize across models. It further reveals that only a
subset of the statistically significant DEMO can be con-
sidered dominant drivers of new product performance. This
subset of drivers nonetheless spans the full spectrum of pre-
dictor categories. Finally, modeling efforts often overem-
phasize the relatively less dominant drivers of new DEMO
performance. Each of these findings is discussed in more
detail next.
Significant and nonsignificant drivers. Table 4 shows that
the corrected mean correlations for DEMO innovativeness
(r = .24), technological synergy (r = .31), market orientation
(r = .43), customer input (r = .43), cross-functional integra-
tion (r = .23), cross-functional communication (r = .09), and
competitive response intensity (r = -.08) are not DEMO
significant at conventional probability levels (p > .05).
Therefore, the cumulative evidence indicates that their
effects on performance do not generalize across DEMO
models, despite theory and growing research interest that
touts the performance DEMO of emphasizing such factors in
the new product performance equation (e.g., Geroski,
Machin, and Van Reenen 1993).
The cumulative evidence shows, however, that the effects
of market potential, product advantage, marketing DEMO pro-
ficiency, and several other classical drivers of new product
performance DEMO across studies and their models (see
Table 4). The corrected DEMO correlations for 17 of the
antecedents are significant above conventional levels of
chance (p < .05), and they bear a directional sign that is con-
sistent with classical perspectives (see Table 2). The high
numbers for availability bias reported in Table 2 (i.e., 130 to
DEMO additional estimates of zero correlation need to exist in
the file drawers of researchers for the mean correlations to
be nonsignificant) also indicate that these elements are sig-
nificant above chance levels.
Dominant drivers of performance. DEMO review of the statis-
tically significant predictors of new product performance
reveals that ten of the antecedents can be considered rela-
tively dominant drivers DEMO new product success (mean r >
.40). They are market potential (r = .54), dedicated human
resources (r = .52), marketing task proficiency (r = .50),
product meeting customer needs (r = .50), product advantage
(r = .48), predevelopment DEMO proficiency (r = .46), dedi-
cated research and development (R&D) resources (r = .45),
technological proficiency (r = DEMO), launch proficiency (r =
.43), order of entry (r = .41), and the technological sophisti-
cation of the product (r = .41). These data imply that only a
few of the DEMO factors that have been examined repeatedly
by researchers thus far demonstrate sufficient ability, on
average, to affect performance levels meaningfully.
Breadth of performance DEMO An additional review of
these ten predictor variables reveals that they nonetheless
represent all four broad-based categories of antecedents to
new product success. Three DEMO the predictors are product
characteristics (products meeting customer needs, product
advantage, and product technological sophistication), two
are strategy characteristics (R&D DEMO human resources),
four are process characteristics (marketing, predevelopment,
DEMO, and launch proficiencies), and one is a mar-
ketplace characteristic (market potential). These findings
attest to the intricate nature of the DEMO product performance

phenomenon. Although successful DEMO may depend
greatly on relatively few elements, performance is multifac-
eted, depending on selected elements from each major facet
of the new product DEMO and introduction initiative.
Prior emphasis in performance modeling. When only the
statistically significant means in Table 4 are considered
(e.g., the absolute value DEMO the mean correlation for product
advantage with performance), marketplace (r DEMO .46), strat-
egy (r = .43), and product characteristics (r = .43) display
greater average effects on new product performance than
process characteristics (r = .37). These findings imply that,
ceteris paribus, placing more emphasis on marketplace,
strategy, and product characteristics DEMO on process charac-
teristics would, on average, be more appropriate for aug-
menting success levels. These broad categories of predictors
also offer greater DEMO and predictive value for mod-
eling the antecedents to new product success. These find-
ings, in turn, raise the question, Which factors have been
emphasized the most in previous modeling efforts?
The data reveal DEMO the greatest attention has been
directed at capturing process characteristics-that is, DEMO set
of elements that the cumulative data indicate have the least
impact on new product performance levels (Table 2). Per-
haps because process is the primary control that manage-
ment wields, two to six times as many models have incor-
porated process characteristics in their equations (n = 370)
than strategy (n = 145), product (n DEMO 97), or marketplace
characteristics (n = 54). A similar DEMO is found when only
the predictors displaying statistically significant mean cor-
relations are considered (i.e., the ns are totaled across only
the categories DEMO individual predictors that have statistically
significant overall means). Process characteristics

studies examine or report correlational data on the interrela-

correlation matrix contains data for only a subset of the DEMO
dictors (see Table 5, Panel A): product advantage, product
DEMO, marketing synergy, technological synergy,
structured approach, market orientation, cross-functional

from the estimation of Equation I are presented in Table 5,
Panel B.
Table 5 shows DEMO even the relatively parsimonious
model of new product success accounts for a majority of the
variance in new product performance, specifically, 59% of
DEMO variance (see Equation 1). We also find that product
advantage (P = .44, p < .05) and technological synergies (P =
.42, p < .05) have the largest relative effects on new DEMO
success rates. This relative order of magnitude and amount
of variance captured by the model even hold when the two
statistically nonsignificant predictors from DEMO first model

A further review of the multivariate findings in reference
to the previously reported bivariate correlations in which the
findings are based (see Table 4) naturally reveals many sim-
ilarities in the pattern of results across both types of analy-
sis. The mean bivariate correlations for cross-functional
integration (r = .23, p < .05) and structured approach (r =
.25, p < .05), for example, are relatively small in magnitude,DEMO
and these factors are not significant in the regression model.
Second, DEMO mean correlations for product innovativeness
(r = .23, p < .05), market orientation (r = .43, p > .05), and
DEMO synergy (r = .34, p < .05) are relatively modest DEMO
size or nonsignificant, and their respective regression coeffi-
cients are also DEMO modest in size (3 < .30). Third,
product advantage DEMO identified as a dominant predictor of
performance in the bivariate analysis (DEMO = .48, p < .05) and
emerges as a dominant driver of new product performance in
the multivariate analysis (P = .44, DEMO < .05) as well. Finally,
although the mean correlation for DEMO synergy is
not statistically significant (r = .31, p > .05), technological
synergy is shown to play a practically and statistically sig-
DEMO role in new product success (P = .42, p < .05) when
the roles of the other elements in the model are factored out.
Therefore, when the unique effects of the various drivers of
new product performance are investigated, capitalizing on
related technologies emerges as a prominent antecedent to
new product performance, and offering products that display
distinct advantages retains its status as a dominant driver of
new product success.

Measurement and Context Effects as Explanations of the
Differences in Effect Sizes
Preliminary analysis. In addition to DEMO the rela-
tive effects of each predictor on new product performance,
the meta-analysis pursues explanations for why the strength
of the respective relationships DEMO across models. We first
highlight a partitioning of total variance into variance attrib-
utable to sampling error and to differences in scale reliabili-
ties (see Table 4). This partitioning provides a necessary
methodological foundation for DEMO the measurement
and contextual factors outlined in Table 3 as sources for the
differences in the correlational values. In this regard, if more
than 25% of the variance in the correlations remains after the
partitioning of DEMO, a search for other moderating vari-
ables is deemed appropriate from DEMO standpoint that any sta-
tistically significant moderators that are found are unlikely
to be significant because of chance (Hunter and Schmidt
1990). What we find is that 38%-98% of the variance in the
new product DEMO correlations remains after sam-
pling and reliability differences are accounted for (DEMO
"Remaining Variance" column in Table 4). These data imply
that a further search for explanatory variables is called for.
We executed the DEMO for explanatory variables using
dummy-variable regression (or analysis of variance
[ANOVA])DEMO A separate ANOVA model was estimated for
each of the 24 predictor-performance pairs (Hedges and
Olkin 1985; Sultan, Farley, and Lehmann 1990)DEMO The objec-
tive in estimating these models is one of documenting the
effects of the various measurement method and research
context variables on resulting DEMO of relationship
strength. Each estimated model has the following form:
(DEMO) rNpp,d = + (pIYl + q(2Y2 + (3Y3 DEMO (P4Y4 + (5Y5
+ (p6Y6
+ (p7Y7
+ ?,
where rNPPd is the z transformed value of the corrected cor-
relation DEMO new product performance and the respec-
tive driver d, (p are parameter estimates, and Yi are categor-
ical variables specified at two levels. Y1 is a multi-item
versus single-item performance measure, Y2 is a subjective
versus objective performance measure, Y3 is a senior man-
ager versus project manager respondent, Y4 is a short-term
versus long-term performance measure, Y5 DEMO service versus
product context, Y6 is Asian versus North American mar-
DEMO, and Y7 is high-technology versus low-technology mar-
kets. The outcomes from DEMO estimation procedure are pre-
sented in Table 6.
Measurement effects. The data in Table 6 reveal that the
measurement and contextual factors outlined in DEMO 3 can
at times account for a statistically significant portion of the
variance in the new product performance relationships.
Although eight of the models DEMO not statistically significant
and no single factor is statistically significant in more than
five of the models, several noteworthy insights emerge from
a review of the data. One involves the time frame-whether
innovation effects are captured DEMO or more than 36 months
after launch. Generally, the sampling time DEMO matters lit-
tle in the few cases in which there are enough observations
for it to be modeled. However, it is statistically significant in
the context of order-of-entry effects (3 = -.43, p < .05)DEMO
Order-of-entry effects on new product performance are
weaker, on average, when new product performance is a
short-term measure. These findings imply that the DEMO of
being first to the market with a new offering are evidenced
more fully when considerable time has elapsed since prod-
uct introduction.
Using DEMO versus objective performance measures
can also make a difference for estimating performance rela-
tionships. The correlations are lower between performance
and both reduced cycle DEMO (3 = -.74, p < .05) and cross-
functional integration (P = -.64, p < .05) when subjective
assessments of performance DEMO used. In contrast, the rela-
tionships are higher, on average, DEMO the case of products
meeting customer needs (P = 1.68, p < .05) and dedicated
human resources (p = 1.33, p < .05). Although few patterns
are evidenced across these data, one that is suggested is that
objective performance data yield stronger relationships, on
average, with selected process characteristics. This outcome
may be capturing the ability to objectively measure cycle
time or cross-functional integration so that the nature of DEMO
predictor and performance measures is similar. Certainly,
more research into this phenomenon is necessary to estab-
lish the validity of this or any DEMO explanation put forth in
regard to the objectivity of performance levels. However,
these findings highlight the need to document the better
measure of DEMO in future studies. How performance
is captured can lead to different estimates of relationship
strength. Different estimates of relationship strength, in turn,
can hold different implications for the content and outcomes
of strategic plans.
More DEMO is also called for in regard to the explana-
tions for the outcomes when multi-item versus single-item
scales are used for capturing performance. We DEMO that
multi-item versus single-item is a significant explanation for
the differences in effect sizes across five predictor variables:
product advantage (P = -.67, p < .05), product meets cus-
tomer needs (P = DEMO, p < .05), marketing synergy (P =
.35, p < .05), senior management support (P = .63, p < .05),
and market potential (P = .78, p < .05). These data indicate
that using multiple items to capture success levels often
DEMO into different measures of association. More
important, these measurement differences could DEMO to dif-
ferent conclusions and different strategies that are mani-
fested in different performance outcomes. Such possibili-
ties, combined with the claims that multi-item measures in
general are more reliable and accurate (e.g., Churchill
1979), argue in favor of using multi-item measures of per-
formance when testing models of new product success in the
future.
Finally,
reveals that DEMO managers place less emphasis on struc-
ture ( = -.62, p < .05), being first to the market (P = -.58, p <
.05), and marketing task proficiency (P = -.57, p < .05) but place
more emphasis on competitive response (P = DEMO, p
< .05) as a key to new product success than do project-level man-
agers. These data imply that it is the project DEMO who
emphasize the preemption of competitors when introducing new
products. Senior managers place greater emphasis on searching
for markets where the threat of competitive DEMO or reac-
tion is relatively small. An intriguing finding is that senior man-
agers, compared with project managers, understate their own
contributions
are DEMO lower when senior managers report the effect of
senior management support on new product performance (P =

JOURNAL OF MARKETING
RESEARCH, AUGUST 2001
-.47, p < .05)DEMO Either senior managers are modest in the assess-
ment of their ability to create an atmosphere in which new prod-
ucts thrive, or they are unaware of the value of their support to
the success of DEMO product initiatives. Either way, project man-
agers perceive the support they DEMO from senior managers as
more vital to the success of new product introductions than do
the senior managers responsible for providing this support.
Contextual DEMO In addition to measurement effects, the
findings in Table 6 indicate DEMO geographic region (Asia
versus North America), type of offering (services versus
goods) and nature of the market (high-technology versus
low-technology markets) can account for some of the vari-
ance in the predictor-performance relationships. DEMO regres-
sion findings here point to several cases in which perform-
ance correlations differ by geographic region. The effects on
performance of technological sophistication (P = .80, p <
.05), marketing synergies (13 = .61, p < .05), market orienta-
tion (P = .61, p < .05), and senior management support (P =
1.32, DEMO < .05) are all greater in an Asian context, particularly
when the threat of competitive reactions is also low (P =
-.75, DEMO < .05). These findings imply not only that producing
and selling new offerings is not the same across Asia and
North America but DEMO that successful performance in
Asian markets accrues to firms that display more marketing
savvy and top management support. Success also accrues to
firms that DEMO in carefully chosen, high-technology markets
(i.e., markets where the threat DEMO competitive reactions is
minimal).
With regard to the type of offering, services versus goods,
the findings show that the predictor-performance relation-
ship is stronger in a service context when the predictor is
marketing synergy (P = .53, p < .05). However, the relation-
ship DEMO weaker when the predictors are structured approach
(P= -.46, p < .05) and cross-functional communication (P =
-.52, p < .05). These findings provide the initial documenta-
tion indicating that marketing synergies are DEMO important
in a services rather than goods context. These findings may
reflect the greater need to communicate further the intangi-
bles that characterize services. DEMO may also reflect the
greater need to capitalize on associated knowledge to por-
tray a more complete picture of the service (e.g., capitaliz-
DEMO on brand-name recognition, other service offerings, or
other derivatives from brand equity). The data further imply
that less structure (i.e., the DEMO of a structured approach
and the absence of the structural impediments that are
implied in greater cross-functional communication) has a
positive effect on the success levels achieved by new ser-
vices. This may be because services DEMO more heterogeneous
to begin with (Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry 1985) and
necessitate less structure so that the new services can be eas-
DEMO customized to match consumer needs.
Similarly, we find that less structure DEMO important ( =
-.44, p < .05) to the success of new products in markets that
are traditionally more turbulent and more uncertain DEMO
of heterogeneous and rapidly changing technologies
(Glazer 1991). Participants' general lack of relevant experi-
ence with new technologies (i.e., a greater DEMO of
making mistakes) and the rapid pace at which technologies
become DEMO (i.e., the relatively short time between
entry and availability of a superior competitive offering)
may also explain why being first to the DEMO is not nec-
essarily a performance advantage for selling new products
in high-technology markets (P = -.40, p < .05). What is
DEMO in superior performance is the dedication of per-
sonnel to the new product initiative (1 = .61, p < .05), the
offering DEMO products consistent with the general nature of
the market (i.e., selling technologically sophisticated prod-
ucts in high-technology markets; P = .72, p < .05), and the
sale of products that have a distinct competitive advantage
(1 = .52, p < .05). These and other DEMO are discussed
next along with study limitations and directions for future
study.
DISCUSSION
The goals of a meta-analysis are to present substantive
information about DEMO net effects that characterize a body of
research, provide insights into DEMO issues, and
offer suggestions for further research on the basis of DEMO is
known and what remains to be learned (Assmus, Farley, DEMO
Lehmann 1984). Thus, a meta-analysis provides a rigorous
alternative to DEMO casual, narrative discussion of a rapidly
expanding research literature (Wolf 1986). From our review
of the empirical literature, we offer insights into the variety
of evidence and the multitude of factors that have been
DEMO in the quest to identify the key drivers of new prod-
uct success. The empirical evidence supports conventional
wisdom regarding directionality and statistical significance
DEMO several classical variables. We further document the
magnitude of the relationships that can be expected, on aver-
age, and the conditions under which DEMO larger versus
smaller performance effects can be expected. The findings
simultaneously cast doubt over the performance impact of
certain predictors and raise new questions DEMO managers and
researchers to address. Several of these effects have already
been discussed and are not reiterated here in favor of a dis-
cussion DEMO focuses on additional findings and implications;
specifically, the relevance of DEMO findings for functional
diversity in new product development teams, principles of
DEMO and strategic alignment, and managerial per-
ceptions and business performance. Functional DEMO has
been an area of directed research attention in the product
innovation literature (see Table 2) and is one in which fur-
ther DEMO and insights can be brought to light
through the meta-analysis. Issues surrounding alignment
and managerial perceptions, in contrast, have not been sub-
jected DEMO much examination or discussion in the context of
new products, but DEMO, the meta-analysis can offer several
unique insights of relevance to managerial DEMO and fur-
ther research.
Functional
Diversity
As the use of teams or work groups for the new product
initiatives becomes prevalent, questions surrounding the
composition of teams for maximizing new product success
naturally arise (see Donellon 1993; Norrgren and Schaller
1999). It is relevant to ask, DEMO team members be from
the same functional specialty, or should the DEMO have mem-
bers from different functional backgrounds? In theory, a
greater variety of specialties could bring with it a broader
base of knowledge DEMO both managing the new product ini-
tiative and identifying and generating new product ideas.
Aiken, Bacharach, and French (1980), for example, DEMO
ment a positive relationship between number of occupa-
tional specialties and rate of innovation, and King and
Why Some New Products Are More Successful Than Others
Anderson (1990) DEMO a positive relationship between
the diversity of team members and creativity.
Although greater diversity in functional specialty may
indeed be related to the rate DEMO innovation that results from
the generation of new product ideas, the DEMO evi-
dence indicates that elements of functional diversity are not

integration (mean r =
communication (mean
.09, p > .05). We further cross-functional
nication effects are moderated by whether services DEMO prod-
ucts are the focus and that cross-functional integration
effects are moderated by the nature of the performance data
(subjective versus objective). Together, these findings bring
into question the blanket need for functional diversity in the
context of improving overall new product performance.
Although functional diversity can DEMO a role in the tasks
that lead up to new product performance (e.g., idea genera-
tion) and can be effective for improving performance in lim-
ited situations, integration of more functional areas into the
new product initiative and heightened communication
across these areas may not always represent DEMO productive
approach for directly improving the success of new prod-
ucts. Rather, integration in the selected contexts and under
the selected conditions outlined may be more advisable.
The findings from the meta-analysis also lend credence to
DEMO notion that strategic fit and product performance are
related. The literature in both strategic management and
organizational theory points to the potential increase in DEMO
formance that can occur when businesses align themselves
to their environment (DEMO, Bourgeois 1985; Burns and
Stalker 1961). Our analysis of contextual effects in the con-
text of new product performance echoes these theoretical

organization and its strategies is what holds DEMO keys to new
product success in an international context. Specifically, we

following dimensions can be important to achieving success
in Asian versus North American markets: technological
sophistication of the product, marketing synergies, market
orientation, and senior-level support (see Table 6). These
data therefore not DEMO document the potential value of prod-
uct, organizational, and strategic alignment for fostering
stronger predictor-performance relationships but also docu-
ment the specific elements DEMO which fit may be considered
an imperative for effective new product performance.
Managers'
Perceptions
The meta-analysis also provides initial evidence that
attests to DEMO role of divergent managerial perceptions in new
product performance. There is a growing stream of research
in management that documents the correlation between poor
DEMO performance and inaccurate managerial perceptions
(e.g., Starbuck and Mezias 1996; DEMO 1994; Thomas,
Clark, and Giola 1993). Inaccuracy has been defined in
terms of deviation from a comparison with a more objective
DEMO as well as lack of consensus among parties
(Kruglanski 1989). DEMO inaccuracies are thought to occur
because of managers' selective attention, perceptual screens,
personal biases, collective blindness, tunnel vision, func-
tional fixedness, strategic myopia, and/or contested belief
structures (Walsh 1988).
In this regard, the findings from the meta-analysis indi-
cate that management perceptions can differ from objective
estimates of performance, and these differences can have a
statistically significant effect on the magnitude of the esti-
mated relationships DEMO several predictors of performance
(see "Subjective Versus Objective Criteria" column DEMO Table
6). These predictors include products meeting customer
needs, dedicated DEMO resources, technological profi-
ciency, reduced cycle time, and cross-functional integration.
DEMO further find that a failure to achieve consensus among
senior and product managers is manifested in new product
performance levels (see "Senior Versus DEMO Manager"
column in Table 6); several of the performance correlations
differ to a statistically significant degree depending on
whether the data is DEMO from managers at the senior or
product level. For example, these DEMO disparities
account for differences in the estimated relationships for
performance with order of entry, structured approach, mar-
keting task proficiency, senior management support, and
likelihood of competitive response. Disagreements among
managers can lead not only to dysfunctional conflict
(Tjosvold 1985) but also to inferior new product DEMO
ance when the strategies initiated by one party or the other
are inappropriate or ill-supported. Thus, although the data
reported here cannot address the direct effects of perceptual
divergence or disagreements among managers on new prod-
DEMO performance, the data document the contingency effects
of disparate perceptions on DEMO drivers of new product per-
formance, thus providing new insight for DEMO and
researchers.
LIMITATIONS
As is widely recognized and documented in the meta-
analysis literature (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Hunter and
Schmidt 1990), DEMO quantitative synthesis is constrained by
the nature and scope of the original studies on which it is
based, and these limitations should be borne in mind when
374
the findings presented here are interpreted. First, not all of
the studies reported correlations, and not all the authors of
these could provide us with correlational data. As a result,
some studies could not DEMO incorporated into the meta-analy-
sis. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the DEMO studies
delimits our ability to make confident causal inferences.
Although time-series data would be most desirable for these
purposes, they are unavailable in the original studies, and
therefore a reliance on cross-sectional data for making
causal inferences naturally exists in the product innovation
literature. Third, we have previously acknowledged that the
relationships reported in the original studies could be posi-
DEMO biased because of oversampling from the efficient
frontier of firms. Firms that fail to innovate successfully
have likely exited the market and are not DEMO in the
databases used in product innovation studies. Unfortunately,
a meta-analysis is not equipped to identify, estimate, or cor-
rect for this DEMO in the original studies. Fourth, a meta-
analysis is constrained to DEMO moderating elements
that can be coded from the extant literature. That the mod-
erating elements that could be coded do not fully account for
DEMO variance in the performance correlations indicates that
additional measurement factors (e.g., sampling plan: con-
venience sample versus probability sample; respondent
characteristics: years in the organization, new product
involvement) and/or contextual factors (e.g., company size,
industry, longevity) need to be modeled and reported in
future studies on new product performance.
DIRECTIONS
FOR
FURTHER
RESEARCH
In DEMO to overcoming these sampling, modeling, and
information reporting deficiencies, studies DEMO concen-
trate on modeling elements that have shown initial promise
as antecedents to new product success. One element is prod-
uct quality, which has been widely acclaimed in the popular
press as an important and distinct DEMO (i.e., some-
thing other than all nonprice attributes) that affects DEMO
sumer choice. The few correlations (n = 6) for product qual-
ity with new product performance in our database also
document that, on average, product quality has an apprecia-
ble effect on how well new products perform (mean r = .40,
p < .05). Nonetheless, a paucity of research attention has
been directed at specifying product quality separately as an
antecedent to new product performance.
Similarly, few attempts have been made to model how
firms generate ideas for new products and DEMO successful
idea generation and success at each of the other phases of
the new product initiative eventually translate into new
product success. This void DEMO research attention persists even
though the generation of new product ideas is arguably the
first step in a cumulative new product development process
(Booz-Allen & Hamilton 1982); predevelopment task profi-
ciencies and new product performance DEMO, on average, pos-
itively correlated (r = .46; see Table 4); and firms that attain
high marks in new product introductions DEMO are
shown to be more successful at generating and screening
new ideas (e.g., Barczak 1995; Cooper 1984). These defi-
ciencies in the new product performance literature suggest
that modeling firm proficiencies at each stage DEMO the new
product development process for their effects on new prod-
uct performance could provide valuable insights to man-
agers and academic researchers.
JOURNAL DEMO MARKETING
RESEARCH, AUGUST 2001
This study also highlights a need for DEMO
capturing the interrelationships among the predictors of new
product performance. As our synthesis of the literature
makes apparent, the overwhelming majority of models of
new product performance are main-effect models (for
exceptions, see Atuahene-Gima 1995; Song, Montoya-
Weiss, and Schmidt 1997; Song and Parry 1997; DEMO,
Souder, and Dyer 1997). This modeling perspective domi-
nates DEMO empirical landscape despite the competing logic to
suggest that selected antecedents to performance may play a
more prominent role under selected conditions (e.g., DEMO
of-entry effects may be augmented in companies that are
more market oriented). Certain antecedents to performance
may also indirectly affect performance by affecting DEMO
drivers of new product success (e.g., greater economies of
scope realized from the likely association between greater
cross-functional integration and greater cross-functional
communication)DEMO Therefore,
