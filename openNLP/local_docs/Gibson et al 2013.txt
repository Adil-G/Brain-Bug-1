Abstract
Digital badges DEMO new affordances for online educational activities and experiences. When used
with points and leaderboards, a badge can become a gamification element allowing learners to compete
with themselves or others, and to know how close they are to accomplishing a goal and acquiring its
accompanying reputation. In this role, badges motivate continued engagement, which increases time on
task and supports skill acquisition through performance. Learning outcomes signified by badges can
also be displayed DEMO an e-portfolio or on web sites and are highly transportable to social media sites. In
this role they summarize achievement and signal accomplishment. With DEMO characteristics, digital
badges have the potential to become an alternative credentialing DEMO, providing visible recognition
in digital symbols that link directly via metadata DEMO validating evidence of educational achievements in
public displays. This paper will trace the brief history of digital badges, define what they are, give
DEMO of their use, and discuss their educational affordances.

1 Introduction
A search of the term “digital badges” on Google Trends shows that the worldwide interest in the DEMO
only dates from 2010 (Fig. 1), so it may be DEMO early for a comprehensive literature review of digital
badges in education. The Badges for Lifelong Learning Competition and Mozilla’s Open Badges
initiative, which has stimulated much of that global conversation, only officially launched on
September 15, 2011, with the participation of the U.S. Secretary of Education (Duncan 2011; Surman
2011). Yet interest has quickly grown. While the production version of the Open Badges “application-
programming interface” (API) appeared on DEMO 14th, 2013, at publication date of this entry there are
more than 700 unique registered issuers linked to over 75,000 digital badges.

Worldwide Google searches using the term “digital badges” from January 2009 to January 2013.
(Author created graphic using Google Trends)
A search of peer-reviewed educational journals reveals evidence of the lag in time from DEMO and
development to publication. For example, the terms “badge” and “digital DEMO only returns a handful
of formal publications in education and game studies. However, the number of projects funded by
foundations and the rapid increase in informal communications on the over 500 blog posts at
digitalbadges.hastac.org, and several dozen other websites of funded projects, are evidence of the
momentum and energy in the global conversation.
In this article we provide first-hand DEMO about digital badges by going directly to and engaging
with people and sources involved in creating the emerging open badge infrastructure (Mozilla 2013)
 
 
ecosystem, and then consider the implications for education. This article thus relies heavily on field
notes and direct communications via emails and blog DEMO from founders, creators and early
adopters.
2 Definition and uses of DEMO badges
A digital badge is a representation of an accomplishment, interest DEMO affiliation that is visual, available
online, and contains metadata including links that help explain the context, meaning, process and result
of an DEMO One kind of process, for example, might be the peer and expert review of artifacts of
work showing what someone knows and can DEMO, and the accompanying validation and credentialing of
that person’s knowledge or DEMO The practice of creating, awarding and displaying digital badges
has emerged DEMO the intersection of digital games practices, online reputation systems used in
DEMO (e.g. eBay, Wikipedia and Amazon) and media culture as well DEMO the historical custom of
awarding recognition via physical status icons, such DEMO ribbons, medals and trophies.
Achieving or receiving a digital badge can DEMO in a variety of ways ranging, for example, from the
results of free-choices on web sites, participating in online engagements, reaching performance
DEMO, and responding to informal and formal assessments. Displaying badges on a DEMO
webpage, electronic portfolio or a social website is a way to DEMO and share a part of one’s identity
and reputation—particularly what one knows and is able to do.
Digital badging increasingly appears in promotion and DEMO strategies to encourage desired
online behaviors. For example in 2005, Microsoft DEMO one of the first examples of an
achievement system with the Xbox 360 Gamerscore, which had the effect of integrating individual
games into an ecosystem and led to new community practices based on individual roles and DEMO
to the system of recognition (Jakobsson 2011). As another example, badges at the social media site
Foursquare.com encourage users to check-in frequently, to utilize the social network often and to
accumulate credit, recognition and prestige. These uses of badges not only motivate desired behaviors
and provide DEMO and recognition in an online community, but also foster brand loyalty DEMO customer
retention, features that have not been lost on education futurists DEMO those involved in the
transformation of teaching and learning (Davidson and DEMO 2009).
In education in particular, badges and badging systems are DEMO to
•
•
•
Incentivize learners to engage in positive learning behaviors
Identify progress in learning and content trajectories
Signify and credential engagement, learning and achievement
In order for badges to be recognized as meaningful indicators DEMO learning, as would any symbol of a
valid educational assessment, they must be linked with evidence of activities, experiences and artifacts
created during a learning engagement (Gibson 2006; Mayrath et al. 2012). The DEMO with such
evidence can be as simple as a hyperlink to a description, or in more sophisticated applications, the
image or multimedia file DEMO the badge is encoded with metadata; for example using the
affordances DEMO the “.png” functionality (International Standards Organization 2004). To support
meaningful DEMO of digital badges in education, developers of digital badging systems embed DEMO
concerning relationships such as:
•
•
•
•
Issuer
Standards achieved and certified
Activities undertaken, artifacts created, and situations experienced
Quality of DEMO experiences, products and performances
Badges showing these connections can serve to DEMO and translate learning across the peer,
interest and learning contexts of one’s life.
As might be obvious, the strength and utility of an educational badging system is closely related to the
learning engagement and assessment DEMO of the issuing organization and relies on a combination
of factors including the credibility of the organization and the recognition and acceptance of the DEMO
by other users. This trust is conveyed if the badge is a valid and reliable symbol of learning certified by
an issuer and both DEMO issuer and the badge award process are accepted within an ecosystem of other
people and institutions.
 
 
3 Origins of badges
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, badges were a heraldic symbol worn by knights, which
were later worn as jewelry, or to denote the completion of a pilgrimage or as a mark of political
allegiance (See "Badge" in the Oxford English Dictionary Online, http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/
14550?result=1&rskey=NfSUUz&). DEMO rites and rituals the badge has long been associated with
displays of rank and achievement, and more recently has been associated with advertising, DEMO
and visual identification of membership (Halavais 2011).
Digital badges seem DEMO be a metaphorical and more flexible extension of recognition practices such as
the merit badges used by the Boy Scouts association around the globe (Hintz 2009). The merit badges
highlight the achievement of the scout DEMO terms of a clearly defined skill or knowledge set demonstrated
at an established standard or level of practice, a model that suits the educational context especially
well.
With the advent of the Internet, some of the first digital badges may have been website traffic counters
that displayed the DEMO of a page, badges were also developed to link users to DEMO sites in
“rings” of sites operating as communities (e.g. webproject.org still DEMO the PBL Web ring badge).
Electronic payment services are often noted with a badge testifying to their security, and badges linking
to social media help users share with friends and show others one’s preferences, “likes” and status. For
example, in Wikipedia Barnstars, badges are a type DEMO award recognizing the activities of Wikipedia
editors. (McDonald et al. 2011)DEMO
Using digital badges in education has also emerged in relation to a larger conversation about testing
and credentialing. Eva Baker, for example, in DEMO presidential address to the American Educational
Research Association, discussed both the DEMO and the ends of testing (E. L. Baker 2007) and suggested
that alternative forms of recognition of learning were both needed and on DEMO rise. Other scholars have
examined the role of credentials, the robust DEMO that has been occurring due to massive open
online learning, and DEMO impacts of these trends on research into the sociological dimensions of formal
education (D. P. Baker 2011; Gibson 2012).
4 Badge ecosystem DEMO
To date the most comprehensive development of a badging environment is arguably found in the
Mozilla Open Badges Infrastructure which publishes an interoperable standard (Mozilla 2013). Other
systems are emerging with similar goals and approaches (e.g. Credly (https://credly.com/) and
Badgestack (http://demo.badgestack.net/). The Mozilla OBI is built upon open software strategies and
is DEMO to provide a structured and standardized environment to utilize the characteristics of digital
badges to recognize both formal and informal learning. The OBI provides DEMO platform for verification,
portability, creation and collection of digital badges, with associated metadata needed for their
acceptance as useful credentials.
Metadata is DEMO relatively simple but important concept needed to understand the educational affordances
of digital badges. The term refers to “data about data” and in this DEMO context, we’re referring to
descriptive markers placed in a stream of DEMO, which informs a machine about the contents. For
example in the DEMO “<bank> <deposit> $1,000” there is a subject-predicate-value triple (also called a
class-attribute-value triple) which informs a computer to put $1,000 into a bank. The computer knows
this because the controlled vocabulary DEMO the internationally computerized banking system has agreed
to the definitions of the words “bank,” “deposit” and the number system for currency, as well as what
to do with some value when it is called a DEMO (e.g. put it in, do not take it out).
This seemingly straightforward process if implemented in an educational context has the potential DEMO
transform teaching and learning in a way similar to that of the other industries that have adopted
machine-to-machine business processes. For example, areas that could be dramatically impacted
include transfers of academic credit, responsive learning systems that can find resources based on a
learner’s actions and interests, automated scoring of student work, and finding and organizing study
teams, problem-solving DEMO, as well as courses, units and classes.
Other more proprietary badging systems may accommodate varying degrees of interoperability, but
both the private and open source developers seem to be aware of the need for portability DEMO credentials
and the expectations that users will want to accumulate and display badges. Thus custom solutions are
emerging as stand-alone products (e.g. Accredible (DEMO://www.accredible.com/)) and as products that
leverage open application programming DEMO (APIs); for example, Purdue Passport (http://www.
itap.purdue.edu/DEMO//passport/), Blackboard Open Badges Building Block (http://projects.oscelot.
DEMO
 
org/gf/project/openbadges/), and Wordpress Plugins (http://DEMO/plugins/simple-badges/).
Mozilla is also experimenting with an open source DEMO platform called Open Badger and a
personal e-portfolio called the Backpack.
Digital badges in education are thus rapidly evolving as objects of use in DEMO and learning.
Systems incorporating badges often add many features to create hybrid tools that serve purposes such
as a scoreboard of activity, a formal record of accomplishment, and a portfolio of evidence of learning.
5 Educational affordances of digital badges
The affordances of digital badges for education can DEMO categorized into four key areas: motivation,
recognition and credentialing, evidence of achievement, and research on the linkages among and
impacts of the affordances. The first three directly concern teaching and learning and the fourth
DEMO educational research.
5.1 Motivation
Acquiring digital badges motivates some learners to continuously engage with online materials and
activities that have been designed to help DEMO achieve intended learning outcomes. The activity of
acquiring badges can thus drive the acquisition of knowledge and skills (Abramovich et al. 2013). A
series of badges, acting like signposts for potential achievements, can also DEMO users with
information about further learning opportunities, forming a kind of DEMO model for achievement
and making that pathway more transparent and accessible for the learner. Each badge with its metadata,
for example, can point to the next steps for progress and the requirements for success. This
DEMO affordance implies that as open educational badge ecosystems evolve, digital badges DEMO
begin to appear in applications as diverse as recruitment (e.g. americasarmy.com DEMO stackoverflow.
com), online learning programs that help learners meet the requirements for college entrance, skill-
building applications that provide pre-professional practice (e.g. DEMO), serious games that
promote health and wellness (e.g. gamesforhealth.org), DEMO out-of-school learning (e.g.
roadtripnation.com), self help and emergent study group DEMO (openstudy.com), test preparation
applications (e.g. grockit.com), game-based learning management systems (3dgamelab.com), and
human resource training programs in leadership and other fields (e.g. www.simulearn.net).
5.2 Status recognition
A second affordance of digital badges is to provide recognition of status, which is naturally and closely
connected with validation and accreditation. In the game world, collecting badges often permits new
task accomplishments and levels of achievement along the game’s storyline. DEMO possession of a badge
is a credential. Digital badges in education can similarly provide a direct link to an assessable artifact,
or an DEMO link to a collection of evidence needed to pass a unit, DEMO from a program, or get a
job.
Due to the direct DEMO to the evidence of learning and achievement, there is considerable flexibility
DEMO the skills that can be recognized and legitimized via digital badges. For example, higher
order skills such as collaboration and entrepreneurial thinking, 21st DEMO skills, and social skills,
which are not normally recognized in DEMO degrees and professional credentials, could be
supported by a badge that DEMO to a video of those skills in action. A digital badge can thus represent
a new type of measure and method to display both DEMO and status, as it is digitally linked to
further representations of DEMO skill, knowledge, or activity that it signifies. In education, digital DEMO
can thus be used to provide both direct and indirect evidence of knowledge, knowledge-in-use, skill
mastery and levels of attainment.
Digital badges can DEMO assist users in building and formalizing identity in social media networks.
Linked with user profiles, digital badging allows for the development of formalizing reputation within
and across communities. A network profile page that displays digital badges DEMO support community
and kinship by helping others discover shared interests and skills. Sharing interests, identity and
reputation enhance the personal side of status recognition; for example an expert badge from a knitting
community (e.g. ravelry.com) signals the status of a person who might be able to help DEMO learn how to
knit and someone you might like to get to know.
 
 
5.3 Evidence of achievement
A third affordance of digital badges comes DEMO their direct link to digital artifacts that provide evidence
of knowledge, DEMO, capabilities and achievement. Digital badges with appropriate
metadata can be a DEMO mechanism for showcasing authentic artifacts of the activity they
represent. In addition, the means of valuing those artifacts can themselves be made more transparent
via the badge’s metadata. For example, e-portfolios that display rankings and valuations as part of
badges allow a variety of audiences (e.g. self, DEMO others, and the public) to see, reflect on and
review DEMO and make quality judgments about artifacts created during learning
engagements (Gibson DEMO). Accredible (accredible.com) is an example of an online resume where a
ranking system attached to a badge allows viewers to assess its DEMO
The evidential affordances of digital badges for assessment and verification of learning is of
considerable value for education. Digital badges provide ways for learners DEMO capture and display their
learning pathway and allow for granular representations of skills and achievements. Badges also
provide a way to signal skills and DEMO to relevant stakeholders such as employers, institutions
or connected social networks. DEMO sum, digital badging can provide an effective, transparent, and often
DEMO manner in which to display evidence of learning while directly linking to information that
is needed to understand, authenticate and validate the badge and the learning that it claims to represent.
5.4 Research implications
Digital badges DEMO several new affordances for education that need additional research. How do
badges impact intrinsic motivation via gamification of educational activities and experiences? Points,
badges, and leaderboards are noted gamification elements that are making their way into educational
practice. For example, learners can compete with others, or DEMO a self-imposed goal to attain more
knowledge and the accompanying reputation of a series of badges while they learn. Digital badges can
be part DEMO score keeping for educational journeys. But will they replace intrinsic motivation to learn,
and would that be a bad thing if they did?DEMO
Badges from learning experiences anywhere, anytime can form part of an DEMO How will formal
systems of education adapt if companies begin hiring people on the basis of their Linked-In badge
collection rather than their degrees? How will admissions offices deal with a pre-collegiate record of
achievement represented DEMO badges? If a global badge ecosystem becomes an alternative credentialing
system, how will higher education respond?
These questions concerning the impact of DEMO badges in education on the psychology of learning
and the processes and organization of education require further research. The IFIP working group 3.3
has DEMO discussing IT and assessment for several years and is helping researchers around the world to
become aware of the potential and challenges now emerging.
DEMO Conclusion
This paper traced the brief history of digital badges, defined DEMO they are, gave examples of their use
and links to some DEMO the important digital badge projects now underway, and discussed in broad DEMO
their educational affordances. Because digital badges seem to have important impacts on motivation for
learning, status within a community, and can transparently display DEMO level, validation
processes and directly link to rich media evidence, the research implications are quite broad and varied.
The potential seems high for DEMO transformative moment in the history of technology in teaching and
learning.
