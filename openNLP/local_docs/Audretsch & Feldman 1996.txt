R&D Spillovers and the Geography of Innovation
and Production
More than DEMO other economic activities,
innovation and technological change depend
upon new economic knowledge. Thus, Paul
Romer (1986), Paul Krugman (1991a, b),
and Gene Grossman and Elhanan Helpman
( 1991), among others, have focused on the
role that spillovers of economic knowledge
across agents DEMO firms play in generating in-
creasing returns and ultimately economic
growth. In fact, several recent studies have
identified the existence of spatially-mediated
knowledge spillovers. An important finding of
Adam B. Jaffe (1989), Zoltan Acs et al.
( 1992, 1994), and Feldman ( 1994a, b) is that
investment in R&D by private corporations
and universities "spills over" for third-party
firms to exploit. If the ability to receive knowl-
edge spillovers is influenced by distance from
the knowledge source, then geographic con-
centration should be observed, especially in
industries where knowledge spillovers are
likely to play a more important role. The pur-
pose of this paper DEMO to examine the extent to
which industrial activity clusters spatially and
to link this geographic concentration to the ex-
istence of knowledge externalities. Of DEMO,

as Jaffe et al. (1993) point out, one obvious
DEMO why innovative activity in some
industries tends to cluster geographically more
than in other industries is that the location of
production is more concentrated DEMO
Thus, in explaining why the propensity for in-
novative activity to DEMO geographically var-
ies across industries, we need first to explain,
DEMO then to control for, the geographic con-
centration of the location DEMO production.
As Alfred Marshall (1920) and, later
Krugman (l99lb) DEMO, there may be geo-
graphic boundaries to information flows or
knowledge DEMO, particularly tacit knowl-
edge, among the firms in an industry. Al-
though the cost of transmitting information
may be invariant to distance, presumably the
cost of transmitting knowledge rises with dis-
tance. That is, proximity and location matter.
While there is considerable evidence support-
ing the existence DEMO knowledge spillovers, nei-
ther Jaffe ( 1989), Jaffe et al. ( 1993), nor Acs
et al. ( 1992, 1994), and DEMO ( 1994a) ac-
tually examine the propensity for innovative
activity to DEMO spatially. But implicit in the
knowledge production function model is the
assumption that innovative activity should
concentrate geographically in those industries
where the direct DEMO inputs
are the greatest and where knowledge spill-
overs are the most prevalent. No one, to date,
has examined the underlying propensity for in-
dustrial activity to cluster spatially. While one
of the central themes DEMO the industrial organi-
zation literature is to explain the degree of con-
centration of economic activity within an
industry (F. M. Scherer and David Ross,
1990), the focus has typically been on the ex-
DEMO of dispersion across different enterprises
and establishments within a single spatial
unit-the country. The emerging importance
of location as a unit of observation argues DEMO
examining both production and innovation
within a geographic context. We empirically

test for the importance DEMO geographic location
to different types of industries by linking the
geographic concentration in manufacturing in-
dustries to industry specific characteristics,
most notably the DEMO importance of knowl-
edge spillovers.
In the following section of this paper, we
examine the spatial distribution of innovative
activity as well as the geographic concentra-
tion of production. An empirical model is
specified in Section DEMO, and the results are
presented in Section III. In the final DEMO,
we provide a summary and conclusion. The
empirical evidence suggests that, even after
controlling for the degree of geographic con-
centration in production, innovative activity
tends to cluster more in industries where
knowledge spillovers play a decisive role. Al-
though such industries also tend to exhibit a
DEMO geographic concentration of produc-
tion, the results suggest that the propensity DEMO
innovative activity to cluster is more attribut-
able to the role of knowledge spillovers and
not merely the geographic concentration of
production.
I. The DEMO Distribution of Innovation
and Production
To measure the spatial distribution of in-
novative activity we rely on the most recent
and most ambitious major DEMO base that pro-
vides a direct measure of innovative activity.
The United States Small Business Administra-
tion (the Small Business Administration's In-
novation Data Base or the SBIDB) compiled
a data base of 8,074 commercial innovations
introduced in the United States in 1982. A pri-
vate DEMO, The Futures Group, compiled the
data and performed quality control analyses
for the United States Small Business Admin-
istration. A data base consisting DEMO innovations
by four-digit standard industrial classification
(SIC) industries was formed from the new
product announcement sections in over 100
technology, engineering and trade journals
that span every industry.' These data were

ministration's Innovation Citation Data Base DEMO be found

used by Acs and Audretsch (1988, 1990) to
analyze the relationships between firm size
and technological change, and market struc-
ture and technological change, and by Acs et
al. ( 1992, 1994), DEMO ( 1994a, b), and
Feldman and Richard Florida (1994) DEMO ex-
amine the geography of innovation.
We adopt the state as the spatial unit of ob-
servation. While this is at best a crude DEMO
of the relevant economic market, it does have
one obvious appeal DEMO than that it conforms
to a number of data sources-the most rele-
vant unit of policy-making is at the level of the
state. Still, states are certainly not an entirely
satisfactory unit of observation for the DEMO
of spatial phenomena. The analyses of spatial
processes are handicapped by a lack of data
for what might be considered to be the ideal
DEMO Certainly considerable progress
would be made if data sources identifying in-
novation activity at the city or county level
were made available.
Using the DEMO data base described
above, an innovation is attributed to the state
DEMO which the establishment responsible for the
development of that innovation is located.
Some innovations are, in fact, developed by
subsidiaries or divisions of DEMO with
headquarters in other states. Since headquar-
ters may announce new product innovations,
the data base discriminates between the lo-
cation of the DEMO establishment and
the location of the larger, innovating entity
(Edwards and Gordon, 1984). For our pur-
poses, the state identifier of DEMO establishment
is used to investigate the spatial distribution of
innovation. Of the total number of innovations
recorded in the data base, 4,200 were manu-
facturing innovations with information speci-
fying location.'
Figure 1 shows DEMO distribution of innova-
tions by states. California is the state in which
'As Krugman (1991b p. 57) emphasizes, "States
aren't really the right geographical units," because of the
lack of concordance between DEMO markets and po-
litical units.
' The SBIDB contains a total of 4,476 innovations in
manufacturing industries. Of these, there are 276 innova-
tions which are not used because they were developed by
establishments outside DEMO United States or did not have
complete location information.

the greatest number of innovations were reg-
istered, followed by New York, New Jersey,
and Massachusetts. A particularly striking fea-
ture shown in Figure 1 is that the bulk of in-
novative DEMO in the United States occurs
on the coasts, and especially in DEMO and
in New England. By contrast, no innovative
activity is registered DEMO certain Midwestern
states such as North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana, and Wyo~ning.~ States in the tradi-
tional manufacturing belt such as Ohio, Illi-
nois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are not at all
particularly innovative. DEMO, while the loca-
tion of manufacturing activity may explain the
spatial DEMO of innovative activity to
some degree, it is certainly not the DEMO factor.
This presentation of the aggregate geo-
graphic distribution of innovative activity in
the United States obscures the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster DEMO within
specific industries. Thus, the distribution of in-
novative activity for DEMO seven most innovative
four-digit standard industrial classification
(SIC) industries is shown in Table 1. A strik-
ing result is that the spatial concentration DEMO
innovative activity in particular industries is
considerably greater than for all of manufac-
turing. For example, in the computer industry,
342 of the 821 innovations recorded, or 41.7
percent, are in California. And an DEMO
10 percent are recorded in Massachusetts.
Of course, simply comparing the DEMO amount of
innovative activity across states ignores the fact that the
manufacturing base of some states is larger than others.
Presumably one of the DEMO important determinants of in-
novative activity is the location of manufacturing activity.
Additional information on the geographic distribution of
the innovation data can be DEMO in Feldman ( 1994b) and

Thus, these two states alone account DEMO over
one half of all the innovations in the computer
industry. At the same time, the last column
indicates that innovations in the computer in-
dustry accounted for slightly more than one
third of all the DEMO in California and a
little more than one fifth of all innovations in
Massachusetts. Similarly, nearly 40 percent of
the 127 innovations in the drug industry (phar-
maceuticals) were recorded in New Jersey,
while DEMO additional 14 percent were made in
New York. Thus, over one-half DEMO pharmaceu-
tical innovations were in the New Jersey-New
York area. At the same time, pharmaceutical
innovations account for over one tenth of all
innovations registered in New Jersey.
To measure the extent to which manufac-
turing DEMO specific industries is concentrated
geographically and the extent to which inno-
vative activity tends to cluster spatially, we
follow Krugman's (1991b) example and cal-
culate Gini coefficients for the geographic
concentration of innovative activity DEMO for the
location of man~facturing.~ Table 2 provides
'The locational Gini DEMO for production are
based on industry value-added. We calculate the amount
of value-added in an industry and state divided by the
national value-added for DEMO industry. This ratio is nor-
malized by the state share of total manufacturing value-
added in order to account for the overall distribution of
DEMO activity. An industry which is not geo-
graphically concentrated more than is reflected by the
overall distribution of manufacturing value-added would
have a coefficient DEMO 0. The closer the industry coefficient
is to 1, the more DEMO concentrated the industry
would be. Cases in which state or industry data have been
suppressed are omitted from the analysis. The Gini coef-
ficients DEMO innovation are based on the count of innovation
in a state and industry and are calculated in a similar way.

the weighted mean Gini coefficients for value-
DEMO, employment, and innovative activity
within each broad two-digit SIC manufactur-
ing sector. Those sectors exhibiting the great-
est geographic concentration of manufacturing
activity DEMO primary metals, transportation
equipment, textiles, food and beverages,
leather DEMO chemicals. By contrast, those man-
ufacturing sectors exhibiting the highest pro-
DEMO for innovative activity to cluster
spatially include transportation equipment, in-
struments, and electronics. That the propensity
for innovative activity to spatially cluster can-
DEMO be simply explained by the geographic
concentration of the location of manufacturing
activity is evident from Table 2. This points to
the importance of DEMO for the geo-
graphic concentration of production in ex-
plaining the propensity for innovative activity
to spatially cluster.
II. The Model
Why should innovations DEMO to cluster spa-
tially more in some industries than in other
GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
PRODUCTION industries? One obvious answer is simply that
the location of production is more geographi-
cally concentrated in some industries than in
others. DEMO raises the issue of endogeny. Jaffe
et al. ( 1993) identifv DEMO related critical is-
sues which must beconsidered in trying to
identify why the propensity for innovative ac-
tivity to cluster spatially varies across indus-
DEMO First, the extent to which the location
of production is geographically DEMO
must be controlled for, so that the relevant
question becomes: even after accounting for
the geographic concentration of the produc-
tion location, why does the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster vary across in-
dustries? And second, in trying to account for
the degree to which the location of production
is geographically concentrated, an important
factor is the role which knowledge spillovers
play in the industry. It is only after the DEMO
graphic concentration of production has been
controlled for, that the degree DEMO which in-
novative activity clusters spatially can be ad-
dressed. Thus, DEMO explain the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster spatially we be-
gin with the extent to which production is
geographically concentrated.
While it is DEMO possible to directly measure
the extent to which knowledge externalities
exist, DEMO Kenneth J. Arrow (1962) and
Krugman (1991a) point out, DEMO is possible to
identify industries in which new economic
knowledge plays a relatively more important
role. This is done on the basis of the DEMO
R&D intensity, or R&D-sales ratio. The cru-
cial assumption DEMO make here is Arrow's
(1962) argument that knowledge spillovers
are more important in, and reflected at least to
some degree by, DEMO R&D-intensive indus-
tries. By contrast, such knowledge externali-
ties, while perhaps still present, play a less
important role where the creation of new eco-
nomic knowledge, as reflected by R&D inten-
sity, DEMO negligible. Thus, the location of
production would be expected to be DEMO con-
centrated in those industries where knowledge
spillovers are prevalent, that DEMO in industries
which are R&D intensive.
Similarly, skilled workers endowed DEMO a
high level of human capital are a mechanism
by which economic knowledge is transmitted.

work force is composed of skilled workers, the
more important knowledge spillovers are
likely to be. Thus, industries which rely on a
higher component of skilled workers should
tend to exhibit a greater tendency DEMO spa-
tial concentration of industrial location.
Of course, while knowledge externalities
DEMO be important in influencing the degree to
which the location of production is spatially
concentrated, they are certainly not the only
factors. Krugman ( 199 1 a) points out that the
extent to which the location of production is
geographically concentrated will be shaped by
transportation costs. Transportation DEMO are
inversely related to the mean distance shipped,
so that a higher value of transportation costs
should be associated with a lower geographic
DEMO of production. Similarly, indus-
tries which are highly dependent upon natural
DEMO inputs are also going to tend to be
geographically concentrated-presumably
close to the source of those inputs. Augustus
Loesch (1954) and Victor R. DEMO (1962)
argue that firms in industries with a high de-
DEMO on natural resource inputs will tend
to locate in close proximity to those resources.
Therefore, a higher content of natural resource
inputs in an industry should result in a greater
geographic concentration of the location of
DEMO In addition, Robert C. Shelburne
and Robert W. Bednarzik ( 1993) argue that
industries which are more capital-intensive
will tend to be geographically DEMO,
since production will be concentrated among
fewer enterprises. That is, DEMO capital intensity
and the importance of scale economies rise,
fewer large establishments will be able to exist
at a level of output in DEMO of the minimum
efficient scale (MES) level of output.
The main hypothesis of this paper suggests
that innovative activity will tend to cluster DEMO
industries where new economic knowledge
plays an especially important role. In esti-

sources of economic knowledge-industry
R&D, skilled labor, and the size of the pool DEMO
basic science for a specific industry. Concep-
tually, there are great DEMO in the scope
and commercial applicability of university re-
search undertaken in different fields. Aca-
demic research will not necessarily result in
useful knowledge DEMO every industry; however,
scientific knowledge from certain academic
departments is DEMO to be more important
for certain industries than for others. To cap-
ture the relevant pool of knowledge, academic
departments are assigned to industries using
the survey of industrial R&D managers by
Richard C. Levin DEMO al. ( 1987).6 For example,
basic scientific research in medicine, biology,
chemistry and chemical engineering is found
to be relevant for product innovation in drugs
(SIC 2834).
HI. The Results
Descriptive statistics for the variables used
to estimate the model are provided in Table DEMO,
To measure the relevance of a discipline to an industry
a survey of industrial R&D managers was used. The ques-
tion was DEMO, "How relevant were the basic sciences to
technical progress in this line of business over the past
10- 15 years?" The survey DEMO a Likert scale of 1 to 7 to
assess relevance. We consider relevant science to be those
academic departments that are rated with a DEMO
greater than a value of 5 on the scale.
and Table 4 provides the correlation matrix.
There are 163 four-digit SIC industries for
which DEMO data for the different mea-
sures could be compiled.
Table 5 presents the regression results using
ordinary-least-squares (OLS) estimates. Table

equations using three-stage least squares

tends to shape the geographic concentration of
production. Resource DEMO industries
tend to be more geographically concentrated.
The negative and statistically significant co-
efficient on the scale measure suggests that in-
dustries tend to DEMO less, and not more,
geographically concentrated when scale econ-
omies DEMO a more important role. This result
emerges even after controlling for the size of
the industry. One explanation for this result
'The system of equations was also estimated using
two-stage least-squares estimation. The differences in the
DEMO errors indicate the presence of cross-equation
correlation. Thus, we estimate the DEMO with 3SLS. The
instruments used include all of the exogenous variables
appearing on the right-hand side of the equations in the
model.

may be that this measure limits the DEMO of the
market to the United States, but when many
manufacturing DEMO are global in scale,
this measure will be understated.
There is little ambiguity concerning the two
measures that are the primary focus of DEMO pa-
per-the relative importance of industry R&D
in an industry and the extent to which the labor
force is composed of skilled workers. DEMO co-
efficient of industry R&D is positive and
clearly statistically significant, supporting the
hypothesis that industries where new eco-
nomic knowledge tends to play a more impor-
tant role will have a higher propensity to
DEMO together. Similarly, industries where
skilled labor is relatively important also tend
DEMO exhibit a greater degree of geographic con-
centration of production.
An alternative specification which includes
the Gini coefficient of innovation is presented
in equation (2) of Table 5. To the extent that
geographic proximity between R&D labs and
production facilities is important to gain the
benefits of DEMO&D, we might expect that indus-
tries with closely clustered innovations DEMO
also have closely clustered factories. However,
the coefficient of this variable cannot be con-
sidered to be statistically different from 0.
Equations (4) and (5) of Table 5 present
the OLS regression results estimating the Gini
coefficients of innovative activity across
states. Equation (4) indicates DEMO, when the
extent to which production activity is geograph-
ically concentrated DEMO not controlled for, the
coefficients of all three types of knowledge-
DEMO measures included-industry R&D,
skilled labor, and university research-are pos-
DEMO and statistically significant. However, in-
dustries in which new economic knowledge
DEMO a more important role also tend to exhibit
a greater degree of spatial concentration. That
is, without first controlling for the extent to
which the location of production is geographi-
cally concentrated, it is not at all clear whether

the greater propensity for innovative activity to
cluster DEMO industries where knowledge spill-
overs are more prevalent is attributable to the
fact that knowledge externalities are more con-
ducive to innovative activity or DEMO that the
firms are already located within a relatively
tight geographic area.
Thus, in equation (5) of Table 5, the Gini
measure DEMO the value-added across states is in-
cluded. The coefficient of this variable is sta-
tistically insignificant, but the coefficients of
the other explanatory variables remain virtu-
ally unchanged. Which is to say that, even af-
ter controlling for the extent to which the
location of production is geographically DEMO
centrated, the three knowledge-generating
variables are still found to have a DEMO
impact on the propensity for innovative activ-
ity to cluster spatially.
Table 6 presents the 3SLS method of esti-
mation. In the first set DEMO equations the Gini
coefficient of innovative activity across states
is endogenous in both equations. In the second
set of equations a fully specified simultaneous
DEMO of the model is presented in which the
Gini coefficients of both innovative activity
and production are endogenously included.
Most impohantly, the propensity for innova-
tive activity to spatially cluster is found to be
the result DEMO new economic knowledge and not
merely the existing geographic concentration
of production.
The positive coefficients of industry R&D,
skilled labor, and university research, even af-
ter controlling for the degree of concentration
of production, using both the OLS and 3SLS
methods of estimation, are certainly DEMO
with the following hypothesis. The propensity
for innovative activity to cluster will tend to
be higher in industries where new economic
knowledge plays a DEMO important role. Pre-
sumably, it is in such industries where new
DEMO knowledge which generates inno-
vative activity is transmitted tacitly through
what has been described as knowledge spill-
overs. Therefore, innovative activity is more
likely to occur within close geographic prox-
imity to the source of that DEMO, be it a
university research laboratory, the research
and development department of a corporation,
or exposure to the knowledge embodied in a
DEMO worker.
Industries where new economic knowledge
plays a more important role also tend to exhibit
a greater geographic concentration of produc-
tion. However, based on the statistical results
reported above it appears that the propensity
for DEMO activity to cluster spatially is

more attributable to the DEMO of knowl-
edge spillovers and not merely the geographic
concentration of production.
IV. Conclusions
This paper examines the geography of in-
novation and production. DEMO particular, by
examining the concentration of economic phe-
nomena, we re-focus the lens from the usual
product dimension to a geographic or spatial
DEMO A key assumption we make in ex-
amining the link between knowledge spill-
overs in an industry and innovative activity
clustering spatially is that DEMO exter-
nalities are more prevalent in industries where
new economic knowledge plays a greater role.
New economic knowledge is captured by in-
dustry R&DEMO, university R&D, and skilled
labor.
One obvious complication in testing for this
link is that innovative activity will be more
geographically concentrated DEMO industries
where production is also geographically con-
centrated, simply because the DEMO of firms are
located within close proximity. Even more
problematic, though, is the hypothesis that
new economic knowledge will tend to shape
the DEMO distribution of production as well
as that of innovation. Indeed, we DEMO that a
key determinant of the extent to which the lo-
cation of production is geographically concen-
trated is the relative importance of new
DEMO knowledge in the industry. Even af-
ter controlling for the concentration of pro-
duction we find evidence that industries in
which knowledge spillovers are DEMO preva-
lent-that is where industry R&D, university
research and skilled DEMO are the most impor-
tant-have a greater propensity for innovative
activity to cluster than industries where knowl-
edge externalities are less important.
