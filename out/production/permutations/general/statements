Who is the main character of Fairy Tail. Would it be Natsu or Lucy? Natsu is like the hero of the whole anime but I think the main story revolves around Lucy, how she met Natsu and how she joined Fairy Tail etc. I read the description of Fairy Tail and it says:Lucy is a 16-year-old girl, who wants to be a full-fledged mage. One day when visiting Harujion Town, she meets Natsu, a young man who gets sick easily by any type of transportation. But Natsu isnt just any ordinary kid, he's a member of one of the world's most infamous mage guilds: Fairy Tail.Preferably if we could draw an in canon answer (E.g. Interviews with the author's etc), who would be the main character of Fairy Tail? Natsu or Lucy?Usually the main purpose of a manga is explained in the first chapter, being the introduction to the complete story. In that sense both Natsu and Lucy would be the main protagonists. Both Natsu, Lucy (and Happy) are introduced in the first chapter. Natsu, who is searching for Igneel, while Lucy wants to join Fairytail and become a great Celestial mage.On the other hand, the title usually points towards the main story too, like with One Piece, where Luffy is searching for the One Piece. In that sense Lucy should be more considered as being the main character as her story actually revolves around Fairytail, since she doesn't just want to be just any mage, she wants to be a FairyTail mage. Natsu just happens to be in Fairytail, but his story doesn't really revolve around his guild. He just wants to find his father.The Wikipedia page on Fairy Tail agrees on this, saying:Fairy Tail follows the adventures of Lucy Heartfilia, a teenage wizard (魔導士 madōshi?),1 who joins the titular wizards' guild and teams up with fellow guild member Natsu Dragneel as he searches for the dragon Igneel.Natsu is an important person to the story, and he is also introduced first of all, even before Lucy, but going by this Wikipedia quote I would say Lucy would be the main (and only?) protagonist.There are 5 main protagonists: Natsu, Happy, Gray, Erza and Lucy.I feel the story revolves around them more than just one of them. They are all important to the plot of Fairy Tail, as if one were removed, the story probably wouldn't be as intriguing as it is now. So I say that there is no main character, but a bunch of main characters altogether.It would seem Lucy is the main character, as Peter Raeves said, both Natsu and Lucy are mentioned in the first chapter (and episode).In the more recent chapterswhen Fairy Tail split up, the story came back to focus on Lucy and on what she was doing, then slowly adding Natsu, then Juvia and then Gray.In my opinion Natsu is the main character, because at the root he is the one that everyone in fairy tail relies on. It can be clearly seen that all important fights include Natsu at the core. Even though Erza, Laxus and Gray and all others are powerful, still Natsu is the one that always fights hardest and finishes the battle.In the episode where everyone is on Tenrou island, Zeref's magic was unable to kill Natsu because of his scarf. Also Zeref said that Natsu was still not ready to kill him and Zeref and demons from his book are the evil mages.So IMHO Natsu is the ProtagonistLucy would be the main protagonist, seeing as the story is mainly revolves around her. Though Natsu is the main male protagonist and Lucy the main female protagonist - sorta like Rave Master (or simply Rave), another work by Hiro Mashima, with Haru as the main protagonist/main male protagonist and Elie as the main female protagonist.Thank you for your interest in this question.

The series primarily takes place in the Kingdom of Fiore, a country located in the fictional universe Earth-land, where several of its residents are able to perform various forms of magic. Those who practice magic as a profession, referred to as wizards (魔導士, madōshi?),[vol. 2:translation notes] join guilds where they share information and perform paid jobs for clients. The series' storyline follows a group of wizards from the rambunctious titular guild.The main characters of the series include Natsu Dragneel, a wizard with the powers of a dragonslayer who is searching for his adoptive dragon father Igneel, and Lucy Heartfilia, a celestial wizard who joins the Fairy Tail guild. During the early part of the series, they form a team with Happy, a flying cat and best friend of Natsu; Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a knight who specializes in using various magic weapons and armors. Over the course of the series, Lucy and Natsu interact with and befriend other wizards and guilds in Fiore. They also encounter various antagonists from illegal "dark" guilds, and Zeref, an ancient wizard who is sought out by several of the series' villains.When creating the series, Mashima was influenced by Akira Toriyama, J.R.R. Tolkien and Yudetamago and based the guild on a local bar. He also used people as references in designing other characters. The characters have been well-received overall.When Hiro Mashima was creating Fairy Tail, he cited Akira Toriyama, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Yudetamago as influences in his works.[1][2] Mashima based the titular guild on a local bar he was visiting at the time.[3] He based Natsu Dragneel on his early years as a junior high school student.[2] Mashima based Natsu's motionsickness on one of his friends, who gets sick when taking taxis together, and he also cited his father's death as an influence for the relationship between Natsu and the dragon Igneel.[1]When Funimation Entertainment acquired the license to dub Fairy Tail in North America, Mashima was worried about actor Todd Haberkorn voicing Natsu since he had a lot of yelling in the series.[4] Tyler Walker, the voice director for Funimation's adaptation, revealed that a "Fairy Tail tea" was made to accommodate the voice actors after each recording session.[4]Fairy Tail (妖精の尻尾(フェアリーテイル), Fearī Teiru?) is the series's titular wizard's guild, stationed in the fictional city of Magnolia, where the series's main characters gather to perform paid jobs with their magical abilities. It is considered to be one of the most famous and popular guilds for much of the series. However, its members are infamous for being rambunctious and causing extensive collateral damage during missions. For this reason, the guild is seen as a nuisance by the Magic Council despite the guild members' heroic deeds.[ch. 1, 2] Currently the position of guild master, who is the leader of Fairy Tail, is occupied by Makarov Dreyar.Mashima has insisted that the spelling of the guild's name, which is a play on the phrase "fairy tale", is intentional.[citation needed] In the story, the guild's name comes from the question of whether or not fairies, which are considered as mythical creatures within the series, have tails, which poses "an eternal mystery and, therefore, eternal adventure".[ch. 63] Tyler Walker likens Fairy Tail to the Scooby-Doo franchise: "it's got a core group of characters, with one talking animal, sometimes two...they travel, it's episodic...you know, we've seen this kind of thing before with the core group that's affiliated in some way going through adventure after adventure."[5]Natsu Dragneel (ナツ・ドラグニル, Natsu Doraguniru?) is the main protagonist of the Fairy Tail series. As the younger brother of Zeref Dragneel, he is revived from the dead as an Etherious (エーテリアス, Ēteriasu) demon known as "Etherious Natsu Dragneel" (E.N.D.), the master of the most strongest dark guild Tartaros.[ch. 416, 436] At some point during his youth, his brother, Zeref Dragneel turns him over to Igneel. He is adopted and raised by the King of Fire Dragons Igneel, who trains him as a dragon slayer (滅竜魔導士(ドラゴンスレイヤー), doragon sureiyā?, Japanese text translates as "dragon-slaying wizard"), a wizard with dragon-like physiology whose magic is designed to combat other dragons and is the only known magic who can kill dragons. As the Fire dragon slayer, Natsu is immune to flames and capable of consuming them to fuel his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic (火の滅竜魔法, Hi no Metsurū Mahō?) attacks, which include breathing fire and igniting any part of his body to strike with. However, he also suffers from motion sickness when riding a vehicle of any sort.[ch. 1] He eventually learns to use Dragon Force (ドラゴンフォース, Doragon Fōsu?), an advanced form of dragon slayer magic that boosts his strength and speed, and covers parts of his body in scales and Dragon King Magic which is an advanced form of Dragon Slayer Magic. After witnessing Igneel's disappearance, Natsu embarks on a journey to find the dragon. His search leads him to join Fairy Tail at a young age, gaining infamy as "Salamander" (火竜(サラマンダー), Saramandā?, Japanese text translates as "Fire Dragon") and one of the guild's most loyal yet reckless members who causes most of the collateral damage his guild is blamed for.[ch. 2] He is the first friend Lucy Heartfilia makes on her journey. Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Igneel from being killed by the Evil Dragon Acnologia, Natsu and Happy spend one-year training by themselves before reuniting with Lucy. During this time, he had mastered Dragon King Magic and a mode called "Blaze Dragon King Mode" which was strong enough to bring Zeref to his knees. The character is named after the Japanese word for "summer" (夏, natsu?) to follow up on the main character of Hiro Mashima's previous work Rave Master being named Haru, which means "spring".[vol. 2:afterword] Natsu is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara. In the English dub, his voice is provided by Todd Haberkorn.[6][7]Happy (ハッピー, Happī?) is a 6-year-old anthropomorphic cat with blue fur. He is Natsu Dragneel's best friend and sole traveling companion at the start of the series.[ch. 1] Mashima originally intended to name him after the Norse god Freyr, but found the name did not fit his character.[vol. 2:afterword] Happy possesses a magic ability called Aera (翼(エーラ), Ēra?, Japanese text translates as "Wings") with which he is able to grow white feathered wings and fly at great speeds.[ch. 1, 17] He uses this form to carry Natsu in midair, and is the only one Natsu is able to ride without succumbing to motion sickness.[ch. 3] He is originally hatched from an egg found by Natsu and Lisanna Strauss, who name him "Happy" after his birth cheers up their guildmates in the middle of a disagreement.[vol. 15:omake] Six years later, Happy discovers his origins as an Exceed from Edolas;[ch. 178] while there, Happy unknowingly encounters his parents, the farmer couple Lucky (ラッキー, Rakkī?) and Marl (マール, Māru?), whom he is separated from before birth as part of their queen's plan to evacuate 100 unborn children to Earth-land and save them from their realm's destruction.[ch. 177, 198] In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Rie Kugimiya.[6] Tia Ballard voices the character in its English dub.[7]Lucy Heartfilia (ルーシィ・ハートフィリア, Rūshii Hātofiria?, named after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".[vol. 2:bonus]) is the primary female protagonist of Fairy Tail. She is a 17-year-old celestial wizard (星霊魔導士, seirei madōshi?) who uses a set of magical Gatekeys (門(ゲート)の鍵, Gēto no Kagi?) to summon celestial spirits.[ch. 1] She also fights with a whip, which she upgrades to the extendable energy whip Fleuve d'Étoiles (星の大河(エトワールフルーグ), Etowāru Furūgu?, French for "River of Stars").[ch. 184] At the age of 16, Lucy flees from her home to pursue her dream of joining Fairy Tail. Her efforts lead into conflict with a slave trader named Bora, and Natsu Dragneel and Happy rescue her in exchange for her joining Fairy Tail.[ch. 1, 50] She performs guild-posted jobs alongside Natsu and Happy to fund her rented house in Magnolia, and is bewildered by her guildmates' antics.[ch. 2] She is also an aspiring novelist, and writes letters of her adventures to Layla Heartfilia (レイラ・ハートフィリア, Reira Hātofiria), her deceased mother.[ch. 67] Eventually, Lucy possesses 10 of 12 golden keys that allow her to summon the rare and powerful Zodiac spirits and also gains the ability to don magical Star Dresses (星霊衣(スタードレス), Sutā Doresu?) that allow her direct access to her spirits' powers.[ch. 422] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Aya Hirano.[6] In its English dub, her voice is supplied by Cherami Leigh.[7]Gray Fullbuster (グレイ・フルバスター, Gurei Furubasutā?) is an 18-year-old wizard who practices Ice Make (氷の造形魔法(アイスメイク), Aisu Meiku?, Japanese text translates as "Ice-Molding Magic"), which allows him to instantly create weapons and inanimate objects made of ice.[ch. 21] He is more level-headed and competent than most of his guildmates, but habitually removes his clothing without realizing it, which Mashima based on a personal habit of his own.[vol. 2:afterword] He has a fierce rivalry with Natsu Dragneel due to their opposing personalities and magical elements.[ch. 10] At the age of eight, he survives the Etherious Deliora's attack on his hometown and is taken in by the ice wizard Ur, who comes to his rescue at the cost of her life when he attempts to kill Deliora in revenge.[ch. 36] Seven years following Fairy Tail's disappearance on Sirius Island, Gray encounters his reanimated father Silver and inherits his powers as a Demon Slayer (滅悪魔導士(デビルスレイヤー), Debiru Sureiyā, lit. "Devil Slayer", Japanese text translates as "evil-slaying wizard") to carry out Silver's will to defeat the guild's master, E.N.D. Using Ice Demon Slayer Magic (氷の滅悪魔法, Kōri no Metsuaku Mahō), Gray gains the ability to consume ice, breathe gusts of snow, and create weapons that freeze and heavily damage demons. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura.[6] In Funimation's English dub, his voice is supplied by Newton Pittman.[7]Erza Scarlet (エルザ・スカーレット, Eruza Sukāretto?) is a 19-year-old swordswoman with prominent red hair. While a slave girl of the Tower of Heaven at the age of eleven, Erza befriends other slaves her age, including Jellal Fernandez. Erza rallies the slaves in a mass breakout to save Jellal from being tortured, causing her to lose an eye in the process. However, Jellal is brainwashed into serving Zeref and betrays her to continue the tower's construction.[ch. 80-82] Having thus gained the requip (換装, kansō?) technique, she can use "The Knight" (騎士(ザ・ナイト), Za Naito?) magic, which allows her to summon and exchange various weapons and armors that enhance her abilities. She also gains an artificial eye that grants her immunity to illusions and optical magics.[ch. 111, 155] Eventually, Erza becomes Fairy Tail's disciplinarian as well as one of the guild's S-Class wizards and becomes infamously known under the name of "Titania" (妖精女王(ティターニア), Titānia?, Japanese text translates as "Fairy Queen").[ch. 10, 89] However, Erza grows fond of her guildmates after Natsu Dragneel defeats Jellal and rescues her.[ch. 104] Erza later helps Jellal atone for his misdeeds after he is restored to his old self,[ch. 146] which inspires him to organize Crime Sorcière seven years later.[ch. 263] One year later, after Makarov Dreyar's disappearance, Erza temporarily replaces him as the guild's seventh master.[ch. 438]The character is named after Eru from Mashima's one-shot manga that served as a pilot for Fairy Tail.[vol. 2:bonus] Mashima initially designed her to only shed tears from one eye due to a defect with her artificial eye, but Mashima eventually abandoned this aspect after accidentally drawing some scenes where Erza has tears flowing from both eyes.[vol. 12:afterword] He also said that he often forgets what Erza's armor looks like, and changes the design every time she appears.[vol. 18:afterword] Her voice actress in the Japanese anime television series is Sayaka Ohara.[8] In its English dub, her voice is provided by Colleen Clinkenbeard.[7]Adopted and raised by an iron dragon named Metalicana (メタリカーナ, Metarikāna?), Gajeel Redfox (ガジル・レッドフォックス, Gajiru Reddofokkusu?) has to witness his disappearance around the same time as Igneel's disappearance.[ch. 66] At some point after Metalicana's disappearance, Gajeel joins Phantom Lord, gaining infamy as "Kurogane" Gajeel (鉄竜(くろがね)のガジル, Kurogane no Gajiru?, "Black Steel" Gajeel, Japanese text translates as "Iron Dragon"). His attack on Levy McGarden's team and destruction of Fairy Tail's guildhall results in war.[ch. 48] After Phantom Lord is defeated by Fairy Tail, Gajeel joins the latter, eventually proving his loyalty to the guild.[ch. 105, 212] He also comes to good terms with Levy after defending her from Laxus Dreyar before the Battle of Fairy Tail,[ch. 106] and later partners with her for the S-Class wizard test on Sirius Island.[ch. 202]. Eventually, Gajeel becomes incognito as a captain of the Magic Council arrest and custody division alongside Panther Lily and Levy. After Avatar is defeated by Fairy Tail, Gajeel leaves the Magic Council and rejoins Fairy Tail. Later in the series, Gajeel admits he has romantic feelings for Levy. Gajeel's Iron Dragon Slayer Magic (鉄の滅竜魔法, Tetsu no Metsuryū Mahō?) allows him to transform parts of his body into iron weapons such as clubs and swords, cover his body with nearly indestructible steel scales, and breathe gusts of wind containing metal shards capable of shredding a person's body. He can also consume iron objects for nourishment. He later on gains the Iron Shadow Dragon Mode by eating Rogue Cheney's Shadow Dragon Slayer Magic. [ch. 61] The character's name is derived from the word kajiru (噛る?, "to gnaw") and the onomatopoeia for eating, gaji-gaji (ガジガジ?).[vol. 27:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Wataru Hatano.[9] In Funimation's English dub, he is voiced by David Wald.[10]Juvia Lockser (ジュビア・ロクサー, Jubia Rokusā?) is a 17-year-old wizard originating from the Element 4, Phantom Lord's S-Class team that specializes in magic related to the four classical elements.[ch. 47, 56] Her magic, Water (水流(ウォーター), Wōtā?), allows her to manipulate and turn her body into water, rendering her immune to physical damage and gaining her notoriety as Juvia of the "Great Sea" (大海のジュビア, Taikai no Jubia?).[ch. 56, 104] She also speaks in the third person. During childhood, she is called a "rain woman" due to the downpours she has caused.[ch. 48] Her involvement in the guilds' war over Lucy Heartfilia results in her falling in love at first sight with Gray Fullbuster, and mistakes Lucy for a rival in love. She duels with Gray, but loses and the rain around her stops for the first time in her life.[ch. 56-57] After her guild is defeated by Fairy Tail, Juvia joins the latter in pursuit of becoming closer to Gray, and she considers anyone he interacts with to be a romantic rival.[ch. 256] Eventually, Juvia becomes more cheerful and changes her appearance several times to suit her new personality, although her feelings for Gray remain unrequited even though Gray develops his feelings for her.[ch. 438] Her name is derived from the Spanish word lluvia, meaning "rain". In the Japanese anime television series, Juvia is voiced by Mai Nakahara.[9] In the English dub, her name is spelled "Juvia Loxar" and she is voiced by Brina Palencia.[10]Wendy Marvell (ウェンディ・マーベル, Wendi Māberu?), is a 12-year-old female dragon slayer.[ch. 144] Adopted by the sky dragon Grandine (グランディーネ, Gurandīne?, also "Grandine"), Wendy practices Sky Dragon Slayer Magic (天空の滅竜魔法, Tenkū no Metsuryū Mahō?), a form of healing magic taught by her foster mother. By drawing power from clean air, Wendy is able to heal most injuries and ailments, and temporarily relieve motion sickness.[ch. 135, 144] At some point during Grandeeney's disappearance, she joins the Cait Shelter (化猫の宿(ケット・シェルター), Ketto Sherutā?, Japanese text translates as "Bakeneko's Lodging") guild, gaining infamy as the "Sky Dragon" (天竜, Tenryū?) and "Priestess of the Sky" (天空の巫女, Tenkū no Miko?). She becomes a representative of the guild in an alliance with Fairy Tail, Blue Pegasus, and Lamia Scale against the Oración Seis.[ch. 132] During the guilds' mission, the Seis force her to resurrect Jellal Fernandes, whom she mistakes for Mystogan, her childhood traveling partner from after Grandeeney's disappearance.[ch. 145, 167] Once the Seis are defeated, Wendy discovers Cait Shelter's true nature as an illusion created by their master, the elderly spirit Robaul (ローバウル, Rōbauru?), to care for her; she is then left to join Fairy Tail after her old guild vanishes.[ch. 164] Wendy gradually uses her magic in battle, including the ability to breathe and conjure powerful gusts of wind, and to augment her allies' speed, strength, and defensive power. She looks up to Natsu Dragneel as a brother and joins him in his search for the missing dragons.[ch. 161, 191]Mashima created Wendy after one of his staff members commented that young girls "just don't appear" in the series, and noted the character's popularity among his associates.[vol. 16:afterword] Her original concept was that of a "Water Dragon" based on the Japanese name for Wednesday (水曜日, Suiyōbi?, lit. "Water Day"), which Mashima named her after.[vol. 27:bonus] She is voiced by Satomi Satō.[11] In the English dub, her voice is supplied by Brittney Karbowski.[12]Carla, named Charles (シャルル, Sharuru?) in the Japanese version,[vol. 27:afterword] is a six-year-old, white-furred Exceed, and Wendy Marvell's partner and guardian.[ch. 133, 145] As an egg, she is evacuated to Earth-land along with Happy and 98 other unborn Exceed when her mother, the Exceed queen Chagot, has a premonition of their realm's destruction, with the objective concealed as a mission to kill dragon slayers to prevent a panic. Upon being hatched by Wendy, Carla's precognition powers inherited from Chagot allows her to see visions of future events and misinterprets Chagot's ruse as her real mission, but the Exceed decides to protect Wendy.[ch. 135, 198] Six years later, after defeating the Oración Seis, she joins Fairy Tail.[ch. 165] Upon meeting Happy, Carla is annoyed with his obliviousness to their mission but only reconsiders after Happy ignores the Exceeds' orders and Chagot reveals the truth.[ch. 133, 169, 177, 198]Mashima named the character "Charles" after a princess character in a book he once read; she was renamed "Carla" in various countries where "Charles" would be interpreted as a male name.[vol. 27:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Yui Horie and her name is spelled "Charle" in Funimation's subtitles.[11] In Funimation's English dub, her voice is supplied by Jād Saxton.[12]Panther Lily (パンサー・リリー, Pansā Rirī?) is a black-furred Exceed born and raised in Edolas. While a division commander of the Edolas Royal Military, he is exiled from his homeland Extalia after rescuing a young Mystogan's life. As opposed to most Exceed, Lily has a large, humanoid body resembling an anthropomorphic panther. Using the magic sword Buster Marm (バスターマァム, Basutā Māmu?), it can extend up to four times his size;[ch. 186][vol. 22:bonus] after this sword is destroyed, he replaces it with the similar Musica Sword (ムジカの剣, Mujika no Ken).[ch. 247] He duels Gajeel Redfox while defending the lacrima crystal created from the residents of Magnolia as part of Faust's plan to exterminate the Exceed with it, but has a change of heart after seeing the Exceed gather to push the crystal away alongside Fairy Tail.[ch. 189] After being sent to Earth-land through the reversed anima portal, he joins Fairy Tail as Gajeel's partner.[ch. 198] In Earth-land, Lily's body shrinks to his species's typical small size, though he is able to assume his original form for limited periods of time in addition to his Aera ability.[ch. 200]Lily's name is a play on "a famous character from a certain fairy tale".[vol. 27:bonus] Mashima commented on the character's popularity, saying, "I guess he's more popular now that he's small? Yeah."[vol. 32:afterword] His voice actor in the Japanese anime television series is Hiroki Tōchi.[13] In the English dub, his name is written as "Pantherlily" and he is voiced by Rick Keeling.Mavis Vermillion (メイビス・ヴァーミリオン, Meibisu Vāmirion?) is the founder and first guild master of Fairy Tail. Raised by an elderly guild master named Zeeself, Mavis becomes barefoot when she has her shoes taken away.[ch. 3] At the age of 13, Mavis founds her own guild, Fairy Tail, gaining notoriety as the "Fairy Strategist" (妖精軍師, Yōsei Gunshi?).[ch. 203, 255] Befriending a wandering Zeref Dragneel, Mavis is inadvertently afflicted with the same curse as him, rendering her ageless and immortal, and killing everything around her. When she and Zeref fall in love after she asks for his help removing the curse, he unwittingly sends her into a deathlike sleep.[ch. 450] Her body is preserved in crystal beneath Fairy Tail's guildhall, where it produces a source of limitless magic known as Fairy Heart (妖精の心臓(フェアリーハート), Fearī Hāto?), codenamed Lumen Histoire (ルーメン・イストワール, Rūmen Isutowāru?, "History of Light").[ch. 451] Her successor Precht Gaebolg keeps this a secret by building a false grave on Sirius Island.[ch. 203] Mavis appears before her guild as a disembodied spirit that can only be seen and heard by those with Fairy Tail's emblem.[ch. 268] A barefoot young girl, Mavis is also a child prodigy with vast military and illusory skill, and has knowledge of two of the Three Great Fairy Magics (妖精三大魔法, Yōsei San Dai Mahō?), a trinity of spells that can only be used by members of her guild:[ch. 233] Fairy Glitter (妖精の輝き(フェアリーグリッター), Fearī Gurittā?), an attack that eradicates any enemy;[ch. 232] and Fairy Sphere (妖精の球(フェアリースフィア), Fearī Sufia?), an impenetrable shield that suspends time for those inside the spell for seven years, which she uses to protect her guild from Acnologia on Sirius Island.[ch. 255] Eventually, Mavis is released from Zero's curse.[ch. 451]Mavis's background was included in the very first concepts of the series.[vol. 31:bonus] Mashima originally designed the character to be male, but changed it upon being informed that "Mavis" was a female name.[citation needed] He also expanded her role in the story from what he initially planned due to the character's "immense popularity", remarking that he had "no idea" she would become so popular.[vol. 32:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, her voice actress is Mamiko Noto.[14] In its English dub, her voice is provided by Leah Clark.Precht Gaebolg (プレヒト・ゲイボルグ, Purehito Geiborugu?, named after the poet Bertolt Brecht[vol. 27:afterword]), better known as Hades (ハデス, Hadesu?), is the master of Grimoire Heart.[ch. 214] As the second master and co-founder of Fairy Tail, he embarks on a quest to uncover the singular source of magic power, leaving the guild under Makarov Dreyar's leadership. Upon tracing the source back to Zeref, he becomes obsessed with obtaining this singularity for himself and organizes Grimoire Heart, assuming that he must awaken Zeref's dormant power to achieve his goal.[ch. 215, 249] Hades practices powerful dark spells such as Grimoire Law (悪魔の法律(グリモアロウ), Gurimoa Rō?, Japanese text translates as "Devil's Law"), a dark spell that counteracts Makarov's Fairy Law;[ch. 214] and the Devil's Eye (悪魔の眼, Akuma no Me?) which, when opened, gives him access to even greater dark powers developed by Zeref.[ch. 246, 247] His signature magic allows him to produce chains from his hands to grapple and throw opponents.[ch. 214] Using a mechanical "heart" on board his guild's airship, Hades is able to overpower Fairy Tail's attacks until the heart is destroyed by Happy and Carla.[ch. 248] He is spared by Makarov and retreats from his later defeat, only to be killed by Zeref for summoning Acnologia through his actions.[ch. 250] Seven years later, Hades's soul is later absorbed by the demon Franmalth of Tartaros, who uses the dark wizard's magic against Natsu Dragneel and Lucy Heartfilia. Upon Franmalth's defeat, Hades's soul is freed and forewarns Fairy Tail of Tartaros' motives before vanishing. In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced at first by Masashi Hirose, later Yutaka Aoyama. In its English dub, his voice is provided by John Swasey.The son of the guild's co-founder Yuri Dreyar (ユーリー・ドレアー, Yūrī Dorea), Makarov Dreyar (マカロフ・ドレアー, Makarofu Doreā?) is the 88-year-old third and incumbent master of Fairy Tail. Mashima came up with his name because he wanted it to sound Russian.[vol. 2:afterword] He is a diminutive man registered as one of the Ten Wizard Saints, who are recognized by the Magic Council for possessing magical power and skill higher than any wizard on the continent.[ch. 47] He has knowledge of numerous forms of magic, with his specialty being the ability to vastly increase his size using the magic Giant (巨人(ジャイアント), Jaianto).[ch. 28] His most powerful spell is Fairy Law (妖精の法律(フェアリーロウ), Fearī Rō), one of the Three Great Fairy Magics developed and utilized by his guild, which produces a brilliant light that only harms those the caster considers to be an enemy.[ch. 66] He is a grandfatherly figure in his guild, and looks upon its members as his own children. However, he is beleaguered by the problems his guild causes between him and the council.[ch. 2] A running gag throughout the series is his inability to choose a successor as guild master and retire; he eventually promotes Gildarts Clive to guild master to formally replace Macao Conbolt, but is reinstated as sixth master upon Gildarts's sudden resignation. After Fairy Tail's battle with Tartaros and Acnologia, Makarov disestablishes the guild to allow its members to follow their own dreams, and, after Fairy Tail is reestablished, is succeeded by Erza Scarlet.[ch. 416] In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Shinpachi Tsuji; in its English dub, his voice is supplied by R.

During the series, Natsu Dragneel, Gray Fullbuster, Juvia Lockser, Elfman Strauss, Cana Alberona, Fried Justine, Levy McGarden, and Mest Gryder are nominated as candidates for the guild's S-Class promotion exam.

Mirajane's variety of this magic, Satan Soul (サタンソウル, Satan Sōru?), grants her the ability to transform into various demons and access their destructive powers.[ch. 118]. As a child, her ability earns her hometown's resentment against her and her siblings. Mirajane joins Fairy Tail soon after, gaining infamy as the "Demon Woman" (魔人, Majin?) and a fierce rivalry with Erza Scarlet.[vol. 15:omake] As she is 17, Mirajane soon loses her Takeover powers and retires from active missions after her sister Lisanna's assumed death,[ch. 54] but retains the ability to mimic others' physical appearances and voices.[ch. 52] Eventually, Mirajane regains her Satan Soul transformation to save her brother Elfman during the Battle of Fairy Tail, and begins taking field missions more frequently afterward.Mashima named Mirajane after an online game he was playing while creating her character.[16] She and Lucy Heartfilia host the "Emergency Request!

After he is defeated by Natsu Dragneel and Gajeel Redfox, Makarov expels him for endangering his guildmates, although he leaves on friendlier terms with them.[ch. 125-128] He attempts to make things right with Fairy Tail by battling Hades on Sirius Island, and is reinstated into the guild by Gildarts Clive during the latter's brief period as guild master.[ch. 244, 260] The character's name is derived from the word "lux", a unit of measurement for light.[vol. 27:afterword] Laxus is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in the Japanese anime television series, and by Patrick Seitz in its English dub.[7][17]The daughter of Gildarts Clive, six-year-old wizard Cana Alberona (カナ・アルベローナ, Kana Aruberōna?) begins to search for Gildarts after her mother's death.

However, his lack of magic skill limits his transformations to his right arm using the Beast Arm (ビーストアーム, Bīsuto Āmu?) ability.[vol. 15:omake] His first attempt at achieving a full-body takeover at the age of sixteen causes him to go berserk and seemingly kill Lisanna in the process.

Disguising himself as Mystogan's disciple, Mest participates in the guild's S-Class qualification trial on Sirius Island with Wendy Marvell as his partner.[ch. 202] After Grimoire Heart is defeated by Fairy Tail, Mest eventually becomes sympathetic towards the guild, and is distraught at being unable to save them from Acnologia.[ch. 223, 248] Seven years later, Mest escapes Tartaros's bombing of the Council as one of the few survivors, and releases the Oración Seis from prison in exchange for information on Tartaros, which he uses to assist Fairy Tail.

"technique style/ceremony"),[vol. 13:translation notes] barriers formed by magic runes that cannot be passed unless those trapped inside follow what is written.[ch. 108] He also uses the magic Dark Écriture (闇の文字(エクリテュール), Yami no Ekurityūru, French for "Dark Writing") to write runes on others' bodies with his rapier to inflict pain and suffering,[ch. 117] or on his own body to create wings and transform himself into a demon.[ch. 118] He is characterized by his idolization of Laxus, and initially distances himself from the rest of his guild. He imposes the rules of the Battle of Fairy Tail with his Jutsu-Shiki,[ch. 108] and reluctantly carries out Laxus's orders to kill their guildmates, which causes him to question Laxus's morality.[ch. 114] After being overpowered by Mirajane Strauss's reawakened Satan Soul form, Fried temporarily shaves his long hair as a form of atonement for his misdeeds.[ch. 118, 129] Freed's name is derivet d from the Japanese phrase "Furui-zo" (古いぞ, lit.

Lummy (ラミー, Ramī?), a bunny girl demon, is responsible for resurrecting demons killed in battle and transforming human recruits into demons, including Ziemma and his daughter Minerva Orland.Aided by the Magic Council's treacherous chairman Crawford Theme, Tartaros assassinates most of the council's members to detonate the cross-continental Face bombs and neutralize Fiore's magic, thereby allowing E.N.D.'s resurrection. Their operation is interrupted by Acnologia, which brings the dragon slayers' guardians out of hiding to combat him, destroying the Faces in the process. Meanwhile, Mard Geer is defeated by Natsu Dragneel and Gray Fullbuster, with Zeref briefly arriving afterward to kill him for his failure and retrieve E.N.D.'s book.Raven Tail (大鴉の尻尾(レイヴンテイル), Reivun Teiru?, Japanese text translates as "Great Raven's Tail") is a dark guild that acts independently from the Balam Alliance,[ch. 131] and becomes an official guild shortly after Fairy Tail's return from Sirius Island.[ch. 267] The guild is led by Ivan Dreyar (イワン・ドレアー, Iwan Doreā?), Makarov's son and Laxus's father,[ch. 128] who is expelled from Fairy Tail six years earlier.[ch. 119] Ivan bitterly seeks Lumen Histoire, which he considers to be the guild's "darkness".[ch. 286] Disguising himself as an armored wizard named Alexei (アレクセイ, Arekusei?), Ivan leads a five-wizard team in the Grand Magic Games consisting of himself; Obra (オーブラ, Ōbura?), an imp who operates a humanoid puppet and drains wizards of their magic;[ch. 272] Flare Corona (フレア・コロナ, Furea Korona?), a young woman with prehensile red hair that can transform and ignite;[ch. 271] Kurohebi (クロヘビ?, lit.

Its two strongest members are August (オーガスト, Ōgasuto?), an elderly wizard with a purported mastery of all magic in Earth-land, and his alleged equal Irene Belserion (アイリーン・ベルセリオン, Airīn Beruserion?), a woman who has an unknown connection to Erza.

Fiore (ヒスイ・E・フィオーレ, Hisui Ī Fiōre, hisui (翡翠) meaning jade), a green-haired woman who is referred to as the princess by the subjects. Hisui also serves as the secret organizer of the Eclipse Project (エクリプス計画, Ekuripusu Keikaku?), a plan that entails using the black magic gate Eclipse to travel back in time and kill Zeref in his mortal state.[ch. 302] Participating in the plan are Arcadios (アルカディオス, Arukadiosu), who captains the kingdom's Cherry Blossom Holy Knights and publicly masquerades as the project's leader to protect Hisui; and defense minister Darton (ダートン, Dāton?), an elderly man who opposes the plan for its ramifications on the timeline. Also in the kingdom's service are the Hungry Wolf Knights (餓狼騎士団, Garō Kishidan), a unit of wizards who sentence prisoners trapped in the city's labyrinthine dungeon to death; the knights, along with Hisui, were submitted by readers as part of a character design contest.[citation needed]The Magic Council (魔法評議院, Mahō Hyōgiin?) is an organization that administers the legal guilds in Fiore.[ch. 2] Initially chaired by Crawford Theme (クロフォード・シーム, Kurofōdo Shīmu), the council's members have little tolerance for Fairy Tail's property-damaging tactics, despite the guild's role in handling criminals and monsters that threaten the peace.[ch. 1] Members of the council includes Jellal Fernandez (as Siegrain) and Ultear Milkovich, two of its younger members.[ch. 1] Another councilor, Yajima (ヤジマ?), is Makarov Dreyar's longtime friend who speaks in Fairy Tail's defense.[ch. 69] Other members include Org (オーグ, Ōgu), Michello (ミケロ, Mikero), Leiji (レイジ, Reiji), and Belno (ベルノ, Beruno). Jellal and Ultear trick the council into helping them activate the Tower of Heaven using the superweapon Etherion (エーテリオン, Ēterion), also called the Satellite Square (衛星魔法陣(サテライトスクエア), Sateraito Sukuea, Japanese text translates as "Satellite Magic Square"),[ch. 79] which fires a beam of immense magic energy that is absorbed by the tower.[ch. 97] The council is dissolved in disgrace,[ch. 131] and is later reformed under chairman Gran Doma (グラン・ドマ, Guran Doma, also "Grand Doma") to institute a tighter regime over the guilds.[ch. 200] Members of the reformed council include Lahar (ラハール, Rahāru),[ch. 223] an officer who commands one of the Rune Knights' custody units,[ch. 162] and Mest Gryder, a member of the council's intelligence unit under the name "Doranbalt".[ch. 223] Eventually, after Fairy Tail wins the Grand Magic Games, Crawford betrays the council and informs Tartaros of Face (フェイス, Feisu), a pulse bomb designed to eliminate magic in Fiore, also called the White Inheritance (白き遺産, Shiroki Isan?).[ch. 363] Tartaros assassinates most of the incumbent and retired councilors, three of whom serve as Face's unwitting wards, with Crawford killed after replacing Jellal as the last required seal. The eight open spots are filled by eight of the Ten Wizard Saints, excluding Makarov and God Serena and the position of chairman is occupied by Hyberion (ハイベリオン, Haiberion). Gajeel Redfox, Panther Lily, and Levy McGarden also enlist in the council's custody unit, but they, along with Mest, retire from the service when Fairy Tail is reorganized.Blue Pegasus (青い天馬(ブルーペガサス), Burū Pegasasu?) is one of Fiore's official guilds which mostly consists of attractive men and women.[ch. 139] The guild's master is Bob (ボブ, Bobu?), a cross-dressing man.[ch. 15] Karen Lilica (カレン・リリカ, Karen Ririka?), Loke's first owner, is killed by Angel.[ch. 73] Blue Pegasus forms an alliance with Fairy Tail, represented by its ace member and black sheep, Ichiya Vandalay Kotobuki (一夜＝ヴァンダレイ＝寿, Ichiya-Vandarei-Kotobuki?), a stout, ugly man who uses magical perfumes that produce a variety of effects such as superhuman strength and speed.[ch. 139, 161, 276] He is joined by the Tri-men (トライメンズ, Toraimenzu?, "Trimens"), a trio of host wizards who cater to women:[ch. 131] Hibiki Lates (ヒビキ・レイティス, Hibiki Reitisu?) uses magic resembling a computer terminal that can archive and telepathically transfer information to others;[ch. 139, 140] Eve Tearm (イヴ・ティルム, Ivu Tirumu?) can magically produce blizzards;[ch. 143] and Ren Akatsuki (レン・アカツキ?) is a tanned wizard who manipulates air.[ch. 142] Ichiya and the Tri-men participate in the Grand Magic Games alongside two other members: Jenny Realite (ジェニー・リアライト, Jenī Riaraito?), a fashion model who can magically transform into different outfits;[ch. 279] and Nichiya (ニチヤ?), an Exceed guard captain from Extalia and Ichiya's counterpart from Edolas.[ch. 293]Lamia Scale (蛇姫の鱗(ラミアスケイル), Ramia Sukeiru?, Japanese text translates as "Snake Princess's Scale") is one of Fiore's official guilds that allies with Fairy Tail against the Oración Seis.

She befriends Wendy Marvell, who joins Lamia Scale and partners with her after Fairy Tail disbands.Lyon Vastia (リオン・バスティア, Rion Basutia?) is Gray Fullbuster's rival and senior disciple under Ur. He practices Ice Make magic similar to Gray, using a variation that produces living ice golems that move on command. He initially uses a single-handed casting gesture that allows him to conjure ice faster, but makes it weaker and imbalanced.[ch. 30] Lyon resents Gray for Ur's sacrifice against the demon Deliora, ruining his childhood dream of surpassing their teacher.[ch. 38] Gaining infamy as "Reitei" (零帝?, "Sub-zero Emperor"), Lyon brings Deliora to Galuna Island and gathers followers to release the demon by using the ceremonial spell Moon Drip (月の雫(ムーンドリップ), Mūn Dorippu?), intending to prove his superiority over Ur.[ch. 29] Upon Deliora's release, however, Lyon discovers that the monster has already died, and decides to move on by joining the Lamia Scale guild.[ch. 43, 46] He eventually becomes a member of Lamia Scale, fighting alongside Fairy Tail against the Oración Seis.[ch. 132] He also adopts the two-handed casting gesture Ur and Gray use, as well as Gray's stripping habit.[ch. 139] After the missing Fairy Tail members return from Sirius Island seven years later, Lyon humorously falls in love at first sight with Juvia Lockser, forming a love triangle with her and Gray;[ch. 256] he later concedes her feelings for Gray after the latter is killed and resurrected by Ultear Milkovich during the second Dragon King Festival.[ch. 335, 338] In the Japanese anime television series, Lyon is voiced by Yūki Kaji.[17] In the English dub, his name is spelled "Lyon Bastia" and his voice is supplied by Jerry Jewell.[7]Saber Tooth (剣咬の虎(セイバートゥース), Seibā Tūsu?, Japanese text translates as "Saber-Toothed Tiger") is a guild that replaces Fairy Tail as the most powerful guild in Fiore during Sirius Island's disappearance.[ch. 258] The guild's master is Ziemma (ジエンマ, Jienma), a large man who is a strength supremacist.[ch. 281] Ziemma recruits five powerful wizards that lead their guild to become the strongest in Fiore: his daughter Minerva Orland; the Twin Dragons (双竜, Sōryū) team formed by Sting Eucliffe and Rogue Cheney, third generation dragon slayers who are raised by dragons and given lacrima implants;[ch. 265] Olga Nanagia (オルガ・ナナギア, Oruga Nanagia),[ch. 273] a god slayer who produces black lightning similar to Laxus Dreyar; and Rufus Lore (ルーファス・ロア, Rūfasu Roa), a man who uses Memory Make (記憶造形(メモリーメイク), Memorī Meiku, Japanese text translates as "Memory-Molding") to create new spells based on those he memorizes.[ch. 270] Eventually, after the Grand Magic Games, Sting replaces Ziemma as its guild master.Sting Eucliffe (スティング・ユークリフ, Sutingu Yūkurifu?), also called "White Dragon" Sting (白竜のスティング, Hakuryū no Sutingu), is a 19-year-old dragon slayer from Saber Tooth, and one of the Twin Dragons alongside Rogue Cheney.[ch. 258] He performs White Dragon Slayer Magic (白の滅竜魔法, Haku no Metsuryū Mahō), which gives him the ability to produce attacks of sacred light and fire laser beams from his mouth. He is also able to activate Dragon Force at will.[ch. 294, 295] He uses this magic to kill his dragon guardian, Weisslogia (バイスロギア, Baisurogia), at the dragon's behest to prove himself a "true" dragon slayer;[ch. 265] Weisslogia later appears alive with the other dragon slayers' guardians, explaining that Sting had been given false memories of killing him to provide Sting with experience.[ch. 415] To fulfill a vow to his Exceed friend Lector (レクター, Rekutā), Sting aims to defeat Natsu Dragneel and prove to others that he killed a dragon.[ch. 295] Representing his guild in the Grand Magic Games, he antagonizes Natsu in the hopes of provoking his true strength.[ch. 265] Eventually, during their two-on-two fight alongside Rogue and Gajeel Redfox, Sting is defeated by Natsu and gains new respect for Fairy Tail,[ch. 296] replacing Ziemma as Saber Tooth's master to improve his guild's image. In the Japanese anime television series, his voice actor is Takahiro Sakurai, while he is voiced by Michael Jones in the English dub.Rogue Cheney (ローグ・チェーニ, Rōgu Chēni?) is a 19-year-old dragon slayer and Sting Eucliffe's partner.[ch. 258] His Shadow Dragon Slayer Magic (影の滅竜魔法, Kage no Metsuryū Mahō) techniques include turning himself into a shadow to become intangible and firing shadows from his mouth.[ch. 294, 296] Like Sting, Rogue can activate Dragon Force at will, and has false memories of killing his own dragon guardian, Skiadram (スキアドラム, Sukiadoramu). He is accompanied by Frosch (フロッシュ, Furosshu), a green Exceed who wears a pink frog costume.[ch. 258] Before joining Saber, Rogue is Gajeel Redfox's disciple named Lios (ライオス, Raiosu) during the latter's membership in Phantom Lord. After gaining infamy as "Shadow Dragon" Rogue (影竜のローグ, Eiryū no Rōgu), Rogue decides to battle Gajeel to learn why he would join Fairy Tail. When Rogue loses to Gajeel in the Grand Magic Games seven years later, he acknowledges that Saber lacks the camaraderie Fairy Tail has, and joins Sting in improving his own guild. During the tournament, a version of Rogue appears through the time travel gate Eclipse from an alternate future, corrupted by his inner evil after Frosch is killed by Gray Fullbuster in his timeline. "Future" Rogue combines his shadow magic with Sting's White Dragon Slayer Magic forcibly acquired after killing him in the future.[ch. 325] He tricks Hisui E. Fiore by advising her to use the time travel gate Eclipse as a weapon to save the kingdom from a dragon invasion,[ch. 323] setting the gate to allow seven dragons from the historical Dragon King Festival to appear in the present and use against Acnologia. While Rogue's present self helps fight the dragons, Future Rogue's battle with Natsu Dragneel ends with Eclipse being destroyed and returning Rogue and the dragons to their original time periods, but not before Rogue helps Natsu avert his own future by warning him of Frosch's fate.

Vowing to exact revenge on Erza, Minerva leaves Saber Tooth and joins Succubus Eye (夢魔の眼(サキュバス・アイ), Sakyubasu Ai), a dark guild controlled by Tartaros.[ch. 343] Her strength is quickly recognized by Tartaros, who recruit and transform her into a demon alongside Ziemma, renaming her Neo-Minerva (ネオミネルバ, Neo Mineruba).[ch. 354, 370, 379] After Tartaros falls apart, Minerva grows tired of her rivalry with Erza. With nowhere else to go, Minerva is retrieved by Sting Eucliffe and Rogue Cheney, who reinstates her into Saber Tooth as a human.[ch. 388, 416] The Territory (絶対領土(テリトリー), Teritorī, Japanese text translates as "Absolute Territory") magic grants her the ability to use spatial manipulation to teleport objects and attack anything in her field of vision.[ch. 321] She also practices the Magics of the Yakuma Eighteen Battle Gods (ヤクマ十八闘神魔法, Yakuma Jūhachi Tōjin Mahō), a set of highly destructive spells.[ch. 312] She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue in the Japanese anime television series.

The guild's stated goal is to root out Zeref and suppress anyone who attempts to use his power for evil, and acts under the Magic Council's radar. It initially consists of its three founding members—Jellal Fernandez, Ultear Milkovich, and Merudy—as a means of atoning for their lifelong misdeeds.[ch. 263] After Ultear's departure, the guild recruits Brain's followers from the Oración Seis as members.[ch. 339, 416]Forced to work in the Tower of Heaven as a slave by a cult of Zeref worshipers who aim to revive the black wizard, Jellal Fernandes (ジェラール・フェルナンデス, Jerāru Ferunandesu?) befriends the eleven-year-old Erza Scarlet.

In the original Japanese series, Jellal is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa.[6] In the English dub, his voice is supplied by Robert McCollum.[7]During her early childhood, Ultear Milkovich (ウルティア・ミルコビッチ, Urutia Mirukobitchi?, named after "Ur's tear") is taken to a magic research facility by her mother Ur. She is subjected to unethical experiments and assumes that Ur has abandoned her, unaware of Ur thinking that her daughter has died.[ch. 46, 241] Ultear joins forces with Grimoire Heart to modify her magic with Zeref's power to travel to the past and exact revenge on Ur.[ch. 240] Ultear eventually gains infamy as the leader of the guild's Seven Kin of Purgatory and adopts Merudy. As part of Grimoire Heart's plan, she manipulates Jellal Fernandez into becoming the dark wizard's servant, feigning loyalty to him as a member of the Magic Council.[ch. 46] Later, Ultear and Merudy capture Zeref on Sirius Island, and the two attempt to flee with the dark wizard.[ch. 239] Eventually, Ultear realizes her misunderstanding of her mother while dueling with Gray Fullbuster, prompting her to help Fairy Tail defeat her master Hades and leave Grimoire Heart with Merudy.[ch. 241, 248, 250] Seven years later, when Rogue Cheney's future self uses Eclipse to orchestrate a dragon attack, Ultear contemplates killing the present Rogue. However, she casts the forbidden time spell Last Ages (ラストエイジス, Rasuto Eijisu), which reverses time and allows her allies to foresee the dragons' moves within this critical time frame, preventing the deaths of several wizards.[ch. 333-335] The spell also rapidly ages Ultear to that of an elderly woman, and she leaves Jellal and Merudy to assume that she is killed in the attack.[ch. 339] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro.[17] In the English dub, her voice is supplied by Lydia Mackay.[7]Adopted and raised by Ultear Milkovich as a survivor of her hometown's destruction, Merudy (メルディ, Merudi?) becomes one of Grimoire Heart's Seven Kin of Purgatory.[ch. 230] She uses the Lost Magic Magilty Sense (マギルティ＝センス, Magiruti-Sensu) to synchronize the physical senses and emotions of two or more people,[ch. 229, 230] and the spell Magilty Sodom (マギルティ＝ソドム, Magiruti-Sodomu) to produce blades of light that directly affect their target's sense of pain.[ch. 225] She participates in her guild's hunt for Fairy Tail's members on Sirius Island, prioritizing Gray Fullbuster as her foremost target, whom she blames for hurting Ultear through Ur's death.[ch. 228] After dueling Juvia Lockser to a stalemate, Merudy threatens suicide to kill Gray through her sensory link, but Juvia convinces her to live for Ultear's sake.[ch. 230] Merudy later realizes Ultear's role in her hometown's destruction from her guildmate Zancrow,[ch. 242] but saves Ultear from attempting suicide. Wanting to live together in happiness, Merudy leaves Grimoire Heart with Ultear.[ch. 250]Mashima designed Merudy to be the weakest of the Seven Kin, and was surprised to find the character had become "extremely popular" amongst the series's younger readers.[vol. 26:afterword] He commented that the character's name "just sort of came to [him]"; he later realized that it was the same as a character from "an old RPG [he] used to play".[vol. 27:bonus] In the Japanese anime television series, her voice actress is Saori Gotō.[22] In its English dub, her name is changed to "Meldy" and she is voiced by Bryn Apprill.Celestial spirits (星霊, seirei?) are beings that are contracted by celestial wizards to be summoned from another world using enchanted keys called Gate keys to battle and perform other tasks. They are governed by an all-powerful spirit called the Celestial Spirit King (星霊王, Seireiō?), and are each named after and based on one of the 88 modern constellations. They are immortal and possess various magic powers and abilities, but lose their power when they remain outside their realm for extended periods of time, which is fatal to them.[ch. 72-74]The more common spirits are summoned using store-bought silver keys.[ch. 4] Nikora (ニコラ?) is a common breed of spirit kept by celestial wizards as pets;[ch. 4] Lucy keeps a Nikora spirit that she names Plue (プルー, Purū?), who is identical to the character of the same name from Hiro Mashima's earlier work, Rave Master.[vol. 1:afterword] Horologium (ホロロギウム, Hororogiumu?) is an anthropomorphic grandfather clock who is summoned to use for transportation, shelter,[ch. 3] and defense from dangerous environments.[ch. 244] Lyra (リラ, Rira?), a cheery girl who carries a lyre, has the power to strengthen the emotions of those who hear her songs.[ch. 28] Crux (クルックス, Kurukkusu?), an elderly spirit with a large, cross-shaped head, holds encyclopedic knowledge about celestial spirits and their owners, which he obtains by sleeping.[ch. 72] Caelum (カエルム, Kaerumu?) is a mechanical sphere that can transform into a cannon or sword to be wielded by its summoner.[ch. 144] Pyxis (ピクシス, Pikushisu?) is a penguin with a large compass on its head, which allows it to provide directional references.[ch. 266]There are twelve golden Gatekeys that summon spirits of the Twelve Gates of the Zodiac (黄道十二門, Ōdō Jūnin-mon?), which are based on the zodiacal constellations.[ch. 4] These spirits are more powerful than the others, and require their master to use a large amount of magic energy to summon.[ch. 143] They are led by Leo, the true form of Loke. Aquarius (アクエリアス, Akueriasu?) is a foul-tempered mermaid who uses an urn that unleashes massive torrents of water on her target.[ch. 1] Taurus (タウロス, Taurosu?) is a perverted, minotaur-like humanoid who wields a giant double-edged battle axe and has superhuman strength.[ch. 4] Cancer (キャンサー, Kyansā?) is a humanoid hairdresser with six crab legs protruding from his back, and wields a pair of scissors.[ch. 8] Virgo (バルゴ, Varugo?), a masochistic woman dressed like a maid, rapidly burrows underground and manipulate earth.[ch. 17] Sagittarius (サジタリウス, Sajitariusu?) is a tall man who wears a horse costume and possesses superb archery skills.[ch. 62] Aries (アリエス, Aries?), a timid young woman with sheep horns who wears a wool coat, conjures wool clouds that subdue her opponents.[ch. 172] Gemini (ジェミニ, Jemini?) are small twin spirits who mimic the appearances and abilities of others,[ch. 133] and can also read their minds.[ch. 143] Scorpio (スコーピオン, Sukōpion?) is a man with a scorpion tail-shaped cannon that produces sandstorms.[ch. 172] Capricorn (カプリコーン, Kapurikōn?) is an anthropomorphic goat who dresses like a butler.[ch. 248] Pisces (ピスケス, Pisukesu?) are a mother and son pair of giant fish who attack their opponent in tandem,[ch. 280] and can take on human form.[ch. 310] Libra (ライブラ, Raibura?), a thinly-dressed woman, is able to manipulate gravity using a pair of weighing scales.[ch. 280] Another spirit called Ophiuchus (オフィウクス, Ofiukusu?), which takes the form of a giant mechanical snake, is considered the "thirteenth" zodiac spirit and surpasses the other twelve in power.[ch. 280]Edolas (エドラス, Edorasu?) is a parallel universe that exists separately from Earth-land, the universe in which Fairy Tail takes place. It is inhabited by counterparts of Earth-land's residents, each with opposite personalities or traits such as age and species.[ch. 170, 176] It is also the home of several characters in the series, including Jellal Fernandez's counterpart Mystogan, and Exceed such as Happy and Carla. As opposed to Earth-land, magic is a limited resource in Edolas and cannot be used as a natural ability by humans, who instead use items combined with magic-infused lacrima crystals;[ch. 172] the Earth-land wizards are similarly only able to perform magic in Edolas after taking pills provided by Mystogan for this purpose.[ch. 180]The kingdom is ruled by Faust (ファウスト, Fausuto), Mystogan's father,[ch. 190] who replenishes his world's magic using inter-dimensional anima (アニマ?) portals that absorb and crystallize magic power from Earth-land as lacrima.[ch. 169] A version of Fairy Tail exists in Edolas as a dark guild due to Faust's abolishment of wizard guilds; among its members are Natsu Dragyon (ナツ・ドラギオン, Natsu Doragion?), Natsu Dragneel's timid counterpart and the guild's vehicle expert;[ch. 174] Lucy Ashley (ルーシィ・アシュレイ, Rūshii Ashurei), a boyish and intimidating version of Lucy Heartfilia; Gray Sorloge (グレイ・ソルージュ, Gurei Sorūju), a version of Gray Fullbuster who wears multiple layers of clothing and harbors unrequited feelings for Juvia Lockser's counterpart; and a teenage version of Wendy Marvell.[ch. 170] They are hunted by Edolas's royal military commanded by Panther Lily; Erza Nightwalker (エルザ・ナイトウォーカー, Eruza Naitowōkā), Erza Scarlet's ruthless counterpart who wields a transforming spear based on Haru Glory's Ten Commandments sword from Rave Master;[ch. 180] Hughes (ヒューズ, Hyūzu), who controls Faust's indoor amusement park attractions with a baton;[ch. 182] Sugar Boy (シュガーボーイ, Shugā Bōi), whose sword can turn anything into liquid;[ch. 182] Byro (バイロ, Bairo), the elderly chief of staff who carries various magical potions;[ch. 184] and Coco (ココ, Koko?), Byro's young barefoot aide.[ch. 171]Following the defeat of Oración Seis, Magnolia's residents are absorbed through anima and turned into a giant lacrima, which Faust intends to ram into the Exceed kingdom of Extalia to bestow a limitless supply of magic on his kingdom. He extracts the dragon slayers' magic to power a chain cannon to achieve this,[ch. 180] later piloting the dragon-shaped mecha Doroma Anim (ドロマ・アニム, Doroma Animu?) to battle the dragon slayers.[ch. 190] After Faust's defeat, Mystogan restores Magnolia and reverses the anima's effects to return Earth-land's stolen magic, permanently depleting Edolas's supply.[ch. 198]The Exceed (エクシード, Ekushīdo?) are a race of catlike beings from Edolas ruled by Chagot (シャゴット, Shagotto); they reside on a floating island called Extalia (エクスタリア, Ekusutaria). They are the only residents of Edolas capable of possessing magic as a natural ability, which they use to produce wings and fly with the spell Aera. Because of this, they are seen as angels by the humans of Edolas and Chagot is revered as a god who passes judgment on humans.[ch. 176] Most of the Exceed population resent humans, casting out any Exceed who sympathize with them or ignore their queen's orders.[ch. 185] Despite this, they are actually a weak race with a history of being abused by humans, and their divinity is a ruse devised by Chagot's court to protect their people and bolster their self-confidence.[ch. 188] Before their birth, Happy and Carla's eggs are sent to Earth-land along with 98 other unborn Exceed under the pretense of hunting and killing dragon slayers.[ch. 176] This is later revealed to be another ruse created to prevent a panic over the plan's true purpose: to ensure their race's survival after Chagot foresees Extalia's eventual destruction caused by Edolas's loss of magic.[ch. 198] The entire Exceed race is transported to Earth-land after Mystogan reverses Edolas's anima and, realizing their mistake in judging humans, decide to live in harmony with them and search for the 100 missing Exceed children.[ch. 197-198]Igneel (イグニール, Igunīru?), the Fire Dragon King (炎竜王, Enryūō?), is a dragon and Natsu Dragneel's adoptive father. He raises Natsu from infancy, teaching him language, culture, and the ability to use Fire Dragon Slayer Magic.[ch. 2] When Natsu witnesses Igneel's disappearance on July 7, X777, he begins a search for the dragon.[ch. 1, 66] His search results in him encountering several other dragon slayers who have similarly lost their own dragon guardians on the same date. Fourteen years later, when Acnologia arrives at the battle between Fairy Tail and Tartaros, Igneel is revealed to have magically sealed himself inside Natsu's body all along,[ch. 400] as are the other dragons with their respective children, for the triple purpose of preventing them from turning into dragons as a side effect of their Dragon Slayer Magic, waiting to personally eliminate Acnologia after the dragon slayers are fully inoculated,[ch. 414] and prolonging their own lives due to having lost their souls to Acnologia.[ch. 415] However, Igneel is brutally killed by Acnologia and ascends back to a higher plane of existence with his fellow dragons to watch over mankind. He also passed down the "Blaze Dragon King Mode" to Natsu Dragneel after his death.[ch. 414, 415] His voice actor in the Japanese anime television series is Hidekatsu Shibata. In its English dub, he is voiced at first by Bob Magruder, later by Jim White.[23]Ur (ウル, Uru?) is Ultear Milkovich's mother and the teacher of Gray Fullbuster and Lyon Vastia. She is a renowned Ice Make wizard whose power is stated as being worthy of the Ten Wizard Saints'.[ch. 46] Before meeting Gray and Lyon, Ur brings her sickly daughter to a magic research facility to save her life as a child, only to later be told that Ultear has died while the doctors perform unethical experiments on her in secret.[ch. 241] She then takes on Lyon and Gray as her pupils in an effort to move on. When Gray attempts to kill the Etherious Deliora, Ur sacrifices herself to save him by performing the forbidden spell Iced Shell (絶対氷結(アイスドシェル), Aisudo Sheru?, Japanese text translates as "Absolute Freeze"), transforming her body into ice to permanently freeze the demon. She remains alive in this form until Lyon melts her with the Moon Drip spell to release Deliora, essentially killing her as she drifts out to sea as water. Later, Ultear falls into the sea while dueling Gray, causing her to experience her mother's memories and realize the truth of what transpired at the research facility, having assumed that Ur had abandoned her there.[ch. 241] Ur is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the Japanese anime television series, and by Kira Vincent-Davis in its English dub.A wealthy business tycoon and president of the esteemed Heartfilia Konzern, Jude Heartfilia (ジュード・ハートフィリア, Jūdo Hātofiria?) is Lucy Heartfilia's father. As with Lucy, his name is based on the Beatles song "Hey Jude".[24] Jude's relationship with his daughter is strained due to Layla's death, which eventually leads to Lucy running away from home.[ch. 50] Years later, he recruits Phantom Lord to bring her home for a business opportunity. However, his actions inadvertently involve Fairy Tail in a guild war to protect her, which results in Lucy breaking ties with her father.[ch. 67] Shortly afterward, Jude becomes bankrupt and loses his estate, and takes up work at a merchant's guild, mending his relationship with Lucy.[ch. 130] He dies towards the end of Lucy's seven-year disappearance, but demonstrates his love and faith in his daughter's well-being by leaving her seven years worth of rent money and birthday gifts.[ch. 258] He is voiced by Banjō Ginga. In the English dub, his voice is supplied by Bill Jenkins.The human counterpart of Grandeeney from Edolas, Porlyusica (ポーリュシカ, Pōryushika?, also "Poluchka") is Fairy Tail's elderly medicinal advisor who lives in the forest on the outskirts of Magnolia, able to remedy all sorts of ailments and injuries. She resents humans and often chases visitors out of her house unless they are in need of her aid.[ch. 51] She is a longtime friend of Makarov Dreyar, whom she nurses to health when he is drained of his magic, and later when he falls deathly ill during Laxus Dreyar's rebellion. Seven years following Sirius Island's disappearance, she meets Wendy Marvell and gives instructions for advanced Sky Dragon Slayer Magic spells relayed to her by Grandeeney, having failed to teach them to Wendy before her disappearance.[ch. 260] In the original Japanese series, her voice actress is Shōko Tsuda.[9] In the English dub, she is voiced by Linda Young.[10]The characters of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles as having a "strong 'bite me' vibe" and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda.[25] In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style "is a kick".[26] In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not to get caught up in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance."[27] Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk, in his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, mentions the "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters".[28] Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about that will probably depend upon which character you prefer." Silverman also thought that readers "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [in chapters 162 through 164]." However, she said that "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," and pointed out that "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad."[29]Entire seriesIndividual volumesLoading...Loading...Loading...Loading...Working...Loading...Loading...Loading...Loading...THIS VIDEO BASICALLY COVERS MY OPINION ON WHO ACTUALLY IS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN FAIRY TAIL.

KidoFor Hiro Mashima, making manga is his true calling. Just from reading his bestselling epic about the world of wizards, Fairy Tail, you can sense how devoted he is to his work. Meeting him in person, you encounter more to his personality that explains how he can make such a manga. He’s a forever-humble student of life as well as a big-hearted teacher, fascinated by the making of manga more than anybody. This perfect balance is the ultimate drive that keeps him working on a long-running—and sometimes even multiple—manga series.This interview is for old and new fans of Fairy Tail, who wants to know a little more about the personal side of Mashima-sensei!About Hiro Mashima Born in 1977 and debuted as a manga-ka (manga artist) in 1998. His first long-running series, Rave Master, ran in Weekly Shonen Magazine from 1999 to 2005. He serialized his current series, Fairy Tail, in the same magazine since 2006. When Fairy Tail was adapted as an anime series in 2009, it became a global hit. Other renowned works includes Monster Hunter Orage, Monster Soul, and Mashima-en.List of Awards 2009 Fairy Tail: Kodansha Manga Award/Shonen Genre (Japan) 2009 Fairy Tail: Japan Expo Best Manga Award/Shonen Genre (France) 2011 Fairy Tail: ANIMELAND Best Anime Award (France) 2011 Fairy Tail: ANIMELAND Best Dubbed Anime Award (France) 2011 Fairy Tail: Frankfurt Book Fair/International Comics Award (Germany) 2012 Fairy Tail: Salon del Manga Best Series Award (Spain) 2012 Fairy Tail: Salon del Manga Best Creator Award (Spain) 2012 Fairy Tail: Salon del Manga Best Guest of Honor Award (Spain)“I love and am fascinated by the whole process of making manga.” —Hiro MashimaKodansha Comics (KC): What was it like when you were a kid? Hiro Mashima (HM): When I was little, I was an indoor kid. I always loved doing something at home. Of course I liked to play outside with friends too, but I enjoyed drawing or playing video games, doing something that takes imagination at home.KC: When did you pick up drawing? HM: I’ve been drawing as long as I can remember. I have an early memory of my grandfather showing me a manga magazine that he picked up somewhere. I thought the drawings in it was so cool, so I tried to copy it. That’s probably when I realized that I love to draw. And I still love to draw!KC: Story or art; which one comes more naturally to you? HM: That’s a tough one. They are both really fun. When I make a story, I’m rolling out my imagination to figure out what’s going to happen, and that’s really fun. When I draw, I go through a lot of trial and error to get something to look cool or cute. That’s also fun. I love and am fascinated by the whole process of making manga.KC: Do you think about anything particular when you draw? HM: I’m actually not very good at drawing female characters. I want to draw them so cute I feel a lot of pressure drawing them. In contrast, guy characters are easy. I can just draw them quickly.KC: How did you come up with the world of Fairy Tail? HM: It actually goes back to the series I worked on before, Rave Master. In one episode, there was a scene where a group of guys are hanging out at a bar. That was fun to draw. So I wanted to draw a manga with the feel of guys hanging out at a bar. I thought it’d be interesting to enter a world where characters have established relationships, like friendship. Usually a shonen manga starts with just a main character, who then slowly accumulates his or her allies as the story progresses. But in the world of Fairy Tail, everybody pretty much knows each other at the beginning. That was sort of what I was going for.KC: Is it difficult to work with a story that’s set in a fantasy world with things like magic? HM: It’s not hard, because in a world with magic, you can pretty much do anything! It’s actually harder for me to work on a story that’s set in real life, because there are a lot of restrictions. For example, in a real-life setting, in order to walk into a room, you have to open the door. But in a fantasy setting, you can enter the room however you want. Literally anything goes.KC: How would you describe the main characters of Fairy Tail? HM: They are real trouble. [laughs] At first I was trying to make the characters people I want to be friends with. But from anyone else’s eyes, they’re serious troublemakers. They won’t listen to anyone. Still, I want them to be people to look up to to for kids who read the manga.KC: Do you feel like there’s some resemblance of yourself to the characters? HM: I do. I think every character that I come up with is somehow a reflection of myself. Sometimes I’m fiery like Natsu, sometimes I’m serious like Lucy, take off my clothes like Gray … or not. [laughs]KC: How do you keep your motivation for work? HM: I try to have fun every now and then. I take a lot of breaks and do something else for a change. Also, I’m sure every creator feels this way, but the readers’ voices that I receive from fan letters are very encouraging to me. It makes me want to keep making manga that people can enjoy.KC: Do you have a certain audience in mind when you make manga? HM: I try to make manga that’s fun for teenagers, but I also want it to be interesting enough for adults too.KC: I’ve heard that Miki Yoshikawa (creator of Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches) was your assistant back in the day. What was it like to work with her?HM: Miki Yoshikawa always had a great imagination. For example, whenever I ask an assistant to draw a background in a panel, I’ll usually give some specific direction of what I’m thinking. But every time she drew something for me, it’d always surpass my expectation. She’d add tiny little details in the scene—even something simple like a duck in the background—that I didn’t ask for. She did this constantly. She was still pretty young back then, so she knew her art still needed some work. But I don’t really remember teaching her anything, because she already had what it takes. I think we spent most of the time doing fun stuff, like playing video games together. Although, I always hoped that she’d start her own manga series someday.KC: How many assistants do you work with now? HM: Recently we’ve lost one person, so there are three assistants now. It’s tough not having a full team.KC: Do you like to use digital or analog tools for drawing? HM: Most of my manga is drawn by hand. But sometimes I do try to play around with illustration programs like Photoshop and ComicStudio. Even then, I try to make it look like it was drawn and colored by hand. I try to avoid using any effects that are only possible by digital tools. My favorite tool is still Copic pens though. But it’s a very hard medium to work with, and there are people who are better at it than me. I know the limits of my own ability, so I try to make the best of it.KC: Have you been playing any video games recently? HM: Yes I have. I’ve been playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. I don’t know why they have to release it when I’m so busy! [laughs]KC: What’s your zodiac sign? HM: I’m a Taurus! Actually, there’s a character names Taurus in Fairy Tail. So I wanted to make sure he’s super-powerful.KC: If a new person wants to get into reading Fairy Tail now, how would you recommend they dive into the series? HM: I think the best way to get into Fairy Tail is to find your own favorite character. I try to make every character to be unique, so they may appeal to different kinds of people.KC: Do you have any comments for fans? HM: I feel so happy people outside of Japan read and know about Fairy Tail. When I’m on Twitter, I get comments from fans all around the world. That’s really encouraging. I don’t understand other languages too well, but sometimes I try to read and write in English. Or sometimes I try to post some art, because language doesn’t matter. It’s one of the ways to give back to the fans. I hope you guys will continue to enjoy and support Fairy Tail!KC: Thank you!Want to watch Mashima-sensei in action?

The series primarily takes place in the Kingdom of Fiore, a country located in the fictional universe Earth-land, where several of its residents are able to perform various forms of magic. Those who practice magic as a profession, referred to as wizards (魔導士, madōshi?),[vol. 2:translation notes] join guilds where they share information and perform paid jobs for clients. The series' storyline follows a group of wizards from the rambunctious titular guild.The main characters of the series include Natsu Dragneel, a wizard with the powers of a dragonslayer who is searching for his adoptive dragon father Igneel, and Lucy Heartfilia, a celestial wizard who joins the Fairy Tail guild. During the early part of the series, they form a team with Happy, a flying cat and best friend of Natsu; Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a knight who specializes in using various magic weapons and armors. Over the course of the series, Lucy and Natsu interact with and befriend other wizards and guilds in Fiore. They also encounter various antagonists from illegal "dark" guilds, and Zeref, an ancient wizard who is sought out by several of the series' villains.When creating the series, Mashima was influenced by Akira Toriyama, J.R.R. Tolkien and Yudetamago and based the guild on a local bar. He also used people as references in designing other characters. The characters have been well-received overall.When Hiro Mashima was creating Fairy Tail, he cited Akira Toriyama, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Yudetamago as influences in his works.[1][2] Mashima based the titular guild on a local bar he was visiting at the time.[3] He based Natsu Dragneel on his early years as a junior high school student.[2] Mashima based Natsu's motionsickness on one of his friends, who gets sick when taking taxis together, and he also cited his father's death as an influence for the relationship between Natsu and the dragon Igneel.[1]When Funimation Entertainment acquired the license to dub Fairy Tail in North America, Mashima was worried about actor Todd Haberkorn voicing Natsu since he had a lot of yelling in the series.[4] Tyler Walker, the voice director for Funimation's adaptation, revealed that a "Fairy Tail tea" was made to accommodate the voice actors after each recording session.[4]Fairy Tail (妖精の尻尾(フェアリーテイル), Fearī Teiru?) is the series's titular wizard's guild, stationed in the fictional city of Magnolia, where the series's main characters gather to perform paid jobs with their magical abilities. It is considered to be one of the most famous and popular guilds for much of the series. However, its members are infamous for being rambunctious and causing extensive collateral damage during missions. For this reason, the guild is seen as a nuisance by the Magic Council despite the guild members' heroic deeds.[ch. 1, 2] Currently the position of guild master, who is the leader of Fairy Tail, is occupied by Makarov Dreyar.Mashima has insisted that the spelling of the guild's name, which is a play on the phrase "fairy tale", is intentional.[citation needed] In the story, the guild's name comes from the question of whether or not fairies, which are considered as mythical creatures within the series, have tails, which poses "an eternal mystery and, therefore, eternal adventure".[ch. 63] Tyler Walker likens Fairy Tail to the Scooby-Doo franchise: "it's got a core group of characters, with one talking animal, sometimes two...they travel, it's episodic...you know, we've seen this kind of thing before with the core group that's affiliated in some way going through adventure after adventure."[5]Natsu Dragneel (ナツ・ドラグニル, Natsu Doraguniru?) is the main protagonist of the Fairy Tail series. As the younger brother of Zeref Dragneel, he is revived from the dead as an Etherious (エーテリアス, Ēteriasu) demon known as "Etherious Natsu Dragneel" (E.N.D.), the master of the most strongest dark guild Tartaros.[ch. 416, 436] At some point during his youth, his brother, Zeref Dragneel turns him over to Igneel. He is adopted and raised by the King of Fire Dragons Igneel, who trains him as a dragon slayer (滅竜魔導士(ドラゴンスレイヤー), doragon sureiyā?, Japanese text translates as "dragon-slaying wizard"), a wizard with dragon-like physiology whose magic is designed to combat other dragons and is the only known magic who can kill dragons. As the Fire dragon slayer, Natsu is immune to flames and capable of consuming them to fuel his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic (火の滅竜魔法, Hi no Metsurū Mahō?) attacks, which include breathing fire and igniting any part of his body to strike with. However, he also suffers from motion sickness when riding a vehicle of any sort.[ch. 1] He eventually learns to use Dragon Force (ドラゴンフォース, Doragon Fōsu?), an advanced form of dragon slayer magic that boosts his strength and speed, and covers parts of his body in scales and Dragon King Magic which is an advanced form of Dragon Slayer Magic.

His search leads him to join Fairy Tail at a young age, gaining infamy as "Salamander" (火竜(サラマンダー), Saramandā?, Japanese text translates as "Fire Dragon") and one of the guild's most loyal yet reckless members who causes most of the collateral damage his guild is blamed for.[ch. 2] He is the first friend Lucy Heartfilia makes on her journey. Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Igneel from being killed by the Evil Dragon Acnologia, Natsu and Happy spend one-year training by themselves before reuniting with Lucy. During this time, he had mastered Dragon King Magic and a mode called "Blaze Dragon King Mode" which was strong enough to bring Zeref to his knees. The character is named after the Japanese word for "summer" (夏, natsu?) to follow up on the main character of Hiro Mashima's previous work Rave Master being named Haru, which means "spring".[vol. 2:afterword] Natsu is voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara. In the English dub, his voice is provided by Todd Haberkorn.[6][7]Happy (ハッピー, Happī?) is a 6-year-old anthropomorphic cat with blue fur.

He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura.[6] In Funimation's English dub, his voice is supplied by Newton Pittman.[7]Erza Scarlet (エルザ・スカーレット, Eruza Sukāretto?) is a 19-year-old swordswoman with prominent red hair. While a slave girl of the Tower of Heaven at the age of eleven, Erza befriends other slaves her age, including Jellal Fernandez. Erza rallies the slaves in a mass breakout to save Jellal from being tortured, causing her to lose an eye in the process. However, Jellal is brainwashed into serving Zeref and betrays her to continue the tower's construction.[ch. 80-82] Having thus gained the requip (換装, kansō?) technique, she can use "The Knight" (騎士(ザ・ナイト), Za Naito?) magic, which allows her to summon and exchange various weapons and armors that enhance her abilities. She also gains an artificial eye that grants her immunity to illusions and optical magics.[ch. 111, 155] Eventually, Erza becomes Fairy Tail's disciplinarian as well as one of the guild's S-Class wizards and becomes infamously known under the name of "Titania" (妖精女王(ティターニア), Titānia?, Japanese text translates as "Fairy Queen").[ch. 10, 89] However, Erza grows fond of her guildmates after Natsu Dragneel defeats Jellal and rescues her.[ch. 104] Erza later helps Jellal atone for his misdeeds after he is restored to his old self,[ch. 146] which inspires him to organize Crime Sorcière seven years later.[ch. 263] One year later, after Makarov Dreyar's disappearance, Erza temporarily replaces him as the guild's seventh master.[ch. 438]The character is named after Eru from Mashima's one-shot manga that served as a pilot for Fairy Tail.[vol. 2:bonus] Mashima initially designed her to only shed tears from one eye due to a defect with her artificial eye, but Mashima eventually abandoned this aspect after accidentally drawing some scenes where Erza has tears flowing from both eyes.[vol. 12:afterword] He also said that he often forgets what Erza's armor looks like, and changes the design every time she appears.[vol. 18:afterword] Her voice actress in the Japanese anime television series is Sayaka Ohara.[8] In its English dub, her voice is provided by Colleen Clinkenbeard.[7]Adopted and raised by an iron dragon named Metalicana (メタリカーナ, Metarikāna?), Gajeel Redfox (ガジル・レッドフォックス, Gajiru Reddofokkusu?) has to witness his disappearance around the same time as Igneel's disappearance.[ch. 66] At some point after Metalicana's disappearance, Gajeel joins Phantom Lord, gaining infamy as "Kurogane" Gajeel (鉄竜(くろがね)のガジル, Kurogane no Gajiru?, "Black Steel" Gajeel, Japanese text translates as "Iron Dragon"). His attack on Levy McGarden's team and destruction of Fairy Tail's guildhall results in war.[ch. 48] After Phantom Lord is defeated by Fairy Tail, Gajeel joins the latter, eventually proving his loyalty to the guild.[ch. 105, 212] He also comes to good terms with Levy after defending her from Laxus Dreyar before the Battle of Fairy Tail,[ch. 106] and later partners with her for the S-Class wizard test on Sirius Island.[ch. 202]. Eventually, Gajeel becomes incognito as a captain of the Magic Council arrest and custody division alongside Panther Lily and Levy. After Avatar is defeated by Fairy Tail, Gajeel leaves the Magic Council and rejoins Fairy Tail. Later in the series, Gajeel admits he has romantic feelings for Levy. Gajeel's Iron Dragon Slayer Magic (鉄の滅竜魔法, Tetsu no Metsuryū Mahō?) allows him to transform parts of his body into iron weapons such as clubs and swords, cover his body with nearly indestructible steel scales, and breathe gusts of wind containing metal shards capable of shredding a person's body. He can also consume iron objects for nourishment. He later on gains the Iron Shadow Dragon Mode by eating Rogue Cheney's Shadow Dragon Slayer Magic.

During childhood, she is called a "rain woman" due to the downpours she has caused.[ch. 48] Her involvement in the guilds' war over Lucy Heartfilia results in her falling in love at first sight with Gray Fullbuster, and mistakes Lucy for a rival in love. She duels with Gray, but loses and the rain around her stops for the first time in her life.[ch. 56-57] After her guild is defeated by Fairy Tail, Juvia joins the latter in pursuit of becoming closer to Gray, and she considers anyone he interacts with to be a romantic rival.[ch. 256] Eventually, Juvia becomes more cheerful and changes her appearance several times to suit her new personality, although her feelings for Gray remain unrequited even though Gray develops his feelings for her.[ch. 438] Her name is derived from the Spanish word lluvia, meaning "rain". In the Japanese anime television series, Juvia is voiced by Mai Nakahara.[9] In the English dub, her name is spelled "Juvia Loxar" and she is voiced by Brina Palencia.[10]Wendy Marvell (ウェンディ・マーベル, Wendi Māberu?), is a 12-year-old female dragon slayer.[ch. 144] Adopted by the sky dragon Grandine (グランディーネ, Gurandīne?, also "Grandine"), Wendy practices Sky Dragon Slayer Magic (天空の滅竜魔法, Tenkū no Metsuryū Mahō?), a form of healing magic taught by her foster mother.

She becomes a representative of the guild in an alliance with Fairy Tail, Blue Pegasus, and Lamia Scale against the Oración Seis.[ch. 132] During the guilds' mission, the Seis force her to resurrect Jellal Fernandes, whom she mistakes for Mystogan, her childhood traveling partner from after Grandeeney's disappearance.[ch. 145, 167] Once the Seis are defeated, Wendy discovers Cait Shelter's true nature as an illusion created by their master, the elderly spirit Robaul (ローバウル, Rōbauru?), to care for her; she is then left to join Fairy Tail after her old guild vanishes.[ch. 164] Wendy gradually uses her magic in battle, including the ability to breathe and conjure powerful gusts of wind, and to augment her allies' speed, strength, and defensive power. She looks up to Natsu Dragneel as a brother and joins him in his search for the missing dragons.[ch. 161, 191]Mashima created Wendy after one of his staff members commented that young girls "just don't appear" in the series, and noted the character's popularity among his associates.[vol. 16:afterword] Her original concept was that of a "Water Dragon" based on the Japanese name for Wednesday (水曜日, Suiyōbi?, lit. "Water Day"), which Mashima named her after.[vol. 27:bonus] She is voiced by Satomi Satō.[11] In the English dub, her voice is supplied by Brittney Karbowski.[12]Carla, named Charles (シャルル, Sharuru?) in the Japanese version,[vol. 27:afterword] is a six-year-old, white-furred Exceed, and Wendy Marvell's partner and guardian.[ch. 133, 145] As an egg, she is evacuated to Earth-land along with Happy and 98 other unborn Exceed when her mother, the Exceed queen Chagot, has a premonition of their realm's destruction, with the objective concealed as a mission to kill dragon slayers to prevent a panic. Upon being hatched by Wendy, Carla's precognition powers inherited from Chagot allows her to see visions of future events and misinterprets Chagot's ruse as her real mission, but the Exceed decides to protect Wendy.[ch. 135, 198] Six years later, after defeating the Oración Seis, she joins Fairy Tail.[ch. 165] Upon meeting Happy, Carla is annoyed with his obliviousness to their mission but only reconsiders after Happy ignores the Exceeds' orders and Chagot reveals the truth.[ch. 133, 169, 177, 198]Mashima named the character "Charles" after a princess character in a book he once read; she was renamed "Carla" in various countries where "Charles" would be interpreted as a male name.[vol. 27:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Yui Horie and her name is spelled "Charle" in Funimation's subtitles.[11] In Funimation's English dub, her voice is supplied by Jād Saxton.[12]Panther Lily (パンサー・リリー, Pansā Rirī?) is a black-furred Exceed born and raised in Edolas.

As opposed to most Exceed, Lily has a large, humanoid body resembling an anthropomorphic panther. Using the magic sword Buster Marm (バスターマァム, Basutā Māmu?), it can extend up to four times his size;[ch. 186][vol. 22:bonus] after this sword is destroyed, he replaces it with the similar Musica Sword (ムジカの剣, Mujika no Ken).[ch. 247] He duels Gajeel Redfox while defending the lacrima crystal created from the residents of Magnolia as part of Faust's plan to exterminate the Exceed with it, but has a change of heart after seeing the Exceed gather to push the crystal away alongside Fairy Tail.[ch. 189] After being sent to Earth-land through the reversed anima portal, he joins Fairy Tail as Gajeel's partner.[ch. 198] In Earth-land, Lily's body shrinks to his species's typical small size, though he is able to assume his original form for limited periods of time in addition to his Aera ability.[ch. 200]Lily's name is a play on "a famous character from a certain fairy tale".[vol. 27:bonus] Mashima commented on the character's popularity, saying, "I guess he's more popular now that he's small? Yeah."[vol. 32:afterword] His voice actor in the Japanese anime television series is Hiroki Tōchi.[13] In the English dub, his name is written as "Pantherlily" and he is voiced by Rick Keeling.Mavis Vermillion (メイビス・ヴァーミリオン, Meibisu Vāmirion?) is the founder and first guild master of Fairy Tail. Raised by an elderly guild master named Zeeself, Mavis becomes barefoot when she has her shoes taken away.[ch. 3] At the age of 13, Mavis founds her own guild, Fairy Tail, gaining notoriety as the "Fairy Strategist" (妖精軍師, Yōsei Gunshi?).[ch. 203, 255] Befriending a wandering Zeref Dragneel, Mavis is inadvertently afflicted with the same curse as him, rendering her ageless and immortal, and killing everything around her. When she and Zeref fall in love after she asks for his help removing the curse, he unwittingly sends her into a deathlike sleep.[ch. 450] Her body is preserved in crystal beneath Fairy Tail's guildhall, where it produces a source of limitless magic known as Fairy Heart (妖精の心臓(フェアリーハート), Fearī Hāto?), codenamed Lumen Histoire (ルーメン・イストワール, Rūmen Isutowāru?, "History of Light").[ch. 451] Her successor Precht Gaebolg keeps this a secret by building a false grave on Sirius Island.[ch. 203] Mavis appears before her guild as a disembodied spirit that can only be seen and heard by those with Fairy Tail's emblem.[ch. 268] A barefoot young girl, Mavis is also a child prodigy with vast military and illusory skill, and has knowledge of two of the Three Great Fairy Magics (妖精三大魔法, Yōsei San Dai Mahō?), a trinity of spells that can only be used by members of her guild:[ch. 233] Fairy Glitter (妖精の輝き(フェアリーグリッター), Fearī Gurittā?), an attack that eradicates any enemy;[ch. 232] and Fairy Sphere (妖精の球(フェアリースフィア), Fearī Sufia?), an impenetrable shield that suspends time for those inside the spell for seven years, which she uses to protect her guild from Acnologia on Sirius Island.[ch. 255] Eventually, Mavis is released from Zero's curse.[ch. 451]Mavis's background was included in the very first concepts of the series.[vol. 31:bonus] Mashima originally designed the character to be male, but changed it upon being informed that "Mavis" was a female name.[citation needed] He also expanded her role in the story from what he initially planned due to the character's "immense popularity", remarking that he had "no idea" she would become so popular.[vol. 32:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, her voice actress is Mamiko Noto.[14] In its English dub, her voice is provided by Leah Clark.Precht Gaebolg (プレヒト・ゲイボルグ, Purehito Geiborugu?, named after the poet Bertolt Brecht[vol. 27:afterword]), better known as Hades (ハデス, Hadesu?), is the master of Grimoire Heart.[ch. 214] As the second master and co-founder of Fairy Tail, he embarks on a quest to uncover the singular source of magic power, leaving the guild under Makarov Dreyar's leadership. Upon tracing the source back to Zeref, he becomes obsessed with obtaining this singularity for himself and organizes Grimoire Heart, assuming that he must awaken Zeref's dormant power to achieve his goal.[ch. 215, 249] Hades practices powerful dark spells such as Grimoire Law (悪魔の法律(グリモアロウ), Gurimoa Rō?, Japanese text translates as "Devil's Law"), a dark spell that counteracts Makarov's Fairy Law;[ch. 214] and the Devil's Eye (悪魔の眼, Akuma no Me?) which, when opened, gives him access to even greater dark powers developed by Zeref.[ch. 246, 247] His signature magic allows him to produce chains from his hands to grapple and throw opponents.[ch. 214] Using a mechanical "heart" on board his guild's airship, Hades is able to overpower Fairy Tail's attacks until the heart is destroyed by Happy and Carla.[ch. 248] He is spared by Makarov and retreats from his later defeat, only to be killed by Zeref for summoning Acnologia through his actions.[ch. 250] Seven years later, Hades's soul is later absorbed by the demon Franmalth of Tartaros, who uses the dark wizard's magic against Natsu Dragneel and Lucy Heartfilia. Upon Franmalth's defeat, Hades's soul is freed and forewarns Fairy Tail of Tartaros' motives before vanishing. In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced at first by Masashi Hirose, later Yutaka Aoyama. In its English dub, his voice is provided by John Swasey.The son of the guild's co-founder Yuri Dreyar (ユーリー・ドレアー, Yūrī Dorea), Makarov Dreyar (マカロフ・ドレアー, Makarofu Doreā?) is the 88-year-old third and incumbent master of Fairy Tail. Mashima came up with his name because he wanted it to sound Russian.[vol. 2:afterword] He is a diminutive man registered as one of the Ten Wizard Saints, who are recognized by the Magic Council for possessing magical power and skill higher than any wizard on the continent.[ch. 47] He has knowledge of numerous forms of magic, with his specialty being the ability to vastly increase his size using the magic Giant (巨人(ジャイアント), Jaianto).[ch. 28] His most powerful spell is Fairy Law (妖精の法律(フェアリーロウ), Fearī Rō), one of the Three Great Fairy Magics developed and utilized by his guild, which produces a brilliant light that only harms those the caster considers to be an enemy.[ch. 66] He is a grandfatherly figure in his guild, and looks upon its members as his own children. However, he is beleaguered by the problems his guild causes between him and the council.[ch. 2] A running gag throughout the series is his inability to choose a successor as guild master and retire; he eventually promotes Gildarts Clive to guild master to formally replace Macao Conbolt, but is reinstated as sixth master upon Gildarts's sudden resignation. After Fairy Tail's battle with Tartaros and Acnologia, Makarov disestablishes the guild to allow its members to follow their own dreams, and, after Fairy Tail is reestablished, is succeeded by Erza Scarlet.[ch. 416] In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Shinpachi Tsuji; in its English dub, his voice is supplied by R.

During the series, Natsu Dragneel, Gray Fullbuster, Juvia Lockser, Elfman Strauss, Cana Alberona, Fried Justine, Levy McGarden, and Mest Gryder are nominated as candidates for the guild's S-Class promotion exam. However, the exam is canceled before its completion following the interference of Zeref and Grimoire Heart as well as the discovery that Mest is a spy from the Magic Council.Mirajane Strauss (ミラジェーン・ストラウス, Mirajēn Sutorausu?), is a 19-year-old S-Class wizard who works as a barmaid and administrator at Fairy Tail, and as a cover girl for the fictional magazine Sorcerer Weekly.[ch. 2] She is depicted as a bubbly, kindhearted, and absentminded young woman who rarely displays anger towards others.[ch. 25] She is the oldest of three siblings who use the magic Takeover (接収(テイクオーバー), Teikuōbā?) to transform into creatures they have previously encountered. Mirajane's variety of this magic, Satan Soul (サタンソウル, Satan Sōru?), grants her the ability to transform into various demons and access their destructive powers.[ch. 118]. As a child, her ability earns her hometown's resentment against her and her siblings. Mirajane joins Fairy Tail soon after, gaining infamy as the "Demon Woman" (魔人, Majin?) and a fierce rivalry with Erza Scarlet.[vol. 15:omake] As she is 17, Mirajane soon loses her Takeover powers and retires from active missions after her sister Lisanna's assumed death,[ch. 54] but retains the ability to mimic others' physical appearances and voices.[ch. 52] Eventually, Mirajane regains her Satan Soul transformation to save her brother Elfman during the Battle of Fairy Tail, and begins taking field missions more frequently afterward.Mashima named Mirajane after an online game he was playing while creating her character.[16] She and Lucy Heartfilia host the "Emergency Request!

In the Japanese anime television series, Mirajane is voiced by Ryōko Ono.[6] In its English dub, she is voiced by Monica Rial.[7]Mystogan (ミストガン, Misutogan?) is Jellal Fernandes's duplicate originating from the parallel universe of Edolas, of which he is its prince.[ch. 167, 189] He arrives to Earth-land to close inter-dimensional anima portals used by Faust, his father and Edolas's king, to siphon magic energy from Earth-land. At some point during his stay, he joins Fairy Tail as an S-Class Wizard, gaining notoriety as one of Fairy Tail's most powerful members.[ch. 65] Eventually, after failing to prevent Magnolia from being absorbed by anima,[ch. 168] he returns to Edolas and restores the city by forcing the lacrima crystal formed from the trapped Fairy Tail wizards through another portal after his guildmates prevent Faust from ramming it into the Exceed kingdom.[ch. 189] He reverses the portals' effects to return all of Earth-land's stolen magic, intending to be sentenced to death for this by his childhood friend Panther Lily to quell the ensuing panic.[ch. 195] When Natsu Dragneel takes responsibility instead, Mystogan earns his people's support by defeating him in a mock battle, and remains in Edolas to replace his father as king.[ch. 197] Unable to use magic on his own, Mystogan uses staves infused with magic power to create illusions and draw magic circles to attack.[ch. 120] He is also capable of casting sleeping spells on his guildmates when he visits Fairy Tail.[ch. 24] In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa.[17] In the English dub, his voice is supplied by Robert McCollum.[7]The grandson of Makarov Dreyar, Laxus Dreyar (ラクサス・ドレアー, Rakusasu Doreā?) is heir to the position of guild master, and one of Fairy Tail's S-Class wizards.

He is also a second generation dragon slayer whose father, Ivan, implants a lacrima crystal within him as a child that enables him to use Lightning Dragon Slayer Magic (雷の滅竜魔法, Rai no Metsuryū Mahō?).[ch. 124, 128] During his youth, he begins to feel overshadowed by his grandfather and at the age of 17, Laxus rebels following his father's expulsion from the guild.[ch. 106, 119] Seven years later, Laxus has grown into a strength supremacist.[ch. 24] When Fairy Tail's reputation begins to falter following the war with Phantom Lord, Laxus organizes an intra-guild battle royal called the "Battle of Fairy Tail" in a bid to seize control of the guild from Makarov and reestablish its strength by rooting out the guild's "weaklings".[ch. 107] Enraged by his failures, Laxus casts Fairy Law to annihilate Magnolia, but his genuine love for his guild overrides the spell's effects. After he is defeated by Natsu Dragneel and Gajeel Redfox, Makarov expels him for endangering his guildmates, although he leaves on friendlier terms with them.[ch. 125-128] He attempts to make things right with Fairy Tail by battling Hades on Sirius Island, and is reinstated into the guild by Gildarts Clive during the latter's brief period as guild master.[ch. 244, 260] The character's name is derived from the word "lux", a unit of measurement for light.[vol. 27:afterword] Laxus is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in the Japanese anime television series, and by Patrick Seitz in its English dub.[7][17]The daughter of Gildarts Clive, six-year-old wizard Cana Alberona (カナ・アルベローナ, Kana Aruberōna?) begins to search for Gildarts after her mother's death. Unable to reveal her relationship to him due to his scarce presence and her own timidity, Cana resolves to become an S-Class wizard, but fails four qualification tests in a row and falls into depression.[ch. 232] She gains infamy as Fairy Tail's resident alcoholic who drinks entire barrels of liquor at a time as well as the most senior member of the guild from Lucy Heartfilia's generation.[ch. 2, 201] Twelve years later, during her fifth test on Sirius Island,[ch. 202] Cana abandons her guildmates to complete the trial of finding Mavis Vermillion's grave, unknowingly putting her test partner Lucy at risk of being killed by Grimoire Heart.[ch. 202, 225] Upon realizing her treacherous deed, Cana rejects her chance at S-Class wizardship in favor of saving her friends,[ch. 232] and eventually reveals herself to Gildarts as his daughter after the trial's cancellation.[ch. 251] Having mastered the ability to use magic cards (魔法の札(マジックカード), majikku kādo?), she can use them as a projectile weapon and to cast a variety of spells,[ch. 38] as well as to perform fortune-telling. Cana's name is derived from the tarot term "arcana".[16] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Eri Kitamura[6] In its English dub, her voice is supplied by Jamie Marchi.[6][7]Owned by a Blue Pegasus celestial wizard named Karen Lilica, Leo (レオ, Reo?), the lion Zodiac celestial spirit, has to remain in the human world to prevent his master from frequently abusing her other Zodiac spirit, Aries.

Mashima developed his name to sound "somewhat cute".[vol. 2:bonus] He is a burly, muscle-brained wizard who spouts nonsensical speeches about manhood,[ch. 2] but is also kindhearted and emotionally sensitive.[ch. 51] He employs the Takeover magic Beast Soul (獣王の魂(ビーストソウル), Bīsuto Sōru?, Japanese text translates as "Beast King's Soul") to steal the powers of any monster he encounters and assume its form. However, his lack of magic skill limits his transformations to his right arm using the Beast Arm (ビーストアーム, Bīsuto Āmu?) ability.[vol. 15:omake] His first attempt at achieving a full-body takeover at the age of sixteen causes him to go berserk and seemingly kill Lisanna in the process. Two years later, Fairy Tail's war with Phantom Lord causes Elfman to control his Beast Soul form and rescues Mirajane and defeat Sol.[ch. 56] In the Japanese anime television series, Elfman is voiced by Hiroki Yasumoto.[6] In the English dub, he is voiced by Christopher Sabat.[7]Lisanna Strauss (リサーナ・ストラウス, Risāna Sutorausu?) is Mirajane and Elfman's younger 17-year-old sister. Mashima came up with her name feeling that ending it with "-anna" would sound cute.[vol. 27:bonus] Having mastered the Animal Soul (動物の魂(アニマルソウル), Animaru Sōru?) variety of Takeover magic, she can shapeshift into different animals at will. She is also one of Natsu Dragneel's childhood friends who helps him hatch Happy's egg. She has feelings for Natsu Dragneel and wanted to get married to him when they were little.[vol. 15:omake] At the age of 15, she is seemingly killed by Elfman in his berserk full-body takeover form.[ch. 55] However, Lisanna is actually transported to Edolas and becomes incognito as a member of Edolas's version of Fairy Tail after being mistaken for her own deceased counterpart. Two years later, she is forced to return to Earth-land when Mystogan reverses Anima's effects, and reunites with her own siblings.[ch. 199] She goes on to participate in the S-Class qualification trial as Juvia Lockser's partner.[ch. 202] In the Japanese anime television series, Lisanna is voiced by Harumi Sakurai.[18] In Funimation's English dub, she is voiced by Carrie Savage.[10]Levy McGarden (レビィ・マグガーデン, Rebi Magugāden?) is a 17-year-old member of Shadow Gear (シャドウ・ギア, Shadō Gia?), a three-wizard team consisting of herself, Jet, and Droy.

She is also proficient in translating and decoding ancient languages and runic magic. She becomes close friends with Lucy Heartfilia over their shared love of books, and is the only person Lucy allows to read her novel.[ch. 48] When Levy and her team are wounded by Phantom Lord member Gajeel Redfox, a war between the two guilds erupts.[ch. 47] After Phantom Lord's defeat by Fairy Tail, Levy is frightened by Gajeel when he first joins Fairy Tail, but reconsiders after he defends her from Laxus Dreyar.[ch. 105] She eventually develops feelings for Gajeel after he offers to become her partner for the S-Class qualification trial.[ch. 202] Eventually, her participation in the Grand Magic Games and Fairy Tail's fight with Tartaros earn her a seat in the Magic Council's custody and arrest unit. Following Avatar's defeat, she retires from the service and rejoins Fairy Tail. Her voice actor in the original Japanese anime television series is Mariya Ise. In its English dub, she is voiced by Kristi Kang.[6][7]A wizard of Fairy Tail, Mest Gryder (メスト・グライダー, Mesuto Guraidā?) uses a memory alteration charm to erase his own memories of being in the guild to infiltrate the Magic Council for Fairy Tail's benefit, to Makarov Dreyar's disapproval.[ch. 213,416] He joins the Magic Council as an intelligence operative for the Council named Doranbalt (ドランバルト, Doranbaruto?, also "Doranbolt") and eventually re-infiltrates Fairy Tail to dig up dirt on the guild for his own interests.[ch. 213,223] In addition to his memory-altering spell, he is also capable of using the Direct Line (瞬間移動(ダイレクトライン), Dairekuto Rain?, Japanese text translates as "Teleportation") spell, which allows him to teleport himself to various locations at will. Disguising himself as Mystogan's disciple, Mest participates in the guild's S-Class qualification trial on Sirius Island with Wendy Marvell as his partner.[ch. 202] After Grimoire Heart is defeated by Fairy Tail, Mest eventually becomes sympathetic towards the guild, and is distraught at being unable to save them from Acnologia.[ch. 223, 248] Seven years later, Mest escapes Tartaros's bombing of the Council as one of the few survivors, and releases the Oración Seis from prison in exchange for information on Tartaros, which he uses to assist Fairy Tail. After the battle, he discovers his original identity, retires from the service and rejoins the guild.[ch. 438] In the anime television series, he is voiced by Shūhei Sakaguchi, while Alex Organ provides his voice in Funimation's English dub.The Raijin Tribe (雷神衆, Raijinshū?, "Thunder God Tribe"), renamed the "Thunder Legion" in Funimation's anime dub, is a trio of wizards who act as Laxus Dreyar's personal bodyguards and followers. They were created by Mashima after he "suddenly came up with" the series's story arc focusing on Laxus.[vol. 13:afterword] The three help carry out Laxus's plans to restructure the guild by participating in the Battle of Fairy Tail,[ch. 108] but become friendlier towards their guildmates after Laxus's expulsion.[ch. 128] Aside from their own unique abilities, the three members each share the ability to cast magic by making eye contact with their opponents.[ch. 115]Fried Justine (フリード・ジャスティーン, Furīdo Jasutīn?), spelled "Freed Justine" in Del Rey's manga translation and also called "Dark" Freed (暗黒のフリード, Ankoku no Furīdo), is the founder and leader of the Raijin Tribe.[ch. 106] He specializes in creating Jutsu-Shiki (術式, lit. "technique style/ceremony"),[vol. 13:translation notes] barriers formed by magic runes that cannot be passed unless those trapped inside follow what is written.[ch. 108] He also uses the magic Dark Écriture (闇の文字(エクリテュール), Yami no Ekurityūru, French for "Dark Writing") to write runes on others' bodies with his rapier to inflict pain and suffering,[ch. 117] or on his own body to create wings and transform himself into a demon.[ch. 118] He is characterized by his idolization of Laxus, and initially distances himself from the rest of his guild. He imposes the rules of the Battle of Fairy Tail with his Jutsu-Shiki,[ch. 108] and reluctantly carries out Laxus's orders to kill their guildmates, which causes him to question Laxus's morality.[ch. 114] After being overpowered by Mirajane Strauss's reawakened Satan Soul form, Fried temporarily shaves his long hair as a form of atonement for his misdeeds.[ch. 118, 129] Freed's name is derivet d from the Japanese phrase "Furui-zo" (古いぞ, lit. "It's old"), reflecting the character's initial concept of attacking with archaic words.[vol. 27:bonus] His name was originally going to be Albion (アルビオン, Arubion), but Mashima shortened it to balance out his teammates' longer names.[vol. 27:bonus] In the Japanese anime television series, Freed is voiced by Junichi Suwabe.[19] In the English dub, he is voiced by John Burgmeier.[20]Evergreen (エバーグリーン, Ebāgurīn?) is a 20-year-old wizard and a vain woman who is obsessed with fairies who joins Fairy Tail for the guild's name and covets Erza Scarlet's title of "Fairy Queen, Titania". At some point during her membership, she joins the Raijin Tribe as the sole female member.[ch. 107,112] Her primary magic is her Stone Eyes (石化眼(ストーンアイズ), Sutōn Aizu, Japanese text translates as "Petrifying Eyes"), with which she can petrify others through eye contact after removing her eyeglasses.[ch. 107] She can also produce golden dust to cause explosions as well as an endless barrage of needles.[ch. 112] She partners with Elfman Strauss after being passed over by Fried during the S-Class qualification trial, and gradually develops feelings for him. In the Japanese anime television series, her voice actress is Saori Seto.[19] Caitlin Glass provides her voice in its English dub.[20]Bickslow (ビックスロー, Bikkusurō?) is a 22-year-old wizard who practices seith magic (セイズ魔法, seizu mahō?) called Human Possession (人型憑, Hitotsuki?) to implant up to five wandering souls within inanimate objects and control them.[ch. 108] He refers to his puppets as his "babies" with the names Pappa (パッパ?), Pippi (ピッピ?), Puppu (プップ?), Peppe (ペッペ?), and Poppo (ポッポ?).[ch. 108] His eye magic is called Figure Eyes (造形眼(フィギュアアイズ), Figyua Aizu?, Japanese text translates as "Molding Eyes"), which allows him to take control of others' bodies through eye contact, wearing a grilled visor to contain this magic.[ch. 115] His name is a corruption of the words "big" and "throw".[vol. 27:bonus] Bickslow is voiced by Yoshihisa Kawahara.[19] In the English dub, his name is spelled "Bixlow" and is voiced at first by Scott Freeman, and later replaced by Tyler Walker.[20]In the beginning of the series, the Fairy Tail guild is stated to have over 100 members besides the main cast of characters.

However, he angers the god Ankhselam through his attempts to cheat death to revive his deceased younger brother, Natsu, cursing him with the Black Magic of Ankhselam (アンクセラムの黒魔術, Ankuseramu no Kuro Majutsu?).[ch. 356] Ankhselam's curse makes Zeref immortal and causes everything around him to die instantly so long as he cherishes life, which he slowly begins to renounce.[ch. 200, 250] Using Natsu's body, he successfully revives the child by turning him into the Etherious demon E.N.D.[ch. 436] At some point during his 400-year existence, Zeref gains notoriety as the Black Wizard (黒魔導士, Kuro Madōshi), creating many demons and befriending Mavis Vermillion.[ch. 250] Self-loathing because of his curse, Zeref wishes to die at the hands of Natsu. Eventually, after witnessing the atrocities committed by Grimoire Heart on Sirius Island, Zeref renounces all regard for human life and kills their master, Hades.[ch. 250] Seven years later, Zeref decides he must eliminate mankind to solve Earth-land's continuing conflicts.[ch. 340] While planning out the story, Mashima considered multiple identities and names for the character introduced in Chapter 200, who would later be revealed as the previously unseen character Zeref.[vol. 24:bonus] He intentionally avoided giving any hints to his identity beforehand, wanting it to be a "complete surprise" to the readers.[vol. 24:afterword] Mashima stated that Zeref "has really become a popular character" after the reveal; he also noted that the character is "really dark [...] He'd never make a silly face."[vol. 26:afterword] In the Japanese anime television series, his voice actor is Akira Ishida.[21] His voice in the English dub is supplied by Joel McDonald.Eisenwald (鉄の森(アイゼンヴァルト), Aizenvaruto?, German for "Iron Forest") is one of the dark guilds that is controlled by the Oración Seis.

The eight open spots are filled by eight of the Ten Wizard Saints, excluding Makarov and God Serena and the position of chairman is occupied by Hyberion (ハイベリオン, Haiberion). Gajeel Redfox, Panther Lily, and Levy McGarden also enlist in the council's custody unit, but they, along with Mest, retire from the service when Fairy Tail is reorganized.Blue Pegasus (青い天馬(ブルーペガサス), Burū Pegasasu?) is one of Fiore's official guilds which mostly consists of attractive men and women.[ch. 139] The guild's master is Bob (ボブ, Bobu?), a cross-dressing man.[ch. 15] Karen Lilica (カレン・リリカ, Karen Ririka?), Loke's first owner, is killed by Angel.[ch. 73] Blue Pegasus forms an alliance with Fairy Tail, represented by its ace member and black sheep, Ichiya Vandalay Kotobuki (一夜＝ヴァンダレイ＝寿, Ichiya-Vandarei-Kotobuki?), a stout, ugly man who uses magical perfumes that produce a variety of effects such as superhuman strength and speed.[ch. 139, 161, 276] He is joined by the Tri-men (トライメンズ, Toraimenzu?, "Trimens"), a trio of host wizards who cater to women:[ch. 131] Hibiki Lates (ヒビキ・レイティス, Hibiki Reitisu?) uses magic resembling a computer terminal that can archive and telepathically transfer information to others;[ch. 139, 140] Eve Tearm (イヴ・ティルム, Ivu Tirumu?) can magically produce blizzards;[ch. 143] and Ren Akatsuki (レン・アカツキ?) is a tanned wizard who manipulates air.[ch. 142] Ichiya and the Tri-men participate in the Grand Magic Games alongside two other members: Jenny Realite (ジェニー・リアライト, Jenī Riaraito?), a fashion model who can magically transform into different outfits;[ch. 279] and Nichiya (ニチヤ?), an Exceed guard captain from Extalia and Ichiya's counterpart from Edolas.[ch. 293]Lamia Scale (蛇姫の鱗(ラミアスケイル), Ramia Sukeiru?, Japanese text translates as "Snake Princess's Scale") is one of Fiore's official guilds that allies with Fairy Tail against the Oración Seis.

She befriends Wendy Marvell, who joins Lamia Scale and partners with her after Fairy Tail disbands.Lyon Vastia (リオン・バスティア, Rion Basutia?) is Gray Fullbuster's rival and senior disciple under Ur. He practices Ice Make magic similar to Gray, using a variation that produces living ice golems that move on command. He initially uses a single-handed casting gesture that allows him to conjure ice faster, but makes it weaker and imbalanced.[ch. 30] Lyon resents Gray for Ur's sacrifice against the demon Deliora, ruining his childhood dream of surpassing their teacher.[ch. 38] Gaining infamy as "Reitei" (零帝?, "Sub-zero Emperor"), Lyon brings Deliora to Galuna Island and gathers followers to release the demon by using the ceremonial spell Moon Drip (月の雫(ムーンドリップ), Mūn Dorippu?), intending to prove his superiority over Ur.[ch. 29] Upon Deliora's release, however, Lyon discovers that the monster has already died, and decides to move on by joining the Lamia Scale guild.[ch. 43, 46] He eventually becomes a member of Lamia Scale, fighting alongside Fairy Tail against the Oración Seis.[ch. 132] He also adopts the two-handed casting gesture Ur and Gray use, as well as Gray's stripping habit.[ch. 139] After the missing Fairy Tail members return from Sirius Island seven years later, Lyon humorously falls in love at first sight with Juvia Lockser, forming a love triangle with her and Gray;[ch. 256] he later concedes her feelings for Gray after the latter is killed and resurrected by Ultear Milkovich during the second Dragon King Festival.[ch. 335, 338] In the Japanese anime television series, Lyon is voiced by Yūki Kaji.[17] In the English dub, his name is spelled "Lyon Bastia" and his voice is supplied by Jerry Jewell.[7]Saber Tooth (剣咬の虎(セイバートゥース), Seibā Tūsu?, Japanese text translates as "Saber-Toothed Tiger") is a guild that replaces Fairy Tail as the most powerful guild in Fiore during Sirius Island's disappearance.[ch. 258] The guild's master is Ziemma (ジエンマ, Jienma), a large man who is a strength supremacist.[ch. 281] Ziemma recruits five powerful wizards that lead their guild to become the strongest in Fiore: his daughter Minerva Orland; the Twin Dragons (双竜, Sōryū) team formed by Sting Eucliffe and Rogue Cheney, third generation dragon slayers who are raised by dragons and given lacrima implants;[ch. 265] Olga Nanagia (オルガ・ナナギア, Oruga Nanagia),[ch. 273] a god slayer who produces black lightning similar to Laxus Dreyar; and Rufus Lore (ルーファス・ロア, Rūfasu Roa), a man who uses Memory Make (記憶造形(メモリーメイク), Memorī Meiku, Japanese text translates as "Memory-Molding") to create new spells based on those he memorizes.[ch. 270] Eventually, after the Grand Magic Games, Sting replaces Ziemma as its guild master.Sting Eucliffe (スティング・ユークリフ, Sutingu Yūkurifu?), also called "White Dragon" Sting (白竜のスティング, Hakuryū no Sutingu), is a 19-year-old dragon slayer from Saber Tooth, and one of the Twin Dragons alongside Rogue Cheney.[ch. 258] He performs White Dragon Slayer Magic (白の滅竜魔法, Haku no Metsuryū Mahō), which gives him the ability to produce attacks of sacred light and fire laser beams from his mouth. He is also able to activate Dragon Force at will.[ch. 294, 295] He uses this magic to kill his dragon guardian, Weisslogia (バイスロギア, Baisurogia), at the dragon's behest to prove himself a "true" dragon slayer;[ch. 265] Weisslogia later appears alive with the other dragon slayers' guardians, explaining that Sting had been given false memories of killing him to provide Sting with experience.[ch. 415] To fulfill a vow to his Exceed friend Lector (レクター, Rekutā), Sting aims to defeat Natsu Dragneel and prove to others that he killed a dragon.[ch. 295] Representing his guild in the Grand Magic Games, he antagonizes Natsu in the hopes of provoking his true strength.[ch. 265] Eventually, during their two-on-two fight alongside Rogue and Gajeel Redfox, Sting is defeated by Natsu and gains new respect for Fairy Tail,[ch. 296] replacing Ziemma as Saber Tooth's master to improve his guild's image. In the Japanese anime television series, his voice actor is Takahiro Sakurai, while he is voiced by Michael Jones in the English dub.Rogue Cheney (ローグ・チェーニ, Rōgu Chēni?) is a 19-year-old dragon slayer and Sting Eucliffe's partner.[ch. 258] His Shadow Dragon Slayer Magic (影の滅竜魔法, Kage no Metsuryū Mahō) techniques include turning himself into a shadow to become intangible and firing shadows from his mouth.[ch. 294, 296] Like Sting, Rogue can activate Dragon Force at will, and has false memories of killing his own dragon guardian, Skiadram (スキアドラム, Sukiadoramu).

After gaining infamy as "Shadow Dragon" Rogue (影竜のローグ, Eiryū no Rōgu), Rogue decides to battle Gajeel to learn why he would join Fairy Tail. When Rogue loses to Gajeel in the Grand Magic Games seven years later, he acknowledges that Saber lacks the camaraderie Fairy Tail has, and joins Sting in improving his own guild. During the tournament, a version of Rogue appears through the time travel gate Eclipse from an alternate future, corrupted by his inner evil after Frosch is killed by Gray Fullbuster in his timeline. "Future" Rogue combines his shadow magic with Sting's White Dragon Slayer Magic forcibly acquired after killing him in the future.[ch. 325] He tricks Hisui E. Fiore by advising her to use the time travel gate Eclipse as a weapon to save the kingdom from a dragon invasion,[ch. 323] setting the gate to allow seven dragons from the historical Dragon King Festival to appear in the present and use against Acnologia. While Rogue's present self helps fight the dragons, Future Rogue's battle with Natsu Dragneel ends with Eclipse being destroyed and returning Rogue and the dragons to their original time periods, but not before Rogue helps Natsu avert his own future by warning him of Frosch's fate.

With nowhere else to go, Minerva is retrieved by Sting Eucliffe and Rogue Cheney, who reinstates her into Saber Tooth as a human.[ch. 388, 416] The Territory (絶対領土(テリトリー), Teritorī, Japanese text translates as "Absolute Territory") magic grants her the ability to use spatial manipulation to teleport objects and attack anything in her field of vision.[ch. 321] She also practices the Magics of the Yakuma Eighteen Battle Gods (ヤクマ十八闘神魔法, Yakuma Jūhachi Tōjin Mahō), a set of highly destructive spells.[ch. 312] She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue in the Japanese anime television series.

The guild's stated goal is to root out Zeref and suppress anyone who attempts to use his power for evil, and acts under the Magic Council's radar. It initially consists of its three founding members—Jellal Fernandez, Ultear Milkovich, and Merudy—as a means of atoning for their lifelong misdeeds.[ch. 263] After Ultear's departure, the guild recruits Brain's followers from the Oración Seis as members.[ch. 339, 416]Forced to work in the Tower of Heaven as a slave by a cult of Zeref worshipers who aim to revive the black wizard, Jellal Fernandes (ジェラール・フェルナンデス, Jerāru Ferunandesu?) befriends the eleven-year-old Erza Scarlet.

In the original Japanese series, Jellal is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa.[6] In the English dub, his voice is supplied by Robert McCollum.[7]During her early childhood, Ultear Milkovich (ウルティア・ミルコビッチ, Urutia Mirukobitchi?, named after "Ur's tear") is taken to a magic research facility by her mother Ur.

However, she casts the forbidden time spell Last Ages (ラストエイジス, Rasuto Eijisu), which reverses time and allows her allies to foresee the dragons' moves within this critical time frame, preventing the deaths of several wizards.[ch. 333-335] The spell also rapidly ages Ultear to that of an elderly woman, and she leaves Jellal and Merudy to assume that she is killed in the attack.[ch. 339] In the Japanese anime television series, she is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro.[17] In the English dub, her voice is supplied by Lydia Mackay.[7]Adopted and raised by Ultear Milkovich as a survivor of her hometown's destruction, Merudy (メルディ, Merudi?) becomes one of Grimoire Heart's Seven Kin of Purgatory.[ch. 230] She uses the Lost Magic Magilty Sense (マギルティ＝センス, Magiruti-Sensu) to synchronize the physical senses and emotions of two or more people,[ch. 229, 230] and the spell Magilty Sodom (マギルティ＝ソドム, Magiruti-Sodomu) to produce blades of light that directly affect their target's sense of pain.[ch. 225] She participates in her guild's hunt for Fairy Tail's members on Sirius Island, prioritizing Gray Fullbuster as her foremost target, whom she blames for hurting Ultear through Ur's death.[ch. 228] After dueling Juvia Lockser to a stalemate, Merudy threatens suicide to kill Gray through her sensory link, but Juvia convinces her to live for Ultear's sake.[ch. 230] Merudy later realizes Ultear's role in her hometown's destruction from her guildmate Zancrow,[ch. 242] but saves Ultear from attempting suicide. Wanting to live together in happiness, Merudy leaves Grimoire Heart with Ultear.[ch. 250]Mashima designed Merudy to be the weakest of the Seven Kin, and was surprised to find the character had become "extremely popular" amongst the series's younger readers.[vol. 26:afterword] He commented that the character's name "just sort of came to [him]"; he later realized that it was the same as a character from "an old RPG [he] used to play".[vol. 27:bonus] In the Japanese anime television series, her voice actress is Saori Gotō.[22] In its English dub, her name is changed to "Meldy" and she is voiced by Bryn Apprill.Celestial spirits (星霊, seirei?) are beings that are contracted by celestial wizards to be summoned from another world using enchanted keys called Gate keys to battle and perform other tasks.

It is inhabited by counterparts of Earth-land's residents, each with opposite personalities or traits such as age and species.[ch. 170, 176] It is also the home of several characters in the series, including Jellal Fernandez's counterpart Mystogan, and Exceed such as Happy and Carla. As opposed to Earth-land, magic is a limited resource in Edolas and cannot be used as a natural ability by humans, who instead use items combined with magic-infused lacrima crystals;[ch. 172] the Earth-land wizards are similarly only able to perform magic in Edolas after taking pills provided by Mystogan for this purpose.[ch. 180]The kingdom is ruled by Faust (ファウスト, Fausuto), Mystogan's father,[ch. 190] who replenishes his world's magic using inter-dimensional anima (アニマ?) portals that absorb and crystallize magic power from Earth-land as lacrima.[ch. 169] A version of Fairy Tail exists in Edolas as a dark guild due to Faust's abolishment of wizard guilds; among its members are Natsu Dragyon (ナツ・ドラギオン, Natsu Doragion?), Natsu Dragneel's timid counterpart and the guild's vehicle expert;[ch. 174] Lucy Ashley (ルーシィ・アシュレイ, Rūshii Ashurei), a boyish and intimidating version of Lucy Heartfilia; Gray Sorloge (グレイ・ソルージュ, Gurei Sorūju), a version of Gray Fullbuster who wears multiple layers of clothing and harbors unrequited feelings for Juvia Lockser's counterpart; and a teenage version of Wendy Marvell.[ch. 170] They are hunted by Edolas's royal military commanded by Panther Lily; Erza Nightwalker (エルザ・ナイトウォーカー, Eruza Naitowōkā), Erza Scarlet's ruthless counterpart who wields a transforming spear based on Haru Glory's Ten Commandments sword from Rave Master;[ch. 180] Hughes (ヒューズ, Hyūzu), who controls Faust's indoor amusement park attractions with a baton;[ch. 182] Sugar Boy (シュガーボーイ, Shugā Bōi), whose sword can turn anything into liquid;[ch. 182] Byro (バイロ, Bairo), the elderly chief of staff who carries various magical potions;[ch. 184] and Coco (ココ, Koko?), Byro's young barefoot aide.[ch. 171]Following the defeat of Oración Seis, Magnolia's residents are absorbed through anima and turned into a giant lacrima, which Faust intends to ram into the Exceed kingdom of Extalia to bestow a limitless supply of magic on his kingdom. He extracts the dragon slayers' magic to power a chain cannon to achieve this,[ch. 180] later piloting the dragon-shaped mecha Doroma Anim (ドロマ・アニム, Doroma Animu?) to battle the dragon slayers.[ch. 190] After Faust's defeat, Mystogan restores Magnolia and reverses the anima's effects to return Earth-land's stolen magic, permanently depleting Edolas's supply.[ch. 198]The Exceed (エクシード, Ekushīdo?) are a race of catlike beings from Edolas ruled by Chagot (シャゴット, Shagotto); they reside on a floating island called Extalia (エクスタリア, Ekusutaria). They are the only residents of Edolas capable of possessing magic as a natural ability, which they use to produce wings and fly with the spell Aera. Because of this, they are seen as angels by the humans of Edolas and Chagot is revered as a god who passes judgment on humans.[ch. 176] Most of the Exceed population resent humans, casting out any Exceed who sympathize with them or ignore their queen's orders.[ch. 185] Despite this, they are actually a weak race with a history of being abused by humans, and their divinity is a ruse devised by Chagot's court to protect their people and bolster their self-confidence.[ch. 188] Before their birth, Happy and Carla's eggs are sent to Earth-land along with 98 other unborn Exceed under the pretense of hunting and killing dragon slayers.[ch. 176] This is later revealed to be another ruse created to prevent a panic over the plan's true purpose: to ensure their race's survival after Chagot foresees Extalia's eventual destruction caused by Edolas's loss of magic.[ch. 198] The entire Exceed race is transported to Earth-land after Mystogan reverses Edolas's anima and, realizing their mistake in judging humans, decide to live in harmony with them and search for the 100 missing Exceed children.[ch. 197-198]Igneel (イグニール, Igunīru?), the Fire Dragon King (炎竜王, Enryūō?), is a dragon and Natsu Dragneel's adoptive father. He raises Natsu from infancy, teaching him language, culture, and the ability to use Fire Dragon Slayer Magic.[ch. 2] When Natsu witnesses Igneel's disappearance on July 7, X777, he begins a search for the dragon.[ch. 1, 66] His search results in him encountering several other dragon slayers who have similarly lost their own dragon guardians on the same date. Fourteen years later, when Acnologia arrives at the battle between Fairy Tail and Tartaros, Igneel is revealed to have magically sealed himself inside Natsu's body all along,[ch. 400] as are the other dragons with their respective children, for the triple purpose of preventing them from turning into dragons as a side effect of their Dragon Slayer Magic, waiting to personally eliminate Acnologia after the dragon slayers are fully inoculated,[ch. 414] and prolonging their own lives due to having lost their souls to Acnologia.[ch. 415] However, Igneel is brutally killed by Acnologia and ascends back to a higher plane of existence with his fellow dragons to watch over mankind. He also passed down the "Blaze Dragon King Mode" to Natsu Dragneel after his death.[ch. 414, 415] His voice actor in the Japanese anime television series is Hidekatsu Shibata. In its English dub, he is voiced at first by Bob Magruder, later by Jim White.[23]Ur (ウル, Uru?) is Ultear Milkovich's mother and the teacher of Gray Fullbuster and Lyon Vastia. She is a renowned Ice Make wizard whose power is stated as being worthy of the Ten Wizard Saints'.[ch. 46] Before meeting Gray and Lyon, Ur brings her sickly daughter to a magic research facility to save her life as a child, only to later be told that Ultear has died while the doctors perform unethical experiments on her in secret.[ch. 241] She then takes on Lyon and Gray as her pupils in an effort to move on. When Gray attempts to kill the Etherious Deliora, Ur sacrifices herself to save him by performing the forbidden spell Iced Shell (絶対氷結(アイスドシェル), Aisudo Sheru?, Japanese text translates as "Absolute Freeze"), transforming her body into ice to permanently freeze the demon. She remains alive in this form until Lyon melts her with the Moon Drip spell to release Deliora, essentially killing her as she drifts out to sea as water. Later, Ultear falls into the sea while dueling Gray, causing her to experience her mother's memories and realize the truth of what transpired at the research facility, having assumed that Ur had abandoned her there.[ch. 241] Ur is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the Japanese anime television series, and by Kira Vincent-Davis in its English dub.A wealthy business tycoon and president of the esteemed Heartfilia Konzern, Jude Heartfilia (ジュード・ハートフィリア, Jūdo Hātofiria?) is Lucy Heartfilia's father. As with Lucy, his name is based on the Beatles song "Hey Jude".[24] Jude's relationship with his daughter is strained due to Layla's death, which eventually leads to Lucy running away from home.[ch. 50] Years later, he recruits Phantom Lord to bring her home for a business opportunity. However, his actions inadvertently involve Fairy Tail in a guild war to protect her, which results in Lucy breaking ties with her father.[ch. 67] Shortly afterward, Jude becomes bankrupt and loses his estate, and takes up work at a merchant's guild, mending his relationship with Lucy.[ch. 130] He dies towards the end of Lucy's seven-year disappearance, but demonstrates his love and faith in his daughter's well-being by leaving her seven years worth of rent money and birthday gifts.[ch. 258] He is voiced by Banjō Ginga. In the English dub, his voice is supplied by Bill Jenkins.The human counterpart of Grandeeney from Edolas, Porlyusica (ポーリュシカ, Pōryushika?, also "Poluchka") is Fairy Tail's elderly medicinal advisor who lives in the forest on the outskirts of Magnolia, able to remedy all sorts of ailments and injuries. She resents humans and often chases visitors out of her house unless they are in need of her aid.[ch. 51] She is a longtime friend of Makarov Dreyar, whom she nurses to health when he is drained of his magic, and later when he falls deathly ill during Laxus Dreyar's rebellion. Seven years following Sirius Island's disappearance, she meets Wendy Marvell and gives instructions for advanced Sky Dragon Slayer Magic spells relayed to her by Grandeeney, having failed to teach them to Wendy before her disappearance.[ch. 260] In the original Japanese series, her voice actress is Shōko Tsuda.[9] In the English dub, she is voiced by Linda Young.[10]The characters of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles as having a "strong 'bite me' vibe" and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda.[25] In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style "is a kick".[26] In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not to get caught up in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance."[27] Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk, in his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, mentions the "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters".[28] Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about that will probably depend upon which character you prefer." Silverman also thought that readers "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [in chapters 162 through 164]." However, she said that "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," and pointed out that "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad."[29]Entire seriesIndividual volumesFairy Tail Zero (Japanese: フェアリーテイル ゼロ, Hepburn: Fearī Teiru Zero?, stylized as FAIRY TAIL ZERØ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. The series is a prequel to Mashima's Fairy Tail manga, depicting the events leading to the formation of the titular wizards' guild. Kodansha Comics USA published it as a single volume in North America. The Fairy Tail anime television series included an adaptation of the spin-off, which aired from January 9 to March 26, 2016.105 years before the events of Fairy Tail, six-year-old Mavis Vermillion lives on Tenrou Island as a servant of the Red Lizard wizards' guild. A violent skirmish breaks out between Red Lizard and their rival guild, Blue Skull, leaving Mavis the apparent sole survivor alongside Zera, the young daughter of Red Lizard's master. Seven years later, a band of treasure hunters—Yuri Dreyar, Precht Gaebolg, and Warrod Sequen—come to the island in search of its centerpiece, the Sirius Jade. As Mavis and Yuri contend over ownership of the jade, they discover it has already been taken by Blue Skull. Mavis proposes she and Zera accompany the treasure hunters to recover the treasure.The group journeys to the city of Magnolia, where Blue Skull has established a brutal regime. Mavis fails to bluff the guild's master into returning the jade with her illusory magic, and she retreats into the forest with her outmatched allies. There Mavis encounters a young man who, unbeknownst to her, is the infamous dark wizard Zeref. Mavis expresses sympathy for the man, who is afflicted with a curse that withers and kills all life around him, and convinces him to teach her and her allies how to use magic to combat Blue Skull. They successfully overthrow Blue Skull using their magic, but Mavis discovers that the jade has become contaminated with evil magic. When Yuri takes the jade for himself, he inadvertently fuses with a massive skeletal dragon utilized by Blue Skull and mindlessly rampages through the town. Mavis rescues Yuri by casting Law, a prototype spell learned from Zeref. However, Mavis forfeits her ability to age as a side effect from using the unmastered spell.After recovering and learning of Mavis's condition, Yuri dedicates himself to protecting her as a friend. He also reveals to Mavis that Zera is an illusion only she can perceive; Zera further confirms that the real Zera died during Blue Skull's raid on the island, and Mavis unknowingly created her in response to her death. Mavis accepts Zera as an illusion, causing her to disappear, and organizes the Fairy Tail wizard guild in her memory.Hiro Mashima began publishing the series in the first issue of Kodansha's Monthly Fairy Tail magazine on July 17, 2014.[6][7][8] The series ended in the magazine's 13th and final issue on July 17, 2015.[9][10]The series is licensed in North America by Kodansha Comics USA, who announced their license at an event at Books Kinokuniya in New York on November 15, 2015.[11]An adaptation of Fairy Tail Zero was announced for the Fairy Tail anime television series on the jacket bands of Fairy Tail volume 52 and on the single collected volume of the series.[1][14] The adaptation premiered on January 9, 2016.[1] Funimation simulcasts the series with a broadcast dub in North America.[15] The opening is "Ashita o Narase" (明日を鳴らせ?, lit.

The series ended its initial run on March 30, 2013.[4] A new series premiered on TV Tokyo on April 5, 2014, and ended on March 26, 2016.[1]The series was originally licensed for an English language release in North America by Del Rey Manga, which began releasing the individual volumes on March 25, 2008 and ended its licensing with the 12th volume release in September 2010. In December 2010, Kodansha Comics USA took over North American release of the series.[5] The Southeast Asian network Animax Asia aired an English-language version of the series for seven seasons from 2010 to 2015.[6][7] The anime has been licensed by Funimation for an English-language release in North America.[8] As of November 2013, it has 25 million volumes in circulation.[9]The fictional world of Earth-land (アースランド, Āsu Rando?) is populated by wizards who coalesce into guilds to hone their magical abilities and apply them to paid job requests. Seventeen-year-old wizard Lucy Heartfilia runs away from home to join Fairy Tail, a wizards guild famous for its members' overly destructive antics. She is invited into the guild by Natsu Dragneel, a wizard with dragon-like abilities who travels the kingdom of Fiore (フィオーレ王国, Fiōre Ōkoku) in search of his missing foster father, the dragon Igneel. Natsu forms a team with his cat-like companion Happy and Lucy, later to be joined by ice wizard Gray Fullbuster and armored wizard Erza Scarlet. The five embark on numerous guild missions, which include subjugating criminals, illegal dark guilds, and ancient Etherious (エーテリアス, Ēteriasu) demons created by the dark wizard Zeref.Several of Fairy Tail's members encounter the immortal Zeref on the guild's sacred ground of Sirius Island (天狼島, Tenrō-jima). A conflict between Fairy Tail and the dark guild Grimoire Heart ensues over Zeref, which attracts the attention of the evil black "dragon" Acnologia. The Fairy Tail wizards survive Acnologia's assault when the spirit of Mavis Vermillion, their guild's founder, puts them into seven years of suspended animation with her defensive spell, while Zeref leaves the island to ruminate over his next course of action during this time. Deciding to eradicate humanity for summoning Acnologia, Zeref organizes a battle between Fairy Tail and Tartaros, a dark guild of Etherious demons who aim to unseal E.N.D., Zeref's ultimate demon. Acnologia returns to annihilate both guilds, but is stopped when Igneel emerges to battle him, revealed to have sealed himself within Natsu. The wizards defeat Tartaros while Igneel is killed by Acnologia, whom Natsu vows to defeat and avenge Igneel's death.One year later, Natsu returns from a training journey to discover that Fairy Tail's master Makarov Dreyar has been staving off an invasion by the Alvarez Empire, a military nation that is ruled by Zeref. During their battle with Zeref's army, Natsu discovers his origins as Zeref's deceased younger brother, whom the dark wizard reincarnated as E.N.D. (Etherious Natsu Dragneel) out of a desire to end his own cursed immortality.After finishing his previous work, Rave Master, Hiro Mashima found the story sentimental and sad at the same time, so he wanted the storyline of Fairy Tail to have a "lot of fun [for everyone]". When originally creating the series, Mashima was inspired by magicians and wizards. He based Natsu's motion sickness on one of his friends, who gets sick when taking taxis together.[10] When naming Natsu, Mashima thought western fantasy names would be unfamiliar to Japanese audiences. When writing individual chapters of Fairy Tail, Mashima takes a five-day process: on Monday, the script and storyboards are written. On Tuesday, Mashima writes rough sketches. From Wednesday to Friday, he finishes the drawing and inking on the chapters. Mashima usually begins new chapters after completing the previous ones.[11] For the characters of the series, Mashima drew upon people he has known in his life. In establishing the father-son relationship between Natsu and Igneel, Mashima cited his father's death when he was a child as an influence. Mashima based the humorous aspects of the series on his daily life and jokes his assistants would make.[12]Written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima Fairy Tail has been serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Magazine beginning on August 2, 2006. The individual chapters have been collected and published into tankōbon volumes by Kodansha since December 15, 2006. There are a total of 492 chapters and 55 tankōbon volumes.

Four original soundtrack CDs have been released, containing music from the anime: the first soundtrack volume was released on January 6, 2010,[59] the second volume on July 7, 2010,[60] the third soundtrack volume on July 6, 2011,[61] and the fourth soundtrack volume on March 20, 2013.[62] Character song singles were also produced; the first single, featuring Tetsuya Kakihara (Natsu) and Yuichi Nakamura (Gray) was released on February 17,[63] while the second single, featuring Aya Hirano (Lucy) and Rie Kugimiya (Happy), was released on March 3, 2010.[64] Another character song album, entitled "Eternal Fellows," was released on April 27, 2011.

Other songs on the volume are performed by Yuichi Nakamura (Gray), Sayaka Ohara (Erza), Satomi Satō (Wendy), Wataru Hatano (Gajeel), and a duet by Rie Kugimiya (Happy) and Yui Horie (Carla).[65]An internet radio program began airing on HiBiKi Radio Station on February 11, 2012, featuring anime voice actors Tetsuya Kakihara (Natsu) and Mai Nakahara (Juvia) as announcers.[66]According to Oricon, Fairy Tail was the eighth best-selling manga series in Japan for 2009,[67] fourth best in 2010 and 2011,[68][69] fifth best of 2012,[70] dropped to ninth in 2013,[71] to 17th in 2014,[72] and was 15th in 2015.[73] The fifth volume of Fairy Tail was ranked seventh in a list of the top ten manga, and the series once again placed seventh after the release of the sixth volume.[74] About.com's Deb Aoki listed Fairy Tail as the Best New Shōnen Manga of 2008.[75] It also won the 2009 Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen manga.[76] At the 2009 Industry Awards for the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, the organizers of Anime Expo, Fairy Tail was named Best Comedy Manga.[77] Volume 9 of the series was nominated in the Youth Selection category at the 2010 Angoulême International Comics Festival.[78]Reviewing the first volume, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network felt Fairy Tail followed standard shōnen action manga tropes, writing "the mix of goofy humor, face-crushing action and teary-eyed sap is so calculated as to be mechanical."[79] Carlo Santos, also of Anime News Network, agreed in his review of volume three; having positive views towards the art, particularly the action scenes, but citing a lack of story and character development.[80] By volume 12 Santos suggested that Mashima's true talent lies in "taking the most standard, predictable aspects of the genre and somehow still weaving it into a fun, fist-pumping adventure."[81]Kimlinger, his colleague Rebecca Silverman, and A.E. Sparrow of IGN all felt Mashima's artwork had strong similarities to Eiichiro Oda's in One Piece.[82] While Sparrow used the comparison as a compliment and said it had enough unique qualities of its own, Kimlinger went so far as to say it makes it difficult to appreciate Mashima's "undeniable technical skill."[79][83]The anime has also received positive response from critics and viewers alike. In Southeast Asia, Fairy Tail won Animax Asia's "Anime of the Year" award in 2010.[84] In 2012, the anime series won the "Meilleur Anime Japonais" (best Japanese anime) award and the best French dubbing award at the 19th Anime & Manga Grand Prix in Paris, France.[85]In reviewing the first Funimation Entertainment DVD volumes, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the visuals, characters, and English voice acting, as well as the supporting characters for its comedic approach. However, Santos criticized both the anime's background music and CGI animation.[86] In his review of the second volume, Santos also praised the development of "a more substantial storyline," but also criticized the inconsistent animation and original material not present in the manga.[87] In his review of the third volume, Santos praised the improvements of the story and animation, and said that the volume "finally shows the [anime] series living up to its potential."[88] In his reviews of the fourth and sixth volumes, however, Santos praised the storyline's formulaic pattern, though saying that "unexpected wrinkles in the story [...] keep the action from getting too stale," but calling the outcomes "predictable".[89][90][90]Monster Soul (モンスターソウル, Monsutā Souru?) is a shōnen manga by Hiro Mashima. It was serialized in Comic Bom Bom from January 2006 to March 2006 . In the June 2007 issue the "second stage" started, this second part ended in the September issue. As of July 2007, there are 6 chapters (3 of first stage and 3 of second stage) and 1 takubon volume (consisting of the first stage). Kodansha Comics USA has licensed the series for North American release and will publish the first volume in May, 2014.[1]The tale of Monster Soul takes place in the land of Elfenland where humans and monsters inhabit. The main characters are a group of monsters called the Black Airs. The Black Airs is recorded as the strongest group of the monster forces in the great war between the humans and monsters.The first three chapters consist of three stories that do not have a main plot, but the last chapter of the "first stage" reveals a bit of the past.In the "second stage" the Black Airs travel to Hell to help a human boy save his townspeople who are captured by the evil Tri Command.Just wondering, but why are we using Tokyopop's adaptation of this name instead of 'Oracion Seis'? If Del Rey's using the names Mashima gives them, I doubt it's likely to be anything other than what can be derived from romanising the Katakana. 128.250.5.245 (talk) 05:27, 23 November 2009 (UTC)Since this article has been tagged for cleanup, in addition to making character descriptions and story lines as concise as possible we should also include information about design and/or production. See WP:WAF for more information. The official English releases by Del Ray include a lot of useful information in the back of the books. I have all the Volumes and will edit in character design information where and when I can. If anyone comes across more information from secondary sources like Newtype - if you can read Japanese - and other publications whether it be English or foreign as long as they live up to the standard of secondary sources please include it. Fox816 (talk) 20:27, 20 December 2009 (UTC)Why does Mirajane and Elfman share a section? they are both significant and unique members of Fairy Tail and they should be seperated. Simply being brother and sister doesn't mean they should share a section. - SuperTiencha (talk) 19:52, 14 August 2011 (UTC)Wow, some of the grammar and such in this page makes it look like it was written by an 8-year old. Seriously, periods should have a space after them, and some of the sentences are just too choppy. I would correct it, but it's just way too much =.=I think im leaning more towards the Main/Major/Minor because its more conservative and organized and the protagonist/antagonist approach would be less organized because like you mentioned people in the series change sides. Another reason is because most anime character lists do the main/major/minor format and It works better with them. - SuperTiencha (talk) 19:08, 12 September 2011 (UTC)All right, I am proposing we get this to a Good Article or a Featured List status. See my sandbox. I am using List of Naruto characters and List of One Piece characters as models. However, I still need to add more to the creation and conception section, and also add a merchandise and a reception section in addition to resolving the issues on the actual article.In addition to the issue described above, there are issues we need to fix up, using the List of Naruto characters and List of One Piece characters as models:All are welcome to assist and discuss in this process.

Her singing voice is exploited by her father to attempt to kill pirates in retaliation for the death of her mother. Ursula eventually argues with him that her singing is the only memento of her mother, and doesn't wish to use her gift to harm others and so she decides to take on human form and escape the sea. She befriends Hook, captain of the Jolly Roger, who offers to take her to Glowerhaven. She soon learns from Hook that her father asked him to trap her singing voice within an enchanted shell in exchange for squid ink, which Hook desires for vengeance against the Dark One. Ursula steals the ink from Poseidon's vault but as she delivers the item to Hook, her father arrives and takes the procured item away. Angered that his only hope of revenge has been crushed, Hook removes Ursula's singing voice so Poseidon can never use his daughter to sink another ship again.

After that, Ursula becomes a well-known villain in the Enchanted Forest, becoming the Sea Witch. Her reputation is important enough to be known by Rumplestiltskin and among other merfolk.

When his companion disintegrated upon touching the Grain, Merlin finds himself approved by the Holy Grail where he gains magic and immortality. He first discovered his magic by turning the desert into a forest. 500 years later, Merlin takes on a young boy as his Apprentice and creates a special box that contains a hat, which can absorb and accumulate magic. As a safeguard, only those who have overcome the Darkness can open it. Merlin later met Nimue, when he learns that her village of Oxleigh was attacked by Vortigan. The two fall in love where Merlin reveals the traits of the Holy Grail. In order to combat Vortigan and remove his immortality, Merlin headed to the place where the Stolen Flame is held and used it to remake the Holy Grail into Excalibur. When Vortigan attacks and seemingly kills Nimue. Merlin confronts Vortigan, until his heart is ripped out by Nimue (who drank from the Holy Grail). Though Merlin tells Nimue to spare Vortigan, Nimue kills Vortigan anyway which transforms her into the first Dark One. After Nimue breaks the tip off of Excalibur and steals the spark of the Stolen Fire, Merlin remakes the tip into the Dark One's Dagger, binding Nimue's spirit to it. Eventually, Merlin uses the Dark One's Dagger to summon Nimue, where he tries to kill her. But after failing to do so, Nimue takes the Dagger and uses one of Merlin's tears to transform him into a tree. The Darkness is later taken in by certain individuals including Gorgon the Invincible, Zoso, and more prominently Rumplestiltskin, who both attempt to gain freedom by cleaving themselves from the dagger unsuccessfully by stealing the box from the Apprentice. For eons, Merlin and his Apprentice choose an "Author" to witness and record the events that occur around them. While still trapped in tree form, Merlin gives a young King Arthur the prophecy of Excalibur. The Apprentice later speaks with Merlin. He tells Merlin that he has trapped the current Author Isaac Heller into the book after he made him harm Maleficent's child. Merlin tells the Apprentice that he can't undo what has already been done and remarks that the fate of the child and the fate of Snow White and Prince Charming's child are bound together as they always have been.Some time later through unknown means, Merlin appears in the Land Without Magic. Posing as an usher during the filming of The Sword in the Stone, Merlin instructs a confused young Emma Swan to not take Excalibur from its stone when she has the opportunity to do so.In the town of Storybrooke, Merlin owns a mansion containing his hat, a hidden portal door to Arendelle, and a secret room containing blank storybooks similar to the ones used by each Author. When the Dark One's powers escape from Rumplestiltskin, an older Emma takes them in as a sacrifice, causing the town's residents to travel to Camelot in order to locate Merlin and save her. The inhabitants of Camelot inform them that Merlin prophesized their coming, telling them only a savior can free Merlin from his entrapment in a magical tree in the kingdom. Thanks to a teardrop obtained by Regina and Emma (who used Violet to break Henry's heart in order to obtain it), Merlin was freed and begins helping Emma in her attempt to free her from the darkness. He starts by helping David's group infiltrate the dungeon to take out the guards and free Lancelot and Merida. Merlin takes Emma to where the spark of the Stolen Fire was last used and has her summon the spirit of Nimue using the Dark One's Dagger. After overcoming Nimue's influence, Emma and Merlin then return to the diner. On the way back, Zelena had tethered Merlin to Excalibur using a spell and summoned Merlin to his side. Again and again, Merlin tries to talk sense into Arthur, who is still furious at the sorcerer for giving him a false prophecy and a broken sword. Though Merlin says he can help him unite the sword with the dagger and repair everything that was lost, Arthur believes there is no going back and he doesn't want Merlin to have all the glory. Smugly, Arthur then orders him to render the heroes powerless and send them away. After Emma frees King Arthur's captives enough for King Arthur and Zelena to get away, Merlin is present when Emma tries to unite Excalibur and the Dark One's Dagger. During this time, Captain Hook's wound he sustained from helping to fight King Arthur opens up. As Emma heals it, Merlin states that any wound caused by Excalibur cannot be fully unhealed causing Emma to teleport herself and Captain Hook away. Merlin then feels his tethering to Excalibur fading, as the Darkness within him is transferred into Hook via Excalibur, knowing that it isn't good. After Captain Hook becomes another Dark One, Merlin sends Sir Lancelot to find the Lady of the Lake. While in Granny's Diner, Merlin foresees what will happen and prepares a recorded message. His message is cut off when he senses Captain Hook come in. Captain Hook then rips out Merlin's heart as the Darkness in Captain Hook's head changes form from Rumplestiltskin to Nimue. Despite Emma's attempted intervention, Captain Hook crushes Merlin's heart at Nimue's tempting, in order to enact another Dark Curse to return to Storybrooke and take revenge on Mr. Gold.When the group was back in Storybrooke through some way, Henry threw the magical toadstool into the cauldron where a pre-recorded message from Merlin is played telling them to find Nimue, the only person capable of helping them defeat the Dark One in the event that something bad happens to him. Before he can say anything more, he sees the Dark One coming, prompting the remaining part of the message to be cut off.Some time later, Arthur brings the residents of Storybrooke to Camelot, and assists them in finding Merlin. He even joins David in finding a toadstool and makes him a member of the Round Table, replacing a supposedly deceased Lancelot, but turns out that Arthur has his own agenda by keeping the toadstool for himself in order to save the kingdom. He is also a manipulator as he soon discovers that Emma is the Dark One from Mary Margaret and David and upon learning about Guinevere's feelings for Lancelot. King Arthur later confronts Mary Margaret and Sir Lancelot in the Vault of the Dark One where he claims the Dark One's Dagger only to find it is fake. David arrives and was able to capture King Arthur. While at the diner when handcuffed, Guinevere and the rest of King Arthur's knights arrive where David and Mary Margaret are bewitched to serve King Arthur and Sir Lancelot is thrown into the dungeon.

Using a spell, Zelena tethers Merlin to Excalibur and King Arthur summons him to his side. Again and again, Merlin tries to talk sense into Arthur, who is still furious at the sorcerer for giving him a false prophecy and a broken sword. Though Merlin says he can help him unite the sword with the dagger and repair everything that was lost, Arthur believes there is no going back and he doesn't want Merlin to have all the glory. Smugly, Arthur then orders him to render the heroes powerless and send them away. After Arthur and Zelena use the heroes as bait to force Emma to turn over the dagger and the eternal fire flame but after an intense fight they are defeated and travel back to Camelot. Arthur then plans to use a magical helmet called the Helm which is in DunBroch to lead an army that will fight the heroes. After learning from a witch that the Helm was purchased by Merida's father, Zelena and Arthur plan to find it before Merida and Mulan do. After finding it and thanks to Ruby/Red Riding Hood, Merida discovers that Arthur is the man who killed her father and after a big fight Merida thanks to Mulan, Ruby, and the Clans of DunBroch defeat Zelena and Arthur who then retreat back to Camelot.

When Regina plans to contact Merlin, King Arthur goes in alone to do it and throws the toadstool into the fire and claimed that he wasn't able to get through. Though King Arthur was unaware that magical toadstools don't burn.

While Emma wants to obtain the wisp to find Merlin, Merida wanted the wisp to save DunBroch. Merida states that wisps can be found in the Hill of the Stones. She also made a reference to having encountered witches and bear curses. Merida states that her father has passed away during a battle where he was killed by King Arthur and she has been made queen where she needs the wisp to find her brothers who have been kidnapped by the United Clans. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin's Dark One form wants Emma to betray and kill Merida. During the confrontation at the Hill of the Stones after Emma whispers to the wisp, Merida tells Emma that she heard her voice talking in her sleep. Emma tries to fight the temptation to take Merida's life as she catches Merida's arrows. Emma successfully pulls out Merida's heart only for David, Mary Margaret, Regina, and Captain Hook to show up.

Merida works to find the Enchanted Helm and receives help from Little Red Riding Hood and Mulan. After King Arthur and Zelena are fended off by Merida, Little Red Riding Hood, Mulan, and the United Clans, Merida didn't want to return the helm to the Witch. The Witch then tells Merida that she passed the test since the Enchanted Helm in question was not magical at all as both Merida and King Fergus gained the confidence to lead without the Enchanted Helm. Merida then received the Ale of Seonaidh from the Witch which she used to speak to her dead father.

When she returns home to her father Edwin, he tells her that everyone thought she was dead. She frequently revisits Wonderland for proof of its existence to her father. As she grows into a young woman, she encounters Cyrus, a genie with whom she falls in love. He later proposes to Alice shortly before the Red Queen apparently murders him. She then returns home, distraught by her loss, only to be introduced to her father's new wife Sarah and daughter Millie. After Alice is home a short time her father and step-mother seek to set her up with a young man from the neighborhood, but she rebuffs their efforts still recalling Wonderland, Edwin and Sarah suggest a doctor to Alice as the only other positive option. She reluctantly complies, and is brought to Bethlem Asylum by Dr. Lydgate.Twenty-eight years later, the Knave of Hearts is persuaded by the White Rabbit to help save Alice in Victorian England.

The morning of the procedure, the Knave and Percy the White Rabbit arrive at the asylum, telling Alice that Cyrus is alive. The three escape, journeying through a rabbit hole back to Wonderland.

At some point, Anastasia becomes the White Queen and rules Wonderland with Will.In his early life, he was the "bastard child" of the Sultan that was abandoned by him. Jafar's mother Ulima died when Jafar was young and he is sent to a palace to meet his father. Jafar attempts to steal a guard's dagger, though he is caught and brought before the Sultan. The Sultan learns from Jafar that Ulima is dead, and thus allows Jafar to stay at the palace as a servant to the Royal Family, though he must not call him father. Jafar later accidentally breaks this rule, causing the Sultan to almost drown him and leave him in a garbage dump. He is then taken in by a blacksmith, who constantly punishes him. One day, Jafar encounters a sorceress named Amara (colloquially known as "the Serpent") with whom he trains to take revenge on the Sultan. As his training progresses, he lets a man named Alik die from a poisoned wine in order to learn spells. Amara and Jafar plan to obtain genie magic to become the most powerful sorcerers in the world. Jafar and Amara successfully obtain a genie bottle each, though Jafar learns of a third in Agrabah. He then tricks Amara, transforming her into a snake and converting into his staff. Jafar later confronts the Sultan where he kills the Sultan's heir Mirza. Ten years later, Jafar forms an alliance with the Red Queen. In a plot with the Queen, he saves Cyrus from being thrown into the Boiling Sea by Jafar (who had his magic carpet appear beneath Cyrus), and keeps him prisoner in his tower.Twenty-eight years later, Alice returns to Wonderland. Knowing that the Red Queen was no more needed in his plan, he then attempts to kill the Red Queen until she reminds him that she is the only one who knows of Alice's location. Following Cyrus' escape and the plot to use Edwin to have Alice use her second wish, it is revealed that the Old Prisoner also in Jafar's home is the Sultan. Jafar keeps him from falling to his doom, keeping him alive long enough to witness his final move on Alice. The Red Queen's servant is shown to have an allegiance with Jafar, stealing Cyrus' genie bottle from her palace and giving it to Jafar. However, Jafar soon realises this to be a fake, and casts a storm to kill the Red Queen, who captures Cyrus and orders him to locate the pair to Alice. There, they meet the Knave and Percy the White Rabbit, and the Red Queen pleads for Alice to order Percy to create a portal to escape, though Alice demands to know why she formed an allegiance with Jafar to begin with. She reveals the reason to be because she wants Jafar to change the Laws of Magic in order to go back in time and stay with Will. Alice reluctantly orders Percy to dig, though a lightning bolt rebounds from the Red Queen's genie bottle and injures the Knave. Because of Alice's first wish, she temporarily dies in Cyrus' arms, until the Knave makes Alice's final wish by wishing for her suffering to stop. Alice awakens and learns that the Knave has freed Cyrus from his genie status, though the Knave trades his place within the bottle.Jafar later claims the bottle from the Red Queen and prepares to use his magic to tap into the genie magics. When he is unable to, Jafar finds out that the Knave of Hearts doesn't have his heart in him after it was removed by Cora and plans to claim it. Even though Jafar manages to claim the Knave of Hearts' heart, his staff suddenly works against him causing Jafar to retreat. Upon placing the Knave of Hearts' heart back into his body, Jafar then stabs the Red Queen. When Jafar invokes the ritual with the three bottles, he gains the ability to change the laws of magic. His first act was to make his father love him like he should've been loved before making water appear in his father's lungs. After pinning the Jabberwocky to the wall with the Vorpal Blade, Jafar raises an army of previously dead soldiers to help in his conquest of Wonderland. When it came to the fight at the Well of Wishes, Jafar dissolved Amara into the water she planned to return to Nyx. When Alice makes her attempt to return the water in order to break Nyx's genie curse, Jafar steals the water from Alice. This results in Nyx invoking the genie curse on Jafar and sending his bottle to another location. Once that was done, Jafar's change on the laws of magic were undone.After the Dark Curse broke, he travels to Storybrooke to convince the Knave of Hearts to help him save Alice, who is being kept in an asylum following her storytelling of Wonderland. On the morning of a procedure that will remove her memories of the land, Percy and Knave come to save Alice, and the three of them escape the asylum and journey through a rabbit hole back to Wonderland, after convincing Alice that her true love Cyrus has been seen alive. Percy is then ambushed by The Red Queen who takes him to her palace, where it is revealed that Percy was forced by her to bring Alice back to Wonderland. The Red Queen orders Percy to keep her updated on Alice's whereabouts, lest he be killed. Percy reluctantly complies and continues to help Alice and the Knave search for Cyrus. He is later used by Jafar to help travel to England to retrieve Alice's father and bring him to Wonderland to threaten Alice to use another of her wishes.Alice and the Knave are aware of Percy's deception and visit him to use him to escape from Wonderland. However, he is ashamed of his betrayal, revealing to the pair that he had no choice as the Red Queen had captured his family, and forced him to do everything she said unless she would kill them. The pair forgive him, and the Knave believes that the Red Queen (as Anastasia) would have kept his family in her secret place. He takes Alice and Percy to it, successfully retrieving Percy's wife and children. The Red Queen later captures Cyrus and orders him to locate the pair to Alice. There, they meet the Knave and Percy, and the Red Queen pleads for Alice to order Percy to create a portal to escape from Jafar's cast storm. He complies by order of Alice, though the Knave is ultimately made a genie, upon making his wish to end Alice's suffering after she is temporarily killed by the storm. Percy later tries to rally those who are still loyal to the Red Queen to no avail. Following Jafar's defeat, Percy attended Alice and Cyrus' wedding.Years later, Percy can be seen looking from behind some tall grasses when Alice and Cyrus are seen with their child.Ten years later, the Sultan appears as an old prisoner in a cage of Jafar's tower on a floating island. When the genie Cyrus (whom has also been captured by Jafar) makes his escape and offers to have the ex-Sultan accompany him, he declines claiming he would only slow Cyrus down. Jafar later visits his father, telling him that once Alice uses her final wish, he will control the laws of magic, thus forcing his father to acknowledge him as his son. Regretting that he had not killed Jafar when he had the chance, the ex-Sultan purposely falls into the pit that his cage hangs over. Though Jafar spares him upon having his magic carpet catch him so that he can witness his final move on Alice. During Alice's raid on the palace, she managed to free the Sultan. When Jafar attains great magical power, he makes his father feel true love for him. The Sultan is happy to have Jafar as his son, but it turns out that Jafar only wants him to feel this way so the Sultan knows what it's like to have someone who loves him kill him and drowns the Sultan with magic by making water appear within him.The Jabberwocky entered the town where the lamp that the Knave of Hearts was in and gets a man to tell him where to find the lamp using the fear of the man's wife killing his children near the river to get the information.

Using Lizard's eyes, Jafar and the Jabbberwocky learn that the Red Queen has the genie's lamp as Jafar instructs the Jabberwocky to bring him the Red Queen. Percy the White Rabbit later tells the Red Queen and the Knave of Hearts that Jafar has released the Jabberwocky. Afterwards, the Red Queen is ambushed by the Jabberwocky upon predicting her attack and ordering the Knave of Hearts to get into the genie's lamp. The Jabberwocky starts to use the Red Queen's fear of finding the genie's lamp to find it. Using a stick, the Red Queen turns it into a sword so she can stab her. It doesn't work since the Jabberwocky is vulnerable to one blade. The Jabberwocky then steals the genie's lamp from the Red Queen with both of them having been brought by Jafar. Jafar also reveals to the Red Queen that she has made the Jabberwocky his new partner as he orders the Jabberwocky to not stop tormenting the Red Queen until all three wishes are made. The Jabberwocky then taunts the Red Queen for turning against the life that she should've had. The Jabberwocky then uses the Red Queen's fear of not getting Will's love back as a way to get her to use one of her three wishes. The Red Queen is tempted by the Jabberwocky into wishing for her crown as the Jabberwocky tries to get the Red Queen into wishing for her jewels and for the Jabberwocky to stop by getting into her head.

When she cheerfully inquires for their names, Tweedledee states that due to their status as servants, they don't have any.

He prides himself on being a big, green, terrifying ogre and is bad tempered and irritable. He begins the series as an unsociable hermit until he meets his soon-to-be best friend, Donkey. In a deal with Lord Farquaad, he and Donkey embark on a quest to save Princess Fiona from the castle in which she was confined. Despite their differences, Shrek and Fiona fall in love, marry at the end of the first film, and have three ogre babies in the third film. Chris Farley was originally set to play Shrek, but he died before he could complete film (he finished 80-90% of the film or according to his brother Tom, 95%).In Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space, a woman mistakes The Missing Link as Shrek.Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is a miniature talking donkey. He is Shrek's annoying but good-hearted best friend, Dragon's husband and father of the Dronkeys.Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz, singing voice provided by Sally Dworsky in the first film, Renee Sands on all other occasions) is the princess of Far Far Away, the daughter of King Harold and Queen Lillian, and Shrek's wife from the end of the first film on. She begins the series as a beautiful princess who transforms into an ogress every night when the sun sets. At the end of the first film, the transforming spell is broken and she permanently takes the form of an ogress when she realizes that Shrek is her true love.In the first film, Fiona can be seen as a human in the magic mirror.Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas in the films, Eric Bauza in "The Adventures of Puss in Boots") is Shrek's sidekick. Loosely based on the fairytale character Puss in Boots as well as being a kind of parody of Zorro, he is a smooth-talking cat with a Spanish accent, usually wearing a cavalier's hat, a belt with a sword, a small black cape, and small Corinthian boots. Puss first appears as a minor character in Shrek 2, much like Dragon in the first film. He often overpowers his enemies by distracting them with his "cute kitten" looks. He also exhibits common cat behavior such as coughing up hairballs and chasing spotlights, usually resulting in his defeat or capture. He does not appear in the first film or 4D ride, though he does make a non-speaking cameo in the musical.The character was also featured in the 2011 film Puss in Boots as the lead character.Puss in Boots stars in the Netflix series The Adventures of Puss in Boots where he protects the hidden city of San Lorenzo.Dragon (voiced by Frank Welker) is depicted as a ruby-colored dragon who debuts as a ferocious guard challenging Shrek and Donkey in their quest to locate Princess Fiona. She is angered when Donkey accidentally disturbs her sleep. As Donkey attempts to distract her, he makes the realization that Dragon is female and successfully manages to charm his way past her. While she plays a minor role in this film, she reappears towards its conclusion at the marriage ceremony of Fiona and Shrek, in which Donkey takes her as his own bride. They are shown as a married couple by the events of the sequel; her character has a minor role as Donkey chooses to leave home on the grounds that she was behaving uncharacteristically ill-tempered, but is reunited with her husband towards the ending of the movie when it appears that her grouchy behavior was a result of pregnancy, and presents Donkey with their newborn hybrid children, the Dronkeys.Dragon's importance in the films has been known to shift and revert every now and again, she is usually depicted as Donkey's romantic interest, and seems to be acquainted with Fiona and the princesses featured in the films. She often appears as a running gag because of the convenient possibilities presented by her abilities, albeit she can serve as an effective means of protection because of these as well (such as her consumption of Farquaad towards the end of the first film). A silent character, Dragon has no spoken lines throughout the course of the franchise.Dragon appears in all 4 Shrek movies and Shrek 4-D. She is notably absent from Scared Shrekless and Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular, and neither was she mentioned.The Gingerbread Man (voiced by Conrad Vernon) is a live talking gingerbread man and one of Shrek's friends. He is also known as "Gingy" and was created by The Muffin Man. He is small and a fast runner, making him difficult to catch. He is made out of a normal carved-out gingerbread with icing and gumdrop buttons. He adores those buttons and begs Lord Farquaad not to pull them off. In Shrek the Halls he is afraid of Santa, as Santa has eaten his girlfriend.In the first film, he is first seen when Lord Farquaad ordered his bodyguard Thelonious to torture him in numerous ways, such as cutting off both of his legs and dunking him in a glass of milk. After an interrogation from Farquaad, he is thrown into a trash can when the Magic Mirror arrives and Gingy yells "Don't tell him anything!"He is impatient. In Shrek 2, for example, when Pinocchio cannot move himself while freeing Shrek and the trio from prison, Gingy sighs, and goes to help. He is also somewhat wild, and a prankster. When Shrek and Fiona leave for Far Far Away, he and others have a loud party in his house. He is cunning and can distract others, such as when Lord Farquaad demands to know where the other fairy tale creatures are and he replies by reciting the Muffin Man nursery rhyme, which Farquaad believes for a moment.In Shrek the Third, when Prince Charming takes over Far Far Away, he has Hook attempt to intimidate him to reveal Shrek's whereabouts. Instantly, Gingy's life flashes before his eyes, while in reality, he is mindlessly babbling away.In Shrek Forever After, he is shown to have a dark, violent side. In an alternate universe with Rumpelstiltskin as king, he fights and kills gingerbread animals as a gladiator for a living. He also tries to attack and bring in Shrek for Rumpel, despite being so much smaller. He is eaten by an overweight Puss in Boots in the alternate universe, but is seen alive again at the ogre triplets birthday party when the original timeline is restored.Arthur Pendragon (voiced by Justin Timberlake) is a supporting character who appears only in Shrek the Third and is loosely based on King Arthur. He is the only heir apparent (other than Fiona and Shrek) to the throne of Far Far Away. Artie is the cousin of Fiona. His father, presumably Uther Pendragon, seemingly abandoned him at the boarding school Worchestershire, where he remains until Shrek finds him.At Worcestershire, Arthur, nicknamed Artie, is relentlessly bullied and made fun of by everyone, most notably the popular Lancelot. He is at first unsure when confronted with the trials of being king, but gets used to the idea and manages to convince people to his way of thinking when he defends Shrek from the fairy tale villains.Artie does not appear in Shrek Forever After and neither was he mentioned. He was supposed to appear, but Justin Timberlake was unavailable to voice Artie because he was on tour, so he was deleted from the film. However, he did appear in deleted scenes, but they were not on the DVD release.The Three Little Pigs (voiced by Cody Cameron) are friends of Shrek and the others. In the original book and in the film, they are among the many fairytale creatures to be banished into Shrek's swamp by Lord Farquaad. One of the pigs stated that Lord Farquaad "huffed and puffed and signed an eviction notice." They all have German accents. They appear in all the Shrek films.By Shrek 2, the pigs have become best friends with Shrek. At the start of the film, they help look after Shrek's and Fiona's house while they visit Far Far Away. Later, they see Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots arrested by local police officers in Far Far Away, and free them, heading to the castle to stop Prince Charming. They thwart the Fairy Godmother's scheme and then celebrate. They sing a song with Big Bad Wolf in Far Far Away Idol.The pigs are less prominent in the third film. They appear at the start of the film, where Prince Charming has a new job as an actor in a dinner theatre. Along with the rest of the crowd, they jeer him, causing Charming to leave the stage. They later appear in the castle pretending to have tea with the others while Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots are finding Artie, the apparent heir to the throne, and Fiona, Queen Meriam and the princesses escape via a secret passage. Prince Charming storms in and demands Shrek's location. Under pressure when Pinocchio starts talking around in circles, one of the pigs reveals Shrek's plan and ends up locked up somewhere secret. The pigs are later freed and head to the castle to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek in his show.The Three Little Pigs play a small part in Shrek Forever After, when they appear at the ogre triplet's birthday party. Later, in the alternate universe, they appear as attendants to Fifi in Rumpelstiltskin's castle.In Scared Shrekless, they appear after Gingy's story, running quickly and yelling "weeweeweewee...", upon which the Wolf comments "They're gonna do that all the way home."In Shrek the Halls it was revealed that the pigs names are Julius, Kaní, and Zak. In Shrek 4-D the pigs are called Ham, Sausage, and Bacon, but in other versions their names are Hay, Sticks, and Bricks. In the end credits for The Pig Who Cried Werewolf, their names are Heimlich, Dieter, and Horst. In this film, they are voiced by Sean Bishop, not Cody Cameron, who voices "Horst". Aron Warner still voices Wolf.In Shrek The Musical, they have had enough of Lord Farquaad and his discrimination towards fairy tale creatures and join the rest of the fairy tale rebels in this story mainly appearing in "Story of my Life," "Freak Flag," "I'm a Believer," "This is Our Story," and any other numbers with the fairy tale creatures.Pinocchio (voiced by Cody Cameron) is a recurrent supporting character in the Shrek series. According to the original tale, he is a wooden toy boy made by Gepetto who dreams to be a real boy, and whose wooden nose grows forward every time he tells a lie. He is one of the fairy tale characters that were sent by Lord Farquaad to Shrek's swamp in the first movie, helps to rescue Shrek and his friends in the second movie, participates on Fiona's baby tea in the third movie, and also appears in the alternate world of the fourth movie. He frequently participates on Shrek's parties alongside with fellow fairy tale characters.The Three Blind Mice (voiced by Christopher Knights and Simon J. Smith in most films, Mike Myers in Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party) are a trio of identical blind mice brothers with English accents that are friends with Shrek and the others. They are all blind, and that is why they sport black sunglasses and carry canes. Unlike in the fairy tale, their tails are not cut off and they show no signs of injuries. Their names are Forder, Gorder and Horder.At the beginning of the first film, Lord Farquaad banishes them to Shrek's swamp with the others. They are not seen again until the final musical number, "I'm a believer", during which the fairies of Sleeping Beauty turn two of them into horses to pull a wagon made from an onion.Before the start of Shrek 2, the Three Blind Mice have become three of Shrek's best friends. They help Shrek and Princess Fiona by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. They are later seen during the Royal Far Far Away Ball and again when Shrek (in his human form) is thrown into a police truck. On hearing this, the Blind Mice and the others travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey. They then get into the castle and help to stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming. They later appear in Far Far Away Idol, singing "I Can See Clearly Now."In Shrek the Third, the Three Blind Mice only appear in two scenes: during the funeral of King Harold and when Shrek is about to leave to find the new king of Far Far Away.In Shrek Forever After, the mice are only seen in the normal universe.Dronkeys are the hybrid offspring of Dragon and Donkey. They are introduced in Shrek 2 as little more than a stinger gag. Audience members missed having Dragon in the film, as was revealed to the filmmakers during test screenings.[1] Dragon reunites with Donkey in Far Far Away, only to have a surprise for him in tow—six young hybrid donkey-dragon children, who take to their father immediately. Donkey is delighted, and dubs the dronkeys "our little mutant babies". Their names are revealed to be Eclair, Bananas, Peanut, Parfait, Coco and Debbie.The dronkeys have very little screen time in Shrek the Third. They appear initially to give Shrek a wake up call, then to bid farewell to Donkey before his journey with Shrek. Near the film's climax, Donkey frees them from Prince Charming's capture. In addition, a few dronkeys make an appearance at the film's close, when Shrek and Fiona are caring for their newborn triplets. In the alternate universe, when Donkey is told he has children, he asks: "Tell me, are my babies cute, or do they just make people feel uncomfortable?"The dronkeys provide background action in the Christmas television special. They are featured playing with the ogre children of Shrek and Fiona and flying around while their mother dances. They have antlers and fly around in Donkey's Christmas story. All the dronkeys love their parents, especially their father, and seem to have become good friends with the ogre triplets.The only individual to be given any semblance of a personality is Bananas, who has bright green irises that are noticeably wall-eyed, and frequently sneezes small tongues of flame. Donkey refers to Bananas as "my special boy".Some confusion exists as to why one dronkey is missing in Shrek 2. When the dronkeys were first introduced in the film's post-credits scene, there were six, including a unique individual which was red like her mother. He does not appear in Shrek the Third; this is a continuity error on the part of the filmmakers. Yet in Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular, set after Shrek Forever After, there are only four.In Shrek Forever After, the dronkeys are seen playing with Shrek's children, appeared at their birthday and also a cause of nuisance for Shrek. They are not seen in the alternate universe as they do not exist on that timeline.The Dronkeys were absent from Scared Shrekless, and neither were they mentioned.Farkle, Fergus and Felicia (also known as the Ogre Babies or Ogre Triplets ) are the ogre children of Shrek and Princess Fiona. Farkle (indicated by the tuft of hair) and Fergus are male, and Felicia is female (indicated by a pink bow in her hair).Just as many minor characters are members of the staff crew, children are voiced by offspring of staff crew, gender of voice not always same as actor: Jordan Alexander Hauser, Dante James Hauser, Jasper Johannes Andrews, Zachary James Bernard, Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi and Ollie Mitchell (son of Shrek Forever After director Mike Mitchell).[2]In Shrek the Third, Fiona reveals she is pregnant by telling Shrek that, when they return to their swamp, there will be some little "ogre feet" too. Before their birth, while on his journey with Donkey and Puss in Boots to find Artie, Shrek dreams of hundreds of ogre babies. In the dream, they flood Shrek's house and laugh at Shrek while he is naked apart from his graduation hat. He wakes up in another dream, where Donkey and Puss's faces have turned to that of the ogre babies. By the end of the film, they have been born and are shown playing around the swamp.Two of them pull Puss's tail and put a pacifier into his mouth. Another pulls some ear wax from Shrek's ear and uses it to draw pictures with its left hand. Later that night, they are shown sleeping and snoring, all in one small baby cot. Shrek and Fiona constantly give them slug juice for drinks. The ogre babies are shown prominently in the credits, along with Puss in Boots and Donkey. Two of the siblings are shown to like Puss, hugging him tightly and call him "Kitty". Puss is displeased when they use him for tug-o-war.They are seen more in Shrek the Halls, enjoying the seasons with their father and ecstatically enjoying their first Christmas with their parents. When Donkey brings the others to enjoy the holidays with them, the ogre babies hug Puss too tightly, pat his back, and tug on his tail. They enjoy various Christmas stories and get to see Santa Claus at the end.The triplets do not appear in the alternate universe in Shrek Forever After as Shrek and Fiona meet, but do not marry in that universe.In Scared Shrekless, they appear at the beginning, scaring the trick or treaters in their skeleton costume. That's the only part when they are shown.Queen Lillian (voiced by Julie Andrews[3][4]) is the queen of Far Far Away, wife of King Harold, mother of Princess Fiona, grandmother of the ogre triplets and mother in-law of Shrek.Queen Lillian makes her debut in Shrek 2. Although initially surprised at Fiona's transformation into an ogre, she is understanding of what has happened and, seeing that her daughter is deeply in love, accepts Shrek into their family. When King Harold is turned back into the Frog King at the end of the film, she still accepts him as she did years ago. She and Harold are a reference to The Frog Prince.In Shrek the Third, she is widowed and becomes a more determined character, leading the pack of princesses through a series of tunnels in the castle and breaking two walls with her head, whilst humming "My Favorite Things" and "A Spoonful of Sugar" (songs originally sung by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins, respectively). She rallies the other princesses from being damsels in distress to independent fighters. It is revealed in the film that Fiona inherited her fighting skills from her mother (Lillian asks "Well, you didn't think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?"). After the film's finale, Lillian is seen in Shrek's swamp home, happily visiting her grandchildren and playing with Farkle, who throws up on her dress, referencing to the phrase,"When a baby throws up on you, it means it likes you." At first she looks distressed and a little disgusted, but this changes as she comes to find it adorable.She appears at her grandchildren's birthday party in "Shrek Forever After" and gets mad when she thinks that it was Shrek who licked the birthday cake, when it in fact was Donky. Lillian is also seen in a number of flashbacks, showing her and Harold's decision to visit Rumpelstiltskin to free their daughter from the curse before Shrek saved her. In the alternate universe she and Harold disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. Her last appearance is at the end of the film, still celebrating the children's birthday.In Thriller Night, Shrek and his family watch The Music of Sound, starring Queen Lillian. This is a parody of The Sound of Music which starred Queen Lillian's voice actress, Julie Andrews.King Harold (voiced by John Cleese) was the king of Far Far Away, husband of Queen Lilian,[3][4] father of Princess Fiona, and father in-law of Shrek.King Harold makes his debut in Shrek 2. When his daughter Fiona arrives at the castle with her new husband, he is surprised that they are both ogres. He had secretly made a promise to the Fairy Godmother that her son Prince Charming would marry Fiona. Harold hires Puss in Boots to assassinate Shrek, but then succumbs to guilt when Fiona finds out that Shrek is not around. When the Fairy Godmother asks Harold to give Fiona the potion that will cause her to fall in love with Prince Charming, he refuses at first, recoiling from this invasion of her free will, but he is forced to acquiesce by some dark threat of disclosure. In the event, when Fiona states that she loves the old Shrek, rather the new one that Prince Charming is pretending to be, Harold swaps the cup containing the potion for his own.At the ball toward the end of the film, Harold protects Fiona and Shrek from a blast of magic from Fairy Godmother's wand, and it transforms him back into a frog, which is hinted to be his original form, meaning he was the Frog Prince before he married Queen Lilian. Queen Lilian seems content with this turn of events. Afterwards, Harold apologizes to Shrek and accepts him into the family, and Lillian says that he is more of a man for accepting the marriage of Shrek and Fiona than he ever was when he was a human.King Harold makes a very brief appearance as a frog king in Shrek the Third, in which he dies of a sickness (The story book The Legend of Shrek and other publications state that the transition from human to frog confused his age and accelerated the aging process). He tells Shrek on his deathbed that he and Fiona are next in line to the throne of Far Far Away, which Shrek rejects because he cannot imagine an ogre as king. Harold dies after telling Shrek about Fiona's cousin Arthur.King Harold makes his final appearance in Shrek Forever After, in which he appears very briefly in a couple of flashbacks. In the first, he and Lilian are about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin, but they break it off at the last moment. In the alternate reality of the second flashback, Harold and Lilian disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. At the end of the film, the original timeline is restored, leaving the current time a year or so after Harold's death (as seen in Shrek the Third). However, there is a large painting of him in which the face moves, indicating that his spirit inhabits the picture. Unlike the previous films, he is never seen in his frog form.The king's role is partly a reference to another character that Cleese portrayed: Basil Fawlty from the sitcom Fawlty Towers. The king refers to his "old war wound" (in the UK version – in the US version, it is "the old Crusades wound") to avoid his wife. This recalls Basil Fawlty's use of his "honourable war wound" (a shrapnel wound from the Korean War) as an excuse to rescue himself from unpleasant situations. The two characters share other similar character traits.[which?]Doris (voiced by Larry King in the US version, Jonathan Ross in the UK version) makes her first appearance in Shrek 2 and returns in Shrek the Third and very briefly in Shrek Forever After. She is based off one of Cinderella's two stepsisters. Unlike other ugly sisters, she is an ally and best friend to Fiona. She is first seen as an unusually masculine female bartender at the Poison Apple. She is depicted as a tall, independent woman with purple-themed clothes who wears Elizabeth Taylor style makeup. Her character design is intended to invoke the appearance of a drag queen, which is supported with her masculine voice.Doris is first seen in Shrek 2, when King Harold secretly enters the Poison Apple Club, in which she is working as a bartender. She recommends Puss In Boots to the king for the task of assassinating Shrek. Near the climax of the film, Doris points King Harold to a door guarded by the Fairy Godmother's bodyguards, behind which Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother are secretly meeting. At first, she has a crush on Prince Charming and forces him to kiss her at the end of the film. In Far Far Away Idol, she is accused by Simon Cowell of being ugly after she sings Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun".[5]In Shrek the Third, Doris becomes one of Shrek's best friends before the events of the film. At the beginning of the film, Doris is briefly mentioned by Mabel when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple. Mabel says that Doris does not belong here, and this indicates that Doris is living with Princess Fiona in the castle. She is also seen during Fiona's baby shower, but she escapes by a hidden trapdoor when Charming starts to enter the castle. Later, she is imprisoned by Charming after he invades Far Far Away. With the princesses, Donkey and Puss, she escapes and infiltrates the castle to confront Charming. In the end, Doris and Mabel finally meet in Charming's play and reconcile when Artie convinces the villains not to continue their villainous ways when they didn't get their happily ever after.Doris appears very briefly in Shrek Forever After at the ogre triplets' birthday party.Snow White (voiced by Amy Poehler, singing voice provided by Megan Hilty) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She has a talent for singing, which she uses to charm animals and make them follow her orders. She is shown to be very proud and vain, even boasting how she won Fairest In The Land from the Wicked Queen.In the first film, Snow White cameos as one of the fairytale creatures to be banished to Shrek's swamp. She is shown sleeping inside her coffin and being handled[clarification needed] by her seven dwarves. When Lord Farquaad is forced to choose a wife, Snow White, seen sleeping in the glass coffin, is his second choice. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, she fights with Cinderella to catch Fiona's bouquet.In Shrek 2, Snow White is briefly mentioned when the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after.Snow White appears more prominently in Shrek the Third, dressed in red. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty before the events of the film. Prince Charming interrupts Fiona's baby shower after she gives her a dwarf as a gift to babysit the triplets, saying that she has six more at home. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned in a dungeon. She complains that they could just have stayed put and carried on with their normal routines (having tea parties and similarly stereotypical "girly" behaviour), claiming to not care who is in charge. Later she is content just to wait to be rescued, as normal for fairytale princesses.Fiona encourages her and the others to show some initiative, and they manage to escape and head towards the castle. She tricks the guards (talking trees) by singing a high tone (using the same voice as in the Disney film) to charm the animals, and screaming (the same scream as in "The Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin) to command them to attack the trees. Her plan works and they enter the castle grounds, avoiding the knights guarding it. Snow White, along with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen in the background, talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian.Although it is unclear whether Snow White is married, at one point she is seen with a tattoo on her upper arm with the name Dopey surrounded by a heart.Cinderella (voiced by Amy Sedaris) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She wears her pair of glass slippers throughout the events of Shrek the Third. She uses her glass slipper as a weapon, somewhat like a boomerang. She is obsessed with cleanliness and tidiness after doing a great deal of housework for her stepmother and stepsisters (revealed to be Doris and Mabel).In the Shrek 2 video game, however, she is portrayed as an absent-minded valley girl.When Lord Farquaad is forced to choose his wife so that he can become king, Cinderella is one of his choices. She is shown at number 1 in a painting, wearing a yellow dress and trying on her glass slipper. However, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, ranked number 3. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, Cinderella is shown fighting with Snow White to catch Fiona's bouquet.In Shrek 2, Cinderella is briefly mentioned while the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after. There is also a picture of her in Fairy Godmother's factory. This can be seen more clearly in a behind-the-scenes guide. Thus Fairy Godmother appears to be the evil twin sister of Cinderella's fairy godmother.Cinderella appears more prominently in Shrek the Third, now wearing a light blue-silver dress. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and the Sleeping Beauty prior to the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, which Prince Charming interrupts when he takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle. After Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds and avoid the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Cinderella hurls her glass slipper like a boomerang at a knight, knocking him out. Cinderella, with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.Sleeping Beauty (voiced by Cheri Oteri) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She likes to sleep a lot. Because she sleeps so much in the film, little is known about her personality, other than that she seems to be a pleasant person who is a little eccentric at times.In Shrek 2, Sleeping Beauty is shown in a poorly drawn picture in Fiona's diary, explaining that Sleeping Beauty is having a party with all the other princesses, but Princess Fiona is not allowed to go on account of the ogreish appearance she acquires every night. Later in the film, Sleeping Beauty appears without speaking when a coach-limousine pulls up at the red carpet to the Far Far Away Royal Ball. When the door opens, she falls to the ground, still sleeping. In the film, she wears a blue dress and a crown.Sleeping Beauty appears more prominently in Shrek the Third, now wearing a white-green dress, and with light brown hair She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and Cinderella before the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, but Prince Charming interrupts it and takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle.After Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds, avoiding the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Sleeping Beauty yawns and falls to the ground, causing the knights to trip over her and fall, unconscious. With the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, Sleeping Beauty arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.Merlin (voiced by Eric Idle[6]) is a retired wizard teacher from Artie's high school, Worcestershire, in Shrek the Third.In Shrek the Third, after their ship crashes into sharp rocks, Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie get stranded on an island (possibly Lovers' Beach in Far Far Away). They meet Arthur's retired teacher Merlin, after Artie tries to separate himself from Shrek. Since Merlin retired because of a nervous breakdown (which he calls "third-level fatigue"), he seems rather eccentric, and his magic spells usually go wrong. At one point, when he prepares to teleport Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie to Far Far Away, he cracks his knuckles, only to fire a bolt that destroys a boulder.In order to help Shrek and Arthur be reconciled, he makes them look into a thick cloud of smoke to reveal their thoughts. Shrek sees a baby carriage, but lies and says that he sees a "rainbow pony". Merlin is pleased and moves on to Arthur, who sees a bird and its father. The father bird abandons the chick, leaving it frightened and confused. Merlin is happy they decided to look into their soul, and as he retreats to his hut, Shrek takes the opportunity to show Arthur that they are not so different after all. They catch Merlin eavesdropping on their conversation when he plays the song "That's What Friends Are For" on a phonograph to add to the mood.When Captain Hook and his cronies ambush Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie, he plays his piano, and Merlin is beside him playing it too until he is pushed away. After the villains retreat, Artie convinces Merlin to use a spell to teleport them to Far Far Away. But the spell causes Donkey and Puss to switch bodies (probably because they took each other's "hands" seconds before). After Prince Charming's defeat, Merlin returns, and Puss and Donkey force him to put them back in their own bodies. The spell works, but causes their tails to switch. Merlin tries to tell them, but decides not to, though their tails have inexplicably returned to normal later.In the video game to the first Shrek film, a different version of Merlin kidnaps Fiona.Brogan (voiced by Jon Hamm) is an ogre and the second-in-command of the Ogre Resistance in Shrek Forever After. He uses his nose as their horn.Brogan introduces Shrek into the resistance and is seen in the meeting with Fiona on how to fight against Rumpelstiltskin and the witches. When Pied Piper arrives and uses his flute, the song "Shake Your Groove Thing" is played, and Brogan cannot stop dancing. Later, he and the other ogres are captured, but they fight in the castle and defeat Rumpelstiltskin. He appears in the end credits as a guest at the ogre triplets' birthday.Cookie (voiced by Craig Robinson) is an ogre and a chef for the Ogre Resistance in Shrek Forever After. Food is his only weapon against the witches and Rumpelstiltskin. His signature dish is the chimichanga, of which he takes a cartful to the ambush of Rumplestiltskin. He is the only ogre to enjoy dancing while Pied Piper plays his flute until he and the others are captured. He catapults his chimichangas at the witches during the final battle. He is seen at the party in the end of the film.Gretched (voiced by Jane Lynch) is a female ogre who appears in the 4th film. She is a member of the Ogre Resistance.Humpty Alexander Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) appears in Puss in Boots. In his childhood, he was best friends with Puss and tried to find magic beans with him. However, their quest failed and Puss later became a revered hero in their hometown. Humpty grew jealous of Puss's fame and later tricked him into helping him rob a bank, thus branding Puss an outlaw. They were pursued by the authorities; Humpty was captured while Puss escaped. Seven years later, Humpty along with Kitty Softpaws convinced Puss to help him get magic beans from Jack and Jill to get the Golden Goose, but it was revealed that this was all a plot to just get Puss back home and arrested as revenge for abandoning him. But later Humpty had a change of heart and help Puss and Kitty fight The Great Terror and ends up breaking and is revealed to be a golden egg himself.In Shrek Super Slam, he is known as Master Fu and is an unlockable character. In Shrek 4-D, his grave can be seen in the cemetery.Puss in Boots mentions him in Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos.Kitty (voiced by Salma Hayek) is a black tuxedo cat. She has a white chest, whiskers, muzzle, tail-tip, eyebrows and white paws. Her eyes are bright blue. She wears a brown belt in which she carries a short dagger/sword, along with dark brown boots. Her fur is very thick. She has no claws on her paws because they were removed by her former owners.Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) is the comically short, ruthless ruler of the huge castle of Duloc, and the main antagonist of the first film.In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his domain of fairytale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling them to Shrek's swamp. Farquaad wants to become a king, but because he is not of royal stock, he cannot until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be the perfect wife and queen, but first she must be rescued from her tower, which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.Unwilling to perform the feat himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to select the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona. But Shrek and Donkey turn up and defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest instead, agreeing to remove the fairytale creatures from his swamp if he rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad, who immediately proposes marriage, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset.Fiona makes the transition from human to ogre form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, banishing her to the tower, claiming the title of king and sentencing Shrek to death. Before Farquaad finishes his claims to the kingdom, the dragon that had been guarding Fiona, who has since developed a relationship with Donkey, crashes through the window and devours the monologuing Farquaad, thanks to Shrek, who whistles for her. Moments later, Dragon burps and the crown comes out. Farquaad was apparently not well liked in Duloc: when Dragon eats him, the citizens laugh and cheer.He is confirmed to be dead by digestion when he enters as a ghost in the Shrek 4-D ride at Universal Studios and the 30-minute Shrek Special on the Nickelodeon TV channel, in which he tries to murder Shrek and Donkey and to kidnap and kill Fiona so that she can be his ghost queen. Princess Fiona is again rescued when Lord Farquaad is presumably killed by Dragon a second time. In Scared Shrekless, Farquaad is long dead, and his castle left in a decrepit state.Lord Farquaad does not appear, and is not mentioned in Shrek 2. Lord Farquaad briefly appears in Gingy's flashbacks in Shrek the Third.In Shrek the Musical, it is revealed that Lord Farquaad's mother was the princess from the fairy tale The Princess and the Pea. Also, Lord Farquaad's father was Grumpy of the Seven Dwarfs. Farquaad claimed earlier that Grumpy abandoned him in the woods as a child, but Grumpy reveals the true reason he kicked Farquaad out is that he was 28 years old and wouldn't move out of his basement as revealed when he and the other fairy tale characters raid Lord Farquaad's wedding.The Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) is a scheming, conniving opportunist, loosely based on the fairy-tale Cinderella's "Fairy Godmother", and the main antagonist of the second film. She seeks to get the best for herself and her son Prince Charming, rather than others. She takes an instant dislike to Shrek, and when he tries to ask her why Fiona is not happy, she rudely points out that "ogres don't live happily ever after." She then briefly insults Shrek, calling his fingers "dirty green sausages." She often resorts to blackmail and trickery through magic to get her way. She loves to eat whenever she is distressed ("someone get me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate," when Shrek makes a mess of her potion factory, and during her talk with Harold in the carriage about Shrek, it is shown that Harold ruined her diet, so she orders food from Friar's Fat Boy.Bubbles are her character's main theme. When she first appears, she is surrounded by bubbles as she sings to Fiona. When Shrek uses her card to ask for help, a voice mail message of her appears with her saying "Is it on? Is it on?" she is again surrounded by a bubble, which then shows an image of the Fairy Godmother's cottage. After the message ends, the bubble bursts. Finally when the Fairy Godmother "dies," she bursts into a host of bubbles. Her death later influences Charming to get revenge by taking over Far Far Away.Fairy Godmother appears in Shrek: The Musical as one of the characters who gets evicted by Farquaad.Even though The Fairy Godmother does not appear in Shrek the Third, she is mentioned by Prince Charming a lot.The Fairy Godmother is briefly mentioned by Lillian and Harold in the opening scene of Shrek Forever After and makes a cameo during the end credits.Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett in the second and third movie, Sean Bishop in Scared Shrekless) is the son of the Fairy Godmother, an antagonist of the second film, and the main antagonist of the third film. He is very handsome, and was supposed to rescue Princess Fiona from her dragon-guarded tower.In his first scene in Shrek 2, he travels to the castle where Fiona had been imprisoned prior to the first film, only to discover that Shrek has already found and married her, and that the Big Bad Wolf has taken to sleeping in her tower (without any explanation of how the wolf got there). His narration in this scene, as well as his conversation with the Wolf, recap the most important aspects of the plot of the first film.It is later revealed that Charming is in fact the son of the Fairy Godmother and that she wants him to marry Fiona so that he can become king (similar to Lord Farquaad's intentions in the first film). Thus, in contrast to his fairytale namesake, this Prince Charming plays a more villainous role, just like his mother. He is characterized as an arrogant, vain and spoiled mother's boy, and she as his doting parent, as well as shallow about his appearance. He later deceives Fiona into believing that he is Shrek, having been turned human by a "Happily Ever After" potion. Nevertheless, his heartless attitude shows through the disguise and Fiona realizes the truth before the end of the film. At the end, he is forced to kiss Doris.He sings "I'm Too Sexy" by "Right Said Fred" in Far Far Away Idol, but because of his horrible singing, Shrek and Fiona press a button that opens a trap door below him and he falls into it while he screams. He is voiced here by Randy Crenshaw.[7]As the main villain of Shrek the Third, Charming gathers all the evil characters from fairy tales that were at the Poison Apple Bar to get their revenge and their "Happily Ever Afters". After they invade the main castle of Far Far Away, Charming prepares a stage show in which he will defeat Shrek in front of the entire kingdom. His plan almost works when Shrek takes part in the show, but eventually fails when Shrek's allies come to the rescue.Arthur Pendragon then convinces the fairytale villains to give up their evil ways. Charming is furious and attempts to attack Artie only to be stopped by Shrek, who throws him towards the stone tower. Dragon then knocks over the stone tower from the stage and Charming looks at the tower and mutters out "Mommy", it lands on him and he is then presumably dead.Although he is dead in Scared Shrekless, he appears in the story "Boots Motel" (presumably made up by Donkey and Puss) alive and well. This time, he is voiced by Sean Bishop.[7]He appears as a zombie and at the movie theater (this proves he survived his ordeal and didn't get crushed by the stone tower after all) in Thriller Night, a Shrek parody of the iconic Michael Jackson short film, Michael Jackson's Thriller.While Charming's final fate is left undetermined, Rupert Everett's name was seen on the cast list for Shrek Forever After. This may have been a continuity error, because he wasn't seen or heard in the film. Prince Charming does make a (non-speaking) cameo during the end credits for Shrek Forever After.Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Conrad Vernon in the third film, Walt Dohrn in the fourth film) is a short man who makes magical deals (complete with contracts), and the main antagonist of the fourth film. He has a giant pet goose named Fifi.In Shrek the Third, he is seen as a patron at the Poison Apple Bar and is among the villains there who side with Prince Charming.In Shrek Forever After, King Harold and Queen Lillian are going to sign their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin (who has a different appearance than the one seen in Shrek the Third) to break Fiona's curse, but the deal is cancelled when they learn that Shrek has rescued Fiona from the tower, and he wishes Shrek was never born. Seeing Shrek regretting the life he has, Rumpelstiltskin makes a deal with him, taking away the day he was born. This deal enables Rumpelstiltskin to be the ruler of Far Far Away, by creating an alternate reality in which the king and queen carried out their deal with him and then disappeared (Rumpelstiltskin having twisted the deal). Shrek tries to reverse the deal using the exit clause (a true love's kiss, although in this reality Fiona intensely dislikes him) before 24 hours elapse and he disappears forever, but Rumpelstiltskin has an army of witches to stop him and hires the Pied Piper to capture him and the other ogres. He succeeds in capturing all but Shrek. When he offers anything in return for the one who brings Shrek to him, Shrek turns himself in, and in exchange has Rumpelstiltskin set the ogres free (though he keeps Fiona, as she is a princess by day). Rumpelstiltskin tries to feed Shrek and Fiona to Dragon (who is still evil in this reality), but Puss, Donkey and the other ogres come to fight, and with Shrek and Fiona they defeat Rumpelstiltskin and his army of witches. By this time Shrek's 24 hours are almost up, but at the last second, Fiona kisses the disintegrating Shrek, whom she now loves, thus restoring the original reality. Rumpelstiltskin is last seen during the ending, imprisoned in a cage by Shrek, Fiona and the other ogres, while Fifi explodes at Fiona's singing and the Pied Piper torments him. There are continuity errors in the franchise: Rumplestiltskin's appearance changes between the third and fourth films; at the end of the third film he is among the fairytale villains who change their ways, but in the fourth film he has reverted to his original, vindictive self.In Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular, Rumplestiltskin is still imprisoned in a cage and receives coal for Christmas. He appears twice in Shrek's Yule Log, out of his cage and unsuccessfully trying to put out the fireplace. Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular shows him imprisoned once more.Rumplestiltskin combines features of the previous three main villains: he is short and rules an empire with an iron fist, like Farquaad; he has magical powers to help others alter their fates, like the Fairy Godmother; and his life is ruined by Shrek's rescue of Fiona from the castle keep, like Prince Charming. It is ultimately implied by Donkey, when he is folding Shrek's contract into origami, that the original way to break Rumpelstilskin's contract is to call out his name correctly, which no longer works because everyone already knows who he is.Jack and Jill (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) are a married couple and the main antagonists of the film Puss in Boots.In Puss in Boots, Jack and Jill are in the possession of the magic beans from the Jack and the Beanstalk story, which Puss, Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty manage to steal to get into the giant's keep. However, it is revealed later that Jack and Jill were in cahoots with Humpty and Kitty to take the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. But when the Great Terror arrives to retrieve Golden Goose, its baby, Jack and Jill try to steal the Goose when Humpty had a change of heart and tried to help Puss lure the Great Terror away from San Ricardo, only for the couple to be stomped on by the Terror. During the credits, Jack and Jill are seen in full body casts.Throughout the film, Jack tries convincing Jill that they should have a family but he assumes that they should be taking care of their piglets.Thelonious (voiced by Christopher Knights) appears as one of Lord Farquaad's henchmen and an antagonist of the first Shrek film. He has poor intelligence, as shown when Lord Farquaad is deciding between three princesses and Thelonious says "Three! Pick number three, my lord" while holding up two fingers. He also makes a cameo appearance in Shrek Forever After, but only during the credits (showing a slide show of clips from the last 3 Shrek films).He also appears in Shrek 4-D, where he has kidnapped Fiona so the spirit of Farquaad can kill her and make her his spirit queen. But, when Thelonious released the raft to send Fiona over a waterfall, he has forgotten to get off of it first, leaving Fiona to knock him off of the raft. When Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona went over the waterfall, Thelonious caught them while holding on to a branch. But, the branch broke, sending them all falling down the waterfall until they were rescued by the Dragon and Thelonious becomes the first Shrek films villain to change to good. This is hinted at in the first movie when he appears in the ending helping to play the music organ.Rapunzel (voiced by Maya Rudolph) is one of Princess Fiona's former friends and an antagonist of the third film. She is snobbish, opinionated, vain, and does not seem to get along with the bossy Snow White.In Shrek the Third, Rapunzel is first seen during Fiona's baby shower, until Prince Charming invades the castle and the princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian escape secretly. Rapunzel pretends to find an exit and runs all the way to where Charming really is. The princesses, Doris and Lillian follow but are cornered by Charming's knights. Rapunzel then shows off her love and affection for the Prince, while the other women are imprisoned in a dungeon with Rapunzel telling Prince Charming not to have any harm come to them. While they are there, Rapunzel practices for her role in Prince Charming's play. In the final performance, she sings and acts as a princess on top of a tower (mimicking Princess Fiona, whose situation itself mimics Rapunzel's). The play is interrupted by Shrek's friends and Fiona. Gingy comes on stage by holding on to Rapunzel's hair, which he accidentally pulls off. When it is revealed that she is actually bald, Rapunzel gasps in horror and runs from the stage out of embarrassment.Captain Hook (voiced by Ian McShane in the third movie) appears in Shrek 2 in the bar of the Poison Apple, where he plays the piano and sings "Little Drop of Poison" (his singing voice during that song was provided by Tom Waits) and "People Just Ain't No Good" (his singing voice during that song was provided by Nick Cave) in the other. He appears in Shrek the Third as an antagonist, working for Prince Charming. When Artie convinces the villains to give up evil, Hook states that he grows daffodils and they are beautiful. Captain Hook is the first who throws his weapon down and becomes good.Captain Hook also appears as a contestant in the Far Far Away Idol feature on the Shrek 2 DVD with his singing voice provided by Matt Mahaffey. He begins to sing "Hooked On A Feeling" until Tinkerbell (whom Hook poisons in the classic Peter Pan story) prompts Simon Cowell to remove him from the stage.Captain Hook does not appear in Shrek Forever After, but his voice is heard in the soundtrack, and he makes a cameo in the book opening of the film holding some daffodils.The Cyclops (voiced by Mark Valley) is the bouncer for the Poison Apple as seen in Shrek 2.He appears in Shrek Super Slam, and his slam is "Eye in the Sky".In Shrek the Third, the Cyclops is seen on a Bucking Bronco at the Poison Apple Bar when Prince Charming comes in. The Cyclops is among the villains that help Prince Charming take over Far Far Away. He has a daughter, a cute little cyclops girl who also has only one eye who he brings with him as part of "Take Your Daughter to Work Day." He is a family man and does not really want to be evil. He even apologizes to Shrek when he hits him too hard. His idea of "pillaging" during the attack on Far, Far Away isn't exactly the most evil either, as he is only seen ripping the stamps off the letters in a mailbox.Various Cyclopes like him appear in the Shrek the Third video game, but it is unknown if he is there or not.Mabel (voiced by Regis Philbin) is the sister of Doris and the stepsister of Cinderella. She first appears in Shrek the Third, where she assists Prince Charming in his plan to take over Far Far Away. She is chubby and wears green-themed clothes. Like Doris, she is a kind-hearted person.Mabel is first seen when, at the bar of the Poison Apple, Prince Charming asks her where Doris is. Mabel, who has taken Doris's place as bartender, replies "She isn't welcome here anymore!" (In fact, Doris is now friends with Shrek and Princess Fiona). Like Doris, Mabel has a crush on Prince Charming. At the film's climax, she meets Doris on stage after the tower prop falls on Prince Charming and they reconcile.Mabel appears two times in Shrek Forever After, first time at the ogre triplets' birthday party where she tells Shrek that he forgot the candles for the birthday cake and second time where she grew old as one of viewers of Rumpelstiltskin's message.Appearing briefly in the second film and more prominently in the third, the two Evil Trees (played by Andrew Birch and Christopher Knights) help Prince Charming. In one scene of the third film, their names are revealed to be Ed and Steve. In the same scene, they explain that it is hard to find work since most of the world is against them. The trees are possibly two of the living trees from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.The evil trees appear in the Shrek Forever After video game.The Evil Queen (voiced by Susan Blakeslee) appears in the third Shrek film where she assists Prince Charming in taking over Far Far Away when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple bar. Prince Charming refers to her as the "Wicked Witch." When she is about to kill Queen Lillian (with a sword to her neck), Artie asserts they all can all stop being evil if they are willing to make a better choice. The Evil Queen happily says that she always wants to open a spa in France.The Puppet Master (voiced by Chris Miller) appears in Shrek the Third where Prince Charming convinces him to join his brigade by describing how Pinocchio has gone to look for his "real" father and never writes. His only line is "I hate that little wooden puppet". He is loosely based on Mangiafuoco in the Carlo Collodi's book The Adventures of Pinocchio and more based on Stromboli in the Disney film (bearing that name in the video game).Headless Horseman (voiced by Conrad Vernon) makes a cameo appearance in the Poisoned Apple during the second film and appears in the third film with Prince Charming in his invasion of villains. He seems to be a good friend of Captain Hook. He reveals that he has "always wanted to play the flute" (which would be difficult at best since he has no head).Fifi is Rumpelstiltskin's giant pet goose and an antagonist of Shrek Forever After. She is also his bodyguard and carriage puller and attacks Shrek and Donkey at one point. During the ending credits, Fiona sings a high note, causing Fifi to explode alongside the bluebird, a homage to a scene from the first movie.Fifi does not appear in Puss in Boots, but The Great Terror looks a lot like her.In Shrek the Third, some Witches are shown as patrons at the bar of the Poison Apple (one of them was seen singing at the Poison Apple Bar) when Prince Charming rallies the fairytale villains to take over Far Far Away. The witches carry out an air raid, dropping the evil trees from there to attack the citizens.Some witches are among Rumpelstiltskin's main assistants in Shrek Forever After, wearing black coats and having long noses and greenish faces. They ride their broomsticks and use pumpkins as bombs. They can be killed by water, as Rumpelstiltskin does to one of them, who cries "Oh, what a world! What a world!", like the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz. Some of them are seen dancing modern hip hop moves to the Pied Piper's flute after they ridicule him. They are defeated in the final battle. Although most of them display vicious behavior for most of the film, they passively surrender once Rumpelstiltskin is captured and are even shown to be sorry for Fiona when Shrek disappears. Near the end, they have reformed and made a rainbow out of clouds. Baba and Griselda are the only witches whose names are mentioned.The witches in Shrek Forever After are voiced by Billie Hayes, Kristen Schaal, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Kathy Griffin, Mike Mitchell and Lake Bell."Monsieur Robin Hood" (voiced by Vincent Cassel) is a French-accented version of Robin Hood who appears in the first Shrek film. Believing Shrek to be kidnapping Princess Fiona, he tries to save her with the aid of his Merry Men. They are defeated by Princess Fiona, who uses her kung-fu skills. Robin is portrayed as more of a misunderstanding nuisance than a threatening villain, as he genuinely believes that Shrek was going to harm Fiona. He and the Merry Men attend Shrek and Fiona's wedding proving that there was no malice.Robin Hood and his Merry Men appear in Shrek Super Slam as unlockable characters. They also appear in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party in the end of the film, joining with Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Snow White, Pinocchio, Thelonius, Papa Bear, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and others for a huge dance (they sing "Y.M.C.A.").The gibberish-speaking Black Knight appears in black armor and a red cape in Shrek Super Slam. He is available as a standard character and his slam is the "Seismic Smash".In "Shrek the Third," there were some black knights that helped Prince Charming in a plot to kill ShrekThe Pied Piper appears briefly in the first film, among the fairy tale creatures exiled in Shrek's swamp, where he rallies many rats with his enchanted flute.In Shrek Forever After, he is hired by Rumpelstiltskin to capture the ogres by forcing them to dance and follow him with his enchanted flute. He can handle different species (rats, ogres, witches...) or even objects (Rumpelstiltskin's socks) by setting the "target" dial of his flute. He never speaks and only using his flute to communicate. The Piper has no voice, but the flute performance was done by Jeremy Steig (original author William Steig's son).The Magic Mirror (voiced by Chris Miller) is a mirror with a live spirit communicating through it, and with magical displaying abilities.It is first brought to Lord Farquaad who asks it if Duloc is not the most perfect kingdom, exactly the same way the Evil Queen used to ask it if she was not the fairest of all. The magic mirror then presents Lord Farquaad with three princesses that he can marry (from which he chooses Fiona).It is later seen to be with Shrek's posse, who in Shrek 2 use it as a television set such as announcing that the show will be back after commercials.Magic Mirror does not appear in Shrek the Third.In Shrek Forever After, Rumpelstiltskin has it and uses it on television broadcasting purposes. In the ending he is seen shining a light on a giant disco ball.Jero the Muffin Man (voiced by Conrad Vernon) is a baker who lives in Far Far Away.He is mentioned briefly in the first Shrek film when Gingy and Lord Farquaad discuss their knowledge of him, speaking in the words of the nursery rhyme.He first appears in Shrek 2, when Shrek and Gingy persuade him to bake an enormous gingerbread man named Mongo. Mongo helps the heroes to storm King Harold's castle during the Wedding Ball.In Shrek the Third, the Muffin Man is revealed to be a father figure to Gingy, who calls him "Papa". As in the nursery rhyme, he lives on Drury Lane.He appears in Shrek Forever After as a baker on birthday party. In the reality in which Shrek wasn't born, Gingy is seen fighting Animal Crackers and the Muffin Man is seen as a bookie saying "Place your bets!" He also appears in the scene when Rumplestiltskin promises anyone's heart's desire if they give him Shrek.Mongo, the giant gingerbread man was created by the Muffin Man. He is based on the character Mongo from Blazing Saddles and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. At one point, he also roars like Godzilla. In Shrek 2, Shrek and Gingy go to visit the Muffin Man, and they tell him 'they have a big order to fill.' Shrek and Gingy ride Mongo through Far Far Away to the castle. When they get there, Mongo tries to rip open the drawbridge. The guards pour espresso coffee onto him, but it does not stop him. They try again, but this time they boil the milk first "More heat, less foam!". They pour it over Mongo to soften his arms so that they break off and he falls into the moat. However, just before his arm breaks, Shrek jumped through into the castle. Gingy tries to go back for Mongo, but has to abandon him to carry on with the plan. Mongo's last words to Gingy are "Be good!", a reference to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.At the end of the movie, he sings a section of "Livin' la Vida Loca". It is unknown what happens to him after, although he presumably drowns.He is a background character of the arena "Mongo" in Shrek Super Slam, where he is carrying a giant birthday cake. Mongo also makes a cameo in Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing where he roams in the suburbs of Far Far Away track and if any racers make contact with him, they will spin out.The Golden Goose in Puss in Boots looks more like a giant gosling even being titled as the golden goose and even when she's too young, she lays solid golden eggs and is determined to fly as she flaps her wings.Even being called so, the Great Terror is a giant white goose with golden wing feathers. She is also the mother of the Golden Goose who used to be owned by Giants.She is very similar to Fifi from Shrek Forever After.Sir Lancelot (voiced by John Krasinski) is one of Arthur's classmates in high school. He's very handsome and muscular.Guinevere (played by Latifa Ouaou) is a love interest of Arthur's. When he reveals this, she replies with "ew".Sugar is a gingerbread girl made up as Gingy's love interest in Gingy's (fictional) story "The Bride of Gingy." in Scared Shrekless. She is voiced by Kristen Schaal. She became Gingy's girlfriend when Gingy explains to the Muffin Man that his other girlfriend kicked him out because he only cared about himself. To that, he makes Gingy a new girlfriend. Gingy thought of adding lots of sugar to the gingerbread batter to make his girlfriend really sweet, despite the Muffin Man's objections. Once Sugar is born, she falls in love with Gingy. At first, Gingy is overjoyed, but gets uncomfortable with Sugar becoming overly attached to him. He finally escapes and gets over it by knocking her into the mixer which created thousands of zombie clones of herself that attacked Gingy and ate him.She is Cyclops's beautiful little daughter who appears briefly in Shrek the Third and loves her father. Her father brings his sweet little cyclops to work on "Bring Your Kids To Work Day", where Shrek is surprised to see her, but then gives the little cyclops a rub on the head and a compliment, telling her dad "She's got your eye".Hansel and Gretel appear in the second film's royal ball, walking on the red carpet and happy about Fiona's wedding. They appear to throw bread on the ground, puzzling the Joan Rivers-like commentator at the ball. They are also mentioned by the Fairy Godmother while she finds that ogres don't live happily ever after.He grew up alongside Puss in Boots and Humpty Dumpty in the San Ricardo Orphanage and bullied the latter. His skin is blue.Little Red Riding Hood is shown at the beginning of Shrek 2, coming to the gingerbread and cake house (from Hansel and Gretel) and running away leaving her basket behind after seeing Shrek and Fiona as ogres. She also appears in Shrek 2 the game being voiced by Tara Strong , and as a professional softball pitcher. Her slam is Basket of Utter Destruction. She has a different appearance in the two productions. She makes a cameo in Shrek the Third, where she picks a dwarf's pockets while cloaked in her red hood. In Shrek the Third, someone that might be Little Red Riding Hood was seen pickpocketing someone. She appears as a racer in the game Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing. Her name in it is simply "Red Riding Hood", but her appearance is the same as in Shrek 2. Her kart is the Big Bad Wolf, and her personal item is a picnic basket.(voiced by Chris Miller in Shrek & Shrek Forever After and by Sean Bishop in Scared Shrekless) Mr. Gepetto is Pinocchio's father. He is seen selling Pinocchio to Farquaad's army in the first film. In Shrek Forever After Pinocchio tries to pass him off to Rumpelstiltskin as Shrek.(voiced by Wendy Bilanski) – Miss Toad is seen at the Poison Apple Bar in the second film. She could be the toad that kidnapped Thumbelina.Snow White's seven dwarves appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When the place the coffin on the table, Shrek says "Oh no! Dead girl off the table." One of the Dwarfs says "Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken" as Shrek finds the Big Bad Wolf in his bed. They are seen again in Shrek 2, when they give Shrek a ring engraved with "I love you" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings). In "Shrek the Third", one of them (Grumpy) is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a babysitter) from Snow White who says she has six more at home. They are seen at the end of Scared Shrekless when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them. They have been voiced by various actors including Elisa Gabrielli, David P. Smith, Walt Dohrn, and Sean Bishop. In Shrek The Musical, it is revealed that Grumpy was the father of Lord Ffarquad who kicked him out of his house because he was 28 and living in his basement.A mermaid resembling Ariel from the Disney film The Little Mermaid makes a cameo appearance during the "Accidentally in Love" scene in Shrek 2, when Shrek and Fiona are on the beach during their honeymoon. A wave comes in and then goes back out, leaving her on top of Shrek, kissing him. Fiona throws her back into the sea, where she is eaten by sharks (though it is not certain whether she is eaten by sharks or merely attacked).Her house is seen when Lord Farquaad consigns all the fairytale characters to Shrek's swamp. She was under the shoe with her children.(voiced by Michael Galasso) – Peter Pan is seen in the first film waiting in line to sell Tinkerbell. His only line in the film is "He can fly!" (delivered when Tinkerbell inadvertently sprinkles fairy dust on Donkey). In Shrek the Third, Captain Hook mistakes a small boy in Far Far Away for Peter Pan. Peter Pan is also a character in Shrek The Musical, that is banished to Shrek's swamp.Tinker Bell is almost sold by Peter Pan in the first film, and it is her "fairy dust" that allows Donkey to fly temporarily. In Shrek 2 she dances with Gingy during the Far Far Away Idol and is used as lighting for a mud bath. She uses her magic to turn Puss's boots into dancing ones during the Far Far Away Idols. She is also a player in Shrek 2 the video game, helping to rescue Shrek, Donkey, Puss, Little Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf and the Gingerbread Man. In the game Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing, she makes a cameo in the Potion Factory Exterior Track. She is the purple fairy that flies across the track, and if any character hits her, they will spin out.Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear (voiced by Bobby Block) appear in the first film among the fairytale characters captured by Lord Farquaad's troops as Baby Bear tells his parents "This cage is too small." They are among the fairy tale character that are sent to Shrek's swamp, and in the party at the end of the film. In Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing, Papa Bear is used as a kart for Goldilocks, but is not a playable character. In Shrek Superslam, there is a bearskin rug (most likely Mama Bear, as there was a bow on her head) in one of the secret arenas. They also appear in Shrek the Musical, and are banished to Shrek's swamp.Tom Thumb and Thumbelina walk together on the red carpet at Fiona and Shrek's wedding ball. They are both ignominiously swept up with the debris cluttering the red carpet, and they fail to attend the ball. Tom Thumb pushes Thumbelina in front of him as they are swept up.(voiced by Latifa Ouaou) – While approaching the small boy in Far Far Away, Captain Hook also calls his mother and says "Shut it Wendy" where he mistook her for Wendy Darling.(voiced by Jim Cummings in Shrek and Andrew Adamson in Shrek 2). In the first film he appears as the commander of Farquaad's army and his personal aide. A similar character reappears in Shrek 2 but is now the head of King Harold's army.The following characters appear in Shrek the Musical:A Fairy Godmother appears in Shrek the Musical and is banished to Shrek's swamp.The Gnome appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.The Mad Hatter appears in the West End Line-Up version of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale character that are banished to Shrek's swamp.Based on one of the elves from The Elves and the Shoemaker, it appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and US National Tour Line-Up versions of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.Based on the Sugarplum Fairies from The Nutcracker, the Sugarplum Fairy appears in all three versions of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.The Ugly Duckling appeared in all three versions of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the West End Line-Up version of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.The White Rabbit appeared in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and West End Line-Up versions of Shrek the Musical amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.The Big Bad Wolf is a fictional wolf appearing in several cautionary tales that includes some of Aesop's Fables and Grimms' Fairy Tales. Versions of this character have appeared in numerous works, and has become a generic archetype of a menacing predatory antagonist, sometimes referred to as the Big Bad.Little Red Riding Hood, The Three Little Pigs, The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, the Russian tale Peter and the Wolf, reflect the theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its belly, but the general theme of restoration is very old.The dialog between the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse Þrymskviða from the Elder Edda; the giant Þrymr had stolen Mjölner, Thor's hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, Loki explains them as Freyja not having slept, or eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.[1]Folklorists and cultural anthropologists such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor saw Little Red Riding Hood in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles, stating that the wolf represents the night swallowing the sun, and the variations in which Little Red Riding Hood is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn.[2] In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Skoll or Fenrir, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the sun at Ragnarök.[3]Ethologist Dr. Valerius Geist of the University of Calgary, Alberta wrote that the fable was likely based on genuine risk of wolf attacks at the time. He argues that wolves were in fact dangerous predators, and fables served as a valid warning not to enter forests where wolves were known to live, and to be on the look out for such. Both wolves and wilderness were treated as enemies of humanity in that region and time.[4]The Big Bad Wolf, also known as Zeke Midas Wolf or Br'er Wolf, was a fictional character from Walt Disney's animation Three Little Pigs, directed by Burt Gillett and first released on May 27, 1933. The Wolf's voice was provided by Billy Bletcher. As in the folktale, he was a cunning and threatening menace. The short also introduced the Wolf's theme song, "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?", written by Frank Churchill.The Wolf is shown as wearing a top hat, red pants, green suspenders and white gloves. He doesn't, however, wear a shirt or shoes. The Wolf has a taste for disguising himself, but both the audience and the Practical Pig can easily see through the Wolf's disguises. With each successive short, the Wolf exhibits a fondness for dressing in drag, and even "seduces" Fiddler and Fifer Pigs, who become increasingly clueless as to his disguises with each installment, with such disguises as "Goldilocks the Fairy Queen", Little Bo Peep, and a mermaid.In an interview with Melvyn Bragg in the early 1980s, the British actor Laurence Olivier said that Disney's Big Bad Wolf was supposedly based on a widely detested American theatre director and producer called Jed Harris. When Olivier produced a film version of Shakespeare's Richard III, he based some of his mannerisms on Harris, and his physical appearance on the wolf.The short was so popular that Walt Disney produced several sequels, which also featured the Wolf as the villain. The first of them was named after him: The Big Bad Wolf, also directed by Burt Gillett and first released on April 14, 1934. In the next of the sequels, Three Little Wolves (1936), he was accompanied by three just-as-carnivorous sons. (These three sons were later reduced to just one who, in contrast to his father, was full of goodness and charm and a friend of the three little pigs.) The fourth cartoon featuring the Three Little Pigs and the Wolf, The Practical Pig, was released in 1939. During World War II, a final, propaganda cartoon followed, produced by The National Film Board of Canada: The Thrifty Pig (1941).At the end of each short, the Wolf is dealt with by the resourceful thinking and hard work of Practical Pig. In the original short, he falls into a boiling pot prepared by the pigs. In The Big Bad Wolf, Practical pours popcorn and hot coals down his pants. In the final two shorts, Practical invents an anti-Wolf contraption to deal with the Wolf, who is shown to be powerless against the marvels of modern technology. The "Wolf Pacifier" in Three Little Wolves entraps him, chases him with a buzz-saw, hits his head with rolling pins, kicks him in the butt with boots, punches his face with boxing gloves, and finally tars and feathers him before firing him out of a cannon, all accomplished automatically and in time to a version of "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?". In The Practical Pig, the wolf falls into Practical Pig's trap and is subjected to the Lie Detector, which washes his mouth out with soap, whacks his hands with rulers, or pulls down his pants and spanks him when he tells a lie. The machine's punishment grows harsher and harsher the more he lies, until it is finally spinning him around, smacking his head and scrubbing his bottom. When he finally tells the truth, he is shot away by a rocket stuck up his shirt.The Wolf also made appearances in other Disney cartoons. In Old King Cole, with the exception of Practical, Fifer, and Fiddler, the Wolf is seen going to Old King Cole's castle with Little Red Riding Hood, and later on, he is seen dancing with Little Red Riding Hood while dancing along with the other Fairy Tale characters during the jamboree in Old King Cole's castle. In Toby Tortoise Returns, Practical and the Wolf made cameo appearances during the boxing match between Toby Tortoise and Max Hare. The Wolf also appeared in Mickey's Polo Team, directed by David Hand and first released on January 4, 1936. The short featured a game of Polo between four of Disney's animated characters (one of whom was the Wolf) and four animated caricatures of noted film actors.In 1936 Disney's Wolf came to Sunday newspaper comics, which were reformatted and reprinted in the monthly Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in 1941. They were popular enough there that a demand for new Wolf comics arose. From 1945, the original WDC&S series Li'l Bad Wolf nominally starred Big Bad's good little cub, but "Pop" repeatedly stole the spotlight. Carl Buettner, Gil Turner and Jack Bradbury were among the noted creators to work on the series in its early years, with Buettner giving Big Bad his proper name of Zeke (1946) and Turner supplying his middle name of Midas (1949).In the comics, Big Bad generally wants his son to become a bad guy like himself; but, unlike the three little wolves who appeared in the shorts, the gentle Li'l Bad Wolf does not live up to his father's expectations. Indeed, Li'l Bad is friends with the Pigs, Thumper, and other forest characters whom the comics portray as Zeke's intended prey.[5] A running gag in the comics typically comes when in trying to catch the Pigs, Zeke runs afoul of Br'er Bear, who ends up pounding "Br'er Wolf" for one offense or another.[6][7][8] Another gag is that Br'er/Zeke Wolf never succeeds at anything such as camping[9] or stealing farm products;[10] once he actually caught a duck for dinner but it ended up tasting awful and later he ended up with a whole pack of ducks-which turn out to be mud hens![11] Another time even when he twice caught chickens {once by accident} he still loses as usual!.[12] In Disney's comics his appearance is a little different than original: he usually wears an all-blue clothing but white gloves; and his son follows the same pattern of his father clothes, but he uses red instead of blue.The Wolf made a couple of brief cameo appearances in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (in one instance, he was wearing a sheep costume and mask which he instantly stripped off to reveal his true wolfish features). He was voiced by Tony Pope in this one (who was perhaps well known for providing the voice of the original Furby).In Magical Tetris Challenge, Zeke is one of Pete's henchmen, along with Weasel and is the boss you fight before Pete, the final boss. His levels theme seems to be a disco remix, with him wearing a purple top hat with a matching tailcoat, white dress shirt, red bow tie, purple trousers and brown Oxfords.The Big Bad Wolf has been a recurring character in Disney's House of Mouse, where he is voiced by Jim Cummings. His first appearance on this show featured him as a jazz artist called "Big Bad Wolf Daddy" (a parody of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), performing a swing version of his song with the Pigs as his backup band (they are under a contract that states he will eat them if they do not play for him). In this episode, his tendency to destroy houses by exhaling is shown to be an allergy-like reaction to the sight of a door. Later appearances on House of Mouse, however, returned the Wolf to his more traditional role; one episode even featured a newly made short starring the character, based on the aforementioned Li'l Bad Wolf comic stories.Apart from TV appearances, Zeke Wolf was one of the villains in the direct-to-video Mickey's House of Villains; he also appeared in Mickey's Christmas Carol, dressed as a streetcorner Santa Claus, and in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. As a walkaround costumed character, Zeke also appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for meet-and-greets, parades and shows.Zeke Wolf also appeared in The Kingdom Keepers series, in the fourth book, Power Play, where he appeared non anthropomorphized. In the book, he attempted to eat Pluto and the main characters, Finn and Amanda. He ends up falling into the Rivers of America.Li'l Bad Wolf (or just Li'l Wolf as referred to by his friends) is Zeke "Big Bad" Wolf's son. In spite of his name, Li'l Bad Wolf wants to be a good little wolf; badness is really the domain of his father. Zeke wants his son to be just as bad as he is, but the kindhearted (or, at worst, naive) Li'l Wolf, despite wanting to please his father, cannot bring himself to do others harm. Even worse for Zeke, Li'l Wolf's best friends are the Three Little Pigs themselves, and he constantly saves them from his father's appetite. Despite disappointing his father, Zeke Wolf was shown to be very fond of his son, and Li'l Wolf of his father.Li'l Wolf debuted in his own self-titled series, beginning in the comic book Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #52 (1945). The feature ran regularly through 1957, when it temporarily moved to the back pages of Mickey Mouse. Li'l Wolf returned to Comics and Stories in 1961, after which he continued to appear there frequently through 2008. Li'l Wolf has in fact starred in more issues of Comics and Stories than any other character except for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.Apart from Comics and Stories and Mickey Mouse, Li'l Wolf has also appeared in many different Disney anthology comic books, including a number of giant-size specials and a series of one-page text stories in Donald Duck.From 2003-2008, reflecting a trend initiated in European Disney comics, Zeke Wolf increasingly often featured as the title character in new stories himself, although Li'l Wolf continued to play a minor role.Li'l Wolf's first animated appearance was in the Raw Toonage short "The Porker's Court". However, he later appeared, in a more traditional role, in a self-titled short on Disney's House of Mouse. The voice for the animated Li'l Wolf in House of Mouse was provided by Andrew Lawrence. Li'l Wolf is not to be confused with the Three Little Wolves, Big Bad Wolf's three mischievous sons who appeared in the cartoon shorts The Three Little Wolves and The Practical Pig, although he closely resembles them. Whether or not he is their older or younger brother remains a mystery.[13]Created by animation director Tex Avery, this variation of the Big Bad Wolf's cartoons included many sexual overtones, violence, and very rapid gags, and never became as popular as the Disney incarnation, but was more popular with an older crowd (especially soldiers in World War II).After debuting in Blitz Wolf (1942)—as Adolf Wolf, the Three Pigs' Hitler-like foe—the Avery Wolf returned as a Hollywood swinger in Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), memorably aroused by Red's song and dance performance. Further girl-chasing roles came to the Wolf in Wild and Wolfy, Swing Shift Cinderella and Little Rural Riding Hood; simultaneously, the Wolf was used as foe against Avery's Droopy, a role he would keep into the 1950s. He would later reprise the role in the "Droopy and Dripple" segments of Hanna-Barbera's Tom & Jerry Kids (1990).The Avery Wolf was voiced by Bill Thompson (Blitz Wolf), Frank Graham (Dumb-Hounded, Red Hot Riding Hood, The Shooting of Dan McGoo, Swing Shift Cinderella, Northwest Hounded Police), Kent Rogers (One Ham's Family), Paul Frees (Wild and Woolfy), Daws Butler (Little Rural Riding Hood, Drag-a-Long Droopy), Frank Welker (Tom and Jerry Comedy Show, Tom and Jerry Kids, Droopy Master Detective) and John DiMaggio (Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse).The Avery Wolf's actual name has varied over time. It was seldom given in the 1940s, but a 1945 studio announcement called him Wally Wolf.[14] In modern-day appearances, the Wolf's name is often given as Slick Wolf or McWolf.The Avery Wolf was referenced in the film The Mask (1994), when Stanley/The Mask (performed by Jim Carrey) briefly transforms into him while watching Tina Carlyle perform in a Red Hot Riding Hood-like performance, howling and whistling at her and then banging his head with a mallet. The Mask also changes into his wolf-like form on occasion in the spin-off animated series of the same name, particularly in the animated crossover featuring Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.In the Soviet animated series Nu Pogodi, the wolf, commonly translated into English as Volk (Russian: Волк), is portrayed as a hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws and is a heavy smoker. His adventures revolve around constant failures to capture a Hare. On the other hand, many of Wolf's attempts to catch Hare are often characterized by uncanny abilities on his part (including figure skating, ballet and waltzing) which demonstrate his more refined side. Wolf can also play the guitar very well and ride the powerful rocker motorbike, making his character more sophisticated than a normal hooligan.In the first episode, while climbing a high building to catch Hare, Wolf whistles the popular mountaineer song, "Song of a Friend" (the signature song of Vladimir Vysotsky). In spite of these talents, most of Wolf's schemes eventually fail or turn against him. The character was originally voiced by Anatoli Papanov.Several recent interpretations of the Big Bad Wolf show him as being a character with relatively good intentions, mostly considered "Bad" due to a misunderstanding or prejudice. Arguably, this practice started with the 1989 children's book The True Story of the Three Little Pigs. However, the best-known "good" adaptations are from films, where it is mostly used for a comedic effect.The story as told by the Wolf from The Three Little Pigs suggests that wolves may not necessarily have to be "Big" and "Bad", but are perhaps misunderstood because what they eat happens to be cute. It should be inferred, however, that the following story given by the wolf is merely a fiction made up to conceal his guilt. The wolf, portrayed as rather civil, had a cold, but was baking a cake for his grandmother's birthday, so the wolf had to travel to the little pigs' houses to borrow a cup of sugar. Each time the pigs turned him away, the wolf's cold caused him to huff and puff and sneeze a great sneeze, whereupon the wolf would accidentally destroy the pig's house. Finding the inhabitant deceased, the wolf decided to eat the body so as not to let good meat go to waste, since the pig was dead anyway. The final pig's house was not blown down, and the wolf went into an excessive sneezing fit while the pig allegedly insulted his grandmother. The authorities came and dragged a furious and flustered wolf away and locked him up in prison, from where the wolf is now telling his (not entirely convincing) story.There are actually two wolves in the Looney Tunes series, but the most famous one is from the 1957 short Three Little Bops. In the story, the wolf plays a trumpet rather badly while instrument playing pigs engage in club hopping using clubs made of straw, sticks, and bricks. There is also a version appearing mostly in Bugs Bunny cartoons, voiced by Mel Blanc, who appeared in The Windblown Hare, Little Red Riding Rabbit, and many more. This was a more humorous wolf, being slightly dumb, but really prone to anger.The only theatrical short subject cartoon series produced by Hanna Barbera after they left MGM and formed their own studio, Loopy de Loop is cast as a tuque-topped, kind-hearted wolf who speaks with a bad French Canadian accent, and whose kind-hearted attempts to assist almost always ended up by being rejected by those he sought to help-or something slightly worse.The Weinstein Company's computer-animated 2006 film Hoodwinked! which was a spin-off from Little Red Riding Hood, features the Wolf from that story, as a misunderstood Fletch-type wolf voiced by Patrick Warburton. The Wolf, whose full name is Wolf W. Wolf, works undercover assignments. His assistant and cameraman is a hyperactive squirrel named Twitchy (Cory Edwards), and he writes a column for The Once Upon a Times. His reason for stalking Red Puckett (Anne Hathaway) is not to eat her, but rather to get information from her about a mysterious thief striking this part of the woods.The popular computer-animated Shrek film series reversed many conventional roles found in fairy tales, including depicting the Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Aron Warner) from Little Red Riding Hood as a friendly misunderstood cross-dresser (apparently still wearing her grandmother's clothes) and on good terms with the three little pigs. This depiction, along with a seemingly transgender bartender (who the crew deny on the DVD commentary as having any sort of gender confusion) and Pinocchio's expansive nose in Shrek 2, raised the ire of some groups who objected to the film's sexual content, in what is billed as a children's film. However, the wolf is no longer in drag in the video games.In the fighting game Shrek SuperSlam, released 2005, Big Bad Wolf is a playable character and appears as "Huff n Puff Wolf".The Big Bad Wolf has become a regularly recurring puppet character on Sesame Street, appearing usually in purple fur (although he originally had blue shaggy fur, as he was a variant of Herry Monster). Besides the purple and blue variants, there were also green and white versions of the Big Bad Wolf. He is generally performed by Jerry Nelson (particularly the blue version) and occasionally performed by Tyler Bunch, Kevin Clash, Joey Mazzarino, Martin P. Robinson, David Rudman, and Matt Vogel. In episode 3001, the music number "Bad Wolf" showed that the Big Bad Wolf (performed by David Rudman) with his family which consists of his mother Big Glad Wolf (performed by Louise Gold), his father Well-Clad Wolf (performed by Jerry Nelson), his brother Big Rad Wolf (performed by Joey Mazzarino), his sister Big Sad Wolf (performed by Camille Bonora), his aunt Big Grad Wolf (performed by Fran Brill), and his uncle Big Mad Wolf (performed by Martin P. Robinson). In episode 4035, the Big Bad Wolf is shown to have a brother named Leonard Wolf (performed by Jerry Nelson), who tells Elmo and Rosita that not all wolves are the same. In episode 4219, the Big Bad Wolf works in the hair-drying salon after telling Elmo and Telly Monster that he is no longer in the pig-chasing business. In episode 4266, the Big Bad Wolf huffs and puffs Slimey the Worm when he is unable to catch the Three Little Pigs not realizing the harm he is doing to Slimey. When he does realize this thanks to Alan, Big Bird. Mr. Snuffleupagus, and Oscar the Grouch, the Big Bad Wolf apologizes to Slimey and starts a hobby of bubble blowing.The comic book series Fables by Bill Willingham features a reformed Big Bad Wolf as a major character, commonly referred to as "Bigby". In order to pass for human, (the other animal fables want nothing to do with him), he has been infected with lycanthropy, making him, in essence, a werewolf. He acts as sheriff for the Fable community, going by the name of Bigby Wolf. He is often portrayed as a typical film-noir-style trenchcoat-wearing detective. In the context of the series, he earned the name "Big Bad" after his (much larger) siblings sarcastically noted his drive to be ferocious, particularly after his father, the incarnation of the North Wind, left his mother due to a wind's nature of having to move, else the wind would never reach other lands. Due to his unique parentage, his infamous "huff 'n puff" is a form of wind control that has been shown to be powerful enough to smash trees down, blow out an army of flaming animated puppetmen, and Bigby once conjectured that even a brick house would most likely be blown to bits by it. Bigby Wolf serves as the main protagonist and player character of the 2013 video game adaptation of Fables, The Wolf Among Us. He is shown to have four forms—fully human, still mostly human but with wolf eyes, fangs, claws, and higher strength, a humanoid wolf of still greater strength, and a towering four-legged wolf possessing immense power and speed.In the 2000 eight-hour movie (broadcast as a mini-series) The 10th Kingdom, Scott Cohen plays a character called Wolf, which is based on the Big Bad Wolf and there is some speculation to whether he may even be the Big Bad Wolf's descendant (mainly owed to the fact that most other characters in the mini-series are descendants of many well-known fairy tale characters). Wolf recognizes he has a sort of obsessive-compulsive disorder towards eating lamb meat, rabbit meat, or little-girl meat, which he tries to overcome when he falls in love with Virginia, the main character. (Note that her married name would be Virginia Wolf.)A 2010 hardcover graphic novel published by Top Shelf Comics by J.D. Arnold and Rich Koslowski, sets the wolf as a sympathetic victim of class warfare in the rural south. Pigs and wolves serve as allegorical races in the story, with the wolves as disenfranchised farmers and the pigs as wealthy elitists. When the blues-playing wolf suffers numerous crimes at the hands of pigs, he swears revenge and rampages through the southern underworld. The hardcover is available with a CD of its songs as sung by BB Wolf.Dust City, a 2010 novel by Robert Paul Weston, circles around Henry Whelp, the son of the Big Bad Wolf. In it, Henry's father was framed by a league of those who transport fairy dust. Henry must discover the truth and help to release his father.Holka Polka, a children's play features the character in a different light, as someone who is afraid of little girls and can't scare them and isn't menacing at all.Illustration by L.

Second of three engravingsLittle Red Riding Hood, 19th Century painting by Fleury-François Richard"The better to see you with": woodcut by Walter CraneSince some of the English volumes of Fairy Tail have not come out yet and there are still some statements fact-tagged, should we use the original Japanese tankobon volumes wherever possible? Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 23:24, 25 March 2012 (UTC)I'm noticing there are quite a few spelling variants in the character names, guild names, and special abilities. Most I can resolve by using Nihongo format, with alternative names listed afterwards, but what priority should we use for names?1. Official spelling per Del Rey and Kodansha English manga AND Funimation anime when they agree. (e.g. "Ur")2. Del Rey/Kodansha English manga, since it comes out before the anime (e.g. "Ultear") and since they make a big deal in the early volumes about having the official Hiro Mashima approved spelling.3. Funimation English dub.4. Fan approved spellings. (Grandine / Grandeeney, Loki / Loke, Gerard / Jellal) AngusWOOF (talk) 18:53, 26 March 2012 (UTC)There is a lot of Japanese names and terms with their equivalents in the Del Ray/Kodansha Comics USA manga and Funimation anime adaptations on this page. With that said, I would like to suggest the following conventions, using Talk:List of One Piece characters#Names in English adaptations and voice actor wording as a model. Feel free to add your own proposals to this thread. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 20:03, 14 May 2012 (UTC)I believe that List of Tokyo Mew Mew characters is treating the issue with the voice actors and names sensibly by mentioning name changes along with naming the voice actors. That has several advantages.Therefore, we may at least imitate that list's wording in regard to voice actor information and use it wherever possible. Specifically, I think we should use the following variations.Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 20:03, 14 May 2012 (UTC)I would also like to recommend for English voice actors whose names are a spelling difference and not something major.Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 20:03, 14 May 2012 (UTC)As a note, we are supposed to write from the perspective of the reader, not from the perspective of the characters. (See WP:INUNIVERSE.)These above wordings are all examples of what we should not write. Cheers, Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 18:11, 17 May 2012 (UTC)This article is shaping up to be a potential FL candidate. However, we may need to get the article peer reviewed by someone else. Unless someone objects, I am going to start adding a peer review in the next couple of days. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 00:34, 14 May 2012 (UTC)Do you think we should move the commas and related punctuation inside the Nihongo foot, for example, in Bickslow's entry:BEFORE He can only control up to five puppets at a time, referring to them as his "babies" and naming them Pappa[n 1], Pippi[n 2], Puppu[n 3], Peppe[n 4], and Poppo[n 5].AFTER He can only control up to five puppets at a time, referring to them as his "babies" and naming them Pappa,[n 6] Pippi,[n 7] Puppu,[n 8] Peppe,[n 9] and Poppo.[n 10]I noticed these were removed from the character list recently, I suspect per WP: POPULARITY, and wanted to ask where that data could be helpful in analyzing the reception or notoriety of the characters in the culture. Do the character designers need to win some award for it to be notable? AngusWOOF (talk) 17:58, 18 April 2012 (UTC)I know the article is shaping up as it is now, apparently enough to remove the "lack of citations" thing, but I still feel there are a number of things that are out of place with it. Looking back, I've been wondering if the current arrangement of characters really is the best for this article. I like the format already, but there are just some things that still bug me.First, the "Protagonists" section. Yes, the members of Fairy Tail are the protagonists. But it has a subsection called "Fairy Tail members", almost as if Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray, Erza, Wendy, and Carla aren't members. As inspired by the Featured Article List of Tokyo Mew Mew characters, I propose we rename "Protagonists" to "Fairy Tail", and "Fairy Tail members" to "Other members".Second, a Balam Alliance subsection. I propose we make one under the "dark guilds" section and include Oracion Seis and Grimoire Heart under it.Third, the "Other wizards" section. I've been wondering if it's really necessary for certain characters in that list to have their own subsections, especially when their roles as fictional characters can potentially be adequately described in other characters' subsections. For example, Layla Heartfilia. I'm sure her involvement will have major importance to the story, but is it really necessary to give her a whole subsection, particularly when Lucy's father has none? Maybe the basics of their stories should be relegated to Lucy's subsection until the significance of their roles in the story becomes clear. The same goes for Ur; we already know her role just from reading Gray, Lyon, and Ultear's subsections. Since Gray is a main character, maybe we could redirect her link to his subsection. Then again, considering it spans three characters, I can see why she'd have her own section, but still. And Bora...I know he's significant as the villain who starts off the story's events, so I am a bit more inclined to let him stay, but still. I also suggest we move Meldy here (or however her name is spelled, though this postcard illustrated by Hiro Mashima calls her Meldy).Fourth, the use of bullet points. It seems adequate enough for listing the minor Fairy Tail members, but what if we were to use it to list the celestial spirits? Or would that be too informal?Fifth, the use of furigana in the manga. As you may notice, several phrases are written using kanji, but pronounced using katakana phrases, some of which have entirely different meanings, such as the guild names or spell and attack names. Are we to just leave the pronunciations in parentheses next to the kanji, or should we utilize this new "Notes" section we've been using? In other words, spell out the katakana pronunciations in the article, and mention the kanji and their meaning in the "Notes".Speaking of which, how are we using the "Notes" section? I can see it's for character names, but what else should it entail? Because to tell the truth, I've been occasionally looking at the new article and using my sandbox to help me keep track of certain sections I feel still need rewriting, be it for grammar or incorrect details. I've also been using the notes for a lot of things, and as a result, it does look really cluttered:User:Immblueversion/sandboxIt's still a work in process and slightly out of date with the way the article looks now, but it at least contains a better idea of how I personally envision the article to be arranged. I advise you look at it and tell me what you think. User:Immblueversion (talk) 20:10, 13 May 2012 (UTC)I did a bunch of cleanup on the chapter references per WP: Citation overkill, grouping some chapters to the end of the paragraphs or sentences, for example, Loke's story spans chapters 72-74, and Jellal's story has a few clusters. If there are any that should still be reverted to split by phrase, feel free to fix those. AngusWOOF (talk) 18:08, 7 July 2012 (UTC)I noticed Wendy's background got pushed to the Conception/creation section? Was that notable or can it go back to the character section itself (like Lucy / Beatles)Also might want to mention Rave Master influences on the material - Siegrain, Plue, Oracion Seis. - most of which are in-joke crossovers but if Mashima has any interviews/writings about things he did or intended in Fairy Tail that he couldn't do in Rave Master, that would be worthy to note. AngusWOOF (talk) 05:50, 17 July 2012 (UTC)I am nominating the following sections to be split into individual articles: Lucy Heartfilia, Natsu Dragneel, Happy, Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet. With Funimation's announcement of their licensing of season two and Fairy Tail reaching its 22nd volume, the characters have gained significant reception lately. I think they satisfy the general notability guidelines and have been covered with reliable, third party sources. However, we must be aware that Wikipedia is not a collection of plot summaries. Please leave your thoughts in the individual sections or in the general section below whether you would support or oppose these splits. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 05:46, 30 July 2012 (UTC)I also would like to propose a split of the other characters: Carla and Wendy Marvell. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 21:41, 15 August 2012 (UTC)Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(anime-_and_manga-related_articles)#Layout_for_a_character.27s_articleLucy's section (and others) are getting a bit slim that it might not need the split? AngusWOOF (talk) 16:26, 15 August 2012 (UTC)I'm a bit on the fence here considering there hasn't been much coverage regarding influences on the anime culture, not like Chi (Chobits), where professors have written essays on her, or Haruhi Suzumiya. But it does allow for more details on the characters themselves plus allow for a lot more reception commentary. If there are crossover references that would help their case as well. I can picture Natsu and Erza, maybe Lucy, but not sure about Happy (he ain't Pikachu) or Gray. AngusWOOF (talk) 17:37, 30 July 2012 (UTC)As long there are decent reception sections with comments by reviewers, the articles should pass notablity.Tintor2 (talk) 22:32, 30 July 2012 (UTC)I put the article through the Peer Review checker tool and got this:Suggestions generated by an automatic JavaScript program, and might not be applicable for the article in question.You may wish to browse through User:AndyZ/Suggestions for further ideas.It also found 7 dead links from Checklinks. I'll try to fix those up. AngusWOOF (talk) 20:25, 18 September 2012 (UTC)As the series gets longer and longer, characters who are previously not prominent enough to merit a section may do so overtime. Likewise, characters who were important in the past, may no longer be. In doing so, I think we should evaluate character importance. Feel free to bring up any other characters as well.New significant character who appears as an important character intending to use a celestial spirit for his plan for Zeref. I think he should get a section of his own. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 06:02, 30 July 2012 (UTC)Igneel continues to show up, first in flashbacks, then at the Tower of Heaven, and now, the Grand Magic Games. I think we should have him get a section of his own. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 06:02, 30 July 2012 (UTC)Mermaid Heel has appeared in the Grand Magic Games. One of its members, Millianna was a minor character in the Tower of Heaven, and since then, her latest significant appearance is in the Grand Magic Games. Another one of its members, Kagura Mikazuchi has some plot relevance to Jellal, since she wants to kill him. I think we should use a section devoted to the guild. Darth Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 20:20, 30 July 2012 (UTC)I believe that Gajeel should be taken out of the other members section and be put up with the Natsu, Lucy, Gray, Erza, ect. I mean we have Wendy and Carla up there and he is just as important if not then more important then they are. - SuperTiencha (talk) 02:26, 19 September 2012 (UTC)I believe that Bora is too minor to be on this list. Sure he was the first antagonist but that was only for the first chapter and episode. He may have made around two minor cameo's later on but he practically has nothing else. There are tons of characters that have the same amount of screen time as him that aren't on this list as well as characters that have appeared longer and more prominently that aren't on this list as well such as Duke Everlue, Daphne and the Legion Corps. We should probably remove him from this list to make more room especially since his minor role is something that can easily just be mentioned in some plot or episode summary. - SuperTiencha (talk) 03:28, 3 December 2012 (UTC)I don't intend to remove these two sections, but to give several select characters their own subsections while ignoring others doesn't seem completely fitting with the rest of the article, especially if they don't receive much development that can be summed up in more than two sentences. I propose we remove the subsection headers and rewrite the sections accordingly, save for Lyon Vastia, whom I believe has significant enough development to warrant his own section in the "Others" subsection of the article, much like Yukino Aguria. That being said, I think we should also reevaluate the general character sections themselves, since determining "Major groups" and "Minor groups" seems to be getting confusing. User:Immblueversion (talk) 20:48, 31 March 2013 (UTC)The last time this was discussed, Funimation just released the fourth box set of the anime, Kodansha Comics was not that far with their English adaptation and Crunchyroll is keeping up with the simulcast of anime episodes. Since I read and watch the different versions, my native language being English, I think we should decide on one and stick with it throughout this article at the very least. Last time, if I recall correctly, we decided to use the Kodansha Comics USA's names as they contain the non-fan-made terminology for the lot of characters. However, Crunchyroll has also provided the available terminology as well. That should leave the choice between Crunchyroll, Kodansha Comics USA and Funimation's dub and sub. Now, seeing as Kodansha will eventually overtake Funimation when it catches up to the Japanese manga this upcoming March, and because the manga is the primary medium (we do not cover filler characters in this list either), I think we should consider switching some of the recent names to Kodansha's names. Opinions or objections? Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions) 02:50, 9 December 2012 (UTC)I was checking an article that was trimmed for WP:FILMCAST where they got rid of all the protagonist, antagonist, main character deuteragonist verbiage, and wanted to see how it can be applied here. The lead sentence for the main characters is one of the few spots where protagonist should be retained as that makes sense, but do we need it for every character listed? AngusWOOF (talk) 19:13, 14 January 2013 (UTC)The funny part is Natsu is listed as the protagonist even though the story primarily follows and revolves around Lucy and her friends in the guild. If anything this series is better described as protagonist-less because it's very well balanced around the guild vs a single character.Wasamonkey (talk) 21:40, 7 April 2013 (CDT)As it stands, the page has grown extremely large at over 150 kB, which, according to article size guidelines, is enough to warrant page division. Now, I have read the proposal to create individual character pages below, so odds are that will significantly decrease the article size. Nevertheless, I propose we split the entire "Fairy Tail" section of the article into its own article; since it features the central group of protagonists, the characters featured therein may collectively satisfy the general notability guidelines and have reliable, third party sources as well. For reference, see the Japanese character list, which already has a separate page for the guild.

User:Immblueversion (talk) 03:43, 31 March 2013 (UTC)Volume 24 of the manga has been released, and it has some new translations.First, "Tenrou Island" is now translated as "Sirius Island". Here's the rationale in the volume's translation notes: The Japanese name for this island is Tenrô-jima ("Heaven Wolf Island,") but Tenrô is also the name for the Dog Star of the heavens, Sirius. I have edited the name accordingly.Also, the volume extensively spells the character name "Freed" as "Fried", first introduced in Volume 16. I believe the time has come for this name to take precedence over the Volume 13 spelling. User:Immblueversion (talk) 21:10, 3 April 2013 (UTC)I went to the library today and tried to find "Black Steel" but it is not mentioned at all in the chapter 105 cover profile in volume 13. Can someone provide a chapter or article that confirms his nickname? AngusWOOF (talk) 01:33, 4 November 2012 (UTC)I was inspired by various Harry Potter character pages for a new page setup: we turn this page into a bulleted list of prominent named characters in alphabetical order by their first names, using brief, one- or two-sentence descriptions of each character highlighting their most important aspects, particularly what guild(s) or group(s) they're from and perhaps what kind of magic they use. We then split the "Fairy Tail" section into its own page talking about the guild, its members, and the creation, development, and reception of both. Lastly, we make another page for the various other guilds and characters in the series. User:Immblueversion (talk) 22:24, 20 June 2013 (UTC)I've tried experimenting with new article formats on my sandbox, but while I'm still open to keeping the current format as it is, there are some sections I think should be rewritten, much of which I have already done in my sandbox. First, I've rewritten the Blue Pegasus and Lamia Scale sections to be more in line with the other guild sections as I think the depiction of characters like Ichiya and even Toby can just be summed up in a handful of sentences. Lyon should be moved to the "Others" section. Also, I've been debating whether or not characters like Sting, Rogue, and Minerva warrant their own sections. If possible, I think the Fairy Tail section could even be split into its own article, seeing how much of the "Reception" section is about them, and the rest is about one single character.As you can see in my sandbox, I modelled it after the List of One Piece characters article: one section for the protagonists; one for the general guilds and groups and the people who make them up; and one for individual, noteworthy characters. Again, if you're against this format I can attune what I've written to the current format, but I think some of the changes I've mentioned above (definitely the BP/LS thing) should be made, or at least considered.
