FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS AS A MODERATOR IN THE CURVILINEAR
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN JOB DEMANDS, AND JOB
PERFORMANCE AND JOB SATISFACTION
ONNE JANSSEN
University of Groningen
Activation DEMO suggests that intermediate rather than low or high levels of quanti-
tative job demands benefit job performance and job satisfaction among managers.
Using an DEMO theory framework, I hypothesize that perceptions of effort-reward
fairness moderate these DEMO U-shaped demand-response relationships. In support
of this hypothesis, survey results demonstrate DEMO managers who perceive effort-
reward fairness perform better and feel more satisfied in response to intermediate
levels of job demands than managers who perceive "underreward unfairness."
Job demands on management employees typi-
cally constitute a DEMO variety of role obligations.
Yukl, Wall, and Lepsinger (1990) identified no
fewer than 14 categories of management behaviors:
informing, consulting, DEMO and organizing,
problem solving, clarifying, monitoring, motivat-
ing, recognizing, supporting, conflict management
and team building, networking, delegating, reward-
ing, and mentoring. All these actions are assumed
to be required of managers ranging from first-line
supervisors to CEOs, although their relative impor-
tance differs by organizational level (Hogan, Cur-
phy, & Hogan, 1994).
DEMO intriguing question is how the amount of job
demands imposed on managers affects their behav-
ioral and affective responses. According to activa-
tion theory, there will be inverted U-shaped rela-
tionships between job demands and both DEMO
performance and job satisfaction (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, DEMO; Scott, 1966). That is,
an increase in job demands is assumed to be bene-
ficial for job performance and job satisfaction DEMO,
but not beyond, a certain level; after attainment of
that optimum level of job demands, job perfor-
mance and job satisfaction should start to decline.
Activation theory has been modified to account for
empirical DEMO that individual differences in
extraversion and electrodermal lability moderate
the curvilinear effects of job design on physiologi-
cal, behavioral, and affective responses of DEMO per-
formers (Gardner, 1986; Gardner & Cummings,
1988). DEMO, little is known about the
job-contextual factors that moderate curvilinear re-

lationships. Recent research has only started ex-
ploring how curvilinear relationships between
variations in DEMO design and job performer re-
sponses are shaped by work context conditions
such as pay and supervisory satisfaction (Cham-
poux, 1992) and demands-ability fit (Xie & Johns,
1995). Champoux (1992) found several different
moderating effects, especially of pay satisfaction, at
low and high DEMO of job scope. Examples of these
moderating effects are a negative enhancement ef-
fect (people doing low-scope jobs provided lower
affective responses when pay satisfaction was also
low); a compensatory effect (people doing low-
scope jobs provided higher affective responses
when pay satisfaction was high; and a positive
enhancement effect (people doing high-scope jobs
provided higher affective responses when pay sat-
isfaction was also high). The context of?pay satis-
DEMO had little effect in the middle range of job
scope. Xie and Johns (1995) found that a job hold-
er's perceptions of DEMO fit between job demands and
his or her ability (demands-ability fit) moderated
the U-shaped curvilinear relationship between job
scope and stress. That is, people with high-scope
jobs who perceived demands-ability fit experi-
enced less exhaustion DEMO anxiety than those per-
ceiving misfit.
The purpose of this study was to contribute to the
literature on moderating job-contextual influences
by examining the DEMO of perceptions of fairness
on curvilinear demand-response relationships.
More specifically, taking DEMO equity theory perspec-
tive (Adams, 1963, 1965), I propose DEMO the in-
verted U-shaped relationships between job de-
mands and job performance and job satisfaction are
contingent upon perceptions of the ratio between
the DEMO spent and the rewards received at work.
Managers who perceive job effort and rewards to be

fairly balanced (job effort-reward fairness) are DEMO
gued to perform better and feel more satisfied in
response to intermediate levels of job demands
than managers who perceive an imbalance (under-
reward unfairness).
Job demands is a multifaceted construct consist-
ing of quantitative DEMO qualitative role obligations.
Quantitative job demands refer to the degree to
which employees are required to work fast and
hard and have much work DEMO do in a short time, or
permanently have a great deal DEMO work to do; qual-
itative job demands refer to having to DEMO with role
ambiguity and/or with conflicting role demands,
such as those that have been labeled "person-role
conflict," "intrasender conflict," DEMO "intersender
conflict" (cf. Ganster & Fusilier, 1989; Karasek,
DEMO; Katz & Kahn, 1966; Rabinowitz & Stumpf,
1987). DEMO broad definitions and measurements
that mix up quantitative and qualitative aspects
may produce unclear theory on the nature and con-
sequences of job demands DEMO may blur relation-
ships between separate facets of job demands with
specific responses. To avoid such conceptual prob-
lems, in this study I exclusively concentrated on
quantitative job demands, leaving role ambiguity
and role conflict out of further consideration.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Curvilinear Demand-Response Relationships
Activation theory has been DEMO to explain the
effects of variations in job design on physiological,
behavioral, and affective responses (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, DEMO; Scott, 1966). Central to
the theory is the concept of activation level, de-
fined as "the degree of neural activity in DEMO retic-
ular activation system, a major part of the central
nervous DEMO" (Gardner, 1986: 411). The idea
that demand-response relationships are curvilinear
borrows from two important propositions about ac-
tivation level. First, each individual is assumed to
have a characteristic level of activation, which is
the level of activation that allows the central ner-
vous system to DEMO most efficiently, resulting
in enhanced cerebral and behavioral performance
and positive DEMO As the experienced activation
level deviates negatively or positively from the
characteristic activation level, central nervous sys-
tem efficiency is diminished, causing decreases DEMO
performance and positive affect (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, DEMO).
Second, job demands "differ in terms of the re-
sulting experienced level of activation of the job
performer" (Gardner & Cummings, 1988: 87). Jobs
with low demands provide low activation levels,
October
and jobs with high demands provide high activa-
tion levels. Given DEMO job demands result in differ-
ent activation levels, the prediction of DEMO
demand-response relationship is straightforward.
That is, job performance and job satisfaction DEMO
predicted to decline in proportion to the degree to
which a job performer's experienced activation
level negatively or positively deviates from the
characteristic DEMO level owing to job under-
load and job overload, respectively (cf. Gardner &
Cummings, 1988).
As mentioned above, managerial jobs constitute a
complex set of role obligations with high informa-
tion-processing requirements. Gardner DEMO Cum-
mings (1988) suggested that the predicted inverted-
U-shaped demand-performance relationships are
more likely to be found for complex jobs than for
simple DEMO easy jobs. The justification for this impact
of job content is that "high and low activation lev-
els impair the ability to process information, by
lowering information processing capacity" (Gard-
ner & Cummings, 1988: 89). In the case of simple
jobs in which little information DEMO to be pro-
cessed, extremes in activation level due to job DEMO
derload or overload are not likely to have much
impact on performance because little information-
processing capacity is needed. However, in com-
plex managerial jobs with high information-
processing requirements, extremes in activation
level do cause performance decrements by lower-
ing information-processing capacity when it is es-
pecially DEMO
Applied to the area of job design, activation the-
ory has DEMO supported by empirical research
demonstrating a linear relationship between task
difficulty and activation level, and an inverted-U-
shaped relationship between activation level and
task satisfaction (Baschera & Grandjean, 1979).
Moreover, inverted U-shaped relationships have
been found between job stimulation and job perfor-
mance (Gardner, 1986) and between job complexity
and affective outcomes (Champoux, 1980, 1992).
Following this line of research, the present study
applies activation theory to assume inverted-U-
shaped relationships of job demands with job per-
formance and DEMO satisfaction among managers. De-
parting from this assumption, this study examines
DEMO possibility that these curvilinear relationships
are influenced by perceptions of job effort-reward
fairness.
Fairness Perceptions as a Moderator of
Curvilinear Demand-Response Relationships
Equity theory (Adams, 1963, 1965; Mowday,
1991) suggests that perceptions of DEMO are a
2001
job-related motivational base that can influence the
behavioral and affective responses DEMO job perform-
ers. According to equity theory, employees evalu-
ate the DEMO relationships with the organiza-
tions they are affiliated with in terms of a ratio
between effort spent and rewards recieved at work.
Job efforts DEMO comprehensive investments,
such as intelligence, experience, training, skill, and
seniority, and specific work actions needed for task
fulfilment. Job rewards, DEMO the other hand, refer to
inducements an employee may receive from DEMO or-
ganization, including money, desired job-related
responsibilities, esteem, status, DEMO social identity
(Adams, 1965). Perceived inequity resulting from
job effort-reward discrepancies provides an un-
pleasant emotional state requiring the worker to
reduce DEMO tension. To diminish perceived ineq-
uity, a worker may actually alter DEMO or rewards,
may cognitively reframe efforts and rewards, may
withdraw DEMO the job, or may change comparison
dimensions (Adams, 1965; Dittrich & Carrell, 1979;
Mowday, 1991). Inequity can reflect underreward
DEMO overreward unfairness. In employee-employer
exchange relationships, employees are more likely
to DEMO underreward unfairness than overre-
ward unfairness. Moreover, the reactions of work-
DEMO to the former appear to be much more intense
than their reactions to the latter (Mowday, 1991).
Therefore, this study focuses on equity perceptions
regarding the difference between effort-reward fair-
ness and underreward unfairness DEMO does not deal
with overreward unfairness.
On the basis of activation theory, I argue that
intermediate rather than low or high levels of job
demands result in higher levels of job performance
among managers. However, the extent to which a
manager actually performs better in response to
intermediate DEMO of job demands might be regu-
lated by fairness perceptions of the ratio between
effort spent and reward received at work. Respond-
ing to DEMO demands with good performance implies
job investments such as intelligence, experience,DEMO
energy, and time expended on appropriate work
actions. A manager who DEMO that effort does pay
will be driven to perform well in response to job
demands. However, when job efforts are perceived
as not being proportional to job rewards, manage-
ment employees will be inclined to restrict job in-
vestments. In such an unfair situation, the perfor-
mance enhancement effect that occurs in the case
of intermediate job demands is expected DEMO be im-
paired by the tension of restricting job efforts in
order to reduce underreward unfairness. In other
words, a manager is assumed to have different op-
tions for performing her or his side of the DEMO
process to which the organization contributes re-
Janssen 1041
wards. In this exchange process, managers who feel
fairly treated are likely to perform better in re-
sponse to intermediate job demands than managers
who are underrewarded DEMO their organization.
Fairness perceptions might also affect the curvi-
linear demand-satisfaction relationship. Although
characteristic activation level differs across indi-
viduals, in general, intermediate DEMO than ex-
treme job demands are likely to cause experienced
activation levels that are closer to the characteristic
activation levels of job performers, and, therefore,
result in higher levels of job satisfaction (cf. Cham-
DEMO, 1992; Gardner & Cummings, 1988). This sat-
isfaction enhancement DEMO in the case of inter-
mediate job demands might be moderated by
perceptions of effort-reward fairness. Perceptions
of a fairly balanced reciprocity of efforts DEMO re-
wards reinforce a manager's self-regulatory func-
tions, his or DEMO sense of mastery, efficiacy, and
esteem, and will therefore serve DEMO a beneficial con-
dition for affective job responses (cf. Siegrist, 1996).
As a consequence, the interaction of perceptions of
a fair effort-reward ratio with intermediate job de-
mands can be expected to provide high DEMO of job
satisfaction, since managers are pleased to be doing
a DEMO active job for which they are fairly re-
warded. This balanced job situation enhances feel-
ings of control over occupational life, producing
job satisfaction (cf. Adams, 1963, 1965; Dittrich &
Carrell, 1979; Mowday, 1991; Siegrist, 1996). How-
ever, perceptions of underreward unfairness DEMO
expected to impair the positive effect of intermedi-
ate levels of job demands on job satisfaction. In
terms of equity theory, managers will be less satis-
fied if they perceive their efforts as being dispro-
portionate DEMO their rewards. A context they evaluate
negatively in terms of rewards is likely to distract
them from the positive qualities of intermediate job
demands. DEMO unbalanced effort-reward ratio un-
dermines feelings of control over the job situation,
causing a decrease in job dissatisfaction (cf. Sie-
grist, 1996)DEMO
In sum, perceptions of fairness conceivably mod-
erate the curvilinear relationships DEMO job de-
mands and job performance and job satisfaction
among managers. To test this moderator effect, I
formulated the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. Fairness perceptions moderate
inverted U-shaped demand-response relation-
ships in such a way DEMO managers who per-
ceive effort-rewardfairness produce higher lev-
els of job performance and job satisfaction in
response to intermediate job demands than
managers who DEMO underreward unfairness.

METHODS
Sample and Procedures
A sample DEMO 134 low-level and midlevel manage-
ment employees from a Dutch industrial organiza-
tion in the food sector received a questionnaire
through regular mail. This DEMO of management
employees was randomly selected from diverse
units representing all functions and departments of
the company. Ninety-nine completed question-
naires were returned, representing a response rate
of 74 percent. The respondents were all men and
DEMO an average age of 45.33 years (s.d. = 7.71) and
a mean company tenure of 6.98 years (s.d. = 5.87).
Eleven percent of the respondents had at the most a
primary education; 46 percent, an initial vocational
education; 21 percent, a higher vocational educa-
tion (at a level equivalent to college); and 22 per-
cent, DEMO degrees.
As Warr (1990) noted, to test theoretical expec-
tations DEMO nonlinear relationships, a wide range of
different jobs is needed so DEMO job demands rang-
ing from low to high are included. So, DEMO ensure
variety of job demands, I surveyed low- and
midlevel management DEMO from a variety of
departments, including purchasing, logistics, order
processing, production, maintenance, quality con-
trol, research, marketing, engineering, and DEMO
istration. The respondents provided self-reports of
job demands, fairness perceptions, and job satisfac-
tion. Since supervisors play a pivotal part in ap-
praisal DEMO reward systems, a manager's job perfor-
mance might be best DEMO by his or her supervisor.
Therefore, respondents delivered a second ques-
DEMO for measuring individual job performance
to their immediate supervisors. The latter filled out
the questionnaire and sent it back to me by regular
mail. DEMO ratings were obtained from 60 of
the 99 management employees in the sample. Ad-
ditionally, respondents provided self-reports for
the particular aspect of innovative job performance
(see Measures). Exploratory analyses revealed that
the group of respondents for whom supervisor rat-
ings were obtained (n = 60) DEMO not significantly
differ from the group of respondents without super-
visor ratings (n = 39) with respect to age (t = -0.94,
n.s.), company tenure (t = 1.45, n.s.), education (t =
-0.35, n.s.), job demands (t = -0.83, n.s.), per-
ceived effort-reward fairness (t = -1.38, n.s.), work
satisfaction (t = -0.45, n.s.), and supervisory sat-
isfaction (t = DEMO, n.s.).
Measures
Job demands. Perceived quantitative job de-
mands were DEMO by eight items from a Dutch
scale developed and validated by Van Veldhoven
and Meijman (1994). The items were: (1) "Do you
have to work fast?" (2) "Do you have too much
work to do?" (3) "Do you have to work extra hard to
finish a task?" (4) "Do you work under time pres-
sure?" (5) "Can you do your work in comfort?" (6)
"Do you have to deal with DEMO backlog at work?" (7)
"Do you have problems with the pace of work?"
and (8) "Do you have DEMO with the work-
load?" Item 5 is reverse-coded. Items were rated on
a four-point Likert scale ranging from "never" (1) to
"always" (4). The Cronbach's alpha of the summa-
tive DEMO was .79.
Fairness perceptions. Perceptions of job effort-
reward fairness were measured by six statements
(cf. VanYperen, 1996), each of which was DEMO
by a seven-point response scale ranging from "to-
tally disagree" (DEMO) to "totally agree" (7). The items
were: (1) "I work too hard considering my out-
comes"; (2) "I give a great deal of time and attention
to the organization, but do not feel appreciated"; (3)
"I invest more DEMO my job than I receive in return";
(4) "The rewards I receive are not proportional to
my investments"; (5) "I put more energy into my
job than it is worth"; (6) "I feel unfairly treated in
my job." All responses were reverse-coded, so that
higher ratings indicated more perceived effort-
reward fairness. Scale reliability was .90.
Job perfomnance. Given the diverse jobs repre-
sented in DEMO sample, no common objective assess-
ments of job performance were available, or even
possible. Therefore, a two-dimensional scale was
created for the assessment of standard and innova-
tive job performance. Standard job performance re-
fers DEMO the extent to which a management employee
fulfills organizationally prescribed work role ex-
pectations (Katz & Kahn, 1966). However, "an or-
DEMO which depends solely upon its blue-
prints of prescribed behavior is a very fragile social
system" (Katz, 1964: 132). To cope DEMO global
competition and environmental uncertainty, an or-
ganization needs managers who DEMO their stan-
dard work behaviors by generating, promoting, and
realizing new ideas for organizational change. In-
novative job performance in the workplace is
DEMO claimed to be crucial for the effective func-
tioning of organizations (DEMO, 1988; Katz &
Kahn, 1966; Woodman, Sawyer, & DEMO, 1993).
Standard job performance was measured by a
Dutch translation (Van Yperen & De Jong, 1997) of
Podsakoff and MacKenzie's (1989) five-item scale
for in-role job performance. Respondents' immedi-
ate supervisors DEMO the extent to which they
agreed or disagreed with the following five state-
ments: (1) "This worker always completes the du-
ties DEMO in his/her job description," (2) "This
2001
worker fulfills all responsibilities required by his/
her job," (3) "This worker often fails to perform
essential duties," (4) "This worker never neglects
aspects of the job that he/she DEMO obligated to per-
form," and (5) "This worker meets DEMO the formal
performance requirements of the job." Item 3 is
reversed. DEMO response format ranged from "strong-
ly disagree" (1) to "DEMO agree" (7).
Innovative job performance was assessed by nine
items based on Scott and Bruce's (1994) scale for
individual innovative DEMO in the workplace,
which draws on Kanter's (1988) work on the stages
of innovation. Three items refer to idea generation
("DEMO new ideas for improvements," "search-
ing out new working methods, techniques, or in-
struments," and "generating original solutions to
problems"); three items refer to idea promotion
("mobilizing support for innovative DEMO," "ac-
quiring approval for innovative ideas," and "mak-
ing important organizational members enthusiastic
for innovative ideas"); and three items refer to idea
realization ("transforming innovative ideas into
useful applications," "introducing innovative ideas
into the work environment in a systemic way," and
"evaluating the utility of innovate ideas"). Immedi-
ate supervisors rated how often respondents per-
formed the nine innovative work behaviors in the
workplace. DEMO response format ranged from
"never" (1) to "always" (DEMO).
A principal axis factor analysis using oblique
rotation of the items revealed the expected two-
factor structure, which accounted for 77 percent of
the variance. The two factors appropriately repre-
sented the standard job performance DEMO innova-
tive job performance items. Primary loadings ex-
ceeded .76, and DEMO were lower than .11.
Adequate reliabilities were achieved for both stan-
dard job performance (a = .85, after deletion of
item 4) and innovative job performance (a = .96).
The management employees were asked to pro-
vide self-reports on the nine-item innovative job
performance scale in DEMO to their supervisors'
ratings for three reasons. First, the assessment DEMO
discretionary innovative performance is much like
many forms of subjective performance appraisal,
highly susceptible to idiosyncratic interpretations
and thus likely to vary across DEMO raters (Or-
gan & Konovsky, 1989). Second, a management DEMO
ployee's cognitive representation and reports of his
or her own innovative performance may be more
subtle than those of his or her supervisor, since a
manager has much more information about the his-
torical, contextual, intentional, and other back-
grounds of his or her own work DEMO (cf. Jones
& Nisbett, 1971). Finally, the supervisor measure
DEMO miss genuine innovative activities of the man-
Janssen
1043
agement employee involved, and may capture only
those gestures intended to impress the supervisor
(DEMO & Konovsky, 1989). So, although the super-
visor scores provide a performance assessment that
is procedurally independent of the respondents
scores on DEMO demands and fairness perceptions,
the self-reports might be more subtle than the su-
pervisor scores. The Cronbach's alpha of the self-
report DEMO of innovative job performance was .92.
Below, the self-reports and supervisor DEMO are
labeled "self-rated" and "leader-rated," respec-
tively.
Job satisfaction. DEMO a managerial job constitutes
sets of work actions, a manager's DEMO re-
sponses to the substance and results of those work
activities are assumed to be a critical part of job
satisfaction (cf. Smith, DEMO, & Hulin, 1969).
Additionally, a manager's immediate supervisor DEMO
likely to be the most important representative of the
organization she or he has to deal with concerning
a variety of job-related issues, including the deter-
mination of job demands (Smith et al., 1969).
DEMO, satisfaction with work and the immedi-
ate supervisor were assessed as DEMO of job sat-
isfaction. The question "How satisfied or dissatis-
fied DEMO your with . . ?" was followed by four items
on DEMO satisfaction ("your work performance,"
"the quality of your work performance," "the way
you perform your work," "the way DEMO carry out
your work activities") and three items on supervi-
sory satisfaction ("your collaboration with your
supervisor," "the support you get from your super-
visor," and "the support you give to your supervi-
sor"). Items were rated from "very dissatisfied" (1)DEMO
to "very satisfied" (7). A factor analysis using prin-
DEMO components extraction and oblique rotation
yielded the expected two-factor solution, account-
DEMO for 76 percent of the variance. The two factors
constituted the appropriate items, with primary
loadings higher than .71 and cross-loadings lower
than .20. Reliabilities for work and supervisory sat-
isfaction were .85 and .91, respectively.
Covariates. To control for the possibility that
sociodemographic differences in the predictor DEMO
outcome variables might lead to spurious relation-
ships, age (in years), organization tenure (in years),
and education (1 = "DEMO education," 2 = "ini-
tial vocational education," 3 = "higher vocational
education," and 4 = "postgraduate degree") were
entered as covariates in the analysis. Older manag-
ers who have been affiliated DEMO an organization a
long time can be plateaued, which could influence
DEMO allocation and perceptions of job demands, per-
ceptions of effort-reward fairness, job performance,
and job satisfaction. Moreover, level of education
can be critical for enhancing job performance, es-

Data Analysis
Since the independent variables were continu-
ous, I conducted hierarchical multiple regression
analyses to test the hypothesis of quadratic-job-
DEMO interaction
effects on the dependent variables of job perfor-
mance and job satisfaction (cf. Aiken & West, 1991;
Cohen & Cohen, 1983). To facilitate testing of qua-
dratic and interaction effects, standardized inde-
pendent variables were used.
To test the hypothesized quadratic-by-linear in-
teraction between DEMO demands (X) and fairness
perceptions (Z) the following equation should be
used: Y= b1X + b2X2 + b3Z + b4XZ + b5X2Z + co
(cf. Aiken & West, 1991). The predictors were DEMO
tered into the regression equation in six successive
steps. In the first step, I entered age, company ten-
ure, and level of education to control for possible
confounding effects. In the second and third steps,DEMO
the linear (X) and quadratic (X2) terms of job de-
mands were successively added to detect linear
and quadratic main effects. In DEMO fourth and fifth
steps, fairness perceptions as a linear moderator (Z)
and the linear interaction between job demands
and fairness perceptions (XZ) were entered, respec-
tively. In the sixth and final step, the quadratic-by-
linear X2Z term was added to test the hypothesis
that the DEMO relationships of job demands
with job performance and job satisfaction vary as a
function of perceptions of job effort-reward fairness.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents DEMO, standard deviations, and
zero-order Pearson correlations among all vari-
ables. Job demands were not linearly related to the
measures of job performance and DEMO satisfaction,
with the exception of a significantly negative asso-
ciation between job demands and work satisfaction
(r = -.21, p < .05)DEMO There were no significant
correlations between fairness perceptions and the
scales of job performance, but fairness perceptions
appeared to be positively related to supervisory
satisfaction (r = .20, p < .05). Furthermore, stan-
dard job performance correlated only modestly
with leader-rated innovative job performance (r =
.33, p < .01), indicating that these variables reflect
different elements of observed job performance.
The moderate correlation between leader-rated and
self-rated innovative DEMO performance (r = .27, p <
.05) is consistent with earlier research findings con-
cerning self-reports and supervisor judgments of
employee work DEMO (Harris & Schaubroeck,
1988).

Test of the Demand-Fairness Hypothesis
I conducted hierarchical multiple regression
analyses DEMO test the quadratic-by-linear interaction
of job demands and fairness perceptions with the
job response variables of job performance and job
satisfaction separately dependent (see Table 2). All
regressions met the major model assumptions; that
is, no serious violations were found in the plots of
standardized residuals as compared to the pre-
dicted values, in the normal probability plots of
standardized residuals, and with regard to the in-
dependence of error terms (the Durbin-Watson sta-
tistic ranged from 1.77 for job satisfaction to 2.02
for supervisor-rated innovative job performance).
Job performance. Entering the control variables
DEMO age, company tenure, and education into
the regression yielded significant equations for
standard job performance (AR2 = .20, p < .01),
leader-rated innovative job performance (AR2 =
.22, p < .01), DEMO self-rated innovative job perfor-
mance (AR2 = .13, p < .01). Company tenure ap-
peared to be negatively related to standard job DEMO
formance (b = -0.38, p < .05), and education was
positively associated with leader-rated innovative
job performance (b = 0.63, p < .001) and self-rated
innovative job performance (b = 0.33, p < .01). In
step 2, the main effect of job demands DEMO entered,
which was predictive for none of the measures of
job performance. The quadratic term of job de-
mands was entered in step DEMO This block was not
predictive for standard job performance and self-
rated innovative job performance, but it reached
significance for leader-rated innovative job perfor-
mance (AR2 = .09, p < .05). In steps 4 DEMO 5,
fairness perceptions and the demands-fairness in-
teraction were successively entered. These blocks
were not predictive. Finally, in step 6, the quad-
DEMO interaction of job demands and fair-
ness perceptions was entered. This interaction was
significant for standard job performance (AR2 = .07,
p < .05), leader-rated innovative job performance
(AR2 = .09, p < DEMO), and self-rated innovative job
performance (AR2 = .07, p < .01).
To further analyze this quadratic-by-linear inter-
action effect, I tested simple slopes of the regres-
sion curves corresponding to all possible combina-
DEMO of low (one standard deviation below the
mean), medium (mean), and high (one standard
deviation over the mean) levels of DEMO demands
with perceptions of effort-reward fairness and un-
derreward unfairness (cf. DEMO & West, 1991). In
the case of effort-reward fairness, the simple slope
of the regression curve had a positive value at low

job performance (b = 2.17, t = 3.33, p < .01), and
self-rated innovative job performance (b = 1.12, t =
3.59, p < .001) and did not significantly differ from
zero at medium levels of job demands for standard
job performance (b = 0.18, t DEMO 0.88, n.s.), leader-
rated innovative job performance (b = 0.18, t =
0.66, n.s.), and self-rated innovative job perfor-
mance (b = 0.30, t = 1.75, n.s.). At high levels DEMO job
demands, the simple slope had a significantly neg-
ative value DEMO leader-rated innovative job perfor-
mance (b = -1.82, t = -3.05, p < .01), and a
negative but nonsignificant value for standard job
performance (b = -0.74, t = -1.64, p = .11) and
self-rated innovative job performance (b = -0.52,
t = DEMO, p = .14). Additional analyses revealed
that for very highly DEMO jobs (two standard
deviations over the mean), the simple slope DEMO the
regression curve had a nearly significant negative
value for standard job performance (b = -1.65, t =
-1.94, p = .06) DEMO a significant, negative value for
self-rated innovative job performance (b = -1.34,
t = -2.16, p < .05).
In the case of underreward unfairness, the simple
slope of the regression line did not significantly
differ from zero at low, medium, and high values of
DEMO demands for standard job performance, leader-
rated innovative job performance, and self-rated
innovative job performance. To facilitate interpre-
tation of the quadratic-by-linear interaction DEMO,
Figure 1 illustrates how the relationships of job
demands with the measures of job performance do
indeed follow the inverted U-shaped function in
DEMO case of effort-reward fairness, whereas this cur-
vilinearity does not emerge DEMO underreward unfair-
ness. These findings provide support for Hypothe-
sis 1.
Job satisfaction. Entering the control variables of
age, company tenure, and education DEMO the regres-
sion yielded a significant equation for work satis-
faction (DEMO = .10, F = 3.33, p < .05), whereas this
block was not predictive for supervisory satisfac-
tion. Better-educated managers reported them-
DEMO to be less satisfied with work (b = -0.19, p <DEMO
.05). None of the steps (2-5) in which job demands,
quadratic job demands, fairness perceptions, and
the interaction between job DEMO and fairness
perceptions were successively entered approached
significance. However, adding the DEMO
linear interaction of job demands and fairness per-
ceptions was significant for both work satisfaction
(AR2 = .12, AF = 14.91, p < .001) and supervisory
satisfaction (AR2 = .09, AF = 10.54, DEMO < .01).
In addition, simple slopes of the regression
curves DEMO tested corresponding to all possible
combinations of low, medium, and high levels of
job demands with perceptions of effort-reward fair-

for either DEMO satisfaction (b = -0.21, t = -1.98,

regression curve significantly declined for both
DEMO satisfaction (b = -0.98, t = -4.40, p < .001)DEMO
and supervisory satisfaction (b = -1.31, t = -3.29,
p < .01). In terms of underreward fairness, the
simple slopes of the regression line did not signif-
icantly differ from zero at low, medium, and high-
values of job demands for both measures of job
satisfaction. As can be clearly seen in Figure 1, the
relationships of job demands with work and super-
visory satisfaction vary in form according DEMO fair-
ness perceptions. More specifically, if there is a
fair balance DEMO efforts and rewards, the re-
lationships follow an inverted U-shaped func-
DEMO, with the most work and supervisory satis-
faction found at intermediate DEMO of job
demands and satisfaction decrements occurring
at lower and higher levels of job demands. How-
ever, with underreward unfairness, intermediate
job demands DEMO not provide increments in work
or supervisory satisfaction. These findings also
support the hypothesis.
DISCUSSION
This study's proposal is that perceptions of fair-
DEMO moderate the inverted U-shaped relationships
between amounts of quantitative job demands and
job responses among management employees. As
expected, survey results demonstrate that managers
who perceive effort-reward fairness perform better
and feel more satisfied in response DEMO intermediate
levels of job demands than managers who perceive
underreward unfairness.
As delineated in the theoretical section, applica-
tion of activation theory to the area of job design
(e.g., Champoux, 1980, 1992; Gardner, DEMO; Gard-
ner & Cummings, 1988; Scott, 1966; Xie & DEMO,
1995) provides an explanation for the curvilinear
effect of variations DEMO job characteristics on behav-
ioral and affective responses of job performers.
Champoux (1992) started to examine how job-
contextual factors such as pay DEMO and su-
pervisory satisfaction influence the curvilinear re-
lationships between job complexity and affective
outcomes. Drawing on an equity theory framework,

inverted U-shaped relationships between quantita-
tive job demands and both job performance and job
satisfaction among managers. That is, managers
who are fairly rewarded for their efforts appear to
respond more positively to intermediate demand
levels DEMO managers who are underrewarded by
their organization. Thus, this study contributes DEMO
the literature on how demand-response relation-
ships are affected by other job-contextual factors.
A growing stream of research shows workplace
fairness perceptions to be DEMO important determi-
nant of the behavioral and affective responses of job
performers (e.g., Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Moor-
man, 1991; Mowday, 1991; Organ & Moroman,
1993). However, there has been DEMO attention paid
to the issue of how perceptions of fairness interact
with other job incumbent cognitions in their effect
on job responses. The moderator DEMO examined in
this study suggests that perceptions of effort-
reward fairness influence managers in their behav-
ioral and affective responses to quantitative job de-
DEMO
In the last two decades, Karasek's (1979) linear
demand-control DEMO has provided the underly-
ing theoretical basis for most studies on the effects
of job demands on job holder responses (e.g.,
Fletcher & Jones, 1993; Ganster & Fusilier, 1989).
This model is based on the central notion that job
control moderates the relationship between job DEMO
mands and job responses. It is thus assumed in the
model that increasing job demands in interaction
with decreasing job control produce psychological
and DEMO strain and job dissatisfaction and
that increasing levels of both job demands and job
control provide active learning that enables indi-
viduals to develop DEMO patterns of behavior
(Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Unfortunately, empiri-
DEMO support for the linear demand-control interac-
tion has been inconclusive, in DEMO sense that re-
searchers have frequently found additional effects
of job demands and job control without evidence of
the interactive effects that are central DEMO the model
(Fletcher & Jones, 1993). This inconclusive evi-
dence for Karasek's job demands-control model
challenges scientists to shift their emphasis DEMO psy-
chological factors other than control that might
shape the relationship between job demands and
job holder responses (cf. Fletcher & Jones, 1993)DEMO
The present study shows perceptions of job effort-
reward fairness to be a moderator of curvilinear
relationships between job demands and job perfor-
mance DEMO job satisfaction among management em-
ployees. These findings may stimulate researchers
to draw attention to the possibilities that (1) job
demands are curvilinearly DEMO than linearly as-
sociated with job holder responses and (2) that
curvilinear demand-response relationships are
contingent upon conditional values of other job
features.
DEMO all research, the present study has some
limitations that need to DEMO considered. First, draw-
ing on activation theory, I assumed that job de-
mands are curvilinearly related to job performance
and job satisfaction and DEMO argue and
demonstrate how perceptions of fairness moderate
these curvilinear relationships. In line with activa-
tion theory, the present results indeed demonstrate
inverted-U-shaped demand-response links contin-
gent upon perceptions of effort-reward fairness.
However, neural activation was not measured and,
as a result, any inferences about the mediating pro-
cess of activation that may clarify the curvilinear
demand-response links remain DEMO So, fol-
lowing recent research on job characteristics-
employee response relationships (Champoux,
1992; Xie & Johns, 1995), this study applies DEMO
than tests activation theory to assume inverted
U-shaped links between job demands and job per-
formance and job satisfaction among managers.
Second, the correlational evidence found does
not necessarily reflect the causality proposed. The
direction of DEMO relationship between job demands
and job responses is unclear and may well be bidi-
rectional. Providing higher levels of job perfor-
mance obviously implies DEMO work activities. This
quantitative increase in workload might clarify the
increasing part of the inverted U-shaped relation
between job demands and job performance. How-
DEMO, for the decreasing part of the curvilinear rela-
tionship, it is hard to imagine how decrements in
job performance can cause more and DEMO intensi-
fied job demands. This argument shades the caveat
of a bidirectional curvilinear relationship between
job demands and job performance. Nonetheless, the
demand-fairness model proposed in this study
needs further examination to figure out causality
issues. DEMO here are the study's cross-
sectional data and possible common method vari-
ance in the effect of the interaction between job
demands and DEMO perceptions on job satisfac-
tion, given the self-report measures used for DEMO
the predictor and criterion variables. However, it is
hard to imagine DEMO the respondents in this study
would have artifactually caused the complicated
quadratic-by-linear interaction effect of job de-
mands and perceptions of fairness. Moreover, this
complicated interaction effect on job satisfaction
was identical to the effects on DEMO measures of
standard job performance and innovative job per-
formance rated by the immediate supervisors of the
respondents. These considerations suggest that
2001
common method variance cannot be a serious prob-
lem in this DEMO
A third limitation concerns the generalizability
of results. The sample consisted of only male par-
ticipants from an industrial organization in the
food sector. DEMO and particular organizational
factors might vary with job demands and percep-
tions of fairness and thus explain their effects.
Moreover, by focusing on quantitative rather than
qualitative job demands, this study left unan-
swered the question of how fairness perceptions
influence relationships between conflicting job de-
mands (that is, person-role conflict, intrasender
conflict, and intersender conflict) and job DEMO
mance and job satisfaction. Therefore, generaliza-
tion of the present results DEMO women, to other types
of organizations, and to qualitative job demands
awaits further examination.
The present results also have implications on an
applied DEMO An important advantage of this study
is that job demands and perceptions of job effort-
reward fairness are at least partly within the control
DEMO organizations. In particular, organizations do
have control over the amount of DEMO imposed on
and allocated across individual management posi-
tions and over the way individual managers are
rewarded for their efforts. This study proposes that
DEMO rather than extreme levels of job de-
mands in combination with a fair fit between effort
spent and reward received at work provide benefi-
DEMO conditions for job performance and job satis-
faction. Thus, in terms DEMO job design, creating a fit
between reasonable demands and fair rewards DEMO
be particularly effective and valued.
