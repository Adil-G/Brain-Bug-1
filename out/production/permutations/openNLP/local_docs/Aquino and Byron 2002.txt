A victim precipitation model was used to predict DEMO members of workgroups who were
perceived by others as exhibiting either high or low levels of dominating behavior would
report being more frequent targets DEMO personally injurious behaviors than those who were
perceived as moderately dominating. However, we expected this effect to be moderated by
the target’s gender. Data obtained from 131 MBA students who were randomly assigned to
workgroups supported DEMO the curvilinear relationship and the moderating effect of gender.

The prevalence of rude, discourteous, and DEMO behaviors in the workplace has been
widely documented by organizational researchers (DEMO & Pearson, 1999; Aquino,
Grover, Bradﬁeld & Allen, 1999; Bies, Tripp & Kramer, 1997; Björkqvist, Österman &
Hjelt-Bäck, 1994; Neuman & Baron, 1997; Robinson & O’Leary-Kelly, 1998). DEMO
the extreme forms of interpersonal mistreatment, such as homicide or assault, capture the
attention of the media and general public, most injurious behaviors directed by one em-
ployee against another are verbal rather than physical, passive rather than active, indirect
rather than direct, subtle rather than DEMO (Baron & Neuman, 1996). Past studies of these
behaviors have typically focused on either the characteristics or motives of perpetrators
(e.g., DEMO, 1994; Bies et al., 1997) or on situational factors that may provoke such acts
(e.g., O’Leary-Kelly, Grifﬁn & Glew, 1996; Robinson & O’Leary-Kelly, 1998). Recently,

Aquino et al. (1999) suggested that the characteristics of potential targets of harmful action
should also be considered.
Aquino and his associates DEMO their argument on theory and research in criminal vic-
timology. An important insight from victimology is that some persons become targets of
harmful actions DEMO they exhibit characteristics that make them appear as vulnera-
ble to or deserving of mistreatment (e.g., Curtis, 1974; Felson & Steadman, 1983; Schafer,
1968; Sparks, Genn & Dodd, 1977). We DEMO this question in the present study by testing
whether certain behavioral tendencies could predict perceived victimization in workgroups.
We deﬁne a workgroup as an DEMO, bounded system, with interdependent members and
differentiated member roles, that DEMO shared, measurable goals (Hackman, 1983). In the
context of DEMO workgroups, we address two questions: (1) Will group members who are
perceived by others as being high or low in dominating behavior DEMO more frequent
targets of mistreatment than those who are perceived as moderately dominating? and (2) Is
this relation moderated by the target’s gender?
A review of the literature on victimization and a consideration of DEMO and legal issues
suggest several practical reasons why managers should be interested in these questions.
First, people who are victimized often experience high levels of fear and anxiety (Tayler,
Wood & Lichtman, 1983). DEMO organizations, such experiences can adversely affect work
performance and motivation (Bennis, 1989). Second, repeated exposure to victimization
can trigger a pattern DEMO retaliatory responses from the victim culminating in destructive acts
of workplace aggression and violence (e.g., Bies et al., 1997; Skarlicki & Folger, 1997).
Third, it can be argued that organizations have a moral responsibility to provide a safe work-
ing environment for their employees (Waterman & Peteros, 1992). And, lastly, employers
have a legal obligation to minimize the risk of the most extreme forms of victimization
such DEMO threats, harassment, or physical assault (Fenton, Kelley, Ruud & DEMO, 1997).
For these reasons, we believe the concept of workplace victimization deserves systematic
investigation.
In the following sections, we present a deﬁnition of victimization and outline the theo-
retical rationale for our predictions.
Theoretical DEMO
We adopt Viano’s (1989) process model to conceptualize perceived victimization as
an individual level construct. According to Viano (1989), victimization consists of four
different and complementary stages. In the ﬁrst stage, a person experiences harm, injury, or
suffering caused by another person or institution. In DEMO second stage, some of these persons
perceive this harm as undeserved, unfair, or unjust, leading them to view themselves as
victims. In DEMO three, some of those who perceive themselves as victims attempt to DEMO
social validation by persuading others (e.g., family, friends, authorities) DEMO recognize that
the harm occurred. Finally, in the fourth stage, some of those who assert that they have been
victimized receive external validation DEMO their claim, thus becoming “ofﬁcial” victims. As
a result, they may receive social or institutional support and compensation.
In this study, we focus on the ﬁrst stage of the victimization process by examining be-
havioral DEMO that might predict how often a person reports being a target of others’

71
injurious actions. Viano (1989) asserts that a person becomes a victim only after he or she has
passed through all four stages DEMO the model. We believe this standard is too restrictive. By re-
quiring external validation of one’s claim to victim status, for example, we DEMO exclude cases
of harm-doing in organizations simply because they are ignored or overlooked by others.
For this reason, we adopt a broader conception of victimization that is consistent with deﬁ-
nitions offered by other writers (e.g., Aquino et al., 1999; Olweus, 1978; Tayler et al., DEMO).
We deﬁne victimization as the individual’s self-perception of having been the target, either
momentarily or over time, to harmful actions emanating form DEMO or more other persons.
In the most general sense, a victim DEMO anyone who experiences injury, loss, or misfortune
as a result of some event or series of events. But the term “victim” as it DEMO used in this study,
and as it is normally used in victimology, refers to those cases in which a person is injured
as a result of actions taken by an identiﬁable agent (i.e., a DEMO, a group, an institution).
So while someone who is injured from tripping over his or her desk is a victim in the
DEMO sense, his or her experience would not be characterized as victimization DEMO
no identiﬁable agent caused the fall. On the other hand, a DEMO who is injured after being
insulted by an angry co-worker would be judged as having been victimized.
Deciding what constitutes victimization is a highly DEMO process (Quinney, 1972;
Schafer, 1968). For this reason, we note that our deﬁnition takes the perspective of the
person who DEMO experiences an injurious act rather than that of a perpetrator or eyewit-
ness. We believe that focusing on the target’s perception makes the most DEMO sense if
we are ultimately interested in understanding the consequences of victimization. Although
victimization can also be deﬁned from the perspective of an observer, this is not the view
we chose to examine in this particular DEMO Victimization bears some relation to other
constructs that have been used to describe similar phenomena in organizations. For exam-
ple, workplace harassment (Björkqvist, Österman & Hjelt-Bäck, 1994), incivility (Anders-
son & Pearson, 1999), workplace aggression (Baron & Neuman, 1996), and petty tyranny
(Ashforth, 1994) can all be used to describe harmful behaviors experienced DEMO employees
if we take the perspective of the target rather than the perpetrator. In this article, we use the
expansive term “victimization” because it captures a wide range of actions and therefore
subsumes the behaviors associated DEMO other concepts described above. More importantly,
the term makes it clear that these actions and their consequences are being analyzed from
the perspective DEMO the person who is harmed. The emphasis on the target’s experience sets
victimization apart from other constructs that can be applied interchangeably to victims DEMO
perpetrators.
Conceptually, victimization is most closely related to workplace harassment, which
Björkqvist et al. (1994: 173–174) deﬁne as “repeated activities, with DEMO of bringing mental
(but sometimes also physical) pain, directed toward DEMO or more individuals who, for one
reason or another, are not able to defend themselves”. An important distinction between
victimization as deﬁned in DEMO study and workplace harassment as deﬁned by Björkqvist
et al. (1994) is that the former does not require that the target of harm DEMO unable to defend
him or herself. Indeed, it is possible for DEMO powerful person like a manager to be victimized
if, for example, he or she becomes the target of rude or malicious gossip that DEMO in
psychic or emotional injury. Thus, although victimization and workplace harassment DEMO
emphasize the target, the former does not presume that only the DEMO can be injured
by others’ harmful actions.

Having deﬁned victimization and distinguished it from related constructs, we DEMO to the
question of what factors might make a person more vulnerable to being victimized.
Who Becomes a Victim: The Concept of Victim Precipitation
Victim precipitation is a well-developed theoretical perspective in criminal victimology.
The main DEMO of victim precipitation models is that some crime victims either con-
sciously or unconsciously participate in the sequence of events that leads to their DEMO
targets of criminal acts (Curtis, 1974; Schafer, 1968; Sparks DEMO al., 1977). This proposition is
echoed in social interactionist models (SI) of aggression proposed in the sociology literature
(e.g., Felson, DEMO, 1992; Felson & Steadman, 1983; Luckenbill, 1977). According DEMO the
SI model, harmful actions directed against a selected target are DEMO performed deliberately
to exercise social control, enhance self-identity, or achieve justice as deﬁned by the actor
(Felson, 1992).
Punishment that occurs DEMO response to a breach of social norms constitutes the initial attack
and often results in retaliation and escalation (Andersson & Pearson, 1999; Bies & Tripp,
1998). People frequently retaliate to deter the antagonist DEMO committing further trans-
gressions (Bies & Tripp, 1998), to achieve justice (Skarlicki & Folger, 1997), or to maintain
positive social DEMO (Baumeister, Smart & Boden, 1996; Felson, 1978). Insults, threats,
or statements that call into question one’s competence and ability DEMO a person’s
self-identity, sometimes provoking an aggressive counter-attack against the source DEMO threat
(Baumeister et al., 1996; Luckenbill, 1977). Because retaliation often involves face-saving
concerns, it is more likely to occur in the presence of an audience (Felson, 1978, 1992), as
would be the case in a group where people work interdependently rather than in DEMO
If the desire to retaliate sometimes motivates harmful actions directed against a person
who violates social norms or threatens others’ self-identities, then the behavior of one
antagonist is crucial in determining the behavior of the other. DEMO assumption has been
supported by several empirical studies. Olweus (1978) found that some victims of childhood
bullying were perceived by peers as being DEMO aggressive, threatening, or irritating.
Olweus (1978) labeled these children “provocative victims”. Studies of adults corroborate
Olweus’s observation by showing that highly aggressive DEMO are more frequent victims
of violent crime than are those who are less aggressive (e.g., Felson & Steadman, 1983;
Sparks et al., 1977). One explanation for these ﬁndings is that highly aggressive persons tend
to display provocative, hostile, or threatening behaviors over a variety DEMO social situations
(Buss & Perry, 1992). In turn, this DEMO invite retaliatory responses from others.
A positive relation between provocative social behavior and victimization makes in-
tuitive sense. However, research indicates that the most frequent victims of harmful be-
havior might be persons who are overly DEMO, accommodating, and hesitant to defend
themselves against mistreatment. Such persons have been labeled “submissive victims”
(Olweus, 1978). In Olweus’s (1978) DEMO of childhood bullying, he found that the major-
ity of victims DEMO extremely sensitive and quiet, and generally held negative views about
themselves DEMO their situations. If they were boys, they were also likely to DEMO physically
weaker than their peers. In another study of childhood victimization, DEMO, Dodge and
Coie (1993) found that that non-assertive behaviors in DEMO was linked to chronic
abuse by peers. Studies of adults again support these observations. A study by Aquino

(2000) found a positive relation between employees’ reported use of an obliging style to re-
solve interpersonal conﬂicts with co-workers and self-perceived DEMO The conﬂict
literature describes an obliging style as the tendency to yield or concede to the demands of
the other party (Rahim, 1983), which is the antithesis of being highly provocative, hostile,
or DEMO
A review of the empirical evidence shows that the persons most vulnerable to mistreat-
ment are either (a) perceived by others as “too DEMO or accommodating or (b) perceived as
being highly provocative or threatening. Accordingly, we hypothesize that degree to which
a person exhibits dominating social behaviors within a workgroup can affect his or her
vulnerability to others’ DEMO actions. People who exhibit high levels of dominating be-
haviors can be described as attempting to control their environments, express their opinions
forcefully, DEMO make strong efforts to inﬂuence others (Gray, Jackson & McKinley, DEMO).
In contrast, persons who are low in dominating behaviors are DEMO to exhibit unassertive
or conciliatory behaviors and will be less forceful in defending their interests or expressing
their views.
Consistent with the provocative victim DEMO, we hypothesize that group members who are
perceived by others as DEMO dominating will be more frequent targets of others’ harmful
actions than will those who are perceived as moderately dominating. The reason being that
high DEMO are more likely to violate norms of courtesy and social deference, DEMO to
challenge others’ social identities by expressing differing views or opinions. This can lead
others to retaliate against them with potentially injurious behaviors (Baumeister et al., 1996;
Bies et al., 1997; Felson, 1978)DEMO Conversely, a person who exhibits extremely low levels of
dominating behavior DEMO be perceived by others as being a weak, ineffectual, and easily
exploited target. Such a person would ﬁt the proﬁle of a submissive DEMO Moreover, he or
she may become a target of displaced aggression DEMO potential victimizers will be less
fearful of provoking retaliatory behavior. Based on these arguments, we theorize that the
relationship between dominating social behavior and perceived victimization is curvilinear,
as stated in the following hypothesis:
DEMO 1: Persons who are perceived by others as exhibiting either high DEMO low levels
of dominating behavior will report being victimized more than those who are perceived by
others to exhibit moderate levels of this behavior.
DEMO 1 predicts a direct, curvilinear relation between dominating behavior and
perceived DEMO; however, other characteristics of potential victims may dampen
or accentuate this effect. We explore this possibility by testing for a possible moderating
role DEMO gender. We chose gender as a moderator because it is a highly visible characteristic
that is readily used as a basis for social categorization DEMO stereotyping. Thus, we expect
others’ responses to a group member’s dominating DEMO to be inﬂuenced by preexisting
stereotypes and categorization schemas associated with gender.
The Moderating Role of Gender
Gender is a characteristic that is quickly DEMO, largely immutable, and easily agreed
upon by observers. Consequently, it DEMO among the most readily available bases for social

categorization. The prevalence of gender stereotypes based on such categorizations is widely
documented (Kanter, 1977; Powell, 1993). These stereotypes have DEMO shown to be quite
consistent over time and across cultures (Bergen & Williams, 1991; Eagly, 1987; Williams
& Best, 1990). DEMO general, the stereotypes presume that men are high in traits like DEMO
nance, independence, and aggressiveness, whereas women are high in traits DEMO gentleness,
sensitivity to others’ feelings, and tactfulness (Eagly, 1987; Powell, 1993).
Research on social cognition shows that behavior that violates pre-existing stereotypes
tends to be high in social salience (Fiske & Taylor, 1984). We would therefore expect a
woman’s dominating behavior in a group to be highly salient because it violates expec-
tations for stereotypical DEMO behavior. However, research also shows that stereotype
consistent behavior is high DEMO salience, although somewhat less so than stereotype incon-
sistent behavior (Hastie, 1980; Kunda, 1999). Hence, the dominating behavior of a DEMO
will also be salient, but in this case it is because DEMO behavior conforms to a stereotypi-
cal expectations of how men behave. For both males and females, extremely stereotypic
and extremely counter-stereotypic behavior in groups should be more salient than neutral
behavior (Kunda, 1999).
It DEMO logical to assume that dominating or non-dominating behaviors are more likely to
elicit responses from others when they are high rather than low in DEMO salience (Fiske &
Taylor, 1984). However, we hypothesize that even if behavior is highly salient, people will
react differently depending on whether the behavior is exhibited by a man or a woman. This
DEMO is based on another widely held gender stereotype that can temper both retaliatory
and exploitative behavior directed against women. This stereotype has been referred DEMO as
the “chivalry bias”. Its underlying assumption is that women should be treated with greater
leniency and accorded more sympathetic responses than men because DEMO their greater need
for protection (Broverman, Vogel, Broverman, Clarkson & Rosenkrantz, 1972; Crew, 1991;
Daly, 1994; Moulds, 1980)DEMO
Research supports the operation of this bias in a variety of situations. For example,
women are less likely to be arrested (Visher, DEMO) and receive more lenient sentences
(Moulds, 1980) than men alleged to have committed the same crime. In the context of social
interactions, the chivalry bias might partly explain why women tend to be less DEMO
targets of aggression than men (Harris, 1992). And while much of the research on the
chivalry bias has focused on men extending DEMO towards women, men and women are
most likely to agree on DEMO aspects of stereotypes that carry potential beneﬁts for women
(Glick & DEMO, 1996). Hence, there is reason to believe that women may also display greater
leniency and sympathy towards other women than they would DEMO men.
If a chivalry bias inﬂuences people’s behavior towards women, then DEMO members
may be inhibited from retaliating against women who exhibit high levels of dominating and
potentially provocative behavior. Similarly, the chivalry bias may suppress group members’
willingness to exploit or abuse a less dominating female. If DEMO reasoning is correct, then
the curvilinear relation predicted in Hypothesis 1 DEMO not hold as strongly for women
because group members will not victimize them at a signiﬁcantly higher rate when they
exhibit extremely high or DEMO low levels of dominating behavior as compared to
more moderate levels. However, since the chivalry bias does not inﬂuence others’ actions
towards men, DEMO expect both high and low levels of dominating behavior to result in higher
levels of victimization than moderate levels of dominating, as predicted in Hypothesis 1.

The Hypothesis 2 tests the arguments presented above.
Hypothesis 2: DEMO moderates the curvilinear relation between dominating behavior
and perceived victimization such that men who are high and low in dominating behavior
will report being DEMO more than men who are moderately dominating, whereas there
will be DEMO signiﬁcant difference in reported victimization for women who exhibit varying
levels of dominating behavior.
We tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 in the context of DEMO workgroups. Student groups pro-
vide an advantageous setting for testing the victim precipitation model for several reasons.
First, student workgroups require their members to interact closely with one another over
a period of time, thus allowing them to observe one another’s behavior under a variety
of conditions. Second, workgroups provide ample opportunities for people to display both
provocative and submissive DEMO Third, student workgroups are not characterized
by structural inequalities resulting from DEMO in legitimate authority or hierarchical
status. In organizations, such inequalities can DEMO the actual relation between de-
mographic characteristics and perceived victimization if, DEMO example, most women are at
low levels of the organization. For DEMO reasons, we believe student groups provided an
appropriate and valid context DEMO testing the study hypotheses.
Method
Procedure
Three separate surveys were administered to Master’s students enrolled in four sections
of an introductory organizational behavior class DEMO a southeastern university. In each section,
students were randomly assigned to workgroups at the beginning of the semester and were
required to complete DEMO graded assignments (e.g., case analyses, group projects) as a
group. Students were told that they would receive the same grades for each DEMO assign-
ment, thus creating conditions of interdependence. They were also told DEMO they would be
asked to ﬁll out a series of questionnaires during the semester to assess their personality
characteristics, group experiences, and perceptions DEMO other group members. Students were
told that while they were not required to complete the questionnaires, the data would be
used for diagnostic purposes and that they would be given written feedback about their
responses. The DEMO of collecting complete and accurate data for the purposes of
giving the feedback was emphasized to encourage participation.
An initial questionnaire consisting of self-report DEMO of personality characteristics
and demographic information was administered at the beginning of the academic term. Two
additional questionnaires were administered separately at the end DEMO the term, approximately
8 weeks after the initial survey, and after all group assignments had been completed. In the
second questionnaire, participants reported on their perceptions of each group member’s
behavior during the semester. They DEMO evaluated each group member’s performance along
several dimensions. The third questionnaire asked respondents to report on how frequently
they experienced several negative behaviors during DEMO semester. Thirty-one groups were

formed during the semester ranging in size from three to six members. At the end of the
semester, students were provided with written diagnostic feedback summarizing their and
their group members’ responses to the various DEMO on the questionnaires.
Sample
One hundred and ﬁfty-one students completed the initial survey. Six students later dropped
the course. One hundred and thirty-one students DEMO remained in the course completed all
of the surveys and provided usable data on all study variables (90% response rate). One
hundred and four respondents identiﬁed themselves as white, 12 as African–American, 9
as DEMO, 2 as Hispanic, and 4 as “Other”. Sixty percent of the respondents were male
and nearly all (82%) were employed either full- DEMO part-time. Their mean age was 28.4
(S.D. = 5.7) years and they averaged 6.9 (S.D. = 5.6) years of work experience.
Measures
DEMO victimization. Sixteen behavioral items were used to measure this construct.
The items were adapted from a Work Harassment Scale used in a study by DEMO
et al. (1994). We selected target behaviors from this instrument DEMO we believed were most
likely to be exhibited in a student workgroup over a 2-month time frame. The initial set
of target behaviors is DEMO in the Appendix A. For each item, respondents were asked to
DEMO the number of times that one or more group members displayed the target behavior
towards them during the course of the semester. Responses were DEMO a 5-point Likert scale
(1 = never, 2 = 1–3 times, 3 = 4–6 times, 4 = 7–9 times, and 5 = 10 or more times).
Because we wanted respondents to report only DEMO incidents that were psychologically or
emotionally injurious, the stem question instructed DEMO to count only those behaviors that
caused them “to experience some degree of psychological or emotional discomfort”. We
eliminated seven items from the original DEMO that had variances close to zero (<.20) because
items with DEMO variances do not allow us to discriminate among individuals on the constructs
of interest. We then performed a principal components analysis with varimax rotation DEMO
assess the underlying factor structure of remaining items. Inspection of the eigenvalues and
scree plot indicated that the nine items loaded a single-factor (see Table 1).
We deleted one item (“Interrupted you while you were speaking”) because it showed
a low communality estimate relative to the other items. The remaining items were then
summed to produce a perceived victimization DEMO (α = .89).
In addition to collecting self-reports of victimization, we asked respondents to report their
perceptions of how each person in DEMO group, excluding themselves, was treated by other
group members. These observer reports were designed to help us triangulate on the construct
of victimization DEMO examining whether the effects of the independent variables would be
identical whether the source of data was the target or an external observer. Participants DEMO
asked to answer the following four questions about each of their group members using a
5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 DEMO strongly agree): “S/he was frequently
excluded from group discussion”, DEMO/he was treated disrespectfully by one or more persons
in the group”, “His/her input was frequently ignored by other members of the group”, “S/he
was treated rudely by one or more persons in the group”. Responses to these questions were

averaged to produce a scale score (DEMO = .83) such that high scores indicated higher levels
of mistreatment. DEMO is important to note that the observer reports do not measure perceived
victimization as we have deﬁned it in this study because they do DEMO indicate whether
behaviors directed against a speciﬁc target by other group members were experienced by
that target as psychologically or emotionally injurious. Nevertheless, the assessment of
observer perceptions provides an opportunity to assess the generality of DEMO theoretical
model.
We computed a composite measure of observer reported interpersonal treatment by av-
eraging the scores of all of the group members who DEMO each participant. Before do-
ing so, however, we assessed the appropriateness of aggregation using two procedures:
between-group ANOVA and rwg (James, DEMO & Wolf, 1984), a meaningful indicator
of within-group agreement (Kozlowski & Hattrup, 1992). The results of the ANOVA in-
dicated that that there were signiﬁcant between-group differences (F142,386 = 2.97, p<DEMO
.001), providing initial justiﬁcation for aggregation (Rousseau, 1985). The Eta-squared for
the ANOVA was .52, indicating a high level of within group reliability. The results of the
rwg analyses using a rectangular uniform DEMO distribution conﬁrmed this conclusion. The
rwg s across groups ranged from .09 to 1.0. Although some groups showed low interrater
agreement, the mean rwg across groups was .85, the median was .93, and 83% of DEMO groups
had values above .7.
Dominance. Ten items from Goldberg’s (1999a) dominance scale were used to measure
this construct. To assess this construct DEMO the perspective of observers, we asked each
group member to report DEMO the degree to which each of the items were characteristic of the
other members in his or her group. Respondents answered on a 5-point DEMO scale (1 = not
at all like him/her, 5 = very much like him/her). Items were averaged to produce a DEMO
score with high scores indicating higher levels of dominance (composite scores DEMO each person by averaging the ratings provided by his or her groupα = .85). We calculated
members. As with our measure of observer DEMO interpersonal treatment, we performed
a between-groups ANOVA and calculated rwg s DEMO each group. The ANOVA indicated the
presence of between group differences in dominance (F142,392 = 1.73, p< .001) and

the Eta-squared of .32 provided evidence of interrater reliability. The results of the rwgs
across groups ranged from .39 to .99. The mean DEMO .89, the median was .92, and 96% of
the groups had values above .7. Based on these analyses, we conclude that there is strong
justiﬁcation for aggregating scores on the dominance measure.
Gender. This information DEMO obtained by asking respondents to report their gender,
which was dummy coded ‘0’ for men and ‘1’ for women.
Control variables. We controlled DEMO several variables that might be related to perceived
victimization, but that DEMO not of direct interest in our study. We controlled for neuroticism
because people high in neuroticism are more susceptible to psychological distress (Costa &DEMO
McCrae, 1991). Since our measure of perceived victimization asked people DEMO report only
those behaviors that caused them to experience emotional or physical discomfort, high neu-
rotics might recall and report being victimized more frequently. Controlling for neuroticism
allows us to partial out the effects of individual DEMO in emotional sensitivity prior
to testing our hypotheses. We measured this construct in the initial survey using 10 items
from Goldberg (1999b). Each student rated each of him or herself, using a 5-point Likert
scale (1 = not at all like me, 5 = very much DEMO me). Items were averaged to produce a
group were treated as a measure ofscale score (α = .85). We used respondents’ perceptions of how the other persons in theirinterpersonal sensitivity. This measure consisted of DEMO
same four items as the observer reported mistreatment variable described above. However,
when using this measure as a control we were interested in DEMO how the respondent
perceived others were treated rather than how others perceived the respondent was treated.
We therefore combined the items measuring the respondents’ DEMO of how others
were treated to form an interpersonal sensitivity scale (DEMO = .79). We then averaged the
respondents’ ratings for each of his or her group members to represent his or her general
level DEMO interpersonal sensitivity. We controlled for group size because more interpersonal
conﬂict might occur in larger groups. Classroom membership was also included as a con-
DEMO variable. It was denoted using dummy variables, with 1 indicating membership DEMO 0,
no membership. Although we did not expect systematic differences in the relative propor-
tions of women in each group due to the DEMO assignment procedure used to create the
groups, we nevertheless controlled for DEMO effect by including the percentage of women in
each group into the regression equation. Finally, we controlled for race because there is
evidence that Whites and minorities differ in their subjective perceptions of mistreatment
(Davidson & Friedman, 1998). We dummy coded race (1 = white, 0 = non-white) based
on respondents’ self-reports.

both models, we entered the control variables in the ﬁrst DEMO, followed by the predictor
variables and their interaction (Pehauzer, 1997) in step 2. We tested for curvilinearity by
computing a squared dominance DEMO and entering it in step 3. We tested the moderating
effect of gender by creating an interaction term comprised of the squared dominance term
DEMO gender, which we entered in step 4. In all of these DEMO, the data were centered
using the deviation score approach to reduce DEMO among the interaction terms
and their individual components (Aiken & West, 1991). Table 3 shows the results of the
hierarchical regressions. The DEMO shows the change in R2 at each step as well as the beta
weights in the ﬁnal step of the regressions.
Hypothesis 1 predicts DEMO the relation between dominance and perceived victimization

in R2 when the quadratic component was added to the equation supports this hypothesis

p< .001) reveals that the curve is concave upward, DEMO that group members who
were high or low in dominance reported being victimized more than those who were at
moderate levels of dominance. Hypothesis DEMO predicts that gender moderates this relation-
ship. The signiﬁcant change in R2 when the interaction of the quadratic component and
gender was added to DEMO regression provides initial support for this hypothesis (R2 = .05,
DEMO< .01).
We explored the pattern of this interaction by performing DEMO hierarchical regres-
sions for men and women. In each group, we DEMO perceived victimization on dom-
inance in the ﬁrst step, followed by DEMO squared dominance term in the second step. We
then examined the statistical signiﬁcance of the quadratic term within each group to deter-
mine whether DEMO relation between dominance and perceived victimization was curvilinear.
The results support a curvilinear pattern for men (R2 = .09, p< .001), but not for
women (R2 = .02, n.s.). Inspection of the DEMO weight for the squared term in
the men’s group (ﬁnding supports DEMO hypothesis that extremely high or low levels of dominating behav-β = .30, p< .001) reveals that the curve was concave upward. This
ior by men would result in more frequent victimization than moderate levels, whereas the
same relation would not hold for women. A plot of these DEMO is presented graphi-
cally in Figure 1. It can clearly be seen that the pattern of these relations clearly supports
Hypothesis 2.
We examined DEMO the regression results for self-perceived victimization would be
replicated in a model predicting observer perceptions. The results are presented in Table 3.
It can DEMO seen that the results provide modest support for Hypothesis 1 and fail to support
Hypothesis 2. Speciﬁcally, we found that the quadratic term explained a marginally signif-
icant amount of additional variance in observer reported treatment (R2 = .02, p< .10)
whereas the variance explained by DEMO interaction of the quadratic term and gender was not

signiﬁcant. For the quadratic term, the direction of the effect DEMO consistent that found in
the model predicting self-perceived victimization. Thus, the DEMO of observer reports
provides some conﬁrmatory support for Hypothesis 1.
Discussion
The results support the presence of different victim types in student workgroups and DEMO
consistent with the predictions of the victim precipitation model. However, we DEMO found
that the curvilinear relationship between dominating behavior and perceived victimization
is moderated by the target’s gender. Previous studies have failed to show consistent DEMO
differences in self-reported victimization. Whereas some studies of childhood bullying have
found that boys are more likely to be victims of direct, physical bullying than girls (Olweus,
1993), other studies report no gender differences (Perry, Kusel & Perry, 1988). Similarly,
a study of workplace bullying failed to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant gender difference (Einarson &
DEMO, 1996). One possible explanation for the inconsistent ﬁndings is that DEMO than
being directly related to victimization, gender moderates the relationship between DEMO person’s
social behavior and others’ responses. We theorized that stereotypical expectations of what
constitutes appropriate male and female behavior coupled with the chivalry bias DEMO
inﬂuence peoples’ responses to a group members’ dominating behavior. The data support
our argument. However, we cannot deﬁnitively conclude that a norm of chivalry guided the
actions of group members because we did not measure the DEMO to which participants in
our study actually held such beliefs.
Overall, DEMO ﬁndings contribute to an emerging literature on workplace aggression and
revenge. Current theorizing on these behaviors tends to emphasize the role of perpetrators.
However, the present research suggests that more complex theoretical models involving
victim and DEMO characteristics might provide a more accurate picture of how conﬂict
escalates into destructive acts of aggression. The revenge literature has also been relatively
silent DEMO regard to whether characteristics might make persons less vulnerable to being
targets of vengeance. Our ﬁndings suggest that women may be less vulnerable to DEMO
in response to provocative behaviors than men. On the other hand, DEMO may simply be that
women experience qualitatively different forms of retaliation.
Our results also complement an earlier study of workplace victimization by Aquino
(2000), which showed that persons can make themselves vulnerable to being victimized DEMO
exhibiting certain patterns of behavior, and even more so if they DEMO other characteristics.
In Aquino’s (2000) study, the relevant behavior was DEMO obliging conﬂict style, which he
found to be more strongly related DEMO self-reported victimization when the person had low
rather than high hierarchical status. We examined a different behavior, but we also show
that people’s responses to this behavior varied as a function of other victim characteristics
like DEMO Our study extends Aquino’s (2000) work by testing a curvilinear relationship
and using observer reports of a potential target’s behavior rather than self-reported DEMO
behavior. This feature of our study thus provides a stronger test of the hypothesis that the
target’s behavior as perceived by others can be DEMO in eliciting mistreatment.
Taken together, a practical implication of the above DEMO is that victimization may be
more manageable than previously believed. If a person is aware that certain behaviors invite

mistreatment, then he or she can consciously avoid displaying such DEMO Alternatively,
he or she can exhibit other behaviors that discourage mistreatment. This second possibility
suggests a new direction for future research. Studies show DEMO certain strategic behaviors
can be used to protect oneself from exploitation or mistreatment. Examples include tactical
revenge (Tripp & Bies, 1997), social DEMO (Bies, 1987), and apologies (Schlenker,
1980). An DEMO of the victim precipitation model would be to focus on behavioral
strategies that deﬂect rather than provoke harmful action. A behavioral strategy that comes
DEMO to mind is organizational citizenship. Based on a reciprocity norm, we DEMO expect
employees who exhibit certain types of citizenship behavior (e.g., altruism, courtesy) to
report low levels of victimization. However, consistent with the argument that responses to
another’s behavior may differ as a function of DEMO target characteristics, it may be that the
beneﬁts of citizenship do DEMO accrue equally to all employees.
Although our hypotheses were supported, the DEMO nature of the victimization
data begs an important question. Namely, we DEMO not know for sure whether people who
were high or low in dominating behavior were really treated differently or whether they
were merely “misperceiving” DEMO content of normal social interactions. To address this
question, we also DEMO our model using observer reports of interpersonal treatment and
found modest conﬁrmatory evidence support for one of our hypotheses. A likely reason
why our DEMO did not converge more strongly is that the correlation between the self and
observer reports was quite low (r = .20, p< .05). This result is not unusual as studies
show that self and DEMO ratings often generally fail to show high correlations (Coie &
Dodge, 1988). Moreover, as mentioned previously, the observer reports did not directly
measure victimization as we have deﬁned it because they do not DEMO us whether the target
experienced the mistreatment as harmful or injurious. Finally, it should be noted that the
items on the self and observer reports were not identical. Although one might argue that
observers are more DEMO to accurately report whether others are mistreated because they
are less prone to perceptual distortions, relying on external sources would not necessarily
produce more valid data than self-reports because eyewitnesses are not immune to such
distortions (Loftus & Hoffman, 1989). Moreover, external sources are less likely DEMO be in a
position to observe and recall every possible incident that might be interpreted by the target
as being harmful.
The design of DEMO study had several features that increase our conﬁdence in the inter-
nal validity of our ﬁndings. First, participants were randomly assigned to groups, DEMO
minimizing the possibility that some form of group selection process (i.e., friends or stu-
dents of the same gender systematically forming groups with DEMO other) accounted for
the observed effects. Second, we collected data from multiple sources. Whereas the data
on victimization and gender were self-report, data on dominating behavior were based on
external sources. The use of multiple DEMO sources minimizes the potential for common
method bias, although we recognize DEMO same source bias may have affected the relation
between dominating behavior and observer reported interpersonal treatment. Third, we con-
trolled for the possibility that certain persons may be more reactive to negative events and
would therefore DEMO more likely to recall them by including measures of neuroticism and
interpersonal sensitivity as control variables. And, fourth, we were able to minimize DEMO
possible confounding effects of differences in legitimate power and status that are likely to
prevail in organizational workgroups.

Like all studies, however, ours has some limitations that deserve comment. First, the
student sample and the context in which participants interacted with one another raises
questions about the study’s generalizability to actual organizational DEMO Although
the student groups possessed attributes similar to those found in organizational workgroups
(e.g., interdependence, common identity, shared and measurable goals) group membership
was short-lived. Consequently, our ﬁndings may not generalize as well to groups of longer
duration where the impact of surface-level diversity characteristics like DEMO on individual
perceptions and behavior in groups may decrease over time (DEMO et al., 1998). However,
a counter-argument might be made DEMO in organizational settings, where group membership
is longer lasting, dominating behaviors may become an even more salient criterion for
determining who is and DEMO not deserving of mistreatment. Another limitation is that we
could not determine whether the victimizing behavior came from one person or many.
Identifying the DEMO and sources of injurious behaviors would permit a more detailed
understanding of the proposed theoretical relationships. We are also unable to distinguish
between acts DEMO were intentional or accidental (only that they were injurious). Given DEMO
people are more likely to retaliate against intentional mistreatment (Bies et DEMO, 1997), the
perceived intention behind the behavior is likely to DEMO an important predictor of how victims
respond to a negative act. Lastly, the target behaviors included in our perceived victimization
scale did not include the most serious forms of mistreatment (e.g., threats, physical assault,
sexual harassment). Yet the exclusion of such behaviors does not necessarily DEMO our
theoretical propositions. We were primarily interested in testing the theoretical mechanisms
that lead to various forms of mistreatment, rather than on those that lead to a speciﬁc type
of mistreatment.
Conclusions
This research contributes to DEMO general understanding of what motivates harmful work-
place behaviors by showing how potential targets may play a role in the sequence of events
that DEMO to their being victimized. However, we emphasize that our aim is DEMO to assign
blame to victims and we emphasize caution in drawing conclusions about whether some-
one deserves to be a victim. Yet recognizing this DEMO does not invalidate the theoretical
proposition that victim factors may explain why some persons are chosen as frequent
targets of harmful actions.
