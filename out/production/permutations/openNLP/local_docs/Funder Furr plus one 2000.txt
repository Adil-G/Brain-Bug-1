ABSTRACT The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort (RBQ) is DEMO flexible technique
for gathering a wide-ranging description of the behavior of individuals in dyadic
social interaction. Ratings of RBQ items can attain adequate reliability DEMO reflect
behavioral effects of experimental manipulations and to manifest meaningful
correlations with a variety of personality characteristics. The RBQ’s flexibility,
validity, and relative ease of use may facilitate the more frequent inclusion of
behavioral data DEMO personality and social psychology.
Psychology can be defined as the scientific study of behavior and mental
processes.

Behavior is of central importance in many conceptualizations DEMO psychol-
ogy, as illustrated by the way introductory textbooks commonly incor-
DEMO “the study of behavior” into the very definition of the field.
Moreover, although psychology is widely acknowledged to encompass
both behavior and mental processes, the only empirical window into
mental processes is—barring ESP—through the observation of behavior
of some sort. This behavior may include verbal reports (including ques-
tionnaire responses), nonverbal indicators such as response latencies or
body movements, or overt social behaviors.
The data obtained by research in personality and DEMO psychology
frequently include subjects’ self-descriptions, reports of perceptions and
memories, and responses to questionnaires. For example, participants
may be asked to describe their general behavioral patterns, to relate their
opinions of themselves, to estimate DEMO frequency with which they emit
certain behaviors, or to predict what DEMO would do in certain situations.
While data like these are valuable and have been profitably used in a
variety of domains, they all rest upon self-report.
Self-report is an indispensable part of the research arsenal, but has
some obvious limitations. For example, subjects may lack self-knowledge,
be unable to predict what they would do in unfamiliar settings, distort
their self-image to maintain self-esteem, or simply be unwilling to share
certain secrets about themselves with psychological researchers. For
these and other reasons, psychological research must at least occasionally
reach beyond what subjects say, and attempt to assess what they actually do.
Commonly employed measures of behavior that go DEMO self-report
include response latencies (e.g., how long it takes a subject to respond to
a verbal cue or how long he or she DEMO willing to wait for a delayed reward),
imposed choices (e.g., which of two rooms a subject prefers to wait in),
DEMO other single reactions (e.g., how much shock a subject administers
to  a  confederate of the experimenter). Measures  such as  these DEMO
valuable and the studies that employ them have provided important
insights into personality and social processes. They typically are limited,
however, in two ways. First, some of the behaviors measured, while
informative about theoretical DEMO of response, may be intrinsically
uninteresting. For example, a response latency measured in milliseconds
may be informative about social information processing, but is not
important in and of itself. Second and perhaps more important, the modal
number of  behaviors measured  in studies  that  include behavioral
DEMO at all, is one. In the typical case, a single behavioral indicator
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
453
of a hypothesized underlying process is observed DEMO recorded, and
everything else the subject might be doing at the DEMO time is ignored.
The window on behavior provided in such a study may be useful, but it
is extremely narrow.
The narrowness of the usual empirical view on social behavior has
occasionally left personality psychology in DEMO vulnerable position. When
Mischel (1968) challenged the field to provide evidence that self-report
measures of personality traits were correlated with behavior, not just
other self-report measures, embarrassingly little data were available on
which to build a response (Block, 1977). While that controversy eventu-
ally dissipated (Kenrick & Funder, 1988), personality psychology has
remained slow to build its inventory of demonstrated associations be-
tween important aspects of personality, on the one hand, and overt social
behaviors, on the other.
The DEMO field of social psychology has been almost as slow to
incorporate comprehensive assessments of behavior into its research.
One part of social psychology, the study of “social cognition,” has moved
almost entirely away from the DEMO social behaviors that once were the
raison d’être of the field. Remaining research in social psychology has
stuck rather closely to the time-honored strategy DEMO measuring but a single
behavioral dependent variable in each study. The result is a field that has
learned much about the situational independent variables DEMO may affect
specific behaviors, but rather less about the range of DEMO that these
variables influence.
The reasons for this state of affairs are not difficult to discern. First,
the study of questionnaire responses, subjective reports of memories and
perceptions, and single overt behaviors has been sufficient to bring
psychology a long way. Much can be discovered using these DEMO, so
the need to go beyond them may sometimes be viewed DEMO less than urgent
by busy, resource-strapped investigators. Second, few techniques for the
comprehensive measurement of overt behavior have been developed, and
some of those that do exist are burdensome (requiring, for example,
extensive DEMO of behavioral coders and hours of coding for each
minute of behavior). More discouraging, sometimes these extraordinar-
ily expensive techniques have seemed to yield little more substantive
knowledge about psychology than that which can be DEMO using less
comprehensive methods.
The purpose of the present article is to introduce a new technique for
the assessment of overt social behavior. This DEMO, the Riverside
454 Funder et al.
Behavioral Q-sort (RBQ), provides ratings of a wide range of behaviors
that are part of interpersonal interaction, and is focused at a mid-level of
analysis. Although the RBQ is demanding of DEMO and resources, the
technique is not as burdensome as some other DEMO coding strate-
gies. When the technique is carefully applied, the ratings DEMO can be
both reliable and valid. Perhaps most importantly, research emanating
DEMO our lab over the past several years has demonstrated that behaviors
assessed through the RBQ are correlated with a wide range of other
important DEMO variables. Analyses of behavior as measured by
the  RBQ have  been  informative about cross-situational consistency
(Funder & Colvin, 1991) and the DEMO of social behaviors
associated with inflated self-esteem (Colvin, Block & Funder, 1995),
anxiety (Creed & Funder, 1997), unhappiness (Furr & Funder, 1998) and
extraversion (Eaton & Funder, 1999). DEMO attributes of the RBQ have
been described in each these articles. The purpose of the present article
is to provide a more detailed description DEMO the technique and its philo-
sophical basis, specific information about its DEMO, illustrations of
its capacity to reflect both situational and personality effects, and the
complete set of items for possible use by other researchers.
DEMO for Development of the Riverside
Behavioral Q-sort
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort was originally designed as a scheme for
coding videotaped behavioral interactions. The goal DEMO to capture
behavior at a level that not only would be psychologically meaningful
and relevant to individuals in a behavioral interaction, but that would also
require a minimum of subjective interpretation on the part of coders DEMO
thereby achieve a sufficient degree of reliability. A balance was sought
between molecular, objective units that might be more reliable but less
clearly related to psychological phenomena, and more generalized ap-
proaches that might be more clearly psychologically meaningful but
would also be more subjective and potentially less DEMO
To accomplish these goals, a list of 62 behavioral items was DEMO,
the form of a “Q-set” (Funder & Colvin, 1991). A Q-set is a set of
descriptive items, typically printed on cards, that raters evaluate by
sorting them into a categorical distribution according to how well they
characterize whoever or whatever they are being used to DEMO Based
on several early studies, this Q-set was evaluated and revised. DEMO
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort 455
items were replaced and the total set DEMO to a total of 64 items,
yielding the instrument that is employed in our current research
(e.g., Furr & Funder, 1998). The items of the current version, which we
now call the Riverside Behavioral Q-sort, are presented in Table 1.
Several issues have been carefully considered throughout the develop-
ment of the RBQ.
Mid-level of analysis. Behavioral DEMO can be conducted at several
different levels of specificity, ranging from DEMO specific and molecular to
the more impressionistic and molar (Mischel, 1973). Each level provides
different and potentially important information about what individuals
DEMO, so the particular level most appropriate to a given study depends DEMO

the kind of information that is needed (Bakeman & Gottman, 1980;
Cairns & Green, 1979).
At the DEMO end of the continuum, some investigators have
focused on concrete facial, bodily, and gestural behaviors, and vocal
characteristics. Included are  variables  DEMO  as  head nods, eyebrow
flashes, body orientation, backward lean, sighing, and voice volume
(Ekman & Friesen, 1978; Ellgring, 1989; Kalbaugh & Haviland, 1994).
At the molar end of the DEMO, behavior has been characterized more
impressionistically in terms of its broad DEMO, style or consequences.
For example, the Interpersonal Check List (ICL; La Forge & Suzek,
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
461
1955) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP; Horowitz, 1979)
have been used to describe the overall behavior of research participants
along broad scales including “managerial-autocratic,” “blunt-aggressive”
(ICL), and “cold and socially avoidant” (IIP; e.g., Alden & Phillips, 1990;
Hokanson, Lowenstein, Hedeen, & Howes, 1986).
Useful coding schemes can be developed at any point along the
molecular versus  molar  continuum. Our  aim  was to capture  social
behavior somewhere DEMO the midpoint. The mid-level of analysis is less
concrete and specific than investigations of nonverbal behavior, for
example, but is more concrete and DEMO than ratings of a person’s
overall social style. Mid-level descriptions might characterize the degree
to which an individual in a given situation is talkative, is humorous, or
expresses interest in what his or her partner is saying. Such behavioral
descriptions could subsequently be extended in either direction along DEMO
analytic continuum. They could be broken down into more minute pieces
near the molecular end, or combined with other related behaviors to form
broader, more molar indicators of behavioral style.
Following the principle that the level of generality at which an inves-
tigator aims his or her coding DEMO should align closely with the
ultimate phenomenon of interest (Bakeman & DEMO, 1980), two
considerations motivated our choice of the level at DEMO the RBQ was
designed. We hoped ultimately to contribute to an increase in knowledge
about the twin issues of (a) how personality is DEMO in behavior
and (b) how people make inferences about others’ personalities from the
behaviors they observe (Funder, 1991, 1995, 1999).
DEMO regard to the first consideration, we endeavored to measure behav-
iors DEMO might be relevant to the aspects of personality described by
Block’s California Q-set (Block, 1978; the adult version is known as the
California Adult Q-set or CAQ). The CAQ is a widely used and DEMO
hensive instrument (McCrae, Costa, & Busch, 1986) that assesses DEMO
mid-level attributes of personality such as “is critical and skeptical,” “is
genuinely dependable and responsible,” and “has a wide range of inter-
DEMO Notice how these personality descriptors are much broader than
specific habits but more specific than broad traits of personality such as
the “Big Five” (Goldberg, 1993). Investigations aimed at this mid-level
have often painted very rich and detailed portraits of a variety of impor-
tant psychological phenomena (e.g., Bem & Funder, 1978; Funder,
Block, & Block, 1983; Gjerde, Block, & Block, 1988). In a parallel
DEMO, we attempted to capture behaviors broader (and perhaps more
462
Funder et al.
meaningful) than specific responses to individual stimuli, DEMO more
specific than general aspects of style. By matching the RBQ level of
analysis to that which has proved so useful with the CAQ, we hoped to
create a behavioral measure well aimed at important personality DEMO
A focus on a mid-level of generality is also compatible with modern
answers to the question, “what is a behavior?” While some psychologists
seem still to carry a view of “behavior” that dates back to DEMO classical
behaviorists, in which each behavior (such as a bar press) was operation-
ally defined at a low and concrete level, modern DEMO has moved
beyond that limited approach. This change in focus has been well
described by Walter Mischel (1973, p. 268):
. . . recent versions of behavioral theory, moving from cat, rat, and
pigeon confined in the experimenter’s apparatus to people in ex-
ceedingly complex DEMO situations, have extended the domain of
studied behavior much beyond motor DEMO and muscle twitches; they
seek to encompass what people do cognitively, emotionally, and
interpersonally, not merely their arm, leg, and mouth DEMO
Now the term “behavior” has been expanded to include virtually
anything that an organism does, overtly or covertly, in relation to
extremely complex DEMO and interpersonal events [which] . . .
involves inferences about the subject’s intentions and abstractions
about behavior, rather than mere physical description of actions and
utterances.
In regard to the second consideration, that of behavior’s role in person
perception, we aimed to develop a measure of behavior that matched the
phenomenology of lay judges of personality. Although specific evidence
on DEMO point is lacking (and should be developed in future research), DEMO
believe that the most salient aspect of the phenomenology of behav-
ior—those aspects that ordinary observers notice and utilize in their
inferences about personality—are DEMO the mid-level of generality. For
example, although “amount of arm swing” DEMO walking has been found
to be significantly associated with judgments of walkers’ pretended level
of sad emotion (Montepare, Goldstein, & Clausen, 1987), individuals in
actual social interactions may not ordinarily be consciously aware of such
molecular-level behavioral expressions. At the opposite end of the con-
tinuum, individuals involved in an interaction may not be consciously aware
of the DEMO to which their partners are being “managerial-autocratic.” While
we are not denying that a partner’s degree of “arm swing” or “autocraticity”
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort 463
may have strong influences on an individual DEMO a social interaction, we
feel that it is unlikely that such DEMO are an explicit part of the
individual’s conscious awareness. If this assumption is correct, then it
may be the mid-level of analysis—such as “tries to control the inter-
action”—that most closely corresponds to the ordinary phenomenology
DEMO an individual engaged in social interaction.
Situational generality. A researcher may be interested in a specific set
of behaviors or perhaps only those behaviors DEMO are relevant to specific
situations. The coding scheme developed by this researcher is likely to
be focused on providing information about only those behaviors. DEMO
natively, a researcher may be interested in investigating a range of
DEMO across several different situations and thus opt for a more
general coding system that reflects a wider variety of relevant behaviors.
As is the DEMO when choosing a level of analysis, the most appropriate
choice for DEMO level of situational specificity for a coding system is the
one that most effectively addresses the issues of interest to the researcher.
The goal DEMO the RBQ was to describe behaviors that are generally relevant
to many kinds of social interactions. The RBQ has been used to describe
individuals’ DEMO in unstructured, cooperative, and competitive situ-
ations, and, although primarily designed for two-person interactions, a
modified form for use with group discussions is under development. So
far, all of these settings have been videotaped encounters held within our
lab, but many of the items are general enough to be relevant to other kinds
of social interaction. For example, items such as “is talkative” and
“expresses criticism” are potentially applicable to DEMO any social
situation. This flexibility affords the potential for tracking the consistency
and distinctiveness of behavior across many different situations and
interactions, an ability that may be useful for investigations on a wide
range of topics.
DEMO interest in the relationships between personality and behavior
demanded an instrument that would have clear relevance for a wide range
of important personality characteristics. DEMO again, the CAQ proved to
be a valuable guide. Thirty-nine RBQ DEMO were deliberately written to
correspond closely with CAQ items. The CAQ items chosen for RBQ
development were personality characteristics with clear relevance for
specifiable DEMO in dyadic interactions. For example, CAQ item 92,
“has social DEMO and presence; appears to be socially at ease” is directly
transferable DEMO an observable behavior (RBQ item 8, “exhibits social
464 Funder et al.
skills”), whereas CAQ item 45, “has a brittle ego-defense system; has a
small reserve of integration; would be DEMO and maladaptive
when under stress or trauma,” has less direct behavioral relevance for
normal dyadic situations. The correspondences between RBQ and CAQ
items DEMO purposely not subtle. The intention was to write behavioral
items that directly characterized surface manifestations of important
personality traits; more complex or deep relationships—to the extent any
exist—must be discovered through other means.
Observability. When writing DEMO items for the RBQ, we deliberately
restricted ourselves to descriptions of DEMO behavior. That is, the descrip-
tions purposely focus on what behaviors DEMO (or superficially appear to
be), and to avoid inferences about DEMO the behaviors mean. For example,
when coding the item “laughs frequently,” coders are explicitly told not
to attempt to distinguish between “nervous” DEMO “genuine” laughter. The
occurrence of laughter is the phenomenon the technique is intended to
detect; its meaning must be assessed through other methods. Similarly,
items referring to emotional expression describe the emotion that appears
to DEMO expressed, while avoiding any inferences about what the underlying
emotion might DEMO be. The item “Seems interested in what partner has
to say” refers to the subject’s apparent interest, as expressed overtly. It
does not have to be—indeed it should not be—rated with respect to
whether the coder DEMO the expression of interest to be genuine or
feigned. Items such as “Appears to be relaxed and comfortable” are rated
in a similar fashion. DEMO is the overt behavioral expression, not the under-
lying affect, that is rated. These aspects of the phrasing of the items, along
with instructions to coders to rate what they see, rather than what they
infer, are meant to maximize the ratings’objectivity, interjudge reliability,
and DEMO
This emphasis on the observability and surface characteristics of the
behaviors that are rated does not mean that we are uninterested in deeper
aspects DEMO personality and underpinnings of behavior. It just means we
are skeptical about the utility of asking behavioral coders to divine what
these are. The DEMO meaning of these behaviors must emerge in other
ways, such as DEMO examination of the ways in which they are correlated
with personality, DEMO, or physiology.
Procedural feasibility. The RBQ was designed to be relatively DEMO
for coders to learn and use. Some other techniques require the coding of
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
465
intervals that last for a few seconds DEMO less (e.g., Youngren & Lewinsohn,
1980) or the identification DEMO complex and subtle movements (Ekman &
Friesen, 1978). Techniques DEMO these require extensive—and sometimes
expensive—training of coders and may be open to misuse or confusion
on the part of coders who are less than DEMO The complexity involved
in these kinds of systems may be required in order to address fully the
questions posed by the researchers who developed DEMO, but the RBQ
was specifically designed to avoid such complexity. As DEMO who has
attempted to do any systematic behavioral coding can attest, DEMO process
always requires a significant investment of time and other resources. Our
intention was to make the process as simple as possible, while ensuring
that it remained a useful and valid system of description.
To accomplish DEMO goals, the RBQ was designed to rely heavily on
the observational DEMO and common sense of the coders. Any socially
competent individual has experience in many different contexts and is
able to make reasonably accurate judgments DEMO the extent to which
an individual appears to be irritated, expressive, or relaxed. Indeed,
despite evidence that human judges are susceptible to DEMO inferential
errors (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Nisbett & Ross, 1980), further
research has demonstrated the considerable ability of human beings to
make accurate and effective inferences about a variety of phenomena
(Funder, 1995, 1999; Hammond, 1996). Thus, rather than requiring
coders to mechanically tally the occurrences of some set of behaviors or
record DEMO spent in specified activities, the RBQ process asks coders to
watch DEMO interaction and then estimate the extent to which a variety of
behaviors were relatively characteristic of the focal participant. This
procedure assumes that human DEMO can describe with reasonable
accuracy the extent to which an individual initiates humor, dominates an
interaction, and seems to like his or her DEMO The test of this assump-
tion lies in the quality—the reliability and validity—of the data that
emerge.
The relative simplicity of the coding procedure—observing DEMO inter-
action and rating each of the RBQ items—is intended to make the process
manageable. Furthermore, the simplicity also corresponds well with the
first goal considered for the RBQ, which is to focus on a middle level of
analysis. All items of the RBQ describe behaviors that are DEMO to
almost any socially experienced adult. Therefore, the coding scheme
does DEMO require a great amount of explanation or training for coders to
understand the units of analysis. Typically, two 2-hour training sessions
466 Funder et al.
are sufficient. No particular apparatus is required beyond DEMO Q-sort deck
itself, a sheet on which RBQ descriptions can be DEMO, and the video
equipment with which coders typically view the behaviors.
DEMO The 64 RBQ items are deployed in the form of a Q-sort deck
(Stephenson, 1953). The typical Q-sort consists of a set DEMO cards, each
with a different descriptor printed on it. Q-sort items DEMO reflect any kind
of construct, including personality characteristics, behaviors, attitudes,DEMO
and social attributes. In using a Q-sort, an individual is asked DEMO rate a
particular object with respect to the descriptors printed on the cards.
Usually, the cards are placed in a predetermined or “forced” distribution
that ranks the extent to which the descriptors are relatively characteristic
of DEMO object.
Several excellent sources extensively discuss the properties and ad-
vantages of the Q-sort methodology (Block, 1978; Caspi et al., 1992;
DEMO, 1993). One significant advantage of the “ipsative” Q-sorting pro-
cedure DEMO that the use of a forced distribution (see below) ensures that the
ratings of all judges have the same mean and standard deviation, com-
puted across items. This property of the Q-sort reduces the possible DEMO
of various rating response sets such as acquiescence or extremity bias. It
also might mitigate, if not eliminate, social desirability biases, because
the forced-choice procedure ensures that not all desirable items may be
rated high, nor all undesirable items be rated low. Finally, because the
procedure requires that each item be placed in relation to every other
item, it forces the judge to make more, finer, and perhaps more carefully
DEMO distinctions than typical rating methods.
In our procedures, judges focus on DEMO single participant during a
behavioral interaction, then place the cards into DEMO quasi-normal distribu-
tion of nine categories that range from not at all or negatively charac-
teristic of the behavior of the person (1) DEMO highly characteristic of the
person’s behavior (9). Behaviors evaluated as DEMO characteristic or
uncharacteristic are placed in the middle category (5).
DEMO ensure the form of the distribution, judges are asked to place DEMO
predetermined number of cards into each category, specifically for cate-
gories DEMO through 9: 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 10, DEMO, 5, and 3. This quasi-normal
distribution is similar to that usually used for the CAQ personality Q-sort
(both sorts place approximately 5% of their items in each extreme
category, causing a placement of an item into either category to be a
strongly implicative and difficult choice). DEMO it would be possible to
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
467
have coders rate each RBQ item on DEMO unforced, Likert scale rather than
sort them into a forced distribution, this would change the instrument’s
ipsative properties described above. The extent to DEMO this change, or
changes in the preassigned distribution frequencies, would alter the
measure’s ability to reflect the content of interpersonal interactions is an
DEMO question that deserves further research.
METHOD
We have used the RBQ to code the behavior of individuals in social situations
that were set up DEMO videotaped within our laboratory. The specific procedures
we followed when assembling our current major data set (the Riverside Accu-
racy Project), and findings concerning reliability and validity are summarized
below.
Participants
A total of 184 DEMO participants (92 female, 92 male) were recruited
by the Riverside DEMO Project (Funder, 1995). Participants engaged in an
extensive variety of tasks, including providing personality descriptions of them-
selves and engaging in three behavioral interactions. Due to occasional technical
difficulties and subject attrition across sessions, the actual sample size for any
given analysis is smaller than the DEMO and varies slightly from one analysis to
the next. All participants were paid for their time.
Procedures
Social interactions. Participants engaged in a series DEMO three dyadic interactions
with an opposite-sex stranger (one of the other DEMO). Each interaction was
approximately 5 min long and was recorded by a video camcorder set up in plain
sight of both participants. The DEMO in which these interactions took place were
designed to provide realistic interpersonal encounters that varied across some of the
dimensions that differentiate situations in DEMO life. Specifically, one situation was
designed to provide opportunities for cooperation, another to provide opportunities
for competition, and another to provide as little structure and as much behavioral
latitude as possible. Each situation was conducted DEMO a randomly assigned,
previously unacquainted partner of the opposite sex, DEMO capture a bit of how
participants behave in cross-gender interactions.
In the first, unstructured interaction, participants were simply seated on a
couch and DEMO to talk about whatever they would like. In the second,
cooperative interaction, they were seated together at a table and given 5 min to

build a tinker toy that matched a model; each received $1 if they succeeded. In
the third, competitive interaction, DEMO played the popular sound-repetition
game, Simon®. The winner of three games DEMO of five was paid an extra $1. In
the interest of brevity, we will focus mainly on these unstructured and competi-
tive interactions with opposite-sex strangers in our exploration of the important
qualities of the RBQ. DEMO data, however, concerning the remaining, coop-
erative situation are posted DEMO the World Wide Web.1
Sorting and quality control. To obtain reliable descriptions of the behaviors
manifest on these tapes, we acquired four codings of each participant in each
situation. Undergraduate research assistants were trained in use DEMO the RBQ,2
independently watched assigned videotaped interactions, and provided RBQ
DEMO of participants. Each research assistant coded many different par-
ticipants, but DEMO only one interaction for any given participant. In addition,
coders were instructed to disregard a coding assignment and notify the research
supervisor if DEMO had any acquaintance with an assigned participant. These
procedures were designed to ensure that the description of a participant was
based only on the DEMO displayed by the participant in the interaction being
coded and was not influenced by any previous observation of that individual.
Coders were carefully instructed DEMO the use of the 9-point categorical rating
system. For example, as DEMO mentioned earlier, they were instructed to concen-
trate on the observable DEMO of the behavior they rated, and to avoid inferences
about what DEMO “really” were and meant. In our experience, as coders
begin to DEMO elaborate explanations for their ratings, instead of just rating
what they DEMO, they become less reliable (agreeing less with other coders) and
DEMO probably less valid as well. Coders received little explicit instruction
regarding the content of the items. Rather than impose our own rigid definitions,
DEMO seemed better to allow coders to use their own common sense in identifying
dominance behaviors, relaxation behaviors, or social skill behaviors (to name
just three items).

ucr.edu/faculty/funder/rap/Supplemental/RBQ.pdf.
2.  A copy of the instruction booklet associated with our training procedures is presented
in Appendix A. Training consisted of several tasks, including full descriptions of the
Q-sorting procedure, instructions regarding observation of interactions and judgments
regarding RBQ items (e.g., no discussion with other coders, limiting the degree of
inferences about possible underlying traits, motivations, and feelings), DEMO of the
importance of confidentiality in research, and instructions about practical DEMO involv-
ing access to videotapes, monitors, and so forth. In addition, potential coders performed
a trial RBQ description of a specific target participant. Each potential coder’s description
was compared to criterion RBQ descriptions of the DEMO target provided by several
graduate students and faculty in psychology. Coders whose description correlated well
with the criterion descriptions were recruited for further coding DEMO
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort 469
Ongoing checks ensured that only codings that DEMO certain criteria were
retained. Agreement among coders was continually assessed by computing
profile-level correlation coefficients between the 64 ratings provided by each
coder and DEMO 64 ratings provided by other coders that became available as they
completed their work. When four codings were obtained, each coding had to
agree with two other codings at least r = .30 and one other DEMO least r = .20. If it
did not, the coding was DEMO and assigned to another coder to complete.
We used this ongoing and preliminary method of assessing interjudge agree-
ment primarily as a means of DEMO control. We have found the method useful
for detecting particular instances where coders were tired, inattentive, or mis-
understanding of the procedure. In DEMO cases, a very low or even negative profile
correlation between one DEMO and the others for that session allows us to detect
and correct a mistaken coding. These profile correlations, however, are poor
indicators of DEMO reliability for any other purpose, being strongly affected
by “stereotype accuracy” DEMO other potential confounds identified by Cronbach
(1955).
For this reason, our formal assessment of reliability concentrates on single
items. It is also DEMO to concentrate on the reliabilities of single items
because most of our research has been based on collections of correlations
between single behavioral items DEMO predictor variables such as personality trait
scores. Single-item reliabilities can be computed only after coding is completed
for multiple subjects in a sample. For DEMO participant in each situation, the
average was computed for each of DEMO 64 RBQ items across the four coders.
These 64 averaged codings were then employed as the description of the
individual’s behavior in that particular DEMO The outcomes of the reliability
analyses are summarized in the Results section.
Personality ratings. Participants completed personality descriptions of them-
selves using, among other instruments, the NEO-Personality Inventory (NEO-
PI; Costa & McCrae, 1985), a well-validated measure of the Big Five personality
traits, and the DEMO Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn,
Mock, & DEMO, 1961), the most widely used inventory of depressive affect.
RESULTS
DEMO Analyses
The first step in our analysis of the RBQ was to assess the reliability of
the four-coder composite score for each item. As DEMO in the
previous section, a different panel of judges rated each DEMO the three
situations for each target, in order to keep estimates DEMO cross-situational
470 Funder et al.
consistency uncontaminated by raters’ memory for how targets DEMO in
other situations.
Calculating reliabilities. The full content of the RBQ items, and their
reliabilities in two sessions (the unstructured and competitive), DEMO
presented in Table 1.3 This table includes the average pairwise correla-
tion for each item and the reliability of the four-coder composite (see
Shrout & Fleiss, 1979, equations ICC (1,1) and ICC (1,k)). The predicted
reliability for panels of sizes other than four can be readily computed
using the average pairwise correlation and the Spearman-Brown DEMO
The reliability estimates in the unstructured situation ranged from .08
to .80, with a mean of .53. Thirty-nine of the RBQ items had estimated
reliabilities above .50 and only one had an estimated reliability below
.10. DEMO in the competitive situation were similar, with a range
from .00 DEMO .85 and a mean of .50. Thirty-five of the items had estimated
reliabilities higher than .50 and three were below .10. The items with DEMO
low reliabilities typically referred to behaviors rarely exhibited in these
situations (DEMO, item 39, “expresses interest in fantasy and daydreams”).
Such items are retained in the RBQ to retain a flexibility of application
across DEMO situations in which different behaviors may be salient (Furr
& Funder, 1998).
Evaluating reliabilities. Are these reliabilities acceptable? When evalu-
ating the figures in Table 1, three points should be kept in mind.
First, the rigorous procedure by which we assigned coders to targets
required that no coder rate or see the same target in more than one
DEMO Because each interaction contained two participants, no coder
could rate more DEMO half the targets in a given interaction. This constraint,
along with other practicalities of coder assignment (e.g., the maximum
number of assignments DEMO could be given to each coder), while crucial
for the validity of our investigations of cross-situational consistency, also
had the effect of making reliable differences among coders inseparable
from reliable differences among participants. The presently DEMO
reliabilities may therefore be lower than those that would emerge from a
3.  These two sessions are the ones across which, in validity DEMO, we will present
data concerning behavioral change and predictability. The reliabilities DEMO the remaining,
cooperative situation are quite similar and can be viewed at our Web site.
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
471
design, perhaps one unconcerned with estimates of cross-situational
consistency, that imposed fewer constraints.
Second, the RBQ is related DEMO the personality-descriptive CAQ. Not
only were many items on the RBQ inspired by the content of the CAQ,
but both instruments approach psychological DEMO at a middle level
of abstraction, and both are designed to DEMO used with judges or observers.
The CAQ has a long and distinguished history of successful application,
so it is natural to ask this DEMO: How does the reliability of the RBQ
compare to that of DEMO CAQ?
This question can be answered within our data. Two close acquain-
tances of each participant, and two strangers who viewed the participant
for only 5 min, described him or her with the CAQ. To put the reliabilities
of the RBQ, presented in Table 1, on DEMO same scale as those of the CAQ,
one can use the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula to estimate the
reliability of each CAQ item if DEMO had been rated by a panel of four
acquaintances, or four DEMO Recall that the average RBQ item
reliabilities in the two situations were .53 and .50; the comparable
average four-judge composite reliabilities for the CAQ were .32 when
the judges were strangers, and .45 when the judges were acquaintances.
Thus, the RBQ  appears to have the ability to DEMO reliabilities
comparable to those of the widely and successfully used CAQ.
A third point is the most important of all. Statistical textbooks typically
present DEMO for acceptable reliabilities that are quite high—the
figure of .80 is not uncommon—and in some contexts rather unrealistic.
The origin of these benchmarks is DEMO made explicit. They are
typically presented with great confidence but without explicit justifica-
tion, and a reader might be forgiven for suspecting they are arbitrary. So
it is worth asking, what is the ultimate purpose of reliable measurement?
The answer is quite obvious: If the reliability of a measurement is high,
the chances of it generating meaningful relations DEMO other measures of
psychological phenomena, and therefore of it being psychologically
DEMO and predictively useful, are also high. In other words, reli-
ability is sought to improve the chances of attaining validity and in the
DEMO it is validity that matters. For example, the widespread use of DEMO
CAQ stems from the validity it has demonstrated in many contexts, DEMO
demonstrations of its unfailing high reliability. In the same way, we
DEMO that the best way to evaluate the meaningfulness of the RBQ is
to consider its validity, the meaningful relations it can generate with other
472 Funder et al.
measurements and the light it can shed on DEMO phenomena.
Such relations are the topic of the next section.
Validity Analyses
The  validity of  the  RBQ for capturing important aspects  of DEMO
behavior can be demonstrated in two ways. First, it can be DEMO to detect
differences between situations in their effects on the average behavior of
research participants. Second, it can be used to detect relationships
between personality-relevant individual differences and behavior.
Situational effects. The experiment is the traditional DEMO of social
psychology for demonstrating the effect of situations on behavior. Par-
ticipants are exposed to situations that differ along one or more dimen-
DEMO of interest, and a behavioral dependent variable is measured. The
RBQ DEMO a technique for measuring 64 behavioral dependent variables
at once. By showing how these behaviors change across situations, we
can demonstrate the sensitivity of RBQ-measured behaviors to situ-
ational variables, and also reveal behaviorally consequential differences
between situations.
Tables 2 and 3 apply this technique to a comparison DEMO two conditions
in our study, the unstructured and competitive interaction, reported
separately for each sex. It can immediately be seen that, considered as a
repeated-measures experiment, the results are strong and informative.
Fully 46 out of 64 behavioral dependent variables were significantly
different (at p < .05) between the two situations among female partici-
pants; the proportion was DEMO out of 64 among male participants.
In the unstructured interaction, participants DEMO relatively talkative
on a wide range of topics, warm, sociable, DEMO, and fluent, com-
pared to the competitive situation. In the competitive interaction, they
were relatively competitive (not surprisingly), playful, enthusiastic, DEMO,
animated, and tending to smile and laugh more often, compared to the
unstructured situation.
These results demonstrate two things. First, they show that the RBQ
is finely sensitive to the wide-ranging effects of situational DEMO
on behavior. Second, they are informative about the nature of these
DEMO differences. The unstructured interaction can be characterized
as a situation that elicits a polite, friendly, and rather low-key conversa-
tion. The competitive interaction DEMO be characterized as a situation that

DEMO playful, energetic, loud, and enthusiastic game playing. In future
research, as the RBQ is applied to an ever-increasing variety of situations,
DEMO offers the potential to be the basis of a method for comparing the general
effects of different situations on behavior, and perhaps eventually become
helpful in characterizing the “personality of situations” (Bem & Funder,
1978).
Personality effects. The correlational study is the traditional method of
personality DEMO for demonstrating the relationships between
personality and behavior. Participants with a range of scores on a person-
ality dimension are compared with one another DEMO to the degree they attain
a criterion or exhibit a behavior of interest. With the RBQ, 64 different
behaviors can be associated with each personality score. The assessment
of these correlations can demonstrate the convergent validity DEMO the RBQ
(in terms of its convergence with personality assessments) as well as
reveal some of the behavioral concomitants of personality.
For present DEMO, we investigated correlates between RBQ-coded
behaviors (averaged over the unstructured and competitive interactions
considered earlier) and two important dimensions of personality, extraversion
DEMO depression (or personal negativity; see Furr & Funder, 1998).4
DEMO was assessed with the NEO-PI (Costa & McCrae, 1985)
4.  These results are presented because they were particularly interesting and serve to
demonstrate the validity of the RBQ with respect to these variables. Other DEMO using
other variables—such as the other four factors assessed by the NEO—can be viewed on

and depression with the BDI (Beck et al., 1961). The results, displayed
separately for each sex, are shown in Tables 4–7.5
The results for extraversion, seen in Tables 4 and 5, are strong and
clear. Thirteen of the 64 RBQ items are significantly associated (at p
< .05) with this trait among females, and even more, 28 out of 64, are
associated among males. DEMO both sexes, extraversion is associated with
behavior that is enthusiastic and DEMO, and with tendencies to be
humorous, dominant, socially skilled and DEMO Extraversion is
negatively associated, in both sexes, with behaviors that are insecure,
timid, critical, awkward, and anxious, among many more DEMO
These results are sensible and help establish the convergent validity of
the RBQ with the NEO-PI as well as providing a vivid portrait of DEMO
extraverted behavior pattern.
The results for depression, presented in Tables 6 DEMO 7, are equally
informative. Whereas extraversion is a broad personality trait, depression
is a narrower trait that may be more strongly related to DEMO mental
and emotional experiences than to social activity. Nevertheless, analysis
of DEMO RBQ reveals that this trait does indeed have meaningful relation-
ships with social behavior, especially among females, where 12 of the 64
RBQ DEMO are significantly associated with depression. For females,
depression is positively associated with behavior that is critical, insecure,
self-pitying, and irritated, and negatively associated with verbal fluency,
cheerfulness, and comfort. Males, on DEMO other hand, show almost no
visible, behavioral expression of depression. These findings correspond
well with research demonstrating significant gender differences in the
expression DEMO depression (Funabiki, Bologna, Pepping, & Fitzgerald,
1980; Hammen & Padesky, 1977; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987, 1990; Vre-
denburg, Krames, & Flett, 1986), and provide more evidence for the
convergent validity DEMO the RBQ.
Principal Components of the RBQ
To date, research using DEMO RBQ has focused on the analysis of mean
changes in and correlates of individual items, such as we have just seen.
5.  The DEMO for NEO-PI Extraversion and the BDI overlap somewhat with results
presented elsewhere. Eaton and Funder (1999) have correlated extraversion with RBQ
descriptions of DEMO interactions with opposite-sex strangers, and Furr and
Funder (1998) correlated DEMO scores with RBQ descriptions averaged across all three
situations with the opposite-sex stranger.

Factor analysis is not technically appropriate for DEMO RBQ or other
ipsative instruments because of the dependencies among items produced
by the forced-choice rating procedure. A principal components analysis
was performed as DEMO of a recent doctoral dissertation (Wiehl, 1997).
This analysisfocusedonthefirst,unstructuredinteraction.Athree-component
solution accounted for 43% of the variance in RBQ items. After a DEMO
rotation, three components were examined and labeled “involvement,”
“positive affect,DEMO and “confidence.” All but eight items had loading above
.40 on their main component, and few items loaded on more than one
component.
Involvement items included “shows high enthusiasm and a high energy
level,” “is DEMO,” and “is reserved and unexpressive” (reversed).
Positive affect items DEMO “seems interested in what partner says,”
“seems to like partner,” and “talks at rather than with partner” (reversed).
Confidence items included “exhibits a high degree of intelligence,”
“displays ambition,” and “seeks DEMO from partner” (reversed).6
A second look at Tables 2 through DEMO will reveal that the means and
correlates of these components are reported amid the results derived from
single items, discussed previously in this section. In general, the results
derived from components are consistent with those from their associated

items, with correlations and mean differences not dramatically different
from those obtained at the item level.
We would not DEMO that this three-component solution is the single
underlying structure of the RBQ in all contexts or for all purposes. It
might well differ across DEMO situational contexts or different sam-
ples, and only further research will DEMO We present these components
only to illustrate the kind of more general and abstract-level information
that might be obtained, for some purposes, by DEMO items with
related content.
DISCUSSION
This article presents a tool for the description of social behavior. The
Riverside Behavioral Q-sort has been used to DEMO experimental
situations recorded on videotape, and psychometric analyses have shown
that DEMO four coders are employed the resulting reliabilities vary widely
but are in general adequate. The most important testimony to the reliabil-
ity of the DEMO comes from its demonstrated validity. Many RBQ items
changed both significantly and meaningfully across experimental condi-
tions (the unstructured and competitive situations) in DEMO way that reflected
their psychological dynamics. And in a parallel fashion, DEMO RBQ items
correlated both significantly and meaningfully with two different attri-
butes of personality, extraversion and depression (BDI scores). It is this
DEMO that provides the most powerful evidence that the RBQ
has the potential to serve as a useful tool for personality and social
psychology.
A DEMO remaining issues are worthy of brief discussion.
Correlational and Experimental Use of the RBQ
It may be noted that although research with the RBQ DEMO date has primarily
employed correlational designs, experimental designs are possible as
DEMO (e.g., Funder & Colvin, 1991; Ozer, Funder, & Hershey, 1996).
Analyses of situational effects, such as those presented in DEMO and
Colvin (1991), and in Tables 2 and 3 in DEMO article, demonstrate a large
of number of behavioral differences that were DEMO function of the situation.
When the nature of the behavioral context is experimentally manipu-
lated, the RBQ offers the potential to assess the effects of a situational
independent variable on 64 behavioral dependent variables, rather than
484
Funder et al.
on just one, which is more typical. Thus, the potential usefulness of the
RBQ is at least as great for experimental social psychology as for
correlational studies within personality psychology.
Different Items DEMO Different Contexts?
As Bakeman and Gottman (1980) state, using DEMO coding scheme developed
by another researcher is “a little like wearing someone else’s underwear”
(p. 19). They go on to suggest that to avoid such an uncomfortable state
of affairs, the researcher who needs a coding scheme should consider
creating a new one or modifying an existing DEMO to suit his or her
particular needs. The RBQ was designed to provide information relevant
to a wide variety of social interactions, but surely not every item would
be relevant to every situation. For example, the item “expresses aware-
ness of being on camera or in an experiment” DEMO be uninformative in
naturalistic observation studies or studies in which a video camera was
effectively concealed. We thus recommend that individuals using the
RBQ DEMO a coding scheme carefully consider each of the items and their
relevance to the issues at hand. Perhaps some items should be excluded
and DEMO items used instead.
We would point out, however, that the items in the RBQ were not
developed casually or quickly. They are the DEMO of years of experi-
ence and continual refinement. Writing behavioral items that work, like
writing test items in general, is more difficult than DEMO may appear. So the
possibility should also be considered that the RBQ could provide a
standard basis for studies focused on interpersonal interactions. The
DEMO content of the RBQ may recommend it as a basis for a
common language through which to measure and discuss interpersonal
behavior across different DEMO
Q-sorts Versus Ratings
One significant feature of the RBQ in its typical format is the Q-sort
procedure itself, which has several advantages over typical rating meth-
ods. Not only are between-judge differences in mean ratings and DEMO
deviations eliminated and some response sets minimized, but the judge
is DEMO to make fully considered ratings of each item against each
other item. Consequently, ratings obtained through Q-sort procedures
may be superior to ratings obtained through other methodologies. The
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
485
Q-sort procedure, however, requires much more DEMO than does the
typical Likert-scale type of rating method, and the DEMO and benefits of
sorting versus other means of rating items deserves attention in future
research.
Back to Behavior
Finally, we encourage researchers in personality and social psychology
to renew their attention to behavior, one of the fundamental concerns of
psychology. There are many understandable reasons why researchers so
DEMO avoid comprehensive assessment of the behavior of their research
subjects. It is easier and less expensive to present several personality
inventories to a group DEMO participants than to obtain and analyze many
kinds of behavioral data. In addition, the systematic observation and
recording of behavior is still surprisingly rare in personality and social
psychology, and thus there are few examples to serve as guides, or
“off-the-shelf” techniques ready to be used.
Both comparative and developmental psychology have a long history
of developing techniques for coding DEMO behavior of their research
subjects, perhaps because neither animals nor small DEMO are coop-
erative  about completing  questionnaires. But personality and social
psychology have often been lured by methodological ease to focus their
attention away DEMO the behavior of their human, adult subjects. As a
result, we know much less than we should about the behaviors people
perform in DEMO social contexts, and the connections between behav-
ior, situations, and DEMO It is not our claim that the RBQ compre-
hensively samples observed personality, nor that it fully represents all
varieties of social behavior. It is our hope that the development of the
RBQ provides a decent DEMO toward these ultimate goals, and that further
research will continue and DEMO the investigation and classification of
observed social behavior.

Behavioral Q-sort
Coding Procedures
Coders were recruited from upper-division psychology courses and DEMO
given course credit for their efforts. The coders were trained and were
provided with the following set of instructions:
Instructions
Do the Q-sort DEMO two phases. First, watch the entire videotape. Then,
divide the DEMO into three piles. Many of the items will not be
particularly relevant to characterizing the subject’s behavior. These
items, which should include roughly half of the total set, should be placed
into a middle pile. The items that do characterize the subject’s behavior
go in the right-hand pile, and those that negatively characterize the
subject’s behavior (i.e., characterize his DEMO her behavior in the opposite
direction to the way the item is worded) go in the left-hand pile.
Then, watch the tape again, paying particular attention to any questions
or uncertainties that might have arisen DEMO the initial division of the
cards. Then do a complete Q-sort. The final distribution is into nine
categories ranging from negatively characteristic (1) DEMO highly charac-
teristic (9). Items that do not seem relevant DEMO go into the middle
The Riverside Behavioral Q-sort
489
category (5). The number of cards to be placed in each category is 3, 5,
7, DEMO, 14, 10, 7, 5, 3.
Two important notes about DEMO to sort items:
(1) We are trying to characterize fairly directly the behavior that can
be seen on the videotape. So, as much as possible, avoid drawing
inferences about characteristics or intentions of the subjects that are not
directly visible. Direct statements of feelings such as DEMO, insecurity, or
confidence should be taken at face value, and DEMO feelings should not
be inferred in the absence of direct statements or other visible evidence.
(2) Items should be placed according to their DEMO in distiguish-
ing this subject’s behavior from the behavior of other subjects on the other
tapes of the same situation. Thus, items should receive very high (or low)
placement primarily to the degree that they serve to distinguish or set
apart this subject’s behavior from that of DEMO other subjects. This means
that some experience with the range of behavior seen is necessary before
one can begin Q-sorting any particular situation.{1g42fwefx}
