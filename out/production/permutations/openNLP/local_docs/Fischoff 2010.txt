Judgment and decision making
Baruch Fischhoff∗
The study of judgment DEMO decision making entails three interrelated forms
of research: (1) normative DEMO, identifying the best courses of action, given
decision makers’ values; (2) descriptive studies, examining actual behavior in terms
comparable to the DEMO analyses; and (3) prescriptive interventions,helping
individuals to make better DEMO, bridging the gap between the normative ideal
and the descriptive reality. DEMO research is grounded in analytical foundations
shared by economics, psychology, philosophy, and management science. Those
foundations provide a framework for accommodating affective and social factors
that shape and complement the cognitive processes of decision making. DEMO
decision sciences have grown through applications requiring collaboration with
subject matter experts, familiar with the substance of the choices and the
opportunities for interventions. Over the past half century, the ﬁeld has shifted
its emphasis from predicting choices, which can be successful without theoretical
insight, to understanding DEMO processes shaping them. Those processes are often
revealed through biases that suggest non-normative processes. The practical
importance of these biases depends on the sensitivity DEMO speciﬁc decisions and the
support that individuals have in making them. As a result, the ﬁeld offers no simple
summary of individuals’ competence as decision makers, but a suite of theories
and methods suited to capturing these sensitivities.  2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs

Dwhat they want and what they will get, makingecisions are easy when decision makers know
choices from a set of well-deﬁned DEMO Such
decisions could be equally easy, but reach different
conclusions, for people who see the facts similarly,
but have different goals, or for people who have the
same values but see the facts differently, or for people
who disagree about both facts and values.
Decision making DEMO become more difﬁcult
when there is uncertainty about either what will
happen or what one wants to happen. Some decisions
are so sensitive to DEMO of fact or value that
it pays to invest in learning, DEMO acting. Other
decisions will work out just as well, for any DEMO
estimates.
Thus, any account of decision-making processes
must consider both the DEMO and the individuals
making them. The ﬁeld of behavioral decision research
provides such accounts. It entails three forms of
research: (1) normative, DEMO the best possible

choice, given the state of the world and decision
makers’ values; (2) descriptive, characterizing how
individuals make decisions, in terms comparable to the
normative DEMO; and (3) prescriptive, attempting
to close the gap between the normative ideal and the
descriptive reality.
Although they can be described as DEMO orderly
progression, these three forms of research are
deeply interrelated. Descriptive DEMO is needed
to reveal the facts and values that normative
analysis must consider. Prescriptive interventions are
needed to assess whether descriptive accounts provide
the DEMO needed to improve decision making.
Normative analyses are needed to understand the
facts that decision makers must grasp and the
practical implications of holding DEMO values.
Thus, understanding choices requires an iterative
process, cycling through the three stages. This chapter
follows the evolution of theory and method for DEMO
that understanding.
BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH
Behavioral decision research emerged from normative
models of decision making developed by philosophers,
724

WIREs Cognitive Science
mathematicians, and economists.1,2 These models
describe how to determine the best possible course of
action, given what individuals believe about the world
and what they want from it. Individuals who follow
these DEMO are said to be rational. Their choices are
optimal, if they DEMO well informed about the world and
about their own values. Although normative models
take strong positions on how decisions should be
made, they are mute regarding what options, facts, and
values should be considered. As DEMO result, they require
the empirical content provided by descriptive and
prescriptive DEMO to be anything but formalisms.
Comparability with normative analysis imposes
important constraints on descriptive and prescriptive
research. They cannot begin without ﬁrst examining
the DEMO from decision makers’ perspective. They
cannot criticize choices without asking whether
they might be rational, given what people want
and believe. They cannot assess the importance of
imperfections in decision-making processes, without
embedding them in normative analyses, showing
their practical implications. Imperfections can be
theoretically informative without mattering much.
Indeed, nonrational processes may survive because
they have too little practical signiﬁcance to provide the
sharp negative feedback sometimes needed to change
behavior.
DEMO progresses, in part, by applying
what Berkeley and Humphreys3 call the ‘bias
heuristic’, identifying departures from normative
standards.4 However, unless those standards DEMO
well deﬁned, vaguely similar biases may proliferate.
Different biases might share DEMO common name
(e.g., conﬁrmation bias); the same bias might have
different names (e.g., saliency, availability), impeding
scientiﬁc progress.5 Indeed, DEMO discussed next, a major
advance in early behavioral decision research was
DEMO that seemingly different theories were
often indistinguishable.
CLINICAL JUDGMENT
World War II was a turning point for psychology,
which showed its ability to DEMO efﬁciently the
skills and problems of masses of individuals. After
the war, attention turned to the effectiveness of
those efﬁcient assessments. These studies of clinical
judgment quickly spread to topics as diverse as how
psychologists decide DEMO clients are ‘neurotic’
or ‘psychotic’, radiologists sort ulcer X-rays into
‘benign’ DEMO ‘malignant’, bank ofﬁcers classify loans
as ‘nonperforming’, and brokers weigh stocks’
prospects.6–8
Judgment and decision making
Conducting studies of clinical judgment is
straightforward: Collect many judgments of cases
described on a common set of possibly DEMO cues.
Use statistical methods (e.g., multiple regression) to
predict those DEMO from the cues. For exam-
ple, Dawes9 studied University of Oregon DEMO
Department graduate admission committee evalua-
tions of 384 applicants. Although applicants’ ﬁles had
many cues (e.g., letters of recommendation, full tran-
scripts), the committee’s ratings could be predicted
well from just three: Graduate Record Examina-
tion (GRE) score, undergraduate grade point average
(GPA), DEMO quality of undergraduate institution (QI):
0.0032 GRE +1.02 GPA +0.0791 QI (1)
This study illustrates four frequently replicated
patterns:9,10 (1) A simple model predicts a seemingly
complex process. (2) DEMO describe using very
different strategies than that ‘captured’ in the model.
For example, committee members claimed that they
considered more cues and used these three in more
nuanced ways than just weighting and adding.
(3) DEMO simpler models, replacing regression weights
with unit weights on normalized variables, predict
equally well. (4) Simple models predict the actual
criterion (graduate school success) well.
There are at least three reasons why simple
models predict surprisingly well. One is that people
have difﬁculty introspecting into their DEMO decision
making.11,12 A second is that people have difﬁculty
executing complex strategies reliably, so that only
simple patterns appear consistently. The third is
that simple linear models can predict well without
capturing the underlying processes,DEMO,13 as long as they
use reliably measured correlates of the variables that
actually affect decision making.
This good news for predictive research is DEMO
news for explanatory research. Models using different
variables, implying different processes, often predict
equally well. As a result, regression weights need not
capture how decisions are made. In many applications,
good prediction sufﬁces. For DEMO, the health
belief model14,15 provides a structured way to identify
DEMO correlated with health-related choices. Its
application would, however, be misguided, DEMO the
weights on those variables were taken as reﬂecting
how individuals think.16
For analogous reasons, behavioral decision
researchers typically avoid the revealed preference
analyses that are a staple of economics research.17,18
For goods traded in DEMO markets, prices show
rational decision makers’ values. If goods are char-
DEMO on common attributes, regression weights

show those attributes’ usefulness as predictors. For
example, house prices might be predicted from their
size, condition, age, school district, DEMO dis-
tance, construction, and so on. Unfortunately, when
predictors are DEMO, regression weights can be
unstable, complicating their interpretation as mea-
sures of importance.
One strategy for undoing these confounds is gen-
erating stimuli DEMO uncorrelated cues. For example,
one might create hypothetical graduate school candi-
dates, using all possible combinations of GRE, GPA,
and QI. DEMO drawback to this ANOVA design is vio-
lating behavioral decision research’s commitment to
probabilistic functionalism,4,19 the view that behavior
is shaped by DEMO occurring correlations among
uncertain cues. Stimuli that violate these relation-
ships lack ecological validity and require unnatural
behavior, such as evaluations of implausible cue com-
binations (e.g., low GRE, high QI). An ANOVA
design also gives equal weight to all cue combina-
tions, however common or possible. Moreover, as
with any design that presents many stimuli with a
transparent cue structure, respondents may either lose
focus (producing unreliable judgments) or improvise a
mechanical response strategy (producing reliable, but
unnatural judgments)DEMO
How people respond to novel tasks (e.g.,
grad candidates with DEMO GRE and high QI)
can be revealing. However, because importance
DEMO inherently context dependent, artiﬁcial contexts
produce artiﬁcial importance weights. For example,DEMO
although money is generally relevant to consumer
decision making, other factors DEMO dominate choices
among similarly priced options. One possible reason
why Eq. (DEMO) did not include the variable ‘strength
of letters of recommendation’ is DEMO candidates had
similarly strong letters, written by faculty advisors
who sell DEMO students similarly. (QI should capture
the reputations of those letter writers.)DEMO
As it discovered these limits to the explanatory
value of predictive models, behavioral decision
research shifted its focus from what choices people
make to how they make them. As a result, studies
describe decision-making processes that can come into
play, as revealed by tasks with which it is relatively
clear how a process would express itself. Applied
researchers must then DEMO which of the possible
processes are evoked by a speciﬁc decision.
SUBJECTIVE EXPECTED UTILITY
The normative analysis underlying behavioral decision
research is founded on DEMO utility theory, classi-
cally codiﬁed by von Neumann and Morgenstern.20 Its
DEMO/cogsci
basic logic is straightforward: List the possible action
options. For DEMO option, enumerate its possible out-
comes. For each such outcome, assess the value, or
utility, of it happening. Assess the probability of DEMO
occurrence should each option be selected. Compute
the expected utility of each option by multiplying the
utility and probability of each outcome, should it be
undertaken, then summing across outcomes. Choose
the action with the greatest expected utility. When the
probabilities reﬂect decision makers’ beliefs, rather
than scientiﬁc knowledge, the calculation produces
subjective expected utility.21 (As discussed below,
DEMO scholars view all probabilities as subjective.)
Descriptive research can look at how people
undertake each element of this process: assessing
the probabilities of possible outcomes, evaluating
their utility (should they occur), and combining
DEMO and utilities to identify the best option.
The decisions can range from completely described
and static to incompletely described and dynamic.
Normative analyses exist DEMO many kinds of decision.22
Individuals’ performance on these tasks can
be evaluated by correspondence or coherence tests.
Correspondence tests ask how accurate their answers
DEMO For example, how well can they predict whether
they will graduate DEMO or enjoy their major?
Coherence tests ask how consistent responses are.
For example, are probability judgments for event at
least as large as those for subset (p[A] ≥ p[A∩B])? Are
outcomes equally valued, DEMO described in formally
equivalent ways (e.g., succeeding vs. not failing).
PREDICTING OUTCOMES
Studies of how well people predict uncertain events
have produced DEMO contradictory results. Some-
times, people do quite well; sometimes, quite DEMO
To a ﬁrst approximation, the difference depends on
whether the task DEMO counting or inferences. With
counting studies, the evidence is all of DEMO type;
with inference studies, the evidence is of different
types. DEMO counting study might display stimuli drawn
randomly from a hidden population, DEMO elicit esti-
mates of a summary statistic (e.g., mean, range)DEMO
An inference study might require integrating base-rate
evidence about what usually happens, with individual
information about a speciﬁc case.
Counting tasks take advantage of individuals’
ability to estimate the relative frequency of events that
they observe—even DEMO preparing to do so. For
example, after producing rhymes for a DEMO of words,
people can estimate the number beginning with dif-
ferent letters.24 Indeed, encoding frequencies has been
called an automatic cognitive function, DEMO research

DEMO that individuals trust their frequency-
encoding ability, Tversky and Kahneman26 proposed
DEMO availability heuristic, whereby individuals estimate
an event’s probability by their ability DEMO retrieve
instances (tokens) or imagine them (types). Reliance
on DEMO produces biased judgments when the
observed events are an unrepresentative sample—and
individuals cannot correct for the sampling bias.
Researchers have identiﬁed many other possible
DEMO, arising from reliance on judgmental heuristics.
The strength of any claim DEMO bias depends on the
strength of the normative analysis.27,28 The usefulness
of any heuristic depends on how well its application
can be predicted (e.g., how memory is searched for
examples).
Inference studies tap individuals’ lack of intu-
ition and training for combining different kinds of
evidence. DEMO, the normative standard has been the
Bayesian approach to hypothesis evaluation.5,DEMO Bayes
theorem is an uncontroversial part of probability the-
ory. Bayesian inference is more controversial, because
it treats probabilities as subjective, thereby allowing
DEMO that combine diverse kinds of evidence.30
Frequentistic probabilities require evidence of a sin-
gle kind (e.g., coin ﬂips, weather records). Subjective
judgments are only probabilities if they pass coherence
tests. Thus, probabilities are not just any assertion of
belief.
A widely studied inferential bias is the DEMO
fallacy’. Attributed to reliance on the representative-
ness heuristic,26 it involves allowing even weak infor-
mation about speciﬁc cases to outweigh knowledge of
DEMO generally happens (the base rate). Inadequately
regressing judgments is the DEMO bias with continuous
variables. Absent strong information about speciﬁc
cases, one DEMO predict the mean of a distribution.
To avoid artifactual sources of bias,31 behavioral
decision research draws on the century-plus of psy-
chophysics research DEMO factors affecting quantitative
judgments.32–34 For example, because people avoid
decimals, they are more likely to overestimate small
risks in studies eliciting percentages (e.g., 0.1%) than
in studies eliciting odds (e.g., 1 in 1000)DEMO Knowing
that, researchers can choose the method best suited to
their DEMO and reduce measurement artifacts.
Figure 1 depicts six such design features, DEMO
to eliciting numbers. For example, Figure 1A shows
that stimuli [S1,DEMO ] elicit less of the response range
when embedded in a larger range [L1,L2 ]. Figure 1C
shows how values assigned to larger DEMO are
cramped if the initial (standard) stimulus is large,
relative to others in the set. Such effects occur
because respondents must translate DEMO perceptions
into the investigators’ terms. Where those terms are
unnatural, respondents DEMO on response preferences.35
For example, they try to use the entire DEMO scale;
they look for patterns in randomly ordered stimuli;
they deduce an expected level of precision, such as
what trade-off to make between speed and accuracy.
Ignoring response preferences leads to misinter-
preting judgments. DEMO example, subjects produced
much higher estimates of annual US death toll,DEMO
from 41 causes, when they received a high anchor
(50,000 motor vehicles deaths), rather than a low
anchor (1000 accidental electrocutions). Low frequen-
cies were greatly overestimated with the high anchor,

much less so with the low one. Estimates of relative DEMO
quency were similar, however the question was asked,
suggesting robust DEMO perceptions, whose translation
into numerical judgments was method dependent. The
estimates DEMO also biased in ways consistent with rely-
ing on the availability heuristic (e.g., homicides were
overestimated relative to, less reported, suicides).36
DEMO VALUES
There are two streams of research into how people
form preferences.17 One follows psychophysics,
treating the intensity of preferences like the intensity DEMO
physical experiences. The second follows the precepts
of decision analysis, a DEMO process designed to
help individuals follow decision theory’s normative
model.21,22
Research in the psychophysical stream has
individuals report their feelings directly, perhaps with
a rating scale or a judgment of willingness-to-pay
for a good. Attitude DEMO is the archetype of this
paradigm.
The correspondence test for psychophysical
research asks how well elicited values predict
behavior. Some attitude researchers hold that DEMO fair
test must elicit attitudes that are directly comparable
to the target behavior.37 For example, many behaviors
could follow endorsement of ‘my faith is very
important to me’. Stronger predictions follow from
‘daily prayer with like-minded DEMO is very
important to me’. Even stronger predictions follow
from specifying the form of worship. At the extreme,
these judgments become statements of DEMO,
rather than attitudes, representing general values. As
such, their validity depends on how well people can
predict their own experiences.38
The coherence DEMO for psychophysical
judgments is construct validity. Expressed values
should be sensitive to relevant changes in questions
and insensitive to irrelevant ones. Applying this
standard DEMO independently assessing relevance.
For example, assuming that more is better, scope
tests ask whether people put higher values on
larger quantities of a DEMO Scope insensitive
judgments represent incoherent preferences—except
for individuals who feel that there can be too much of a
good thing (e.g., rich food, conspicuous consumption).
An ‘inside view’ on individuals’ basic values is needed
DEMO evaluate the coherence of their preferences.
Research in the decision analysis stream assumes
that people cannot know what they want, in all
possible situations. Rather, they must construct
speciﬁc preferences from more basic values. In making
these inferences, people may seek cues in a world that
wires.wiley.com/cogsci
might be helpful, indifferent, or manipulative. The
better people understand the DEMO shaping their
inferences, the better chance they have of ﬁguring out
DEMO they want.39,40 Decision analysis structures that
process. Its measurement is reactive, in the sense of
changing people in the process of trying to help them
discover their preferences. If successful, it deepens
individuals’ understanding of themselves.
Correspondence tests for constructed prefer-
ences compare elicited values with those DEMO emerge
from similar real-world processes. Thus, an intensive
electoral campaign might DEMO the standard for a study
eliciting candidate preferences.41,42 Intensive medical
consultation might be the standard for preferences
elicited with a medical decision aid.43,DEMO Coherence
tests for constructed preferences ask whether the
elicitation session has included all perspectives that
individuals might want to consider, while avoiding
ones that would apply irrelevant inﬂuences.
Identifying the factors inﬂuencing behavior is,
of DEMO, psychology’s central challenge. To study
theoretically relevant factors, researchers must control
irrelevant ones. Understanding these processes is
an ongoing enterprise, which McGuire 45 depicted
as turning ‘artifacts into main effects’, worthy of
independent investigation. Table 1 assembles parts
of this history, in terms of the four essential
elements of any behavior: the organism, the stimulus
being evaluated, the response mode for expressing
preferences, and potentially distracting contexts.46 In
terms of correspondence tests, these are all factors that
could undermine the match between the conditions
in which values are measured by researchers and
expressed in DEMO In terms of coherence tests, these
are all factors whose effects DEMO expressed values
could be compared with independent assessments
of their relevance. That is, do changes in these
factors affect valuations when, and only DEMO, they
should make a difference? Given the sheer number of
potentially relevant factors, value elicitation requires
broad understanding of behavioral science.
MAKING DECISIONS
Non-normative Theories
Knowing the limits to the theoretical insights possible
with predictive DEMO, applied in complex settings,
behavioral decision researchers have focused on
DEMO observed most clearly under experimental
conditions. The robustness of observations in the lab
is tested by varying those conditions (e.g., increasing
economic incentives DEMO good performance, changing
information displays) and by identifying real-world

Foremost among these models is Kahneman DEMO
Tversky’s47 prospect theory. Its initial formulation
identiﬁed several utility theory assumptions that
were implausible psychologically. One is that people
evaluate expected outcomes in terms DEMO changes in
their net asset position, namely, everything they have
in the world. However, people are actually highly
sensitive to changes and tend to forget the big
picture—as witnessed in reminders to ‘count your
blessings’.48 DEMO second psychologically implausible
assumption is that numerically equivalent changes
in probabilities are equally important. However,
the psychophysics of probability weighting places a
premium DEMO changes that lead to certain outcomes
(e.g., from 90% to 100%) compared to mid-range
changes (e.g., from 30% to 40%). A third such
assumption is that people get increasingly averse
as losses mount DEMO, whereas psychology ﬁnds them
increasingly apathetic.
One widely studied corollary of DEMO principles
is the status quo bias. It reﬂects how easily reference
points can be shifted, varying how changes are viewed.
For example, organ DEMO rates are much higher
when drivers must opt out, when getting DEMO drivers
licenses, compared to when they must opt in.49,50
Opting DEMO makes surrendering organs seem like a loss,
hence aversive. That formulation also suggests a social
norm of organ donation and perhaps even a DEMO
right to refusal.

Any behaviorally realistic approach to decision
making must accommodate the DEMO to cognitive
computational capacity. Prospect theory accepts
utility theory’s cognitively implausible calculation of
expected values. However, it uses more intuitively
plausible elements and, DEMO a linear model, is relatively
robust to misestimating its parameters. Applying
DEMO theory requires identifying its elements with
real-world equivalents, such as the DEMO points
that decision makers use when assessing changes.51
Fuzzy-trace theory52 studies the processes by which
individuals master the gist of recurrent decisions.
Approaches building DEMO the classic work of Herbert
Simon53 have examined individuals’ ability to match
simple decision-making heuristics to choices that
would, otherwise, be unduly complex.54 DEMO
theory,55 support theory,56 and others 57 formalize
the notion of weighting retrieved beliefs, embodied in
the availability heuristic.
Emotions
Normative analyses can accommodate emotions as
valued outcomes, such as the utility of being happy
or the disutility of being fearful. For example, there
are formal methods for incorporating such ‘psycho-
logical’ outcomes, in analyses of risk decisions.17,31
Descriptive research can accommodate emotions in
terms of their effects on each DEMO of decision
making (deﬁning options, predicting events, assess-
ing personal DEMO, integrating beliefs and values).
For example, cognitive appraisal theory58 predicts
that anger increases the perceived probability of
overcoming problems. In a ﬁeld DEMO with a nation-
ally representative US sample, Lerner et al.59 found
DEMO respondents were about 5% more optimistic,
regarding their vulnerability to terror-related events,
after an anger induction than after a fear induction.
Prescriptive DEMO can accommodate emotions by
helping people to getting the right mix for particu-
lar choices.60,61 For example, formal analyses might
be used cautiously when they ‘anaesthetize’ moral
feeling;62 decision aids for adolescents have focused
DEMO controlling emotions.63
The importance of emotion effects depends on
their size. A 6% shift might tip a close decision,
but not a clear-cut DEMO von Winterfeldt and
Edwards21 showed, mathematically, that decisions
with continuous options (e.g., invest $X) are
often insensitive to changes in input variables (i.e.,
probabilities, values). Thorngate 64 used simulations
to examine DEMO sensitivity of stylized decisions to errors
due to imperfect heuristics, an DEMO that others
have pursued extensively.65,66

Decision-making Competence (DMC)DEMO
The fundamental premise of experimental decision
research is that people who master the skills
that it studies make better real-world decisions.67
Table 2 presents DEMO from a study evaluating
the external validity of seven experimental tasks,
chosen to span the space of cognitive decision-making
competencies.68 Respondents were 110 DEMO to 19-
year-old males in a longitudinal study involving
extensive assessments beginning at age 10. DMC
scores, extracted from a factor analysis of performance
on the seven tasks, showed good test–retest reliability,
as did scores on an adult version.69
The ﬁrst section shows positive correlations
between DMC DEMO standard measures of verbal and
ﬂuid intelligence (Vocabulary and ECF, respectively).
The second section shows positive correlations
between DMC and four ‘constructive’ DEMO
styles. The third section shows negative correlations
between DMC and several important risk behaviors.
The fourth section shows that DMC is higher
for teens DEMO from low-risk (LAR) families,
higher socioeconomic status (SES) families, and
more positive peer environments. (The negative
correlation with social support DEMO reﬂect low DMC
teens’ greater gang membership.) Most correlations
remained statistically DEMO after partialing out
the two intelligence measures.
These results support the construct validity of
DMC as a measure of decision-making skills that
both cause DEMO reﬂect important aspects of teens’
lives. For example, teens with higher DEMO come
from families that might both model and reward
good decision making. Bruine de Bruin et al.69 found
similar correlations between adult DMC and DEMO
on a psychometrically validated Decision Outcome
Inventory, eliciting self-reports of outcomes DEMO
poor decisions, varying in severity (threw out food,
bought clothes that were never worn, missed a train or
bus, had a DEMO foreclosed, had a driver’s license
revoked, had an unplanned pregnancy) DEMO inversely
weighted by their frequency.
PREJUDICES ABOUT BIASES—AND
THE RHETORIC OF COMPETENCE
Over the past 40 years, the study of judgment
and decision making has spread widely, ﬁrst to
social psychology,70 then to application areas like
accounting, health, and ﬁnance, ﬁnally penetrating
mainstream economics under the banner of behavioral
economics. That success owes something to the power
of DEMO approach, which liberated researchers previ-
ously bound by rational-actor models for DEMO

results that address a central aspect of the human DEMO
dition, individuals’ competence to manage their own
affairs.50,66,67 Very DEMO social institutions may
suit rational actors (e.g., free markets, civic DEMO
ment) and irrational ones (e.g., strong regulatory
protection, deference to paternalistic experts).
Those seeking to extract general messages from
this complex DEMO literature have adopted several
archetypal rhetorical stances. Familiarity with these
stances can help in seeing the research through the
stances. Table 3 summarizes several DEMO themes,
formulated in terms of their advocates’ interpretation
of the demonstrations of bias that tend to dominate
the ﬁeld.
Examining research for possible DEMO is central to
any science. However, as seen in Table 1, the set
of features that might conceivably change a research
result is DEMO large, allowing endless criticisms by those
who dislike a result (‘the bias would disappear had
you just changed...’). Such radical skepticism may
DEMO met by radical counter-skepticism (‘you can’t test
for every conceivable confound’)DEMO A compromise asks
whether confounds have general effects. The ‘unfair
tasks’ section of Table 3 lists common methodological
criticisms (e.g., biases would vanish DEMO higher stakes
or clearer instructions). An early review of all studies
studying these factors found no effect on hindsight
bias or on overconﬁdence DEMO beliefs. A more recent
review found that ﬁnancial incentives had mixed

It Is True, But You Should Not Say So
Demonstrations of bias allow researchers, who claim
to know the answers, to fault DEMO, who do not.
Charging others with incompetence undermines their
right to DEMO decisions. As a result, researchers
should avoid sweeping statements about human
DEMO stick to the details of domain-
speciﬁc studies. They should convey both the ‘ﬁgure’
of biases and the ‘background’ of the heuristics
producing them. DEMO should recall that optical
illusions reveal important properties of vision without
hindering most activities.21 They should resist those

who promote their DEMO because it serves their
political ends.
People Are Doing Something Quite
Different—And Doing It Quite Well
Describing decisions as suboptimal presumes a norma-
tive DEMO, informed by knowledge of what people
know and want. Without that DEMO, evaluations
can be unduly harsh (e.g., charging overconﬁdence
when people DEMO strategically overstated their beliefs)
or lenient (e.g., excusing mistakes as attempts to learn
by trial and error). Table 3’s ‘misunderstood tasks’
DEMO lists some ways that actors and observers can
interpret decisions differently. In experiments, manip-
ulation checks can assess whether subjects understand
tasks as intended. In the world, observers are typically
left guessing. For example, there DEMO an unresolved con-
troversy over whether some Americans increased their
travel risk, by driving rather than ﬂying, right after
the 9/11 attacks. DEMO, the interpretation of their
decisions requires knowing how they saw the DEMO,
risks, and hassles of ﬂying and driving. Without evi-
dence DEMO these beliefs, any evaluation of their choices
is speculative.
But Look DEMO How Well People Do Other
Things
Claims of bias seem strikingly at odds with the
complex tasks that people routinely accomplish
(including driving and ﬂying). Perhaps, the biases are
just laboratory curiosities, theoretically informative,DEMO
but of limited practical importance. Or, perhaps
the research denies people DEMO that life typically
affords them. Table 3’s ‘restructuring tasks’ section
lists manipulations that have improved performance
under lab conditions. For example, when prompted,
people can generate reasons why they might be wrong
(reducing overconﬁdence), ways that events might
have turned out otherwise (reducing hindsight bias),DEMO
or estimates of what normally happens (reducing base-
rate neglect). DEMO life provides similar cues, then these
‘debiasing’ studies are most relevant DEMO extrapolation
to actual behavior.
Facing the Problems
Arguably, by mid-adolescence, most people have the
cognitive ability to acquire most of the skills needed
DEMO make better decisions.52,67,69,72 Whether they do
depends on the help that they get. Unfortunately,
people often receive little training, feedback, and
help in making decisions. Indeed, they often face
marketers, politicians, and others trying to manipulate

their choices.44,73 Table 3’s ‘perfectible individuals’
section lists DEMO that seem able to enhance indi-
viduals’ decision-making abilities—recognizing that
their success, in any speciﬁc setting, is an empiri-
cal question.74,75 The DEMO individuals’ section
lists ways to live with fallibility. A historical exam-
ple of recalibration was doubling engineers’ chronic
underestimates of the repair time for DEMO plants.76
A currently popular compromise is ‘nudging’ people
toward better decisions, DEMO choosing better default
choices (e.g., being an organ donor, contributing DEMO
pension plans).50
CONCLUSIONS
Judgment and decision making research both requires
and allows an unusual degree of collaboration among
scientists with diverse expertise. The DEMO discipline of
behavioral decision research entails familiarity with
normative analyses, descriptive DEMO, and prescrip-
tive interventions. Its execution involves input from
experts in DEMO subject matter of speciﬁc decisions, the
other (social and affective) DEMO on them, and
the opportunities for change.52 For example, Downs
Judgment and decision making
et al.61 helped young women make better sex-related
decisions, with an interactive DVD whose content
reﬂected medical research (about sexually transmit-
ted infections), behavioral decision research (about
risk perceptions), and social psychology (about self-
efﬁcacy).
Behavioral decision research also provides a
research platform where theoretical and practical
research is mutually reinforcing. In the study DEMO clini-
cal judgment, such interactions showed the predictive
power of simple DEMO, a result that was invisible to
researchers immersed in domain-speciﬁc research. DEMO
the study of judgment under uncertainty, these inter-
actions revealed suboptimal DEMO that survive
because they are good enough to avoid major prob-
lems. In the study of value elicitation, they revealed the
constructive nature of preference formation, as indi-
viduals infer what they want in the novel situations
created by life and researchers. In the study of choice,
DEMO revealed the positive and negative interplay of
cognition and affect. The ﬁeld’s future may exemplify
Allan Baddeley’s77 call for the integrated pursuit of
applied DEMO research, testing theory by its applica-
tion, and basic applied research, creating theory from
new phenomena observed through those tests.
