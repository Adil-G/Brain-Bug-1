Abstract Previous game theoretical analyses DEMO vaccinating behaviour have under-
scored the strategic interaction between individuals attempting to maximise their
health states, in situations where an individual’s health state depends upon the
vaccination decisions of others due to the presence of herd DEMO Here, we
extend such analyses by applying the theories of variational DEMO (VI) and
projected dynamical systems (PDS) to vaccination games. A PDS provides a dy-
namics that gives the conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability properties
of Nash equilibria. In this paper, it is used to analyse the dynamics of vaccinating
behaviour in a population consisting of DEMO social groups, where each group
has different perceptions of vaccine and DEMO risks. In particular, we study pop-
ulations with two groups, where the size of one group is strictly larger than the
size of DEMO other group (a majority/minority population). We ﬁnd that a DEMO
tion with a vaccine-inclined majority group and a vaccine-averse minority group
exhibits higher average vaccine coverage than the corresponding homogeneous
population, when the vaccine is perceived as being risky relative to the disease.
Our model also DEMO a feature of real populations: In certain parameter
regimes, it is possible to have a majority group adopting high vaccination rates and
simultaneously DEMO vaccine-averse minority group adopting low vaccination rates.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that DEMO groups will tend to exhibit more extreme changes
in vaccinating behaviour for a given change in risk perception, in comparison to
majority groups. These results emphasise the important role played by social het-
erogeneity in vaccination DEMO, while also highlighting the valuable role that
can be played by DEMO and VI in mathematical epidemiology.

1. Introduction
Population biology is an inherent part of voluntary vaccination policies. It has been
shown that whether DEMO not an individual decides to vaccinate depends partly upon
the perceived probability of their becoming infected, which, in turn, depends upon
the level of disease prevalence (Goldstein et al., 1996; Chapman and Coups, DEMO;
Bauch, 2005). Disease prevalence is, in turn, a DEMO of the vaccine coverage
in the population (Anderson and May, 1991), which is the collective result of the
vaccination decisions of other DEMO, if vaccination is voluntary. Hence, the
individuals in a given population are effectively engaged in a strategic interaction
(a ‘game’) with one DEMO, mediated by transmission dynamics.
Vaccine scares are not uncommon and have DEMO for various vaccines, in-
cluding those for polio, smallpox, pertussis, measles–mumps–rubella, and Hepati-
tis B (Gangarosa et al., 1998; Durbach, 2000; Albert et al., 2001; Poland and Jacob-
sen, 2001; Plotkin, 2002; Biroscak et al., 2003; Jansen et al., 2003). At high levels
of vaccine coverage, there is a reduced individual incentive to vaccinate, since un-
vaccinated individuals are already protected through herd immunity. If concerns
about the potential health risks of vaccination then develop, high vaccine coverage
levels may be prone to destabilise, and vaccine coverage can drop precipitously.
Several mathematical modelling studies have incorporated the effects of DEMO
behaviour under a voluntary policy, either explicitly or implicitly, using game theo-
retical or other techniques (Fine and Clarkson, 1986; Geoffard and Philipson, 1997;
Bauch et al., 2003; Bauch and Earn, DEMO; Bauch, 2005). However, epidemiological
studies, which are usually concerned with individual risk factors or particular fo-
cus populations, do not account for this population biological context (Asch et al.,
1994; Roberts DEMO al., 1995; Lashuay et al., 2000; Evans et al., DEMO; Schmitt, 2002;
Smailbegovic et al., 2002; Bellaby, 2003)DEMO It is increasingly recognised that incor-
poration of human behaviour into epidemic models is an important, if challenging,
goal (Fischhoff, 2003; DEMO and Roberts, 2003). The example of strategic in-
teractions under DEMO voluntary vaccination policy is a case in point.
Recent studies explore the application of game theory to vaccinating behaviour
under voluntary policies for childhood DEMO (Bauch and Earn, 2004; Bauch,
2005), such as DEMO, mumps, chickenpox, pertussis and rubella (Anderson
and May, 1991)DEMO In these papers, the authors assume a homogeneous population
where all DEMO share the same perception of risk. However, in real popula-
tions, risk perception can vary signiﬁcantly across distinct social groups (Durbach,
2000; Lashuay et al., 2000). Many countries with high overall vaccine DEMO
have minority social or religious groups that vaccinate rarely or never, DEMO which
are, therefore, prone to outbreaks. Canada and The Netherlands, DEMO instance,
maintain high coverage rates for rubella vaccine but have recently seen rubella
outbreaks in minority religious communities with almost no vaccine coverage
(Eurosurveillance, 2005). Since the actions of even a small group of nonvaccinators
can have a signiﬁcant impact on disease prevalence when vaccine coverage DEMO

are high, it is important to understand the inﬂuence of social heterogeneity on the
dynamics DEMO vaccinating behaviour.
In previous vaccine game studies, individuals implicitly understand the DEMO
of a critical coverage level provided by herd immunity, such that DEMO disease can
be eradicated without vaccinating everyone. This has been shown to result in a
“Prisoner’s Dilemma,” whereby high coverage levels are unstable DEMO to non-
vaccinating behaviour (Bauch et al., 2003; Bauch, 2005). By comparison, in the
present study, we assume that individuals DEMO not perceive a critical coverage level.
Rather, they perceive a possibility DEMO being infected even when vaccine coverage
is very high. In such a situation, we wish to determine whether non-vaccinating be-
haviour can still occur in some groups while other groups maintain high coverage
levels.
Here we DEMO the dynamics of vaccinating behaviour in a population divided
into k social groups, each having a different perceived risk of infection and vac-
cination, and where vaccination is purely voluntary. We assume an infectious dis-
ease for which vaccination can take place only shortly after birth, where parents
decide on a voluntary basis to vaccinate their children, and in which individu-
als (children) can be either susceptible, infectious or recovered (DEMO). These
are known as Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) models, and have DEMO
well-validated and widely applied in infectious disease epidemiology (Anderson
and May, 1991).
The mathematical approach used here for deriving the dynamics is DEMO of pro-
jected dynamical systems (PDS), via variational inequalities (VI). This approach is
widely used in operations research, economic theory, DEMO and network analysis
and mathematical physics (see, for example Dupuis and Nagurney, 1993; Nagurney
and Zhang, 1996; Nagurney and Siokos, 1997; Isac and Cojocaru, 2002; Cojocaru,
2005; Cojocaru et al., 2005, the references therein).
A PDS is a dynamical system whose ﬂow is constrained to evolve on a closed
and convex subset, generically denoted by K, of the ambient space. In this pa-
per, DEMO consider the ambient space to be the Euclidean space Rk and we consider
the constraint set K to be a k-dimensional cube in Rk. DEMO general, a PDS is pro-
duced by projecting the velocity ﬁeld DEMO an ordinary differential equation onto the
boundary of the constraint set K whenever the velocity is not pointing inside the
tangent cone to K. DEMO, a PDS essentially solves a control problem, namely that
of keeping all trajectories of the projected velocity within the set K (in the interior
as well as on its boundary). A PDS could be DEMO a topological dynamical
system, since its ﬂow is continuous, but there is little resemblance to the classical
dynamical systems theory since a projected DEMO has a nonlinear, discontinuous
velocity. The results present in the PDS DEMO (both on Euclidean space and
on more general Hilbert spaces) are based on nonlinear and convex analysis and
differential inclusions (see, for DEMO Henry, 1973; Aubin and Cellina, 1984; Isac
and Cojocaru, DEMO; Cojocaru and Jonker, 2004; Cojocaru, 2006).
The ability to use a projected dynamics means that we are able to handle
boundary DEMO (like boundary critical points, their stability, etc.), along-
side DEMO ones, with ease. This is especially useful for modelling vaccinating be-
DEMO in a socially heterogeneous population, since small minority groups adopt-
ing DEMO nonvaccinator behaviour (zero vaccine uptake) correspond to boundary

equilibria. The PDS theory contains existence, uniqueness and local and global
stability results for equilibria and periodic solutions of constrained DEMO, no
matter where they occur in K. In short, a projected dynamics is very useful for
studying the time evolution of constrained phenomena.
DEMO exists an intimate relation between PDS and variational inequality (VI)
DEMO In general, a VI problem is a unifying mathematical tool used DEMO re-
formulate equilibrium problems from diverse ﬁelds in a mathematically consistent
and solvable way (see, for example Minty, 1978; Kinderlehrer and Stampacchia,DEMO
1980; Baiocchi and Capello, 1984; Isac, 1992, and Isac DEMO al., 2002). Initially, VI
problems were introduced (in 1963–1964) in order to help solving boundary value
problems; later they were shown to represent mathematical formulations of cer-
tain classes of equilibrium problems in DEMO mathematics (elastic problems in
mechanics, differential optimization problems, Nash games), economics (spatial
price equilibrium and ﬁnancial equilibrium problems), operations research DEMO en-
gineering (human migration, transportation and electrical networks problems).
In this paper, we use the ﬁnite-dimensional theories of VI and PDS because
of the intrinsic relation between certain Nash games and variational inequalities.
In DEMO, the solutions to a VI problem are exactly those of the DEMO game
and vice versa. Moreover, to each VI problem, one can associate a PDS. The two
extremely useful characteristics of such an association DEMO: the critical points of the
PDS are the same as the DEMO to the associated VI, hence, they coincide with
the solutions of the Nash game; the ﬂow of the PDS remains in the constraint set
of interest at all times, thus enabling an accurate description of how the system
(in our case, the vaccination strategies of various DEMO within the population)
reaches a steady state. All these are exposed in detail in Section 3.
By using the PDS approach, we thus gain greater analytic capabilities, such as
the ability to visualise the structure of the game dynamics through theoretical anal-
ysis, and to compute the optimal strategy and the respective equilibrium vaccina-
tion coverage. We are also DEMO to show robust stability properties of our optimal
strategy under perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst application of VI
and PDS theories in mathematical epidemiology.
Our goals in this paper are twofold. First, we wish to use vaccination games
to explore the impact of social heterogeneity DEMO vaccinating behaviour. Second,
we wish to illustrate the usefulness of VI and PDS techniques for problems in
epidemic modelling. In Section 2, we describe the vaccination game. In Section 3,
we give a brief DEMO to the theories of PDS and VI and their relation to
game theory, and we list the mathematical results that are used here. In Section 4,
we analyse the dynamics of vaccination strategies, show that equilibria (optimal
strategies) exist and are unique and discuss the structure DEMO this dynamics under
perturbations. In Section 5, we compute such equilibria DEMO a general setting. In
Section 6, we present numerical results, while Section 7 discusses these results.
2. The vaccination game
In this section, we present in brief the vaccination game, using similar notations as
in previous publications (Bauch and Earn, 2004). We consider a population DEMO
sisting of various social groups, where each group may have a DEMO perception
Dynamics of Vaccination Strategies via Projected Dynamical Systems 1457
of risks and, therefore, may adopt different strategies. We consider a disease for
which there is lifelong natural immunity, and in which individuals are typically
infected early in life in the absence of vaccination (this describes the so-called pae-
diatric infectious diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and DEMO
pox) (Anderson and May, 1991). Likewise, we consider a vaccine that is adminis-
tered primarily in the youngest age classes, and in which vaccination coverage is
typically low later in life.
As discussed DEMO the Introduction, the decision to vaccinate depends partly upon
the perceived DEMO associated with infection and vaccination. The perceived prob-
ability of signiﬁcant morbidity due to vaccination is denoted by rv . The perceived
probability of DEMO infected given that a proportion p of the population is
vaccinated, DEMO denoted by π p and the perceived probability of signiﬁcant morbidity
upon infection is denoted by rinf. The overall perceived probability of experienc-
ing DEMO morbidity because of not vaccinating is thus π prinf . We denote by
r := rv/rinf the relative (perceived) risk of vaccination versus infection. We assume
that all individuals within a group share a DEMO assessment of the risks involved
with vaccination and infection, but different DEMO have different relative risk as-
sessments.
Suppose that the strategy set for all individuals in group i is { P | P ∈ [0, 1 P ]},
where 1 P < 1 but large enough DEMO P is the probability that a child in group
i
i is

vaccinated. We wish to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium strategy P∗ := ( P∗, P∗ ,..., P∗),
such that when DEMO in group i plays P∗, no sufﬁciently small subset of indi-
DEMO
viduals in any group can achieve a higher utility (payoff) by switching to a different

strategy P = P∗.At P∗, there is no incentive to switch strategies, so such strate-

gies should be stable equilibrium solutions of our game. In Sections DEMO and 4, we
derive a dynamics of the vaccination game that DEMO existence and stability

The utility function in a group where the perceived relative risk is r ,and where
the vaccine coverage in the population as a whole is p, is given by
u( P , p) =−rP −π p(1 − P ) subject to P ∈ [0, 1 P ],

after suitable rescaling. The players in a given DEMO of the game are the parents of
a given cohort of children, who play the game only once (they can decide only once
DEMO or not to vaccinate their child). Future rounds of the game are played by
the parents of later cohorts.
In order to ﬁnd DEMO mathematical expression for π p, one approach is to use equi-
DEMO solutions of a deterministic SIR compartmental model and assume that
individuals have perfect knowledge of their probability of eventually becoming in-
fected (Bauch and Earn, 2004). However, individuals do not have perfect knowl-
edge DEMO their probability of being infected. One could, for instance, assume that the
perceived probability of eventually becoming infected increases linearly with the
current DEMO of disease in the population (Bauch, 2005). Here, we DEMO
for ease of analysis that π p is a decreasing function of p given by π p = b/(a + p).
This expresses the fact that disease prevalence is implicitly a function of how
DEMO individuals have been vaccinated, and that greater perceived coverage in the
DEMO means a reduced perceived infection risk for susceptible individuals.
1458
Cojocaru et al.
Individuals also do not perceive a critical coverage DEMO beyond which the dis-
ease is eradicated, as discussed in the DEMO Unfortunately, because appro-
priate data are generally lacking on perceived risks DEMO vaccination and infection,
the validity of this function cannot be tested. However, we use values of a and b
that are guided by epidemiologic constraints to ensure plausible results (discussed
in Section 6).
Other expressions for π p can be considered; we address this point in detail in
Remark 4.2 of Section 4 later. We also note that DEMO lags may be relevant
here, since transmission dynamics can take several DEMO to respond to changes
in vaccine coverage. However, for highly transmissible DEMO diseases such as
measles and pertussis, we assume the effect of DEMO lag to be small, since most vac-
cination and disease transmission DEMO in the youngest age classes.
3. Game theory, variational inequalities and DEMO dynamical systems
3.1. Games and VI
In this section, we show DEMO a Nash game setting is readily applicable to our study
of vaccination behaviour in heterogeneous populations. Historically, the ﬁrst to
study noncooperative behaviour was Cournot in 1838 (Cournot, 1838). Nash for-
malised and generalised DEMO ideas in Nash (1950, 1951). Here, we reformulate
a DEMO game as a variational inequality problem, using the setting in Nagurney
DEMO Siokos (1997). To this VI, we associate a projected dynamical system whose
(mathematical) equilibria are exactly the solutions of the Nash DEMO There are
important consequences for introducing this new way of thinking for the mathe-
matical modelling of the vaccination strategies game, as outlined in the Introduc-
tion. The most important is that we are now in DEMO of a dynamics that gives
the conditions for existence, uniqueness and DEMO properties of equilibria for a
game between population groups with heterogeneous risk perceptions.
In this paper, we limit ourselves to the use of VI and PDS theories on the Eu-
clidean space Rk. By a convex DEMO K ⊂ Rk, we understand a set with the prop-
erty DEMO for anyis closed if any sequence with elements fromx, y ∈ DEMO and any λ ∈ [0, 1], the pointK has a limit inλx + (1K−. Finally, a mappingλ)y ∈ K;the set DEMO
f : K →Rk is called convex if, for any x, y ∈ K and any λ ∈ [0, 1], we have
DEMO (λx + (1 −λ)y) ≤ λ f (x) DEMO (1 −λ) f (y).

Dynamics of Vaccination Strategies via Projected Dynamical Systems 1459
As discussed in DEMO previous section, it has been shown that Nash equilibria
satisfy a DEMO whenever F is a gradient map (Gabay and Moulin, 1980). In general,
we consider a Nash game with m players, each player i having at his/her disposal a
strategy vector xi ={xi DEMO ,..., xin} selected from a closed, convex set Ki ⊂ DEMO, withmn
a utility (or pay-off) function ui : K →R,DEMO K = K1 × K2 × ··· × Km ⊂ R .
The rationality postulate is that each player i selects a strategy vector DEMO ∈ Ki that
maximises his/her utility level ui (x1 ,..., xi −1 , xi , xi +1 ,..., xm) given DEMO decisions
(x j ) j =i of the other players. In DEMO framework one then has:
A Nash equilibrium is a strategy vector x∗ =

This model is DEMO, for example, in market analysis (Nagurney and Siokos, 1997)
where m represents the number of investors and n the number of DEMO instru-
ments. A game of this form can be formulated as a VI as follows (for a proof, see
Gabay and Moulin (1980)).

3.2. PDS DEMO VI
In general, the theories of PDS and VI are developed DEMO more general spaces
(Hilbert, Banach). Hence, the results cited DEMO this subsection are, in fact, formu-
lated on these spaces. However, since we only need to consider the Euclidean
space, we present DEMO in this context.
Let K ⊂ Rk be a non-empty, closed, convex subset. We assume the reader is
familiar with the concepts of DEMO cone to K at x ∈ K, TK (x), and normal cone to
K, NK (kx) at x ∈ K, DEMO, respectively, by TK (x) = ∪h>0 (K − DEMO)/ h,and NK (x) =

K, denoted by PK : Rk → K is given by z → PK (z), where PK (z)satisﬁes
|| DEMO (z) − z|| = inf ||x − z||.

The operator PK is perhaps better known as the closest element mapping, meaning
for each z ∈ Rk, PK (z)isthe vectorin K which realises DEMO minimum distance
between the vector z and the set K.
1460 Cojocaru et al.
The properties of the projection operator are well-known (see, for instance,
Zarantonello (1971)or Kinderlehrer and Stampacchia (1980)). However PK is not
differentiable in the usual (Frechet) sense; in turn, we can estimate its one-sided
directional derivative, for any x ∈ K and any direction v ∈ Rk, as the limit (for a
proof, see Shapiro (1994), Lemma 4.6):
DEMO (x,v):= lim PK (x + δv) − x ; moreover
δ→0+ δ K (x,v) = PTK (x) (v),

K are given in Dupuis and Ishii (1990)and Isac and Cojocaru (2003). One charac-
terization we are using here is a consequence of Moreau’s Theorem (see Cojocaru
and Jonker, DEMO, for a proof): there exists n ∈ NK (x) DEMO that
v = K (x,v) + n.

DEMO following result gives the existence of PDS.
Theorem 3.2. Let K ⊂ Rk be a non-empty, closed, convex subset. Suppose x0 ∈ K
DEMO assume one of the following conditions hold:
a) F : DEMO →Rk is a Lipschitz continuous vector ﬁeld;
b) K is DEMO convex polyhedral set and F is a vector ﬁeld with linear growth (i.e. there
exists M > 0 so that for all x ∈ K, ||F (x)|| ≤ M(1 +||x||)).
Then, DEMO initial value problem

has a unique absolutely continuous solution on the interval [0, ∞).

(1993) for b)DEMO
Definition 3.3. A projected dynamical system is given by a mapping φ : R+ ×
K → K given by (τ, x) →φx (τ ) which solves the initial value problem (5) with
φx (0) = x ∈ K.
Hence, a PDS is a dynamical system forced to evolve only within the set K (inte-
rior as well as boundary). Another important feature of a PDS like the DEMO given
earlier is the following (for a proof, see Cojocaru and Jonker, 2004):
Theorem 3.3. The critical (or equilibrium) points DEMO (5) coincide with the solutions
to the problem represented by (DEMO) and vice versa.
Dynamics of Vaccination Strategies via Projected Dynamical Systems 1461
We note here DEMO alternate sign convention used in the literature for the vector
ﬁeld F in the VI (2) and the PDS (5). In general, the critical points of the PDS (5)
are deﬁned as DEMO to the equation K (x, −F (x)) = 0. DEMO the case of PDS, as
a consequence of (4), we get the following equivalent deﬁnition:
Definition 3.4. All critical points of DEMO PDS (5) are solutions of the inclusion:
ﬁnd x ∈ K so that − F (x) ∈ NK (x).
4. Dynamics of vaccination strategies
Using the setup in Section 2 and the DEMO outlined in Section 3, we model the
vaccination game as follows. DEMO consider a population with N individuals divided
into k distinct groups. The division is made according to the assumption that all in-
dividuals within DEMO group share the same relative risk perception. However, distinct
groups have DEMO relative risk perceptions. Thus, in the language of Section 3,
DEMO consider a game with k players where each player has a 1-dimensional vacci-
nation strategy vector. We denote by P , i ∈{1, 2,..., k} the vaccination strategy
corresponding to the i -th group and by i N the number of individuals in group i
choosing strategy DEMO . In this context, we have
k
i ∈ (0, DEMO) and =1 i = 1.
Remark 4.1.
1) We remark here that we are not interested in i = 0. For if this DEMO true for some
idistinct groups.∈{1, 2,..., k}, then the DEMO is reduced to a population with k − 1orless
2) We DEMO note that if there exists i with i = 1, then DEMO problem is reduced to
that of a population where all individuals share the same risk assessment. This
reduces to the social homogeneous case considered DEMO previous work (Bauch
and Earn, 2004).
3) We denote DEMO ri the relative risk assessment for the i -th group. We are inter-
ested in the case ri = r j , ∀i, j ∈{1, 2,..., k}, otherwise, the problem reduces
to the DEMO of a population with k − 1 or less distinct groups.
Under these hypotheses, the vaccination coverage level of the entire population

According to Theorem 3.3, the stationary points of PDS (8) should coincide with
the solutions DEMO the Nash game. Moreover, to study the question of stability of
DEMO game solutions under perturbations, we need to introduce
Definition 4.1. A DEMO f : K →Rk is called monotone if
 f ( P) − f (Q), ( P − Q)	≥ 0, for all P, Q ∈ K,
and is called strictly monotone if
 f ( P) − f (Q), ( P − DEMO) > 0, for all P = Q ∈ K.
Monotonicity is a central concept in nonlinear and convex analysis and it has
been DEMO and generalised extensively (Henry, 1973; Minty, 1978; Kinderlehrer
and DEMO, 1980; Aubin and Cellina, 1984; Krasnosleskii and Zabreiko,

(or in any of the cited references), one should note that monotonicity is a DEMO
alization of the usual notion of a monotone real function of one variable. In the
theory of PDS, monotonicity and its extensions, like DEMO monotonicity explained
earlier, play a central role in the sense that DEMO give information about the be-
haviour of perturbed equilibria, as well DEMO about existence of periodic cycles. One
of these results states that a PDS with a strictly monotone ﬁeld F can only have a
unique DEMO and that all solutions are monotonically attracted to this point.
The attraction can happen for solutions starting in a neighbourhood of the equi-
librium, or can extend to all solutions starting anywhere in the set K.
DEMO 4.2. Let x∗ be a critical point of the projected equation (DEMO). Then x∗
is a local strict monotone attractor if there exists a neighbourhood N (x∗) ⊂ K
of x∗, so that for any trajectory x(τ )of(5)startingat x0 ∈ N (x∗), the function
τ →||x(τ ) − x∗|| is decreasing.
Moreover, DEMO is a global strict monotone attractor if the deﬁnition above is sat-
isﬁed for trajectories of (5), starting at any point x0 ∈ K.
We must note at this point that a (strict) monotone DEMO is different than an
attractor in the sense of the classical dynamical systems theory. We are now able
to prove the most important result DEMO this paper.
Theorem 4.1. The Nash game introduced earlier has a unique solution. This solu-
tion is a global strict monotone attractor for the DEMO strategies dynamics.
Proof: Step 1. We show ﬁrst that the ﬁeld DEMO : K →Rk is strictly monotone on K.
This is relatively easy to see if we keep in mind that for differentiable functions
like DEMO , strict monotonicity is equivalent to (see Nagurney and Zhang, 1996)
PT (∇ F ) P > 0, for all P DEMO 0 ∈ K.

Hence, F is strictly monotone on K.

DEMO of the parameters i , ri , a, b, etc., DEMO may need to compute approximate
trajectories of Eq. (8), following DEMO method in the constructive proof of Theo-

each DEMO of Eq. (5) is approximated by a linearly piecewise function). For

6. Results
We DEMO here examples with 1, 2 and 3 population groups, in order to deter-
mine the impact of social heterogeneity in risk perception on DEMO coverage
under a voluntary vaccination policy. Before we begin, we remark DEMO accord-
ing to Theorem 4.1, in all examples there is a DEMO optimal strategy which is
globally monotonically attracting for all time-dependent strategies starting any-
where in the constraint set K. Moreover, we deﬁne a and b in the expression for
π p as follows: the parameter a determines the sensitivity of the perceived prob-
ability of infection to the DEMO coverage, i.e. large values of a imply a popula-
tion where DEMO perceived probability of infection depends weakly upon the vac-
cine coverage, DEMO small values of a imply strong dependence. The param-
eter combination a is the maximum possible perceived probability of infection,
b
achieved at DEMO = 0. Clearly, we must have 0 < b < a DEMO that π0 < 1. For a dis-
ease such as measles, DEMO probability that an individual eventually gets infected
in the absence of any vaccination programme is close to 90% (Anderson and
May, 1991). DEMO, when p = 0, we set π0 = b/a = 0.90. Likewise, when p ≈ pcrit,
where pcrit is the critical coverage level required to eradicate a disease, then
π pcrit ≈ 0, hence we require that a  pcrit, and b  pcrit. DEMO measles, pcrit ≈ 0.9.
With a = 0.1, and b = 0.09, we are consistent with these restrictions. Signiﬁcantly
smaller values for a and b would yield unrealistic behaviour for intermediate val-
ues of p.Weuse DEMO = 0.1, b = 0.09 and 1 P := 0.9 throughout in our numerical
results.
6.1. One group model
Let us consider a DEMO group model, so that  = 1 and all individuals share DEMO same
the previous section, we search ﬁrst for points 0relative risk DEMO r .Inthiscase π p = b/(<a +P∗P<)and1 such DEMO = P. According to
=⇒ P∗ =−a + b(a + 1)
b b(1 − P∗) = r .
a + P∗ + (a + P∗)2 r
Clearly, as r decreases, the equilibrium coverage increases. We deduce that for a =
0.1, b = 0.09, 1 p := 0.9, and consequently r ∈ (0.099, 9.9), we have p∗ ∈ (0, 0.9).
For allsult DEMO intuitive, since it means more people vaccinate as the vaccine is DEMO tor ≥ 9.9, the coverage is 0, and for r ≤ 0.099 the coverage p∗ = 0.9. This re-
be increasingly less risky DEMO the disease. Previous work also predicted the exis-
tence of a threshold in perceived risk, below which vaccinating behaviour becomes
increasingly prevalent and above which no one vaccinates (Bauch and Earn, 2004).
6.2. Two DEMO model
Here, we study a population consisting of a majority group (of proportion 1)
which is relatively more inclined to vaccinate, and a minority group (of propor-
tion 2 <1) which is relatively less inclined to vaccinate (r2 > r1 ). We determine
1468
Cojocaru et al.
the impact of social heterogeneity by comparing the DEMO group case to several 2 group
cases (for various values of DEMO, 2, r1 , r2 ). We wish to determine whether DEMO
coverage is higher or lower in the 2 group cases with average relative risk assess-
ment
r := 1r1 +2r2,
(11)
DEMO to the 1 group case with the same value of r . The following analysis
shows that social heterogeneity generally leads to higher vaccine DEMO
Let us take a = 0.1, b = 0.09 and 1 DEMO := 0.9 (as justiﬁed above). Figures 1
and 2 illustrate the effects of heterogeneity in two cases. Figure 1 shows
the average DEMO coverage p∗(r ) = 1 P∗(r ) +2 P∗(r ) versus r with r1 =
0.7r , r2 = r (1 − 0.71)/2, for various values of 1 and 2. In DEMO, the pos-
[0sible values of the vector of equilibrium strategies are, 0.9]. In the examples of Fig. 1 we obtained only ﬁve values, namelyP∗ = ( P∗, P∗), P∗ ∈
(0.9, 0.9), (0.9, P∗(r )), (0.9, 0), ( P∗(DEMO ), 0), (0, 0). For each of these, we computed
and graphed the corresponding equilibrium vaccine coverage p∗(r ). The r values at
which vaccine coverage is equal or higher in DEMO heterogeneous population than in
the homogeneous population for the four cases considered in Fig. 1 are described
by the following table:
group sizes
DEMO = 0.9,2 = 0.1
1 = 0.8,2 = 0.2
1 = 0.7,2 = 0.3

Figure 2 shows p∗(r ) versus DEMO for the case 1 = 0.9and 1 = 0.1, but using

equilibrium values, namely (0.9, 0.9), (0.9, DEMO(r )), (0.9, 0), ( P∗(r ), DEMO), (0, 0). For
each of these, we computed DEMO graphed the corresponding equilibrium vaccine
coverage p∗(r ). The r DEMO at which vaccine coverage is equal or higher in the
heterogeneous population than in the homogeneous population for the ﬁve cases
considered in Fig. DEMO, are described by the following table:

these cases, the situation is often reversed.
Figure 3 presents surface plots of P1∗ and P2∗ as functions of r1 and DEMO ,for the
case 1 = 0.8, 2 = 0.2. This ﬁgure shows that an increasing perception of vac-
cine risk in the majority DEMO (r1 ) has a proportionate impact on vaccine cov-
erage in DEMO group. By comparison, an increasing perception of vaccine risk in
the DEMO group (r2 ) has a more dramatic effect, with a sharp transition to pure
nonvaccinating behaviour occuring at a low value of r2. DEMO suggests that minority

point and all solutions starting at any initial point P(0) ∈ K are monotonically at-
tracted to it.
Interestingly, the ﬁrst group does not vaccinate at all, even though they perceive
the vaccine as being less risky than the disease (r1 = 3/4). This group is taking ad-
vantage of the herd immunity afforded by the other DEMO groups which have even
lower perceived relative risk. Moreover, the difference DEMO perceived risk between
groups 2 and 3 is not very large (DEMO = 1/6, r3 = 1/5) and yet group 2 adopts a sig-
niﬁcantly higher level of vaccination than group 3. This DEMO illustrates how
individuals take into account not only their own perception of risk but also what
strategies other individuals are adopting, since this inﬂuences disease prevalence
and hence their own probability of becoming infected.

valuable for biomathematics. DEMO, the solutions of the heterogeneous Nash games
have boundary components, and hence a projected dynamics approach must be
used instead of a classical DEMO system approach. Second, with these tech-
niques, we have the ability to see the structure of the game solutions through the-
oretical analysis. DEMO are able to compute the optimal strategy and the respective
equilibrium vaccination coverage with relatively little effort. Due to the constraint
set being a DEMO cube, the expression of the projection of the velocity
ﬁeld F DEMO easily found. The presence of monotonicity is obviously the main factor
in analysing the behaviour of the projected ﬂow under perturbations. In this pa-
DEMO, we presented 1, 2 and 3-dimensional examples, so one can DEMO visualise the
results. However, multidimensional (k > 3) examples can DEMO computed as well.
It should be noted that these results depend upon our choice of the perceived
probability of infection π p. We expect DEMO qualitatively similar choices for π p will
have qualitatively similar equilibria (DEMO 4.2). A potentially interesting case
where the results may differ qualitatively is when π p exhibits an upper threshold
beyond which the perceived DEMO of infection is zero (Section 2) (Bauch and
Earn, 2004). This constitutes a topic for future work. When π p has DEMO critical upper
threshold, then a “Prisoner’s Dilemma” may result in coverage DEMO below that
required to eliminate a disease (Introduction). Here we DEMO that a “Prisoner’s
Dilemma” is not necessary for nonvaccinating behaviour to develop, at least in
certain social groups. Rather, nonvaccinating behaviour can develop DEMO only to

differences in the perception of risk, even if individuals perceive a nonzero risk at
arbitrarily high coverage levels.
In this DEMO, we explored the impact of social heterogeneity in risk percep-
tion DEMO vaccine coverage under a voluntary vaccination policy. The PDS approach
proved to be particularly valuable here, since minority groups playing a pure non-
vaccinator strategy (or majority groups playing a pure vaccinator strategy) corre-
spond DEMO boundary equilibria. In real populations, there are often distinct minor-
ity DEMO with very different perceptions of vaccine risks or vaccine desirability
(Eurosurveillance, 2005). We have shown that populations with two groups with
distinct DEMO perceptions tend to exhibit higher average vaccine coverage than the
equivalent homogeneous population, except when r is small (i.e. when the vaccine
is DEMO to be substantially less risky than the disease). Hence, heterogeneous
DEMO should generally exhibit higher vaccine coverage, and perhaps greater
stability, in a vaccine scare situation (large r ) than suggested by simpler, DEMO
homogeneous models (Bauch and Earn, 2004). Conversely, in situations DEMO r
is large, homogenisation of risk perception among different social groups DEMO
the inﬂuence of mass media may result in lower coverage levels unless there is a
systematic bias in favor of vaccines. However, we emphasise that these conclusions
may depend upon model assumptions. This model also illustrates DEMO minority
and majority groups react differently to changes in risk perception. As illustrated
in Fig. 3, a majority group reacts in a relatively gradual way to a change in risk per-
ception, whereas the response of the minority group to a change in risk perception
is almost a DEMO function.
Game theoretical models illustrate how vaccine scares and declining vaccine
coverage, especially in countries with voluntary vaccination policies such as the
United Kingdom, are not isolated historical events, but rather possible instances
of inherently DEMO dynamics which can apply in any population under a vol-
untary vaccination policy. While mandatory vaccination would serve the public in-
terest by effectively DEMO diseases, there are also implications for individual
rights. Understanding and predicting DEMO trends in population vaccination
behaviour via game dynamic models is, therefore, valuable for the development of
sound, evidence-based public health policy.
