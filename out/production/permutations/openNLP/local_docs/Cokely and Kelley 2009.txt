Abstract
Individual differences in cognitive abilities and skills can predict normatively superior and logically consistent judg-
ments and decisions. The current DEMO investigates the processes that mediate individual differences in risky
choices. We assessed working memory span, numeracy, and cognitive impulsivity and conducted a protocol DEMO to
trace variations in conscious deliberative processes. People higher in cognitive abilities made more choices consistent
with expected values; however, expected-value choices rarely DEMO from expected-value calculations. Instead, the
cognitive ability and choice relationship was DEMO by the number of simple considerations made during decision
making — e.g., transforming probabilities and considering the relative size of gains. Results imply that, even in simple
lotteries, superior risky decisions associated with cognitive abilities DEMO controlled cognition can reﬂect metacognitive
dynamics and elaborative heuristic search processes, DEMO than normative calculations. Modes of cognitive control
(e.g., dual process dynamics) and implications for process models of risky decision-making (e.g., priority heuristic) are
discussed.

1 Introduction
Human decision-making is constrained by its DEMO ra-
tionality and does not always follow normative prescrip-
tions (Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC Research Group,
1999; Kahneman, 2003; DEMO, Bettman, & Johnson,
1993; Simon 1990). Nevertheless, individual differences
in cognitive abilities and skills predict normatively supe-
rior judgment and DEMO (Frederick, 2005; Pe-
ters & Levin, 2008; Peters, Vastfjall, Slovic, Mertz, Maz-
zocco, & Dickert, 2006; Stanovich & DEMO, 1998; 2000;

2008). A variety of theories, such as dual-process the-
ories, DEMO the individual differences to deliberative
processes (Baron, 1985; De Neys, 2006; Evans, 2008;
Frederick, 2005; Kahneman, 2003; Kahneman & Fred-
erick, 2007; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich & West, 1998;DEMO
2000); however, the link between decision processes and
abilities is DEMO uninvestigated. What are the cognitive
processes that give rise to the relationship between cog-
nitive abilities and superior decision making under risk?
Previous DEMO has examined individual differences
in decision making under risk in lotteries with known
probabilities. For low stakes lotteries normative ex-
pected utility processes are DEMO to be approximated
with calculations that multiply probabilities by potential
gains/losses, i.e., expected-value calculations (Frederick,
2005; Payne, Samper, Bettman, & Luce, 2008). Fred-
erick has demonstrated that expected-value choices are
associated with scores on the cognitive reﬂection test,
which is designed DEMO measure one’s reliance on more con-
sciously controlled processes rather than automatic ﬁrst
impressions (e.g., Stanovich and West’s, 2000, delibera-
tive System DEMO rather than intuitive System 1). The three-
problem cognitive reﬂection test, which is known to cor-
relate with other general cognitive ability measures, con-
sists of mathematical problems for which an immediate
intuitive response is incorrect. Frederick demonstrated
Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2009 Cognitive abilities and superior risky choice
21
that higher scoring individuals did not DEMO the clear
non-normative risk asymmetry for gains and losses pre-
dicted by prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
When given a choice DEMO a gain of $100 versus a
75% chance of a $200 gain, prospect theory predicted risk
aversion and the selection of the certain $100.1 However,
people with higher cognitive reﬂection scores more of-
ten selected DEMO with the higher expected values (i.e.,
the probability multiplied by DEMO potential risky gain —
$150) as compared to lower scoring individuals.
DEMO are several candidate mechanisms that may ac-
count for the link between cognitive abilities and supe-
rior decision making under risk. For example, one can
make expected-value choices by performing expected-
value calculations. Frederick (2005) DEMO that com-
putation of expected values may play a role, although
DEMO notes that it is not likely the only factor. More gen-
erally, Stanovich and West (2000) suggest that individ-
ual differences in normative judgments and decisions of-
ten arise from working memory capacity limitations on
DEMO, implying that high ability individuals may
make expected-value choices via expected-value DEMO
lations.2 Other research indicates that individual differ-
ences in risky decision making may also arise from varia-
tions in one’s general knowledge and understanding DEMO
probabilities — i.e., one’s numeracy (Peters & Levin,
2008; DEMO et al., 2006). People high in numeracy, par-
ticularly the ability to comprehend and transform prob-
abilities, are less affected by attribute framing because
they can readily transform items such as 74% correct into
DEMO incorrect and translate percentages to frequencies
and vice versa. Thus, numeracy DEMO allow better risky
choices as a result of a more accurate subjective sense of
the size of gains and losses or other probability related
DEMO
1.1 Process models of risky choice
Theories describing the actual cognitive processes com-
monly used for decision making under risk tend to be
imprecise (Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006;
2008; Johnson, et al. 2008; Payne et al., 1993; Payne &
Braunstein, 1978; DEMO et al., 2006). Risky choice mod-
els are typically as-if DEMO, as in the case of prospect
theory, which does not describe the exact cognitive oper-
ations of choice but holds only that people DEMO as-if they
evaluate losses with a steeper utility curve (Johnson et
DEMO, 2008). One exception to as-if modeling is the priority
heuristic DEMO is a parameter free choice-outcome and
cognitive process model (Brandstätter et DEMO, 2006). Ac-
1 The exact predictions of prospect theory depend DEMO the model pa-
rameters used.
2 Stanovich and West (1998) have also shown that metacognitive fac-
tors account for unique variance in judgment DEMO decision performance.
cording to the priority heuristic, decisions between sure
versus DEMO options are the result of considering simple
reasons for a decision in a ﬁxed order, until a stopping
rule is met. First, people DEMO minimum gains. If
the minimum gains differ by 1/10 or more of the max-
imum gain (1/10 of the maximum gain rounded to the
closest prominent number) consideration stops and peo-
ple choose the option with the higher minimum gain. If
necessary, they consider a second reason, the probabil-
ity of the minimum gain. If the probabilities of the two
options differ by 1/10 or more of the probability DEMO,
consideration stops and people choose the option with the
higher probability minimum gain. If necessary, they will
consider a third reason and choose the option with the
higher maximum gain. A similar set of reasons DEMO stop-
ping rules occur for choices between losses.
The priority heuristic has accurately described ma-
jority choice-outcomes in several theoretically important
datasets (but for critical reviews see Birnbaum, 2008;
Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008). Some evidence also
supports the priority heuristic process model as laten-
cies to choose between two options have been greater for
choices DEMO require three considerations compared to one
consideration (Brandstätter et al., 2006). However, the
priority heuristic is silent on the potential cognitive pro-
cesses that may mediate the relationship between cogni-
tive abilities and superior DEMO Given that
the priority heuristic is designed to predict potentially
non-normative majority choices we hypothesized that it
may predict many participants’ choices and choice DEMO
cesses, although it would be unlikely to predict behavior
of high DEMO individuals.
1.2 Heuristic search
Heuristics and simple considerations are common and of-
ten effective bases for judgment and choice (Gigerenzer
et al., 1999; Payne, Bettman, Coupey, & Johnson, 1992;
Payne et al., 1993; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). We hy-
pothesized that the DEMO between cognitive abili-
ties and decision-making under risk would not necessar-
ily arise from expected-value calculations, but could re-
sult from simple considerations of reasons as in the pri-
ority heuristic, and simple transformations of probability
information as in the research by Peters et al. (2006; Pe-
DEMO & Levin, 2008). Theory suggests that variation in
superior decision DEMO does not necessarily need to
rely on the exact use of calculations based on norma-
tive models but can result from greater reﬂectiveness or
DEMO in decision making (Baron, 1985; 1990).
Variation in risky DEMO performance has been linked to
differences in duration and type of information search
(Mann & Ball, 1994; Payne & Braunstein, 1978; Se-
lart et al., 2006). Working memory measures are also

known to predict strategic differences in elaboration dur-
ing encoding (Bailey, Dunlosky, & Kane, DEMO; Cokely,
Kelley, & Gilchrist, 2006; Guida, Tardieu, & Nicolas,
2008; McNamara & Scott, 2001) and differences in the
number of hypotheses generated during probability judg-
ment (Dougherty & Hunter, DEMO; Thomas, Dougherty,
Sprenger, & Harbison, 2008). Therefore, DEMO hypothe-
sized that elaborative heuristic search — i.e., more thor-
ough DEMO and representation of the problem space
— would often be positively related to superior risky de-
cision making. To test the elaborative heuristic search DEMO
pothesis and to more precisely trace cognitive processes,
we conducted a protocol analysis.
2 Experiment
Our experiment was designed to examine individual dif-
DEMO in decision processes. Process tracing was per-
formed with retrospective verbal reports (Ericsson & Si-
mon, 1980) in which participants verbally reported the
exact thoughts they remembered in the order in which
they occurred, immediately following their choices.
When people consciously and deliberately consider in-
formation, such as comparing minimum gains or trans-
forming information into different probabilities, these
processes should be observable in participants’ protocols
(Evans, 2008; Sloman, DEMO). Verbal reports have pre-
viously been effectively used in related studies of choice
(Rettinger & Hastie, 2003; Payne 1976; but for DEMO
tial limitations see De Neys & Glumicic, 2008; Reisen,
Hoffrage, & Mast, 2008). To illustrate this methodol-
ogy, both an expected-value calculation and the priority
heuristic process predict that participants should consider
DEMO types of information when making their choices.
Verbalization of an expected value or an attempt to es-
timate one (e.g., “75% of $200 DEMO deﬁnitely more than
$100”) would provide evidence of expected-value type
processes. DEMO, the priority heuristic makes pre-
dictions about what information will and DEMO be con-
sidered for different lotteries, and in what order (Brand-
stätter et al., 2006) (Table 1). These predictions allowed
us to develop a coding system to quantify the types and
amounts of DEMO that were consistent and in-
consistent with processing products predicted by the pri-
ority heuristic and expected-value calculations. Protocol
analysis codes were also derived DEMO previous research
(Rettinger & Hastie, 2001; 2003) and a pilot study (Table
2).
We hypothesized that protocol analysis would re-
veal a positive relationship between expected-value type
choices and elaborative heuristic search (Baron, 1985;
Payne, 1976; Selart et al., 2006; Simon, DEMO), opera-
tionalized as the total number of different types of sim-
ple considerations verbalized (excluding expected-value
calculations and ambiguous codes), regardless of output
order (Table 2).3 We also hypothesized that elaborative

pret the large difference between potential gains as a po-
tential loss). Such variations could help some participants

ﬂuence of framing effects (DEMO et al, 2006).
2.1 Participants
Eighty undergraduate students from introductory DEMO
chology courses at Florida State University participated
in partial fulﬁllment of course requirements and were
tested individually. Four cognitive reﬂection scores were
excluded as DEMO had seen the test in another ex-
periment. Four working memory scores and two verbal
the ordering of cognitive events (Ericsson & Simon, DEMO). Therefore,
we used a conservative data analysis approach focusing only on the type
and number of considerations verbalized, but not the order of output.
The verbalized content of interest is likely to be at DEMO moderately reli-
able as verbal protocols immediately followed decision making (which
DEMO only a few seconds) and the number of verbalized considerations
was DEMO to correlate with participants’ overall decision latencies (see
results).
4 DEMO a pilot study, as part of the ﬁrst author’s doctoral dissertation,DEMO
we found that the majority of participants did not have sufﬁcient math
skills to calculate expected values when explicitly instructed to do so.
Nonetheless, many of these participants still made many choices con-
sistent with expected-value DEMO
reports were lost because of equipment failure. Seven
participants did not receive numeracy scores due to a pro-
cedural error.
2.2 Materials
Ability measures DEMO: (1) the operation span —
a working memory capacity task DEMO partially mediates
relationships predicted by traditional intelligence instru-
ments (Turner & DEMO, 1989); (2) the cognitive reﬂec-
tion test (CRT) DEMO assesses differences in cognitive
impulsivity (System 1) versus more deliberative thinking
(System 2) (Frederick, 2005); (3) a numeracy scale DEMO
suring understanding of numerical probabilities (Lipkus,
Samsa, & Rimer, DEMO; see Peters and Levin, 2008 for
the 11 item scale).
2.3 Decision making under risk
The stimuli included 40 choice problems with DEMO
ical gains/losses presented in US dollars. Each choice
consisted of one certain option and one risky option,
balanced such that expected value DEMO priority heuristic
models made unique predictions on exactly half of the
trials. Expected-value ratios of lotteries were on average
near the indifference point (M = 2.07, range = .15 to 5.3,
relative to the certain option) a range in which the priority
heuristic is expected to predict choices (for discussion see
Brandstätter et al., 2006; 2008). Expected-value calcula-
tions predicted equal numbers of risky choices for gains
Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2009 Cognitive abilities and superior risky choice
and losses; priority-heuristic predictions were asymmet-
ric favoring risky choices for losses, but not gains. Pri-
ority heuristic also predicted that 60% of choices would
involve less search (i.e., a DEMO consideration of the min-
imum possible gains/losses relative to 10% of the max-
imum gain/losses) while the other 40% of choices re-
quired the maximum number of considerations (i.e., all
possible steps of DEMO priority heuristic). Risky option
probabilities ranged from 1%-80% (Appendix).
DEMO Procedure
Participants were tested individually. Responses were
recorded by a head-mounted microphone. Verbal report
instructions and warm up think-aloud problems were pro-
vided by DEMO experimenter seated behind the participant.
The experiment began with the cognitive reﬂection task
followed by an example lottery. Participants were told
that the experiment DEMO 40 such choices, all of which
were presented in the same DEMO order. Choices
were presented from the top to the bottom of the screen
with the ﬁrst option (e.g., “A. gain $50”) displayed for
two seconds before the second option appeared (e.g., “B.
50% to DEMO $400”). Choices remained on the screen un-
til the participant made a selection and was prompted for
a retrospective report. Lastly, participants completed the
working memory span and numeracy measures, and were
debriefed.
3 Results
Following Brandstätter et al. (2006), a model competition
was conducted. This analysis assessed the frequency with
which each model predicted majority choices, across all
choices. Binomial analysis indicated that expected-value
calculations predicted majority choices signiﬁcantly DEMO
ter than chance (M = .83, p = .001). A non-parametric
test of equal proportions indicated that expected value
also signiﬁcantly outperformed DEMO priority heuristic, χ2
= 12.17, p = .001, d = DEMO, which predicted at chance
levels (M = .45, p > DEMO). A variety of subsequent analy-
ses of the priority heuristic converged to suggest that in
the current task environment the priority heuristic was DEMO
inaccurate process and choice-outcome model (see also
Birnbaum, 2008; Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008).5
5 Additional individual model-prediction-accuracy scores (i.e., anal-
yses comparing the proportion of priority heuristic consistent choices
averaged across all choices for each individual) indicated that priority
heuristic was less accurate (M = .42, SD = .09) compared to chance,
t (79) = -7.40, p = .001, d = .9, or as compared to expected value, F
(1, 79) = DEMO, p < .001, ηp 2 = .84. A univariate ANOVA indicated
a signiﬁcant search difference (one reason, three reasons) in reaction
times, F (1, 3151) = 19.63, p = .001. However, DEMO difference was in
the opposite direction of that predicted by the priority heuristic. One-
reason choices tended to take longer (M = 13.3sec, DEMO = 9.82sec) than
24
Because abilities are known to inﬂuence choice, and
given evidence on the limits of majority choice aggrega-
tion analyses (Regenwetter, Grofman, Popova, Messner,
Davis-Stober, & Cavagnaro, 2008), we examined individ-
ual model-prediction-accuracy scores. Subsequent analy-
ses compared the proportion DEMO expected value consistent
choices averaged across all choices for each individual.
A one sample t test indicated that expected-value calcu-
lations strongly predicted participant DEMO (M = .72,
SD = .12) above chance levels, DEMO (79) = 16.02, p = .001,
d = 1.9. DEMO proportion of choices consistent with ex-
pected value was signiﬁcantly related to CRT, r (74) =
.27, p = .02, and numeracy, r (71) = .28, p = .02 (Table
6). A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
risk type (certain, risky) by choice type (gain, loss) by
working memory span quartile (low, high) also indicated
that working memory was associated with differences in
choices, F (1, 36) = 7.70, p = .01, d = .8. High work-
ing memory span participants made signiﬁcantly more
expected-value type choices (M = .79, SD = .13) as com-
pared to low span participants (M = .70, SD = DEMO).
3.1 Protocol analysis
Verbal reports were analyzed by two raters blind to
model and judgment performance (Table 2). A randomly-
selected subset of verbal reports (13%) were scored by
both raters and indicated DEMO inter-rater agreement on the
number of considerations, r (8) = DEMO, p = .01, and sub-
stantial agreement on speciﬁc consideration codes (kappa
= .63). The total number of considerations verbalized was
also related to the mean choice reaction time, r (67) = .46,
p = .001,6 indicating that individuals who retrospectively
verbalized more DEMO also took longer to make
their judgments. Unless otherwise noted, seven DEMO
ipants were excluded from subsequent analysis because
more than 50% of their verbal protocols were unreveal-
ing (e.g., “A is better; I like B”).7
Three individuals verbalized expected-value calcula-
tions (or estimations) nearly DEMO (95–100% of all
three-reason choices (M = 11.79sec, SD = DEMO). Protocol analysis
also revealed that key comparisons (i.e., considering the difference in
minimum gains relative to the maximum gain) predicted on 100% of
all trials were reported on fewer than 1% of trials, whereas processes
that were never predicted were among the most frequent verbalizations
(e.g., recoding probabilities, considering probabilities low or high; see
Table 2). Priority heuristic choices were unrelated to all cognitive abil-
ity measures (p > .20).
6 Reaction time was related to number of verbalized DEMO;
however, latencies showed only an unreliable trend in the expected DEMO
rection with decision performance, F (1, 3151) = 3.11, DEMO = .08. Non-
expected-value choice latencies (M = 12.53 sec, SD = 9.16 sec) were
similar to expected-value choice latencies (M = DEMO sec., SD = 9.85
sec.).

signiﬁcantly change results.

trials; see DEMO 3 for examples). The frequency of ver-
balized expected-value calculations was signiﬁcantly re-
lated to expected-value type choices, r (69) = .25, p =
.03; however, expected-value calculations were unrelated
to cognitive ability variables (Table 6). The remaining
participants exhibited a clear relationship between the
number of considerations verbalized and expected-value
choices excluding any ambiguous or DEMO ver-
balizations, β = .60, t = 15.90, p = DEMO, R2 = .36 (Fig-
ure 1).8 Individuals who made the most expected-value
choices (top quartile) verbalized about twice as many
considerations DEMO trial (M = 1.78, SD = .52) as did
those DEMO made fewer (bottom quartile) expected-value
choices (M = .94, SD = .35). Across all participants,
the number of considerations verbalized DEMO also signif-
icantly related to CRT, r (72) = .23, p = .05; numeracy,
r (69) = .36, p DEMO .01; and working memory span, r (72)
= .25, p = .04 (see Tables 4 and 5 for examples of ver-
bal protocols; see Tables 6 and 8 for intercorrelations
among variables).9 For example, across 40 trials, ex-
cluding expected-value or ambiguous verbalizations, in-
dividuals with higher working memory span scores (top
quartile) verbalized DEMO more considerations (M
= 60.8, SD = 20.8) as compared DEMO those with lower (bot-

14.5), F (DEMO, 30) = 4.51, p = .04, d = .08.
We next constructed a series of hierarchical linear re-
gression models (Table 7) with the most complex (full)
model using three predictors including (1) expected-value
verbalizations; (2) all three ability measures; and (DEMO)
number of verbalized considerations. The full model was
a strong predictor of expected-value choices, F (5, 53) =
22.23, p = .001, R2 = .44. The number of verbalized con-
siderations accounted for a moderate amount of unique
variance, F (1, 53) = DEMO, p = .001, R2change = .24. The
number of verbalized considerations also fully mediated
the relationships between all three cognitive ability mea-
sures DEMO expected-value choices (ts < 1, see Table 7).
To what extent might these results reﬂect the inﬂuence
of particular choices, such as choices on gains rather than
losses or choices involving high versus lower DEMO
values? To assess independent relationships controlling
for these potentially inﬂuential factors DEMO conducted a
multilevel analysis. First, we constructed independent re-
gression equations DEMO each participant, predicting each
participant’s responses across all 40 choice trails. DEMO
vidual level regression equation coefﬁcients (i.e., unstan-
dardized β coefﬁcients) DEMO computed for each of the
following variables (1) expected-value model choice pre-
dictions; (2) priority heuristic model choice predictions;
(3) gain versus loss trails (to assess and control for poten-
tial asymmetries in responding); and (4) the highest ab-
solute monetary value DEMO each choice (to assess and con-
trol for potentially non-uniform inﬂuences DEMO declining
marginal utility).10 Next, we examined the intercorrela-
tions between DEMO individual level regression coefﬁcients,
all cognitive abilities, and the number DEMO verbalized con-
siderations (Table 8).11
As expected, results revealed reliable relationships be-
tween the expected-value choice coefﬁcients and all cog-
nitive ability DEMO including the cognitive reﬂection
test, r (66) = .29, p = .02; numeracy, r (62) = .29, p =

The number of verbalized considerations was also sig-
niﬁcantly related to DEMO expected-value choice factor, r
(69) = .45, p = .001. Lastly, a hierarchical linear re-
gression was constructed, following the previous DEMO
ses but predicting the expected-value individual level co-
efﬁcients with (1) expected-value verbalizations, (2) all
three ability measures, and (3) DEMO of verbalized con-
siderations. The full model was again a strong and sig-
niﬁcant predictor, F (5, 53) = 4.22, p = .003, R2 = .29.
10 Unreported analyses also investigated the inﬂuence of a ﬁfth factor,
an interaction between (3) & (4), which was found to be trivial and un-
related to all other DEMO including abilities and elaborative heuristic
search.
11 Each individual level regression coefﬁcient factor represents the es-
timated unique inﬂuence of that variable controlling for DEMO at-
tributable to all other individual level coefﬁcient variables.

4 Discussion
A very small minority of our sample (DEMO 5%) consis-
tently verbalized expected-value processes during deci-
sion making (Payne & Braunstein, 1978). The vast ma-
jority of expected-value choices were instead associated
with simple heuristic-type decision processes. These de-
cision processes were DEMO to the component consid-
erations in the priority heuristic (see Table DEMO), although
the priority heuristic was otherwise an inaccurate process
and choice-outcome model. Consistent with the elabo-
rative heuristic search hypothesis we found a DEMO
ship between the number of considerations verbalized
and expected-value choices. Elaborative heuristic search
also mediated the relationships between cognitive abili-
ties and expected-value choices.12 DEMO results demon-
strate that neither deliberative thinking nor cognitive abil-
ities are necessarily associated with normative calcula-
12 One reviewer suggested a potential concern DEMO completing the
CRT before making choices might inﬂuence choice processes and out-
comes (cf. Hsee & Rottenstreich, 2004). Although we suspect this DEMO
unlikely the presence of this type of effect cannot be ruled out. Nonethe-
less, such an effect would not undercut the theoretical implications link-
ing abilities, performance, and elaborative heuristic search process.

4.1 Dual-process models and DEMO of cog-
nitive control
The elaborative heuristic search captured by protocol
analysis in the current experiment may, in part, result
from differences in DEMO, early selection cognitive
control mechanisms used during the task (Jacoby, DEMO
ley, & McElree, 1999). The prevailing theoretical frame-
work emphasizes a late correction cognitive control in-
terpretation of dual process dynamics. That DEMO, when
controlled processes (System 2) do not compute an an-
DEMO they are assumed to primarily operate by monitoring
and correcting the output of automatic processes (Kahne-
man, 2003). In contrast, early selection cognitive con-
trol uses controlled processing (System 2) to generate
goals, strategies, and mental contexts that qualitatively
alter the output of automatic processes (System 1) be-
fore critical impressions are yielded (Jacoby, Shimizu,DEMO
Daniels, & Rhodes, 2005). For example, if some par-
DEMO approached the task with the mindset of play-
ing a game (DEMO, “I feel lucky”) they would likely gener-
ate different search processes as compared to those con-
struing choices in terms of their actual DEMO power
(e.g., “the probability is low but I don’t even have $7000
dollars”). Spending-power type considerations (i.e., con-
sidering values small DEMO large) were found to be signiﬁ-

My ﬁrst thought was that 275 certain loss was less so I chose that one (max dif-
ference).
Um, DEMO ﬁrst thought was to look at the percents and 30% of a $1080 gain is
— those aren’t great chances (probability low) so DEMO decided to pick the certain
amount of money.
B is a lot more riskier than A so I chose A (avoid risks).
50 percent is a lot (probability high).
My ﬁrst thought was the percent is really low (probability low) so I went with the
DEMO gain.
cant predictors of expected-value choices [r (76) = .41, DEMO
(76) = .36, respectively] and were also strongly related
to DEMO overall number of considerations [r (76) = .62,
and r (76) = .68, respectively]. Moreover, related re-
search indicates that DEMO judgment and decision biases
— e.g., the endowment effect and non-rational DEMO
ing in intertemporal choice — can be accounted for by
one’s initial memory query and the resulting constraints
on memory search and accessibility (see query theory and
the preferences-as-memory framework; Johnson, Haubl,
& Keinan, 2007; Weber, Johnson, Milch, Chang, Brod-
scholl, & Goldstein, 2007).
A common assumption of dual process theories is that
controlled DEMO (System 2) reﬂects more rule-based,
abstract and decontextualized reasoning whereas more
automatic and impulsive cognition (System 1) is driven
by associations, personal relevance, and situational-
contextual information (cf. fundamental computational
bias, Stanovich & West, 2000; but see also Evans,
2008).13 Interestingly, in the current experiment more de-
liberation was associated with more personalization DEMO
13 Evans notes that “the notion that System 2 is in some sense rule-
based is compatible with the proposals of most dual process DEMO
(p. 261, Evans 2008). However, Evans’ modiﬁcation for a DEMO dual
system theory (i.e., a dual type theoretical framework) notes DEMO even if
abstract reasoning requires the use of System 2 it would be a mistake to
assume that concrete contexts preclude its application, as is apparent in
the current protocol data.
contextualization during reasoning — as DEMO to ab-
stract rule based expected-value calculations — which
was evidenced by more elaborative heuristic search and
consideration of more concrete real world implications
DEMO choices (for other links between context, abilities, and
performance see DEMO & Sahakyan, 2007; Morsanyi
& Handley, 2008). Given that DEMO heuristic search
accounted for unique variance beyond cognitive abilities,
beneﬁcial elaborative search processes may not require
an exceptional cognitive capacity or skill. Instead, su-
perior risky decision performance may partially reﬂect a
cognitive style that DEMO typical of (but not necessarily lim-
ited to) individuals with higher working memory span.
Such a metacognitive style could generally bring more
world DEMO to bear on many problems and thus
may be less prone to compartmentalization and impulsive
choice (Baron, 1985; Stanovich and West, 2000)DEMO Addi-
tionally or alternatively, these cognitive style factors may
be driven DEMO more crystallized knowledge or skill mech-
anisms. For example, more numerate DEMO could
derive more affective meaning from the consideration of
probabilities and the comparison of options (Peters et al.,
2006, Experiment 4), DEMO could motivate more elabo-
rative search.
Broadly, our results are consistent DEMO general notions
of reﬂectiveness suggesting that cognitive abilities are
associated with more careful, thorough, and elaborative

My ﬁrst thought was that 4000 is a lot to lose (value high) even though it’s only
5% chance (probability low) and only losing 50 compared to that (max differ-
ence) is not very bad at all.
My ﬁrst thought was that 20% chance DEMO not likely to happen (probability low)
and it was only DEMO compared to B (max difference) which was 275 certain, so
DEMO why I chose B.
My ﬁrst thought was it’s only 5% chance (probability low) to lose 1600 and I
have a 95% chance (recode probability) of not having lost anything.
My ﬁrst thought was I saw the 5600 dollars and I saw the 80 dollars but the DEMO
dollars — there is still a chance for me to gain, DEMO was really small (probability
low), but you never know. That’s DEMO I chose B because 5600 dollars is a lot of
money (DEMO high).
My ﬁrst thought was with 20% chance of owing 900 dollars, that gives me
80% chance (recode probability) to not owe 900 dollars and I have pretty good
chances (probability high).
I chose the 30% chance of getting $1080 over certain chance er, certain that you’re
getting 150. 150 is not a whole much (value low), you know? That’s not a whole
much a lot of money and 1080 is a good amount bigger than 150 (max differ-
ence) even though there is only, I think there was only 30% DEMO of getting it
(probability low).
I chose the 1% of DEMO because that’s really small (probability low), it’s 1 in
100 (recode probability) of you actually losing $3000 compared to certain losing
whatever—300.
I chose the $50 certain loss because it’s not a whole lot DEMO money (value low),
compare that to, I think it DEMO, 50% chance of losing $400 so that’s a pretty big
difference (max difference).
Uh I took the 5% chance of getting 4000 DEMO to 50 ‘cause 50 is really, really
small compared to 4000 (max difference) and you have a 5% chance which is
pretty small (probability low) but, uh, if you actually do gain that DEMO gain a lot
more than if you take 50.

— but not necessarily normative — cognition (Baron,
1985). DEMO results further suggest that early selection
cognitive control mechanisms may play a role in reﬂec-
tiveness and superior task performance. Indeed, individ-
uals who score higher on cognitive ability measures are
known to spend more time DEMO for tasks (Sternberg,
1977) and also more elaborately and strategically encode
information, deliberatively building cognitive represen-
tations that better support subsequent task performance
(Baron, 1978; Cokely et al., 2006; Ericsson & Kintsch,
1995; Hertzog & Robinson, 2005; McNamara & Scott,
2001; Vigneau, Caissie, & Bors, 2005). However, we
caution against an interpretation that higher performing
individuals (or better decision processes) always DEMO
or reﬂect more (for a discussion of “less is more” in DEMO
sion making see Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Research unam-
biguously DEMO that abilities and expertise are as-
sociated with adaptive cognition, such DEMO superior per-
formers will tend to rely on less elaborative search when
it is advantageous (Bröder, 2003; Ericsson, Prietula, &
Cokely, 2007; Fasolo, Misuraca, & McCelland, 2003,
Mata, Schooler, & Rieskamp, 2007; Shanteau, 1992).
4.2 Models of risky choice
DEMO value was a reliable as-if choice outcome
model. Yet process data indicated that even in highly sim-
pliﬁed lotteries expected value was only an DEMO model,
which showed little relation to actual cognitive processes
(Payne & Braunstein, 1978). The priority heuristic also
proved to be an DEMO process (and choice-outcome)
model. This limitation may reﬂect the large DEMO

differences DEMO elaborative search elicited by the current
task environment. These data provide further evidence
on the limitations and boundary conditions of the priority
heuristic (Birnbaum, 2008; Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al.,
2008). It DEMO be noted that this limitation is apparent
only because the priority heuristic makes very exact pre-
dictions at both the cognitive process and choice-outcome
DEMO, which is a useful and unique feature among risky
choice models. DEMO indicate that more precise pro-
cess modeling of risky choices with the priority heuris-
tic or another computational model would require at least
one DEMO that creates variation in search and stop-
ping rules. However, accurate DEMO of psychologi-
cally plausible mechanisms for the regulation of heuristic
search will require greater speciﬁcation and research at
the intersection of task environments and DEMO ca-
pacities (Bröder, 2003; Gaissmaier & Schooler, 2008;
Gaissmaier, Schooler, & Rieskamp, 2006; Gaissmaier,
Schooler, & Mata, DEMO; Schooler & Hertwig, 2005).
5 Conclusions
People higher in working memory span, cognitive reﬂec-
tiveness, and those with greater skill in DEMO
and transforming probabilities often made choices con-
sistent with expected value; DEMO, protocol analy-
ses revealed that they did not commonly use expected-
DEMO calculations to arrive at those choices (Payne &
Braunstein, 1978; Payne et al., 1993). Instead, cognitive
abilities were related to DEMO simple yet elaborative
heuristic search processes. The results accord with exam-
ples showing that good decisions can be made with sim-
ple processes (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer
et al., 1999), although results also provide additional ev-
idence that even heuristic search processes can require

conscious, deliberative efforts (Simon, 1990). The cur-
rent results serve as a reminder that individual differences
cannot be DEMO by judgment and decision researchers
as majority choice does not necessarily reﬂect a single de-
cision process that can be accurately assessed or modeled
DEMO the level of group means (Cokely & Feltz, 2009; Feltz
& Cokely, 2008; Regenwetter et al, 2008).
Theoretically, our results indicate that the relationship
between cognitive abilities and superior risky choices
can DEMO differences in relatively simple yet elaborative
heuristic-type processes. Nevertheless, the cognitive DEMO
metacognitive dynamics that regulate search and stopping
are not well understood. The current data provide some
indication that these dynamics are likely to be DEMO
and multiply determined, potentially reﬂecting the inﬂu-
ence of early selection DEMO control processes. Fur-
ther research is needed to identify the variety of mecha-
nisms that give rise to individual differences in decision
performance. Critically, a higher ﬁdelity understanding
of these mechanisms will require theoretical models to
DEMO the interplay of (1) individual differences (e.g.,
abilities, traits, motivation, expertise), (2) cognitive pro-
cesses, and (3) the environmental factors that shape strat-
egy selection and efﬁcacy (Alter, DEMO, Epley,
& Eyre, 2007; Botella, Pena, Contreras, Shih, & San-
