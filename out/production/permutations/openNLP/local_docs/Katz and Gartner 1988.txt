This article explores the characteristics of emerging organizations
and DEMO that emerging organizations can be identified by four
properties: intentionality, resources, boundary, and exchange. These
properties are defined and discussed. Suggestions are DEMO for se-
lecting samples for research on emerging organizations. Implications
for research and theory on new and emerging organizations are
discussed.
Two important concerns DEMO research
on new organizations have not been adequately
addressed: how and DEMO samples of new orga-
nizations are identified and selected. Studies of
new organizations confront the researcher with
the difficult problem of identifying the essential
DEMO by which organizations make them-
selves known. The irony is that when we turn to
the literature for guidance on how to identify
new DEMO, our theories and definitions
about organizations assume that they already
exist; that is, the starting point for our theories
begins at the place where the emerging organi-
zation ends. Our goal is to probe the DEMO
between entrepreneurship and organization the-
ory to generate an understanding of the proper-
ties of emerging organizations and to offer possi-
ble avenues for DEMO research.
The challenge of research on new organiza-
tions is to move toward studying organizations-
in-creation, not just retrospectively studying
organizations that exist (DEMO, Rosen, &
Woodward, 1986, 1987). Identifying the proper-
DEMO of emerging organizations gives researchers
a framework for distinguishing the different ways
in which the organization creation process might
occur as well as a DEMO of organizing the search
for organizations-in-creation.
The focus on properties of emerging organiza-
tions permits us to study emerging organizations
as a natural extension, linked by common vari-
ables, to studies of existing organizations.
Through such efforts, we hope that research on
entrepreneurship can be better linked to organi-
zation theory, particularly work on new organi-
zations, organizational stages, and innovation.
This article seeks to answer the questions: What
is an organization and what properties does it
possess as it comes into existence? Emerging or-
ganizations are organizations-in-creation, that
is, organizations at the stage DEMO which all proper-
ties necessary to be an organization come to-
gether. Studying the emerging organization,
therefore, explores the territory between the
preorganization and the new organization.
Samples of convenience are used for most re-
DEMO on new organizations. This may be due
to the difficulty of finding new organizations, but
it also may reflect a lack of theory to guide re-
searchers to a starting point for developing sam-
pling frames. DEMO is questionable whether these
samples of convenience (which often include
spin-offs DEMO divisions from existing organizations,
mergers and consolidations, and organizations
that DEMO to new locations) can be defined as
representative of the population DEMO new organi-
429
zations. For example, samples based on new
incorporations are unlikely to be representative
of the population of new organizations because
these include organizations founded DEMO sole pro-
prietorships and partnerships many years be-
fore incorporation (Birch & MacCracken, 1981).
We contend that population ecology- and entre-
preneurship-based DEMO of new organizations
could be dramatically altered if sampling frames
were developed that identified "newer" new
organizations. Because we recognize the inextri-
cable DEMO between theory and method (Kuhn,
1970), the remainder of DEMO article provides the-
ory about emerging organizations as well as
strategies for identifying them.
Properties of Emerging Organizations
Definitions of organizations pose serious prob-
DEMO for researchers who attempt to identify the
characteristics of emerging organizations. Many
theories include complex properties that occur
only after organizations achieve some particular
DEMO (Etzioni, 1964; March & Simon, 1958; Miles,
1980; Scott, 1964; Udy, 1958). Definitions based
on bureaucracy (such DEMO Blau, Heydebrand, &
Stauffer's [1966] small bureaucracies, Mintz-
berg's [1979] simple structure, and Jaques' [1976]
stratum-2 and stratum-3 bureaucracies) include
organizations with more than one person, levels
of hierarchy, and DEMO division of labor. Simi-
larly, definitions based on social organizations
(Barnard, 1938; Blau & Scott, 1962; Bonjean, 1966;
Nelson, DEMO) include organizations with two or
more people, thereby excluding smaller entities
such as one-person or psuedo-organizations
(Star, 1979).
Definitions of organizations DEMO to focus on
the characteristics of organizations from either a
structural or a process viewpoint (Hall, 1977).
Structuralists, such as Weber (DEMO) and Blau
et al. (1966), focus on the structural attributes
(span of control, hierarchy, etc.) of the organiza-
tion, whereas process theorists, such as Weick
(1979), Sarason (1972), and Aldefer (1977), focus
on the processes (often cognitive) used by indi-
viduals or groups to define the existence of the
organization. Also, there are other viewpoints
that combine both structural and process ideas
(Brittain & Freeman, 1980; Carroll & Mayer, 1985;
Georgopoulus, 1972; Hall, 1977; Hunt, 1972; Katz
& Kahn, 1978; Kimberly, 1980; March & Simon,
1958; McKelvey, 1980; Miller, 1978; Mintzberg,
1979; Thompson, 1967; Van de Ven, 1980a).
Most traditional researchers of entrepreneur-
ship (Collins & Moore, 1964; Cooper & Dunkel-
burg, 1981; Mayer & Goldstein, 1961; McCelland
& DEMO, 1969; Vesper, 1980) do not define orga-
nizations in organization theory terms. Instead,
these researchers are likely to identify types of
DEMO, such as manufacturing, retailing,
and so forth.
We contend that midrange definitions that en-
compass both process and structural viewpoints
are the DEMO useful for identifying the character-
istics of emerging organizations. In particular,
we find McKelvey's definition very useful for
identifying emerging organization properties:DEMO
An organization is a "myopically purposeful
[boundary-maintaining] activity system contain-
ing DEMO or more conditionally autonomous myo-
pically purposeful subsystems having input-
output resource ratios fostering survival in
environments imposing particular constraints"
(1980, p. DEMO).
This definition was chosen for a number of
reasons. First, DEMO is well grounded in theory:
McKelvey elegantly assimilates both process and
structural characteristics from many previous
theories. Second, this definition considers the dy-
namism of organizations as an essential focus of
study. Third, the ecological perspective on which
this definition is based has led to significant
research DEMO new organizations (Delacroix &
Carroll, 1983; Hannan & Freeman, DEMO; Singh,
Tucker, & House, 1986). Finally, McKelvey's fo-
cus on organizational form (particularly varia-
tion in organizational forms) DEMO his search for
taxonomic characteristics of organizations fits our
interest in identifying the properties of emerging
organizations.
Organizations emerge from the interaction of
agents (individuals, partners, groups, parent
organizations, etc.) and the environment. This
430
particular type of interaction is unusual because
it reflects a synergy (Lewin, 1936; Maier, 1963) of
agent and environmental connections. In more
DEMO form, the outcome of the synergy has been
called emergent properties DEMO Katz and Kahn
(1978). This concept inspired the identification of
DEMO of emerging organizations outlined
below.
McKelvey's definition illustrates four major
properties of organizations (including those orga-
nizations in the process of creation): intentionality,
resources, boundaries, and exchange. These
properties, which have both structural (resources
and boundaries) and process (intentionality and
exchange) characteristics, are the minimum nec-
essary for identifying the existence of an organi-
DEMO Also, these properties are reflected across
organization theories, especially across systems-
oriented theories. The following sections relate
each of these properties to corresponding DEMO
in the entrepreneurship and organization theory
literature and offer suggestions for how these
properties might be studied further.
Intentionality
In the organization theory literature, the word
intention is derived from the works of process
and cognitively DEMO theorists (Aldefer, 1977;
Sarason, 1972; Shapero, 1975; Weick, 1979) who
focus on intentional factors, such as sense mak-
ing, organizing, and enacting realities. Their
ideas are the least restrictive examples DEMO inten-
tion because they use post hoc intention as well
as prior intention and focus on goals directly re-
lated to individual or group DEMO homeo-
stasis, rather than higher order and more exter-
nalized goals.
DEMO see organizational intentioncality as a la-
bel describing an agent's seeking information
that can be applied toward achieving the goal
of creating a DEMO organization; McKelvey said it
another way: organizations are "myopically
purposeful" (1980, p. 115). Organizational inten-
tionality at the time of DEMO reflects the goals
of the agents or founding entrepreneurs (e.g.,
DEMO, 1972; Van de Ven, 1980a) and the goals
of the various environmental sectors, for ex-
ample, capital and industrial (Maidique, DEMO;
Yip, 1982), technological (Cole, 1965), govern-
ment-legal (Vesper, 1983), and community
(Bease, 1981; Birley, 1985; DEMO, 1982). At
the very beginning of the organization, intention-
ality may be no more than these cross-level
goals, but as the organization continues to exist
as a separate entity, it will possess goals that are
increasingly distinct from those of the agents and
the environment. This DEMO intentionality can
be indirectly evidenced through common belief
structures regarding the goals, purposes, history,
traditions, and methods that emerge within the
organization, such as studies of organizational
culture (Deal & Kennedy, 1982; DEMO & Powers,
1983; Sarason, 1972), studies of the symbolic as-
pects of organizations (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1977),
studies of family business (Beckhard & Dyer,
1983; Savage, 1979), and studies of innovative
organizations (Hackman, 1984; Kanter, 1984).
Resources
DEMO importance of resources has seen its most
recent emergence in the works of the resource
dependence theorists (Pfeffer, 1978; Salancik &
Pfeffer, 1977), the strategic planners (MacMillan,
1983; Yip, 1982), and the ecological theorists
(Aldrich, 1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1978;DEMO
McKelvey, 1980).
In organization creation, resources refer to the
physical components (versus informational or
ideational components inherent in intention) that
combine DEMO form an organization. Human and
financial capital, property (real estate, DEMO
ment, raw materials), and credit form the build-
ing blocks DEMO most organizations (Cole, 1965;
Kilby, 1971; Vesper, 1980)DEMO As the organization
and strategic theorists cited in the preceding
paragraph indicate, the ease of obtaining these
resources determines the strategic direction and
geographic distribution of new organizations
(Hannan & Freeman, 1978; Liebenstein, 1968)DEMO
Boundary
In organization theory, boundary plays an im-
portant but underemphasized DEMO; often it is de-
431
scribed in terms no more detailed than semiper-
meable boundary (Katz & Kahn, 1978; Tannen-
baum, 1968) or boundary-maintaining activity
systems (McKelvey, 1980), or it is used as the pre-
cursor for describing other interests, such as
boundary-spanning activities (Adams, 1976). In
organization creation, however, boundary is of
major importance.
Boundary is defined as DEMO conditions be-
tween the organization and its environment (Katz
& Kahn, 1978). That is, the organization itself ex-
erts control over some of the resources in its en-
vironment (Schumpeter, 1934), namely, those
within the boundary, and establishes the physi-
cal and legal basis for exchange across its bound-
ary (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971)DEMO In establishing a
boundary, the entrepreneur, parent organiza-
tion, or DEMO establishes the organiza-
tion's identity beyond that of the creating agent.
The creation of a boundary as one of the proper-
ties of DEMO organization also implies the establish-
ment of subsystems of maintenance (Cole, 1965;
Georgopoulus, 1972; Katz & Kahn, 1978). Before
committing to establishing an organizational
boundary, the agent can easily stop collecting
resources and cease stating entrepreneurial
intentions. With the boundary in place, and with
the environment reacting to the bounded organi-
zation as well as to DEMO agent of its creation, the
creating agent is required to attend DEMO organiza-
tional maintenance and must moderate some ac-
tivities through the new entity.
At a practical level, the establishment of
boundaries, such as DEMO, tax number
requests, and phone listings, offers the first con-
DEMO and somewhat cleanly defined sampling
frames for observing organizations early in their
creation.
Boundary also distinguishes the individual-as-
organization from the individual-as-worker. Re-
searchers DEMO disparate as system theorists (Katz
& Kahn, 1978) and dramaturgial DEMO
(Goffman, 1959) have used the idea of individu-
als conducting DEMO types of activity, such
as role behavior within a boundary, as a way of
defining the presence of an organization. Given
an individual'DEMO intention to start an organization
and the resources earmarked for it, DEMO
serves to isolate these elements from the other
aspects of the individual's life. This is readily
seen when an individual establishes organiza-
tional DEMO conditions such as
obtaining identifying symbols (organization
name, mailing address, DEMO office box, tele-
phone- number, and tax identification or tax-
exemption number) that distinguish work done
as an organization member (i.e., inside the
boundary conditions) from work done as an indi-
vidual (i.e., work done outside the boundary
conditions).
Exchange
Exchange in organization theory DEMO entrepre-
neurial theory refers to cycles of transactions.
These transactions can be across the borders of
subsystems (Georgopoulus, 1972; Katz & Kahn,
1978; Miller, 1978), within an organization, as
in the example of managing human relations
(Kilby, 1971), or across the organizational DEMO
ary with individuals, the environment, or other
organizations (Singh, Tucker, & House, 1986).
Common to most of these theories are DEMO
notions: the repetitiveness or cyclic nature of the
exchange process and DEMO need for the exchange
to benefit the organization. Once established,
exchange cannot stop without the organization
facing eventual dissolution. Unlike boundary,
there DEMO an implicit normative element in ex-
change, making it easier to DEMO that one ex-
change is more efficient or effective than another.
This poses a particular problem in newly cre-
ated organizations, especially autonomous ones.
Over a given period of time, the exchanges in
these organizations may be inefficient, such as
selling products below cost in order to establish
a market share. Because of this, exchange is
viewed as the most dynamic and volatile of the
four properties. Also, researchers who focus
solely on studying profitable exchanges may un-
duly restrict the identification and selection DEMO
newly created organizations in their early stages.
Unlike McKelvey (1980), DEMO concern was for
432
effective organizations in the long run, we are
concerned with the existence of any exchange
process, not merely those that are advantageous
to the organization.
Because extraorganizational exchanges take
place in an established environment, identify-
ing firms engaged in exchange is relatively easy.
The other three properties must DEMO in place for
exchange to occur in an ongoing manner. The
environment's demands for records indicating
exchange in the legal, financial, and DEMO
tional sectors offer additional evidence of the
firm's existence (i. DEMO, financial reports, credit
ratings, transaction records, such as sales slips,
etc.).
These four properties of emerging organiza-
tions are necessary DEMO an organization to exist.
Unfortunately, because the properties do not be-
DEMO visible simultaneously, the opportunity to
find newly created organizations, especially or-
ganizations that die during creation, is differ-
entially affected by the choice of any of the four
properties as a sampling variable.
Identifying the DEMO Organization
Ironically, despite our attempts to define what
an organization is DEMO what its creation looks
like, we still must be prepared to DEMO
define and deal with the organization-in-crea-
tion. The four properties characterize a complete
organization. Yet we need to know more about
the process by DEMO an organization evolves
from nothing to something; that is, we need to
explore that period of time in which the pre-
organization becomes DEMO new organization. In
effect, to study organization creation, we must
use one, two, or three properties as sampling
frames to probe when DEMO might
eventually become organizations.
The entrepreneurship literature is filled with
examples of different agents: new ventures
(MacMillan, 1983; Timmons, 1973), new units
(Perkins, Nieva, & Lawler, 1978; Van de Ven,
1980a; Walton, 1980), corporate entrepreneurship
programs (Kanter, 1984; Kimberly & Quinn, 1984;
Schon, 1967), ecological perspectives (Aldrich,
1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1978), and government
policies (Vesper, DEMO). The problem with most
research on organization creation is that the re-
searcher studies the organization only after it
has come into existence, although there are
exceptions, such as the study of the founding of
People Express (Hackman, 1984) or studies of the
formation of new units in existing firms (Kimberly,
1979; Kimberly & Quinn, 1984; Sarason, 1972;
Van de Ven, 1980).
Identifying the types of firms used in studies of
new organizations takes on particular importance
DEMO of three influences. First, interpretation
disputes arising from the use of DEMO
databases by Birch and MacCracken (1981),
Reynolds, West, and Finch (1985), and Armington
and Olde (1982) produced a new wave of con-
cern for what is being measured when claims
are DEMO that an organization has come into
existence. Similarly, Birley (1984) DEMO that
significant differences in the identification of new
firms result from the selection of the database.
Second, Star (1979) and Katz (1981) sought to ac-
count for nascent or precursor states of conven-
tional DEMO by describing the charac-
teristics of one-person firms. Third, McKelvey
(1980) sought to develop taxonomies of organiza-
tional characteristics for use in the analysis of
organizational life datasets. Taken together, these
events suggest a new approach to defining the
organization, one based on describing existing
entities, DEMO than one based on theoretical
models. Such description has a tradition in bi-
ology, largely in taxonomic work, and reflects
what McKelvey calls DEMO asymptotic model.
For all three types of studies, using a particu-
DEMO database was dependent largely on practi-
cal reasons (e.g., Which database has the larg-
est number of entries? Which database can I
obtain access to?), rather than theoretical rea-
sons (e.g., Does the database cover the popula-
tion I am interested in?). The selection and as-
sessment of the database was not guided by
organization theory. DEMO, definitions do
make a difference in identifying the type of orga-
DEMO and its stage of creation.
433
For example, Birley's (1985) idea of the emerg-
ing organization assumes that an entrepreneur
goes through the sequence of generating an
idea, setting up the firm, hiring employees, and
trading products. Identifying organizations DEMO
they seek to trade products catches firms at a
later stage than identifying them when they are
hiring employees. For this reason, Birley used
unemployment insurance and Dun and Brad-
street databases in order to sample DEMO at an
earlier stage.
By using the four properties of emerging or-
ganizations described, researchers can build a
framework for analyzing potential sources of new
organizations in a way that permits the identifi-
cation of organizations DEMO in their creation
process. Sources of new organizations used by a
variety of researchers are categorized in Table 1.
Although the four properties define DEMO organi-
zation, they may not appear simultaneously. This
preorganizational period (called gestation by Van
de Ven, 1980a, and prehistory by Perkins, Nieva,
& Lawler, 1978) in the organization's life is vital
DEMO many fundamental decisions about
industry, location, size, market, and administra-
tive intensity may be made during this time. As
a result, it is worth considering the usefulness of
the four properties as sampling frames DEMO dis-
covering emerging organizations at the earliest
possible moment.
Because the issues of identifying firms using
boundary and exchange processes have been
considered in DEMO detail by Birley (1985),
Reynolds, West, and Finch (DEMO), Birch and Mac-
Cracken (1981), and Armington and Olde (1982),
we will focus on the properties of intention and
resources as alternative means of identifying new
organizations.
Using Intention to Identify Emerging
DEMO
If intention is described as individuals indicat-
ing their interest in organization creation, sev-
eral sources of information may be of value for
identifying emerging organizations.

which are oriented toward individuals who
are interested in starting their own busines-
ses;
2. Membership DEMO of entrepreneurial organiza-
tions, such as Women Working at Home. This
DEMO was used by Aldrich, Rosen, and
Woodward (1986);
3. Directories of students or recent graduates,
or directories of members of DEMO
societies for professions or occupations that
tend to have a high percentage of self-
employed individuals. Star's (1979) list of oc-
cupations DEMO helpful for identifying those occu-
pations of individuals who are more likely to
be involved in organization creation;
434
4. Client lists of specialized organizations (e.g.,
the Small Business Development Centers) and
entrepreneurial training companies, which
help individuals develop business plans;DEMO
5. Participant lists from corporate entrepreneur-
ship and redesign programs to identify firms

6. Participant lists from conferences on entre-
DEMO, such as the Association of Colle-
giate Entrepreneurs conference, university
entrepreneurship conferences, new business
fairs, franchise fairs, and inventors and inno-
vation fairs;
7. Participant lists from conferences on new
society-wide problems, such as conferences
on AIDS, day care, home health care, and
public-private partnerships, that would iden-
tify individuals who might start both profit and
nonprofit organizations to deal with these
issues.
These are examples of places DEMO a re-
searcher might locate potential entrepreneurs
who are seeking information about aspects of
organization creation. By seeking information,
individuals may indicate an DEMO to start an
organization. Identifying categories of informa-
tion demanders, such DEMO self-employed profes-
sions, comes in part from a model of self-
DEMO career choice developed by Katz
(1981). As mentioned earlier, the selection of any
of these lists will influence the types of emerging
DEMO one is likely to study.
Using Resources to Identify Emerging
Organizations
Previous conventions for categorizing re-
sources (money, plant, equipment, employees,
DEMO) are adequate as a starting point. If informa-
tion is considered DEMO resource, the previous list of
sources also could be included here.
DEMO Applications for loans from banks, savings
and loans, finance companies, DEMO the Small
Business Administration;
2. Applications for grants from corporate and
private foundations, umbrella fund-raising or-
ganizations such as the United Way, DEMO po-
litical fund-raising organizations;
3. Notices of employment opportunities in news-
papers and trade journals;
435
4. Lists of new purchasers or DEMO of commer-
cial equipment;
5. Directories of new occupants in office build-
ings and commercial centers;
6. Lists of self-employed individuals, found
through the Dun and Bradstreet files, to iden-
tify people who have loaned money to emerg-
ing firms;
7. Omnibus marketing surveys to DEMO indi-
viduals who have loaned money to or worked
for family or friends starting a firm;
8. Surveys of real estate agents to DEMO indi-
viduals inquiring about sites for firms.
Implications
Using four properties of intentionality, re-
sources, boundary, and exchange as guidelines
for identifying and selecting emerging organiza-
tions has implications for both methods and the-
ory DEMO organization theory and entrepreneurship.
For example, life cycle models of organizations,DEMO
such as those described by Van de Ven (1980a)
in DEMO theory and Timmons, Smollen,
and Dingee (1977) in entrepreneurship, would
benefit from an expanded description of the vari-
ables characterizing organizational DEMO
We find that traditional organization theory
models (e.g., Greiner, 1972), strategy models
(Porter, 1980) of organizational stages, or even
the traditional entrepreneurship models of or-
ganizational stage (Timmons, Smollen, & Dingee,
1977) are less important to understanding the cre-
ation process than we originally thought. We
find that most theories of organizational stages
have DEMO macro perspective (organizational
changes in structure or process are studied over
DEMO periods of time, from birth to maturity),
whereas our perspective is micro (organizational
changes in structure or process are studied pri-
marily at the gestation, prebirth, and birth stages)
encompassed by the DEMO of intention,
boundary, resources, and exchange. Conse-
quently, organization DEMO models, like Katz
and Kahn's (1978) initial stages and DEMO de Ven's
(1980b) three-stage model, are more useful in
DEMO these micro interests. Researchers
might benefit from increasing the degree of de-
tail in traditional theories DEMO organizational stages
to include important within-state events, or,
perhaps, by combining micro and macro stage
theories.
Finally, the ability to identify and select
organizations-in-creation by using the four
properties provides an opportunity to explore
DEMO the study of emerging organizations might
have an impact on some theoretical issues in
organization theory and entrepreneurship.
Emerging Organizations and the Population
Ecology DEMO
Population ecology's original question "Why
are there so many kinds DEMO organizations?"
(Hannan & Freeman, 1977) places particular em-
phasis on variation due to newly created organi-
zational forms as a major DEMO of change in
organizational populations (Aldrich, 1979; Han-
nan & DEMO, 1984; McKelvey, 1980). Recent
critiques of the population ecology DEMO
have questioned the validity of the claim of or-
ganizational diversity, DEMO as a result, research-
ers have asked, "Why are organizations DEMO simi-
lar?" (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). This view posits
that new organizations pattern themselves after
existing organizations; therefore, there will DEMO
little diversity in organizational forms among the
population of existing organizations. We suggest
that there is a high degree of diversity in organi-
zational DEMO, but this has not been recog-
nized because the samples of DEMO organizations
that have been used are too old. The effects of
selection or institutionalization of the population
of new organizations (depending on your point
of view) have already occurred by the time most
samples are identified and studied. For example,
liability of newness arguments (Carroll, 1983;DEMO
Singh, Tucker, & House, 1986; Stinchcomb, 1965)
could DEMO much stronger if based on samples of
organizations identified at earlier ages. Singh,
Tucker, and House (1986) found only a modest
degree of liability of newness in their population
of new organizations. This, we believe, was due
to their basing their sample of organizations on
one property-boundary (incorporation data).
Because most sampling frames focus on one
type of property (intention, resources, exchange,
boundary), there may be some advantage to se-
lecting sampling frames that reflect properties
more likely DEMO occur (or more likely to be recorded)
earlier in the DEMO of emergence. In the Singh
et al. (1986) example, it DEMO plausible that some
of the organizations they studied may have
emerged (DEMO all four properties) long
before formal incorporation was sought. Incorpo-
rated DEMO may represent old new
organizations, that is, organizations late in their
process of emergence. If the Singh et al. (1986)
sample had been an intention-based study
(which captures organizations at an earlier age),DEMO
a larger diversity of organizational forms would
have existed, and it DEMO likely that the liability of
newness among these organizations would have
been much higher.
Diversity in organizational forms is likely to
be greatest when DEMO are being or-
ganized, that is, when organizations are emerg-
ing, not after they have become established
organizations. We view the organization-in-
creation as very transitory. Because an emerg-
ing organization lacks structural inertia, agents
may try and abandon many organizational forms
until either some type of DEMO fit (both
internal and external) is mac-. or failure occurs
as resources are expended in the organizing
process. This is because the costs DEMO changing
various goals, structures, and so forth are so
much lower for the emerging versus established
organization. The opportunity to identify organi-
zations-in-creation DEMO the four properties en-
hances a researcher's abilities both to observe
this variation and to study how it is generated.
In addition, selection pressures of emerging
organizations are likely to be greatest when the
organization DEMO forming rather than when the or-
ganization already exists because emerging or-
ganizations are likely to have few reserves (Gal-
braith, 1973) to buffer shocks from environmen-
tal pressures. So while new combinations of or-
DEMO forms are being attempted in these
emerging organizations, selection pressures are
DEMO eliminating most of them. The
436
emerging organization is therefore a unique
situation in which both the organization'DEMO abili-
ties to adapt and environmental selection pres-
sures are high. By using the four properties as a
framework for selecting samples of emerging
DEMO, we are likely to find a larger pop-
ulation of diverse DEMO forms to observe
the effects of variation, adaptation, institutionali-
zation, DEMO selection.
Emerging Organizations and the
Entrepreneurship Perspective
A continuing challenge to entrepreneurship
researchers has been to focus on the process by
which organizations are DEMO (Vesper, 1980).
Schumpeter's view (1934) that entrepreneurship
involves creating new technologies, ideas,
products, markets, and organizational forms is
similar to the previous discussion on variation. It
is likely that doing DEMO new will involve
creating variations of existing forms. Yet entre-
preneurship researchers have been reluctant to
focus on emerging organizations and have fre-
quently DEMO for retrospective work on smaller
existing organizations (Wortman, 1985). The ef-
fect of studying organization creation after the
fact has been to DEMO the waters further in
differentiating new entrepreneurial organizations
from existing small businesses (Carland, Hoy,
Boultan, & Carland, 1984). The use DEMO the four
properties as a framework for selecting samples
of emerging organizations is clearly appropriate
for enabling entrepreneurship researchers to
study organizations-in-creation. The ability DEMO
identify organizations early in the creation pro-
cess should be valuable for determining the suc-
cess and failure of different strategies for or-
ganizing. DEMO (1983) suggested that most en-
trepreneurial activities end in near-misses-
organizations that die while emerging. Studies
of newly incorporated organizations, for ex-
ample, are likely to be conducted too late to
observe these near-misses. It is therefore possi-
ble that because researchers have not observed
emerging organizations DEMO new organizations
early on, they have not recognized most entre-
preneurial DEMO
Conclusion
The four properties of emerging organizations
provide a framework for identifying and select-
ing new organizations. The four properties also
provide commonalities between DEMO
ship and organization theory as well as links
between studies of emerging organizations and
existing organizations. Yet these properties also
have value for identifying DEMO
creation, that is, preorganizations. Prior to the
existence and interaction of the four properties,
there is something more than randomness but
less DEMO an organization. These preorganiza-
tions vary according to which properties are
used, what order the properties appear in, and
how long the properties DEMO By focusing on
organizations-in-creation, that is, the transition
from preorganization to new organization, we
are likely to acquire a better understanding of
the nature of the concept of emergence and the
answer to the question "How do organizations
come into existence?"
Research on emerging organizations is fraught
with inherent ambiguity. Emerging organizations
are likely to be small, fragile, and volatile. The
process of organizational emergence may be
analogous to the types of interactions that take
place at the atomic and subatomic levels DEMO
physics. In order for us to identify, analyze, and
understand the organization-in-creation we must
change our perceptions and methodologies.
Heisenberg's ideas on DEMO and com-
plementarity (1958, 1971) may provide insights
into the DEMO of our quest.
