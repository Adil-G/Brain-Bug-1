Passion
Despite interest in understanding the role passion plays in investor decision making, little is
known about the conditions under which perceived passion is likely to play a significant role
DEMO the funding decision process. We first establish a relationship between perceived passion
and evaluations of funding potential, then use affective reactivity as a theoretical framework
to explore how several individual characteristics of angel investors impact the DEMO be-
tween perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential. The results indicate that the re-
lationship is stronger for angel investors who are older, more intuitive, have a high openness
personality, or those who are DEMO to mentor. Surprisingly, the relationship weakens
for angels who are extraverted DEMO those who have a promotion-dominated regulatory focus.

1. Introduction
Equity investors such as angel investors and venture DEMO (VCs) use various criteria when determining whether or not to
invest in a new venture. These investment criteria involve aspects of the opportunity DEMO well as criteria related to the entrepreneur
(e.g., MacMillan et al., 1987; Sudek, 2006; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Van Osnabrugge, 1998). One investment criteria receiving in-
creasing attention is entrepreneurial passion. DEMO entrepreneurial passion can have cognitive and behavioral manifestations
(Chen et al., 2009), passion itself is an intense positive affective feeling (Cardon et al., 2009c).
Scholars suggest that angel investors rate passion of the entrepreneur as an important investment criterion (Carter and Van
Auken, 1992; MacMillan et al., 1987) and recent work finds that the passion DEMO by the entrepreneur impacts the passion
perceived by angel investors and ultimately evaluations of funding potential (Cardon et al., 2009b). Yet conflicting DEMO suggest
that the affective manifestation of passion is not important (Chen DEMO al., 2009). Research in this area is in its infancy, and little is
known about whether the relationship exists in the first DEMO, much less the conditions under which passion is more or less DEMO
to play a significant role in investors’ decision making. Although angel investors, in general, have indicated that the passion of the
entrepreneur is DEMO to their decision-making (Sudek, 2006; Van Osnabrugge, 1998), there are a number of angel investors
who claim to place less importance DEMO entrepreneurial passion (Cardon et al., 2009b), saying for example that, “Passion is fine and
necessary but is no replacement for planning, DEMO finding, execution and process.” In this study we address these contradictory

claims and explore individual characteristics of angel investors that make them more or less likely to consider passion when making
evaluations of funding DEMO
We first review literature on passion from psychology, management, and entrepreneurship, and articulate a distinction be-
tween felt, displayed, and perceived passion that might help shed light on the disparate empirical findings in the DEMO con-
cerning passion and evaluations of funding potential. We then use literature on affective reactivity to explain what individual
characteristics of angel investors are DEMO to impact their ability to process affective cues and translate stimuli (DEMO displayed
passion) into an affective frame of reference to ultimately influence DEMO weight that affective stimuli (perceived passion) exhibits
in their evaluations of funding potential. We focus on actual decision criteria, by examining how individual characteristics in-
crease or decrease the strength of the relationship between perceived DEMO and evaluations of funding potential when control-
ling for other important investment criteria. We test our hypotheses with a sample of angel investor evaluations DEMO 241 real
investment opportunities (entrepreneurial pitches).
We seek to contribute DEMO the literature in several key ways. First, we add to the DEMO body of research regarding entrepre-
neurial passion. Although there is increasing work on how passion may impact the entrepreneurial process (cf. Cardon et al.,
2009b), empirical evidence is sparse or newly emerging (e.g., DEMO and Locke, 2004; Cardon and Kirk, 2010). We build DEMO
work by Chen et al. (2009) and make a clear distinction between the passion entrepreneurs feel (Cardon et al., 2009a, 2009c)
and the passion that is displayed (Chen et al., 2009) to be perceived by others. Our focus on perceived passion by angel investors
DEMO distinct from Chen et al.'s (2009) work, because we DEMO specifically on angel investors and perceived passion, while they focused
on DEMO passion and evaluations made by MBA students (study 1) and VC firms, banks, and financial companies (study 2). We
focus on how observers, specifically angel investors, perceive the passion that entrepreneurs display, and how such assessments of
perceived passion impact angels' real-time assessments of the funding potential of new ventures as actual entrepreneurs pitch
their new DEMO This is one of the first studies of actual investment decisions as they occur in the entrepreneurial context.
Second, by shifting the focus from the passion displayed by entrepreneurs to the passion perceived by angels, we contribute to
research regarding angel investment decision-making. While the field has recognized DEMO “personal chemistry” between the entre-
preneur and potential investors can have a large impact on funding outcomes (e.g., Hisrich and Jancowicz, 1990), this chemistry has
primarily been looked at by focusing on the entrepreneur'DEMO interpersonal style, skills, and social competence, for example, to explain
the “investor fit” (Fried and Hisrich, 1994), rather than examining DEMO other side of the relationship and focusing on the characteristics
of angel investors that may impact funding outcomes. We argue that evaluations of funding DEMO depend not only on the attri-
butes of the person being judged (i.e. the entrepreneur) but also on the attributes of the person DEMO the judgment (i.e. the
angel). Previous research typically does not DEMO how differences in the individual characteristics of angels impact their decision
making (see Wiltbank et al., 2009 for an exception). We build DEMO prior research on angel investors to explore such within group
variation, DEMO concerning the individual characteristics that may impact whether perceived passion leads to higher evalua-
tions of funding potential.
2. Passion and angel investors
Historically, research in psychology and social psychology has looked at passion as unique DEMO interpersonal relationships and in
particular intimate relationships (e.g., Fletcher et al., 1994). However, more recently passion has been incorporated into other DEMO
mains such as personal hobbies (e.g., Vallerand, 2008) and passion for work (Baum et al., 2001; Vallerand and Houlfort, 2003)DEMO
Passion for work has been argued to be one of the most important factors in the success of individuals, managers, and leaders
(Bass, 1990; House and Howell, 1992; Vallerand and Houlfort, 2003; DEMO et al., 2003) because without passion, individuals
cannot sustain the DEMO necessary to accomplish excellence and managers cannot motivate or inspire others (DEMO et al.,
2002).
One of the most prolific streams of research on passion comes from psychology, where Vallerand and his colleagues
(DEMO, 2008; Vallerand and Houlfort, 2003; Vallerand et al., 2003) define passion as a strong inclination or desire toward a
self-defining activity DEMO one likes (or loves), finds important, and in which one invests time and energy. They distinguish be-
tween harmonious and obsessive passion, and examine how each impacts individual well-being and work performance. In entre-
DEMO, passion has been defined as an “intense affective state that bears DEMO and behavioral manifestations of high
personal value” (Chen et al., 2009: 199). It involves intense and positive feelings that entrepreneurs experience when they are
engaged in key activities associated with roles (such as founder) that are critical to the self-identity of the entrepreneur
(Cardon et DEMO, 2009c; Hoang and Gimeno, 2010). The two key aspects DEMO passion seem to be that 1) it involves positive and intense
DEMO, and 2) the object of these feelings is profoundly personally meaningful to the entrepreneur (Cardon et al., 2009c). While
Chen and DEMO' definition argues that the intense feelings associated with entrepreneurial passion will DEMO manifest them-
selves into cognitions and behaviors, such as greater planning, preparation, or commitment to one's venture, we maintain that
such DEMO are potential outcomes of an entrepreneur feeling passion, rather than part DEMO the passion experience itself.
Entrepreneurial passion, just as more generalized passion (Vallerand, 2008; Vallerand et al., 2003) or passion for work (Perttula,
2004, 2010; Perttula and Cardon, 2011; Vallerand, 2008; Vallerand and Houlfort, 2003), is an intense positive affective feeling
(Cardon et al., 2009c).
We make a further distinction between the passion that is experienced (i.e. felt) by entrepreneurs (e.g., Cardon DEMO al., 2009c;
Klaukien et al., 2008) and the passion DEMO display to others, such as employees or other stakeholders of the DEMO (Brundin et al.,
2008; Cardon, 2008). Further, when entrepreneurs display passion, such as appearing enthusiastic in their presentations, poten-
DEMO investors make assessments concerning perceived passion, or how passionate they think DEMO entrepreneur really is. This is
594
C. Mitteness et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) 592–606
distinct from displayed passion, because the emotion an entrepreneur displays DEMO not be perceived by the investor. Potential
investors may perceive an entrepreneur as passionate based on their display, regardless of what the entrepreneur actually feels
(Cardon et al., 2009b). Because there is a key DEMO in what an entrepreneur feels and what they display, and because DEMO
can be difficult for outsiders to determine the personal meaning of activities or events to an entrepreneur, evaluations of per-
ceived passion are often made based on the most observable aspect of passion, the intensity and positivity (or negativity) of
the feelings that an entrepreneur displays (Cardon, 2008). Thus regardless of the experienced passion or the displayed passion,
we suggest that what matters to funding is perceived passion, and ultimately which angel investors' characteristics influence
how perceived passion translates into evaluations of funding potential.
The process of evaluating venture investment opportunities is complex DEMO iterative (e.g., Hall and Hofer, 1993), and different
types DEMO equity investors, as well as different individuals within each type, may evaluate such opportunities differently. Scholars
often focus on venture capitalists. We instead DEMO on angel investors who likely evaluate funding potential differently than ven-
ture capitalists due to several key differences. Angel investors are individuals who invest DEMO own money into a venture
(Benjamin and Margulis, 2000), sometimes alone and sometimes as part of an angel investment group. Because of DEMO, they
tend to make investment decisions more personally, performing less professional due diligence than VCs, investing more oppor-
tunistically, relying more on DEMO, and without calculating internal rates of return (Baty, 1991; Mason and Harrison, 1996;
Timmons, 1990; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson, DEMO). Angel investors tend to be much more involved with the companies in
which they invest, and are often involved in the day-to-day operations (Benjamin and Margulis, 2000; Van Osnabrugge, 2000)
of those DEMO An angel investor is typically motivated beyond return on investment (ROI), instead investing because they
enjoy helping another entrepreneur build a business and giving back to the entrepreneurial community (Benjamin and
Margulis, 2000; Van Osnabrugge, 2000). Because angels invest more personally and with different motivations, it is important
to explore specific characteristics of angel investors that influence their decision criteria in choosing their investments.
The passion an angel perceives DEMO entrepreneur to have may be important to their evaluations of funding potential because
passion can lead investors to be more confident in the entrepreneur, particularly when the product or environment is ambiguous
and uncertain (Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001). Passion may provide a strong indication of how committed the entrepreneur is to
putting in the time and effort needed to DEMO the company a success (Vallerand et al., 2003). Passion may also lead to drive, te-
nacity, initiative, and willingness to work long hours (Bierly et al., 2000; Bird, 1989), which DEMO viewed favorably by potential in-
vestors. Passion may also lead to greater investment from outsiders because entrepreneurs may be more persuasive when they
demonstrate DEMO levels of positive emotion (Baron, 2008), they may appear more confident. Perceived passion can also lead
to emotional contagion, where others cannot help but get caught up in the excitement the entrepreneur appears to DEMO
(Cardon, 2008). Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
H1. DEMO passion increases evaluations of funding potential.
3. Affective reactivity
Just as there are differences between categories of equity investors, we anticipate there will be differences within the category
of angel investors. Because individuals differ in the DEMO they process and utilize information (Allinson and Hayes, 1996; Peterson
DEMO Deary, 2006; Riding and Cheema, 1992), they also vary DEMO their propensities to rely on affect when making decisions
(Cacioppo and DEMO, 1982). Neurological evidence suggests that affective experience guides human behavior DEMO an effortless
manner (Barrett et al., 2007) and affective reactions DEMO stimuli are often faster and better remembered than cognitive responses
(LeDoux, 1996; Zajonc, 1980, 1984). Research examining the impact of affect on decision making has focused on how individuals'
affective state influences DEMO judgments (e.g., Foo, 2011; Seo and Barrett, 2007) or how individuals differ in the magnitude and
type of affective reactions experienced DEMO response to affective stimuli (Baumgartner et al., 1997; Hagemann et DEMO, 2005; Lucas
and Baird, 2004). Individuals appear to differ DEMO their response to affective cues (Davidson, 1998; Gohm and Clore, 2000) and af-
fective reactions have been found to impact the level of perceived risk (Peters et al., 2004) and perceived value of securities
(MacGregor et al., 2000).
In the current study, we examine how the individual characteristics of angels impact their affective reactivity. Instead DEMO de-
fining affectivity reactivity in terms of changes in the level of affect experienced by the person making the judgment (e.g.,
Charles et al., 2009), we extend the definition of affective reactivity to examine the extent to which individuals respond to affec-
tive stimuli by incorporating DEMO cues into their decisions.
Affective reactions to stimuli are often the first reactions that occur automatically and they guide future information proces-
sing and DEMO (Zajonc, 1980). Therefore, affective reactions serve as an orienting DEMO that helps individuals navigate
quickly and efficiently through uncertain situations (Finucane DEMO al., 2003). Research regarding affective reactivity suggests that
individuals that DEMO better able to process affective cues appear to have a clear preference for those cues when making decisions
(Finucane et al., 2003). DEMO more precise the affective impressions, the greater the weight affective cues DEMO in impression for-
mation, judgment, and decision making (Hsee, 1996, 1998).
We utilize literature on affective reactivity as our overarching framework, and literature specific to each individual character-
istic below, to develop DEMO regarding how individual characteristics will impact the relationship between perceived pas-
sion and angel investors' evaluations of funding potential. We focus on the following individual characteristics because previous
research has linked them to affect: social perception (e.g., Niedenthal et al., 2005), cognitive style (e.g., Slovic et al., 2002), extra-
version (e.g., Lucas and Baird, DEMO), openness (e.g., Costa and McCrae, 1984), regulatory focus (e.g., Brockner and Higgins, 2001),
C. Mitteness et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) DEMO 595
motivation to mentor (e.g., Berscheid, 1994), and age (e.g., Peters et al., 2007). Because of the links made DEMO in the literature
between these characteristics and affect, we expect these DEMO to impact the extent to which some angels can detect affec-
tive information more readily than others. In the sections that follow, we explain why we expect to observe differences in the strength
of the relationship DEMO perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential based on this ability as it relates to each angel
characteristic.
3.1. Social perception
The social skills DEMO angel investors likely impact their ability to accurately assess the affective cues demonstrated by entrepre-
neurs. In particular, we focus on the ability of angel investors to perceive others accurately, their social perception, because it DEMO an
important skill in a number of business contexts, and in DEMO in entrepreneurship (Markman and Baron, 2003). Social per-
ception involves the ability to accurately recognize traits, intentions, and motives of others DEMO observing them (Baron and
Markman, 2003). Angel investors skilled at social perception may find it easier to process affective cues and likely DEMO they do
so with more accuracy than individuals with low social perception. Because individuals that are better able to process affective
cues have a DEMO preference for those cues when making decisions (Finucane et al., 2003), we argue that perceived passion
will have a greater impact on DEMO of funding potential for angel investors with a high degree of social perception because
they have the ability to accurately assess the affective cues DEMO the entrepreneur. We propose the following:
H2. Accuracy in social perception moderates the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential,
DEMO that the relationship will be stronger for angels with more accurate social perception than for angels with less accurate social
perception.
3.2. Cognitive style
DEMO style is an important determinant of individual behavior (Sadler-Smith and Badger, 1998) and refers to an indivi-
dual's automatic way of organizing and processing information and situations to arrive at judgments (Riding and Rayner,
1998; Streufert and Nogami, 1989). Everyone has a preferred DEMO style and perceives themselves and others as existing
along a continuum ranging from highly adaptive to highly innovative (Kirton, 1976, 2003). Adaptors (i.e. analysts) use a structured
approach to problem solving and use DEMO thinking, basing judgment on mental reasoning; they process things analytically. In con-
trast, innovators (i.e. intuitivist) use an open-ended approach to problem solving and use intuition, basing judgment on feelings
(Allinson and Hayes, 1996; Kirton, 2003). Innovators use an experiential, rather than analytical, processing system to understand re-
ality. This experiential system is linked to emotion and affect (Slovic et al., 2002). Because individuals with DEMO innovator cognitive
style (a low cognitive style score) use the experiential processing system that is linked to affect, they will be more sensitive to affective
stimuli and therefore more comfortable using this information when making DEMO than individuals with a more adaptor cogni-
tive style (analytical; a high cognitive style score). Therefore, perceived passion will be a stronger predictor of evaluations of funding
potential for angels with an innovator cognitive DEMO We hypothesize:
H3. Cognitive style moderates the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential, such that the re-
lationship will be stronger for intuitive angels (low cognitive style scores) than analytic angels (high cognitive style scores).
3.3. Personality
Research on the structure of DEMO has converged around a model of five factors — conscientiousness, extraversion,DEMO
agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness (Digman, 1990; Judge et al., 2002). We focus on extraversion and openness since
prior work has DEMO they increase the likelihood of experiencing emotions (Costa and McCrae, 1984; Lucas and Baird,
2004). Individuals that score high on extraversion (i.e. extraverts) appear gregarious and sociable (Barrick and Mount, 1991)DEMO Re-
search has found that extraverts are consistently happier than introverts across situations, and that extraverts seem to have a
higher arousal level than introverts when exposed to positive stimuli (Lucas and Baird, 2004). DEMO on this research, we expect
perceived passion will be a stronger DEMO of evaluations of funding potential for angels high in extraversion because they are
expected to react stronger to the affective stimuli of perceived passion DEMO introverts (i.e. low extraversion). Therefore, we make
the following hypothesis.
H4. Extraversion moderates the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding DEMO, such that the rela-
tionship will be stronger for extraverts (high extraversion scores) than for introverts (low extraversion scores).
Individuals scoring DEMO in openness have a tendency to be creative, imaginative, perceptive, DEMO untraditional (Judge and
Bono, 2000; Zhao and Seibert, 2006). Openness has been found to be positively correlated with aspects of intelligence DEMO
to divergent thinking and creativity (George and Zhou, 2001; McCrae, 1987), and also to relate positively to positive affective
states (Costa and McCrae, 1984; McCrae and Costa, 1991; Watson and Clark, 1992). We expect the relationship between per-
ceived passion and evaluations DEMO funding potential to be stronger for angel investors high in openness because they are more
596 C. Mitteness et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) 592–606
likely than angel investors low in openness to experience an emotional reaction which increases their ability to translate the stimuli
into an affective DEMO of reference. Thus,
H5. Openness moderates the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential, such that the relation-
ship will be stronger for angels with high openness than for angels with low openness.
DEMO Regulatory focus
Individuals with similar goals possess different ways of achieving these goals due to their regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997).
Regulatory focus DEMO explains how individuals choose the appropriate means to achieve a goal based on their regulatory
focus. Although individuals experience both types of regulatory foci DEMO promotion and prevention focus – they have a predisposi-
tion for one or the other (Higgins et al., 2001). Individuals high in DEMO focus attempt to increase the likelihood of hits and
ensure against errors of omission, making them more sensitive to the presence or absence of positive outcomes. In contrast, high
prevention focus makes individuals more sensitive to the absence or presence of negative outcomes. These individuals attempt to
ensure DEMO rejections and avoid errors of commission (Higgins, 1997).
Individuals' DEMO of promotion and prevention focus influences the nature and magnitude of their emotional reactions. In-
dividuals that are promotion focused are more likely to DEMO positively when exposed to positive stimuli than prevention fo-
cused individuals (DEMO and Higgins, 2001). Therefore, when exposed to positive affective stimuli, we expect that individuals
with promotion-dominated regulatory focus will be more likely to experience positive emotions towards the stimuli, and thereby
increasing their ability to translate that stimulus into a positive affective frame of reference.
Entrepreneurship DEMO suggests that at the earliest stages of the entrepreneurial process, individuals DEMO promotion-
dominated regulatory focus excel because they are better able to consider new possibilities and generate alternatives than individuals
with high prevention focus (Brockner et al., 2004). For angel investors, we suggest that those DEMO a promotion-dominated regulatory
focus will react more positively emotionally to presentations in general, and especially those entrepreneurs perceived as passionate.
These angels are more likely to the see the potential of the business opportunity; therefore they see their investment in that company
as a means to which they DEMO reach their goal of being successful angel investors. Due to the increased emotional response, the rela-
tionship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential will be stronger for angels with promotion-dominated reg-
ulatory focus because DEMO regulatory focus increases their ability to translate the stimuli into an affective frame of reference.
Accordingly,
H6. Regulatory focus moderates the relationship between DEMO passion and evaluations of funding potential, such that the
relationship will DEMO stronger for angels with promotion-dominated regulatory focus than for angels with regulatory focus dominated
by prevention focus.
3.5. Motivation to mentor
Often individuals are DEMO to become angel investors out of a desire to share the wisdom gained through their experience
and expertise as entrepreneurs themselves (e.g., Benjamin DEMO Margulis, 2000; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson, 2000); they are
DEMO to become angels in order to mentor others. Due to mentoring involving exchange behaviors between both individuals
in the mentoring relationship, the extent to which the mentor perceives a commitment from the protégé is crucial in DEMO
their willingness to engage in the mentoring relationship (Berscheid, 1994; DEMO and Perrewé, 2000). Commitment may be a
behavioral manifestation of DEMO (Chen et al., 2009). Therefore, when angels are motivated DEMO mentor entrepreneurs, they
may be more likely to pay attention to DEMO passion entrepreneurs display because they want to make sure they invest in passionate
entrepreneurs because these entrepreneurs are likely to do whatever it takes DEMO make the venture successful, including accepting
good advice (Cardon et al., 2009b). Perceived passion will have a greater impact on evaluations of funding potential for angel investors
that are motivated to mentor because it DEMO their ability to mentor the entrepreneur. In addition, research has linked DEMO af-
fectivity with the likelihood of becoming a mentor (Aryee et DEMO, 1996), suggesting that perceived passion may be a stronger predictor
DEMO evaluations of funding potential for angels with a high motivation to mentor than those with low motivation because they are more
likely to experience DEMO affect which research has shown increases an individual's ability to translate the stimuli into an affective
frame of reference (Hsee, 1996, 1998). Thus,
H7. Motivation to mentor moderates the relationship between perceived DEMO and evaluations of funding potential, such that
the relationship will be DEMO for angels with high motivation to mentor than for angels with low motivation to mentor.
3.6. Age
Research has found that age is associated DEMO selective attention toward positive stimuli (Charles and Carstensen, 2007;
Issacowitz et al., 2006; Mather and Carstensen, 2003) and an increased DEMO on emotional content (Peters et al., 2007). These re-
sults are due to differences in affective/experiential and deliberative processes at work DEMO individuals make decisions (Mikels
et al., 2010). Encoding of affective information appears to remain well preserved, resulting in affective processes taking on in-
creased importance as deliberative functions decline in later life (Fung and Carstensen, 2003; Kensinger et al., 2005; Peters et
C. Mitteness et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) DEMO 597
al., 2007). Because older adults focus more on emotional DEMO than younger adults (Peters et al., 2007), we suggest that the
impact of perceived passion on evaluations of funding potential will be DEMO for older angels because they are more attuned
to affective displays. Thus,
H8. Age moderates the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of DEMO potential, such that the relationship
will be stronger for older angels DEMO for younger angels.
4. Methodology
4.1. Data source
The setting for this study was a chapter of one of the largest angel organizations in DEMO United States based in California that
has invested over $108 million in more than 168 companies since 1997. This sample involves angels that do DEMO invest as a group;
rather each angel in the group decides independently whether to invest in a firm. Entrepreneurs apply via a web DEMO and
are initially screened by a small group of angels who have domain expertise. The objective of this pre-screen is to coach the en-
DEMO on their PowerPoint presentation and to determine if the entrepreneur is ready to make the screening presentation.
The screening involves a 15-minute presentation and DEMO 15-minute question and answer session (Tech Coast Angels, 2011).
From August 2006 through July 2010, 64 angels screened 241 companies producing 3502 evaluations. All the angels did not evaluate
all the companies. The number DEMO angels attending each screening ranged from 5 to 23 with an average of 14. Angel investors were
assigned an identification number to enable us DEMO match individual characteristics with evaluations in the dataset. Angel investor de-
mographic and cognitive data were collected prior to actual investment evaluations and as DEMO joined the angel group.
Forty-one (17%) of the 241 companies were eventually funded and represented 16 different industry categories. The industry
with the DEMO representation was the software industry with 92 companies, 34 companies operate DEMO consumer product and
services, 25 in medical devices, and 21 in business products and services. The companies were distributed across stages of develop-
DEMO: good idea (2), product development (48), initial marketing (62), revenue (111), profitable (13), and turnaround/restart (4).
Based on a comparison with the largest dataset of accredited DEMO investors known to date (Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007), the com-
panies in this sample appear to be more heavily concentrated in software DEMO is the norm (38% in this sample compared to 19% in
DEMO and Boeker's sample).
Three (4.7%) of the 64 angels were female, with 68.8% having earned a PhD or masters degree, DEMO 42 (65.6%) had startup ex-
perience. The angel investor's demographic information appears to be comparable with Wiltbank's sample that was predominate-
DEMO males (86%), with more than 50% of the angel investors DEMO graduate degrees. Entrepreneurial experience appears to be the
norm in angel investing (a specific percentage was not provided in Wiltbank and Boeker's study, but 22% had never worked in a
corporation).
4.2. Measures
4.2.1. Evaluations of funding potential
Angels evaluated the funding potential of a new DEMO at the end of the entrepreneur's presentation by indicating whether
the entrepreneur should proceed to due diligence using a single item measure with DEMO five-point Likert scale (1 = disagree,
2 = partially disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = partially agree, 5 = agree).
DEMO Perceived passion
Using a 5 point Likert type scale, angel investors DEMO the passion and the enthusiasm demonstrated by the entrepreneur
at the time of their presentation with two items, “The CEO is passionate about the company” and “The CEO is very enthusiastic.”
These items were correlated .783 (pb .001) justifying averaging these items to determine a single measure of perceived passion.
4.2.3. Individual characteristics
Social perception (Baron and Markman, 2003) was measured using the following items: “I'm a good judge of other people”, “I
can usually recognize others traits accurately by observing their behavior”, “I can usually read others well and tell how they are
feeling in a given situation”, “I can tell why people have acted the way they have in most situations”, and “I generally know when
it is the right time to ask someone for a favor.” Respondents DEMO a five-point Likert scale (1 = disagree, 5 = agree) DEMO all items
and we calculated the mean of these items. Our alpha of .731 is comparable to Baron and Markman's results across two DEMO
(.77 and .83).
We measured cognitive style using the cognitive DEMO index developed by Allinson and Hayes (1996). Angels responded to DEMO
items using a trichotomous response scale ranging from 0 to 2 (DEMO). A sample of the items used include: “In my
experience, rational thought is the only realistic basis for making decisions”, “I am more at home with ideas rather than facts and
figures”, and “I find that ‘too much analysis results in paralysis’.” The last two items DEMO reverse coded. A high score indicates a
more analytical and less intuitive cognitive style. Our alpha of .885 falls in the range achieved by DEMO and Hayes (.84–.92).
Personality of the angel was measured using DEMO Big Five Personality Instrument (Saucier, 1994). This scale uses forty unipolar
adjective markers of the big-five factor structure — conscientiousness, extraversion, DEMO, neuroticism, and openness de-
veloped by Saucier (1994). We DEMO the measures of extraversion and openness from that instrument. Some of the words
598 C. Mitteness et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 27 (2012) 592–606
pertaining to extraversion include energetic, talkative, bashful (reverse coded), and quiet (reverse coded), whereas the words
creative, deep, DEMO philosophical, among others, were coded as openness. The endpoints of this scale indicate “very inaccurate”
(1) and “very accurate” (5). Our reliabilities (extraversion alpha = .875 and openness = .818) are comparable DEMO Saucier's reliabilities
which ranged from .67 to .87.
The regulatory focus measurement consisted of an 18-item scale developed by Lockwood et al. (2002). This scale was developed to
measure the extent to which individuals DEMO on the two subscales of promotion and prevention focus theorized by Higgins (1997).
We amended some of the items to pertain to the investing context instead of the academic context used in the original scale. DEMO sample
of items include: “In general, I am focused on preventing negative events in my life” and “I frequently imagine how I will DEMO my
hopes and aspirations ”. An example of the items amended include: original “I often worry that I will fail to accomplish my academic
goals” and the new “I often worry that I will fail to DEMO my goals”. The endpoints of this scale are “not at all true of me” (1) and
“very true of me” (5). We calculated a measure for strength of promotion focus and a measure for DEMO of prevention focus by
averaging the items belonging to each of these subscales. We were able to achieve alphas close to Lockwood and colleagues' .82
for their promotion focus scale and .75 for their prevention focus DEMO (our alpha = .732 for promotion and .855 for prevention).
DEMO calculated the degree to which someone is more promotion focused than prevention focused by subtracting the prevention
score from the promotion score. Therefore positive DEMO on this scale reflect a greater promotion focus than prevention focus.
Angels indicated their motivation for becoming a member of the angel organization by DEMO 100% among five categories.
The categories consisted of “to make money”, DEMO educate yourself about investing”, “to interact with entrepreneurs and other angels”,DEMO
“to mentor entrepreneurs”,and “to help build or create startup companies”. For this study we focused only on the responses regarding
motivation “to mentor DEMO because this was the only motivation category expected to moderate the relationship between
perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential. The value for this DEMO represents the allocation of 100% angels made spe-
cific to the motivation to mentor entrepreneurs category, which ranged from 0 to 40% (the DEMO was 11.93). We also collected de-
mographic data, including the DEMO's age (in years).
4.2.4. Control variables
Evaluations of funding DEMO may depend on the strength of the opportunity, the strength of DEMO entrepreneur, as well as
the education and startup experience of the DEMO investor, so we controlled for these variables in our analysis.3 Opportunity
DEMO was determined by averaging the responses of all angels attending the screening. Angels used a 5 point agree–disagree
Likert scale to rate the strength DEMO the opportunity using six items: “the business model is strong,”“the DEMO has a large growth
potential,”“the product/service development risk is low,”“the company's revenue potential is large,”“the company has a reason-
DEMO exit plan,” and “there are reasonable barriers to entry.” The Cronbach alpha for this variable was .762. Entrepreneur strength
was determined by averaging DEMO responses to 5 items: “the domain expertise of the presenter is DEMO,”“the presenter has a
proven track record,”“the presenter appears trustworthy,”“the presenter appears honest,” and “the presenter appears coach-
able.” The Cronbach DEMO for this variable was .821. Education was coded as 1 if no high school had been completed, 2 if the
angel completed high school, 3 if a bachelor's degree was completed, 4 if a DEMO degree was completed, and 5 if the angel
had obtained a DEMO We used a dichotomous variable for startup experience with a 1 indicating an angel that has started a
new venture and 0 if the DEMO has not started a new venture.
4.3. Results
Table 1 provides means, standard deviations and correlations for all variables. Fairly low correlations among the independent
variables indicate multicollinearity was not an issue. In order to examine DEMO direct relationship between perceived passion and
evaluations of funding potential and how individual characteristics moderate this relationship, we applied a multilevel (i.e.
mixed-model) approach to data analysis. This approach accounts for the nested nature of DEMO data — multiple evaluations nested
within each angel, nested within each DEMO screening. We had three levels of random variation: variation among decisions
DEMO angels (level 1), variation among angels within company screenings (level 2), and variation among company screenings
(level 3). We estimated the unconditional model (with no predictors involved) and found significant level DEMO and level 3 variances
which confirmed that the multilevel approach was the correct data analysis technique to use (see Table 2).
We grand-mean-centered all of the individual characteristics and used − 2 log likelihood (− 2LL) to assess model fit. The
smaller the − 2LL value, DEMO better the model fit (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2006). To assess the significance of the change in
− 2LL from one model to DEMO next we performed a series of chi-square tests with the degrees of freedom equal to the difference
in the number of parameters for the DEMO of nested models (Bryk and Raudenbush, 1992). Table 2 shows that the addition of variables
in each model significantly improved the fit DEMO the model. To test for interaction effects, control variables were entered DEMO the model
first, followed by the two-way interaction terms to create DEMO full model (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). The significant interactions were
plotted to further explore their exact nature. Following the procedure suggested by DEMO and Cohen (1983), values of individual
characteristics and perceived passion DEMO set at 1 standard deviation above and below the mean to determine the range of values
for the dependent variable.
The control variable model DEMO Table 2 shows that the strength of opportunity and strength of entrepreneur were significant
(b = 1.074 and b = .365, pb .001 DEMO). This is consistent with previous research showing that criterion related to the
3 Gender may also impact evaluations of funding potential; however due to the focal angel organization being predominately male, we were not able to include
gender in our analysis.

market potential of the opportunity and competence of the entrepreneur are important when investors are DEMO the fund-
ing potential of new ventures (e.g., Hall and Hofer, 1993; MacMillan et al., 1987; Van Osnabrugge, 1998). Although research has
linked prior startup experience (e.g., Wiltbank et al., 2009) and education (Haines et al., 2003) with angel decision making, we did
not find evidence that they impact evaluations of funding potential DEMO our study (b = .025 and b =−.101, p > .05 respectively).
H1 states that perceived passion will be positively related to DEMO of funding potential.
Results presented in the predictor model indicate support for this hypothesis (b = .141, pb .001). This is an DEMO finding
because recent research has concluded that passion is not important (DEMO et al., 2009). Although Chen et al. (2009) call DEMO
measure passion, we argue it is more specifically displayed passion (presenter varies tone and pitch of their voice, for example),
not DEMO passion as assessed by investors. This distinction may be why we find support for perceived passion leading to
higher evaluations of funding potential but DEMO researchers use displayed passion they do not (Chen et al., 2009). We therefore
provide evidence supporting the argument that it is important DEMO distinguish perceived passion from displayed passion.
Support for the remaining hypotheses would be found if the individual characteristic strengthened (with the exception of cog-
nitive style which would weaken) the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential. Results indi-
cate six significant interaction terms (see Full Model in Table 2). We did not find support for hypothesis DEMO regarding the
moderating effect of social perception (b =−.048, p > .05). Hypothesis H3 proposed that cognitive style would weaken the rela-
DEMO between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential. Support for this hypothesis was found due to the sig-
nificant negative interaction term (b =−.005, pb .01). As illustrated in Fig. 1a, perceived passion is DEMO related to
evaluations of funding potential, especially for intuitive angels (low cognitive style).
Extraversion (H4) was hypothesized to positively moderate the DEMO between perceived passion and evaluations of
funding potential. However, our results DEMO a negative moderating effect instead (b =−.098, pb .01). Fig. 1b shows that
the relationship is stronger for angels with low extraversion DEMO those with high extraversion. To test this interpretation of
the surprise finding, we followed procedures for testing simple slopes in multilevel models (Bauer DEMO Curran, 2005; Preacher
et al., 2006). We tested the DEMO slopes of low extraversion (one standard deviation below the mean) and high extraversion
(one standard deviation above the mean). The relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential
was stronger when extraversion was DEMO (γ = .22, s.e. = .04, t = 5.82, p = .000) than when extraversion was high (γ = .08,
DEMO = .04, t = 2.28, p = .0234). Thus H4 was not supported.

As hypothesized in H5 and illustrated in Fig. 1c, openness positively moderates the relationship between perceived passion
and evaluations of funding potential (b = .104, pb .01). The slope is steeper for angels high in openness than those low in open-
ness, suggesting that the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential is stronger for DEMO high
in openness than for angels low in openness.
Hypothesis H6 suggested that the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential would DEMO
stronger for angels with promotion dominated regulatory focus than angels with regulatory focus dominated by prevention
focus. Surprisingly, results indicate a negative moderating effect (b =−.056, pb .05). Fig. 1d shows that relationship between

perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential was stronger for angels with prevention dominated regulatory focus
(γ = .21, s.e. = .04, t = 5.75, p = .000) than for angels with promotion DEMO regulatory focus (γ = .10, s.e. = .03, t = DEMO,
p = .005).
We hypothesized that motivation to mentor (DEMO) would have a positive moderating effect on the relationship between per-
DEMO passion and evaluations of funding potential, which was supported (b = .005, pb .05). As illustrated in Fig. 1e, perceived
passion DEMO to higher evaluations of funding potential, especially for angels with a DEMO motivation to mentor. Angels with a
high motivation to mentor are especially critical of entrepreneurs they perceive as being low in passion. Finally, support was
found for H8, that age would positively moderate the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding poten-
tial (b = .006, DEMO .001). Fig. 1f indicates that age does not seem to matter when entrepreneurs are perceived as being low in pas-
sion; however, DEMO angels have higher evaluations of funding potential than younger angels when they perceive high levels of
passion.
5. Discussion and implications
Researchers have argued DEMO passion is a critical component of entrepreneurship (e.g., Bird, 1989; Cardon et al., 2009c), and
an important part of angel investing (Cardon et al., 2009b; Sudek, 2006), although conflicting results DEMO have been found (Chen
et al., 2009). We add to this literature by clarifying the distinctions between the passion that is experienced DEMO displayed by en-
trepreneurs and passion that is perceived by others, DEMO suggesting that perceived passion involves enthusiasm and excitement,
and is distinct from how prepared or committed an entrepreneur may be to their venture. DEMO on this distinction, we provide
evidence of a significant relationship between DEMO passion and evaluations of funding potential for angel investors consid-
ering live deals, as well as an empirical assessment of the individual characteristics of angel investors that impact the relationship
between perceived passion and evaluations of DEMO potential. There are several academic and practical implications of our
findings.
5.1. Research implications
First, our findings provide some evidence that perceived passion does make a difference when angels evaluate the funding po-
tential of new DEMO This finding is in direct contrast to the conclusions drawn by Chen et al. (2009: 201) who found in their
studies that preparedness (defined as a cognitive manifestation of passion, such that “I can'DEMO stop thinking about the business ven-
ture idea”) mattered to potential DEMO rather than passion (an affective manifestation of passion). There are DEMO number of po-
tential reasons for the apparent contradiction. First, we DEMO on passion as perceived by angel investors, rather than by
representatives DEMO “VC firms, banks, and financial companies” (Chen et al., 2009: 208), which as we note above may have
very different motivations and evaluations of potential investments. Secondly, our investors were specifically angel investors
evaluating live deals that had the potential for them to invest their DEMO money. In contrast, the Chen investors were making evalua-
tions for DEMO business plan competition, where they did not have a personal financial DEMO in the outcome. And third, rather than
evaluating preparedness in terms DEMO the presentation itself, as Chen and colleagues did, we included investor evaluations of the
quality of the idea and quality of the entrepreneur, regardless of the presentation, as control variables. We believe our study is a
more robust and direct test of the impact of perceived passion DEMO angel investor decision-making.
The implication of these findings is that perceived passion does appear to matter to equity investors, at least to angel investors,
in addition to evaluations of the quality of the opportunity and DEMO of the entrepreneur in terms of their experience or confi-
dence. Future research on passion and investment is needed that explores how different investment DEMO (VCs, government
grant agencies, independent angel investors, for example) DEMO passion in their decision-making processes, not only in
terms of whether DEMO not it matters, but also in terms of where in the DEMO process it is considered more relevant. We could
also consider how investors balance their assessments of perceived passion with assessments of the quality of DEMO opportunity
or entrepreneur during this process. For example, prior work suggests DEMO the focus on the strength of the entrepreneur versus
the opportunity varies depending on the stage in the funding process (Sudek et al., DEMO). Longitudinal research is needed to ex-
plore how perceived passion impacts various stages of the funding decision process, as well as how this might differ for different
types of investors.
Future research is also needed DEMO determine whether investor assessments of perceived passion are accurate or not. Are angel
investors really astute observers, able to tell which entrepreneurs are more passionate than others? Does skill in delivering the
business plan presentation, DEMO as making eye contact or varying one's tone and pitch indicate an entrepreneur who feels
more passion or just an entrepreneur more skilled DEMO making presentations or engaging in emotional labor? Research is needed
that DEMO the passion experienced by entrepreneurs, the facial and body expressions they DEMO in their presentations, and
the passion investors perceived to determine the DEMO to which these factors are correlated.
Our results also have implications for research on entrepreneur–investor relationships (e.g., Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Hisrich
DEMO Jancowicz, 1990) because we provide a perspective on differences in the extent to which perceived passion matters within
the angel investment group. We DEMO how individual characteristics of angel investors influence the cues they attend to
when evaluating the funding potential of a new venture, and in particular, we find that perceived passion is a stronger positive
predictor of evaluations of funding potential for angel investors that are older, have an intuitive cognitive style, score high in
openness, and for those that have DEMO high motivation to mentor. These findings suggest while broad generalizations about what
angel investors find important in their evaluations of funding potential are insightful, there is also a different story to be told.

There appear to be differences among angel investors in terms of how strongly perceived passion impacts their evaluations of
funding potential based on DEMO unique individual characteristics.
We found some surprising results when examining the moderating effect of both extraversion and regulatory focus on the re-
lationship between DEMO passion and evaluations of funding potential. We anticipated that extraversion would enhance the
relationship between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential since extraverts DEMO to react to stimuli with higher
activation levels. Instead our results indicated a mitigating effect where the relationship was stronger for angels low in DEMO
than for those high in extraversion. One possible explanation for this finding is that angel investors who are extraverted typically dis-
play a lot DEMO enthusiasm and excitement about most things in their lives due to their extraverted personalities, and therefore may be
more careful in their assessments of the extent to which entrepreneurs are truly passionate about this particular venture DEMO being
enthusiastic in general. Extraverted angels may also want to invest in entrepreneurs who balance out their own extraversion by being
more reserved or DEMO less enthusiastic and passionate. Alternatively, these angels may see extraverted entrepreneurs DEMO are
displaying a lot of passion when it appears to be unwarranted as insincere, judging the entrepreneur as trying too hard.4 In addition,
while extraverts typically seek assertiveness, activity, and excitement in their own DEMO, they also experience more variability in
their affect than individuals who DEMO low in extraversion (Hepburn and Eysenck, 1989). This suggests that further research is needed
on the relationships between extraversion, affective reactivity, DEMO perceived passion in the angel investment context.
We were also surprised to find a negative moderating effect for regulatory focus. Angels with a prevention DEMO regu-
latory focus are more sensitive to the presence or absence of negative outcomes (Higgins, 1997). Due to the expected positive re-
DEMO between perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential, entrepreneurs lacking passion DEMO be considered as
the presence of something negative. Therefore, as is DEMO in Fig. 1d, angels with prevention dominated regulatory focus
would be DEMO critical of entrepreneurs they perceive as low in passion. In addition, DEMO have found that promotion focus elevates
feelings of certainty (Kluger et DEMO, 2004), suggesting that individuals with prevention dominated regulatory focus are DEMO to per-
ceive more risk than individuals with promotion dominated regulatory focus. This increased perception of risk may make passion
even more important to DEMO Further research is needed on how extraversion and regulatory focus impact perceptions of passion,
as well as evaluations of funding potential for angels.
DEMO also contribute to the literature on affect. Angel investing represents an interesting context to examine perceptions of af-
fect because affect has a greater DEMO on cognition in environments that are highly unpredictable and filled with rapid change,
which is quite true of entrepreneurship (Baron, 2008; Forgas, 1995). Our results support the perspective that affective percep-
tions direct and drive decisions (Peters et al., 2004). These findings suggest DEMO the affective-decision process differs not only
based on characteristics of entrepreneurs exhibiting that affect, but also based on the characteristics of angel investors perceiving
and reacting to it. Future research can further examine why the affective DEMO gathered impacts decisions, whether
through processes of lowering risk perceptions (e.g., Peters et al., 2004), or through the use of an DEMO heuristic” (Slovic et
al., 2002), where people base their judgments not only on what they think but also on how they feel. DEMO literature suggests
that when the judgment is positive, risks are seen DEMO low and benefits high, and when the judgment is negative, risks are seen
as high and benefits low. Empirical research is needed to DEMO if this prediction is borne out in the angel investment decision-
making context.
5.2. Limitations
The most important limitation of this study derives from DEMO research design based on one angel group, which raises questions
regarding DEMO similar results would be obtained utilizing a different angel group. Organization characteristics such as size,
age, industry focus, or those with more DEMO angel investors may impact the funding screening process. One of the principle
objectives of this research was to advance the development of angel investing DEMO Therefore, the decision was made to
first focus on gaining an DEMO understanding of one angel group, leaving open the possibility to replicate DEMO research in ad-
ditional angel groups in the future.
In addition, DEMO researchers may consider the fact that we focused on perceived passion (DEMO affective manifestation of pas-
sion) as a limitation since the experience DEMO passion may manifest itself affectively, cognitively, and behaviorally (Chen et DEMO,
2009). Again we focused on the most readily visible manifestation of passion, the enthusiasm displayed by an entrepreneur,
and how angels perceive this enthusiasm. We acknowledge that future research should also consider how DEMO perceive and
weigh in their investment decisions cognitive and behavioral manifestations of passion that entrepreneur may demonstrate,
and whether and how the relationship DEMO these types of perceived passion and evaluations of funding potential are impact-
ed by angel characteristics.
5.3. Practical implications
The results of this study DEMO there are practical implications for both entrepreneurs and angel investors with regard to the
funding decision process. Entrepreneurs should consider how individual characteristics of DEMO may impact their ability to
get funding. Entrepreneurs who shy away from enthusiastic displays may want to consider how to express more energy and
DEMO body language when presenting their venture so that they are perceived as more passionate, especially for older,

introverted angels who appear creative and intellectual (i.e. who have DEMO openness) and who are motivated to mentor but don't
appear DEMO analytical. Although determining the age of an angel is easier than determining whether they are introverted, creative
or intelligent, entrepreneurs can likely infer DEMO individual characteristics by the questions the angels ask, how the angels DEMO
act with each other, and the angels' past career choices. In addition, entrepreneurs may find it helpful to ask questions about the
makeup of an angel group in advance of the presentation or ask questions DEMO the presentation that may provide cues to help
the entrepreneur understand the characteristics of the angels. This information could be used to adapt their DEMO and
style.
In addition, angels should become more aware of how DEMO characteristics may impact their evaluations of funding potential.
This study suggests that angels that belong to angel groups may want to profile their members DEMO attempt to create more heteroge-
neous screening groups when evaluating investment opportunities. Some angels groups screen with small initial committees (1–3
angels), before they have the entrepreneur present to the broader membership. The composition of DEMO initial committee could im-
pact the deals that eventually make it to the group. In addition, angels are motivated to invest for different reasons. This study shows
that motivation may impact how angels evaluate opportunities. Becoming DEMO aware of their motivation to invest and how their
characteristics may impact their investment decisions may lead some angels to strive to be more DEMO or seek input regarding
a specific company from other angels who have different individual characteristics.
Altogether, this study reminds us that the interaction between entrepreneurs and angels is not just about the objective com-
ponents of DEMO business and return on investment, but rather how characteristics of each DEMO play into the evaluation of funding
potential. The interaction and relationship that starts to develop in the screening process appears to impact entrepreneurs' ability
to get funding, and our results suggest that perceived passion is an important part of this interaction.
6. Executive summary
Researchers have argued that DEMO is a critical component of entrepreneurship and an important part of angel investing.
However, recent work suggests that the certain manifestations of passion are not important. Research in this area is in its infancy,
and DEMO is known about whether a relationship between passion and evaluations of funding potential exists or whether certain
individual characteristics of angel investors make them DEMO or less likely to consider passion when evaluating entrepreneurs
and their firms. We use literature on affective reactivity to explore which individual characteristics of DEMO investors are expected
to impact their ability to process affective cues and translate stimuli (i.e. displayed passion) into an affective frame of reference DEMO
ultimately influence the weight that affective stimuli (perceived passion) exhibits in their evaluations of funding potential. We
test our hypotheses with a sample DEMO 64 angel investor evaluating 241 real entrepreneurial pitches over an almost four year pe-
riod for a total of 3502 evaluations.
Our findings provide DEMO that perceived passion does make a difference when angels evaluate the funding potential of
new ventures. This finding is in direct contrast to the DEMO drawn by Chen et al. (2009: 201) who found in DEMO studies
that preparedness (a cognitive manifestation of passion) mattered to potential investors rather than passion (an affective mani-
festation of passion). Below we explain why we believe our study is a more robust and DEMO test of the impact of perceived pas-
sion on angel investor decision-making. The results also indicate that the relationship between perceived passion and evaluations
DEMO funding potential are stronger for angel investors who are older, more DEMO, have a high openness personality, or those who
are motivated to mentor. Surprisingly, the relationship weakens for angels who are extraverted and those who have a promotion-
dominated regulatory focus. We offer some possible explanations DEMO these surprise findings in our discussion section.
Our study add to the growing body of research regarding entrepreneurial passion by clarifying the distinctions between DEMO
passion that is experienced and displayed by entrepreneurs and the passion that is perceived by others. We argue that perceived
passion involves enthusiasm and DEMO, and is distinct from how prepared or committed an entrepreneur may DEMO to their
venture. Building on this distinction, we provide evidence of DEMO significant relationship between perceived passion and evaluations
of funding potential for angel investors considering live deals, as well as an empirical assessment of the individual characteristics
of angel investors that impact the relationship between perceived passion DEMO evaluations of funding potential. The implication of
these findings is that perceived passion does appear to matter to equity investors, at least to angel investors, when controlling for
the quality of the opportunity and quality of the entrepreneur.
Our results also have implications for research on entrepreneur–investor relationships, which tends to focus on the entrepre-
neur's interpersonal style, skills, and social competence to explain the “investor fit”. We provide empirical evidence that evalua-
tions of funding potential depend not only on the attributes DEMO the person being judged (i.e. the entrepreneur) but also on the
attributes of the person making the judgment (i.e. the angel). These findings suggest that while broad generalizations about
what angel investors find important DEMO their evaluations of funding potential are insightful, there is also a DEMO story to be
told. There appear to be differences among angel investors in terms of how strongly perceived passion impacts their evaluations
of funding DEMO based on their unique individual characteristics.
The results of this study suggest there are practical implications for both entrepreneurs and angel investors with regard DEMO the
funding decision process. Entrepreneurs should consider how individual characteristics of investors may impact their ability to
get funding. Entrepreneurs may find it helpful DEMO ask questions about the makeup of an angel group in advance of the presentation
or ask questions during the presentation that may provide cues DEMO help the entrepreneur understand the characteristics of the an-
gels. From the angel perspective, our results suggest that angels should become more aware of how their characteristics may im-
pact their evaluations of funding potential. This DEMO suggests that angels that belong to angel groups may want to profile their
members and attempt to create more heterogeneous screening groups when evaluating DEMO opportunities. Becoming

more aware of how their characteristics may impact their investment decisions may lead some angels to strive to be more objec-
tive and DEMO input from other angels who have different individual characteristics.
