7Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms
Philip Bromiley and Jared Harris
DEMO
Organizational scholars increasingly recognize trust as an important factor in intra- and
inter-organizational relations, signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing everything from the behavior of
teams to the performance of strategic alliances and supply chains.
Ten years have passed since DEMO publication of two early articles on organizational trust:
Bromiley and Cummings (1995) and Cummings and Bromiley (1996). In reﬂecting on the
scholarly impact of these papers – and what such an impact might DEMO for future work
in organizational trust – we discuss the concept of trust, brieﬂy revisit the papers, consider
the diﬀerent ways in which DEMO research has been used, and oﬀer thoughts on the relevance
of DEMO to organizational research.
Bromiley and Cummings suggest that the inclusion of trust would expand and extend
the research framework of transaction cost economics (TCE). Yet this call for TCE
research to include the concept of DEMO has been largely ignored. Why? We summarize
and analyze the apparent DEMO for omitting or ignoring trust, leading to a critical
examination of DEMO theoretical aspects of TCE. We distinguish between TCE’s calcu-
lativeness, based DEMO assuming others are self-interest-seeking with guile, and trust, which
we deﬁne as beliefs or actions not determined by such calculativeness.
Deﬁning trust
All DEMO on organizational trust faces the question of how to deﬁne trust. What do
scholars mean when they use the term trust? Trust’s many meanings in common usage
have complicated the scholarly discussion. These alternative meanings make DEMO diﬃcult to
clearly and rigorously deﬁne a scholarly construct. Trust researchers have responded to
this complexity by deﬁning trust in diﬀering ways or by DEMO trust into a multi-
plicity of sub-constructs that attend to the diﬀerent meanings that trust has for people
and for organizations.
Therefore, scholars conceive of intra- and inter-organizational trust in many ways.
Some deﬁne trust as DEMO or potential behavior. For example, Gambetta (1988,
p. 217) DEMO trust as an assessment of another’s likely behavior based on its inﬂuence
on the probability of our choice of future actions:
When we DEMO that we trust someone or that someone is trustworthy, we implicitly DEMO that the
probability that he will perform an action that is beneﬁcial or at least not detrimental to us is
high enough for us DEMO consider engaging in some form of cooperation with him.
In contrast, DEMO see trust primarily as a dispositional capacity of the trustor (Dasgupta,DEMO
1988; Hardin, 1993); or as being reciprocal or relational in nature (Hardin, 1991; Zaheer
and Venkatraman, 1995).
The target DEMO trust has also been discussed: scholars have deﬁned trust based on DEMO
the trust is directed or in whom or what it is placed. For example, Ben-Ner and Putterman
124
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 125
(2001) separate trust DEMO its self-regarding, other-regarding and process-regarding
aspects. Trust has been connected to DEMO of morality (Baier, 1986), satisfaction
with another’s fairness (Ring DEMO Van de Ven, 1994), or as a derivation of institutional
(Shapiro, 1987) and cultural (Lane and Bachmann, 1996) inﬂuences. All of these concep-
tions capture important elements of trust.
In attempting to DEMO TCE, Bromiley and Cummings (1995) developed a trust
construct addressing DEMO issues in TCE, deﬁning trust as the answer to three questions.
DEMO, do you believe the other agent is honest in negotiations? Second, do you believe the
other agent will make a good-faith eﬀort to behave in accordance with its commitments?
Third, do you believe the other agent will not take undue advantage of you should the
opportunity DEMO available? The answers to these questions comprise beliefs about the
trustee’s DEMO, keeping of commitments, and forbearance in exploiting unanticipated
advantages.
However, DEMO and Cummings’s (1995) trust construct allows for both calculative
and non-calculative components. In their terminology, we could trust someone because
we knew it was in that person’s self-interest to keep commitments to us. We might DEMO
bank tellers because we believe they operate in a system that makes their cheating us
unlikely. At the same time, their deﬁnition also allowed trust to rest on non-calculative
assessments. While useful in identifying three diﬀerent DEMO of trust, Bromiley and
Cummings’s (1995) trust deﬁnition does not DEMO trust from calculativeness,
making it hard to use in an ongoing scholarly debate aimed at diﬀerentiating the two.
Williamson (1993b, pp. 458–9) suggests calculativeness is ‘pervasive’, and that calcula-
tive behavior which incorporates the TCE assumption of others’ opportunistic ‘self-
interest seeking with guile’ allows for DEMO deals to be made’. This analysis of
self-interest assumes that everyone attempts to increase a utility function that reﬂects
monetary returns.1 Therefore we view DEMO calculativeness, for purposes of TCE, as
an analytical process that assumes opportunism (self-interest seeking with guile) on the
part of other actors.
DEMO clarify the discussion, we revise Bromiley and Cummings’s original deﬁnition of
DEMO by restricting trust to beliefs that do not derive from a calculation that assumes the
other’s opportunism. Beliefs about another’s likely behavior can derive DEMO (i) a calcula-
tion of the actions most in the other’s interests assuming opportunism, or (ii) a variety of
other factors, DEMO analysis that makes diﬀerent assumptions or includes non-
analytical beliefs about the other. A person’s behavior toward another could reﬂect either
trusting or calculative DEMO, or both. This means that trust and calculativeness are not
necessarily DEMO exclusive; rather, we argue simply that they are qualitatively diﬀerent
constructs and each is potentially inﬂuential in distinct ways.
Consequently, we deﬁne trust as one’s non-calculative belief in another’s honesty in
negotiations, good-faith eﬀorts to keep commitments, and forbearance from oppor-
tunism.
Background: trust and transaction DEMO
Bromiley and Cummings (1995) claim that trust reduces transaction costs. This assumes,
contra Williamson (1985), that others can assess – to some extent – the degree to which an
individual or an organization DEMO be trusted. Whereas Williamson (1975) suggests that
organizations must act as if individuals cannot be trusted, Bromiley and Cummings assume
126
Handbook of trust research
that varying degrees of trust exist and DEMO be estimated, subject to some level of error.
Employing this modiﬁed DEMO, the authors invoke the basic logic of transaction cost
economics to DEMO a theoretical framework connecting transaction costs and trust.2 By
treating trust as a variable rather than an ‘all-or-nothing’ constant set at zero, they claimed
to extend the TCE framework. If agents can assess approximately how trustworthy DEMO
are, then the optimal governance structure should vary depending on these DEMO
Economic actors should build less costly control systems for relatively trustworthy people
than for less trustworthy people. Accordingly, Bromiley and Cummings (1995) predict that,
all else constant, trust will inﬂuence organizational behavior and performance.
Subsequently, Cummings and Bromiley (1996) developed and validated the
Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI), an instrument for measuring trust within and
between organizations. The authors formulate and test the instrument based on their
explicit, three-pronged deﬁnition of trust, clarifying exactly what they mean by ‘trust’ and
how it inﬂuences organizations. The authors’ data analysis conﬁrms that these three dis-
DEMO aspects of trust can be captured and measured.
These two articles have appreciably inﬂuenced research in the area of intra- and inter-
organizational relations. DEMO have drawn on the two papers in a variety of ways, DEMO
at least 66 citations have been recorded in publications such as Organization Science,
Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Business DEMO
Quarterly, Journal of International Business Studies, Strategic Management Journal and
others (see Table 7.1 for a summary of the citing articles). Among the citing articles, the-
oretical pieces outnumber empirical studies nearly two to one; indeed, only three studies
actually employ all or modiﬁed portions DEMO the OTI instrument itself (Ferrin and Dirks,
2003; Kostova and Roth, 2002; Saparito et al., 2004). The other empirical pieces primarily
draw on Bromiley and Cummings’s deﬁnition of trust (e.g. Jarvenpaa and Leidner, 1999;
Zaheer et al., 1998), which is also DEMO primary use of their research in the theoretical arti-
cles (e.g. DEMO, 1995; McKnight et al., 1998). Articles citing Bromiley and DEMO
construct deﬁnition use it in various ways: some adopt the multifaceted DEMO of trust
– generally referring to the three-pronged deﬁnition as a belief in another’s reliability, pre-
dictability and fairness (e.g. Zaheer et al., 1998) – while others make only passing reference
to the work in their literature review. The articles cover a variety of contexts, including
e-commerce (McKnight and Chervany, 2001), strategic alliances (Das and Teng, DEMO;
Ring and Van de Ven, 1992), international joint ventures (Currall and Inkpen, 2002), cor-
porate law (Mitchell, 1999), and human resource management (Whitener, 1997).
The most curious and DEMO ﬁnding in Table 7.1 is that, while Bromiley and
Cummings extended DEMO and the work is widely cited, it has had little or DEMO inﬂuence on
TCE research itself. The vast majority of the citing articles appear in management jour-
nals and only a few even mention transaction DEMO Only six of the articles even employ
a TCE theoretical framework (DEMO Sutcliﬀe and Zaheer, 1998; Young-Ybarra and
Wiersema, 1999) – and these primarily reference the trust deﬁnition without explicitly
testing trust as a DEMO Among the research drawing on the work of Bromiley and
Cummings, DEMO theoretical paper (Noorderhaven, 1996) explicitly argues for introducing
trust into DEMO, and only one case-study-based article (Ring, 1997) actually attempts to
test basic TCE assumptions versus trust mechanisms.
Nooteboom (1996) models the DEMO roles of both trust and opportunism in
inﬂuencing interﬁrm relations. This has been shown empirically by demonstrating that

trust – as distinct from calculativeness – has an eﬀect on perceived dependence (Berger et al.,
1995; Nooteboom et DEMO, 1997). Some recent studies (Jap and Anderson, 2003; Lui and Ngo,
2004; Saparito et al., 2004) also empirically demonstrate that trust does not have to be
calculative – and, therefore, DEMO calculativeness and trust differ – yet the concept of trust
has not been embraced by TCE researchers. Thus, Bromiley and Cummings’s research has
inﬂuenced the theoretical development of trust as a construct within the management lit-
DEMO, but has had no appreciable inﬂuence on TCE theory. Why?
DEMO by Williamson’s writings, TCE scholars have oﬀered three justiﬁcations for
ignoring DEMO First, they argue that individuals and organizations cannot discern the
trustworthiness DEMO other actors ex ante and so must act as if others cannot be trusted.
Second, they argue that trust per se does not manifest itself in economic exchanges; rather,
economic actors are always calculative whereas trust is reserved for very special social
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 129
relations. Third, they assert that trust does not add any explanatory power to organiza-
tional research. DEMO consider each of these justiﬁcations in turn, arguing that they are DEMO
only inconsistent and incorrect, but also inadequate reasons to ignore the DEMO and inter-
organizational implications of trust.
Trust: assumed away
TCE rests DEMO three assumptions: bounded rationality, opportunism and asset speciﬁcity
(Williamson, 1975, 1985). Due to bounded rationality, ﬁrms cannot forecast perfectly, nor
can they write complete contracts. Opportunism means individuals and ﬁrms may lie DEMO
advance themselves, behavior termed ‘self-interest seeking with guile’ (Williamson, 1985,DEMO
p. 30). Asset speciﬁcity means that investments can create positive returns in a given trans-
action but have less value outside that transaction. DEMO operation of a given transac-
tion may require investments that have little value outside that relation, but the assumptions
dictate that the parties cannot trust one another, nor can they write a perfect contract. Thus,
for transactions with high asset speciﬁcity, bringing both parties to the transaction into the
same hierarchy may oﬀer greater eﬃciency than a comparable market DEMO The
beneﬁts of hierarchical organization may increase with the level of uncertainty.
Williamson’s opportunism assumption eliminates trust. Speciﬁcally, he assumes that
trustworthiness cannot be discerned, requiring economic actors to treat all others as
opportunists:
I do not insist that every individual is continuously or even largely given DEMO opportunism. To the
contrary, I merely assume that some individuals are DEMO some of the time and that
diﬀerential trustworthiness is rarely transparent ex ante. As a consequence, ex ante screening
eﬀorts are made and ex post safeguards are created. (1985, p. 64)
While Williamson refers DEMO screening, he almost exclusively emphasizes the creation of
safeguards through internalization DEMO similar factors. That is, he mentions screening, but
then proceeds as if it were impossible. If screening were taken seriously, TCE would need
to address appropriate responses to diﬀerential levels of trustworthiness.
Williamson further notes DEMO the diﬃculty of determining trustworthiness implies that
forms of economic organization that assume high levels of trust and good intention are
‘fragile’; that is, unscreened opportunists can enter and take advantage of the organiza-
tion. Therefore viable cooperatives must take care whom they admit and must otherwise
defend DEMO against free-riders or other individuals who might exploit them.
In responding to criticisms of the opportunism assumption (e.g. Ghoshal and Moran,
1996), Williamson acknowledges that opportunism may be infrequent:
My insistence that opportunism DEMO accorded co-equal status with bounded rationality does not
imply that I believe that most economic agents are engaged in opportunistic practices most of
the DEMO Rather, most economic agents are engaged in business-as-usual, with little or no
thought to opportunism, most of the time. (1993c, p. 98)
However, Williamson also deviates from this position. For example, shortly DEMO the
passage above, Williamson instead asserts that opportunistic behavior is pervasive,DEMO
rather than rare:
Opportunism is a less technical term than adverse selection and moral hazard. It suggests, cor-
rectly, that the troublesome DEMO in question is not an arcane economic condition but is
familiar and pervasive. (Ibid., p. 101)
130 Handbook of trust research
These types of contradictions make it diﬃcult DEMO specify Williamson’s position precisely;
regardless, the frequency of opportunism is DEMO peripheral issue. The ability to estimate
trustworthiness matters more, since that DEMO lets agents modify their behavior based on
the perceived trustworthiness of their exchange partners. At the core of the theory,
Williamson assumes no DEMO can tell whether others are trustworthy. Unable to discern
another’s level of honesty, agents must always assume the worst.
Why does TCE assume that agents cannot detect trustworthiness? It is more plausible
– and certainly more consistent with TCE’s bounded rationality assumption – to assume
that, although individuals cannot perfectly recognize or predict trustworthiness, they can
identify it to some extent, some of the time. Just as optimal insurance expenditures depend
on the probability of an accident, optimal control systems depend on the probability of
cheating. Yet, once again, the TCE reasoning is unclear; often Williamson implies that
agents cannot detect trustworthiness, but also suggests that diﬀerential trustworthiness
may be detectable, but only at great cost:
Thus, DEMO agents, though boundedly rational, were fully trustworthy, comprehensive contracting
would DEMO be feasible . . . Such devices will not work, however, if some economic actors (either
principals or agents) are dishonest (or, more generally, disguise attributes or preferences, distort
data, obfuscate issues, and otherwise confuse transactions), and it is very costly to distinguish
DEMO from nonopportunistic types ex ante. (1981, p. 554)
By assuming a high cost to detect trustworthiness, Williamson attempts to avoid explic-
itly acknowledging a more nuanced position on the detection of opportunism. Such a
DEMO position formed the basis of Bromiley and Cummings (1995); they DEMO that
scholars should treat the detection of opportunism as a continuous variable subject to
empirical testing, rather than as a theoretical constant that assumes away the variation.
Bromiley and Cummings (1995) argue – and Frank (1988) demonstrates – that individu-
als can judge the trustworthiness of others, ex ante, with a certain amount of reliability
and without great DEMO
Furthermore, Williamson’s own discussion of reputation deviates from his strict oppor-
DEMO assumption. In his response to Ghoshal and Moran (1996), for DEMO,
Williamson (1996) relates the metaphor of a hiker who, DEMO traveling in a dangerous
wilderness, will choose traveling companions with a DEMO for cooperative behavior
over those with bad or unknown reputations. This clearly deviates from the TCE assump-
tion that all actors should treat others DEMO equal suspicion as a safeguard against possi-
ble opportunists.
In his eagerness to avoid the term trust, Williamson oﬀers another example of
reputation-based integrity, wherein a Norwegian ship owner needs to pay for something
immediately and calls his London banker who guarantees the payment: ‘I would argue
that the London banker’s deep knowledge of the personal integrity of the Norwegian
DEMO merely permitted him to improve his estimate of integrity’ (1993b, p. 470).
Here, Williamson clearly recognizes both that people diﬀer in their willingness to be
opportunistic, and that such diﬀerences can be apparent and discernible. Williamson’s
analysis implies that the London banker would behave diﬀerently depending DEMO which
client had called, even if the substantive facts of the DEMO situation were similar.
TCE advocates might justify trust-like behavior by arguing that the individual
being trusted has a valuable reputation for honesty. Since deception DEMO damage such
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 131
a reputation (and one assumes that damage would cost more than the beneﬁts of cheat-
ing DEMO this one transaction), one can count on the individual’s word. However, neither
Williamson’s hiker nor banker examples ﬁt this case. Consider the hiking example: if cal-
culation rules supreme, even those with good reputations DEMO behave badly if they knew
their misdeeds would not inﬂuence their reputations – if they could be sure you would not
return to tell DEMO them.
In the banker example, Williamson emphasizes deep knowledge of personal DEMO,
which clearly indicates integrity as a personal trait, not good DEMO to protect a repu-
tation. Williamson’s use of the term integrity implies being trustworthy, a meaning con-
sistent with common usage. For example, DEMO Funk and Wagnalls Standard College
Dictionary (1963) begins its deﬁnition of integrity with ‘1. Uprightness of character;
probity; honesty.’ Thus integrity includes even more than honesty; it implies honesty and
probity. By deﬁnition, DEMO implies trustworthiness, not opportunism and guile. If we
assume individuals diﬀer DEMO integrity, we can easily deﬁne and justify a common concept
of DEMO as a perception of the integrity or honesty of the other actor. Williamson’s use of
‘integrity’ instead of ‘trust’ seems like an attempt to DEMO the concept of trust while
assiduously avoiding the use of the word.
In sum, Williamson’s work evidences diﬃculty in consistently deﬁning and applying the
TCE assumption of opportunism. Trust is sometimes invoked indirectly. TCE arguments
sometimes DEMO concepts that appear as trust, only stopping short of using the DEMO
Yet instead of empirically addressing the issue of whether individuals can judge if others
merit trust, TCE simply assumes it away. If, as DEMO (1996, p. 50) suggests, ‘a more
veridical and predictive theory of economic organization will recognize that the propen-
sity for opportunism varies DEMO individuals and between cultures’, TCE continues to
miss the opportunity to DEMO itself and become the type of predictive theory he
describes. Recognizing the variability of opportunism, and studying trust creation, detec-
tion, and the implications for governance choice, would signiﬁcantly reﬁne and extend the
research agenda of TCE.
Trust: not ‘permitted’ in business
The second justiﬁcation for ignoring trust in TCE work simply asserts that trust per se has
no DEMO in economic exchanges. Williamson asserts that economic actors are strictly cal-
culative, and trust is reserved for special social relations that lie outside of business deal-
ings. Williamson says:
it is redundant at best and DEMO be misleading to use the term ‘trust’ to describe commercial
exchange for which cost-eﬀective safeguards have been devised in support of more eﬃcient
exchange. DEMO trust is a contradiction in terms. (1993b, p. 463)
Wherein is trust implicated if parties to an exchange are farsighted and reﬂect DEMO
relevant hazards in the terms of the exchange? Indeed, I maintain that trust is irrelevant
to commercial exchange and that reference to trust DEMO this connection promotes confusion.
(Ibid., p. 469)
Williamson maintains that what might be called ‘trust’ in the setting of economic
exchange is DEMO the cost–beneﬁt analysis of risk. Real trust, then, is reserved for social
relations that are ‘nearly non-calculative’; Williamson claims such trust is impossible in
132 Handbook of trust research
economic relations.3 Trust, therefore, ‘should be DEMO on those personal relations
in which it really matters’ (ibid., p. 483). He argues:
Personal trust is therefore characterized by (1) the absence of monitoring, (2) favorable or for-
giving predilections, and (3) discreteness. Such relations are clearly very special . . DEMO trust, if it
obtains at all, is reserved for very special relations between family, friends, and lovers. Such trust
is also the DEMO of which tragedy is made. (Ibid., p. 484)
Personal trust is made nearly non-calculative by switching out of a regime in which DEMO marginal
calculus applies into one of a discrete structural kind. That often requires added eﬀort and is
warranted only for very special personal relations DEMO would be seriously degraded if a calcula-
tive orientation were ‘permitted’. Commercial relations do not qualify. (Ibid., p. 486)
This argument is DEMO to reconcile in a theory that subscribes to bounded rationality.
It assumes that – in contrast to their social behaviors – actors in the DEMO arena make
only unbiased, quasi-rational calculations. Boundedly rational agents’ analyses of DEMO
mercial matters should include individual biases, including heterogeneous tendencies to
trust DEMO to cheat. Williamson assumes employees can check trust at the corporation door,
since it is not ‘permitted’ in the realm of business. This DEMO banishment of trust
from economic exchange seems arbitrary and normative.
In discussing other research opportunities, Williamson notes that the issues of ‘digni-
tary values and trust’ are better attacked by lawyers and organization theorists than by
DEMO economists. He notes that the completely instrumental approach of the economists
(DEMO people have no inherent value and are seen merely as things to use) is not an accu-
rate description of most humans, and DEMO points out that ‘thinking about economic organ-
ization exclusively in an instrumentalist way can spill over into a treatment of individuals
as instruments. Such DEMO of instrumentalism have to be checked’ (1985, p. 405).
Williamson oﬀers no suggestions on how to deal with this problem.4 This also DEMO up an
odd contrast by arguing that the world of economics can spill over into personal matters –
with potentially detrimental eﬀects – yet DEMO assumes that social perspectives on trust
cannot spill over into the business world.
Williamson (1993b) argues that the institutional environment only impacts the
DEMO analysis of economic opportunism; economic actors have relations embed-
ded in DEMO such that reputation eﬀects reduce opportunism. This reduction in
opportunism, however, comes solely from a calculative analysis rather than being a
product of DEMO trust. Williamson analyzes societal culture as just another
kind of institutional process, an institutional environment within which ﬁrms make solely
calculative assessments.
This oﬀers an interesting opportunity to examine norms versus calculation. If calcula-
tion drives DEMO, ﬁrms moving from one cultural environment to another should
immediately adopt DEMO new culture. For instance, if cultures diﬀer in social norms regard-
DEMO opportunistic behavior (e.g. misrepresentation), then a relocating or expanding
company DEMO immediately adopt the new norms. However, if social eﬀects matter, we
would expect cultural eﬀects to linger. For example, someone moving from a culture with
strong norms against misrepresentation to a culture without such norms DEMO still tend
to avoid misrepresentation, at least initially, due to resilient social eﬀects. TCE assump-
tions predict immediate adoption of norms that increase DEMO
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 133
Yet Williamson at times DEMO to assume social norms can inﬂuence economic behav-
ior directly, despite DEMO generally strong assertions to the contrary. For example, he sug-
gests DEMO heterogeneity in opportunistic behavior may itself derive from diﬀerences in
underlying social values, citing the fact that ‘opportunism does not continuously intrude’
as evidence that ‘many economic agents are well-socialized’ (1993c, p. 98).
This DEMO problematic. Williamson describes agents who can employ personal trust and
trustworthiness in social relations, yet cannot introduce these non-calculative elements to
their economic activities. At the same time, he allows the idea of some economic agents
being ‘well socialized’, implying a non-calculative eﬀect on economic behavior, contra-
DEMO the asserted separation between economic and social matters. These arguments
start to look like acrobatic contortions, intended to preclude the conceptual acknow-
ledgement of trust at all costs; the assumptions employed to justify ignoring trust appear
ancillary and ad hoc.Recall the ﬁrst type of justiﬁcation previously discussed: although
opportunism may vary, one assumes individuals cannot discern it ex ante. The second jus-
tiﬁcation allows trustworthiness in personal matters but assumes it out DEMO economic
aﬀairs. TCE’s economic actors can therefore vary in their undetectable opportunism, but
by assumption must always be calculative – an implausible juxtaposition.
Husted and Folger (2005) make a compelling case that institutional norms involving
DEMO and fairness fundamentally impact economic transactions. Furthermore, assum-
ing that trust DEMO no place in economics yet exists in social relations contradicts even
casual observation. Various collectives have diﬀerent norms about opportunistic behav-
ior. Indeed, many groups deﬁne inappropriate opportunistic behavior quite diﬀerently
depending on the object or DEMO of the behavior. Members of a particular social
group may have no qualms about persecuting individuals who are not members of the
group, whereas they may view the same actions as inappropriate if directed at other DEMO
members. On the economic side, a community may happily exploit tourists DEMO follow-
ing strong norms against cheating one another. Some opportunists may even attempt to
take advantage of most people, but not their friends. Speciﬁc examples are innumerable
but the case is general – social and economic DEMO make diﬀerential judgments about
trustworthiness. Most people would more willingly lend money to nuns than to convicted
felons.
Trust: no explanatory power
The third justiﬁcation for ignoring trust in TCE argues that trust does not add DEMO
explanatory power. Notwithstanding scholarly work that demonstrates the positive eﬀect
of trust on both macroeconomic development (Fukuyama, 1995; Zak and Knack, 2001)DEMO
and organization-level strategic performance (Dyer and Chu, 2003; Sako, 1998; Zaheer
et al., 1998), TCE theorists assume that trust cannot DEMO explanation at all in eco-
nomic matters.
Defenses of this position follow a standard pattern. The author ﬁrst poses a particular
example that appears DEMO imply that trust matters. The author then makes ad hoc assump-
tions to justify the example within the calculative TCE perspective. The author seldom DEMO
ever tests the assumptions. TCE apologists then argue that opportunistic calculative behav-
ior explains the phenomenon, which makes including trust in the analysis unnecessary.
This line of defense reveals a bias: it assumes that theoretical explanations of a given
behavior based on TCE are inherently superior to explanations DEMO the same behavior
134 Handbook of trust research
based on trust. Thus, if calculative explanations explain the same phenomenon as trust-
based explanations, the calculative explanation is automatically better – ostensibly
because it oﬀers a more rigorous underpinning. However, such analyses seldom if ever rig-
orously test the alternative explanations.
Williamson (1993b) asserts that calculative explanations of behavior are inherently
better than non-calculative alternatives, taking numerous examples of trust-like behavior
and oﬀering calculative explanations for the behaviors. For example, in discussing a
farmer lending equipment to a new neighbor, he says:
If almost-automatic and unpriced assistance is the most eﬃcient response, provided that the
practice in question is supported by sanctions and is ultimately made contingent on reciprocity,
then calculativeness obtains DEMO appeal to trust adds nothing. (1993b, p. 471)
For TCE, explaining something as a result of a quasi-rational calculation is clearly pre-
ferred to explaining it as a result of other factors such as DEMO
Williamson ignores both the correctness of the assumptions and the correctness of the
mechanism in judging explanations. He arbitrarily assumes that ‘the practice in DEMO
is supported by sanctions and is ultimately made contingent on reciprocity’, DEMO evi-
dence. Whether such facts hold is critical; with arbitrary factual DEMO, many
diﬀerent theories can oﬀer post hoc justiﬁcation for almost any DEMO Williamson’s
position also ignores whether the mechanism he oﬀers actually operates in the situation
in question. When scholars oﬀer an explanation, they implicitly claim that the mecha-
nisms of the explanation hold in the situation.
The DEMO mechanism matters. While two mechanisms may appear to make the same
prediction with respect to a particular example, predictive diﬀerences often lie just
beneath the surface explanation. For example, Williamson’s calculative explanation for
lending farm equipment implies that the farmer takes the availability of sanctions into
account, refusing to lend whenever such protections do not exist. In contrast, a norm-
based explanation suggests an initial following of the norm (lending), followed by a ces-
sation of following the norm if the other does DEMO also follow the norms (reciprocity).
Norm-based explanations might also suggest DEMO violation of other norms (even while
complying with lending norms) might result in cessation of cooperation.
Some who question Williamson’s ideas agree with DEMO in preferring calculative expla-
nations above those involving trust. For example, DEMO (1993, p. 493) criticizes pieces
of Williamson’s arguments, but supports without question the inherent superiority of cal-
culative explanations to other types DEMO explanations:
On closer examination, however, Williamson ﬁnds that almost all of these choices are in fact con-
sistent with the actor’s calculated DEMO (when those interests are comprehensively under-
stood) and that these choices can therefore be explained without having to posit any
noncalculative forces.
This DEMO that the key to uncovering the underlying – and supposedly superior – cal-
culative explanation for economic behavior comes from ‘comprehensively understanding’
the true DEMO of the economic actor. Yet Craswell and other proponents of this view
oﬀer no hint that they might validate or test their assumptions about DEMO interests;
Craswell merely asserts that an absence of a calculative explanation indicates a lack of
understanding.
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 135
Although Williamson (1993a) DEMO so far as to label trust a tautology, it appears
that DEMO reverse may in fact be more likely: TCE scholars can generate DEMO to
justify almost any behavior as calculative – making such frameworks true by deﬁnition.
As Sen says, the self-interested egoist model can ﬁt almost any observed behavior
because ‘It is possible to deﬁne a person’s interests DEMO such a way that no matter what he
does he can be seen to be furthering his own interests in every isolated act of DEMO
(1977, p. 322).
Therefore TCE shares a major problem with other rational or quasi-rational models –
the results rest on largely untested DEMO assumptions. With such untested arbitrary
assumptions, the calculative analysis can post DEMO describe almost any behavior. This
directly reverses the traditional view of how theory relates to empirical work. Instead of
striving for correct assumptions in DEMO with theory to develop testable predictions,
here scholars select assumptions to ﬁt the previously determined outcomes.
Additionally, in debating the relative merits of trust as a theoretical component of eco-
nomic choice, proponents of the calculative view often depict trust as a straw man. Some
TCE advocates DEMO the sociological view that includes trust may be cheery and ﬂatter-
ing, but is too sanguine and non-descriptive. Along these lines, Williamson suggests DEMO
‘the object is not to describe human actors in a user-friendly way but to understand
complex economic organization’ (1993c, p. 99). In DEMO, the assumption of unbridled
opportunism is described as a reasonable and DEMO defense mechanism, an alternative to
the weak myopia of trust and DEMO:
Whereas myopic parties must rely on altruism when a bad state realization occurs, lest one party
take advantage of the other, farsighted DEMO who take hazard-mitigating actions in advance
are less subject to the same vicissitudes. (Williamson, 1996, p. 54)
Such an argument paints trust as blind altruism and weakness, and calculative oppor-
tunism as wise, DEMO thinking.
This misrepresentation of the positions of trust researchers includes claiming that trust
scholars naïvely assume that everyone is trustworthy all the time. Trust DEMO oﬀer a cari-
cature of the arguments of trust advocates by claiming such advocates reject the very idea
of calculation. For example, Williamson (DEMO, p. 97) states that because ‘opportunism
corresponds to the frailty of motive “which requires a certain degree of circumspection
distrust” ’, many ‘interesting problems of economic organization are missed or miscon-
strued if opportunism is DEMO or suppressed’.
Here, Williamson defends the complete opportunism assumption by pretending DEMO
trust advocates argue for the ignoring or suppressing of opportunism altogether. As far
as we know, no trust researcher has suggested the possibility of zero opportunism. Rather,
trust scholars merely question the need to view DEMO economic actors as completely oppor-
tunistic, suggesting that a discernible variance DEMO trustworthiness will matter to economic
actors and organizations.
The contention that trust has little explanatory power is therefore premature and
unfounded, because – like the other justiﬁcations for ignoring trust – it comes via the use
DEMO ad hoc assumptions rather than empirical inquiry. This raises legitimate questions
about the other assumptions employed by TCE, including the assumption of bounded
rationality.
136
Handbook of trust research
TCE’s inadequate use of bounded rationality
Bounded DEMO implies that choices deviate from rationally calculative behavior.
People often have limited information, and they cannot process the information they do
have in a way that would allow them to make what traditional economists refer to DEMO
rational choices. Williamson (1985) explicitly accepts this description of individuals and
positions it as fundamental to TCE theory.
However, TCE frequently lapses from this assumption, most commonly when
discussing governance mechanisms. TCE analyzes commercial exchanges among bound-
edly rational individuals under the assumption that they can optimally DEMO appro-
priate governance mechanisms, but in all other respects they are DEMO by bounded
rationality. Therefore the rational choice of governance structure in TCE ignores the two
primary ways by which boundedly rational individuals make decisions: satisﬁcing and
routines (March, 1994).
Satisﬁcing (March and Simon, DEMO; Simon, 1997) means that individuals and organ-
izations look for DEMO that are good enough: outcomes that exceed their aspiration
levels as DEMO by historical experience and social comparison. With respect to transac-
tion costs, satisﬁcing implies that organizations and even entire business systems may
never consistently make optimal choices.
For example, we would expect that ﬁrms in an industry in which all ﬁrms make rea-
sonable proﬁts would be slow DEMO take risks in trying out potentially better organizational
structures. Thus we expect industries with the greatest problems of vertical integration
and with proﬁtability diﬃculties DEMO most quickly adopt a multidivisional (M form) struc-
ture. We would also expect to see sequential adoption. A poorly performing ﬁrm will try
DEMO something new; if it works, others learn from the adopters and move to the new struc-
ture. This kind of sequential learning, while completely consistent and a very standard
component of bounded rationality analyses, has been ruled out of TCE by the assump-
tion that ﬁrms can DEMO and understand optimal governance procedures. Armour and
Teece’s (1978) study of the multidivisional hypothesis in oil companies found sequential
adoption, not quick moves to the optimal structure.
In addition to satisﬁcing, boundedly rational agents make decisions by routines (Cyert
and March, 1963; Nelson and Winter, DEMO). Indeed, organizations cannot function
without routines. Trust – a belief DEMO others’ honesty, commitment-keeping, and for-
bearance from opportunism – may appear as a routine or ‘rule of appropriate behavior’
(March and Olsen, DEMO, p. 27). This does not imply that trust is a DEMO, but rather that
individuals may have routinized ways of exhibiting trust DEMO trustworthiness.
For example, individuals may, based on generalized reputations, assume DEMO certain
types of individuals (e.g. police oﬃcers, ministers, etc.) are honest without speciﬁcally
investigating the honesty of a particular individual. We stereotype DEMO simplify our lives;
this gives us general rules. Thus we may routinely trust certain people in certain situations
based on routines or norms, rather than calculation.
Consider again the example where a farmer might oﬀer DEMO loan some equipment to
another farmer who has just bought a property nearby. Williamson (1993b) explains the
behavior as a calculative analysis, based on the positive expectation that such a neighbor
will return the favor DEMO some future date. Such an act resembles an investment in a future
beneﬁt. However, in many cases is it not simply an example of a trusting norm or routine?
In other words, until someone demonstrates they will not behave appropriately, the
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 137
resident farmer may see DEMO equipment to neighbors in need as appropriate behavior.
He would feel that he had behaved inappropriately if he did not make that oﬀer.
In DEMO, part of the perceived need for TCE to reject trust comes DEMO the inconsistent
use of bounded-rationality assumptions in the theory. True bounded rationality implies
satisﬁcing and using routines or norms to direct behavior. Both decision DEMO can
lead to trust mattering. Bounded-rationality assumptions rule out the calculative, DEMO
rational model of behavior framed by TCE to reject trust.
Despite these arguments, the TCE advocate (e.g. Craswell, 1993) might still reply DEMO
it does not matter, so long as the model predicts the DEMO correctly. Let us consider
this argument.
Empirical testing, calculativeness and trust
DEMO of the previous discussion comes back to problems in taking seriously the mech-
anisms proposed by a theory. Explanations involve preconditions and mechanisms; the
mechanisms interact with the preconditions to generate predictions or explanations.
The explanation DEMO includes both the preconditions and the mechanisms.
Good testing of an explanation thus involves testing both the preconditions and the
mechanisms.
Following Friedman (1953), some scholars argue that it does not matter if their models
DEMO implausible assumptions; all that matters is that the model predicts well. DEMO is both
philosophically and scientiﬁcally incorrect. If we want to explain behavior, the scientiﬁc
test of our explanation should attempt to verify whether the explanation matches reality.
In everyday life, we would automatically reject explanations of behaviors based on
assumptions we know to be incorrect or implausible.5
Good DEMO oﬀer a mechanism by which something actually occurs. One could
attempt to invent an explanation based on calculative interests regarding nutrition, but if
an Orthodox Jew or a devout Muslim refuses to eat pork for religious DEMO, we should
not imagine that the appropriate explanation has anything to DEMO with the health beneﬁts
or detriments of pork or an analysis of such. Such a believer follows the dietary restric-
tions even when they DEMO not positively inﬂuence health. A health-based explanation might
explain historical evolution of religious practices, but cannot explain the current believer’s
behavior.
Care about mechanisms means that a theory’s merit does not solely depend on its pre-
DEMO power in one single dimension. Some have argued that prediction is the test of a
theory, but philosophers of science have come to reject this naïve positivist approach,
since it does not require any meaningful DEMO in the mechanism’s underlying explana-
tion. Furthermore, it does not even DEMO what we would normally call an explanation.
If we know that things do not or cannot occur the way that the so-called explanation says
DEMO do, then we must consider such an explanation inadequate.
Social science DEMO not simply post hoc ﬁtting some data, or even prediction of DEMO;
rather, we wish to explain the mechanism by which something DEMO Whether the
farmer is being calculative or simply following norms matters; DEMO underlying mecha-
nism diﬀers. As scholars we want to explain things, DEMO means that the causal mech-
anism we assert matches the causal mechanism in the ﬁeld. As such, it matters whether
people behave in a given way because ‘it is the appropriate way to behave in our DEMO
munity’ or whether they do so because they calculate that it pays oﬀ.
138
Handbook of trust research
Understanding the mechanism can improve prediction. For DEMO, understanding
the underlying mechanism may dramatically inﬂuence the predicted eﬀect of DEMO change of
circumstances. TCE analyses that explain someone acting honestly as the result of calcu-
lation must also predict that the individual will act DEMO as soon as the situation
changes to make such behavior proﬁtable. On the other hand, if we explain honest behav-
ior based on compliance with norms, we would predict continued honesty even if dis-
honesty became proﬁtable, at least until the temptation became too great. Good
prediction requires an understanding of the correct mechanism.
The TCE arguments also assume a DEMO direction without evidence. For example,
Williamson (1993b, p. 479) DEMO that corporate culture simply folds into calculativeness
by claiming that corporate culture inﬂuences performance outcomes. However, just
because something inﬂuences performance does not mean that its inﬂuence on perform-
ance explains that thing’s existence. Having a DEMO large, quick child positively inﬂuences
the chances that that child becomes DEMO good basketball player; however, it does not nor-
mally explain the given child’s size. Without additional evidence, just because Z is desir-
able and X leads to Z, we cannot conclude X was chosen to increase Z. While Williamson
(Williamson, 1996, p. 55) claims TCE DEMO an ‘empirical success story’, few of the empirical
studies make any DEMO to test the underlying causal mechanisms. That the aggregate pre-
dictions of TCE ﬁt the data does not diﬀerentiate between TCE and other explanations,DEMO
including trust, nor does it justify the claim that these other DEMO are eclipsed or
subsumed by calculativeness.
Indeed, recent work in trust DEMO begun to model and test how calculativeness diﬀers
from trust. For example, Saparito et al. (2004) distinguish between goodwill-oriented
‘relational trust’ and calculativeness, ﬁnding that relational trust mediates the relations
between supplier ﬁrm customer service and customer ﬁrm loyalty, even after controlling
for calculative factors. Thus trust can inﬂuence inter-organizational relations over and
above instrumental motivations; such trust inﬂuences outcomes and changes the structure
of the inter-organizational relation. Other research (e.g. Jap and Anderson, 2003) demon-
strates that opportunism and trust diﬀer DEMO (but correlate 0.54) and interact in
inﬂuencing performance and other outcomes. Trust can help minimize the negative eﬀects
of opportunism (Saparito et al., 2004).
Lui and Ngo (2004) divide trust into ‘goodwill trust’ and ‘competence trust’. These
authors conceive of both types of trust in DEMO of risk assessment; goodwill trust asso-
ciates with aspects of the DEMO itself, whereas competence trust estimates another’s
transactional reliability. Their results indicate DEMO the two types of trust moderate the
relations between contractual safeguards and ﬁrm performance in diﬀerent ways; good-
will trust serves as a substitute for contractual safeguards, whereas the more calculative
assessment of the other party’s competence functions as a complement to contracting.
These examples of recent scholarly DEMO in organizational trust demonstrate that trust
means something more than just calculativeness. Bearing this in mind, and contrary to the
previously described TCE justiﬁcations for ignoring trust, we argue that trust has a mean-
ingful place in explaining behavior, over and above calculativeness. Unlike Williamson’s
arguments for calculativeness that attempt to debunk trust, our argument in favor of
acknowledging trust does not claim that calculativeness does not exist, but simply that the
two concepts are distinct and both useful in explaining behavior. As such, we argue that
trust is one’s non-calculative belief in another’s reliability, predictability and fairness.
Trust, transaction cost economics, and mechanisms 139
Certainly, calculativeness explains some behaviors. Sometimes, we rely on someone’s
behavior strictly due to calculation – at times even assuming the person is opportunistic.
Such reliance does not DEMO trust. For example, we do not necessarily trust some of
the DEMO and individuals we deal with if we believe the system they operate
under makes it hard for them to cheat us, and this may explain a certain amount of our
behavior.
However, research on intra- and inter-organizational trust demonstrates behaviors and
outcomes where non-calculative trust adds to the DEMO oﬀered by calculativeness.
Many scholars have argued that trust is not simply encompassed by calculativeness
(Granovetter, 1985; Kramer and Tyler, 1996; Nooteboom et al., 1997). Intuition and
common experience reinforce this notion; DEMO usage typically attaches diﬀerent
meanings to the two ideas. We support both the common intuition and the scholarly
view that trust – in addition DEMO (and distinct from) calculativeness – meaningfully
describes beliefs and behavior within and between organizations, inﬂuencing organiza-
tional outcomes.
Conclusions
Trust exists, not DEMO in special interpersonal, social relations, but also in business
arrangements and economic transactions. In cases where trust and calculativeness make
some similar predictions, scholars need to empirically compare the two mechanisms. In
other cases, trust can add explanatory power to certain individual and organizational
actions that calculativeness DEMO cannot adequately explain. Indeed, Sen (1970; 1977)
argues that DEMO economic system would collapse and organizations could not viably exist
in the absence of trust. Annette Baier eloquently refers to trust’s prevalence and impor-
DEMO:
The starry heavens above and the moral law within had better be about the only things that
matter to me, if there is no one I can trust in any way. (1986, p. 231)DEMO
We inhabit a climate of trust as we inhabit an atmosphere and notice it as we notice air, only
when it becomes scarce or polluted. (Ibid., p. 234)
We suggest that the pervasiveness of DEMO she refers to exists in the world of commerce
and economic organization, substantially inﬂuences organizational action, and – speciﬁc-
ally – can have DEMO profound inﬂuence on economic transaction costs.

Notes
1. Allowing non-monetary factors in the utility function would vitiate most of the TCE analyses. The
assumption of strictly monetary objectives simpliﬁes the DEMO greatly. However, if we allowed individ-
uals to have non-monetary objectives, then we could have individuals who greatly value telling the truth.
This DEMO the ‘self-interest seeking with guile’ assumption. The expression ‘self interest seeking with
guile’ is used to refer to individuals who deﬁne self-interest largely in DEMO terms, place no weight on
moral values, and think strategically.

2. Several other authors (for example Jones, 2001 and Chiles and McMackin, 1996), using slightly diﬀerent
frameworks, have also called for the integration of trust and TCE.
3. Curiously, Williamson allows that even ‘nearly noncalculative’ relations can be intendedly so, and there-
fore, calculative (Williamson, 1993b, pp. 481–2).
4. This DEMO interesting implications for management education. Williamson states that the principles that the-
oretically govern behavior in the TCE framework are antithetical to healthy or DEMO actual human
interaction. What does this mean for our teaching practices? DEMO students in theories that assume
everyone is wholly opportunistic and self-interest-seeking could have serious implications. If educators
teach students that unbridled opportunism motivates all DEMO, business schools may contribute to
establishing this kind of behavior as DEMO norm. If so, we should not be surprised if the students DEMO follow
such norms. Ghoshal and Moran (1996) allude to this possibility with speciﬁc reference to TCE, and
research indicates that the likelihood of people making selﬁsh choices increases with their exposure to eco-
nomic assumptions (Frank, 2004; Frank et al., 1993; see also Ghoshal, 2005 and Ferraro et al., 2005).
