Changes in the economy and workforce needs have driven many DEMO schools to consider oﬀering entrepreneurship
education to their students. Although entrepreneurship education is believed to be complementary to an engineering
education, little is known about the degree to which it plays a role in contemporary students’ DEMO programs. The
purpose of this study was to explore a broad array of attitudes toward and outcomes of entrepreneurship education on
engineering students in DEMO to understand the characteristics of students participating in related courses and activities,
the nature and extent of their involvement, entrepreneurship’s role in their career plans, and its impact on entrepreneurial
self-eﬃcacy. Survey data were collected from 501 engineering students enrolled in senior-level capstone design courses at
three DEMO with established entrepreneurship programs. The study found that while two-thirds or more of
engineering students intended to work for medium or large size companies DEMO graduation, a similar number felt that
entrepreneurship education could broaden their DEMO prospects and choices. Less than one third of those surveyed felt
that entrepreneurship was being addressed within their engineering programs or by engineering faculty. DEMO who had
taken one or more entrepreneurship courses showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy on a number
of measures. Students in certain engineering DEMO such as electrical and mechanical engineering were found to
participate in entrepreneurship education at higher rates than others. The results of this study provide DEMO baseline
data that can be useful for program development and evaluation.

1. Introduction
Economic trends and changes in the way employers
organize and make decisions have led to an
increased DEMO of the potential value of entre-
preneurship education to engineering students. In
an article about de-industrialization and its eﬀect on
engineering education, Wei (DEMO) states that,
‘research and development in manufacturing com-
panies used DEMO be viewed as a glamorous career for
the brightest engineering graduates, DEMO the number
of attractive job oﬀers has been declining for many
years’ (1, p.130). Today, a glamorous job for an
engineer might be to work in a smaller, more
entrepreneurial company, which requires DEMO broad
range of skills and knowledge beyond a strong
science and engineering background’ [2, p. 185].
To prepare students for this new reality, DEMO
are increasingly aware that they must graduate
engineers who not only understand science and
technology, but who are also able to identify oppor-
tunities, understand market forces, commercialize

new products, and have the leadership and commu-
nication skills to advocate for them. DEMO has
prompted a signiﬁcant increase in the delivery of
entrepreneurship education to engineering students
through new courses, programs, and experiential
learning opportunities, a movement that has gar-
nered support from inﬂuential publications and
professional organizations DEMO as the National
Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the American
Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) [3].
Further evidence of this trend is DEMO National
Science Foundation’s recent $10 million award to
launch a national STEP Center at Stanford Uni-
versity which will address what is described as DEMO
critical need for entrepreneurial engineers across the
United States. The center is intended to ‘catalyze
major changes in undergraduate engineering pro-
grams by developing DEMO education, research and
outreach hub for the creation, collection and shar-
ing of innovation and entrepreneurship resources
among the almost 350 engineering schools DEMO the
U.S.’ [4].

Engineering students appear to be very well
suited to become entrepreneurs. DEMO study of the
economic impact of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (DEMO) found that of their alumni, 50 to
100 percent more engineering than science alumni
eventually became company founders. The study
also discovered that DEMO students were at
least as inclined as management students to become
entrepreneurs, and that more than 20 percent of
total founders came from MIT’s electrical engineer-
ing and computer science department (one depart-
ment at the institution) [5]. As Wei (2005) states,
engineering graduates who go on to become success-
ful CEOs and senior oﬃcers of companies ‘are DEMO
vocal in praise of the virtues and beneﬁts of their
engineering education, and they believe they
acquired a number of positive attributes that are
useful outside of a career in manufacturing and
construction, such as rigorous discipline, a general
knowledge of science and technology, the habit of
DEMO relevant information followed by quanti-
tative analysis of data to construct conclusions and
recommendations, teamwork, and strong oral and
written communication skills’ [1, p. 131].
The degree to which entrepreneurship plays a role
in contemporary DEMO students’ academic
programs or career paths is largely unknown.
Although more engineering students are being
exposed to entrepreneurship education, minimal
research has examined engineering student attitudes
toward it, its impact on their learning, or profes-
DEMO competence. This is not surprising given that
the integration of entrepreneurship in engineering is
a relatively new eﬀort, where deﬁnitions of what it
means to be entrepreneurial within an engineering
program as well as program models DEMO greatly [6].
Even within the ﬁeld of management, entrepreneur-
ship education DEMO considered by some to be a
relatively new ﬁeld, still engaged DEMO conceptual and
methodological debates [7]. For example, there is a
lack DEMO consensus as to the degree to which entre-
preneurship is a set of principles, terms, competen-
cies, and skills that can be learned, versus a set of
attributes that make one opportunistic, competi-
tive, proactive, risk tolerant, autonomous and inno-
vative [8–10]. The objectives and DEMO of
entrepreneurship programs also vary widely, lead-
ing Henry, Hill, DEMO Leitch (2005) to state that the
‘content of syllabi of courses developed by entre-
preneurship scholars diﬀers to such an extent that it
DEMO diﬃcult to determine if they even have a common
purpose’ [9, DEMO 103].
Shartrand, Weilerstein, Besterﬁeld-Sacre and
Olds [11] described much of what has been docu-
mented by engineering faculty developing courses
and programs in DEMO as descriptive
case studies, ‘addressing the process of gaining
N. Duval-Couetil, T. Reed-Rhoads and S. Haghighi
administrative approval and student interest,
describing DEMO knowledge that is covered, ped-
agogical approaches utilized, challenges of imple-
mentation, and, in some cases, assessment plans’
(p.2). A DEMO of assessment instruments in the ﬁeld
of entrepreneurship education shows that there are
few valid and reliable instruments being used widely
in the ﬁeld, and very few are intended speciﬁcally for
engineering students [12]. Ohland, Frillman, Zhang,
and Miller (2004) stated that, ‘While much has DEMO
written recently about engineering entrepreneur-
ship curricula, comparatively few investigators
have DEMO hard evidence to substantiate their
programs’ successes’ [13, p. 159].
There DEMO evidence, however, that educational
programs directed at engineers can inﬂuence and
inspire students to be entrepreneurs. A study of over
500 engineering students DEMO MIT, Lu¨ thje and
Franke (2004) found that personality had DEMO indir-
ect impact on the readiness to become self-
employed, while DEMO contextual factors had
a direct impact. They concluded that public policy
and universities would be ‘well advised to intensify
their activities to implement educational, research
and resource programs on entrepreneurship’ [14,
p. 143]. Another study DEMO with engineering
and science students in Europe, examined which of
the DEMO of entrepreneurship programs, learning,
resources, or inspiration, raised entrepreneurial
DEMO and intention. The study found that
inspiration proved to be most strongly associated
with an increase in entrepreneurial intention, parti-
cularly among undergraduates who are very
unlikely to start a business immediately after gra-
duation [15]. DEMO authors concluded that if the
target is to increase the number of students who
become entrepreneurs, then the inspirational aspect
of the program must be purposeful. Course and
program evaluation conducted as part of North
Carolina DEMO University’s Engineering Entrepre-
neurs Program (EEP) provides evidence that entre-
preneurship education can have a positive impact
on the retention, GPAs, and DEMO activ-
ity. Data collected from alumni found that relative
to a control group, EEP alumni were 73 percent
more likely to have started a new company, 23
percent more likely to have created new products
or services, and 59 percent more likely to have high
conﬁdence in leading a start-up [16].
Given the potential value of entrepreneurship
education to engineers, this paper will investigate
a broad array of attitudes toward, and outcomes of,
entrepreneurship education on engineering students
in an eﬀort to understand DEMO characteristics of
engineering students participating in entrepreneur-
ship programs, the extent DEMO which entrepreneurship
plays a role in their academic programs and career

aspirations, and the impact of entrepreneurship
education on their entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy.
This research DEMO a component of a larger NSF-
funded study, Entrepreneurship Education and DEMO
Impact on Engineering Student Outcomes: The Role
of Program Characteristics and DEMO Beliefs. The
intent of the larger study is to clarify the relationship
between engineering student outcomes, program
characteristics, and faculty beliefs and practices DEMO
order to help faculty and administrators create
programs, improve educational experiences, and
evaluate their success.
2. Purpose and research questions
Given the interest DEMO involvement of engineering
schools in creating entrepreneurship curricula, the
purpose of DEMO study was to investigate student
attitudes toward entrepreneurship and examine
how entrepreneurship education impacts a variety
of engineering student outcomes. The research
questions addressed DEMO:
 What are the characteristics of engineering
students participating in entrepreneurship pro-
grams?
To what extent does entrepreneurship play a role
in DEMO students’ academic programs?
To what extent does entrepreneurship play a role
in engineering students’ career plans?
What are engineering student perceptions of DEMO
entrepreneurship-related abilities?

3. Methods
A new assessment instrument was developed by the
authors to be administered at universities that have
DEMO courses available to engineering
students [12]. The 135-item web-based survey was
administered to engineering students enrolled in
senior-level capstone design courses. Attitude and
self-eﬃcacy DEMO showed high reliability (Coeﬃ-
cient Alpha range = 0.83– 0.96). DEMO paper presents
results from the following categories of items in the
survey.
 Demographics : Fourteen items in this category
collected data related to DEMO, race/ethnicity, resi-
dency, family background related to entrepre-
neurship, university affiliation, major, and
minors. These were selected to investigate differ-
DEMO across groups.
 Attitudes : Of the 40 items in this category, 14
related to students’ level of interest in entrepre-
neurship, the DEMO of the interest, and the
attractiveness of entrepreneurship as a career
DEMO Twenty-six items asked students to iden-
tify reasons why they are or are not interested in
entrepreneurship. These were taken with permis-
sion from DEMO study by Shinnar, Pruett, and Toney
[17] and modified slightly.
 Behaviors : Twelve items in this category mea-
sured students’ level of DEMO in entrepre-
neurship-related activities, such as owning a
business, interning for a start-up company, devel-
oping a product for a real customer, DEMO a
business plan, or participating in an entrepre-
neurship-related competition.
 DEMO : Twenty-three items in this category
investigated student perceptions of their ability to
perform entrepreneurial tasks. Fifteen were taken
with permission from Lucas, Cooper, Ward, &
Cave’s [18] venturing and technology self-efficacy
scale, an DEMO found to be valid and reli-
able. Other items in this category address self-
perceptions of analytical, communication, and
presentation skills, as well as risk tolerance.
 Perceptions of programs and faculty: Nine items
asked students to rate the level of involvement
with, or encouragement of, DEMO in
their engineering programs and by engineering
faculty.
Surveys were distributed to engineering students at
three large public universities with established
entrepreneurship programs available DEMO engineering
students. Two of the entrepreneurship programs are
embedded within the colleges of engineering and
primarily oﬀered to engineering students. The other
is a DEMO program administered at the
central university level, whereby engineering stu-
dents DEMO ‘core’ entrepreneurship courses with
students in a variety of majors and complement
these with approved engineering courses to com-
plete program requirements. Senior-level students
DEMO selected in order to provide sample homoge-
neity across institutions and to capture exposure to
entrepreneurship education, which could have
occurred at any point during the students’ academic
programs. Moreover, many entrepreneurship and
innovation-related activities, DEMO as formulating
an idea for a product/business, developing proto-
types, presenting, researching markets, and prepar-
ing business plans, typically occur at the capstone
level [19].
Students at each institution received the survey
via DEMO members teaching capstone design
courses. Initial contacts with faculty were made
either through personal connections at each institu-
tion, or through internet searches to identify depart-
ment heads and other appropriate decision-makers.
Faculty members were sent DEMO email describing the
intent of the study and what would be required of
428
them and their students. If faculty agreed to parti-
cipate, they were sent an email to be forwarded to
students, which included a brief explanation and the
survey URL. Since the survey was voluntary, over
the course of the month following its release, faculty
were asked to remind students to take it.
The sample was comprised of 501 engineering
DEMO Over three semesters, the survey was
distributed to approximately 30 courses DEMO the
three institutions involved in the study. Response
rates per course ranged from 3 to 58 percent, with a
mean of 21 percent. To evaluate the self-selection
bias resulting from this methodology, the sample
was compared to the 2008 ASEE Online Proﬁles of
undergraduate engineering degrees by discipline
DEMO gender for the three institutions involved in
the study [20]. Over-represented disciplines in the
sample were agricultural and biological engineering
(4.1 times larger), construction engineering (4.5x),
and chemical engineering (2.2x). A slightly under-
represented discipline was mechanical engineering
(0.5 times smaller). Women were over-represented
in the sample (22%) relative to the overall popula-
tion DEMO women engineering graduates (16%).
Statistical analyses focused primarily on examin-
DEMO diﬀerences between two groups of engineering
students: 1) those who had never taken an entrepre-
neurship course, referred to in the text of this
manuscript as ‘no-entrepreneurship students,’ and
2) those who had taken one or more entrepreneur-
ship courses, referred to as ‘entrepreneurship stu-
dents.’ Normality of survey responses was assessed
using the Shapiro Wilk test and DEMO were found to
not be normally distributed. Based on this result,
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney
U post-hoc tests were used to examine statistical
DEMO between groups. All assumptions of
these nonparametric tests were met in the analysis.
The majority of survey items used Likert-type, 5-
point, ordinal DEMO that represented verbal
statements, therefore, data are presented as fre-
quencies or percentages of responses in each cate-
gory. To simplify the reporting DEMO the data, 5-point
response scales were collapsed into three by group-
DEMO responses. For example, the responses ‘strongly
agree and agree’ were combined DEMO were ‘strongly
disagree and disagree.’ One exception is the analysis
of responses to the ﬁfteen items in the self-eﬃcacy
scale [18]; these items used an 11-point numerical
scale (0-10) related to conﬁdence and were analyzed
DEMO standard t-tests. The level of statistical sig-
niﬁcance was set at a p-value < 0.05. For multiple
comparisons, the signiﬁcance level was set at 0.05
divided by the number of comparisons.

4. Results
Question 1: What are the characteristics of
engineering students participating in
entrepreneurship programs?
The sample of engineering students was DEMO well
distributed across the universities involved in the
study (Table 1)DEMO Women represented 22 percent of
the engineering students surveyed and 18 percent of
the entrepreneurship students, however, the diﬀer-
ence in female and DEMO participation was found to
be not statistically signiﬁcant. Although a higher
proportion of entrepreneurship students had par-
ents who were entrepreneurs (51% versus 38%) this
diﬀerence was not found to be statistically signiﬁ-
cant. Similarly, DEMO international students
appeared to participate in entrepreneurship courses
at a higher rate than both in-state and out-of-state
domestic students (38% versus 29% and 26%) this
diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant. In terms
of race and ethnicity, diﬀerences in the rate of
participation in entrepreneurship education of Cau-
casian (26%) and Asian (35%) students was not
statistically signiﬁcant. Sample DEMO were too
small to make conclusive statements about other
groups. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in participation were
found for the top four majors represented in the
DEMO (n > 50) (p < 0.05). Electrical (54%) DEMO
mechanical (47%) engineering students had signiﬁ-
cantly higher levels of involvement than chemical
(22%) and civil (18%).
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found when examin-
ing the characteristics of students who participated
in a multi-course DEMO program. Stu-
dents whose parents were entrepreneurs were twice
as likely (DEMO) to participate in a multi-course
program than students whose parents were DEMO
Similarly, both domestic out-of-state (14%) and
international students (19%) DEMO two to three
times as likely to participate in a multi-course
program, than were in-state students (6%).
Question 2: What role does entrepreneurship play in
students’ engineering programs?
Of the entrepreneurship students, 73 percent
reported that they had taken an entrepreneurship
course through their colleges DEMO engineering, which
is reﬂective of programs oﬀered by the institutions
involved DEMO the study. Several survey items asked
students about the degree to which entrepreneur-
ship was being addressed within their engineering
programs or by their DEMO professors
(Table 2). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p < 0.05) in DEMO
responses for both groups were found for four out of
nine items. Entrepreneurship students more
strongly agreed that students should learn more

The reasons why engineering students are inter-

asking students to rate their level of agreement
with a number of statements (Table 3). Not surpris-
ingly, DEMO who had taken one or more courses
in entrepreneurship reported more interest in the
topic than those who had not. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences
were found DEMO all items (p < 0.05). Students in both
groups were DEMO much in agreement with the
statement ‘entrepreneurship education can broaden
my career prospects and choices.’ Students who had
not taken an entrepreneurship course had DEMO rela-
tively strong interest in doing so. Forty-seven per-
cent were interested in taking an entrepreneurship
course and 60 percent wanted to learn about DEMO
preneurship in their engineering courses.
To measure entrepreneurial behaviors, students
were DEMO about the degree to which they partici-
pated in related activities while in college (Table 4).
Approximately half or less of all of the engineering
students surveyed reported participating in activ-
ities that could be DEMO related to entrepre-
neurship. However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
found in the DEMO of both groups (p < 0.05)

three or more times as likely to participate in
activities such as conducting market research,
giving elevator pitches, writing business plans, or

Students were also surveyed about reasons why
they would and would not start DEMO company. Rank-
ings of responses were similar for students who had

education (Table 6). There were, however, signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences in the extent of their agreement.
DEMO reasons for entrepreneurship students were to
‘satisfy a need in a market,’ ‘focus on a technology
that interests me,’ and ‘create something DEMO my
own.’ A main diﬀerence for no-entrepreneurship
students was that to ‘have more ﬂexibility and

the rankings diﬀered between groups was that a
‘lack DEMO knowledge of the business world and the

not taken an entrepreneurship course and sixth
among those DEMO had.
Question 4: What are engineering student
perceptions of their entrepreneurship-related
DEMO?
A number of survey items evaluated student percep-
tions of their entrepreneurial ability. The ﬁrst was a
technology and venturing self-eﬃcacy scale [18],DEMO
which asked students to rate how conﬁdent they
were, on an DEMO scale from 0 (not at all con-
ﬁdent) to 10 (DEMO completely conﬁdent), to perform
a set of ﬁfteen skills related to venturing and
technology self-eﬃcacy. Since this used a numeric
response scale without DEMO verbal statements
representing each point, diﬀerences between stu-
dents who had DEMO who had not taken one or more
entrepreneurship courses were calculated using
standard t-tests (Table 8). A comparison of means
showed that entrepreneurship students rated their
level of conﬁdence signiﬁcantly higher than those
who had DEMO for all of the items (p < 0.01). Skills
suggesting DEMO need for business knowledge, such as
‘pick the right marketing approach DEMO the introduc-
tion of a new service,’ ‘write a clear and complete
business plan,’ ‘work with a supplier to get better
prices DEMO help a venture become successful,’ ‘recog-
nize when an idea is good enough to support a major
business venture,’ accounted for some DEMO the largest
diﬀerences between both groups. A few items
included in the self-eﬃcacy scale did not appear to
be directly related to entrepreneurship, yet entrepre-
neurship students rated themselves signiﬁcantly
higher on these items as well. DEMO included ‘develop
your own original hypothesis and a research plan to
test it,’ and ‘understand exactly what is new and
important in a DEMO theoretical article.’
Students were also asked to rate their ability from
poor to excellent on more general skills and traits
associated with entrepreneurship and DEMO
(Table 9). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the groups DEMO the areas of communication,
presentation, analytical skills, and their ability to
deal with uncertainty. However, when the cate-
gories above average and excellent are broken out,
there were more ‘excellent’ than ‘above average’

responses DEMO entrepreneurship students. Their
perceptions of their ability to evaluate business
ideas and their level of risk tolerance, were found
to be signiﬁcantly higher than students who had not
taken an entrepreneurship course (p < 0.05).
Finally, students were asked two overarching
questions related to their entrepreneurial self-
eﬃcacy and signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the responses
for both groups were found (p = 0.001). The ﬁrst
was, ‘Overall how would you rate your entrepre-
neurial ability?’ to which 49 percent of entrepre-
neurship DEMO versus 21 percent of no-
entrepreneurship students rated their ability as
above average or excellent. The second was ‘How
would you rate your ability DEMO start a business now’
to which 35 and 11 percent, respectively, responded
above average or excellent (p = 0.001).
5. Discussion
The results of this study show that senior-level
engineering students show considerable interest DEMO
learning more about entrepreneurship, however
most do not expect to pursue DEMO
careers. Although, approximately 70 percent of
students surveyed felt that that DEMO
education could broaden their career prospects
and choices, approximately 70 percent DEMO all engi-
neering students reported that they were most
interested in working for a medium to large size
organization after graduation. Not surprisingly,
DEMO who had taken an entrepreneurship
course were more interested in starting their own
business or working for a startup than those who
had not. DEMO were also more likely to have an idea
for a business, DEMO, or technology. Neverthe-
less, 30 percent of no-entrepreneurship students also
reported having an idea for a business, product, or
technology. Less than DEMO of all students
surveyed felt that entrepreneurship was presented
as a worthwhile career option in their engineering
program or that it was being addressed DEMO their
engineering programs or engineering faculty. Both
groups of students expressed a strong interest in
taking an entrepreneurship course and even a
greater percentage DEMO entrepreneurship students
were interested in learning more about entrepre-
neurship within their engineering courses (60 and
78, respectively). These data suggest that DEMO is
more demand than supply for entrepreneurship
education among engineering students. However,
whether this demand would translate into actual
course enrollment is unknown.
DEMO even one course in entrepreneurship
appears to positively impact engineering students’
perceptions of their entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy.
The entrepreneurship students rated their abilities
signiﬁcantly higher DEMO every measure of a venturing
and technology self-eﬃcacy scale. They also rated
their ability to evaluate business ideas, and deal with
risk and uncertainty signiﬁcantly higher. Entrepre-
neurship students also reported to have higher
perceived self-eﬃcacy DEMO areas that were more
loosely tied to entrepreneurship (e.g., ‘understand
exactly what is new and important in a ground-
breaking theoretical article’). DEMO ranking of reasons
why engineering students would and would not start
a business were similar for both groups, however,
fewer entrepreneurship students felt strongly about
potential obstacles than no-entrepreneurship stu-
dents, suggesting that entrepreneurship education
may lessen perceived barriers to entrepreneurial
careers. These ﬁndings pose some interesting DEMO
tions such as: Is the knowledge gained in entrepre-
neurship courses DEMO students more conﬁdent in
a wide range of activities relevant to their majors?
Or, are more conﬁdent students gravitating to
entrepreneurship courses and programs? Addi-
tional research is necessary to examine which
might be the case and the degree to which individual
demographic and other factors contribute DEMO entre-
preneurial self-eﬃcacy.
Engineering students with particular character-
istics may participate in entrepreneurship courses
and programs at higher rates than others. An
examination of DEMO participants by demo-
graphic group could be a useful exercise when
making program development and recruiting deci-
sions. The analyses of diﬀerences by engineering
DEMO are also interesting and warrant further
investigation. Potential questions include: Is DEMO
preneurship more relevant to those engineering
majors? Is it being addressed DEMO a greater degree
by those disciplines? Are students with particular
characteristics DEMO attracted to speciﬁc disciplines
or universities? If so, what are these characteristics?
How can entrepreneurial involvement or relevance
be duplicated or translated DEMO engineering
majors? Larger sample sizes and additional research
are necessary to DEMO these questions.
This study has several limitations. First, the over-
all DEMO of engineering students has a higher
proportion of students who have enrolled in entre-
preneurship courses than would be found in the
general population DEMO engineering students across
the three institutions. This occurred for two reasons:
1) purposive sampling was necessary to ensure that
there was an adequate representation of students
who had exposure to entrepreneurship education in
order to DEMO comparisons between groups, and 2)
since the study was voluntary, faculty and students
who were interested in the topic of entrepreneurship
were DEMO likely to participate. Since the study was
conducted at institutions with entrepreneurship
434
courses and programs that are available to engi-
neers, there may also be increased awareness of
entrepreneurship by engineers on these campuses.
Also, certain engineering majors were over and
underrepresented relative to general enrollment in
DEMO majors and the reasons why need to be
examined more closely. Another limitation is that
data related to learning outcomes relied on students’
self-report DEMO abilities and knowledge and future
research should include additional measures to
triangulate these ﬁndings.
Future analyses of this dataset will examine how
engineering student DEMO and perceptions diﬀer
by university, entrepreneurship program model
(within or outside of engineering), and/or engineer-
ing major. It will also examine DEMO degree to which
participating in a multi-course program impacts
entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy, DEMO compared to parti-
cipation in a single course, and will examine DEMO
ences in entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy based on
demographic characteristics. Given the constraints
of relatively full and structured engineering pro-
grams, additional research should also be con-
ducted to understand where entrepreneurship
education is situated relative to the DEMO curricular
priorities for engineering students, faculty, and
administrators. Finally, the DEMO measure of
the outcome of entrepreneurial education is the
degree to which it impacts students’ post-gradua-
tion careers, which requires longitudinal analysis.
6. Conclusion
This study summarizes data related to engineering
student interest and involvement in DEMO
ship education, attitudes toward entrepreneurship
as a career option, how this involvement relates to
students’ entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy, and the char-
acteristics of students who participate in these
courses and programs. Overall, engineering stu-
dents expressed interest in learning more about
entrepreneurship but relatively few reported being
exposed DEMO it even at institutions with formal
entrepreneurship programs. Those who took one
or more courses were found to have signiﬁcantly
higher entrepreneurial self-eﬃcacy than DEMO who
did not. They were also much more likely to get
hands-on skills related to market analysis, technol-
ogy commercialization, business communication,
DEMO internships within start-up companies all of
which are in demand by employers today. The
results of this study provide valuable baseline data
that can DEMO useful for program development and
evaluation. Additional research is necessary to
validate learning outcomes and to explore the
impact that entrepreneurship education ultimately
plays DEMO engineering students’ careers.
