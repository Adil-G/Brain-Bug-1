Abstract
In this study, DEMO investigate the effects of entrepreneurial orientation and marketing information
on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises. We build and test a causal model DEMO
data obtained from Singaporean entrepreneurs and find support for most of our hypotheses. The
results indicate that entrepreneurial orientation plays an influential role on DEMO acquisition and
utilization of marketing information, and also has a direct DEMO on firm performance. The utilization
of information regarding marketing mix decisions (DEMO the Promotion and Place elements)
positively affects firm performance, and DEMO partially mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial
orientation and firm performance. The implications and future research directions are discussed.

1. Executive summary
The literature indicates that entrepreneurial orientation (EO), with its three core
dimensions of risk-taking, acting proactively and innovativeness, has a positive impact on
firm performance. Previous research has found that DEMO with high levels of EO tend to
constantly scan and monitor their operating environment in order to find new opportunities
and strengthen their competitive DEMO This suggests that the level of EO in the firm
could be a predictor of the acquisition and utilization of information. In this study, we seek
to examine how EO affects, both directly and indirectly, DEMO performance of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Specifically, in addition to the direct impact of EO on
firm performance, we also investigate how EO influences information acquisition (IA) and
information utilization (IU), and whether IA and IU mediate the relationship between EO
and firm DEMO
From both practice and research, it has been found that many DEMO are interested in
information on their customers and competitors in order to differentiate their offerings and
positioning. More importantly, beyond acquiring information, entrepreneurs DEMO need to
use this information to aid in their marketing decision-making. Based on the marketing
mix framework, we define marketing decision-making as decisions pertaining to the 4Ps
(Product, Price, Promotion, and Place), which DEMO entrepreneurs to better meet the needs of
their customers and compete more effectively against their competitors. As the basic
building-block of market orientation consists DEMO the acquisition and utilization of
information on customers and competitors to improve marketing decision-making, we
expect both IA and IU to have positive impact on firm performance.
In order to test our research framework, we conducted a survey on SMEs located in
Singapore. Using contact information from three DEMO directories, we carried out a mass
mailing of 2000 emails and DEMO regular mails. Of these, we ended up with 294 usable
responses. DEMO is a wide spread of businesses in our sample, with the DEMO top sectors
being the Retail/Sales (20.1%) and Service (19.7%) sectors. Most firms in our sample are
relatively small yet established, with 82% of them having fewer than 35 employees, and
66.3% of them being more than five years old.
The findings from our study show DEMO the level of EO has both direct and indirect
(partially mediated DEMO IU) effects on firm performance. EO is a strong predictor of DEMO IA
and IU. To take full advantage of EO, in which DEMO, proactive and risk-taking actions
are encouraged, SMEs should comprehensively and accurately acquire and utilize
information about customers and competitors to enhance marketing strategy DEMO
Our empirical analysis also indicates that information must be used in order to benefit
from it. In particular, we do not find evidence for the positive impact of IA on firm
performance. However, we find a positive relationship between information utilization to
make marketing decisions and subsequent firm DEMO Specifically, we find that the
use of marketing information relating to DEMO Promotion and Place (distribution and location)
elements have significant impact DEMO firm performance. We conjecture that the Price and
Product elements are less influential as (1) SMEs tend to be price-takers in the industry, with
little ability to shift the price level for specific product categories DEMO to actively change prices.
We believe that there is also a trade-off between Price and Promotion elements, and (2) small
firms may not have sufficient funding to invest heavily in R&D efforts to develop DEMO

new products, and tend to make incremental product changes. This DEMO be explained by the
concept of an ‘entry wedge,’ which represents a way to break into the established pattern of
commercial activity. The DEMO popular form of entry wedge is ‘parallel competition,’ where
the product already exists, and the firm's advantage derives from minor variations in the
product. In addition, many firms in our sample are not from the manufacturing sector.
In summary, our study contributes to a better understanding of the importance of EO in
enhancing SME firm performance. EO has DEMO direct and indirect impact on firm
performance. IU demonstrates a positive effect on firm performance, and also plays the role
of a partial mediator in the relationship between EO and firm performance.
2. Introduction
In entrepreneurship DEMO, entrepreneurial orientation has been found to have a
positive impact on DEMO performance (e.g., Covin and Slevin, 1991; Smart and Conant,
1994; Wiklund, 1999). Firms with high levels of entrepreneurial orientation DEMO to
constantly scan and monitor their operating environment in order to find new opportunities
and strengthen their competitive positions (Covin and Miles, 1999)DEMO As part of their
environment scanning and monitoring activities, firms look DEMO information that can help
them better meet the needs of their customers, manage their risk taking, as well as challenge
their competitors. While DEMO firms typically have the resources to conduct extensive
market research to gather such information, it is not clear to what extent small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) engage in information acquisition and utilization, and whether
such activities influence firm performance.
In both streams of entrepreneurship and marketing DEMO, it has been noted that
information on customers and competitors has DEMO effect on marketing decision-
making (Smeltzer et al., 1988; Brush, 1992; Menon and Varadarajan, 1992; Deshpandé and
Zaltman, 1982). DEMO is a need to continuously gather information on customer needs and
competitor capabilities in order to deliver consistently high-quality products and services as
well DEMO to create superior customer value (Slater and Narver, 1998). However, previous
research efforts examining the effect of marketing information were limited by the lack of
in-depth marketing variables studied (Perkins and Rao, 1990; Schafer, 1990).
After acquiring information, it is crucial that SMEs DEMO the information to their
advantage. Unless the collected information is used, DEMO does not provide any tangible
benefit. Unfortunately, with few exceptions (Johnson and Kuehn, 1987; Brush, 1992;
Cooper et al., 1995; Butler et al., 2000), most researchers on SMEs do not consider
information utilization. As such, the literature has not addressed how SMEs use marketing
information to enhance firm performance. We also do not know how DEMO
orientation shapes the extent of information acquisition and utilization.
Based on the identified gaps in the literature, in this article we seek to answer the
following questions:
• How does the level of entrepreneurial orientation DEMO the information acquisition and
utilization activities, as well as the performance DEMO SMEs?
• What are the roles of information acquisition and information utilization in the
relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and the performance of SMEs?
H.T. Keh et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) DEMO 595
• Do greater acquisition and utilization of marketing information lead to higher levels of
SME firm performance?
• Are there differential effects DEMO the four elements of the marketing mix (product,
price, promotion and place) on entrepreneurial performance?
This paper is organized in the following manner. In the next section, we develop the
model and the associated hypotheses. Subsequently, we describe the methodology,
conduct the analysis, DEMO the results, and provide managerial implications. Our
concluding remarks summarize our DEMO, limitations and suggestions for future
research.
3. Model and hypotheses development
DEMO shown in Fig. 1, our model explains how entrepreneurial orientation influences DEMO
performance of SMEs directly and indirectly via the acquisition and utilization of marketing
information.
Since Miller and Friesen (1982) first proposed the construct DEMO entrepreneurial
orientation (EO) over twenty years ago, it has become DEMO widely accepted means of
explaining firm performance. EO refers to the “processes, practices, and decision-making
activities that lead to new entry” (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996, p. 136), and has three core
dimensions: entrepreneurial aspects of risk-taking, acting proactively and innovativeness.
Risk-taking propensity involves the willingness to commit significant resources to exploit
opportunities or engage in business strategies DEMO which the outcome may be highly
uncertain (Keh et al., 2002). Proactiveness reflects entrepreneurial willingness to dominate
competitors through a combination of DEMO and aggressive moves, e.g., introducing
new products or services ahead of competition and acting in anticipation of future demand
to create change and DEMO the environment. Finally, innovativeness refers to a firm's
tendency to DEMO in creative processes, experimentation of new ideas, which may result

in the institution of new methods of production and/or bringing new products or services to
current or new markets.
High EO is DEMO related to first-mover advantages and the tendency to take advantage
of emerging opportunities, which ultimately has a positive influence on performance
(Wiklund, 1999). In this article, we use both financial and non-financial measures of SME
performance (Murphy and Callaway, 2004; Murphy et al., 1996; Gupta and Govindarajan,
1984). Lumpkin and Dess (1996) caution DEMO when using a multi-dimensional construct of
firm performance (FP), EO DEMO have positive effect on one dimension (e.g., new product
development), and a negative effect on another dimension (e.g., short-run profitability).
DEMO, the predominant evidence indicates positive correlations between EO and FP
(e.g., Covin and Slevin, 1991; Smart and Conant, 1994; Wiklund, DEMO). In particular,
Smart and Conant (1994) contend that higher EO, together with a wide variety of distinctive
marketing competencies, leads DEMO higher performance. As such,
H1. Entrepreneurial orientation is positively related to firm performance.
Information acquisition processes refer to the collection of primary or DEMO
information from organizational stakeholders (Moorman, 1995). This involves environ-
mental scanning, intelligence activities and the importation of resulting information into the
firm. The construct Information Acquisition (IA) in our study is measured in DEMO of its
sources—personal and impersonal—because in practice, entrepreneurs collect information
from DEMO of these sources. Personal sources of information are defined as those involving
direct contact with people on a regular basis (Smeltzer et al., DEMO), and include family,
friends and customers. Some entrepreneurs prefer such intimate sources as they are viewed
to be more directly relevant and DEMO of their immediate operating environment
( Schafer, 1990; Brush, 1992; Cooper et al., 1995). By the same token, impersonal sources
DEMO those without direct human contact (Smeltzer et al., 1988). Even though impersonal
sources lack intimacy and firm-specificity, a survey by Sawyerr, DEMO and
Thibodeaux (2000) indicates that some entrepreneurs rely on impersonal sources such as
newspapers and trade publications because they perceive them to have DEMO more balanced
approach and indicative of general trends and information. Such impersonal sources are
inexpensive and may also provide some information on competitor marketing DEMO,
which is difficult to be obtained through personal means.
Information utilization (IU) is particularly important to firms' final decisions, because
information DEMO deemed to be worthless unless it is put to good use (DEMO and Myers, 1986;
Deshpandé and Zaltman, 1982; Ottum and DEMO, 1997). Menon and Varadarajan (1992)
suggest that information utilization be conceptualized in terms of type and extent of usage
in the DEMO process. They classify information utilization into action-oriented
use, knowledge-enhancing use and DEMO use. Action-oriented use refers to information
utilization that results in changes in the user's activities, practices or policies; knowledge-
enhancing use would DEMO the user's knowledge; while affective use would change the
user'DEMO psychological status, such as her satisfaction or dissatisfaction, confidence or lack
thereof, and trust or mistrust (Menon and Varadarajan, 1992).
Compared to action-oriented use, knowledge-enhancing use and affective use are
difficult to measure because of their intangible outcomes. As a result, we measure
information utilization as the extent to which a firm directly applies market information to

influence marketing-related actions (Deshpandé and Zaltman, 1982; Menon and
DEMO, 1992). Past research indicates that small business owners regard marketing
DEMO as the most important, ahead of other corporate decisions such as DEMO and
employee compensation (Pineda et al., 1998). In this paper, we operationalize marketing
decision-making based on the 4Ps framework, which stands DEMO product, price, promotion
and place, also known collectively as the DEMO mix. Despite its age, the 4Ps
classification of the marketing mix DEMO the predominant method of understanding the
essence of marketing (van Waterschoot DEMO van den Bulte, 1992).
Johnson and Kuehn (1987) find DEMO the small business owner/manager spends a large
amount of time to seek marketplace information. For this reason, Kaish and Gilad (1991)
DEMO entrepreneurs as “avid information searchers.” Entrepreneurial orientation will
increase a firm's information acquisition and utilization activities in creative, proactive and
risk-taking ways. In most cases, information acquisition and utilization tend to be risky as
they involve substantial effort and expenditures. In addition, the outcomes of these
activities are uncertain as they depend on many other influencing factors. Therefore, only
SMEs with high levels of entrepreneurial orientation are likely to be active DEMO information
acquisition and utilization.
Moreover, having a proactive orientation involves discovering DEMO satisfying the latent,
unarticulated needs of customers through collecting customer- and competitor-based
information (Slater and Narver, 1998). The external culture embedded DEMO the proactive
orientation also facilitates information utilization, entailing the design and DEMO
of marketing actions that influence external constituencies. As such, SMEs that DEMO
high levels of entrepreneurial orientation tend to constantly scan and monitor their
operating environment in order to find new opportunities and strengthen their competitive
DEMO (Covin and Miles, 1999).
Zaltman (1986) argues that if a firm has a pro-innovation bias, information is more
likely to be shared and used. The innovativeness aspect of entrepreneurial orientation
would promote change DEMO creative behaviors, which encourage active exchange of ideas,
increase information DEMO and novelty in new product development (Menon and
Varadarajan, 1992; DEMO et al., 1998). Accordingly, we posit that EO has positive
relationships with both IA and IU.
H2. Entrepreneurial orientation is positively related DEMO information acquisition.
H3. Entrepreneurial orientation is positively related to information utilization.
Information is a powerful knowledge resource that can enhance competitive advantage.
In particular, information pertaining to a firm's customers and competitors are crucial
towards DEMO development of market orientation (Narver and Slater, 1990). Such information
identifies changing customer desires and patterns. For example, it can reveal that customers
favor certain brands or pay more attention to price and quality DEMO to variety and novelty
(Miller and Friesen, 1982), increase awareness on customer purchase trends and buying
power (Xu and Kaye, 1995), and alert entrepreneurs to the disadvantages of their product
lines and the superiority of the product lines of competitors (Miller and Friesen, 1982)DEMO
Information on competitor locations and pricing policies are also critical towards the
formation of SME competitive strategies (Butler et al., 2000).

H.T. Keh et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 592–611
Generally, firms that engage in more information search tend to DEMO higher performance
(Dollinger, 1984). For instance, Soh (2003) DEMO that firms with more efficient networking
strategy tend to acquire more competitive information about other firms earlier, and this
information advantage in turn leads to better new product performance. Brockman and
Morgan (2003) also find DEMO firms with more information about the product category tend
to enjoy a higher level of new product performance in terms of profit margin and DEMO on
investment. We expect a similar relationship between information acquisition and overall
firm performance, because information pertaining to customers and competitors enhance a
firm's competitive advantage and eventually contributes to its overall performance (Narver
and Slater, 1990; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990). This expectation is captured in the following
hypothesis,
H4. Information acquisition is positively related to DEMO performance.
While information acquisition is obviously important, Diamantopoulos and Souchon
(1999) contend that any information acquired by entrepreneurs bears little impact on firm
performance unless it is put to good use in decision-making. Several studies DEMO the
crucial role of information utilization (Wilton and Myers, 1986; DEMO and Friesen, 1982;
Moorman, 1995; Ottum and Moore, 1997). However, these studies tend to look at only a part
of the whole marketing strategy, e.g., new product development (Moorman, 1995; Ottum
and Moore, 1997; Lybaert, 1998) or using information to DEMO alliance formation (Ottum
and Moore, 1997). To date, research DEMO information utilization based on the 4Ps remains
limited. Conant and White (DEMO) observe that the use of information in market program
planning impacts DEMO effectiveness, which subsequently benefits financial performance.
Previous research indicates that high DEMO of market orientation positively impact firm
performance (Narver and Slater, 1990; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990). The utilization of
information regarding customers DEMO competitors to improve marketing decision-making is
considered to be the basic building-block of market orientation. Thus, we postulate that
better utilization of marketing information would lead to higher performance.
H5. Information utilization is positively related to DEMO performance.
In this study, both information acquisition and information utilization are DEMO as
partial mediators in the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm
performance.
4. Research methodology
4.1. Data collection method and sample size
The pool DEMO business owners contacted was selected randomly from different industries
(e.g., retail, manufacturing and service sectors) in Singapore. We focused on small
businesses DEMO fewer than 100 employees, where the likelihood of strategic influence on
DEMO company by the business owners was higher. Small business owners tend to be the most
knowledgeable people in the company, and they were our target respondents. The contact
list of potential respondents was obtained from three DEMO directories in Singapore.
H.T. Keh et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) DEMO 599
We contacted 2239 firms (we sent 2000 emails to firms DEMO email addresses, and
239 regular mails to firms that did not DEMO email addresses). Three weeks after the
first wave of mailings, DEMO followed up with further emails and phone calls to
nonrespondents (Dillman, 2000). Out of these, 308 surveys were returned, either
electronically DEMO through regular mailing, with 14 surveys rejected because of
incompleteness. This DEMO a total of 294 usable responses, yielding a response rate of
DEMO When conducting survey research, there is a concern related to nonresponse DEMO
In order to check for nonresponse bias, we compared the answers DEMO early versus late
respondents. We used a naturally-occurring breakpoint between the two response waves,
and a multivariate t-test did not show any significant DEMO between early and late
respondents (p = .756), suggesting that DEMO bias is not a problem in our study
(Armstrong and Overton, 1977).
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the respondents' firms. There was a wide spread of
businesses, with the two top sectors being the Retail/Sales (20.1%) and Service (19.7%)
sectors. In terms of size, 82.3% of the entrepreneurial firms have fewer than 35 employees
and 41.2% of them have five or fewer employees. The age of DEMO companies surveyed was
skewed towards more established ventures, with 66.3% of DEMO being more than 5 years
old, and 42.9% having existed for DEMO than 10 years.

4.2. Questionnaire construction
All items in the questionnaire (Sections A DEMO D) were adapted from published works that
were relevant to our DEMO, as shown in Table 2. Section A measures the frequency and DEMO
source used by entrepreneurs to collect information. The items for information acquisition
are measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1—Never to 5—Always). Section B measures
the degree of information utilization by entrepreneurs to make marketing DEMO decisions. A
5-point Likert scale (1—Strongly Disagree to 5—Strongly Agree) is used, indicating the
extent to which the entrepreneurs agree with the sentence. Measures for the three
dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation in Section C are DEMO from Covin and Slevin
(1989) and Miller and Friesen (1982)DEMO However, unlike previous works using 7-point
numerical differential scales, all items here are measured using 5-point Likert scales (1—
Strongly Disagree to 5—Strongly Agree), in order to be consistent with other items in the
DEMO
In Section D, all performance measures of the companies are subjective, i.e., according
to the perception of the respondent. As advocated by Murphy and Callaway (2004), both
financial and non-financial performance measures are employed. There is little or no
published financial data on our sample, which consists of private firms, and independent
business owners are often reluctant to share objective performance information (Smart and
Conant, 1994). Financial performance, therefore, is measured by benchmarking the
respondents' own business performance to DEMO of competitors' based on profitability,
sales growth, market share and overall performance. Although there are limitations to
perceptual data in terms of DEMO measurement error and potential for mono-method
bias, previous research indicates that DEMO measures correlate positively with
objective measures of firm performance (Murphy and DEMO, 2004; Murphy et al., 1996;
Gupta and Govindarajan, 1984). A 5-point Likert scale is used (1—Much Weaker to 5—
Much Better). Non-financial performance is captured by three items pertaining to realizing
DEMO start-up goals, offering job security to employees, and satisfaction with overall
performance. A 5-point Likert scale (1—Strongly Disagree to 5—Strongly Agree) is DEMO
to measure the degree of agreement with each item.
5. Results
5.1. Analysis of the measurement model
All the scales in our study were DEMO subjected to exploratory factor analysis (principal
components analysis using varimax rotation DEMO a criterion of eigenvalue greater than 1.0)
to test the constructs' underlying dimensions and to look for a more parsimonious set of
variables for subsequent analysis. The construct reliability was assessed using coefficient
alpha. All DEMO demonstrated good reliability. The final measurement items and
coefficient alpha for each scale are presented in Table 2.
In our study, we are particularly interested in the relationships among several
constructs: entrepreneurial orientation (EO), DEMO acquisition (IA), information
utilization to make marketing mix decisions (IU), and firm performance (FP). For the
purpose of parsimony and measurement error reduction, we used composite measures to

test the model (Hair et al., 1998). We followed the latent variable approach that the
underlying construct is assessed indirectly by DEMO of its various manifestations (cf.,
Carver, 1989). Specifically, DEMO this study EO was proposed to have three underlying
dimensions (i.e., innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking). Since the three subscales
are DEMO of EO, we use the summed construct measure instead of the DEMO
subscales. Similarly, IA was measured by its two manifestations (acquisition of personal
or impersonal information about customers and competitors), IU was captured DEMO four
items (information utilization to make decisions on each of the DEMO marketing mix
elements), and FP was assessed using two dimensions (DEMO and non-financial
performance).
The full measurement model was constructed using all eleven indicator variables and the
four constructs as latent variables (one exogenous variable and three endogenous variables).
The results of the confirmatory factor DEMO (using AMOS 4.0) exhibited a good level of
fit: χ2 (38) = 97.51, p < .001. Other fit statistics were RMR DEMO .04, RMSEA = .07, GFI = .94,
CFI = .96, and TLI = .94. All t-tests of the indicator variables were significant at the .001
level. We also assessed each construct's reliability based DEMO composite reliability (CR) and
variance extracted measure (VE) (Hair DEMO al., 1998). The results are reported in Table 3,
DEMO that all construct reliabilities and variance extracted measures were above the
cutoff values of .70 and .50, respectively (Hair et al., 1998).
5.2. Testing the hypothesized structural model
We estimated the structural model using DEMO 4.0. The overall fit statistics indicated a
good fit of the model (χ2 (38) = 97.51, χ2/df = 2.6, GFI = .934, CFI = .96, TLI = .94,
RMR = .04, RMSEA = .07). All fit indices for our structural model achieved DEMO exceeded
the usually recommended threshold values. We tested a total of five hypotheses. Fig. 1
provides the standardized path coefficients and associated t-statistics of DEMO model.
As predicted in H1, the path from EO to FP DEMO significant and positive. Our results also
support H2 and H3: Entrepreneurial DEMO was a significant predictor of information
acquisition and information utilization.
Contrary to our expectation for H4, the path from IA to FP was found to be negative and
non-significant. Therefore, information acquisition was not a mediator of the relationship
between EO and FP. This issue will be discussed DEMO H5 also failed to obtain
support from the data. We posited that firm performance would be higher if entrepreneurs
were to make use of DEMO information they collected. Although the relationship was positive

as predicted, it was not statistically significant (β = .10; t -value = 1.47). As noted in the
previous section, DEMO on information utilization to make marketing mix decisions
remains largely unexplored. It could be expected that the information utilization for
each element of the DEMO may impact firm performance at different levels. In addition,
we are also interested in finding out the differential effects among the 4Ps on DEMO
performance. Therefore, we examined the effect of information utilization for each
DEMO of the marketing mix in our structural model. The results demonstrated that the
path from information utilization to firm performance was positive and significant DEMO
Place and Promotion (p < .10), while it was non-significant DEMO Price and Product. We
therefore re-specified our initial model with the Price and Product indicator variables
removed.
The re-specified model achieved an acceptable level DEMO fit: χ2 (21) = 68.24, χ2/df = 3.2,
GFI = .95, CFI = .96, TLI = .93, RMR = .03, RMSEA = .08. The percentage of variance
explained was 27% for IA, 24% for IU, and 35% for FP. The standardized path DEMO
and associated t -statistics of the re-specified model are presented in Fig. 2. As predicted, the
hypothesized relationships between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance,
information acquisition, and information utilization were positive and significant (γ DEMO .56,
t-value = 5.78; γ = .52, t-value = 6.06; and γ = .24, t -value = 2.63, respectively), which
supported H1, H2 and H3.
The path from information acquisition to firm performance was negative and not
significant, thus, H4 was not supported. DEMO expected, information utilization demonstrated a
significant and positive effect on firm DEMO (β =.17, t-value = 2.21), lending support to
H5. The results, therefore, revealed that information utilization served as a partial mediator DEMO
the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance. To test the
mediating effect of information utilization, we examined two alternative models, one without
DEMO direct path from EO to FP, and one with both direct DEMO indirect paths from EO to FP (cf.,
Zhang et al., 2003). Chi-square for the model without the direct path from EO DEMO FP was 116.94
(df = 22); while chi-square for the DEMO with the direct path from EO to FP added was 68.24
(DEMO = 21). The results showed that there was significantly lower value of chi-square for the
Fig. 2. Results based on the place and DEMO elements.

model with the direct path from EO to FP added (DEMO (1) = 48.70, p < .01). The added direct
DEMO from EO to FP did not change the significance of the mediated paths through information
utilization. This provided evidence that entrepreneurial orientation had both DEMO and indirect
effects (through information utilization as a partial mediator) on firm performance.
6. Discussion and implications
We find information acquisition and utilization DEMO be important activities, particularly
salient for firms that have high levels DEMO entrepreneurial orientation. We infer that business
owners should have creative, proactive DEMO risk-taking ways to seek innovative
information and utilize the acquired information. Firms that closely monitor customers'
needs tend to improve creativity by producing DEMO and meaningful offerings and
marketing programs that, in turn, reinforce organizational innovations through the firm's
entire business system (Im and Workman, DEMO). A deep understanding of customers,
such as their purchasing habits, psychological makeup and lifestyles, can help SMEs to
conduct better market DEMO and find new niche markets. Secondly, entrepreneur-
ial willingness to dominate DEMO by a combination of proactive and aggressive
moves can be more effectively realized by acquiring and using information about
customers and competitors. With the DEMO information, SMEs can have a better
understanding of their customers' changing needs and act accordingly. Finally, intelligent
entrepreneurial risk management also demands information acquisition and utilization
because it is widely recognized that information can reduce DEMO during decision-making.
With valuable information, SMEs can evaluate their options, identify the most profitable
opportunity, and thus control uncertainty to some extent (DEMO et al., 2002). In this way,
SMEs can exploit DEMO opportunities as well as lessen, though not eliminate, unnecessary
uncertainty. Overall, our results support the notion that having an entrepreneurial
orientation pays off in the long run (Wiklund, 1999).
Our sample of entrepreneurs DEMO that, on the whole, they obtain and use information on
customers and competitors from both personal and impersonal sources. However, we did not
find evidence supporting the hypothesis that information acquisition is positively related to
DEMO performance, thus, it plays the role of a mediator in the relationship between entre-
preneurial orientation and firm performance. This finding can be DEMO as follows. First,
previous studies (e.g., Brockman and Morgan, DEMO; Soh, 2003) found that acquiring
information can result in greater DEMO product performance. In our sample, most firms are not
involved in DEMO, and only a few firms in the sample engage in new DEMO
development. Second, a study by Moorman (1995) also found that DEMO acquisition was
not related to new product performance. She cited the possibility of information overload,
especially complex and ambiguous information, entering and moving within the firm. She also
suggested that the effect of information acquisition DEMO new product performance was probably
mediated by the information utilization process. Consistent with Moorman (1995),even
though information acquisition was not found to DEMO direct impact on firm performance in our
study, it showed significant DEMO positive impact on information utilization, which in turn
enhanced firm performance.
DEMO finding has important implications for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs should
actively engage in information acquisition as an aid to effective marketing strategy
608
H.T. Keh et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 592–611
formulation. More importantly, proactive use of such information allows entrepreneurs DEMO
predict oncoming trends and enact strategies, supporting the view that the DEMO
advantage associated with information depends increasingly on whether a firm is able to
make the best use of acquired information (cf., Moorman, 1995). The mere fact of
information availability does not necessarily lead to DEMO performance. Information
utilization enables SMEs to gain competitive advantage and maintain a stronger position
relative to the competition. The information may unveil latent needs, which exist and are
unmet, but are not apparent to competitors (DEMO et al., 2000). Being the first to
uncover such latent DEMO provides impetus to adjust the marketing mix elements
accordingly.
The non-significant relationship between Price and Product information utilization and
firm performance in our model DEMO be explained by the characteristics of our sample
SMEs. As noted earlier, our sample consists of many small firms mainly from retail and
service industries, with 41% of them having five or fewer employees. As small businesses
are usually the price-takers in the industry, they have no capacity to shift the price level for
specific product categories or to actively DEMO prices. Instead, they are probably price
followers in the market, keeping in line with the pricing strategies of the larger enterprises
or market DEMO as a defensive measure to avoid the aggressive tactics of larger
competitors. We find that the relationship between information utilization and firm
performance is DEMO for promotion information but non-significant for price
information; we conjecture that DEMO make a trade-off in the decision regarding price
and promotion. The information about a competitor's promotional tactic may lead to a
firm's DEMO to carry out a promotion based on extra unit or other item purchase rather
than to change the price per unit. Such promotions may DEMO turn affect the prices of other
items.
We attribute the non-significant relationship between product information and firm
performance to the fact that few of DEMO sample SMEs engage heavily in R&D efforts to
develop radically new products. In most cases, among the manufacturing firms in our
sample, DEMO just make trivial alterations on the physical form of products (e.g., style and
size). This is consistent with the concept of an DEMO wedge,’ which is “a strategic
competitive advantage for breaking into the established pattern of commercial activity”
(Vesper, 1989, p. 176). The most popular form of entry wedge is ‘parallel competition,’
where the DEMO already exists, and the firm's advantage derives from minor variations DEMO
the product.
On the other hand, we empirically establish a positive DEMO between
information utilization in marketing decision-making concerning the Promotion and
Place elements and subsequent firm performance. As SMEs also tend to have limited
resources, they should focus their activities on marketing elements that generate the
highest DEMO on performance. This implies that SMEs have to carefully channel their
marketing resources towards greater promotional and distribution activities, where they
have more control. In practice, this means that entrepreneurs need to emphasize more
promotional and advertising activities, particularly in terms of enhancing customer
awareness and building customer retention. In addition, based on our sample, the SMEs
should also DEMO attention to location and distribution issues, which affect customer
convenience and DEMO

7. Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we now have empirical DEMO that:
• entrepreneurial orientation plays an important role in enhancing firm performance. It has
both direct and indirect effects (partially mediated by information utilization) on firm
performance,
• although information acquisition is not positively related to firm performance, it is a
strong predictor of information utilization. Information utilization, in turn, has positive
impact on firm performance, and
• there is a positive relationship between information utilization to make marketing
DEMO (i.e., promotion and place elements) and subsequent firm performance.
Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of entrepreneurial orientation
and its DEMO on firm performance. This study also demonstrates the importance of using
marketing information pertaining to customers and competitors in making marketing-mix
decisions, which contributes to higher firm performance in the entrepreneurial setting. We
conclude that information DEMO and utilization should not be a one-time event; rather
it should DEMO an on-going process through day-to-day interactions with customers, suppliers,
and DEMO business associates. This also suggests the need to have good communication and
networking skills. Such practices would not only allow entrepreneurs to formulate superior
DEMO, but also enable them to identify new business opportunities.
There are DEMO limitations that suggest caution in assessing our findings. In particular,
the lack of objective financial performance data limits us to use perceptual firm
DEMO measures. This is because we are studying SMEs, for which there DEMO no legal
requirement in Singapore to publicize their financial results. However, DEMO use of perceptual
measures is a common issue in organizational research, DEMO as reflected in other studies,
objective and subjective measures are highly correlated, even though they are separate
constructs (see Murphy and Callaway, 2004; Murphy et al., 1996).
Other limitations pertain to our DEMO In particular, our sample firms concentrate in the
retail and service DEMO, with a high percentage having five or fewer employees. This
characteristic DEMO the Singapore entrepreneurial scene may well explain the non-significance
of the Price and Product marketing elements in our results. We could not control for DEMO
industry effect in our model. An extension of this study would be to collect SME samples
from larger markets and capture industry differences. As DEMO information utilization, we
examined only its action-oriented use in this study. DEMO research can examine the other
two types of information utilization and study their different roles in the relationship
between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance. DEMO also did not include control
variables in this study such as personal characteristics (e.g., educational level), which could
affect the owners' ability to process and use information to make marketing decisions.
Additional research with DEMO samples should also consider firm differences, such as firm
age and DEMO
The overriding contribution of this study is that we provide empirical evidence on how
entrepreneurial orientation has not only direct impact, but also indirect impact on SME firm
performance via the mediating effect of information utilization. DEMO are rewards for using
610

information to make marketing decisions, particularly those related to promotion DEMO place
elements. As our study was cross-sectional in nature, it would DEMO worthwhile to investigate
the long-term effects of marketing information on performance, DEMO calls for a
longitudinal study complete with control variables.
