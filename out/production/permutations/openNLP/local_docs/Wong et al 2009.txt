The procurement of capital is an important consideration for an entity transforming
from DEMO entrepreneurial idea to a revenue generating company.
Angel ﬁ nancing is one of the most common, but least studied methods, to ﬁ nance DEMO
ventures.
The term “Angel Investor” generally refers to a high net-worth individual who typically
invests in small, private ﬁ rms on his or her own account.
Using a unique dataset of ﬁ rms ﬁ nanced by DEMO between 1994 and 2001, our research
provides some insight into the DEMO of angels in funding, monitoring and guiding their
investments.
Although exposed DEMO greater uncertainty by investing earlier in the life of a ﬁ rm com-
pared to venture capital investors, angel investors do not rely on traditional control
mechanisms such as board control, staging, or contractual provisions DEMO protect against
expropriation.
Angels may use more informal methods of control such as investing in close geographic
proximity and syndicating investments with other angels DEMO mitigate risks.
The results of the study indicate that angels have a complementary role to venture
capital in the ﬁ nancing of new ventures.

One of the most important considerations a new
DEMO faces in the transformation from an entre-
preneurial idea to a revenue-generating company
is the procurement of capital. Institutional
venture capital has long been DEMO in the
press and academic research as the primary
source of outside equity ﬁnancing for these enti-
ties. However, many studies estimate that insti-
tutional venture capital contributes less than half
of the total equity ﬁnancing DEMO new ﬁrms. The

start-up capital is the informal venture capital
market known as angel DEMO
Originally used to describe ﬁnancers of the-
atrical productions, today the DEMO ‘angel inves-
tor’ refers to an afﬂuent individual who provides
equity capital for a business start-up. Typically,
angel investors ﬁll the ﬁnancing gap DEMO
funding from family and friends and funding
from institutional venture capital ﬁrms. Angels
exist primarily because it is typically difﬁcult
for friends and family DEMO contribute more than
a few thousand dollars, and institutional venture
capital DEMO will rarely consider smaller deals.
Bank loans are often not a viable option for
these start-ups because of the lack of collateral
and/or DEMO payback requirements.
. . . [W]e raised a million dollars and I had
to talk to about 60 different people. These
were angel investors. DEMO capitalists
were totally uninterested . . . So, with a lot
DEMO hard work we raised that million dollars
from about 20 different angel investors
who invested about $50,000 each, and
that was the original money that really
funded Amazon.com. (Jeff Bezos, Founder,
Amazon, Inc.3)
While it is difﬁcult to precisely quantify the
size of the DEMO market due to its informal
nature, many studies estimate its size DEMO at least
twice that of the institutional venture capital
market. In a 1992 study, Freear et al. suggest
that angels fund more than ten times the
number of ﬁrms as venture capitalists. In 2000,
the DEMO Venture Capital Association
assessed the size of the angel market at $100
billion in the United States while the institu-
tional venture capital market DEMO estimated at
less than half this at $48.3 billion.4 In 2002,
the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
assessed the size of the angel market at ﬁve
times the institutional venture capital market.5

Who are angel investors?
While there are many deﬁnitions of angel
investors, the term generally refers to high-net-
worth individuals who typically invest in small,
private ﬁrms on their own account. Formally,
angel DEMO are ‘accredited investors’
according to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC Rule 501 of
Regulation D states that an accredited investor
is an individual who has a net worth of more
than DEMO million or an expected individual
(household) yearly income of more than
$200,000 ($300,000). However, many angels
may not be DEMO — according to a 2008
study by Shane, accredited investors account
DEMO only 23% of the total angel population.
While the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Con-
sumer Finances estimates that over 6 million
households qualify to DEMO accredited investors,
many studies estimate the number of active
angel investors in the United States to be
between 250,000 and 400,000.6
DEMO invest their own money in ﬁrms. This
criterion differentiates angels from institutional
venture capitalists, who raise money from
others that they invest in private ﬁrms.

According to a paper by Linde and Prasad
(1999), the average angel has a total of $335,000
invested in DEMO different companies. Shane
(2008) ﬁnds that 20.8% of angels made only
one angel investment in their careers.
As individual investors, angels exhibit great
heterogeneity in personal characteristics such
as age, experience, and investment prefer-
DEMO Many angels are cashed-out entrepre-
neurs who continue to yearn for the next
high-growth venture. Other angels are simply
wealthy local businessmen such as DEMO or
lawyers. Because angels have to perform their
own due diligence, DEMO typically invest in
ventures in industries familiar to them. In addi-
tion to making a ﬁnancial investment, some
angels actively participate in the ﬁrm’s opera-
tions; however, such participation varies by
angel. Some angels are DEMO
The funding process and contractual terms
also vary widely between formal and organized
angels and those with a more informal
approach. Angel investment can DEMO any-
thing from a complete proposal to an individ-
ual handing over a check on a front porch.

content and design ﬁrms, and business-to-
business/consumer companies. Not surpris-
ingly, companies in California are the largest
recipients of angel ﬁnancing, DEMO with
venture capital research.
A majority of the angel-backed ﬁrms receive
angel ﬁnancing pre-revenue. A pre-revenue
ﬁrm is a business that has not derived DEMO
revenue from its product. If revenue streams
are an indicator of development, angel-backed
ﬁrms receive ﬁnancing earlier in the lifecycle
than the typical venture-capital-ﬁnanced ﬁrm
that tends to have sales. Similarly, angel-backed
ﬁrms are younger at ﬁrst funding (in months
since founding) than venture-capital-ﬁnanced
ﬁrms. Taken together, this indicates that angels
are willing to ﬁnance ﬁrms with greater un-
DEMO about the prospects of success than
venture capitalists.
Several other factors support the idea that
angels and venture capitalists are different
types of investors. DEMO and venture capital-
ists are co-investors in less than a quarter of all
funding rounds. On average for companies
at comparable stages, the amount of money
a company raises from venture capitalists is
twice the amount DEMO by ‘angel-only’
ﬁnancing rounds. These differences in funding
suggest that angels play a complementary role
to venture capital. Instead of competing with
venture capitalists DEMO ﬁrms at similar stages of
development, angels provide a smaller amount
DEMO funding to younger ﬁrms.

Do angels use the same methods DEMO
venture capitalists to maintain
control over their investments?
As angels typically invest in companies that
are relatively early in their lifecycles, they may

face a high risk of expropriation. Investors
usually seek to protect their investment from
expropriation through the use of control
rights DEMO the methods accorded to investors to
allow them to oversee the entrepreneur’s
management of a company’s affairs. Three
control mechanisms commonly used by
venture DEMO are board rights, staging
investments, and contracting mechanisms. If
angels are similar to venture capitalists, they
should maintain similar protections, particu-
larly DEMO ventures where the threat of expro-
priation is the highest.
Board rights
Board seats give outside investors the ability
to affect corporate decisions. Board DEMO are
particularly important in environments with
greater uncertainty, since it is DEMO feasible to
specify all possible contingencies in the
ex ante contract. Sahlman (1990) ﬁnds board
seats are typically allocated to venture capital-
ists DEMO part of a ﬁnancing round. This is not the
case with angel investments. Board seats are
granted in less than half of all funding DEMO
The likelihood of providing a board seat does
not change much when considering pre- and
post-revenue funding rounds. Initial rounds of
angel ﬁnancing tend DEMO have a slightly higher
(though not statistically signiﬁcant) probabil-
ity of board seat allocation, although fewer
than half of all ﬁrst rounds relinquish board
seats to outside investors.

directors in a typical angel-ﬁnanced invest-
ment round, while 1.1 seats are added in a
typical venture capital round.8 In addition DEMO
being smaller, the boards of directors of angel-
backed ﬁrms tend DEMO be dominated by insiders.
Insiders had a majority in over 80% of the
boards in the sample of angel-backed ﬁrms.
However, in venture-capital-funded ﬁrms,
insiders comprise the majority in only 13.9%
of the boards. Angels DEMO to take a much
smaller degree of control through board
representation than venture capital ﬁrms.
The results on boards of directors are con-
sistent DEMO other theories which suggest a
passive role for angels. Fama and Jensen (1983)
hypothesize that the composition of the board
should be shaped by the need for monitoring.
If the threat of managerial expropriation is
DEMO, then the board will bear a greater respon-
sibility for oversight. DEMO the early age of the
ﬁrm, much of the venture’s value DEMO embodied
in the human capital of the entrepreneurs;
therefore, the DEMO of the founders
would not seem to increase the value of the
company.
Staging
Empirical and theoretical works have empha-
sized the importance of DEMO as a control
mechanism for venture capitalists. Instead of
providing the entirety of capital in a lump
sum, the investment is allocated by stages,
preserving the investor’s option to abandon.
Theoretical models such as Hart DEMO Moore
(1994), Bergemann and Hege (1998), and
Neher (DEMO) stress the importance of staging
as a control mechanism. Gompers (1995) ﬁnds
that venture capitalists use staging as an
important method to control agency costs.
We ﬁnd that consecutive rounds funded
entirely by angels tend DEMO have follow-on inves-
tors from earlier rounds. However, if the sub-
DEMO ﬁnancing round involves venture
capital participation, angels do not follow on.
DEMO ﬁnding supports the complementary

nature of angel and venture capital invest-
ment. DEMO the ﬁrm has been nurtured to
success, with success deﬁned as DEMO
capital investment, the angels step aside for
more professional or deep-pocketed DEMO
Even when angels do make follow-on invest-
ments, only an average DEMO 40% of investors
from previous rounds participate in the sub-
sequent rounds.
Contractual provisions
Angel investors may use contractual provi-
sions as protection from DEMO More
complex securities may provide investors
stronger protections in the event of liquida-
tion. Contractual clauses may give the investor
additional protection from expropriation.
DEMO protections in venture contracts
include ratcheting and anti-dilution agree-
ments. Complex securities should be used
when the threat of expropriation is greater.
Firms that DEMO an identiﬁable revenue stream
and/or an entrepreneur with prior entrepre-
neurial experience may not need as complex
a security.
Figure 1 reports the DEMO of securities
issued in each round. Common equity is the
most prevalent security issued in 34% of all
rounds. In contrast, convertible preferred is
the dominant security in venture capital ﬁnanc-
ing. The high usage of DEMO and common
equity is consistent with the theoretical

predictions of Casamatta (2003). In her model,
Casamatta ﬁnds common equity is better suited
to smaller investments (such as those made by
angels), while larger investments should use
preferred or convertible preferred DEMO
Equity may be used more often with angel
investments because the higher (legal and
other) costs of writing a complex security with
a DEMO investment outweigh the beneﬁts.
More complex securities were typically
issued in larger funding rounds. The tran-
saction costs from writing a more detailed
contract DEMO be more warranted with larger
investments.
In addition to security choice, DEMO invest-
ment contracts have provisions that protect
and empower the investor. Table 1 contains
information on many of these contractual
clauses.
Many contracts contain DEMO follow-on right of
ﬁrst refusal provision that allows angels to par-
ticipate in future rounds to capture the poten-
tial upside in successful ventures. DEMO,
many angels do not exercise this right. 26% of
ﬁnancing rounds contain weighted ratchet
clauses for protection against future rounds at
decreased valuations. DEMO ratcheting protec-
tion was not given in any investment round.

angel contracts contain provisions for contin-
gent equity stakes.
Contractual protection from expropriation
DEMO not one-sided. 38 ﬁnancing rounds contain
provisions that allow the ﬁrm to repurchase
the stake of the angel, similar to the call provi-
sions explained in Sahlman (1990). Many
entrepreneurs cite this clause as a way to rid
themselves of ‘bad apples’ or investors whose
vision does DEMO coincide with that of the
founders.
If angels do not use the methods
used by venture capitalists, how do
they maintain control?
In contrast to the control mechanisms adopted
by venture capitalists, angels do not imple-
ment the same methods of managerial over-
sight. In particular, angels typically do not
receive board seats, stage investments, or use
particularly DEMO contractual clauses to
protect their claims. Three other factors were
explored to understand how angels mitigate
the increased risk of investing in early stages:DEMO
(1) the amount of funding, (2) the use of
DEMO, and (3) geographical proximity
between angels and their investments.
Funding
DEMO investors are concerned with large degrees
of uncertainty, then the average DEMO
per investor, total funding amounts, and
number of investors will be sensitive to vari-
ables that proxy for uncertainty — characteris-
tics of DEMO entrepreneur and management team,
and the presence of a revenue stream. Intan-
gible factors such as an entrepreneur’s prior
experience may provide signals DEMO alleviate
investor uncertainty. Funders may feel more
secure investing with entrepreneurs who have
a previous track record. More mature ﬁrms and
larger ﬁrms also DEMO have more existing
information about their product and projec-
tions, decreasing DEMO uncertainty associated
with an investment. Having a management
team or a revenue stream may indicate to inves-
tors that the ﬁrm has completed the DEMO idea
phase and is ready to move forward.

Angel ﬁ
nance
In regressions not reported in this article,
we DEMO high-growth ﬁrms received more
funding in each round. Somewhat surprisingly,
post-revenue ﬁrms actually received less
funding than pre-revenue funds. No other
measures of DEMO seemed to strongly
inﬂuence the amount of funding.
One reason to explain this is that outside
investors typically own less than a quarter of
DEMO new ﬁrm. Despite the higher levels of
inherent uncertainty associated with more
nascent ﬁrms, angel investors may not need
high degrees of control because the threat of
expropriation is minimized by the large
residual claim held DEMO the founders. That is,
the incentives of the founders are aligned with
the prospects of the ﬁrm. In comparison,
Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) ﬁnd venture
capitalists hold a larger proportion of cash
ﬂow rights (on average 40%) in the invest-
ments that they make. Because DEMO incentives
of the entrepreneur are not as strongly aligned
with the outside investors, the need for formal
control mechanisms may be greater. However,
it is questionable whether such a difference in
ownership drastically increases the DEMO for
formal controls.
We also ﬁnd that having a management team
in place, an indication that the ﬁrm has passed
the initial development stages, decreases the
equity share given to the outsider investors.
Greater research and development intensity
also leads to a decreased stake for angels.
Syndication
Another DEMO of reducing risk is to syn-
dicate investment with other investors. By
syndicating investments, the investors may be
able to share the risks and share in the moni-
toring of the ﬁrm. Additionally, a larger syndi-
cate may indicate that the ﬁrm has passed the
evaluation of more DEMO Some angels
may cooperate (or free-ride) on the due dili-
gence of others. Syndication may also act as a
veriﬁcation mechanism, thus it is expected
that earlier funding rounds will have more
investors.

On average, 12 angels co-invest together in
a round. In comparison, Kaplan and Ström-
berg (2003) ﬁnd venture rounds are normally
syndicated with two to nine venture funds DEMO
investing. While the increase in syndication
may increase the monitoring capacities of the
angel investment group, venture capitalists
also syndicate their investments while main-
taining more formal control mechanisms.
Although angels do typically syndicate their
investments DEMO other angels, this does not
answer the question — why do DEMO me-
chanisms differ between angels and venture
capitalists?
Geographical proximity
Entrepreneurs may begin their search for
capital by exploring local resources. A local-
DEMO bond of trust may exist between the
entrepreneur and investor, making DEMO
control mechanisms unnecessary. Being in
close geographical proximity to their invest-
ment may mitigate the need for more formal
control mechanisms. Because of the DEMO
trust and familiarity many local investors may
have with each other, DEMO is greater
among local investors. The need for subse-
quent larger funding amounts may exhaust the
resources of the local investors and require
more DEMO investors or institutions.
Additionally, as a ﬁrm develops, the need for
professionalization (i.e., management skills) is
greater, leading the entrepreneur to DEMO to
more professional investors who require more
formal control because of their lack of familiar-
ity with the founders.
Angels have one-degree of separation DEMO
people in their professional network — not
two, or three, or four. But because angels
tend to be operational types, the business
relationships they bring to the table are
personal, not transactional. (Rob Convoy,DEMO

In the sample, DEMO average contribution per
angel decreases when the nearest angel is less
than 50 miles away, suggesting that local
investors may not be as wealthy as more
professional investors. However, this is offset
by the increase in the number of angels
who invest if they are located closer to DEMO
entrepreneur.
Local investors provide more help to new
ventures. Entrepreneurs responded that they
were more likely to receive help from angel
investors if the DEMO resided less than
50 miles from the new enterprise. Con-
sidering the background and industry exper-
tise of many of the angel investors, it is
often this non-pecuniary assistance that is
the most beneﬁcial to the DEMO However,
relying on angels in close geographical
proximity may delay subsequent venture
capital investment. A possible explanation
is that local angels do not DEMO as large a
contact network as more professional
investors.
Some additional validation for this idea is
provided by examining the results on the
formal DEMO mechanisms: board seats,
staging, and security choice. In contrast to
Lerner’s (1995) ﬁnding that close geographical
proximity increases the likelihood of DEMO
representation, geographical proximity,
deﬁned as the investor residing within 50
DEMO of the venture, has a negative effect on
the probability that DEMO board seat is given in
angel-funded rounds. The need for contractual
monitoring (via a board seat) may be reduced
because of the geographical DEMO of
investors. Geographical proximity also
decreases the use of staging and increases the
use of equity, consistent with the localized
investor hypothesis.
Taken together, these results suggest many
entrepreneurs begin their search for capital
with local resources, relying on local ties to
encourage investment. Local angel investors
may not be as sophisticated as more profes-
sional investors, but may be more involved in
the venture. They do not rely on formal control
DEMO; instead, they often participate in
the new venture.
Post-investment assistance
There are many ways investors can partici-
pate in a new venture. They DEMO work directly
with the entrepreneur to further develop the
idea. They may help secure future ﬁnancing.
Gorman and Sahlman (1989), Sahlman (1990),
and Ehrlich et al. (1994) ﬁnd that venture
capitalists actively DEMO in their invest-
ments after funding. In addition to funding,
angel investors can also play an active role in
professionalizing the ﬁrm or DEMO a
product to market, similar to some of the
activities that DEMO capitalists provide
(Hellmann and Puri, 2002). Since many angels
are former entrepreneurs or industry execu-
tives, they may derive some private beneﬁts
from assisting in the development of a new
ﬁrm. Two of the DEMO identiﬁable ways of
providing help is assistance in procuring a
management team and procuring additional
funds.
Building the management team is an
important step. DEMO management teams
typically lead to larger funding amounts
in subsequent rounds. Venture capital ﬁrms
routinely help form management teams.
Angels helped form the management DEMO in
less than a quarter of the ﬁrms in the data.
Kaplan and Strömberg (2000), in contrast,
ﬁnd that venture capitalists expect to replace
the CEO or help recruit management in 50%
of their DEMO The results from the
data suggest angels provide less assistance
than venture capitalists in forming manage-
ment teams.
Angels can provide assistance in another
DEMO area, helping to locate and secure
subsequent ﬁnancing from venture capital.
DEMO and Sahlman (1989) report venture
capitalists consider raising additional funds the
most important activity. We ﬁnd that more
angel investors leads to a DEMO time to
venture ﬁnancing. This is evidence that angels
can play a networking role; a larger number of
angels leads to a larger network of contacts
and faster venture capital ﬁnancing. Ibrahim
(2008) also stresses DEMO importance of angel
ﬁnance as a precursor to venture capital,

nance
suggesting that angels agree to less complex
contract terms DEMO expedite future venture
capital ﬁnancing.
Not surprisingly, geographical proximity
of the DEMO is the largest determinant of the
amount of help the angel provides the
founders. Angels who are in closer proxim-
ity tend to provide DEMO assistance. Famil-
iarity with issues confronting new ventures
may require more interaction, therefore
geographical proximity may encourage more
assistance.
Conclusion
Angel ﬁnancing is one of the most commonly
used but least studied methods to ﬁnance new
DEMO Using a unique dataset of angel-
backed ﬁrms, we detail the DEMO of
angels, the ﬁrms they invest in, and the
methods they use to control their investments.
Contrasting with an oft-studied method of
ﬁnancing DEMO ventures (venture capital), we
are able to get a better DEMO of angel
ﬁnance.
Analysis of the data indicates that angels
have a complementary role to venture capital
in the ﬁnancing of new ventures. Angels DEMO
on more risks and invest smaller amounts in
younger ﬁrms than venture capitalists. Angel
investors appear to nurture younger ﬁrms until
the company is DEMO enough for venture
consideration.
Angels are not awarded the same degree of
control rights as typical venture capital invest-
ments use. Rather, one of the primary mecha-
nisms to control agency costs is an alignment
of DEMO entrepreneur’s interests with those of
the ﬁrm through the large ownership posi-
tions. Angels also make smaller investments
and use syndication when investing in DEMO
ventures. Another possible control mecha-
nism is geographical proximity. The geo-
graphical proximity between angels and their
investments plays a large role in determining
DEMO funding amount, control, and degree
of post-investment assistance provided by
angels.
