The present research was designed to assess the effect of two variables as
they affect the use of nonlinear, noncompensatory models in decision making.
These two variables were type of decision task and amount DEMO information.
The former variable was found to have a marked effect on the kind of com-
bination model used by subjects, while the latter variable had a significant
effect on the accuracy with which the various DEMO could adequately rep-
resent the decision process. The major findings showed considerable use of
the nonlinear, noncompensatory models with differential use in the two de-
cision tasks used. The results for amount of information suggest that DEMO
use complex combinations of models (or compound models) in order to
simplify the situation cognitively. In addition, the claim that decision
makers do not use additive models in their strategies is given support by
these DEMO
INTRODUCTION
A major problem in decision making is understanding the methods by
which people combine information to make evaluative decisions. The com-
bining process DEMO typically been conceptualized in terms of a linear
model in which components are added together to form an overall eval-
uation. Consequently, linear regression techniques have commonly been
used to approximate the cognitive processes underlying decision DEMO
The use of this model implies that the decision maker somehow adds to-
gether component cues in order to come to some overall evaluation DEMO
decision.
The use of a linear model to approximate the methods by which de-
cision makers combine information has been suggested by many re-
DEMO Anderson (1958), for example, has used an "averaging" model
in dealing with impression and attitude formation; Hammond and asso-
ciates (DEMO, Hammond, 1955; I-Iammond, Hursch, & Todd, 1964; Ham-
DEMO & Summers, 1965; Hursch, Hammond, & I.iursch, 1964) have in-

vestigated the combining of component cues using Brunswik'DEMO lens model
as the theoretical basis for their work, and Naylor DEMO associates (e.g.,
Dudyeha & Naylor, 1966a, 1966b; Naylor & Schenek, 19'68) have also
used the Brunswikian framework. In the DEMO decision making area,
Hoffman and his associates (e.g., Itoffman, DEMO, 1968; tIoffman, Slovie,
& Rorer, 1968; Slovic, 1966), have dealt with the use of linear models for
combining clinical DEMO
The general finding from these and other researchers has been that
the linear model provides a good fit for the obtained data (Goldberg,
1968). One reason for this good fit of the linear model DEMO many different
areas of decision making may be that the linear model can still provide a
very good approximation even when there are significant DEMO rela-
tionships in the data (Yntema & Torgerson, 1961). Furthermore, the re-
search that has dealt with nonlinear models has typically shown that
nonlinear germs add little to the explained variance of judgments. Few
DEMO have shown the general superioriey of the nonlinear methods for
combining information. In those studies that do show nonlinear use, the
results have generally not been impressive (e.g., Wiggins & Hoffman,
1968; however, DEMO Slovic, 1969).
Given the large amount of research supporting the DEMO of the linear
model in a variety of situations, it would DEMO that the persistent search
for nonlinear methods used by decision makers would be abandoned.
However, the search continues for some of the following reasons: (1)
Decision makers do not believe that they are using DEMO models in their
cognitive activity. This seems to be especially true for clinical decision
makers who feel that nonlinear models should be more representative DEMO
what they say they are doing. (2) Although the bulk of the research does
favor the linear model there is some research showing DEMO of nonlinear
methods for combining information. (3) The exact nature of the nonlinear
models that are being used by decision makers should be DEMO explicit,
since this would lead to greater accuracy in the quantification of cogni-
give processes in decision making.
NONLINEAR COMBINATION MODELS
While researchers DEMO dealt with the linear model, there are other
data-combination models available. DEMO and Kao (1955), Coombs
(1964), and Dawes (1964a, 1964b) have specified what they have called
nonlinear, noncompensatory models for DEMO information. These
models, viz., the conjunctive, disjunctive, and lexieographic were hereto-
fore primarily eonceptuaI and not specified mathematically. Using a
theoretical model DEMO on utility assumptions, precise mathematical
functions have been developed to approximate DEMO the conjunctive and

disjunctive models (Einhorn, 1970). For the disjunctive model the
formulation involved the following equation:
N

where

i=1
i=i
U = utility of the multidimensional stimulus (height of the response
surface);
DEMO = variables or component cues;
a~ = some arbitrary value above the asymptotic level;
b~ = weighting factors for the variables or DEMO
The disjunctive model is here approximated by a hyperbolic response
surface. The use of this surface provides that a stimulus objee~ will have
a DEMO utility if it contains an extremely high score on only one of the
attributes. This is consistent with the disjunctive model since a stimulus
DEMO mus~ have a high score on at least one attribute to have a high
utility. The value for a~ is set arbitrarily above the DEMO value of X~,
and b~ can be found by a least squares technique such as multiple regres-
sion (after the log transformation has been performed).
For the conjunctive model the formulation involved a parabolic DEMO
sponse surface,

(2)
In the conjunctive model the highest utility occurs when there are equal
amounts for the variables X~ so that DEMO approximation approaches a
multiple cutoff procedure (no compensation is allowed for)DEMO
These two models can be fitted to data by using a least squares proce-
dure such as multiple regression in order to obtain the DEMO param-
eters. Once these weights are obtained, one can cross-validate on DEMO
sample. This was done in a preliminary study which showed that pre-
dictions made from the nonlinear models correlated significantly higher
with the criterion DEMO actual judgments than predictions made from the
linear model (Einhorn, 1969).
Objectives
The present research focused on two variables as they were DEMO to
affect the use of the various models. The first variable was the type of
decision task or problem. In talking about cognitive structures DEMO the
integration of information, Sehroder, Driver, and Streufert (1967) DEMO
I-IILLEL J. EINHORN
stated "The problem in regard to task properties may be stated as fol-
lows: what characteristics of tasks produce similar effects on intervening
structure and, consequently, on the differentiation and integration in-
DEMO in behavior [p. 31] ?" These authors view information processing
behavior DEMO an interactive process between environmental and individual
factors, so that one DEMO investigate the role of task dimensions on the
possible use of different strategies in decision making. An example of the
possible effects of the DEMO come from Webster (196Â¢). In dealing with
the interview situation, Webster found that interviewers look for negative
information on which to disqualify DEMO applicant. This search for negative
information is similar to using a conjunctive model since the subject is
evaluated on his minimum ability. One reason DEMO the use of such a model
can be traced back to the fact that the cost of a false positive to the
interviewer is DEMO If the cost of a false positive is high, one might DEMO
peer greater use of a conjunctive model as compared with a linear model,
since under the former model the probability of failure because DEMO an
excessive lack of an ability is smaller than under the linear model. There-
fore, where the cost of a false positive is high to the decision maker, a
conjunctive model may be used more often. (One might compare the costs
of false positives and false negatives with the concept of "noxity" used
by Schroder et al., while "DEMO" might correspond to "eueity.") Other
possible factors in the decision task might include: Involvement of the
decision maker, amount of payoff, familiarity of the task to the decision
maker, and complexity of the task.
The second factor thought to affect the use of the various DEMO was
the amount of information presented to the decision maker. Many re-
searchers have felt that when there is a great deal of information, the
decision maker has to somehow simplify the situation (Simon, 1955;DEMO
Miller, 1956; Garner, 1962; Yntema & Torgerson, 1961). DEMO (1968),
in a review of the literature dealing with clinical decision making, has
suggested that the linear model implies a simple cognitive process.
However, one must make a conceptual distinction between a model's
mathematical simplicity and the cognitive processes it purports
to represent. It may DEMO that the linear model is mathematically simple,
but this in no way implies that it is easy to use eognitively. This is an
DEMO important distinction, since the use of the nonlinear, noncom-
pensatory models, although more complex mathematically, may in fact
be easier to use DEMO Simon (1955) has suggested, for example, that
one way to simplify a complex decision task might be to use a cutoff-type
procedure. DEMO is a conjunctive model, which although more complex
mathematically than the DEMO model, may be easier to use eognitively.
Accordingly, it was hypothesized that as the decision maker is given more
NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS
5
information on which to base his decisions--approaching an information
overload condition he would be more likely to use the nonlinear, non-
compensatory models than the linear model. If, however, Goldberg and
DEMO are correct, then one should expect increased use of the linear DEMO
as the amount of information is increased.
METHOD
Tasks
Two separate tasks were used in this research project. The first task
involved a job DEMO decision problem. Subjects were presented with
various jobs within their own occupation and were given a certain amount
of information about each job. They DEMO then asked to choose among
these jobs (for themselves) on the basis of the information about each
job. The second decision problem consisted DEMO choosing among applicants
to graduate school in psychology. Again, information was DEMO con-
cerning each of the candidates. The two tasks required special subject
populations. The first task required subjects who had made an occupa-
tional DEMO while subjects in the second task had to be faculty members
or admissions officials in psychology departments.
Subjects
For the job preference study, subjects who had made occupational
choices were needed. This was accomplished by obtaining DEMO who
were working toward either an M.B.A. (N = 24) degree or an M.A. de-
gree in industrial engineering (N ~- 15). The total sample size was there-
fore N ---- 39. All subjects DEMO made occupational choices and were work-
ing during the day at their respective jobs.
For the graduate selection study, subjects were faculty members and
last year graduate students in psychology. Faculty members came from
three universities DEMO the area (N-=-26). In addition, four final-year
graduate students who had just received their Ph.D. degrees were also
included, thereby making the total sample size N = 30.
Experimental Procedure
For the iob preference DEMO, subjects were asked to complete the task
in group sessions lasting DEMO an hour. Subjects could take as much time
as they deemed necessary to complete the task. The experimental situa-
tion consisted of presenting 15 DEMO jobs to the subject and then
asking him to rank order the jobs in terms of his preference for them.
Once this had been DEMO, a second set of jobs was also presented
and the subject DEMO asked to rank order the new set of experimental
6

stimuli. The experimental stimuli were selected so that DEMO would hope-
fully show differences between the use of the various models if sueh dif-
ferences existed. This point has been elaborated elsewhere (Einhorn,
1970), but is relevant here since the stimuli cannot be DEMO a ran-
dom sample of all possible values for the stimuli.
The experimental conditions consisted of presenting varying amounts of
information to the decision DEMO by having either two, four, or six pieces
of information per hypothetical stimulus, i.e., the dimensionality of the
stimuli was varied from DEMO to six attributes. For the two-attribute con-
dition, amount of money DEMO the chance to use special interests and
abilities were presented. For the four-variable condition, the first two
were used in addition to location and the lack of close supervision. For
the six-variable ease, flexibility of hours and social relationships with
co-workers were used in addition to the preceding DEMO Each of these
variables was presented in the form of a seven-point scale. This scale
varied from (1) Greatly below average, to (DEMO) Greatly above average,
with a middle point of (4) DEMO Since all the subjects had made an
occupational choice, the ratings DEMO the different attributes referred to
jobs in that occupation. For example, DEMO rating of (4) on amount of money
meant that this job pays an average amount for this particular
occupation.
Subjects were randomly assigned DEMO one of the three information con-
ditions. They were instructed to rank order the 15 jobs according to their
preference. A second sample of DEMO was then presented to serve as the
cross-validation sample. However, a DEMO cross-validation procedure
was used so that each set of data served as the cross-validation sample
for the other set. After subjects finished the second DEMO of stimuli, they
were asked to rate the importance of each DEMO the attributes making up
the stimuli to their decision making on an eight-point scale. It was em-
phasized that the importance rating should reflect DEMO the subject used
the attributes ir~ this tadc, not how he DEMO about the attributes in general.
Finally, the subject was asked to DEMO out a post-experimental question-
naire that dealt with questions concerning the difficulty of the task,
fatigue effects, and the interest and motivation for doing the task. More-
over, the subject was asked to indicate any strategy that he felt he might
have used in completing the task. DEMO was hoped that this would lead to
greater insight into how decision makers formulate strategies in complex
decisions of this type.
Essentially the same DEMO was used in the graduate selection
study. In this ease, faculty DEMO were given the experimental materials
and were asked to complete them within two weeks. The return rate was
65%. Using the same paradigm, the subjects were presented with 15 hy-

pothetieai candidates to graduate school in psychology. They were asked
to rank order the candidates in terms of their acceptability DEMO the
graduate program. After they did this they were presented with a second
set of candidates and were asked to rank order this set. DEMO experimental
conditions again consisted of presenting the decision maker with either
two, four, or six pieces of information per stimulus. In the two-attribute
DEMO the information consisted of the Verbal (V) and Quantitative
(Q) scores on the Graduate Record Examination expressed as percentiles.
For the four-attribute DEMO the variables were V, Q, grade point
average (G.P.A.) on a four-point scale, and status of the undergraduate
school. The latter variable was expressed on a seven-point scale and was
presented as ratings of DEMO schools by the association of university pro-
fessors. For the six-attribute ease, the previous four attributes were used
in addition to the number of science courses the candidate had taken in
undergraduate school and the applicant'DEMO score on the psychology portion
of the G.R.E.
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three information
conditions. It should be noted DEMO, that there was greater difficulty
in obtaining responses to the task DEMO there were six attributes per
stimulus. This necessitated handing out proportionally more question-
naires for this condition in order to have equal cell frequencies DEMO the
three information conditions. After the subject completed the rankings on
the two data sets, he rated the importance of the attributes and completed
the post-experimental questionnaire.
Statistical Analysis
For each of the models, a linear regression procedure was used to find
the best fitting beta weights for DEMO of the attributes. For the conjunctive
and disjunctive models, the log DEMO variables were fitted by
means of the regression technique. After these weights were obtained,
they were applied to the new set of data DEMO order to obtain a predicted
ranking on the new sample. Since there were two separate samples on
which to obtain weights, a double cross-validation procedure was used,
i.e., the weights from each sample were applied to the other sample in
order to obtain a predicted ranking. Two DEMO were thus obtained
of the goodness-of-fit for the particular weights that were obtained on
each of the original samples.
Since we were dealing with DEMO transformed variables, the original scale
of the ranks is of considerable DEMO Thus, if one chose to rank the
15 stimulus objects from DEMO to 115 instead of from 1 to 15, the log trans-
DEMO of the former would be quite different from the log transforms of the
latter. Since, for our purposes, it makes no difference whether DEMO actual
8
HYLLEL J. EINttORN
ranks are designated by 1 to 15 or DEMO other set of numbers (the scale is
purely arbitrary), the DEMO results should be independent of the choice
of the original ranking scale. For the linear model, the use of different
scales will have no effect on the correlation since the linear correlation is
invariant over a DEMO transformation. However, when the variables are
transformed by logarithms, the choice of original scale will seriously
affect the correlation. In this study, ranks from 1 to 15 were used, with 1
representing the highest rank. If the log of the ranks is correlated with
the weighted sum DEMO the logs of the attributes, the relationship will be
curvilinear (although monotonic). This occurs because successive differ-
enees between the logs of DEMO numbers 1 to 15 as one goes from 1 to 15 de-
creases, i.e., the slope of the log function is decreasing so DEMO the smallest
differences are between 14 and 15 and the largest differences are between
1 and 2. This distortion of the scale causes the DEMO sum of the at-
tributes to be a curvilinear function of the log of the ranks, with a sub-
sequent lowering of the linear correlation, even if the actual ranks were
a linear function of the weighted attributes.
In order to control for this effect, the predicted rankings were them-
selves ranked and this ranking was compared with the actual DEMO by
means of Spearman's rho. This procedure yields a rectangular distribution
for both the actual and predicted rankings. Since the rank order correla-
DEMO is invariant over a monotonic transformation (such as the log trans-
DEMO), this circumvents the problem of the particular scale one
chooses for the ranks when they are transformed into the log scale. The
Spearman DEMO, therefore, indicate the degree of monotonic relationship
between the actual ranks and the rank order of the predicted ranks.
In order to make DEMO between the different models, the Spear-
man rho was also calculated DEMO the linear model by ranking the predicted
ranks and correlating this with the actual ranks.
There are two other reasons for using the rank DEMO correlation. The
first concerns the interpretability of the predicted ranks. For all models,
on double cross-validation, one can obtain ranks that have decimal values,
negative values, and positive values beyond the number of ranks used.
This happens because in the regression analysis, the rank scMe is treated
as an interval scale that is not bounded at either end. DEMO cross-validation,
the predicted scores can take on impossible values. For this reason, the
rank of the predicted scores is preferred, since this DEMO an interpretable
ranking from each model that can be compared with the actual ranking.
The second reason for using the rank order correlation involves DEMO
fact that the two variables being correlated will have the same distribu-
tion, i.e., rectangular. As Carroll (1961) has pointed out, the magnitude
of the correlation coefficient is affected by the disparity of the DEMO
NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS 9
distributions of the two variables. If these distributions are dissimilar the
maximum correlation is reduced so that the limits of DEMO correlation co-
efficient are constrained. Carroll further distinguishes between latent and
manifest relationships between variables, the former being the true rela-
tionship between the variables, and the latter being the observed relation-
ship. The latent relationship can be distorted by errors of scaling, errors
of scale-dependent selection, DEMO errors of measurement. The use of Spear-
man's rho by resealing the predicted ranks to obtain a predicted ranking
for each model would DEMO a way to avoid an error of scaling. As Carroll
has stated, "It seems reasonable to assert that the kinds of adjustments
that DEMO to be made to estimate the degree of latent relationship must be
selected in the light of the investigator's analysis of what kinds DEMO errors
are to be adjusted for [p. 357]."
RESULTS: JOB DEMO STUDY
Table 1 presents the validities obtained on double cross-validation for
each subject for each of the models and for both data sets. Since DEMO
were two separate sets and three models, six rank order correlations DEMO
obtained for each person. Each correlation is a Spearman rank order
correlation representing the degree of relationship between the predicted
and actual ranks.
In DEMO to assess whether the linear or nonlinear models provided a
better fit for the data, several statistical tests were conducted. The first
two tests compared only the linear and conjunctive models, since the
disjunctive model yielded generally low correlations in all information
conditions. The first analysis consisted of DEMO sign test for the direction of
differences obtained for the linear and conjunctive models. It was thought
that the direction of the differences over DEMO large number of eases might
be interpreted as showing the superiority of one model over the other.
A z = 4.3 (p < .0001) was obtained for the first sample, reflecting the fact
that the DEMO model was higher than the linear in 32 of the 37
cases. For the second sample the results showed a z = 3.6, which is also
significant at p < .0001 (conjunctive higher in 29 of 36 cases).
The second analysis consisted of comparing the two models DEMO terms
of the proportion of statistically significant correlations (at p < DEMO) that
were obtained for each of the two double cross-validated samples. DEMO
Spearman rho needed for significance at the .05 level for N = 15, is r~
.55. The proportion of significant correlations for the coniunctive model
was 66/78, while for the linear model it was 58/78. A z test for correlated
proportions indicated that the proportion of DEMO correlations ob-
tained by using the coniunctive model was significantly higher than the
proportion obtained by using the linear model (z = 2.21, DEMO < .05),

The third analysis consisted of a three-way analysis DEMO variance (3 X
3 X 2) with repeated measures on the last two factors. The three factors
were: (A) Amount of information (three levels--two, four, or six pieces
of information); (B) Models (three levels--linear, conjunctive, or dis-
junctive); (C) Samples (two levels--weights from sample 1 applied to
sample 2 or vice versa). Factors B and C were repeated since every sub-
ject received DEMO model and sample. The dependent variable in the
analysis was the correlation between the actual and predicted ranks.
These correlations were first transformed to DEMO's z so that the actual
dependent variable was the transformed correlation. The summary table
for the analysis is presented in Table 2.

The three main effects for A, B, and C are all significant. In addition,
there are two significant interactions, A X C and B X C. In order to. ex-
amine these DEMO more carefully, the cell means for all combinations of
the factors DEMO given in Table 3.
For the first main effect, the difference DEMO the two-piece vs the
four- and six-piece condition accounts for the significant F ratio. For the
B factor, the mean for the conjunctive model is highest (.854), the linear
model mean is next (.795), and the disjunctive model had the lowest
mean (.530). Post DEMO analyses showed that the differences between
all pairwise comparisons for the models were significant. For the C effect
(samples), Table 3 indicates that the mean correlation obtained for data
from the second sample using the DEMO from the first sample is higher
than when the opposite procedure is applied (.790 vs .720).
The A X C interaction (information-by-samples) shows that there are

large differences between the samples in DEMO A1 condition (two pieces of
information), but these differences are DEMO smaller in the four- and six-
piece conditions. The B X C interaction (models-by-samples) shows that
there are large differences between the samples DEMO all but the disjunctive
model. For this model the difference between the samples is very small.
The data presented thus far are concerned with DEMO effects of the various
independent variables over the entire group of subjects. Since individual
analyses are deemed essential in this type of study, tIotelling's t test for
correlated correlations was performed for each subject. This DEMO is used
to test for the significance of the difference between correlations of a cri-
terion with each of two other variables when both DEMO the variables are
themselves correlated. The criterion was the actual ranking obtained
from each subject, while the two variables were the predictions derived
from the two different models. The results for the t tests are given DEMO
Table 4,
The "t" value for rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference between
the models was set at 1.782, which yields a p < .10 for a two-tailed test.
The reason for setting DEMO alpha level at .10 was to increase the power
of the test to detect differences between the models. Using this analysis,
16 significant DEMO favored the coniunctive model, while the linear
was higher than the DEMO in five cases. The remainder of the tests
were not significant. These results point to the value of using individual
analyses, since the previous results could be misinterpreted to imply that
all subjects used a conjunctive DEMO Subjects 3, 24, 29, and 35 all seem
to be DEMO a linear model, although this is lost in the group analyses. DEMO
though only 21 of the 78 analyses proved to be significant, DEMO direction of
the tests is consistently in favor of the conjunctive model (as would be
expected by the results of the previously described sign test).

The final analysis concerns the ratings of difficulty DEMO the task. The
mean ratings of difficulty showed that the task was perceived as more
difficult as the amount of information was increased. For DEMO two-, four-,
and six-piece conditions, the mean ratings were 3.31, 3.54, and 3.92,
respectively.
DISCUSSION: JOB PREFERENCE
STUDY
One of the most striking findings of this study concerns the extremely
high correlations DEMO on double cross-validation for the three models
dealt with. Examination of Table 1, as well as Table 3, shows that these
models are DEMO to a high degree. This would indicate that the
mathematical model approach can provide a reasonably accurate and
efficient method for the study of DEMO judgmental processes. Correla-
tions of such magnitude are at least presumptive evidence concerning the
cognitive models these subjects were using for processing information.
In DEMO the linear and nonlinear models, the disiunetive model
was not included DEMO all the analyses. The reason for this was that the dis-
junctive model did not consistently provide high correlations and was
therefore not adequate DEMO representing the nonlinear models in a com-
parison with the linear model. IIowever, the disiunctive model was in-
cluded in the overall analysis of variance, where it yielded significantly
poorer predictions than the other two models. The mean correlation for
the disjunctive model was .53, which is not significant at the .05 level. For
the individual analyses it should be DEMO noted that in cases where the
disjunctive model did provide a good fit to the data, the linear model
correlated higher with the actual rankings, so that inclusion of the dis-
junetive model would not have changed the results or their implications.
The results for all the tests, individual as well as group, point to the
superiority of the conjunctive model in this task. One might ask why
people in general (although not all) seem to use a conjunctive model
rather than a linear model in this task. Choosing a iob may be more likely
to DEMO a conjunctive solution, since one may have certain minimum
standards on DEMO number of attributes, less than which one is unwilling to
accept. DEMO, the cost of a false positive in this situation would
be DEMO to be high, i.e., choosing a job that turns out poorly would
involve a high cost to the decision maker. This aspect of DEMO decision task
might lead to greater use of the conjunctive model. The poor showing of
the disiunetive model can probably also be attributed to DEMO kind of task
used, since it would seem unlikely that having DEMO great deal of one attribute
would be enough, by itself, to give a job a very high utility. In comparing
the linear and DEMO models, it appears that compensation for lack
NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS
15
of an attribute by having an over-abundance of another is not perceived
as having as much utility as having at DEMO a certain minimum level on
each of the attributes. In fact, DEMO subjects were asked to write any
strategy they were consciously aware of, many of them expressed the idea
of trying to find a "DEMO" between the attributes. For example, a
rating of 5-5 for two attributes was seen as preferable to a rating of 7-3.
Although both DEMO to 10, the product of the first term is higher and DEMO
consistent with the use of a conjunctive model.
These results also bear on the controversy involving the use of interac-
tions and configurations vs DEMO use of main effects in clinical judgment.
The present results suggest that the use of interactions and complex con-
figurations is widespread in the DEMO process. The relative superior-
ity" of the conjunctive model in each DEMO condition involved the
largest interaction term possible, i.e., if each of the attributes was con-
sidered a factor in predicting the judgments, an interaction would be ex-
pressed as a multiplieative function of the attributes. DEMO the two-, four-,
and six-piece conditions, the conjunctive formulation used the two-, four-,
and six-way interaction, respectively. The unique feature DEMO the present
formulation was the relative weighting of each of the attributes making
up the interaction. Since both the linear and conjunctive models used DEMO
same number of parameters in order to obtain the original best fit, and
since the weighting of the interaction term produced the better fit for the
obtained data, it is at least some evidence for the clinician's claims that
something other than a linear model is being DEMO Again, the results here
are specific to this task. However, if nonlinear, noncompensatory models
are being used in the types of tasks clinicians are engaged in (and there is
no reason not to think so), then this result may be applicable to their
activities.
This study DEMO also eoncenaed with the effects of varying amounts of
information on decision making. The results dearly show that the highest
double cross-validities occurred in DEMO two-piece information condition,
while there was no significant difference between the four- and six-piece
conditions. Furthermore, the ratings of difficulty showed that the subjects
did, on the average, perceive the task to be more DEMO as the amount
of information was increased. However, the ratings of DEMO were pre-
sented on a six-point scale, so that ratings of DEMO and 4 represent ratings of
"slightly easy" and "slightly difficult." Thus, although an attempt was
made to make the task progressively more difficult, especially in the six-
piece condition, the subjects still were DEMO to perform the task with rela-
tive ease. Even the six-piece condition produced a rating of 3.94, which is
slightly below the rating "DEMO difficult." Whether these ratings reflee.t
16
HILLEL J. EINI-IOltN
what the subject perceives after he has simplified DEMO situation, or
whether the situation is initially easy, is difficult to answer, since either
interpretation is possible.
The results for "amount of DEMO" poin~ to the fact that one gets
a better fit for DEMO mathematically simpler models when the amount of
information is less. The reasons for this result lie in two possible alterna-
tive explanations. The first DEMO is that subjects are responding
randomly or with more error in the higher information conditions. Some
evidence against this interpretation, however, comes from DEMO sources:
(1) When subjects were asked if they found themselves responding ran-
domly in completing the task, none answered affirmatively; (2) The
ratings of the difficulty of the task would also indicate that the subjects
did not perceive the task to be so difficult that DEMO would be responding
randomly; (3) Evidence of nonrandom responding comes DEMO the de-
seriptions of the strategies the subjects said they were using. Some of
these descriptions showed that the subjects were using complex models
DEMO were combinations of the various models proposed here.
The second alternative explanation concerns the use of complex or com-
pound models in the greater-information DEMO As has been pointed
out, a model's mathematical complexity has DEMO to do with the cognitive
difficulty in using it. The chief evidence for the use of complex models
comes from the descriptions that the DEMO gave of the strategies they
said they were using. Some of these strategies involved sequential use of
the different models for different subsets of DEMO experimental stimuli. If
more complex or compound models are being used, DEMO would tend to lower
the correlations obtained by fitting the simplified models proposed here.
If people tend to simplify the situation as the amount DEMO information is
increased (as most researchers believe), then the use DEMO these complex
models would be seen as a method for cognitive simplification. The lower
correlations in th~ four- and six-piece information condition might there-
DEMO be explained by the use of these more complex models. It may be that
subjects find it easier to use these models as compared DEMO the linear model
in the higher-information conditions. Furthermore, the use of DEMO
models for cognitive simplification would imply an interaction between
amount of information and complexity of the models used.
It was hypothesized that in an DEMO overload condition, the
individual would simplify the situation so as to DEMO all the relevant
information. It was further hypothesized that one way of doing this was
to use the nonlinear, noncompensatory models. Examination of Table 2
shows that the A X B interaction (information-by-models) in the DEMO
of variance is no~ significant. The relative superiority of the coniunctive
model was evident in all information conditions. It would seem therefore,
NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY
MODELS
17
that the model a person uses (in DEMO of the pure models dealt with here)
is more a reflection of the decision maker's underlying utility assumptions
about the attributes and DEMO manner in which they combine than as an
information processing mechanism for simplification.
Another way for the decision maker to simplify the situation is DEMO
ignore some variables completely and focus on only a few variables. The
ratings of importance for each subject for each attribute were collected
and DEMO Unfortunately, there was no consistent pattern of use for
any particular DEMO For some subjects in the four- and six-piece con-
ditions, certain DEMO were ignored, but most subjects indicated that
they were using most DEMO the attributes presented to them. If their verbal
report is accurate, DEMO would tend to increase the likelihood that the use
of more complex models would be the characteristic method for cognitive
simplification.
The third finding DEMO the significant effect for the different samples
used in the double cross-validation. One possible explanation for these
differences might lie in the differences in DEMO correlations between the
attributes in the two different samples. Dudycha and Naylor (1966b),
for example, have found that the cue R matrix very definitely affects the
weighting of the various attributes. However, it is not clear whether one
should expect differences in accuracy of prediction if DEMO correlations are
obtained by double cross-validation.
Another explanation for the sample differences is that on the second
set of data, it is possible that the subiect has finalized any strategy he
may have used or developed DEMO the first set of data. He is more consistent
in his strategy and is less likely to deviate from it. If this were the DEMO,
the actual rankings on the second set would be more consistent with
whatever model is being used, and therefore the correlations with these
rankings as the criterion should be higher. In support of this explanation,DEMO
some subjects, when asked to indicate if they paid less time DEMO the second
set, replied that it took them less time since DEMO had "practice" on the
first set. Furthermore, data from the DEMO study, where decision makers
were familiar with the type of decision DEMO, did not show this samples
effect. This suggests that familiarity with DEMO decision task will play a
part in the decision strategy, and DEMO results using experienced decision
makers may be different from those obtained using inexeperienced decision
makers.
The final results have to do with the two DEMO interactions. The
interaction between samples and information (A X C) showed large dif-
ferences between the samples at A1 (two-piece condition), but not for the
other two-information conditions. This interaction can be explained in
DEMO of the "solidifying" explanation offered for the samples effect. In
18
/:tlLLEL J. E[NI-IORN
the two-piece condition, the relative improvement or solidifying of a
strategy should be expected to take place faster than DEMO the four- and six-
piece condition since there is less information to handle. In addition, there
is less likelihood of having to work out complex models in the two-piece
condition. The interaction shows that "improvement" DEMO greatest in the
two as opposed to the four- and six-piece conditions, although there is
some improvement in all conditions (as indicated by DEMO main effect for
samples).
The second interaction, B X C, showed that there was less difference
in the correlations between samples for DEMO disjunctive model than for the
other two models. The fact that the disjunctive model was generally not
predictive here suggests that the correlations obtained DEMO this model were
essentially random. The fact that there was little "DEMO" for the
disjunctive model as compared to the other models for DEMO different
samples can be explained by these essentially zero correlations.
RESULTS: DEMO SELECTION STUDY
Table 5 presents the validities obtained on double cross-validation.
In contrast to the results for the job preference study, the disjuneeive
model did provide for a good fit to these data. For this reason, the linear
model was here compared with the highest correlation obtained from DEMO
fit of the nonlinear models, i.e., the linear was compared with either the
conjunctive or disjunctive model, depending on which one provided for
the best nonlinear fit of the data.
A sign test was first DEMO to compare the linear and nonlinear models.
The results showed that for the first data set, the nonlinear models had
higher correlations than the linear model in 18 of 28 eases. The obtained
z = 1.3 DEMO not significant at the .05 level. The results for the second
double cross-validated sample showed that the linear model had higher
correlations than the DEMO models in 16 of 28 eases. The obtained
z =--.937 was not significant. These results show that there was no
systematic use of either DEMO linear or nonlinear model in this task.
In order to further verify these results, the linear model was compared
with the conjunctive model in terms of the proportion of statistically
significant correlations obtained under each model. DEMO obtained z = .667
was not significant (linear had 51/60 DEMO the conjunctive had 48/60).
The third analysis was a 3 X 3 )< 2 analysis of variance, which was
exactly the DEMO as that used in the job preference study. The summary
table for ~his analysis is presented in Table 6.
Examination of the table shows DEMO the A effect (amount of informa-
tion) and the B effect (models) were both significant at the .01 level. In
addition, there were two significant interactions, A ;K C and A X B. DEMO

The final DEMO concern the ratings of importance and the difficulty
of the task. These ratings show that the task was perceived to be more
difficult as DEMO number of pieces of information was increased. The mean
ratings of difficulty for the two-, four-, and six-piece conditions were
4.0, 5.0, DEMO 5.2, respectively. In addition, the average ratings of diffi-
culty for this task over all information conditions were significantly
higher than those for DEMO job preference study (t = 4.07, p < .01).
DISCUSSION: GRADUATE SELECTION STUDY
In terms of the use of the various models, it can be seen that there was
considerable diversity for these subjects. The group analyses all showed
that no one model was consistently used DEMO a majority of the subjects.
Neither the sign test nor the comparison of the proportion of significant
correlations for the different models was significant. DEMO, there
was greater use of the disjunctive model here than in DEMO first study.
The group analysis that is of most interest is the three-way analysis of
variance. The effect for the amount of information shows DEMO as subjects
are presented with .more information, the models are generally DEMO ac-
curate in terms of describing the subjects' actual decisions. As DEMO already
been stated with respect to the job preference study, these DEMO correla-
tions have been attributed to the use of complex combinations of models
in these higher-information conditions, although the alternative hypoth-
esis of more error in the subjects' responses has not been fully eliminated.
The lack of an overall difference between the linear and conjunctive
model in this DEMO points to the possible lack of constraint that this task
imposes on the decision strategy. This may be the result of the more
personal DEMO of the lob preference task as compared with selecting
graduate students. The high cost of a false positive in the former ease
might be DEMO likely to result in the use of a conjunctive model as com-
pared with the latter problem.
The lack of a main effect for "samples" suggests the relative expertise
and practice that these subjects bring to the situation as compared to the
relative inexperience with the task for DEMO subjects in the lob preference
study. In terms of the "solidifying" explanation offered for the job prefer-
enee results, the lack of such an effect would be expected for subjects who
have had experience with DEMO task. This lack of a "samples" effect for the
more experienced decision makers further strengthens the "solidifying"
explanation offered for the iob preference results.
NONLINEAR i NONCOMPENSATORY NIODELS 23
The interaction between information and samples (A X C) might be
explained in terms of a fatigue effect that causes greaser use of the com-
plex models in order to simplify DEMO the second sample. The ratings of
the difficulty of the task indicates that this task was perceived as a diffi-
cult one by most DEMO the subjects. The six-piece condition was rated
"moderately difficult," indicating DEMO it may have been an information
overload condition. The interaction shows that for the six-piece condition
only, the second sample yielded lower correlations than the first sample
over all models. If this condition was an overload DEMO, the responses of
the subjects on the second sample may have DEMO determined to a greater
extent by models employing cognitive simplification.
The second interaction concerns the models-by-information (A X B)
effect. It was hypothesized that there would be increased use of the non-
linear, noncompensatory models as the amount of information was in-
creased. This was not supported. DEMO interaction occurs because of the
especially poor fit of the disjunctive model in the six-piece condition. This
poor fit is probably due to the DEMO that when many variables are avail-
able, the disjunctive model is DEMO likely to be used, since this would mean
a greater likelihood DEMO ignoring other variables. In other words, the more
variables there are DEMO consider, the less likely it is that one would want
someone DEMO is extremely high on only one of the variables. If there are
fewer variables to deal with, one can use a disjunctive model with less
chance of ignoring some attribute.
Although the disjunctive model does poorly DEMO the group analyses, the
individual analyses do show that some subjects DEMO using a disjunctive
strategy. In one ease, the verbal statement made DEMO one such subject
indicated that she would rather select someone who was high on some
attribute rather than someone who had less ability on DEMO attributes.
The overall results for the indivdual analyses showed that the nonlinear
models did better than the linear in about half of the cases DEMO signif-
icant differences were obtained. Again, the importance of the individual
DEMO is indicated, since the group tests showed no differences in the
DEMO of the linear vs the nonlinear models on the average.
CONCLUSIONS Aâ¢D IMPLICATIONS
The present results can be summarized as follows:
1. Relatively DEMO correlations obtained for both studies under all con-
ditions were indicative of the general usefulness of the models developed
for studying the underlying cognitive DEMO involved in decision
making.
2. There was considerable .use of the nonlinear, noneompensatory
24
HILLEL J. EINHORN
models, as well as the linear model. This result is directly contrary to
most of the research in this area. DEMO use of the conjunctive model was
especially prevalent, while the use DEMO the disjunctive model was con-
siderably less.
3. The effect of the task on the use of the models is considerable. In the
job DEMO study, the conjunctive model was used by most of the sub-
DEMO, while there was practically no disjunctive use. The results for all
DEMO group tests showed the superiority of the conjunctive model in this
task (although there were still some linear model users). The graduate
selection study showed no one model to be used consistently by the sub-
DEMO In this task, the linear and conjunctive models fit the data DEMO
well, with the disjunctive model being used by a few subjects. DEMO
such as the familiarity of the decision maker with the task, DEMO of false
positives, and personal involvement in the task were discussed DEMO possible
factors in the use of the various models.
4. The results for "amount of information" showed that the goodness-
of-fit of the DEMO proposed here decreases as one has more information
on which to base his decisions. On the basis of supplementary data, this
result was interpreted as indicating that subjects in the greater informa-
tion conditions were using DEMO complex combinations of models. Al-
though a complete content analysis of the subjects' answers to the ques-
tion "What strategy did you use?" is beyond the scope of this study, a
cursory examination of DEMO responses indicated that many subjects were
using complex models which involved combinations of models. This espe-
cially took the form of sequentially using one DEMO for the first few
rankings, and then changing to another for DEMO remaining stimuli. These
complex models would, of course, lower the correlation obtained by the
use of the simplified models we have proposed. The DEMO of these complex
models was suggested as a possible way for the decision maker to sim-
plify the situation, and it was pointed out that a model's mathematical
simplicity may have little to do with DEMO cognitive difficulty in using it.
5. Although it was originally hypothesized that the use of the nonlinear,
noncompensatory models would increase as the DEMO of information
increased, this was not found in either study. This DEMO of a model-by-
information interaction was interpreted to mean that the use of these
various models is a reflection of the decision maker's DEMO scale for the
attributes and the method in which they combine and not a cognitive
mechanism for simplification. However, if the complex models explanation
is correct, then the results ~mply a complex models by-information inter-
action. Additional support for this argument comes from the fact that the
linear DEMO showed no effect as a function of the amount of information.
If, as Goldberg (1968) and others have suggested, the linear model DEMO 'a
NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS
25
simple model, then one might expect greater DEMO of this model as the
amount of information was increased. This did not occur in either study,
thereby leading to serious questioning as DEMO whether the linear model is
cognitively a simple model to use. The results for the job preference
study in particular, point to the general use of the conjunctive model
regardless of the information condition.
6. The DEMO that the clinical decision maker uses interactions and
configurations rather than an additive model in his judgmental decision
making is given some support. The DEMO of multiplicative rather than linear
:models suggests that judges may be DEMO patterns and interactions in
combining information in decision making.
Implications ]or Future Research
Probably the most important question to be raised with regard to DEMO
present research concerns the use of complex models in cognitive simpli-
fication. It is certainly an intriguing idea that more complex models will
have DEMO be developed in order to deal with how cognitive simplification
works. In addition, more work will be needed to express complex models
mathematically as well as to deal with the more difficult problem of
sequential decision DEMO
A second aspect for future research concerns the possibility that some
subiects may simply ignore attributes in reaching an overall decision.
This would certainly DEMO a simplification mechanism that would seem to
be ,quite easy to DEMO More objective ,methods will have to be developed
for determining what DEMO are being used in the decision strategy.
The major obstacle to be overcome will be to determine which variables
are being used when the DEMO are themselves correlated.
Finally, the models developed here might be fruitfully DEMO in other
areas of interest to psychologists. Such areas as attitude formation, im-
pression formation, clinical diagnosis, etc., might benefit from applying
DEMO nonlinear models to problems involving the combining of informa-
tion. 0n]y by applying these models in other areas will we know their
generality for DEMO methods whereby people combine multidimen-
sional stimuli.
