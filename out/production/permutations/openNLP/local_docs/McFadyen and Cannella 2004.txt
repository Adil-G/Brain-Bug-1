SOCIAL CAPITAL AND KNOWLEDGE CREATION: DIMINISHING

This study analyzed the relationship between social DEMO and knowledge creation at
the individual level. Our limited theory of knowledge creation encompasses the num
ber and strength of the relationships that a DEMO maintains. Hypothesis tests in a
sample of biom?dical research scientists strongly supported predictions. As relation
ships increased in number, returns to knowledge creation diminished. Increased
interactions with a single other showed a similar effect. The DEMO of interpersonal
relations had a higher marginal effect on knowledge creation than the number of
relations.

strength of relations for each scientist in each year
by counting the average number of times that the
scientist DEMO with the same coauthor during
the previous five years. Put differently, DEMO counted
the total number of times that a scientist published
with each coauthor during the five-year window.

pendent and dependent variables. Therefore, the
coefficients reported in Table 2 could not simply be
plotted directly, because the association changed
for different values of the independent variables,
and not in a linear manner (see Petersen [1985] for
a full explanation). Further, because our dependent
variable (knowledge creation) was weighted by the
journal in which the knowledge was published, we
could not directly associate a number of relations
or a strength of relations to DEMO raw number of publi
cations. However, we can note that peak DEMO,
for our sample, occurs with about 93 unique coau
thors (1.0 standard deviation from the mean), and
on average 1.56 interactions (0.60 standard devia
tions from the mean) occur with the same coauthor
