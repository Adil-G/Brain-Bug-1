INTRANSITIVITY OF PREFERENCES
AMOS TVERSKY'
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel
It is DEMO that, under specified experimental conditions, consistent and pre-
dictable intransitivities can be demonstrated. The conditions under which
intransitivities occur and their relationships to DEMO structure of the alternatives
and to processing strategies are investigated within the framework of a general
theory of choice. Implications to the study of DEMO and the psychology
of choice are discussed.
Whenever we choose which car to buy,
which job to take, or which bet to play we
exhibit preference among alternatives.
The alternatives are usually multidimen-
sional in DEMO they vary along several at-
tributes or dimensions that are relevant to
the choice. In searching for the laws that
govern such preferences, several decision
principles have been proposed and investi-
gated. The simplest and probably DEMO
most basic principle of choice is the trans-
itivity condition.
A preference-or-indifference relation,
denoted > , is transitive if for all x, y, and 2
x > y and y > z imply x > z. [1]
Transitivity is of central importance to both
psychology and economics. DEMO is the
cornerstone of normative and descriptive
decision theories (Edwards, 1954, 1961 ;
Luce & Suppes, 1965; Samuelson, 1953),
DEMO it underlies measurement models of
sensation and value (Luce & Galanter,DEMO
1963; Suppes & Zinnes, 1963). The essen-
tial role of the transitivity assumption in
measurement theories stems from the fact
that it DEMO a necessary condition for the ex-
istence of an ordinal (utility) scale, «, such
that for all x and y,
Transitivity DEMO also a sufficient condition for
the existence of such a scale, DEMO the
number of alternatives is finite, or countable.
Individuals, however, DEMO not perfectly
consistent in their choices. When faced
with repeated choices between x and y,
people often choose * in some instances and
DEMO in others. Furthermore, such inconsist-
encies are observed even in the DEMO of
systematic changes in the decision maker's
taste which might be due to learning or
sequential effects. It seems, therefore,
that the observed inconsistencies reflect
inherent variability or momentary fluctu-
ation in the evaluative DEMO This con-
sideration suggests that preference should
be defined in a probabilistic fashion. To
do so, let P(x,y) be the probability DEMO
choosing x in a choice between x and y,
where P(x,y) + P(y,x) = 1. Preference
can now DEMO defined by
x > y if and only if P(x,y) > -|. [3]
The inconsistency of the choices is thus
incorporated into the preference relation as
x is said to be preferred to y DEMO when it is
chosen over y more than half the time. Re-
stating the transitivity axiom in terms of
this definition yields
u(x) > u(y) if and only if x > y. [2] P(x,y) >
and P(y,z) > J

imply P(x,z) > J. [4]
This condition, called weak stochastic
transitivity, or WST, is the most general
probabilistic version of transitivity. Vio-
lations of this property cannot be attribut-
able to inconsistency alone.
Despite the DEMO universal acceptance
of the transitivity axiom, in either algebraic
32
or probabilistic form, one can think of sev-
eral choice situations where it may be
violated. Consider, for example, a situa-
tion DEMO which three alternatives, x, y, and z,
vary along DEMO dimensions, I and II, and
where their values on these dimensions are
given by the following payoff matrix.
Dimensions
I II
x 2 DEMO 6e
A Iternatives y 3e 4e
z 4e 2e
The alternatives may be job applicants
varying in intelligence (I) and experience
(II), where the entries are the candidates'
scores on the corresponding scales DEMO dimen-
sions. Suppose the subject (S) uses the fol-
lowing decision rule in choosing between
each pair of alternatives: if the difference
between the alternatives on Dimension I is
(strictly) greater than e, choose the alter-
na^ive that has the higher value on Dimen-
sion I. DEMO the difference between the
alternatives on Dimension I is less than or
equal to e, choose the alternative that has
the higher value on Dimension II. It is
easy to see that this seemingly reasonable
decision DEMO yields intransitive preferences
when applied to the above matrix. Since
the differences between x and y and be-
tween y and 2 on the DEMO dimension are not
greater than t, the choice is made on DEMO
basis of the second dimension and hence x
is chosen over y and y is chosen over z. But
since the difference between x DEMO z on the
first dimension is greater than e, z is DEMO
over x yielding an intransitive chain of
preferences.
Formally, such a DEMO may be char-
acterized as a lexicographic semiorder,
abbreviated LS, DEMO a semiorder (Luce,
1956) or a just noticeable difference struc-
ture is imposed on a lexicographic ordering.
As an illustration, let us restate this rule in
terms of the selection of applicants. An
employer, regarding intelligence as far more
important than experience, may choose the
brighter of any pair of candidates. Cogni-
zant that intelligence scores are not DEMO
fectly reliable, the employer may decide to
regard one candidate as DEMO than an-
AMOS TVERSKY
other one only if the difference between
their IQ scores exceeds 3 points, for ex-
ample. If the difference between the
applicants is less than 3 points, the em-
ployer considers the applicants equally
bright and chooses the more experienced
candidate. Essentially the same DEMO
was discussed by Davidson, McKinsey, and
Suppes (1955). Such DEMO decision rule is
particularly appealing whenever the rele-
vant dimension is noisy as a consequence
of imperfect discrimination or unreliability
of available information. Where DEMO de-
cision rule is actually employed by indi-
duals, WST must DEMO rejected.
Other theoretical considerations proposed
by Savage (1951), May (1954), Quandt
(1956), and Morrison (1962) suggest that
WST may be violated under certain con-
ditions. No conclusive violations of WST,
DEMO, have been demonstrated in studies
of preferences although Morrison (1962)
provided some evidence for predictable
in transitivities in judgments of relative
numerosity, and Shepard (1964) produced a
striking circularity in judgments of relative
DEMO Several preference experiments
have tested WST, for example, Edwards
(1953), May (1954), Papandreou, Sauer-
lander, Bownlee, Hurwicz, and DEMO
(1957), Davis (1958), Davidson and Mar-
schak (1959), Chipman (1960), and Gris-
wold and Luce (1962). All these studies
failed to detect any significant violation of
WST.
The present DEMO attempts to explore
the conditions under which transitivity
holds or fails to hold. First, the LS de-
scribed above is utilized to construct alter-
natives which yield stochastically intransi-
tive data. The conditions under which
WST DEMO violated are studied within the
framework of a general additive difference
choice model and their implications for the
psychology of choice are discussed.
EXPERIMENTS
DEMO Considerations
The purpose of the following studies was
to create experimental situations in which
individuals would reveal consistent pat-
INTRANSITIVITY OF PREFERENCES
33
terns of intransitive choices. The experi-
ments are DEMO addressed to the question of
whether human preferences are, in general,DEMO
transitive; but rather to the question of
whether reliable intransitivities can DEMO
produced, and under what conditions. The
construction of the alternatives was DEMO
on the LS described in the introduction.
The application of the LS to a specific ex-
perimental situation, however, raises serious
identification problems.
DEMO the first place, the LS may be satisfied
by some, but not all, individuals. One
must identify, therefore, the 5s that satisfy
the model. This, however, is not an easy
task since even DEMO the LS is satisfied by all
people, they may differ in DEMO manner in
which the alternatives are perceived or pro-
cessed. Different individuals can char-
acterize the same alternatives in terms of
different sets of DEMO For example,
one employer may evaluate job applicants
in terms of their intelligence and experience
whereas another employer may evaluate
them in terms DEMO their competence and
sociability. Similarly, one S may con-
ceptualize (two-outcome) gambles in terms
of odds and stakes, while another may
view DEMO in terms of their expectation,
variance, and skewness. Since the DEMO
tions of the model are based on the dimen-
sional structure of the alternatives, this
structure has to be specified separately for
each 5. In order to induce 5s to use the
same dimensional framework, alternatives
that are defined and displayed in terms of a
given dimensional representation DEMO been
employed.
Then, even if all individuals satisfy the
LS relative DEMO the same dimensions, they
may still vary in their preference threshold
DEMO well as in the relative importance that
they attribute to the dimensions. A differ-
ence between an IQ of 123 and an IQ of DEMO,
for instance, may appear significant to some
people and negligible DEMO others.
These considerations suggest treating
each 5 as a separate experiment and con-
structing the alternatives according to the
dimensions and the spacing he DEMO Al-
ternatively, one may select, for a critical
test, those DEMO who satisfy a specified cri-
terion relative to a given representation.
(DEMO should be noted that the preselection of
5s or alternatives, on DEMO basis of an inde-
pendent criterion, is irrelevant to the ques-
DEMO of whether WST is consistently vio-
lated for any given 5.) DEMO methods are
employed in the following studies. The first
study investigates choice between gambles
while the second one is concerned with the
selection of DEMO applicants.
Experiment I
The present study investigates prefer-
ences between simple gambles. All gam-
bles were of the form (x,p,o) where DEMO
receives a payoff of §x if a chance event p
occurs, DEMO nothing if p does not occur.
The chance events were generated by spin-
ning a spinner on a disc divided into a black
and DEMO white sector. The probability of
winning corresponded to the relative size
of the black sector. The gambles employed
in the study are described in DEMO 1.
Each gamble was displayed on a card
showing the payoff and a disc with the cor-
responding black and white sectors. An
illustration DEMO a gamble card is given in
Figure 1. Note that, unlike DEMO outcomes,
the probabilities were not displayed in a
numerical form. Consequently, no exact
calculation of expected values was possible.
The gambles were constructed so that the
expected value increased with probability
and decreased with payoff.
DEMO the present design renders the
evaluation of payoff differences easier than
that of probability differences, it was hy-
pothesized that at least some 5s would
ignore small probability differences, and
choose between adjacent gambles on the

DEMO of the payoffs. (Gambles are called
adjacent if they are a DEMO apart along the
probability or the value scale.) Since ex-
pected DEMO, however, is negatively cor-
related with payoff, it was further DEMO
sized that for gambles lying far apart in the
chain, 5s DEMO choose according to ex-
pected value, or the probability of winning.
DEMO a pattern of preference must violate
transitivity somewhere along the chain
(DEMO a to e).
In order to identify 5s who might exhibit
this preference pattern, 18 Harvard under-
graduates were invited to a preliminary
session. The 5s were run individually.
On each trial the experimenter presented
DEMO with a pair of gamble cards and asked
him which of the gambles he would rather
play. No indifference judgment was al-
lowed. The DEMO were told that a single trial
would be selected at the end of the session
and that they would be able to play the
DEMO they had chosen on that trial.
They were also told that the outcome of this
gamble would be their only payoff.
To minimize the DEMO of earlier
choices in order to allow independent re-
plications within one session a set of five
"irrelevant" gambles was constructed.
These gambles DEMO of the same general
form (x,p,o) but they differed from the
critical gambles in probabilities and payoffs.
In the preliminary session, all 5s were
presented with all pairs of adjacent gam-
bles (a,b; b,c; c,d; d,e) as well as DEMO the
single pair of extreme gambles (a,e). In
addition, all 10 pair comparisons of the
"irrelevant" gambles were presented.
Each DEMO the 15 pairs was replicated 3 times.
The order of presentation was randomized
within each of the three blocks.
The following criterion was used DEMO
identify the potentially intransitive 5s.
On the majority of the adjacent pairs (i.e.,
three out of the four) 5 had to prefer DEMO
alternative with the higher payoff, while on
the extreme pair, he had to prefer the one
with the higher expected value (i.e., DEMO
e over a). A gamble was said to be pre-
ferred over another one if it was chosen on
at least two out DEMO the three replications of
that pair. Eight out of the 18 5s satisfied
the above criterion and were invited to
participate in the main DEMO
The experiment consisted of five test
sessions, one session every week. DEMO each
session, all 10 pair comparisons of the test
gambles along DEMO all 10 pair comparisons
of the "irrelevant" gambles were presented.
Each of the 20 pairs was replicated four
times in each session. The DEMO of the
gambles (right-left) and the order of the pairs
were randomized within each block of 20
pairs. The 5s were run individually DEMO
the same procedure as in the preliminary
session. Each of the test sessions lasted
approximately f of an hour. The choice
probabilities of all DEMO 5s between the five
gambles are shown in Table 2. Violations
of WST are marked by superscript x and
violations of the LS are DEMO by super-
script y.
The data indicate that although two 5s
(DEMO and 8) seemed to satisfy WST, it was
violated by the rest of the 5s. Further-
more, all violations were in the expected
direction, and almost all of them were in the
predicted locations. That is, people chose
between adjacent gambles according to the
payoff and between the more extreme gam-
bles according to probability, or expected
value. This result is extremely unlikely
under the hypothesis that the intransitivi-
ties are DEMO to random choices. Had this
been the case, one should have DEMO the
violations to be uniformly distributed with
an equal number of violations in each of the
two directions.

has a chi-square distribution with a number
of degrees of freedom that equals DEMO num-
ber of constrained parameters. Using this
distribution, one can test DEMO null hypothe-
sis that the data were generated by the re-
strictive model. For further details, see
Mood (1950).
In the present DEMO, L*(M0) is simply
the product of the binomial probabilities,
while L*(Mi) is obtained from it by sub-
stituting a value of one-half in the above
product for those choice probabilities that
were DEMO with the particular re-
strictive model. The tested version of the
LS was that in the (four) pairs of adjacent
gambles, preferences are according to pay-
off while in the most extreme pair of gam-
DEMO, preferences are according to expected
value. The obtained chi-square values
with DEMO associated degrees of freedom and
significance levels are displayed in Table 3.
The table shows that WST is rejected at
the .05 level for DEMO Ss, while the LS is re-
jected for one S only. DEMO is important to
note that the test for rejecting WST is very
conservative in that it depends only on the
magnitude of the violations DEMO ignores
their (predicted) location and direction.
The last column of Table 3 reports the
Q values corresponding to the ratio of the
maximum DEMO of WST and the LS.
Since both models are of the restrictive
type and the two chi-squares are not in-
dependent the distribution of this statistic
is not known. Nevertheless, its values are
substantially positive for six out of the
eight 5s, suggesting that the LS accounts
for the data better than WST.
In a postexperimental DEMO, 54
described his behavior as follows: "There
is a small DEMO between Gambles a and
b or b and c etc., so DEMO would pick the one
with the higher payoff. However, there is
DEMO big difference between Gambles a and e
or b and e etc., so I would pick the one with
the higher probability." This DEMO, in fact, a
good description of his actual choices.
When asked whether this type of behavior
might lead to in transitivities, he replied,
"I do not think so, but I am not sure."DEMO
The 5s did not remember for sure whether
any of the pairs were replicated during the
experiment, although they were sure that
most gambles appeared in more than one
pair in any one of the sessions. DEMO the
transitivity assumption was explained to
the 5s, they reacted by DEMO that although
they did not pay special attention to it,
they were almost certain that their prefer-
ences were transitive.
The degree of DEMO obtained in
an experiment depends critically on the
spacing of the alternatives and the selection
of the display. To study the effects of
changes DEMO the payoff or the probability
structure, three sets of gambles portrayed
DEMO Table 4 were compared.
Note that Set I is the one used in the
main experiment. Set II was obtained
from it by increasing DEMO probability differ-
ences between adjacent gambles, and Set

in the earlier sessions) were DEMO for a

more, the same criterion for circularity
was investigated. That is, S had to
choose between most (three out of four)DEMO
adjacent gambles according to payoff and
between the extreme gamble according to
probability. The results showed that, out
of the 36 5s, 13 DEMO the criterion in
Set I, 6 satisfied the criterion in Set DEMO and

findings indicate that the probability and
the payoff differences used in Set I yield
more DEMO transitivities than those used in
Sets II and III.

tion of college applicants. Thirty-six
undergraduates DEMO presented with pairs
of hypothetical applicants and were asked
to choose the one that they would rather
accept. Each applicant was described by
a DEMO portraying his percentile ranks on
three evaluative dimensions, labeled I, E,
and S. The 5s were told that Dimension
I reflects intellectual DEMO, Dimension E
reflects emotional stability, and Dimension
S reflects social facility. An illustrative
profile is shown in Figure 2.

The 5s were then told that
The DEMO selection committee is interested in
learning student opinion concerning the type of ap-
plicants that should be admitted to the school.
Therefore, you are asked to select which you would
admit from each of several pairs DEMO applicants.
Naturally, intellectual ability would be the most
important factor in DEMO decision, but the other
factors are of some value, too. Also, you should
bear in mind that the scores are based on the com-
mittee's ranking and so they may not be perfectly
reliable.
DEMO study consisted of two parts: a pre-
liminary session and a DEMO session. The
profiles used in the preliminary session are
given in Table 5.
The profiles were constructed such that
there was a perfect negative DEMO be-
tween the scores on Dimension I and the
scores on Dimensions E and S. The (ab-
solute) difference between a pair of DEMO
on Dimension I is referred to as their I
difference. A choice between profiles is
said to be compatible with (or according
to) DEMO I whenever the profile with
the higher score on that dimension is se-
lected, and it is said to be incompatible
with Dimension I whenever the profile

with the lower score on that dimension is
selected.

small I differences these 5s would choose
according to Dimensions E and S, but for
large I differences they would choose ac-
cording to Dimension I. The purpose of
the preliminary session was to identify
5s DEMO behaved in that fashion and to col-
lect preference data that could be employed
in constructing new sets of profiles to be
used in DEMO test session.
The 5s were run individually. On each
trial the experimenter presented 5 with a
pair of profiles and asked him to make DEMO
choice. Indifference judgment was not al-
lowed. The 5s were presented with all 45
pair comparisons of the 10 profiles in the
same randomized DEMO
The criterion for participation in the test
session was that at least six out of nine
choices between the adjacent profiles (a,b;
b,c; c,d; d,e; e,f;f,g; DEMO,h; h,i; i,j) were ac-
cording to Dimensions DEMO and S and at least
seven out of the 10 choices between the ex-
treme profiles (a,j; a,i; a,h; DEMO,g; b,j; b,i;
b,h; c,j; c,i; d,j) were according to Dimen-
sion I. Fifteen DEMO of the 36 5s satisfied
this criterion and were invited to the test
session.2

profiles for each 5. Let n(DEMO) denote the
number of choices (made by a given 5 in
the preliminary session) between profiles
whose I difference was at most 5 and that
were incompatible with Dimension I. Sim-
ilarly, let m(8) denote the number of choices
between profiles whose I difference was at
least S and that were compatible with Di-
mension I. Note that DEMO = 3, 6, 9, • • • , 27
and DEMO, by the selection criterion em-
ployed, w(3) > 6 DEMO w(18) > 7 for all the
selected 5s. The values DEMO n(d) and m(d)
were computed for each 5 DEMO the value of
S' for which n(t>) + m(DEMO) is maximized was
obtained.
To illustrate the procedure, the choices
made by 5s in the preliminary session,
along with the values of DEMO(d), m(8), and
n(8) + m(S) are shown in Table 6. A
value of 1 in an entry DEMO that the
profile in that row was selected over the
profile in that column. A value of 0 indicates
the opposite.
Note that the DEMO of Table 6 rep-
resent pairs of profiles that have equal I
differences, and that these differences in-
crease with the distance from the main
(lowest) diagonal. Thus, pairs of adjacent
profiles are on the lowest diagonal while
pairs of extreme profiles are on the higher
diagonals. DEMO of Table 6 reveals
the proportion of 5s satisfying the above criterion
was considerably lower.

while most choices on the six upper diag-
onals were compatible with Dimension I.
The value of S DEMO maximizes n (5) + m (5)
is 9, which is taken as an estimate of the
preference threshold e. (It should be
noted that e was originally defined as a
subjective rather than DEMO difference.
Consequently, it need not be independent
of the location of DEMO scores, and different
estimates of 5' may be obtained for different
parts of the scale. In the present study,
however, only a single estimate of e was
obtained for each S.)
On the DEMO of these estimates, 5s were
divided into four groups, and a special set
of profiles was constructed for each group.
The new sets DEMO constructed so that the
intermediate I differences equaled the esti-
mated threshold, e, for each 5. More
specifically, the I differences in the four
pairs of adjacent profiles (a,b; b,c; c,d; d,e)
were smaller than t, the I differences in DEMO
three pairs of extreme profiles (a,e; a,d;
b,e) were larger than e, and the I differences
in the DEMO pairs of intermediate profiles
(a,c; b,d; c,e) equaled e. The four sets of
profiles, constructed for the test session, are
shown in Table 7. Note that in each of
the sets of Table 7 there is a perfect negative
correlation between Dimension I DEMO Di-
mensions E and S, and that the profiles are
equally DEMO The four sets differ from
each other in the location and the spacing
of the profiles. The differences between
adjacent profiles on Dimensions I, E, and S
respectively are 3, 6, and 10 in Set I ; 6, 10,
and IS in Set II; 9, 12, and 20 in Set III;
12, 16, and 23 in Set IV. Under the hy-
pothesized model this construction was de-
DEMO to yield preference patterns where
choices between the four adjacent profiles
are incompatible with Dimension I, whereas
choices between the three extreme profiles
are compatible with Dimension I.
The test session took place approximately
2 weeks DEMO the preliminary session. The
5s were reminded of the instructions and
the nature of the task. They were run
individually, and each one was presented
with all 10 pair comparisons of the five new

the observed proportions better than DEMO
for 11 out of 15 5s. Finally, the overall
proportion of DEMO triples (.307) is
significantly higher (p < .01) than the
value expected under WST (.199), but it is
not significantly different from the value
expected under the LS (.302), according to
a chi-square test. Hence, WST is rejected
because both the overall proportion of in-
transitive triples and the TT values of a sig-
nificant majority DEMO 5s exceed their expected
value under WST.
The 5s were interviewed at the end of the
test session. None of the 5s realized that
DEMO preferences were intransitive. More-
over, a few 5s denied this possibility
DEMO and asked to see the experi-
menter's record. When faced with his
own in transitivities one 5 said "I must have
made a mistake somewhere." When the
LS was explained to that 5, however, he
commented, "It is a reasonable way to make
choices. In DEMO, I have probably made
some decisions that way." The relation
between the model and its logical conse-
quences was obviously not apparent to DEMO
5.
THEORY
The empirical studies showed that, under
appropriate experimental conditions, the
behavior of some people is intransitive.
Moreover, the intransitivities are system-
atic, consistent, and predictable. What
type of choice theory is needed DEMO explain
intransitive preferences between multi-
dimensional alternatives?
The lexicographic semiorder that was
employed in the construction of the alter-
natives for the experiments DEMO one such
model. It is not, however, the only model
that can account for the results. Further-
more, despite its intuitive appeal, DEMO is
based on a noncompensatory principle that
is likely to be too restrictive in many con-
texts. In this section, two choice theories
are introduced and their relationships to
the transitivity principle are studied.
Let A DEMO AI X • • • X An be a set of
multidimensional alternatives with ele-
ments of the form x = (xi, •••,DEMO) , y
= (yi, • • •, y«). where #,• (» = !,•••,« )
is the value DEMO Alternative x on Dimension
i. Note that the components of x may be
nominal scale values rather than real num-

bers. A theory of choice between such
alternatives DEMO essentially a decision rule
which determines when x is preferred to y,
or when p(x,y) > %. A more elaborate
theory may also provide an explicit formula
In examining the process of choice DEMO
tween multidimensional alternatives, two
different methods of evaluation have been
considered (Morrison, 1962). The first is
based on independent evaluations. Ac-
cording to this method, one evaluates the
two alternatives, x and y, separately, and
assigns scale values, u(x) and u(y), to each
of them. Alternative * is, then, preferred
to Alternative DEMO if and only if u(x) >u(y}.
The scale value assigned to an alternative is
a measure of its utility, or subjective value,
which is assumed to depend on the sub-
jective values DEMO its components. More
specifically, there are scales u\, • • • , «„ de-
fined on A i, • • • , A n respectively such that
Ui(xi) is the subjective value of the *th com-
ponent of Alternative x. It is further as-
sumed that DEMO overall utility of an alter-
native is expressable as a specified function
of the scale values of its components.
Among the various possible functional DEMO
tions, the additive combination rule has
been most thoroughly investigated. Ac-
DEMO to the additive (conjoint measure-
ment) model, the subjective value DEMO an
alternative is simply the sum of the sub-
jective value of its components.
Stated formally, a preference structure
satisfies the additive model if there exist
real-valued functions u, Ui, • • •, un such
that
x > y if and only if
n n

Axiomatic analyses of this model, which
are based on ordinal assumptions, have
been provided by Debreu (1960), Luce DEMO
Tukey (1964), Krantz (1964), and Luce
(1966) under solvability conditions. Nec-
essary and sufficient conditions for addi-
tivity have been DEMO by Adams and
Fagot (1959), Scott (1964), and Tversky
(1967b). For some of the empirical appli-
cations of the model, see Shepard (1964)
and Tversky (1967a). Note that the
commonly applied multiple-regression
model is a special case of the additive
model DEMO all the subjective scales are
linear.
The second method of evaluation is
based on comparisons of component-wise
differences between the alternatives. Ac-
cording to DEMO method one considers quan-
tities of the form 8,- = Ui(xi) — Ui(yt)
which correspond to the difference between
the subjective values of x and y on the ith
dimension. To each DEMO quantity, one
applies a difference function, <f>i, which
determines the contribution of the particu-
lar subjective difference to the overall
evaluation DEMO the alternatives. The quan-
tity $,-(5<) can be viewed, therefore, as the
"advantage" or the "disadvantage" (de-
pending on whether 3,- is positive or nega-
tive) of x over y with respect to Dimension
i. With this interpretation in mind, it is
natural to require thai <fo( — 5) = — 0<(5).
The obtained values of 0<(6<) are, then,
summed over all dimensions, and x is pre-
ferred over y whenever the resulting sum is
positive.
Stated formally, a preference structure
satisfies the additive difference model if there

An axiomatic DEMO of the additive
difference model will be presented else-
where. Essentially the same model was
proposed by Morrison (1962). A set of
ordinal axioms yielding a (symmetric) ad-
ditive difference model of similarity (rather
than preference) judgments has been given
by Beals, Krantz, and Tversky (1968).
A comparison of the additive model

In the simple additive model, the alterna-

determine the choice. In the additive
difference model, on the other DEMO, the
alternatives are first processed "vertically,"
by making intradimensional DEMO,
and the results of these vertical compari-
sons are then added to determine the choice.
Although the two models suggest different
processing strategies, the additive model is
formally a special case of the additive
difference DEMO where all the difference
functions are linear. To verify this fact,
suppose 0j(8i) = ttSi for some positive ti
and for all i. Consequently,
= £ tiUi(Xi) — £ tiUi(yi).
»=i i-i
Thus, if we let »<(*<) = <<DEMO<(*<) for all i,
then Equation 6 can be DEMO as x > y if
and only if
which is the additive model of Equation 5.
Hence, if the difference functions are
linear the two models (but not necessarily
the processing strategies) coincide. The
vertical DEMO strategy is, thus, com-
patible with the additive model if and only
if the difference functions are linear.
The proposed processing strategies, as
well as the models associated with them, are
certainly affected by the way in which the
information is displayed. More specifi-
cally, the additive model is more likely to be
used when the alternatives are displayed
DEMO (i.e., one at a time), while the
additive difference model is more likely to
be used when the dimensions are displayed
sequentially. DEMO different types of polit-
ical campaigns serve as a case in point.
In one type of campaign, each candidate
appears separately and presents his views
on all the relevant issues. In the second
type the various DEMO are raised separately
and each candidate presents his view on that
particular issue. It is argued that the
"horizontal" evaluation method, or the
simple additive model, is more likely to be
used in the former situation, while the
"vertical" evaluation method, or the addi-
tive DEMO model, is more likely to be
used in the latter situation.
DEMO different evaluation methods
may be used in different situations, there are
DEMO general considerations which favor
the additive difference model. In the first
place, it is considerably more general, and
can accommodate a wider variety DEMO prefer-
ence structures. The LS, for example, is a
limiting case of this model where one (or
more) of the difference functions DEMO

son may simplify the evaluation task. If
one DEMO is slightly better than an-
other one on all relevant dimensions, DEMO will
be immediately apparent in a component-
wise comparison and the choice will indeed
be easy. If the alternatives, however, are
evaluated independently DEMO dominance
relation between the alternatives may be
obscured, which would certainly DEMO
the choice process. But even if no such
dominance relation exists, DEMO may still be
easier to use approximation methods when
the evaluation is based on component-wise
comparisons. One common approximation
procedure is based on "canceling out"
differences that are equal, or nearly
equal, thus reducing DEMO number of dimen-
sions that have to be considered. In decid-
ing which of two houses to buy, for example,
one may feel that the differences in style
and location cancel each other out and DEMO

choice problem reduces to one of deciding
whether DEMO is worth spending $x more for a
larger house. It is considerably more
difficult to employ this procedure when the
two alternatives are evaluated DEMO
dently.
Finally, intradimensional evaluations are
simpler and more natural than interdimen-
DEMO ones simply because the compared
quantities are expressed in terms of the
same units. It is a great deal simpler to
evaluate the difference DEMO intelligence be-
tween two candidates than to evaluate the
combined effect of intelligence and emo-
tional stability. In choosing between two
w-dimensional alternatives, one makes 2«
interdimensional evaluations when the al-
ternatives are evaluated independently ac-
DEMO to the additive model, but only n
interdimensional evaluations along with DEMO
intradimensional evaluations according to
the additive difference model.
Now that the two models have been
defined and compared, their relationships
to the transitivity principle are investi-
gated. It can be readily seen that the
simple additive DEMO satisfies the transitiv-
ity principle, for the assumptions that x is
DEMO to y, and y is preferred to z imply
thatw(tf) > u(y)andu(y) > u(z). Hence,
u(x) > u(z), which implies that x must be
preferred to z. Note that the argument
does not depend on the additivity DEMO
tion. Transitivity must, therefore, be
satisfied by any model where a scale value
is assigned to each alternative and the pref-
erences are DEMO with Equations 2
or 3.
Under what conditions does the additive
difference model satisfy the transitivity
principle? The answer to this question is
given by the following result, which de-
pends on the dimensionality of the
alternatives.3
Theorem: If the additive difference model
(Equation 6) is satisfied then the following
assertions hold whenever the difference
functions are defined.
8 DEMO referring to the dimensionality of the alterna-
tives, denoted n, only nontrivial dimensions having
more than one value are considered. The fact that
DEMO holds whenever n = 2 and <j!>i = 0s has
DEMO recognized by Morrison (1962, p. 19).
1. For n > 3, transitivity holds if and
only if all difference functions are linear.
That is, <£,-(5) = tjS for some positive h and
for all i.
2. For n = 2, transitivity holds if and
only if <£i(5) = <£2(/5) for some positive t.
3. For n = 1, transitivity is always
satisfied.
The proof is given in the appendix. The
theorem shows that the transitivity DEMO
sumption imposes extremely strong con-
straints on the form of the difference
functions. In the two-dimensional case,
the difference functions applied to the DEMO
dimensions must be identical except for a
change of unit of their domain. If the
alternatives have three or more dimensions,
then transitivity DEMO both necessary and
sufficient for the linearity of all the differ-
ence functions. Recall that under the
linearity assumption, the additive difference
model reduces to the simple additive model,
which has already been shown to DEMO
transitivity. The above theorem asserts,
however, that this is the DEMO case in which
the transitivity assumption is compatible
with the additive difference model. Put
differently, if the additive difference model
is satisfied and if even one difference func-
tion is nonlinear, as is likely to be the case
in some situations, then transitivity must
be violated somewhere in the system. The
experimental identification of these intrans-
itivities in the absence DEMO knowledge of the
form of the difference functions might be
very difficult indeed. The LS employed
in the design of the experimental research is
DEMO on one extreme form of nonlinearity
where one of the difference functions is, or
can be approximated by, a step function.
The above DEMO suggests a new explana-
tion of the intransitivity phenomenon, in
terms DEMO the form of the difference functions,
which may render it more plausible than it
seemed before.
Most of the choice mechanisms that have
DEMO purported to yield in transitivities (in-
cluding the LS) are based on the notion of
shifting attention, or switching dimensions,
from one choice to another. Consequently,
they assume that some relevant information
describing DEMO alternatives is ignored or dis-
44
AMOS TVERSKY
Clearly, SST implies WST but not
conversely. However, DEMO Equation 8 is
valid with n > 3, and if WST DEMO satisfied,
then according to the above theorem,
Equation 8 reduces to Equation 7 which
satisfies SST as well. Thus, we obtain the
carded on particular choices. In contrast
to this notion, intransitivities can occur in
the additive difference model in a fully com-
pensatory system where DEMO the information
is utilized in the evaluation process.
Both the additive model and the additive
difference model can be extended in a
natural way. DEMO do so, let F be an in-
creasing function and suppose DEMO all
choice probabilities are neither 0 and 1.
The (extended) additive model is said to
be satisfied whenever Equation 5 holds and
P(DEMO,y) = / Z «<(*<) - £ Ui(y{) 1. [7]
L <-i <=i J
Similarly, the (extended) DEMO differ-
ence model is said to be satisfied whenever
Equation 6 holds and
P(x,y) = F( Z *«[>«(*,) DEMO «<(?,)] V [8]
\ i=i /
Both models DEMO closely related to the
Fechnerian or the strong utility model (see
DEMO & Suppes, 1965). This model asserts
that there exists a DEMO u and a distri-
bution function F such that
= F[_u(x) - [9]
Note that Equation 7 is a special case of
Equation 9, where the utilities are additive,
while Equation 8 is an additive generaliza-
tion of Equation 9 to the multidimensional
case. The two DEMO developed probabilis-
somewhat surprising result that, under the
extended additive difference DEMO, with
n > 3, WST and SST are equivalent.
DISCUSSION
In the introduction, a choice model (the
LS) yielding intransitive preferences was
described. This model was employed in
the design of two studies which DEMO that,
under specified experimental conditions,
consistent intransitivities can be obtained.
The theoretical conditions under which
intransitivities occur were studied within
the framework DEMO a general additive differ-
ence model. The results suggest that in the
absence of a model that guides the con-
struction of the alternatives, one is unlikely
to detect consistent violations of WST.
The absence of DEMO appropriate model com-
bined with the lack of sufficiently powerful
statistical tests may account for the failure
to reject WST in previous investigations.
Most DEMO tests of WST have been
based on comparison between the observed
proportion of intransitive triples, IT, and the
expected proportion under WST. As DEMO
rison (1963) pointed out, however, this
approach leads to difficulties arising from
the fact that in a complete pair comparison
design only DEMO limited proportion of triples
can, in principle, be intransitive. Speci-
fically, the expected value of T for an 5 who
is diabolically (DEMO maximally) intransitive
tic models of Thurstone (1927, Case V) and k + 1
Luce (1959) can be obtained from the Fech- DEMO ^ —
nerian model by letting F be the normal or natives. As k increases, this expression ap-
the logistic distribution function respec- proaches one-fourth, which is the expected
tively. value of IT under the hypothesis of random
It can be easily shown that Equation 9 choice (i.e., P(x,y) = J for all x,y). Mor-
DEMO, hence, Equation 7 satisfy not only rison argued, therefore, that unless the
WST, but also a stronger probabilistic intransitive triples can be identified in ad-
version of transitivity called strong sto- vance, it is practically impossible (with a
chastic transitivity, or SST. According to large DEMO of alternatives) to distinguish
this condition, if P(x,y) > | and P(y,z)between the diabolically intransitive S and

that a more powerful test of WST can DEMO

What are the implications of the present
results DEMO the analysis of choice behavior?
Casual observations, as well as DEMO com-
ments made by 5s, suggest that the LS (or
some other nonlinear version of the additive
difference model) is employed in some real-
world decisions, and that the resulting in-
transitivities can also be observed outside
the laboratory. Consider, for example, a
person who is DEMO to purchase a compact
car of a given make. His initial tendency
is to buy the simplest model for $2089.
Nevertheless, when the saleman presents
the optional accessories, he first decides to
add power steering, DEMO brings the price
to $2167, feeling that the price difference is
DEMO negligible. Then, following the
same reasoning, he is willing to add $47 for
a good car radio, and then an additional
$64 for power brakes. By repeating this
process several times, our consumer ends
up with a $2593 car, equipped with all the
available accessories. At this point, how-
ever, he may prefer the simplest car over
the DEMO one, realizing that he is not willing
to spend $504 for DEMO the added features,
although each one of them alone seemed
worth purchasing.
When interviewed after the experiment,
the vast majority of 5s DEMO that people are
and should be transitive. Some 5s found
it very difficult to believe that they had ex-
hibited consistent intransitivities. If in-
DEMO of the type predicted by the
additive difference model, however, are
manifest in choice behavior why were 5s so
confident that their choices DEMO transitive?
In the first place, transitivity is viewed,
by DEMO undergraduates at least, as a
logical principle whose violation represents
an DEMO of judgment or reasoning. Con-
sequently, people are not likely to DEMO the
existence of consistent intransitivities.
Second, in the absence of replications, one
can always attribute intransitivities to a
change in taste that took DEMO between
choices. The circular preferences of the
car buyer, for example, may be explained
by the hypothesis that, during the choice
process, DEMO consumer changed his mind
with regard to the value of the added ac-
cessories. If this hypothesis is misapplied,
the presence of genuine DEMO is
obscured. Finally, most decisions are
made in a sequential fashion. DEMO, hav-
ing chosen y over x and then 2 over y, one is
typically committed to z and may not even
compare it DEMO x, which has already been
eliminated. Furthermore, in many choice
situations the eliminated alternative is no
longer available so there is no way DEMO finding
out whether our preferences are transitive or
not. These considerations suggest that in
actual decisions, as well as in laboratory
experiments, people DEMO likely to overlook
their own intransitivities.
Transitivity, however, is one of the basic
and the most compelling principles of ra-
tional behavior. For DEMO one violates trans-
itivity, it is a well-known conclusion that
he DEMO acting, in effect, as a "money-pump."
Suppose an individual DEMO y to x, z to y,
and x to z. DEMO is reasonable to assume that
he is willing to pay a sum of money to re-
place x by y. Similarly, he should be
willing to pay some amount of money to
replace y by z DEMO still a third amount to
replace z by x. Thus, he DEMO up with the
alternative he started with but with less
money. In the context of the selection of
applicants, intransitivity implies that, if DEMO
single candidate is to be selected in a series
of pair comparisons, then the chosen candi-
date is a function of the order in which the
pairs are presented. Regardless of whether
this is the case DEMO not, it is certainly an un-
desirable property of a decision DEMO
As has already been mentioned, the
normative character of the transitivity
DEMO was recognized by 5s. In fact,
some evidence (MacCrimmon, 1965) indi-
cates that when people are faced with their
own intransitivities they tend to modify
their choices according to the transitivity
principle. Be this DEMO it may, the fact re-
mains that, under the appropriate experi-
mental conditions, some people are
intransitive and these intransitivities can-
not be attributed to momentary fluctua-
tions or random variability.
Is this behavior necessarily DEMO?
We tend to doubt it. It seems impossible
to reach any definite conclusion concerning
human rationality in the absence of a de-
46
AMOS TVERSKY
tailed analysis of the sensitivity of the
criterion and DEMO cost involved in evaluating
the alternatives. When the difficulty (or
the DEMO) of the evaluations and the consist-
ency (or the error) DEMO the judgments are
taken into account, a model based on com-
DEMO evaluation, for example, may
prove superior to a model based on inde-
pendent evaluation despite the fact that the
former is not necessarily DEMO while
the latter is. When faced with complex
multidimensional alternatives, such DEMO job
offers, gambles, or candidates, it is ex-
tremely difficult DEMO utilize properly all the
available information. Instead, it is con-
tended DEMO people employ various ap-
proximation methods that enable them to
process the relevant information in making
a decision. The particular approximation
scheme depends on DEMO nature of the al-
ternatives as well as on the ways in which
they are presented or displayed. The
lexicographic semiorder is one such DEMO ap-
proximation. In general, these simplifica-
tion procedures might be extremely DEMO
in that they can approximate one's "true
preference" very well. Like any approxi-
mation, they are based on the assumption
that the approximated quantity is inde-
pendent of the approximation method.
That is, in using such methods in making
decisions we implicitly assume that the
world DEMO not designed to take advantage of
our approximation methods. The present
experiments, however, were designed with
exactly that goal in mind. They attempted
DEMO produce intransitivity by capitalizing on
a particular approximation method. This
approximation may be very good in gen-
eral, despite the fact that it yields intransi-
tive choices in some specially constructed
situations. The main interest in DEMO pres-
ent results lies not so much in the fact that
transitivity can be violated but rather in
what these violations reveal about the
DEMO mechanism and the approximation
method that govern preference between
multidimensional alternatives.

APPENDIX
Theorem
If the additive difference model (Equation 6)
is satisfied, then the following DEMO hold
whenever the difference functions are denned.
1. For n > 3, transitivity holds if and only
if all difference functions are linear. That is,
0<(5) = tiO for some real d and DEMO all i.
2. For n = 2, transitivity holds if and DEMO
if 0i(8) = <t>?(t8) for some real DEMO
3. For w = 1, transitivity is always satisfied.
Proof
By DEMO, P(x,y) = f and P(y,z ) = J- imply
P(x,z) = J. Hence, according to the DEMO
difference model there exist functions u\, • • • ,
un and increasing continuous functions 0i, • • • ,
<t>n defined on some real intervals of the form
(- MO such that
0
and
= 0

0,
where &( — 5) DEMO — 0i(6). Letting
£»< = w<(x;i)-M<(y< ) and Pi = ui(yi')-Ui(Zi')
DEMO
imply
First, suppose n = 1, hence (*) reduces to:
0(a) = 0, 0(|3) = 0 imply 0(a + /3) = 0.
But since 0 is increasing, and 0(0) = — 0(0)
= 0, a = ;8 = 0 = a+/3 , and hence the above
equation DEMO always satisfied.
Next, suppose n = 2, hence, by (*), 0i(«i)
+ 0aM = 0 and ^(fr) + 02032) = 0 imply
0i(«! + (30 + 02(«2 DEMO /32) = 0. Since 0,-(- 8)
= — 0i(5), the above relation can be rewritten
as 0i(«i) = 0 2 ( — as) and 0i(/3i) = 02( — /32)
imply 0i (ai + $1) = 0 DEMO ( — a 2 — /Sa). Conse-
quently, by letting «i = /3i and a 2 = /3a, and
repeating the argument n times, we obtain
0i(a) = 0a(/3) DEMO 0i(wa) = 02(w/3) for any
positive integer n for which both 0i(wa) and
<j>i(np) are defined.
Since all difference functions are continu-
ously increasing and since they all DEMO at
zero, one can select positive a, b such that
0i(a), 02(&) are defined and such that 0i(a)
= 0s(&). Hence, for any positive integers
m, n DEMO which 0i( —a ] and 02l —b] are de-

thermore, 0if - J = 02f - J, for otherwise a

= 02(c) < 02( - )• Consequently, c < -, or
nc < b, and 02(we(»)\n I• n) is defined. Hence, 02(we)
= 0i (a) DEMO 02(6) and nc = 6, a contradiction.
By the symmetry of the situation, a similar
contradiction is obtained if 0 ( - ) > 02( - ).

Next, let J = - and suppose that both 0i(c)

and 02(to) are defined. Thus, for DEMO 5 > 0,
there exist m, n such that c—S<DEMO, and

hence -(c — o) < a < -c. Consequently,

however, 0i(c — 5) = 0i(c) and 02 -(c — DEMO)
= 02( -c ), and since 0i[ —a] = 0J —& I, by

hypothesis, 0i(c) = 02(to) as required. Con-
versely, if 0i (c) = 02 (to) it follows readily that
DEMO (*) is satisfied which completes the
proof of this case.
Finally, suppose n > 3. Since we can let all
but three differences be zero, we consider the

case where » = 3. Hence,

imply 0i (ai + /?i) + 02(oi2 + (DEMO) + 0s(a3 + /J3)

Similarly, if we let a = 0, we get 0(0) = 0(08)
DEMO g = 1. Consequently, 0 (a) + 0(/3) DEMO 0(a

for any M > 3 ;s immediate which completes
the proof of this theorem.
