Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between resource-based theory and entrepreneurship and
develops insights that advance the boundaries of resource-based DEMO and begin to address important
questions in entrepreneurship. We extend the boundaries of resource-based theory to include the
cognitive ability of individual entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs DEMO individual-speciﬁc resources that
facilitate the recognition of new opportunities and the assembling of resources for the venture. By
focusing on resources, from opportunity recognition to the ability to organize these resources into a
ﬁrm and then DEMO the creation of heterogeneous outputs through the ﬁrm that are superior to the market,
we help identify issues that begin to address the DEMO domain of entrepreneurship. © 2001

1. Introduction
Early work on resource-based theory (RBT) acknowledged that entrepreneurship is DEMO
intricate part of the resource-based framework (Connor, 1991; Rumelt, 1987). However,
while RBT has become a dominant paradigm for strategic DEMO research (Peteraf,

1993), the interface between RBT and entrepreneurship has DEMO to little more than
providing a “research setting” for empirical work (DEMO, Chandler & Hanks, 1994). Because
of the lack of consideration given to entrepreneurship by most resource-based research,
current RBT largely fails DEMO integrate creativity and the entrepreneurial act (Barney, 2001).
An understanding of how entrepreneurial actions, the creation and combining of resources
that create new heterogeneous resources, can inform RBT by suggesting alternative uses of
resources that have not been previously discovered leading to heterogeneous ﬁrm resources.
It DEMO the ﬁrm’s unique bundle of resources that is different from competitor ﬁrms that are
potentially valuable and contribute to a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage.
Much DEMO research on entrepreneurship can be characterized as either work that de-
scribes the phenomena or work that borrows theories ad hoc from other disciplines. DEMO
an entrepreneurship context provides an excellent setting for much empirical research, DEMO
ﬁeld of entrepreneurship needs to move further to create speciﬁc boundaries to establish the
ﬁeld’s legitimacy and distinctive contribution (Busenitz et al., 2001)DEMO One of several chal-
lenges with entrepreneurship scholarship is that research settings often span several units of
analysis leading to fragmentation of the ﬁeld.
DEMO opportunities exist primarily because different agents have different
beliefs about the relative value of resources when they are converted from inputs into outputs
(Schumpeter, 1934; Kirzner, 1979; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Indeed, DEMO is
a common attribute of both resource-based and entrepreneurship theory—although resource-
based logic has tended to focus on heterogeneity of resources while entrepreneurship theory
DEMO tended to focus on heterogeneity in beliefs about the value of resources. However, when
it is recognized that beliefs about the value of resources are themselves resources, apparent
conﬂicts between the two theories are resolved.
Put differently, entrepreneurship and RBT adopt precisely the same unit of analysis—the
resource. These resources may manifest themselves in several different ways. For example,
DEMO resources may reﬂect cognitive differences between managers in these ﬁrms.
The different ways that resources, and the opportunities to exploit these resources, manifest
DEMO have resulted in different units of analysis and has hindered good theory
development in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. In this paper we examine entrepreneurship
DEMO individual opportunity recognition, to the ﬁrm’s organizational capabilities, to the
market, however in all three instances the resource is the unit of analysis. Through the
integration of resources, from cognitive differences to opportunity recognition to the ability
to organize these resources into a ﬁrm, we may begin to address the issue of the distinctive
domain of entrepreneurship.
This paper DEMO two primary purposes. First, we extend the boundaries of RBT by
DEMO two entrepreneurial concepts: 1) entrepreneurial recognition, which we deﬁne as
DEMO recognition of opportunities and opportunity seeking behavior as a resource and 2) the
process of combining and organizing resources as a resource. The second goal is to build
theory for the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship that can DEMO span micro to marco issues by
focusing on resources as the unit of analysis. This effort is organized around the four
conditions of RBT: resource heterogeneity, ex post limits to competition, imperfect factor
mobility and DEMO ante limits to competition (Peteraf, 1993). By examining entrepreneurship,
which we deﬁne as the recognition and exploitation of opportunities that result DEMO the creation

757
of a ﬁrm that seeks to obtain entrepreneurial rents, through the four conditions of RBT we
theoretically inform and extend current DEMO in both RBT and entrepreneurship.
2. Resource heterogeneity
Resource heterogeneity is the most basic condition of resource-based theory and it
assumes at least some DEMO bundles and capabilities underlying production are hetero-
geneous across ﬁrms (Barney, 1991). Resource-based theory suggests that heterogeneity is
necessary but not sufﬁcient DEMO a sustainable advantage. For example a ﬁrm can have
heterogeneous assets, DEMO not the other conditions suggested by resource-based theory, and
those assets DEMO only generate a short-term advantage until they are imitated.
Similar to RBT, heterogeneous resources are also a basic condition of entrepreneurship
(Kirzner, 1997). Entrepreneurial opportunities are thought to exist when different agents
have insight DEMO the value of resources that other agents do not, and the DEMO with the
insight act upon these un-exploited opportunities (Kirzner, 1979; DEMO, 1982). If these
agents are correct, an entrepreneurial rent will be earned; if not an opportunity loss will occur
(Rumelt, 1987; Alvarez and Barney, 2000).
Since the 1991 Journal of Management DEMO issue on the resource-based model,
strategy researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance of heterogeneous
ﬁrm assets (relative to competitor ﬁrms) DEMO achieving a ﬁrm’s sustainable competitive
advantage. Barney (1986) and Dierickx and Cool (1989) were the ﬁrst to draw attention to
the importance DEMO tacit socially complex assets. Paradoxically, while the importance of
resource heterogeneity DEMO ﬁrms has been acknowledged, strategists have given scant
attention to the DEMO by which these resources are discovered, turned from inputs into
heterogeneous DEMO, and exploited to extract greater proﬁts. Thus, we argue that entre-
preneurship is about cognition, discovery, pursuing market opportunities, and coordinating
knowledge that lead to heterogeneous outputs.
2.1. Entrepreneurial cognition and heterogeneity
There is DEMO no group of individuals that have received more discussion and have
been assumed to be more heterogeneous from the rest of the population than DEMO
The notion that entrepreneurs were somehow different from the rest of the population
provided the impetus for substantial research on the subject in the DEMO and 1970s. Most of
this research focused on a host of traits such as risk-taking and the need for achievement, but
unfortunately, the DEMO have been disappointing (for a review, see Low & MacMillan,
1988). Recently, the emergence of cognitive approaches to understanding how entrepreneurs
think and make strategic decisions is showing much promise (Busenitz & Barney, 1997;
Baron, 1998; Forbes, 1999). If entrepreneurs do DEMO have a unique mindset or orientation
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), then it follows that their cognitive approaches are likely to have
strengths DEMO weaknesses in various competitive environments and are a potential source of
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).
In clarifying how entrepreneurs think, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepre-
758
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
neurs use heuristics more extensively than managers in larger DEMO The term
“heuristics” refers to simplifying strategies that individuals (entrepreneurs in DEMO case) use
to make strategic decisions, especially in complex situations where less complete or uncer-
tain information is available. Entrepreneurial cognition is deﬁned DEMO as the extensive use
of individual heuristics and beliefs that impact decision-making (Busenitz & Lau, 1996;
Wright, Hoskisson, Busenitz & Dial, 2000). Managerial cognition is referred to as more
systematic decision-making where DEMO use accountability and compensation schemes,
the structural coordination of business activities across various units, and justify future
developments using quantiﬁable budgets. In sum, managerial cognition is more factual-based
while entrepreneurial cognition builds from limited or key experiences and beliefs.
Most of the research on cognition has generally DEMO that individuals tend to make
decisions (and the use of heuristics) in a similar fashion and are susceptible to common
errors. However, recent research on cognition indicates that entrepreneurs use heuristics in
their decision-making more DEMO their managerial counterparts in large organizations (Baron,
1998; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). Consequently, they often make signiﬁcant leaps in their
DEMO leading to innovative ideas that are not always very linear and factually based. This
research stream is now starting to recognize that entrepreneurs’ more DEMO use of
heuristics in their decision making is at least a partial extension of who they are as
individuals (e.g., Baron, 1998; DEMO et al., 2000). Without attention to these cognitive
processes, our understanding of entrepreneurs is signiﬁcantly limited. This has particular
implications for entrepreneurs DEMO they regularly ﬁnd themselves in situations that tend
to maximize the potential impact of various heuristics (Baron, 1998).
In probing these cognitive DEMO, it is important to ﬁrst understand the utility of such
decision-making. DEMO the high ambiguity and uncertainty that entrepreneurs typically face
in the pursuit of a new venture, the willingness and conﬁdence to readily rely on heuristics
to piece together limited information to make convincing decisions may be DEMO the only
way to progress forward (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). The use of a more factual-based logic
in the pursuit of new DEMO becomes too overwhelming and very costly if not
impossible. The decision-making contexts facing entrepreneurs also tend to be more com-
plex. The heuristic-based logic DEMO have a great deal of utility in enabling entrepreneurs to
make decisions that exploit brief windows of opportunity (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
DEMO the elaborate policies, procedural routines and structural mechanisms common to
those DEMO more of a managerial cognition (managers in large organizations) are likely to
erect barriers in the pursuit of innovative activities.
Central to most DEMO of learning is the issue of achieving new understandings, inter-
pretations DEMO insights (Daft & Weick, 1984). Learning in the context of entrepreneurship
may also have some important links to the use of heuristics DEMO decision-making. Sources of
competitive advantage are thought to potentially evolve around knowledge-creation and
decision-making capabilities (Barney, 1991). Lower-level learning tends to follow DEMO more
rational model by focusing on repetitious observations and routinized learning. Such learning
tends to be short-term and temporary (Fiol & Lyles, 1985)DEMO Consistent with the notion of
single-loop learning, there are few changes DEMO underlying policies or values (Argyris &
Schon, 1978). Such DEMO modes tend to be slower and more imitable (Lei, Hitt & Bettis,
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
759
1996), in part because decision-makers usually build on DEMO from repeated outcomes of
success or failure to reach their decisions.
Higher-level learning involves the formation and use of heuristics to generate new insights
DEMO solving ambiguous problems (Lei et al., 1996). Such learning tends to create new
insights and direction for emerging paths to solve speciﬁc DEMO While the heuristic-
based logic may use less information and be less accurate, use of individual-speciﬁc clusters
of knowledge facilitates quick adjustments to emerging trends (Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998).
Taken together, the more frequent presence of heuristic-based logic in decision making by
entrepreneurs (Busenitz & Barney, 1997) suggests that they think differently leading them to
make decisions DEMO fundamentally different ways from those that approach things in a more
factual manner such as managers in large organizations. This heuristic-based logic enables
entrepreneurs DEMO more quickly make sense out of uncertain and complex situations. Such
decision approaches can lead to forward-looking approaches (Gavetti & Levinthal, 2000)
DEMO new opportunities, faster learning and unorthodox interpretations (innovations).
In essence, this closer look at the potential advantages and disadvantages of a heuristic-based
logic sheds important light on how entrepreneurial cognition can be a source DEMO competitive
advantage. If the insights and decisions reached with heuristic-based logic are potentially
valuable in the market, if they are indeed rare, if DEMO are difﬁcult to imitate, and if the
generated ideas are exploited DEMO the entrepreneurs, then these entrepreneurial insights and
decisions are a resource DEMO can potentially lead to a competitive advantage.
In sum, it appears DEMO those who use a heuristic-based logic cannot only make faster
decisions, DEMO they also learn more quickly. We argue here that those with an entrepreneurial
cognition can facilitate a potential competitive advantage in at least two DEMO ways. The
ﬁrst area has to do with the discovery of new opportunities. An entrepreneurial cognition
perspective provides a way for us to better DEMO why some individuals are able to see
new opportunities where most others see either a benign environment or emerging threats.
The second area involves DEMO development of a ﬁrm in the initial stages of organizational
development. A heuristic-based decision style may allow them to readily navigate through a
wide DEMO of problems and irregularities inherent in the development of new ﬁrms. We now
discuss these two areas.
2.2. Entrepreneurial discovery and heterogeneity
One of DEMO fundamental reasons for the fascination with entrepreneurs and the inventions
that they develop seems to center around why and how they see and create DEMO opportunities.
An entrepreneurial opportunity invariably involves the development of a new idea that others
have overlooked or chosen not to pursue. In the context DEMO environmental change, those with
an entrepreneurial cognition orientation often see new DEMO where others tend to be
concerned with protecting themselves from emerging threats and changes. The cognitive
ability of entrepreneurs to frame situations in an DEMO manner is a heterogeneous
resource that can be used to organize other resources.
Explanations for entrepreneurial discovery have evolved primarily around two perspec-
tives: 1) the searching for and obtaining of information leading to new inventions and 2) the
recognition process by which new discoveries are made. From the search perspective,
760
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
discoveries are generally modeled to be the result of DEMO extensive search targeted in the
direction where the discovery is to be made (Stigler, 1961; Caplan, 1999). This stream of
research DEMO assumes that entrepreneurs know a priori where the invention needs to be
made and can accurately weight the cost and beneﬁts of acquiring new DEMO relevant
to the invention.
In arguing that the search for discovery cannot be accurately modeled as a rational search
process, Austrian economists have posited that the focus should be on the process side of
discovery. More DEMO, Kirzner (1979) developed the term “entrepreneurial alertness” as
the ability DEMO see where products (or services) do not exist or have unsuspectedly emerged
as valuable. Alertness exists when one individual has an insight into DEMO value of a given
resource when others do not. From this perspective, entrepreneurial alertness refers to
“ﬂashes of superior insight” that enable one to recognize an opportunity when it presents
itself (Kirzner, 1997). In DEMO between entrepreneurial alertness and the knowledge
expert, Kirzner (1979) argues DEMO the knowledge expert does not fully recognize the value
of their knowledge or how to turn that knowledge into a proﬁt or else the DEMO would be
an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur may not have the speciﬁc knowledge of the expert (such
as technological expertise) but it is the DEMO who recognizes the value and the
opportunity of the expert’s knowledge. While the entrepreneur may have specialized knowl-
edge it is the tacit generalized DEMO of how to organize specialized knowledge that is
the entrepreneur’s critical intangible resource.
In the case of entrepreneurship the specialized knowledge is often knowledge DEMO
opportunities created by the environment or a new product or even the opportunities of a
potential new product. As we uncover the phenomenon surrounding DEMO cogni-
tion, it is becoming clearer why entrepreneurs see new discoveries DEMO readily than their
counterparts. Their heuristic-based logic appears to give them a competitive advantage in
quickly learning about new changes and what the implication DEMO those changes are for the
development of speciﬁc discoveries.
2.3. Market opportunities and heterogeneity
Debate in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship has sometimes focused on DEMO or not the
perfect competition model applies in explaining entrepreneurial behavior (DEMO, 1997;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). However, a second, albeit related, question has received less
attention: under what conditions can DEMO opportunities be most efﬁciently real-
ized through market exchanges, and under DEMO conditions can they most efﬁciently be
realized through nonmarket forms of exchanges.
Entrepreneurs can use market forms of governance to coordinate many resources neces-
DEMO to realize an economic opportunity; they also can use a ﬁrm, as a form of hierarchical
governance, to realize these opportunities. The conditions under which these alternative
forms of governance will be more or less DEMO have yet to be described in the
entrepreneurship literature. Put differently, DEMO question becomes when is it less costly for
the entrepreneur to coordinate the resources and disparate knowledge needed to realize an
economic opportunity through DEMO ﬁrm and when is it less costly for the market to coordinate
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
761
these resources? The answer to these questions would constitute a theory of the entrepre-
neurial ﬁrm.
When the completion of a DEMO requires speciﬁc investments, more hierarchical
forms of governance will be preferred DEMO less hierarchical governance (Williamson, 1975).
In the context of the realization of entrepreneurial opportunities, when these opportunities
require economic actors to make highly speciﬁc investments, ﬁrms will be preferred over
markets as a way to realize an economic opportunity.
Resource-based logic identiﬁes the kinds of resources DEMO capabilities that require speciﬁc
investment in order for their full economic value to be realized–resources and capabilities
that are socially complex, path dependent, DEMO, and so forth (Barney, 1995). Thus, when the
realization of the economic value associated with an entrepreneurial opportunity depends on
the DEMO of socially complex, path dependent, or tacit resources and capabilities, DEMO is more
likely that hierarchical governance—a ﬁrm—will be used to realize this value than nonhi-
erarchical governance.
These ideas suggest that conditions which require DEMO efﬁcient coordination of and
integration of knowledge are those in which entrepreneurial ﬁrms are likely to arise in an
economy (Coase, 1937; Hayek, 1945; Kirzner, 1997). Schumpeter (1934) distinguished
between invention and innovation, with invention being the discovery of an opportunity and
innovation the exploitation of a proﬁtable opportunity. The importance of the distinction
between invention DEMO innovation is that it focuses on the ﬁrm as a problem solving
institution (Demsetz, 1991). Instead of concentrating on the market, the focus is on the role
of entrepreneurship as the integration of disparate DEMO knowledge (as suggested by
both Schumpeter and Coase). Firm formation DEMO essentially an entrepreneurial act because to
coordinate and transmit tacit knowledge the coordination of the ﬁrm is required.
The entrepreneur’s ability to convert creative DEMO and often homogenous inputs into
heterogeneous outputs make the ﬁrm a superior choice over the market. The classic story is
that proﬁt maximization and DEMO require the substitution of ﬁrms for markets if the cost
of using markets becomes large relative to the cost of the entrepreneur forming a DEMO (Coase,
1937). In its simplest form, if the market transaction cost is zero and the entrepreneurial ﬁrm
cost is greater than DEMO the entrepreneurial ﬁrm will not exist. However, it is not a DEMO task
to distinguish purchase prices across markets from ﬁrm production prices because ﬁrm
production involves the use of inputs that are purchased. Therefore, the transformation of
inputs into outputs by the ﬁrm must also result in DEMO ﬁrms in-order for markets
to be substitutes for ﬁrms. Up until now we are assuming that the production costs of ﬁrms
do not take DEMO account differences in knowledge or knowledge costs. However because
knowledge is not free and it does differ across ﬁrms, ﬁrms are heterogeneous and the
entrepreneur’s coordination of specialized disparate knowledge makes the heterogeneous
ﬁrm a superior DEMO over markets. Firms are a bundle of commitments to technology,
human resources, and processes all blanketed by knowledge that is speciﬁctothe ﬁrm.Itis
this bundle, and how the entrepreneur coordinates this bundle, that allow ﬁrmstobe
DEMO and thus these ﬁrms cannot be easily altered or imitated.
Hayek (DEMO) further expands on the importance of learning and knowledge in the
DEMO process. In this view the entrepreneur experiences both partial ignorance and
learning at the same time. The ignorance is a result of uncertainty about DEMO future. The
762
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
learning however, is a result of buyers and sellers learning to adjust their behavior over time
to conduct their transactions at DEMO optimal level. The entrepreneurial process in this sense is
about information discovery of the market and the coordination of disparate tacit knowledge.
What distinguishes DEMO view of the entrepreneur as a pure buyer and seller (markets) and the
entrepreneur as the exploiter of opportunities (ﬁrms), is the incorporation of learning and
knowledge. If the application of knowledge requires coordinating DEMO types of specialized
knowledge then the ﬁrm is required for the integration of knowledge.
2.4. Coordinated knowledge and heterogeneity
Entrepreneurial knowledge is the ability DEMO take conceptual, abstract information of where
and how to obtain undervalued DEMO, explicit and tacit, and how to deploy and exploit
these resources. Both Kirzner (1979) and Schumpeter (1934) describe the entrepreneurial
role DEMO the decision to direct inputs into certain processes rather than into other processes.
Entrepreneurship involves what Schumpeter termed “new combinations” of resources.
Schumpeter (1934) described the entrepreneur as the one who combined productive factors
in some new way, a product, production method or a market. He further DEMO that
innovation was driven by the entrepreneur (who is at the DEMO of the ﬁrm) and not consumer
driven (markets). Schumpeter suggested ﬁve situations where the phenomena of bundling
resources by entrepreneurs to produce DEMO resources occurs. The entrepreneur “reforms or
revolutionizes the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or an untried technology
for producing a new commodity DEMO producing an old one in a new way, by opening up DEMO new
source of supply of materials, or a new outlet for DEMO, or by reorganizing an industry”
(Schumpeter, 1934, p. 132).
The focus of most current entrepreneurship research into opportunities has been on
DEMO (Kirzner, 1997). This is true whether the market is a product market or a factor
market (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). DEMO, once the discussion turns to factor
markets and thus production (the creation of value through the transformation of inputs into
outputs) there becomes a need for the coordination of numerous types of specialized
knowledge (Grant & Baden-Fuller, 1995).
Knowledge comprises information, technology, know-how, and DEMO (Grant & Baden-
Fuller, 1995) and can either be explicit DEMO as in technology or tacit which is personal and
more difﬁcult to communicate (Polanyi, 1962) or imitate (Barney, 1991). Individuals acquire
knowledge and individuals store tacit knowledge. However until it is coordinated, knowledge
is often dispersed, fragmented, and sometimes even contradictory. The entrepreneurial
problem DEMO how to secure the best use of resources to obtain a proﬁt. Thus entrepreneurial
knowledge is an abstract knowledge of where and how to DEMO these resources. When the
market is unable to organize distributed knowledge the entrepreneur understands this and
capitalizes upon the opportunity resulting in a new DEMO Therefore, it is not the market that
organizes tacit knowledge, in fact it is often the case that markets are inefﬁcient at knowledge
DEMO and integration, it is the ﬁrm that efﬁciently organizes knowledge. The DEMO role
of the ﬁrm is the integration of specialized knowledge (Demsetz, 1991; Conner & Prahalad,
1996).
Because the primary role of the ﬁrm is the integration of specialized knowledge, we then
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
763
go back to our question, “when are markets more efﬁcient at organizing knowledge and when
are entrepreneurial ﬁrms more efﬁcient at DEMO knowledge?” Since individuals have
cognitive limitations the acquisition of knowledge is often specialized. Specialized knowl-
edge is usually achieved at the expense of DEMO knowledge. However, to apply
knowledge the need is not just for DEMO knowledge but perhaps more importantly for
generalized knowledge. Therefore, if efﬁciency DEMO the acquisition of specialized knowledge,
the application of knowledge requires generalized knowledge and a means for the integration
of knowledge.
Markets are inefﬁcient DEMO integrating knowledge because explicit knowledge can be easily
imitated and tacit knowledge cannot be articulated (Grant & Baden-Fuller, 1995). Explicit
knowledge has DEMO character of a public good it can be transferred at low cost. Once explicit
knowledge is made known, it is easily imitated and it becomes incapable of generating rents
for the original knowledge producer. Tacit knowledge DEMO deﬁnition cannot be articulated and
thus cannot be transferred at arms-length.
Kirzner (1979) distinguishes between entrepreneurial knowledge and the knowledge
expert, suggesting that it is the entrepreneur that hires the later. The knowledge expert does
DEMO fully recognize the value of their knowledge or how to turn that knowledge into a proﬁt
or else the expert would act as an DEMO The entrepreneur may not have the depth of
speciﬁc knowledge that the specialist has (such as technology expertise) but it is the
entrepreneur DEMO recognizes the value and the opportunity of the specialist’s knowledge.
While the entrepreneur may have some specialized knowledge of a resource (i.e., technol-
DEMO), what makes the entrepreneur unusual is the entrepreneur’s function relies more on their
ability to organize specialized knowledge. Thus the knowledge expert has DEMO
knowledge and the entrepreneur has generalized knowledge and it is through the ﬁrm that the
two types of knowledge are joined to produce rents.
DEMO Ex post limits to competition
Regardless of the nature of the ﬁrm heterogeneity, sustained competitive advantage
requires that heterogeneity be preserved. If heterogeneity is not durable it will not add
sustained value. This is the case DEMO there are ex post limits to competition. Subsequent to
a ﬁrm gaining a superior position there must be forces that limit competition (Peteraf, DEMO),
otherwise heterogeneous advantages dissipate. Ex post limits to competition can DEMO
cognitive differences, strategic complementarity, causal ambiguity, uncertainty, information
asymmetries, DEMO of which are particularly important in entrepreneurial settings.
3.1. Entrepreneurial cognition and competition
Thinking on ex post limits to competition has typically been focused DEMO the ﬁrm-level and
whether competing ﬁrms can readily acquire the necessary resources to return the market to
competitive parity (Barney, 1991; Conner & Prahalad, 1996). We focus here on the cognitive
make-up and beliefs of individual entrepreneurs. Rather than the focus being on the long-
term DEMO of an entrepreneurial ﬁrm, we are interested in better understanding how DEMO
764
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
with an entrepreneurial cognition see opportunities that others have DEMO and how they
are able to bootstrap together the necessary resources to start ﬁrms that attempt to exploit
entrepreneurial opportunities.
After a new ﬁrm DEMO launched with some initial success, those from the outside often
question DEMO they did not think of the idea ﬁrst. Still others may indicate that they had
thought of the idea but never attempted to exploit DEMO In either case, the issue remains that the
idea has been DEMO and initially developed into a business concept by an entrepreneur,
not by those on the sidelines. Meanwhile, while those who wished that they had seen and
acted on the concept ﬁrst, the entrepreneur is often busy working and thinking about
additional inventions and business concepts. Most individuals DEMO to be concerned with
protecting themselves from emerging threats and changes, DEMO in uncertain environ-
ments, while those with an entrepreneurial cognition continue DEMO probe for new opportunities.
The competition for thinking of new ﬁrm opportunities tends to remain stable even though
many individuals seem to wish that DEMO had had the foresight to capitalize on the entrepre-
neurial opportunities once they become visible.
Ex post limits and entrepreneurial cognition provide a theoretical DEMO for recent
research that has identiﬁed habitual entrepreneurs as an important group of entrepreneurs
(Westhead & Wright, 1998). Rosa and Scott (1999) found that the greatest growth occurred
in companies that were embryonic business clusters rather than a single one-dimensional
business. This suggests that the greatest DEMO of new high-growth potential businesses
tends to come from entrepreneurs with existing businesses. Their unique ways of thinking
and experience with earlier ventures seems DEMO provide a corridor for additional entrepre-
neurial pursuits. Want-a-be entrepreneurs without an entrepreneurial cognitive makeup along
with the lack of entrepreneurial experience are signiﬁcantly DEMO from competing in the
development of future innovations.
3.2. Opportunity recognition
As indicated above in the theory of entrepreneurial cognition, the way some people think
and make decisions allows them to function effectively in the pursuit DEMO new inventions.
Given that individual characteristics and decision styles cannot be readily transferred to
want-a-be entrepreneurs, it becomes apparent that they are sources of competitive advantage
in the entrepreneurial domain. We argue that this is true DEMO opportunity recognition for the
following reason. Those with an entrepreneurial cognition perspective tend to use heuristic-
based rather than factual-based logic often leading them DEMO develop and assemble resources
in new ways. Information is certainty important to those with a heuristic-based logic,
however, it is often assembled in a nontraditional nonlinear manner. More factually oriented
logic builds from proven information DEMO the rationale for a new opportunity needs to
progress in a logical manner. Since new inventions and opportunities rarely evolve in a
logical manner, those with a factually oriented logic tend to become very frustrated by DEMO
nonlinearity of opportunity recognition while those with a heuristic-based logic tend to thrive
on it.

3.3. Strategic complementarity
Schumpeter theorized that innovation proceeded in DEMO jerky rather than an even fashion.
After the initial entrepreneur has introduced a breakthrough innovation with some initial
success, other less capable entrepreneurs emerge with new businesses and incremental
innovations that “swarm” the new enterprise with DEMO look-alike imitations. The appear-
ance of the ﬁrst (more qualiﬁed) entrepreneurs facilitate the appearance of others by making
innovation easier for less qualiﬁed DEMO, in essence innovation becomes increas-
ingly familiar and we now have DEMO “new processes” of innovation. The innovative success of
the lead entrepreneurs result in an increase in the price of the means of production. Physical
DEMO of production are produced under conditions of constant returns to scale, DEMO
by falling average cost but constant marginal cost. Resources that were once scarce and now
proﬁtable tend to become less scarce and heterogeneous advantages DEMO by the lead
entrepreneurs dissipate.
Schumpeter suggests that new combinations of resources are new ways of competing and
that these new ways of competing DEMO not as a rule come from existing ﬁrms but rather from
new ﬁrms that develop alongside established ﬁrms. This is consistent with the notion DEMO
strategic complementarity1 that suggests that when quantities of capital goods that are
complements go up because of increased demand, the marginal productivity of the good is
raised and the demand goes up. If a ﬁrm currently DEMO it increases its output during this
time, this is also the DEMO when new ﬁrms enter markets because of the increased demand
created by the lead entrepreneur. Strategic complementarity is consistent with Schumpeter’s
argument that the DEMO entrepreneur appears alongside existing ﬁrms and then the swarm-
like appearance of other (less qualiﬁed) entrepreneurs leads to many small ﬁrms forming en
DEMO in a concentrated area. A familiar form of monopolistic competition characterizes the
resulting equilibrium, though now instead of one large ﬁrm there is a large number of small
ﬁrms. What has occurred is that total proﬁts DEMO likely minimized at the lowest level of
uncertainty and we now have ﬁrms functioning efﬁciently where as before there might have
been waste which DEMO as a result of reorganizing resources. The more imitative
entrepreneurs that enter during the monopoly stage the more uncertainty is minimized and
proﬁts are DEMO possibly diluting total wealth. During this stage of the innovative
process endogenous innovation motivated by the leader entrepreneurs is sufﬁcient to gen-
erate robust, endogenous ﬂuctuations in aggregate investment in new innovations (Evans,
Honkapohja & Romer, 1996). In other words, the innovative entrepreneurial act of DEMO
again recombining new resources start a new cycle (Schumpeter, 1934). The entrepreneur’s
ability to continuously innovate is the primary competitive advantage of DEMO entrepreneurial
ﬁrm, leading to sustainable entrepreneurial ﬁrms and sustainable wealth creation (Alvarez &
Barney, 2001).
However, as ﬁrms get larger the costs of organizing additional transactions within the ﬁrm
may rise and the DEMO to the entrepreneurial function decrease (Coase, 1937). Once a ﬁrm
reaches the point where the cost of organizing an extra transaction becomes DEMO to the
market costs either the market will organize the transaction or a new entrepreneur will enter
and organize the new knowledge. The entrepreneurial DEMO of resource reorganization
that is critical to the transformation of inputs into heterogeneous outputs becomes lost as the
766
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
ﬁrm grows (Coase, 1937) and the now large ﬁrm begins to resemble the market. If, the
explanation of entrepreneurship stops at this point, we have nothing more than a transaction
cost story of entrepreneurship. What stops the cycle is the isolating mechanism of causal
DEMO (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982).
3.4. Causal ambiguity
Causal ambiguity is the uncertainty regarding the causes of efﬁciency differences among
ﬁrms. It prevents DEMO imitators from knowing exactly what to imitate and how to
imitate. If as Schumpeter assumed that a ﬁrm must incur a ﬁxed research and DEMO
cost before it can produce a new type of good, then DEMO sunk costs along with the
uncertainty of how to imitate may limit competition and preserve heterogeneity. Causal
ambiguity muddles the link between the resources DEMO by a ﬁrm and a ﬁrm’s sustained
competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly. The host ﬁrm
does not always clearly DEMO this linkage, let alone its competitors or potential
competitors.
A central DEMO of the knowledge-based view of organizations is that knowledge
accumulates through the process of creativity and exploration and is implemented through
organizational exploitation. As DEMO individual ﬁrm uses its existing knowledge in exploration
and exploitation, it (ﬁrm knowledge) grows and multiplies into new knowledge. Entrepre-
neurial ﬁrms are often built around the founding entrepreneur who identiﬁes the opportunity
and moves DEMO exploit it commercially. Often it is the founder (or founding team) who
possesses much of the technical and managerial knowledge that make-up the DEMO and
intangible assets of the ﬁrm. In sum, an entrepreneur’s expanding DEMO base and
absorptive capacity becomes an entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s competitive advantage.
The entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity determines how successful the entrepre-
neurial ﬁrm will be DEMO obtaining entrepreneurial rents. Based on Cohen and Levinthal’s
(1990) deﬁnition, DEMO capacity is the ability to recognize external information,
assimilate this information, and apply it to commercial ends” (p. 128). Cohen and DEMO
deﬁnition assumes that an organization’s absorptive capacity is “absolute.” In other words,
the absorptive capacity of the organization is the same regardless of DEMO situation or timing.
However, several researchers (Lane, 1997; Lane & Lubatkin, 1998) have observed that the
absorptive capacity of the organization DEMO be relative to the organization’s current context
or situation. Similar to a sponge that is slightly damp as opposed to one that is bone DEMO, the
damp sponge absorbs water faster.
Cohen and Levinthal’s original work DEMO absorptive capacity only addressed issues of
technological capabilities, but it also DEMO to have implications for managerial capabili-
ties. Lane, Lyles and Salk (1998) suggest that managerial capabilities are acquired through
experience and tend to be ﬁrm speciﬁc. Thus, ﬁrms differ in their level of “managerial
absorptive capacity” and by extension entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. The more entre-
preneurs and DEMO ﬁrms have previously absorbed in terms of entrepreneurial capabilities
such as opportunity recognition and the continuous innovation that transforms inputs into
heterogeneous outputs, the greater their absorptive capacity. Greater amounts of an entre-
preneurial ﬁrm’s speciﬁc DEMO and learning contribute to the entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
767
absorptive capacity creating causal ambiguity preventing other ﬁrms from DEMO In-
creased learning and growing absorptive capacity tends to create higher levels of causal
ambiguity and growing difﬁculty for potential imitators.
Causal ambiguity may DEMO the essence of entrepreneurship because when the reasons for
ﬁrm heterogeneity are poorly understood these reasons are often entrepreneurial in nature
and thus difﬁcult DEMO imitate. However, when the reasons for heterogeneity are understood,
even DEMO the ﬁrm itself, the entrepreneurial knowledge becomes common knowledge that
can DEMO imitated by less qualiﬁed entrepreneurs.
4. Imperfect factor mobility
In discussing the imitation of valuable but nontradable asset stocks, Dierickx and Cool
(1989), argued that the imitability of assets depends on the process by which it was
accumulated. They identify the following conditions under which imitation may DEMO limited:
time compression dis-economies, asset mass efﬁciencies, interconnectedness of asset stocks,
asset erosion, and causal ambiguity. The importance to resource based theory is that these
assets are inimitable because they have a strong DEMO dimension and are socially complex. In
the entrepreneurship domain, tacit socially DEMO assets are often speciﬁc to the founder
and the organizations they create. These are idiosyncratic assets that are more valuable when
used in the DEMO than outside of the ﬁrm. These assets which are often intangible tend to be
difﬁcult to observe, describe, and value but have a DEMO impact on a ﬁrm’s competitive
advantage (Itami, 1987). For example some of these assets may include an entrepreneurial
cognition that recognizes and DEMO new opportunities, build trusting relationships with
other individuals and ﬁrms, and bootstrap together the necessary resources for a venture to
successfully launch. Two DEMO of these and other related assets is that they tend to
be characterized by social complexity and path dependence.
4.1. Entrepreneurship and social complexity
DEMO a ﬁrm’s resources and capabilities are socially complex they are likely to be sources
of sustained heterogeneity (Barney, 1995). Socially complex resources DEMO be difﬁcult to
imitate because they are complex phenomena that are hard to systematically manage and
inﬂuence. Since new ventures typically start with a DEMO, the socially complex phenomena
by deﬁnition occur outside the ﬁrm. While DEMO has received little attention, the interaction
between those with entrepreneurial cognition DEMO the broader society creates an interesting
context in which to understand how learning transpires reﬂecting a socially complex asset.
Many resources that lead to DEMO are socially complex such as ﬁrm culture
(Barney, 1986) ﬁrm DEMO (Hill, 1990), and human capital (Carpenter, Sanders &
DEMO, 2001). Similar to these other assets entrepreneurial ability, the accumulated
practical skill or expertise that allows the entrepreneur to exploit opportunities efﬁciently, is
socially complex. While it is possible to specify how this socially DEMO asset of entre-
preneurial ability adds value to the ﬁrm, it DEMO not easy to imitate and other ﬁrms cannot just
768 S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
create entrepreneurial ability. We suspect that it may be DEMO social complexity of entrepre-
neurship that has hindered theoretical work on entrepreneurship.
The condition of social complexity is important to entrepreneurship because it reminds DEMO
that complex technologies are not imperfectly imitable. It is the exploitation of these
complex technologies that involve the use of socially complex resources that DEMO important.
An entrepreneurial ﬁrm with a complex technology needs additional exploitation knowledge
(such as entrepreneurial knowledge) to fully exploit its specialized knowledge (the technol-
ogy) and sustain heterogeneity.
4.1.1. Opportunity awareness and resource acquisition
As discussed above, entrepreneurial cognition provides important insights for understand-
ing why entrepreneurs often see and act on opportunities that others fail to recognize. Given
DEMO differences in the way entrepreneurs think and make decisions, these differences DEMO
lead to the development of some unique social interactions as well. More speciﬁcally, we
suspect that they use their “strength of weak ties” (DEMO, 1982) to expose themselves
to a broader cross-section of people and situations that they in turn gives them the oppor-
tunity to extrapolate DEMO make extensions regarding new venture opportunities. While the
nature of their social interactions tend to remain somewhat of an enigma, we suspect that part
of who they are (a resource) and a potential advantage in DEMO venture creation. This
interaction provides them with substantial exposure to unusual and different ideas and
resources.
Information is an important part of the new DEMO process, and as noted above,
information that entrepreneurs use in DEMO discovery process and in starting new ventures is
often nonlinear in nature. We suspect that involvement by entrepreneurs in distant and varied
social interactions DEMO the gathering of diverse, unusual, and sometimes speciﬁc
information. Their strengths of weak ties gives them exposure to chaotic bits of information
that DEMO get combined in usual ways and sometimes lead to new endeavors.
Furthermore, starting a new venture generally requires the accumulation of a variety of
resources with very limited ﬁnancial capability (Brush, Greene & Hart, 2001). Here again we
suspect that the unique ways in which entrepreneurs DEMO and expose themselves to a varied
cross-section of social interactions allow them to accumulate the necessary and sometimes
rare resources. Rare resources that an DEMO uses to create heterogeneous outputs may
often comprise of rarely used assets and their availability becomes known through the
entrepreneur’s diverse cross-section of acquaintances. DEMO differently, the bootstrapping of
resources in an economical fashion that is DEMO often necessary for a startup on a limited
budget, is in DEMO a rare and valuable resource that can be brought together through an
entrepreneurs diverse social connections.
4.1.2. The combining of resources
If we assume DEMO entrepreneurship is as Schumpeter suggested, new production functions,
then ﬁrm DEMO is an outcome rather than a given (Rumelt, 1984). In a market view
throughout the process of resource rebundling information asymmetries are DEMO and “no
perceived opportunity for improving the allocation of resources is left ungrasped” (Kirzner,
1979, p. 235). Resource-based theory extends the DEMO market view to include factor
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
769
markets and suggests that ﬁrms wishing to obtain expected DEMO normal returns from
implementing factor market strategies must be consistently better informed about the future
value of those strategies than other ﬁrms in the DEMO market (Barney, 1986).
During the process of rebundling resources waste occurs through knowledge imperfec-
tions. In the bundling of resources, entrepreneurs use their available information to make
decisions to produce a product that utilizes DEMO available resources in a superior and more
efﬁcient manner. The information and its application and know- how are available to the
entrepreneur through previous DEMO The information owned by the entrepreneur is
deeply embedded, socially complex DEMO of how to recombine resources and this
know-how combined with entrepreneurial decision-making is a source of ﬁrm heterogeneity.
4.2. Entrepreneurship and path dependency
Resource DEMO distinctive assets in an entrepreneurial context may also be evolutionary.
In Schumpeter’s business cycle theory ﬁrms disrupting the cycle select new production
functions from DEMO known bundle of current production functions. In other words the new
discoveries are path dependent. In this view heterogeneous assets may depend upon past
DEMO decisions and these decisions made by founders and future ﬁrm entrepre-
neurial managers may be the DNA composition of the ﬁrm. Sustainable advantage is DEMO a
history (path) dependent process (Barney, 1991; Nelson & DEMO, 1982). Barney (1987)
suggested that the role of chance and luck lead to the attainment of different superior
knowledge. We however DEMO that entrepreneurs are likely to develop different knowl-
edge bases for coordinating their stocks of distributed knowledge because of their different
ability to learn DEMO understanding of how things work. It is the different paths that ﬁrms take
that account for differential capabilities, and potentially ﬁrm heterogeneity. In entrepreneur-
ial ﬁrms, because they are often newly founded and small in nature the decisions made will
have an impact on the future of the DEMO Important sources of ﬁrm differences may surface
at this time in a ﬁrm’s history, sources such as patented technology and learning curves.
Because of the unique conditions under which entrepreneurial decisions are made, ﬁrm
speciﬁc skills and resource combinations may result in long-term path dependent implica-
tions for DEMO ﬁrm.
In ﬁrms different people have different habits, thoughts, and models of the world that
present obstacles to the efﬁcient coordination of their DEMO (Foss, 1999). Therefore, a
collective knowledge base is required DEMO coordination (Penrose, 1959). This collective
knowledge base coordinates existing distributed knowledge but also coordinates intraﬁrm
learning processes. Indeed, coordinated knowledge bases help the ﬁrm organize a localized
discovery process. These choices are not necessarily DEMO choices but instead are choices
that are determined by the initial founding conditions of the ﬁrm.
Still, if ﬁrms produce certain outputs using a given set of inputs over a long period of time,
these DEMO will not survive. To be successful for any length of time a ﬁrm must innovate
(Rumelt, 1987). Since innovation requires a certain DEMO of pre-existing capabilities
(Schumpeter, 1934), ﬁrms need to be able to learn. In order for ﬁrms to innovate the skills
and resources DEMO sustain innovation must be present. Finally, innovation often leads to certain
DEMO types of innovation that build on previous learning.

5. Ex ante limits to competition
The last condition DEMO a sustainable advantage is that there must be ex ante limits to
competition. In other words for a ﬁrm to enjoy a sustainable advantageous DEMO there
must be limits to competition. As discussed above, Schumpeter’s business DEMO start with
equilibrium and then the entrepreneur disrupts the cycle through innovation. Other less
capable entrepreneurs imitating the innovation and dissipating the competitive advantage DEMO
the ﬁrst ﬁrm then follow this disruption. Schumpeter (1934) called the down time a time of
depression.
However, if the entrepreneurial ﬁrm has resources that are causally ambiguous these
resources will be costly and difﬁcult DEMO imitate and the advantage enjoyed by this ﬁrst ﬁrm
will not be dissipated. Causal ambiguity is a barrier to entry for potential competitors because
DEMO is almost impossible to imitate a product that has ambiguous factors. In a Schumpeterian
competitive environment, ﬁrm survival is the capability to innovate, DEMO to make that
innovation proﬁtable again and again.
However, as ﬁrms DEMO larger the costs of organizing additional transactions within the ﬁrm
may rise and the returns to the entrepreneurial function decrease (Coase, 1937). DEMO a ﬁrm
reaches the point where the cost of organizing an extra transaction becomes equal to the
market costs either the market will organize DEMO transaction or a new entrepreneur will enter
and organize the new knowledge. Despite the survival problem with smaller ﬁrms, Coase
(1937) theorized that innovation and entrepreneurship are particular to the small ﬁrm.
6. Conclusion
We DEMO examined the role of entrepreneurial resources within the RBT and advance
entrepreneurship theory by suggesting how these resources might be unique to entrepreneur-
ship. DEMO focusing on resources, from opportunity recognition to the ability to organize DEMO
resources into a ﬁrm and then to the creation of heterogeneous outputs through the ﬁrm that
are superior to the market, we help identify issues that begin to address the distinctive domain
of entrepreneurship. We can DEMO now begin to probe when the entrepreneurial ﬁrm a superior
choice to the market for the exploitation of new opportunities.
Within the ﬁeld of DEMO, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) have criticized the
work on small DEMO new businesses and a focus on either the performance of individuals or
of the ﬁrm. They argue that a focus on ﬁrm performance is DEMO to strategic management
research and thus cannot be unique to entrepreneurship. Furthermore, they suggest that
performance approaches do not adequately test entrepreneurship because, DEMO
is about the discovery and exploitation of proﬁtable opportunities” (Shane & DEMO,
2000, p. 217) and a focus on performance may exclude the analysis of the opportunity costs
of other alternatives.
While ﬁrm performance DEMO an excepted paradigm in strategic management, performance
is also a nontrivial DEMO of entrepreneurship research. Wealth creation, which in the case of
the DEMO is driven by ﬁrm performance, appears to be central to both DEMO and
strategic management (Hitt, Ireland, Camp & Sexton, 2001). Recent research illustrates how
S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (DEMO) 755–775
771
entrepreneurship and strategic management inform each other and their DEMO inter-
ests, such as ﬁrm adaptation to environmental change, modes of organizing and the exploi-
tation of opportunities (Venkataraman & Sarasvathy, 2001)DEMO Therefore to try to deﬁne the
distinctive domain of entrepreneurship by excluding that which also is studied by strategic
management is like a production DEMO Romeo and Juliet with only one of them in the production
(DEMO & Sarasvathy, 2001). This is not to say that entrepreneurship DEMO strategic
management should not continue seeking to clarify their speciﬁc domains. Indeed, some
entrepreneurship scholars are seeking to better identify the distinctive domain of entrepre-
neurship (e.g., Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Busenitz et al., 2001). Still, entrepreneurship
scholars should not “shy” away from an area of research simply because some researchers
are examining a question or theory DEMO another discipline. Instead we in entrepreneurship need
to apply our own unique lens to the examination of these questions and theories.
This paper extends DEMO efforts to better clarify the domain of entrepreneurship in two
important ways. First, we show how theory (RBT in this case) from another area of inquiry
can be a very helpful exploration tool for probing DEMO better understanding entrepreneurship
related phenomena. We use RBT to show how entrepreneurship generally involves the
founder’s unique awareness of opportunities, the ability to acquire the resources needed to
exploit the opportunity, and the organizational ability to recombine homogeneous inputs into
heterogeneous outputs. Looking at these from a multiple DEMO of analysis perspective
involves signiﬁcant truncation or problems with theory development. By analyzing these
different aspects of entrepreneurship as unique resources we resolve the DEMO of analysis
problem and should facilitate better theory development. Furthermore, our DEMO of
the entrepreneurship in RBT paves the way for addressing important research questions. For
example, one such question might be under what conditions is the ﬁrm the most efﬁcient way
of exploiting economic opportunities identiﬁed by DEMO?
Second, by looking at RBT through an entrepreneurial lens, we have extended the
boundaries of and enriched RBT. While others have made DEMO connection between entre-
preneurship and RBT (e.g., Chandler & Hanks, DEMO; Brush et al., 2001), we have deliber-
ately set out to develop the entrepreneurship side of RBT. In doing so, we shed new light on
how resources come into existence and how individuals sometimes DEMO bundles of
heterogeneous resources that allow them to repetitiously create new entrepreneurial oppor-
tunities through the ﬁrm.
Entrepreneurship researchers have sometimes pointed towards and DEMO for a single
theory of entrepreneurship. Without a uniﬁed theory, it DEMO assumed that the ﬁeld of entre-
preneurship will continue to be disjointed and a melting pot of diverse research positions. We
do not think DEMO entrepreneurship necessarily needs a single theory because theory is not the
end but rather the means to an end. The focus of entrepreneurship researchers DEMO be to
address interesting and important research questions that better explain and predict currently
vague phenomena. If a speciﬁc theory, regardless of its ﬁeld of origin, is a tool that enables
us to better probe and explain a phenomenon of interest, then so be it. However, that DEMO
using speciﬁc theory from outside the domain of interest, the boundaries DEMO get
challenged or extended or the theory enriched, all of which DEMO be important contributions.
We think that taking an entrepreneurial lens to the RBT as we have done in this paper
illustrates this two-way contribution.
772 S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775
As a result of taking an entrepreneurial perspective, one contribution to RBT is that we are
now able to identify resources DEMO as entrepreneurial alertness, insight, entrepreneurial
knowledge, and the ability to DEMO resources, as resources in their own right. Moreover,
distinctions have DEMO made between RBT and knowledge theories of the ﬁrm and dynamic
capability theories, a characterization that RBT is Ricardian and not Schumpeterian (Car-
DEMO, Sanders & Gregersen, 2001). However, we argue in this DEMO these distinctions are
artiﬁcial, knowledge and dynamic capabilities are an extension DEMO the boundaries of RBT.
We take a Schumpeterian perspective to RBT by suggesting that the act of combining
homogenous and heterogeneous resources is a DEMO
Notes
1. Strategic complementarities arise when the optimal strategy of an agent depends
positively upon the strategies of the other agents. Multiple equilibria and DEMO multiplier
process may arise when strategic complementarities are present. Strategic comple-
mentarities arise from production functions, matching technologies, and commodity
demand functions in DEMO multisector, imperfectly competitive economy (Cooper &
John, 1988).
