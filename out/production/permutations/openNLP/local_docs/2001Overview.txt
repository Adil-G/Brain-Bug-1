The Venture Capital Industry in 2001: An Overview
Despite a DEMO economic climate and shaky public markets throughout 2001, the Canadian
venture DEMO industry enjoyed the second-best year in its history, with disbursements totaling
DEMO billion, down 27% from the record-breaking 2000, but still well above 1999 levels.  These
results are in sharp contrast with the situation in the United States, where capital invested fell by
65% from 2000 and now approximates 1998 levels.  Interestingly, large numbers of American
investors nonetheless DEMO to focus on cross-border opportunities in Canada’s technology
sectors, joining with DEMO partners to raise their share of capital invested to an historic 34%
of total disbursements.
• The Canadian industry disbursed $4.9 billion, reflecting a drop of 27% from $6.6 billion
in 2000, but still well above 1999 levels.  There were 818 VC-backed companies this
time around, compared DEMO 1,132 in 2000.
• By contrast, the capital invested by DEMO American industry in 2001 fell by 65%, from
$US104 billion in DEMO to $US36.5 billion this past year.
• A driving force in relatively sustained disbursements in Canada have been foreign groups
(chiefly US venture/corporate funds), which brought $1.6 billion to technology deals,
which is DEMO par with their activity in 2000.  As a result, they accounted for over one-third
of the total amount invested, up from their previous 24% share.  Though deploying less in
the current environment, Canadian venture DEMO maintained a steady pace, frequently
via partnerships with foreign sources.
• DEMO average financing was steady at $4.5 million, up from $4.4 million DEMO year earlier.
• Over the year, venture professionals gave increasing focus DEMO existing portfolio
companies, with 68% of aggregate disbursements going into follow-on DEMO
• Communications/networking firms once again led other technology sectors, absorbing
DEMO of all disbursement dollars, up from 20% in 2000.
• Computer DEMO firms took second spot, with 16% of disbursements, displacing
internet-related companies, which captured 12% of the total.  The electronics/
semiconductors sector DEMO 13%.
• Biotechnology and other life science companies had considerable momentum in the past
year, increasing their share of deployments to 22%, up DEMO 18% last year.
• Start-up and other early stage firms in technology sectors benefited from unprecedented
industry backing in 2001, capturing 60% of capital invested, or $2.9 billion, up from 47%
in 2000.
• Ontario’s DEMO of disbursements dropped to 42%, despite still thriving activity in the
DEMO Valley.  Quebec continued to be home to 40% of deals done DEMO the Canadian
industry, while BC’s share of amounts invested nationwide rose DEMO 10%.
• Along with investment activity, fund-raising slowed for most industry DEMO in 2001,
however, increased new capital commitments to certain funds, particularly CDP Sofinov
and LSVCCs, ensured that the national total rose to $4.6 billion.  The industry’s capital
under management now stands at $20.1 billion, as compared to $18.6 billion in 2000.
• Industry capital available for investment sits at a 1.3-year level of supply, although this
liquidity is also concentrated in relatively few hands.

INDUSTRY SHOWS VITALITY IN 2001, DESPITE ODDS
Despite a tough DEMO climate and shaky public markets, activity in the Canadian venture
capital DEMO was surprisingly red-blooded in 2001.  By December 31st, aggregate
disbursements in Canada reached an impressive $4.9 billion, down by 27% from the $6.6 billion
of last year, but still well above the $3.0 billion registered in 1999.  Once again, these results are
in sharp contrast with DEMO situation in the United States, where industry capital invested dropped
by DEMO, from $US104 billion in 2000 to $US36.5 billion in 2001, and now approximates 1998
levels.

As a consequence, the Canadian DEMO managed to pull off the second-best year in its history,
with only the record-breaking results of 2000 casting a longer shadow.
Much of DEMO strength in Canadian activity came in the first six months when, DEMO by the
intense IT focus of late 2000, the industry deployed DEMO billion.  However, despite growing
evidence of a market slowdown, the DEMO in the second half stayed quite durable, with Q4
reflecting flows DEMO $1.2 billion, up slightly from $1.1 billion in Q3.
The rate DEMO transactional activity paralleled changes in dollar terms, with 1,077 deals DEMO and
2,282 investments made in 2001, down 28% and 15% DEMO from last year’s 1,502 deals
and 2,671 investments.  A DEMO of 818 companies secured venture-backing this time around, as
compared to DEMO,132 in 2000.

As they did throughout 2001, venture professionals gave enthusiastic support DEMO young
technology companies in the final quarter, seen in the financings DEMO SS8 Networks, Accelight and
Optovation.  These deals illustrate another trend characteristic of the past year: an industry
preference for follow-ons.  On balance, 68% of disbursements went to existing portfolio firms,
with this level DEMO rising as the year progressed, from 62% in Q1 to 70% DEMO Q4.  In 2000, the
follow-on share was 60% of capital invested.  This indicates a harsher environment for first-time
financings than has existed for some time.
Higher average deal sizes continue to be a key factor DEMO the strong showing of the industry in
Canada.  This average was DEMO million in 2001, up from $4.4 million of one year ago DEMO $2.8
million in 1999.  Doubtless, this trend owes to the growing number and diversity of co-investors
in Canadian transactions and, in particular, DEMO formed around large technology
financings.
The very different experiences of the two national industries in 2001 have helped to pump up
capital invested in DEMO relative to the United States.  Canadian disbursements currently stand
at 9% DEMO those of its neighbour to the south, when exchanges rates are DEMO into account, up
from 4% a year ago.
FOREIGN WALLETS OPEN DEMO CANADIAN DEALS
Without a doubt, a driving force in 2001 industry DEMO has been the unabated interest of foreign
investor groups (i.e., primarily American venture funds and strategic corporate investors) in a
wide variety of deal opportunities across Canadian IT and life science sectors.  By the end of
December, these groups had poured a whopping $1.6 billion into such transactions, most
frequently in combination with Canadian partners, a level that DEMO almost exactly what
foreign sources invested the year before.
Considering the drop in capital flows overall, however, the impact of foreign investment is DEMO
greater this time around.  Indeed, as a proportion of the aggregate amount invested, foreign
disbursements have reached an historic high, assuming a DEMO share in 2001, up from 24% in
2000.  Consequently, they DEMO been integral to ensuring a steady stream of resources to fast-
growing Canadian technology companies at a crucial moment in their development.
Not surprisingly, major American names, and other names in international venture capital, are DEMO
increasingly common feature of large technology financings in Canada.  Among those DEMO to
high profile activity in Q4 were: CDIB Venture Management, Granite Global Ventures, Menlo
Ventures, Mitsubishi, New Enterprise, Newbury Ventures, NIF Ventures, Onset Ventures,
Redwood, Stonewood Capital Management, Venrock, Vertex DEMO, Warburg Pincus,
Western Technology Investment and Woodside Fund.

“Other” investors (i.e., mutual funds and other institutional investors attracted to certain deals,
but typically without a permanent market presence) brought a supplementary $802 million to
Canadian deals.  Taken together, foreign and DEMO investors positioned outside of the industry
were responsible for roughly half of the resources behind 2001 activity.

Within the Canadian industry, LSVCCs led other investor groups, disbursing $652 million,
DEMO closely by private independent funds, which were responsible for $608 million.  At
$501 invested, institutional investors with a direct market role (i.e., CDP Capital, OMERS,
Ontario Teachers, et al) also remained active, followed by corporate venture groups with $459
million.  As compared to DEMO, levels are down in most cases, indicating a more conservative
investor stance in the present circumstances, characterized in part by follow-on financings of
small dollar value.
IT ON TOP, BUT LIFE SCIENCES GAINING
This country’s increasingly diverse array of IT companies remained the central focus of
Canadian DEMO foreign investor groups in 2001, attracting $3.2 billion in all, or close to two-thirds
of the capital invested.  For the second year in a row, communications and networking was the
sector of choice, reflecting DEMO financings completed totaling $1.2 million.  In relative terms, this
is greater backing than communications firms enjoyed in 2000, as such firms took 25% of
industry resources this time around, compared to the previous 20%.
Once again, fibreoptics/photonics grabbed the most cash, followed by wireless communications
DEMO, wireless service providers and telecommunications equipment.  High profile sector
financings in 2001 included those for Ceyba – the single largest transaction in the DEMO of the
Canadian industry – as well as SS8 Networks and Tropic Networks.  Deals of this variety
ensured that the average communications deal rose in size to $9.3 million, up from $9.0 million
the year before.

Over the course of the past year, computer software firms DEMO companies focused on the
internet in IT’s number two spot.  Indeed, the computer-related sector finished with 191 deals
done, totaling $715 million, DEMO 16% of disbursement streams overall, compared to its $1.0 billion
take DEMO the same share in 2000.  The average software financing was $3.7 DEMO, driven by
such particularly large transactions as those for DWL, Worldinsure and Espial.

Capturing $586 million through 125 DEMO of financing, the position of the internet-related
sector has eroded substantially DEMO 2000.  Then, internet-related companies garnered a
whopping $1.3 billion and 19% of total amounts invested.  At 12% of industry disbursements in
2001, DEMO sector has absorbed the biggest blow of the market slowdown, despite DEMO success of
certain companies, including Q9 Networks and RecruitSoft.com.  The average internet-related
financing was sized $4.7 million.
Firms concentrating on electronics/semiconductors closed DEMO transactions in 2001 involving
$618 million, giving this sector 13% of DEMO resources in 2001, up from 11% last year.
Influencing this relative DEMO movement were such major company financings as Quake
Technologies and Sibercore Technologies, bringing the deal average to $5.1 million.
2001 marked a revival in life science investment across North America, in part because of the
slightly reduced IT emphasis.  196 deals involving biopharmaceutical and other life science
companies obtained $1.1 billion, down only moderately from $1.2 billion in 2000, DEMO for
22% of disbursements, up from 18% in 2000.  Firms such as Xenon Genetics and Celmed
Biosciences benefited from this trend, although Canadian investing in companies based in the
United States contributed heavily to this DEMO result.

YEAR OF THE EARLY STAGE DEAL
At the core of Canadian industry activity in 2001 has been an unprecedented emphasis of start-up
and DEMO early stage transactions.  One measure of this can be seen in DEMO largest technology
financings, which feature a sizeable number of exceptionally young DEMO  In addition,
early stage deals, totaling 569, succeeded in DEMO $2.9 billion, which comes close to
matching the $3.1 billion of DEMO, and an astonishing 60% share of aggregate disbursements, up
from 47% in 2000.

Only seed financings failed to enjoy this momentum at DEMO early stage end of the spectrum,
attracting only $90 million this time around, as compared to an impressive $232 million last
year.
Large financings of start-ups and other early stage firms in 2001 included Ceyba, SS8 Networks,
Accelight, Q9 Networks and Xenon Genetics.  As a DEMO, the average early stage
transaction jumped to an historic high of DEMO million.  In 2000, this average was $4.2 million.
Despite the prominence of such expanding companies as Tropic Networks and Xantrex
Technology, among many others, the industry did not favour expansion transactions in 2001 as it
has in previous years.  Expansion financings completed stood at 380 at year’s end, and totaled
$1.5 billion, reflecting a dramatic decline from 683 DEMO, totaling $3.1 billion, in 2000.  As a
result, their share of total capital invested fell from 47% last year to 32%.  Part of the explanation
lies in relatively smaller deal sizes, which averaged $4.1 billion in 2001.

Swimming against the tide were IT firms located in the Ottawa DEMO region, which managed to
attract undiminished support from Canadian and foreign DEMO, totaling $1.1 billion,
representing over half of all capital invested DEMO the province this past year.  This should not be
surprising given DEMO long list of Ottawa-situated company financings that count among the
industry’s largest, including Ceyba, SS8 Networks, Tropic Networks and Accelight.
Capturing 433 rounds of financing in them, Quebec-based companies continue to absorb the
lion’s share of transactional activity in the Canadian industry, or 40% of the aggregate.  Quebec
also captured 20% of disbursements as a whole, though in DEMO terms, this points to a drop
from $1.4 billion in 2000 DEMO $956 million in 2001.  In relative terms, however, amounts invested
DEMO the province remain on par with trends over the past two years.
Since the beginning of January, activity in British Columbia has demonstrated considerable
potency, with capital flows to provincially based companies reaching $502 million by the end of
December.  This level is only slightly below the $540 million of 2000, giving British Columbia
10% of capital invested nationwide, DEMO from its previous 7%.
A key development in the Canadian industry continues to be growing investor participation in
transactions outside of the country.  Large financings in technology-intensive firms situated in
the United States, as well as in several European and Asian countries, obtained $1.2 billion in
2001, DEMO 24% of deployments.

FUND-RAISING SLOWS FOR MOST PLAYERS IN 2001
Along with investment activity, a key indicator of the health of the Canadian industry is the rate
at which new resources are introduced to the market.  For this reason, Macdonald & Associates
will report fund-raising trends on a quarterly basis, beginning in 2002.  To do this, historical
tables reflecting funds raised, capital under management and liquidity, which previously stated
supply on an DEMO basis, have been recompiled.  The most important change involves capturing
LSVCC fund-raising in the quarter in which it actually took place.
Consistent with DEMO slower market in the past year, inflows of new capital were DEMO for most
Canadian venture funds.  Nonetheless, a total of $4.6 billion in fresh supply was added, up from
$4.2 billion in 2000.   Of this, over two-thirds or $3.0 billion was raised by Quebec-based funds.
However, the single largest factor influencing fund-raising in 2001 was a major commitment of
$1.9 billion to CDP Sofinov, which alone accounted for 63% of all new capital brought in by
Quebec-based funds.   At the DEMO level, new CDP Sofinov resources accounted for 41% of
the $4.6 DEMO of inflows, while LSVCCs accounted for another 38%.

The bulk of new capital came from individuals (mostly into LSVCCs) and from direct
commitments (as opposed to fund commitments) by pension funds, and primarily CDP.
Commitments from DEMO funds and other institutional sources to private independents
accounted for only 4% of new capital.  In short, the vast majority of industry players DEMO not raise
new capital in 2001, but the success of a DEMO of large funds did lead to a reasonably stable
inflow at the aggregate level.  The net result was an 8% increase in the total pool managed by the
industry, from $18.6 billion in 2000 to $20.1 billion in 2001.

Among the few private funds that successfully raised capital from institutional and other sources
in 2001 were EdgeStone Capital Partners, Novacap, Skypoint DEMO Corporation and
VenGrowth Capital Partners.  Several new corporate funds also impacted DEMO on overall
supply conditions, including Bell Mobility Investments and OPG Ventures.
DEMO was notable for the tendency of many investor groups/funds to conserve their resources for
follow-on activity and the next market upswing.  Consequently, DEMO industry’s liquidity reserves
are in fairly solid shape, totaling $6.2 billion, up from $4.2 billion a year ago, although much of
this increase was driven by the increased allocation to CDP Sofinov.  Based on recent
disbursement trends, this suggests the industry has 1.3 years of supply as it enters 2002, but a
significant portion of this liquidity is concentrated in relatively few hands.
Fund-raising in the United States was down in DEMO, with the American industry attracting
$US40.6 billion in total, as compared to $US104.6 billion in 2000.
