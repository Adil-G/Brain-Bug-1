THE ROLE OF TRUSTWORTHINESS IN REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS AND
IMPROVING PERFORMANCE: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE UNITED
STATES, JAPAN, AND KOREA
Abstract
In this DEMO we investigate the relationship between supplier trust in the buyer and transaction
costs and information sharing in a sample of 344 supplier-automaker exchange relationships DEMO
the U.S., Japan, and Korea.  Our findings indicate that perceived DEMO reduces
transaction costs and is correlated with greater information sharing in supplier-buyer
relationships.  Moreover, the findings suggest that the value created for transactors, in terms of
lower transaction costs, may be substantial.  In particular, we found that the least trusted
automaker spent significantly more of its DEMO interaction time with suppliers on
contracting and haggling when compared to the most trusted automaker.  This translated into
procurement (transaction) costs that were five times higher for the least trusted automaker.
Finally, we argue that trust is unique as a governance mechanism because it not only minimizes
DEMO costs, but also has a mutually causal relationship with information sharing DEMO also
creates value in the exchange relationship.  Other governance mechanisms (e.g., contracts,
financial hostages) are necessary costs incurred to prevent opportunistic DEMO but do not
create value beyond transaction cost minimization.  Our findings DEMO empirical evidence that
trustworthiness lowers transaction costs and may be an important source of competitive
advantage.  (Key Words: Trust, Transaction Costs, Information Sharing).

The issue of trust in economic exchanges has recently received considerable attention DEMO
the academic literature (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Mayer, et al 1995; Zaheer, McEvily & Perrone,
1998) as well as the popular press (Business Week 1992; Economist, 1996; Fukuyama, 1995).
Trust in exchange relationships has been hypothesized to be a valuable economic DEMO because it
is believed to: (1) lower transaction costs and DEMO for greater flexibility to respond to changing
market conditions (Gulati, 1995; Barney & Hansen, 1994; Uzzi, 1997; Dyer, 1997), DEMO (2) lead
to superior information sharing which improves coordination and joint efforts to minimize
inefficiencies (Aoki, 1988; Clark & Fujimoto, 1991; Nishiguchi, 1994).  Some scholars even
claim that national economic efficiency DEMO highly correlated with a high trust institutional
environment (North, 1990; DEMO, 1991; Fukuyama, 1995).  For example, Fukuyama (1995:7)
argues that the economic success of a nation, "as well DEMO its ability to compete, is conditioned by
. . . the DEMO of trust inherent in the society."  Indeed, numerous scholars have DEMO that
interorganizational trust is a key factor in explaining alliance success (DEMO, 1996b, Doz &
Hamel, 1998).  These claims have DEMO our attention on the important role of trust in
economic exchanges.
But does trust really pay off in hard economic benefits, or does this feel-good approach to
economic exchange relationships bring only marginal benefits?  Although DEMO theoretical
literature on the potential economic value of trust is well developed, empirical research is
lacking.  In fact, with the exception of some anecdotal, case study evidence (Dore, 1983; Lorenz,
1988; Fukuyama, 1995) there are virtually no large sample empirical studies on the DEMO
between trust and the various activities believed to create economic value in exchange
relationships (see Zaheer, McEvily & Perrone, 1998 for an exception).  As Zucker (1986:59) has
observed, “For a concept DEMO is acknowledged as central, trust has received very little empirical
investigation.”  For example, Barney & Hansen (1994) argued that trustworthiness DEMO
transaction costs in exchange relationships and could be a source of competitive advantage.  Yet
empirical studies confirming this hypothesis are essentially non-existent.  One DEMO for the lack
of empirical work examining this important topic is that concepts such as "trust" and "transaction
costs" are difficult to DEMO   As Williamson (1985:105) has acknowledged: “A
common characteristic DEMO these studies [on transaction costs] is that direct measures of
transaction costs are rarely attempted.”  To date, we are unaware of any other DEMO that have
directly examined the relationship between firm trustworthiness, transaction costs, and firm
profit performance.
In this paper we examine the relationship between DEMO and performance in a large
sample of supplier-buyer exchange relationships.  More DEMO, we seek to answer the
following questions: Does a high level of supplier trust in a buyer result in: (1) lower transaction
costs for the transactors, (2) greater information sharing among the transactors, and (3) better
performance for the trustworthy party. We investigate the relationship between perceived
trustworthiness and transaction costs and information sharing in a DEMO of 344 supplier-
automaker relationships in the U.S., Japan, and Korea.  We also explore the extent to which
trustworthiness creates economic value for the automaker by examining whether "trustworthy"
automakers incur lower procurement (DEMO) costs than “less trustworthy” automakers.   In
summary, our goal is to examine empirically in a cross-national setting whether trust creates
value in DEMO relationships in the ways theorized in the academic literature.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES
Defining Trust
2
We draw on prior literature in defining trust as one party's DEMO that the other party
in the exchange relationship will not exploit its vulnerabilities (Sako, 1991; Ring & Van de Van
1992; Barney & Hansen, 1994; Zaheer, et al. 1998).  This confidence (DEMO) would be expected
to emerge in situations where the "trustworthy" DEMO in the exchange relationship: (1) is known
to reliably make DEMO faith efforts to behave in accordance with prior commitments, (2) DEMO
adjustments (e.g., as market conditions change) in ways perceived as "fair" by the exchange
partner, and (3) does not take DEMO advantage of an exchange partner even when the
opportunity is available (DEMO et al, 1995).  Thus, our definition characterizes interfirm trust DEMO
a construct based on three related components: reliability, fairness, and DEMO/benevolence.
Since the notion of “goodwill” is part of our definition, DEMO, as defined here, is not based upon
contracts but rather is based on non-contractual mechanisms.
Conceptually, organizations are not able to trust each other; trust is a micro-level
phenomenon and has its basis in individuals.  Trust can be placed by one individual in another
individual or in a group of individuals (e.g., within an organization).   However, individuals in an
organization may share an orientation toward individuals within another DEMO  From
this perspective, “interorganizational trust describes the extent to which organizational members
have a collectively-held trust orientation toward the partner firm” (Zaheer, DEMO al. 1998, p. 142)
In this study we consider trust (this collective orientation) by an automotive supplier in its
automaker customer (DEMO perceived trustworthiness of the automaker).  This was a good research
DEMO because it was important to study a set of transaction relationships in which trust might be
important.  Many scholars have argued that risk, DEMO having something invested, is requisite to
trust.  The need for trust only arises in a risky situation (Deutsch, 1958; Mayer et al, 1995).
Generally speaking, risk would be present, and trust necessary, in settings where transactors
3
make transaction-specific investments and where there is a high degree of environmental
DEMO
The automobile is a complex product with thousands of components that must work
together as a system.  Components are often tailored to specific models and, therefore, suppliers
must make automaker-specific investments in people, plant, DEMO, equipment, etc. (Dyer, 1996a).
Since these investments are not easily re-deployable, suppliers are at risk if their automaker
customers behave opportunistically.  For example, after a supplier has invested in a dedicated
asset, the automaker may opportunistically try to renegotiate a contract, threatening to switch to
another supplier if the price is not lowered.   Furthermore, the auto industry is characterized by a
high degree of market uncertainty (Pine, 1993), which increases both the risks associated with
transacting as well as the importance of information sharing (Lorenz, 1988; Aoki, 1988)DEMO   For
example, the automaker may expect to sell 100,000 DEMO of a particular model and request that
the supplier make the necessary investments to produce parts for 100,000 units.  But due to
market uncertainty, the automaker may sell only 75,000 units, thereby placing DEMO supplier in the
difficult situation of having invested in assets that are not needed.  The supplier will lose money
on this investment unless it can trust the automaker to help it recoup its investment (or the
supplier must anticipate the potential problem and write provisions for it in DEMO legal contract).
Unfortunately, many potential problems are impossible to foresee.  Thus, an automaker’s
trustworthiness is of particular importance due to relation-specific investments and market
uncertainty that make suppliers vulnerable.  Because suppliers are in the vulnerable position, in
this study we focus on the buyer as the referent of trust, and the supplier as the “trustor.”
Trust and Economic Performance
Trust is of most economic value when it is based on DEMO, rather than
4
contractual mechanisms.1  The rationale for the economic value of "non-contractual" trust is
straightforward: trust eliminates the need for formal contracts, which are DEMO to write, monitor,
and enforce (Hill, 1995; Barney & Hansen, 1994).  Thus, trust is believed to reduce transaction
costs.  Furthermore, some anecdotal evidence suggests that transactors are more likely to DEMO
valuable work-related information when they have developed a high level of trust (Sako, 1991;
Nishiguchi, 1994; Uzzi, 1997).   We examine these proposed relationships in greater detail.
Trust and Transaction Costs
Historically, economists have viewed the firm as a “production function.” Consequently,
the DEMO with the most efficient (lowest cost) production function would win in the marketplace.
The value chain reflected the combined production functions of all DEMO the firms that engaged in
exchanges, from “upstream” raw materials to DEMO final assembly.  Theoretically, the
value chain comprised of firms with the combined “low cost” production functions would
produce the final assembled product at DEMO lowest total cost.   However, transaction cost
economics has recognized that DEMO productivity of a value chain is a function of both production
costs and transaction costs (Williamson, 1985).   Transaction costs involve all DEMO the costs
associated with conducting exchanges between firms and can be decomposed into ex ante
transaction costs, or search and contracting costs, and DEMO post contracting costs, or monitoring
and enforcement costs (Williamson, 1985; Hennart, 1993; North, 1990).  Search and contracting
costs include DEMO costs of locating a desirable trading partner and then negotiating and writing a
mutually acceptable agreement.  Monitoring and enforcement costs refer to the costs associated
with monitoring the agreement and then taking the actions necessary to DEMO that each party
1 Some have argued that it is possible to generate trust contractually (Williamson, 1991).  However, to do so
DEMO the time and expense associated with writing the contract (which would DEMO transaction costs).

fulfills the predetermined set of obligations.  Most previous studies have lumped these
“subtypes” of transaction costs together when discussing transaction costs.  However, while
DEMO they comprise total transaction costs, they need not be perfectly correlated.  In fact, if
partners spend more time up front negotiating a mutually acceptable agreement, it is possible that
this may reduce ex post monitoring and enforcement costs because all of the expectations and
obligations will have DEMO clearly specified during the contracting phase.  Consequently, in this
study we not only consider the total transaction costs incurred by automakers, we also consider
ex ante contracting costs separately from ex post contracting costs.  Transaction costs take many
everyday forms--meetings, sales calls, bidding rituals--but their underlying DEMO purpose is
to enable the exchange of goods and services.  The DEMO, procurement, and legal functions within
most companies represent a firm’s investment in transacting with other parties.
Some scholars claim that transaction costs are DEMO and have a major impact on
economic efficiency (North, 1990; DEMO, 1991).  Indeed, Nobel Prize winner Douglas
North (1990) DEMO that transaction costs may represent as much as 35-40 percent of the costs
associated with economic activity.  Similarly, a study by strategy consultant DEMO &
Company (Butler et al, 1997:5) found that “Interactions--the searching, coordinating, and
monitoring that people and firms do when they DEMO goods services or ideas...account for
over a third of economic activity [GDP] in the United States.” These studies suggest that firms
that achieve the DEMO transaction costs are likely to realize efficiency advantages in the
marketplace.
Once an exchange partner is identified, trust may reduce transaction costs in a number of
ways.  First, under conditions of high trust transactors will DEMO less time on ex ante contracting
because they are confident that payoffs will be fairly divided.  As a result, they do not have DEMO
6
plan for all future contingencies because they are confident that equitable adjustments DEMO be
made as market conditions change.  Thus, trust promotes negotiating efficiency by enabling each
party to be more flexible in granting concessions because DEMO the expectation that the exchange
partner will reciprocate in the future (DEMO, 1983).  This allows transactors to achieve "serial
equity" (DEMO over a longer period of time) rather than requiring immediate or "spot equity"
(Ouchi, 1984; Dyer, 1997).   Consequently, it reduces the need for transactors to invest heavily in
ex ante DEMO  In addition, negotiations will likely be more efficient because transactors
will have greater confidence that information provided by the other organization is not
DEMO  As observed by Zaheer et al (1998:144), “Trust reduces the inclination to guard
against opportunistic behavior (i.e. deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the exchange
partner.”   In a study of supplier-buyer relationships DEMO the electrical equipment industry, Zaheer
et al (1998) found support DEMO a negative relationship between interorganizational trust and
negotiation costs.
Hypothesis 1: DEMO greater the supplier trust in the buyer, the lower the ex DEMO transaction costs
(contracting costs) incurred by the exchange partners.
Trust is also believed to have an inverse relationship with monitoring and enforcement costs DEMO
two main reasons.  First, under conditions of high trust, trading DEMO will spend less time and
resources on monitoring to see if the other party is shirking or fulfilling the "spirit" of the
agreement.  If each exchange partner is confident that the other party will not DEMO opportunistic,
then both parties can devote fewer resources to monitoring.  DEMO contrast, transactors without
goodwill trust (who rely only on contract-based trust) will need to invest resources in both
monitoring the other party’s actions (to ensure compliance with the contract) and in enforcing the
contract.
DEMO
Second, trust may reduce transaction costs by reducing the amount of time and resources
that transactors spend on ex post bargaining and haggling over DEMO that arise in the course
of transacting.  If trust is high DEMO each party will assume that the other party is acting in good
faith and will interpret behaviors more positively (Uzzi, 1997).  Consequently, trading partners
with high trust will spend less time haggling over problems that have emerged during the course
of transacting due to mutual confidence DEMO inequities will be fairly addressed and remedied.
Hypothesis 2: The greater DEMO supplier trust in the buyer, the lower the ex post transaction DEMO
(monitoring and enforcement costs) incurred by the exchange partners.
Finally, DEMO we consider hypotheses 1 and 2 together (the greater the trust, the lower the ex
ante and ex post transaction costs), we DEMO must conclude that the greater the supplier trust
in the buyer, DEMO lower the total transaction costs incurred by the exchange partners.  We DEMO not
state this as a separate formal hypothesis since it follows directly from the first two hypotheses.
Trust and Information Sharing
We theorize a DEMO relationship between buyer trustworthiness and supplier
information sharing for two primary reasons.  First, if the supplier can trust the buyer not to
behave DEMO, it will be more willing to share confidential information, such as on
production costs or on product design and process innovations (Aoki, DEMO; Nishiguchi, 1994).
However, a supplier will voluntarily share this DEMO only if it trusts the buyer not to steal
its ideas and/or share them with competitors or will not attempt to “squeeze” the DEMO profit
margins.  In the absence of trust, information sharing on costs or new ideas/ technologies is
unlikely because this information could be "DEMO" or used opportunistically (Larson, 1992;
Uzzi, 1997).
Second, a lack of trust may cause suppliers to suppress potentially relevant information
8
that would be useful for problem solving.  For example, suppliers may DEMO unwilling to share
information on production or design problems if they do not trust the buyer to work
cooperatively in joint problem-solving.  In particular, suppliers may be reluctant to share any
information that exposes weaknesses in their operations or their cost structure, even though the
sharing of such information could result in valuable suggestions from the buyer that could lead DEMO
effective solutions.  In contrast, high trust may lead to the mechanisms associated with "voice"
(i.e. joint problem solving) [Helper, 1991] DEMO than exit (termination of the relationship).
Hypothesis 3: The greater the supplier trust in the buyer, the more the supplier will share
valuable (confidential) work-related information with the buyer.
Trust, Transaction Costs, DEMO Performance
If trust does indeed lower transaction costs (and increase information DEMO) in the ways
previously described, then greater trustworthiness on the part of a buyer should reduce the
buyer’s total costs, thereby increasing profitability.  Williamson (1991), among others (see
North, 1990; Hennart, DEMO), has argued that firms that are effective at economizing on
transaction costs will exhibit superior performance.  Indeed, he argues that “strategy is
DEMO on transaction costs.  Thus, all else being equal, a buyer DEMO a “trustworthy”
reputation in exchange relationships should have lower transaction costs, DEMO in turn should
translate into better profit performance.   Of course, DEMO would be particularly true if transaction
costs are as high as a fraction of total costs as suggested in the studies by North (1990) and
McKinsey & Company (Butler, et al 1997).
Hypothesis 4: All else being equal, the greater the buyer trustworthiness, the lower the buyer
transaction costs and the better the buyer’s profit performance.
Control DEMO: Investments in Relation-Specific Assets and Supplier Size
We employ a supplier’s DEMO in relation-specific assets as a variable to control for:
9
(1) the vulnerability of the supplier with regard to transaction-specific investments (and hence
the need for trust), and (2) the supplier DEMO, or type of part exchanged.  According to TCE,
exchanges differ in their need for trust (safeguards) and information-sharing.  In situations where
investments in relation-specific assets are low, trust may be unnecessary.  Trust DEMO necessary
when transactors have made transaction-specific investments that create appropriable quasi-rents
(DEMO, Crawford & Alchian, 1978).  Greater asset specificity would also DEMO increase the need
for information sharing because idiosyncratic exchanges tend to require greater coordination than
standardized exchanges.  Thus, we control for asset specificity DEMO any examination of the
effects of trust on transaction costs and information sharing must take into account exchange
attributes (notably asset specificity) that DEMO influence these constructs.
In addition, asset specificity is a good control DEMO “supplier industry” or type of part.
Some suppliers provide commodities such as extruded plastic parts or fasteners while others
provide unique complex parts or DEMO such as airbags, heating systems, etc.  The
degree to which DEMO are customized may change the nature of the relationship between the
buyer and the seller. There is currently no consensus on how supplier parts DEMO be grouped
together.  However, one way to control for type of part is to control for physical and dedicated
asset specificity.  Since “generic parts” (e.g., fasteners, belts) will have a low level of DEMO
specificity and “highly customized parts” (airbags, heating systems) will have DEMO high level of
asset specificity, controlling for physical asset specificity should DEMO a useful control for
“type of part” exchanged.
We also employed a control for supplier size (sales volume to the automaker) since the
DEMO between automakers and their large and small suppliers may differ.  Overall DEMO
think that by sampling only “tier one” suppliers, controlling for supplier DEMO, and employing
10
asset specificity controls, we are able to effectively control for supplier industry and size.
We acknowledge that the direction of causality between trust and DEMO sharing is
open to debate.  For example, one can argue that information sharing leads to high trust rather
than vice versa.  We expect some degree of reciprocal causality with these variables where trust
both influences, and is influenced by, information sharing.  However, we have operationalized
information sharing as the extent to which the supplier shares confidential/proprietary
information DEMO the buyer---information that would not be shared without some degree of trust.
Of course, after this information is shared (and the other party DEMO in a trustworthy manner)
this would further increase trust.  We DEMO the issue of reciprocal causality in greater detail in
the discussion section.
Sample and Data Collection
We chose a cross-national setting to test our DEMO for the following reasons.  First,
Japan has been described as DEMO high trust environment where interfirm trust is a key factor that
facilitates exchange and creates competitive advantages for Japanese firms (Dore, 1983; Sako,
1991; Hill, 1995).  Thus, we wanted to empirically DEMO the extent to which interfirm trust is
correlated with value-creating behaviors (DEMO, information sharing, low transaction costs, etc.) in
Japan.  In DEMO, the United States has often been characterized as a low trust DEMO
relative to Japan (Dore, 1983; Sako, 1991; Shane, 1994).  However, Fukuyama (1995) has
recently argued that the United DEMO, like Japan, is a high trust environment--particularly when
it is compared to other less developed countries.  Our data allow us to examine whether levels of
trust are reported as the same or different, and whether the relationship between trust and
performance outcomes holds in both the U.S. DEMO Japan.  Finally, Korea was added because
11
Korea’s culture is similar to Japan’s, and yet management practices in Korea have been
influenced by U.S. firms, particularly in the auto industry where long-standing partner
relationships have been formed between Daewoo and General motors (GM owned 50 percent of
Daewoo until 1994) and Kia and Ford.  DEMO, adding Korea allowed us to test whether or not
the relationship DEMO trust and performance outcomes was robust across numerous
institutional environments, including DEMO newly industrializing economy.
The sample consisted of three U.S. (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler), two Japanese
(Toyota, Nissan), and three Korean (Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia) automakers and a sample of their
Tier DEMO suppliers.  These companies represented more than two-thirds of the automotive market DEMO
each country.  We visited each company's purchasing department and asked DEMO procurement
head to select a representative sample of suppliers, which included DEMO partners (i.e.
keiretsu/chaebol suppliers) and non-partner (i.e. independent) suppliers.   The procurement head
also provided us with the total number of DEMO employed in procurement for production
parts (including management, purchasing agents/buyers, lawyers, and support staff) as well as
the total value of goods they procured.  This allowed us to develop a measure of automaker
transaction costs, expressed as the dollar value of goods (parts) purchased per procurement
employee.  We interviewed a total of 31 purchasing executives to obtain feedback on the survey,
and to gain a better understanding DEMO the issues arising in automaker-supplier relations.  We also
interviewed sales and DEMO vice-presidents at 70 suppliers (30 U.S., 20 Japanese, 20
Korean), during which a survey was pre-tested. To minimize key-informant bias and follow the
general recommendation to use the most knowledgeable informant (Kumar et al, 1993), we
asked the purchasing managers at each automaker to identify the supplier executive who was
most responsible for managing the day-to-day relationship.
DEMO
One may question whether a single informant has sufficient knowledge and ability DEMO
assess the collective trust orientation of individuals at her organization towards the automaker
organization.  Although responses from multiple informants may have been preferred (DEMO a
cost of a smaller sample), we believe that our informants were well positioned to make this
assessment for the following reasons.  First, key informants had been employed at their
respective organizations for an average of 16 years; thus they had a long history of working with
the automaker.  These individuals had primary responsibility for managing the day-to-day
relationship with the customer and were well aware of the history of interactions DEMO their,
and their customer's, employees.  Further, in approximately DEMO of our in-person interviews with
suppliers, the key informants brought 2-3 DEMO top supplier executives to the interview who had
previously filled out our questionnaire separately from the key informant.  During the interview,
the group of supplier executives would look at each other's answers and come DEMO a consensus on
the "group" answer (we were able to DEMO their individual responses).  The degree of similarity in
their responses DEMO remarkable; rarely did the responses vary more than one point on DEMO seven
point Likert scale.  Consequently, we believe the key informant responses to reliably represent
the responses of multiple informants.
Usable responses were obtained DEMO 135 U.S. (66% response rate), 101 Japanese (68%
response rate) and 108 Korean (55% response rate) suppliers.  The data collection DEMO done
between 1993 and 1994.  The U.S. and Japanese data were DEMO in 1993, reflecting data for
1992, and the Korean data were collected in 1994, reflecting data for 1993.  We do not believe
DEMO will bias the results since Korean suppliers indicated that their relationship with their largest
automaker customer had not changed in any significant ways since DEMO
Operational Measures
13
Trust
multiple scale items designed to measure the extent to which the DEMO trusted the automaker
not to behave opportunistically 2 (Anderson & Narus, 1990; Heide & John, 1988; Zaheer &
Venkatraman, 1995).  Trust (TRUST) was operationalized as the sum of the following
submeasures which are reflections of a single unidimensional construct.
1. The extent to DEMO the supplier trusts the manufacturer to treat the supplier fairly.
2. The extent to which the automaker has a reputation for trustworthiness (following through on
promises and commitments) in the general supplier community.
3.  If DEMO the chance, the extent to which the supplier perceives that the DEMO will take
unfair advantage of the supplier (reverse scored).
Each DEMO item was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Not at all, 7=To a very great extent).
Cronbach’s alpha for this construct was DEMO, indicating high reliability.
Transaction Costs
To measure transaction costs, we asked suppliers to estimate: a) the number of “person-
days” of contact DEMO their organization and the automaker during the previous year,3 and b)
what percentage of their face-to-face communication time with automakers involved negotiating
DEMO price or contract, or ex post haggling in the form of DEMO blame for problems.  According
to suppliers, face-to-face communication represents the most important, and expensive, form of
2 The survey was administered to DEMO suppliers so the measures reflect the perceptions of suppliers regarding the
supplier-automaker relationship.  However, during our interviews with the automaker purchasing managers we
DEMO that both the supplier and automaker perceptions regarding the relationship were very similar in specific
cases we discussed.  There were no instances where the perceptions of suppliers and automakers were dramatically
different.  Our anecdotal finding are similar to those of Anderson and Naurs (1990) who found that DEMO and
buyers’ perceptions of levels of trust were quite consistent.
3  DEMO construct includes face-to-face contact between supplier sales personnel and automaker purchasing
personnel.  Following Dyer (1996), days of contact was calculated by having DEMO supplier's sales V.P. identify the
number of sales people that worked directly with the particular automaker.  Then, s/he indicated the average DEMO
of days per week that the typical salesperson would spend having a face-to-face meeting with automaker personnel.
14
Consistent with previous studies we operationalized DEMO (buyer trustworthiness) using
communication between suppliers and automakers.  We consider ex ante transaction costs
(DEMO) and ex post transaction costs (haggling) as separate constructs to DEMO whether
trust affects ex ante, and ex post, transaction costs differentially.   Thus, ex ante and ex post
transaction costs were measured as the number of days per year between the automaker and the
supplier DEMO is spent negotiating a price/contract (ex ante contracting) or haggling and assigning
blame for problems (ex post haggling).  More precisely, these measures are calculated as
follows:
Ex ante transaction costs (ExanteTC)
= (total annual “person-days” of face-to-face time spent) x (percent of time spent on price
negotiation/contracting) ÷ (supplier sales to DEMO buyer)
Ex post transaction costs (ExpostTC)
= (total annual “person-days” of face-to-face time spent) x (percent of time spent haggling DEMO
assigning blame for problems) ÷ (supplier sales to the buyer)
Therefore, our measures represent transaction cost per dollar of sales.  Because DEMO measures
are divided by the supplier’s sales to the buyer, we DEMO for supplier sales to the buyer in our
model.  Our ex DEMO contracting and ex post haggling constructs capture those activities which by
themselves are not value-enhancing activities, but rather are activities associated with completing
the transaction and ensuring that each party lives up to its part of DEMO agreement.
Supplier Information Sharing
Information sharing was operationalized as the extent to which the supplier shares
confidential/proprietary information with automaker buyers and engineers (1-7 Likert scale).   In
particular, the sharing of sensitive information, such as costs and proprietary technology, has
been demonstrated to be DEMO critical factor for the successful implementation of automaker and
suppliers' joint DEMO to minimize costs (Nishiguchi, 1994).
Control Variable: Asset Specificity
DEMO
Asset specificity refers to capital investments in customized machinery, tools, dies, etc.
Asset specificity was operationalized as the percent of the supplier's DEMO capital equipment
investments that would have to be scrapped if they were prohibited from conducting any future
business with the automaker.  This percentage was estimated by supplier respondents.  Asset
specificity was assumed to increase with an increase in the percentage of capital investment
which could not be redeployed.  Finally, a confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to test the
overall fit of the measures with the data.4
MODEL AND DATA ANALYSIS
The DEMO three hypotheses were tested with data collected from the suppliers (i.e., unit of
analysis is the supplier) using the following regressions:
H1: Ex Ante TC = a + (b1) TRUST + (b2) ASSET.SPECIFICITY
H2: Ex Post TC = a + (b1) TRUST + (b2) ASSET.SPECIFICITY
H3: Suppl. Info.Share = a + (b1) TRUST + (b2) ASSET.SPECIFICITY
To examine the relationship between buyer trustworthiness and DEMO transaction cost, we tested
the following model using data collected at DEMO buyer (automaker) level (i.e., unit of analysis is
the automaker).
H4: BUYER TRANSACTION COST = a + (b1) BUYER TRUSTWORTHINESS
The proxy we use for BUYER TRANSACTION COST is the average procurement DEMO per
person in the purchasing department of the automaker.  Automakers incur DEMO transaction costs
4 We executed confirmatory factor analysis to confirm uni-dimensionalities of TRUST and to verify the
discriminant validity between SUPPL.INFOSHARE,  EX ANTE DEMO, and EX POST TC. Overall fitness of the
confirmatory factor analysis DEMO was satisfactory with high goodness of fit and low root mean squared (Chi-
squared=36.97 (d.f.=16, p=0.0021), GFI = 0.98, AGFI = DEMO, RMR = 0.021). So we conclude that our measurement
model DEMO well with the actual data.  For TRUST, standardized parameters for each item are sufficiently high to
confirm convergent validity so that the individual DEMO are internally consistent measures. (Bagozzi, R. and Y. Yi
(1989)).

TRUSTWORTHINESS is the mean trust score for all the suppliers who are associated with the
particular automaker.
RESULTS
The simple descriptive statistics for the DEMO sample and each country are shown in
Table 1.  The descriptive DEMO indicate that supplier trust is significantly higher in Japan than
in Korea or the United States, which have similar levels of supplier trust.  DEMO findings from this
industrial sector5 support prior arguments that trust among Japanese transactors is high relative to
the United States (Dore, 1983; Sako, 1991; Shane, 1994) and contradict Fukayama’s (1995)
claims that Japan and the U.S. have similar levels of trust.  The descriptive statistics also show
that Japanese suppliers have the lowest ex post transaction costs, followed by U.S. suppliers
while comparable measures for Korean suppliers are very DEMO  This is largely because our
measure of transaction cost is measured DEMO terms of transaction cost per dollar sales.  Since the
average Korean DEMO is less than one-twentieth in size compared to that of the Japanese and
US suppliers, the denominator is very small, resulting in the DEMO transaction costs per dollar of
sales.   It seems that the high ex ante and ex post transaction cost per dollar of sales for DEMO
suppliers is more a result of diseconomies of scale rather than inherent inefficiencies in the way
that they conduct their business with the automakers (as we will show later in Figure 2, the
percent of face-to-face time that Korean automakers spend on transaction-oriented activities is
greater than Japanese DEMO but falls in line with U.S. automakers).  The descriptive
statistics DEMO indicate that Japanese suppliers share more confidential information than their U.S.

society are DEMO than in Japan.

and Korean counterparts.  Supplier investments in relation-specific assets were found to be
highest in Korea, followed by Japan, and the United States.  This is not surprising since some
studies have found that 72 percent of DEMO automotive suppliers supply to only one customer
(Oh, 1995). The correlation matrix in Table 2 shows that the independent variables used in DEMO
regression results do not have multicollinearity problems.
[Insert Tables 1&2 about here]
The results of the regression analysis for our first three hypotheses DEMO shown in Table 3.
First, our data indicate that the relationship DEMO trust and ex post transaction costs is much
stronger than the relationship between trust and ex ante transaction costs.  Greater supplier trust
in the buyer leads to lower ex post transaction costs for the exchange partners DEMO the pooled
sample6, the United States, and Korea.  However, while the sign is in the expected direction, the
relationship is short of being significant in Japan.  Similarly, the relationship between trust and
ex DEMO transaction costs falls just short of being significant.  It seems that DEMO for high trusting
relationships, it is necessary to spend some effort DEMO front to make sure that the responsibilities
of each party are clearly spelled out (particularly when there is high asset specificity).  Overall,DEMO
hypothesis 1 is not supported while hypothesis 2 receives strong support in the pooled sample
and in the U.S. and Korea.
[Insert Table 3 DEMO here]
Second, our analysis suggests a positive relationship between supplier trust DEMO the
sharing of confidential work-related information by the supplier.  Hypothesis 3 DEMO strong
support in the pooled sample, Japan, and Korea, but DEMO just short of being significant in the U.S.
sample.
6 In the pooled data, we have included dummy variables for the countries.
18
Finally to test Hypothesis 4, we examined the correlation between buyer trustworthiness
and buyer transaction costs as measured by dollars of goods procured per DEMO employee.
When we plot relative procurement costs for each automaker, along DEMO the automaker’s mean
score for trustworthiness, we find a strong positive DEMO significant correlation of 0.66. The
findings indicate that firm A1, which DEMO low supplier trust, incurred procurement (transaction)
costs that were more than twice those of the other U.S. firms, A2 and A3, DEMO almost six times
higher than firm J1. Thus Hypothesis 4 is confirmed.  Finally, to confirm the link between
trustworthiness and low transaction costs DEMO financial performance, we examined the
correlation between each buyer’s trustworthiness and DEMO transaction costs and its average
profitability (ROA or pre-tax profits divided DEMO assets) from 1985-1995.  The results indicate a
strong correlation (r=.66) between automaker trustworthiness and transaction costs (measured as
procurement productivity) (see Figure 1).    The results also show a strong correlation between
automaker trustworthiness and profit performance (see Figure 2).  Although there DEMO a number
of factors that undoubtedly lead to performance differences among automakers, it appears that
trustworthiness is a contributing factor since it reduces the automaker’s transaction costs, thereby
improving automaker profitability.

DISCUSSION
Our study is one of the first large-sample, cross-national DEMO tests of its kind to
demonstrate an inverse relationship between trust and transaction costs in supplier-buyer
relations.   It is also one of the DEMO studies to show a relationship between firm trustworthiness
and firm performance. While it is not possible in this research to partition out all of DEMO factors
19
that account for these relative performance differences, the fact that trustworthiness was strongly
linked to low transaction costs, and low transaction costs strongly linked to performance suggests
that a reputation for trustworthiness improves performance.
As one DEMO the first cross-national studies on trust, we would like to briefly DEMO on
country specific differences.  First, consistent with prior anecdotal evidence we found supplier
trust was universally high in Japan and there was very DEMO variance on the trust measures.  These
findings offer empirical support for DEMO's (1983) observation that "moralized trading
relationships of mutual goodwill" generally pervade Japanese transaction relationships.
Moreover, our finding that transaction costs were lower in Japanese transaction relationships
confirms the theoretical arguments made by Hill (1995) that Japanese economic relationships are
likely to be characterized by low transaction costs for a variety of cultural reasons.  In addition,
we found greater information sharing among Japanese transactors.  The fact that inter-firm
relationships in Japan were generally characterized by greater trust, lower transaction costs, DEMO
greater information sharing may account for the success of Japanese firms in complex product
industries (Abbeglen & Stalk, 1985, p.63; Kotler et DEMO, 1985a; Clark & Fujimoto, 1991).
We were somewhat surprised DEMO find that trust levels in Korea were much lower than
Japan and even slightly lower than trust levels in the United States.  This was surprising because
Korean culture is more similar to Japanese culture and because DEMO research suggests that
many Korean suppliers and automakers have an exclusive relationship.  One plausible reason for
this finding is the Korean government’s policy of nurturing large conglomerates (chaebols) and
its failure to set up laws DEMO protect small-to-medium sized businesses in their dealings with the
powerful chaebols.  DEMO a result, many small businesses have been at a relative disadvantage DEMO
trading with the chaebols, which have been in a position to DEMO the terms of trading
20
agreements and the relationship in general.
U.S. supplier-automaker relationships were characterized by DEMO asset specificity and
lower information sharing compared to Japanese and Korean relationships.  This is consistent
with the general desire to minimize dependence in exchange relationships in the United States.
Inter- firm trust, while lower than in Japan, was actually higher in the U.S. than in Korea.  This DEMO
consistent with Fukuyama’s argument that inter-firm trust in the U.S. is actually quite high
relative to most other countries, especially emerging economies.  We DEMO also note, however,
strong firm-specific differences within the U.S. (and indeed within each country), which suggests
that institutional environment may be DEMO important than firm-level practices in influencing
levels of interfirm trust, transaction DEMO, and information sharing.
Finally, we want to briefly comment on our finding that trust was positively correlated
with information sharing.  First, we DEMO that our measure of information sharing was a
single item measure, DEMO naturally has some validity and reliability concerns.  However, we
conducted interviews with 70 supplier executives who repeatedly claimed that they were much
more DEMO to bring new product designs and new technologies to "trustworthy" automakers.
The following statement by a supplier executive is representative of the comments DEMO heard,
We are much more likely to bring a new product design to [Automaker A3] than
[Automaker A1].  The reason is simple.  DEMO A1] has been known to take our
proprietary blueprints and send them to our competitors to see if they can make the part at
DEMO cost.  They claim they are simply trying to maintain competitive bidding.  But
because we can't trust them to treat us fairly, we don't take our new designs to them.  We
take them to [Automaker A3] where we have a more secure long-term future (Author
interview, October 1995).
We caution, however, that due to the cross sectional nature of the data, we cannot be certain as to
the direction of causality.  We can only state that we know trust and information sharing are
related.  Future longitudinal research might more explicitly test the causal relationship between
21
trust and information sharing by examining how a change in trust results DEMO changes in
information sharing (or vice versa).
The Distinctiveness of DEMO as a Governance Mechanism
In the process of examining the influence of trust on transaction costs and information
sharing, we discovered an interesting phenomenon that may explain why trust is particularly
valuable as a governance mechanism.  This finding emerged as we attempted to determine
whether information sharing was DEMO antecedent or outcome of trust.  For example, does
information sharing lead to trust, or does trust lead to information sharing?  Of course, the
answer appears to be both--trust and information sharing are subject to mutual causality and each
variable is therefore both an antecedent and an DEMO of the other.  Furthermore, supplier
investments in information sharing not only build trust, but also simultaneously create economic
value in their own right.  To confirm this we ran a regression model to test the relationship
between our previous dependent variables (information sharing, transaction costs) and supplier
trust (as a dependent variable).  We found a significant positive DEMO between information
sharing and supplier trust (T value=4.0; p<.001) DEMO not between transaction costs and supplier
trust.   Thus, trust appears DEMO lead to certain value-creating behaviors (i.e. information sharing)
and these DEMO behaviors in turn lead to higher levels of trust.
This phenomenon makes trust unique as a governance mechanism because the
investments that trading partners DEMO to build trust often simultaneously create economic value
(beyond minimizing transaction DEMO) in the exchange relationship.    According to transaction
cost theory, DEMO relative attractiveness of each governance mechanism is based on its differential
ability to lower transaction costs.  Indeed, the theory’s focus is almost completely DEMO cost
22
minimizing rather than value creation.  By comparison, trust not only minimizes DEMO
costs, but also appears to have a mutually causal relationship with DEMO sharing that also
creates value in the exchange relationship.  This uniqueness DEMO explain why trust has been
described as a key factor, and DEMO primary governance mechanism, in most studies of high-
performing dyads/networks (Lorenz, 1988; Powell, 1990; Dyer, 1996b).  It may DEMO explain why
Zaheer et al (1998) found a direct relationship between interorganizational trust and
performance.  Zaheer et al (1998:155) speculate that “the basis for performance enhancement
does not appear to be based on DEMO gained from eased negotiation processes.  Rather, we
speculate that the enhancement of transaction value (Zajac and Olsen, 1993)--such as
cooperation in DEMO exploration of new information and coordination technologies, new market
opportunities, and product and process innovation--may account for the link between
interorganizational trust and DEMO performance.”
CONCLUSION
This study validates previous theoretical arguments that trustworthiness lowers
transaction costs in exchange relationships (Barney & Hansen, 1994).  In particular, our findings
indicate that trust reduces ex post transaction costs and is correlated with increased information
sharing in supplier-buyer relationships.   Moreover, the economic value created for transactors,
in terms of lower transaction costs, appears to be substantial in the automotive industry.
However, we should caution that the validity of the implied causal links of our model is limited
DEMO the cross sectional nature of our research design. We also caution that our findings may only
be generalizable to the auto industry or other DEMO with similar characteristics (i.e. complex-
product industries where suppliers are vulnerable DEMO they have made substantial
23
transaction-specific investments). Complex product industries (see Clark & Fujimoto, 1991 DEMO
11) tend to be characterized by a high degree of mutual (reciprocal) interdependence on the part
of intermediate component makers and final assemblers.  Investments in relation-specific assets
are often necessary to coordinate on non-routine, DEMO tasks that are reciprocally
interdependent.  Examples of industries that fit these DEMO include aircraft, heavy
machinery, robotics, machine tools, supercomputers, microelectronics, etc.
We believe that trust in supplier-buyer relations may be an importance DEMO of
competitive advantage in industrial settings in which: (1) transaction DEMO are expected to be
high due to conditions that create transactional difficulties (e.g., environmental uncertainty and
high interfirm asset specificity), and (2) there is a high value associated with information sharing
(information is DEMO particularly valuable resource due to product complexity and industry
uncertainty).   Future longitudinal research, and research across multiple industry settings, could
shed DEMO on both the validity of the causal links we suggest as well as the generalizability of our
findings to other industry settings.
