ABSTRACT—Investigations of decision making have histor-
ically been undertaken by different disciplines, each using
different techniques and assumptions, and few unifying
efforts have been made. Economists have focused on pre-
cise mathematical models of normative decision making,
psychologists DEMO examined how decisions are actually
made based on cognitive constraints, and DEMO
have concentrated on the detailed operation of neural
systems in simple choices. In recent years, however,
researchers in these separate ﬁelds have joined forces in
an attempt to better specify the foundations of decision
making. DEMO interdisciplinary effort has begun to use
decision theory to guide the search for the neural bases
of reward value and predictability. Concurrently, these
formal models are beginning to incorporate processes such
as social reward and emotion. DEMO combination of these
diverse theoretical approaches and methodologies is
already yielding significant progress in the construction
of more comprehensive decision-making models.
KEYWORDS—decision making; judgment; choice; neuro-
science; economics
The study of decision making has as its goal the understanding of
our fundamental ability to process multiple alternatives DEMO
choose an optimal course of action. A ‘‘good’’ decision is one in
which the best available course of action is chosen in the face DEMO
characteristic uncertainty about the consequences. While some
decisions are straightforward, many DEMO more difﬁcult, either
because the stakes may be high—such as the DEMO of a mate or
a choice among different potentially life-saving medical treat-
ments—or because there are difﬁcult trade-offs to make between
competing options—such as DEMO usually observed between
quality and price of goods or the respective beneﬁts and side
effects of a drug. To complicate matters, often our decisions are
additionally dependent on how others might respond—for

or entering a business negotiation.
DEMO approaches to decision making have all made im-
portant advances, but DEMO has been relatively little integration
of ﬁndings, with researchers often unaware DEMO empirical
discoveries and theoretical approaches from other areas that
nevertheless have immediate relevance for their own investi-
gations. Economic approaches have primarily focused on
DEMO idealized, optimal decision behavior, while in recent
times the emergence of psychological models of decision making
have offered more accurate descriptive accounts by DEMO into
consideration the motivations and constraints of the human
information-processing system. In parallel, neuroscientific
studies have used both single-cell approaches (in which activity
DEMO recorded directly from small groups of neurons) and neuro-
imaging to DEMO lower-level perceptual choices in many
animals, but the micro-level decisions typically DEMO in
such studies are often difﬁcult to reconcile with the decisions
made by humans in everyday life.
However, a new, interdisciplinary ﬁeld, popularly known as
neuroeconomics, is now striving to better understand decision-
making behavior by taking into account the cognitive and neural
constraints on this process, as investigated by psychology and
neuroscience, while also utilizing the mathematical decision
models and multiplayer tasks that have emerged from the ﬁeld
of economics. DEMO using the complementary strengths of different
disciplines, the neuroeconomic approach offers DEMO promising
avenue to examine decision making at different levels of analysis
and, eventually, to arrive at a comprehensive account of how

THE NEURAL BASIS OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS
The ‘‘maximize utility’’ decision rule (DEMO 1) is the core of modern
economic theories of rational behavior DEMO can be summarized in
a succinct equation that represents the evaluation of each course
of action:
Subjective expected utility 5 Sp(xi)u(DEMO), where p represents
the likelihood of a particular alternative, and DEMO represents the
subjective value of that alternative.

Fig. 1. Choice of two gambles DEMO modeled by formal decision theory. The
canonical subjective expected utility (SEU) model proposes that, to make
a choice, each course of action DEMO be evaluated by multiplying a
subjective valuation of its different possible consequences (in this case,
different dollar rewards) by their probabilities of DEMO, and the
gamble with the highest expected utility should be chosen. DEMO gamble
A, in this example, results in a 25% chance to win $100 and a 75% chance
to win $40 (giving a subjective utility value of 55, according to the equation
at the top), whereas gamble B results in a 100% chance of winning $50
(subjective utility value of 50). SEU theory would predict that the decision
DEMO would choose gamble A, since its subjective utility is higher.
The DEMO of the expected utility of a decision alternative—the
result of multiplying the alternative’s subjective value by its
probability, is a crucial one, as DEMO enables the decision maker to
compare and contrast options speciﬁed in different formats. For
example, if one is offered the choice between a new television
and a weekend vacation of equal monetary value, how does one
compare the subjective value of the two options? An indepen-
dent metric for assessing reward value is necessary for a system
that must often DEMO between rewards delivered in different
modalities.
An extensive literature has demonstrated the limits of sub-
jective expected utility theory (SEUT) as a descriptive DEMO of
decision making (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982); but as a
well-speciﬁed mathematical model and at least a good ﬁrst ap-
DEMO of decision making, SEUT has offered a useful
starting point for DEMO investigation of decision making’s neural
basis. Of particular interest to psychologists and neuroscientists
are the probability, value, and utility parameters of the SEUT
DEMO Does the brain make decisions in accordance with the
tenets of SEUT? And, importantly, can brain data be used to
distinguish between competing psychological theories of deci-
sion making and choice, providing evidence above and beyond
that obtainable from behavioral studies?
Value and Probability
Several decades DEMO animal research have focused on the neural
bases of reward and punishment and have identiﬁed a number of
systems that are consistently responsive to DEMO The early focus
of this research was on experienced utility—the reaction to reward
when it is received—but there has since been a gradual shift
DEMO the investigation of decision utility—the expectation of
consequence at the time the decision is being made. For example,
single-cell recording techniques have discovered DEMO in
both dopamine neurons (Tobler, Fiorillo, & Schultz, 2005) DEMO
the frontal cortex (Roesch & Olson, 2004) that scale reliably
DEMO reward magnitude, demonstrating neural signatures of the
encoding and processing of DEMO signals (see Fig. 2).
Findings such as these have informed DEMO neuroimaging
studies of human reward processing. In particular, the striatum,
DEMO area of the brain rich in dopaminergic neurons, reliably
activates in DEMO to earned monetary reward—for example,
in a study in which participants had to gamble on the uncertain

value of a stimulus (Delgado, Locke, Stenger, & Fiez, 2003)—as
well as in response to primary rewards such DEMO the appetitive
value of food (McClure et al., 2004). It seems likely that
the striatal involvement in reward is related to the DEMO
dopamine systems, which play a critical role in value assessment
by DEMO when an error is made in reward prediction, thus
providing a DEMO between theories of reward, theories of learning,
and theories of DEMO
In contrast to the large amount of research on reward, rela-
DEMO little research has been done on judgments of probability.
However, one DEMO neuroimaging study presented subjects with
cues indicating both the likelihood and value of upcoming mone-
tary rewards and showed that activity in the medial DEMO
cortex was related to the subjective probability of obtaining the
reward (DEMO, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, & Glover, 2005).
This suggests DEMO the probability-estimation process may indeed
be separable from that of reward assessment.
Utility
The tantalizing evidence of potentially distinct systems for the
processing of DEMO and probability lends support to the SEUT
model as a useful representation of the neural processes at
play in decision making, as this model also implies separable
processes for reward and probability measures. Studies have
now DEMO to investigate the neural signatures of the expected-
utility signal itself.
Experimental work with animals has revealed brain areas that
appear to directly encode DEMO utility of a stimulus. In one study,
monkeys were placed in front of a computer screen and presented
with two colored squares, each of which represented a different
reward schedule of juice. Electrode recordings demonstrated DEMO
specific neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) were rep-
resenting the utility signal for each target and that the monkey’s
eye-movements on DEMO trial were in accordance with this utility
measure, suggesting a strong DEMO between neural metrics
of utility and decision behavior (Sugrue, Corrado, & Newsome,
2004). Also, these neurons seem sensitive to direct DEMO
of utility, exhibiting combined effects of value and probability as
predicted DEMO the SEUT model (Platt & Glimcher, 1999).
The LIP has been well characterized as a motor-preparation
area, and therefore it seems probable that the utility measure is
computed elsewhere in the brain and shunted DEMO to LIP
for action selection, and studies in both humans and DEMO are
now testing for brain activity that scales directly with decision-
related expected utility. In a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) experiment, Knutson et al. (2005) manipulated
both reward magnitude and probability and found DEMO activation
in striatal reward areas indeed correlates with expected utility,
showing that utility-like signals can be found outside motor-
preparation areas like LIP. DEMO, a particularly interesting
recent study (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006) found that neurons
in the monkey orbitofrontal cortex encode the subjective value of
DEMO 16—Number 3

various decision alternatives (in this case, juice vs. water), inde-
pendent of any action required to select between them, thus
providing evidence for a neural decision-making mechanism not
tied to motor response DEMO again suggestive that the classical
utility approach may be a useful model of how choice alternatives
are represented by neural encoding mechanisms.
What unites DEMO of the aforementioned studies is the use of
classical, formal economic DEMO to examine the underlying
psychological and neural basis of decision making; DEMO results of
these studies suggest that the various decision processes implied
by the classical model (probability estimation, reward and loss
valuation, utility calculation) may indeed be instantiated in the
brain. This is important, as DEMO provides some empirical support for
these formal models of decision making and offers a very useful
framework forexamining the neuralbasis ofdecisions andchoices.
Neural and DEMO Models
The real beneﬁt, and potential transformative advantage, of the
neuroeconomic approach is in the combination of methods: using
the tools of neuroscience to empirically examine the predictions of
formal economic models. To date, research into the neural basis
of utility has largely been a brain-mapping endeavor—that DEMO,
identifying the brain areas that may underlie the computations of
probability, reward, and expected utility, respectively. This en-
terprise represents a not inconsiderable achievement and is a
necessary precursor to work that will use DEMO neural ﬁndings to
build more accurate decision models. However, even at DEMO early
stage, the presence of distinct neural areas that appear to DEMO
spond to the weighting and summing processes underlying the
classical approach can help in distinguishing between alternative
models of decision making. For example, recent research has
proposed that choices are often made via simple rules of DEMO,
suggesting an alternative model to the classical approach
(Brandstatter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006). Therefore, demon-
strating that brain areas do indeed weight and sum probabilities
and values is an important piece of DEMO that the family of
utility-theory models may well be an accurate representation of
how the brain decides between alternatives.
Further, neuroimaging work on reward processing has
demonstrated neural activity that conforms to predictions of
psychological decision DEMO such as prospect theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). One important principle of this
theory is that people evaluate the outcome of decisions DEMO
on a ﬂexible reference point; this would predict that the neural
DEMO responsible for utility assessment should be responsive
to relative gains and losses rather than to absolute levels. Recent
studies using both fMRI (Breiter, DEMO, Kahneman, Dale,
& Shizgal, 2001) and electroencephalogram (Holroyd, Larsen,
& Cohen, 2004) have provided support for this prediction: Both
experiments demonstrated that neural signatures of reward are
determined by the DEMO of the outcome relative to the range of
possible outcomes rather than by the objective value of the
outcome itself.

Decision Neuroscience
NEURAL BASIS OF SOCIAL EXCHANGE
Much of the research described DEMO the previous section, charac-
teristic of a common approach utilized by DEMO and neuro-
science, examines decision tasks with clearly deﬁned probabilities
and DEMO example, choosing between monetary gam-
bles. However, another class of decisions has been investigated by
economics—decisions that, although beguilingly simple, require
complex DEMO about the motivations and strategies employed
by other players. Tasks involving such decisions offer a useful
window into more complex forms of decision making DEMO may
better approximate many of the choices we make in real life.
In a similar fashion to the framework provided by utility theory
for DEMO individual decisions, game theory offers well-
speciﬁed models for the investigation DEMO social exchange.
However, much of the decision behavior actually observed in
DEMO tasks deviates, often quite substantially, from
the predictions of the standard game-theoretic model, suggest-
ing that psychological and neuroscientific approaches may help
our understanding of these decisions and judgments. Recent
research has combined these tasks DEMO neuroimaging in an
effort to gain a more detailed picture of social decision making.
One strand of neuroimaging research has made an important
contribution DEMO showing that social exchange can act directly
on the brain’s reward system, providing further evidence for
a ﬂexible reward system and a common metric that can be used
to compare across reward types. For example, Rilling, Sanfey,
Aronson, Nystrom, and Cohen (2004) have shown that the
striatum, which (as described previously) is active for basic
rewards, appears to also encode more abstract rewards such as
the positive feeling garnered by mutual cooperation in a social
decision-making task known as the DEMO Dilemma.
Similarly, de Quervain et al. (2004) used positron-emission
tomography DEMO to examine punishment of transgressing
social norms in an economic-exchange game and identiﬁed
reward-related brain areas associated with punishment of
nonreciprocators. Other ﬁndings have DEMO reported in a rela-
tion to exhibitions of trust in an investment game (King-Casas
et al., 2005): A neural signal corresponding to DEMO ‘‘intention to
increase trust’’ was isolated, showing that abstract rewards like
DEMO are encoded in reward-related areas.
In a related vein, a neuroimaging DEMO (Sanfey et al., 2003)
examined behavior in a classic economic task, the Ultimatum
Game, in which two players share a sum DEMO money between them.
This game demonstrates that people will often sacriﬁce monetary
reward in order to punish a player who treats them unfairly. The
DEMO found a brain area—the anterior insula—that
exhibited greater activation as the unfairness of the offer
increased. Further, this area was more active when playing with
another human than with a computer partner, and, importantly,
DEMO activation of this area in combination with others reliably
predicted the player’s decision whether to cooperate or not. The
anterior insula is typically activated DEMO people are confronted
with aversive physical stimuli, suggesting that more basic
DEMO areas can be recruited for higher-level decisions.
Additionally, many of the DEMO studies of social exchange
have demonstrated the large inﬂuence of automatic processes,
such as emotions, on these types of decisions. In contrast to the
standard economic model, which presupposes the operation of a
single rational information processor, current research is exam-
ining how the twin systems of automatic and controlled processing
may cooperate—and sometimes compete—in decision making.
The degree DEMO which these subsystems are biologically distinct is
an area of hot debate, but data from neuroimaging studies can not
only provide a window onto the existence and location of different
subsystems but, in addition, potentially DEMO quantitative
estimation of the degree of involvement of these systems to better
inform utility parameters in formal models.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The preceding DEMO review some general ways in which
decision neuroscience can make important contributions to the
understanding of decision making. These ﬁndings provide some
traction for DEMO physical mechanisms responsible for
individual and social decision making and offer the promise of
identifying and precisely characterizing both the mechanisms
and the factors DEMO inﬂuence how they engage and interact.
As with any new approach, DEMO are challenges to address.
The component disciplines operate at different levels of analysis
and have different theoretical assumptions. More practically,
there are important DEMO in methodology, in particular
with regard to the use of deception DEMO monetary incentives.
However, at worst, data generated by such a cross-disciplinary
approach will be valuable in providing additional constraints,
based on our DEMO knowledge of neural functioning, on any
theory that seeks to accurately DEMO decision making; and at
best, such data will allow discrimination and modeling of pro-
cesses that may be difﬁcult to separate at the DEMO level.
The neuroeconomic approach will continue to depend on the
diverse strengths of its contributing disciplines and the willing-
ness of its proponents to DEMO collaborating and communi-
cating. But given the energetic research and promising results
currently emerging, it seems likely that the ﬁeld has real potential
for making important contributions to our understanding of
decision making, above and beyond what will continue to be
learned from work within each discipline independently.
