MANAGEMENT INNOVATION
Abstract
We investigate the underexplored phenomenon of management innovation - DEMO
implementation of a new practice, process or structure that significantly departs DEMO
generally accepted management practice and furthers organizational goals.  After
defining the DEMO around the concept, we develop a framework for the process
of DEMO innovation, focusing on three phases of activity (motivation,
invention, DEMO), two sets of actors (internal and external change agents)
DEMO their associated organizational context.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past half-century, scholars around the world have produced a vast body of
academic research and writing on the topic of innovation. DEMO has been
focused on issues as diverse as the nature of human creativity, the management of
industrial research and development, the diffusion of DEMO, competitive
responses to “disruptive” innovation, the linkage between innovation and national
competitiveness, the role of government policy in promoting (or frustrating)
DEMO, and the distribution of economic rents between innovators and exploiters.
Along DEMO way, a large number of taxonomies have been developed with the DEMO of
distinguishing among various types of innovation: incremental versus radical, product
versus process, technology-driven versus market-driven, and so on (Christensen
1997; DEMO & Clark 1990; Tushman & Anderson 1986; Utterback 1994).
Yet as they have reconnoitered the innovation landscape, researchers have paid
relatively scant attention to the dynamics of management innovation, defined as the
implementation of a new management practice, process or structure that represents
a significant and novel departure from generally accepted or standard management
practices, and is intended to further organizational goals (Abrahamson 1991; Alänge,
Jacobsson, & Jarnehammar 1998; Damanpour & Evan 1984; Gruber & Niles 1972;
Kimberly DEMO; Teece 1980). Indeed, while the search term ‘technological
innovation’ generates some 12,646 peer-reviewed articles in the Business Source
Premier database, ‘management innovation’ only accounts for 114 (on 12-12-2005).
We therefore know little about how management practices, processes and structures
evolve and, perhaps, advance over time.  While many of the landmarks of
4
management innovation are familiar to every business scholar (for example, GE’s
DEMO of the modern research lab, Du Pont’s invention of capital budgeting
DEMO, GM’s adoption of the M-form organization structure and Toyota’s success in
DEMO the problem-solving skills of first-level employees), there exists no
generalized model of management innovation as a dynamic process.
Management innovation has, of course, received some research attention.  Business
historians have produced histories of management DEMO and have dug deeply into
specific cases of management innovation (e.g. DEMO 1962; Fligstein 1985; Pezet
1997). Other researchers have studied the diffusion of management ideas across
space and time (e.g. Abrahamson & Rosenkopf 1993; Burns & Wholey 1993;
Damanpour 1987; Guler, Guillén, & MacPherson 2002; Teece 1980; Zmud 1982) or
surveyed the ever-shifting DEMO of contemporary “management fashion”
(Abrahamson 1991; 1996; Strang & Macy, 2001; Zbaracki 1998). But useful as these
studies are, none DEMO them really tackles the origins of management innovation in a
systematic or comparative fashion.
There is, in other words, a significant gap in DEMO knowledge of how management
practices, processes and structures actually get invented DEMO improved (or ultimately
abandoned). A comprehensive understanding of the origins DEMO successful
management innovation would seem to be a prerequisite for improving the
productivity and impact of management scholarship. By this logic, it is not enough to
track the life cycles of new management ideas and practices, one must understand
their conception and early gestation.
5
Equally perplexing is the apparent lack of attention given to the management DEMO
management innovation within large companies. Former CEO of Analog Devices,
Ray Stata (1989: 63) argued that “at Analog Devices, and many DEMO U.S.
companies, product and process innovation are not the main bottleneck DEMO progress.
The bottleneck is management innovation. We have to ask ourselves, DEMO a company
and a nation, are we investing enough in management DEMO?” While
companies have built elaborate mechanisms for generating and exploiting new
scientific discoveries, new product breakthroughs and improvements in operating
efficiency, there DEMO little evidence they have approached management innovation with
anything like the same diligence and creativity. Companies do, of course, experiment
with new management DEMO  They tweak compensation systems, rearrange
organizational units, alter capital budgeting DEMO, implement new human resource
policies and occasionally renovate their executive development DEMO
Nevertheless, we suspect it is a rare CEO who would claim DEMO his or her company
has an explicit process for management innovation, DEMO who could point out who
monitors or is responsible for management innovation.
There is a third justification for better understanding management innovation, namely
that advances in management practice contribute to long-term improvements in
macroeconomic performance (Baumol 2002; Schumpeter 1947; Teece 1980). This
assertion seems to have DEMO almost universally accepted by business historians
who typically describe a new way of organizing or a new management method in
terms of its contribution DEMO increased factor productivity and/or heightened
competitive advantage (Chandler 1962).
DEMO
Among organization theory scholars, however, the link between management
innovation and DEMO macroeconomic performance is less immediately accepted.
Abrahamson (1996: 257) has DEMO that management innovation is an element of
the “management fashion” process by which “management fashion setters
continuously redefine both theirs and fashion followers’ collective DEMO about which
management techniques lead to rational management progress”.  A stronger DEMO of
this argument has been presented by Barley and Kunda (1992: 365), who suggest
that managerial thought should be characterized by “a DEMO wrestling with
counterconceptual themes” rather than progression, and Staw and Epstein (2000:
523), who similarly argued that “there is not a DEMO progression of ideas based on
systematic knowledge of people and organizations”. These authors build on
neoinstitutional theory, and view the adoption of new management practices,
processes and structures as driven primarily by socio-psychological pressures to
DEMO, rather than by the desire for economic progress per se.  Our approach
does not in any way dispute the cyclical process by which DEMO management
techniques fall in and out of favor. However, our belief DEMO that there is also an
underlying process whereby highly effective management innovations (such as
Toyota’s Production Method, capital budgeting techniques, the M-Form structure,
and human resource management) become deeply institutionalized across industry
sectors, DEMO management innovations that are less important or less effective in
their application are selected out.  Thus, even though there may or may not DEMO an
immediate link between later adoptions of a management technique and firm
performance (Staw & Epstein, 2000), the benefits at a societal DEMO from
improvements in the practice of management are likely to be substantial1.
7
The purpose of this paper is to outline some first steps en DEMO to the bold goals we
wish to achieve. We focus our discussion on two specific questions.  First, what is
management innovation?  How DEMO we define management innovation in a useful
and rigorous way, and DEMO can we distinguish management innovation from related
concepts, such as technological DEMO, process innovation and management
fashion? Second, what is the process DEMO which management innovation comes
about? What does the literature tell us DEMO the typical sequence of actions taken
by individuals inside and outside the organization that result in the occurrence of
management innovation? And to what extent can we induce a general set of
propositions about the process DEMO the causal mechanisms by which management
innovation takes place? The paper DEMO with some thoughts about the future
research agenda that might be pursued to further advance our understanding of
management innovation.
Definitions
WHAT IS MANAGEMENT DEMO?
A survey of the literature suggests there are several related terms in use -
managerial innovation (Kimberly & Evanisko 1981), administrative innovation
(Damanpour & Evan 1984), organizational innovation (Alänge et al. 1998; Clark
2003; Damanpour & Evan 1984; Kimberly & Evanisko 1981) and management
innovation (Abrahamson 1991; Kossek 1987; Stata 1989). Confusingly,
organizational innovation is sometimes used to imply any type of innovation
generated DEMO organizations, including for instance new products. Administrative
innovation typically refers to DEMO narrow range of innovations around organizational
8
structure and human resource policies, and does not include innovations in for
instance marketing or operations management. Our preference therefore is to use
the DEMO term, management innovation, which we define as the invention and
implementation of a new management practice, process or structure that represents
a significant and novel departure from generally accepted or standard management
practices, and intended to further organizational goals.  This definition has four
critical elements.
First, DEMO innovation involves both invention and implementation. In the
field of technology management, it is customary to distinguish between invention (the
initial idea or DEMO breakthrough) and innovation (the development of a viable
product or process from the initial idea). Similarly, the invention of a new
management practice process or structure by an academic or practicing manager is
conceptually DEMO from the implementation of that invention in a business
setting (Davenport & Prusak 2003; Gruber & Niles 1972). For example, Discounted
Cash Flow (DCF) was invented in the nineteenth century but was only DEMO in AT&T
in the early 1920s and not validated in France until well into the 1950s (Pezet 1997).
Our research deliberately spans both activities, because it is only by understanding
how the two are brought together that we can gain a full understanding of the
process DEMO management innovation.
Second, management innovation has to be new to the DEMO organization. New
here does not necessarily mean new to the world.  DEMO, it means the innovation in
question involves a significant level of DEMO and risk on the part of
adopting organization.  If one considers DEMO spectrum of approaches to the
9
implementation of management practices, processes and structures, on the left side
DEMO firm might buy an “off the shelf” practice from a consultancy (DEMO a stock-option
plan for employees), and on the right side the firm could hypothetically come up with
a completely novel innovation of its DEMO (e.g. the Danish hearing aid company
Oticon’s “spaghetti organization”, Foss 2003; Lovas & Ghoshal 1999). New simply
refers to those innovations towards the right side of the spectrum where the level of
adaptation to DEMO specific context of the innovating organization is high, and where
there DEMO a considerable level of uncertainty regarding the outcome of the innovation.
Third, the focus of management innovation is on the creation of a new management
practice, process or structure (Alänge et al. 1998). Management DEMO refers to
such things as pay-for-performance or brand management; process refers DEMO such
things as Business Process Reengineering or capital budgeting; structure refers DEMO
such things as the M-Form and the Matrix organization2.
It should be acknowledged that by incorporating practice, process and structure
within our definition we end up with a very broad phenomenon. There are two
reasons why DEMO take this approach.  First, the distinctions between practice, process
and DEMO are not clean, either conceptually or empirically, so it would be difficult
to define management innovation in a way that excluded one or DEMO of them.
Second, our analysis suggests that there are also important DEMO across the
different forms of management innovation, especially with regard to DEMO ways in
which new practices, processes and structures are generated.  In other words, given
the purpose of this paper, we find it DEMO to bracket together management
10
innovations across these three areas, “as if they constitute a homogeneous entity”
(Alänge et al. 1998: 7).
Fourth, management innovation is intended to further organizational goals. This is an
obvious point, but it is important as a means of highlighting the reason why firms are
prepared DEMO engage in the somewhat risky process of management innovation in the
first place.  It also hints at two related issues. First, not all DEMO innovations
are ultimately successful.  For example, Volvo experimented for many years with
cellular manufacturing, with the intention of delivering significant benefits, but DEMO
innovation was ultimately discontinued (Berggren 1994). Second, organizational
goals includes both traditional metrics of business performance (efficiency,
effectiveness, competitive advantage) as well as internal metrics, such as improved
quality of working life for employees, lower turnover, and improved service and
product quality.  It also acknowledges the important role of external legitimacy as a
factor in DEMO decision to adopt new management techniques (Staw & Epstein 2000).
DEMO Research
Having established the boundaries around the term management innovation, it DEMO
useful to briefly summarize prior research on the subject. Broadly speaking, DEMO
has taken place in three areas.  The first is the process DEMO diffusion of a particular
management innovation across a population of firms.  DEMO are too many studies in
this genre to provide a definitive list, but examples include the diffusion of the M-form
(Fligstein 1985; Palmer, Friedland , Jennings, & Powers 1987), the matrix structure
(Burns & Wholey 1993), ISO 9000 (Guler et al. 2002), total quality management
11
(Westphal, Gulati, & Shortell 1997; Zbaracki 1998), and quality DEMO (Abrahamson
& Fairchild 1999). Research has also looked specifically at DEMO process of diffusion of
certain management innovations across country boundaries (Guler DEMO al. 2002;
Kogut & Parkinson 1993; Lillrank 1995). The DEMO of this research is primarily on
understanding patterns of diffusion and the forces shaping those patterns
(Abrahamson & Fairchild 1999).
The second major area of prior research – and the one closest to our interest DEMO –
has examined the conditions under which management innovation takes place.
Some of this work is historical in its orientation, in that it attempts to discern the
social and economic conditions under which a particular management DEMO
took root (Abrahamson 1997; Chandler 1962; Pezet 1997; Stjernberg & Philips
1993). Other studies address contemporary examples of management innovation,
DEMO typically with a focus on single case studies rather than the broader issues
emerging from those studies (Berggren 1994; McCabe 2000; Tichy & Sandstrom
1974; Whitsett & Yorks 1983). There is also some work on administrative innovations
that attempts to predict the presence of these innovations DEMO libraries and hospitals
(Damanpour 1987; Kimberly & Evanisko 1981). Various individual, firm level and
environmental predictors were found to have a bearing on administrative innovation,
though cross-organizational differences account for the bulk of DEMO variation in
implementation of administrative innovations (Kimberly & Evanisko 1981).
DEMO, there is a small body of literature concerned with the link DEMO
management innovation and technological innovation. This research has shown that
management innovation often occurs in conjunction with technical innovation, but
12
that the process of invention and uptake of management innovations is typically
DEMO (Boer & During 2001; Damanpour & Evan 1984; Georgantzas & DEMO
1993; Kimberly & Evanisko 1981), which could be related to DEMO between
these types of innovations.
This brief review suggests a couple of important observations. One is the relative
lack of research on management innovation DEMO se, and in particular the lack of
research on how it DEMO in organizational settings. The other is the lack of an
overarching framework to help make sense of the process of management
innovation, or the broader evolution in management innovations over time. In the
remainder of this DEMO we begin to address these gaps in prior research.
Management Innovation versus related constructs
There is an enormous body of literature on technological innovation, so a useful
starting point for this enquiry would be to expect DEMO process of management
innovation to follow that of technological innovation, in DEMO both involve the
introduction and implementation of new ideas to an existing organization.  However,
to the extent that there are significant differences in the nature of management and
technological innovations, we could also expect to see differences in the process
whereby they are created, implemented and managed.
What is the difference between management innovation and technological
innovation? We have already established that management innovation is a very
broad concept, and of course technological innovation is equally wide-ranging. Our
13
working definition of technological innovation is taken from the OECD’s Oslo Manual:DEMO
the implementation/commercialization of a product with improved performance
characteristics such as to deliver objectively new or improved services to the
consumer (OECD, DEMO: 9)3.
We argue the fundamental difference between a management innovation DEMO a
technological innovation lies in the nature of the asset that is being created. Both
typically result in the generation of “knowledge assets” that DEMO valuable because of
the intellectual capital used to develop them, but DEMO also vary in several important
ways.  If we apply Winter’s (1987) well-known dimensions of knowledge assets, we
would expect management innovations to DEMO less easy to articulate and codify, and
more likely to be DEMO than technological innovations.  Management
innovations, in other words, are typically DEMO in their nature and very hard to
separate from the system in which they were created (Alänge et al. 1998; Teece,
1980)DEMO
This basic distinction has several important consequences. It suggests, first, that the
justification for pursuing management innovation inside an organization is much
harder DEMO make than the justification for technological innovation because its product
is intangible. The process of implementation is consequently more difficult to
manage, and is likely to encounter more resistance because of the lack of
understanding of DEMO putative benefits. Second, the outcomes for the adopting
organization, in terms of performance improvements, are likely to be hard to prove
because management innovation is system-dependent: it is typically interwoven with
other processes or practices in the organization, and as such its impact on
14
performance is difficult to disentangle and measure directly.  Third, the ability DEMO the
adopting organization to appropriate value from a management innovation is not
clear.  It has been argued that the intangible and system-dependent nature of
management innovations makes them hard to patent, which in turn is likely to reduce
firms’ incentive to pursue them (Alänge et al. 1998; DEMO 1980).  At the same time,
however, these same features increase the level of causal ambiguity and complexity
in the way management DEMO affect firm performance (Lippman & Rumelt
1982; Reed & DeFillipi 1990), which may explain why some management
innovations, such as Toyota’s introduction of total quality management, have
resulted in long-term competitive advantage for the innovating firm.
Taken as a whole, these points suggest two broad propositions about the differences
we might expect to see in the process of DEMO innovation, in comparison to
the more widely-studied process of technological innovation.  The first is that
impactful management innovation is likely to occur relatively DEMO, and when
it does occur it is likely to be seen DEMO organizations with high levels of tolerance for
and experience with innovation. Of course any form of innovation relies on tolerance
of uncertainty and openness DEMO new ideas, but the differences discussed above
mean that such qualities DEMO be in even greater demand than in organizations that
engage in technological innovation.
Second, management innovation is likely to involve a higher emphasis on
independent validation, particularly from external sources, than other forms of
innovation DEMO as technological innovation (which
are usually prone to
standardization or other DEMO of objectification of their benefits).  In the absence of
15
objective data on the potential value of a management innovation, external sources
can be a useful source of insight and legitimacy for overcoming internal DEMO
The relationship between external sources and the firms pursuing management
innovations is complex, as we describe below.  But the broad expectation here is
DEMO they will play a more important role in the process of management innovation
than would be seen in the corresponding process for technological innovation. DEMO the
second half of the paper we translate these broad arguments into testable and
specific propositions.
It is also useful to clarify the distinction DEMO management innovation and two
related concepts – process innovation and management fashion.  Process
innovation refers to the development of new or improved ways of managing the
production or delivery of goods/services (OECD, 1997).  It is typically focused on the
primary value-adding activities of the firm (i.e. those directly involved in resource
transformation). Management innovation refers more DEMO to the supporting
activities that surround the resource transformation process, and DEMO add value to
it. Some innovations, particularly those stemming from operations DEMO and
information systems, are really hybrids between management innovation and
process DEMO Enterprise Resource Planning is a good example of a hybrid: it
DEMO the production process directly, but it also changes the way resource
DEMO is managed. Likewise, Total Quality Management affects the supply
and transformation DEMO inputs, but it also has enormous implications for the way the
DEMO is organized. There is therefore a continuum between process innovation and
management innovation, with certain innovations portraying characteristics of both.
16
A management fashion is a relatively transitory collective belief that a management
DEMO leads to rational management progress (Abrahamson 1996: 257).
Management fashion is related to management innovation in the following way.
Certain management innovations DEMO management fashions if they get taken up
by a significant number of “management fashion users”; other management
innovations either die out or remain in use in a relatively small number of firms.
However, not all management fashions arise out of management innovations per se.
For example, Abrahamson (DEMO) discusses specific analytical tools (such as five-
forces analysis or critical path analysis), as well as broader management rhetorics
(such as “learning organization”) as being susceptible to management fashion, yet
neither fits within DEMO more specific definition of management innovation.
THE PROCESS OF MANAGEMENT INNOVATION
The second part of this paper addresses the question: what is the process through
which management innovations generally emerge?  As the review above indicated,DEMO
research has tended to shy away from this question, and instead DEMO focused on
either the patterns and processes of innovation diffusion or the emergence and
idiosyncrasies of individual management innovations. Our purpose here is to DEMO a
first attempt at conceptualizing the early-stage development of management
innovation, DEMO a view to encouraging further conceptual and empirical work in this
area.
The approach in this section is to use the existing body of DEMO to put forward a
framework and a set of testable propositions around the drivers of the process. As
17
already mentioned, this literature is fragmented and fairly small.  In addition, it
focuses on large and well-known cases, such as the M-Form organization, brand
management, and the balanced scorecard, and it favors successful innovations.
These limitations to the historical record are hardly surprising, and the focus on large
and successful instances also characterizes the literature on technological
innovations, but they should be borne in mind as the framework and propositions DEMO
developed.
The framework, illustrated in figure 1, has two dimensions.  DEMO horizontal dimension
consists of three phases of the innovation process: Motivation DEMO concerned with the
facilitating factors and precipitating circumstances that lead individuals in an
organization to consider developing their own management innovation; Invention is
an initial act of experimentation, out of which a new management practice, DEMO
or structure emerges in its embryonic form; and Implementation is the DEMO of
establishing the value of the new management innovation in vivo (DEMO in a real
commercial setting).  Implementation is often followed by DEMO process of diffusion to
other contexts, but that process is beyond DEMO scope of this paper.
This three-phase model is consistent with many of the prior studies of the innovation
process in the literature (Burgelman 1983; Maidique 1980; Marquis 1969; Schön
1971).  While the process DEMO represented here in a purely sequential way, we
recognise that the DEMO is likely to be more complex, with overlapping phases (Imai,
Nonaka, & Takeuchi 1985), iterations between phases (Galbraith 1982), DEMO even
phases occurring out of sequence (Van de Ven & Garud DEMO).   However, for the
18
purposes of analytical expediency we present the phases in their traditional
sequence.
DEMO
Insert Figure 1 about here
------------------------------
Cutting across these phases in the vertical dimension are the actions taken by key
individuals inside and outside DEMO innovating company, and the contextual conditions
that shape the actions of DEMO key individuals.  The first key group of individuals are
labelled internal DEMO agents.  These individuals are the employees of the
innovating company who DEMO proactive in motivating interest in, experimenting with,
and validating the DEMO management innovation in question.  In the innovation
literature they are variously DEMO to as intrapreneurs (Pinchott 1986), product
champions (Howell & Higgins 1990), tempered radicals (Meyerson & Scully 1995)
and institutional entrepreneurs (DiMaggio 1988).  These individuals act on the basis
of their DEMO about the potential value of a new idea for their organisation.  DEMO
their action in turn is shaped by the internal organisation context in which they work
(Bower 1972; Burgelman 1983).
The other key DEMO of individuals are labelled external change agents. These
individuals are independent consultants, academics, and gurus who are proactive in
motivating interest in, influencing the development of, and legitimizing the
effectiveness of new management practices, DEMO and structures.  As
suggested earlier, we expect external change agents to play a major role in the
process of management innovation because of DEMO intangible and system-dependent
nature of most management innovations.  However, unlike their internal
19
counterparts, the role of external change agents in the innovation process is not well
understood.
What roles would we expect external change agents to DEMO in the introduction of
management innovations? One established line of thinking DEMO that external change
agents are the suppliers of new management fashions (DEMO 1991; 1996;
Benders & van Veen 2001; Carson, Lanier, Carson, & Guidry 2000; Zbaracki, 1998).
Abrahamson (1996) for example, describes how gurus, consultants, and academics
pick up on experimental practices in companies, make sense of their potential value,
and then provide visibility and legitimacy to a small number of those practices.
While DEMO recognise that this is an important and prevalent role, our reading DEMO the
literature suggests that external change agents also play other roles.  DEMO example,
they can provide the original idea that sparks off the experiment inside the company,
they can act as process facilitators or DEMO researchers alongside the internal team
in the experimentation phase, and they DEMO act as sounding boards or mentors to the
internal team during the implementation phase (Chandler, 1962; Kaplan, 1998;
Pezet, 1997; DEMO & Philips, 1993; Whitsett & Yorks, 1983).
External change DEMO, in other words, have a broader set of roles than just acting
as “fashion setters” who pick up on and popularize existing practices.  As we will
argue below in greater detail, these individuals have potentially important roles to
play in each phase of the process.  Some of these roles are focused more on the
generation of management innovation per DEMO, while others favour the creation of
management fashion.  The benefit of our framework, we believe, is not only that it
20
describes the process of management innovation more clearly than before, but also
that it helps to clarify how the generative mechanisms differ between management
DEMO and management fashions.
In sum, our framework consists of three phases.  Each phase consists of a set of
actions taken by internal change DEMO, an internal organization context in which
those individuals chose to act, and a set of actions taken by external change agents.
Before proceeding, two additional points are worth highlighting.  First, our emphasis
is on DEMO factors that cause management innovation to occur, and not necessarily on
DEMO factors that cause management innovation to be successful.  While the
process DEMO the outcome are clearly related, they are conceptually separable so our
DEMO here is on the former though the latter is of obvious interest too.   Second,
some of our propositions are highly specific to DEMO innovation, while others
would apply equally to other forms of innovation.  This simply reflects our
understanding of the differences and similarities noted above.  Rather than focusing
only on those aspects of the process that are DEMO distinctive, we have opted to
develop a more comprehensive framework which DEMO including certain
propositions that are already well-established in parallel bodies of literature.
Motivation Phase
The motivation phase refers to the preconditions and facilitating factors DEMO lead
individuals in a company to be motivated to experiment with a new management
innovation.   The question, in other words, is under DEMO conditions, or in what
circumstances, do executives deem existing management practices, processes or
21
structures to be inadequate to their needs?  The answer to this DEMO is far from
straightforward, because it is necessary not only to DEMO the conditions under
which executives search for new management innovations, but DEMO to specify the
circumstances in which they choose not to adopt one of the existing solutions that
can be obtained in pre-fabricated form from DEMO so-called “management fashion
setting community” (Abrahamson, 1996).  For management DEMO to occur, in
other words, the market for management fashions has to fail.
Our argument is as follows. Established theory suggests that the DEMO for new
management ideas and practices is driven by a perceived shortfall between the
organization’s current and potential performance (Barley & Kunda 1992; DEMO &
March 1963). Individual managers in an organization identify a DEMO problem vis-
à-vis their existing management practices, processes or structures. They DEMO in
a problemistic search process that begins with existing and proximate contacts. And
once a satisfactory solution has been found, the search is terminated and the
solution is implemented.  In cases where the individuals choose to look outside their
own organization for a solution, they are confronted with a management fashion-
setting community, which both shapes the belief systems of users as to what is
rational, and peddle their particular solutions to users’ problems.
When faced with so many choices, how do executives choose which one to adopt?
Constrained by both the pressure to conform DEMO the norms of rationality of the
organization’s institutional field, and by DEMO costs of evaluating multiple competing
offers, executives will typically choose to DEMO the solution which appears to be the
22
most progressive and legitimate (Abrahamson 1996).  This, of course, DEMO the process
through which management innovations become management fashions.
But sometimes executives choose to experiment with developing their own novel
management innovation. Or in DEMO language of institutional theory, they choose to
deviate from the norms DEMO rationality of their industry, and to potentially “appear
irrational and retrogressive” (Abrahamson 1996: 263).  Under certain circumstances,
then, the pressure to experiment with a new management innovation overcomes the
pressure to conform DEMO externally-arbitrated management norms, and these are the
circumstances that we seek DEMO identify.
Internal conditions. We argue there are two primary situations in which
managers may be motivated to look beyond the offerings of the management
DEMO community. One is where the problem facing the organization is
genuinely new, or is framed in such a way that the solutions proposed by fashion
setters are unacceptable. Under such conditions, the organization would have no
choice but to develop its own solution.  For example, Chandler (1962) argued that
one of the stimuli for Alfred P. Sloan’s development of the M-form organization was
the unprecedented complexity of General Motors caused by DEMO merger of five
separate auto companies.  Another example is the Danish DEMO manufacturer
Oticon. The CEO at the time, Lars Kolind, was able to convince his employees and
board of directors that Oticon faced a DEMO threat to its viability from large
competitors such as Philips and Siemens, and this was sufficient for him to push
through a radical innovation that he labeled the “spaghetti organization” (Foss, 2003;
Lovas & DEMO, 2001).   In both cases, the nature of the challenge or opportunity
23
facing the company was framed as highly unusual as a means of DEMO
stakeholders that a truly innovative solution would be required.  Stated more
DEMO:
Proposition 1a. The more successful internal change agents are in framing the
problems facing the organization as novel, the greater the potential for the
organization to engage in management innovation.
The second situation is where DEMO problem may or may not be new, but the
innovating organization DEMO a sufficiently methodical approach to evaluating
options and making decisions that existing solutions will often fail to meet
acceptance. As discussed earlier, one of the problems with implementing new
management practices, processes or structures is that their effect on overall
performance is extremely hard to measure. In comparison DEMO a product or technology
innovation for example, a management innovation will DEMO affect performance in
an indirect way, and over a long time-frame. DEMO a result, criteria based around
legitimacy and the appearance of progress DEMO likely to be as heavily weighted as
criteria that focus narrowly on the technical or economic value of the innovation.
However, while it is clearly difficult to evaluate a potential management innovation
against alternative approaches, and to assess its contribution to economic
performance, it is not impossible. Some organizations take a more methodical
approach to making complex and ambiguous investments DEMO this type than others,
and our argument here is simply that those organizations that take the evaluation
process seriously are more likely to DEMO in management innovation.  In other
24
words, rather than accept an “off the shelf” solution to a problem, as put forward by a
consulting company or as used by a competitor, the organization will actively
consider the option of implementing its own solution to that problem.  And the more
explicit and thorough the company’s ongoing review of its management methods, the
greater the likelihood that the end result will sometimes be an internally-generated
management innovation. For example Activity DEMO Costing did not address a
fundamentally new problem but did provide a demonstrably more effective means of
analyzing the cost of products that were DEMO dependent on indirect costs (Kaplan
1998).
Proposition 1b. The more DEMO and methodical the decision-making
processes in the organization, the greater the DEMO for the organization to
engage in management innovation.
External conditions What is the role played by external change agents in
motivating the search for DEMO management innovations? The answer is not
straightforward, because these external agents can potentially be the source of
genuinely new ideas, but they can also be an obstacle to management innovation if
their focus is on DEMO tried-and-tested practices.
To shed light on this issue, it is necessary DEMO be clear on the extent to which a
particular management idea has already been instantiated in specific techniques or
practices.  That is, the DEMO for management methods encompasses management
ideas or principles that are more or less developed, and that lie along a spectrum
stretching from untested concepts to highly evolved techniques. For example
25
“Theory Y” (McGregor, 1960) was originally an untested concept, but DEMO subsequently
led to the development of a set of specific techniques around job enlargement,
performance-related pay, and employee assessment.  A management idea DEMO
inherently fungible – it can readily be adapted to any number of different contexts. A
management technique, in contrast, is relatively clearly defined DEMO will often work
only in a certain organizational context.   The offerings of external agents fall
anywhere on the spectrum from an untested concept DEMO a detailed operational
technique.  Academics and gurus typically operate on the DEMO end of the spectrum,
and most consultants operate on the technique end.
What is the best combination of external ideas and techniques for DEMO
innovation to occur?  Our expectation is that exposure to new management ideas will
provide a relatively fertile environment for management innovation because the
DEMO of those ideas provides managers with considerable freedom to apply
them in novel ways. In contrast, most management techniques are developed for
use in a specific context, as well as clearly-understood expectations about how they
will be applied. They therefore offer little scope for experimentation on the part DEMO
those implementing them.  The fact that very few of the examples DEMO historical
management innovations we have mentioned thus far emerged from the work of
consultants and the techniques they use is perhaps a case in DEMO
Proposition 2a. The greater the exposure of employees in the organization to
novel management ideas from external change agents (rather than well-proven
management techniques), the greater the potential for the organization to
engage in management DEMO
26
Having said this, it is worth noting that managers will often lack the training needed
to make sense of the theoretical underpinnings of a DEMO novel management
idea, nor may they have the time and skills DEMO to independently transform a
broad management concept into productive management techniques. Thus, when
exploring the market for management methods, executives have a substantial
DEMO to adopt a set of already well-proven techniques. Recognizing this
preference, DEMO agents are likely to put an emphasis on selling the “tried and
true” as opposed to the “new and untested”. Moreover, if the external agent is a large
consultancy, the quest for internal economies (i.e. DEMO, repeatability etc.)
may create a strong preference to sell off-the-shelf DEMO with as little
adaptation as possible. Thus for reasons of both demand and supply, the market for
management methods is likely to be long on management techniques and relatively
short on fresh management ideas.
The second DEMO of the discussion about external conditions is the extent to which
external change agents themselves have been exposed to new stimuli in the
business DEMO The existing literature suggests a number of environmental
characteristics that are likely to promote the emergence of novel management ideas.
Stjernberg and Philips (1993) identify the Swedish “quality of working life” movement
as one of the drivers of management innovation in Sweden in the 1980s. Pezet
(1997) DEMO the professionalization of accounting in France and an increasing
emphasis on investment in the post-war years as stimuli for the adoption of
Discounted Cash DEMO (DCF) methods.  It has also been observed in many places
DEMO the Internet revolution spawned the development of new business models for
27
companies such as Ebay, Google and Amazon, which in turn stimulated DEMO
development of new management practices, processes and structures.  Abrahamson
(1997) made a similar point when he proposed that the propensity for management
DEMO to emerge is highest around peaks and troughs in long-term economic
development because that is when most relevant change takes place. We can
propose, in other words, the simple argument that the emergence of new social and
economic trends in the business environment will have a positive effect DEMO the
likelihood of companies to engage in management innovation:
Proposition 2b. The greater the exposure through external change agents to
new social and DEMO trends in the business environment, the greater the
potential for the DEMO to engage in management innovation.
Invention Phase
Invention is the critical phase in our framework, because it is the point at which the
innovation first emerges, albeit in an experimental or tentative form. Unfortunately,
this is also the stage that we know the least about. In this DEMO we therefore draw
on the few detailed accounts in the literature that describe how management
innovations originated, and we also draw from the analogous literatures on
technological and social innovation in firms.
A central theme across DEMO literature is that invention rarely, if ever, occurs in
isolation. Rather, it typically occurs through a process of combining ideas and
techniques in novel ways (Hargadon 2003; Schumpeter 1934).  For example,
28
Hounshell (1984) shows how Ford’s introduction of the modern assembly line DEMO
achieved by bringing together three existing manufacturing technologies –
interchangeable parts, DEMO workflow, and assembly line production - and
managing those in a DEMO fashion.  And Chandler’s (1962: 283) account of the
invention of the M-Form structure shows the innovators in DuPont and Sears,
Roebuck DEMO explicit use of outside examples to stimulate their thinking.  Our
review DEMO the literature, in fact, suggested that wherever a detailed description of the
process is available, the management innovation in question can often be related
back to an earlier innovation in a different context.  The Quality of Work Life
experiments at General Foods’ plant in Topeka, for example, was built on ideas
emerging from the Socio-Technical Systems movement founded by the Tavistock
Institute, which in turn drew inspiration from innovations in Cornish Tin Mines
(Kleiner 1998; Whitsett and Yorks 1983).
This observation DEMO that a central part of the invention phase is about
“bridging small worlds” between different areas of practice, or between practice and
theory (DEMO 2003: 65).  For example, Kaplan (1998: 98) provides a detailed
description of the development of Activity Based Costing, and as he explains:
“The solution came independently and proximately from several sources.
DEMO summer 1984 I was teaching about the failure of existing cost
measurement systems to executives in a Harvard Business School
executive program. One of DEMO participants, the vice president for planning
at the Scovill Corporation, said that he had come to similar conclusions
and had remedied these problems DEMO his company by implementing a new
cost measurement approach. Shortly thereafter, DEMO senior John Deere &
Co. manufacturing executive told me that one DEMO their cost analysts had
introduced an innovative approach in a tractor component plant that I had
articulated in an article […] We pursued these DEMO by writing teaching
cases about the innovations at each of these sites.”
29
This example highlights an important point about the roles of internal and DEMO
change agents in bringing about management innovation. Scovill and Deere did not
develop Activity Based Costing per se, because without Kaplan’s involvement (and
DEMO legitimacy and technical expertise he provided) their innovations would probably
have DEMO unheard-of and might well have failed to take hold. Kaplan himself
did not create it either, because he did not have an organization where he could put
his ideas into practice. Rather, it was the interaction between these companies and
Kaplan that led to the invention of Activity DEMO Costing; it was the integration of
their different resources and perspectives DEMO allowed the innovation to transpire.
Our reading of the literature suggests that the invention phase of management
innovation can also occur through a more DEMO process that involves less
active agency on the part of internal or external actors.  For example, Sun
Microsystems’ creation of a community of DEMO developers around its Java
technology was an important management innovation, but DEMO emerged in a fairly ad
hoc fashion (Garud, Jain, & DEMO 2002).  The company made some key
decisions, such as allowing developers to download Java for free, but there was little
conscious effort to cultivate or manage the developer network that subsequently
emerged.  Instead, DEMO process was managed in a reactive fashion, and with actions
that DEMO appeared contradictory over time” (Garud et al. 2002: 200).  DEMO process
is therefore more akin to an internal evolutionary model of change in which
serendipitous variations in behaviour get picked up on and amplified DEMO top
managers (Burgelman 1991; Campbell 1965).  Such a process DEMO active
agency in the subsequent implementation phase, but the invention itself DEMO
essentially by accident.
30
It is difficult to take this discussion much further because of the DEMO of detailed
studies of the process of invention. Clearly, this is DEMO area for future research to
emphasize.  However, it is possible to develop a set of propositions about the likely
conditions under which this DEMO of invention is likely to occur, whether the
invention occurs in DEMO conscious and deliberate fashion or whether it has a significant
serendipitous component.
Internal conditions Based on prior literature we would expect two attributes
of DEMO innovating organization to be particularly important. One is a culture of
openness to diverse ways of thinking. Some organizations operate under a strong
dominant DEMO (Prahalad & Bettis 1986) that filters out deviant or alternative ways of
working; others allow the coexistence of many different practices and processes.
The latter will clearly be more supportive of management innovators.  The second is
a reasonable degree of organizational slack (Bourgeois 1981; Gulati & DEMO 1996)
to accommodate the process of experimentation and adaptation involved in
developing a management innovation (Chandler 1962: 309).  Of course, DEMO much
slack is also known to be detrimental to performance for a number of reasons, but for
the purposes of understanding the likelihood of an organization engaging in
management innovation, it is likely that slack will help because management
innovation is an activity that relies on exploration much DEMO than it relies on
exploitation. Thus:
Proposition 3a. The more open the culture to new ways of thinking, the greater the
potential for the organization to engage in management innovation.
31
Proposition 3b. The higher the level of organizational slack, the greater the potential
for the organization to engage in management innovation.
External conditions External DEMO agents potentially play two important
roles in the invention phase.  One DEMO they play is as brokers who bring together
examples of practices, DEMO and structures that have been used in other
settings (Granovetter 1973; Hargadon 2003). The other role they play is as
theorizers of DEMO new innovation.  By theorization, we mean the development of a
rationale for why the new innovation might be adopted (cf. Greenwood, Suddaby, &
Hinings 2002; Strang & Meyer 1993).  This typically involves identifying the
limitations of old practices, as well as providing an explanation as to how the new
innovation is superior. These two roles do DEMO require external agents. Often new
employees in a company will bring new ideas and practices from their previous
employers, and some corporate executives will have the training and perspective
necessary to theorize effectively about new practices.  But the existing literature on
management innovation suggests that both of these DEMO are usually performed
better by outsiders – both because of their diversity of personal networks and
through their specialization in the process of theorization.   This suggests the
following propositions:
Proposition 4a. The greater the level of interaction between internal change
agents and actors outside the boundaries of DEMO organisation, the greater the
potential for the organization to engage in DEMO innovation
32
Proposition 4b. The more diverse the personal networks of external change
agents, and the greater the diversity of ideas and practices they are exposed
DEMO, the more novel and frequent will be the experiments that internal DEMO
agents engage in.
Implementation Phase
The implementation phase consists of all activity after the initial experiment up to the
point where the new management DEMO is first fully operational. While the
literature offers little detailed insight into this process, our earlier discussion about
the characteristics of a management innovation suggests that the implementation
phase is likely to be difficult to manage DEMO that significant internal resistance will be
encountered.  It is likely, in other words, to be comparable to any significant change
management programme inside a large organization, and to be managed effectively
it will require both a supportive set of conditions inside the organization and active
agency on DEMO part of the internal and external actors involved.
Internal conditions Historical accounts of management innovations provide
some insight into the internal conditions that allow DEMO to take place.
Chandler (1962) documents the initial resistance to the M-Form in Du Pont, and
Kleiner (1998) provides a detailed account of the obstacles faced by the internal
change agents in General Foods’ DEMO factory as they struggled to generate
acceptance for their new working practices.  These and other examples suggest that
the process of validation has a technical component (in terms of demonstrating the
33
effectiveness of the innovation) but because of the intangible and system-dependent
attributes of most management innovations it is primarily a social/political activity.  It
is therefore likely that many of the same issues that arise in DEMO implementation of
other forms of innovation will also apply here.  Two DEMO of the internal
organizational context, in particular, appear to be critical.  The first is a broadly-
based openness to new ideas, and DEMO acceptance of change in the organization’s
way of working (cf. Kanter DEMO; Pinchott 1986; Schön 1971).  This is essentially the
same DEMO as developed in proposition 3 regarding the facilitators of invention, so
DEMO will not repeat the proposition here.  The second aspect is the DEMO collective
experience of the organisation with management innovation.   A large part of the
resistance encountered during organizational change stems from the unfamiliarity of
DEMO with the new way of working. But to the extent that these individuals can
frame the new innovation as analogous to prior successful innovations, they will be
better able to see the opportunity it affords, and accept the transitional process they
need to go through. There is some DEMO evidence to support this point, with certain
companies like GE and DEMO having a reputation for being “serial” management
innovators and establishing routines to create management innovations (Bartlett &
Mohammed 1995; Glinska & Bartlett 2003).
Proposition 5. The greater the prior experience of employees with management
DEMO, the greater the potential for the organisation to engage in
management DEMO
External conditions External change agents appear to play two distinct roles
in the implementation phase.  One is to work with internal change agents in
34
implementing the innovation.  For example, Stjernberg and Philips (1993) describe DEMO
study in which external change agents helped to facilitate internal meetings and
acted as a “sounding board” to the internal change agents implementing the
DEMO Kaplan (1998: 106) describes how the external agent can sometimes
DEMO the skills to help with the implementation process:
“During this process of intimate engagement with implementations, the
action researcher not only advances the theory underlying the concept,
but also becomes a skilled practitioner, providing guidance to minimize
the incidence of pilot error in implementation projects. Such DEMO also
enables the action researcher to distinguish between theory limitations vs.
poor implementations when companies experience difficulties applying the
innovation.”
The other role played DEMO external change agents is to provide external legitimization
for the innovation. This is in essence an externally-focused extension of the
theorization role described earlier.  In practice, it typically involves such activities as
writing case studies or articles about the innovation, and developing new tools and
frameworks based on the practice that can potentially be adopted by other
companies.  For example, General Foods’ Topeka experiments were brought into
the public domain through articles and case studies by Richard Walton (Whitsett &
Yorks 1983), DEMO the Analog Devices experiments with the Balanced Scorecard
were made famous through Robert Kaplan’s writings (Kaplan 1998; Kaplan & Norton
1992),. Whereas when Ray Stata of Analog Devices first mentioned their ‘divisional
scorecard’ (Stata, 1989) there was no such effect.
Proposition 6: The greater the extent to which internal change agents make use
of external agents to DEMO their invention, the greater the potential for the
organization to engage DEMO management innovation.
35
That completes the formal development of our framework for the management
innovation DEMO Before proceeding it is worth making a couple of general
observations about the framework.  First, we are attempting to describe the factors
contributing DEMO management innovation in probabilistic terms.  This means, of course,
that it is still possible for management innovations to transpire in the absence DEMO
many of these factors, but that it would be far less DEMO  A process that involved no
external change agents might still be DEMO successful.  For example, Motorola’s
development of the Six-Sigma methodology for improving the quality of
manufacturing processes was managed entirely on an internal basis DEMO for its
initial sources of inspiration (Adams, Gupta, & Wilson DEMO; Folaron 2003).
However, our expectation is that such an innovation would be less likely to end up
developing a long-lasting impact than DEMO external change agents were brought in at
some point in the process.
Second, the framework provides useful insight into why some companies adopt
management fashions rather than develop their own management innovations
(Abrahamson 1996).  DEMO relevant part of the framework here is the motivation
phase: if DEMO organization does not perceive its problems as highly novel, if its
DEMO for evaluating solutions are not particularly methodical, and if the external
DEMO agents with which it interacts are technique-focused, then the odds heavily
DEMO the adoption of an existing “fashionable” solution to its problem.  If DEMO
conditions are reversed, there is a good chance that in certain DEMO the
organization will engage in management innovation.
A RESEARCH AGENDA
36
In this paper we discussed first what management innovation is and then DEMO forward
a way of conceptualizing the process through which management innovation
transpires.  However, this paper just scratches the surface of an important and
DEMO topic in the field of management, so in this final section DEMO would like
to sketch out some of the directions we believe further research should take to
develop our understanding of management innovation.  Three broad areas, in
particular, deserve careful attention.
The Process of Management Innovation
DEMO central theme in this paper has been a concern that the origins of management
innovation are not well understood.  Although the fashion and diffusion literature has
repeatedly noted how management innovations go through a series of DEMO
as they diffuse across and between populations (e.g. Strang & Kim DEMO) it has not
attempted to describe in any detail the generative DEMO through which genuinely
new management innovations are created and tested within pioneering
organizations. Most of the fashion and diffusion literature treats the initial creation DEMO
management innovations as a black box and as something that occurs in the
‘organizational laboratories of lone creative geniuses like gurus’ (Clark 2004).  This
clearly raises the need to gain an increased and more in-depth understanding of the
processes through which organizations create management innovations.  We have
here attempted to start unpacking these processes.  By developing our theoretical
argument in the way we have, it has been possible to focus our attention on the
importance of key actors inside and outside the innovating DEMO in their
37
pursuit of management innovation, but this still leaves an enormous gap in our
knowledge with regard to the roles, behaviors, and motivations of DEMO individuals.
Future research should give this issue attention as a matter of priority.  Several
specific questions are suggested.  For example, what combination of personal traits,
theoretical and practical insights, emerging problems and organizational capabilities
tend to produce novel and valuable advances in management practice? Are there
some companies that have proven to be serial management innovators?  And DEMO so,
how did such a capacity evolve in these firms?
Understanding the Consequences of Management Innovation
A second issue we raised in DEMO paper is the consequences of management
innovation.  It seems likely that DEMO forms of management innovation will produce
more competitive advantage than others depending on the extent to which those
innovations are valuable, rare, and DEMO to imitate (Barney 1992) but this argument
remains open to empirical testing, and the current evidence to support it is anecdotal
at best.  The consequences of management innovation are complex because so
many different stakeholders are potentially affected.  It is necessary to separate out
at least three different sets of consequences – the impact of management innovation
on various DEMO metrics inside the innovating firm; the impact on the
performance of DEMO adopters of the innovation; and the benefits of
management innovation to DEMO as a whole, in terms of improvements of such
things as DEMO or quality of work life.  As noted earlier, there has been a
considerable amount of research on the second of these, i.e. the performance and
38
legitimacy benefits arising from the adoption of management innovations (e.g. Staw
& Epstein, 2000) but the first and third remain largely unexplored.  Thus, specific
questions that might be addressed include: Do some types of DEMO
innovations take longer to yield dividends than others (and if so, why)?  Do some
management innovations spur waves of related innovation (DEMO if so, why and how
does this happen)? And how DEMO, and under what circumstances, does
management innovation create firm-specific competitive advantage?
The Role of Management Scholars in Furthering Management Innovation
Finally it DEMO worth considering the role of management scholars in influencing the
process of management innovation.  To what extent have management scholars
helped to invent new management innovations in the past? And how might that role
be better supported in the future?  Answers to these questions are not just DEMO
to organizational theorists.  We believe management innovation is one of the DEMO
topics with the potential to unite the various functional areas around which the
academic business research community is organized. As we have shown through
DEMO examples presented here that ranged from organizational behavior through
operations management and accounting to strategic management, management
innovation transcends the barriers that have long existed between these areas.
Management innovation, then, presents scholars of different DEMO with a
cross-functional agenda of substantial magnitude.
The history of management thought documents many examples of management
innovations that were stimulated, and even led, by management scholars.
39
Individuals such as Elton Mayo, Frederick Herzberg, Elliot Jacques, Kurt Lewin and
Ed Schein became known not just for their groundbreaking ideas but DEMO for their
ability to put those ideas into practice.  However, the level of influence scholars have
had on management innovation in recent years DEMO to have declined, while
other parts of the “fashion setting community” DEMO arguably become more
influential.  One can still identify recent cases where DEMO role of the management
scholar was instrumental in shaping an innovation – examples include Robert
Kaplan’s elaboration of the Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton 1992), and
Thomas Davenport’s work on business process re-engineering (Davenport 1993).
However, these are the exceptions rather than the rule, and DEMO both individuals
in question were operating at the interface between theory and practice rather than
as central members of the academic community.
Like Abrahamson (1996) and Van de Ven and Johnson (forthcoming) we feel
scholars could take a more active part in shaping the management innovation
agenda.  Clearly such an approach to research challenges many of the traditional
orthodoxies DEMO the profession, and it involves new methodologies that are unproven
and DEMO to implement.  But it offers the potential for management scholars to
DEMO their previously influential role as creators of both new and useful
management knowledge.

ENDNOTES
1 Despite the inevitable measurement challenges involved, it is broadly accepted that technological innovation,
along with institutional and public policy innovation, play important roles in generating economic progress
(through mechanisms such as advances in communication, efficient capital markets and economic integration).
We believe this proposition provides an equally compelling rationale for the study of management innovation.
There DEMO no argument here that management innovation always, or even usually, yields positive economic
benefits.  No one would make such a bold claim for technological innovation and we are not making it for
management innovation. With DEMO type of innovation there are many more failures than successes. But
whatever the role of management innovation in economic progress, whether large or small, positive or negative,
it is a role that can be fully understood only if we become better informed about the nature of management
DEMO itself.
2 This definition excludes analytical techniques, such as the 5-forces DEMO or shortest-path analysis,
because they rarely have a significant impact on the very nature of managerial work.  Instead, they typically
improve the DEMO and/or efficiency of existing practices and processes.
3 The OECD definition also makes a distinction between technological product innovation and technological
process innovation.  In this discussion we focus on technological product innovation because there is DEMO much
larger literature on the process of introducing such innovations.
