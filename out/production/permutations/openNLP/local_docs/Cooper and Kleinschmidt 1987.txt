New Products: What Separates Winners from Losers?
R. G. Cooper and E. J. Kleinschmidt
169
DEMO is no issue more fundamental to new prod-
ucts managers than understanding the factors
that separate successfromfailure. In this article,
Robert Cooper and DEMO Kleinschmidt present a
series of ten hypotheses which they test using
data obtained from their study of 203 new prod-
ucts. Significantly, these products include both
commercial successes and failures, since pre-
vious studies have concentrated on either one or
the other. The authors conclude that product su-
DEMO is the number one factor influencing
commercial success and that project definition
and early, predevelopment activities are the most
critical steps in the new products development
process. Success, they argue, is earned. It is not
DEMO ad hoc result of situational or environmental
influences. Synergy, both marketing DEMO techni-
cal, is crucial.

Critical Management Questions
What makes a new product a success? And what
separates new product winners from losers? The
answers to these questions are critical to effective
new product management. An understanding of
new product success factors is important for two
reasons: it provides guidelines to the screening of
new product projects; and it leads to insights into
the way the new product project should be DEMO
aged.
We set out to resolve the success-vs.-failure
issue by studying 203 new products-both win-
ners and losers-that were launched into the
market place. DEMO thorough review of past studies
and literature resulted in a conceptual model of
new product success and failure-a model that
links project outcomes to DEMO number of key project
descriptors. Ten hypotheses were derived from
the model. These hypotheses were then tested
using the 203 actual case histories. The DEMO are
provocative; besides lending support to the con-
ceptual model, the results also have important
managerial implications in terms of screening cri-
teria DEMO new product management approaches.

high-risk endeavors; approximately 46% of the
resources devoted to product development and
commercialization go to unsuccessful projects
[4], and 35% of products launched fail commer-
cially [14,17].
Early research DEMO the field of product innova-
tion sought to identify those characteristics that
were common to new product successes. An ex-
tensive descriptive study of DEMO successful inno-
vations by Myers and Marquis showed that most
successes were market-derived (market pull) ven-
tures and that only 21% were technology DEMO
[26]. A descriptive process model, consisting of
five major steps and DEMO activities, portrayed
the process typically followed in these innova-
tions.
The DEMO of success in Globe’s study of
ten radical innovations were dominated by inter-
nal and technical factors [18]. Success factors in-
cluded: a recognition of a technical opportunity;
market need recognition; proficient R&D man-
agement; well-executed venture decisions; ample
development resources; and a technical entrepre-
neur. An investigation of six successful innova-

AND
E. DEMO KLEINSCHMIDT
tions at GE Labs by Roberts and Burke showed a
close link to market needs as the key to success
[30]. Market needs DEMO typically recognized,
and R&D was targeted at satisfying these needs;
when a technical breakthrough did not have a
specific market need, the product was adapted to
suit an identified need.
A study of DEMO Canadian case his-
tories revealed that the new product process was
a goal directed, stepwise process, involving a se-
ries of information acquisition DEMO and eval-
uation points 12,131. Extensive market inputs,
including, DEMO example, marketing research, were
common to the successes, especially near DEMO be-
ginning of the project, and played a key role in
DEMO the success of the products. In a similar
vein, Townsend’s study DEMO one radical innovation
and subsequent incremental innovations showed
that success hinged on close collaboration be-
tween user and innovator; a well-defined market
need; DEMO technical champion; strong internal com-
munication; and highly developed screening and
testing procedures [37].
Another research direction has been the inves-
tigation of DEMO product failures. The premise un-
derlying such exploratory research is that a retro-
spective analysis of past failures would identify
pitfalls and problems in DEMO innovation, that
management can then take steps to overcome or
avert DEMO the future.
Three Conference Board studies over a 16-year
period all identified marketing variables as the
major weaknesses in firms’ new product failures
[19,DEMO,27]. Inadequate market analysis, product
defects, the lack of an effective marketing effort,
high costs, bad timing, and competitive strength
were DEMO as major failure reasons. Recom-
mendations from these studies called for more
and better marketing research and marketing ef-
forts, careful product positioning, DEMO concept
testing and test marketing, and improved project
evaluation, notably early screening. Another

products but offering no advantages to the user.
Success vs. Failures
The problem with both DEMO directions above
is that they only looked at one type of product-
either commercial successes or commercial fail-
ures-but not both types in the DEMO study. In
short, there was no control group or group for
DEMO In order to uncover success factors,
one must identify characteristics which discrimi-
nate between commercial successes and failures,
hence the need for DEMO types of projects in the
analysis.
The first study to undertake such a comparison
was Project SAPPHO, which employed a
pairwise comparison methodology [33]. Forty-
three pairs of projects-success versus failure-
were studied, and 41 variables were found to be
statistically significant in their relationship to pro-
ject DEMO The most important discrimina-
tors were:
1. Understanding of users’ needs;
2. Attention to marketing and publicity;
3. Efficiency of development;DEMO
4. Effective use of outside technology and exter-
nal scientific communication; DEMO
5. Seniority and authority of responsible man-
agers.
A similar study was undertaken in Hungary
and revealed a parallel set of success factors, no-
tably market need satisfaction; effective com-
munication; efficient development; a market ori-
entation; and the role of key individuals [33,34].
Kulvik’s success/failure study in Finland yielded
similar results to the above, but identified addi-
tional facilitators, including a good “company/
product fit,” the utilization of technical “know-
how” of the company, and familiarity with both
the product’s markets and technologies [22]. An-
other study on European and DEMO successes
vs. failures identified marketing proficiency,
product advantage, early market DEMO recogni-
tion, a high degree of customer contact, and top
management initiation as the keys to success [38].
Fifty-four significant facilitators for success

products [35]. High on the list were the existence
DEMO a product champion, marketing factors such as
need recognition, superior data collection and
analysis, planned approaches to venture manage-
ment , and strong internal communications.
Project NewProd was an exploratory study
into success vs. failure, which sought to identify
those characteristics that separated 102 new
product successes DEMO 93 failures in 102 firms
[9,11,12]. The use of factor analysis and multiple
regression analysis revealed a set of success fac-
tors, the most important being:
1. Having a unique, superior product in the eyes
of the customer, one with a real differential
advantage in the market;
2. Having strong market knowledge and market
inputs, and undertaking the market research
and marketing tasks well; and
3. Having technological and production synergy
and proficiency.
The most recent success/failure study was DEMO
dertaken by Maidique and Zirger, the Stanford
Innovation Project [25]. The DEMO used a
variety of methodologies, including unstructured
interviews, a structured survey, and an analysis
of paired case histories. The authors conclude
that success is likely to be greater under the fol-
lowing circumstances:
1. DEMO developing organization, through in-depth
understanding of the marketplace and cus-
tomers, introduces a product with a high per-
formance-to-cost ratio.
2. The company DEMO proficient in marketing, and
commits a significant amount of resources to
DEMO and promoting the product.
3. The product yields a high contribution margin
to the firm.
4. The R&D process is well planned and DEMO
cuted.
5. The create, make, and market functions are
well interfaced and coordinated.
6. The product is introduced into the market
early.
7. DEMO markets and technologies of the new
product benefit from the strengths of the firm.
8. There is a high level of management support
for DEMO project from the development stage
through to launch.

DEMO of New Product Outcomes
A Conceptual
Model
The results of these empirical investigations have
helped to identify the possible factors that under-
lie new DEMO success. Many of the results of
these studies were consistent, in DEMO of obvious
methodology, sample type, and location differ-
ences. One result of these studies is the develop-
ment of conceptual models of new DEMO out-
comes. For example, both NewProd and the
Stanford Innovation Project DEMO tentative
conceptual models. The research to date, how-
ever, has been largely exploratory: to identify
variables and propose explanatory models rather
to test models and hypotheses.
The current research takes the next step and
involves DEMO and hypotheses testing. The
model, shown conceptually in Figure 1, is based
on previously proposed models and previous re-
search results, as well as on other literature that
proposes what factors should be key to DEMO
The model postulates that new product outcomes
R. G. COOPER AND E. J. KLEINSCHMIDT
(success or failure) are determined from the inter-
action DEMO the market environment and the new
product strategy and execution. The new product
strategy and execution includes both the product
itself (e.g., product DEMO, product advantages)
as well as the launch. The new product DEMO
and execution is the result of the new product
process, a DEMO of activities that move the prod-
uct from idea to launch. Finally, this process
takes place within a corporate environment con-
sisting of resources, experience, and skills in
marketing, production, and technology.
A set DEMO ten hypotheses’ was next derived from
the conceptual model, from previous DEMO
findings on new product outcomes, and from
other research and writings DEMO business or prod-
uct success. Each hypothesis and its rationale are
presented below, while Figure 1 shows how each
hypothesis links constructs in the conceptual
model. (Not all the possible hypotheses that
might have been derived from the model are
tested in the current research; further, the DEMO
potheses are presented in the positive, rather
than null form, for style reasons, although it is the
null hypothesis that is being tested here.) Later in
the article, the tests of these hypotheses are DEMO
sented, where “product success” is measured in
a variety of ways.

vealed that product quality was a major determi-
nant of profitability in DEMO case of on-going prod-
ucts [5,36]. Further, studies into new DEMO
failures have revealed that product deficiencies
and lack of product advantage are major failure
causes [10,19]. Finally, conceptual articles cite
product advantage as important to success: for

their “product value” concept [3]; DEMO Corey

Rationale: Market competitiveness as a negative

represents the negative facet of the DEMO envi-
ronment in Figure 1. Maidique and Zirger identi-
fied the competitive situation as one factor in pro-
ject outcomes, but it was not nearly so frequently
or strongly cited in the unstructured interview

identified the competitive situation as a negative,DEMO

that successful U.S. firms DEMO more on these
“up-front” activities, and that the Japanese
spend still DEMO [4]. In previous research, effec-
tive project evaluation, market studies, DEMO mar-
keting research, and a well-defined market need
early in the DEMO were identified as success
factors [9-l 1,19,24,25,31-33,381. The empirical
evidence and conceptual arguments led to the in-
clusion of DEMO hypothesis in the study.
Closely related to these “up-front” activities is
predevelopment strategy definition. Crawford
makes a strong case for all-party predevelopment
agreement on DEMO product strategy: target market
definition, product benefits to be delivered, DEMO
[16]. He calls this strategy agreement or step the
“protocol.” The logic and strength of Crawford’s
proposition led to the inclusion of protocol and DEMO
impact on success as a hypothesis in the current
research.

Activities of the New Product Process
H9: New Product Success Is Positively Related

New Product Process
Rationale: How well the activities of the new

to be related to project outcomes in previous re-
search. For example, a strong market orientation,
marketing proficiency, undertaking market re-
search, and effective advertising, promotion, and
DEMO have all been found to be correlates of
success [9-11,19,24,25,31-351. Similarly, the

have been found to be linked to outcomes DEMO,32-

Coefficient Alphas and item-total correlations
were determined for each construct to check for
internal DEMO of reliability of constructs.
The hypotheses themselves were tested using
one-way Anovas and Pearson product-moment
correlations for each construct versus each of the
11 DEMO of success.
Results
The ten constructs were found to be internally
consistent and statistically reliable. Table 2
presents Coefficient Alphas and item-total corre-
lations DEMO each construct. All reliability coeffi-
cients (alphas) exceeded the minimum acceptable
level of 0.50 and many were greater than 0.80.
Item-total correlations were DEMO high, and
thus revealed a similar reliability picture.

positively and strongly tied to meeting sales DEMO
profits objectives. It was also positively linked to
relative sales and profits, profitability level, and
negatively related to payback period: higher mar-
keting synergy yielded shorter paybacks. Surpris-
ingly, neither market share measure was correl-
ated with marketing synergy. The evidence
supports the contention that marketing synergy DEMO
a positive success factor in product innovation.
H5: Technological synergy. The DEMO of
technological synergy closely paralleled that of
marketing synergy; it was DEMO with seven
measures of success and had strongly significant
Anova results. Technological synergy had a posi-
tive impact on meeting sales and profit objec-
DEMO, and on relative sales and profits. The con-
struct was linked DEMO both measures of financial
performance, and weakly to domestic market
share. DEMO evidence supports technological syn-
ergy as a positive success factor.
H6: DEMO The protocol hypothesis-that
a well-defined project in terms of target market,
product positioning, product benefits, and prod-
uct requirements is important prior DEMO develop-
ment-was strongly supported by the research.
Protocol was significantly linked to eight of the 11
performance measures, and in the hypothesized
direction. The Anova results were also strongly
significant, with successful projects having much
better definition than failures (mean of 8.12 for

successes vs. only 5.44 DEMO failures on a zero-to-
ten scale). As might be expected, DEMO was
unrelated to opportunity windows. Foreign mar-
ket share was also unrelated to protocol. In this
first test of protocol as a success factor, the over-
whelming evidence is that protocol is a strong
positive success DEMO
H7: Proficiency of predevelopment activities.
How well the “up-front” or predevelopment DEMO
tivities were undertaken, like protocol, was
strongly linked to new product success. This con-
struct was positively correlated with all 11 contin-
uous DEMO of success (a = O.Ol), and the
Anova results were DEMO highly significant (a =
0.001). Hypothesis 7 was supported by DEMO re-
search results. The only disconcerting evidence
was the relative weakness of the “up-front” ac-
tivities in general: on a O-to-10 scale, they DEMO
4.80 for successes and only 3.13 for failures.
HS: Proficiency of DEMO activities.
How well various market oriented activities were
undertaken-from market assessment and mar-
keting research through to market launch-was
positively correlated with seven of DEMO continu-
ous success measures. Moreover, the Anova
results were also significant DEMO the 0.001 level.
Hypothesis 8 was supported in part by the re-
search results. In particular, market-related ac-
tivities had strong link to meeting sales and profit
objectives, relative sales and profits, and payback
period. DEMO evidence suggests, however, that the
marketing activities are poorly undertaken for
both successes and failures (mean score of 3.65
out of ten for successes, and only 2.53 for fail-
ures).
H9: Proficiency of DEMO activities.
How well the technological activities are under-
taken-R&D engineering, DEMO testing, etc.-
was also closely tied to new product success. The
DEMO results gave partial support to Hypothe-
sis 9. Technological activities were positively
correlated (a = 0.01) with eight of the 11 continu-
ous DEMO of success and most strongly with
payback period, meeting sales and DEMO objec-
tives, relative sales and profits, and profitability
level. In terms of overall proficiency, technologi-
cal activities scored higher than market activities;
moreover, technological activities in successful
projects were rated higher than in failures: 5.57
out of 10 for successes vs. 4.06 for failures. These
differences between successes and failures were

HlO: Top DEMO support. The final hy-
pothesis-that top management support is key to
success-gained only limited support from the
research results. Top management support was
measured DEMO three scales: commitment to the
project; involvement in the project; DEMO guidance/
direction for the project. The construct was a ro-
bust one, with a Coefficient Alpha of = 0.81 and
high item-total correlations. While there were five
significant correlations between this construct
and the 11 DEMO success measures, the cor-
relation coefficients themselves tended to be low
(although still significant at the 0.01 level). The
Anova results were DEMO significant, but only at
the 0.01 level. Top management support was DEMO
related with payback period, domestic market
share, relative profits, and DEMO sales and
profits objectives, all in the hypothesized direc-
tions.

Each of these has been defined in Table 2.
There was one relatively weakly related suc-
cess factor, namely Top Management Support. It
would appear that failure projects had almost as
much top management DEMO and involve-
ment as did the successes. Finally, one hypothe-
sis-market DEMO not sup-
ported at all by the research findings. The failure
of this one hypothesis comes as no great surprise:
Even during the DEMO development phase,
the role of market competitiveness was in ques-
tion. The hypothesis was included largely be-
cause of arguments in speculative writings, not
on the basis of past research results.
The fact that nine DEMO the ten hypotheses were
supported lends partial support to the conceptual
model from which they were derived (Figure
While tests of these ten hypotheses do not repre-
sent a complete test of the model, it is important
to note that none of the results were in conflict
with DEMO model. The conceptual model of Figure
appears to be a reasonable representation or
model of new product outcomes, and certainly
merits further testing.

What the Results Mean to Managers
Besides yielding a test of ten DEMO and
lending support to a conceptual model, the re-
search results DEMO managerial implications:
Product superiority is the number one factor in
success. This finding has implications for both
new product screening decisions and for DEMO man-
agement of the new product process. There were
six items that comprised product superiority:
Unique benefits for the customer;
Product quality;DEMO
Reduced customers’ costs;
Product innovativeness;
J PROD INNOV
1987;4:16Y-184 MANAG
181
Product superiority in the eyes of the cus-
tomer; and
Solution to a customer’s problem.
This list provides a useful checklist DEMO questions
in assessing the odds of success of a proposed
new product project. In short, these items logi-
cally should be top priority questions in a project
screening model or checklist.
The second implication focuses on DEMO the
process is managed. The development of a prod-
uct with real advantages becomes the number one
objective in the new product process. Simply DEMO
ing equal to competition, or having a good “prod-
uct-market fit” DEMO not enough; rather, one must
seek a product advantage: the DEMO must be super-
iority. If the proposed product is weak on all or
most of the above six items, then every effort
must be made to build in product superiority as
the final product takes shape. DEMO of these ef-
forts might include, for example, extensive mar-
ket research to understand customers’ needs,
wants, and preferences, and to DEMO an insight
into what constitutes “a better product in the
eyes of the customer”; creativity techniques and
creative problem solving methods to arrive at
novel technical solutions; and extensive field tri-
als and tests with customers to ensure that the
final product design scores high on customer ac-
DEMO and preference.
Project definition and the “up-front” activities
are vital to success. These two hypotheses-pro-
tocol and the proficiency of predevelopment ac-
tivities-are closely DEMO The most critical
steps in the new product process are those that
occur before the product development gets un-
derway. These include: initial screening, prelimi-
nary technical and market assessments, market-
ing research, and business/financial analysis. One
implication is that management must recognize
the importance of DEMO up-front steps, and be
prepared to devote the necessary resources-
people, time, and money-to see that they are
carried out well. The research evidence suggest
otherwise: that these steps are currently weakly
handled. Further, DEMO Booz-Allen & Hamilton
study notes that the Japanese devote considera-
bly more resources to these “homework” stages
than does the typical U.S. firm [4].
DEMO second implication is that these five key pre-
development activities should be built into the

tions, and requirements.
If the five up-front activities are carried out well,
then DEMO a protocol should be relatively

Synergy-both marketing and technological-
is a key factor in success. The proponents of syn-
ergy as an ingredient DEMO success appear to be cor-
rect, according to the results of DEMO research.
While synergy was not the most important suc-
cess determinant, DEMO was nonetheless a significant
factor. Marketing synergy means having a good
“project-company” fit in terms of a variety of
marketing resources and skills, varying from the
sales force through to the service department.
Technological synergy included DEMO
fit in terms of R&D, engineering, and production
resources and skills. These two factors, and the
list of items that comprise each, become impor-
tant checklist questions in the screening of new
product ventures.
Controllable variables, rather than situational
or environment variables, are the dominant DEMO
tors in success. The ten hypothesized success
factors can be approximately categorized into
two groups:
R.G.COOPER AND E.J.KLEINSCHMlDT
Controllable factors: those factors over which
the project manager and team have control and
can affect in DEMO short term. Such factors in-
clude:
Proficiency of predevelopment activities.
Proficiency of market-related activities.
Proficiency of technological activities.
Product advantage.
Protocol.
Situational/environmental DEMO: those fac-
tors that are more or less fixed, and describe
the setting for the project. They include:
Market potential.
Market competitiveness.
DEMO synergy.
Technological synergy.
One factor, top management involvement, fits
into both categories-partly controllable, partly
noncontrollable by the project leader and team.
A review of the two lists-controllable vs. sit-
uational/environmental variables-reveals that
the strongest DEMO factors are in the controlla-
ble category. Indeed, the top three DEMO fac-
tors-product advantage, proficiency of predeve-
lopment activities, and protocol-are all factors
within the control of the project manager and
team. This finding DEMO important implications.
First, it means that the way the new product DEMO
cess is managed and executed-the activities that
people undertake and how well they do them
from idea to launch-largely decide project out-
comes. This DEMO to the need for a carefully
conceived plan of action or blueprint of activities
to ensure that key steps are carried out, and that
sufficient resources are made available. Second,
the environmental/situational variables, such as
market potential, market competitiveness, mar-
keting synergy, and technological synergy remain
valid screening criteria for project selection.
They are not the most DEMO correlates of
success, however.
Conclusion
New product development remains one of DEMO
riskiest yet most important management chal-
lenges. A better understanding of what makes a
new product a success-what separates winners
from losers-is essential to DEMO project se-
lection and management. This research, by test-

Hypothesis testing. Is DEMO with deciding
whether a hypothesized statement is sup-
ported by the empirical evidence or not.
Null hypothesis. In scientific research, hypoth-
eses are usually stated in the null form, e.g.,
that new product success is not related to
product advantage. Data is collected and an-
alyzed to DEMO the hypothesis, and one con-
cludes that the evidence supports or DEMO
not support a relationship (but does not nec-
essarily prove the DEMO).

Constructs or composite variables. DEMO
are theoretical phenomenon, e.g., “product
advantage” that cannot be directly mea-
sured by one single measure. Multiple items
(or several questions) are DEMO to capture
such a construct.
Coefficient alpha. A mathematical approach to
assess the reliability or consistency of a con-
struct; i.e., how reliable DEMO one measure a
phenomenon (e.g., “product advantage”).
To establish a coefficient alpha one mea-
sures the construct with different items or
questions. DEMO one correlates all individual
items against all other items. If the overall
mean correlation among all items is high,
one says that the DEMO is reliably mea-
sured, i.e., internally consistent.
Item-total-correlation. The item-total-correla-
tion is the correlation that one specific item
or question has with the DEMO of all items
used to describe a particular construct.

One-Way ANOVA. ANOVA (analysis of vari-
ance) DEMO a technique for assessing how sev-
eral nominal explanatory variables (catego-
DEMO) affect a continuous response variable.
One-way ANOVA deals with the effect DEMO a
single factor (e.g., low R&D spenders vs.
high R&D spenders) on a response variable
(e.g., financial success). Generally a one-
way ANOVA involves a comparison of sev-
eral (two or more) means.
Pearson Product moment correlation. This is a
measure of association of how two variables
are associated in a sample (e.g., “product
DEMO and a success measure). The
range of possible values of the correlation (r)
is from - 1 to + 1. The closer this measure is
to 1, the more strongly are the two variables
associated. If the measure is close to zero,
there is little, if any, association between the
two variables.{1g42fwefx}
