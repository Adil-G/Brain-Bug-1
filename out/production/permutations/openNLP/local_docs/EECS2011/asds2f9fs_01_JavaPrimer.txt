<-----Page 5----->Why Java?
‚Ä¢ Java is widely available with large online support.
‚Ä¢ Embraces a full set of modern abstractions.

‚Ä¢ Java‚Äôs motto:

write-once-run-anywhere.

‚Ä¢ Has variety of automatic checks for mistakes in programs,
especially when used in an IDE, e.g., Eclipse.
So, it is suitable for learning to program.
‚Ä¢ EECS2011 uses Java but is not a Java course.
It is an introductory course on data structures.

<-----Page 14----->Classes and Objects
‚Ä¢ Every object is an instance of a class, which serves as the type
of the object and as a blueprint, defining the data which the
object stores and the methods for accessing and modifying
that data.
The critical members of a class in Java are the following:
ÔÇß Instance variables (or fields) represent the data associated with an object of a
class. Instance variables must have a type, which can either be a primitive type
(such as int, float, or double) or any class type.
ÔÇß Methods in Java are blocks of code that can be called to perform actions.
Methods can accept parameters as arguments, and their behavior may
depend on the object upon which they are invoked and the values of any
parameters that are passed. A method that returns information to the caller
without changing any instance variables is known as an accessor method,
while an update method is one that may change one or more instance
variables when called.

‚Ä¢ This class includes one instance variable, named count,
with default value of zero, unless otherwise initialized.
‚Ä¢ The class includes 2 special methods known as constructors,
1 accessor method, and 3 update methods.
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

16

<-----Page 16----->Reference Objects
‚Ä¢ Classes are known as reference types in Java, and a
variable of that type is known as a reference variable.
‚Ä¢ A reference variable ùë£ can be viewed as a ‚Äúpointer‚Äù to
some object of its class type.
‚Ä¢ A reference variable is capable of storing the location (i.e.,
memory address) of an object from the declared class.
ÔÇß So we might assign it to reference an existing
instance or a newly constructed instance.
ÔÇß A reference variable can also store a special value
null that represents the lack of an object.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

17

<-----Page 17----->Creating and Using Objects
‚Ä¢ In Java, a new object is created by using the new operator
followed by a call to a constructor for the desired class.
‚Ä¢ A constructor is a method that always shares the same
name as its class. The new operator returns a reference to
the newly created instance; the returned reference is
typically assigned to an object of that class for further use.
Example:

Counter c = new Counter(167);
c

‚Ä¢ Here, a new Counter is constructed at line 4, with its reference
assigned to the variable c. That relies on a form of the constructor,
Counter( ), that takes no arguments between the parentheses.
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

19

<-----Page 19----->The Dot Operator
‚Ä¢ A reference variable name of an object can be used to access
the members of the object‚Äôs class.
‚Ä¢ This access is performed with the dot (‚Äú.‚Äù) operator.
‚Ä¢ Such access is done by using the object reference variable
name, followed by the dot operator, followed by the member
field or member method name and its parameters:
Examples:
myObject.field
myObject.myMethod ( parameters )
e.increment ( 3 );
System.out.println ( e.getCount() );
System.out.println ( e.count );
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

// increments Counter e by 3
// print counter value of Counter e
// Ooops! count field was private
20

<-----Page 20----->Wrapper Types
‚Ä¢ There are many data structures and algorithms in
Java‚Äôs libraries that are specifically designed so that
they only work with object types (not primitives).
‚Ä¢ To get around this obstacle, Java defines a wrapper
class for each base type.
o Java provides additional support for implicitly converting
between base types and their wrapper types through a
process known as automatic boxing and unboxing.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

22

<-----Page 22----->Signatures
‚Ä¢ If there are several methods with the same name defined
for a class, then the Java runtime system uses the one that
matches the actual number of parameters sent as
arguments, as well as their respective types.
‚Ä¢ A method‚Äôs name combined with the number and types of
its parameters is called a method‚Äôs signature, for it takes
all of these parts to determine the actual method to
perform for a certain method call.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

23

<-----Page 23----->Defining Classes
‚Ä¢ A class definition is a block of code, delimited by
braces ‚Äú{‚Äù and ‚Äú}‚Äù , within which is included:
ÔÇß declarations of instance variables
ÔÇß member methods & constructors
ÔÇß nested classes

‚Ä¢ Immediately before the definition of a class,
instance variable, or method, keywords known as
modifiers can be placed to convey additional
stipulations about that definition.

‚Ä¢ Access modifiers:

public, protected, private, default

‚Ä¢ Change modifier:

final

‚Ä¢ Instantiation modifier:

static

‚Ä¢ Field modifiers:

transient , volatile

‚Ä¢ Method modifiers:

abstract, native, synchronized

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

25

<-----Page 25----->Access Control Modifier
Specifies who has access to a defined aspect of a class:
Motto: information hiding
make each class or member as inaccessible as possible.

‚Ä¢ Private:

accessible by members of the given class.

‚Ä¢ default (package-protected): accessible by classes in
the same package as the given class.
‚Ä¢ protected: accessible by subclasses, as well as classes
in the same package as the given class.
‚Ä¢ public:
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

accessible by all classes.
26

<-----Page 26----->Static Modifier
‚Ä¢ When a field or method member of a class is declared as static,
it is associated with the class as a whole, and is shared by all
instances of that class, e.g., instanceCount.
‚Ä¢ static member access: ClassName.memberName
e.g., Math.sqrt(2) (in the Java Library package java.lang)
‚Ä¢ Primary purpose for static vs. (non-static) instance methods:
ÔÇß static methods: to implement (utility) functions.
ÔÇß instance methods: to implement data-type operations.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

27

<-----Page 27----->Other Modifiers

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

28

<-----Page 28----->Parameters
‚Ä¢ A method‚Äôs parameters are defined in a comma-separated list
enclosed in parentheses after the name of the method.
ÔÇß A parameter consists of two parts, the parameter type and the
parameter name.
ÔÇß If a method has no parameters, then only an empty pair of
parentheses is used.
‚Ä¢ All parameters in Java are passed by value, that is, any time we pass a
parameter to a method, a copy of that parameter is made for use
within the method body.
ÔÇß So if we pass an int variable to a method, then that variable‚Äôs
integer value is copied.
ÔÇß The method can change the copy but not the original.
ÔÇß If we pass an object reference as a parameter to a method, then
that reference is copied (but not the object it points to).
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

29

<-----Page 29----->The Keyword this
Within the body of a method, the keyword this is automatically
defined as an ‚Äúalias‚Äù to the instance upon which the method was
invoked. There are three common uses:
ÔÇß To store the reference in a variable, or send it as a parameter to another
method that expects an instance of that type as an argument.
ÔÇß To differentiate between an instance variable and a local variable or
parameter with the same name.
ÔÇß To allow one constructor body to invoke another constructor body.

Example: Line 4 on page 16 can be written as:
public Counter(int count) { this.count = count; }

<-----Page 30----->Expressions and Operators
‚Ä¢ Existing values can be combined into expressions
using special symbols and keywords known as
operators.
‚Ä¢ The semantics of an operator depends upon the
type of its operands (see ‚Äúoverloading‚Äù later).
Example:
int x = a + b ;
// add integers a and b
String s = ‚Äúrewar‚Äù + ‚Äúding‚Äù ; // concatenate strings
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

31

<-----Page 31----->Arithmetic Operators
‚Ä¢ Java supports the following binary arithmetic operators:

‚Ä¢ If both operands have type int, then the result is an int; if one
or both operands have type double, the result is a double.
‚Ä¢ Integer division has its result truncated.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

32

<-----Page 32----->Increment and Decrement Ops
‚Ä¢ Java provides the plus-one increment (++) and
decrement (‚àí‚àí) unary operators.
ÔÇß If such an operator is used as prefix to a variable
reference, then 1 is added to (or subtracted from) the
variable, then its value is read into the expression.
ÔÇß If it is used as postfix to a variable reference, then the
value is first read, and then the variable is incremented
or decremented by 1.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

33

<-----Page 33----->Logical Operators
‚Ä¢ Java supports the following operators for numerical values,
which result in Boolean values:

‚Ä¢ Boolean values also have the following operators:

‚Ä¢ The and and or operators short circuit, in that they do not
evaluate the second operand if the result can be
determined based on the value of the first operand.
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

34

<-----Page 34----->Conditional Operator
‚Ä¢ Java supports the following ternary operator:
(booleanExpression) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse ;

// acts like if-then-else.
Example:

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

/** this method returns larger of a or b */
public static int max ( int a , int b ) {
return ( a > b) ? a : b;
}

35

<-----Page 35----->Bitwise Operators

<-----Page 37----->Casting
‚Ä¢ Casting is an operation that allows us to change the
type of a value.
‚Ä¢ We can take a value of one type and cast it into an
equivalent value of another type.
‚Ä¢ There are two forms of casting in Java:
ÔÇß explicit casting
ÔÇß implicit casting.

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

38

<-----Page 38----->Explicit Casting
‚Ä¢ Syntax:

(type) exp

Here ‚Äútype‚Äù is the type that we would like the expression
exp to have.
‚Ä¢ This syntax may only be used to cast from one primitive
type to another primitive type, or from one reference type
to another reference type.
Example:
double ap = 14.696;
int round = (int) (ap + 0.5);
double apRound = (double) round;
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

// atmospheric pressure in psi
// round to nearest integer
// cast back as double. Now 15.0
39

<-----Page 39----->Implicit Casting
‚Ä¢ There are cases where Java will perform an implicit cast
based upon the context of an expression.
‚Ä¢ You can perform a widening cast between primitive types
(such as from an int to a double), without explicit use of
the casting operator.
‚Ä¢ However, if attempting to do an implicit narrowing cast, a
compiler error results.
Example:
int x = 2 ; double y = 20.0 ;
y = (3*y+4) / (x+2) ;
// implicit widening cast. Now y == 16.0
x = (3*y+4) / (x+2) ;
// Is now x == 13 ? No. Compiler error! Why?
Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

40

<-----Page 40----->Quiz
// Broken comparator - can you spot the flaw!
public int compare ( Integer first , Integer second ) {
return first < second ? -1 : ( first == second ? 0 : 1 );
}

// What would this return: ‚Äì1 , 0, or 1 ?
compare( new Integer(12) , new Integer(12) ) ;

Last Update: Sep 5, 2016

46

<-----Page 46----->Switch Statements
‚Ä¢ Java provides for multiple-value control flow using the switch
statement.
‚Ä¢ The switch statement evaluates an integer, string, or enum
expression and causes control flow to jump to the code
location labeled with the value of this expression.
‚Ä¢ If there is no matching label, then control flow jumps to the
location labeled ‚Äúdefault‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ This is the only explicit jump performed by the switch
statement, however, so flow of control ‚Äúfalls through‚Äù to the
next case if the code for a case is not ended with a break
statement.

<-----Page 49----->While Loops
‚Ä¢ The simplest kind of loop in Java is a while loop.
‚Ä¢ Such a loop tests that a certain condition is
satisfied and will perform the body of the loop
each time this condition is evaluated to be true.
‚Ä¢ The syntax for such a conditional test before a
loop body is executed is as follows:
