Identifying Innovative Capabilities
Introduction
Joe Tidd1
The resource-based view is concerned essentially DEMO identifying and building on strengths,
preferably those which, for whatever DEMO, are unique to the firm. Every firm is unique by
virtue DEMO its history, value chain configuration, organization culture etc. The challenge is to make
the firm’s uniqueness the source of its sustainable competitive advantage.
DEMO one level the identification of competence appears to pose few difficulties. There are many
cases which refer, for example, to the core competence DEMO Honda in engines or Sony in
minituarisation and which explore why and how these firms have developed and maintain these
competencies. But for core DEMO to be a tool of strategic analysis what is also required is a
means for firms to analyse rigorously, their own and their competitors' competencies. Yet,
despite all the effort and attention, Coyne, Hall and Clifford (1997) writing in The McKinsey
Quarterly in early 1997, noted how elusive core competencies remain, ‘Few managers we have
talked to could claim to have utilised core competence to achieve success in the DEMO,
and even fewer to have built a core competence from scratch. Indeed, most were uncertain as to
exactly what qualifies a core competence ... it is like a mirage: something that from a distance
appears to offer hope..but turns to sand when approached’ (p.41). Our own experience in
working with the concept of core competence supports their view. DEMO disappear all to
easily under close examination. A careful scrutiny of competence claims reveals, all too often,
that they are neither firm specific nor sustainable, that they convey neither functionality to the
customer nor generic qualities to the firm.
This exercise uses a technique for analysing intangible DEMO which is based on the
identification and development of the strengths in the key product/delivery system attributes
and the intangible resources which produce DEMO The exercise consists of three parts:
1. Identifying the key attributes of the most successful products and services offered by the
organization;
DEMO Mapping these attributes to the resources or competencies of the organization, DEMO
tangible and intangible resources;
3. Assessing the potential for sustaining, DEMO and exploiting these resources, including
knowledge management.

1. Identifying key attributes
A pragmatic view on the nature of competitive DEMO was advanced by Coyne (1986) whose
argument starts with the observation that any company which is making repeat sales in a
competitive market DEMO enjoy an advantage in the eyes of the customers who are making the
repeat purchases. He went on to argue that for a sustainable DEMO advantage to exist
three conditions must apply:
• Customers must perceive a consistent difference in important attributes between the
producer’s product/service and DEMO attributes offered by competitors.
• This difference is the direct consequence of a capability gap between the producer and its
competitors.
• Both the DEMO in important attributes and the capability gap can be expected to endure
over time.
Coyne suggests that there are four, and only four, DEMO of resource capability:
• Regulatory: the possession of legal entities, e.g. patents & trademarks.
• Positional: the results of previous endeavour, DEMO reputation, trust, value chain
configuration.
• Business systems: the ability DEMO do things well, e.g. consistent conformance to
specification.
• Organizational characteristics, e.g. the ability to manage change.
It is now possible to ask DEMO question ‘What is the nature of the package of product/delivery
system attributes which customers value?’ and to go on to ask the DEMO, ‘What is responsible
for producing the valued attributes?’. The product/DEMO system attributes will include factors
such as: price, quality, specification, image, etc.
The valued attributes
Table 1. Typical Product/Delivery System Attributes Which Define Competitive
Advantage
Image What is the image of the product DEMO? Is it important?
Price Is a low selling price a DEMO buying criterion?
User friendliness Is it important for the product to be user friendly?
Availability Is product range availability crucial?
Rapid DEMO to enquiry Is it important to produce designs, quotations, etc. very quickly?
Quick response to customer demand Will sales be lost to DEMO competition if they respond
more quickly than you?
Width of product range Is it important to offer a wide range of products and/DEMO services to
customers?
New product to market time How important is the product development time?DEMO
Quality - the product's fitness for purpose Does the product or service deliver exactly the
benefits which the customers want?
Quality - DEMO consistent achievement of defined specification Is constant conformance
to spec. vital?
Safety Is safety in use a major concern?
Regulatory requirements Does DEMO regulatory requirements earlier/better than the
competition give a competitive advantage?
Degree of innovation Is it important for the product or service to DEMO ‘state of the art’?
Ability to vary product specification Is it important to produce product or service
modifications easily and quickly?
Ability DEMO vary product volume Is it important to be able to increase, DEMO decrease,
production volume easily?
Customer service Is the quality of the overall service which customers receive a key to
winning business?
DEMO and after sales service Is the supply of advice, spares, etc. a key aspect of winning
business?
It may be necessary to DEMO different rankings for different categories of customers, e.g. new
as opposed DEMO long-standing customers, retailers as opposed to end users, etc. In carrying out
this analysis of attributes it is appropriate to seek consensus between DEMO relevant executives
with respect to questions such as:
• Can executives agree an importance weighting for each attribute?
• Can executives agree DEMO benchmark score for each attribute compared with the competition?
• Can executives agree the sustainability of the advantage represented by each attribute?
DEMO degree of congruence, or dissonance, in executives’ perceptions of these issues can in itself
be illuminating. In addition to identifying the current strengths DEMO the marketplace, it is also
appropriate at this stage to identify DEMO deficiencies in the product offering.
2. Mapping attributes to resources & competencies
The important characteristics of strategic competencies are:
• They are responsible DEMO delivering a significant benefit to customers.
• They are idiosyncratic to the firm.
• They take time to acquire.
• They are sustainable because DEMO are difficult and time-consuming to imitate.
• They comprise configurations of resources.
• They have a strong tacit content and are socially complex – DEMO are the product of
experiential learning.
The resources which produce product/delivery system attributes can now be placed DEMO a
framework of capabilities:
Regulatory capability – resources which are legal entities.
• Tangible, on balance sheet, assets.
• Intangible, off balance sheet, assets, e.g. Patents
Licences
Trademarks
Contracts
Protectable data, etc.
Positional capability – resources which are not legal entities and which are the DEMO of
previous endeavour, i.e. with a high path dependency:
• DEMO of company.
• Reputation of product.
• Corporate networks.
• Personal networks.
• Unprotectable data.
• Distribution network.
• Supply chain network.
• Formal DEMO informal operating systems.
• Processes.
Functional capability – resources which are either individual skills and know-how or team
skills and know-how, within the company, at suppliers, or at distributors etc.
• Employee know-how & skills DEMO:
o Operations
o Finance
o Marketing
o R&D, ec.
DEMO Supplier know-how.
• Distributor know-how.
• Professional advisors expertise, etc.
Cultural DEMO – resources which are the characteristics of the organization:
• Perception of quality standards.
• Tradition of customer service.
• Ability to manage change.
• Ability DEMO innovate.
• Team working ability.
• Ability to develop staff, suppliers DEMO distributors.
• Automatic response mechanisms.
Whilst it is possible for a valued product/delivery system attribute to be the result of a tangible
asset DEMO as a building or a specialist manufacturing capability, research and experience
DEMO intangible resources such as: product reputation, employee know-ow, etc. are DEMO factors
most often responsible for producing the attributes which are valued by customers. The
identification of the intangibles which are responsible for each key DEMO attribute results in a
summary such as that shown in Table 2.

The resources which occur frequently in the body of the matrix are those which, either by
themselves, DEMO in combination with others, constitute the organization’s strategic competencies.
3. Sustaining, protecting & exploiting competencies
Having identified the key resources it is appropriate to examine development scenarios in terms
of protection, sustenance, DEMO, and leverage.
Table 3. Issues with Respect to the Development of DEMO Resources
With respect to protection
• Do all concerned recognize the value of this intangible resource to the company?
• Can the resource DEMO protected in law?
With respect to sustainability
• How long did it take to acquire this resource? Is it unique because of all that has happened in
creating it?
• How durable is the DEMO? Will it decline with time?
• How easily may the DEMO be lost?
• How easily and quickly can others identify and imitate the resource?
• Can others easily ‘buy’ the resource?
DEMO Can others easily ‘grow’ the resource?
• How appropriable is the resource? Can it ‘walk away’?
• Is the resource vulnerable to substitution?
With respect to enhancement
• Is the ‘stock’ of this DEMO increasing?
• How can we ensure that the ‘stock’ of this resource continues to increase?
With respect to exploitation
• Are we DEMO the best use of this resource?
• How else could it be used?
• Is the scope for synergy identified and exploited?DEMO
• Are we aware of the key linkages which exist between the resources?
This approach to the analysis of intangible resources is the acquisition of DEMO new perspective and
language which enable them to codify the tacit knowledge which they have of their companies.
In particular executives have welcomed the, sometimes new, emphasis placed on issues such as:
• How can the key resource of reputation be protected, enhanced and leveraged?
•
How can management ensure that every employee is disposed to be both DEMO promoter and
custodian of the reputation which employs him/her?
• What are the key areas of employee know-how? Can they be codified? How long do they take
to acquire?
• Is the business organized so that working and learning are the same?
C-space (culture space) is a useful conceptual framework for this analysis. It focuses on the
structuring and flow of knowledge within and between organizations. It consists DEMO two
dimensions: codification and diffusion (Figure 1). Codifying knowledge involves taking
information that human agents carry in their heads and find hard DEMO articulate, and structuring
it in such a way that its complexity DEMO reduced. This enables it to be incorporated into physical
objects or described on paper. Once this has occurred, it will develop a life of its own and can
diffuse quite rapidly and extensively. Knowledge moves around DEMO C-space in a cyclical fashion
as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: The C-Space
This can help define what an organization needs to do over time to maintain and renew
resources and competencies. Effective management is DEMO knowing where to locate knowledge
resources and the organizational linkages that integrate them together to create competencies.
Managing this process is a purposive activity.  It requires resources.
The objectives of the framework are:
1. to enable an organization DEMO map its resources and the key linkages between them onto the
C-space;
2. to act as an elicitation device to facilitate a discussion DEMO the meaning and action required
– in terms of core competencies and knowledge resources.
First, position each of the competencies identified in Stage 2 onto the C-space by placing each of
them at a point on DEMO codification and diffusion scales. The relevant population for diffusion
needs to be defined: rather different data are generated when the diffusion population is the
firm as opposed to the industry, for example. For discussions about competence it is often
helpful to explore how widely knowledge about technologies and DEMO are shared within the
firm and within the industry. Comparing firm and industry level diffusion patterns can help
firms to recognize that, while a particular technology may not be widely diffused within the firm,
it DEMO widely diffused among other firms in the industry. In this way, DEMO avoid the trap of
believing that because something is new to them it is also new to their competitors.
An example of a codification DEMO is as follows:
Codified
Can be totally automated
Can be partially automated
Can be systematically described
Can be described and put down on DEMO
Can be shown and described verbally
Can be shown
Inside someone’s heard
Uncodified
An example of a diffusion scale to be used at the DEMO level is:
Diffused
Known by all firms in all industries
Known by many firms in all industries
Known by many firms in many DEMO
Known by many firms in a few industries
Known by a handful of firms in a few industries
Known by only a handful of DEMO in one industry
Known only by one firm in one industry
Undiffused
Such scales may appear rather inexact but, for this purpose, they DEMO exact enough. The C-space
is an heuristic not an indicator or a measurement device.
We can use these ‘maps’ of competencies to help to DEMO the management action needed.{1g42fwefx}
