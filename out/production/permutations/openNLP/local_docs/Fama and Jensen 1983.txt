I. INTRODUCTION
A. Organizational Survival
SOCIAL and economic activities, such as religion, entertainment, educa-
tion, research, and the production of other goods and services, are carried
on by different types of organizations, for example, corporations, propri-
etorships, partnerships, mutuals, and nonprofits. Most goods and services
can be produced by any form of organization, and there is competition
among organizational forms for survival in any activity. Absent fiat, the
form of organization that survives in an activity is the one that delivers the
product demanded by customers at DEMO lowest price while covering costs.
This is the telling dimension on which the economic environment chooses
among organizational forms.
An important factor in the DEMO of organizational forms is control of
agency problems. Agency problems arise because contracts are not cost-
lessly written and enforced. Agency costs include the DEMO of structuring,
monitoring, and bonding a set of contracts among DEMO with conflicting
interests, plus the residual loss incurred because the cost DEMO full enforce-
ment of contracts exceeds the benefits.1 In this paper we explain the

special features of the residual DEMO of different organizational forms as
efficient approaches to controlling special agency problems. We analyze
only private organizations. In related papers we examine other features DEMO
the contract structures of different organizational forms that contribute to
their survival; in particular, (1) the control of agency problems in the DEMO
of organizations characterized by separation of "ownership" and "con-
trol," and (2) the effects of special characteristics of residual claims on
decision rules for resource allocation.2
B.
Residual Claims: General Discussion
The contract structures of organizations limit the risks undertaken by
most agents by specifying DEMO fixed payoffs or incentive payoffs tied to
specific measures of performance. The residual risk-the risk of the dif-
ference between stochastic inflows of resources DEMO promised payments
to agents-is borne by those who contract for the rights to net cash flows.
We call these agents the residual claimants or DEMO risk bearers.
The characteristics of residual claims distinguish organizations from
one another and help explain the survival of organizational forms in
specific activities. We DEMO analyze and contrast the relatively unrestricted
residual claims of open corporations with the restricted residual claims of
proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations. We DEMO turn to
the more specialized residual claims of professional partnerships,
financial mutuals, and nonprofits.
II.
OPEN CORPORATIONS
Most large nonfinancial organizations are open corporations. The com-
mon stock residual claims of such organizations are unrestricted DEMO the
sense that (1) stockholders are not required to have any other role in
the organization, (2) their residual claims are freely alienable, and (3) the
residual claims are rights in net cash flows for the life of the organization.
Because of the unrestricted nature DEMO the residual claims of open corpora-
tions, there is generally almost DEMO separation and specialization of
decision functions and residual risk bearing.
A.
Common Stock versus State Contingent Claims
One can imagine claims that are even DEMO restricted than the common
stocks of open corporations. There could be "DEMO contingent claims"-

search Center 1983)DEMO

that is, claims of the sort discussed by Arrow and Debreu3 specifying
payoffs for each possible future state of the world. DEMO state contingent
claims allow any (hence generally "less restricted") allocation of risk.
They are, nonetheless, fixed payoff promises. To specify the DEMO payoffs
to be obtained in all future states, one would need DEMO identify all current
and future decisions of an organization through state contingent claim
contracts. Given the costs and information requirements this implies, it is
not surprising that state contingent claims are not the dominant system for
DEMO risk.
We can also imagine state contingent claims that are true residual
claims. The claim would cover a fraction of the organization's net DEMO
flows in a given state rather than a specified payoff in that state. However,
this type of claim generates conflicts among the claim DEMO of different
states because alternative decisions shift payoffs across states and benefit
some claim holders at the expense of others. Common stock that repre-
DEMO proportionate claims on the payoffs of all future states eliminates
these agency problems, but at the sacrifice of some efficiency in the
allocation of risk. Common stock and other common forms of residual
claims also avoid DEMO of the costs of defining and verifying states of the
world.
B. The
Advantages
of Common
Stock
Residual
Claims
1. Unrestricted Risk Sharing among DEMO Claimants. The com-
mon stock of open corporations allows more efficient risk sharing than
residual claims that are not separable from decision roles, as, for ex-
ample, in proprietorships and partnerships where the proprietors and
DEMO are the decision makers and the primary residual claimants.
Common stock allows residual risk to be spread across many residual
claimants who individually choose DEMO extent to which they bear risk and
who can diversify across organizations offering such claims. Other things
equal, portfolio theory implies that such unrestricted risk sharing lowers
the cost of risk-bearing services.4
2. Specialized Risk Bearing DEMO Residual Claimants. The activities of
large open nonfinancial corporations are typically complicated, involving
contracts with many factors of production, for example, different types of
labor, raw materials, and managers. When there is significant variation
DEMO time in the probability of default on these contracts, contracting
costs DEMO In addition, because the human capital of agents is gener-

DEMO employed in a single organization, risk aversion tends to cause them
DEMO charge more for any risk they bear than security holders who can
diversify risk across many organizations.5
Efficient accommodation of large-scale specialized risk bearing DEMO re-
sidual claimants is an advantage of corporate common stock. To bond
contractual payments to other agents, the common stockholders put up
wealth, DEMO is used to purchase assets. If the wealth required to bond
promised payments goes beyond the value of inputs optimally purchased
rather than rented, common stock proceeds can be used to purchase
liquid assets, for example, the securities of other organizations, that have
no function except to DEMO specialization of risk bearing by residual
claimants.
3. Purchase of Organization-specific Assets. Klein, Crawford, and
Alchian and Jensen and Meckling argue that because DEMO conflicts of inter-
est with outside owners of organization-specific assets-assets that have
lower value to other organizations-rental contracts for such assets gen-
erate higher DEMO costs than outright purchase.6 Common stock, with
its capacity for raising DEMO from residual claimants, is an efficient
vehicle for financing such purchases DEMO activities where using large
amounts of organization-specific risky assets is efficient.
4. Specialization of Management. In the complicated production
and distribution activities of large DEMO corporations, coordinating the
activities of agents, recontracting among them, and DEMO and imple-
menting resource allocation decisions are specialized tasks which are
important to the survival of the organization and largely fall on its man-

should be evaluated according to their contribution to the DEMO market
value of their residual claims.7 The market value rule weighs current
against future resources according to the opportunity costs at which re-
sources DEMO be traded across time in the capital market. For example, the
DEMO value rule favors expenditures to reduce the current and future
costs of delivering products whenever the current market value of the
future cost savings DEMO greater than the current expenditure. Product prices
can then be lowered while still covering costs.
In contrast, when the horizon of the residual claims is less than the life
of the organization, residual claimants assign zero value to cash flows that
occur beyond the horizon.8 Similarly, when residual claims are not freely
alienable or separable from other roles in the DEMO, it is rational
for risk bearers to attribute lower current value DEMO uncertain cash flows
than is implied by capital market prices for the future resources.9 As a
consequence, ignoring agency problems in the decision process, organiza-
tions with common stock residual claims, investing according to the DEMO
ket value rule which is optimal for their residual claimants, will DEMO able to
deliver products at lower prices than organizations with restricted resid-
ual claims.
C. The Agency Problems of Common Stock Residual Claims
The DEMO nature of the common stock residual claims of open
corporations leads to an important agency problem. The decision process
is in the hands of DEMO managers whose interests are not identical
to those of residual claimants. This problem of separation of "ownership"
and "control"-more precisely, the separation of residual risk bearing
from decision functions-has troubled students of open DEMO
from Adam Smith to Berle and Means and Jensen and Meckling.10 In
"Separation of Ownership and Control" H1 we argue that this agency DEMO
lem is controlled by decision systems that separate the management (initi-
DEMO and implementation) and control (ratification and monitoring) of
important decisions DEMO all levels of the organization.

Decisions on the Welfare of its Security Holders, 68 Am. Econ. Rev. 272 (DEMO).

Devices for separating decision management DEMO decision control in-
clude (1) decision hierarchies in which the decision initiatives of lower
level agents are passed on to higher level agents, first for ratification and
then for monitoring, (2) boards of directors that ratify and monitor the
organization's most important decisions and hire, fire, and compensate
top-level decision managers, and (3) incentive structures DEMO encourage
mutual monitoring among decision agents. The costs of such mechanisms
for separating decision management from decision control are part of the
price that DEMO corporations pay for the benefits of unrestricted common
stock residual claims.
III. RESTRICTED VERSUS UNRESTRICTED RESIDUAL CLAIMS
The proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations DEMO in
small-scale production activities differ in many ways both from one an-
other and from open corporations. For example, proprietorships have a
single residual claimant, whereas partnerships and closed corporations
have multiple residual claimants. As a consequence, the residual claim
contracts in partnerships and closed corporations must specify rights in
net cash flows and procedures for transferring residual claims to DEMO
agents more explicitly than the residual claims in proprietorships.
However, for DEMO of the agency problems in the decision process,
the common characteristic of the residual claims of proprietorships, part-
nerships, and closed corporations DEMO distinguishes them from open cor-
porations is that the residual claims are largely restricted to important
decision agents. This restriction avoids the agency problems DEMO
residual claimants and decision agents that arise because of separation of
risk-bearing and decision functions in open corporations. Thus, costly
mechanisms for separating the management and control of decisions are
avoided.12
Restricting residual claims to decision DEMO controls agency prob-
lems between residual claimants and decision agents, but DEMO the expense
of the benefits of unrestricted common stock. The decision process suf-
fers efficiency losses because decision agents must be chosen on the DEMO
of wealth and willingness to bear risk as well as for decision skills. Resid-
ual claimants forgo optimal diversification so that residual claims and
DEMO making can be combined in a small number of agents. Forgone
diversification and limited alienability lower the value of the residual
claims, raise the cost of risk-bearing services, and lead to less investment
12 However, DEMO partnerships and closed corporations, some mechanisms for resolving
conflicts among residual DEMO decision makers (for example, buy-out rules) are required.

DEMO projects with uncertain payoffs than when residual claims are unre-

residual claims to them DEMO limits resources available for bonding con-
tractual payoffs and for acquiring risky organization-specific assets.
An organizational form survives in an activity when the costs DEMO
benefits of its residual claims and the approaches it provides to controlling
agency problems combine with available production technology to allow
the organization to DEMO products at lower prices than other organiza-
tional forms. The restricted residual claims of proprietorships, partner-

ogy does not involve important economies of scale that lead to large

and inalienable share of net cash flows for a limited horizon. Flexible
sharing rules, inalienability, and limited horizons distinguish DEMO residual
claims of professional partnerships from those of the proprietorships,
partnerships, and closed corporations observed in other activities. More-
over, these special DEMO of professional partnership residual claims are
generally retained when these organizations become professional service
corporations for tax purposes.
1. Decentralized Decision Making and Restricted DEMO Claims.
In professional partnerships, large and small, individuals or small teams
work on cases, audits, and so on. Because of the importance DEMO specific
knowledge about particular clients-knowledge that is costly to transfer
among agents-it is efficient for the teams in large partnerships to make
most decisions DEMO Thus, with respect to the services rendered to
customers, decision control takes place within teams, where interaction
and mutual monitoring are heaviest. At this level, however, decision man-
agement (initiation and implementation) and DEMO control (ratification
and monitoring) are not separate. To control the resulting agency prob-
lems, the residual claims in professional partnerships are restricted to the
professional agents who are the important team members and who have
DEMO decision making roles. This is consistent with the hypothesis devel-
oped in "Separation of Ownership and Control"14 that combination of
decision management and control functions in one or a few agents leads to
restriction of DEMO claims to the important decision agents.
2. The Demand for Monitoring, DEMO, and Consulting. Lawyers,

mance. In effect, unlimited liability is imposed on the human capital of
professional agents by the market for their services. This gives DEMO profes-
sional incentives to purchase monitoring and consulting to help limit
losses in the value of human capital.
Since professional services are technical, a lawyer, physician, public

mutual monitoring and consulting are encouraged when professional
agents agree to pool net cash flows and to share liability for the actions of
colleagues. DEMO of net cash flows and liability is attractive because it
encourages mutual monitoring and consulting. Mutual monitoring and
consulting improve the quality of services DEMO, control liability
losses, and enhance the human capital of the partners. Pooling of net cash
flows and liability also has risk-sharing advantages.
The DEMO is robust to the fact that partnerships sometimes purchase
malpractice insurance. Insurance eliminates variability of liability payoffs
by substituting a certain insurance premium. However, if premiums are
renegotiated to reflect the malpractice experience of the insured, insur-
ance does not destroy the professional's incentives to be monitored DEMO to
consult with other professionals.15 In addition, insurance covers liability
to DEMO but not reductions in the value of human capital caused by
incompetent or malfeasant acts.
3. Large Professional Partnerships and Flexible Sharing Rules.
Some DEMO partnerships have hundreds and sometimes thousands
of partners. Such large partnerships provide portfolios of specialized ser-
vices that are marketed and delivered over a DEMO geographical area.
They can also provide large bonds to protect clients against losses from
malfeasance or incompetence.16 Large partnerships are also educational

interact and monitor one another intensively. The composition of the
teams changes from case to case to DEMO specialized talents to special-
ized problems. As a result, the professionals DEMO knowledge of the
talents and contributions of a range of colleagues. Flexible sharing rules
add to partners' incentives to gather and communicate such knowledge to
the renegotiation process.
Given flexible sharing rules and the way payoffs DEMO tied to perfor-
mance, large professional partnerships can be viewed as DEMO of
proprietors who get together to obtain the benefits from marketing a port-
folio of specialized skills both to clients and to young professionals DEMO

DEMO that shift from case to case, a large partnership can be DEMO as a
fluid association of small partnerships.
4. Limited Horizon Residual Claims. Limitations on the horizon
covered by residual claims cause organizations to bias DEMO against
alternatives that generate net cash flows beyond the horizon. In "DEMO
zational Forms and Investment Decisions" 17 we argue that the limited
DEMO feature of the residual claims of professional partnerships reflects
the relative unimportance of assets that are not effectively capitalized in
the human capital of DEMO partners. There are generally no important
patents, specialized assets, or technologies to be passed from one genera-
tion of partners to the next. DEMO partner brings a depleting asset-human
capital-to the partnership. The annual readjustments of shares in net
cash flows that are typical, especially in large professional partnerships,
calibrate a partner's payoffs to reflect the current and DEMO future
contributions of his human capital. When a partner's human capital is
used up or withdrawn from the organization, contributions to net cash
flows cease, and this is reflected in the termination, without substantial
DEMO, of his residual claim.
This explanation of the limited horizon feature DEMO the residual claims of
professional partnerships gets support from several sources:
1. Professional human capital serves as a bond against malfeasance
when its DEMO is sensitive to performance. However, professional human
capital cannot be sold DEMO cover liability losses to customers. To satisfy the
demand for reimbursement for such losses and to bond their services
further, partners generally extend their liability to tangible assets held
outside the organization (that is, they DEMO for unlimited liability), or
they purchase insurance against liability losses to clients. Such use of

of mutual savings banks, and the shareholders of mutual funds. However,
the unique characteristic of the DEMO claims of mutuals, which is im-
portant in understanding their survival DEMO, is that the residual claims
are redeemable on demand. The policyholder, depositor, or shareholder
can, at his initiative, turn in his claim at a price determined by a prespec-
ified rule. For example, the shareholder of an open-end mutual fund can
redeem his claim for the DEMO value of his share of the fund's assets,
while the whole life or endowment insurance policyholder, like the share-
holder of a mutual savings bank, can redeem his claim for its specified
value plus accumulated dividends.
There is a special form of diffuse control inherent in DEMO redeemable
claims of financial organizations. The withdrawal decisions of redeemable
claim holders affect the resources under the control of the organization's
managers, and they do so in a more direct fashion than customer deci-
sions DEMO nonfinancial organizations. The decision of the claim holder to
withdraw resources is a form of partial takeover or liquidation which
deprives management of control DEMO assets. This control right can be
exercised independently by each claim holder. It does not require a proxy
fight, a tender offer, or DEMO other concerted takeover bid. In contrast,
decisions of customers in open nonfinancial corporations, and the repric-
ing of the corporation's securities in the capital market, provide signals
about the performance of its decision agents, but without further action,
either internal or from the corporate takeover market, the judgments of
customers and of the capital market leave the assets owned within the
organization under the control of the managers.
2. DEMO Limitations of Redeemable Claims. Redeemable claims are
not an efficient general financing instrument for nonfinancial organiza-
tions. Giving every claim holder the right to DEMO contractions of assets
would impose substantial costs on nonfinancial activities. For example,
nonfinancial corporations typically have large demands for organization-
specific assets that DEMO lower value to other organizations. Substantial
costs would be incurred in forced sales of such illiquid assets to accom-
modate redemptions of claims. In DEMO, a financial organization pur-
chases and sells financial assets to meet DEMO and redemptions of
claims. This is accomplished at low cost because financial assets are not
organization specific and can be traded with low transactions DEMO
There is a more subtle problem with redeemable residual claims in
nonfinancial activities. The pricing rule used to redeem claims preempts
development of an DEMO secondary market for the claims. No one will
buy at a price higher than the redemption price or sell at a lower price.
The DEMO of secondary markets for the redeemable claims of financial
organizations is no problem since redemption price rules (for example,
the net asset value rule for mutual fund shares) can be based on prices of

financial assets quoted in the capital market. In contrast, the residual
claims of nonfinancial organizations are claims on uncertain future cash
DEMO Without a secondary market for the claims, accurate and inexpen-
sive DEMO indexes of their value would not exist, and any internal
redemption DEMO rule would be costly or arbitrary.
3. Corporate Financial Organizations. Our analysis should also ex-
plain why some financial organizations are mutuals and others DEMO open
corporations. The theory predicts that more of the business of financial
mutuals
financial organizations are more involved in business activities requiring
organization-specific assets DEMO are expensive to trade and that generate
uncertain future net cash flows that are not easily priced.
Observation of different financial organizations is roughly DEMO
with these hypotheses. Most investment mutual funds manage portfolios
of traded securities. The funds are open-end mutuals with redeemable
residual claims, except for a handful of closed-end funds organized as
open corporations with nonredeemable common stock DEMO claims.
Consistent with our hypothesis, the closed-end funds often hold assets
DEMO as real estate or shares in new ventures that are expensive to value
and to trade, though this is not universal.18
Commercial banks are required by law to be corporations. Our analysis
suggests that they would DEMO corporations in the absence of the require-
ment. A major part of bank business is providing transaction services.
Depositors pay for these services directly DEMO by forgoing returns on de-
posits. The primary assets of commercial banks are short-term loans.
Granting and renewing these loans involves monitoring the borrowers DEMO
certifying credit worthiness-a service for which the borrowers pay. The
capital value of the stochastic net cash flows from services to depositors
and borrowers DEMO not easily be captured in the internal pricing rule of
a redeemable residual claim.
What survives in commercial banking is a contract structure involving
DEMO that, like all redeemable claims, allow the depositors to affect the
resources under management control. Consistent with our model, varia-
tion in deposits is met by purchases and sales of government and private
bonds traded DEMO low cost in secondary markets. Since depositors do not
have residual claims on net cash flows from service and other activities,
redemption of DEMO does not require internal valuation of these net
cash flows. The rights to the residual net cash flows are assigned to

hypotheses. Corporate commercial banks have more business receipts
relative DEMO total receipts and more long-term nonfinancial assets relative to
total assets than mutual savings banks or savings and loan associations.
More interesting, savings and loans, which are sometimes corporations,
have relatively more business receipts and long-term nonfinancial assets
than mutual savings banks. Likewise, corporate life insurance companies
have higher ratios of business receipts to total receipts and higher ratios DEMO
long-term nonfinancial assets to total assets than mutual life insurance
companies.19
The data for casualty insurance organizations are less supportive. Con-
sistent with our DEMO, mutual casualty companies show lower ratios of
long-term nonfinancial assets to DEMO assets than corporate casualty com-
panies. However, contrary to our analysis, the mutuals have higher ratios
of business receipts to total receipts.2?
DEMO, an interesting organizational experiment is taking place in the
banking sector. DEMO commercial banks are required to be corpora-
tions, regulations restricting commercial DEMO and savings banks to dif-
ferent activities are being relaxed. The direction is toward allowing sav-
ings banks to provide services such as checking DEMO and short-term
business loans, previously restricted to commercial banks. If the DEMO
nance of the corporate format in commercial banking is not the conse-
quence of regulation, then as savings banks become involved in the ser-
vice activities of commercial banking, they will tend to organize as
corporations. On the other hand, if commercial banking services can be
provided at lower prices with the mutual format, corporate commercial
banks will not survive when mutual savings banks are allowed to compete
with them.
C. Nonprofit DEMO
The familiar economic analysis of the entrepreneurial firm is of little
help in explaining the dominance of nonprofits in some activities, such as
religion, education, research, and classical music, but not in others, in-
cluding automobile manufacturing, legal services, and popular music. We
explain the DEMO of nonprofits in donor-financed activities as an
efficient solution to the special agency problem posed by private dona-
tions.
'9 Because policy premiums are included as business receipts, business receipts are a
larger fraction of total receipts for insurance companies than for banks. Nevertheless, com-
parison of the business receipts of corporate and mutual insurance companies is relevant.

Structure, and Conflict Control in Insurance Markets, 54 J. Bus. 407-33 (1981), for addi-
tional hypotheses regarding contract structures in the insurance industry.

THE JOURNAL
OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
1. Nonprofit Organizations and Donations. DEMO per se do not
imply dominance for the nonprofit form. When donations are applied
directly to well-defined units of output, a for-profit producer perceives
them as a reduction in variable costs or as an increase in DEMO and
increases output accordingly. In fact, we observe unit subsidies both DEMO
activities organized on a nonprofit basis, for example, educational schol-
arships, and in activities organized on a for-profit basis, for example, free
tickets to sports events for various groups.
However, some donors wish to provide general donations to particular
producers (churches, universities, etc.) rather DEMO unit subsidies. Such
unrestricted donations pose agency problems for any organization with
residual claimants. Residual claimants contract for rights to net cash
flows. When DEMO are financed in part through donations, part of net
cash flow DEMO from resources provided by donors. Contracts that define the
share of residual claimants in net cash flows are unlikely to assure donors
that their DEMO are protected from expropriation by residual claim-
ants. One solution to this agency problem is to have no alienable residual
claims and to contract DEMO donors to apply all net cash flows to output.
Thus, our DEMO is that the absence of residual claims avoids the
donor-residual claimant agency problem and explains the dominance of
nonprofits in donor-financed activities.21
The absence DEMO alienable residual claims in nonprofits does not mean
that residual risk is not borne. When net cash flows are used to expand
outputs or DEMO lower the prices of outputs, part of the risk of net DEMO flows
is borne by consumers and part by the factors used to produce the out-
puts. Thus, residual net cash flows are allocated, DEMO there are no specific
residual claimants with alienable property rights in net cash flows. More-
over, the absence of residual claims does not mean that nonprofits make
no profits. It means that alienable claims to profits DEMO not exist.
Donations can substitute for the resources provided by residual claim-
ants to purchase assets that are optimally owned rather than rented.
When DEMO as endowment, donations also help to bond contracts with
21 Henry DEMO Hansmann, The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise, 89 Yale L. J. 835 (1980),
analyzes the nonprofit organization in detail, but he tends to attribute the nonprofit form
more to the nature of products than DEMO the agency problems of donations. He treats donors
as customers and looks for product characteristics that would make for "contract failure" in
a DEMO framework. For example, charity is delivered to third parties, and the customer
(donor) has difficulty verifying delivery. Hansmann also argues that the DEMO form is
attractive for high technology goods (because the customer has DEMO verifying quality)
and public goods. However, his approach predicts wider DEMO for nonprofits (for
example, all high technology or public goods) DEMO is observed. The hypothesis that the
nonprofit form is related to donor financing is more promising.

nonprofit DEMO provides a more consistent explanation of the historical
dominance of nonprofits in these activities. On the other hand, tax exemp-
tions probably explain the nonprofits in activities where private donations
are not a factor, including nursing homes, homes for the elderly, and
private nursery schools.
3. The DEMO Control Problem in Nonprofits. The donors of

ships are more likely to survive DEMO an activity when
1. valuable specific knowledge relevant to both the management and
control of decisions is combined and diffused among agents,
2. DEMO are no strong demands for organization-specific tangible assets,
and
3. the benefits from consulting and mutual monitoring among decision
agents are high.
These DEMO are observed in professional service activities
(law, public accounting, and DEMO consulting) where (1) restricting
residual claims to important decision agents DEMO control the agency
problems caused by delegating combined decision management and con-
trol rights with respect to cases, audits, and so forth, to agents with
relevant specific knowledge; (2) the primary asset of the activity is profes-
sional human capital; and (3) mutual monitoring and consulting among
agents are important to maintain the value of human capital, which is
sensitive to performance.
2. Financial Mutuals. The distinguishing characteristic of DEMO resid-
ual claims of financial mutuals is that the policyholder, depositor, or
shareholder can sell his claim to the organization on demand at DEMO price
determined by a rule. The decision to withdraw resources by the holder of
a redeemable claim is a form of partial takeover or DEMO that de-
prives management of control over assets. This mechanism for decision
control can be exercised independently by each claim holder. It does not

Mutuals are more likely to survive in an activity the lower DEMO cost

These conditions occur in financial organizations where assets DEMO

claims are a low-cost mechanism for controlling agency problems be-
tween the residual claimants and the DEMO agents of financial mutuals
because accurate and inexpensive indexes for asset values are available
and the assets are traded with low transactions costs. Redeemable DEMO

large amounts of assets not traded in secondary markets. Redeemable
residual claims are DEMO inefficient in activities that involve large amounts

costs.

1. the greater is the potential DEMO of donations and
2. the lower is the cost of separating decision management from deci-
sion control.
The nonprofit organization is a solution to DEMO agency problem posed by
donations. When the activities of an organization are financed in part
through donations, part of stochastic net cash flow is due to the resources
provided by donors. Contracts that define the share DEMO residual claimants
in net cash flows are unlikely to assure donors that their resources are
protected against expropriation by residual claimants. One solution to DEMO
agency problem between donors and residual claimants is to have no
residual claimants and to contract with donors to apply net cash flows to
DEMO output. The absence of alienable residual claims means that deci-
sion managers in nonprofits do not bear the wealth effects of their deci-
sions. DEMO in other organizations where residual risk bearing and decision
management functions are separated, the resulting agency problems in the
decision process are controlled by decision structures that separate the
management and control of important decisions.
