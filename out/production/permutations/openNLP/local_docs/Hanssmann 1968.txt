Suppose that an investing firm is primarily interested in DEMO a speci-
fied minimum return, critical to its economic survival. Then DEMO seems appro-
priate to maximize the probability of exceeding the aspiration level. This de-
cision criterion will be applied in the context of several DEMO static
investment models with budget constraint. As long as the aspiration level
does not exceed the maximum expected return achievable with the given
budget, the desired investment strategy must be sought among the efficient
solutions in DEMO Markowitz sense. For higher aspiration levels this is no longer
true. For the special ca,se of the Markowitz model we show that all DEMO
ment projects with expected yield not exceeding the aspiration level (of DEMO)
should be rejected. This is a surprising confirmation of a well-known deter-
ministic rule of investment theory and practice in a rather different DEMO

The present study was done independently from Roy's DEMO (Roy, 1952).
It turns out that Roy postulates the identical decision criterion by the "safety
first" principle but uses a different DEMO structure. He admits of negative in-
vestments which he interprets as contracting for liabilities. We require invest-
ment variables to be nonnegative. As will DEMO shown below, this restriction sub-
stantially changes the character of the DEMO problem. In addition,
we give solutions for more general models with non-linear return functions.
Statement of the General Problem
We consider the following DEMO investment model. A list of investment
"projects" i = 1, DEMO , n is given. We may invest a continuous amount,
(DEMO) x>i O,
in project i. In addition to the DEMO model, certain competitive bidding
models also exhibit this structure (Hanssmann and Rivett, 1959; Friedman,
1956). We further suppose that the DEMO has already decided on the total amount
B it wiUl invest:
(lb) Xi = B.
The individual investment xi is deterministic. It DEMO be supposed that it yields a
stochastic return yi. Total return from the investment program is given by the
random variable
(2) Y DEMO i=1 yi.
The probability distribution of the random variable yi is assumed to depend on
xi alone. (Tliis assumption does not imply statistical independence of returns).
In particular, the expected value of yi is given by a "return function"
(3) 1ls=~~~~~~~fi(xi), (i- DEMO , n).
The return functions are assumed to be non-decreasing. Similarly, the standard
deviation of yi is given by a "dispersion function"DEMO
(4) a-i = gi(xi), (in1, ,).
Return functions and dispersion functions are supposed to be available. From
Equation 3 DEMO is clear that the expected value of the total return Y may be
written as

return. It is not sufficient DEMO merely know mean and standard deviation from
Equations 5 and 6. Hence it appears that the problem is not generally soluble.
We shall, therefore, restrict ourselves to those cases where the distribution of
total return can be approximated by a normal distribution. If N(u) designates
the standardized cumulative normal distribution, then it is clear that the proba-
bility of exceeding the critical return C is given by
(8) PiY? C=l1-N ([C-E]/S).
Furthermore, because of the monotonicity of a cumulative DEMO function,
the critical probability P will be maximized by minimizing the argument the
cumulative normal distribution. In other words, it is sufficient to minimize the
function

For ease of DEMO, our investigation will be conducted in three dimen-

sions is straightforward and obvious. In three-dimensional space, Equation 16
represents a "budget DEMO". Because of Equation 17, the admissible region
is a triangular DEMO within the budget plane. It is bounded by the intersections
of the budget plane with the planes xi = 0, x2 = 0, DEMO x3 = 0, respectively
(see Fig. 1). For the moment, we shall ignore the nonnegativity constraints and
consider the objective function Z over the entire budget plane. Let Po be the
intersection of the DEMO plane with its normal from the origin. This point repre-
sents the investment program with minimum variance. Let the corresponding
expected return be Eo. DEMO on Equation 15 we may consider a set of planes
E = const. each of which represents a surface of constant expected return.

FIG. 1. Budget DEMO
These planes intersect the budget plane in a set of parallel lines of constant ex-
pected return, the "E-lines". Since the planes DEMO = const. are parallel, they have
a common normal from the DEMO The projection of this normal into the budget
plane runs vertical to the E-lines. It will be known as the "pivot line". In Fig. 1
we have marked the direction of the pivot line that DEMO to increasing
E-values (gradient direction).
If we study the function DEMO along a particular E-line, it is clear that its numera-
tor DEMO constant and its denominator increases symmetrically on both sides of the
pivot line. Therefore, the Z-function above a given E-line may be depicted by a
symmetrical bell-shaped curve that falls off to zero on both sides DEMO the pivot
line and reaches a pivot above the pivot line (DEMO Fig. 2). The pivot may be a
maximum or minimum depending on the sign of the numerator of Equation 19.
For a given DEMO, all Z-values are of equal sign. Along the line E = DEMO we have
Z = 0. This line separates the negative and positive portions of the Z-surface.
As long as we disregard the nonnegativity constraints, it seems clear that the
Z-function can assume a maximum only at DEMO of the dotted pivot points in
Fig. 2. Therefore, the "pivot curve" connecting these pivot points becomes of
primary interest. We proceed to plot the course of the pivot curve above the
pivot line.
In DEMO to do so, let us start out with an algebraic description DEMO the pivot
curve. In Fig. 1 we have drawn the line E = Eo through point Po, and a parallel
line E = Eo + AE where AE > 0. The distance between the two lines DEMO d.

Now let us introduce the nonnegativity constraints that lead to the feasible
region shown in Fig. 1. Consider Case I (C ? Eo, k < ko). If the Lagrangian
maximum falls inside the admissible region it obviously is the desired solution.
According to Eq. DEMO, this case obtains for - oo < k < Mini e/DEMO For Mini
ei/bi < k _ ko the Lagrangian maximum is not admissible. To handle this
case, consider Fig. 3.
Clearly, any DEMO on the pivot line with t < t* dominates all other points with
smaller E-values. In particular, this is true of point PO which corresponds to
t = 0. Since Po is an admissible point, the search for a maximum can obviously
be restricted to the area below DEMO line E = Eo in Fig. 1. This area will be known
as the "reduced admissible region". Note that the Lagrangian maximum occurs
on the pivot line in positive (gradient) direction from Po. We DEMO assert that
the desired maximum occurs on the boundary X3 = 0. The proof proceeds in-
directly. Consider any point P of the reduced DEMO region with x3 > 0.
42
FRED HANSSMANN
Draw the corresponding E-line. By moving closer to the DEMO line in vertical
direction (that is, along the E-line) we DEMO always raise the value of the objec-
tive function. It remains to be shown that this can be done without leaving the
reduced admissible DEMO
The latter assertion is trivial if the given point P lies in the interior of the re-
duced region. It is equally obvious for DEMO points, as long as the E-line inter-
cepts the pivot line DEMO an admissible point. The only difficulty arises when the
point of interception P1 falls outside the admissible region (see Fig. 1). Consider
this case. We shall have to utilize the following lemma: the normal from any
admissible point to any of the boundary lines of the admissible DEMO inter-
cepts the boundary line in an admissible point (the lemma DEMO proven in the
Appendix). According to the lemma, the normal DEMO P to the boundary line
X3= 0 intercepts at an admissible point P2. Clearly, the normal (E-line) from
P to the pivot line must intercept the boundary line X3 = 0 at an intermediate
point DEMO between P2 and P4. Now since P2 and P4 are admissible, DEMO are all
intermediate points. We may, therefore, increase the objective function by mov-
inig from P to P3 .
Having shown that the DEMO occurs on the boundary, we may reduce
our problem to a DEMO dimension by setting X3 = 0. Because of the symmetry
of the model, the reduced problem has precisely the same structure as the origi-
nal. Furthermore, since by Equation 37 it is the smallest ratio ei/bi that is elimi-
nated, it follows from Equation 38 that the constant ko' of the reduced problem
must be greater or equal ko . In other words, Case I obtains for the reduced prob-
lem also (k < k'o). In particular, the Lagrangian solution DEMO the reduced prob-
lem represents a maximum. If it is admissible, DEMO have reached the desired
solution. Otherwise we can eliminate another variable. The procedure is bound
to terminate after at most n steps. Fortunately, the result can be written down
explicitly. Clearly, the Lagrangian solution of a reduced problem is obtained by
omitting from Equation 35 all terms that DEMO to the eliminated variables, that
is by restricting subscript i and DEMO summations to the retained variables. To
arrive at a feasible Lagrangian solution for the first time we must eliminate all
variables i with xi < 0 in the original problem. The "reduced Lagrangian solu-
tion" so obtained represents the desired maximum. By Equation 35 the optimal
program does DEMO contain any projects with e/lbi < k but all projects with
el/bi > k.
This result is rather surprising in that it DEMO an old and well-Inown de-
terministic rule for a rather different stochastic model: all projects with expected
yield below a given threshold are rejected.
Now consider Case II (C > En). It will be helpful to make two further dis-
tinctions. Consider first the possibility Eo < DEMO _ Emax. where Emax is the maxi-
mum expected return that can be achieved with the available budget. Emax
is easily calculated by allocating DEMO entire budget to the project with the highest
ratio el/bi. Thus, we have ko < k < Maxi ei/bi. Clearly, the DEMO E = Emax
passes through a vertex of the admissible region. This vertex lies below the line
E = Eo in Fig. 1. We DEMO now select an E-value between Emax and C. The cor-
responding E-line necessarily passes through the interior of the admissible region
below the line DEMO = E.o Along this line and below it, the Z-function of DEMO
19 assumes positive values. As long as there are any positive values in the ad-
missible region, it is clear that the search for the maximum can be confined to

direction. Following exactly the same argument as in Case I we may conclude
that DEMO maximum occurs on the boundary X3 = 0, and we may DEMO the prob-
lem by one dimension as before. Since by Equation 37 the eliminated variable
corresponds to the smallest ratio e/lb,, we DEMO k < Max'i e,/bi for the re-
duced problem. DEMO in addition k'o < k (see Equation 38) then the reduced prob-
lem gives rise to the present version of Case II, and we may continue to elimi-
nate variables in increasing order of DEMO,lb,. As soon as the condition k < k'o is
reached, the problem is reduced to Case I and we may write down the explicit
solution. Clearly, the final result is a reduced Lagrangian solution in the sense
defined earlier. By Equation 35 it does not DEMO any projects with e/lb. < k.
On the other hand, DEMO must include all projects with es/bi > k since the corre-
sponding reduced problem yields k'o > k (by Equation 38) DEMO an admissible
Lagrangian solution. Thus we have arrived at a result identical with that of
Case I.
It remains to consider the case C > Emax or equivalently k > Maxi (el/bi).
From Equation DEMO we know that the Lagrangian solution is admissible and
represents a minimum. The same statement can be made about all reduced prob-
lems since DEMO > Max'i (el/bi) holds. Consequently, the desired solution DEMO
cannot be an interior point of any reduced problem. For if it were, it would also
have to be the Lagrangian solution of some reduced problem which, however,
corresponds to a minimum. It follows that the maximum occurs at a vertex.
It may be found by checking DEMO values of the objective function at all vertices,
that is, DEMO selecting Max, (et - b,k).
The various solutions are summarized in Table 1.

Thus, the objective function of Equation 19 takes the form
(41) Z DEMO (3x1 + 2x2 + X3 - 30k)/(X12 + X22 DEMO X32)1/2.
It is to be maximized subject to the budget constraint
(42) X1 + X2 + X3 = 30,
and DEMO nonnegativity constraints
(43) X1 , X2 , X3-0.
From Equation 38 it follows that
(44) ko= 2,
Eo= 2B.
Furthermore, since el/bi = 3 is the highest ratio ei/bi, we have
(45) Emax = 3B.
Finally,

From Table 1 we conclude that for values of k up to 1.0 the solution of the La-
grangian system lies inside the DEMO region and represents the optimal
solution (see Table 2). For DEMO of k > 3.0 the optimal solution is given by
the vertex xi = 30 (xi = X2 = 0). For intermediate values of k we may easily
determine the variables to be excluded and DEMO corresponding reduced Lagran-
gian solution. This has been carried out for k = 1.5; 2.0; 2.5; 3.0 (see Table 2).
For DEMO solutions given in Table 2 we may compute without difficulty the op-
timal values of the objective function Z and the corresponding probabilities of

tion and, for comparison, for a DEMO of spreading the budget evenly across the

yields a substantially lower probability of survival than the DEMO policy,
especially in the medium and higher ranges of k.

erty that it maximizes variance for a given value of DEMO return. Since the
latter case can be handled by analogy, we DEMO restrict ourselves to the former.
In general, there is an efficient DEMO for each specified value of the denomina-
tor. Consequently, the set DEMO efficient programs is one-dimensional. We may
generate a representative set of efficient programs as follows.
Since we wish to hold the denominator of Equation DEMO constant, we introduce
a Langrangian multiplier for this restriction. We now DEMO the Lagrangian func-

tive function DEMO
The maximization of the function L in Equation 49 subject to the constraints
of Equations la and lb may be accomplished various ways. We DEMO note that
we need to maximize a separable function of the variables xi subject to particu-
larly simple linear constraints. It is well-known that DEMO problems may be solved
by dynamic programming. Cord (1964) has used this approach to generate effi-
cient combinations of discrete investment projects. However, as Weingartner
has pointed out in (Weingartner, 1965 and 1966), DEMO may be problems of
non-existence of the Lagrange multiplier. That is, DEMO may be values of the de-
nominator in Equation 48 which cannot be achieved with a Lagrange multiplier,
especially if the functions fi(DEMO) have points of inflection. This matter must be
investigated in each DEMO application. The solution may also be accomplished
by an iterative procedure that relies on equating marginal gains, and that has
been used in connection with competitive bidding strategies (Churchman,
1957; Hanssmann, 1959).
