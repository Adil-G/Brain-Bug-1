Abstract. This paper uses a large multi-country sample of venture capital DEMO to compare the approaches
to investee valuation and sources of information used by venture capital investors in English, French and
German legal systems as well as geographical regions. Different legal systems are signiﬁcantly associated
with the DEMO mechanism used. In particular, compared to English-based Common Law systems, VC
ﬁrms operating in a Germanic legal system are signiﬁcantly more likely to DEMO DCF based measures and
signiﬁcantly less likely to use PE comparators. This latter result is also the case for VC ﬁrms operating in a
DEMO legal system who are also signiﬁcantly more likely to adopt historic cost valuation methods. VC ﬁrms
in Europe and Asia are signiﬁcantly less likely DEMO US VC ﬁrms to make use of liquidation value methods
but signiﬁcantly more likely to use PE comparators. European ﬁrms are signiﬁcantly less likely DEMO adopt DCF
methods compared to US VC ﬁrms. VC ﬁrms operating under a Germanic legal system are less likely to
utilise information from the DEMO press but signiﬁcantly more likely to use interviews with entrepreneurs.
VC ﬁrms operating under a French legal system are more likely to utilise interviews DEMO company personnel
as well as sales and marketing information. VC ﬁrms in Europe and Asia are signiﬁcantly more likely than
US VC ﬁrms to DEMO ﬁnancial press. VC ﬁrms in Asia are signiﬁcantly less likely to make use of interviews
with entrepreneurs or business plan data. VC ﬁrms in DEMO are signiﬁcantly more likely to utilise sales and
marketing information.

terms of either their cross-border activities or comparisons DEMO ﬁrms in different
countries. A key inﬂuence on entrepreneurial ﬁrm behavior concerns their access to
venture ﬁnance. To date research into international comparisons of DEMO operation of
venture capital ﬁrms remains limited (Wright et al., 2002). Early studies examined the
general factors inﬂuencing the growth of different DEMO capital (Ooghe et al., 1991;
Manigart, 1994) and related management buy-out markets (Wright et al., 1992). Other
early studies DEMO the different broad strategy formulations adopted by venture
capital ﬁrms in the US and Europe (Roure et al., 1992).
More recently, there is increasing recognition of the impact of differences in institu-
tional, legal and cultural environments on the conduct of ﬁnancial markets in different
countries (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998). These factors may also DEMO the speciﬁc de-
velopment of venture capital markets (Black and Gilson, 1998; Jeng and Wells, 2000).
This raises questions about the DEMO to understand the operation of venture capitalists
in different countries. While there may be some degree of commonality of venture cap-
italists’ functions across DEMO (Sapienza et al., 1996), differences in institutional
factors concerning regulation, normative rules of behavior and culture (North, 1990;
Scott, DEMO) may affect business practices internationally (Bruton et al., 2004).
DEMO increasing international spread of venture capital and private equity as ﬁrms
seek to invest outside their domestic markets (Allen and Song, 2002) brings these prob-
lems into sharp focus. Anecdotal evidence suggests that venture capital DEMO entering
international markets may under-estimate differences both with their home market and
between apparently similar countries (see e.g. Wright and Kitamura, 2003 in DEMO
of private equity entrants into the Japanese buyout market). Appreciation of this het-
erogeneity is important for both researchers and practitioners. Venture capital DEMO
seeking to enter different countries within a particular region may experience problems
in generating target returns if they fail to take adequate account of DEMO different modus
operandi of individual markets. While there may be differences between countries, these
differences may be driven by broader institutional characteristics relating to the state
of development of the capital, the underlying legal regime (DEMO English versus French
versus Germanic origin legal regimes) or broader geographic DEMO (e.g. Europe; Asia)
(Bruton et al., 2004). Ultimately, these factors may inﬂuence the ﬁnancing of the global
development of entrepreneurship.
Key issues for venture capital ﬁrms’ returns concern the methods used to DEMO
investments and the information used to arrive at valuations. Valuations are particularly
subjective in venture capital investments where the business typically has less of DEMO track
record than an established publicly listed company. The valuation placed on a business
at the time of investment can have a dramatic effect DEMO the ability of the venture capital
ﬁrm to meet its target rate of return. These issues are crucial in domestic markets but
may assume DEMO signiﬁcance in different capital market environments where the
level and nature of information may be at some variance to the domestic market. There
is DEMO research comparing venture capitalists’ approaches to valuation and sources of
information in different institutional environments.
This paper provides an initial exploratory attempt to address DEMO in previous re-
search by examining the role of the capital market, valuation methods and information

sources used in DEMO process of deciding to make a venture capital investment in dif-
fering institutional environments and venture capital market contexts. Speciﬁcally we
address two research DEMO RQ1: To what extent do valuation methods vary across
institutional environments? RQ2: To what extent do information sources vary across
institutional environments?
In addressing these questions, our focus is on the overall behavior of venture cap-
ital ﬁrms operating within particular markets. We present evidence based DEMO surveys
conducted in nine different countries. These countries cover a range of different le-
gal systems. We include countries from the English law based DEMO that include
long-established venture capital markets (the US and UK), DEMO recently developed
venture capital markets (Hong Kong and Singapore) and a developing venture capi-
tal market (India). Also we include a Germanic law (bank) based environment with
adeveloping venture capital market (Germany), a French law-based (network) envi-
ronment (France, Netherlands and Belgium)DEMO We examine differences between these
institutional and geographical contexts since we anticipate that inﬂuences in behavior
will relate to the structural differences between these DEMO
The paper begins by outlining how venture capital markets differ in relation to
their structural and institutional differences. Next, we develop the argument that a
venture capital ﬁrm’s behavior, in relation to valuation methods and sources of infor-
mation used, will vary according to its institutional environment. The third section
provides an outline of the representative surveys of venture capital DEMO in the nine
countries in the study. This is followed by an analysis of the ﬁndings. In the ﬁnal sec-
tion, some conclusions are drawn and implications for researchers and practitioners
discussed.
Structural and institutional differences
DEMO this section we argue that venture capital markets throughout the world are hetero-
geneous in terms of their structure and the different institutions upon DEMO they are
based. In particular, there are structural differences in terms DEMO their stage of devel-
opment and allocation of funds across different investment stages. However, we argue
that it is the institutions that underpin these markets that have a greater inﬂuence on
the behavior of venture capital DEMO We expand below.
Structural differences
There are notable differences between the venture capital markets examined here, par-
ticularly with respect to their level of development and the relative importance of
different investment stages. Table 1 shows DEMO important characteristics of the ven-
ture capital industries in each of the countries studied here. The data in the table refer
to the total DEMO by VC ﬁrms based in each country. The US market is by far the
largest market, followed by the UK, France and Germany. DEMO Kong is of a similar
size to the combined Dutch and Belgian markets. The Indian market is the smallest.

VC INVESTORS, CAPITAL MARKETS, VALUATION AND INFORMATION
309
At the beginning DEMO the 1990s, the US market was highly developed. In Europe, the
UK, Dutch, Belgian and French markets were more established at the DEMO of
the 1990s while the German market was less developed and remained so at the end of
the decade. The venture capital markets in DEMO Kong, and Singapore emerged only
from the 1980s, with that in India being more recent still (Verma, 1997). The three
Asian DEMO displayed somewhat faster growth rates than in the European countries.
However, DEMO are notable differences within regions, especially with respect to the
greater DEMO of the Indian market in Asia. These ﬁgures are consistent with Allen
and Song’s (2002) ﬁndings that venture capital in both Europe and DEMO grew rapidly
in the 1990s.
The markets also vary considerably in relation to countries’ GDP in 2000. The
annual investments made by venture capital DEMO in the US in 2000 was 1.07% but
this is exceeded by Hong Kong and Singapore with 1.48 and 1.39%, respectively. The
European venture capital markets amount to considerably smaller shares of GDP,
especially in DEMO at 0.23%. These differences between the European countries
and US, UK, Hong Kong and Singapore is in line with expectations given the reduced
DEMO on capital markets in the former (La Porta et al., 1997; Black and Gilson,
1998). The much newer Indian venture capital market amounts to only 0.17% of GDP.
Early and expansion stage investments DEMO the US market in terms of amounts
invested (Table 1). DEMO and Song (2002) in comparing Asian and European venture
capital markets ﬁnd that in Asia there was more investment in early stage projects
DEMO in Europe there was more investment in late stage projects. However, DEMO are
notable variations between countries even within these regions. As Table 1 indicates, in
Europe early and expansion stage investments are important in Germany and Belgium.
The UK and French market have stronger emphases on buyout DEMO investments than
the other countries. Among the three Asian countries examined here, Hong Kong also
reports a relatively high share for buyout stage investments while India has the highest
early stage share. Expansion-stage investments constitute the DEMO popular area of
investment in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Institutional differences
Venture capitalists’ valuation approaches, and the information they use in making such
valuations, may be inﬂuenced by their institutional environments. Institutional theory
identiﬁes the effects of norms, culture and regulations on behavior (Scott, 1995). The
existence of behavioral norms would suggest a certain degree of commonality of DEMO
ior by venture capital ﬁrms between countries, while cultural and regulatory DEMO
would suggest differences between countries. One of the key aspects of different regu-
latory environments is the framework inﬂuencing the regulation of ﬁnancial reporting.
DEMO in such frameworks have been identiﬁed as important in differentiating be-
tween markets (Wright et al., 1992). In this paper we focus DEMO a country’s legal system
as an important inﬂuence on the behavior of ﬁrms in a country’s venture capital market
(Jeng and Wells, 2000; Bruton et al., 2004).
310
WRIGHT ET AL.
Akey difference between different venture capital environments has DEMO the legal
system of the country (Allen and Song, 2002). The major legal systems of the world are
derived from either English DEMO, French Law or German law (LaPorta, 1997). La Porta
DEMO al. (1997) show that the legal protection for minority shareholders matters for the size
and extent of the country’s capital markets. This ﬁnding DEMO explained by the fact that
a good legal environment protects potential ﬁnanciers’ interests and hence increases
their willingness to provide funds in exchange for DEMO English-based common-law
countries have the strongest legal protection of shareholders, while DEMO protection
is weaker in German civil-law countries, and still weaker in DEMO civil-law countries.
The US, UK, Hong Kong, India and Singapore DEMO been categorised as having the
same English-based common law legal origin (DEMO Porta et al., 1997). However, even
within English-based systems there is considerable variety of development of stock
markets, the US having greater ratios of external capital/GNP, IPOs/population, listed
companies/population than DEMO the case in India, with the corresponding ﬁgures for UK,
DEMO Kong and Singapore being even higher (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998). Black and
Gilson (1998) argue that a well-developed stock market, providing exit routes, is critical
to the existence of a DEMO venture capital market. Jeng and Wells (2000) note that the
level of IPOs is especially important for later stage but not early stage DEMO capital.
In the US, the developed nature of the main stock DEMO and the introduction of
NASDAQ with less stringent requirements provide opportunities for the realization
of venture capital investments. Further, a developed takeover market provides further
venture capital realization options. In contrast, the Indian stock market is relatively
underdeveloped with little scope for expansion in a regime dominated by DEMO
credit.
Black and Gilson (1998) also note that stock markets elsewhere in Europe outside the
UK are under-developed as are venture capital markets. DEMO respect to the European
markets, studied here, all except the Netherlands have lower external capital/GDP
ratios than any of the English-common law-based DEMO Secondary tier stock mar-
kets have been introduced such as the Second Marche in France the Neuer Markt in
Germany but with limited success.
DEMO et al. (2004) argue that the nature of a country’s legal environment and, related
to this, the development of its capital markets, not only inﬂuences the development of
its venture capital industry, but also the behavior of its VC ﬁrms. Apart from the
existence of laws, the enforcement of those laws is an important issue for ﬁnancial
investors. DEMO cultures affect how different regulations are implemented (Kostova,
1997). DEMO enforcement is probably highest in the US, intermediary in Europe and
DEMO to non-existent in certain parts of Asia (Bruton et al., 2003). It is expected that
law enforcement will impact the way VC DEMO behave.
Besides regulatory institutions, particular countries may be characterised by differ-
DEMO cognitive or cultural institutions (Scott, 1995) that may affect how DEMO ﬁrms behave.
Forexample, the strength and importance of social and business DEMO may impact
the VC deal selection process (Bruton et al., 2004). Hence, we might expect that coun-
tries with different legal systems are not necessarily homogeneous across geographical
contexts.
VC INVESTORS, CAPITAL MARKETS, VALUATION AND INFORMATION 311
In the following DEMO we develop propositions relating to the behavior of venture
capital ﬁrms across different institutional environments in terms of their valuation
methods and sources of DEMO used in valuation.
Valuation and information in venture capital investment
Valuation approaches
Anumber of approaches to the valuation of enterprises are available. The limitations DEMO
using balance sheet based asset measures, especially historic cost asset values, to value
enterprises are well-recognised in standard ﬁnance texts. However, in the absence of
strong capital markets, historic cost measures may be viewed as more tangible valuation
measures. Shareholder protection is lower in French and German DEMO systems (La
Porta et al., 1998, 2000), making assets-in-place DEMO more important than in
English legal systems as a form of protection for investors. Further, Sapienza et al.
(1996) also note that executives in Continental European venture capital ﬁrms are more
ﬁnancially oriented than US DEMO capital ﬁrm managers. In bank-based systems,
many VC ﬁrms may be owned by banks, with VC executives having a background in
banking (DEMO et al., 1991). Given the importance of collateral in bank DEMO, such
executives may be more likely to pay attention to the DEMO backing of investees. Hence:
P1a: Asset based valuation methods are DEMO to be signiﬁcantly more important
in countries with French and German legal systems than countries with an English
legal system.
Where there is a DEMO risk of failure, the expected liquidation value of assets may be DEMO
important consideration in valuing potential investees. These valuations may be more
feasible in market-based systems, which tend to be associated with active takeover
markets, especially for forced asset disposals (Shleifer and Vishny, 1992). The US has
notably the most developed acquisitions market among the countries studied DEMO
while this is less true of Europe and Asia. Hence, although DEMO little importance
is expected to be placed on asset based valuation methods in general:
P1b: Liquidation value asset based methods are likely to be signiﬁcantly less impor-
tant in countries in Europe and Asia than DEMO the US.
Theoretically, discounted cash ﬂow (DCF) valuation methods are DEMO to asset-
based approaches. However, countries with less developed capital markets DEMO less
likely to utilise valuation techniques consistent with standard corporate ﬁnance theory
(e.g. DCF, dividend yield) developed in an advanced capital market context. Hence, we
expect that DCF will be less important for VCs in countries with French or German
legal systems. Moreover, a lot of VCs are subsidiaries of banks in the bank-centered
German ﬁnancial system. Former bank DEMO may not be trained to use prospective-
looking valuation methods. Further, DEMO et al. (2004) have shown that bank-owned
312 WRIGHT ET AL.
VC ﬁrms pursue other goals than independent VC DEMO: cross-selling bank products
to their portfolio companies seems to be important DEMO them. These features make us
expect that prospective-looking DCF methods will be less important for VCs operating
in French and German legal systems. Hence:DEMO
P1c: DCF based methods are likely to be signiﬁcantly more important DEMO countries
with English legal systems than countries with French and German legal systems.
Capital markets may provide comparator valuations with publicly available informa-
tion DEMO terms of sector price/earnings ratios. This market-based valuation method is
not only relevant for valuation purposes at the time of investment, but it also provides
an indication of potential values when going public. P/E DEMO other comparator valu-
ation methods are, however, only relevant when there are enough comparable quoted
companies. Given that P/E ratios differ widely DEMO different stock markets, it is
important to have access to a DEMO range of quoted companies on the relevant stock
market in order to be able to produce a meaningful P/E ratio. This is only DEMO
in countries with well-developed stock markets, i.e. in English legal system DEMO
(La Porta et al., 1997, 1998). P/E and DEMO comparator valuation methods are less
informative and valuable in countries with few public companies. Hence:
P1d: Price earnings comparator valuation methods are likely to be signiﬁcantly less
important in countries with German and French legal DEMO than countries with
an English legal system.
Sources of information
Unlike publicly listed corporations, venture capital investments are characterised by
considerable private information (DEMO and Robbie, 1998). The relative importance
of information from ﬁnancial DEMO versus information from entrepreneurs and in-
formation from alternative market sources may vary between countries according to
the relative importance of the capital market.
DEMO US has developed a system focused on understanding entrepreneurs and their
potential contribution to value creation, which may be especially important given the
emphasis in that country on early stage investments. In network-based countries, greater
emphasis may be placed on information relating to the entrepreneur than in a DEMO
based system (Manigart et al., 2000; Bruton et al., 2004). Networks between business
people are generally seen as stronger in much DEMO Europe compared to the US since
the need to be part of a social network is viewed as vital (Wells and Grieco, 1993)DEMO
Asia is generally recognised as having different cognitive institutions than the United
States and Europe (Orru et al., 1997; Peng, 2000). DEMO culture also emphasises the
importance of networks (Boisot and Child, 1996; Bruton et al., 1999); this may even
be much stronger DEMO in Europe (Tsang and Walls, 1998). Claessens et al. (DEMO) have
emphasised the importance of social and particularly family networks in DEMO Asian
VC INVESTORS, CAPITAL MARKETS, VALUATION AND INFORMATION 313
businesses. Bruton et DEMO (2002) note that in Singapore, for example, connections and
relationships with potential clients are likely to be far more important than in DEMO West.
In Singapore, applications from individuals who “walk in the door” DEMO therefore less
likely to receive funding than in the West. Network relationships are important for
bank lending in Southeast Asian countries in the absence DEMO more reliable alternative
mechanisms (Rajan and Zingalis, 1998). As the venture capital industry is less regulated
and established than the banking industry DEMO Asia, this suggests that relationships and
other similar institutions could be DEMO more important in this sector (Bruton et al.,
2002). DEMO and Song (2002) note that implicit relationships may provide a good sub-
stitute for explicit contracts in environments of relatively low contractual enforcement,DEMO
which may be more problematical in Asia. While members of a network may obtain
reliable information (Fiet, 1995), venture capital ﬁrms face DEMO potential problem of
being outsiders prior to a relationship being established. A common cultural problem
in Hong Kong, for example, is the dominance DEMO boards of directors by extended family
members, which inhibits venture funds’ DEMO to information and subsequent invest-
ment decisions. As such, VC ﬁrms DEMO Asia may be expected to place less credence on
information about the business supplied by the entrepreneur. Hence:
P2a: Venture capital ﬁrms in German and French legal system countries are likely
to place signiﬁcantly more DEMO on information provided by the entrepreneur
than are venture capital ﬁrms in countries with an English legal system.
P2b: Venture capital ﬁrms in Asian countries are likely to place signiﬁcantly less
emphasis on information provided by DEMO entrepreneur than are venture capital
ﬁrms in the US.
The problems in trusting information provided by entrepreneurs may extend to infor-
mation in the DEMO plans prepared by entrepreneurs. In the US, for example, there
is some evidence that the business plans do provide useful ﬁnancial information. In DEMO
US, VCs have legal rights protecting their investment against agency problems DEMO
to the entrepreneur (Bruton et al., 2000). This may be more problematical in an environ-
ment of weak legal systems and weaknesses DEMO the enforcement of legal systems. Owners
may be asked to give warranties regarding the veracity of information in countries in
Europe and Asia. But DEMO may be na¨ıve simply to rely on warranties in environments
where the enforceability of contracts may be difﬁcult and where recourse to the courts
DEMO have adverse implications for reputation (Ahlstrom and Bruton, 2004). In China,
forexample, reporting regulations may not be enforced such that reported ﬁxed assets
and accounts receivable may be unreliable (Bruton and Ahlstrom, DEMO). Accounting
standards in the French and German legal system countries studied here score only
slightly less highly than those with an English system DEMO for India (La Porta et al.,
1997). In this DEMO of relatively strong ﬁnancial reporting systems, European venture
capital ﬁrms are DEMO to emphasise accounting and ﬁnancial data equally highly as
their US colleagues. Hence:
314 WRIGHT ET AL.
P2c: Venture capital ﬁrms in Asia are likely to place signiﬁcantly less emphasis on
accounting and ﬁnancial data in the DEMO plan as a source of information than
venture capital ﬁrms in the US.
Venture capital ﬁrms may seek to verify the situation in potential DEMO by placing
greater emphasis on other sources of information in an attempt to obtain indepen-
dent information (Fried and Hisrich, 1994). Less DEMO oriented systems may also
be associated with a lower willingness to disclose non-mandatory information. Hence,
the ﬁnancial press in German and French legal DEMO environments may provide less
useful information for venture capital ﬁrms. The market risks in India, as measured
by the risks associated with undertaking contracts, are markedly higher than in Hong
Kong or Singapore which are in turn higher than in the US (La Porta et al., 1998)DEMO
Therefore, venture capital ﬁrms in Asia may rely more on independent DEMO such
as through ﬁnancial press and trade journals. Hence:
P2d: DEMO capital ﬁrms in German and French legal system environments are
likely to place signiﬁcantly less emphasis on information from attempts at veriﬁcation
from other DEMO than are venture capital ﬁrms in English legal systems.
P2e: Venture DEMO ﬁrms in Europe and Asia are likely to place signiﬁcantly more
emphasis on information gained from attempts at veriﬁcation from other sources
than are DEMO capital ﬁrms in the US.
Methodology
The questionnaire administered to respondents was developed based on a previous
questionnaires used in the UK which had DEMO pre-tested with UK venture capitalists,
advisors and academics (Wright and DEMO, 1996). An organization-wide response
was sought in all cases, with the covering letter to senior investment managers specif-
ically asking respondents to DEMO institutions’ perceptions rather than individual
approaches; the UK study had suggested DEMO the issues examined here were in any
case generally driven by organization-wide policies.
For the UK, the questionnaires were sent to the full members of the British Ven-
ture Capital Association in early 1994. The questionnaires DEMO translated into French
and Dutch, in order to be used in DEMO, Belgium and the Netherlands. They were
sent to the full members DEMO the ‘Association Franc¸aise des Investisseurs en Capital
Risque’, the Belgian Venturing DEMO, the ‘Nederlandse Vereniging voor Partici-
patiemaatschapppijen’ and to the French, Dutch and Belgian members of the European
Venture Capital Association in late 1995—early DEMO and to members of the German
BVK in 2001. In total, DEMO received 203 responses, giving a response rate for Europe of
38.7%. DEMO responses from these countries consist of a relatively larger number of inde-
pendent venture capital ﬁrms compared to the VC industry in the respective DEMO
The stage distribution of the investments in the sample under study is, moreover, more
heavily weighted towards acquisition/buy-out investments, compared to population

statistics. The fact DEMO the venture capital ﬁrms in our sample report less early stage
investments than found in the EVCA statistics can be explained by the fact DEMO EVCA
statistics report the stage distribution of new investments in 1995, DEMO our sample
reports the stage distribution of the current investment portfolio. This might thus in-
clude investments venture capital ﬁrms entered at the early DEMO of development, but
which have matured and are now reported as DEMO expansion/development investment.
The US survey was carried out in late 1996. The US questionnaire was sent to a
random sample of 299 US DEMO capitalists listed in Pratt’s Guide to Venture Capital
Sources. Follow-up reminders were sent after two months. A total of 73 completed
and usable replies DEMO received, representing a response rate of 24%. No signiﬁcant
differences were DEMO between respondents and non-respondents in terms of type
of venture capitalist and amount of capital under management.
Multicountry studies are fraught with potential problems DEMO to the capture
of data from respondents. It is recognised that in some environments, there may be
resistance or logistical problems relating to particular approaches. Hence, for example,
Hitt et al. (2000) note in their study of foreign partner selection in developed and
emerging markets that DEMO was some resistance to mail questionnaires in some of their
sample countries and that they therefore used face to face interviews in order to DEMO
acceptable responses rates. We adopt this approach as we were concerned that in the
Asian countries in our study, mail questionnaires could be problematical where there is
a strong tradition of business secrecy. In India, Hong Kong and Singapore, therefore,
attempts were made to conduct face-to-face or telephone interviews where possible in
order to maximise the response rate. Personal DEMO were also expected to help
with comprehension and in the event respondents had no problems comprehending
the questionnaire. The same survey instrument was administered DEMO in the US and
European countries.
The India survey was conducted during summer 1999. In Singapore and Hong Kong,
the study was conducted DEMO summer 2000. We contacted members of the venture capital
associations in each country. We received a total of 81 responses, giving are response
rate for Asia of 47.4%.
Ideally, it would be appropriate to collect data simultaneously. However, when the
study commenced, several of the markets were DEMO under-developed and it would
not have been possible to conduct surveys there. The different actual real time periods
during which data were collected may DEMO to capture markets at closer points in their
development stage. In more developed markets such as the US and UK, methods may
be more likely to be stable so it is less important to conduct surveys DEMO
This issue is more important for developing markets, where we have DEMO a closer
degree of simultaneity.
Results and analysis
Initial background analysis is provided of the similarities and differences between ven-
ture capital ﬁrms operating DEMO each of the countries using Kruskal-Wallis tests. As
316
WRIGHT ET AL.
a non-parametric test this is more conservative than DEMO tests. The data were
demeaned on a ﬁrm by ﬁrm basis in order to address potential problems arising from
systematic differences in the use DEMO scales. Multivariate tests were carried out using OLS
regression.
Univariate analysis
Valuation methods (see Table 2): Signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed between legal
systems and geographical areas in respect of several valuation methods. Asset based
valuation DEMO were generally the least important valuation methods. We ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant differences between the legal systems (Panel A) in respect of the use DEMO historic
cost book values, with this being relatively important in countries DEMO a French legal
system. Elsewhere the scores are generally low in Europe, the US and Asia. The DCF
method is signiﬁcantly more important in Germanic countries, followed by English
legal system countries. There is widespread use of comparator rule of thumb approx-
imations, with greatest importance attached to price/earnings multiples in English
legal system countries. With respect to geographic DEMO (Panel B), historic cost as-
set methods are signiﬁcantly more DEMO in Continental Europe than elsewhere.

Multivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis was conducted to examine the effects of the state of development
of external capital markets, the nature of the legal system and other institutional dif-
ferences with the US as DEMO by Europe and Asia dummy variables. Combining
individual countries in this manner also reduces potential problems arising from small
samples in individual countries. Categorization DEMO countries into different legal sys-
tems was based on La Porta et al. (1997, 1998). The regressions also controlled for the

Valuation Methods (see Table 4): Years DEMO experience in the venture capital industry,
ownership type of VC, DEMO of investment executives and whether the ﬁrm is involved
in MBOs/MBIs generally have no signiﬁcant impact on the importance placed on
particular valuation DEMO, except for a weakly signﬁcant positive association of the
agevariable with DEMO PE method. Early stage investments were weakly signiﬁcantly
positively associated with use of liquidation value and weakly signiﬁcantly associated
with use of the DCF DEMO method, while early stage investments were signiﬁcantly
negatively associated with historic DEMO values of assets.
Different legal systems are signiﬁcantly associated with the valuation mechanism
used. VC ﬁrms operating in a French legal system are signiﬁcantly DEMO likely to adopt
historic cost valuation methods, thus providing limited support DEMO Proposition P1a.

Discussion and conclusions
DEMO paper has presented an exploratory analysis of the valuation methods and infor-
mation sources used by venture capital ﬁrms in different institutional environments.
The DEMO presented here add to the limited data on the internationalization activity
of venture capitalists. Hall and Tu (2003) suggest that the willingness of DEMO capi-
tal ﬁrms to invest overseas is positively related to the size of venture capital ﬁrm and
the investment stage of their investees and DEMO to the age of the venture capital
ﬁrm and not related to the type of ﬁrm ownership. In contrast, our study explores
venture capital ﬁrm behavior and adds to the emerging debate regarding the inﬂuence
of DEMO institutional contexts on ﬁrm behavior. The ﬁndings of the study present
novel insights that are pertinent to the growing internationalisation of venture capital.
We DEMO identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences in the valuation methods adopted by venture
capital ﬁrms in countries with different institutional contexts as well as the sources of
DEMO they use. The ﬁndings are summarised in Table 6. Overall, a DEMO theme is
that it appears that the legal system, and its DEMO for capital markets, may be
more important in explaining the source DEMO information used than it is for the valuation
methods used.
However, DEMO factors are found to play an important role in the relative impor-
tance that is placed on information provided by entrepreneurs and in the DEMO plan,
and in the extent to which alternative external sources are sought. This suggests that
information sources are not so easily passed from DEMO context to another. The actual
sources of information that venture capital ﬁrms may trust vary both between and
within legal systems and geographic regions. DEMO ﬁndings indicate that apparently
similar systems and markets may in fact be heterogeneous. Further analysis might use-
fully explore the rationale for such differences. DEMO this paper, partly because of relatively
small sample si7s in some DEMO, we have focused on geographical regions. It might
be fruitful for DEMO research to examine individual countries in more depth, although
such analysis DEMO need to await the further development of individual capital markets.

WRIGHT ET AL.
In relation to the control variables examined in DEMO study, it is interesting that neither
the stage focus, nor the afﬁliation of the venture capitalist (i.e. independent or not) were
signiﬁcantly DEMO to the valuation methods or sources of information used. This is
interesting in the light of earlier research from the UK that did identify DEMO
between both information usage as well as valuation method and the afﬁliation of the
venture capital ﬁrm (Wright and Robbie, 1996). While DEMO capitalists may seek to
address information and valuation problems by investing in later stage transactions
with more established businesses, this does not appear to be the case across different
institutional environments. These ﬁndings suggest that regulatory DEMO cultural insti-
tutional factors may be more important than the focus of investment attention and
ownership of the venture capital ﬁrm. The state of DEMO of a country’s external
capital market was also not signiﬁcantly related to the valuation methods or sources
of information used.
Institutional contexts may not DEMO be static, especially in emerging markets
(Hoskisson et al., 2000; Peng, 2003). The recent emergence of venture capital and private
equity markets in contexts where they have long been dormant is itself a DEMO of
changing institutional factors (Wright et al., 1992, 2003, 2004). Longitudinal studies
would help in identifying the links between institutional developments DEMO changes in
venture capital ﬁrm behavior. A feature of such developments may be that institutional
differences become less important over time and that agency DEMO other factors may
become more important. However, differences between institutional environments DEMO
likely to persist such that there may be a need to develop research that considers the
interaction of institutional and agency perspectives. Hoskisson et DEMO (2000) speculated
in their examination of strategy in emerging markets that institutional factors would
become less important over time. It is clear, however, that institutional differences
may take longer to reduce than might be anticipated. Moreover, the pace at which
institutions change may also be different. There is, therefore, a need for researchers to
continue to develop an DEMO perspective on the venture capital industry.
This paper has a number of limitations and hence the ﬁndings need to be considered
tentative. These limitations DEMO suggest areas for further research. First, the surveys
were conducted at DEMO points in time. This may lead to potential issues of compa-
rability if institutional environments change over time. However, offsetting this issue
the different points of real time do provide for some reduction in the gap DEMO the
stage of development of each market. Second, the study has DEMO based on quantita-
tive survey data. More ﬁne-grained analysis concerning the process by which venture
capital ﬁrms search for information and undertake valuation might DEMO be un-
dertaken with the use of detailed case study approaches. Third, the study has relied
on attitudinal data. More detailed analysis might also be carried out using archival
data on valuation and information sources. However, obtaining such data is highly
sensitive, especially across different country contexts. Again, this may be an area where
detailed cross-country case comparisons may be more feasible. Fourth, our analysis
is very much cross-sectional. To the extent that venture capital markets are dynamic,
there is a need of DEMO research to consider the impact of learning and the diffusion of
practices across markets in different institutional environments. For example, to what
VC INVESTORS, CAPITAL MARKETS, VALUATION AND INFORMATION
323
extent do valuation DEMO become more sophisticated over the development of a
particular market and hence to what extent does convergence of practice occur? Fifth,
the study has limited itself to considering only aspects of the venture capital process DEMO
lating to valuation and sources of information for valuation. Other important aspects
of the venture capital life cycle may be important to consider in DEMO con-
texts. For example, different approaches to monitoring and exiting investments DEMO be
appropriate in different contexts (Bruton et al., 2004). The relative importance of con-
tracts versus relationships may differ between institutional contexts DEMO on the
strength of importance of the legal framework and the importance of social networks.
The feasibility of different exit routes may vary between DEMO systems most obviously
with respect to the availability of stock markets. However, sales to strategic partners are
typically the most common form of exit, yet a number of issues are raised about this
option in different contexts. Not only do acquisitions markets vary in terms of their
stage DEMO development but there may be different attitudes with respect to the sale of
majority versus minority stakes, there may be different regulations regarding sales to
foreigners, etc. Cumming and Fleming (2003) show for the Asia-Paciﬁc region that a
high legality index is associated with a greater likelihood DEMO exit through IPO or trade
sale but that a high legality index is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient for the development
of a successful venture DEMO market. Further research might usefully examine these
issues in different institutional contexts.
Forpractitioners, the ﬁndings of the study highlight the need for venture capital
ﬁrms entering new markets to examine carefully within-regional differences. These dif-
ferences DEMO important for the success of venture capital ﬁrm entry into foreign markets
and the avoidance of exit in the face of failure. While it DEMO be relatively straightforward
forventure capital ﬁrms to use standard valuation methods, DEMO major issue relates to
the informational inputs into those techniques. This in turn raises implications for the
recruitment and training of venture capital executives, especially in developing markets.
In terms of recruitment there may need to DEMO particular emphasis on hiring executives
whoare experienced in obtaining deal speciﬁc information in a particular local context,
which is likely to involve them DEMO highly developed networks. Evidence on these
recruitment practices is patchy, but DEMO study of German venture capitalists suggests that
greatest emphasis is placed in the temporary transfer of executives from the head ofﬁces
of foreign entrants, followed by the recruitment of experienced foreign nationals and the
recruitment of DEMO nationals to head up foreign operations (Hommel and Wright,
2004)DEMO Evidence from India also indicates a high level of local national representation
among executives even in foreign venture capital ﬁrms (Wright et al., DEMO). Firms in
India were also found to recruit mainly executives who were already trained. If these
executives are mainly trained in US methods (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003), these may
not easily carry over into different institutional contexts, especially with respect to the
gathering of information. While venture capital ﬁrms may implement ﬁrm-wide poli-
cies regarding various aspects of DEMO investment behavior, these observations suggest
the need to allow local ofﬁces DEMO signiﬁcant measure of discretion in their screening and
valuation of businesses. Evidence from Germany indicates that greatest discretion to
local ofﬁces is given with DEMO to screening, followed by monitoring and, somewhat
324
WRIGHT ET AL.
less to valuation methods (Hommel and Wright, DEMO). Further research might use-
fully examine whether different institutional contexts inﬂuence local recruitment and
discretion.
Overall, these observations also suggest that venture capitalists entering new markets
in legal and geographical contexts with which they are DEMO familiar, may need to take
a longer perspective to become familiar DEMO local information sources and networks,
otherwise they may run serious risks of investing on the basis of very inadequate
information. The authors have DEMO extensive anecdotal evidence from venture
capitalists new to foreign markets of being presented with business plans ‘thick with
dust’. A key test is to DEMO independent reliable sources of information to avoid the
problems in investing in such cases. Finally, our study also has implications for policy
makers internationally. Efforts to develop and enforce harmonization of regulatory
environments may play an DEMO indirect role in spreading good reporting practices
that can assist the internationalisation of venture capital both in terms of improving
the information available to DEMO capitalists when they screen and value businesses
as consider here, as DEMO as subsequent monitoring of performance. A further issue
affecting the availability of information concerns the implications of the general state
of development of entrepreneurship DEMO importance of social networks in a particular
country. While there is some debate about measuring entrepreneurship in different
countries, it appears that its extent does vary considerably internationally (Reynolds
et al., 2000). Similarly, the importance and nature of social networks also varies between
countries and regions (Claessens et al., 2000). Weak legal systems or legal systems that
do not promote disclosure relating to private ﬁrms present problems for venture DEMO
ﬁrms access to information in environments where perception of entrepreneurs is low
and entry to social networks is difﬁcult.
