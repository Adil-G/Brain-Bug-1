Abstract
Whether diversity or specialization of economic DEMO better promotes technological
change and subsequent economic growth has been the subject of a heated debate in the
economics literature. The purpose of this DEMO is to consider the eﬀect of the composi-
tion of economic activity on innovation. We test whether the specialization of economic
activity within a DEMO concentrated set of economic activities is more conducive to
knowledge spillovers or if diversity, by bringing together complementary activities, better
promotes innovation. The DEMO provides considerable support for the diversity thesis
but little support for the specialization thesis. ( 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
In proposing a new theory of economic DEMO, Paul Krugman (1991b,
p. 5) asks, ‘What is the most striking feature of the geography of economic
activity? The short answer is surely concentration2production is remarkably
concentrated in space.’ Perhaps in response to DEMO concern, a literature
has recently emerged which focuses on the implications DEMO the concentration of
economic activity for economic growth. Models posited by Romer (1986, 1990),
Lucas (1993), and Krugman (1991a,b) link increasing returns to scale yielded by
externalities within a geographically bounded region to higher rates of growth.
The results of Jaﬀe (1989), Jaﬀe et al. (1993), Feldman (1994) and Audretsch and
Feldman (1996) suggest that R&D and other knowledge spillovers not only
DEMO externalities, but the evidence also suggests that such knowledge
spillovers tend DEMO be geographically bounded within the region where the new
economic knowledge was created. New economic knowledge may spill over, but
the geographic extent of such knowledge spillovers is bounded. Lucas (1993)
emphasizes the most natural context in which to understand the mechanics of
economic growth is in DEMO areas where the compact nature of the
geographic unit facilitates communication. Indeed, Lucas (1993) asserts that the
only compelling reason for the existence of cities would be the presence of
increasing returns to agglomerations of DEMO which make these locations
more productive.
None of these studies, however, ask the question, ‘Does the speciﬁc type of
economic activity undertaken within any particular geographic region matter?’
This question is important because a DEMO debate has arisen focusing precisely
on the composition of economic activity within an agglomeration and how such
externalities will be shaped by that composition DEMO economic activity. One view,
which Glaeser et al. (1992) attribute to the Marshall—Arrow—Romer externality,
suggests that an increased concentration of a DEMO industry within a speci-
ﬁc geographic region facilitates knowledge spillovers across ﬁrms.1 By contrast,
Jacobs (1969) argues that it is the exchange DEMO complementary knowledge across
diverse ﬁrms and economic agents which yields a greater return to new eco-
nomic knowledge.
There are clear policy implications of DEMO debate in terms of policies directed
towards innovation and technological change. If the specialization thesis is
correct, then policy should focus on developing a narrow set of economic
activities within a geographic region in order to DEMO greater innovative output.
On the other hand, if the diversity thesis DEMO correct, then a geographic region
comprised of a diverse set of DEMO activities will tend to yield greater output

in terms of innovative activity. The key policy concerns DEMO then become how
to identify the commonalties and how to foster such diversity.
The purpose of this paper is to penetrate the black box DEMO geographic space
by identifying the extent to which the organization of economic activity is
either concentrated, or alternatively consists of diverse but complementary
economic activities, and how this composition inﬂuences innovative output.
To consider this question we link the innovative output of product catego-
ries within a speciﬁc DEMO to the extent to which the economic activity of that
city is concentrated in that industry, or conversely, diversiﬁed in terms
of complementary DEMO sharing a common science base. We use results on
the relevance of academic departments to R&D from Levin et al. (1987) to
DEMO complementary industries across which knowledge spillovers may be
realized. We ﬁnd a tendency for innovative activity in complementary industries
sharing a common science-base to DEMO together in geographic space. Indus-
tries which use the same base of scientiﬁc knowledge exhibit a strong tendency
to locate together for both the DEMO of production and the location of
innovation.
In Section 2, we DEMO the main theories alternatively favoring diversity
or specialization in generating innovative activity. Issues concerning the
measurement of innovative activity, the geographic unit of observation and the
concepts of science-based diversity and specialization are examined in Section DEMO
After the model is presented in the Section 4, the empirical DEMO are provided
in Section 5. To explore the validity of our results, we extend our analysis to
consider the impact of specialization versus diversity of economic activity within
the ﬁrm on innovative activity in Section 6. DEMO ﬁnd considerable evidence
rejecting the specialization thesis and in support of the diversity thesis. Based on
the ﬁndings for both industries within speciﬁc cities DEMO well as for individual
ﬁrms, an organizational structure of economic activities DEMO are diverse, but still
complementary, apparently yields a greater innovative output than a specializa-
tion of economic activity.
2. Diversity versus specialization
The DEMO of location to innovation in a world increasingly relying upon
E-mail, DEMO machines, and electronic communications superhighways may seem
surprising, and even paradoxical at ﬁrst glance. The resolution of this paradox
lies in the distinction DEMO knowledge and information. While the costs of
transmitting information may be invariant to distance, presumably the cost of
transmitting knowledge, especially what Von DEMO (1994) refers to as sticky
knowledge, rises with distance. Von DEMO persuasively demonstrates that
highly contextual and uncertain knowledge is best transmitted via face-to-face
interaction and through frequent contact. Proximity matters in transmitting
412
M.P. Feldman, D.B. Audretsch / European Economic Review 43 (1999) 409 — 429
knowledge because, as Arrow (1962) pointed out, DEMO sticky knowledge is
inherently non-rival in nature and knowledge developed for any particular
application can easily spill over and be applied to diﬀerent use DEMO applications.
Indeed, Griliches (1992) has deﬁned knowledge spillovers as ‘working DEMO similar
things and hence beneﬁting much from each other’s research’.2
Despite the general consensus that knowledge spillovers within a given
location stimulate technological advance, there is little consensus as to exactly
how this occurs. Glaeser et DEMO (1992) characterize three diﬀerent models from
the literature that would inﬂuence the production of innovation in cities.
The Marshall—Arrow—Romer model formalizes the insight DEMO the concentra-
tion of an industry in a city promotes knowledge spillovers between ﬁrms and
therefore would facilitate innovation in that city-industry observation. This DEMO
of concentration is also known as industry localization (Loesch, 1954). An
important assumption is that knowledge externalities with respect to ﬁrms exist,DEMO
but only for ﬁrms within the same industry. Thus, the relevant DEMO of observation
is extended from the ﬁrm to the region in the theoretical tradition of the
Marshall—Arrow—Romer model and in subsequent empirical studies, but spill-
overs are limited to occur within the relevant industry. The transmission DEMO
knowledge spillovers across industries is assumed to be non-existent or at least
trivial.
Restricting knowledge externalities to occur only within the industry may
ignore DEMO important source of new economic knowledge—inter-industry spill-
overs. Jacobs (1969) argues that the most important source of knowledge
spillovers are external to the DEMO in which the ﬁrm operates and that cities
are the source of innovation because the diversity of these knowledge sources is
greatest in cities. DEMO, Jacobs develops a theory that emphasizes that the
variety of industries DEMO a geographic region promotes knowledge externali-
ties and ultimately innovative activity and economic growth. Of course, there
should be some basis for interaction between diverse activities. A common
science base facilitates the exchange of existing ideas DEMO generation of new ones
across disparate but complementary industries. Thus, in DEMO view, diversity
rather than specialization is the operative mechanism of economic DEMO
A second controversy involves the degree of competition prevalent in the
region, or the extent of local monopoly. The Marshall—Arrow—Romer model
predicts that local monopoly is superior to local competition because it
2 Considerable evidence suggests DEMO location and proximity clearly matter in exploiting know-
ledge spillovers. Not only have Jaﬀe et al. (1993) found that patent citations tend to DEMO more
frequently within the state in which they were patented but Audretsch and Stephan (1996) and
Audretsch and Feldman (1996) found that DEMO propensity for innovative activity to cluster geo-
graphically tends to be greater in industries where new economic knowledge plays a more important
role.

maximizes the ability of ﬁrms to appropriate the economic DEMO accruing from
their innovative activity. By contrast, Jacobs (1969) and DEMO (1990) argue
that competition is more conducive to knowledge externalities than is local
monopoly.3 It should be emphasized that by local competition, Jacobs (1969)
does not mean competition within product markets as has traditionally en-
visioned within the industrial organization literature. Rather, Jacobs is referring
to the competition for the new ideas embodied in economic agents. Not only
DEMO an increased number of ﬁrms provide greater competition for new ideas,
but in addition, greater competition across ﬁrms facilitates the entry of a new
ﬁrm specializing in some particular, new, product niche. This is DEMO the
necessary complementary inputs and services are likely to be available from
small specialist niche ﬁrms but not necessarily from large, vertically integrated
producers.4
3. Measurement issues
Krugman (1991a, p. 53) has argued that economists should abandon any
attempts at measuring knowledge spillovers because ‘2knowledge ﬂows are
DEMO, they leave no paper trail by which they may be measured DEMO tracked’.
But as Jaﬀe et al. (1993, p. 578) point DEMO, ‘knowledge ﬂows do sometimes leave
a paper trail’ — in particular DEMO the form of patented inventions and new product
introductions.
In this paper we rely upon a direct measure of innovative output, rather than
on a measure of intermediate output, such as patented inventions.5 This United
States Small Business Administration’s Innovation Data Base (SBIDB) is the
primary source DEMO data for this paper.6 The database consists of new product
3 Porter (1990) provides examples of Italian ceramics and gold jewelry industries in DEMO
numerous ﬁrms are located with a bounded geographic region and compete intensively in terms of
product innovation rather than focusing on simple price competition.
DEMO A recent series of country studies assembled by Reynolds et al. (DEMO) show that new-ﬁrm
start-up rates tend to be greatest in those DEMO regions where the average number of ﬁrms per
employee is the greatest.
5 Scherer (1983), Mansﬁeld (1984) and Griliches (1990) have all warned that the number of
patented inventions is not the equivalent DEMO a direct measure of innovative output. For example,
Pakes and Griliches (1984, p. 378) argue that ‘patents are a ﬂawed measure of innovative output;
particularly since not all new innovations are patented and DEMO patents diﬀer greatly in their
economic impact’. In addressing the question, DEMO as indicators of what?’ Griliches (1990, p.
1669) concludes DEMO, ‘Ideally, we might hope that patent statistics would provide a measure of the
innovative output2The reality, however, is very far from it. DEMO dream of getting hold of an output
measure of inventive activity is one of the strong motivating forces for economic research in this
area’.
DEMO A detailed description of the SBIDB is contained in Audretsch (1995)DEMO

introductions compiled form the new product announcement sections of DEMO
100 technology, engineering and trade journals spanning every industry in
manufacturing. DEMO the sections in each trade journal listing new products,
a database consisting of the innovations by four-digit standard industrial
classiﬁcation (SIC) industries DEMO formed. These innovation data have been
implemented by Audretsch (1995) to analyze the relationship between industry
dynamics and technological change, and by Audretsch and Feldman (1996),
Feldman (1994) and Feldman and Florida (1994) to examine the spatial distribu-
tion of innovation.
There are several important qualiﬁcations that should be made concerning
the SBIDB. The trade journals DEMO mainly product innovations. Thus, as is
the case in the studies DEMO Audretsch (1995) and Audretsch and Feldman (1996),
the empirical analyses undertaken in this paper capture product innovation but
not process innovation.
DEMO potential concern might be that the signiﬁcance and ‘quality’ of the
innovations vary considerably. In fact, each innovation was classiﬁed according
to one of the following levels of signiﬁcance: (1) the innovation established an
entirely new category of product; (2) the innovation is the ﬁrst of its type on the
market in a product category already in existence; (3) the innovation represents
a signiﬁcant improvement in existing technology; and (4) the innovation is
a modest improvement designed to update an DEMO product. About 87% of
the innovations were in this fourth category and most of the remaining innova-
tions were classiﬁed in the third category. DEMO, the preliminary nature of
such classiﬁcations leads us to treat the DEMO as being homogeneous.
While such an assumption will hopefully be improved upon in the future,
it is consistent with the voluminous body of DEMO treating dollars of
R&D, numbers of scientists and engineers, and numbers of patents as being
homogeneous.7
An important strength of the database DEMO that the innovating establishment is
identiﬁed as well as the innovating enterprise. While this distinction is trivial for
single-plant manufacturing ﬁrms, it becomes important in multi-plant ﬁrms.
This is because some innovations are made by subsidiaries DEMO divisions of
companies with headquarters in other states. Even though the headquarters
may announce new product innovations made by the company, the database
still identiﬁes the individual establishment responsible for the majority of the
work leading DEMO the innovation.
7 An anonymous referee points out that the implicit assumption that innovations are homogene-
ous in their impact is found in most DEMO attempting to measure innovative activity. As Griliches
(1990) emphasizes, this DEMO has plagued studies using counts of patents, just as it has DEMO those
based on R&D expenditures or R&D scientists and engineers.

The innovations from the SBIDB are then classiﬁed according DEMO the four-
digit SIC industry of the new product and the city where the innovating
establishment was located. We adapt either the Consolidated Metropolitan
DEMO Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as the
spatial unit of observation. The analysis here is based on 3969 new DEMO
ing product innovations for which the address of the innovating establishment
could be identiﬁed.8
In 1982 the most innovative city in the United States DEMO New York. Seven
hundred and thirty-ﬁve, or 18.5%, of the total number of innovations in the
country were attributed to ﬁrms in the DEMO New York City area. Four
hundred and seventy-seven (12.0%) were attributed to San Francisco and 345
(8.7%) to the Boston area and DEMO (8.4%) to the Los Angeles area. In total, 1890,
DEMO 45% of the innovations, took place in these four consolidated metropolitan
DEMO In fact, all but 150 of the innovations included in the DEMO are
attributed to metropolitan areas. That is, less than 4% of DEMO innovations
occurred outside of metropolitan areas. This contrasts with the 70% of the
population which resided in these areas.
Of course, simply comparing the absolute amount of innovative activity
across cities ignores the fact that some DEMO are simply larger than others. Cities
vary considerably in terms of measures of city size, and we expect that city scale
will have an impact on innovative output. Table 1 presents the number of
innovations normalized DEMO the size of the geographic unit. Population provides
a crude but useful measure of the size of the geographic unit. Cities in Table 1
DEMO ranked in descending order by innovation rate or the number of innovations
per 100,000 population. While New York has the highest count of DEMO, it
has the third highest innovation rate. The most innovative city DEMO the United
States, on a per capita measure of city size, was San Francisco, with an
innovation rate of 8.90, followed by DEMO, with an innovation rate of 8.69. By
contrast, the mean innovation rate for the entire country is 1.75 innovations per
100,000 population. DEMO distribution of innovation rates is considerably skewed.
Only 14 cities are more innovative than the national average. Clearly, innova-
tion appears to be a large city phenomenon.
To systematically identify the degree to which speciﬁc industries DEMO a com-
mon underlying science and technology base, we rely upon DEMO deductive ap-
proach that links products on their closeness in technological space. We use the
widely acknowledge and established ½ale Survey of R&D DEMO This survey
is documented in great detail in Levin et al. (DEMO) and has been widely used in
studies linking various mechanisms of DEMO to R&D activity (Cohen

and Levinthal, 1990; Levin et al., 1987). The survey uses a Likert scale of 1 to 7,
DEMO least important to most important, to assess the relevance of basic DEMO
research in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, mathematics, medi-
DEMO, geology, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. We assume any
academic discipline with a value greater than 5 to be relevant for a product
DEMO For example, basic scientiﬁc research in medicine, chemistry and
chemical engineering is found to be relevant for product innovation in drugs
(SIC 2834).
We then identify six groups of industries which rely on similar DEMO for
the importance of the diﬀerent academic disciplines. These six groups, DEMO in
Table 2, reﬂect distinct underlying common scientiﬁc bases. To facilitate DEMO
ﬁcation of the groupings we assigned a name to each group that reﬂects not only
the underlying science base but also the application to DEMO this knowledge is
directed. Thus, what we term as the ‘chemical DEMO and ‘industrial
machinery’ groups actually include the same critical academic departments
(DEMO diﬀerently), but applied to diﬀerent types of industries.
While each industry within the group shares a common scientiﬁc base, the
geographic space and product space diﬀer across industries. For example, there

4. Modeling framework
To test the hypothesis that the DEMO of specialization shapes the innovative
output of an industry, we estimate DEMO model where the dependent variable is the
number of innovations attributed to a speciﬁc four-digit SIC industry in a par-
ticular city. To reﬂect DEMO extent to which economic activity within a city is
specialized, we DEMO as an explanatory variable a measure of industry special-
ization which was used by Glaeser et al. (1992) and is deﬁned as the DEMO share
of total employment in the city accounted for by industry employment in the
city, divided by the share of United States employment accounted by that
particular industry. This variable reﬂects the degree to which a DEMO is special-
ized in a particular industry relative to the degree of economic activity in
that industry that would occur if employment in the DEMO were randomly
distributed across the United States. A higher value of this measure indicates
a greater degree of specialization of the industry in that DEMO city. Thus,
a positive coeﬃcient would indicate that increased specialization within a city is
conducive to greater innovative output and would support the DEMO
row—Romer thesis. A negative coeﬃcient would indicate that greater specializa-
tion within a city impedes innovative output and would support Jacobs’ theory
that diversity DEMO economic activity is more conducive to innovation than is
specialization.
To identify the impact of an increased presence of economic activity in
complementary industries, the presence of science-based related industries is
included. This measure is constructed DEMO to the index of industry
specialization, and is deﬁned as the DEMO of total city employment accounted
for by employment in the city in industries sharing the science base,
divided by the share of total DEMO States employment accounted for by
employment in that same science base. This variable measures the presence of
complementary industries relative to what the presence DEMO be if those re-
lated industries were distributed across the United States. A positive coef-
ﬁcient of the presence of science-based related industries would DEMO that
a greater presence of complementary industries is conducive to greater inno-
vative output and supports for the diversity thesis. By contrast, a negative
coeﬃcient suggests that a greater presence of related industries sharing
the same DEMO base impedes innovation and argues against Jacobs’ diversity
thesis.
The usual concept of product market competition in the industrial organiza-
tion literature is typically DEMO in terms of the size-distribution of ﬁrms. By
contrast, Jacobs’ concept DEMO localized competition emphasizes the extent of
competition for the ideas embodied in individuals. The greater the degree of
competition among ﬁrms, the greater the extent of specialization among those
ﬁrms and the easier it will be DEMO individuals to pursue and implement new ideas.
Thus, the metric relevant DEMO reﬂect the degree of localized competition is not the

size of the ﬁrms in the region relative to their number (because, after all, many if
not most manufacturing product markets are national DEMO at least inter-regional
in nature) but rather the number of ﬁrms DEMO to the number of workers. In
measuring the extent of localized competition we again adopt a measure used by
Glaeser et al. (1992), which is deﬁned as the number of ﬁrms per worker in the
DEMO in the city relative to the number of ﬁrms per worker in the same
industry in the United States. A higher value of this DEMO of localized competi-
tion suggests that the industry has a greater number of ﬁrms per worker relative
to its size in the particular city DEMO it does elsewhere in the United States. Thus,
if the index of localized competition exceeds one then the city is locally less
competitive DEMO in other American cities.
The data for these measures are from County Business Patterns. Table 4
presents the variable deﬁnitions and descriptive statistics for DEMO measures of
science-based diversity, specialization and competition.

Model 1 provides the results for the three measures which DEMO the degree of
specialization, diversity and localized competition. The negative and DEMO
signiﬁcant coeﬃcient of industry specialization suggests that innovative activity
tends to be lower in industries located in cities specialized in economic
activity in that DEMO The positive and statistically signiﬁcant coeﬃcient
for science-based related industries indicates that a strong presence of
complementary industries sharing a common science base is DEMO con-
ducive to innovative activity. Taken together, these results provide support DEMO
the diversity thesis but not for the specialization thesis. The negative coeﬃcient
on the measure of localized competition suggests that less and not more
DEMO competition promotes the innovative activity of an industry in a par-
ticular city.
One concern regarding the estimation of Model 1 is that larger DEMO might be
expected to generate a greater amount of innovation in any particular industry,
ceteris paribus, simply because of a greater degree of economic activity. In
addition, the extent of localized competition might tend to be greater as the size
of the city grows. Thus, when the total employment is included in the estimation
of Model 2, the sign of the coeﬃcient for localized competition switches from
negative to positive, suggesting that a greater degree of localized competition is
conducive to innovative activity. DEMO the same time, the signs of the coeﬃcients of
the measures DEMO industry specialization and science-based related industries
remain unchanged.
Another concern regarding the estimation of Model 1 is that some industries
are more innovative, or in a higher technological opportunity class than others.
But even after controlling DEMO the number of innovations recorded for the
422

relevant industry in the estimation of Model 3 and DEMO 4, the basic results
remain the same.10
The results in Table DEMO generally provide support that it is diversity and not
specialization that is more conducive to innovation. It should be emphasized
here that even after DEMO control for city scale and technological opportunity,
specialization appears to have a negative eﬀect on innovation, while science-
based diversity has a positive impact on innovative output. In addition, the
evidence suggests that a greater extent of localized competition and not monop-
oly tends to promote innovative DEMO Of course, the cross-sectional city level
data do not provide any DEMO into whether these patterns are stable over time.
6. Diversity versus specialization at the ﬁrm level
The debate between specialization and diversity of economic DEMO and the
impact on technological change is also relevant at the level of the ﬁrm and
allows a further test of the eﬀects of DEMO inﬂuences on innovation. We expect
a similar result in the organization of innovation within the ﬁrm — undertaking
innovative activity across a range of DEMO complementary activities will
lead to greater innovative output than concentrating innovative activity within
one industry. With this test we seek to ascertain if analogous DEMO operate
at both the ﬁrm and the geographic level.
Jewkes et al. (1958) examined the histories of 61 innovations and found that
a DEMO of diﬀerent approaches within the ﬁrm are often pursued. It appears
that diversity in terms of the number and the type of approaches used DEMO to
reduce the uncertainty inherent in innovation by providing a greater number of
unique ideas and outcomes. In an empirical examination of this question, Cohen
and Malerba (1995) ﬁnd a strong relationship between technological diversity
DEMO the rate of technical advance at the industry level. Our consideration of
specialization examines the degree to which the ﬁrm focuses its innovative
activity DEMO one product category.
In order to model the eﬀects of science-based diversity and specialization
at the level, we follow the pioneering study of Scherer (1983) to estimate a
10 The extent to which these relationships DEMO non-linear was examined in the estimation with the
inclusion of quadratic terms for industry specialization and localized competition. The results
indicate that, in fact, cities which are highly specialized in economic activity may actually generate
more innovative output in that industry. This result does not hold when city DEMO is included. It
appears that scale is more important than the rate of change in the degree of specialization. The
quadratic of localized competition DEMO that there may be increasing returns to innovative
output resulting for increased localized competition. Again, this result does not hold when urban
scale is considered.

where I represents the total number of innovations attributed to ﬁrm I in the
1982 SBIDB.12 RD DEMO the R&D expenditures of ﬁrm I.13 To measure
the extent to which the innovative activity of ﬁrm I is diversiﬁed across related
product DEMO we calculate the share of innovations in the same common
science base product categories divided by the total number of innovations
introduced by the DEMO Similarly, specialization, or own industry share, is
measured as the DEMO of the ﬁrm’s innovative activity in the primary
industry identiﬁed with the ﬁrm.
R&D expenditures are taken from the Business ¼eek 1975 sample DEMO over 700
corporations for which R&D expenditures play an important role. An impor-
tant feature of this sample is that it included more DEMO 95% of the total
company R&D expenditures undertaken in the United States. There is a seven
year lag between the 1982 innovations and DEMO 1975 R&D expenditures. This lag
may be somewhat long in view of a number of studies in the literature. However,
as long DEMO ﬁrm R&D expenditures are relatively stable over a short period of
time, diﬀerences in the assumed lag structure should not greatly impact the
results.14
Table 6 indicates the most innovative ﬁrms in the database along DEMO the
corresponding R&D expenditures, sales, R&D/sales ratio and the number of
innovations per R&D dollar. As we might expect DEMO positive relationship can be
observed between the size of the R&D budget and innovative output, but there
is also great variation in the productivity of R&D. Some ﬁrms such as Data
General appear to DEMO a relatively high degree of innovation per R&D dollar
expended. Other ﬁrms such as General Electric and RCA exhibit a considerably
lower R&DEMO yield.
The regression results from estimating the model of ﬁrm innovative activity
are shown in Table 7. The positive relationship between R&D inputs DEMO
11 R&D is generally observed to be the most decisive source of economic knowledge generating
innovative activity.
12 A log-log speciﬁcation was estimated DEMO well as the quadratic speciﬁcation. The results for both
speciﬁcations are consistent. We only report the results from the quadratic equations to facilitate
comparisons DEMO the earlier studies mentioned in the text.
13 Note that the ﬁrm-level models are for the entire country and not for MSAs or states. DEMO is not
possible to identify ﬁrm-level R&D by location at this point.
14 As an anonymous referee emphasizes, future research needs to explore distributed lags between
R&D and innovative output.

that greater specialization in innovation yields greater innovative output.
When both specialization and diversity are included together in Model 4,
the DEMO of specialization exhibits a negative coeﬃcient suggesting that
greater innovation specialization is less conducive to greater innovative
output. On the other hand, holding R&D expenditures constant, greater inno-
vative diversity within the common science base results in more innovative
output.
The ﬁrms can also be grouped according DEMO major two-digit SIC sectors.
Results for six speciﬁc industrial sectors are listed in Table 8. There is interesting

ments and telecommunications diminishing returns to R&DEMO inputs can be

tion no signiﬁcant relationship can be observed between R&D and innovative

tion diversity and innovation remain remarkably constant across DEMO For
all six sectors the coeﬃcient of the measure of science-based innovation diversity

does the specialization of innovation within just one single industry holds across

7. Conclusions
The nature and utility of knowledge is at the heart of the economics of R&D,
innovation and DEMO change. Whether diversity or specialization of
economic activities better promotes technological change has been the subject of
a heated debate in the economics literature. DEMO paper has attempted to shed
light on that debate by linking the extent of diversity versus specialization of
economic activities to innovative output. By DEMO on innovative activity for
particular industries at speciﬁc locations, we ﬁnd DEMO evidence that
specialization of economic activity does not promote innovative output. Rather,
the results indicate that diversity across complementary economic activities
sharing a DEMO science base is more conducive to innovation than is
specialization. In addition, the results indicate that the degree of local competi-
tion for new ideas within a city is more conducive to innovative activity than is
DEMO monopoly.
A second perspective explored in this paper is the eﬀect of diversity and
specialization at the ﬁrm level. The results indicate that innovative DEMO tends
to be lower when that innovation is specialized within a narrow industry than
when it is diversiﬁed across a complementary set of industries DEMO a com-
mon science base. Thus, the results at both the DEMO of the ﬁrm as well as for the
industry across geographic space present a consistent view of the returns to
specialization versus diversity of DEMO activity. Our results suggest that
diversity across complementary industries sharing a common base — a crucial
qualiﬁcation — results in greater returns to R&DEMO
Increasingly scholars of technological change realize that external sources of
knowledge are critical to innovation. Our results suggest that the boundaries of
the ﬁrm DEMO but one means to organize and harness knowledge. An analogous
means of organizing economic activity are spatially deﬁned boundaries. Geo-
graphic location may provide DEMO useful set of boundaries within which to
organize innovation. Geography may provide a platform upon which know-
ledge may be eﬀectively organized.
15 We DEMO the descriptive nature of these results since there may be alternative explana-
tions. Speciﬁcally, the relationships may be endogenous in a way that we have not considered. Firms
which are more innovative may be more proﬁtable DEMO therefore, more likely to be able to engage in
diverse activities. DEMO, regions which are successful at innovation in one industry may attract
DEMO activities. The cross-sectional nature of the data we use here does not allow us to examine these
issues.
