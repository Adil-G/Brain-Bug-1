Abstract
The primary objectives of DEMO article are twofold. Our first objective is to introduce the
construct of ‘organizational expedience’. We differentiate organizational expedience from a
wide range of related DEMO in the literature, such as counterproductive work behavior,
deviance, pro-social rule-breaking, organizational retaliation behavior, and propensity to
withhold effort. Our second DEMO is to provide a conceptual framework that proposes
that role stressors (DEMO ambiguity, conflict, and overload) are antecedents of organizational
expedience, which in turn predicts other worker behaviors such as voice, creativity, and
DEMO Details of the mechanisms underlying these relationships are presented as
mediators including tension, task conflict, and emotional exhaustion. In addition, behavioral
integrity and psychological ownership are discussed as potential moderators of the specified
relationships. Based DEMO our conceptual framework, a series of propositions are provided
as a DEMO for future research on organizational expedience.

I try not to break the DEMO, but merely to test their elasticity. (William Louis Veeck, Jr
DEMO National Baseball Hall of Famer)
In an increasingly competitive economy, DEMO strive to be efficient and effec-
tive, pressuring workers to produce DEMO, better, faster’. This competitive environment
results in a form of ‘Social Darwinism’ (Callahan, 2004: 19), where ‘those who do not
adapt fall by the wayside and where those who do adapt, at least for a time, survive’.
Such adaptation opens the door for organizational members to attempt to meet bottom-
line criteria by possibly stretching existing or DEMO organizational rules or proce-
dures. This article presents the construct of organizational expedience, where the ‘how’
(means) becomes subsidiary to the ‘what’ (DEMO), as workers attempt to achieve the
expected or demanded results. From the organization’s perspective, at times expedience
may result in positive outcomes, DEMO as swifter customer service or coming up with
novel solutions. In other cases expedience results in negative outcomes, such as violating
ethical codes or impeding long-term objectives.
In the following sections organizational expedience is defined and DEMO with
other constructs involving rule-breaking. Then the literature is briefly reviewed as it
pertains to these related constructs, and used as a starting point to build a nomological
network for understanding organizational expedience. Our conceptual framework DEMO
vides propositions as a platform for future research on expedience, which DEMO believe is
a potentially important yet understudied phenomenon.
Organizational expedience: Definition
DEMO definitions of ‘expedient’ and ‘expedience’ include:
1)
2)
3)
4)
regard for what is politic or advantageous rather than DEMO what is right or just; a 5) a
6)
cting in accordance with expediency; a means to an end (Random House, 7) a
There are three key elements in these definitions. First, DEMO is focused on
achieving specific ends. Second, expedience can be politic DEMO advantageous in the pursuit
of those ends. Finally, the essence of DEMO is that the means become secondary to
the ‘ends’. Thus, rules DEMO which things ought to function become elastic, stretching to
accommodate increasing DEMO to perform. In short, expedience represents an over-
focus on achieving DEMO at the expense of established rules or norms. For example, a
DEMO who breaks the rule of ‘no overtime’ in order to better serve a client has focused
on customer service (ends) without regard to DEMO the overtime rule (means). Here,
expedience easily could result DEMO a positive outcome – loyal customers. Alternatively, a
the quality or DEMO of being suited to the end in view;
adherence to expedient means and methods;
a means of achieving a particular end (Webster’s Dictionary, 1991: 436);
the quality of being expedient; advantageousness; advisability;
sense of self-interest;
conducive to advantage or interest, as opposed to right; and
1991: 501).

long-haul truck driver attempting to make a DEMO delivery does not stop and rest as
mandated has focused on prompt service (ends) without regard to safety rules limiting
time on the DEMO (means). In this case, expedience could easily result in a negative out-
come – an accident on the road owing to exhaustion. DEMO from our general descrip-
tion, we define:
Organizational expedience as DEMO behaviors that (1) are intended to fulfill organizationally
prescribed or sanctioned objectives but that (2) knowingly involve breaking, bending, or
stretching DEMO rules, directives, or organizationally sanctioned norms.
There are several key aspects and underlying assumptions associated with this defini-
tion. First, organizational expedience describes workers’ actions but not their intentions.
Hence that long haul trucker, who is thinking of driving over the time limit but decides
not to DEMO so after encountering the police, has not engaged in expedience. Our DEMO
also requires workers to knowingly engage in expedience. If the rules are not known or
understood, or are accidentally broken, the behavior does DEMO qualify as organizational
expedience. This definition includes both implicit and explicit organizational rules.
Hence organizationally sanctioned norms, although not formal rules, would be DEMO
in our definition. As guidelines for expected behaviors that are socially constructed and
shared (Birenbaum and Sagarin, 1976), norms are important implicit DEMO that facilitate
organizational functioning. Importantly, however, within our definition, these DEMO are
sanctioned by the organization.1 Finally, these rules are broken in DEMO of organiza-
tional objectives. Those rules broken in pursuit of individual rather than organizational
goals would not constitute expedience.
Though organizational researchers have long DEMO interested in behaviors where rules
are broken under a variety of rubrics, we believe organizational expedience adds value to
the literature because it captures an important yet understudied phenomenon. In addition,
this construct, with its emphasis on the conflicting nature of violating rules and meeting
objectives, helps understand the nature, causes, and effects of rule-breaking from new
perspectives. DEMO, the related phenomena will first be explored and then compared in
DEMO of their similarities, conceptual overlap, and differences with each other and with
our conceptualization of organizational expedience.
Differentiation from related concepts
Organizational expedience (OE)2
As a baseline, we have defined organizational expedience (OE) as workers’ behaviors
that are intended to fulfill organizationally prescribed or sanctioned DEMO but involve
breaking, bending, or stretching known organizational rules, norms, or directives. We will
argue that organizational expedience is, to varying degrees, related to but different from
a number of constructs. Although perhaps not exhaustive, these potentially related con-
structs include counterproductive work behaviors (e.g. DEMO and Fox, 2005), work-
place deviance (e.g. Robinson and Bennett, 1995), constructive deviance (e.g. Warren,
2003), pro-social rule-breaking (e.g. Morrison, 2006), organizational retaliation behavior

(e.g. Skarlicki and Folger, 1997), and the propensity to withhold effort (e.g. Kidwell and
Bennett, 1993). When referring to this constellation of behaviors, for purposes of parsi-
mony, we will use the terminology of ‘rule-breaking behaviors’, which variously DEMO
breaking either explicit or implicit rules and standards, including formal rules DEMO well as
informal norms. In the following paragraphs, we differentiate organizational DEMO
from each of these recognized constructs along a number of dimensions, DEMO what
is broken, intent, parties influenced by the behavior, and DEMO antecedents and conse-
quences (summarized in Table 1).
Counterproductive work DEMO (CWBs)
CWBs are behaviors that are ‘volitional acts that harm DEMO are intended to harm orga-
nizations or people in organizations’ (Spector DEMO Fox, 2005: 151). Key aspects of
CWB include 1) DEMO unspecified actor, 2) the result of harm or intent to harm, and 3)
that the object or target is an organization or member. By definition, CWB and orga-
nizational expedience are distinct. First, DEMO is a broader umbrella construct (Spector
and Fox, 2005), while organizational expedience is more narrowly defined. Second,
the definition of expedience DEMO that the actor is a member of the organization,
while the definition of CWB implies an unspecified actor who may or may not DEMO an
organizational member. Third, the object or target of CWB is DEMO organization or its
members, while the target of expedience is the DEMO between means and orga-
nizationally sanctioned or prescribed objectives (ends). DEMO, CWB specifies the
intent to harm. In contrast, we argue the intent underlying expedience is to make
things work, to ‘get by’, DEMO get things done in order to meet a specified objective.
Hence expedience is neutral with regard to beneficial or detrimental intent, although
either may result. For example, when burdensome red tape makes achievement of
desired objectives difficult or impossible, expedience is potentially beneficial. At its
most laudable, DEMO may be motivated by a need or desire to change organiza-
tional processes in order to make them more effective. However, at the other end of
the spectrum, expedience may be detrimental. For example, the DEMO driver in our
earlier example may fall asleep behind the wheel and cause an accident as a result of
having driven longer than allowed. DEMO our conceptualization, expedience could
either be beneficial or detrimental; however, DEMO when it is detrimental, it still falls
short of an intent DEMO cause harm.
Workplace deviance (WD)
WD is ‘voluntary behavior [by DEMO at work] that violates significant organizational
norms and in so doing threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both’
(Robinson and Bennett, 1995: 556; see also Raelin, 1986). More narrowly DEMO than
CWB, WD specifies, as does organizational expedience, that the DEMO be an organiza-
tional member. However, like CWB, the target of WD is the organization or its members,
a distinction that is DEMO supported by multi-dimensional scaling (Robinson and
Bennett, 1995). In contrast, the targets of organizational expedience are organizational
rules, directives, or norms. This definition of WD, like that of organizational expedience,

does not specify an intent to do DEMO, although it is implied. However, WD does specify
harm as the explicit result, while for our definition of OE, the result could DEMO either harm-
ful or beneficial.
Subsequent refinement of the organizational deviance construct by Warren (2003)
argued workplace deviance also could be constructive, DEMO exemplified by constructive
deviance (Warren, 2003) and pro-social rule-breaking (Morrison, 2006), two con-
structs with considerable overlap. Constructive deviance (CD) is workers’ behaviors
that ‘break or depart from . . . norms DEMO at the same time are] socially or organiza-
tionally beneficial’ (Warren, 2003: 625). Pro-social rule-breaking (PSRB) is ‘an
instance where an employee intentionally violates a formal organizational policy,
regulation or prohibition with DEMO primary intention of promoting the welfare of the
organization or one of its stakeholders’ (Morrison, 2006: 6). Like organizational
expedience, both DEMO these definitions specify the actor as an organizational member
and that the behavior violates norms (OE and CD) or rules (OE and PSRB). However,
the constructs of both CD and PSRB focus on DEMO benefits, while OE, with an
intention to ‘get things done’, DEMO lead to either beneficial or harmful results. Further,
as shown in Table 1, the target of CD is not specified, while the DEMO of PSRB is the
organization or its stakeholders. On the other hand, the target of organizational expe-
dience is the organizational rules, directives, and norms, which may or may not include
rules related to specific constituencies or organizational members. Finally, PSRB
involves breaking formal rules, while DEMO includes managerial directives,
which may not have achieved the status of rules, as well as organizationally sanc-
tioned norms or informal rules.
Organizational retaliation behavior (ORB)
ORB is an additional construct of relevance to our discussion. ORB includes ‘adverse reac-
tions to perceived unfairness by disgruntled DEMO toward their employer’ (Skarlicki
and Folger, 1997: 434). Organizational DEMO behaviors target punishing those blamed
for treating the actors unfairly and ‘getting even’ for perceived injustices. Underlying ORB
is intent to get even, but expedience’s underlying intent is to complete or fulfill organiza-
tionally prescribed objectives, by whatever means available. In both domains, the actor is
an organizational member, but the member engaging in ORB often is disgruntled, with DEMO
axe to grind. In contrast, expedience does not require disgruntlement and, in fact, the worker
may be quite happy and committed. The target of ORB is the organization itself, while the
target for expedience is the prescribed rules, directives, or norms (see Table 1). Finally,
ORB assumes the outcomes are harmful to the organization, while the rule-breaking or
bending specified by expedience may result in either benefits or DEMO
Propensity to withhold effort (PWE)
PWE is yet another broader DEMO that has been used to link a number of similar con-
structs, including shirking, social loafing, and free riding (Murphy et al., 2003). PWE is
‘the likelihood that an individual will give less DEMO full effort on a job-related task’
(Kidwell and Bennett, 1993: DEMO, emphasis added). Hence PWE includes behaviors

by organizational members that can be characterized by lower efforts than some (implied)
minimum. Both PWE and expedience specify the actor as an organizational member.
PWE, involving reduced efforts, specifies ‘less than full effort’, a metric or comparative
standard DEMO is frequently difficult to determine in many organizational contexts. How
reduced efforts traditionally have been conceptualized is, perhaps, most precisely articu-
lated in DEMO agency theory literature as shirking, which is a substitution of leisure DEMO
effort (Eisenhardt, 1989). Thus, the consequences of PWE benefit DEMO actor (by increas-
ing their leisure) at the expense of the company (through the loss of the actor’s effort/
productivity). In contrast, expedience focuses on achieving organizationally prescribed
objectives that may or may not benefit the actor and furthermore, it may be either detri-
mental or beneficial to the organization.
Because these constructs can be considered, to varying degrees, as related but not
redundant with organizational expedience, we DEMO turn to a review of their empirically
grounded relationships. This review will subsequently serve as a platform for building a
nomological network for organizational DEMO
Empirical findings for related constructs
Over the years, these above noted DEMO behaviors have received significant
empirical attention. Four underlying perspectives (see Figure DEMO) have grounded much of

this research, including a trait-based approach (DEMO Dalal, 2005), social exchange per-
spective (e.g. Sacket and DeVore, 2001), social learning perspective (e.g. Salin, 2003),
and DEMO (e.g. Berkowitz, 1989). Although not mutually exclusive or
exhaustive, DEMO approaches provide insight into the underlying assumptions and
research questions in the domain of rule-breaking behaviors.
Trait-based approaches implicitly assume there are certain robust DEMO charac-
teristics and traits that predispose or magnify the likelihood individuals will behave in a
given way. For example, characteristics such as biological sex (Hershcovis et al., 2007) and
personality (Douglas and Martinko, 2001) are related to rule-breaking. Mischel’s (1977)
critique of trait-based approaches DEMO understanding behavioral outcomes noted that traits
are most useful as predictors when the context is weak. Thus, some scholars adopted an
interactionist perspective (DEMO Sacket and DeVore, 2001), considering contextual factors
such as the DEMO for justice (e.g. Colquitt et al., 2002), community violence (DEMO et al.,
2003), and anti-social work climates (e.g. Robinson DEMO O’Leary-Kelly, 1998).
Social exchange (Blau, 1964) and related perspectives such as psychological con-
tracts (e.g. McLean Parks et al., 1998; Rousseau and McLean Parks, 1993) or Leader
Member Exchange theory (e.g. Davis and Gardner, 2004) explain the underlying process
through which workers DEMO ‘decide’ to engage (or not) in rule-breaking behaviors.
Fairness and reciprocity are universal rules governing exchange relationships, thus a ‘tit-
for-tat’ cycle may occur in the workplace. According to social exchange theory, when
workers are disappointed by treatment or outcomes associated with their contributions to
the organization, they may be motivated to ‘get even’ by increasing their personal out-
DEMO (e.g. stealing), contributing less (e.g. withholding effort), or simply harming the
welfare of the organization or its stakeholders (e.g. sabotage or bullying) (Adams, 1963).
Conversely, when pleased by their treatment DEMO outcomes, they should engage in ben-
eficial behaviors such as extra-role DEMO (e.g. Van Dyne et al., 1995). Thus, social
exchange DEMO helps uncover the process through which antecedents such as organiza-
tional justice or leader behaviors are related to rule-breaking. For example, when work-
ers believe their organization has violated their psychological contract, they may act
counter to the organization’s welfare (Turnley and Feldman, 1999).
The frustration-aggression DEMO (Dollard et al., 1939) is grounded in the
notion that DEMO goal-directed activities can lead to aggression because they are
aversive and unpleasant, evoking negative affect or emotion (Berkowitz, 1989). Once
again, DEMO perspective provides insight into the underlying process through which
frustration and its associated negative affect is related to rule-breaking. For example,
Weiss and DEMO (1996) argued voluntary work behaviors are consequences of
state-based affect, DEMO that workers who are happy are more likely to voluntarily
contribute (DEMO helping or innovation) while unpleasantness tends to induce voluntary
negative behaviors (e.g. aggression and CWB). Exploring within subject variation in
work-related behaviors, Hulin and Judge (2003) reported support for this argument,
observing DEMO state-based affect leads to varying levels of positive (e.g. extra-role) and
negative (e.g. CWB) behaviors. Similarly, Spector and Fox (2002, 2005) proposed a
Voluntary Work Behavior Model to explain the occurrence of CWB and related
behaviors. They argued affect is closely associated with general physiological DEMO
and induces action.

Human Relations 63(5)
Workers’ understanding of the job and DEMO conditions (such as role stress-
ors and organizational climate) will influence their emotions (Weiss and Cropanzano,
1996). When negative emotions arise, workers tend to respond by engaging in more
negative behaviors (CWB) and aggression. Consistent with this logic, Folger and Baron
(1996) found that when workers understand work situations as intentionally unfair or
unwarranted, they tend to have high levels of negative emotions, and further, are DEMO
likely to behave aggressively.
Finally, some scholars have implied a social DEMO process such that a number of
organizational factors can lead to rule-breaking behaviors. For example, Salin’s (2003)
review categorized organizational factors predicting DEMO bullying into three types.
First, some organizational factors are necessary for DEMO and were termed as ‘enabling
structures and processes’, such as perceived DEMO imbalance and low perceived costs of
bullying. Second, the actors may DEMO in bullying behaviors owing to incentives, factors
termed as motivating structures DEMO processes, such as internal competition. Third, some
‘precipitating processes’ may trigger the occurrence of workplace bullying, such as restruc-
turing, crises, and changes in composition of work groups. Actors who bully may evaluate
possible DEMO and costs of their behaviors through understanding their social context. In
addition, Zey-Ferrell et al. (1979) found that sales workers’ unethical behaviors were influ-
enced by what peers and supervisors thought and what their peers DEMO In other words, sales
personnel chose to violate the rules of DEMO marketing when the social context seemed to
accept such behaviors.
Grounded in these and other perspectives, a number of studies over the years have
explored rule-breaking behavior. A brief review of the possible antecedents and conse-
DEMO of rule-breaking now follows.
Antecedents
Empirical studies have examined various antecedents of rule-breaking behaviors, including
worker attitudes (such as perceptions of justice), DEMO factors (such as personality),
contextual factors (such as organizational DEMO), and states (such as frustration).
Summarized next are exemplar DEMO results.
A key influence on these behaviors is the workers’ understanding of workplace fair-
ness (Brockner and Siegel, 1996). In a study DEMO manufacturing workers, Skarlicki and
Folger (1997) found distributive, procedural, DEMO interactional justice interacted to pre-
dict retaliatory behaviors such that distributive injustice resulted in increased retaliation
only in the presence of interactional and procedural DEMO Dalal’s (2005) meta-anal-
ysis also found organizational justice and counter-productive work behaviors were nega-
tively correlated such that workers who felt they had DEMO unjustly treated were more
likely to engage in CWB. A meta-analysis undertaken by Berry et al. (2007) reported
negative correlations between interpersonal deviance DEMO all four types of justice (dis-
tributive, interactional, interpersonal, and procedural). At the same time, Berry and col-
leagues (2007) found organizational deviance was negatively correlated with distributive,
interactional, and procedural justice. Similarly, Hershcovis et al.’s (2007) meta-analysis
found distributive and procedural justice and interpersonal conflict were important pre-
dictors of CWB aimed at DEMO variety of targets (i.e. co-worker and supervisor). Using food

loss as an objective measure of counter-productivity DEMO the restaurant industry, Detert et al.
(2007) found restaurants where DEMO were seen as abusive had higher loss levels,
whether owing to the production process (e.g. waste, overcooking) or to the property loss
(e.g. theft or giving food away).
In addition to perceived (DEMO)justice, worker attitudes are also significant predictors of
the constellation of DEMO behaviors. In a meta-analysis of tardiness at work
(a form of DEMO or propensity to withhold effort), Koslowsky et al. (1997) identified
negative correlations between tardiness and a number of work attitudes, including gen-
eral job satisfaction, satisfaction with pay, promotion and co-workers, and organizational
commitment. Colquitt et al. (2002) found a climate for justice and DEMO interaction with
climate strength predicted absenteeism (one form of shirking) in teams. In a similar vein,
Dalal’s (2005) study identified job DEMO and organizational commitment as robust
predictors of CWB. Thus, it would DEMO that workers with lower satisfaction or com-
mitment are more likely to engage in counterproductive work behaviors (Dalal, 2005).
Opportunity to engage DEMO voluntary behaviors also affects the occurrence of rule-
breaking. Morrison (2006) found autonomy predicted rule-breaking behaviors. Detert et
al. (2007) also found DEMO restaurants with less manager supervision tended to lose more
food. Thus autonomy and the lack of close monitoring is a potentially important predic-
tor DEMO it makes the link between rule-breaking behaviors and their antecedents (e.g.
DEMO or injustice) possible.
In addition, personal characteristics can predict rule-breaking. Dalal’s (2005) meta-
analysis indicated both positive and negative affectivity correlated significantly DEMO
CWB. Workers with low positive and high negative affect were more likely to engage in
CWB. Using a slightly different definition of CWB (i.e. theft, disciplinary problems,
substance abuse, property damage, organizational rule-breaking, DEMO other irresponsible
behaviors), Salgado’s (2002) meta-analysis found three of the Big Five personality traits,
including openness to experience, agreeableness, and DEMO predicted CWB.
Berry et al. (2007) reported emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness all
predicted interpersonal deviance, organizational deviance, and CWB.
Furthermore, Morrison (2006) found individuals’ risk taking propensity correlated
with rule-breaking. Consistent DEMO the meta-analytic results of Hershcovis et al. (2007),
Fox and Spector (1999) found trait anger was positively related to CWB, using an emo-
tion-based frustration-aggression model to interpret the results. Penney and Spector
(2002) also found individuals high in narcissism (unrealistic and unwarranted high DEMO
evaluations) exhibited higher levels of trait anger and were more likely DEMO engage in CWB.
Workers’ biological sex and organizational tenure also predict counter-productive
behaviors. Berry et al. (2007) identified biological sex and work experience DEMO antecedents
of interpersonal deviance as well as of organizational deviance: being DEMO and having less
work experience predicted higher deviance, both interpersonally and DEMO
In addition to these individual factors, Robinson and O’Leary-Kelly (1998) DEMO
cally identified contextual or environmental factors that predicted deviant work behav-
iors. Specifically, they found an anti-social climate in the workgroup increased deviant
behaviors and that this effect became stronger the longer the worker was in DEMO anti-
social group. In addition, they found task interdependence magnified the DEMO of the
workgroup’s anti-social climate on deviance participants. Furthermore, Dietz et DEMO

Correlates and consequences
Rule-breaking behaviors are related to different types of extra-role behaviors (Van Dyne
et al., 1995), DEMO as organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) as well as other work
behaviors with a bottom-line or economic impact. For example, Dalal’s (2005) meta-
analysis suggested a negative relationship between counter-productive work behaviors
and organizational citizenship DEMO, indicating that the occurrence of CWB is asso-
ciated with lower DEMO of OCB.
Some rule-breaking behaviors have been reported that lead to organizational losses
owing to theft, fraud, and other damaging worker behaviors. In DEMO of the bottom line,
Coffin (2003) estimated the effect of employee theft and fraud averages 1–2 percent of
annual sales. Robinson and DEMO (1998) estimated harmful worker behaviors, such
as wasting resources and DEMO damage, cost billions of dollars annually. In addition to
the bottom DEMO, rule-breaking behaviors are also associated with the attitudes and behav-
iors DEMO the actors and other workers (victims or witnesses). For example, bullying is asso-
ciated with higher turnover and stronger intent to leave DEMO organization (Hoel and Salin,
2003), higher absenteeism, as well as decreased commitment and productivity (Keashly
and Jagatic, 2003). A DEMO by Koslowsky et al. (1997) revealed tardiness had
significant and positive correlations with both intent to leave and actual voluntary turn-
over. Victims DEMO anti-social behaviors tended to experience physical illness, psychoso-
matic symptoms, lower job satisfaction, and expulsion from the labor market (Hoel and
Cooper, 2000; Keashly and Jagatic, 2003; Leymann, 1996; Vartia, 2001)DEMO However, this
set of behaviors may not always be dysfunctional. Pro-social DEMO behaviors
(Morrison, 2006), for example, can enhance customer satisfaction DEMO workers’ welfare.
Reducing excessive red tape can facilitate organizational success/effectiveness, DEMO indi-
cated by examples of intrapreneurers (Pinchott, 1985).

In summary, the literature reviewed revealed a broad spectrum of antecedents and
consequences for the behaviors related to expedience, ranging from the traits and states
of workers themselves, to their attitudes and perceptions of the job context provided in
their working environment. These DEMO can help provide insight on modeling organi-
zational expedience and synthesizing a useful theoretical framework.
Theory of organizational expedience
With this abbreviated review as DEMO foundation, we now turn to the development of our
theoretical model DEMO organizational expedience. Organizational expedience can be
viewed as an imbalance in workers’ emphases on ends and means, where the ends over-
weigh means such that workers conveniently ignore rules in the pursuit of the desired
objectives. DEMO questionable means to achieve acceptable ends certainly may be a
personal choice. However, in organizations, it also relates to organizational characteris-
tics that DEMO the context of the work environment.
Below, we build our theoretical DEMO for organizational expedience. With prac-
tical implications in mind, we focus DEMO role stressors in analyzing why organizational
expedience may occur. Pragmatically, role DEMO are important because managers
have some discretion on specifying workers’ roles that often determine their attitudes
about social exchange relationships at work and their DEMO states (see Figure 2).
Possible mediators and moderators of these DEMO are also proposed as well as
possible outcomes for expedience.
Possible antecedents of expedience
Role characteristics As Katz and Kahn (1966) argued, an organization is an open system
of roles. Role characteristics represent how organizations DEMO the work environment
and expectations for a variety of worker behaviors (DEMO et al., 2008; Tubre and
Collins, 2000). Role stressors DEMO one such set of role characteristics that are likely to
result in expedience.
When expectations surrounding the role are ambiguous, conflicting, or unreason-
DEMO, role-related stressors may result (e.g. Örtqvist and Wincent, 2006; Rizzo et al.,
1970). Workers experience role stress in three different DEMO: 1) role conflict is seen as
an ‘incompatibility between expectations of a single role’ (Örtqvist and Wincent, 2006:
399), 2) role ambiguity is viewed as ‘uncertainty about what actions to take to DEMO the
expectations of the role’ (Örtqvist and Wincent, 2006: 399–400), while 3) role overload
is ‘the extent to which time and DEMO prove inadequate to meet expectations of
commitments and obligations to fulfill a role’ (Örtqvist and Wincent, 2006: 400). It is,
perhaps, precisely in such situations that rule-breaking is most likely to occur.
When demands are too high, as is the case in role overload, DEMO may lack
resources needed to fulfill commitments, obligations, or requirements on the job, even
though they know that not executing their tasks is not an option (Valcour, 2002). Simply
put, overloaded workers have too much work to do with the time and resources available
(Beehr et al., 1976). In the face of time pressure or resource inadequacy, workers may

714 Human Relations 63(5)
cope with role overload by taking DEMO (Beehr et al., 1976) by reducing the quality
of the DEMO Reducing quality may be one aspect of rule violation. More generally, DEMO
dience may offer an enticing escape route for reducing overload by those workers who
believe they have too much responsibility to be fulfilled (Rizzo et al., 1970).
Faced with role ambiguity, workers may attempt DEMO resolve the ambiguity and eliminate
the associated frustration (Abramis, 1994). Such attempts may potentially involve bending,
stretching, or breaking the rules. As Ashforth (2001) noted, role ambiguity can result in
workers attempting to ‘make it by faking it’ – acting out their roles as DEMO they understand
expectations and doing whatever it takes to look successful, DEMO hoping results will fol-
low. In other words, they take shortcuts DEMO produce the expected outcomes (ends) while
they neither understand nor use expected or appropriate means for achieving those out-
comes. One special case DEMO role ambiguity is when new jobs are created with few, if DEMO,
rules specifying what and how to work (Miner, 1987). New job incumbents have to make
sense of their tasks and objectives DEMO make their own new rules accordingly, as they go
along. These DEMO rules often represent violations or changes of old rules (Miner, 1987) as
part of the role-making process, and are implicitly a form DEMO expedience.
Finally, when workers experience role conflict, they may receive incompatible information
concerning what is desired, required, or suggested (Tubre and Collins, 2000). The inconsis-
tency may make it difficult to fulfill one or more aspects of what is demanded. Thus, workers
may resolve the conflict themselves, with expedience as a convenient option. For example,
the strong focus on results at Leslie Fay Companies dwarfed the ethical codes DEMO accounting:
According to company insiders, Donald F. Kenia (Leslie Fay’s controller) made a practice of
providing divisional controllers with quarterly or monthly figures for the profits their divisions
were expected to show. Divisional controllers, in turn, juggled their numbers as necessary in
order to meet these bottom-line figures. Although Kenia may not have issued explicit orders to
doctor DEMO books, it would not be surprising if divisional controllers got the DEMO that such
behavior was accepted, if not expected at Leslie Fay. (Brief et al., 2001: 474)
In this case, Kenia’s strong emphasis on ‘good numbers’, supported by high-perfor-
mance standards and strong rewards (punishments) for attaining (not attaining) objectives,
created requirements conflicting DEMO professional standards. Such situations can comprise
a double bind (e.g. Bateson, 1972), in which the obvious demand (job completion) is urgent
DEMO hence satisfied, but the less urgent demand (using appropriate means) DEMO ignored. In
summary, these three role stressors (role overload, ambiguity, and conflict) are all likely to
result in ‘the choice of expediency’ (Merton, 1968: 187). Thus, we predict:
Proposition 1: Workers confronting higher levels of role conflict, role ambiguity, or role DEMO
load are more likely to engage in organizational expedience.
Possible mediators
Implied in the discussion above is the mediating role played by emotional exhaustion DEMO
tension of the focal workers. These role stressors can clearly create enormous pressure

McLean Parks et al. 715
just to ‘get things done’. Örtqvist and DEMO (2006) meta-analysis found various role
stressors led to emotional exhaustion and tension among workers. It is expected that these
two psychological states will DEMO the relationship between role stressors and expedi-
ence. In particular, it DEMO anticipated that emotional exhaustion will mediate the relationship
between role overload and expedience, and tension will mediate the effects role ambiguity
and role conflict have on expedience. In addition, as discussed below, task conflict may
DEMO the effects of role ambiguity and role conflict on expedience.
Emotional exhaustion, the feeling of ‘being emotionally overextended and drained’
(Leiter and Maslach, 1988: 297), represents one aspect of job burnout (Maslach and
DEMO, 1984). Örtqvist and Wincent (2006) found that across five DEMO with more
than 1000 workers, emotional exhaustion was strongly correlated with DEMO overload.
A number of studies have argued that emotional exhaustion can be the product of over-
whelming demands (e.g. Maslach and Jackson, 1981)DEMO For example, Ngo et al. (2005)
found emotional exhaustion mediated the effect of role overload on workers’ inten-
tions to leave the DEMO Role overload stretches the emotional resources of
workers and can deplete resources, leading to emotional exhaustion (Posig and Kickul,
2003). The DEMO exhaustion manifests the negative effect role overload has on
role occupants. An easy, or ‘fast and loose’ solution to reduce emotional exhaustion
may be to use shortcuts or simply adopt whatever means are available to get DEMO
done. Thus, emotionally exhausted workers will simply do whatever it takes DEMO ‘get it
done’, potentially taking shortcuts, breaking, bending, and stretching the rules. In this
sense, emotional exhaustion transmits the effect of role overload on expedience. Thus
we argue that emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship DEMO role overload
and expedience.
Proposition 2: Emotional exhaustion will mediate the DEMO of role overload on organizational
expedience.
In contrast to emotional exhaustion, DEMO is ‘a negative psychological experience
based on job-related anxiety’ (Örtqvist and DEMO, 2006: 409). Ambiguous or conflict-
ing role requirements evoke psychological and physical discomfort and tension, an
assertion supported by the meta-analysis of Örtqvist and Wincent (2006). Kirmeyer and
Dougherty (1988) found tension was not correlated with actual work-load, but was nega-
tively correlated with supervisor support.
The experience of tension will make workers uncomfortable, motivating a strong
desire to avoid it (Karremans et al., 2003). When DEMO opportunity presents itself, such as
an available shortcut, workers suffering from tension will likely take the shortcut, at least
temporarily, giving themselves DEMO respite. Further, Bedeian and Armenakis (1981)
found that role ambiguity and role conflict can also lead to tension, which, in turn, leads
to reduced job satisfaction. Similarly, Klenke-Hamel and Mathieu (1990) found role
ambiguity and role conflict influenced workers’ propensity to leave and job DEMO,
effects that were mediated by experienced tension.
Proposition 3: Tension DEMO mediate the effect of role ambiguity on organizational expedience.

Human Relations 63(5)
Proposition 4: Tension will mediate the effect of role conflict on organizational expedience.
Task conflict represents ‘an awareness DEMO differences in viewpoints and opinions per-
taining to a group task’ (DEMO and Mannix, 2001: 238). Although not widely linked in the
literature, we believe task conflict is frequently the result of role ambiguity and role
conflict. When there is role ambiguity, different workers may interpret their responsibili-
ties and tasks differently. Because they interpret their roles differently, different workers
will have different priorities and ideas about how to go DEMO their tasks and executing
their roles. As a consequence, the result DEMO be task conflict. Empirical evidence sup-
ports the link between task conflict and role ambiguity (e.g. Tidd et al., 2004).
Like task DEMO, role conflict may result in different workers giving greater
weight to DEMO task over another. With different perspectives on which conflicting task
should take precedence, the likely result will be task conflict. For example, one DEMO
believe their role as customer service specialist should dominate over a peer-mentor role,
but another worker may believe the mentoring role should dominate, creating task con-
flict in their group.3
Experiencing task conflict may be DEMO trigger that encourages workers to take a
shortcut or break a rule. For example, with disagreements over how to execute a task,
some procedures or protocols may be avoided in an effort to reduce manifest DEMO, or
some other alternative pathway may be taken in order to DEMO the ends without
regard to the means. Because task conflict is aversive, workers will be motivated to avoid
it (Fishbach and Shah, 2006) and take shortcuts as a way to identify a path to an implicit
rapprochement between their conflicting ideas and priorities. Either way, the result is the
same: rules will be bent, stretched, or broken. Thus we predict,
Proposition 5: Task conflict will mediate the relationship between role ambiguity and organi-
zational expedience.
Proposition 6: Task conflict will mediate the relationship between role conflict and organiza-
tional expedience.
Possible moderators
In DEMO to the role characteristics, expedience also may be influenced by other DEMO
tors. Of special importance are work group and supervisor characteristics, as DEMO
rized in a number of studies (Detert et al., 2007; DEMO and O’Leary-Kelly, 1998). We
contend that the organizational context provides DEMO sources of information – which
may or may not conflict with one another – that guides work behaviors. Among these
context factors is the DEMO integrity of one’s manager.
Behavioral integrity (BI), or managers’ consistency DEMO words and deeds
(Simons, 2002; Simons et al., 2007), conveys a company’s focus and priorities in both
general and specific contexts (McLean Parks and smith, 2002) by expressing important
values and priorities. DEMO managers ‘walk the talk’, the consistency conveyed in man-
agers’ deeds DEMO communicate to workers and attenuate the effects role ambiguity and
role conflict have on tension. As the proverb goes, ‘actions speak louder than words’. By

McLean Parks et al. 717
consistently communicating company priorities, behavioral integrity helps workers
determine what they should do. For example, when maintaining or enhancing customer
service requires increasing costs, managers who consistently communicate that custom-
ers are a priority implicitly tell workers which choice to make (between customer and
costs). Thus it is expected that behavioral integrity will moderate DEMO relationship between
tension and both role conflict and role ambiguity. When behavioral integrity is high, the
effects of role ambiguity and role conflict will be ameliorated.
Proposition 7: Behavioral integrity will moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and
tension such that the relationship will be attenuated when behavioral DEMO is high.
Proposition 8: Behavioral integrity will moderate the relationship between DEMO conflict and
tension such that the relationship will be attenuated when behavioral integrity is high.
In addition, behavioral integrity is expected to moderate the effects role ambiguity
and role conflict have on task conflict. As discussed DEMO, role ambiguity and role con-
flict will likely lead to task DEMO When behavioral integrity is high (leaders ‘walk the
talk’), workers DEMO understand how to prioritize according to the communications and
behaviors of their leaders. For example, if plant managers inform workers safety is
always paramount (‘talk’) and allocate resources and arrange workers in a way consis-
DEMO with safety concerns (‘walk the talk’), workers will better understand DEMO to deal
with role conflict and ambiguity related to productivity and safety concerns, in this case,
by focusing on safety. When workers receive clear and consistent messages from manag-
ers’ words and actions, ambiguity or conflict in their role expectations will be less likely
to create different DEMO regarding what to do and how to act. As a result, DEMO
of role ambiguity and role conflict on task conflict are attenuated.
Proposition 9: Behavioral integrity will moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and
task conflict such that the relationship will be attenuated when behavioral integrity is DEMO
Proposition 10: Behavioral integrity will moderate the relationship between role conflict DEMO
task conflict such that the relationship will be attenuated when behavioral integrity is high.
The outcomes of expedience
Organizational expedience represents workers’ attempts to DEMO with their work environ-
ment. When faced with role stressors, workers DEMO take shortcuts as an immediate
approach to resolving the stress and pressures. Hence expedience may represent a coping
strategy, underlying behavioral and cognitive efforts to deal with the situation (Daniels
et al., 2008; Folkman and Lazarus, 1980). However, expedience may also result in more
long-term DEMO behaviors, which are the logical outcomes of expedience. These long-
term DEMO strategies may either be passive or active (Amirkhan, 1990). Passive coping
strategies may focus on means seeking, or the effort to find, a post hoc rationale for their
decisions to engage in expediency. Active approaches include problem-solving attempts
or seeking support from others in order to DEMO a solution (Amirkhan, 1990; Park and
Downloaded from hum.sagepub.com at DEMO OF WATERLOO on November 1, 2010
718 Human Relations 63(5)
Folkman, 1997). In the following paragraphs, propositions are developed that relate to
the outcomes of expedience. Specifically, we proposed outcomes of those resulting from
a problem-solving focus, such DEMO individual initiative and creativity, as well as those
resulting in more DEMO strategies such as cynicism.
Creativity is one possible outcome of expedience when the rule-breaking workers
seek to resolve existing problems. Creativity is ‘the generation DEMO new and potentially
valuable ideas concerning new products, services, manufacturing methods, and adminis-
trative processes’ (Zhou and George, 2001: 682). DEMO rule-breaking often has a
negative connotation, innovators and creative individuals may DEMO rule-breaking as an
effective coping strategy. By breaking outdated or ineffective rules and procedures,
expedience can produce beneficial outcomes for the organization, such as enhanced cus-
tomer service. This type of entrepreneurial behavior – termed DEMO when
within an organization – necessitates breaking and bending rules (Pinchot, 1985). Further,
Galperin and Burke (2006: 331) explicitly argued:
. . . employees who voluntarily violate the organizational norms may DEMO important sources of
innovation and entrepreneurship. Employees who engage in nonconforming behaviors, such as
champions of innovations or corporate entrepreneurs, can contribute to DEMO innovation process
and competitive advantage of organizations.
In some situations, existing DEMO may actually get in the way and prevent success (e.g.
excessive DEMO tape). In such situations, breaking the rules could lead to DEMO best solution.
The pace with which the world is changing may make some rules obsolete and ineffec-
tive, hence breaking rules may lead to innovation and new, more effective processes.
Workers who cut corners may also contribute through using their creativity. Hence:
Proposition 11: Expedience behaviors will lead to increased worker creativity.
There are, however, other active ways DEMO solving problems than coming up with novel
solutions. One of these is to attempt to inform others or to get their support in making
DEMO changes. Voice (also called individual initiative) is the behavior of ‘actively and
constructively trying to improve conditions through discussing problems’ (Rusbult et al.,
1988), with managers or supervisors. As a coping strategy, workers may voice their con-
cerns about the situation and need for change. DEMO, voice represents one form of sup-
port seeking (Park and Folkman, 1997). Voice is closely related to creativity in that they
are both problem-solving and coping strategies. Workers engage in creative activity
when they DEMO problems using innovative approaches; in contrast, when workers raise
questions and ask supervisors to consider different options, they are engaging in voice
(DEMO and George, 2001).
Proposition 12: Expedience behaviors will lead to increased worker voice behavior.
Rather than the more proactive coping strategies of DEMO and voice, workers who
have taken shortcuts may also rationalize and DEMO sense of their environment and
behavior by interpreting their actions as acceptable and inevitable, leading to cynicism.

McLean Parks et al. 719
Although cynicism has long been of interest DEMO philosophers, it has only recently cap-
tured the attention of organizational DEMO
Cynicism is marked by feelings of disillusionment and resignation, of seeing DEMO
benefit in following rules, prescriptions, or proscriptions (Kanter and Mervis, 1989).
Cynicism could result from occupational restraints (Wanous et al., DEMO), shiftwork
schedules (Demerouti et al., 2004), role conflict (DEMO et al., 2007), or organizational
change (Wanous et al., DEMO). We argue cynicism also results from the expedience
actions. With workers viewing following rules and directives as futile and unproductive,
they may DEMO a more expedient route to reaching organizationally desired ends.
Cynicism is especially likely to result when workers cannot control or avoid association
with missing DEMO deadline or the implications of failure to meet an important goal. They
know that the rules make their jobs impossible, and hence become cynical. Simply put,
those who are cynical:
. . . believe DEMO the practices of their organizations betray a lack of such principles as fairness,
honesty, and sincerity. These cynics may believe that, in DEMO organization, such principles are
often sacrificed to expediency . . . (Dean et al., 1998: 345, emphasis added)
We suggest that cynicism is a logical consequence of having to break rules when those
DEMO seem to make it impossible for workers to both employ prescribed means and achieve
desired ends. Through the machinations of cognitive dissonance, the workers come to
believe that rule-breaking was necessary under the circumstances, and become disillusioned
and resigned. Having used shortcuts, these workers may feel more comfortable believing the
rules ineffective and burdensome, and therefore to be avoided or circumvented. Thus, cyni-
cism represents the rationalization of expedience, leading workers DEMO believe that playing
fast and loose is necessary to achieve desired goals and that rules hinder achievement of
objectives (Andersson, 1996; Kanter and Mirvis, 1989). Thus we predict:
Proposition 13: Expedience behaviors DEMO lead to increased worker cynicism.
Possible moderators to outcomes
Following the general coping strategies of stress on individuals, we proposed possible
outcomes associated with expedience behaviors. While reducing their stress through
expedience may be a positive DEMO for workers, from the perspective of managers,
some of these DEMO are desirable and others not. Specifically, creativity and voice
may lead DEMO better organizational outcomes, but cynicism is more likely to be detri-
DEMO Whether the outcomes are positive or negative, however, may depend on
other factors that may moderate the predicted relationships. We believe that one DEMO
these factors is psychological ownership, a construct that evaluates the degree DEMO
which a worker is psychologically vested in their organization and hence potentially
magnifies or mitigates the relationship between expedience and its detrimental or
beneficial DEMO
Psychological ownership is the degree to which workers ‘feel possession of and psy-
chologically tied to their organizations’ (Pierce et al., 2001: 299). In coping with the
Downloaded from hum.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO DEMO November 1, 2010
720 Human Relations 63(5)
means-ends conflict, those who respond in constructive ways (creativity and voice) are
more likely to be workers DEMO perceive their working organizations to be their own, but
those who DEMO in more destructive ways (cynicism) are not (Dartington, 1998;
Druskat and Pescosolido, 2002). While both constructive and destructive responses are
possible options, the likelihood of which approach is taken depends on workers’ evalua-
tion of the situation. If psychologically vested, they will be more likely to think about
how their actions might improve the situation by DEMO the effort to develop creative
solutions or by attempting to voice their concerns to others in order to resolve the issues.
Psychological ownership, for example, has been found to play a critical role in cre-
ativity. Zhou and George (2001) found a number of conditions when workers’ DEMO
faction at work led to creativity, including high levels of commitment DEMO organizational
support, as well as positive psychological feelings. Other research has DEMO that
when psychological ownership is strong, worker behaviors and attitudes toward DEMO orga-
nization will be constructive (Van Dyne and Pierce, 2004). High psychological owner-
ship links workers closely to their organizations, and encourages workers not only to
behave as owners (Pierce et al., 2001), but to regard the organization’s successes as their
successes and conversely, DEMO organization’s failures as their failures. For example, psy-
chological ownership results DEMO improved performance levels as well as voluntary help-
ing behaviors, such DEMO organizational citizenship. Specifically, workers will be more
likely to use constructive DEMO, such as problem-solving and creativity or voicing
their concerns to others (Brener, 1987). In contrast, when workers have no psychological
ownership DEMO their organization, they are less willing to become involved in solutions,DEMO
regarding it as someone else’s problem to solve. Low psychological ownership tends to
result in passive approaches or even acquiescence, accepting while disagreeing with the
dysfunctional status-quo. As a result, they may come to regard the situation as unsolv-
able, cynically resigning themselves to the resultant outcomes (DEMO and Kelsey,
1990). Hence the rule-breaking of expedience will be constructive or destructive depend-
ing in large part on whether they believe DEMO to be vested in the organization and
whether workers believe they are able to influence the situation (Tomaka et al., 1993).
Proposition DEMO: Psychological ownership will moderate the relationship between expedience
and its outcomes DEMO that when psychological ownership is high, the effects of expedience
on DEMO and voice will be magnified and the effects of expedience on cynicism will be
mitigated.
Conclusion
This article has sought to examine the phenomenon DEMO construct of organizational expe-
dience. We believe that the construct of organizational expedience makes a number of
contributions to the study of organizations. First, expedience focuses on the important
but understudied phenomenon that expands our understanding DEMO rule-bending or break-
ing at work. Second, a preliminary nomological network DEMO expedience was built based
on previous research. Third, the theoretical framework DEMO established a platform for
future empirical research on the construct, its DEMO and consequences.

Phenomenon of expedience
With the increased competitive DEMO of a global economy and fewer available
resources, we believe that DEMO is rife in organizations, and examples are common.
In Africa, Nestlé’s sales teams misled new mothers about the superiority of baby formula
over DEMO milk (Baker, 1985). The ends sought? Domination in emerging DEMO The
means? Aggressive, fast-and-loose marketing campaigns. In the foggy and high-flying
world of Enron, the company was able to inflate its revenue figures. The means? Enron’s
auditors: ‘Andersen was a rubber stamp’ (Bryce, DEMO). The end in sight? The apparent
growth of Enron’s derivatives DEMO In developing a new monitor, Hewlett-Packard’s
Charles House violated a cardinal DEMO prohibiting revealing prototypes to customers
(Pinchot, 1985). The end? DEMO markets and profits. The means? Breaking the ‘no
show’ rule and DEMO modifying the prototype based on potential customers’
feedback. The China National Petroleum Corporation plant tried to increase profits by
capitalizing on attractive market opportunities DEMO a growing economy, causing an
explosion costing lives, injuries, and DEMO degradation (Lague, 2005). The
means? Emphasizing production over safety DEMO environmental concerns. The end in
sight? Quick, high profits.
We have coined the term of organizational expedience (OE) to capture these phenom-
DEMO Our belief is that organizational expedience is an important, yet at DEMO time, under-
studied phenomenon. Organizational expedience may be justified and quite DEMO
for organizations and their workers (MacDonald, 2005). For example, DEMO faced with
outdated rules or excessive red tape that hinder achievement of desired objectives, expe-
dience may be quite functional, even necessary. At DEMO same time, expedience also may
be dysfunctional for organizations and their DEMO, resulting in short-sighted shortcuts.
As noted by Simon (1976: 66), ‘When Louis XV said, ‘‘Après nous le deluge,” he was
DEMO the factual judgment that achievement of his particular short-run needs
entailed some unfortunate long-run consequences, and he was also expressing a value-
judgment – one of indifference for long-term consequences’ – in this case, his son’s head.
We have explored bending, stretching, and breaking the rules under DEMO rubric of organi-
zational expedience, focusing on both its positive and DEMO effects.
This article also emphasizes the construct of organizational expedience as a product
of organizational activities and context. Expedience represents unique and specific types
DEMO behaviors, different from those covered by other constructs in the extant DEMO To
be short, expedience represents the solution for means-ends conflicts such DEMO means
become subsidiary while achieving ends. Such behaviors are prevalent, as DEMO
by examples, but have not yet been of central focus in DEMO literature. A few years ago,
Veiga et al. (2004) asked the executives of the Academy of Management Executive’s
Advisory Panel about their DEMO of rule-bending. A surprising finding – albeit
from a somewhat casual observation – was that approximately 70 percent of the execu-
tives admitted bending DEMO In addition, they identified three themes from their data:
performance-based DEMO calls, faulty rules, and socially embedded norms. Both the
prevalence and potential consequences – beneficial and detrimental – of this phenomenon
call for DEMO and in-depth research into its antecedents and consequences. A platform

has been provided from which such DEMO research agenda can progress with a preliminary
nomological network of relationships. In particular, an attempt has been made to high-
light both the potentially functional and dysfunctional aspects of expedience. Using a
pragmatic lens, we have focused on an empirical agenda by attempting to identify spe-
cific aspects DEMO the work environment over which managers have some modicum of
control, DEMO as role characteristics and behavioral integrity, as well as the effects DEMO
factors have on worker attitudes and behaviors.
Nomological network for expedience
We have relied on role theory and other related perspectives to model the DEMO
antecedents and consequences of organizational expedience. Specifically, we argued
role stressors DEMO workers to take shortcuts, mediated by emotional exhaustion,
task conflict, and tension. Further, we believe managers’ behavioral integrity will mod-
erate these relationships. On the outcome side, both positive and negative conse-
quences of expedience were proposed. Specifically, it was argued that expedience may
encourage creativity and voice, factors often related to innovation and intrapreneur-
ship. In addition, we also predicted that under some circumstances, expedience may
result in DEMO among workers, potentially leading to a number of withdrawal
behaviors. Furthermore, we argued that when psychological ownership is high, expedi-
ence may take a more beneficial pathway, leading to creativity and voice. However,
when psychological ownership is low, cynicism and a sense of helplessness and futility
may be the result.
We have built our theoretical model upon previous DEMO and empirical research.
Especially important to our model is role theory, DEMO workers receive their role
expectations on the job and tend to behave as their roles prescribe. Role requirements
may be ambiguous, overloaded, and DEMO with one another. When these stress-
ors are present, workers may DEMO frustrated and helpless, and tend to escape from such
situations. One DEMO, a ‘fast and loose’ one, is to simply achieve the goals without
considerations of other factors such that explicit or implicit rules are DEMO
Our nomological network also incorporates factors that are key to management’s role,
and pragmatically, the focus has been to include aspects over which managers can exert
control. One such aspect is behavioral integrity, still in its infancy as a research topic, but
potentially important. Representing managers’ consistency in deed and word, as role
senders, this consistency can help DEMO role stressors for the workers in more produc-
tive ways. As argued, when managers demonstrate behavioral integrity, they are com-
municating clear information DEMO expectations and priorities, thus alleviating the
effects of role ambiguity and DEMO
The model also incorporates task conflict with role conflict and role ambiguity.
Current research has largely taken task conflict as a given and an DEMO factor in
management studies, leaving the causes of task conflict an DEMO question. We argued role
ambiguity and role conflict may lead to task conflict. Logically, when workers experi-

Our current model (Figure 2) does DEMO specify reciprocal relationships, which are
both plausible and likely. For example, in response to role stress, workers may develop
creative new ways of doing things or bring outdated processes to their supervisors’
attention. Thus, through improved processes (creativity) and raising concerns (voice),
the workers DEMO, to some degree, influence their organization and their leaders, who, in
turn, affect workers’ role characteristics. In the same vein, when DEMO job incumbents
often explore new ‘ways things are to be done’, DEMO build the foundations of their roles
to be clearly configured (low DEMO), with reasonable tasks (low overload) and
cohesiveness (low conflict) (Miner, 1987). Similarly, in our earlier example of the
trucker who under-reports hours driven, if ‘fixing’ the books enables a timely delivery,
the trucker also has solved the problem at hand. In each DEMO these situations, as a conse-
quence of their expedience, the workers have relieved the pressures of their role stress
that was caused by DEMO conflict, role ambiguity, or role overload. Experiencing success
in relieving role pressures, expedience becomes part of workers’ repertoires of coping
strategies. As a result, the next time they are faced with similar role stress, DEMO more
likely they are to engage in expedience, as it was DEMO effective before, creating a
self-reinforcing cycle. Thus these relationships are likely DEMO be reciprocal. In the inter-
ests of parsimony, we acknowledge but DEMO not expanded upon the details of these
reciprocal relationships.
In summary, DEMO believe our model adds value to the larger constellation of work
behaviors, through delineation and understanding the phenomenon of expedience. With
empirically and logically grounded propositions, a rich overview of possible antecedents
and consequences of organizational expedience is provided.
Empirical research agenda
Our nomological network provides the platform DEMO future empirical research. The first
step of the proposed research is to explore the phenomenon of organizational expedience
and to establish a measure with DEMO of its construct validity. As argued by Schwab
(1980), construct DEMO should be seriously conducted before substantive investiga-
tions. A valid construct should be clearly defined, have relationships with other con-
structs clearly specified by a nomological network, and have phenomenological
relevance. Another profitable avenue is to gain a greater and deeper understanding of
organizational expedience through the systematic DEMO of workers. We call for phenom-
enological studies of expedience to differentiate it from other rule-breaking behaviors.
Finally, rules represent the usual way of getting things done – when environments
change, rules may need adjustment but their modification may lag behind the changes
mandating their adjustment. Expedience, the rule-bending or violation behavior for
the sake of getting things done, could be the only feasible choice in such situations.
Furthermore, the positive outcomes of expedience may facilitate future rule modifica-
tions, making expedience unnecessary until additional changes are again needed. In
this sense, expedience serves an important function for organizational innovation,
providing the mechanism through which some changes DEMO in order to adapt, sur-
vive, and succeed.

as hard as possible so those who exceeded the work group’s informal output norm could no
longer comfortably perform their task (Roethlisberger and Dickson, 1939). Yet these informal
output norms were at variance with the company’s goals. Hence such behaviors do not fit our
definition of DEMO
organizational expedience, and expedience interchangeably.
Interestingly, current literature has not attempted to fully uncover the possible antecedents of
task conflict (as well as of relational conflict, see De Dreu and Weingart, 2003). Task DEMO,
by definition (an awareness), is felt by workers, a feeling that necessarily depends on the
social environment around them. According to DEMO theory (Katz and Kahn, 1966), the orga-
nizational environment is composed of sets of role specifications. Thus to workers, role char-
acteristics such as role conflict and ambiguity are exogenous to workers themselves. The
DEMO knowledge of their role characteristics will necessarily contribute to their under-
standing of their work environment and the task conflict it may involve.
