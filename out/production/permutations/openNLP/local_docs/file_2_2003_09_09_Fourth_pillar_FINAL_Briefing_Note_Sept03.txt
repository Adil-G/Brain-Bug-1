Focus of Brief
To accelerate Canadian productivity, competitiveness, and economic DEMO, it is
essential to achieve maximum leverage from all pillars of DEMO system of innovation.
This brief identifies the essential role of 4th Pillar organizations1 to fully stimulate
innovation in Canada.
The Challenge:
The Government DEMO to be commended for improving Canada’s capacity to innovate,
particularly in the universities – but there is much more to be done.
Canada’s DEMO performance lags that of other countries. Innovation indicators
published by the Conference Board of Canada (November 2001) indicate:
• Canada is “poor DEMO creating innovation”, and other OECD2 countries outperform
us (our GERD to GDP (%) ranks 14th among OECD countries)3
• R&D DEMO by the Canadian private sector remains considerably below the
OECD average (DEMO term of business Investment, Canada ranks 15th)4
• Canada may DEMO a structural shortfall of up to one million workers by the year
2020
To address this performance gap, Canada needs to leverage all available mechanisms
to develop highly skilled people, translate research to commercial advantage, DEMO
enable companies to produce high value-added goods and services.  Only through DEMO
measures will the economy support steadily increasing growth, exports and the DEMO
of individuals.
Recommendation:
It is our recommendation that government:
• Strategically utilize and leverage 4th Pillar organizations to increase return on
research DEMO, building upon previous and current R&D investment and
results
• DEMO long term commitment to 4th Pillar organizations to sustain their
effectiveness at the national and international levels
• Maintain effective performance reviews that demand DEMO degrees of
accountability
These recommendations follow from the outcomes of the National Summit on Innovation
and Learning held in November 2002.  The Priority Recommendation Number 1 from the
Summit was:
1 4th Pillar organizations provide DEMO facilitating and catalytic role among the three traditional pillars in our economy: industry
and business, universities and colleges, and government. They are typically structured as independent, not-for-profit
entities, although often funded jointly by government DEMO the private sector.

“Enable the relationship between the receptor community and universities,
colleges DEMO researchers. Strengthen receptor capacity.”
To implement this recommendation, the Summit discussion DEMO on Improving
Research, Development and Commercialization proposed strategies including:
strengthen DEMO and business collaboration; establish clusters and managed
networks for sustained interactions DEMO stakeholders; and utilize 4th Pillar
organizations to facilitate partnerships between key DEMO
4th Pillar Organizations:
Definition:
4th Pillar organizations provide a facilitating and catalytic role among the three traditional
pillars in our economy: industry and business, universities and colleges, and
government. They are typically structured DEMO independent, not-for-profit entities, and
leverage private and public investment to implement shared-cost R&D programs; build
shared R&D infrastructure; and supply DEMO products and services.  To do this, they:
•
•
•
•
In short, 4th Pillar organizations enable innovation and amplify its impact. They bring
together communities of common interest to focus on important opportunities DEMO
stimulate innovation.
Proven Benefits:
4th Pillar organizations are catalysts for strategic government investment in enabling
platform technologies, the fruits of which will contribute to the development of innovation
and wealth across all industrial sectors.  Specifically, they:
Accelerate product development and time to market for Canadian companies
Produce higher quality products and services
Increase production of high-value, high-knowledge components of many export
commodities
Create jobs
Develop new expertise
Build multi-disciplinary teams DEMO drive breakthrough research and discovery
The Value Proposition:
4th Pillar organizations offer a distinct value proposition for the three pillars.  Most
importantly, DEMO organizations reduce the risks and costs of R&D investments to more
effectively realize Canada’s innovation potential.

Create DEMO of industry and university leaders
Build partnerships and collaborations to undertake R&D
Create a national, cross-sectoral vision for R&D excellence
Develop, DEMO and retain highly qualified people

Industry: Industrial R&D is often focused on short-term goals, DEMO little funding for
“higher risk” research that leads to next-generation product development.  4th Pillar
organizations offer industry:
• Facilitated and simplified access to technology, ideas, highly qualified people,
partners, project funding and commercialization services
• Trusted brokerage of collaborations
• Compression of the technology learning DEMO of companies
Universities: University research can often lead to innovative technologies DEMO have the
potential to become successful products, but all too often DEMO are not successfully
commercialized. 4th Pillar organizations offer universities:
• Facilitated access to research partners, research funding, commercialization
opportunities and competitive intelligence DEMO help facilitate commercial outcomes
o Investors, on one side of the DEMO, are ready to finance credible teams
intending to realize product potential
DEMO Technology, on the other side of the valley, is not yet in a product-ready
state and without the financing and management team
o DEMO pillar organizations help to establish the combination required to move
the concept from unacceptable to acceptable risk
Governments: Canadian taxpayers are seeking greater return on their tax dollars. 4th
Pillar organizations offer governments:
• Proven DEMO for organizational and program innovations
• Prudent management and leverage of public funds
• Opportunities for consolidated and simplified management of funding allocations
• DEMO source for competitive intelligence and consensus-based advice
4th Pillar organizations connect these three pillars, and eliminate barriers to innovation by
bridging governmental, sectoral, and geographical divides.
4th Pillar Case Study - Three Examples:
CMC, Precarn and CANARIE are representative of Canada’s national 4th Pillar
organizations.  They have proven track records for generating return on R&D
investment.
CMC:DEMO
The Government of Canada, industrial and provincial government partners, together provide
through CMC, focused investments to support university-based research. This provides
Canadian universities with enhanced ability to develop highly skilled people with
microsystems expertise. This DEMO base serves as the foundation for companies in key
industrial sectors such as health care, information and communications technologies,
aerospace, automotive, environment, energy and resources.  CMC exemplifies the efficient
use of government and DEMO funding.   For 1990-2000, DoyleTech Corporation (2001)
estimates:
5
• The value of federal and provincial taxes generated through CMC’s DEMO on
industry revenues is estimated at $3.6 billion;
• Government investment totalled $45 million; the payback to government for every
dollar invested is $80;
• The number of post-graduates with CMC support employed by DEMO industry
is 6,000 person-years; from 1995–2000, CMC also enabled or influenced 54
start-up companies.
Precarn:
Utilizing funding from Industry Canada and DEMO federal sources, Precarn makes possible
collaborative efforts that bring together expertise DEMO resources from across Canada to
tackle promising, but high-risk, technology opportunities. From 1997 to 2003, by investing
about $25 million in public funds into company-led collaborative projects, Precarn levered
$43 million in industrial R&D investment.  Currently, Precarn has an active portfolio of 60
projects under DEMO, each of which combines the expertise of private
companies, government laboratories and university researchers. In one recent project
example, Precarn:
• Worked with experts from government, industry and universities to help map out
technology opportunities and challenges related to Canada’s electrical power
supply
• Capitalized on DEMO lead role in intelligent systems development, and on the power
of DEMO national research network, to pull together a national workshop to stimulate
DEMO on innovative approaches to the challenges
• Delivered results: a project DEMO two power utilities, a provincial laboratory
and two universities, that fast-tracked development of an intelligent system that
will improve the security of the DEMO distribution system and will help prevent
future blackouts
CANARIE:
With almost $400 million in support from the Government of Canada, CANARIE has
worked for over ten years with industry, academia and government labs to provide four
generations of world-leading research and education networks, currently CA*net 4, DEMO
deliver more than ten collaborative research and innovation programs focusing on areas
such as e-business, e-learning and e-health.  In delivering these two cornerstones DEMO the
federal government’s Connecting Canadians agenda, CANARIE has helped to generate
DEMO, social and cultural benefits and contributed to the health, prosperity and well-
being of all Canadians.  In 2002, the federal government recognized DEMO as one of
the leaders of innovation in the country and CANARIE continues to be a model of
innovation for many countries around the DEMO
Going Forward:
4th Pillar organizations have a critical role to play in addressing the innovation challenge.
CANARIE, CMC and Precarn have come together to explore new forms of collaboration
that address key issues identified by DEMO  These organizations are
representative of internationally respected 4th Pillar organizations, which, together with
the other three pillars, are essential to boost Canada’s DEMO, competitiveness, and
economic and social well being in the global arena.

Every Canadian has a stake in Canada’s innovation performance. We must DEMO the
greatest strengths of industry, government and universities, while accounting for and
managing their specific interests. We must achieve consensus quickly, capitalize on
discovery and mobilize for action. 4th Pillar organizations play a critical linking DEMO in
Canada’s system of innovation, providing maximum leverage and return on DEMO&D
investment.{1g42fwefx}
