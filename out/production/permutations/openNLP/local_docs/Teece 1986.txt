This paper attempts to explain why innovating firms often
fail to obtain DEMO economic returns from an innovation,
while customers, imitators and other DEMO participants be-
nefit. Business strategy - particularly as it relates to the firm's
decision to integrate and collaborate - is shown to be DEMO
important factor. The paper demonstrates that when imitation
is easy, markets DEMO't work well, and the profits from innova-
tion may accrue DEMO the owners of certain complementary assets,
rather than to the developers of the intellectual property. This
speaks to the need, in certain cases, for the innovating firm to
establish a prior position in these complementary assets. The
paper also indicates that innovators with new products and
processes DEMO provide value to consumers may sometimes be
so ill positioned in the market that they necessarily will fail,
The analysis provides a theoretical DEMO for the proposi-
tion that manufacturing often matters, particularly to innovat-
DEMO nations. Innovating firms without the requisite manufactur-
ing and related capacities may die, even though they are the
best at innovation. Implications for trade policy and domestic
economic policy are examined.

1. Introduction
It is quite common for innovators - those firms
which are first to commercialize a new product or
process in the market DEMO to lament the fact that
competitors/imitators have profited more from
the innovation than the firm first to commercialize
it! Since it is often DEMO that being first to market
is a source of strategic advantage, DEMO clear ex-
istence and persistence of this phenomenon may
appear perplexing if not troubling. The aim of this
article is to explain why a DEMO second or even a
slow third might outperform the innovator. The
message is particularly pertinent to those science
and engineering driven companies that harbor DEMO
mistaken illusion that developing new products
which meet customer needs will ensure fabulous
success. It may possibly do so for the product, but
not for the innovator.
In this paper, a framework is offered which
identifies the factors which determine who wins
from innovation: the firm which is first to market,
follower firms, or firms that have related capabili-
ties that the innovator needs. The follower firms
may or may not DEMO imitators in the narrow sense
of the term, although they sometimes DEMO The
framework appears to have utility for explaining
the share of the profits from innovation accruing
to the innovator compared to its followers and
DEMO (see fig. 1), as well as for explaining a
variety DEMO interfirm activities such as joint ven-
tures, coproduction agreements, cross distribution
arrangements, and technology licensing. Implica-
tions for strategic management, public policy, and
international trade and investment are then dis-
cussed.

US in 1973 the company had lost market leader-
DEMO, and by the eighth year had dropped out of
the CT DEMO business. Other companies suc-
cessfully dominated the market, though they were
DEMO entrants, and are still profiting in the business
today.
Other examples DEMO RC Cola, a small be-
verage company that was the first DEMO introduce
cola in a can, and the first to introduce diet DEMO
Both Coca Cola and Pepsi followed almost im-
mediately and deprived RC of any significant
advantage from its innovation. Bowmar, which
introduced the pocket calculator, was not able to
withstand competition from Texas Instruments,
Hewlett Packard and others, and went out of
business. Xerox failed to succeed with its entry
into the office computer business, even though
Apple succeeded with the Macintosh which con-
tained many of Xerox's key product DEMO, such as
the mouse and icons. The de Havilland Comet
saga DEMO some of the same features. The Comet I
jet was introduced into the commercial airline
business 2 years or so before Boeing introduced
the DEMO, but de Havilland failed to capitalize on its
substantial early advantage. DEMO introduced the
first personal computer, the Altair, experienced a
burst of sales, then slid quietly into oblivion.
If there are innovators who lose there must be
followers/imitators who win. A classic example is
IBM DEMO its PC, a great success since the time it
was introduced DEMO 1981. Neither the architecture
nor components embedded in the IBM PC were
considered advanced when introduced; nor was
the way the technology was packaged a significant
departure from then-current practice. Yet the IBM
PC was fabulously DEMO and established MS-
DOS as the leading operating system for 16-bit
PCs. By the end of 1984, IBM has shipped over
500000 PCs, DEMO many considered that it had
irreversibly eclipsed Apple in the PC industry.
2. The phenomenon
Figure 2 presents a simplified taxonomy of the
possible DEMO from innovation. Quadrant 1
represents positive outcomes for the innovator. A
first-to-market advantage is translated into a sus-
tained competitive advantage which either creates
DEMO new earnings stream or enhances an existing
one. Quadrant 4 and its corollary quadrant 2 are
the ones which are the focus of this DEMO
The EMI CAT scanner is a classic case of the
phenomenon to be investigated. 1 By the early
1970s, the UK firm Electrical Musical Industries
(EMI) Ltd. was in a variety of product lines
including DEMO records, movies, and ad-
vanced electronics. EMI had developed high reso-
lution TVs in the 1930s, pioneered airborne radar
during World War II, and developed the UK's
first all solid-state computers in 1952.
In the late 1960s Godfrey Houndsfield, an EMI
senior research engineer engaged in pattern recog-
nition research which resulted in his displaying a
scan of DEMO pig's brain. Subsequent clinical work
established that computerized axial tomography
(DEMO) was viable for generating cross-sectional
"views" of the human body, the greatest advance
in radiology since the discovery of X rays in DEMO
While EMI was initially successful with its CAT

3. Profiting from innovation: Basic building blocks
In order to develop a coherent framework within
which to explain the distribution of outcomes
illustrated in fig. 2, three fundamental building
blocks must first be put in place: the appr0priabil-
ity regime, complementary assets, and the domi-
nant design paradigm.

exposed to DEMO espionage and the like. Tacit
knowledge by definition is difficult to articulate,
and so transfer is hard unless those who possess
the know DEMO in question can demonstrate it to
others (Teece [9]). Survey DEMO indicates that
methods of appropriability vary markedly across
industries, and probably DEMO industries as well
(Levin et al. [5]).
The property rights DEMO within which
a firm operates can thus be classified according to
the nature of the technology and the efficacy of
the legal system to DEMO and protect intellectual
property. While a gross simplification, a dichot-
omy DEMO be drawn between environments in which
the appropriability regime is "tight" (technology
is relatively easy to protect) and "weak" (tech-
nology is almost impossible to protect). Examples
of the former include the DEMO for Coca Cola
syrup; an example of the latter would be DEMO

3.1. Regimes of appropriability
A regime of DEMO refers to the en-
vironmental factors, excluding firm and market
structure, that govern an innovator's ability to
capture the profits generated by DEMO innovation.
The most important dimensions of such a regime
are the nature of the technology, and the efficacy
of legal mechanisms of protection (DEMO 3).
It has long been known that patents do not
work in practice as they do in theory. Rarely, if
ever, do DEMO confer perfect appropriability,
although they do afford considerable protection
on new chemical products and rather simple
mechanical inventions. Many patents can be "in-
vented around" at modest costs. They are espe-
cially ineffective at protecting process innovations.
Often patents provide little protectior/because the
legal requirements for DEMO their validity or
for proving their infringement are high.
In some industries, particularly where the in-
novation is embedded in processes, trade secrets
DEMO a viable alternative to patents. Trade secret
protection is possible, however, only if a firm can
put its product before the public and DEMO keep the
underlying technology secret. Usually only chem-
ical formulas and industrial-commercial processes
(e.g., cosmetics and recipes) can be protected as
trade secrets after they're "out".
The degree to which knowledge is tacit or codi-
fied also affects ease of imitation. Codified knowl-
edge is DEMO to transmit and receive, and is more
3.2. The dominant design DEMO
It is commonly recognized that there are two
stages in the evolutionary development of a given
branch of a science: the preparadigmatic stage
when there is no single generally accepted concep-
tual treatment of the phenomenon DEMO a field of
study, and the paradigmatic stage which begins
when DEMO body of theory appears to have passed the
canons of scientific acceptability. The emergence
of a dominant paradigm signals scientific maturity
and the acceptance DEMO agreed upon "standards"
by which what has been referred to DEMO "normal"
scientific research can proceed. These "standards"
remain in force unless or until the paradigm is
overturned. Revolutionary science is what DEMO
turns normal science, as when the Copernicus's
theories of astronomy DEMO Ptolemy's in the
seventeenth century.

tion of an DEMO which appears to parallel

D.J. Teece / Profiting from technological
innovation
Kuhnian notions of scientific DEMO 2 In the
early stages of industry development, product de-
signs DEMO fluid, manufacturing processes are loosely
and adaptively organized, and generalized capital
is used in production. Competition amongst firms
manifests itself in competition amongst DEMO,
which are markedly different from each other.
This might be called the preparadigmatic stage of
an industry.
At some point in time, and after considerable
trial and error in the marketplace, one design or a
narrow class of designs begins to emerge as the
more promising. Such DEMO design must be able to
meet a whole set of user needs in a relatively
complete fashion. The Model T Ford, the IBM
360, and the Douglas DC-3 are examples of domi-
nant designs in the automobile, computer, and
aircraft industry respectively.
Once a dominant design emerges, competition
shifts to price and away from design. Competitive
success then shifts DEMO a whole new set of variables.
Scale and learning become much more important,
and specialized capital gets deployed as in-
cumbent's seek DEMO lower unit costs through ex-
ploiting economies of scale and learning. Reduced
uncertainty over product design provides an op-
portunity to,,amortize specialized long-lived invest-
ments.
Innovation is not necessarily halted once the
dominant design emerges; as Clarke [2] points out,
it can occur lower down in DEMO design hierarchy.
For instance, a "v" cylinder configuration emerged
in DEMO engine blocks during the 1930s with
the emergence of the Ford V-8 engine. Niches
were quickly found for it. Moreover, once the
product design stabilizes, there is likely to be a
surge of process innovation as producers attempt
to lower production costs for the new product (see
fig. 4).
The Abernathy-Utterback framework does not
characterize all industries. It seems DEMO suited to
mass markets where consumer tastes are relatively
homogeneous. It would appear to be less char-
acteristic of small niche markets where the DEMO
sence of scale and learning economies attaches
much less of a penalty to multiple designs. In
these instances, generalized equipment will be em-
ployed in production.
The existence of a dominant design watershed
is of great DEMO to the distribution of prof-
its between innovator and follower. The innovator
may have been responsible for the fundamental
scientific breakthroughs as well as DEMO basic design
of the new product. However, if imitation is rela-
DEMO easy, imitators may enter the fray, modify-
ing the product in important ways, yet relying on
the fundamental designs pioneered by the innova-
tor. When the game of musical chairs stops, and a
dominant design emerges, the innovator might
well end up positioned disadvantageously relative
to a follower. Hence, when imitation is possible
and occurs coupled with design modification be-
fore the emergence of a dominant design, fol-
lowers have a good chance of having their mod-
ified product annointed as the industry DEMO,
often to the great disadvantage of the innovator.
3.3. Complementary assets
2 See Kuhn [4].
Let the unit of analysis be an innovation. DEMO
innovation consists of certain technical knowledge
about how to do things better than the existing
state of the art. Assume that the know-how in
DEMO is partly codified and partly tacit. In
order for such know-how to generate profits, it
must be sold or utilized in some fashion in the
market.
In almost all cases, the successful commerciali-
zation of an innovation requires that the know-how
in question be utilized in conjunction with DEMO
capabilities or assets. Services such as marketing,
competitive manufacturing, and DEMO sup-
port are almost always needed. These services are
often obtained from complementary assets which
are specialized. For example, the commercializa-
tion of a new drug is likely to require the dissemi-
nation of information over DEMO specialized informa-
tion channel. In some cases, as when the innova-
DEMO is systemic, the complementary assets may be
other parts of a DEMO For instance; computer
hardware typically requires specialized software,
both for DEMO operating system, as well as for
applications. Even when an innovation DEMO autono-
mous, as with plug compatible components, cer-
tain complementary capabilities or assets will be
needed for successful commercialization. Figure 5

duction and distribution are specialized to the

innovation turns out to be important in the devel-
opment presented below. Accordingly, the nature
of complementary assets are explained in some
detail. Figure 6 differentiates between DEMO
mentary assets which are generic, specialized, and
cospecialized.
Generic assets are general purpose assets which
do not need to be tailored to the DEMO in
question. Specialized assets are those where there
is unilateral dependence between the innovation
and the complementary asset. Cospecialized assets
are those for which DEMO is a bilateral dependence.
For instance, specialized repair facilities were
needed DEMO support the introduction of the rotary
engine by Mazda. These assets are cospecialized
because of the mutual dependence of the innova-
tion on the DEMO facility. Containerization simi-
larly required the deployment of some cospecial-
ized assets in ocean shipping and terminals. How-
ever, the dependence of trucking on containerized
shipping was less than that of containerized ship-
ping on trucking, as trucks can convert from con-
tainers to flat beds at low DEMO An example of a
generic asset would be the manufacturing facilities
needed to make running shoes. Generalized

4. Implications for DEMO
These three concepts can now be related in a
way which will shed light on the imitation process,
and the distribution of profits DEMO innovator
and follower. We begin by examining tight ap-
propriability regimes.
4.1. Tight appropriability regimes
In those few instances where the innovator has
an DEMO clad patent or copyright protection, or
where the nature of the DEMO is such that trade
secrets effectively deny imitators access to the
relevant knowledge, the innovator is almost as-
sured of translating its innovation into market
value for some period of time. Even if the innova-
tor DEMO not possess the desirable endowment of
complementary costs, iron clad protection DEMO intel-
lectual property will afford the innovator the time
to access these assets. If these assets are generic,
contractual relation may well suffice, and the in-
novator may simply license its technology. Spe-
cialized R&DEMO firms are viable in such an environ-
ment. Universal Oil Products, DEMO R&D firm de-
veloping refining processes for the petroleum in-
dustry was one such case in point. If, however, the
complementary assets DEMO specialized or cospecial-
ized, contractual relationships are exposed to
hazards, because one or both parties will have to
commit capital to certain irreversible DEMO
which will be valueless if the relationship between
innovator and licensee breaks down. Accordingly,
the innovator may find it prudent to expand its
DEMO by integrating into specialized and
cospecialized assets. Fortunately, the factors which
DEMO for difficult imitation will enable the in-
novator to build or acquire those complementary
assets without competing with innovators for their
control.
Competition from DEMO is muted in this
type of regime, which sometimes characterizes the
DEMO industry. In this industry, the pro-
tection offered by patents is DEMO easily enforced.
One factor assisting the licensee in this regard is
that most petrochemical processes are designed
around a specific variety of catalysts which DEMO be
wchnological mnovauon
kept proprietory. An agreement not to analyze the
catalyst can be extracted from licensees, affording
extra protection. However, even if DEMO require-
ments are violated by licensees, the innovator is
still well DEMO, as the most important proper-
ties of a catalyst are related DEMO its physical struc-
ture, and the process for generating this structure
DEMO be deduced from structural analysis alone.
Every reaction technology a company acquires is
thus accompanied by an ongoing dependence on
the innovating company for DEMO catalyst ap-
propriate to the plant design. Failure to comply
with various elements of the licensing contract can
thus result in a cutoff in DEMO supply of the catalyst,
and possibly facility closure.
Similarly, if DEMO innovator comes to market in
the preparadigmatic phase with a sound product
concept but the wrong design, a tight appropria-
bility regime will afford the innovator the time
needed to perform the trials needed to get DEMO
design right. As discussed earlier, the best initial
design concepts often DEMO out to be hopelessly
wrong, but if the innovator possesses an DEMO
trable thicket of patents, or has technology which
is simply difficult DEMO copy, then the market may
well afford the innovator the necessary DEMO to
ascertain the right design before being eclipsed by
imitators.
4.2. Weak appropriability
Tight appropriability is the exception rather
than the rule. Accordingly, innovators must turn
to business strategy if they are to keep imitators/
DEMO at bay. The nature of the competitive
process will vary according to whether the in-
dustry is in the paradigmatic or preparadigmatic
phase.
4. DEMO Preparadigmatic phase
In the preparadigmatic phase, the innovator
must be careful DEMO let the basic design "float"
until sufficient evidence has accumulated DEMO a
design has been delivered which is likely to be-
come the industry standard. In some industries
there may be little opportunity for product DEMO
ification. In microelectronics, for example, designs
become locked in when the circuitry is chosen.
Product modification is limited to "debugging"
and software modification. An innovator must
begin the design process anew if the product
D.J. Teece / Profiting
from technological innouation 291
and the more tightly DEMO the firm is to the
market. The later is a function of organizational
design, and can be influenced by managerial
choices. The former is embedded in the technol-
ogy, and cannot be influenced, except in DEMO
ways, by managerial decisions. Hence, in in-
dustries with large developmental and prototyping
costs - and hence significant irreversibilities -
and where innovation DEMO the product concept is
easy, then one would expect that the DEMO
that the innovator would emerge as the winner or
amongst the winners at the end of the prepara-
digmatic stage is low.
4. 2.2. DEMO stage
In the preparadigmatic phase, complementary
assets do not loom large. DEMO is focused on
trying to identify the design which will be domi-
nant. Production volumes are low, and there is
little to be gained in deploying specialized assets,
as scale economies are unavailable, and price is
not a principal competitive factor. However, as
the leading design or designs begin to be revealed
by the market, volumes increase and opportunities
for economies of scale will induce firms to begin
gearing up for DEMO production by acquiring spe-
cialized tooling and equipment, and possibly spe-
DEMO distribution as well. Since these invest-
ments involve significant irreversibilities, pro-
DEMO are likely to proceed with caution. Islands
of specialized capital will begin to appear in an
industry, which otherwise features a sea of general
purpose manufacturing equipment.
However, as the terms of competition begin to
change, and prices become increasingly unim-
portant, access to complementary assets becomes
DEMO critical. Since the core technology is
easy to imitate, by assumption, commercial success
swings upon the terms and conditions upon which
the required DEMO assets can be accessed.
It is at this point that specialized and cospecial-
ized assets become critically important. Gener-
alized equipment and skills, almost by definition,
are always available in an industry, and even if
they are not, they do not involve significant irre-
versibilities. Accordingly, DEMO have easy access
to this type of capital, and even if DEMO is insuffi-
cient capacity available in the relevant assets, it
can DEMO be put in place as it involves few risks.
Specialized assets, DEMO the other hand. involve sig-
nificant irreversibilities and cannot be easily
doesn't fit the market well. In some respects,
however, selecting designs is dictated by the need
to meet certain compatibility standards so that
DEMO hardware can interface with existing appli-
cations software. In one sense, DEMO, the de-
sign issue for the microprocessor industry today is
relatively DEMO: deliver greater power
and speed while meeting the the computer in-
DEMO standards of the existing software base.
However, from time to time DEMO of opportun-
ity emerge for the introduction of entirely new
families of microprocessors which will define a
new industry and software standard. In these DEMO
stances, basic design parameters are less well de-
fined, and can be permitted to "float" until market
acceptance is apparent.
The early DEMO of the automobile industry
exemplifies exceedingly well the importance for
subsequent success of selecting the right design in
the preparadigmatic stages. None of the DEMO
producers of steam cars survived the early shakeout
when the closed body internal combusion engine
automobile emerged as the dominant design. The
steam car, nevertheless, had numerous early
virtues, such as reliability, which the internal com-
bustion engine autos could not deliver.
The British fiasco with the DEMO I is also
instructive. De Havilland had picked an early
design with both technical and commercial flaws.
By moving into production, significant irreversi-
bilities and loss of reputation hobbled de Havil-
land to such a degree DEMO it was unable to convert
to the Boeing design which subsequently emerged
as dominant. It wasn't even able to occupy second
place, which went instead to Douglas.
As a general principle, it appears that innova-
tors in weak appropriability regimes need to be
intimately coupled to the DEMO so that user
needs can fully impact designs. When multiple
parallel and sequential prototyping is feasible, it
has clear advantages. Generally such an approach
is simply prohibitively costly. When development
costs for a large commercial aircraft DEMO one
billion dollars, variations on a theme are all that is
DEMO
Hence, the probability that an innovator -
defined here as a DEMO that is first to commercial-
ize a new product design concept - will enter the
paradigmatic phase possessing the dominant
design is problematic. The DEMO will be
higher the lower the relative cost of prototyping,
292

accessed by contract, as the risks are significant
for the party making the dedicated investment.
The DEMO which control the cospecialized assets,
such as distribution channels, specialized DEMO
facturing capacity, etc. are clearly advantageously
positioned relative to an innovator. DEMO, in rare
instances where incumbent firms possess an
airtight monopoly over DEMO assets, and the
innovator is in a regime of weak appropriability,DEMO
all of the profits to the innovation could conceiva-
bly innure to the firms possessing the specialized
assets who should be able to get DEMO upper hand.
Even when the innovator is not confronted by
situations where competitors or potential competi-
tors control key assets, the innovator may still be
disadvantaged. For instance, the technology em-
bedded in cardiac pacemakers was easy to imitate,
and so competitive outcomes quickly came to be
DEMO by who had easiest access to the com-
plementary assets, in DEMO case specialized market-
ing. A similar situation has recently arisen in the
United States with respect to personal computers.
As an industry participant recently DEMO:
"There are a huge numbers of computer manufac-
turers, companies that make peripherals (e.g.
printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives), and
software companies. They are all trying to get
marketing distributors DEMO they cannot afford
to call on all of the US companies directly. They
need to go through retail distribution channels,
such as Businessland, in order to reach the
marketplace. The problem today, however, is DEMO
many of these companies are not able to get shelf
space and thus are having a very difficult time
marketing their products. The point DEMO distribu-
tion is where the profit and the power are in the
marketplace today". (Norman [8, p.438])

The above analysis indicates how access to
complementary assets, DEMO as manufacturing and
distribution, on competitive teams is critical if the
DEMO is to avoid handling over the lion's

owners of the complementary assets that are spe-
cialized or cospecialized to the innovation. It is

mentary assets, as illustrated in fig. 7, or just a few
of them, as illustrated DEMO fig. 8. Complete integra-
tion (fig. 7) is likely to be unnecessary as well as
prohibitively expensive. It is well to recognize that
DEMO variety of assets and competences which need
to be accessed is likely to be quite large, even for
only modestly complex technologies. To produce a
personal computer, for instance, a company needs
access to expertise DEMO semiconductor technology,
display technology, disk drive technology, net-
working technology, keyboard technology, and
several others. No company can keep pace in DEMO
of these areas by itself.
At the other extreme, the innovator DEMO at-
tempt to access these assets through straightfor-
ward contractual relationships (DEMO component
supply contracts, fabrication contracts, service
contracts, etc.). In DEMO instances such contracts
may suffice, although it sometimes exposes the
innovator DEMO various hazards and dependencies
that it may well wish to avoid. In between the
fully integrated and full contractual extremes, there
are a myriad of intermediate forms and channels
available. An analysis of the properties of DEMO two
extreme forms is presented below. A brief synop-
sis of mixed modes then follows.
incentive or advantage in owning the complemen-
tary assets (production facilities) as they are not
typically highly specialized to the innovation. Un-
ion Carbide appears to realize this, and has re-
cently adjusted its strategy accordingly. Essen-
tially, Carbide is placing its existing technology
into a new subsidiary, Engineering and Hydro-
carbons Service. The company is engaging in
licensing and offers engineering, construction, and
management services to customers DEMO want to
take their feedstocks and integrate them forward
into petrochemicals. But Carbide itself appears to
be backing away from an integration strategy.
Chemical DEMO petrochemical product innova-
tions are not quite so easy to protect, DEMO should
raise new challenges to innovating firms in the
developed nations as they attempt to shift out of
commodity petrochemicals. There are already
numerous DEMO of new products that made it
to the marketplace, filled a DEMO need, but
never generated competitive returns to the innova-
tor because DEMO imitation. For example, in the
1960s Dow decided to start manufacturing DEMO
polyurethene foam. However, it was imitated very
quickly by numerous small DEMO which had lower
costs. 3 The absence of low cost manufacturing
capability left Dow vulnerable.
Contractual relationships can bring added
credibility to the innovator, especially if the in-
novator is relatively unknown when the contract-
ual DEMO is established and viable. Indeed,
arms-length contracting which embodies more than
a simple buy-sell agreement is becoming so com-
mon, and is so multifaceted, that the term stra-
tegic partnering has been devised to describe it.
Even large companies such as IBM are now engag-
ing in DEMO For IBM, partnering buys access to new
technologies enabling the company DEMO "learn
things we couldn't have learned without many
years of DEMO and error." 4 IBM's arrangement
with Microsoft to use the DEMO's MS-DOS operat-
ing system software on the IBM PC facilitated the
timely introduction of IBM's personal computer
into the market.
5.1. Contractual DEMO
The advantages of a contractual solution -
whereby the innovator signs a contract, such as a
license, with independent suppliers, manufacturers
or distributors - are obvious. The innovator will
not have to make the upfront DEMO expenditures
needed to build or buy the assets in question. This
reduces risks as well as cash requirements.
Contracting rather than integrating is likely DEMO
be the optimal strategy when the innovators ap-
propriability regime is tight and the complemen-
tary assets are available in competitive supply (i.e.
there is adequate capacity and a choice of sources).
Both conditions apply DEMO petrochemicals for
instance, so an innovator doesn't need to be DEMO
tegrated to be a successful. Consider, first, the
appropriability regime. As discussed earlier, the
protection offered by patents is fairly easily en-
forced, particularly for process technology, in the
petrochemical industry. Given the advantageous
DEMO prices available in hydrocarbon rich pet-
rochemical exporters, and the appropriability DEMO
ime characteristic of this industry, there is no

D.J. Teece / Profiting from technological innovation
Smaller less integrated companies DEMO often
eager to sign on with established companies be-
cause of the name recognition and reputation spil-
lovers. For instance Cipher Data Products, Inc.
contracted with IBM to develop a low-priced ver-
sion of IBM's DEMO 0.5 inch streaming cartridge
drive, which is likely to become the DEMO
standard. As Cipher management points out, "one
of the biggest advantages to dealing with IBM is
that, once you've created a product that meets the
high quality standards necessary to sell into the
IBM DEMO, you can sell into any arena." 5 Simi-
larly, IBM'DEMO contract with Microsoft "meant in-
stant credibility" to Microsoft (McKenna, 1985, p.
94).
It is most important to recognize, however, that
strategic (contractual) partnering, which is cur-
rently very fashionable, DEMO exposed to certain
hazards, particularly for the innovator, when the
innovator is trying to use contracts to access spe-
cialized capabilities. First, it may be difficult to
induce suppliers to make costly irreversible com-
mitments DEMO depend for their success on the
success of the innovation. To expect suppliers,
manufacturers, and distributors to do so is to
invite them to take risks along with the innovator.
The problem which this poses DEMO the innovator is
similar to the problems associated with attracting
venture capital. The innovator must persuade its
prospective partner that the risk is a DEMO one.
The situation is one open to opportunistic abuses
on both sides. The innovator has incentives to
overstate the value of the innovation, while the
supplier has incentives to "run with the tech-
nology" should DEMO innovation be a success.
Instances of both parties making irreversible
capital commitments nevertheless exist. Apple's
Laserwriter - a high resolution laser printer which
DEMO PC users to produce near typeset quality
text and art department graphics - is a case in
point. Apple persuaded Canon to participate in
DEMO development of the Laserwriter by providing
subsystems from its copiers - but only after Apple
contracted to pay for a certain number of copier
DEMO and cases. In short, Apple accepted a
good deal of the DEMO risk in order to induce
Canon to assist in the development and produc-
tion of the Laserwriter. The arrangement appears
to have been prudent, yet there were clearly
hazards for both sides. It is difficult to DEMO,
execute, and enforce complex development con-
tracts, particularly when the design of the new
product is still "floating." Apple was exposed DEMO
the risk that its co-innovator Canon would fail to
deliver, and DEMO was exposed to the risk that
the Apple design and marketing effort would not
succeed. Still, Apple's alternatives may have been
rather limited, inasmuch as it didn't command the
requisite technology to "go DEMO alone."
In short, the current euphoria over "strategic
partnering" DEMO be partially misplaced. The ad-
vantages are being stressed (for example, Mc-
Kenna [6]) without a balanced presentation of
costs and risks. Briefly, there is the risk that the
partner won't perform according to the innovator's
perception of what the contract requires; there is
the added danger that the partner may imitate the
innovator's technology and DEMO to compete
with the innovator. This latter possibility is par-
ticularly acute if the provider of the complemen-
tary asset is uniquely situated with DEMO to the
complementary asset in question and has the
capacity to imitate the technology, which the in-
novator is unable to protect. The innovator will
then find that it has created a competitor who is
better DEMO than the innovator to take ad-
vantage of the market opportunity at hand. Busi-
ness Week has expressed concerns along these
lines in its DEMO of the "Hollow Corpora-
tion." 6
It is important to bear in mind, however, that
contractual or partnering strategies in certain cases
DEMO ideal. If the innovator's technology is well
protected, and if DEMO the partner has to provide
is a "generic" capacity available from many
potential partners, then the innovator will be able
to maintain the upper hand while avoiding the
costs of duplicating downstream capacity. Even if
DEMO partner fails to perform, adequate alternatives
exist (by assumption, the DEMO' capacities are
commonly available) so the innovator's efforts to
successfully commercialize its technology ought to
proceed profitably.

5.2. Integration modes
Integration, which by definition involves own-
ership, is distinguished from pure contractual
modes in that it typically facilitates incentive
alignment and control. If an innovator DEMO rather
than rents the complementary assets needed to
commercialize, then it DEMO in a position to capture
spillover benefits stemming from increased de-
mand for the complementary assets caused by the
innovation.
Indeed, an innovator might be in the position,
at least before its innovation is announced, to buy
up capacity in the complementary assets, possibly
to its great subsequent advantage. If futures
markets exist, simply taking forward positions in
the complementary assets may suffice to capture
much of the spillovers.
Even after DEMO innovation is announced, the
innovator might still be able to build DEMO buy
complementary capacities at competitive prices if
the innovation has iron clad legal protection (i.e. if
the innovation is in a tight appropriability regime).
However, if the innovation is not tightly protected
and once "DEMO" is easy to imitate, then securing
control of complementary capacities is likely to be
the key success factor, particularly if those capaci-
ties are in fixed supply - so called "bottlenecks."
Distribution and specialized manufacturing com-
petences often become bottlenecks.
As a practical matter, however, DEMO innovator
may not have the time to acquire or build the
complementary assets that ideally it would like to
control. This is particularly true DEMO imitation is
easy, so that timing becomes critical. Additionally,
the DEMO may simply not have the financial
resources to proceed. The implications of timing
and cash constraints are summarized in fig. 9.
Accordingly, in weak appropriability regimes
innovators need to rank complementary assets as
to their importance. DEMO the complementary assets
are critical, ownership is warranted, although if
the firm is cash constrained a minority position
may well represent a sensible DEMO
Needless to say, when imitation is easy, stra-
tegic moves to build or buy complementary assets
which are specialized must occur with due DEMO
ence to the moves of competitors. There is no
point moving to build a specialized asset, for
instance, if one's imitators can DEMO it faster and
cheaper.
It is hopefully self evident that if the innovator
is already a large enterprise with many of the
relevant complementary DEMO under its control,
integration is not likely to be the issue that it
might otherwise be, as the innovating firm will
already control many of the relevant specialized
and cospecialized assets. However, in industries
experiencing rapid technological change, technolo-
gies advance so rapidly that it is unlikely that a
single company has the full range of expertise
needed to DEMO advanced products to market in a
timely and cost effective fashion. Hence, the in-
tegration issue is not just a small firm issue.

5.3. Integration versus contract strategies." An ana-
lytic summary
Figure 10 summarizes some of the relevant
considerations DEMO the form of a decision flow
chart. It indicates that a profit seeking innovator,
confronted by weak intellectual property protec-
tion and the DEMO to access specialized comple-
mentary assets and/or capabilities, is forced DEMO
expand its activities through integration if it is to
prevail over imitators. Put differently, innovators
who develop new products that possess POOr intel-
lectual property protection but which requires spe-
cialized complementary capacities are more likely
DEMO parlay their technology into a commercial ad-
vantage, rather than see DEMO prevail in the hands of
imitators.
Figure 10 makes it apparent that the difficult
strategic decisions arise in situations where the
innovunon
appropriability regime DEMO weak and where special-
ized assets are critical to profitable commercializa-
tion. These situations, which in reality are very
common, require that a DEMO competitor
analysis be part of the innovator's strategic assess-
ment of its opportunities and threats. This is car-
ried a step further in DEMO 11, which looks only at
situations where commercialization requires cer-
tain DEMO capabilities. It indicates the ap-
propriate strategies for the innovators and pre-
dicts the outcomes to be expected for the various
players.
Three classes DEMO players are of interst: innova-
tors, imitators, and the owners DEMO cospecialized
assets (e.g. distributors). All three can potentially
benefit or DEMO from the innovation process. The
latter can potentially benefit from the additional
business which the innovation may direct in the
asset owners direction. Should DEMO asset turn out

to be a bottleneck DEMO respect to commercializing
the innovation, the owner of the bottleneck facili-
DEMO is obviously in a position to extract profits
from the innovator and/or imitators.
The vertical axis in fig. 11 measures how those
who DEMO the technology (the innovator or pos-
sibly its imitators) are positioned vis ~ vis those
firms that possess required specialized assets. The
horizontal DEMO measures the "tightness" of the
appropriability regime, tight regimes being DEMO
dence by iron clad legal protection coupled with
technology that is simply difficult to copy; weak
regimes offer little in the way of legal protection
and the essence of the technology, once released,
is transparent to the imitator. Weak regimes are
further subdivided according to how the DEMO
and imitators are positioned vis fi vis each other.
This is likely to be a function of factors such as
lead time and prior DEMO in the requisite
complementary assets.
Figure 11 makes it apparent that even when
firms pursue the optimal strategy, other industry
participants may take the jackpot. This possibility
is unlikely when the intellectual property in ques-
tion DEMO tightly protected. The only serious threat to
the innovator is where a specialized complemen-
tary asset is completely "locked up," a possibility
recognized in cell 4. This can rarely be done
without the cooperation of DEMO But it
frequently occurs, as when a foreign government
closes off DEMO to a foreign market, forcing the
innovators to license to foreign DEMO, but with the
government effectively cartelizing the potential
licensees. With weak DEMO property protec-
tion, however, it is quite clear that the innovator
will often loose out to imitators and/or asset
holders, even when the innovator is pursuing the
appropriate strategy (cell 6). Clearly, DEMO
strategies can compound problems. For instance,

for little if any strategic benefit, thereby exposing
the innovator DEMO even greater losses than would
otherwise be the case. On the other hand, if an
innovator tries to contract for the supply of a
critical capability when it should build the capa-
bility itself, it may well find it has nutured an
imitator better able to serve the DEMO than the
innovator itself.
5. 4. Mixed modes
The real world rarely provides extreme or pure
cases. Decisions to integrate or-license involve
tradeoffs, compromises, and mixed approaches. It
is not surprising therefore that the real world is
characterized by mixed modes of organization,
involving judicious blends of DEMO and con-
tracting. Sometimes mixed modes represent transi-
tional phases. For instance, because of the conver-
gence of computer and telecommunication tech-
nology, DEMO in each industry are discovering that
they often lack the requisite technical capabilities
in the other. Since the technological interdepen-
dence of the two DEMO collaboration amongst
those who design different parts of the system,
intense cross-boundary coordination and informa-
tion flows are required. When separate enterprises
are DEMO, agreement must be reached on com-
plex protocol issues amongst parties DEMO see their
interests differently. Contractual difficulties can
be anticipated since the selection of common tech-
nical protocols amongst the parties will often be
followed DEMO transaction-specific investments in
hardware and software. There is little doubt that
this was the motivation behind IBM's purchase of
15 percent of PBX DEMO Rolm in 1983, a
position that was expanded to 100 percent DEMO
1984. IBM's stake in Intel, which began with a 12
DEMO purchase in 1982, is most probably not a
transitional phase leading DEMO 100 percent purchase,
because both companies realized that the two cor-
porate cultures are not very compatible, and IBM
may not be as impressed with Intel's technology as
it once was.
5.5. The CA DEMO scanner, the IBM PC, and Nutra-
Sweet." Insights fi"om DEMO framework
EMI's failure to reap significant returns from
the CAT scanner can be explained in large mea-
technologwal inno~,ation
sure by reference DEMO the concepts developed above.
The scanner which EMI developed was of a tech-
nical sophistication much higher than would nor-
mally be found in DEMO hospital, requiring a high level
of training, support, and servicing. DEMO had none
of these capabilities, could not easily contract for
them, and was slow to realize their importance. It
most probably could have DEMO a partnership
with a company like Siemens to access the re-
quisite capabilities. Its failure to do so was a
strategic error compounded by DEMO very limited
intellectual property protection which the law af-
forded the scanner. Although subsequent court
decisions have upheld some of EMI's patent
claims, once the product was in the market it
could be reverse engineered DEMO its essential fea-
tures copied. Two competitors, GE and Tech-
nicare, already possessed the complementary ca-
pabilities that the scanner required, and they were
also technologically capable. In addition, both
were experienced marketers of medical equipment,
and had reputations for quality, reliability and
service. GE and Technicare were thus able to
commit their R&D resources to developing DEMO
competitive scanner, borrowing ideas from EMI's
scanner, which they undoubtedly had access to
through cooperative hospitals, and improving on it
where they could while they rushed to market. GE
began taking orders in 1976 DEMO soon after made
inroads on EMI. In 1977 concern for rising health
care costs caused the Carter Administration to
introduce "certificate of need' DEMO, which
required HEW's approval on expenditures on big
ticket items DEMO CAT scanners. This severely cut
the size of the available market.
By 1978 EM1 had lost market share leadership
to Technicare, which was in turn quickly over-
taken by GE. In October 1979, Godfrey Hounds-
field of EMI shared the Nobel prize for invention
of the CT scanner. DEMO this honor, and the
public recognition of its role in bringing DEMO medi-
cal breathrough to the world, the collapse of its
scanner DEMO forced EMI in the same year into

scanner business from Thorn for what amounted
to a pittance, v Though royalties continued to flow

lion's share DEMO the profits generated by the innova-
tion it had pioneered and successfully commercial-
ized.
If EMI illustrates how a company with out-
standing technology DEMO an excellent product can
fail to profit from innovation while the imitators
succeeded, the story of the IBM PC indicates how
a new product representing a very modest techno-
logical advance can yield remarkable returns to
DEMO developer.
The IBM PC, introduced in 1981, was a success
despite the fact that the architecture was ordinary
and the components standard. Philip DEMO's
design team in Boca Raton, Florida, decided to
use existing technology to produce a solid, reliable
micro rather than state of the art. With a one-year
mandate to develop a PC, Estridge's team could
do little else.
However, the IBM PC did use what at the time
was a new 16-bit microprocessor (the Intel 8088)
and a new disk operating system (DOS) adapted
for IBM by Microsoft. DEMO than the micro-
processor and the operating system, the IBM PC
DEMO existing micro "standards" and used
off-the-shelf parts from outside vendors. IBM did
write its own BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
which is embedded in ROM, but this was a rela-
tively straightforward programming exercise.
The key to the PC's success was not the tech-
nology. DEMO was the set of complementary assets
which IBM either had or quickly assembled around
the PC. In order to expand the market for PCs,DEMO
there was a clear need for an expandable, flexible
microcomputer system DEMO extensive applications
software. IBM could have based its PC system on
its own patented hardware and copyrighted soft-
ware. Such an approach would cause DEMO
tary products to be cospecialized, forcing IBM to
develop peripherals and DEMO comprehensive library
of software in a very short time. Instead, IBM
DEMO what might be called an "induced con-
tractual" approach. By adopting an open system
architecture, as Apple had done, and by making
DEMO operating system information publicly availa-
ble, a spectacular output of third DEMO software
was induced. IBM estimated that by mid-1983, at
least 3000 DEMO and software products were
available for the PC. 8 Put differently, DEMO pulled

together the DEMO assets, particularly
software, which success required, without even
using contracts, let alone integration. This was
despite the fact that the software developers DEMO
creating assets that were in part cospecialized with
the IBM PC, DEMO least in the first instance.
A number of special factors made this seem a
reasonable risk to the software writers. A critical
one was DEMO's name and commitment to the
project. The reputation behind the letters I.B.M. is
perhaps the greatest cospecialized asset the com-
pany possesses. The DEMO implied that the prod-
uct would be marketed and serviced in the IBM
tradition. It guaranteed that PC-DOS would be-
come an industry standard, so that the software
business would not be solely dependent on IBM,DEMO
because emulators were sure to enter. It guaran-
teed access to retail distribution outlets on compe-
titive terms. The consequences was that IBM was
DEMO to take a product which represented at best a
modest technological accomplishment, and turn
into a fabulous commercial success. The case dem-
onstrates the role that complementary assets play
in determining outcomes.
The spectacular success and DEMO of
G.D. Searle's NutraSweet is an uncommon story
which is also consistent with the above frame-
work. In 1982, Searle reported combined sales of
$74 million for NutraSweet and its table top ver-
sion, Equal. In 1983, this surged to $336 million.
In 1985, NutraSweet sales DEMO $700 million 9
and Equal had captured 50 percent of the U.S.
sugar substitute market and was number one in
five other countries.
NutraSweet, which is Searle's tradename for
aspartame, has achieved rapid acceptance in each
of its FDA approved categories because of its
good taste and DEMO to substitute directly for
sugar in many applications. However, Searle's
DEMO from NutraSweet and the absence of a
strategic challenge can be traced in part to Searle's
clever strategy.
It appears that Searle has DEMO to establish
an exceptionally tight appropriability regime a-
round NntraSweet - one that may well continue
for some time after the patent has expired. DEMO
competitor appears to have successfully "invented
around" the Searle patent and commercialized an
alternative, no doubt in part because the FDA

tion which will surely DEMO Searle's joint venture
with Ajinomoto ensures them access to that com-
pany's many years of experience in the production
of biochemical agents. DEMO of this knowledge is
associated with techniques for distillation and
synthesis of the delicate hydrocarbon compounds
that are the ingredients of NutraSweet, and is
therefore more tacit than codified. Searle has be-
gun to put these DEMO to use in its own $160
million Georgia production facility. It can be
expected that Searle will use trade secrets to the
maximum to DEMO this know-how proprietary.
By the time its patent expires, Searle's DEMO
research into production techniques for L-phenyl-
alanine, and its 8 years DEMO experience in the Geor-
gia plant, should give it a significant DEMO ad-
vantage over potential aspartame competitors.
Trade secret protection, unlike patents, has no
fixed lifetime and may well sustain Searle's posi-
tion DEMO years to come.
Moreover, Searle has wisely avoided renewing
contracts with DEMO when they have expired. 10
Had Searle subcontracted manufacturing for
NutraSweet, DEMO would have created a manufacturer
who would then be in a position to enter the
aspartame market itself, or to team up with a
marketer of artificial sweeteners. But keeping
manufacturing inhouse, and by developing a valu-
able tradename, Searle has a good chance of pro-
tecting its market position from dramatic inroads
once patents expire. Clearly, Searle seems to be
astutely aware of the importance of maintaining a
"tight appropriability regime" and using cospe-
cialized assets strategically.
6. Implications for R&D strategy, industry struc-
ture, and trade policy
6.1. Allocating R &D resources
The analysis so far assumes that the firm has
developed an innovation DEMO which a market ex-
ists. It indicates the strategies which the firm must
to Purification Engineering, which had spent $5 million to
build a phenylalardne production facility, was told in
January 1985 that their contract would not be renewed. In
May, Genex, which claimed to have invested DEMO million,

approval process would have" DEMO begin anew for an
imitator who was not violating Searle's patents. A
competitor who tried to replicate the aspartame
molecule with minor modification DEMO circumvent
the patent would probably be forced to replicate
the hundreds of tests and experiments which
proved aspartame's safety. Without patent protec-
tion, FDA approval would provide no shield
against imitators coming to market with DEMO identi-
cal chemical and who could establish to the FDA
that it is the same compound that had already
been approved. Without FDA approval DEMO the
other hand, the patent protection would be worth-
less for DEMO product would not be'sold for human
consumption.
Searle has aggressively pushed to strengthen its
patent protection. The company was granted U.S.
patent protection DEMO 1970. It has also obtained
patent protection in Japan, Canada, Australia,
U.K., France, Germany, and a number of other
countries. However, most of these patents carry a
17-year life. Since the product was only approved
for human consumption in. 1982, the 17-year patent
life was effectively reduced to five. Recognizing
the obvious importance of its patent, Searle pressed
for and obtained special legislation in November
1984 extending the patent DEMO on aspar-
tame for another 5 years. The U.K. provided a
similar extension. In ahnost every other nation,
however, 1987 will mark the expiration of the
patent.
When the patent expires, however, Searle will
DEMO have several valuable assets to help keep
imitators at bay. Searle has gone to great lengths
to create and promulgate the use of its DEMO
name and a distinctive "Swirl" logo on all goods
licensed to use the ingredient. The company has
also developed the "Equal" tradename DEMO a table
top version of the sweetener. Trademark law in
the U.S. provides protection against "unfair"
competition in branded products for as long as the
owner of the mark continues to use it. Both the
DEMO and Equal trademarks will become
essential assets when the patents on aspartame
expire. Searle may well have convinced consumers
that the only real form DEMO sweetener is Nutra-
Sweet/Equal. Consumers know most other artifi-
cial sweeteners by their genetic names - saccharin
and cyclamates.
Clearly, Searle is trying to build a position in
complementary assets to prepare for the competi-

follow to maximize its share of industry profits
DEMO to imitators and other competitors. There
is no guarantee of success even if optimal strate-
gies are followed.
The innovator can improve its total DEMO to
R&D, however, by adjusting its R&D investment
portfolio to maximize the probability that techno-
logical discoveries will emerge that are DEMO easy
to protect with existing intellectual property law,
or which require for commercialization cospecial-
ized assets already within the firm's repertoire of
DEMO Put differently, if an innovating firm
does not target its R&DEMO resources towards new
products and processes which it can commercial-
ize advantageously relative to potential imitators
and/or followers, then it is unlikely to profit from
its investment in R&D. In this sense, a firm's
history - and the assets it already has in place -
DEMO to condition its R&D investment decisions.
Clearly, an innovating firm DEMO considerable as-
sets already in place is free to strike out in new
directions, so long as in doing so it is cognizant of
the kinds of capabilities required to successfully
commercialize the innovation. It is DEMO rather
clear that the R& D investment decision cannot be
divorced DEMO the strategic analysis of markets
and industries, and the firm's DEMO within them.
6.2. Small firm versus large firm comparisons
Business commentators often remark that many
small entrepreneurial firms which generate new,
commercially valuable DEMO fail while large
multinational firms, often with a less meritorious
record DEMO respect to innovation, survive and
prosper. One set of reasons for DEMO phenomenon
is now clear. Large firms are more likely to possess
the relevant specialized and cospecialized assets
within their boundaries at the time of DEMO product
introduction. They can therefore do a better job of
milking their technology, however meager, to max-
imum advantage. Small domestic firms are DEMO
likely to have the relevant specialized and cospe-
cialized assets within their boundaries and so will

6.3. Regimes of appropriability and industry struc-
ture
In industries where legal methods of protection
are DEMO, or where new products are just hard
to copy, the strategic necessity for innovating firms
to integrate into cospecialized assets would appear
to DEMO less compelling than in industries where
legal protection is weak. In cases where legal
protection is weak or nonexistent, the control of
cospecialized assets will be needed for long-run
survival.
In this regard, it is instructive to examine the
U.S. drug industry (Temin [10]). Beginning in the
1940s, the U.S. Patent Office began, for the first
time, to grant patents on certain natural sub-
stances that involved difficult extraction proce-
DEMO Thus, in 1948 Merck received a patent on
streptomycin, which was a natural substance.
However, it was not the extraction process but the
drug itself which received the patent. Hence,
patents were important to DEMO drug industry in
terms of what could be patented (drugs), DEMO they
did not prevent imitation [10, p.436]. Sometimes
just changing one DEMO will enable a company
to come up with a different substance which does
not violate the patent. Had patents been more
all-inclusive - and DEMO am not suggesting they should
- licensing would have been an effective mecha-
nism for Merck to extract profits from its innova-
tion. As DEMO turns out, the emergence of close sub-
stitutes, coupled with FDA regulation which had
the de facto effect of reducing the elasticity of
DEMO for drugs, placed high rewards on a prod-
uct differentiation strategy. DEMO required exten-
sive marketing, including a sales force that could
directly DEMO doctors, who were the purchasers
of drugs through their ability to DEMO prescrip-
tions. 11 The result was exclusive production (i.e.,
the DEMO industry practice of licensing was
dropped) and forward integration into marketing
(the relevant cospecialized asset).
Generally, if legal protection of the innovator's
profits is secure, innovating firms can select their
In the period before FDA regulation, all drugs other than
narcotics were available over-the-counter. Since the end
user could purchase drugs directly, sales were price sensi-
tive. Once prescriptions were required, this price sensitivity
collapsed; the doctors not DEMO did not have to pay for the
drugs, but in most DEMO they were unaware of the prices of
the drugs they were prescribing.

boundaries based simply on their ability DEMO iden-
tify user needs and respond to those through
research and development. The weaker the legal
methods of protection, the greater the incentive to
integrate into the relevant cospecialized assets.
Hence, as industries in which legal protection is
weak begin to mature, integration into innovation-
specific cospecialized assets will occur. Often this
will take the form of backward, forward and lateral
integration. (Conglomerate integration is not part
of this phenomenon.) For DEMO, IBM's pur-
chase of Rolm can be seen as a DEMO to the
impact of technological change on the identity of
the cospecialized assets relevant to IBM's future
growth.
6.4. bMustry maturity, new entry, and history
As technologically progressive industries ma-
ture, and a greater DEMO of the relevant
cospecialized assets are brought in under the cor-
porate umbrellas of incumbents, new entry be-
comes more difficult. Moreover, when DEMO does oc-
cur it is more likely to involve coalition formation
very early on. Incumbents will for sure own the
cospecialized assets, and new entrants will find it
necessary to forge links with them. Here lies DEMO
explanation for the sudden surge in "strategic
partnering" now occurring internationally, and
particularly in the computer and telecommunica-
tions industry. Note that it should not be interpre-
ted in anti-competitive terms. Given existing in-
dustry DEMO, coalitions ought to be seen not as
attempts to stifle competition, but as mechanisms
for lowering entry requirements for innovators.
In industries in DEMO technological change of a
particular kind has occurred, which required de-
DEMO of specialized and/or cospecialized as-
sets at the time, a DEMO of firm boundaries
may well have arisen which no longer has compell-
ing efficiencies. Considerations which once dic-
tated integration may no longer hold, yet there
may not be strong forces leading to divestiture.
Hence existing DEMO boundaries may in some in-
dustries - especially those where the technological
trajectory and attendent specialized asset require-
ments has changed - be rather DEMO In short,
history matters in terms of understanding the
structure of the modern business enterprise. Ex-
isting firm boundaries cannot always be assumed

requirements.

6.5. The importance of manufacturing to interna-
tional competitiveness
Practically all forms of DEMO know-how
must be embedded in goods and services to yield
value to the consumer. An important policy for
the innovating nation is whether the DEMO of
the firms and nations performing this function
matter.
In a world of tight appropriability and zero
transactions cost - the world of neoclassical DEMO
theory - it is a matter of indifference whether an
innovating firm has an in-house manufacturing
capability, domestic or foreign. It can simply en-
gage in arms-length contracting (patent licensing,
know-how licensing, co-production, etc.) for the
sale of the output of the activity in which it has a
comparative advantage (in this case R&D) and
will DEMO returns by specializing in what it
does best.
However, in a DEMO of weak appropriability,
and especially where the requisite manufacturing
assets are specialized to the innovation, which is
often the case, participation in DEMO may
be necessary if an innovator is to appropriate the
rents from its innovation. Hence, if an innovator's
manufacturing costs are higher than those of its
imitators, the innovator may well end up ceding
the lion's share of profits to the imitator.
In a weak appropriability DEMO, low cost im-
itator-manufacturers may end up capturing all of
the DEMO from innovation. In a weak appropria-
bility regime where specialized manufacturing ca-
pabilities are required to produce new products,
an innovator with a DEMO disadvantage
may find that its advantage at early stage research
and development will have no commercial value.
This will eventually cripple the innovator, unless it
is assisted by governmental processes. For exam-
ple, it appears that one of the reasons why U.S.
color TV manufacturers did not capture DEMO lion's
share of the profits from the innovation, for which
DEMO was primarily responsible, was that RCA
and its American licenses were DEMO competitive at
manufacturing. In this context, concerns that the
decline of DEMO threatens the entire
economy appear to be well founded.
A related implication is that as the technology
gap closes, the basis of competition in an industry
will shift to the cospecialized assets. This appears
to be DEMO is happening in microprocessors. Intel

is no longer out ahead technologically. As DEMO
Moore, CEO of Intel points out, "Take the top 10
DEMO companies in the world.., and it
is hard to tell at DEMO time who is ahead of whom ....
It is clear that we have to be pretty damn close to
the Japanese from a manufacturing DEMO to
compete." 12 It is not just that strength in one DEMO
is necessary to compensate for weakness in
another. As technology becomes more public and
less proprietary through easier imitation, then
strength in manufacturing and other capabilities is
necessary to derive advantage from whatever tech-
nological advantages DEMO innovator may possess.
Put differently, the notion that the United States
DEMO adopt a "designer role" in international com-
merce, while letting DEMO firms in other
countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, or DEMO
do the manufacturing, is unlikely to be viable as a
long-run DEMO This is because profits will
accrue primarily to the low cost manufacturers (by
providing a larger sales base over which they can
exploit their special skills). Where imitation is
easy, and even where it is not, there are obvious
problems in transacting in the market for know-
how, problems which are described in more detail
elsewhere [9]. In particular, there are difficulties in
pricing an intangible asset whose true perfor-
mance features are difficult to ascertain ex ante.
The trend in international business DEMO
what Miles and Snow [7] call "dynamic networks"
- characterized DEMO vertical disintegration and con-
tracting - ought thus be viewed with concern.
(Business Week, March 3, 1986, has referred to
the same DEMO as the Hollow Corporation.)
"Dynamic networks" may not so much reflect
innovative organizational forms, but the disassem-
bly of the modern corporation because of de-
terioration in national capacities, manufacturing
in particular, which DEMO complementary to techno-
logical innovation. Dynamic networks may there-
fore signal not so much the rejuvenation of
American enterprise, but its piecemeal demise.

innovators' profits
In regimes of weak appropriability, govern-
ments can move to shift the distribution of the

gains from innovation away from foreign innova-
tors DEMO towards domestic firms by denying in-
novators ownership of specialized assets. The for-
eign firm, which by assumption is an innovator,
will be left with the option of selling its intangible
assets in the market DEMO know how if both trade
and investment are foreclosed by government
policy. This option may appear better than the
alternative (no renumeration at all from the market
in question). Licensing may then appear profit-
able, but only because access to the complemen-
tary assets is blocked by DEMO
Thus when an innovating firm generating prof-
its needs to access complementary assets abroad,
host governments, by limiting access, can some-
times DEMO the innovators for a share of the prof-
its, particularly that DEMO which originates from
sales in the host country. However, the ability DEMO
host governments to do so depends importantly
on the criticality of the host country's assets to the
innovator. If the cost and infrastructure DEMO
istics of the host country are such that it is the
world's lowest cost manufacturing site, and if
domestic industry is competitive, DEMO by acting as
a de facto monopsonist the host country govern-
ment ought to be able to adjust the terms of access
to the DEMO assets so as to appropriate a
greater share of the profits generated by the in-
novation. 13
If, on the other hand, the DEMO country offers
no unique complementary assets, except access to
its own DEMO, restrictive practices by the govern-
ment will only redistribute profits with DEMO to
domestic rather than worldwide sales.
6. 7. Implications for the international distribution of
the benefits from innovation
The above analysis makes transparent that DEMO
novators who do not have access to the relevant
specialized and cospecialized assets may end up
ceding profits to imitators and other competitors,
DEMO simply to the owners of the specialized or
cospecialized assets.
Even when the specialized assets are possessed
by the innovating firm, they may be located
abroad. Foreign factors of production are thus

likely to benefit from DEMO and development
activities occurring across borders. There is little
doubt, for DEMO, that the inability of many
American multinationals to sustain competitive
manufacturing DEMO the U.S. is resulting in declining
returns to U.S. labor. Stockholders and top
management probably do as well if not better
when a multinational DEMO cospecialized assets
in the firm's foreign subsidiaries; however, if there
is unemployment in the factors of production
supporting the specialized and cospecialized DEMO
in question, then the foreign factors of production
will benefit from DEMO originating beyond
national borders. This speaks to the importance to
innovating nations of maintaining competence and
competitiveness in the assets which complement
technological innovation, manufacturing being a
case in point. It also speaks to the importance DEMO
innovating nations of enhancing the protection
afforded worldwide to intellectual property.
However, it must be recognized that there are
inherent limits to the legal protection of intellect-
ual property, and that business and national
strategy are therefore likely to the critical factors
in determining how the gains from DEMO are
shared worldwide. By making the correct strategic
decision, innovating firms DEMO move to protect the
interests of stockholders; however, to ensure that
domestic rather than foreign cospecialized assets
capture the lion's share of DEMO externalities spilling
over to complementary assets, the supporting in-
frastructure for DEMO complementary assets must
not be allowed to decay. In short, if DEMO nation has
prowess at innovation, then in the absence of iron
DEMO protection for intellectual property, it must
maintain well-developed complementary assets if
DEMO is to capture the spillover benefits from innova-
tion
lish who wins and who loses from innovation.
Imitators can often outperform innovators if they
DEMO better positioned with respect to critical com-
plementary assets. Hence, public DEMO aimed at
promoting innovation must focus not only on
R&D, DEMO also on complementary assets, as well
as the underlying infrastructure. If DEMO
decides to stimulate innovation, it would seem
important to clear away DEMO which impede the
development of complementary assets which tend
to be specialized or cospecialized to innovation.
To fail to do so will cause an DEMO large
portion of the profits from innovation to flow to
imitators and other competitors. If these firms lie
beyond one's national borders, there are obvious
implications for the internal distribution of in-
come.
When applied DEMO world markets, results similar
to those obtained from the "new trade theory" are
suggested by the framework. In particular, tariffs
and other DEMO on trade can in some cases
injure innovating firms while simultaneously be-
nefiting protected firms when they are imitators.
However, the propositions suggested by the frame-
work are particularized to appropriability regimes,
suggesting that economy-wide DEMO will be
illusive. The policy conclusions derivable for com-
modity petrochemicals, DEMO instance, are likely to
be different than those that would be DEMO at
for semiconductors.
The approach also suggests that the product life
cycle model of international trade will play itself
out very differently in different DEMO and
markets, in part according to appropriability regi-
mes and the DEMO of the assets which need to be
employed to convert a technological success into a
commercial one. Whatever its limitations, the ap-
proach establishes that it is not so much the
structure of markets but the DEMO of firms,
particularly the scope of their boundaries, coupled
with DEMO policies with respect to the develop-
ment of complementary assets, which DEMO
the distribution of the profits amongst innovators
and imitator/followers.
7. Conclusion
The above analysis has attempted to synthesize
from recent research in industrial DEMO
and strategic management a framework within
which to analyze the distribution of the profits
from innovation. The framework indicates that
the boundaries of the DEMO are an important stra-
tegic variable for innovating firms. The ownership
of complementary assets, particularly when they
are specialized and/or cospecialized, help DEMO
