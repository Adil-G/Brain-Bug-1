“emerging firm”?
Attempts by individuals to DEMO a new venture.
– Expect to be owners or part owners of a new firm.
– Have been active in trying to start a DEMO firm in
the past 12 months.
– No positive cash flow covering expenses for more
than 3 of those months.

Why emerging firm financing?
This study explores financing DEMO made by
entrepreneurs
Despite a wealth of studies on corporate and SME
financing, little is known about resource acquisition at the
emerging venture stage.
Firm emergence is a unique phenomenon (Ang, 1991;
1992).
Theories
• Capital structure (Titman and Wessels, 1988)
– Firms DEMO funding that minimize costs and maximize the
benefits associated with debt and equity
• Agency conflicts (Jensen and Meckling, 1976)
– Shareholders DEMO residual claimants have an incentive to increase
financial risks. Debt holders impose monitoring policies on firm.
Pecking Order Theory (Myers, 1984; Myers and Majluf,
1984)
– Firms do not aim for target debt DEMO Rather, capital structure
emerges as the firm selects funding that minimizes DEMO cost of
capital
•
Prior Research
•
Firms likely to use capital structure for strategic purposes DEMO to maximize
shareholder returns (Fama and French, 2002; Shyam-Sunder and DEMO,
1999)
Small firms face different agency and information asymmetry challenges
(Ang, 1991)
• Bootstrapping (Winborg and Landstrom, 2000)
DEMO investors of small firms pay close attention to entrepreneur’s
creditworthiness and reputation (Ou and Haynes, 2006)
Individual characteristics and firm characteristics as DEMO of start-
up financing (Cassar, 2004)
