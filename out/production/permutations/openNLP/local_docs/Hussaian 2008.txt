The traditional variable DEMO methods for survival data depend on iteration procedures, and control of DEMO process assumes
tuning parameters that are problematic and time consuming, especially DEMO the models are complex and have a large number of risk
factors. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to select the most inﬂuential risk
factors. This DEMO to simpliﬁcation of the logistic regression model by excluding the irrelevant risk factors, thus eliminating
the need to ﬁt and evaluate a large number of models. Data from medical trials are suggested as a way to DEMO the eﬃciency and
capability of this method and as a way to simplify the model. This leads to construction of an appropriate model. The DEMO
method ranks the risk factors according to their importance.

1. Introduction
Sensitivity analysis (SA) plays a central role in a variety of
DEMO methodologies, including classiﬁcation and dis-
crimination, calibration, comparison, and model selection
[1]. SA also can be used to determine which subset of DEMO
factors (if any) accounts for most of the output variance (DEMO
in what percentage); those factors with a small percentage
can be ﬁxed to any value within their range [2]. In such usage,
DEMO focus is on determination of the important variables to
simpliﬁcation of the model; the original motivation for our
research lay in a search for how to best arrive at such a
determination. Although SA has been DEMO used in normal
regression models to extract important input variables from
acomplex modelsoastoarrive at areduced modelwith
equivalent predictive power, it has limited use for selection
of risk factors despite the presence of a large number of
DEMO factors in survival regression models. The limited use
of these methods to select appropriate subsets in survival
regression models illustrates the desirability of development
DEMO a new method of SA-based variable selection to avoid the
drawbacks of traditional methods and also simplify survival
regression models by choosing the appropriate DEMO of risk
factors.
A considerable number of methods of variable selection
have been proposed in the literature. The fundamental devel-
opments are squarely in DEMO context of normal regression
models and particularly in the context of multivariate linear
regression models [3]. A comprehensive review of many
variable selection methods DEMO represented in [4]. Methods
such as forward, backward, and stepwise selection and subset
selection (Akaike information criterion (AIC)) and Bayesian
information DEMO (BIC)) are available; however none
of these methods can be recommended for use in either
a logistic regression model or in other DEMO regression
models. They give incorrect estimates of the standard errors
and P-values. They also can delete variables whose inclusion
is critical [3]. In addition, these methods regard all the risk
factors of a situation as equal, and they seek to identify the
candidate subset of variables sequentially; furthermore, most
of these methods focus on the main eﬀects and ignore higher-
order eﬀects (interactions of variables).
New methods of variable selection, DEMO as least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in [5], DEMO the
smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) method in [6],
are at the center of attention recently in the ﬁeld of survival
regression DEMO These methods use the penalized likeli-
hood estimation and the shrinkage regression approaches.
2 International Journal of Quality, Statistics, and Reliability
These two approaches DEMO from traditional methods in
their deletion of the nonsigniﬁcant covariates in the model by
estimating their eﬀects as 0. A nice feature of these DEMO
is that they perform estimation and variable selection
simultaneously, but, nevertheless, these methods suﬀer from
some calculation and characteristics problems that are dealt
with in more detail in [7, 8].
This study aims to use SA to extend and develop an
eﬀective, eﬃcient, and time-saving variable DEMO method
in which the best subsets are identiﬁed according to speciﬁed
criteria without resorting to ﬁtting all the possible subset
regression models in the DEMO of survival regression models.
The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2
gives the background of building a logistic regression model,
and Section 3 deals with the proposed method. The results
of DEMO this method and logistic regression model
are the subject of Section 4,and Section 5 consists of the
discussion and conclusions.
2. Background of DEMO
a Logistic Regression Model
Often the response variable in clinical data is not a numerical
value but a binary one (e.g., alive or DEMO, diseased or not
diseased). When the latter occurs, a binary logistic regression
model is an appropriate method to present the relationship
between DEMO disease’s measurements and its risk factors. It is
a form of regression used when the response variable (the
disease measurement) is a dichotomy DEMO the risk factors
of the disease are of any type [9]. A logistic regression
model neither assumes the linearity in the relationship
between the DEMO factors and the response variable, nor does
it require normally distributed DEMO It also does not
assume homoscedasticity, and in general has less DEMO
requirements than linear regression models. However, it
does require that observations DEMO independent and that
the independent risk factors are linearly related to the logit
of the response variable [10]. However, models involving
the association between risk factors and binary response
variables are found in various disciplines such DEMO medicine,
engineering, and the natural sciences. How do we model
DEMO relationship between risk factors and binary response
variable? The answer to DEMO question is the subject of the next
subsections.
2.1. Constructing a Logistic Regression Model
The ﬁrst step in modeling binomial data is a transformation
DEMO the probability scale from range (0, 1) to (−∞, DEMO)
instead of using the linear model for the response variable
of the probability of success on risk factors. The logistic
transformation or logit DEMO the probability of success (π)is
log {π/(1 − π)}, which is written as logit (π)and deﬁned
as the DEMO odds of success. It is easily seen that any value of
(DEMO) in the range (0, 1) corresponds to the value of logit (π)
in (−∞,+∞). Usually, binary data results from a nonlinear
relationship between {π(x)} and (x), where a ﬁxed change in

Figure 1: Logit = ln(π/(1 − π)) as a function DEMO the value of
probability (π), the logit ranges from (−∞)to(+∞) as probability
ranges from (0) to (1). DEMO logit = 0 when probability = 0.5.
(x) has less impact when {π(x)} is near (0 or 1) than when
DEMO(x)} is near (0.5). This is illustrated in Figure DEMO (see [11]).
Thus, the appropriate link is the log odds transformation
(the logit). Then if there are n binomial observations of the
form πi = yi /ni for i = 1, 2, ... , n, where the expected value
of the random variable associated with ith observation, yi,is
E(Yi) = niπi. The logistic DEMO model for association of
πi on the values x1i, x2i, ... , xki of k risk factors X1 , X2 , ... , DEMO
is such that [10]

The linear logistic model is a member of a family of
generalized linear models (GLM). The next subsection
explains this model ﬁtting process.

2.2. Fitting Logistic Regression DEMO
The mechanics of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation
and model ﬁtting for logistic regression model are a special
case of GLM ﬁtting, and then ﬁtting the model requires
estimation of the unknown parameters (βj )ofthe DEMO
function of this model using the Bernoulli ML as in the
following [12]:

The problem now DEMO to obtain those values (β0 , β1 , ... , βk )
that maximize {L(β)} or its equivalent {Log L(β)DEMO where it
is as follows:
describes reality well, it tends DEMO provide more accurate esti-
mates of the quantities of interest. Agresti [9] stated that “we
are mistaken if we think that we have found DEMO true model,
because any model is a simpliﬁcation of reality.” In light of
this assertion, what then is the logic of testing the ﬁt of a
model when we know that it does not truly DEMO? The answer
lies in the evaluation of the speciﬁc properties of DEMO model
by using criteria such as deviance, the R2 , the DEMO Score test,
the Person chi-square, and the Hosmer-Lemshow chi-square
tests; for more details, see [9, 10]. Usually the ﬁrst stage of
DEMO of any model presents a large number of risk
factors. Inclusion of all of them may lead to an unattractive
model from a statistical DEMO Thus, as an important
step towards an acceptable model, a decision should be made
early about the proper methodology to use to select DEMO
appropriate and important risk factors. Because traditional
methods of selecting variables have many limitations in their
applicability to survival regression models, a new method of
variables selection will be developed by using GSA to select
the DEMO inﬂuential factors in the model. This is the subject
of the following section.
3. Sensitivity Analysis to Select the Most
Inﬂuencing Risk Factors
There DEMO two key problems in variable selection procedure:
(i) how to select an appropriate number of risk factors
from the set of risk DEMO, and (ii) how to improve ﬁnal
model performance based on DEMO given data. So answering
these questions is the objective of our proposed method
by applying GSA to select the inﬂuential risk factors in the
DEMO regression model.

are two methods to solve (6) and obtain the maximum
likelihood estimation of (β ). The one most often used is
known as the Newton-Raphson method. This method begins
DEMO determination of the score matrix {U(β)} and the

3.1. General Concept of GSA
GSA was deﬁned in [14] as “the study of how the uncertainty
in the output DEMO a model (numerical or otherwise) can be
apportioned to diﬀerent sources of uncertainty in the model
input.” Hence one possible way to apportion DEMO importance
of the input factors with respect to the model response is to
apply GSA. In general the importance of a given risk factor
DEMO can be measured via the so-called sensitivity index, which
is deﬁned DEMO the fractional contribution to the model output
variance because of the uncertainty in Xi.For k risk factors,
the sensitivity indices can be computed DEMO the following
decomposition formula for the total output variance V (Y )
of the output Y [15]:
V (Y ) = i

(10)
4 International Journal of Quality, Statistics, and Reliability
where V (Y ) is the unconditional variance of output of the
model (incidence of CHD), V (Xi) is the conditional variance
of risk factor DEMO,and V (Xi, Xj ) is the variance of interaction
between Xi and Xj , and so on. A ﬁrst measurement of the
DEMO of the unconditional output variance V (Y ) that is
accounted DEMO by the uncertainty in Xi, which is the ﬁrst-
order sensitivity DEMO (Si) for the factor Xi is given as
V (Xi) .
Si = V (Y )
(11)
The second terms in (9) are known as the eﬀect of
interactions. It is DEMO fact that the number and importance
of the interaction terms usually grow (i) with the number
of risk factors k, and (ii) with the range of variation of the
risk factors [16]. This means DEMO if all of the V (Xi)terms
ik=1 V (Xi) DEMO still be
lower than the totalare computed, then most likelyV (Y ), because the di ﬀerence V (Y ) −
k 1 DEMO (Xi) is a measure of the impact of the interactions.

Consequently, when k 1 Si = 1, then the model DEMO additive

(i.e., without interactions among its input factors), and
thus the ﬁrst order of conditional variances of (10)are all
we need to decompose the model output variance. For a
nonadditive model, higher-order sensitivity indices account
for interaction eﬀects among sets of input factors. DEMO,
higher-order sensitivity indices are usually not estimated
directly because if the model consists of k risk factors, then
the total number of indices (including the Si’s) that should
be estimatedisashighas2k − 1. For this DEMO, a more
compact sensitivity measurement is used; this measurement
is the total eﬀect sensitivity (ST ) index, which concentrates
in one single DEMO on all the interactions involving a given
factor Xi.For example, foramodelof DEMO = 3 risk factors, the
three total sensitivity indices would be DEMO
ST 1 = V (Y ) −VX2 X3 E ) Y DEMO X2 X3 

V (Y
= S1 + S12 + DEMO + S123 ,
(12)
and analogously
ST 2 = S2 + S12 + S23 + S123 (13)
ST 3 = S3 + S13 + S23 + S123 ,
where the conditional variance in (12) expresses the total
contribution to the variance of Y because DEMO non-Xi,(i.e.,to
the k − 1 remaining factors), so DEMO V (Y ) − VX−i (EXi (Y |
X−i)) DEMO all terms (i.e., a ﬁrst order as well as
interactions in (9)) that involve risk factor Xi.For agiven
risk factor Xi, DEMO coeﬃcient of importance (ICi) is the
diﬀerence between STi and Si that reﬂects an important role
of interactions for that risk factor in DEMO,
ICi = STi −Si.
(14)
Explaining the interactions among DEMO factors helps us
to improve our understanding about the model structure.
Estimators for both (Si, STi) are provided by a variety of
methods such as Sobol, the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test
(FAST), and DEMO; for more details, see [17].
3.2. GSA in a Logistic Regression Model
In this study, partitioning the total variance of the objective
function V (Y ) is the way to estimate Si and STi so as
to perform a GSA. How can this model be extended to
DEMO with a binary response variable? Although partitioning
of variances is uncomplicated DEMO models with a contin-
uous response variable and a normal error distribution,
the extension of this partitioning to models with binary
responses is DEMO simple [18]. Consequently, to extend the
variance partitioning method to our DEMO response variable
(incident of coronary heart disease (CHD)), suppose DEMO
the data is consisting of yi, the number of people who
DEMO CHD. The actual response probability of the incidence
of CHD for the ith observation πi will have a Bernoulli
distribution with a mean of DEMO,where pi is the proportion
of the patients who have a disease. This response probability
is therefore a random variable where E(πi) = pi.The
variance of πi must be equal to zero when pi is DEMO or unity,
and then a relationship between the unknown probability
and our risk factors can be ﬁtted. Typically a logistic
regression model represents DEMO relationship between yi for
a sample with n people who have a binomial distribution
(i.e., {Yi ∼B(n, πi)}, i = DEMO, 2, ... , n), and the corresponding
response probability of the incidence of the disease is πi =
yi /n for ith observation and the k risk factors X1 , X2 , ... , DEMO
as in (4)and (5). This model assumes independence between
the n observations, and then all the variations conditional on
the estimates of the probabilities will be binomial with equal
variance:
VYi = DEMO −πi.
(15)
The binomial is not the only possible distribution DEMO ﬁtting
proportion data. Other distributions exist that have greater
variation (known DEMO overdispersion) or less variation (known
as underdispersion) than the binomial DEMO condi-
tional on the values of πi’s. The simplest function for the true
probability of the ith observation uses a multiplicative scale
factor to DEMO the variance of the response as
varπ
i
 = rpi1 − pi, (16)
where r is a scale factor that is DEMO to 1. If we have
a binomial variation, it will be DEMO than 1 if there is
overdispersion and less than 1 if there is underdispersion,
and πi is an unobservable random variable [19]. The
DEMO of the multiplicative approach are that it will
allow both over- and underdispersions. The random variable
Yi is associated with the observed number of DEMO
of the disease for the ith unit, yi. It will have DEMO binomial
distribution, and then the mean of Yi, conditionalon πi,is
EYi | πi = nπi
and the conditional variance of Y is

Since πi
of the disease incidence pi has to DEMO an estimate of πi as

According to a DEMO result from the conditional proba-
bility theory, the unconditional expected value DEMO a random
variable Y can be obtained from the conditional expectation
of Y given X using the equation
E(Y ) = EE(Y DEMO X )
and the unconditional variance of Y is given by DEMO

and so
VYi = nrpi1 − pi
(26)
in the absence of random variation in the response probabil-
ity, Yi would have a binomial distribution, DEMO(n, pi), and in
this case when r = 1 DEMO required, then
VYi = npi1 − pi.
(27)
If, DEMO the other hand, r is greater than 1, then a variation in
the response probability occurs and the variance of Yi will
exceed DEMO(1 − pi), the variance under binomial sampling
that leads to overdispersion. But if r is less than 1, then the
variation in the response probability and the variance of Yi
will be less than DEMO(1 − pi), the variance under binomial
sampling that leads to underdispersion. To use GSA to select
the important covariates from the available DEMO of covariates
and construct an appropriate logistic regression model, it
involves DEMO steps.
(1) The ﬁrst step is identiﬁcation of the probability
distribution f (x) of each covariate in the model. Usually sen-
sitivity DEMO starts from probability distribution functions
(pdfs) given by the experts. This selection makes the use of
the best information available of the statistical DEMO of
the input factors. One of the methods used to obtain the
pdfs starts with visualizing the observed data by examining
its histogram to DEMO if it is compatible with the shape of any
distribution, as DEMO in Figure 2.
A visual approach is not always easy, accurate, or valid,
especially if the sample size is small. Thus it DEMO be

better to have a more formal procedure for deciding which
distribution is “best.” A DEMO of signiﬁcance tests are
available for this such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnoﬀ and chi-
square tests. For more details, see [21].
(2) In the second step, the logistic regression model as in
(1) and the information about the covariates obtained in step
one are used to create DEMO Monte Carlo simulation to generate
the sample that will be used in the decomposition and to
estimate the unconditional variance of response probability
and DEMO conditional variation for covariates as in (23)to(26).

ing GSA in the binary logistic regression model using (11),

4. Numerical Comparisons
The purpose of this section is to compare the performance
of the proposed method with existing ones. We DEMO use a
real data example to illustrate our SA approach as a variable
selection method. In the ﬁrst examples in this section, we
used the dataset and the results of the penalized likelihood
estimate of best DEMO (AIC), bust subset (BIC), SCAD, and
LASSO that DEMO computed by [7] as a way to compare the
performance of the proposed method with these methods.
4.1. The First Example
In this example, Fan and Li [7] applied the proposed
penalized likelihood methodology to burn DEMO collected
by the General Hospital Burn Center at the University of
Southern California. The dataset consists of 981 observa-
tions. The binary response variable DEMO is 1 for those victims
who survived their burns and 0 otherwise. Risk factors
are X1 = age, X2 = sex, X3 = DEMO (burn area + 1), and
binary variable X4 = oxygen (0 normal, 1 abnormal) was
considered. Quadratic terms of X1 and DEMO , and all interaction
terms were included. The intercept term was added, and
the logistic regression model was ﬁtted. The best subset
variable selection with the AIC and the BIC was applied
to this dataset. The DEMO parameter λ was chosen
by generalized cross-validation: it is 0.6932 and DEMO,
respectively, for the penalized likelihood estimates with the
SCAD and DEMO The constant a in the SCAD was taken as
3.7. With the selected λ, the penalized likelihood estimator
was obtained at the sixth, DEMO, and ﬁfth step iterations
for the penalized likelihood with the SCAD DEMO LASSO.
Table 1 contains the estimated coeﬃcients and standard
errors for the transformed data, based on the penalized
likelihood estimators, and the calculation DEMO the sensitivity
indices obtained by using SimLab software to compare the
performance of GSA as a variable selection method with
other methods. The ﬁrst DEMO columns were calculated by [7].
In addition to GSA indices, Table DEMO consists of the results
of two traditional methods of variable selection (DEMO and
BIC) and two new methods (LASSO and SCAD). The
traditional method, best subset procedure via minimizing
the BIC scores, chooses DEMO of 13 risk factors, whereas the
SCAD chooses four risk factors. DEMO diﬀerence between them
is that the best subset keeps X4 . Neither SCAD nor the
2 2
best subset variable selection (BIC) includes DEMO and X3 in
the selected subset, but both LASSO and the DEMO subset
variable selection (AIC) included them. LASSO chooses the
quadratic terms of X1 and X3 rather than their linear terms.
It also selects DEMO interaction term X2 X3 ,which maynot
be statistically signiﬁcant. LASSO shrinks DEMO large
coeﬃcients. The last column in Table 1 shows that GSA
selected the variables X1 , X3 ,and X1 X3 , in addition to the
intercept, which resembles the SCAD method, and diﬀers
from the DEMO methods. According to the results in the last
column of Table 1, the risk factors can be ranked according to
sensitivity indices Si and STi.Age (X1 ) is the ﬁrst and the most
inﬂuential risk factor, with a percent of contribution of 0.487,
and the second most important risk factor is the interaction

shown in Table 1. Consequently, we ﬁnd that the proposed
GSA variable selection method resembles SCAD in choosing
the same risk DEMO
4.2. The Second Example
A new dataset emerges from the original dataset prepared
in [22] as a way to compare SA and the traditional DEMO
(backward elimination) as variable selection methods. Orig-
inally this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence
of CHD risk factors among a population-based DEMO of
403 rural African-Americans in Virginia. Community-based
screening evaluations included the determination of exercise
and smoking habits, blood pressure, height, weight, total DEMO
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and glycosylated
hemoglobin, and other factors. The results of this study were
presented as percentages of prevalence for DEMO factors such
as diabetes (13.6% of men, 15.6% of women), hypertension
(30.9% of men, 43.1% of women), and obesity (38.7% of
men, 64.7% of women), without building any models to
study the relationship between CHD and its risk factors.
For more details, see [8]. A new dataset was generated
based on the ﬁrst one as DEMO way to calculate SA indices to
extract the important risk factors for CHD from among
these new factors, and then implement the logistic regression
model to test the performance of the proposed method as
follows.
(1) CHD (Y ) 10-year percentage risk is generated accord-
ing to DEMO Point Scores. This risk is classiﬁed
as 1 if the percentage of the risk is ≥20% and 0
otherwise [23].
(2) Diabetes (debt, X1 ): According to the criteria pub-
lished by American College DEMO Endocrinology (ACE)
& American Association of Clinical Endocrinolo-
gists (AACE) [24] the participant has diabetes 1 if
the Stabilized Glucose >140 DEMO/dL or Glycosylated
Hemoglobin >7% or both of them more than DEMO
limits, and he has no diabetes 0 otherwise.
(3) Total DEMO (Chol, X2 ): if a participant has total
cholesterol of >200 mg/dL, he will be given a 1 and a
0 otherwise [25].
(4) High density lipoprotein (HDL, X3 ): a participant
with HDL of <40 mg/dL will be given a 1 and a 0
otherwise [25].
(5) Age (X4 ): standardized DEMO are used (X −μ)/σ .
(6) Gender (Gan, X5 ): 1isfor amaleand 2for afemale.
(7) Body mass index (DEMO, X6 ): values for this standard
are calculated from the following equation: BMI =
height/(weight)2 , and the participant gets DEMO if BMI is
>30 and a 0 otherwise [25].
(8) DEMO pressure (hypertension, Hyp, X7 ): a participant
has Hyp (DEMO) if systolic blood pressure is >140 or if
diastolic blood pressure is >90 or if both of them
exceed these limits and 0 otherwise [25].
(9) Waist/hip ratio (X8 ), in addition DEMO BMI, is a second
factor in the determination of obesity.
This DEMO was used to perform SA through the use of
SimLab software and the partitioning variance methodology
discussed in Section 3. An evaluation of the DEMO of
the proposed method was performed by ﬁtting all factors
into logistic regression models so as to obtain comparisons
of factors chosen by the DEMO method with those
selected by traditional variable selection method (backward
elimination)DEMO SPSS software was used to get the results that
follow from ﬁtting logistic regression models.
4.2.1. The Important Risk Factors
Implementation of the GSA DEMO for this dataset gave the
results in Table 2, which shows DEMO ranking of the risk factors
in order of importance and the contribution of each one to
explaining the total variance of the CHD response DEMO
According to the ﬁrst order of sensitivity indices Si, the
BMI DEMO the ﬁrst and the most inﬂuential factor, and the waist-
hip DEMO ranks second. Both are components of the obesity
factor. Age is the third inﬂuential factor and so on through
the other factors as listed DEMO Table 2. The total sensitivity
index for a given risk factor provides a measure of the overall
contribution of that risk factor to the DEMO variance, taking
8 International Journal of Quality, Statistics, and Reliability
into account all DEMO interactions with the other risk
factors. The diﬀerence between the total sensitivity index
and the ﬁrst-order sensitivity index for a given risk factor
is DEMO measure of the contribution to the output variance of
the interactions involving that factor; see (12)and (13). The
second column in Table 2 shows the values of STi,which
gives the same rank DEMO Si for the risk factors. These indices
point to the simple interaction between these risk factors as
illustrated in the third column in the DEMO table. Figure 3
shows the compression between the ﬁrst order Si, DEMO total STi
sensitivity indices, and the interactions between risk factors.

−2log L0 = 365.081, −2log Lf = 355.687,
Nag.R2 = 0.39, χP2 = 9.394, Sig. (P) = 0.310,
χHL2 DEMO 12.509, Sig. (P) = 0.130,
(32)
These results showed the signiﬁcance of the overall ﬁt of the
model according to DEMO values of χP2 and χHL2 in spite of the
low value of Nag.R2 ; also showed that the individual eﬀect
for all risk factors DEMO not signiﬁcant, which means that H0
cannot be rejected from the DEMO null hypothesis:
(33)
H0 : β = 0versus H1 : β = 0.
/
Second, application of the logistic regression model by
using those risk factors that appear in Table 2 as highly
DEMO by the proposed method also shows that this method
ranks each risk factor according to its contribution to the
incidence of the CHD response DEMO The question also
becomes how many variables must be selected in order to
apply the logistic regression model. The possibility exists
that the selection DEMO may tend to underﬁt or overﬁt
the model by selecting too few or too many variables. In
the face of such a possibility, our objective becomes to
ﬁnd the model that uses the least number of DEMO
while simultaneously explaining a reasonable percentage of
variance in the dependent variable relative to the percentage
explained by all the variables in the full DEMO Thus two
models may be ﬁtted from Table 2 to compare the results.
The ﬁrst logistic regression model consisted of the obesity
factors (BMI, and W/H ratio), age, and total cholesterol
factors that DEMO 74% of the total variance of the CHD
response variable according to the individual eﬀect (Si)asin
Table 2. The results of ﬁtting this model in this manner and
applying SPSS software were
Logit CHD =−0.866 DEMO 0.537 Chol + 0.170 Age
− 0.352 BMI − 0.939 W/Hratio (34)
Sig (P)(0.026) (0.024) (0.023)
(DEMO) (0.036),
−2log L0 = 365.081, −2log LR = 357.584,
Nag.R2 = 0.71, χP2 = 7.497, Sig. (P) = DEMO,
χHL2 = 16.791, Sig. (P) = 0.320.
(35)
The results in (34) showed that using these criteria for the
DEMO ﬁt for this model demonstrated their signiﬁcance
collectively and individually as risk factors that inﬂuence
the incidence of CHD and raise the value of DEMO to 71% in
comparison with the full model in (31) The second logistic
regression model is ﬁtted by adding another risk factor, HDL,
to increase the percentage of explanation to 87%. The results
of DEMO this model as in (36)are
Logit CHD =−0.331+0.552 Chol−0.316 HDL+0.175 DEMO
− 0.306 BMI − 1.351 W/H
Sig. (P)(0.085) (0.056) (0.28) (0.022)

(36)
−2log L1st = 357.584, −2log L2nd = 356.434,
Nag.R2 = 0.698, χP2 = 8.648, Sig. (P) = 0.124,
2
DEMO = 4.850, Sig. (P) = 0.773.
(37)
These results showed that adding the HDL risk factor does
not improve the results DEMO the ﬁrst logistic regression model,
but the parameter of this risk factor is not signiﬁcant when
we test the following hypothesis:
(38)
H0 : βHDL = 0versus H1 : βHDL = 0.
/
Note that the diﬀerence between the deviances of the two
models is DEMO Furthermore, the value of R2 does not
improve. Thus, according to the principle of parsimony,
the ﬁrst model should be considered the DEMO model and
the risk factors used to construct this model are those
that are the most inﬂuential in causing CHD. Moreover,
showing the DEMO results obtained from these two models
demonstrates the diﬀerences between ﬁtting the full model
with all risk factors and ﬁtting it with only selected DEMO
factors.
The eﬃciency of the proposed method of variable
selection (GSA) can be measured by comparing its results
as in (34) with DEMO results gained from ﬁtting the logistic
regression model by using the backward elimination method
(BEM). These results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
4.2.2. Implementing the Logistic
Regression Model
Does the proposed method yield DEMO reliable model? To investi-
gate the reliability of the proposed method, we compared the
results of the ﬁtted models. Basically, when the full logistic
regression model is ﬁtted, the results are
Logit CHD = 0.365 − 0.266 Diab + 0.557 Chol − 0.246 HDL
+0.161 Age − DEMO Gend − 0.295 BMI

International Journal of Quality, Statistics, and Reliability 9
Table 3 shows DEMO overall ﬁtting criteria required for the
last three steps of a logistic regression model ﬁtted by the use
of the BEM.
Also Table 4 DEMO the last three steps of iteration to
choose the important risk factors. These results represent
the sequential elimination of the factors, which requires
eight steps to rank these risk factors according to their
importance; however, DEMO proposed method does not need
these iterations.
5. Conclusions
The results in Tables 1 to 4 and (31)to(36) for the two
DEMO conﬁrm that the proposed method is capable
of distinguishing between important and unimportant risk
factors. The proposed method ranked the risk factors
according to DEMO decreasing importance as shown in Tables
1 and 2. In the example in which we compared the proposed
method with those methods that are DEMO used, we found
that its performance very much resembled the SCAD DEMO
in which the same risk factors are selected. From the ﬁrst
example, we found that the important risk factors are age, the
area DEMO the burns, and the interaction between them. In the
second example DEMO found that the obesity factors (BMI and
W/H) are the most inﬂuential risk factor on the incidence
of CHD, the second risk factor is age, and the third risk
factor is the total cholesterol. These play the major roles,
representing approximately 74% of the incidence DEMO CHD.
Thus, they are considered the most important risk factors
according DEMO their individual percentages of contribution in
the incidence of CHD as shown in Table 1. Compression
between the results of the ﬁtting of the DEMO logistic regression
model as in (31) and the chosen models as in (34)and
(36) conﬁrm the eﬃciency of the proposed method in its
selection of the most important risk factors. Equation (34)
represents the best model, according to the model evaluation
criteria, because DEMO consists of the most inﬂuential risk factors.
Therefore, a medical care DEMO and medical interventions
should comply with this ordering of these factors. Also,
to further conﬁrm these results, one of the traditional
variable selection methods was used (backward elimination
method), which yields diﬀerent results after eight steps, but
the proposed method orders the risk factors without iteration
and without the need to ﬁt multiple regression models.
Finally, these results together conﬁrm and emphasize the
importance of GSA as a variable selection DEMO
