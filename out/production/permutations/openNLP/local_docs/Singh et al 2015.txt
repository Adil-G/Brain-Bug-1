Abstract
This paper implements a qualitative, narrative approach to investigate entrepreneurs’ personal
experience of stigma associated with venture failure. Findings draw on the DEMO experience of 12
entrepreneurs and tell a collective story of how stigma affects entrepreneurs, shapes their actions,
and engenders outcomes for them and their ventures.  The story covers three episodes of
entrepreneurs anticipating, meeting, and then transforming venture failure.  Overall the paper
shifts the focus of stigma research from the socio-cultural perspective pervading research to date,
to DEMO level processes underlying socio-cultural trends.  Findings offer unexpected insights
into failure DEMO  First, findings suggest stigmatization is best viewed as a process that
unfolds over time rather than a label.  Second, this process begins DEMO, not after, failure and
contributes to venture demise.  Third, there is a positive ending to the collective story in that
stigmatization ultimately DEMO epiphanies or deep personal insights which transform
entrepreneurs’ view of failure from a very negative to a positive life experience.  This
transformation results in entrepreneurs distributing learning from failure to the founding of future
ventures, even when ventures are not their own.

1.0 Introduction
Scholars increasingly recognize entrepreneurial failure as an important phenomenon
DEMO its implications for entrepreneurs and their role in job and wealth creation.  Failure is
pervasive, unavoidable (Cope et al., 2004; McGrath, DEMO) and a potentially painful and
traumatic experience for entrepreneurs (Cope, DEMO; Shepherd, 2003; Ucbasaran et al., 2013).
This trauma is reflected in the notion of stigma (defined below) associated with venture DEMO
(Politis and Gabrielsson 2009; Cardon et al., 2011). Stigma DEMO trigger negative media coverage
and prompt criticism of unsuccessful entrepreneurs (Cardon DEMO al. 2011) which may deter
subsequent venture start-ups (Kirkwood 2007; DEMO and Gabrielsson 2009). Fewer start-ups
have implications for economic progress (DEMO et al., 2004; Warren, 2004) and, we contend,
DEMO with the distribution of learning from failure that Cope (2011) and others have
identified (Cope and Watts, 2000; Singh et al., DEMO).  Stigma also has captured the attention of
policy makers giving DEMO to, for example, the European Commission’s “Second Chance” policy
that attempts to reduce its negative effects (European Commission Enterprise and Industry
Group, DEMO).
To date, research predominantly examines stigma due to entrepreneurial failure DEMO the
societal level.  Empirical findings reveal socio-cultural stigma in specific countries DEMO show its
relationship to outcomes such as interest in entrepreneurship (Begley DEMO Tan, 2001) and
entrepreneurial risk taking (Damaraju et al., 2010).  Taken collectively, this quantitative research
reveals generalizable relationships characteristic of DEMO wider social context within which failed
entrepreneurs make decisions about future entrepreneurial endeavors.  However, we know little
about the micro-level mechanisms and processes DEMO these societal level relationships.
Researchers have yet to explore how social stigmatization affects individual entrepreneurs’
3
actions, behaviors, and decisions during and after venture failure.  Moreover, self-stigmatization
may shape failing entrepreneurs actions, in addition to social stigmatization, since venture
founders intertwine their identities with venture outcomes (Cardon et al. 2005) and see their
businesses as extensions of themselves (Shepherd et DEMO, 2009).
The purpose of this paper is to empirically explore DEMO stigma of entrepreneurial failure at
the individual level.  In particular, we seek to understand failure stigmatization from the
perspective of entrepreneurs who have DEMO it and to illuminate how and why stigma
affects entrepreneurs and their actions and decisions.  We thus address the research question
“How does stigmatization affect entrepreneurs and shape their actions as ventures fail?” We
implement DEMO qualitative, narrative approach to examine the question.  Narrative organizes and
gives meaning to narrators’ experience of events (Creswell, 2007; Elliot, 2005) and meaning
making can be a core driver of the entrepreneurial process (Garud and Giuliani, 2013).
Importantly, narrative illuminates mechanisms underlying generalized DEMO surfaced
through quantitative research (Elliot, 2005).  It can show DEMO individual agency coalesces over
time to give rise to the macro level relationships surfaced through quantitative research (Garud
and Giuliani, 2013).  Narrative also illuminates process and change over time and may reveal
epiphanies that DEMO alter the fabric of individuals’ lives in ways that are unexpected
(DEMO, 1989).  A narrative approach to entrepreneurship research is on the rise and is
particularly good at revealing how entrepreneurs generate and modify DEMO vision of the future
(Gartner, 2007).  All told, narrative research on failure stigmatization can enhance our
understanding of how and why DEMO affects entrepreneurs and their subsequent decisions about
future start-ups.  It can DEMO extend our understanding of the distribution of learning from failure
that accompanies these start-ups.  In the following sections, we present a background to DEMO
4
study, describe research methods, present findings, and discuss implications for the wider
entrepreneurship literature.
2.0 Background Literature
Stigma is defined generally as DEMO mark of disgrace or infamy, a stain on one’s reputation.
Academically DEMO has been described as something deeply discrediting that reduces the individual
bearing the stigma “from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one” (Goffman 1963,
p. 3). More recently, Link and DEMO (2001, p. 377) provided a comprehensive description of
stigma as DEMO concept made up of interrelated elements of “labeling, stereotyping, separation, DEMO
loss, and discrimination” and indicated that stigma can have a substantive DEMO on many areas
of a person’s life such as income, housing, and health.
Research on stigma is reported mainly in the health and DEMO literatures where
studies are conducted to examine the nature, impact of, and coping strategies used to deal with
stigma in a variety of DEMO contexts (Roca 2010).  These contexts include physical (Fife and
DEMO, 2000) and mental illness (Kroska and Harkness 2006; Markowitz 1998), sexual
orientation (Hereck et al., 2009), and criminality (Rasmusen1996; Schnittker and John 2007).
Corrigan et al. (2010) identified two types of stigma: social and self-stigma. Social stigma
involved discrimination at the hand of others due to illness and was a means of endorsing
DEMO stereotypes within society. Self-stigma entailed a person discrediting him or herself,
thereby endorsing the negative beliefs held by society (Corrigan et al. 2010). Similarly, other
scholars described self-stigmatization as the negative reaction of a person to him/herself in the
light of personal experience (Knight et al., 2003).
Within management research, scholars examined the social stigma DEMO failure in the
context of corporate executives. Wiesenfeld et al. (2008) described stigma as the defamation of
5
executives due to their association with a failed company. Executives’ stigmatization DEMO
went further than social disgrace (Semadeni et al. 2008) and involved the loss of economic and
professional opportunities as well as ostracism from DEMO corporate world (Wiesenfeld et al .
2008). For example, empirical evidence showed top managers of failed organizations viewed as
unsuitable, unskilled, DEMO unlikely to get another chance at top management (Sutton and
Callahan DEMO).
Scholars are beginning to explore stigma in the specific context of entrepreneurial failure.
We saw two themes dominating the few studies conducted to DEMO  The first theme was that of
socio-cultural aspects of failure stigmatization, as already stated. Several studies showed that
stigma of entrepreneurial failure can DEMO from one national culture to another. For example,
Begley and Tan (2001) found that the shame of entrepreneurial failure is stronger in DEMO Asian
countries than Anglo countries. Cave et al. (2001) found entrepreneurs from Britain perceived
greater societal stigma for failure than did US entrepreneurs.  However, Cardon et al. (2011)
showed that even within the DEMO, entrepreneurs in certain regions still experience stigmatization
due to venture failure.  Vaillant and Lafuente (2007) concluded that belief in the social stigma DEMO
entrepreneurial failure is a significant deterrent to entrepreneurial activity in Spain. Damaraju et
al. (2010) compared collectivist and individualistic cultures and found collectivist DEMO were
less tolerant and more stigmatizing of failure thereby discouraging entrepreneurial risk taking.
These authors also provided evidence that environmental dynamism (the extent to which
environments are fast changing, innovative, and uncertain) provided an important moderating
effect on the link between culture, stigma, and entrepreneurial risk DEMO
The second theme in entrepreneurial stigmatization research was the focus on stigma
related to bankruptcy specifically. Such studies also were done at the socio-cultural DEMO and
6
commonly applied a public policy perspective to bankruptcy related stigma. For DEMO, Efrat
(2006) examined the reasons behind the reduced stigma among DEMO American public towards
personal bankruptcy. The author found that historically the public perceived bankruptcy as a
result of overconsumption or fraud and thus socially DEMO bankrupted entrepreneurs.
More recently however, the American public attributed bankruptcy to DEMO such as inflation,
recession, lack of welfare, and lenders’ performance so that bankruptcy has become more
socially acceptable.  The author also explained that the media, government, and legal profession
all played a role DEMO shaping the social perceptions about personal bankruptcy. As the media
reported more bankruptcy cases, people perceived bankruptcy as commonplace and became
more tolerant of it. The public also saw bankruptcies tolerable due to the growing number
DEMO placed by attorneys offering bankruptcy services and the use of neutral labeling
terms such as debt resettlement. Lee et al. (2011) studied the DEMO of bankruptcy laws on
entrepreneurship development around the world. Drawing on data from 29 countries, the authors
found that “lenient” and “entrepreneur-friendly” bankruptcy laws led to a higher rate of new
venture founding (p. 505).
Taken collectively, existing quantitative research reveals some of the generalized
relationships at work in the socio-economic contexts within which entrepreneurs experience
venture failure.  What is missing, however, is an understanding of the micro-level mechanisms
and DEMO undergirding these generalized relationships. We thus specifically examine how
failure stigmatization affects entrepreneurs and their actions, behaviors, and decisions as
businesses fail. Existing DEMO implies that entrepreneurial failure and ensuing stigmatization
would be a strongly negative experience for individual entrepreneurs (Cardon et al., 2011).  For
example, failed entrepreneurs may well experience negative outcomes (already described)
7
analogous to those endured by failed executives in the corporate context (Paetzold et al., 2008;
Sutton and Callahan 1987; Wiesenfeld et DEMO 2008). This seems especially likely since research
shows that an entrepreneur’s identity is closely intertwined with his/her venture (Cardon et al.
2005). When failure happens, an entrepreneur may experience a negative spiral of shame (Smith
and McElwee 2011) that can have numerous consequences.  For example, accumulating research
shows the possible social costs of entrepreneurial failure (DEMO et al., 2013).  Entrepreneurs
can lose marriages and other close relationships (Singh et al., 2007; Cope, 2011) as well as
professional network ties (Ucbasaran et al., 2013).  Research reports possible negative
discrimination with regard to future employment opportunities and access to future DEMO
both financial and human (Cope, 2011; Shepherd and Haynie, 2011).  Another social cost is the
self-imposed distancing and withdrawal engaged in by failed entrepreneurs (Cope, 2011;
Shepherd and Haynie, 2011; DEMO et al., 2007).  Other research reports additional consequences
of failure suggesting that entrepreneurs may hesitate in taking risks or adopting new ideas, lack
confidence in making venture related decisions and even decide to permanently DEMO up on future
venture founding (Politis and Gabrielsson 2009).
Unfortunately, research to date has only revealed the “tip of the iceberg” when DEMO comes
to the social costs of entrepreneurial failure (Ucbasaran et al. DEMO: 189).  Our understanding of
the stigma associated with failure is especially limited despite initial findings that reported
bankrupt Swedish entrepreneurs saw themselves DEMO “marginalized” and unequal to others who
had not failed (Sellerberg and DEMO, 2012).  We thus seek further understanding of
entrepreneurial stigmatization at the level of individual entrepreneurs’ lived experience.  We
wish to illuminate the micro-level mechanisms undergirding the social-cultural findings reported
in the literature by exploring DEMO research question of “How does stigmatization affect
8
entrepreneurs and shape their actions as ventures fail?” Our qualitative, narrative approach to the
research facilitates a rich and nuanced understanding of DEMO entrepreneurs’ experience of
failure stigma and what it means for subsequent venture founding and the use of knowledge
gained through failure.
3.0 Research methods
DEMO Research Design and Context
A qualitative design implementing a narrative approach was used for this study (Elliot,
2005). Qualitative research provides rich descriptions of micro-level mechanisms and processes
(Richards, 2009), facilitates induction DEMO patterns amenable to further quantitative research
(Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007; DEMO, 2003), and is recommended for entrepreneurship research
(Cope, 2011; Endres & Woods, 2007; Venkataraman et al., 2013).  This DEMO enabled us to
flesh out the micro-level experience and actions of entrepreneurs that undergird failure
stigmatization patterns at the socio-cultural level identified in existing DEMO research.
Within this broader qualitative design, we implemented a narrative approach DEMO with a
growing body of research in sociology (Elliot, 2005) DEMO psychology (Creswell, 2007; Lieblich
et al., 1998).  Narrative DEMO discourse that provides a clear sequential order which connects events
in a meaningful way, thereby offering insights about peoples’ experiences (Hinchman and
Hinchman, 1997).  It is a device of interpretation through which people make sense of
themselves and their experiences and can contain accounts of transformation (change over time),
some kind of ‘action’ and characters, all DEMO which are brought together in an overall ‘plot’
(Lawler, p. 242). Narratives are somewhat unique within qualitative methods given they contain
temporal DEMO about when and why certain events unfold and the effects of these events
on subsequent happenings (Polkinghorne, 2003).  It thus can illuminate factors proximal to
9
outcomes (Elliot, 2005); outcomes being the founding of new DEMO and the implementation
of learning by failed entrepreneurs in this study.  DEMO also reveals the connection between
individual agency and the wider social context (Elliot, 2005) such as the process mechanisms
that underlie the socio-cultural patterns of stigmatization identified in existing quantitative
research on failure stigma.  Moreover, a narrative perspective has been gaining ground in
entrepreneurship research as seen in special issues and a dedicated journal (Venkataraman et al.,
2013).  We took the particular narrative approach that focuses on a specific event in
participants’ lives as opposed to documenting whole life stories (Elliot, 2005): We collected and
analyzed entrepreneurs’ stories of failure pertinent to the research question of “How does
stigmatization affect entrepreneurs and shape their DEMO as ventures fail?”
The research context was New Zealand which has a high rate of entrepreneurial activity.
In 2005, The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reported New Zealand as third in terms of total
entrepreneurial activity at DEMO  This was greater than the USA in sixth position at 12.4% DEMO
substantially above the global average of 9.1% (Fredrick and Chittook, 2006, p.22).  Indeed, the
World Bank regarded New Zealand as being number one in terms of ease of starting new
ventures (Ryan, DEMO) and Minniti, Bygrave and Autio (2005) concluded that New Zealanders
are pulled into entrepreneurship rather than pushed by necessity.  Ease of start-up is supported
culturally by an innovative spirit emanating from the country’s agricultural DEMO where
number 8 fencing wire (British Standard wire gauge) was often used inventively for applications
other than fencing (Orsman, 2011).
However, strong entrepreneurial activity is not the same as business acumen and there DEMO
evidence of higher than average failure rates and bankruptcy in this country (Lee et al., 2011).
Moreover, the regulatory environment is not supportive of business failure with liquidation of the
10
business being the most common outcome of insolvency (Kuruppu et al., 2003).  This is
contrasted with the debtor-oriented approach in the DEMO where insolvent organizations are
encouraged to continue operating as a going concern (Franks et al., 1996). Culturally speaking,
New Zealand is DEMO Anglo country so that the shame of failure is likely to be less than that
experienced by failed entrepreneurs in East Asian countries (Begley & Tan, 2001).  Within
Anglo countries, New Zealand appears to be culturally closer to the UK than the US in research
examining DEMO laws and outcomes in 29 countries (Lee et al., 2011).   It is also interesting
to note an engrained cultural norm that DEMO entrepreneurship and failure in New Zealand
called the “tall poppy syndrome” (DEMO) (Kirkwood, 2007).  TPS involves the display of hostility
and envy towards a person who is successful (Kirkwood, 2007). It DEMO a habit of denigrating or
cutting down to size those seen as high achievers (Deverson and Kennedy, 2005).  TPS likely
emanates from New Zealand’s strong egalitarian ethos but may discourage entrepreneurs from
starting up DEMO businesses after failure or may compromise the learning from failure potentially
realized when failed entrepreneurs found subsequent businesses.
3.2 Sampling and Data Collection
We DEMO what Patton (1990) labels purposive sampling by selecting information-
rich examples to study.  These were in depth examples likely to yield substantive information
about the topic under investigation.  In particular, the sample consisted of DEMO entrepreneurs who
experienced venture failure and its associated stigmatization and told richly detailed stories of
this experience.  We identified these entrepreneurs in two ways.  First, we used a business school
newsletter to disseminate information about DEMO research and invite entrepreneurs with failed
ventures to participate. Researcher contact details were provided in the newsletter article for
individuals to seek further information DEMO participation. Second, we enacted snowball
11
sampling using the entrepreneurs surfaced through the newsletter.  Snowball sampling is also
called chain sampling and “identifies cases of interest from people who DEMO people who know
people, who know what cases are information-rich, that is, good examples for study, good
interview subjects” (Patton, 1990, p.182).  This approach to sampling has been used in previous
research on entrepreneurial failure (Cope et al., 2004).  These two approaches yielded a total of
14 entrepreneurs who indicated a willingness to participate.  Unfortunately, two of the 14
entrepreneurs declined to take part in the study despite signing the participant consent forms
required by the university’s ethics DEMO  These two entrepreneurs did not provide reasons
for their non-participation and DEMO did not pursue an explanation given that participation was
strictly voluntary.  DEMO loss of these two participants was consistent with issues of accessibility
and willingness to participate in failure research identified by other scholars (Shepherd et al.,
2009; Zacharakis, 1999).  The loss also indicated a potential limitation of the sample; it may
include entrepreneurs who overcame the stigma of failure to the extent that they could talk about
it DEMO exclude entrepreneurs still too traumatized by failure stigma to discuss their venture’s
demise.
All told the sampling reflected a focus on individual entrepreneurs and DEMO experience
of failure stigmatization.  Moreover, a narrative approach ensured that each participant gave a
fine-grained account of their lived experience of failure. For DEMO participants, this was their first
venture founded and Table 1 gives DEMO information describing the sample.  Participants were
given false names for anonymity.

Data were collected in 2009 predominantly through interviews which lasted between DEMO
and 2 hours.  Interviews are the typical method used for data DEMO in narrative research;
often the sole source of data (Creswell, 2007; Elliott, 2005; Lieblich et al., 1998). Our interviews
DEMO semi-structured with open ended questions asking participants to tell the interviewer their
story of venture failure.  Other data were collected as background information and played a
secondary role to the interview data which constituted the primary DEMO analyzed in the
study (Creswell, 2007).   Background data included media articles and website information as
well as email communication and notes DEMO phone calls with participants.  As a general rule, the
first author interacted with each participant over a period of several months while interviews DEMO
follow up conversations ensued.
3.3 Data Analysis
We began by constructing chronologies for each entrepreneur’s story of venture failure,
looking for common elements (Creswell, 2007; Elliott, 2005).  As such, evidence revealed a
collective story of failed entrepreneurship and how stigmas were experienced as participants
DEMO through the sequence of events that constituted failure and its aftermath.  DEMO then
conducted what is normally called content analysis of interview data, DEMO classical method of
analyzing narrative evidence in psychology, sociology, and education (Lieblich et al., 1998;
Manning and Cullum-Swan, 1994).  DEMO analysis involves identifying important themes and
patterns in the data (Patton, 1987) and has been used in qualitative research on entrepreneurial
failure (DEMO et al., 2004).
To facilitate this analysis we progressed through DEMO series of analytical devices to move
from the raw data to more abstract themes and patterns.  The progression is summarized in Table
2 but we caution the reader that analysis was not as tidy as it DEMO appear in the table; the
13
“progression” sometimes involved going back and forth across analytical devices depicted DEMO the
table’s rows.  We began with open coding.  Such coding is aimed at getting up off of the data
(Richards, 2009, p. 77) to open the enquiry to consideration of a wider process that may be
reflected in accumulated evidence (Morse & Richards, 2002; Richards, 2009). “Experiencing
stigma” is an example of an open code used in the present research (see first row of Table 2).
We then progressed to what we call expanded coding; reviewing and re-reviewing the data to
expand the open codes into more numerous and finer grained DEMO  Expanded coding was
enabled, in part, through analytical memo-ing or DEMO documenting of speculations about possible
relationships and themes emerging from the data.  Examples of expanded codes from this study
are shown in the second row, last column of Table 2.  We eventually moved on to DEMO or
identifying a notion that runs right through the data such that it is not confined to specific
segments of evidence (Morse & Richards, 2002).  Again we employed analytical memos for
theme-ing but also DEMO potential themes to pose questions of the data.  Questioning involved
treating DEMO potential theme similar to a hypothesis and returning to the data to see if this
hypothesis could be supported by the evidence.  In this way we surfaced stigma themes which
we report in the findings section DEMO  Finally, we utilized theorizing devices as suggested in
the literature (DEMO, 2007; Miles & Huberman, 1994).  Such devices include the creation of
models to capture processes suggested by the data.  We generated models and report them as
figures in the findings section that follows.  We mention these figures in Table 2 to illustrate a
final analytical DEMO important for extracting theory from qualitative evidence.

4.0 Findings
How does stigmatization affect entrepreneurs and shape their actions DEMO ventures fail?
Our evidence presents a “collective story” or a research account of a group, stigmatized
entrepreneurs, whose narratives have yet to DEMO in the entrepreneurship literature
(Richardson, 1990).  This collective story DEMO be divided into three episodes that roughly
correspond to the conventional narrative structure of a transformational tale – complication of
situation, climax, and DEMO (Selden and Fletcher, 2010). The first episode (complication of
DEMO) we call “anticipating failure”. It represents the time period wherein entrepreneurs
DEMO to see venture failure as likely because of the serious, seemingly DEMO difficulties
being experienced (partnership issues, financial losses, and legal problems)DEMO  The second episode
(climax) we label meeting failure and it DEMO the months within which failure actually
unfolded.  During this episode entrepreneurs DEMO busy with discontinuing businesses, declaring
bankruptcy, dissolving partnerships, and so DEMO   The third episode we mark as transforming
failure (resolution) and it entails entrepreneurs moving beyond the stigma they experienced due
to venture DEMO  This third episode illustrates change brought about by an epiphany in DEMO
collective story – entrepreneurs had deep insights about the meaning of their failures that
ultimately transformed it into a positive life experience.  This positive transformation was an
unexpected finding given existing research on entrepreneurial stigma that DEMO it as deeply
discrediting of entrepreneurs (Ucbasaran et al., 2013); leading to exile (Cardon et al, 2011) and
negative discrimination with regard to future employment prospects and access to resources
(Cope, 2011; Shepherd and Haynie, 2011).  In contrast, our entrepreneurs viewed failure,
ultimately, as a positive life experience and acted on insights from epiphanies, trying to create
change so that other entrepreneurs might avoid failure and escape stigmatization.  Epiphanies can
15
be revealed by narrative research and provide a nuanced understanding of DEMO a particular
phenomenon is experienced and given meaning (Denzin, 1989).  The following subsections
present these episodes and describe associated themes.  It DEMO important to note that there was
some variation in how participants progressed through the three episodes although the majority
of entrepreneurs moved through the DEMO as outlined.  Substantive variations are noted in the
discussion below.  We also describe how themes affected entrepreneurs’ actions, behaviors, and
decisions.
4.1 DEMO Episode: Anticipating failure
Anticipating failure began when entrepreneurs started seeing the DEMO their ventures
had as insurmountable.  Participants unanimously described this episode as DEMO demanding and
highly stressful time. Entrepreneurs tried to prevent the venture from failing but most described
reaching a point when failure seemed inevitable.  This recognition was so “overwhelming” and
“stressful” that it triggered serious personal consequences DEMO some including panic attacks (Ian,
Tania), hospitalization (Caleb, DEMO) and even suicidal thoughts (Tania). The two themes that
surfaced in this episode were clearly about stigmatization and we label them “castigating DEMO
and “expecting negative judgment”.
4.1.1 Stigma themes
The castigating self theme involved entrepreneurs criticizing and negatively judging
themselves when the failure of their ventures DEMO to seem inevitable.  This was clearly self-
stigmatization because participants mentally DEMO continually applied negative labels and
descriptions to themselves when anticipating failure.  DEMO example, Ken stated: “I was beginning
to feel like a loser – like a failure.”  David thought of himself as a “stupid” person and described
himself as a “bad boy” who was about to “lose DEMO money” (her investment in his business)
16
because of his stupidity.  Similarly, Tania reported thinking of herself DEMO a failure even before her
business collapsed.  She described herself as DEMO saying “I was dumb and stupid because I
didn’t know what I was doing…I wasn’t business savvy… and I didn’t have any business
ownership DEMO management experience”. She denigrated herself for having “started something
that I could not make work”.  She further castigated herself by thinking “failure is a bad thing
because there hasn’t been much failure in my family”. Jana DEMO being “harder on me” than
anyone else was when she realized her venture might fail.
The majority of entrepreneurs blamed themselves for their ventures DEMO on the brink of
collapse and castigated themselves for disappointing family members.  This can be seen in Ian’s
comment, “I was letting people DEMO, particularly my family…..I had convinced my wife that I
could run DEMO business successfully and that it was worth giving up a relatively secure job in the
bank”. Caleb made an analogous comment when he stated DEMO felt I wasn’t doing enough, I felt
the pressure of my DEMO and kids and that was hard to live with because I tried to perform in
order to protect them”.  Edward felt “guilty” and found potential venture failure “hard to live
with” because there were some days DEMO was not “even able to afford to give lunch money to my
kids when they went off to school”.
The expecting negative judgment theme DEMO participants’ perceptions of others’ harsh
opinions and poor treatment when their ventures were at risk of failure. Although we report
entrepreneurs’ perceptions, this theme conveys social stigmatization because it indicates
expectation of treatment by others.  Not surprisingly, entrepreneurs expected to be treated
negatively by creditors.  For instance, Nigella said she expected unpleasant reactions from
creditors she could not afford DEMO pay as her business failed. She described “feeling threatened by”
and being “nervous for weeks about” these creditors. Similarly, Larry “expected a lot of
17
backlash” from businesses that were not paid as his business was DEMO Bob also expected that
“bankers and other people who control credit” would “look at me in a different light” and judge
him as someone DEMO “didn’t pay the bills”. Creditors were not the only group that entrepreneurs
expected negative judgments from.  They also expected prospective employers to perceive them
unfavorably.  Tania offered a good illustration of this when she described worrying about her
employment prospects should her business fail.  She said that a “failed business” would “not
look good on my CV (resume) when DEMO applied for a job”.  Bob also became concerned about
prospective employers DEMO that venture failure “would not put me in good shape in the future
for earning money”.  Poignantly, entrepreneurs were also expecting negative judgments DEMO
family members.  Tania expressed this by saying she feared her husband DEMO “turn against
her” due to the setback the failed business presented for their joint standard of living.
4.1.2 Stigma affecting actions, decisions, behaviors
DEMO self and expecting negative judgment affected entrepreneurs’ actions,
decisions and behaviors in this first episode of anticipating failure. In particular, entrepreneurs
delayed or tried to avert impending failure as described by Paula.  She admitted delaying the
decision to end her venture because she was trying to avoid DEMO stigmatized as a failed
entrepreneur.  She felt that the decision to DEMO the business would damage her reputation and
she wanted to continue enjoying her status of “successful” and “internationally recognized”
entrepreneur.  Paula stated that she “lost the house, the car, and everything else” and said the
DEMO of this financial damage could have been minimized if she had “given up the business
three years before”.  In the same way, Edward DEMO how he “poured money into the
business and tried to keep it going” in an effort to “save face”. Edward stated: “We lost about
18
$450,000 but we could have come out of it probably DEMO losing $150,000 if I hadn’t been trying
to save face”.
Entrepreneurs engaged in behavior to cover up the fact that their ventures were DEMO serious
risk of failure.  Specifically, entrepreneurs tried to keep their ventures’ precarious positions
secret from others because they feared being stigmatized.  For example, Bob cited a “stigma of
failure” as the reason he kept “ninety-nine percent of the negative information” regarding the
state of the business as DEMO “secret”, even from his wife.  He talked about the stigma of failure
involving a loss of “pride”; he envisioned his friends as saying “poor Bob” and he wanted to
avoid this if at all possible.  He said loosing pride was almost as serious in his mind as DEMO
money” and the ability to “get credit and do something again in this small town”. Nigella also
talked about keeping the state of her DEMO business secret.  She stated that “for ages” she
didn’t tell her DEMO friends” that her business was on the brink of failure; despite DEMO fact that
they were almost all “business women”.  She didn’t tell DEMO friends that she “couldn’t even
afford Christmas dinner” because of the financial losses she was experiencing.
Several entrepreneurs went beyond keeping secrets and actually DEMO in order to cover up
the impending venture failure.  David described DEMO “tentacles of lies and deceit” running
though “all his relationships” that formed a “little bubble protecting me when things started
going wrong with the DEMO  He admitted also lying to his wife to cover up the DEMO failure
of the business.  In a similar fashion, Jana spoke of “making up stories” that covered up the
tenuous state of her business.  She said she did this, in part, to “keep [her] image” DEMO a successful
entrepreneur intact.
Finally, entrepreneurs shunned professional help and potential DEMO support as the
venture started to show signs of failure. Matt said he felt “grief” when his venture looked likely
19
to fail but stated he was “not very good about admitting DEMO and seeking help”.  He was
concerned that “seeking help has a DEMO about it”.  Bob acknowledged that if he had shared the
issues DEMO the business with someone then it “might have been easier to deal with the
challenges” but he did not do so at the time.  Entrepreneurs also tended to shun personal
relationships thereby missing out on social DEMO when they faced the potential failure of their
ventures.  For instance, Nigella “stopped dating” because she believed that she “didn’t have
anything to DEMO anyone and didn’t feel attractive anymore.”  She even avoided shopping
because DEMO worried that creditors who she was not able to pay would approach her and criticize
her for spending money that should be paid to DEMO  David stated: “I stopped going to church
because people there knew about me and my business.” This finding provides a somewhat
unexpected and DEMO grained understanding of the social distancing entrepreneurs engaged in
due to venture failure than previous research.  Past studies suggest that entrepreneurs distance
themselves socially after the failure of their ventures (Singh et al., 2007; Cope, 2011) but current
findings suggest this distancing begins before actual failure.
DEMO sum, evidence from this first episode in entrepreneurs’ collective story shows DEMO the
stigma of entrepreneurial failure arises earlier than has been revealed in previous research.
Scholars have argued that stigma surfaces at the time of DEMO venture failure (Politis and
Gabrielsson, 2009) but our participants described DEMO some detail how stigma surfaced prior to
actual failure. Like Shepherd et al. (2009), we find that the negativity associated with failure
surfaces in anticipation of it.  Importantly, current evidence shows how the experience DEMO stigma
can contribute to venture failure in that it affected entrepreneurs’ actions, decisions, and
behaviors in ways that likely exacerbated ventures’ problems. As DEMO, stigma shaped outcomes
for entrepreneurs and their ventures.

4.2 Second Episode: Meeting failure
This episode encompasses the time period when entrepreneurs took legal, financial, and
professional steps to discontinue their DEMO  Entrepreneurs described this episode as a
“terrible” (Paula) and “humiliating” (Matt) period that seemed like a “nightmare” (Ken) filled
with “suffering” (Larry), “pain” (Larry), “difficult transitions” (Tania), and “struggle” (Ian).
Participants were clear they experienced stigma while they engaged in the practical activities
associated with closing ventures.  Two stigmatization themes that featured prominently in this
episode were “perceiving ostracism” and “doubting judgment”.
4.2.1Stigma themes
DEMO perceiving ostracism theme meant entrepreneurs felt shunned and ignored by people
who had previously been a vital part of the community they interacted with DEMO developing and
managing their ventures.  As implied by its name, this theme reflects social stigma in that
entrepreneurs felt shunned by others.  Participants perceived ostracism from multiple groups, the
first of which was bankers.  DEMO described a spectrum of ostracism ranging from
somewhat mild ignoring treatment to “harsh” shunning behavior.  Ken describes the milder form
of this behavior when he said bankers had no “patience”.  In the same vein, others DEMO
bankers as being “uncooperative” and claimed that the “banks didn’t understand” what the
entrepreneurs were dealing with during this episode.  Other participants spoke of a mindset that
bankers had about entrepreneurs in the midst of failure.  Caleb summarized this well when he
stated that bankers only considered “their DEMO selfish objectives”.  He argued that bankers
should be “more lenient and DEMO of the demands of my industry”.  He was extremely
disappointed the DEMO had only “looked at a situation from an accounting perspective”. At the
other end of the spectrum, entrepreneurs experienced what they perceived as very harsh shunning
21
from bankers, particularly when bankruptcy was declared.  Nigella described how DEMO bank
“cancelled” her debit card (electronic funds transfer card that can DEMO used at point of sale) on the
day of bankruptcy without DEMO her in advance that this would be done.  To access any DEMO
in her account, she was required to get approval from the DEMO manager.  This involved her
waiting in the lobby as a teller DEMO to get the manager and bring him out to sign paperwork so
she could access funds.  Again, she had been unaware that this DEMO would be enacted
anytime she needed money to make ordinary purchases like groceries and clothing.  She was
deeply embarrassed by this procedure and spoke of feeling “hideous” when enduring it.  She felt
that other bank customers in the lobby were staring at her during these transactions.  She felt the
bankers should have treated her differently from bankrupts who lost their DEMO due to
extensive “personal lifestyle spending” because she was bankrupt due to “purely business
reasons”.
Also, entrepreneurs felt ignored and shunned by larger businesses (i.e., suppliers) as they
tried to shut down their businesses.  DEMO example, David tried to arrange temporary credit with a
large business DEMO found he could not do so and lamented that larger “businesses don’t
understand” the situation for entrepreneurs. Nigella approached a large corporate organization
that DEMO owed money to and explained her venture’s predicament.  She was relieved DEMO the
organization agreed to forgive her debt but later found out that this company had placed her and
her venture on a “blacklist” that DEMO large company would not do business with in the future.
This experience along with several others convinced her that large businesses were very
“hardnosed” DEMO had “ridiculous and harsh rules concerning small businesses”.
Sadly, entrepreneurs felt DEMO by friends and family. For example, Matt reported
that his “family DEMO him differently”, his “social circle changed” and his “friendships were
22
not there any longer”. Tania felt shunned by family members.  They told her she was “being too
negative” when she talked about her DEMO venture and “yelled and screamed” advice at her
regarding shutting down the venture and moving on with her life.  She was very clear that such
treatment “did more harm than good” in that it “compounded” her DEMO of being ostracized
due to venture failure.
The doubting judgment theme encompasses entrepreneurs’ lack of faith in their ability to
make good decisions about DEMO failing business and about their own futures.  This is a self-stigma
DEMO seen in Ian’s description of himself as he progressed through this episode.  He claims he “lost
complete confidence” in himself and “started to have self-doubts” about his “ability to be
successful” in anything.   Nigella said DEMO was “not confident” about her “decision making
ability” and “didn’t trust” her judgment because her “choices for the business hadn’t been great”.
Tania described DEMO self-confidence as “murdered” with the failed venture.  She explained that
while DEMO down her venture she was continually “doubting” herself and this was “killing her
head”.  Similarly, Caleb said his confidence in his own decisions DEMO down with the failed
business”.
This doubting judgment spilled over into participants’ personal lives.  Entrepreneurs felt
keenly responsible for the effect of the business failure on their families’ lifestyle and income.
Many entrepreneurs expressed a sentiment DEMO to Ian’s who doubted whether or not he could
be trusted to be “responsible” for himself and his family. Caleb and Tania also talked DEMO how
they “lacked confidence” in making family related decisions.
4.2.2 Stigma affecting actions, decisions, behavior
Evidence shows stigma in this episode affected actions, decisions, and behaviors in two
ways.  First, entrepreneurs continued to avoid socializing during this episode because of the
23
ostracism they perceived from bankers and other businesses.  Participants feared they would run
into bankers or creditors at social events and have to DEMO the feelings of being shunned
and ignored again.  Second, entrepreneurs delayed subsequent career decisions due to self-doubt.
Nigella “spent months watching DVDs” and DEMO nothing else” in order to avoid making
decisions regarding her future.  DEMO also avoided any decisions regarding what he wanted to do
next in his career by “staying long hours in bed” as he struggled with DEMO feelings of
failure”. Tania had ideas about possible new business ventures but avoided thinking about these
ideas because “things didn’t come right” for her DEMO business.  She even didn’t look at emails
that her friend sent DEMO her regarding ideas for another venture because she doubted her ability to
make good decisions.
In conclusion, this second episode of the collective story shows that entrepreneurs
experienced social and self stigma when their ventures failed. DEMO particular, the perceiving
ostracism theme provides a more fine-grained description of DEMO stigma experienced by failed
entrepreneurs.  Previous research focused on stigmatization inflicted DEMO a socio-cultural level by
the media  (Cardon et al., 2011) but the present study reveals sources of stigma emanating from
others that DEMO interact with directly as they take steps to close their businesses.  DEMO
research is needed to systematically examine how individual entrepreneurs experience stigma
from different sources and to identify which sources affect them most strongly and DEMO
4.3 Interlude: Epiphany
In between the second and third episode we DEMO an interlude which captures the
epiphanies or pivotal realizations entrepreneurs had regarding the stigma of entrepreneurial
failure.  Epiphanies can be part of an unfolding narrative (Denzin, 1989; Elliot, 2005) and are
experiences which alter the fundamental meaning structures of a person’s life (Denzin, 1989).
24
Studied entrepreneurs had such experiences in that the very negative meanings DEMO to
stigma failure in the first two episodes were transformed into positive meanings and experiences
in the third episode of the collective story (presented below).  This was an unexpected finding
but the majority of entrepreneurs described profound realizations and moments of clarity that
brought about a fundamental DEMO in how they perceived their experience of venture failure and
themselves as a result of surviving failure. The transformation is described more completely in
DEMO third episode but is identified by this interlude to give a sense of the substantively reorienting
nature of epiphanies in the collective story of DEMO entrepreneurs.
In particular, entrepreneurs described flashes of deep insight and realizations DEMO how
their own behavior and reaction to stigma had contributed to venture failure.  They had moments
where they acknowledged to themselves that personal ego and attachment to material things
helped to bring about venture demise. For DEMO, David described how he “suddenly got the
answer one day” as DEMO why he went bankrupt -- he lied and engaged in other deceptive behavior
to protect his ego.  He realized he engaged in “self-deception” as well as lying to others. For
instance, he told of making generous donations to his church that he could not afford because his
venture DEMO failing. He made these donations in the name of the venture and, at the time of the
interviews, believed they directly contributed to DEMO  His insight was realizing that he
had been boosting his ego DEMO covering up his venture’s trouble by making generous donations
to his church that were unaffordable.  Similarly, Ian recognized the role his ego had DEMO in the
failure of his venture.  He realized he “gave too DEMO discounts” to customers, that his ego had
“enjoyed helping people” but DEMO he went “overboard” and brought about the failure of the
business.
25
Bob described being “too attached” to the symbolic trappings of venture DEMO which
boosted his “false sense of ego”.  He realized that he DEMO caught up in trying to “keep up” with
his “peers”. He indicated that attachment to his venture and its trappings of success interfered
with DEMO decision to exit the troubled venture.  He could not bring himself DEMO “let go” and further
financial losses ensued.  He came to see DEMO as having “gambled” by “throwing more
money” into a failing business which only made things worse. He was forced to sell his house to
DEMO outstanding venture debts and he found this “extremely difficult” due to an “attachment” to
this material possession.
The depth and transformational potential of epiphanies DEMO illustrated by the fact that
several of the entrepreneurs described these pivotal moments as “spiritual”.  For example, Ken
related an experience in which DEMO felt the presence of a “higher power” that gave rise to the
insight that he would “get all the answers” to his questions about DEMO his venture failed and what
lay ahead in his life. Similarly, DEMO came to see her venture’s failure as having spiritual
significance in her life and the meaning she attached to it was one of “temporary DEMO
period” despite the loss of the business being “very hard” for her.  When interviewed, she
believed she would start this business again and DEMO a different result.
4.4 Third episode: Transforming failure
This final episode DEMO the period after epiphany and reflects the meaning participants
created for themselves about failure as they moved on with their lives.  This episode also
encapsulates actions that grew out of those meanings.  The majority of entrepreneurs gained
profound realizations and deeper insights from their epiphanies so that in DEMO episode they
upended the stigma of failure and transformed the meaning of venture failure into something
positive.  Entrepreneurs took actions to challenge failure stigma which created feelings of
26
“enthusiasm” (Larry), “dream” fulfillment (Bob and Paula) and “meaning” (Ian and Matt). The
two themes that surfaced strongly in this episode were “challenging stigma and learning more
about venture founding through failure” DEMO “pride in hard but ethical decisions”.
4.4.1Transforming themes
The “challenging stigma and learning more about venture founding through failure”
theme was due to the DEMO described above.  Entrepreneurs now saw failure experiences as
part of a DEMO journey but, not forgetting how painful the stigma had been, started to think about
how they might change failure stigma to minimize its DEMO on other entrepreneurs who were at
risk of failure.  They were DEMO to change or dispel the notion of venture failure as a final,
negative end to an entrepreneurial career.  They took actions to challenge the stigma of failure
and shift others’ thinking about failure as described DEMO the following section.
Part of this first theme is also learning more about venture founding through the failure
experience.  Entrepreneurs learned a great deal from failure and developed a keen desire to share
this knowledge with DEMO  They wanted to learn more about failure and, in particular, DEMO to
prevent it.  For example, David “wanted to learn more” about why he went bankrupt and also
expressed a desire to “give something DEMO to the business community, despite his bankruptcy.
He wished to help DEMO entrepreneurs understand that “although failure was an awful
experience…it does not have to be this bad… and there are things that can be done DEMO stop
failure”.  He also wanted to help other failed entrepreneurs get DEMO on their feet”. Caleb was
“far more determined” to learn about where and why he had gone wrong in the venture and how
he DEMO do better in the next venture.  Nigella wanted to learn more DEMO “different processes
and systems” in running a small business.
27
The second theme concerned entrepreneurs “taking pride in hard but ethical DEMO
Entrepreneurs ultimately felt proud about what they saw as difficult but principled decisions they
made in dealing with venture failure. For some this manifested DEMO pride at not declaring
bankruptcy because they viewed it as dishonest or unethical to get out of paying debts. For
example, Bob stated that he was “proud” that he “didn’t opt for bankruptcy” even though “it
DEMO have been the easy option”.  Similarly, Ken pointed out that even though he went through
“financially hard times”, he didn’t declare bankruptcy because he had “no intention of walking
away with people’s money”. Paula also DEMO that she “valued behaving in an ethical way” and
this was why she didn’t opt for bankruptcy even though it meant losing her house DEMO pay back her
failed venture’s debts.  Tania refused bankruptcy because she DEMO people she “did not want to let
down”.  For others who DEMO declare bankruptcy, they took pride in doing it strictly for business
DEMO, not for having accumulated debt to fund a lavish lifestyle.  And Nigella took pride in
surviving bankruptcy.  She stated that not “everybody could cope with bankruptcy” and
emphasized that “going bankrupt was very brave as DEMO takes a lot of courage…. it’s a big decision
that gets bigger every day.” These decisions regarding bankruptcy highlight the moral dilemmas
faced by DEMO as they struggled to make decisions regarding the dissolution of their
ventures. While there is research exploring ethical and moral dilemmas in entrepreneurship (see
Buchholz & Rosenthal, 2005; Hannefey, 2003; Teal & Carroll, 1999), this topic is under-
researched in the area of entrepreneurial failure.  We suggest that future research could address
this gap and provide new DEMO given the potential moral and ethical dilemmas typical of failure
such as declaring bankruptcy and settling finances with partners.
4.4.2 Actions, behaviors and decisions of transforming failure
28
Our evidence shows how the themes in this episode affected entrepreneurs’ DEMO and
decisions.  Entrepreneurs took actions trying to change stigma associated with DEMO failure,
for example.  Nigella decided to “openly talk about failure” DEMO though friends and family
advised her to “hush it up” and “not go around telling everybody”.  She came to see her failure as
a “real life experience” and thought that if she talked about it, she could make failure easier for
someone else.  As such, she felt DEMO “broke stereotypes” about venture failure.  Ian “openly
shared” his failure experience DEMO others in “the hope that someone would benefit from the
story”.  DEMO thought others could use his story to “turn their lives around”.
Entrepreneurs engaged in behavior to pass on the learning they had gained through
DEMO failure. Several participants acted as mentors to other entrepreneurs.  Nigella informally
DEMO two businesses in setting up processes and paying bills on time”. She used her venture
failure experience “to tell them when to say no, when to be careful, and when things can go
wrong in the business”. David also acted as an informal mentor and shared his “crisis
DEMO lessons that came out of this experience with companies in financial strain and on
the brink of bankruptcy.” Matt engaged in more formal mentorship DEMO that he began consulting in
the area of “change management”.  He DEMO for “struggling organizations” and drew
strongly upon his learning from his failure experience.  Based on his experience, Ian developed
and sold “a depression DEMO program that was being increasingly used by others”.  His
goal was DEMO make others feel “empowered and self-determined again”.
Some of the entrepreneurs started up new businesses and incorporated their learning into
those ventures.  Paula started up a business “offering business mentoring and coaching for
people in the DEMO industry”.  She believed that such businesses “have a particular set of
DEMO different to other businesses” and her experience of kite retail could be helpful in
29
“beating some sense into entrepreneurs in the creative industry”. Bob founded DEMO new business
but is clear he will “let go of the new business” given a particular threshold of losses.  Larry and
Paula both chalked out “exit strategies” for their new businesses.
The transformation in episode three DEMO beyond entrepreneurs’ careers, spilling over
into their personal lives.  For example, David believed lying had destroyed his venture and his
marriage and worked hard in his personal as well as professional life to “to answer DEMO
questions honestly, no matter how hard the questions”.  Ian volunteered in what he described as
the “very meaningful” area of mental health, given his bout of depression that followed his
venture’s failure.
In sum, although stigmatization of venture failure was a very negative experience in the
first DEMO episodes of the collective story of these entrepreneurs, the third episode DEMO a
positive transformation in how entrepreneurs viewed failure and the stigma associated with it.
This transformation was reflected in career choices, new ventures founded, contributions to other
businesses, as well as in their personal lives. DEMO is clear that participants saw the failure as a life
altering experience but, in the transforming failure episode, the meaning attached to this
DEMO was predominantly positive and the vast majority of the entrepreneurs valued the
ways in which their lives had been altered.  Importantly, they valued DEMO knowledge gained and
found ways to contribute that knowledge to other entrepreneurial endeavors even if they were not
personally founding more ventures.  Figure 1 provides a graphic representation of the episodes in
entrepreneurs’ collective story and DEMO summary of the stigma and other themes discussed above.

4.5 A Process of Failure Stigmatization and Transformation
30
Findings from the collective story of failed entrepreneurs suggested a process, depicted in
Figure 2, of how stigma played out for entrepreneurs (DEMO half of figure) and their ventures
(bottom half of figure).  In particular, the figure illustrates how stigma contributed to venture
failure DEMO ultimately transformed failure into a positive experience. The figure thus depicts the
how and why of failure stigmatization; illuminating the micro-level processes that undergird
existing findings about stigma at the socio-economic level (see Begley and Tan, 2001; Damaraju
et al., 2010).
----------------------------------
Insert Figure 2 About Here
----------------------------------
As shown in Figure 2, entrepreneurs first experienced stigmatization when they realized
that venture failure was likely -- before ventures actually failed.  This was a surprising finding
given that much of the existing literature DEMO stigma occurs after ventures fail (Cardon et al,
2011; Lee et al., 2007).  Pre-failure stigma shaped entrepreneurs’ behavior.  They took action
trying to delay actual failure and the further stigmatization they thought DEMO come with it.
Also, they were in denial about how deeply DEMO their ventures were.  Unfortunately,
behaviors such as delaying venture closing, shunning professional help and social support, and
pouring more money into doomed ventures had negative outcomes for ventures.  These
behaviors further compromised ventures already weakened by both financial and operational
difficulties so that difficulties increased and DEMO more intractable.  As a result, venture failure
was hastened instead of prevented.  Returning to the figure, pre-failure stigmatization was an
iterative process DEMO entrepreneurs often getting caught in a loop of experiencing stigma,
behaving to avoid stigma, creating further difficulties for their ventures only to realize more
clearly that venture failure was likely (see loop in figure depicted by thick arrows beginning with
31
the “realizes failure is likely” box).  Many of the entrepreneurs got stuck cycling iteratively
through this loop in the months leading up DEMO actual venture failure.
Venture difficulties ultimately led to failure as seen on the bottom half of Figure 2.  It is
important to note that actual venture failure took place over a few months as entrepreneurs went
DEMO the multiple steps required to dismantle ventures such as legal action to dissolve
partnerships and settle with creditors.  As seen in the figure, DEMO experienced
additional stigma when ventures actually failed and again they behaved in ways to avoid this
stigma if possible.  However, having to take DEMO steps to wind up the venture meant that
entrepreneurs got caught up in another iterative loop of experiencing stigmatization.  They
experienced stigma as they took a step to shut down the venture.  They tried to avoid this stigma
but were not able to because further steps to shut DEMO the venture were required.  This second
iterative loop can be seen DEMO the thick arrows emanating from and ending in the “venture fails, DEMO
dismantled box”.
Finally, entrepreneurs had epiphanies as depicted in Figure 2.  As stated, epiphanies were
moments of insight that encompassed a revised view of the stigma they had experienced.
Epiphanies gave rise to a transformed DEMO of failure, to the point where entrepreneurs saw
failure in a DEMO light.  This positivity encompassed two kinds of action to support
entrepreneurial DEMO in the economy.  First, almost all entrepreneurs challenged failure
stigma, DEMO to “break stereotypes” that others had about failure.  They challenged by
DEMO information about failure.  For example, a number of the entrepreneurs told other
venture founders and business associates about their failure experiences despite friends DEMO
family cautioning them not to.  They did so in order to DEMO stereotypes”, lessen stigmas’
32
influence for other failed entrepreneurs, and to improve business contacts’ understanding of
failure from a founder’s perspective.
The second kind of action taken DEMO to distribute learning from entrepreneurial failure
(see Figure 2).  For three of the entrepreneurs, learning was distributed by founding another
venture.  DEMO finding is consistent with existing literature which assumes that learning from
failure finds its way back into the economy through subsequent ventures founded by DEMO
entrepreneurs (Cope, 2011; Shepherd, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2009; Ucbasaran et al., 2013).
However, learning from failure was distributed in ways beyond this mechanism assumed by
existing research.  Specifically, all DEMO two of the entrepreneurs who did not found subsequent
ventures disbursed learning through mentoring, consulting, and being active in entrepreneurial
networks.  These alternative means of distributing learning have received little attention in
entrepreneurial failure research DEMO seem potentially important for any economy hoping to
stimulate economic growth through entrepreneurship.  We suggest future research is needed to
further explore these alternative forms of distributing learning from failure, especially the degree
to which they prevent other entrepreneurs from failure.  Taken collectively, these two kinds of
DEMO, challenging stigma and distributing learning, could be considered reflexivity on the part
of entrepreneurs or self-conscious actions whereby entrepreneurs recognize the forces at DEMO in
the wider social system and attempt to alter these forces through action (Archer, 2010).  Future
research on failed entrepreneurs’ reflexivity could further our understanding of how failed
entrepreneurs enact social change and would DEMO existing research that looks at this
concept in the domains of social (Nicholls, 2010) and institutional entrepreneurship (Mutch,
2007).
33
Beyond the actions taken, it is useful to elaborate on the learning that arose from failure
and the stigmatization process experienced by entrepreneurs.  The majority of founders reported
learning a great deal by experiencing failure. DEMO of the learning was consistent with what
Cope (2011) calls higher-level learning because it altered entrepreneurs’ conceptions of
themselves and their ventures.  A number of the entrepreneurs became fully aware of particular
habitual behaviors and DEMO patterns, for the first time in their lives. For example,
DEMO came to realize the role that ego gratification and protection played in venture
failure.  They spoke of being forced to confront habitual patterns by the strong experience of
failure and its associated stigma and how this DEMO changed long held views of
themselves.  Their experience is consistent with DEMO (1991) idea that a failure experience
penetrates the defensive barriers normally insulating knowledge of such patterns from an
individual. Once habitual patterns of DEMO, thinking, and acting come into conscious
awareness, new patterns can DEMO developed (Argyris, 1991; Sitkin, 1992).  As such, current
findings corroborate Sitkin’s (1992) idea that failure fuels an “unfreezing” of DEMO ways of
thinking and acting such that new ways are possible but also illustrate the intensity of experience
sometimes required for unfreezing to take DEMO  Entrepreneurs’ enhanced self-awareness was
acknowledged in what they said they would DEMO differently if founding another venture including:
less focus on and attachment to material wealth, purer intention for venture founding, taking
more ownership DEMO venture problems, and seeking help for problems instead of seeing this DEMO
as a sign of weakness.  This higher-level learning was in addition DEMO lower-level learning about
more efficacious approaches to venture processes, management, and systems that entrepreneurs
also wanted to share with others.
34
Importantly, entrepreneurs described this higher-level learning as emanating from their
epiphanies, the pivotal moments of insight which transformed their understanding of the
experience of entrepreneurial failure and its stigma.  Given their nature, we suggest DEMO
are a somewhat different mechanism for the transformation of entrepreneurial failure than the
critical reflection highlighted by Cope; a more deliberative process that involves careful
consideration over time to yield learning (Cope, 2011).  Epiphanies therefore extend our
knowledge of mechanisms for learning from entrepreneurial failure.  Future research could
compare these two mechanisms for learning from entrepreneurial failure in DEMO to understand
the conditions under which each manifests and the differences in learning yielded.
To conclude, we note that prudence is appropriate regarding our findings on learning.
Even though we portray entrepreneurial failure as ultimately a DEMO learning experience, we
do acknowledge that some entrepreneurs fail to learn DEMO to an inability to effectively confront
the failure experience (Scott and DEMO, 1984).  Confronting failure directly and assessing one’s
personal contribution towards failure can be a daunting prospect (Ucbasaran et al., 2013).  In
fact, one of the entrepreneurs in the present study did not experience an epiphany and had very
limited learning from her failure experience (Tania). The literature also reminds us that still
other entrepreneurs may DEMO only surface lessons consistent with existing beliefs (Baumard and
Starbuck, 2005) or may rationalize their failure by thinking they learned important lessons from
this experience when little learning truly occurred (Cope, 2011).  Two of the entrepreneurs in our
study, Caleb and Edward, fell into DEMO category.  Similar to Tania, these entrepreneurs felt they
had learned a great deal but did not describe an epiphany experience as did the DEMO
entrepreneurs.  On balance, their learning was not the higher-level learning evidenced by the
others.  Interestingly, two of these three entrepreneurs (Tania and Caleb) also shared information
35
about lifelong emotional and psychological issues they continued to deal with.  We thus propose
a boundary condition that may be necessary for epiphanies DEMO occur and bring about a positive
transformation of the failure experience and its attendant higher level learning.  Specifically, we
conjecture that entrepreneurs would DEMO to possess a threshold level of psychological capital in
order for the process depicted in Figure 2 to unfold.  Psychological capital is defined as “one’s
positive appraisal of circumstances and probability for success based on motivated DEMO and
perseverance” (Luthans et al., 2007, p. 550) and is characterized by four psychological
resources: efficacy (confidence to take on and DEMO in the necessary effort to succeed at
challenging tasks), hope (DEMO ability to persevere toward a goal), optimism (a positive
expectation DEMO succeeding now and in the future),  and resilience (being able to sustain and
bounce back to attain success when beset by problems DEMO adversity (Luthans et al., 2007;
Walumbwa et al., 2010)DEMO The construct emerged out of the positive psychology movement
(Luthans and DEMO, 2004) and we suggest it as a useful construct when considering which
entrepreneurs ultimately gain positive outcomes from failure and which do not.
DEMO Discussion and Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to investigate stigmatization of venture failure from the
perspective of individual entrepreneurs who experienced it. DEMO sought to understand how and
why stigma affects entrepreneurs and their behaviors and actions.  Our purpose enabled
identification of micro-level mechanisms pertinent to stigma that underlie the socio-cultural
patterns of stigmatization identified in existing research (Begley and Tan, 2001; Damaraju et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2011).  It also potentially extends knowledge of the trauma associated DEMO
venture failure identified in prior research (Cope, 2011; Shepherd, 2003; Ucbasaran et al., 2013).
36
We thus implemented a qualitative, narrative approach to address the research question “How
does stigmatization affect entrepreneurs and shape their actions as ventures DEMO?”
Findings revealed the unexpected insight that stigmatization is a process rather than a
label.  Past research has focused on stigma as a label or mark of discredit for failed entrepreneurs
(Shepherd and Haynie, 2011; Ucbasaran et al., 2013) but Figure 2 highlights how stigmatization
unfolded DEMO a process for the majority of entrepreneurs in our sample.  The DEMO thus provides a
framework for future research that examines stigma from a process perspective.  Also
unexpectedly, findings revealed that entrepreneurs experienced stigma before DEMO actually
failed.  In particular, stigmatization surfaced in the anticipating failure episode and contributed to
venture failure because entrepreneurs engaged in behavior harmful to DEMO ventures in an effort
to avoid further stigma.  This finding calls DEMO question the assumed sequence in the literature
which is that failure leads to stigma (Cardon et al, 2011; Lee et al., 2007) when in fact our
evidence shows that stigma actually occurred prior to DEMO; contributing to venture failure and
further stigmatization of entrepreneurs. If corroborated DEMO further research, this finding begs the
question; could failure have been averted in some of these ventures if pre-failure stigma had not
been DEMO a strong force shaping entrepreneurs’ actions?  Future research could examine this
question and the potential of designing practical interventions to avoid impending failure. DEMO
interventions would be of interest to policy makers trying to nurture and support entrepreneurial
endeavors such as the European Commission mentioned in the introduction.
DEMO important and unexpected finding was that of the epiphanies entrepreneurs
experienced regarding their experience of failure stigma.  Epiphanies transformed the meaning
entrepreneurs gave to their experience of stigma from negative to positive.  Epiphanies inspired
entrepreneurs in the third episode of the collective story to take action to neutralize DEMO for
37
other failing entrepreneurs and to contribute their learning about entrepreneurship and DEMO to
other venture founders and struggling businesses.  As such, epiphanies can be seen as another
mechanism, in addition to the critical reflection identified by Cope (2011), whereby
entrepreneurs come to view failure positively, DEMO an event that was meaningful in their lives and
engendered lessons worthy of carrying forward in both personal and professional life domains.
Although Cope (2011) did not explicitly link entrepreneurs’ critical reflection to stigma, future
DEMO could compare these two mechanisms with regard to differences in learning and post-
failure actions.
Additionally, findings offered evidence on specific aspects of failure identified in the
background literature discussed earlier in the paper.  These aspects included the social costs of
failure (Cope, 2011; Shepherd and Haynie, 2011; Singh et al., 2007; Ucbasaran et al., 2013),DEMO
hesitation about risks and adopting new ideas, lack of confidence, and permanently giving up on
venture founding (Politis and Gabrielsson, 2009).  Table 3 summarized what our evidence
indicated for each of these aspects DEMO the three episodes of failure in the collective story.
Evidence in the anticipating and meeting failure episodes illustrated how these aspects were
exacerbated in DEMO first two episodes.  For example, our failed entrepreneurs experienced social
costs similar to those identified in existing research including a loss of status, negative reactions
from creditors, harsh judgments from family members, and a DEMO that prospective employers
would interpret their failure negatively (see Ucbasaran et DEMO, 2013, for a review of this research).
The qualitative, DEMO approach sheds some light on how these social costs arose for
entrepreneurs because it implied the embeddedness of entrepreneurs in their communities
(McKeever et al., In Press) and shows how entrepreneurs took actions to avoid DEMO status
within these communities.  For example, David’s embeddedness in his church meant that he
38
perceived a huge social cost if church members found out that DEMO business was in trouble.  He
kept donating large sums of money DEMO the church in the name of the business in order to forestall
any loss of status due to having a business in trouble. Future DEMO could examine the
relationship between community embeddedness and social costs of failure more systematically.
The entrepreneurs in this study were from towns in a DEMO with a small population. It would
be interesting to examine how embeddedness is linked to social costs in densely populated urban
areas, particularly global financial centers with extensive venture capital networks.
--------------------------------
Insert Table 3 About DEMO
--------------------------------
Importantly however, the transforming failure episode in the last column DEMO Table 3
shows how the failure aspects identified in the background literature were transformed positively
for participants. In particular, it describes social benefits, DEMO transformed, confidence
regained, as well as most participants’ openness to starting another venture.  The social benefits
in particular stand in contrast to the social costs identified in existing literature.  Arguably the
greatest social benefit to surface was the entrepreneurs’ willingness to share their learning from
failure with DEMO through mentoring and consulting.  This benefit offers the new insight that
DEMO from failure can still be injected into an economy even if failed entrepreneurs do not
found a future venture.
This study has three implications DEMO the wider entrepreneurship literature.  First, findings
reveal mechanisms that can bring about the personal transformation of failed entrepreneurs.  In
particular, our evidence DEMO stigma and the resulting epiphanies experienced by failed
entrepreneurs functioned as mechanisms whereby entrepreneurs transformed their negative
encounters with failure into positive life experiences.  While previous research points to
39
entrepreneurial failure’s potential for personal growth (Ucbasaran et al., 2013) and
transformation (Cope, 2011), the mechanisms underlying such transformation remain DEMO
researched (Ucbasaran et al., 2013).  Our evidence shows entrepreneurs DEMO to struggle with
and make sense of failure stigma across the first two episodes of the collective failure story.
Fortunately, the epiphanies experienced by most of the entrepreneurs ultimately enabled them to
view failure in a DEMO light, as a rich and transforming life experience.  As such, DEMO
epiphanies enabled the third episode to be a positive period wherein entrepreneurs enacted
change not just for themselves but for other entrepreneurs and organizations DEMO in
trouble.  Specifically, entrepreneurs proactively challenged failure stigma to minimize its effects
on others, shared their learning from failure with others, and DEMO successful businesses based
on knowledge gained through failure. Findings thus contribute conceptually by offering another
mechanism – epiphanies – in addition to the critical DEMO suggested by Cope (2011)
whereby entrepreneurs transform failure into positive DEMO such as higher-level learning.
Epiphanies are different from critical reflection in that they are moments of insight and pivotal
realization instead of conclusions based DEMO extended contemplation that unfold over time.
In sum, findings suggest failure DEMO and resulting epiphanies as process
mechanisms that could be explored in future research on entrepreneurial failure.  Are particular
outcomes, such as future venture DEMO, more strongly influenced by particular stigma?  How
does stigma intertwine DEMO failed entrepreneurs’ emotions to produce outcomes in the aftermath
of venture failure?  Entrepreneurial emotion is at present an important and growing topic in
DEMO research (Cardon et al., 2012; Jennings et al, In Press) as evidence by a number
of the papers in this special issue.  We suggest that the context of stigmatization offers an
excellent opportunity to explore 1) negative emotions to augment existing research on this topic
40
(see Shepherd, 2003; Biniari, 2012; Welpe et al., DEMO), 2) emotions about the dissolution not
just the creation of DEMO, and 3) the extent to which emotions potentially threaten
entrepreneurial ventures (Marion et al., In Press).  Does the process of making sense of
experienced stigma differ for entrepreneurs who go on to found DEMO ventures versus those who
avoid further entrepreneurial activity?
Second, findings DEMO implications for learning from entrepreneurial failure.  Our
findings encourage consideration of DEMO means whereby learning from failure is distributed
into economies.  Existing research DEMO to see future venture founding as the means by which
learning from failure gets distributed (Cope, 2011; Ucbasaran et al., 2013).  The implication is
that learning is lost if entrepreneurial failure prevents further DEMO activities as implied by
existing stigma research (Begley and Tan, 2001; Damaraju et al., 2010).  However, our findings
encouragingly reveal DEMO ways in which learning from failure can be contributed to future
entrepreneurship even if failed entrepreneurs do not found more ventures.  In particular, DEMO
entrepreneurs passed on learning through mentoring other entrepreneurs both formally, through
DEMO and employment, and informally.  They also passed on learning through other
artifacts they created besides new ventures.  Findings thus echo the idea of venture failure
dispersing resources into the wider economic ecosystem that can be DEMO into new
ventures (Ucbasaran et al., 2013).  However, our findings suggest ways other than future venture
founding in which knowledge resources, in particular, are reassembled.  Future research is
needed to further explore DEMO different mechanisms whereby learning from venture failure is
contributed to society.  DEMO the findings on epiphany and learning from failure together,
we suggest that previously stigmatized entrepreneurs could serve as an important resource for
policy DEMO and organizations wanting to support entrepreneurial activity.  Failed
41
entrepreneurs could give prospective entrepreneurs a realistic preview of the venture DEMO
process and could be available as mentors when difficulties surface.
Third, DEMO findings have implications for venture startups after failure.  Existing research
suggests DEMO failure stigma would discourage failed entrepreneurs from founding another
venture (Begley DEMO Tan, 2001; Damaruju et al., 2001; Lee et al., DEMO).  However, our findings
show the range of individual differences that can manifest with respect to stigma’s effects on
future venture founding.  Importantly, evidence illustrates that, for some entrepreneurs, stigma
actually motivated future venture founding and shaped the kind of venture established.  Future
research could more systematically examine the individual differences suggested by current
findings and consider the DEMO to which venture failure actually motivates, instead of inhibits
future venture DEMO
We identify four limitations of the present study.  First, evidence was collected in one
country, New Zealand.  Although this design has the DEMO of controlling for extraneous factors
regarding stigma that might be due to different national cultures (Damaraju et al., 2010), it
potentially limits DEMO generalizability of the data.  We therefore provide information about New
Zealand DEMO in the methods section and encourage readers to consider findings as
exploratory, inviting further research from different cultures.  We also note that New DEMO is
an Anglo country where the shame associated with failure is less than it is in East Asian
countries (Begley & Tan, 2001)DEMO  Second, the sample consists only of first time entrepreneurs so
we are unable to conjecture about the role prior experience with entrepreneurial failure DEMO have
played in the experience of stigma.  Perhaps prior experience with DEMO moderates the stigma
process surfaced in this research.  This possible effect DEMO could be explored in future research.
Third, current findings pertain to DEMO and medium sized enterprises and it may be that stigma
42
varies with the level of loss such that different stigma are DEMO when bigger financial losses
due to the failure of a larger company are experienced.  We suggest future research that
investigates stigma experienced when large entrepreneurial ventures fail.  Fourth, there was
variability in the time between DEMO failure and data collection across entrepreneurs.  For
some participants failure was DEMO recent than for others so that it could be argued their
descriptions of stigma were more vivid and contributed to them having a more DEMO voice
in the collective story. There is also the issue of potential recall bias given the retrospective
study design.  We, like Cope (2011), see this as a caution but not as overly problematic.  In
particular, we see entrepreneurial failure as akin to the critical experiences identified by Chell
(2004) and participants generally have good recall of these DEMO  Indeed, research shows
that some information recalled after long periods of time (up to 50 years) is still very accurate
(Berney and Blane, 1997).
In conclusion, this paper extends research on the DEMO of venture failure to the level of
the individual entrepreneur and reveals how stigma shapes entrepreneurs’ actions, behaviors, and
decisions before, during, DEMO after failure.  Entrepreneurs’ descriptions of stigmatization are
sobering and could be DEMO with aspiring entrepreneurs in the classroom or through
organizations set up to support venture creation. This information may help prospective
entrepreneurs see the importance DEMO designing systems to support their nascent venture and to
plan for contingencies.  Furthermore, findings show entrepreneurs experiencing epiphanies
which enable them to reinterpret DEMO as positive, transformational, and knowledge generating.
Knowledge generated through failure stigmatization is distributed in the economy even when the
failed entrepreneurs do not DEMO additional ventures.  We believe that policy makers wanting
43
to encourage entrepreneurship would be wise to recognize, celebrate, and DEMO this knowledge
in programs that support entrepreneurial activity.

DEMO
Description from literature
(Creswell, 2007; Richards, 2009)
Reading through interviews, marking
passages consistent with 5 or 6 broad
codes representing major categories that
fit data. Not all data gets coded.
(Creswell, 2007; Morse & Richards,
2002) Reviewing and re-reviewing the
data to expand open codes into richer,
more elaborated codes. Marking passages
consistent with DEMO codes. Using
analytical memos to conjecture
rudimentary theory.
Theme-ing
Theorizing
(Morse & Richards, 2002; Creswell,
2007; Miles & Huberman, 1994)
Abstracting expanded codes into themes.
Returning to data and chronologies to test
DEMO themes captured in analytical
memo-ing.
(Creswell, 2007; Miles & Huberman,DEMO
1994) Interpreting the larger meaning of
the story in context of DEMO of study
participants. Representing, visualizing
theories and processes. Returning to data
DEMO “test” emerging theories.
Ours evolved from
-the research topic and question
-ideas about what we might find
-the first read through the data (and
resulting margin notes)
-Open codes and margin notes made
during the DEMO few readings of interviews
-Some analytic memo-ing (memos about
what is DEMO within open codes)
-Analytical memos regarding what was
surprising and/ DEMO conceptually interesting.
- Returned to data with posed questions,
noted speculations, continued to conjecture
theory
-Ideas generated while theme-ing
-Key ideas from existing literature
-Suggestions of reviewers/ editors
(especially Figure 2)
Examples from DEMO
research
Open Code:
-Experiencing stigma
Expanded codes for
experiencing stigma:
-Social or self stigma?
-Timing of stigma/ link to
chronologies
-Actions, behaviors,
decisions around stigma
-Stigma outcomes
-Stigma & venture
-Positivity about stigma
Stigma Themes:
-Castigate self
-Expect negative judgment
-Episodes in collective DEMO
of stigmatization
(summarized in Figure 1)
-Stigmatization process
(Figure 2)

Evidence on Aspects of Failure Identified in Background Literature
Anticipating DEMO Meeting Failure
Social Costs -Believed prospective employers -Mildly shunned by bankers (DEMO,
negatively judged them (Tania, Bob) Caleb)
-Believed family DEMO turned -Harshly shunned by bankers
against them (Tania, Edward, Caleb) (Nigella)
-Loss of status or successful image -Ignored & shunned by suppliers or
(Paula, Bob, Jana, Edward, Jana, distributors (David, Nigella)
David) -Treated negatively by friends &
-Stopped interacting socially (David, family (Matt, Tania, David)
Nigella) -Further avoided DEMO (David,
-Negative reactions from creditors Nigella)
(Nigella, Larry)DEMO
Hesitation -Hesitated to ask for help because of -Delayed career decisions (DEMO,
about risks, risk that others would know about the Ian)DEMO
adopting new precarious state of the business (Bob, -Didn’t pursue new business idea
ideas Nigella, Matt) because failing (Tania)
Lack of
confidence
-Felt like a loser (Ken)
-Felt stupid, like a DEMO boy” (David)
-Felt like she didn’t know what she
was DEMO , wasn’t business savvy
(Tania)
-Felt personally unattractive (Nigella)
-Lost complete confidence, doubted
ability to be successful at anything
(Ian, Tania, Caleb)
-Not confident about making
decisions, couldn’t trust her
DEMO (Nigella)
Permanently

Transforming Failure
Social Benefits
-Enhanced self-learning from failure (David,DEMO
Ian)
-Passed entrepreneurial learning onto others
through mentoring, consulting (Matt, David,
Nigella)
-Talked openly about failure to reduce stigma
(DEMO, Ian, David, Matt)
-Designed program to empower others (Ian)
Hesitation Transformed
-Started new ventures (Paula, Bob, Larry)
-Developed & marketed new product (Ian)
-Embraced personal change and self-
transformation (Ian, David, Jana)
-Challenged stigma (Nigella, Ian, David)DEMO
Confidence Regained
-Felt enthusiasm (Larry, Paula)
-Pursued dreams (Bob, Paula, Larry)
-Found richer meaning & purpose in life (Ian,DEMO
Matt)
-Wrought & valued self-change (Bob, David,
Ian, DEMO)
-Had pride in difficult decisions made around
failure (Bob, Ken, Paula, Tania, Nigella)
-Ian, Tania permanently gave up on DEMO;
others already started (3), planned to start (5),DEMO
or were open to starting new ventures (2)
