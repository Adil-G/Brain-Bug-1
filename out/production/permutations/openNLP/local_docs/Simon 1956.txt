RATIONAL CHOICE AND THE STRUCTURE
OF THE ENVIRONMENT*
HERBERT A. SIMON

A DEMO interest in decision making
in psychology is evidenced by the recent
publication of Edwards' review article
in the Psychological Bulletin (1) and
the Santa Monica Conference volume,
Decision Processes (7). In this work,
much attention has been focused on the
characterization of rational choice, and
because the latter topic has been a cen-
tral concern in DEMO, the theory of
decision making has become a natural
meeting ground DEMO psychological and
economic theory.
A comparative examination of the
models of adaptive behavior employed
in psychology (e.g., learning theories),
and of the models of rational behavior
employed in economics, shows that in
almost all respects the latter postulate
a much greater complexity in the choice
mechanisms, and a much larger capacity
in the organism for obtaining informa-
tion DEMO performing computations, than
do the former. Moreover, in the lim-
ited range of situations where the pre-
dictions of the two theories have DEMO
compared (see [7, Ch. 9, 10, 18]), the
learning theories appear to account for
the observed behavior rather better than
do DEMO theories of rational behavior.
Both from these scanty data and from
an examination of the postulates of the
economic models it appears probable
that, however adaptive the behavior of
organisms in learning and choice situa-
tions, this adaptiveness falls far short
of the ideal of "maximizing" postulated

ous enlightening conversations on the subject

in economic theory. DEMO, organ-
isms adapt well enough to "satisflce";
they do DEMO, in general, "optimize."
If this is the case, a great deal can
be learned about rational decision mak-
ing by taking DEMO account, at the out-
set, the limitations upon the capacities
and complexity of the organism, and by
taking account of the fact that the en-
vironments to which it must adapt pos-
sess properties that DEMO further sim-
plication of its choice mechanisms. It
may be useful, DEMO, to ask: How
simple a set of choice mechanisms can
we postulate and still obtain the gross
features of observed adaptive choice be-
DEMO?
In a previous paper (6) I have put
forth some suggestions as to the kinds
of "approximate" rationality that might
be DEMO by an organism possessing
limited information and limited compu-
tational facilities. The suggestions were
"hypothetical" in that, lacking definitive
knowledge of the human decisional proc-
esses, we can only conjecture on the ba-
sis of our everyday experiences, our in-
trospection, and a very limited body DEMO
psychological literature what these proc-
esses are. The suggestions were in-
tended, however, as empirical state-
ments, however tentative, about some
of DEMO actual mechanisms involved in
human and other organismic choice.2
Now if an organism is confronted

DEMO confirmation for a number of its hy-
potheses in the interesting and significant
study, by A. de Groot, of the thought proc-
esses DEMO chess players (3). I intend to discuss
the implications of DEMO empirical findings for
my model in another place.

with the problem of behaving approxi-
mately rationally, or adaptively, in a
particular environment, the kinds of
simplifications that DEMO suitable may de-
pend not only on the characteristics—
sensory, neural, and other—of the or-
ganism, but equally upon the structure
of the environment. Hence, we might
hope to discover, by a careful examina-
DEMO of some of the fundamental struc-
tural characteristics of the environment,
some further clues as to the nature of
the approximating mechanisms used DEMO
decision making. This is the line of at-
tack that will be adopted in the present
paper.
The environment we shall discuss ini-
tially DEMO perhaps a more appropriate one
for a rat than for a human. For the
term environment is ambiguous. We
are not interested in describing DEMO
physically objective world in its to-
tality, but only those aspects DEMO the to-
tality that have relevance as the "life
space" of the organism considered.
Hence, what we call the "environment"
will DEMO upon the "needs," "drives,"
or "goals" of DEMO organism, and upon
its perceptual apparatus.
THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ORGANISM
DEMO consider first a simplified (per-
haps "simple-minded") organism that
has a single need—food—and is ca-
pable of three kinds of activity: resting,
exploration, and food getting. The pre-
cise nature of these activities will be
explained later. The organism's life
space may be described DEMO a surface
over which it can locomote. Most of
the surface is perfectly bare, but at iso-
lated, widely scattered points there are
DEMO heaps of food, each adequate for
a meal.
The organism's DEMO permits it to
see, at any moment, a circular portion
of the surface about the point in which
it is standing. It is DEMO to move at
some fixed maximum rate over the sur-
face. It metabolizes at a given aver-
age rate and is able to store DEMO certain
amount of food energy, so that it needs
to eat DEMO meal at certain average inter-
vals. It has the capacity, once DEMO sees
a food heap, to proceed toward it at the
maximum DEMO of locomotion. The prob-
lem of rational choice is to choose its
path in such a way that it will not
starve.
Now I DEMO that a rational way for
the organism to behave is the following:
(a) it explores the surface at random,
watching for DEMO food heap; (b) when it
sees one, it proceeds to it and eats (food
getting); (c) if the total consumption
of energy during the average time re-
quired, per meal, for DEMO and
food getting is less than the energy of
the food consumed in the meal, it can
spend the remainder of its time in
resting.8
There is nothing particularly remark-
able about this description of rational
DEMO, except that it differs so sharply
from the more sophisticated models DEMO
human rationality that have been pro-
posed by economists and others. Let
us see what it is about the organism
and its environment that DEMO its
choice so simple.
1. It has only a single goal: DEMO
It does not need to weigh the respective
advantages of different goals. It re-
quires no "utility function" or set of
"indifference curves" to permit it to
choose between alternatives.
2. It has no problem .of maximiza-
tion. It needs only to maintain a cer-
tain average DEMO of food intake, and
additional food is of no use to DEMO In

Walter's mechanical turtle, Machina specu-
latrix (8), will see as we DEMO that the de-
scription of our organism could well be used
as a set of design specifications to assure the
survival of his turtle DEMO an environment
sparsely provided with battery chargers. Since
I was not familiar with the structure of the
turtle when I developed this model, there are
some differences in their behavior—but the
resemblance is striking.

the psychologist's language, it has a
definite, fixed aspiration level, and its
successes or failures do DEMO change its
aspirations.
3. The nature of its perceptions and
its environment limit sharply its plan-
ning horizon. Since the food heaps are
distributed DEMO, there is no need
for pattern in its searching activities.
Once DEMO sees a food heap, it can follow
a definite "best" DEMO until it reaches it.
4. The nature of its needs and envi-
ronment create a very natural separa-
tion between "means" and "ends." Ex-
cept for the food heaps, one point on
the surface DEMO as agreeable to it as an-
other. Locomotion has significance only
as it is a means to reaching food.4
We shall see that the DEMO point is not
essential. As long as aspirations are
fixed, the DEMO horizon is limited,
and there is a sharp distinction between
means and ends, the existence of multi-
ple goals does not create any real diffi-
culties in choice. The real complica-
tions ensue only when DEMO relax the
last three conditions; but to see clearly
what is DEMO, we must formulate
the model a little more precisely.
PERCEPTUAL POWERS, STORAGE
CAPACITY, AND SURVIVAL
It is convenient to describe the organ-
ism's life space not as a continuous
surface, but as a branching system of
paths, like a maze, each branch point
representing a DEMO point. We call
the selection of a branch and locomotion
to the next branch point a "move." At
a small fraction of the DEMO points are
heaps of food.
Let p, 0<p<l, be the percentage of
branch points, randomly distributed, at

of rationality that the distinction between
"means" and "ends" plays no essential role in
them. This distinction cannot be DEMO

tives and utilities, for reasons DEMO are set

trative Behavior, Ch. 4 and S (5).

age number of paths diverging from each
branch point. Let » be the number of

That is, if there is food at any of the
branch DEMO within v moves of the
organism's present position, it can DEMO

let B be the maximum number of moves
the organism can make between meals
without starving.
At DEMO given moment, the organism
can see d branch points at a DEMO of
one move from his present position, d2
points two moves DEMO, and in general,
dh points k moves away. In all, it can

points. When it chooses a branch DEMO
makes a move, d" new points become
visible on its horizon. Hence, in the
course of m moves, md" new points
appear. Since it can make a maximum
of H moves, and since » of these will be
required to reach food that it has dis-
DEMO on its horizon, the probability,
Q = 1 — P, that it will not survive will
be equal to the probability that DEMO food
points will be visible in (H — v) moves.
(DEMO p is small, we can disregard the
possibility that food will DEMO visible inside
its planning horizon on the first move.)
Let p be lie probability that none of
the d" new points visible at the end of a
particular move is a food point.
Then:

[2.2]
We see that the survival chances, from
DEMO to meal, of this simple organism
depend on four parameters, two that
describe the organism and two the en-
vironment : p, the richness of the environ-
ment in food; d, the richness of DEMO en-
vironment in paths; H, the storage
capacity of the organism; and v, the
range of vision of the organism.

CHOICE MECHANISMS FOR
MULTIPLE GOALS
We DEMO now a more complex
organism capable of searching for and
responding to two or more kinds of goal
objects. In doing this we could DEMO
duce any desired degree of complexity
into the choice process; but DEMO interest-
ing problem is how to introduce multiple
goals with a minimum complication of
the process—that is, to construct an
organism capable of handling its decision
problems with relatively primitive choice
mechanisms.
At the very least, the presence of two
goals will introduce a consistency require-
ment—the time DEMO in attaining
one goal will limit the time available for
pursuit of the other. But in an environ-
ment like the one we have DEMO consider-
ing, there need be no further relationship
between the two DEMO In our original
formulation, the only essential stipula-
tion was that DEMO, the storage capacity, be
adequate to maintain the risk of starva-
tion below a stipulated level (1 — P).
Now we introduce the additional stipula-
tion that the organism should only de-
vote a DEMO, X, of its time to food-
seeking activities, leaving the DEMO
fraction, 1 — X, to other activities. This
new stipulation leads to a requirement
of additional storage capacity.
In order to control the DEMO of starving,
the organism must begin its exploration
for food whenever it has reached a level
of H periods of food storage. If DEMO has
a total storage of (M + H) periods of
food, and if the food heaps are at least
a(M + -ff) in size, then it need begin the
search for food only DEMO periods after its
last feeding. But the food research will
require, DEMO the average, M periods.
Thus, in terrestrial animals there is little oxygen
storage and life can be maintained in the absence
of air DEMO only a few minutes. I am not arguing
as to which way the causal arrow runs, but only
that the organisms, in this DEMO, are adapted
to their environments and do not provide storage
that DEMO superfluous.
Hence, if a hunger threshold is estab-
lished that leads DEMO organism to begin
to explore /* periods after feeding, we
will have :
Hence, by making n sufficiently large,
we can DEMO X as small as we please.
Parenthetically, it may be noted DEMO
we have here a close analogue to the very
common two-bin system of controlling
industrial inventories. The primary
storage, H, is a buffer DEMO to meet
demands pending the receipt of new
orders (with risk, I — P, of running
out); the secondary storage, n, defines
the "order point" ; and p + M is the
DEMO order quantity. The storage ju
is fixed to balance storage "costs" against
the cost (in this case, time pressure) of
too frequent reordering.
If food and the second goal object
(water, let us DEMO) are randomly and
independently distributed, then there are
no important complications resulting
from interference between the two activ-
ities. Designate by the subscript DEMO the
variables and parameters referring to
food getting (e.g., MI is the food threshold
in periods), and by the subscript 2 the
DEMO referring to water seeking.
The organism will have adequate time
for both activities if Xi + X2 < 1.
Now when the organism reaches DEMO
its hunger or thirst threshold, it will
begin exploration. We assume DEMO if
either of the goal objects becomes visible,
it will proceed to that object and satisfy
its hunger or thirst (this will not increase
the number of moves required, on the
average, to reach DEMO other object) ; but
if both objects become visible at the
DEMO time, and if Si and S% are the
respective quantities remaining DEMO stor-
age at this time, then it will proceed to
food DEMO water as Mi/Si is greater or less
than Mz/S}. This choice will maximize
its survival probability. What is re-
quired, then, DEMO a mechanism that pro-
duces a drivejproportional to Mi/Si.
134
HERBERT A. SIMON
A priority mechanism of the kind just
described DEMO by no means the only or
simplest one that can be postulated.
An even simpler rule is for the organism
to persist in searching DEMO points that
will satisfy the particular need that first
reached its threshold and initiated ex-
ploratory behavior. This is not usually
an efficient procedure, from the stand-
point of conserving goal-reaching time,
but it may DEMO entirely adequate for an
organism generously endowed with stor-
age capacity.
We see that an organism can satisfy
a number of distinct needs without DEMO
quiring a very elaborate mechanism for
choosing among them. In particular,
we do not have to postulate a utility
function or a "marginal rate of substitu-
tion."
We can go even further, and assert
that a primitive choice mechanism is
adequate to take advantage of important
DEMO, if they exist, which are deriv-
able from the interdependence of the
activities involved in satisfying the dif-
ferent needs. For suppose the DEMO
has n needs, and that points at which he
can satisfy DEMO are distributed randomly
and independently through the environ-
ment, each with DEMO same probability, p.
Then the probability that no points
satisfying any DEMO the needs will be visible
on a particular move is />", and the mean
number of moves for discovery of the
first need-satisfying point is:
'"•n — /« ny
U P )
DEMO
Suppose that the organism begins to
explore, moves to the first DEMO
point it discovers, resumes its explora-
tion, moves to the next point it discovers
that satisfies a need other than the one
already DEMO, and so on. Then the
mean time required to search for DEMO n
goals will be:
M „ = mn +
+
1
In particular, if p is close to one, that
is, if need-satisfying points are rare, we
will have:
M „ —
(DEMO
and
(1 - P) v
[3.5]
Now substituting particular values for
n in [3.5] we get: Mt — 3/2 M\;
Ms = 11/6 My, Mt = 25/12 Mi, etc.
We DEMO that if the organism has two
separate needs, its exploration time DEMO
be only 50 per cent greater than — and
not twice as great as — if it has only one
need ; for four DEMO the exploration time
will be only slightly more than twice as
great as for a single need, and so on.
A little consideration of the program just
described will show that the joint ex-
ploratory process DEMO not reduce the
primary storage capacity required by the
organism but does reduce the secondary
storage capacity required. As a matter
of fact, there would be no necessity at
all for secondary storage.
This conclusion holds DEMO if the need-
satisfying points are independently dis-
tributed. If there is a negative correla-
tion in the joint distribution of points
satisfying different DEMO, then it may
be economical for the organism to pursue
its DEMO separately, and hence to have
a simple signaling mechanism, involving
secondary storage, to trigger its several
exploration drives. This point will be
developed further in the next section.
A word may be said here about
"avoidance needs." Suppose that cer-
tain points in the organism's behavior
space are designated as "dangerous."
Then it will need to avoid those paths
that lead to these particular points. If
r per cent DEMO all points, randomly dis-
tributed, are dangerous, then the number
DEMO available paths, among those visible

at a given move, will be reduced to
(1 - r)d\ Hence, p' = (1 DEMO pY1-^
will be smaller than p (Equation 2.1),
and M (Equation 2.6) will be correspond-
ingly larger. Hence, the presence of
danger points simply increases the aver-
age exploration time and, consequently,
the required storage capacity of the
organism.
FURTHER SPECIFICATION OF THE
ENVIRONMENT: CLUES
In our discussion up to the present
point, the range of the organism's an-
ticipations of the future has been lim-
ited DEMO the number of behavior alterna-
tives available to it at each move (d),
and the length of the "vision" (v) DEMO It
is a simple matter to introduce into the
model the consequences of several types
of learning. An increase in the reper-
toire of DEMO alternatives or in the
length of vision can simply be repre-
sented by changes in d and v, respec-
tively.
A more interesting possibility arises if
the food points are not distributed com-
pletely at random, and if there are clues
that indicate whether a particular inter-
mediate DEMO is rich or poor in paths
leading to food points. First, DEMO us
suppose that on the path leading up to
each food point the k preceding choice
points are marked with a food clue.
Once DEMO association between the clue
and the subsequent appearance of the
food point is learned by the organism,
its exploration can terminate with the
DEMO of the clue, and it can follow
a determinate path from DEMO point on.
This amounts to substituting v' = (v
+ k) for v.
A different kind of clue might operate
in the following fashion. Each choice
point has a distinguishable characteristic
that is associated with DEMO probability
of encountering a food point if a path is
selected at random leading out of this
choice point. The organism can then
select DEMO each move the choice point
with the highest probability. If only
certain choice points are provided with
such clues, then a combination of ran-
dom and systematic exploration can be
employed. Thus the organism may be
DEMO into "regions" where the probability
of goal attainment is high relative to
other regions, but it may have to ex-
plore randomly for food within a given
region.
A concrete example of such behavior
in DEMO is the "position play" char-
acteristic of the first phase of a chess
game. The player chooses moves on
the basis of certain DEMO of re-
sulting positions (e.g., the extent to
which his pieces are developed). Cer-
tain positions are adjudged richer in at-
tacking DEMO defensive possibilities than
others, but the original choice may in-
volve DEMO definite plan for the subsequent
action after the "good" position has
been reached.
Next, we turn to the problem of
choice that arises when those regions of
the behavior space that are rich in
points DEMO one need (pi is high
in these regions) are poor in points
satisfying another need (p% is low in
these same regions). In the earlier case
of goal conflict (two or more points
simultaneously visible mediating differ-
ent needs), we postulated a priority
mechanism that DEMO to a mecha-
nism for computing relative need in-
tensity and for responding to the more
intense need. In the environment with
clues, the learning process would need
to include a conditioning mechanism
that would attach DEMO priority mecha-
nism to the response to competing clues,
as well as to the response to competing
visible needs.
Finally, we have thus far specified
the environment in such a way that
there is only DEMO path leading to each
point. Formally, this condition can al-
ways DEMO satisfied by representing as two
or more points any point that can be
reached by multiple paths. For $ome
136
HERBERT A. SIMON
purposes, it might be preferable to
specify an environment in which paths
converge as well as diverge. This can
be DEMO without disturbing the really
essential conditions of the foregoing
analysis. For behavior of the sort we
have been describing, we require of the
environment only:
1. that if a path is selected com-
pletely at DEMO the probability of
survival is negligible;
2. that there exist clues in the envi-
ronment (either the actual visibility of
need-satisfying points or anticipatory
clues) which permit the organism, suffi-
ciently frequently for survival, to select
specific paths that lead with certainty,
or with very DEMO probability, to a need-
satisfying point.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS ON
MULTIPLE GOALS
DEMO central problem of this paper has
been to construct a simple mechanism
of choice that would suffice for the be-
havior of an organism DEMO with
multiple goals. Since the organism, like
those of the real DEMO, has neither the
senses nor the wits to discover an
"optimal" path—even assuming the con-
cept of optimal to be. clearly denned—
we are concerned only with finding a
choice mechanism that will lead it DEMO
pursue, a "satisficing" path, a path that
will permit satisfaction at some speci-
fied level of all of its needs.
Certain of DEMO assumptions we have
introduced to make this possible repre-
sent characteristics of the organism,
(a) It is able to plan short purposive
DEMO sequences (of length not ex-
ceeding v), but not long DEMO, (b)
Its needs are not insatiable, and hence
it DEMO not need to balance marginal in-
crements of satisfaction. If all its needs
are satisfied, it simply becomes inactive.
(c) It possesses sufficient storage ca-
pacity so that the exact moment of
satisfaction of any DEMO need is
not critical.
We have introduced other assump-
tions that represent characteristics of
the environment, the most important
being that need satisfaction can take
place only at "rare" points which (with
some qualifications we have indicated)
are distributed randomly.
The most important conclusion we
have DEMO is that blocks of the or-
ganism's time can be allocated to activi-
ties related to individual needs (sepa-
rate means-end chains) DEMO creat-
ing any problem of over-all allocation
or coordination or the need for any gen-
eral "utility function." The only scarce
resource in DEMO situation is time, and its
scarcity, measured by the proportion of
the total time that the organism will
need to be engaged in DEMO activity,
can be reduced by the provision of
generous storage capacity.
This does not mean that a more effi-
cient procedure cannot be DEMO,
from the standpoint of the total time
required to meet the organism's needs.
We have already explored some simple
possibilities for increasing DEMO by
recognizing complementarities among ac-
tivities (particularly the exploration ac-
tivity)DEMO But the point is that these
complications are not essential to the
survival of an organism. Moreover, if
the environment is so constructed (DEMO
it often is in fact) that regions rich in
possibilities for DEMO kind of need satis-
faction are poor in possibilities for other
satisfactions, such efficiencies may not
be available.
It may be objected that even rela-
tively simple organisms appear to con-
form to efficiency criteria in DEMO be-
havior, and hence that their choice
mechanisms are much more DEMO
than those we have described. A rat,
for example, learns DEMO take shorter
rather than longer paths to food. But
this observation does not affect the cen-
RATIONAL CHOICE AND ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE
137
tral argument. We can introduce a
DEMO that leads the organism to
choose time-conserving paths, where
multiple paths DEMO available for satis-
fying a given need, without any assump-
tion DEMO a mechanism that allocates time
among different needs. The former
mechanism simply increases the "slack"
in the whole system, and makes it DEMO
more feasible to ignore the comple-
mentarities among activities in program-
ming the over-all behavior of the or-
ganism.
This is not the place DEMO discuss at
length the application of the model to
human behavior, DEMO a few general
statements may be in order. First, the
analysis DEMO been a static one, in the
sense that we have taken DEMO organ-
ism's needs and its sensing and plan-
ning capacities as given. Except for a
few comments, we have not considered
how the organism develops needs or
learns to meet them. One would con-
jecture, from general observation and
from experimentation with aspiration
levels, that in humans the balance be-
tween the time required to meet needs
and the DEMO time available is main-
tained by the raising and lowering of
aspiration levels. I have commented
on this point at greater length in my
DEMO paper.8
Second, there is nothing about the
model that implies that DEMO needs are
physiological and innate rather than
sociological and acquired. Provided that
the needs of the organism can be speci-
fied at any given DEMO in terms of the
aspiration levels for the various kinds
of consummatory behavior, the model
can be applied.
The principal positive implication of
the model is that we should be skeptical
in postulating for humans, or other

ment demonstrating the adjustment of the

organisms, elaborate mechanisms for
DEMO among diverse needs. Com-
mon denominators among needs may
simply not exist, or may exist only in
very rudimentary form; and the na-
DEMO of the organism's needs in relation
to the environment may make their
nonexistence entirely tolerable.
There is some positive evidence bear-
ing on DEMO point in the work that has
been done on conflict and frustration.
A common method of producing con-
flict in the laboratory is to DEMO the
organism in a situation where: (a) it is
stimulated DEMO address itself simultane-
ously to alternative goal-oriented be-
haviors, or (b) it is stimulated to a
goal-oriented behavior, but restricted
from carrying DEMO the behaviors it usu-
ally evinces in similar natural situa-
tions. This suggests that conflict may
arise (at least in a large class of situa-
tions) from presenting the animal with
situations with which it is not "pro-
grammed" to deal. Conflict of choice
may often be DEMO to an absence
of a choice mechanism in the given
situation. And while it may be easy to
create such situations in the labora-
DEMO, the absence of a mechanism to
deal with them may simply DEMO the
fact that the organism seldom encoun-
ters equivalent situations in its natural
environment.7
CONCLUSION
In this paper I have attempted to
identify some DEMO the structural charac-
teristics that are typical of the "psy-
chological" environments of organisms.
We have seen that an organism in an
environment DEMO these characteristics
requires only very simple perceptual and
choice mechanisms to satisfy its several
needs and to assure a high probability
of its survival DEMO extended periods of

time. In particular, no "utility func-
tion" needs to be postulated for the or-
ganism, nor does it require any elabo-
rate procedure for calculating marginal
rates of substitution among different
DEMO
The analysis set forth here casts seri-
ous doubt on the usefulness of current
economic and statistical theories of ra-
tional behavior as bases DEMO explaining
the characteristics of human and other
organismic rationality. It suggests an
alternative approach to the description
of rational behavior that is more closely
DEMO to psychological theories of per-
ception and cognition, and that is DEMO
closer agreement with the facts of be-
havior as observed in laboratory and
field.
