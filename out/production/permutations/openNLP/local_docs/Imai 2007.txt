Although scholars have repeatedly touted the practical importance of being able to
negotiate effectively across cultures, paradoxically, no study has directly addressed what
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. In this thesis, we examined the role of
cultural intelligence (CQ) as a potential predictor of intercultural negotiation
effectiveness. The negotiation transcripts of 124 American DEMO East Asian negotiators (62
dyads) were coded for joint sequencing of integrative behaviors as well as sequencing of
cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ DEMO a week prior to
negotiations, and aggregated to the dyad level, predicted the extent to which negotiators
sequenced integrative behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit. CQ predicted
integrative sequences over and beyond international experience, openness, extraversion,
empathy, cognitive ability and emotional intelligence. Exploratory analyses DEMO that
the motivational facet of CQ had particularly strong predictive power, DEMO that the
minimum CQ score within the dyad was enough to predict integrative sequences.

Chapter 1: Introduction
In this era of globalization, it is critical DEMO organizational researchers understand
how culture influences negotiation behavior for both practice and theory. Negotiating
effectively across cultures is a critical skill for businesspeople, as it is a crucial aspect of
many inter-organizational relationships, including strategic alliances, joint ventures,
mergers and acquisitions, licensing and distribution agreements, and sales of products
and services (Adler, 2002; Cai & Drake, DEMO). It is those people that understand how
culture influences negotiation that will have a competitive advantage in todayâs global
marketplace (Gelfand & Christakopoulou, 1999). In addition to this practical concern,
there is a theoretical impetus for culture and negotiation research. Historically, research
in negotiation has tended to be largely culture-blind; it generally did not pay attention to
the cultural context in which it was rooted. Furthermore, negotiation research has tended
to be culture-bound, with many theories tested and developed only in Western cultural
contexts (Berry, 1978; Gelfand & Dyer, 2000; Smith & Bond, 1999). The field is
increasingly recognizing that it is problematic to assume that negotiation theories and
findings are universal when Western DEMO only encompass approximately 30% of
humankind (Triandis, 1994).
Despite the importance of such pursuits, however, there is a fundamental paradox
in DEMO culture and negotiation literature. Even though the practicality of being able to
negotiate effectively with people from different cultures is used to justify the DEMO to
develop cross-cultural theory, the vast majority of research remains comparative (Adler
& Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998). In other words, with some exceptions (Adair,
Okumura, & Brett 2001; DEMO & Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998; Cai, Drake, &
1
Wilson, 2000; Natlandsmyr & Rognes, 1995), research focuses on comparing different
negotiation behaviors across cultures, but of behaviors as they occur in mono-cultural
settings, instead of directly examining intercultural settings where cultural barriers exist
across the negotiation table. Implicit to this comparative approach is the researcherâs
DEMO that people behave similarly to other negotiators from foreign cultures as they
do with those from their own culture, yet there is evidence showing this is not the case
(e.g. Adair et al., 2001; Adler & Graham, 1989). If practice is to truly benefit from
theory, more attention needs to be paid to intercultural negotiations. In reviewing the
most recent and comprehensive handbook of negotiation and culture (Gelfand & Brett,
2004), Kray (2005) observes, âalthough researchers have identified a host of cross-
cultural differences in styles and preferences, negotiation scholars might consider
expanding beyond simple demonstrations of differencesâ¦and explore whether awareness
of these DEMO makes a differenceâ¦knowledge about factors influencing the
effectiveness of intercultural negotiations is sparseâ (p.159). Indeed, as of yet, the culture
and negotiation literature reveals little as to what characteristics negotiators can be
selected and DEMO trained upon in order to maximize the chances of reaching optimal
agreements in negotiations that traverse cultural borders.
As such, the focus of this study was to take an individual differences approach to
see if a DEMO developed construct, cultural intelligence (CQ), defined as an individualâs
capability to adapt effectively to situations of cultural diversity (Earley & Ang, DEMO),
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness, over and beyond other similar yet distinct
interpersonal constructs including international experience (travel and living
experiences), personality (openness, extraversion, empathy), and other forms of
2
intelligence (emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). We reasoned that because CQ
is a concept that specifically deals with a personâs skill level in DEMO cultural
barriers, it holds promise as a useful predictor in the DEMO of intercultural negotiations.
More specifically, we examined whether intercultural dyads with DEMO CQ as compared
with dyads with lower CQ would achieve higher negotiation outcomes, namely joint
profit and relational capital (Gelfand, Major, Raver, Nishii, & OâBrien, 2006) by way of
integrative sequencing of information behaviors as well as sequencing of cooperative
relationship management behaviors. In addition, we explored the dyad composition of
CQ, that is, whether it DEMO one or two high CQ negotiators to achieve such effective
negotiation processes and outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no other research has
directly addressed our broader question, what predicts intercultural negotiation
effectiveness?
By examining intercultural negotiation âeffectivenessâ not only in terms of
negotiation outcomes but DEMO in terms of sequencing of behaviors that lead to these
outcomes, DEMO also make a contribution to the negotiation process literature in addition to
the cross-cultural literature. We move beyond the predominant paradigm of just looking
DEMO the effects of an unexamined negotiation input, CQ, on negotiation outcomes
(Weingart & Olekalns, 2004), but pay much-needed attention to the DEMO negotiation
process through which CQ exerts its effects in intercultural contexts.
In the following sections, we first review empirical findings from a handful of
studies on intercultural negotiation that does exist in the literature, focusing on how and
why bargaining in intercultural contexts are challenging. Second, we review the literature
on negotiation processes and argue that coordinated and synchronized behavior DEMO is
3
difficult to achieve but required for effective intercultural negotiation involves strategic
sequencing DEMO integrative information behaviors as well as cooperative relationship
management behaviors. Finally, DEMO discuss the construct of CQ, review empirical
findings, and present our theory as to why CQ may improve intercultural negotiation
effectiveness by way DEMO sequencing integrative information behaviors as well as
relationship management behaviors.
Intercultural Negotiations: Why are they so Difficult?
There are only a few studies in the culture and negotiation literature that directly
examine negotiations in intercultural DEMO A consistent finding from what evidence
does exist, however, is that joint profit, or mutually beneficial outcomes are harder to
achieve in intercultural than intracultural settings. For example, Adler & Graham (1989)
found DEMO joint profits were reduced for the Japanese when negotiating with Americans
than when negotiating with other Japanese. Similarly, joint profits were lower for
Anglophone Canadians when negotiating with Francophone Canadians than when
negotiating within their own DEMO group. Natlandsmyr & Rognes (1995) similarly
found that intercultural groups of Mexicans and Norwegians achieved lower joint profit
than intracultural groups of Norwegians. DEMO recently, Brett and Okumura (1998) found
that intercultural negotiations between DEMO and Japanese managers realized less joint
gains than intracultural negotiations between Japanese managers or intracultural
negotiations between American managers. Americans in particular had poor DEMO
accuracy of Japanese negotiatorsâ priorities of issues.
Why is it that intercultural negotiators are less able to achieve mutually beneficial
outcomes compared to negotiators DEMO counterparts are from the same culture? Several
4
explanations can be identified in the literature. First, from a cognitive perspective, it
seems that intercultural negotiators have difficulty developing a shared understanding of
the task at hand. For example, Brett and Okumura (1998) argued that U.S. and Japanese
negotiators bring different culture-specific schemas to the negotiation DEMO which creates
major communication inefficiency. Indeed, they found that American negotiators DEMO
value individualism had a higher self-interest schema than the Japanese who value
collectivism, and Japanese negotiators who value hierarchy had a higher power schema
than American negotiators who value egalitarianism. Similarly, Gelfand and McCusker
(2002) argued that different culture-specific metaphoric mappings of the negotiation
create different goals, scripts, and feelings in negotiation which makes it especially
difficult to organize social action (Weick, 1979). For example, Americans operating
under a sports metaphor may unconsciously assume that the goal of the negotiation is DEMO
conduct a performance contest, the script to emphasize aggressive behavior in DEMO
sportsmanship is expected, and feelings such as satisfaction to result from DEMO In
contrast, the Japanese operating under a household gathering metaphor may DEMO the
goal of the negotiation is to ensure continuity and harmony of the group, the script to
emphasize face-saving where aggression is eschewed, DEMO feelings such as satisfaction to
result from role fulfillment. Cai (1998) found empirical support for this notion
specifically in terms of goals; U.S. negotiators focused more on achieving short-term,
instrumental goals, whereas Taiwanese negotiators focused on long- term, global goals.
In a laboratory study, Gelfand, Nishii, Godfrey, and Raver (2003) found that metaphoric
similarity in DEMO was indeed an important predictor of joint gain. In so much as
intercultural negotiatorsâ metaphors differ, there is an extra hurdle that must be overcome
5
which intracultural negotiators do not face; that is, intercultural negotiators first DEMO to
ânegotiate the negotiationâ, or come to a shared understanding of DEMO kind of task the
negotiation situation is about in terms of goals, scripts, and feelings on top of addressing
the actual negotiation issues DEMO
Second, from a skill-based perspective, intercultural negotiators may lack the
behavioral flexibility in overcoming their habitual, culturally normative behaviors, thus
creating potential DEMO misunderstanding. For example, from the Brett and Okumura
(1998) dataset, Adair et al. (2001) found that American and Japanese negotiators use
DEMO normative types of integrative behaviors in order to create joint gain in their
respective cultures. Americans, who come from a low-context culture normatively
engaged in high frequencies of direct communication behaviors (e.g. priority
information) where DEMO intended meaning is explicitly portrayed in their messages that
are spoken. The Japanese, however, who come from a high-context culture engaged in
high DEMO of indirect communication behaviors (e.g. offers) in which the intended
meaning is carried through the context of the messages given. The authors also DEMO that
in intercultural settings, the Japanese adapted their behaviors to the DEMO direct
approach, whereas Americans did not adapt and continued to use DEMO habitual direct
behaviors. Despite the Japanese negotiatorsâ efforts, however, Americans still had
misunderstandings of their counterparts, as indicated by their use of repetitive,
confirmatory, and clarifying questions. It is interesting to note looking across these two
studies that even though Japanese intercultural negotiators had accurate understanding DEMO
their American counterpartsâ issue priorities, as well as being able to DEMO the
âAmericanâ way, it was not enough for intercultural negotiators to DEMO the same level
6
of joint profit as compared with American or Japanese intracultural negotiators.
This DEMO to a third explanation for why intercultural negotiations are particularly
difficult compared to intracultural negotiations. That is, motivation may be an additional
factor that is necessary for integrative success. For example, it is possible that Japanese
intercultural negotiators did not act on their judgment accuracy to create high DEMO gains
because they were not as motivated as Japanese intracultural negotiators to reach
integrative agreement (Adair et al. 2001). It is a well documented finding in social
psychology that people are much more comfortable interacting DEMO ingroup members
(Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Furthermore, incongruent cognitive DEMO and normative
behaviors are more likely to make intercultural negotiations more stressful than
intracultural negotiations (George, Jones, & Gonzalez, 1998; Kumar, DEMO), making it
especially difficult for intercultural negotiators to persist seeking integrative outcomes.
Clearly, when bargaining across the cultural divide, negotiators experience
considerable DEMO, motivational, and behavioral challenges which can impede the
negotiation process, DEMO to suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, in trying to improve
intercultural negotiation effectiveness, the two relevant questions are: What does an
effective negotiation process look like, and what individual differences might help
intercultural dyads to achieve this effective process? In the next section, we focus on the
first DEMO and review the U.S. literature on negotiation process to show that
coordinated and synchronized behaviors that lead to optimal outcomes are reflected in
certain DEMO of strategic sequencing of negotiation behaviors. We then argue that in
intercultural contexts, negotiators that are able to achieve high joint profit are those who
are able to develop and maintain a stable pattern of cooperative DEMO interaction despite
7
cultural differences, through the use of integrative sequences of information behaviors as
well as cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors. After the next
section DEMO negotiation process, we then explore CQ as a potential individual difference
DEMO that may predict such sequences in intercultural negotiations.
Negotiation Process: Strategic DEMO
In the U.S. literature, the process of negotiation, or the ways in which negotiators
exchange information through communication in their search for an DEMO, has
received considerably less research attention than have negotiation inputs (e.g. negotiator
characteristics, styles, cognitions, motives) and outcomes of negotiation (e.g. individual
and joint profits) (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). However, DEMO is wide agreement among
researchers in this burgeoning literature that stable and organized social action between
two negotiators is reflected in certain types of DEMO sequencing of behaviors. Strategic
sequences alter the context of the negotiation and shape the subsequent outcomes that are
obtained (Brett, Shapiro, Lytle, DEMO; Kelley, 1997; Neale & Northcraft, 1991; Putnam,
1990; Roloff, Tutzauer, & Dailey, 1989). For example, reciprocal sequences DEMO to
negotiators matching each otherâs moves exactly (e.g. priority information eliciting
DEMO information), and is interpreted as evidence that negotiators hold a high level of
shared understanding of the negotiation task (Putnam, 1990; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004).
Reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors in particular move the negotiation down a
cooperative path increasing the likelihood of maximizing joint DEMO (Weingart &
Olekalns, 2004). There is robust empirical evidence DEMO that reciprocating
integrative tactics generate high joint outcomes (Adair, 2003; DEMO & Smith, 2000;
Weingart, Prietula, Hyder, & Genovese, DEMO; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004; Weingart,
8
Thompson, Bazerman, & Carroll, 1990). Furthermore, complementary sequences refer DEMO
negotiators not matching each otherâs moves exactly, but pairing similar tactics DEMO have
the same strategic focus, that is, tactics of either integrative or distributive categories. For
example, priority information followed by a multi-issue offer has the same strategic focus
of being integrative, yet is not identical. Adair and Brett (2005) and Adair et al. (2001)
remarked that particularly in international negotiations, complementary sequences could
also signal a shared cooperative understanding of the task, if parties enact integrative
intentions but with different culturally normative kinds of behaviors.
Clearly, sequencing integrative behaviors while negotiators maintain a mutually
shared understanding of the negotiation as a cooperative problem-solving DEMO move
them towards integrative agreements. However, particularly for intercultural negotiators,
DEMO sequences should be much more difficult to maintain, given the cognitive,DEMO
behavioral, and motivational barriers discussed previously. For example, from a
behavioral skill-based perspective, if a low-context American negotiator intends to be
cooperative and directly asks his or her counterpart about issue priorities, and the high-
context Japanese negotiator also intends to be cooperative but indirectly answers with DEMO
multi-issue offer, the American not knowing how to correctly attribute meaning DEMO the
indirect behavior may misjudge that the Japanese negotiator is being competitive by
avoiding the question and in turn, break the sequence of cooperative behaviors by
responding negatively. Evidence for difficulties in synchronizing behaviors in
intercultural DEMO was indirectly found in Adair and Brettâs (2005) study where they
observed that intercultural dyads took longer than intracultural dyads to reach stable
DEMO patterns. Furthermore, it stands to reason that divergence in the content DEMO
9
cognitive structures is also an obstacle for maintaining sequences of integrative
behaviors.  For example, if one negotiator implicitly focuses on short-term, instrumental
goals DEMO the other focuses on long-term, relational goals, the misalignment of the
two goals should make synchronization of behaviors more difficult than when the DEMO
are aligned. Finally, if negotiators lack the motivation or persistence in DEMO with
people from different cultures in the first place or easily becomes unmotivated because of
cultural barriers, the already fragile process of sequencing behaviors becomes unlikely to
occur.
We argue then, that for intercultural negotiations to be effective, dyads would
ideally consist of negotiators who have the capabilities in overcoming the cognitive,
motivational, and behavioral hurdles mentioned above and are able to maintain
sequencing of integrative behaviors. Furthermore, we argue that in addition to integrative
sequences which focus on information exchange and is DEMO task focused, effective
intercultural negotiators would manage the relationship to maintain DEMO fragile
cooperative context and engage in sequences of cooperative relationship-focused
comments throughout the negotiation (e.g. non task-focused expressions of enthusiasm
for working together). Thus, in our study we focused on sequences of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors,
which we expected to DEMO both objective and subjects aspects of negotiation
outcomes. For negotiation outcomes, DEMO main focus was on joint profit but we also
examined relational capital (Gelfand et al., 2006), or the quality of the on-going
DEMO alongside joint profit. Subjectively measured outcomes such as relational
capital is increasingly recognized by scholars as an important criterion since negotiation
10
effectiveness is both the cause and consequence of the working relationship (e.g. Allred,
Mallozzi, Matsui, & Raia, 1997; Gelfand et al., 2006; Greenhalgh & Kramer, 1990;
Kramer & Messick, 1995).
Below, we argue that CQ will predict both integrative sequences of information
behaviors as well as cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors, which
in turn will lead to joint profit and relational capital in intercultural negotiation (see figure
1). Before we present our theory as to why DEMO is beneficial, we will first discuss the
construct of cultural intelligence DEMO detail and review empirical findings on CQ in the
next section.
Cultural Intelligence
Construct of CQ
Cultural intelligence (CQ), defined as a personâs capability in successfully
adapting to new cultural settings (Earley & Ang, DEMO) was developed as a construct to
address a question shared by DEMO international HR managers: Why is it that some
individuals who sometimes DEMO to be lacking social skills within their own culture
adjust easily, DEMO, and entirely to new cultures whereas other individuals, even those
who possess high interpersonal skills within their own cultures, do not (Earley & Ang,
2003)? In response to this need of understanding individual differences in cultural
adaptation, Earley and Ang (2003) conceptualized CQ as a multi-faceted characteristic
consisting of meta-cognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral components.
DEMO meta-cognitive facet of CQ refers to the level of cultural mindfulness during
intercultural interactions (Ang, Van Dyne, & Koh, 2004). People DEMO are high on meta-
cognitive CQ engage in higher-order thinking which involves the active control over
11
cognitive processes engaged in learning about a new culture. In other words, individuals
with high meta-cognitive CQ plan how to approach learning about the DEMO culture,
monitor their own comprehension, and evaluate their own progress DEMO
comprehending the new culture. Meta-cognitive CQ is especially an important
component of cultural intelligence for several reasons: 1) it promotes active thinking
about DEMO and situations in foreign cultural settings; 2) it prevents reliance on rigid,
culturally bounded thinking and assumptions; and 3) it drives DEMO to revise their
strategies so that they are more likely to experience successful cross-cultural interactions
(Ang et al., 2004).
Whereas meta-cognitive CQ DEMO higher-level cognitive processes, cognitive
CQ refers to acquired knowledge about a DEMO culture. This includes declarative
knowledge, which refers to knowing about things DEMO as a new cultureâs economic,
political, and legal systems, as well as procedural knowledge which refers to knowing
how to do things DEMO a new culture. Declarative knowledge can be acquired through
observation or by directly asking host nationals, whereas procedural knowledge can be
obtained through mimicry. Cognitive CQ is important for cultural intelligence because
individuals can gain a DEMO understanding of the systems that shape specific patterns of
social interaction within a culture (Ang et al., 2004).
Motivational CQ emphasizes a DEMO values and self-efficacy in adapting to
new cultures. Individuals with high motivational CQ are genuinely interested and are
open to new cultural experiences. They DEMO also highly self-efficacious about cross-
cultural interactions and strongly believe in their own ability to deal with different
perspectives of others, unfamiliar situations, DEMO handle complexity and uncertainty.
12
When individuals with high motivational CQ face obstacles or failures, they reengage
with perseverance rather than withdrawing from the task.  Motivational CQ is important
for cultural intelligence because it triggers effort and action as well as DEMO and
intensifying a personâs search for the best way to adapt to new cultural environments
(Earley & Ang, 2003).
Finally, behavioral CQ refers to the extent to which an individual acts
appropriately, both verbally and non-verbally, in new cultural contexts (Ang et al., 2004).
Individuals with high behavioral CQ are flexible and change their behaviors to DEMO the
needs of a particular cultural situation. More specifically, they are DEMO to the range
of behaviors that are enacted, the culture-specific display DEMO for nonverbal expressions,
and the meanings that are attributed to certain non-verbal behaviors. Furthermore,
knowing and wanting to elicit the right response DEMO not enough for behavioral CQ; one
must overcome already learned habits DEMO elicit the appropriate response.
Empirical Findings on CQ
Given the infancy of the construct, empirical research on CQ is sparse, yet
evidence for DEMO predictive validity is growing. For example, in a series of studies, Ang,
Van Dyne, Koh and Ng (2004) found that CQ significantly predicted task performance
and adjustment in situations of cultural diversity among DEMO, international
executives, and foreign professionals. In one study, they gave DEMO a cultural
judgment and decision-making task where participants were required to read five cultural
interaction scenarios and select the best response that explained the DEMO Meta-
cognitive and cognitive CQ significantly predicted cultural judgment and decision-
making over and beyond demographic characteristics and cognitive ability.
13
In a second study, business executives of various nationalities participated in an
executive development program on cultural intelligence. They were assigned to
intercultural dyads DEMO given an assignment where they were required to analyze a
business scenario for developing a vacant piece of land in a culturally diverse part DEMO
Singapore. Their tasks consisted of convincing landowners that their plan had both
marketing and financial viability. Each intercultural dyad wrote a business proposal and
DEMO a presentation of their proposal at the end of the program. Peers rated each
individualâs task performance. It was found that meta-cognitive and behavioral DEMO
predicted task performance, and motivational and behavioral CQ predicted general
adjustment.
DEMO study three, foreign professionals completed an online survey on general, work,
and interaction adjustment, and each professionalâs supervisors rated his or her work
performance. Meta-cognitive CQ and behavioral CQ predicted work performance while
motivational DEMO behavioral CQ predicted all three types of adjustment, over and beyond
DEMO characteristics.
In another study, Templer, Tay, and Chandrasekar (2006) DEMO the utility of
motivational CQ in predicting general and work adjustment over and beyond realistic job
previews (RJP) and realistic living conditions previews (RLCP) among expatriates. As
hypothesized, the authors found that motivational CQ DEMO positively related to general
and work adjustment over and beyond the two types of job previews as well as gender,
age, time in host country, as well as prior international assignments.
In sum, the DEMO validity of CQ has been shown in many samples, (i.e.
undergraduates, expatriates, foreign professionals, international executives) using many
14
criteria (i.e. cultural judgment tasks, quality of business proposals developed through
DEMO intercultural interaction, adjustment in foreign assignments), and over and
beyond DEMO constructs (i.e. demographics, intelligence, international experience). In the
next DEMO, we argue that CQ is also beneficial in the context of DEMO
negotiations.
Cultural Intelligence and Intercultural Negotiation Effectiveness
Based on the previous discussion, we postulated that intercultural dyads with high
CQ will be able to organize social action and engage in more sequences of integrative
information behaviors DEMO sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors,
allowing them to achieve high negotiation outcomes compared with dyads with low CQ.
Hypothesized effects are summarized DEMO figure 1.
Hypotheses: CQ and Strategic Sequences
First, we expected that when dyads consist of individuals with high CQ, they will
engage in more sequencing of integrative information exchange behaviors than when
dyads consist of DEMO with low CQ. Because high CQ individuals enjoy interacting
with people from other cultures, they are more likely to adopt a cooperative approach to
negotiating. In addition, high CQ individuals, with their meta-cognitive abilities are
DEMO aware that culture may cause potential misunderstandings in intercultural
contexts. Thus, DEMO will question their own cultural assumptions as well as draw on their
existing knowledge of other cultures to try to understand their counterpartsâ cultural
DEMO Furthermore, high CQ individuals possess a wider range of behaviors they
DEMO accurately interpret as well as enact and are less prone to threats that throw
15
intercultural negotiators out of sync. For example, using the previously mentioned
example of a direct question about issue priorities being followed by an indirect DEMO
issue offer, high CQ Americans are more likely to be able DEMO recognize that people from
high context cultures use indirect communication as a way to provide information and
correctly attribute the indirect tactic as cooperative, as well as still being able to glean
information that is present DEMO the context of the messages given. Finally, high CQ
individuals are DEMO likely to persist even if the negotiation becomes stressful and
difficult given their high motivation in intercultural situations.
Thus, based on the previous discussion, we predicted that CQ predicts sequences
of integrative information behaviors. We examined integrative sequences in two ways:
reciprocal integrative sequences which occur when DEMO certain negotiation tactic is
followed by an identical negotiation tactic, and DEMO integrative sequences
which occur when a negotiation tactic is followed by a different negotiation tactic, but of
the same general integrative information strategy. Furthermore, borrowing from Adairâs
(2003) approach, we studied sequencing as they DEMO at immediate and delayed time
lags.
H1. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed reciprocal sequences of DEMO information behaviors than dyads
with lower CQ.
H2. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed complementary sequences DEMO integrative information behaviors than
dyads with lower CQ.
Second, in addition DEMO engaging in sequences of integrative information behaviors
16
that are task-focused, we expected dyads with high CQ to manage the relationship itself
by engaging in more sequences of cooperative comments (e.g. expressions of enthusiasm
for working together, cooperative acknowledgement of anotherâs perspective) that
DEMO the cooperative context of the negotiation than dyads with low CQ. Although
this type of sequencing has not been examined before in the literature, we expected it was
another way in which high CQ individuals, who are conscious of potential cultural
misunderstandings and stress that can arise out DEMO intercultural interactions, to effectively
buffer the negotiation.
H3. Dyads with higher DEMO will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors than dyads
with lower CQ.
Hypotheses: Strategic Sequences and Negotiation Outcomes
In the negotiation process literature, it has generally been found that sequences of
cooperative behaviors lead to joint profit (Adair, DEMO; Olekalns & Smith, 2000;
Weingart et al., 1999; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004; Weingart et al., 1990); however, most
DEMO examining this relationship have been conducted in U.S. intracultural settings.
Weingart and Olekalns (2004) argue that more research needs to examine the strategic
DEMO relationship as they occur in different negotiation contexts. Thus, in
this DEMO, we examine the relationship between strategic sequences and joint profit as
DEMO occur in the intercultural context. Based on the previous U.S. finding that generally,
sequences of cooperative behaviors lead to joint profit, we predicted the following:
H4. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate DEMO/or delayed
reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve higher
17
joint profit.
H5. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/DEMO delayed
complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve
higher joint profit.
H6. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
DEMO sequences of relationship management-focused behaviors will
achieve higher joint profit.
Furthermore, DEMO joint profit, we examined dyad-level relational capital, or
what Gelfand et al. (2006) define as âthe relational assets that accumulate within a
DEMO dyadic negotiation relationshipâ (p.11), more specifically consisting of mutual
liking, knowledge, trust, and commitment to continuing the relationship. Subjective
outcomes such DEMO relational capital are increasingly recognized by scholars as an
important criterion since negotiation effectiveness is both the cause and consequence of
the working relationship (e.g. Allred et al., 1997; Gelfand et al., 2006; Greenhalgh &
Kramer, 1990; Kramer & Messick, 1995). We generally expected that intercultural dyads
that engage in sequences of both integrative information behaviors DEMO well as relationship
management behaviors would gain higher relational capital.
H7. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
reciprocal sequences DEMO integrative information behaviors will achieve higher
relational capital.
H8. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
complementary sequences of integrative DEMO behaviors will achieve
higher relational capital.
18
H9. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
DEMO sequences of relationship management behaviors will achieve higher
relational capital.
Control Variables: Other Individual Difference Constructs
In examining whether CQ predicts the above-mentioned sequences, we included
other individual difference constructs as controls. Although there is no other empirical
study linking other individual differences to strategic sequences, we felt it was important
to control for them, given evidence of individual differences predicting integrative
outcomes and that these effects may have been mediated by DEMO sequencing of behaviors.
For example, Barry and Friedman (1998) found DEMO specifically in integrative
bargaining, dyad-level cognitive ability predicted the level of DEMO gain. The authors also
found that extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness did not help joint
outcomes; however in a distributive bargaining context, extraversion DEMO agreeableness
were liabilities. Furthermore, Foo, Elfenbein, Tan, & Aik (DEMO) found that higher
average emotional intelligence predicted better joint gain. Finally, Ma & Jaeger (2005)
found that among Chinese negotiators, openness DEMO experience was positively related to
self-reported integrative behaviors and extraversion was positively related to both self-
reported integrative and competitive behaviors. Thus, in our study, we controlled for
cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, openness to experience, extraversion, empathy,
and international experience in testing whether CQ predicts DEMO of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of relationship management behaviors. Given that
CQ specifically deals with overcoming cultural problems and is more conceptually
relevant DEMO the intercultural negotiation context than the other individual difference
19
constructs, we expected CQ to have predictive power over and beyond these other
individual differences. In order to provide a strong test of CQâs DEMO power of
strategic sequences over and beyond these other constructs, we DEMO all six controls
in our analyses.
Exploratory Analyses
In addition to the hypothesized relationships, we examined two exploratory
questions. First, although our theory DEMO kept at the overall CQ level, we examined
which of the DEMO CQ facets influence sequences of integrative information behaviors and
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors. We were interested in
exploring what specific facet could DEMO more predictive power over others. For example,
although having the ability to think meta-cognitively about culture, having extensive
knowledge about other cultures, DEMO being able to adapt behaviorally are most likely
important in maintaining strategic sequences, it could be that these factors have little
effect if the negotiatorsâ motivation to interact with people from different cultures is
absent in DEMO first place.
Second, we explored the effects of dyad composition of DEMO on strategic
sequences; that is, whether it takes one high CQ negotiator or two high CQ negotiators to
have a positive impact on DEMO in sequences of integrative information behaviors as
well as relationship management behaviors. Given that strategic sequencing is a
conjunctive task (Steiner, 1972) in which contributions from both negotiators are required
for high performance, it is possible that a dyadâs level of strategic sequencing depends on
the lowest DEMO of CQ within the dyad, or in other words, the âweakest linkâ. That is,
even if one negotiator possesses high CQ, as long as the other negotiator has low CQ and
20
does not contribute to the joint activity of reciprocating integrative as well DEMO cooperative
behaviors, the dyad may still suffer as a result. Thus, in sum, we explored the effects of
specific facets of CQ, DEMO well as the dyad composition of CQ, on sequences of integrative
DEMO behaviors and sequences of relationship management behaviors.

Chapter 2: Method
Participants
150 students (75 Americans and 75 East DEMO) at both undergraduate and
graduate levels were recruited through flyers, listservs, and newspaper advertisements at
a large university in Maryland. For the American sample, the advertisement specifically
targeted âAmerican citizens of western European descentâ and for the East Asian sample,
those who have âlived in the DEMO for less than five years and are originally from China
(including DEMO), Japan, or Koreaâ. All students were given a $20 cash DEMO for use at
the campus bookstore for participation. The American sample consisted of 29 males and
46 females, and the mean age was 26.9 years old. The East Asian sample consisted of 28
males and 47 DEMO, and the mean age was 26 years old. American and East DEMO
students were first matched on sex and level of education (graduate DEMO undergraduate),
and then randomly paired to form 75 intercultural negotiation DEMO Within the dyad,
participants were randomly assigned to one of two negotiator roles. 10 dyads had at least
one member who did not DEMO consent to the use of their digitally-recorded process data.
Thus, 10 DEMO were excluded from analyses with a final dyad-level sample size of 65,
consisting of 130 individuals.
Procedure
The study took part over two DEMO, each session separated by a minimum of
one week. On the DEMO day, participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire
from DEMO that assessed all individual difference characteristics, except for cognitive
ability which DEMO a timed test, and could not be conducted online. On the DEMO
22
day, participants were asked to come into the laboratory to role-play a negotiation
simulation. Participants first read their role and task information and filled DEMO a pre-
negotiation planning sheet individually. After being reminded to take their negotiation
roles seriously, participants were brought together with their partners from the other
culture to role-play a 20-minute negotiation while being digitally tape-recorded. At DEMO
minutes into the negotiation, participants were given a reminder that there DEMO five
minutes remaining. After the negotiation session, both negotiators filled out DEMO final
agreement form that indicated the level of settlement reached for each negotiation issue.
Negotiators were then separated to fill out a post-negotiation questionnaire DEMO assessed
subjective negotiation outcomes. After filling out the post- negotiation questionnaire,
participants were timed for 12 minutes to complete a test of cognitive DEMO Finally,
participants were fully debriefed on the purpose of the study.
Negotiation Task
The negotiation simulation was adapted from Towers Market II, used in previous
research on integrative bargaining (Weingart, Olekalns, & Smith, DEMO), and involved
one participant playing the role of a specialty grocery shop owner, and the other
participant playing the role of a specialty wine shop owner. Participants were told that a
successful real estate company DEMO proposed developing a multifunctional market that
consists of a wine store and a grocery store under one roof with common dÃ©cor but with
separate DEMO for their respective top-quality products. Participants were told that they
were seriously interested in the shared market but needed to negotiate five unresolved
issues DEMO the other vendor: 1) Hours of Operation, 2) Renovation Costs, 3) Floor
Space, 4) Temperature, and 5) Grand Opening DEMO
23
Each participant was given role instructions that included a payoff schedule that
DEMO the five possible levels of settlement on each of the five negotiation issues and the
number of points associated with each level of settlement DEMO an issue. Points
indicated the amount of worth of that level of settlement to the negotiator (see table 1).
Depending on which negotiation role the participant played, different negotiation issues
were most important and least important to the negotiator. For example, for the grocery
shop owner, DEMO most important issue was the Grand Opening Date (with the best
DEMO option September 1 worth 400 points), whereas for the wine shop owner, the
most important issue was the Renovation Cost (with the DEMO settlement option $30,000
also worth 400 points). Thus, negotiation DEMO Grand Opening Date and Renovation
Cost were integrative issues where negotiators could identify differences in priorities and
make tradeoffs. Hours of Operation and Temperature DEMO distributive issues in which
the payoff for one negotiator was diametrically opposite of the other negotiator, and Floor
Space was a compatible issue where the payoff structure was identical for both
negotiators. In order to ensure DEMO participants understood the payoff schedule, a quiz
was included in the DEMO instructions which asked participants to calculate the total
number of points that would be gained given a specific settlement across the five issues.
If DEMO got the answer incorrect, they were asked to review the task DEMO
again.
Coding of Negotiation Behaviors at the Tactical Level
Coding Scheme
Process data from the digital tape-recordings of negotiation sessions were
transcribed, unitized, DEMO coded. The coding scheme was adapted from one developed by
24
Weingart and colleagues for their Towers Market II negotiation simulation (cf. Weingart
et al., 2004; see appendix A for 37 tactic codes and DEMO).
Coding Process
After all of the process data had been transcribed, the negotiation dialogue was
unitized and coded at the thought-unit level, DEMO a thought-unit refers to one thought or
idea which roughly corresponds to a sentence. Through multiple half-day practice
sessions, three research assistants were trained on how to unitize the negotiation dialogue
into thought units. Initial practice DEMO were conducted as a group in order for
research assistants to develop a collective understanding of how to deal with difficult
cases such as DEMO one thought unit was expressed repeatedly in multiple sentences, as
well DEMO when multiple thought units were expressed within one sentence. Research
assistants were trained until they reached a high level of unitizing reliability then unitized
DEMO own batch of transcripts. Three full transcripts were randomly chosen for all
research assistants to unitize before each unitized their own batch. Between all DEMO of
research assistants, Guetzkowâs U (Guetzkow, 1950) was calculated, DEMO is the
difference between the number of units identified by an independent coder and the âtrueâ
number of units (i.e. the average of the two codersâ estimates).  The average Guetzkowâs
U between all pairs of research assistants, for any one of the three full transcripts was
under 0.06, indicating high unitizing reliability (Guetzkow, 1950).
Once all process data had been unitized, two coders blind to all research
hypotheses content-coded the negotiation transcripts at the tactical level. Again, coders
were trained through multiple half-day practice sessions, this time specifically on how to
apply the coding scheme. During the practice sessions, coders independently worked on
25
their own, and then compared their answers in order to resolve disagreements and
develop a collective understanding of each tactical code. At the end DEMO the practice
sessions, the two research assistants coded three randomly drawn DEMO transcripts. The
average inter-rater reliability of the three transcripts was high, DEMO Cohenâs K = 0.88. 1
Operationalizing Frequencies of Strategic Sequences: Sequences DEMO Integrative
Information Behaviors and Sequence of Cooperative Relationship Management
Behaviors
Grouping of Negotiation Tactics into Strategic Clusters
Once all negotiation behaviors for each speaking DEMO within a dyad were coded at
the tactical level as listed in appendix A (e.g. states preference within a single issue,
states priority information across two or more issues, etc.), all 37 negotiation tactics were
conceptually grouped into strategic clusters, which was the level of abstraction in which
strategic sequences were defined (see below for details). First, the strategic cluster of
integrative information included the following negotiation tactics: DEMO) states preference
within a single issue, b) states priority information DEMO two or more issues, c) asks a
question about otherâs issue preference, d) asks a question about otherâs priority across
two or DEMO issues, e) notes issue difference with sympathy, f) notes similarity in issue
preference or priority, g) suggests compromise or willingness to DEMO, h) suggests
package tradeoff of two or more issues, i) expresses positive reaction to issues, j) makes
multi-issue offer, and k) suggests reciprocity. We conceptualized integrative information
more broadly than is typically done in U.S. negotiation research which focuses primarily
on direct ways of conveying DEMO (i.e. statements and questions about issue
preference and priorities, and stating issue differences and similarities), by including
26
integrative tactics that allowed for more indirect ways of conveying information which DEMO
more common in East Asian cultures (Adair et al., 2001; DEMO, 2003; Adair & Brett,
2005). We reasoned that in intercultural contexts, it is more realistic that high CQ
negotiators would use a wider repertoire of behaviors in exchanging information than
solely relying on DEMO behaviors that are normative in the U.S. Thus, in examining
integrative DEMO, it is important to not only include Western derived measures of
DEMO but also Eastern derived measures of integration, lest the measure be DEMO
Thus, we also included the following tactics as integrative information: suggests
compromise or willingness to concede; suggests package tradeoff of two or more issues;
expresses positive reaction to issues; makes multi-issue offers; and DEMO reciprocity,
as they all convey information about oneâs issue preferences or priorities in an indirect,
implicit way.
Second, in order to examine the negotiation process in terms of not only task-
focused integrative information DEMO but of how negotiators manage their
relationships with each other, we DEMO the strategic cluster of cooperative relationship
management, which included the following DEMO tactics: a) makes off-task
comments about cooperation, b) notes mutual interdependence, and c) comments that
validate otherâs perspective. Finally, other negotiation tactics were also grouped into
strategy clusters of distributive information and competitive DEMO (see
appendix A); however, given that there were no significant results on these variables,
they will not be discussed further.
Definition DEMO Sequence of Integrative Information Behaviors: Reciprocal and Complementary.
Sequences of integrative DEMO behaviors occurred when a specific
27
negotiation tactic falling within the strategy cluster of integrative information (elicited by
negotiator 1), was followed by another negotiation tactic also falling within DEMO strategy
cluster of integrative information (elicited by negotiator 2). As DEMO mentioned,
sequences of integrative information behaviors were examined in two ways: 1) reciprocal
sequences of integrative information behaviors and 2) complementary sequences of
integrative information behaviors (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). A reciprocal DEMO
of integrative information behaviors occurred when the two negotiation tactics
comprising the sequence were identical (e.g. negotiator 1 states issue preference 
negotiator 2 states issue preference). For each dyad, reciprocal sequences for each
negotiation tactic within the integrative information strategy were counted and summed
to give DEMO overall count of reciprocal sequences across all tactic types. A complementary
sequence of integrative information behaviors occurred when the two negotiation tactics
comprising the DEMO were not identical (e.g. negotiator 1 asks a question about
otherâs DEMO across two or more issues  negotiator 2 states priority information
across two or more issues), but were of the same integrative information DEMO In sum,
both reciprocal and complementary sequences involve sequences of negotiation tactics
that fall under the integrative information strategy cluster. However, reciprocal sequences
involve two identical negotiation tactics whereas complementary sequences involve two
different negotiation DEMO
Definition of Sequences of Cooperative Relationship Management Behaviors
Sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors occurred when any
negotiation tactic falling within the strategic cluster DEMO cooperative relationship
management (elicited by negotiator 1) was followed by any negotiation tactic also falling
28
within the strategic cluster of cooperative relationship management (elicited by
negotiator 2). An example is when negotiator 1 makes a miscellaneous cooperative
comment DEMO is followed by negotiator 2 also making a miscellaneous cooperative
comment.
Counting Sequences at Immediate and Delayed Time Lags
In determining the frequency of DEMO type of sequences for all dyads, reciprocal
sequences of integrative information DEMO, complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors, and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors
were all counted at immediate and delayed time lags, as done by previous research
(Adair, 2003; Adair & Brett, 2004)DEMO Immediate time lags occurred when the tactic elicited
by negotiator 1 is immediately followed in the next speaking turn by the tactic elicited by
DEMO 2. Delayed time lags occurred when the tactic elicited by negotiator 1 is
followed three speaking turns afterwards by the tactic elicited by negotiator DEMO
As an illustration, suppose C represents a cooperative relationship management
tactic, O represents some other tactic, and the subscripts one and two represent the
negotiator within the dyad. If we are interested in counting the DEMO of immediate
cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors, the negotiation pattern DEMO
C1C2O1C2O1 has one immediate cooperative sequence of relationship management
behaviors among four total sequences at the immediate time lag (i.e. C1C2, C2O1, O1C2,
C2O1). However in counting the number of delayed cooperative sequences DEMO relationship
management behaviors, the same negotiation pattern would also count one DEMO
cooperative sequence of relationship management behaviors, this time between two total
DEMO at the delayed time lag (i.e. C1C2O1C2, C2O1C2O1). As such, raw dyad
29
frequencies were counted for reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors,
complementary DEMO of integrative information behaviors, and cooperative
sequences of relationship management behaviors DEMO both immediate and delayed time
lags. This was done automatically for each dyad, using Bakeman and Queraâs (1995)
General Sequential Querier software DEMO
To control for the total number of speaking turns across dyads (DEMO the length of
the negotiation), the raw frequencies for each type of strategic sequence was converted
into relative frequencies (c.f. Adair, 2003; Adair & Brett, 2005). More specifically, the
raw frequency of DEMO strategic sequences was divided by the dyadâs total number
of speaking turns â 1, whereas the raw frequency of delayed strategic sequences was
divided by the dyadâs total number of speaking turns â 3. Because small DEMO can
pose statistical challenges, the relative frequencies were then logit-transformed to DEMO
the tails of the distribution as recommended by Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003).
Examining the Latter Two-Thirds of the Negotiation DEMO
Given that it takes time for negotiatorsâ patterned behaviors such as strategic
sequences to emerge, especially in intercultural contexts (Adair & Brett, 2004; 2005), and
that it also takes time for individual differences to surface and impact social integration in
group contexts (Harrison, Price, Gavin, & Florey 2002), we examined whether CQ
predicts integrative and relationship management sequences at the latter two-thirds of the
negotiation. Borrowing Adair and DEMO (2005) approach, we divided each dyadâs full
transcript into thirds DEMO on the total number of speaking turns, and counted the relative
DEMO of each type of strategic sequence as they occurred in the latter two-thirds of
the negotiation. Tests of our hypotheses were also conducted examining DEMO
30
sequences that occurred in the full negotiation; however, results were stronger DEMO
on the latter two-thirds of the negotiation. Thus, we present the DEMO for the full
negotiation for the interested reader in appendix B; DEMO, we focus our analyses and
discussion looking at the latter two-thirds DEMO the negotiation.
Individual Difference Measures
Cultural Intelligence (CQ)
CQ was DEMO using a 20-item four-factor measure developed by Ang et al.
(2004, see appendix C for items), and used by others for empirical DEMO (Ang, Van
Dyne, & Koh, 2006; Templer et al., 2006). Evidence for factor equivalence in two
samples (Singapore and U.S.), acceptable reliability, temporal stability, and cross-
validation for the measure DEMO be found in a series of studies conducted by the authors.
Ang et al. (2004) first generated a pool of 53 items based DEMO the cross-cultural
adjustment literature and interviews with eight executives with extensive international
work experience. Three researchers and three other international executives with cross-
cultural DEMO then independently assessed the items for relevance, clarity, and
fidelity. They also rated each item for consistency with definitions of the four factors DEMO
CQ. For each factor, 10 best items were retained, forming the initial 40-item CQ scale.
Next, 576 undergraduate students in Singapore completed the 40-item CQ scale.
Principle axis factor analysis with varimax rotation demonstrated factor DEMO for 24
items in four primary factors with 62.9% of overall variance explained. Confirmatory
factor analysis using a second sample of Singaporean undergraduate students
DEMO that the 24-item measure had moderate fit, but a 20-item measure, used in
this study, had a significantly better fit. Reliabilities for this 20-item scale were
31
acceptable in Ang et al.âs (2004) sample: Î±Meta-cognitive = 0.76 for four items, Î±Cognitive =
0.84 for six items, Î±Motivational = 0.77 DEMO five items, and Î±Behavioral = 0.84 for five items. In
addition, the authors examined the temporal stability of the CQ scale. Participants
completed DEMO 20-item CQ scale for the second time four months after the first
assessment, and results showed factor invariance across time. Finally, for cross-
DEMO, Ang et al. had 337 American undergraduates complete the 20-item CQ
DEMO and found strong support for invariance in factor structure, factor loadings, and
factor covariances across the U.S. and Singapore. In a separate study DEMO the
personality antecedents of CQ, Ang et al. (2006) replicated DEMO results providing
additional evidence for the four-factor model of CQ.
In the present study, overall CQ had high reliability (Î±American = 0.90; Î±East Asian =
0.86). Example items include âI am conscious of the DEMO knowledge I apply to cross-
cultural interactionsâ for meta-cognitive CQ (four DEMO; Î±American = 0.84, Î±East Asian = 0.83
), âI know DEMO legal and economic systems of other culturesâ for cognitive CQ (six DEMO;
Î±American = 0.80, Î±East Asian = 0.78), âI enjoy DEMO with people from different
culturesâ for motivational CQ (five items; Î±American = 0.86, Î±East Asian = 0.70), and âI
change my verbal behavior when a cross-cultural interaction requires itâ for behavioral
CQ (five items; Î±American = 0.87, Î±East Asian = 0.77), to which participants DEMO their
extent of agreement from (1) âstrongly disagreeâ to (7) âstrongly agreeâ.
Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the
dimensionality of the 20 CQ items from Ang et al.âs (2004) scale. Given that individual
items tend to have low reliabilities and often violate assumptions of multivariate
normality, we used the parceling method, where DEMO clusters or âparcelsâ are used as
32
indicators instead of individual items (Bandalos, 2002; Nasser & Wisenbaker, DEMO). In
order to create parcels, for each CQ facet, exploratory factor analysis was conducted with
maximum likelihood estimation specifying one factor, in order to identify items with high
factor loadings and lower factor loadings. DEMO meta-cognitive CQ with a total of four
items, two parcels were DEMO with two items each, each parcel being the average of an
DEMO with a higher factor loading and an item with a lower factor loading. Similarly for
cognitive CQ with a total of six items, three parcels were created with two items each.
For motivational and behavioral CQ DEMO a total of five items respectively, three parcels
were created with DEMO items each, but the third parcel representing the one item with DEMO
median factor loading. Specifying a model where the parcels load onto relevant CQ
facets, and where all CQ facets load onto overall CQ, DEMO overall fit of the model was
good (Ï2 [40] = 73.46, p = 0.00; CFI = 0.95; SRMR = 0.08; RMSEA = 0.08).
International Experience
Both international travel experiences and international living experiences DEMO
measured. Borrowing from Takeuchi, Tesluk, Yun, and Lepak (2005), participants were
asked to list, in chronological order from most recent to least recent, the countries and
duration of each type of international experience that that they considered important. All
travel and international experiences were summed DEMO, and converted to weeks.
Openness to Experience
Openness to experience was DEMO with 10 items from Goldbergâs short
version of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item is, âI
spend time reflecting on thingsâ (Î±American = 0.75, Î±East Asian = 0.82), DEMO on a (1)
33
âvery inaccurateâ to (5) âvery accurateâ scale.
Extraversion
Extraversion was also DEMO with 10 items from Goldbergâs short version of
the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item is, âI am the life of
the partyâ (Î±American = 0.88, Î±East Asian = 0.89)DEMO
Empathy
Empathy was measured with Davisâ Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI, 1983),
consisting of 28 items (Î±American = 0.78, Î±East Asian = 0.77). Participantsâ responses were
made on a five-point scale ranging from (0) âdoes not describe me wellâ to (4) âdescribes
me wellâ. An example item includes, âI believe that there are two sides to every question
and try to look at them both.â
Emotional Intelligence
Emotional DEMO was measured using Schutte et al.âs (1998) 33-item scale
that was developed based on Salovey and Mayerâs (1990) conceptualization of the
construct (Î±American = 0.87; Î±East Asian = 0.91). An example item is âWhen I experience a
positive emotion, I know how to make it lastâ, and was administered on scale from (1)
âstrongly disagreeâ DEMO (5) âstrongly agreeâ.
Cognitive Ability
Cognitive ability was measured using the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT, 2000),
a 12-minute speed test consisting of 50 questions that assesses an individualâs math and
verbal abilities. 2
DEMO
Outcome Measures
Joint Profit
Joint profit was measured summing the total number DEMO points in the payoff
schedule earned by both negotiators within a dyad.
Relational Capital
Relational capital (Gelfand et al., 2006) was measured with 12 items written for
this study, tapping negotiatorsâ mutual liking, trust, understanding, and commitment to
their future relationship (see appendix D; Î±American = 0.88, Î±East Asian = 0.91).
Demographics
Five demographic variables were measured at the dyad-level: dyad sex (1=female,
2=male), dyad DEMO of education (1=undergraduate, 2=graduate), dyad mean age (years),
negotiation experience (1=no, 2=yes), and the East Asianâs length of DEMO in the U.S.
(months).

Chapter 3: Results
Descriptive Statistics
All individual difference scores and relational capital scores were aggregated to
the dyad-level by averaging the two negotiatorsâ scores. DEMO, standard deviations, and
dyad-level inter-correlations for the individual difference measures, DEMO sequences,
outcomes, as well as demographic variables are shown in DEMO 2. None of the
demographic variables were significantly correlated with negotiation processes or
outcomes, except for dyad sex and joint profit (r (62) = 0.35, p < 0.01), where male dyads
achieved higher DEMO profit than female dyads. In terms of individual differences and
strategic sequences, there were a number of notable significant correlations: CQ and
immediate DEMO sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) = 0.32, p < 0.05),
CQ and delayed complementary sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) = 0.31, p <
0.05), openness and immediate reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) =
0.32, p < DEMO), and emotional intelligence and immediate complementary sequences of
integrative behaviors (DEMO (65) = 0.25, p < 0.05).
Tests of Hypotheses DEMO Multiple Regression
All hypotheses, each representing a path in the model DEMO figure 1, were tested
using multiple regressions. Subsequently, a post-hoc path model was fit based on
significant regression paths found (see below).
Overall CQ and Negotiation Process
Hypothesis 1 predicted that dyads with higher DEMO CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or delayed reciprocal (i.e. DEMO) sequences of integrative information
36
behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience
(i.e. travel and living experiences), personality (i.e. openness, extraversion, DEMO) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). The results in
table 3 show that overall CQ did not significantly predict DEMO sequences of
integrative information behaviors at immediate (Î² = 0.08, p > 0.60) or delayed time lags
(Î² = 0.18, p > 0.15). Thus, hypothesis 1 was not supported.
Hypothesis 2 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or DEMO complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors
than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience (i.e. travel
and living experiences), DEMO (i.e. openness, extraversion, empathy) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional DEMO and cognitive ability). Table 4 shows
that dyad overall CQ did predict reciprocation of complementary integrative behaviors at
immediate (Î² = 0.32, DEMO < 0.05) and delayed (Î² = 0.33, p < 0.05) time lags. Thus,
hypothesis 2 was supported.
Hypothesis 3 predicted that DEMO with higher overall CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused
behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience
(i.e. travel and living experiences), personality (i.e. openness, extraversion, empathy) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). Table 5 shows
that dyad overall CQ is DEMO significantly related to the reciprocation of cooperative
relationship management-focused behaviors at immediate (Î² = 0.22, p > 0.10) or delayed
(Î² = DEMO, p > 0.10) time lags. Thus, hypothesis 3 was not DEMO
37
Negotiation Process and Outcomes
Hypothesis 4 predicted that immediate and/or delayed DEMO sequences of
integrative information behaviors would be positively related to joint profit. Having
included reciprocal, complementary, and cooperative relationship management sequences
in the DEMO equation, table 6 shows that there was no significant relationship
between DEMO sequences and joint profit at immediate (Î² = 0.05, p > 0.70) or
delayed (Î² = 0.14, p > 0.30) time DEMO Thus, Hypothesis 4 was not supported. Hypothesis
5 predicted that immediate DEMO/or delayed complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors would be positively related to joint profit. There was a positive
significant relationship at the immediate DEMO lag (Î² = 0.30, p < 0.05). Thus, hypothesis DEMO
was supported. Hypothesis 6 predicted a positive relationship between immediate and/or
delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors and joint profit.
Hypothesis 6 DEMO not supported as there were no significant relationships at the
immediate lag (Î² = 0.12, p > 0.30) or delayed lag (Î²= DEMO, p > 0.40).
Hypothesis 7 predicted that immediate and/or DEMO reciprocal sequences of
integrative information behaviors would have a positive effect on relational capital. Table
7 shows that having entered sequences of reciprocal, complementary, and cooperative
relationship management behaviors together into the regression equation, reciprocal
DEMO did not predict relational capital at immediate (Î² = 0.14, p > 0.2) or delayed (Î²
= -0.07, p > 0.50) DEMO lags. Thus, hypothesis 7 was not supported. Hypothesis 8
predicted that DEMO and/or delayed complementary sequences of integrative
behaviors would have a positive effect on relational capital. There was no significant
relationship at the immediate (Î²= 0.01, p > 0.9) or delayed (Î²= 0.08, p > 0.50) time lags.
38
Thus, hypothesis 8 was not supported. Finally, hypothesis 9 predicted that DEMO
and/or delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors have a
positive effect on relational capital. Hypothesis 9 was supported as there were significant
DEMO at both immediate time lags (Î²= 0.42, p < 0.01), and delayed time lags (Î²= 0.33, p
< 0.01). In DEMO, the regression coefficients from the multiple regression results for the
hypothesized DEMO is shown in figure 2 (immediate time lag) and figure 3 (delayed time
lag).
Post-hoc Model Modification and Overall Fit
Based on the significant regression coefficients found in figure 1, the overall fit of
a simplified model (figure 4) was assessed using path modeling (cf. Schneider, Ehrhart,
Mayer, Saltz, & Niles-Jolly, 2005). We DEMO the path model approach instead of the
traditional Baron and Kenny test of mediation (1986) since the initial variable CQ, and
the outcome variable, joint profit, were not significantly correlated. Establishing such a
bivariate DEMO between the initial variable and the outcome variable is the first
step in establishing mediation in Baron and Kennyâs (1986) approach. However, as
argued in Schneider et al. (2005), a number of scholars have questioned whether it is
necessary to provide evidence for the first step DEMO establish mediation (Collins, Graham,
& Flaherty, 1998; MacKinnon, DEMO; MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000; Shrout &
Bolger, DEMO), when the crucial steps are establishing the relationship between the initial
variable and the mediator, and the relationship between the mediator and outcome
variable (Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). Furthermore, MacKinnon, DEMO,
Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) argued that a simultaneous test of significance of the
path from an initial variable to a DEMO and the path from the mediator to an outcome
39
(i.e. path modeling), relative to other approaches (such as Baron DEMO Kennyâs test)
provides the best balance of type I error rates and statistical power.
In the post-hoc path model, including all control variables would have created too
large a model to test given the small DEMO size. Thus, it was necessary to first partial
the influences of DEMO covariates from all model variables. Recent simulation studies have
demonstrated the appropriateness of this practice, as structural coefficients were found to
be virtually equivalent, whether the researcher directly models the covariates, or employs
SEM using DEMO covariances (Fletcher, Germano, & Selgrade, 2006; Kammeyer-
Mueller & DEMO, 2003; Newcomb & Bentler, 1988). Partial covariances in this DEMO
were created by regressing the model indicators (CQ, immediate complementary
sequences of integrative information behaviors, and joint profit) onto all covariates (i.e.
travel experience, living experience, openness, extraversion, empathy, emotional
intelligence, DEMO cognitive ability) individually and then saving the residual covariances.
The simplified DEMO fit the data well (Ï2 [1] = 1.33, p = 0.25; CFI = 0.97; SRMR =
0.054; RMSEA = 0.073). Estimated path coefficients are found in figure 4. Thus, results
show that higher the CQ, dyads engage in more sequences of complementary integrative
information behaviors, which in turn leads to high joint profits.
Exploratory Analyses
CQ Facets
Do specific CQ facets predict strategic sequences? We conducted additional,
multiple regression analyses to address this issue, entering all four CQ facets and all
control variables into the regression equation. At immediate time lags, meta-cognitive
40
CQ increased reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î² = 0.42, DEMO <
0.05). For complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, motivational
CQ was found to drive the significant overall CQ effect (Î² = 0.42, p < 0.01).
Furthermore, behavioral CQ was found to DEMO reciprocity of cooperative relationship
management-focused behaviors (Î² = 0.36, p < 0.05). At delayed time lags, cognitive CQ
had a marginally significant, positive relationship with complementary sequences of
integrative information behaviors (Î² = DEMO, p < 0.10). There were no significant effects
between CQ DEMO and delayed reciprocal sequences of integrative information
behaviors, nor delayed cooperative DEMO of relationship management-focused
behaviors. Figure 5 presents overall significant results for CQ facets predicting strategic
sequences at the immediate time lag. Based on significant DEMO found in figure 5, we
assessed the overall fit of a DEMO SEM model including meta-cognitive CQ,
motivational CQ, behavioral CQ, immediate reciprocal sequences of integrative
information behaviors, immediate complementary sequences of integrative information
behaviors, immediate cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused
behaviors, joint profit, and relational capital. The simplified model fit the data well (Ï2
[17] = 13.74, p = 0.69; CFI = 1.00; SRMR = 0.08; DEMO = 0.00). Estimated path
coefficients are found in figure 6.
Dyad Composition
Does it take one or two negotiator(s) for CQ to be advantageous in increasing
sequences of reciprocal/ complementary integrative information behaviors as well as
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors? We first addressed this
issue by examining the relationship between the dyad minimum score on overall DEMO (i.e.
41
the lower of the two negotiatorsâ overall CQ score) and each type of behavioral sequence
at immediate and delayed time lags. For minimum overall DEMO, the pattern of results was
almost identical to those obtained with DEMO mean CQ. Minimum overall CQ did not
predict reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î²immediate= 0.16, p >
0.20; Î²delayed= 0.20, p > 0.15). However, it did have a significant positive relationship
with complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î²immediate= 0.32, p <
0.05; Î²delayed= 0.39, p = 0.01). Thus, this result suggests that the extent to which dyads
engage in complementary sequences of integrative behaviors DEMO only as good as its lowest
CQ negotiator.
Finally, minimum overall DEMO did not have a significant relationship with
cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused behaviors, although the
results became marginal (Î²immediate = 0.26, p < 0.10; Î²delayed = 0.27, p < 0.10). Next, we
examined the relationship between dyad maximum overall CQ and each type of
behavioral DEMO at immediate and delayed time lags. Maximum overall CQ did not
predict any of the strategic sequences at immediate (Î²identical = -0.05, p > 0.70;
Î²complementary= 0.15, p > 0.20; Î²cooperative = 0.07, DEMO > 0.60) nor delayed time lags (Î²identical =
0.07, p > 0.50; Î²complementary= 0.10, p > 0.50; Î²cooperative = 0.05, p > 0.70).

Chapter 4: Discussion
In this paper, we argued that there is DEMO fundamental paradox in the culture and
negotiation literature, where there is DEMO dearth of research addressing the question of what
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness, despite researchersâ long-time recognition
of the practical importance of this question. We proposed cultural intelligence as a
promising predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. More DEMO, we
postulated that dyads high in CQ are better equipped with DEMO cognitive, motivational,
and behavioral skills necessary in overcoming cultural barriers DEMO as clashing schemas
and metaphors, reduced persistence, and the deciphering and enacting of culturally non-
normative behaviors. As such, we argued that high CQ negotiators will be able to develop
a shared understanding of the DEMO as a cooperative problem-solving activity, as
reflected in their strategic sequencing DEMO integrative information behaviors as well as
cooperative relationship management behaviors, which DEMO turn predict negotiation
outcomes. Moreover, we expected CQ to predict strategic DEMO over and beyond
other related but distinct constructs including international experience, DEMO and
intelligence.
Overall CQ, Complementary Sequences of Integrative Behaviors, and Joint Profit
The results of an intercultural negotiation study between Americans and East
DEMO, where CQ and other individual differences were measured one week prior DEMO the
negotiation partially supported these notions. The most important finding was that
consistent with our theory, dyad-level CQ predicts immediate complementary sequences
of integrative behaviors, which in turn predicts joint profit. Moreover, CQ predicted
43
complementary sequences of integrative behaviors over and beyond international travel
and living DEMO, openness, extraversion, empathy, emotional intelligence, and
cognitive ability.
This DEMO finding simultaneously makes contributions to several streams in the
broader literature. First, it adds to the culture and negotiation literature by showing that
CQ is a key predictor of the extent to which intercultural negotiators exchange
DEMO in their search for integrative agreement. Thus, in response to Krayâs (2005)
earlier suggestion that ânegotiation scholars might consider expanding beyond simple
DEMO of [cultural] differencesâ¦and explore whether awareness of these
differences makes a differenceâ (p.159) in influencing the effectiveness of intercultural
negotiations, we show with CQ that it does indeed make a difference. As such, our study
begins to address the question of what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness,
DEMO so far has remained a black box in the culture and negotiation literature.
Second, this study provides additional evidence for the predictive validity of CQ,
specifically in a negotiation context. The CQ literature thus far DEMO focused mainly on the
usefulness of CQ predicting outcomes such as adjustment and business performance in
expatriate management contexts involving samples of expatriates, foreign professionals,
and international executives. In our study, we show that CQ is also advantageous for
intercultural negotiation, which involves complex decision-making between two parties
who both attempt to resolve perceived incompatible goals. Furthermore, by showing that
CQ predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness over and beyond other individual
difference DEMO such as international experience, personality, and other types of
intelligence, DEMO add further validity to Earley and Angâs (2003) CQ construct.
44
Third, we also make a contribution to the negotiation literature by furthering our
understanding of the negotiation process which there is little understanding of DEMO the U.S.
literature and even more so in the cross-cultural literature. By directly examining the
negotiation process of strategic sequencing of integrative behaviors, we provide an in-
depth, dynamic view of how such a communication pattern mediates the effect of a
previously unexamined negotiation input, CQ, on DEMO profit, the negotiation outcome.
Facet-level CQ, Strategic Sequences, and Outcomes
DEMO exploratory analyses also revealed that a different facet of CQ predicts each
of the three negotiation sequences. First, dyads high in motivational CQ engaged in more
immediate complementary sequences of integrative behaviors. Although it is reasonable
DEMO expect that all of the CQ facets would predict complementary sequences based on our
previous theorizing, it may be that motivational CQ has the strongest predictive power
because having the underlying motivation in the first place DEMO interacting with people
from different cultures is more fundamental to cultural adjustment than the adaptive
thoughts and behaviors that may consequently follow from having DEMO motivational CQ.
Interestingly, this finding parallels U.S. research on self-efficacy and DEMO, which
found that having the confidence and anticipation of successful performance DEMO
integrative bargaining buffer negotiators from negative effects of impasse. For example,
self-efficacious negotiators were less likely to experience negative emotions and
perceptions of DEMO counterparts as not being interested in reaching mutually
beneficial outcomes, which DEMO the way to more open information exchange
(OâConnor & Arnold, 2001). Similarly, our finding illustrates that self-efficacy
specifically for cross-cultural encounters, DEMO key to developing and maintaining
45
sequences of information exchange behaviors in an intercultural context where cultural
barriers DEMO likely pose stress and frustration upon negotiators.
Second, we also found DEMO dyads high in behavioral CQ engaged in more
immediate cooperative sequences of non-task-focused relationship management
behaviors, which in turn led to relational capital. This finding is comparable to recent
findings on non-conscious mimicry, or the automatic matching of verbal and non-verbal
behaviors between interaction partners. Research has shown DEMO the conscious goal of
getting along with another increases mimicry (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003), and that
mimicry in turn acts as a DEMO glueâ in binding people together and creating
harmonious relationships (Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003). Indeed, there is
evidence that DEMO increases cooperative behavior (e.g. prosocial helping) and
enhances liking and rapport (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg,
2004). DEMO finding on behavioral CQ can be interpreted similarly, in that in DEMO
contexts, negotiators with high behavioral CQ focus their conscious efforts on DEMO to
the other party and can better mimic their verbal and non-verbal behaviors (e.g. use of
tone, pause, silence, facial expressions, rates of speaking) because of their wider
repertoire of culturally non-normative behaviors. As such, negotiators with high
behavioral CQ seemed to have developed greater rapport with their counterparts as
indicated by their sequencing of relationship management behaviors, which in turn, led to
high relational capital.
There were also several unexpected findings in our study. First, although it is
reasonable to expect motivational CQ to also predict sequences of cooperative
relationship management behaviors, and behavioral CQ to also predict complementary
46
sequences of integrative behaviors, there were no such significant relationships. Second,
motivational CQ, which had a positive relationship with complementary integrative
sequences as mentioned above, did not have a significant relationship with reciprocal
integrative sequences. One can only speculate as to why such is the case. It DEMO be that
because of low statistical power due to our small sample size, relationships that actually
exist are not being detected. Furthermore, regarding DEMO absence of relationship between
motivational CQ and reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors in particular, it is
possible that with reciprocal sequences, the negotiation DEMO is being represented at
too fine a detail, as matching of DEMO were counted at the negotiation tactical level.
In contrast, for complementary DEMO, matching of behaviors was counted at the
strategic level; that is, even if two different tactics occurred in sequence, they were
counted DEMO a complementary sequence as long as they belonged to the same strategic
cluster of integrative information behaviors. Thus, the looser structure of complementary
sequences may be representing more of a theoretically meaningful construct of
integrative sequences DEMO reciprocal sequences. Based on this interpretation, although
there was an additional DEMO relationship between a specific CQ facet, meta-
cognitive CQ, and reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors, we remain cautious in
making theoretical interpretations of this particular relationship. In order to clarify
relationships among specific facets of DEMO and strategic sequences, future research is
needed where these relationships are DEMO with larger sample sizes, with strategic
sequences being measured at varying DEMO of abstraction.
Finally, while we hypothesized that sequences of integrative behaviors DEMO lead
to both joint profit and relational capital, and that sequences DEMO relationship management
47
behaviors would also lead to both joint profit and relational capital, we did not find such
a pattern. We found that sequences of integrative DEMO only predicted joint profit,
whereas sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors only predicted
relational capital. This finding attests to the recent arguments raised DEMO researchers on the
importance of distinguishing objective and subjective negotiation criteria. Developing
and maintaining a shared understanding of the negotiation as a cooperative problem-
DEMO activity where negotiators exchange information does not necessarily guarantee a
very high quality relationship consisting of mutual liking, trust, understanding, and
commitment to a future relationship in intercultural contexts. In parallel, developing and
maintaining sequences of non-task-focused miscellaneous comments that maintain a
cooperative relationship does not necessarily DEMO to obtaining high joint profit.
Dyad Composition
In terms of dyad composition, the pattern of significant results for dyad
mean CQ and dyad minimum CQ (at the overall level) predicting strategic sequences at
both immediate DEMO delayed time lags looked almost identical, whereas dyad maximum
CQ did DEMO have any significant associations with any of the sequences. The results
suggest that the negotiator with the lower CQ level has more of an DEMO on the extent to
which the dyad engages in complementary sequences of integrative behaviors than the
negotiator with the higher CQ level. This makes DEMO given the conjunctive nature of the
task (Steiner, 1972); that is, sequencing integrative behaviors is a joint task that requires
the contributions of both negotiators. Thus, the dyad-level performance can only be as
good as its âweakest linkâ; even if one negotiator within the dyad has high CQ and tries
to adopt an integrative strategy with the goal DEMO becoming synchronized with the other, if
48
the other negotiator does not reciprocate integrative behaviors, overall, the dyad DEMO
suffers as a result. In sum, it is not enough to DEMO have one high CQ negotiator, the ability
level of the low DEMO negotiator influences the extent to which the dyad engages in
integrative sequencing.
Practical Implications
The practical implication of our research is that CQ is DEMO key predictor of
intercultural negotiation effectiveness on which individuals can be selected and/ or
trained. Given that negotiation is a ubiquitous pattern of social interaction, and that
globalization is increasingly infiltrating many parts of the world, it is likely that the
selection and training of CQ will be advantageous for intercultural negotiations not only
organizational contexts (e.g. inter-organizational relations, DEMO
relations, industrial relations), but also in other areas such as DEMO relations (Pruitt
& Carnevale, 1993). For example, Triandis (1994) anecdotally argued that in the early
1990s just before the Gulf War, one of the problems in the intercultural negotiations
between former secretary of state James Baker and former foreign minister of Iraq, Tariq
Aziz, DEMO that Bakerâs emotional style of being calm and not raising his voice was
misattributed by Aziz to mean that Americans were not serious about DEMO military force
in Iraq. Thus, even in political arena among diplomats, it stands to reason that training
CQ would lead to better intercultural DEMO outcomes.
Specifically in organizational contexts, managers can rely on a number DEMO ways to
assess overall CQ for selection or training, in addition DEMO self-report measures (Earley &
Ang, 2003). For example, direct observations of intercultural negotiators allow assessors
to gather information on individualsâ CQ DEMO observing good and problematic behaviors
49
as they occur in real-time. Furthermore, by using cultural assimilators, assessors DEMO
present problematic intercultural negotiations between actors and have participants make
correct attributions and interpretations of the actorsâ behaviors. In addition to overall CQ,
DEMO can also train specific facets of CQ as it applies to intercultural negotiations.
For example, meta-cognitive CQ can be increased through cognitive behavior
modification, a technique that raises conscious awareness of oneâs automaticity of
thoughts and behaviors (CBM; Mahoney, 1974; Meichenbaum, 1974), motivational CQ
can be increased through goal-setting (Locke & Latham, 1990), cognitive CQ DEMO be
increased by reading about other cultures or talking to past negotiators with intercultural
experience, and finally, behavioral CQ can be acquired through DEMO change
principles such as identifying antecedents and consequences of oneâs own culture-
specific negotiation behaviors (Westmacott & Cameron, 1981).
Limitations and Future DEMO
All research methods have limitations (McGrath, Martin, & Kulka, 1982), and
this study is no exception. We studied one sample, students, with one methodology, lab-
based negotiation simulation. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise caution in applying
our results. However, we are hopeful that our findings will generalize to intercultural
negotiators in organizational and even political DEMO for two reasons. First, the
majority of our students consisted of DEMO graduate students who most likely can relate to
real-world experiences such as negotiation. Second, given that culture has been found to
pervasively influence behavior in a wide variety of settings (Markus, Kitayama, &
Heiman, 1997), it stands to reason that the extent to which individuals DEMO intelligent
about culture and its impact on behavior should also be consistent across diverse
50
intercultural settings. In addition, while we are optimistic about our results, DEMO used a
self-report measure of CQ given the methodological infancy of the construct. However,
given the label of âcultural intelligenceâ and the conceptualization DEMO the construct as an
ability, we realize the necessity for future DEMO to measure CQ with other, more
objective methods to provide converging DEMO for the predictive power of CQ on
intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Finally, DEMO study had low statistical power due to
a small sample size. Nonetheless, we found some significant effects despite a
conservative test; therefore, we expect even stronger results should future research
replicate our study with larger DEMO sizes.
There are several fruitful avenues for future research. It would be interesting to
move beyond the negotiation process of strategic sequencing which focuses DEMO
negotiatorsâ shared understanding of the task at a more micro level, DEMO negotiation phases,
which examines intercultural negotiatorsâ synchronization of behaviors at a more
aggregate level. Using a technique called phase mapping (Poole, 1983; Poole & Roth,
1989), researchers can identify what kind of DEMO emerge specifically in intercultural
contexts, and how they differ between high DEMO and low CQ dyads. For example, high
CQ negotiators may be DEMO to develop and transition through clearly demarcated,
functional negotiation phases at a steady pace as they become highly synchronized with
each other and DEMO towards resolution, whereas low CQ negotiators may remain
disorganized and disintegrated DEMO the negotiation, leading eventually to
suboptimal outcomes.
Furthermore, it would be fascinating to examine the âdark sideâ of CQ. That is,
the DEMO of the negotiation in this study specifically focused on integrative deal-
51
making where negotiators cultivate relationships in order to reach agreement. In contrast,DEMO
negotiations can also take place in more competitive contexts such as disputing in which
negotiatorsâ relationships are dissolving from rejected claims and negative emotions
(Gelfand, Brett, Imai, Tsai, & Huang, 2006). Thus, DEMO would be interesting to see how CQ
manifests itself in such non-cooperative contexts. For example, do high CQ individuals
take advantage of their extensive cultural knowledge and behavioral flexibility to try to
deceive low CQ individuals? Or, does CQ always entail a cooperative, global-minded
value system which DEMO then suggest that CQ is a liability in competitive contexts?
Additionally, future research can integrate CQ with the negotiation literature on
cognitive biases. In our study, we did not directly examine how CQ may influence
negotiatorsâ underlying psychological mechanisms. Yet, given that high CQ individuals
should be able to question their own cultural assumptions, it would not be surprising if
CQ buffers negotiators from culture-specific cognitive biases (e.g. fixed-pie bias,
fundamental attribution error, self-serving assessments of fairness) that are prevalent in
DEMO, individualistic cultures such as the U.S (see Gelfand & Dyer, DEMO for
review). It would be useful to examine if intercultural negotiatorsâ mutual reduction in
such culture-specific cognitive biases mediate the relationship between CQ DEMO
synchronization of behaviors.
Finally, the vast majority of intercultural negotiation studies DEMO focused on
interactions between Americans and East Asians, and this study DEMO no exception. Future
research should move beyond examining Pacific Rim cultures to see if the positive
effects of CQ on intercultural negotiation effectiveness generalize DEMO U.S. negotiations
with other cultures as well. For example, despite the DEMO of current U.S. foreign affairs,
52
there are virtually no negotiation studies involving Middle Eastern cultures. Given that
DEMO are large cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East on a wide
variety of value dimensions (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman & Gupta, 2004), it is
likely that there are many sources DEMO cultural barriers that must be overcome in U.S.â
Middle Eastern intercultural negotiations.
Conclusion
This research expands the dominant paradigm in the culture and negotiation
DEMO by moving beyond cross-cultural comparisons of negotiation behaviors to
directly examining negotiation behaviors as they occur in intercultural contexts. This
study illustrates that CQ DEMO a key predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness, as
dyads high in DEMO were found to engage in more strategic sequencing of integrative
behaviors, DEMO in turn led to high joint outcomes. Practically speaking, managers
should DEMO and/or train CQ in individuals to maximize the chances of optimal
agreements in intercultural negotiations. Future research, such as examining the effects of
CQ on broader negotiation processes such as phases, the role of CQ in competitive
contexts such as disputing, and the effects of CQ on psychological mechanisms such as
cognitive biases, would help build a more comprehensive theory of cultural intelligence
and intercultural negotiations.

Footnotes
1 Because sequences of behavior across the two negotiators were of DEMO interest in this study,
when multiple codes at the thought-unit level occurred within a negotiatorâs speaking turn, it was necessary
to eliminate less substantial behaviors and assign one dominant code at the speaking-turn level. In DEMO to
achieve a certain level of objectivity in deciding what code was dominant in the speaking turn, the first and
second authors went through a number of transcripts to achieve collective agreement on a dominance
scheme, similar to one used in previous research (Weingart, Bennett, Brett, DEMO; Weingart, Prietula, &
Hyder 1999). Multi-issue offers were considered more dominant than substantiations that followed,
statements about issue preferences were DEMO more substantial than substantiations that followed, and
neutral miscellaneous statements were DEMO less substantial than all other codes.
2 For cognitive ability, preliminary DEMO at the individual level indicated that East Asians
scored significantly lower than Americans (M East Asian = 24.67, sd = 4.57; M American = 31.49, SD = 4.75; t
(128) = -8.35, p < 0.01), most likely because the Wonderlic requires knowledge of difficult DEMO
proverbs and idioms. To deal with this issue, raw scores were DEMO into Z scores within each
cultural group to determine oneâs relative standing in cognitive ability within his or her racial group. Z
scores were DEMO aggregated to the dyad level.
