SUMMARY
Recent work has shown that there may be disadvantages DEMO the use of the chi-square-like goodness-of-ﬁt
tests for the logistic regression model proposed by Hosmer and Lemeshow that use ﬁxed groups of the
estimated DEMO A particular concern with these grouping strategies based on estimated probabilit-
ies, ﬁtted values, is that groups may contain subjects with widely diﬀerent DEMO of the covariates. It is
possible to demonstrate situations where one set of ﬁxed groups shows the model ﬁts while the test rejects ﬁt
DEMO a diﬀerent set of ﬁxed groups. We compare the performance by simulation of these tests to tests based
on smoothed residuals proposed by le DEMO and Van Houwelingen and Royston, a score test for an
extended DEMO regression model proposed by Stukel, the Pearson chi-square and the unweighted DEMO
sum-of- squares. These simulations demonstrate that all but one of Royston’s tests have the correct size. An
examination of the performance of the tests DEMO the correct model has a quadratic term but a model
containing only the linear term has been ﬁt shows that the Pearson chi-square, the unweighted sum-of-
squares, the Hosmer—Lemeshow decile of risk, the smoothed residual DEMO and Stukel’s score test,
have power exceeding 50 per cent to detect moderate departures from linearity when the sample size is 100
and DEMO power over 90 per cent for these same alternatives for samples of size 500. All tests had no power
when the correct model had DEMO interaction between a dichotomous and continuous covariate but only the
continuous covariate model was ﬁt. Power to detect an incorrectly speciﬁed link was poor DEMO samples of size
100. For samples of size 500 Stukel’s score test had the best power but it only exceeded 50 per cent to DEMO
an asymmetric link function. The power of the unweighted sum-of-squares test to detect an incorrectly
speciﬁed link function was slightly less than Stukel’s score DEMO We illustrate the tests within the context of
a model for factors associated with low birth weight. ( 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Stat. Med., Vol. 16,

INTRODUCTION
The logistic regression model has become a widely used and accepted DEMO of analysis of

increase in application has been an increase in statistical research on the model. One area of
current research DEMO the development of new methods to assess the adequacy of the ﬁtted model.
The need for this research has been motivated by limitations of DEMO available methods.
AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEMS IN ASSESSING OVERALL GOODNESS-OF-FIT
To illustrate some of the problems with currently available methods of assessing overall DEMO
ness-of-ﬁt1 we present the results of the ﬁt of a model using the low birth weight data in Appendix
I of Hosmer and Lemeshow.2 DEMO data were collected at Baystate Medical Center in Spring-
ﬁeld, Massachusetts, in 1986. The outcome variable was whether or not birth weight was DEMO than
2500 grams. Data were collected on 189 births of which 59 were low birth weight and 130 were
normal birth weight. The purpose DEMO this example is to illustrate problems with assessing model ﬁt
rather than to provide a deﬁnitive analysis of these data. The independent variables used DEMO this
example are age of the mother (AGE), weight of DEMO mother at the last menstrual period (LWT),
race of the mother, (white, black, or other, coded into two design variables using white race as the
referent group (RACE—1, RACE—2)) and DEMO or not the mother smoked, 1"yes, 0"no,
(DEMO)). To avoid diﬀerences between packages when ties are present in DEMO estimated
probabilities we added the value of an independent U(0, DEMO) variate to each AGE and LWT. The
ﬁtted model using the DEMO data agreed to three decimal places with the ‘unjittered’ data.
Table I shows the results of ﬁtting this logistic regression model, while Table II shows measures of
overall goodness-of-ﬁt obtained from six packages.
The ﬁtted model DEMO in Table I contains variables known to be important risk factors for
low birth weight. Mother’s age, although not signiﬁcant, was retained in DEMO model because of its
known biologic signiﬁcance. All six packages mentioned in Table II obtained the same estimated
coeﬃcients and estimated standard errors.
The DEMO for the goodness-of-ﬁt statistics presented in Table II highlight current problems
in trying to interpret summary tests of goodness-of-ﬁt from packaged programs. First, the p-value
for the Pearson chi-square statistic is, in this case, meaningless, as it is based on a contingency
table whose expected cell frequencies DEMO too small (all are less than one) to justify use of
a chi-square distribution with 183 degrees-of-freedom. The statistic itself is a good DEMO of
model adequacy; the problem with its current application lies in DEMO way packages compute its
p-value. We consider an alternative and easily implemented method that gives a correct p-value.
Second, we obtain six diﬀerent values of the Hosmer—Lemeshow goodness-of-ﬁt statistic based on
grouping subjects into deciles of DEMO Four packages produce a statistic with a p-value '0·1, one
with 0·05(p-value(0·1 and one with a p-value(0·05. The problem is DEMO the packages use

statistic seems sensitive to choice of groups. All packages produce DEMO same ﬁtted model.
However, depending on our choice of level of DEMO and particular package used, we might
reach diﬀerent conclusions on overall DEMO ﬁt.
CURRENTLY USED SUMMARY MEASURES OF FIT
The addition of goodness-of-ﬁt tests and logistic regression diagnostic statistics to statistical
software packages has made the DEMO diﬃcult task of using these methods to assess the adequacy
of a ﬁtted logistic regression model a routine step in the model building process. DEMO analysis
should incorporate a thorough examination of logistic regression diagnostics, see DEMO and
Lemeshow,2 Chapter 5, before reaching a ﬁnal decision on DEMO adequacy. We do not wish to
understate the importance of the use of these statistics, but the focus of this paper is on overall
goodness-of-ﬁt tests.
We begin by setting the notation used to describe the DEMO Assume we are in the strictly
binary case and observe n independent pairs (xi, yi), i"1, 2 , n, where DEMO"(x i, x i, 2 , xpi),
x "DEMO, denotes a vector of p#1 assumed ﬁxed covariates for the ith DEMO and y "0, 1 denotes
0i i
an observation of the outcome random variable ½ . Under the logistic regression model we

assume that P(½i"1 D xi)"n(xi), where n(xi)"eg(xi) )), and g(xi)"DEMO Parameter
estimates are usually obtained by maximum likelihood and are denoted by b@"(b0, b1, 2 , bp).
We denote the ﬁtted values as ni"n(xi, b).
Examining a model’s goodness-of-ﬁt involves determining whether the ﬁtted model’s residual
variation is small, displays no systematic tendency and follows the variability postulated by the
model. Evidence of lack-of-ﬁt DEMO come from a violation of one or more of these three
characteristics. Thus, in the context of a logistic regression model, the essential DEMO of ﬁt
are speciﬁed by the following assumptions:
(A1) the logit transformation is the correct function linking the covariates with the conditional
DEMO, logit[n(x)]"x@b;
(A2) the linear predictor, x@b, is correct (we do not need to include additional variables,
DEMO of variables, or interactions of variables);
(A3) the variance is Bernoulli, var(½i D xi)"n(xi)[1!n(xi)].
DEMO of model ﬁt may occur at a number of stages in the modelling process. We may use
it as an aid in model development DEMO our goal is to ﬁnd violations primarily in (A2) and/or to

the case of a logistic regression model we are faced with the practical problem that assumptions
(A1)—(A3) are not mutually exclusive. DEMO, assumption (A3) may be confounded with (A1)
and/or (A2). If we violate (A2) and misspecify the linear predictor then the model-based estimate
of the variance is also incorrect. Similarly, if we have the incorrect link function, with or without
linear predictor misspeciﬁcation, then the model-based estimate of the variance is also incorrect.
A useful conceptual framework for thinking about assessment of model ﬁt is to consider DEMO
data as described by a 2]n contingency table. The two rows are deﬁned by the values of the
dichotomous outcome variable y and the DEMO columns by the assumed number of possible distinct
values taken on by the p non-constant covariates in the model. The replicated design occurs when
DEMO are fewer than n distinct values (patterns) of the covariates. The likelihood ratio D (deviance)

ﬁtted logistic regression model DEMO the 2]n table are

Evidence for model lack-of-ﬁt occurs when the values of these statistics are large. Towards DEMO
end, many packages provide a p-value computed using the s2(n!p!1) distribution. For the
situation considered in this paper, the strictly binary case, this p-value has no value. For the
p-value to be a valid measure of model ﬁt the number of columns in the table must DEMO ﬁxed and
the sample size large enough that the estimated expected values in the table all exceed some
minimum number such as ﬁve. Hosmer DEMO Lemeshow2 (Chapter 5) discuss two methods of
grouping based on the ranked estimated logistic probabilities that form groups of equal numbers
of subjects DEMO use ﬁxed cutpoints on the [0, 1] interval. The statistic, based on 10 equal sized
groups (called ‘deciles of risk’), is denoted C, and is currently computed in most statistical
packages. We denote in this paper the statistic based on ﬁxed cutpoints as H which is DEMO in
few packages. Hosmer and Lemeshow1 showed, via simulations, that when the logistic regression
model is correct, assumptions (A1)—(A3) hold, and the estimated expected values are ‘large’ in all
cells, the DEMO of both C and H for g groups are well approximated by the chi-square
distribution with g!2 degrees-of-freedom, s2(g!2).
SMOOTHED RESIDUAL BASED TESTS
The advantage of the Hosmer—Lemeshow type tests is that they are DEMO on groupings of the
estimated probabilities that are intuitively appealing and easily understood by subject matter
scientists. The disadvantage is that the value of DEMO statistic depends on the choice of cutpoints
that deﬁne the groups. In addition, they may have low power for detecting certain types of
lack-of-ﬁt. le Cessie and van Houwelingen3,4 note that because the Hosmer—Lemeshow tests DEMO
based on a grouping strategy in the ‘y’ space they lack power to detect departures from the model
in regions of the ‘x’ space DEMO yield the same estimated probabilities. For example, a model with
a DEMO term may have widely diﬀerent ‘x’ values with the same estimated probability.
Tsiatis5 proposed an approach based on ﬁxed groups in the ‘x’ space DEMO yields a score test for
ﬁt. One can use this approach with models that contain quadratic terms or periodic functions
since one can form DEMO to circumvent the diﬃculties noted by le Cessie and van Houwelin-
gen.3,4 However, by choosing ﬁxed groups, the decision about whether or DEMO the model ﬁts still
may depend on the particular choice of groups. le Cessie and van Houwelingen address these
problems by proposing a class DEMO tests based on smoothed residuals.

GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS FOR THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL
The motivation for the use DEMO smoothed residuals comes from work on non-parametric
regression. Copas6 and Azzalini et al.7 have used the idea of smoothing the values of the outcome
DEMO to obtain a non-parametric estimate of the regression function. Copas uses the estimate
mainly for plotting the observed outcome and the smoothed outcome versus DEMO variables
while Azzalini et al. use it to develop a pseudo-likelihood ratio test. Their basic idea is to compare
a ‘smoothed’ value of the DEMO variable for each subject (which is a weighted average of the DEMO
values for other subjects ’near’ the subject) to a similarly smoothed DEMO of the logistic
probabilities. We can deﬁne the idea of ‘nearness’ in terms of a distance measure in the ‘x’ space as
suggested by DEMO Cessie and van Houwelingen, or it can be in the ‘y’ DEMO
In this paper we consider weight functions deﬁned using the uniform kernel for the ‘x’ space, as
used by le Cessie and van Houwelingen, and a cubic weight in the ‘y’ space. The advantage of the
cubic weight is that it is available as a smoothing option in DEMO number of packages, thus lending
itself readily to plotting.

OTHER DEMO TESTS OF GOODNESS-OF-FIT
Royston9,10 proposed two procedures designed to detect departure from linearity in the logit that
use partial sums of residuals. Royston DEMO not speciﬁcally advocate the use of these tests for
overall assessment of goodness-of-ﬁt. However, since the tests are designed to be sensitive to
departures in monotonicity in the logit or to detect a quadratic logit, then it seemed worthwhile to
include them in the present study. The ﬁrst DEMO statistic is PR "max ) ) D q D where

a quadratic departure in the model. Royston2 provides easily computed transformations of the
two test statistics that allow calculation DEMO p-values from the standard normal distribution. Both
tests are a special case of the test discussed in Beran and Miller.11
In the case of DEMO single covariate the Royston monotone test is identical to a test proposed by Su
and Wei.12 Su and Wei proposed using a computationally intensive DEMO to calculate the
p-value. The computations for a model based on a sample of size n containing p main eﬀect terms

estimate signiﬁcance at the 5 per cent DEMO to within 2 per cent with 95 per cent conﬁdence. In
preliminary simulations the performance of the Su and Wei method of obtaining the DEMO was
superior to Royston’s analytic approach for models containing a single covariate. However, the
overall performance, size and power, of the Su and Wei test was neither better nor worse than the
other much less DEMO intensive tests. Thus the Su and Wei test was not included in
the detailed simulation study whose results are presented in this paper.
A DEMO logistic model proposed by Stukel13 provides a convenient model amenable to
testing the adequacy of the ﬁtted logistic model. The Stukel model uses a DEMO function with two
additional parameters a1 and a2. These two parameters allow the generalized logistic model to be
either symmetric or asymmetric with tails DEMO lighter or heavier than is the case with the logistic
model. The usual linear logistic model results when a1"0 and a2"0. A DEMO degree-of-freedom
test of the hypothesis that both parameters are equal to zero is obtained from the score test for the
coeﬃcients for the variables DEMO "1 g2I(g*0) and z "
!1 g2I(g(0), g"x@b, where I( · ) is the

indicator function returning the value one when the argument is true DEMO zero otherwise. We
denote this test statistic S¹.
Brown14 developed a diﬀerent two-parameter score test based on an extended logistic regres-
sion model proposed DEMO Prentice.15 A comparison of the Prentice model to the generalized
logistic model by Stukel13 showed that both oﬀer the same level of ﬂexibility in DEMO of
generating alternative models but that Stukel’s generalized logistic model is analytically easier to
use since it does not require the integration needed with DEMO Prentice model. Stukel13 provides the
expressions for the variables needed to carry out Brown’s score test. We note that the Brown test
is computed DEMO program BMDPLR, but is not included in our simulations since the DEMO is aimed
at the same type of model departure as the Stukel test.
Copas16 has suggested using the unweighted residual sum-of-squares, S"+ (DEMO)2,to
assess the model’s adequacy. It is also a special case of the class of statistics considered by le Cessie
and van Houwelingen4 DEMO we also consider this test statistic in the simulations.
SIMULATION RESULTS
We used simulations to study the properties of the overall goodness-of-ﬁt tests. The DEMO was to
assess the adequacy of the proposed null distribution of the statistics when the ﬁtted logistic
model was the correct model and to DEMO the power of the tests to detect a variety of departures
from the logistic model.
Statistics used in the simulations are: the Pearson chi-square statistic, X2; the unweighted
sum-of-squares statistic, S; the smoothed standardized DEMO test with weight functions
based on a uniform kernel smooth, ¹ru; and the cubic distance smooth, ¹rc. In preliminary
simulations the performance of the smoothed standardized residual based test and a similar
statistic based on DEMO unstandardized residuals were comparable so we chose to use the
standardized residual based test so that the results are more comparable to those in DEMO Cessie and
van Houwelingen.3 Details on calculation of the estimated means, DEMO and the approach
used to calculate the p-values for these four tests appear in the Appendix. Other statistics
examined are the Hosmer—Lemeshow decile of DEMO statistic, C, with 10 groups, and the Hos-
mer—Lemeshow ﬁxed DEMO statistic, H, with up to 10 groups (Note: In some situations we used
fewer than 10 groups when no estimated probabilities fell DEMO certain intervals.) In all cases the
degree-of-freedom was the number of DEMO minus two. We also included the two tests proposed
by Royston, DEMO and PR2, and the score test, S¹, based on Stukel’s DEMO logistic regression
model. We performed all simulations on a DEC Alpha 2000 computer running the OSF
operating system using a FORTRAN 5 program.

We considered a number of diﬀerent situations to examine the performance of the tests when the
logistic model ﬁt DEMO the correct model. We chose the various distributions of the covariate to
produce distributions of probabilities in the (0, 1) interval that one might encounter in practice.
Table III describes the situations where the distribution DEMO the covariate(s) is given, along with the
true coeﬃcients for the logistic model and expected values for the smallest, largest, and DEMO
quartiles for the resulting distribution of logistic probabilities for a sample of size 100 (that is,
considering the distribution of n(x) DEMO a transformation of the distribution of x). The Uniform
distribution on the (!6, 6) interval U (!6, 6), produces a symmetric distribution with mostly
small or large probabilities, while the U(!1, 1) produces probabilities mostly in centre of the
(0, 1) interval. A highly skewed right distribution results (mostly small but a few large probabilit-
ies), when the covariate has the s2(4) distribution. Other choices for the distribution produce
a more uniform distribution of probabilities.
DEMO all simulations we ﬁrst generated a sample of size n"100 or 500 values of the covariate(s)
and then we generated the DEMO variable by comparing an independently generated U(0, 1)
variate, u, to the true logistic probability using the rule y"1if u)n(x) and y"0 otherwise. In all
situations we used 500 replications. Table IV shows the per cent of time each of the DEMO
rejected the hypothesis of ﬁt at the a"0·05 level.
The results in Table IV indicate that in all but a few situations eight DEMO the nine statistics reject
at, or nearly at, the ﬁve per cent level when we used a"0·05.
The Royston monotone test never DEMO the hypothesis. These results suggest the need for
further work on the analytical method proposed by Royston for calculating p-values.
We also see in DEMO IV that the cubic smoothed standardized residual statistic with a three
variable model rejects too often. The reason for this is that the approximate DEMO estimator in
(A4) underestimates the true sampling variance. This estimator also slightly overestimated the
variance of the uniform kernel smooth in two of DEMO multivariable situations leading to fewer
rejections than expected.
Power
We examined the power of the tests of ﬁt to detect three particular types of DEMO from the
logistic model. The situations studied were the omission of a quadratic term in a continuous

a continuous variable and an incorrectly speciﬁed link function. In all situations studied the
distribution of the continuous covariate, x, was U(!3, 3). The distribution of the dichotomous
DEMO, d, was Bernoulli (1/2) and was independent of the continuous covariate.
We used ﬁve diﬀerent models to evaluate power with omission DEMO a quadratic term from
the model. We generated the outcome variable using a logistic model with logit
g(x)"b #b x#b x2 where we chose the values of the three coeﬃcients such that
n(!1·5)"0 0·05,1 n(3)"2 0·95 and n !3)"J DEMO J"0·01, 0·05, 0·1, 0·2 and 0·4. This generated
models DEMO the lack of linearity in the logit function became progressively more pronounced.
We used four diﬀerent interaction models to study the power with omission DEMO a dichotomous
variable and its interaction term from the model. We generated the outcome variable from
a model with logit g(x, d)"DEMO d#b xd. We chose the four parameters such that
n(!3, DEMO)"0·1, n !3, 1)"0·1, n(3, 0)"DEMO and2 n3(3, 1)"0·2#I where I"0·1, 0·3, 0·5 and 0·7.
Thus the four models display progressively more interaction.
We examined DEMO diﬀerent models to assess the power to detect an incorrectly speciﬁed link
function. We generated the values of the outcome variable from Stukel’s generalized DEMO
model using the function g(x)"0·8x as the linear predictor DEMO values of the parameters a and
a as speciﬁed in Table V. Stukel13 noted that if a "a "0·165, then the resulting generalized1

logistic model has nearly the same shape as the DEMO model and when a1"0·62 and
a "!0·037 has the same DEMO as the complimentary log-log model. We chose the remaining
2
three situations to yield one model with both tails longer, one model with both tails shorter tails
and an asymmetric model with one tail longer and DEMO tail shorter than the logistic model.
The situations we used to examine the power of the tests were chosen to represent typical
logistic regression DEMO encountered in practice. We felt this approach was preferable to
selecting biologically implausible parameter conﬁgurations where the tests would likely have high
power for DEMO sample size. The combination of two sample sizes, 100 and 500, and the various
models examined yields results which provide an adequate picture DEMO what types of departures
from a linear logistic model the various tests can detect with moderate to high power.
Table VI shows the per DEMO of time each of the tests rejected the hypothesis of ﬁt at the a"0·05
level.
In Table VI(a) we see that the power is, as expected, poor when trying to detect models that DEMO
quite close to the logistic. As the departure from linearity in the logit increases, the power
increases rapidly for all tests except the Royston monotone test. High power is attained for
samples of size 100 in DEMO situations where there are substantial diﬀerences over the entire [0, 1]
DEMO between the true quadratic model and the ﬁtted linear model. The power is near 90 per
cent for samples of size 500 for even DEMO, J"0·05, departures from the linear logistic model.
The results in Table VI(b) show that all tests have low power for samples of size 100 and 500
to detect even a fairly extreme interaction. DEMO performed additional simulations, whose

results are not shown, using the U(!6, 6) distribution for the continuous covariate that DEMO
power in the 40 per cent range when I"0·7 for samples of size 100. The reason for the increase
in power is the DEMO(!6, 6) distribution places proportionally more of the estimated probabilities
in the upper tail where there is the greatest diﬀerence between the model DEMO and the correct
model.
The power to detect an alternative link function is poor for sample size 100 for all tests when
the correct DEMO is similar to the logistic model and it is less than about 40 per cent for sample
size 500. This is not too surprising DEMO the diﬀerences between the alternative links, probit and
complementary log-log, and the logistic occur primarily in the tails which contain a small
proportion DEMO the estimated probabilities. The power of the Stukel score test is highest among all
tests considered, but is, at best, only moderate even for sample size 500 and the asymmetric model
that diﬀers from the DEMO over much of the [0, 1] interval.
The short tails models DEMO sample size 100 presents an interesting situation. When both a1
and a2 are large and positive in the Stukel model, the probability function becomes quite
steep and the ﬁtted values tend to be either small or DEMO When this occurs, the test statistics,
X2 and S-trace(V), approach zero. However their estimated variances become quite large
due to the range in the n’s and thus in c and d (see Appendix). The normalized goodness-of-ﬁt
tests tend to be not signiﬁcant since the DEMO is small and the estimated variance is
large. For example, the DEMO of the Pearson chi-square statistic in Table VI(c) is less DEMO
the nominal alpha level when a1"a2"1. Although not shown, DEMO is a diﬀerential eﬀect
of the shape of the link on the Pearson chi-square and unweighted sum-of-squares statistic.
However, as the two parameters, DEMO and a2, become suﬃciently large, both tests degenerate. With
a sample of size 500 there are a suﬃcient number of estimated probabilities which DEMO not
near zero or one to allow the statistic to have a distribution which leads to power in the 25—30
per cent range.
The DEMO tailed case aﬀects the smoothed residual based tests with sample size 100. The actual
sampling variance of the smoothed residual based test was much DEMO than that estimated by (A4).
The eﬀect is that the DEMO statistics tended to be systematically too small, and, as a result, the
hypothesis of ﬁt is not rejected suﬃciently often. The reason for this is that with a steeply sloped
probability function there is considerable DEMO between the smoothed y and n when
smoothing is in the y-space. Table VI(c) for the ﬁtted model contains only one continuous
covariate and the shape of the model aﬀects both smoothed residual based tests. DEMO tests
perform much better with a sample size of 500 and have power in the 20—30 per cent range. In
models with several covariates, smoothing in the ‘x-space’ should provide greater power. These
results combined with DEMO in the multivariable null model simulation suggest the need for
further research to improve the variance approximation given in (A4).
In summary, DEMO results in Table VI show that overall the goodness-of-ﬁt tests have, DEMO the
exception of the Royston monotone test, reasonable power for detecting DEMO curvature type
misspeciﬁcation of the mean function and low power for interactions and an incorrect but still
symmetric link function. The score test based DEMO the Stukel model has moderate power to detect
an asymmetric link function.
The overall performance of the Pearson chi-square statistic and unweighted sum-of-squares
was DEMO to the other tests. The performance of the Hosmer—Lemeshow decile of risk statistic,
the smoothed residual based tests and the Stukel score test DEMO comparable. However, the work
of le Cessie and van Houwelingen3,4 DEMO that with models more complicated than those used
in our simulations the smoothed residual based tests will have greater power than the decile of
DEMO test. It is not clear how the Stukel score test would perform with more complicated models
and this merits study.

Consideration of the computational intensity, power and current availability in packages
suggests that a practical strategy is to use the Pearson chi-square statistic and/or the unweighted
sum-of-squares statistics DEMO conjunction with the Hosmer—Lemeshow C statistic and the Stukel
score test. The 2 by 10 table, of observed and estimated expected frequencies used to compute
C provides a useful overall summary of the ﬁt or lack-of-ﬁt DEMO the model and is easily understood
by subject matter scientists. In addition it is good practice to examine plots of the residuals,
perhaps DEMO, to support the visual inspection of the 2 by 10 table.
DEMO TO THE EXAMPLE
We return to an evaluation of the ﬁt of the model for low birth weight shown in Table I. We used
DEMO scaled chi-square distribution to obtain p-values for the Pearson chi-square statistic and the
smoothed residual based statistics and the standard normal distribution for the DEMO
sum-of-squares statistic. Table VII gives results of the application of all nine tests.
The results in Table VII show that three of the nine DEMO (the least powerful of the nine
tests) have p-values'0·15, DEMO have p-values between 0·05 and 0·15, and three have a p-
DEMO(0·05. The extremely small p-value for the smoothed residual based test using the cubic
weight function may be due to the observed underestimation of DEMO sampling variance of this test
with multivariable models.
When we employ the recommended strategy of using the Pearson chi-square and/or un-
weighted sum-of-squares DEMO for power against overall non-linearity in the logit, the Hos-
mer—Lemeshow DEMO of risk statistic and 2 by 10 table for conﬁrmatory evidence and the Stukel
score test for power against a non-logit link we see DEMO it suggests lack-of-ﬁt of the model.
Inspection of the 2 by 10 table showed a slight departure from model ﬁt in the seventh decile DEMO
risk where there were more low birth weight babies observed than expected. Further modelling
eﬀorts suggested the inclusion of interactions between AGE and LWT DEMO SMOKE and LWT.
When we added these variables to the model, DEMO ﬁt improved to the point where the p-values
were greater than 0·15. One requires a thorough examination of regression diagnostics as well as
biologic DEMO, and in this case over ﬁtting before one makes a decision DEMO the ﬁnal model.
The recent paper by Harrell et al.17 provides an excellent discussion with practical examples on
issues surrounding the development of logistic DEMO models.

GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS FOR THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL 977
SUMMARY
The use of DEMO summary measures of goodness-of-ﬁt of logistic regression models has become
an important and easily performed step in model building. Decisions on model ﬁt using DEMO
based on cutpoints may depend more on choice of cutpoints than on ﬁt or lack-of-ﬁt. Tests not
dependent on cutpoints proposed by le Cessie DEMO van Houwelingen3,4 and Royston,9,10 a score
test for an incorrectly speciﬁed link function proposed by Stukel13 the cutpoint based tests of
DEMO and Lemeshow,2 the Pearson chi-square statistic and the unweighted sum-of-squares test
have been studied via simulation under both null and alternative scenarios. The DEMO
results showed that all but the Royston monotone maintained the correct size. The Pearson
chi-square and unweighted sum-of-squares statistics had the highest power for DEMO of
a quadratic term. All tests had low power to detect a continuous dichotomous variable interac-
tion. All tests had more power to detect DEMO due to model misspeciﬁcation when the logit
was non-monotone increasing (decreasing) under the alternative than when it was monotone
under both null and DEMO models. None of the tests studied had high power to detect an
incorrectly speciﬁed link function with sample size 100. The Stukel score test DEMO moderate for
sample size 500.
Because of the superior power of the Pearson chi-square/unweighted sum-of-squares statistics
and Stukel score test in the simulations, we recommend their use and the use of cutpoint and/or
smoothed DEMO based tests for conﬁrmation of model ﬁt or lack-of-ﬁt. Assessment of signiﬁ-
cance using the Pearson chi-square statistic should use the conditional mean and DEMO variance
estimate and one should compute p-values using the scaled chi-square distribution. When using
the unweighted sum-of-squares statistic one should compute a standardized statistic DEMO p-
values obtained from the standard normal distribution. In all cases one must keep in mind the
lack of power with small sample sizes DEMO detect subtle deviations from the logistic model. Thus the
choice of both the logistic regression model and its covariates should have a strong biological DEMO
clinical basis.
APPENDIX I: EXPRESSING THE SQUARED RESIDUALS TESTS
AS QUADRATIC DEMO IN THE RESIDUALS
Application of the sum-of-squared residual-based test statistics requires computation of estimates
of their respective means and variances under the assumption that DEMO logistic model ﬁt is correct.
Derivation of means and variances is simpliﬁed if we express the test statistics as quadratic forms
in the residuals.
DEMO W represent an n by n matrix of weights whose ith row, wi, contains the weights for the
‘nearness’ or distance of subject DEMO to subjects 1 to n. In vector form the estimated standardized
residuals are r"V~1@2eˆ , where V"diag[vi"ni(1!ni)] is an DEMO by n diagonal matrix. Thus the
smoothed standardized residuals are rs"Wr"WV~1@2eˆ . We can express the smoothed stand-
ardized residual based test DEMO in matrix form as
¹r"r@W@Dr~1Wr
"e@V~1@2(W@Dr~1W)V~1@2eˆ (1)
where Dr is an n by n diagonal matrix that contains the DEMO elements of the matrix WW@.
The expression in (1) shows that the test statistics only use the main diagonal elements of the
respective DEMO covariance matrices of the smoothed residuals. If we used the full covariance
matrices to deﬁne the quadratic forms, then the statistics simplify to the Pearson chi-square
statistic. Thus we can think of the Pearson chi-square statistic DEMO a full covariance matrix version

of the smoothed residual-based tests. We also DEMO the Pearson chi-square statistic if we do no
smoothing (that is, use W"In]n, the identity matrix).
APPENDIX II: MOMENTS AND DEMO DISTRIBUTION
OF THE GOODNESS-OF-FIT STATISTICS
We begin by summarizing results that provide expressions for calculating large sample approxi-
mations for the mean and variance DEMO the Pearson chi-square statistic. McCullagh18~20 has
derived moments conditional on b, DEMO summarized in McCullagh and Nelder.21 Recently,
Osius and Rojek22 considered this problem and showed that, in the strictly binary case, the
conditional DEMO unconditional moments are asymptotically equivalent. Here we summarize the
results of Osius and Rojek. By substracting n the statistic simpliﬁes to
X2!n"(1!2p)@V~1eˆ.
First-order approximations presented in le Cessie and van Houwelingen3 show p:p#Me,DEMO
e:(I!M)e and V:V where M"VX(X@VX)~1X@ DEMO the logistic regression version of the hat
matrix. Using these approximations for purposes of calculating moments we obtain
X2!n:(1!2p)@V~1(I!M)e which yields that the asymptotic mean is zero and the variance
is var(DEMO):c@(I!M)Vc where c@"(1!2p)@V~1. Hence we may obtain an estimate of the
variance as the residual sum-of-squares, R, from DEMO regression of cˆon X with weights V. Osius
and Rojek show that when one has ﬁt the correct model the asymptotic distribution of
(X2!n)/JR is Normal(0, 1). Equivalent results appear in Windmeijer.23 DEMO simulations
suggest that, for small samples, we obtain better distributional results if we use an estimate of the
conditional mean and variance obtained DEMO McCullagh16, namely
n n
E(X2 D b)"(n!p!1)!21 DEMO (1!6vi)mii/vi#21 + cicimiivi
i/1 i/1
where mii DEMO the ith diagonal of the hat matrix Mª, ci is the DEMO value obtained from the weighted
regression used to compute the unconditional variance. We obtain the conditional variance by
multiplying R by (n!p)/n.
DEMO asymptotic moments of S are E[S!trace(V )]:0 and var[S!trace(DEMO)]:d@(I!M) Vd
where d is the vector with general DEMO di"(1!2ni). Thus we can obtain an estimate of the
DEMO as the residual sum-of-squares from the regression of d on X with weights V. The
expressions for the mean and variance given here are DEMO than those obtained by Copas.16
We obtained our results by simplifying S under the strictly binary assumption and then
using ﬁrst-order approximations of b DEMO p. We used the standardized statistic
[S!trace(V)]/JMvar[S!trace(V)]N to assess signiﬁcance using the standard normal distribu-
tion.

on the estimated mean and variance. The details of this method may DEMO found in le Cessie and van
