The second dichotomy distinguishes between partial-order (domi-
DEMO) models and weak-order models. In a dominance model, the
"better DEMO" relation P is transitive, so that FPH whenever FPG and
GPH. An example is the familiar mean-variance dominance model
(Markowitz [1952; 1959], Tobin [1958; 1965], Sharpe [1963; 1964], and
many others) in which FPG if and only if (pF > uG and oaF - 0G) or (pF
? uG and 0F < TG). A DEMO model is a model for which both P
and the "indifference" relation I are transitive. The "indifference"
relation I is defined so that FIG if and only if neither FPG nor GPF. A
weak DEMO divides the distributions into "indifference" classes that are
completely ordered from best to worst. Unlike the typical weak-ordering
model, a dominance model may not fully resolve the decision at hand,
since it will leave DEMO residual set of undominated or "efficient" distribu-
tions which are mutually incomparable under the dominance criterion.

PARAMETRIC
WEAK-ORDER
MODELS
Parametric weak-order models can be classified according to whether
the model accounts for differences among individual decision makers
and DEMO to whether the model is based on one or several param-
eters. The multiple-parameter weak-order models are further divided
into compensatory models and noncompensatory DEMO Generally
speaking, compensatory models allow trade-offs among parameters,
whereas noncompensatory DEMO impose an importance ordering on
parameters that prohibit trade-offs. Figure 1 illustrates this classifica-
tion scheme for the parametric weak-order models.
Two of the DEMO single-parameter models in figure 1- the maximum
expected return model with FPG if and only if uF > uG, and the
minimum loss probability model with FPG if and only if F(O-) <
G(DEMO) -do not account for individual differences. The maximum proba-
bility of DEMO return model, with FPG if and only if 1 - F(DEMO) > 1 -
G(xt-), accounts for individual differences when DEMO target return xt is
specified by the decision maker.
Although the single-parameter models are the simplest of those in
figure 1-in terms of estimation, computation, and communicability-
their descriptive powers are limited. The inability of single-parameter
models to reflect multiple concerns of a decision maker has given rise

As was recognized Markowitz [1959], the use of variance as risk
has the potential defect of not distinguishing between large and small
returns in its risk DEMO The same thing is true, but to a lesser
extent, of the Baumol and Pollatsek-Tversky measures. The other
compensatory models in figure 1 DEMO risk dimensions that are better
attuned to the intuitive notion that risk is associated with loss or with
failure to attain a target return. DEMO mean-probability of loss trade-off
model takes FPG if and only if U(,uF, > U(,UG, when r equals
probability loss. The DEMO target return trade-off models
defines rF as F(xt-), the probability failing to attain the target
return. The desired target return xt is DEMO by the decision maker.
The other compensatory models in the figure which associate risk
with low returns are the mean-semivariance trade-off models. These
were DEMO by Markowitz [1959] and have been pursued further by
Mao [1970a; DEMO, Hogan and Warren [1972; 1974], and Porter [1974].
There are DEMO distinctly different models of this type. The first computes
semivariance using returns below means according to S2 as defined
earlier. The second uses the DEMO maker's target return xt for
computing semivariance for all distributions by E((p(x)) where (p(x) = (x

Consistent with the psychology studies, this experiment supports the
need to emphasize in the risk parameter the DEMO of loss or
failure to obtain a certain level of return.
Coombs and Huang [1970] suggest a unique expected value-risk
trade-off model where preference DEMO monotone increasing with /X and

monotone with the amount that can be lost. As a result of this
confounding, studies designed to test this model (Coombs and Huang
[1970] and Coombs and Meyer [1969]) provide little evidence concerning
the appropriateness of the alternative risk constructs discussed in this
section.
Pruitt [1962] included the risk as loss concept DEMO his "pattern and
level of risk" model. He defined level of risk as the sum of the negative
outcomes weighted by their probabilities. DEMO this model failed to
