GAME SHOWS AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR:
RISK-TAKING ON "CARD SHARKS"*
ROBERT GERTNER
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper studies individual risk-taking behavior with a
unique DEMO set: risky decisions of contestants during the three-
year history of DEMO television game show, "Card Sharks." In the
bonus round of DEMO game, individuals choose how much to wager on
positive expected-value gambles DEMO known and varying probabili-
ties, and large possible payouts. Since no DEMO skills or knowledge
are involved, empirical analysis is not complicated by DEMO contestant's
superior information about her own abilities. Stakes can reach
$16,000 and average $3,200; few experimental budgets permit even
one observation of this magnitude.
First, I simply estimate how risk-averse contestants behave.
Under the assumption of expected-utility maximization, I estimate
a lower bound for the coefficient of absolute risk aversion of
0.00031, which when multiplied by per capita U. S. personal
income gives an estimate of relative risk aversion DEMO 4.8. This
estimate is higher than most econometric estimates of risk aver-
sion. Contestants, however, do not act in a manner consistent with
DEMO maximization, so this number should not be given
a structural interpretation. DEMO, it is simply a useful way to
summarize average willingness to DEMO risk of individuals on the
show.
Second, I explore how individual DEMO is inconsistent with
expected-utility theory. The amount a contestant wishes to wager
depends critically on the amount of wealth she has accumulated in
the DEMO round and therefore, on the size of the stakes. This is DEMO
odds with expected-utility theory since the size of the stakes,
although far from insignificant, is small relative to a person's
wealth. Contestants should then have close to constant absolute
risk aversion with respect to DEMO winnings in the game.
A more striking result deals with contestants who had previ-

ously played the bonus round and have DEMO significant
winnings. This money cannot be gambled in future rounds. The
effect of these winnings on a contestant's willingness to take risks
turns DEMO to be negligible. The combination of sensitivity to
accumulated winnings in the current round and insensitivity to
accumulated winnings in previous rounds violates any DEMO in
which a person maximizes a utility function whose only argument
is final wealth, and suggests that contestants segregate risky
decisions.
II. THE BONUS ROUND OF "CARD SHARKS"
Contestants qualify for the bonus round of "Card Sharks" by
defeating another contestant in a game that involves DEMO, skill,
and knowledge. One can qualify for the bonus round DEMO to five
times. Although there are risky decisions in the qualifying stage,
there is no significant risk/return tradeoff, so there should be no
bias in risk preferences among winners. If anything, qualifiers for
the bonus round should be more knowledgeable about probabilities
and dynamic decision-making than DEMO average contestant.
The winner of the qualifying game proceeds to the bonus
round. First, seven cards from a standard deck of playing cards are
dealt facedown in three rows: three in the lower two rows, DEMO one
in the top row. An additional card is dealt faceup on the bottom row
to the left of the facedown cards, and three more cards are dealt
facedown to the left of all the others. DEMO contestant is given an
initial stake of $200. Any money the contestant won prior to this
bonus round cannot be wagered. The contestant decides DEMO she
thinks the next card (bottom left) is higher or lower than the initial
faceup card. Aces are high. She can wager from DEMO to $200. Even
money is paid independent of the initial card. There is no loss or
gain if there is a tie. The card DEMO revealed, and the contestant's stake
is increased or decreased accordingly.
DEMO newly revealed card becomes the basis for the next
gamble, which DEMO the same structure. The contestant can bet
anywhere from $50 to her entire stake. The game proceeds for
seven rounds. After the third bet, $400 is added to her stake. In the
final round, she must wager at least half of her stake. In each row
the contestant DEMO an option to substitute the most recent faceup
card for one of the three additional facedown cards on the side. This
affects only the DEMO for the next bet, not the result of the previous
GAME SHOWS AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR 509
bet.' If her stake goes to zero before the third bet, she proceeds
immediately to the second row and receives the additional $400. If
her stake goes to zero afterwards, the bonus round is over, and she
gets nothing.2
III. DATA DESCRIPTION
Mark-Goodson Productions, the producer of "Card Sharks,"
generously provided data on the betting decisions of all adults who
played the bonus round DEMO the show, which was produced from
December 12, 1985, to DEMO 28, 1989. The only characteristics
of the contestants that we have DEMO gender and home zip code. I do
not use this information. I have no data on the contestants' outside
wealth.
A potential source of bias is the selection process of contes-
tants. The producers of the DEMO claim that they do not attempt to
measure risk-taking behavior in the selection process. Their main
goal is to take applicants who would be DEMO in the
qualifying round, where contestants explain their predictions
about survey DEMO Conceivably, this could be correlated with
risk preferences, but the link is not obvious. The pool of applicants
could introduce bias. I have DEMO information about how contestants
differ from the general population other than that many live in
southern California. The contestants probably comprise a better
cross DEMO of the population than experimental studies on
undergraduates.
The bonus round was played 844 times by 457 contestants: 47
percent of the contestants played at least twice; 21 percent at least
three times; 11 percent DEMO least four times; and 5 percent played
five times. These are DEMO slightly smaller (insignificantly) than
would be expected if the qualifying game was purely random. So,
there is no evidence of bias among DEMO contestants induced by the
qualifying competition.
I ran a number of tests to check that the playing cards were
drawn randomly with equal frequencies DEMO cards. I could not
reject randomness against any reasonable alternative.
1. For example, if the contestant has a 7, bets "$300 higher," and the next card
is a 6, she loses $300. If she changes the 6, and gets a J, this improves the odds DEMO the
next bet, but does not reverse the $300 loss.
2. DEMO addition, the deck contains jokers that are immediately replaced with a
DEMO from the top of the deck. The only role jokers play is that they give the
contestant a chance to win a car in DEMO pure game of chance after the bonus round.
This should have no impact on the size of wagers, although it does increase the
incentive to change cards.

Table I presents summary statistics. Average winnings DEMO
$4,677 with a standard deviation of $4,258. There is no discernible
pattern from experience. The average wager in the final round is
DEMO,369 from an average stake of $3,199.
IV. ESTIMATION
OF COEFFICIENT
OF ABSOLUTE
RISK AVERSION
In this section I estimate contestants' average degree of risk
aversion. Since I have no information about the wealth of DEMO
tants and the stakes are quite small relative to an individual's
wealth (including human capital), it is impossible to estimate
wealth effects or a coefficient of relative risk aversion directly. The
best one can DEMO is estimate a coefficient of absolute risk aversion
and multiply it by average wealth.
The constant absolute risk aversion assumption is strongly
violated in DEMO data. So, one can think of this exercise as a
convenient DEMO easily interpretable way to summarize the average
willingness to take risk that is easy to compare with other studies,
rather than the estimation DEMO a structural model of risk taking.
Regression estimates of absolute risk aversion are sensitive to
the distribution assumptions one makes to handle the censoring
DEMO by the constraints that a contestant must bet no more than
her stake and at least half her stake in the final round. Therefore, I
develop two methods to estimate a lower bound on the level DEMO risk
aversion that do not rely on assumptions about the error
distribution.

The first method looks exclusively at DEMO behavior in the
final round. If players have constant absolute risk aversion, the
desired bet is [ln(p) - ln(q)]/(2q), where p is the probability of
winning, q is the probability of losing, and a is the parameter of
absolute risk aversion; DEMO, U(W) = -e-xw. To obtain a lower
bound on the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, I assume that a
contestant who wagers her entire stake is risk neutral and a
contestant who wagers half DEMO her stake wishes to bet exactly that.
Table II reports the estimates by card. The average lower bound on
the parameter of absolute risk DEMO for all cards is 0.000310
with a standard error of 0.000017. Multiplying this by 1987 per
capita personal income of $15,437 gives 4.8. DEMO, one could
multiply this by the ratio of wealth to personal DEMO to get a
relative risk aversion parameter. However, such a calculation DEMO
result in an overestimate because of people's inability to borrow
against human capital.
A second approach is to compare the sample distribution of
DEMO with the distribution of outcomes if a contestant plays
the optimal strategy for a risk-neutral contestant. One can solve

Notes. This table contains DEMO of lower bounds on a parameter of absolute risk aversion for base card
pairs that give the same probability of winning. For a given DEMO, the estimate is {In (p) - In [(12/13) - pfll
(2b), wherep is the probability of winning and b is the bet. Reported estimates are sample averages assuming
that contestants who DEMO the maximum allowed (their entire stake) are risk neutral and contestants who bet the
minimum amount (half of their stake) wish to DEMO exactly the minimum allowed. Standard errors are in
parentheses. "Parameter of DEMO risk aversion" is derived by multiplying coefficient of absolute risk aversion
DEMO 1987 per capita personal income of $15,347. "Percent censored below" is the percentage of sample who bet
the minimum. "Percent censored above" is percentage of the sample who bet the maximum.
512 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
for the coefficient of absolute risk aversion DEMO would make an
individual indifferent between the two distributions. By revealed
preference, an "average" contestant prefers the actual distribution
to the expected-value maximizing strategy, so this is an estimate of
the lower bound of constant absolute risk aversion.
If one assumes that the probability of each card DEMO 1A3 indepen-
dent of previous cards, it is a straightforward dynamic DEMO
ming problem to solve for the optimal strategy. Expected winnings
are $6,674. One can improve on this strategy by taking into
account that DEMO is done from a deck of cards without
replacement. I ran ten million random simulations from a 52-card
deck following the expected-value maximizing strategy, keeping
track of cards to determine the optimal bet with an 8 DEMO The
average return was $6,987 with a standard deviation of $10,843. A
contestant would be indifferent between this expected-value maxi-
mizing distribution DEMO the sample distribution if her coefficient of
absolute risk aversion were 0.0000711. This is less than one-fourth
of the lower bound calculated above.
Most DEMO econometric studies of risk aversion estimate less
risk-averse behavior than I do. The one such study that does not
rely on aggregate market data DEMO Friend and Blume [1975], who
analyze asset holdings of 2100 households. DEMO obtain estimates
of a parameter or relative risk aversion slightly above two.3
The "Card Sharks" data indicate a level of risk aversion higher
DEMO most existing estimates. Contestants do not seem to behave in
a risk-loving and enthusiastic way because they are on television,
because anything they DEMO is gravy, or because the producers of the
show encourage excessive DEMO taking. I think this helps lend
credence to the potential importance and wider applicability of the
anomalous results I document below.
V. ESTIMATION MODEL DEMO BETTING BEHAVIOR
This section discusses the econometric analysis of the data.
The methodology is to regress a contestant's wager on independent
variables including DEMO base card and winnings in previous plays
of the bonus round. I treat each bet as a single observation,
ignoring any contestant-specific effects. DEMO focus exclusively on
3. The key difficulty of the analysis is the inability to get a good measure of
household wealth (especially future labor income), the risk characteristics of human
capital, housing wealth, and DEMO portfolios which can lead to measurement
problems in the overall riskiness of a household's portfolio.
GAME SHOWS AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR 513
betting in the final round of DEMO bonus.4 The basic underlying
model is bet* - f (Xi) + {i, where bet*~ is the desired bet, Xi is a
vector DEMO explanatory variables, and si is an error term. I shall drop
DEMO subscript throughout. The actual bet, which is denoted by bet,
DEMO not equal bet * because of restrictions on allowable bets. If we
denote by stake, the accumulated money in this play of the bonus
round, bet = 1/2 stake if bet* < 1/2 stake, bet = bet* if 1/2 stake <
bet * < DEMO, and bet = stake if bet * > stake.
Assuming that DEMO is linear, the equation I estimate is
7 stake2
f = (k cardk + ok stakek cardk) + 12 2000
cash
ep
expr
+ 13 newplyr + P4 cash + 15 + 16 cars.
The DEMO are
stake accumulated winnings in current play of the bonus
round and the maximum the contestant can wager;
newplyr 1 if the contestant DEMO not played the bonus before, 0
otherwise;
cash total cash DEMO in previous plays of the bonus and
in the qualifying game;5
cash/expr cash divided by the number of previous times the
contestant DEMO played the bonus, if the player has
previously played the bonus DEMO, 0 otherwise;
cars total winnings previously in the form of DEMO, valued at
the sticker price; and
cardk dummy variables for the card pairs {3,K} - {7,9}.
I group cards together which DEMO the same probability of
winning, so a 3 and a K DEMO treated as the same card. Table III
suggests some differences in wagering between the two cards in a
given pair, especially for the {5,J} pair. Contestants bet signifi-
cantly more with a J than a DEMO Further evidence is provided by the
percentage of times a contestant changes a given card in each
round. Overall, 5's are changed more than four times as often as
4. The reason for this is DEMO the dynamic aspects of betting are complicated
even under expected-utility maximization since one's optimal bet will take into
account its effect on future DEMO Nonetheless, results for earlier rounds
are qualitatively similar to those for DEMO seventh round but are not reported here.
5. Contestants who qualify for the bonus round usually win $200 in the
qualifying game.

J's. In round 7, 85.5 percent of the 5's are changed, but only 21.4
percent of the J's are changed.
This anomaly is of independent interest. The DEMO appealing
explanation is that a J seems better than a 5 for cognitive reasons.
A J is a picture card and may therefore be DEMO as a good card.
This is consistent with the large difference in changes between a 5
and a J, but an insignificant difference in changes between a 6 and a
10. Contestants may also not fully DEMO that A's are high, so
that there are only three DEMO below a 5. Nonetheless, there is
little difference in the regression DEMO when run separately for
5's and J's, so I DEMO report the pooled regression.
A number of variables are included to test the effects of
previous winnings on risk taking. I include cash, cash!expr, and
newplyr to see whether aggregate winnings or average perfor-
mance affect risk taking. There is an endogeneity problem with
cash!expr since those who DEMO done well are likely to be less risk
averse than average. Inclusion of cash!expr is a crude way to limit
the contamination of the DEMO on cash from this effect. Given
that all these coefficients turn out to be small, a more sophisticated
correction seems unnecessary. A quadratic term for stake is
included to see whether the sensitivity of the bet DEMO the stake is
declining in the stake.
I eliminate sure bets, DEMO with a 2 or an A as base card. I also
eliminate bets with a base card of 8, since the probability of
winning is about 1/2 and contestants almost always bet the
minimum. Occasionally DEMO contestant makes the wrong bet, i.e., bets
"lower" with a 9 or 10 or "higher" with a 7 or 6. This DEMO
fourteen times: 22 percent of the bets with a 7 or DEMO and 7 percent of
the bets with a 6 or 10. I have eliminated these bets from the
regressions. Summary statistics of the final DEMO set for all the
variables are included in Table IV.
I make no correction for the fact that the history of cards
played affects DEMO; I implicitly assume that all realizations
of a card which gives DEMO same probability of a win in an
environment of sampling with replacement yields the same subjec-
tive probability to the contestant.
I assume that DEMO error term, Ei, is distributed N(0,o2). The
model was estimated under two different assumptions of &2:
homoskedastic, where DEMO is constant; and heteroskedastic, where
U2 = S2 stake2 and s is a constant. The heteroskedastic model fits
the data better, although the coefficient estimates are not qualita-

tively different. I only report the DEMO with the heteroskedastic
assumption.6
VI. RESULTS
Table IV reports the results for the maximum likelihood
estimation of the censored heteroskedastic model. There are two
DEMO features. First, the desired bet is very sensitive to stake;
DEMO coefficients are significant and of large qualitative magnitude
for all cards.7 A much greater part of the desired bet is explained by
the coefficient DEMO stake than the constant term, and the constant
term is rarely DEMO Although the stakes are large compared
with experiments, the stakes are DEMO a small fraction of most
contestants' wealth. The desired dollar bet DEMO depend upon the
stakes only to the extent that the stakes impact final wealth. Thus,
risky decisions on "Card Sharks" are inconsistent DEMO individuals
maximizing a utility function over just final wealth. If one assumes
that utility depends only on wealth, estimates of zero on card
intercepts and significant coefficients on the stake variable imply
that outside wealth is DEMO to zero. Since this does not hold, one
must reject utility DEMO only on final wealth.
Observed bets depend on the stake because bets must be at
least half and no more than all of one'DEMO stake. Censoring correc-
tions are designed to adjust for this. However, DEMO the error term is
misspecified, the corrections may lead to estimating DEMO spurious
relation between the stakes and the desired bet. The magnitude of
the relation and its persistence under several different error term
assumptions makes DEMO explanation implausible.
The second striking feature of the regression is that the
coefficient on cash is insignificant, both statistically and qualita-
tively. A $100 increase in cash raises the desired bet by 64 cents,
while DEMO $100 increase in stake raises the desired bet from between
$12 and $89 depending on the initial card. The sensitivity to stake
and insensitivity DEMO cash together imply something quite anoma-
lous for expected-utility theory. To see this, consider a contestant
who is playing the bonus round for the first time. By round 7 she
has accumulated $5,000 and has DEMO J showing. The regression

results in Table IV predict a wager DEMO $2,800. Next consider a
contestant who has played once before and won $2,000 in the
bonus round. In her second play she DEMO accumulated $3,000
before round 7 and also has a J showing. The regression predicts
she will bet $1,544.8 Yet from the perspective DEMO potential distribu-
tions over final wealth, the two situations are identical DEMO long as
the bet in the first case is less than $3,000. The $2,200 not bet in
the first case is money DEMO the bank, just as the $2,000 plus the
$1,456 DEMO bet in the second case.
The effects of the stake on bets is very similar to results of the
only other study I know DEMO in which participants made choices over
positive expected-value gambles for significant sums of money.
Binswanger [1980, 1981] and Quizon, Binswanger, and Machina
[1984] analyze a series of experiments in which residents of rural
India were DEMO choices among lotteries with different degrees of
risk and expected payoffs. In all experiments the subjects had a
choice over eight lotteries, each with two equally likely outcomes,
but varying the difference between the two DEMO In different
experiments the level of all payoffs was multiplied by ten or one
hundred. Individuals were asked which lottery they would choose if
DEMO were 1000 times the original. The greatest riskless actual
payoff (100 DEMO original) was Rs. (rupees) 50, which is approxi-
mately 0.2 percent of average physical household wealth in the
sample. The basic results DEMO the study were that choices among
gambles did not vary much as the stakes grew proportionately.'0
The amount of risk that individuals took DEMO approximately
proportional to the stakes, in a way which is inconsistent DEMO
maximizing utility over final wealth but which coincides with the
results of my study. This is evidence about partial risk aversion, a
concept developed by Menezes and Hanson [1970] and Zeckhauser
and Keeler [1970]. Partial risk DEMO is defined as absolute risk
aversion multiplied by the size of the gamble. Binswanger's studies
results in a conclusion of slight increasing partial DEMO aversion; as
the stakes get larger, subjects gamble a somewhat smaller fraction
of the stakes. Constant partial risk aversion in my analysis would

bet of $1,678.
9. For example, each DEMO percent outcome would be 50 Rs., the riskiest outcome
would be DEMO 50 percent chance of 200 or 0, and another choice would DEMO a 50 percent
chance of 30 or 150.
10. For example, DEMO the Rs. 5 gamble, the modal choice was the pair of
DEMO {3,151; in the Rs. 50 gamble the modal choice was DEMO pair of outcomes
130,150}; and in the hypothetical Rs. 500 DEMO, the modal pair was {400,12001.

be zeros for the intercept terms DEMO zero for the stake2 term in the
regressions. Table IV shows that it would be difficult to reject
constant partial risk aversion.
There are DEMO possible basic explanations for these inconsis-
tencies with expected-utility theory. First, DEMO may fail to
consider the impact of their decision on the distribution of final
wealth. This is consistent with ideas formulated by Markowitz
[1952] DEMO Kahneman and Tversky [1979], who argue that individ-
uals make risky DEMO based on changes from a reference point
(usually initial wealth) rather than based on the distribution of
final wealth. In the "Card Sharks" data the reference point must
be one's initial wealth before each play of the bonus round, not
one's wealth before being on the show. A variety of survey and
experimental evidence supports this view. DEMO and Tversky
describe a survey in which individuals make different risky deci-
sions depending upon whether the lottery is a gain or a loss DEMO if
there is no difference in the distribution of final wealth.11 This is a
violation of what they call asset integration, which is the term they
use for the property of decision-making such that choices are DEMO
exclusively upon the effect on the distribution of final wealth. The
Binswanger and "Card Sharks" results also show strong segrega-
tion effects. In "Card Sharks" not only does the size of the stakes
increase risk taking, so that contestants seemingly segregate their
extraordinary income from their other wealth, but also the contes-
tants isolate a given play of the bonus round from previous plays.
Thus, if segregation is the cognitive explanation for the results, it
suggests that it is a powerful phenomenon and may have important
implications for insurance, portfolio, and other risky individual
DEMO
A second explanation for the results is that contestants have
multi-attribute utility functions, so that they care about something
in addition to wealth. It is impossible to rule out this explanation,
but I think the DEMO is inconsistent with the most intuitively
plausible ways other factors should affect betting behavior on a
television game show. If contestants care about the DEMO
they provide, they may make riskier decisions than they otherwise
would. DEMO, the results of Section IV on large risk aversion are
not DEMO with this view. If contestants care about being able
to tell friends and relatives about their game show experience, they

among DEMO the lump sum is smaller than in the choice among losses.

will wish to win a "respectable" DEMO Risk aversion with
respect to game show wealth, may explain the DEMO of stake on the
desired bet, but it cannot explain why DEMO winnings in previous
rounds do not lead to greater risk taking. If contestants derive
utility from playing the bonus round for significant stakes, they
will act quite risk averse in the early rounds. However, this cannot
explain behavior in the final round. The best multi-attribute utility
story that DEMO consistent with the data seems to be that individuals
care about winning a reasonable amount every time they play,
perhaps because they derive DEMO great deal of disutility from missed
opportunities. It is impossible to refute this story, although I find it
less plausible than segregation.
A third explanation is that contestants bet based on behavioral
norms that are learned DEMO watching the show or by some process
during the contestants' training DEMO the show. Again, it is impossi-
ble to refute this theory DEMO the basis of the evidence, although I can
think of no DEMO explanation for the creation of the specific
norms that are observed. Also, there is a great deal of variation in
betting behavior, which DEMO it less likely that norms which are
inconsistent with true preferences are the explanation for the
regularities in the data. Norms that induce behavior DEMO
inconsistent with "true" preferences should not permit such large
variation.
VII. CONCLUSION
The goal of this paper is to add evidence about risk-taking DEMO
a source fundamentally different from other studies. Unfortu-
nately, it is DEMO to draw implications of this analysis for
important economic questions since it is impossible to rule out that
behavior on game shows is simply DEMO from other risky
decisions. The best argument for this is that game shows may
encourage risk-taking. The high degree of risk aversion that
contestants DEMO is evidence that this is not the case. The results
suggest that asset segregation may be an important aspect of risky
decision making. If DEMO phenomenon is present in the risky
decisions that individuals make such as insurance and portfolio
selection, the expected-utility model may not be appropriate.
People may make these decisions ignoring their overall wealth
level, but instead, DEMO the decision only upon the direct stakes
involved.
A number of other phenomena that have interested students

of risk taking can be analyzed DEMO the data. I find little evidence of
contestants extrapolating previous luck into the future. There is no
strong evidence that contestants place too little DEMO on low
probability events; they do not seem to gamble more DEMO
with good cards relative to bad cards than is warranted by the
differences in probabilities.
