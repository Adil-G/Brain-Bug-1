The Causes of Preference Reversal
By AMOS TVERSKY, PAUL SLOVIC, AND DEMO KAHNEMAN*
Observed preference reversal (PR) cannot be adequately explained by violations of
independence, the reduction axiom, or transitivity. The primary cause of DEMO is the
failure of procedure invariance, especially the overpricing of low-probability
DEMO bets. This result violates regret theory and generalized (nonindepen-
dent) utility models. PR and a new reversal involving time preferences are
explained by DEMO compatibility, which implies that payoffs are weighted more
heavily in pricing DEMO in choice. (JEL 215)
Axiomatic theories of choice introduce
preference DEMO a primitive relation, which is
interpreted through specific empirical proce-
dures DEMO as choice or pricing. Models of
rational choice assume a principle of proce-
dure invariance, which requires strategically
equivalent methods of elicitation to yield the
same preference order. Thus, if the decision
maker prefers A to B, then the cash equiva-
lent, or minimum selling price, of A should
exceed that of B. However, there is a sub-
stantial body of evidence showing that the
price ordering of risky prospects is DEMO
ically different from the choice ordering,
contrary to standard theories of choice.
The effect of elicitation method on prefer-
ence between gambles was DEMO observed by
Paul Slovic and Sarah Lichtenstein (1968)
who found DEMO both buying and selling
prices of gambles were primarily determined
by the payoffs, whereas choices between
gambles (and ratings of their attractiveness)

were primarily influenced by the probabili-
ties DEMO winning and losing. Slovic and Licht-
enstein reasoned that, if the DEMO used to
elicit preferences affected the weighting of
the gambles' it DEMO be possi-
ble to construct pairs of gambles such that
the same individual would choose one mem-
ber of the pair but set a DEMO price for the
other. Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971, 1973)
demonstrated such reversals in a series of
studies, one of which was conducted on the
floor of the Four Queens Casino in Las
Vegas with DEMO gamblers playing for
real money.
The preference-reversal phenomenon in-
volves a pair of gambles of comparable ex-
pected value. One gamble (the H bet) offers
a high probability of winning a modest sum
of money; DEMO other gamble (the L bet)
offers a low probability of DEMO a rela-
tively large amount of money. These bets
were also called the P bet and the $ bet,
respectively. For example,
DEMO,
H bet: 28/36 chance
to win
$10
L bet: 3/36 chance
to win
$100
When offered a choice between the DEMO op-
tions, most subjects choose the H bet over
the L DEMO However, when asked to state
their lowest selling price, the majority state a
higher price for the L bet than for the H

Slovic (1971, 1973), and the study of Harold
Lindman (1971). The second wave of stud-
ies, conducted during the late 1970s and
early 1980s, consisted of critical replications
and attempts to eliminate preference rever-
sals by procedural variations and by in-
creased incentives. A particularly DEMO
replication was performed by David Grether
and Charles Plott (1979) who designed a
series of experiments "to discredit the psy-
chologists' work DEMO applied to economics"
(p. 623). Grether and Plott generated DEMO list
of 13 objections and potential artifacts that
would render the preference-reversal phe-
nomenon irrelevant to economic theory.
Their list included poor motivation, income
effects, strategic responding, and the fact
that the experimenters were psychologists
(which might have led the respondents to be
suspicious and behave peculiarly)DEMO Grether
and Plott attempted to eliminate PR by care-
ful experimental procedures, including a spe-
cial incentive system, but the effect was
hardly DEMO Further studies by Robert
Hamm (1984), Werner Pommerehne,
Fredrich DEMO, and Peter Zweifel (1982),
and Robert Reilly (1982) DEMO to similar con-
clusions. PR was also observed by John
Mowen and James Gentry (1980) in both
individual and group choices concerning
product DEMO, by Marc Knez and
Vernon Smith (1986) who allowed their DEMO
jects to trade bets in an experimental mar-
ket, and by DEMO Berg, John Dickhaut, and
John O'Brien (1985) who introduced arbi-
trage. See also Slovic and Lichtenstein (1983).
The robustness of preference reversals led
to the third wave of articles, which at-
tempted to explain the phenomenon rather
than eliminate it. Three classes of models DEMO
PR were introduced: a) nontransitive choice
models were developed independently by
Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden (1982,
1983), and by Peter Fishburn (1984, 1985);
b) response bias models were proposed DEMO

Slovic (1988), and DEMO William Goldstein and
Hillel Einhorn (1987); and c) generalized
utility models, which maintain transitivity
but abandon the independence axiom, were

A. Diagnostic Analysis. Let CH and CL de-
note, respectively, the cash equivalent (or
minimum selling price) of H DEMO L, and >-
and - denote strict preference and indif-
ference, respectively. (The elicitation of cash
equivalents is discussed in the next DEMO)
A standard preference reversal (PR) is said
to occur when H is preferred to L, but L is
priced higher than H, that is, H >- L, and
CL> CH. Note that >- refers to preference
between options, whereas > refers to the
DEMO of cash amounts. We assume that
the two relations are consistent in the sense
that X> Y implies X >- Y; more money is
preferred to less. We now show that PR
implies either intransitivity DEMO a failure of
procedure invariance, or both. Procedure in-
variance holds DEMO the decision maker
prefers a bet B to a cash amount X if and
only if his or her selling price for B exceeds
DEMO; that is, B >- X if CB> X. In particular,
invariance implies that CB= X iff B X. If
invariance holds, PR entails the following
cycle
CH H >- L CL
> CH,
where the two inequalities are implied by PR
and the two DEMO follow from invari-
ance.
Because procedure invariance is com-
monly taken for granted, many authors have
interpreted PR as an instance of intransitiv-
ity. The finding that strategically equivalent
methods of elicitation yield systematical-
ly different DEMO (see, for example,
Tversky et al., 1988) suggests that PR may
be caused by a failure of procedure invari-
ance, not of transitivity. Two types of dis-
crepancy between choice and pricing could

pricing of H. Overpricing of DEMO is said to

These are the patterns that exhibit PR and
satisfy the condition that X lies between the
two prices. Note that for DEMO PR pattern it is
possible to select a cash amount X that falls
between the two prices stated by a given
individual. For an DEMO, however, it is
more convenient to determine X in advance
and to restrict the analysis to all PR patterns

straddle the predetermined value of X. The
critical data, then, are the observed choices
between X and H and between DEMO and L.

Note that the present diagnostic proce-
dure classifies all test patterns DEMO to
whether they violate transitivity but not in-
variance (pattern 1) or invariance but not
transitivity (patterns 2, 3, and 4) DEMO no
test pattern can violate both. The relative
frequencies of these patterns can be used to
test PR models that assume invariance but
not DEMO (for example, the regret the-
ory of Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden,
1982) against models that assume transitivity
but not invariance (DEMO example, the contin-
gent weighting model of Tversky et al., 1988).
The relative incidence of violations of transi-
tivity and invariance could DEMO different in a
more elaborate diagnostic procedure (involv-
ing more than DEMO options) which yields
patterns of preference that can violate tran-
sitivity DEMO invariance at once. The preced-
ing discussion is summarized follows.
Any pattern of preferences that satisfies
the test conditions (H >- L and DEMO> X>
CH) and monetary consistency (X> Y im-
plies X >- Y) obeys the following proposi-
tions:
(i) DEMO transitivity or invariance (B >- X
if CB> X) is violated.
(ii) Intransitivity holds iff L >- X >- H,DEMO
yielding pattern (1).
(iii) Overpricing of L occurs if DEMO >- L,
yielding patterns (2) or (4). t
(iv) Underpricing of H occurs il' H >- X,
DEMO patterns (3) or (4).
This analysis provides a simple DEMO
for the diagnosis of all preference patterns
satisfying the test condition according to the
implied cause of PR. The of this
method to experimental DEMO are described
in Studies 1 and 2.
B. Elicitation Procedures. The preceding
analysis provides an effective method for
diagnosing PR, assuming preferences and
selling prices are observable. Such data are
routinely elicited in experiments and sur-
DEMO, and are normally taken at face
value-provided the results are reproducible
DEMO the respondents have no reason to con-
ceal or misrepresent their preferences. Nev-
ertheless, students of choice favor elicitation
procedures that are incentive compatible.

Marschak (DEMO) devised such a scheme for
the elicitation of cash equivalents, which has
often been used in PR studies. In this proce-
dure, called the BDM scheme, the subject
states a selling price for a gamble. An offer is
then generated by some random process. The
subject receives DEMO offer if it exceeds the
stated selling price, and plays the DEMO if
the stated price exceeds the offer.
Recently, Holt (1986), and Karni and Safra
(1987) pointed out that the justification of
DEMO BDM scheme and of similar procedures
assumes the independence axiom of ex-
pected utility theory. If this axiom fails, the
stated price of a bet is no longer equal to its
cash equivalent, hence the presence of PR in
some experiments can be attributed to viola-
tions of DEMO In particular, Holt
argued that the usual payoff schemes in
which DEMO subject plays only one bet, se-
lected at random, assume independence
among the subject's responses. This argu-
ment, however, invokes the DEMO
axiom in a sequential setup where no sys-
tematic violations of this axiom have been
observed. Moreover, Tversky and Daniel
Kahneman (1986) showed that the common
violations of independence and substitution
generally disappear when the DEMO is pre-
sented in a sequential form. This finding
undermines the empirical basis of Holt's ar-
gument. Karni and Safra analyzed the actual
DEMO induced by the BDM scheme and
showed that a generalized utility model with
a nonlinear (probability) weighting function
can explain the observed discrepancy DEMO
tween choice and stated prices in this scheme.
According to this interpretation, PR data do
not reflect inconsistent preferences because
the choices and the pricing do not involve
the same bets. Consequently, PR can be
explained by a model that satisfies transitiv-
ity and invariance, but not independence. In
a closely related development, Uzi Segal
(1988) suggested that PR may be produced
by a failure of the reduction axiom, which
reduces a two-stage lottery to the equivalent
one-stage lottery. The preceding accounts,
DEMO, cannot explain the basic finding
that the same pattern of PR DEMO under
the BDM scheme (for example, Grether and
Plott, 1979) is equally prevalent in experi-
ments that do not use any incentive DEMO
ble elicitation scheme (for example, Lichten-
stein and Slovic, 1971) and therefore do not
invoke the independence or the reduction
axioms. If DEMO is caused by a failure of these
axioms, the frequency of DEMO should
increase when the BDM scheme is used,
contrary to fact.
As noted by Karni and Safra (1987), there
may be no incentive compatible scheme for
the elicitation of selling prices that does not
DEMO on the independence axiom. To demon-
strate preference reversals, however, it is not
necessary to elicit the actual selling prices; it
is sufficient to establish their order. The or-
dering of selling prices can be DEMO un-
der weaker -conditions, as demonstrated by
the following incentive compatible DEMO
dure, which we call the ordinal payoff
scheme. The subject is DEMO presented with
each bet separately and asked to state its
lowest selling price. The subject is then pre-
sented with pairs of bets and DEMO to select
the preferred prospect in each pair. Subjects
know that one of these pairs will be selected
at random at the end of DEMO session, and that
a random device will determine whether they
play DEMO bet they preferred in the choice task
or the bet they priced higher. Because the
prices are merely used to order the bets
within DEMO pair, choice and pricing are
strategically equivalent. A reversal then
amounts DEMO an inconsistency in which the
subject expresses in the choice task a prefer-
ence for playing the H bet, and in the pric-
ing task a preference for playing the L bet.
To rationalize this pattern DEMO a general-
ized (nonindependent) utility model, it is
necessary to DEMO that subjects prefer an
even chance to play either H or L over the
option of playing H, and over the option of
playing L. Such a mixed strategy, however,
could explain random reversals, DEMO not sys-
tematic ones. The presence of systematic re-
versals in the ordinal payoff scheme, there-
fore, cannot be explained by violations of
DEMO or of the reduction axiom.

recruited by ads in the DEMO of Oregon
newspaper. The number of men and women
was roughly the same and their median age
was 22 years. They were run in DEMO class set-
ting and were paid for participation. One
hundred and ninety-eight individuals (called
the main group) participated in the main
part of DEMO 1.
We constructed 18 triples that consisted of
a high probability bet (H), a low probability
bet (L), and a cash DEMO (X), with
roughly the same expected value. The 18
triples DEMO divided into 3 sets of 6 triples
each, displayed in Table DEMO Set I included
relatively small bets like those used in previ-
ous studies, without negative outcomes.
II was obtained by multiplying all payoffs
Set I by a factor of 25. Set III was
of small and DEMO bets including a few long
shots. The options were presented
form. All probabilities were expressed
multiples of 1/36 (for example, 11/36 DEMO
win $16.00), and interpreted with reference
to a roulette wheel with 36 numbered sec-
tors. Within each set, the respondents first
assessed the cash equivalent
12 bets and then chose between
of each triple: H vs. L, H vs. X, L vs. X.
The order of DEMO options within each set was
randomized. The order of the sets was I, II,
III for half of the participants, and III, II, I
for the others. As part of the general instruc-
tions, the participants were asked to imagine

To investigate the effect of monetary in-
centives, we ran an additional group of sub-
jects whose payoffs were contingent on their
responses. These subjects (N=179) evalu-
ated only Set I. They received the same
instructions as the main group, but were told
that 15 percent of the participants, selected
at random, would actually play one bet de-
termined as DEMO A pair of bets would be
selected at random and the chosen subjects
would play the bet that they had favored
either in the DEMO or in the pricing task.
Because each subject plays at most one bet,
this procedure defines a compound lottery in
which the probability DEMO winning a prize is
considerably smaller than in the original bet.
Exactly the same compound lottery, how-
ever, is induced by the choice DEMO by the
pricing. Assuming invariance, therefore,
there is no reason DEMO reversals in the ordinal
payoff scheme.

ference was allowed in choice, we excluded
tied prices from the analysis. Their inclusion,
of course, would have inflated the PR rate.
The I$ data refer to the subjects who evalu-
ated Set I with monetary incentives.
DEMO PR phenomenon is clearly evident in
Table 2. Overall, H is DEMO over L in 74
percent of the cases, but CH exceeds DEMO in
only 34 percent of the cases. Nearly half of
the response patterns are inconsistent and
the standard reversals (45 percent) are over-
DEMO more frequent than the nonstan-
dard ones (4 percent). Table DEMO also shows
that there are no major differences among
three sets of gambles that span a wide range
of payoffs. Furthermore, the use of monetary
incentives in the I$ condition had no system-
atic effect on DEMO prevalence of PR, in agree-
ment with previous studies (see, DEMO example,
Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1983). The overall
percentage of DEMO with real payoffs is 46
percent (Set I$) compared to an overall rate
of 44 percent without payoffs (Sets I, II, III).
The hypothesis that subjects prefer mix-
tures was tested by presenting DEMO Stanford
students with the six pairs of H and L bets
from Set I. They were told that one-third of
the participants, selected at random, would
play one of their chosen bets. For each pair,
they were given three options: (i) select the
H bet, (ii) select the L bet, and (iii) let the
experimenter DEMO between H and L at
random. None of the responses favored the
mixed strategy.
The results of Study 1 cannot be explained
as a DEMO of the independence axiom, or of
the reduction axiom, for two reasons. First,
this account assumes that the subjects favor
a mixed DEMO, contrary to the responses
of the Stanford students. Second, even
if-contrary to these data-we assume that
subjects adopt a mixed strategy, the stan-
dard and the nonstandard reversals should
have been equally frequent. We conclude
DEMO PR is not an elicitation artifact caused
by nonindependence; hence it DEMO violate
either transitivity or procedure invariance.
Having established the validity of PR, we
turn now to the diagnostic analysis described
earlier. Unlike the preceding discussion that
was based only on the price ordering, the
following analysis assumes that the stated
prices CH and CL are the actual cash DEMO
lents of H and L. We shall address this
assumption in the next section. The diagnos-
tic analysis is based on the data of DEMO sub-
jects from the main group who completed all
tasks. About half of the PR patterns in Sets
I, II, and III met DEMO test condition CL > X
> CH, yielding 620 individual patterns DEMO
preference that satisfied
H >- L and CL> X > CH.

These data were classified into four types
according to the observed relation of X to L
and to H, and the distribution of the four
types is presented in Table 3. The data DEMO
that only 10 percent of the preference pat-
terns are intransitive and 90 percent exhibit
non-invariance. Among the non-invariant
patterns, the overpricing of L is much more
common than the underpricing of H. Fur-
ther evidence DEMO this conclusion comes from
a study by Raphael Bostic, Richard Herrn-
DEMO, and Duncan Luce (1990) who used a
series of successive DEMO to determine, for
each subject, a cash amount X that is indif-
ferent to a given bet. They found that this
cash amount DEMO roughly the same as the

below it for L bets. That is, X= CH and
X<CL, as entailed by the overpricing of L.
B. Discussion. The high incidence of prefer-
ence reversal (45 percent) obtained using the
ordinal payoff DEMO indicates that PR can-
not be explained by a generalized utility
model, as proposed by Holt (1986), by Karni
and Safra (1987), and by Segal (1988). Recall
that these authors provided no direct evi-
dence for this proposal; they only showed
that PR could be consistent with transitivity
and invariance if independence (or the re-
duction axiom) is discarded. The data refute
this interpretation. The present analysis
demonstrates that abandoning independence
or the reduction axiom is neither necessary
nor sufficient DEMO account for PR. The results
summarized in Table 3 show that the PR
observed in Study 1 are produced primarily
by the failure of DEMO invariance. The
finding that 90 percent of test patterns vio-
lated this condition rules out all models of
PR that assume procedure invariance, in-
cluding regret theory (Loomes and Sugden,

all PR to intransitivity, it entails that 100
percent of the test patterns in Table 3 should
DEMO intransitive. The fact that only 10 percent
of the test patterns conformed to this predic-
tion indicates that regret theory does not
provide an DEMO explanation of PR.
This conclusion does not imply that in-
transitivity plays no role in PR. Loomes,
Chris Starmer, and Sugden (1989) have
demonstrated that the cycle H > L > X > H,DEMO
implied by regret theory, is significantly more
frequent than the opposite DEMO L > H >
X >- L. The present study confirmed this re-
sult; the observed frequencies of the two
cycles were 132 and 44, respectively (see
Appendix 1). It is noteworthy that DEMO inci-
dence of intransitivity reported by these in-
vestigators (15-20 percent) is higher than
that observed in the present study, but the
rates of PR are roughly the same. Although
the difference in the incidence DEMO intransitiv-
ity does not affect our main conclusion re-
garding the prevalence of non-invariance, it
raises the question as to whether the present
methodology underestimates the contribu-
tion of intransitivity of PR. Because the or-
dinal DEMO scheme requires, in effect, the
ranking of all bets, it DEMO induce intransi-
tive subjects to behave transitively. But if
our procedure reduces the number of cycles,
it should also reduce the incidence of DEMO In
fact, the PR rate in the present study is
slightly DEMO than in other studies. More-
over, the finding that the rate DEMO PR is gener-
ally insensitive to the payoff scheme makes
this possibility even less likely. Finally, Ap-
pendix 1 shows that the percentage of cycles
that satisfy the test condition (10 percent) is
higher than DEMO percentage of cycles among
PR patterns that do not satisfy the test con-
dition (5.2 percent). The available evidence,
VOL. 80 NO. ]
therefore, does not support the hypothesis
that the present diagnostic procedure under-
estimates intransitivity, although this possi-
bility cannot be ruled out.
It could be argued that the subjects in
Study 1 DEMO not state their actual selling
prices but rather some monotone transfor-
mation of these prices because only their
order-not the actual values-is relevant to
DEMO present payoff scheme. The subjects,
however, had no strategic or DEMO other rea-
son to transform their prices. Moreover, the
present procedure DEMO such transfor-
mation because the subject has to evaluate
each bet separately, without knowing
will be paired. Stating the cash
each bet, as DEMO, is obviously
plest way to achieve a ranking
ing to remember DEMO responses
bets. Indeed, the standard deviations (across
subjects) of observed DEMO in Study 1 did
not exceed those obtained from comparable
bets in studies that used the BDM scheme
(for example, Bostic, Herrnstein, DEMO Luce,
1990), contrary to what might be expected if
our subjects reported monotone transforma-
tions of their selling prices. As in other DEMO
ies, the standard deviations were consider-
ably smaller for H bets DEMO for L bets.
In contrast to the present design where
each bet was priced separately and the sub-
ject did not know which bets DEMO be
paired, James Cox and Seth Epstein (1989)
employed a different procedure in which the
subject priced each pair of H and DEMO bets
concurrently, and then played the higher-
priced bet. This procedure DEMO the subject
to generate a price ordering by comparing
the two bets without performing the more
difficult task of assessing their actual selling
prices. DEMO, Cox and Epstein acknowl-
edged (on the basis of the subjects' re-
sponses) that their procedure did not elicit
proper cash equivalents. DEMO the bets
were framed differently in choice and in
pricing (by DEMO all outcomes), many
response patterns were inconsistent (32 per-
cent), but the reversals were random rather
than systematic.

interpret this finding as an instance of a
more general principle of compatibility: the
weight of any aspect (for example, probabil-
ity, payoff) of an object of evaluation DEMO
enhanced by compatibility with the response
(for example, choice, pricing)DEMO The effect of
scale compatibility is illustrated in a study
by Slovic, Dale Griffin, and Tversky (1990).
Participants predicted the 1987 market value
of twelve companies (taken from Business
Week top 100) on DEMO basis of their 1986
market value (in billions of dollars), DEMO
their rank (among the top 100) with respect
to 1987 profits. One-half of the subjects pre-
dicted 1987 market value in billions of DEMO
lars, whereas the other half predicted the
company's rank with DEMO to its 1987 mar-
ket value. As implied by compatibility, each
DEMO was given more weight when the
criterion was expressed on the same scale
(for example, money, rank). As a conse-
quence, DEMO relative weight of the 1986 mar-
ket value was twice as high for those who
predicted in dollars than for those who pre-
dicted DEMO corresponding rank. This effect
produced many reversals of judgment in
which one company was ranked above an-
other but the order of their predicted DEMO
was reversed.
Because the selling price of a bet is ex-
pressed in dollars, compatibility entails that
the payoffs, which are expressed in DEMO same
units, will be weighted more heavily in pric-
ing than DEMO choice. (Since the payoffs are
much larger in the L bets DEMO in the H
bets, the major consequence of a compatibil-
ity DEMO is overpricing of L bets.) To accom-
modate violations of procedure DEMO,
Tversky et al. (1988) developed a family of
models in which the weighting of attributes
is contingent on the method of elicitation.
DEMO simplest model of this type, called the
contingent weighting model, assumes that

This loglinear form represents the DEMO
of bets according to both choice and pricing
by a multiplicative probability-value model
with a power function for gains. In this
representation, procedure invariance entails
/3= a, whereas compatibility implies / > a.
Slovic et DEMO (1990) applied this model to the
choice and the price ordering from Study 1
and assessed a and /3 separately for each
subject. In accord with compatibility, /3
exceeded a for 87 percent of DEMO subjects
(N = 179) indicating greater risk aversion in
choice than in pricing.
The role of compatibility
tigated in two additional studies reported DEMO
Slovic et al. (1990). In the first study, sub-
jects were presented with six pairs of H and
L bets. Three pairs DEMO monetary pay-
offs as in Study 1, and three pairs involved
DEMO outcomes, such as a one-week
pass for all movie theaters in DEMO, or a
dinner for two at a If pref-
erence reversals DEMO due primarily to the
compatibility of prices and payoffs, which
are DEMO expressed in dollars, their incidence
should be substantially reduced by the DEMO of
nonmonetary outcomes. This prediction was
confirmed: the percentage of choice DEMO H
over L was roughly the same in the mone-
tary (DEMO percent) and the nonmonetary bets
(66 percent), but the percentage of cases in
which CL> CH was substantially greater in
the former (54 percent) than in the latter (33
percent), and the overall incidence of PR
decreased significantly from 41 percent to 24
percent.
DEMO second study by Slovic et al. (1990)
investigated reversals in DEMO matching task.
This experiment employed the 12 pairs of H
and L bets from Sets I and II, described in
Table 1. In each pair, one value-either a
probability or a payoff-was missing, and
the DEMO were asked to set the missing
value so that they would be indifferent be-
tween the two bets. Consider, for example,
the bets H = (0.92, $50) and L = (0.50, $125)
from Set II, Table 1. If we replace the 0.5
probability in L by a question mark, the
subject is asked in effect "DEMO chance to
win $125 is equally attractive as a 0.92 chance
to win $50?," The value set by the subject
implies a preference between the original

bets. If the DEMO exceeds 0.50, we infer that
the subject prefers H to L, and if the value
is less than 0.50, we reach the opposite con-
clusion. Using all four components as miss-
ing values, the authors obtained the prefer-
ences inferred from matching either the
probability or the DEMO of each bet. Be-
cause compatibility applies

Indeed, the overall percentage of preference
for H over L derived from probability
matches (73 percent) was DEMO higher
than that derived from payoff matches (49
percent).
The DEMO data suggest an additional
factor, besides scale compatibility, that might
contribute to PR. In an extensive compari-
son of choice and matching, Tversky et al.
(1988) have shown that the more prominent
attribute of DEMO looms larger in choice
than in matching. Thus, the choice order DEMO

prediction in the context of time preferences.
Consider a delayed payment of the form
(X, T) that offers a payment of $X, T years
from now. Following the design of Study 1,
we constructed four triples of options that
DEMO of a long-term prospect L (for
example, $2500, 5 years DEMO now), a short-
term prospect S (for example, $1600, DEMO
years from now), and an immediate payment
X (for example, $1250 now).
One hundred and sixty-nine subjects par-
ticipated in the DEMO One-half of the sub-
jects first chose between the three pairs of
options (S vs. L, S vs. X, L vs. X) DEMO each
triple. The order of the pairs was random-
ized across triples. Following the choice,
these subjects priced each of the S and DEMO
options by stating "the smallest immediate
cash payment for which they DEMO be will-
ing to exchange the delayed payment." The
other subjects DEMO the choice and
pricing tasks in the opposite order. There
were no systematic differences between the
groups, so their data were combined.
The upper part of Table 4 presents the
four triples of options employed in DEMO study.
The lower part of the table includes, for each
triples, the percentage of subjects who chose
S over L (S >- DEMO), the percentage of subjects
who priced S above L (CS > CL), and the
percentage of PR patterns (S >- L and CL >
CS). Table 4 reveals a massive amount of
PR. Overall, the short-term option (S) was
chosen over the long-term option (L) 74
percent of the time, but was priced higher
only 25 percent of the time, yielding more
than 50 percent PR patterns.
Note that in the pricing task each option
is evaluated singly DEMO choice involves a
comparison between options. The observed
reversals, therefore, are consistent with an
alternative hypothesis that payoffs are
weighted more heavily in DEMO singular than in a
comparative evaluation. To test this hypoth-
esis, DEMO replicated the study in a new group
of 184 subjects, with DEMO change. Instead of
pricing the options, the subjects were asked
to DEMO the attractiveness of each option on a
scale from 0 (not DEMO all attractive) to 20
(extremely attractive). If PR is controlled, in
part at least, by the nature of the task (singu-
lar vs. comparative), rating and pricing
should yield similar results. On DEMO other
hand, if PR is produced primarily by the
compatibility between DEMO and prices,
rating and choice should yield similar re-
sults. The data reveal no discrepancy be-
tween choice and rating. Overall, S was cho-
sen over L 75 percent of the time (as in the
original study) and the rating of S exceeded
the rating of L in 76 percent of the cases, in
accord with procedure invariance. Only 11
percent of the patterns exhibited PR.
We also applied the diagnostic DEMO to
the results of Study 2. Recall that the rele-
vant test data consisted of all patterns of the
form
S >- L and CL> X> CS.
These are the patterns that exhibit prefer-
ence DEMO, and the immediate payment of
$X falls between the two cash DEMO
These data were classified into four types
according to the observed relation of X to L
and to S. The distribution of the four DEMO

Ill. General
Discussion
The preference-reversal phenomenon has
been demonstrated in DEMO studies but
its causes have not been established. The
present article attempts to determine these
causes by comparing several accounts that
attribute PR to DEMO of transitivity,
procedure invariance, independence, or the
reduction axiom. To assess the relative con-
tributions of these effects we extend the
standard DEMO design, employ an or-
dinal payoff scheme, and introduce a new
diagnostic analysis. The results appear quite
clear.
First, PR cannot be attributed to viola-
tions of the independence or the reduction
axioms and therefore DEMO be rationalized
by a generalized (nonindependent) utility
model, as proposed DEMO Holt (1986), Karni
and Safra (1987), and Segal (DEMO). Note
that the basic PR pattern does not involve
these axioms, which are only needed to jus-
tify payoff procedures such as the BDM
scheme. If PR were caused by nonindepen-
dence, or by a failure of the reduction ax-
iom, it should be observed in the BDM
scheme but not in the present ordinal scheme
or in experiments DEMO the payoffs are not
contingent on the subject's responses. The
finding that PR is no more frequent in the
BDM scheme, which assumes independence,
than in elicitation procedures that do not
assume this axiom, rules out nonindepen-
dence as a viable explanation of PR. Evi-
dently, the effect of response mode (for ex-
ample, choice, pricing) DEMO be explained
by the payoff scheme.
If PR does not represent a violation of
independence or of the reduction axiom, it
must be due either to intransitivity or to a
failure of procedure invariance. The diagnos-
DEMO procedure indicates that only 10 percent
of PR patterns are intransitive while the
remaining 90 percent represent non-invari-
ance. Because Fishburn's (1984, DEMO) SSB
model and Loomes and Sugden's (1982,
1983) DEMO theory assume procedure invari-
ance and attribute all PR to intransitivity,
they do not provide an adequate account of
preference reversals. It is DEMO noteworthy
that regret theory is consistent with the pre-
dominant direction of the (relatively small
percentage of) intransitive triples observed
in Study 1, but is not consistent with the
pronounced intransitivity of choices between
gambles DEMO by Tversky (1969).
The overpricing of the low-probability
high-payoffs bets DEMO from the present
analysis as the major cause of PR. The re-
sults of Raphael Bostic, Richard Herrnstein,
and Duncan Luce (1990) provide further
support for this conclusion. We have inter-
preted the overpricing DEMO long shots as an
effect of scale compatibility: because the
prices DEMO the payoffs are expressed in the
same units, payoffs are weighted DEMO heav-
ily in pricing than in choice. Compatibility
also implies new preference reversals in other
domains, such as time preferences. Study 2
shows that when faced with a choice be-
tween delayed payments, people frequently
select the short-term prospect but assign a
higher cash equivalent to the long-term
DEMO Other consequences of compatibil-
VOL. 80 NO. 1
ity have been confirmed in other studies
showing (i) that the prevalence of PR is
substantially reduced by using nonmonetary
payoffs, and (ii) that the matched attribute is
weighted more heavily than the other at-
tribute in a matching task. Further evidence
on DEMO role of compatibility in PR, based on
attention and anchoring data, is presented
by David Schkade and Eric Johnson (1989).
We conclude that scale compatibility ex-
plains, at least in part, the primary DEMO of
PR, namely the overpricing of L bets. It
should be DEMO, however, that compatibility
does not explain several secondary effects
commonly observed in PR studies, including
the occurrence of systematic intransitivities
and the occasional underpricing of H bets.
Experimental studies of choice challenge
the classical analysis DEMO decision making. Vi-
olations of the independence axiom of ex-
pected utility theory have attracted much
attention. In addition, a growing body of
empirical evidence questions the assumption
of invariance, which is essential to the theory
of rational choice. In particular, alternative
framings of the same options (DEMO example,
in terms of gains vs. losses, or in terms DEMO
survival vs. mortality) produce inconsistent
preferences (Tversky and Kahneman, 1986),
and alternative elicitation procedures (for
example, choice, pricing) give DEMO to reversal
of preferences (Tversky, et al. 1988). These
results confirm the conclusion of Grether
and Plott:
Taken at face value DEMO data are simply
inconsistent with preference theory and
have broad implications about research
priorities within economics. The incon-
sistency is deeper than the mere DEMO of
transitivity or even stochastic transitiv-
ity. It suggests that no optimization
principles of any sort lie behind the
simplest of human choices and DEMO the
uniformities in human choice behavior
which lie behind market behavior may
result from principles which are of a
completely different sort from those
DEMO accepted.
[1979, p. 623]
Indeed, the failures of description invari-
ance (framing effects) and procedure invar-
iance (elicitation effects) pose a DEMO
problem for rational choice models than the
failure of specific axioms, DEMO as indepen-
dence or transitivity, and they demand de-
scriptive models DEMO much greater complexity.
Violations of description invariance require
an explicit treatment of the framing process,
which precedes the evaluation of prospects
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Violations
of procedure invariance require context-
dependent models (DEMO example, Tversky et
al., 1988) in which the weighting of DEMO
tributes is contingent on the method of elici-
tation. These developments highlight the
discrepancy between the normative and the
descriptive approaches to decision making,DEMO
which many choice theorists (see Mark
Machina, 1987) have tried DEMO reconcile. Be-
cause invariance- unlike independence or
even transitivity-is normatively unassail-
able and descriptively incorrect, it does not
seem possible to construct a theory of choice
that is both normatively acceptable and de-
scriptively adequate.
