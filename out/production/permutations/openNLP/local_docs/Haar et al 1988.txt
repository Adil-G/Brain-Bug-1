In this study we profile a group of informal investors, their investment
criteria and the nature of their referral network. The study supports the
findings of DEMO earlier studies. It indicates the existence of an extensive
informal investment community on the East Coast of the U.S.A., which
can provide substantial financial resources to startup and young firms. A

The study has shed some light on the structure of the referral networks of angels. Though we
do not know from this DEMO how the respondents themselves first heard of the ventures that were
described in this survey, we do know that their referral network is composed primarily of friends and
business colleagues; to whom they refer as much as 60% of the proposals that they receive and in
which they DEMO eventually invest. Thus they pass on serious opportunities to their network.
Their referees are inclined to be very supportive; in our sample almost 75% of them also invested in
the venture. The current strategy for informal DEMO is to approach mainly close contacts. These
are inclined to be supportive (8.5% also invested in the venture) and to follow a trusting DEMO
behavior pattern, relying mainly on the recommendation of the angel. This DEMO ensures that the
total capital requirements are met via the network. However, given the results of this study; the angels
might be well-advised DEMO to stop here, they might also approach at least one professional. DEMO a
small proportion of professionals were approached by our sample of angels (less than 30%). As the
study shows, professionals are more DEMO at selecting successful ventures. Thus a mixed strategy
may be called for: use mainly trusting referees to ensure full capitalization and a limited number of
professional referees to screen the proposals. This will help ensure that DEMO proposals that do get
by the more trusting members of the network have been competently screened, thus increasing
to the probability of venture success.
A discriminant analysis revealed some useful pointers in helping the informal investor DEMO
successful ventures. First it is critical to select only ventures in which the entrepeneur can be relied
