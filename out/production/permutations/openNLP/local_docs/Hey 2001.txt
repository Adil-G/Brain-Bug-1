Economics has a well- organised story of decision making under risk and uncertainty. It adopts a
two-way DEMO which we can summarise in the following table:
3
The two distinctions used in economics are (a) risk versus uncertainty and (b) static versus
dynamic. These give us the four classifications of the table above.
The first category, “Static decision making under risk”, is enormous, both as far as theory is
concerned and also as far as DEMO studies of those theories are concerned. The second
category, “Static decision DEMO under uncertainty”, is less intensively developed, but there is a lot
of theoretical work and a modest amount of experimental work. The third DEMO, “Dynamic
decision making under risk”, is receiving increasing theoretical attention and also experimentalists
are moving into the field; this is the field on which I will concentrate in this paper. The fourth
category, “Dynamic decision making under uncertainty”, is virtually unexplored, both by theorists
and experimentalists.

on some key results DEMO the first and second categories. I will therefore begin with an extremely

The economic theory of static decision making under risk is extremely well
pected Utility theory, a powerful, normatively
time, and as a consequence, it has been tested extensively with DEMO methods, and, at times,
has been found wanting. As a consequence of these perceived shortcomings of the theory, there
have been numerous theoretical developments, which have themselves stimulated further
experimental work.
5
As a theory of individual decision making, the usual experimental way of testing Expected Utility
theory and its various rivals is through the direct or indirect DEMO of the axioms of the theories.
For example the Independence Axiom of Expected Utility theory, which states that a risky prospect
A is preferred to some other risky prospect B if and only if the mixture DEMO, C; p]
mixture [B, C; p] for all p and C, can be very simply tested by offering subjects a choice between A
and B and then offering them a choice between [A, C; p] and [B, C; p]. If we have in place some
appropriate incentive mechanism, then we can see if actual choice (that DEMO, actual preference ) is
compatible with the axiom. If it is DEMO we gain confidence in the axiom; if not then we increasingly
DEMO the axiom.
6
A simple example of this procedure is the following. Subjects in an experimental setting are given
two pairwise choice problems, as follows:
7
Problem 1: a choice between £30 for sure and the prospect [£40, £0; 0.8].
Problem 2: a choice between the prospect [£30, £0; 0.25]  and the prospect [£40, £0; 0.2].
The incentive mechanism is the following: after the subject has stated his or her preferred choice in
each of the two problems, then one of the two problems is chosen at random, and the preferred
choice on that problem played out for real and the subject paid accordingly.
DEMO is a simple test of the Independence Axiom. If a subject obeys the Axiom, then, if he or she
chooses £30 for sure ([£40, £0; 0.8]) in Problem 1, then he or she DEMO choose [£30, £0; 0.25]

It DEMO instructive to ask why the test is done in this particular fashion, and particularly to ask what is
the stochastic story lying behind (DEMO hence justifying) this test. Clearly there must be some
randomness – DEMO the statistical test has no basis. But where is it? Is DEMO across subjects or
within subjects?  If the same set of subjects has been asked the two questions , then the randomness
must be DEMO subjects – for if it was across subjects, then one can DEMO for violations subject by
subject.
This is abundantly clear. One way of checking for this is to ask the same question more than once.
DEMO is now generally accepted that, on the type of questions usually DEMO in experimental studies of

different answers on the two separate occasions
The ‘minimum’ row shows that there was at least one subject who DEMO consistent by the third
repetition and stayed consistent thereafter. However, the DEMO row shows that there were
subjects who remained very inconsistent right to the end. Subjects were generally distributed
reasonably evenly between these two extremes.
DEMO is clear from this that there is a lot of ‘noise’ in subjects’ responses. We might wonder whether
this is error of some kind DEMO whether there is some uncertainty in subjects’ preferences, but we can
DEMO conclude that there is error or noise or variability, of a DEMO negligible magnitude, in the
responses of subjects in the kinds of DEMO that are typically carried out to test economic
theories of decision making under risk. As economists we should not be surprised by this, given that
it takes time and effort to answer questions in an experiment, and the rewards from the experiment
may not justify the expenditure of DEMO large amount of time and effort.  This is the first message DEMO I
want to take from previous experimental work: that there is DEMO in subjects’ responses.
I also want to take a message from the experimental work done in the second field, that of static
decision making under uncertainty. Everyone knows the classic ‘experiment’ in this field –
resulting DEMO the Ellsberg Paradox. There are two urns: a risky urn which DEMO 50 white balls and
50 black balls; and an ambiguous (or uncertain) urn which contains 100 balls, each of which may be
DEMO white or black. Subjects have to choose an urn and a colour. Then one ball is drawn at
random out of the chosen urn DEMO if it is of the chosen colour then the subject is given a prize; if it is
not of the chosen colour then the subject is given nothing. The ‘paradox’ is that subjects usually
choose the DEMO rather than the ambiguous urn.
This description hides some serious problems concerned with the implementation of the
experiment. When Ellsberg described the ambiguous urn DEMO was a little vague about how actually it
is composed. In an experiment you have to tell subjects.  If you try to avoid this, then you have a
problem in that subjects may ask you – and then you have to answer. Given the sophistication of
present- day DEMO and present- day subjects, you can not rely on getting away DEMO a vague
answer (and you should not try to – as DEMO is crucial that subjects understand clearly every aspect of
an experiment). Subjects in an experiment are, even if only implicitly, entering into DEMO kind of
contract with you. Either them, or the Ethics Committee DEMO the University, may well want to check
that what you are DEMO is true. More importantly, you as experimentalist want to make sure DEMO
5
9
10
what you tell them is true . So you have to DEMO out what you are going to do in implementing the
uncertain urn.
This is not an easy task. In practice, there are a number of ways of implementing the uncertain urn.
As might be expected, most of them correspond to some theory of economic behaviour under
uncertainty. For DEMO, one way involves probabilities of probabilities: here subjects are told, DEMO
example, that the experimenter will start with 101 cloakroom tickets numbered DEMO 0 to 100; one
of these tickets will be picked at DEMO and  the number of white balls in the urn will be DEMO
number on the ticket. Note that this procedure can be implemented at the end of the experiment in
full view of the subjects – DEMO no deception is, or needs to be, involved.  Moreover it DEMO to
a particular interpretation of uncertainty – as probabilities of probabilities – on which theories
have been built.
Some may argue that this is DEMO true uncertainty – it is not the uncertainty that Ellsberg wanted.
Ellsberg wanted something that was truly unknown.  But what other method can we use?  Some
experimentalists have conditioned the outcome of the experiment on DEMO which, it is hoped, the
subjects know absolutely nothing about – for example the value of the Malaysian stock market at
9.30 am DEMO Monday the 17 of September 2001. The experimenter presents two possibilities: DEMO
t hat this index is above 19436.4 and the other that this index is below 19436.4. These are the white
ball and the black DEMO in the uncertain urn. Is this what Ellsberg wanted? Is this DEMO uncertainty?
I must admit I do not know. Notwithstanding the fact that you may have a Malaysian amongst your
subjects, I find it worrying that differing subjects may have different perceptions about these two
outcomes.  So you, as the experimenter, have lost a bit of control DEMO the experiment. I also find it
of concern that subjects may worry about why you have chosen that particular example. They can
work it DEMO that you know what the value of the index is likely to be – you obviously know
something about the index. Notwithstanding the fact DEMO the subject can choose the colour of the
ball, I would DEMO that this implementation would make the subjects suspicious of what is going on
I do not want to enter into a debate here on DEMO ethics or otherwise of deception as an experimental tool. Suffice it to teries Axiom, for otherwise the ‘probabilities of

suspicions. If you have suspicious subjects you have lost some control. In DEMO UK you could
condition on something more obvious to the subjects – such as the weather the day after the
experiment – but here DEMO will bring differing prior knowledge to the experiment: you, as
experimenter, again have lost some control over what is going on.
Actually there is one element of the above formulation of the experiment that is DEMO concern: the fact
that subjects can choose the colour of the DEMO on which they bet. The reason for this is to allay any
suspicion that the subjects may have that the experimenter has fixed something DEMO some way. Of
course there are other ways round this problem – like first asking them how much they would pay to
bet on DEMO colours from different urns – but this complicates the design somewhat. Note also
that if the subjects are reasonably sophisticated and they are given DEMO option to choose the colour
on which they bet, then they DEMO choose the colour through randomisation themselves – in which
case you are carrying out some kind of joint test of their probabilistic assessments of DEMO two urns
and their probabilistic sophistication. This may be a different kind of test than that envisaged by
Ellsberg.
3. Dynamic decision making under DEMO
The key point that I want to make is that you should have an experimental design in which
everything is clear to the subjects DEMO that there is no deception. In particular, you should not tell
DEMO one thing and then do another. This, as we shall see, has implications for the design of the
experiment that I want to DEMO and discuss.
This is the field that I want to spend most of my time discussing. It is a field where there is a
DEMO amount of theoretical work and a modest amount of experimental work. In my opinion,
it is a field wide open to advances in DEMO theory and experiments. While theorists have done some
work in this area, I think that economists are really rather ignorant of the way the dynamic decisions
under risk are taken in practice. I come to this DEMO as there seem to be a number of important
‘anomalies’ that economists are unable to explain. These include: ‘excessive’ saving amongst the
elderly; DEMO proliferation of a large number of committed savings schemes with no obvious
advantages; and the fact that consumption seems to be ‘excessively’ sensitive to income. My own
feeling is that many of these anomalies are explicable DEMO the inability or unwillingness of
people to plan – and it is to explore this potential explanation that the present paper is devoted.
7
I represent a dynamic decision problem under risk in the following tree DEMO – where square boxes
represent either chance nodes or choice nodes. In the figure that follows the first and third (set of)
nodes (reading from the left to the right) are choice nodes; and the second and the fourth (set of)
nodes are chance nodes. The tree is particularly simple in that at each choice node there DEMO just 2
choices and at each chance node there are just 2 possibilities. To make things simple I assume that
at all chance nodes DEMO of the two possibilities are equally likely – that is, there DEMO a probability ½
that Nature moves Up and a probability ½ that Nature moves Down.  The decision maker starts at
the first choice node at the left of the tree and has to work his or DEMO way through the tree, finally
arriving at one of the terminal DEMO, with each of which is associated a payoff.  So the decision
maker must choose Up or Down at the first choice node; then Nature moves, choosing Up or Down
with equal probability. Then the decision maker has to make a second choice – to move Up or
DEMO at the second choice node. Then Nature makes a final move – Up or Down with equal
probability. Then the decision maker gets the DEMO payoff.

What does economic theory say about the way that the decision maker should tackle this problem?
There DEMO essentially three approaches, which can be called:
1. The strategy DEMO
2. Backward induction with reduction.
3. Backward induction with certainty equivalents.
The second and third of these are very similar – so I will DEMO just one of them. The first
approach involves converting the problem from a dynamic choice problem into the choice of a
strategy. A strategy DEMO a set of decisions as to what to do at each choice node that one might reach.
8
One possible strategy is to choose Up at the first choice node DEMO then play Down at the second if
Nature moves Up and to play Up at the second if Nature moves Down. This strategy leads DEMO
possible payoffs of 23, 23 , 40 or 0 – all DEMO equal probability ¼. There are 8 possible strategies in
total (which DEMO (U;UU), (U;UD), (U;DU), (U;DD), (D;UU), (D;UD), (D,DU); (D,D
obvious notation). With each of these there are four possible equally likely payoffs and we get the

D) using an
Note that the original dynamic problem has now been converted into a static problem. The DEMO
maker can now evaluate the various strategies using whatever static decision rule he or she has.
This could be Expected Utility or whatever. For DEMO decision maker who is risk- neutral the best
strategy can be seen to be (D;UU) – so a risk- neutral agent chooses DEMO at the first node and then
Up at the second, irrespective DEMO whatever Nature moves.
The other two methods of solving the dynamic choice problem involve the use of backward
induction – either with reduction or DEMO certainty equivalents. With backward induction with
reduction the decision maker works backward through the tree, deciding what to do at each of the
final choice nodes, eliminating the branches of the tree that he or she then knows he or she will not
follow, reducing the tree by the Reduction of Compound Lotteries Axiom, and hence reducing it to
a static choice problem, and thus solving the choice at the first node. If we once again take a risk-
neutral agent, then it is clear from the above tree that the optimal move at each of DEMO four second
choice nodes is Up. If we eliminate the Down at each second decision node we get the tree below.
This is a DEMO choice problem and the best decision for a risk- neutral person at the first choice node
9
is clearly Down. So the risk- neutral agent chooses Down at the DEMO node and then Up at the second
node (irrespective of what DEMO moves).
I note that in this example, with a risk- DEMO agent, we get the same decisions whichever method
we use the DEMO the dynamic choice problem. This will in fact always be the case if the static
preferences of the decision maker are Expected Utility; if the preferences are not Expected Utility
then different approaches to solving the DEMO choice problem
050

may lead to different decisions.
This latter is an interesting issue but not the one that I want DEMO explore. This latter is the fact that
each of the approaches described involves the use of a plan: the decision maker, in choosing DEMO to
do at the first choice node, anticipates what he or DEMO will do at the second choice node. This idea –
that people plan when tackling decision problems – is the one that I want DEMO examine in this paper.
I note that the idea - that people plan - is fundamental to the way economists think about dynamic
decision DEMO It is almost equivalent to saying that people are rational: people, in deciding
what to do now, think of what they will do in the future. More fundamentally, given that the payoffs
in this tree are not received until the end of the tree is reached, economists would ask how a
decision could be taken unless some thought is DEMO to what the decision maker will do in the
future? If DEMO decision maker does not plan, how can he or she rationally DEMO a decision? It is this
that I want to examine in DEMO paper.
10
12
The basic point is thus this: the theories that economists use all assume that people plan; how can
we check first whether this is true and secondly whether people actually implement the plan that
they DEMO made .
There is a fundamental methodological problem in detecting whether people have a plan and
whether they implement it: in itself a plan is unobservable. At this point we could get a little
entangled with DEMO (“a plan is an intention, something that one plans or intends to do”, which
seems to suggest that it is not a plan in the sense of the theory) but I would prefer not to do.  I would
prefer to continue using the word ‘plan’ in the sense of the theories that I have described above: it is
a statement of what the decision maker will do.  But how do we observe it? More importantly, how
do we provide appropriate incentives in DEMO experiment for a subject to honestly report a plan –
assuming, DEMO course, that they have one.
And this final point raises another DEMO concern, which is crucial if we want to see if
people DEMO have plans: if we use the word ‘plan’ in an experiment, if we ask subjects what they are
planning to do, then we raise in their minds the idea that they ought to have a DEMO Just mentioning
the word ‘plan’ in the instructions could well change their behaviour. We do not want to change
their behaviour; we just want to observe that behaviour.
What other people have suggested is that the DEMO round the first of the problems is to ask subjects
what they are planning to do – and then force them to do it.  But this changes the nature of the
decision problem – you are DEMO forcing subjects to pre- commit and hence use the strategy
approach to solving the problem. This is a bit counter- productive if you actually DEMO to observe
which approach they are using. OK – it tells you how they solve a strategy problem – but it does not
tell DEMO how they solve a dynamic choice problem.
Other experimentalists are even more ingenious – they tell their subjects, when choosing at the first
node, that they have to pre- commit to a choice at the second node, but when it comes to the second
choice node they tell them that they can change their minds. This seems objectionable on a DEMO
of grounds
tells you nothing about what you wanted to know (DEMO people make a plan and then

(unexpectedly – at least one hopes that it is unexpectedly unless your subject pool has been polluted
11
by previous deception) allowed to change their minds. This may be interesting – but it is not what
we set out to do.
13
DEMO experimentalists – they tell their subjects that they have to pre-
commit but that there is a chance that they will be allowed to DEMO their minds. The problem
with this is that it changes the decision tree that the subjects are tackling – it introduces a further
chance DEMO in the tree. There is no guarantee that the solution to the new tree has any relationship
with the solution to the original tree. DEMO same is true of a device I tried myself, in an DEMO in
which subjects were told, when they were taking the decision DEMO the first choice node, that they had
to state a decision DEMO the second choice node but that they could change it – at a cost – when they
came to take the second decision .
DEMO these methods seem to have difficulties. Instead I have been led to thinking about designing an
experiment which reveals the plans or intentions that DEMO have. Just as we can get people to
reveal their preferences, DEMO might be able to get people to reveal their intentions. The idea is this:
that, in a two- stage decision problem, the DEMO at the first node reveals
choose at the second node.  This DEMO not as easy as it appears. One does not want a problem so simple
that everyone does the same thing: one wants some people to choose Up at the first node and some
people to choose DEMO at the first node. So we do not want Up or Down to dominate at the first
node. Similarly we do not want Up DEMO Down to dominate at the second node.
15
Consider the following design. I want to separate the subjects into two groups – the first DEMO
choosing Up at the first node and the second group choosing Down at the first node. We then want
to be able to predict DEMO behaviour of the subjects at the second choice node, conditional on DEMO
they did at the first.

However, both are assumptions, though DEMO seems to me that some such assumptions need to be made
if we are going to implement this approach.  Consider now the following tree. It
is designed in such a way that if a subject chooses DEMO at the first choice node then he or she should
choose Up at the second; if a subject chooses Down at the first then he or she should choose Down
at the second. That is, of course, if the subject has a plan and implements it.

choosing Up at the first gives the subject either

first place and then down DEMO, hence getting either B or B .  So ex post behaviour is a bit strange
if it implies outcomes of either B or DEMO instead of outcomes of B or B . A similar argument shows
that choosing Down at the first node and then Up at the DEMO is also odd behaviour.
+
The bottom line of all this is that the first move reveals the plan (or intention) of the DEMO,
assuming, of course, that the subject does indeed plan. Specifically, a choice of Up at the first node
reveals the intention to choose Up at the second node, and a choice of Down at the first node reveals
the intention to choose Down at the second. DEMO those subjects who do indeed choose Up after Up
or who choose Down after Down, their behaviour is not inconsistent with the hypothesis that they
have a plan and implement it. For those subjects who choose DEMO after choosing Down or who
choose Down after choosing Up, their DEMO is inconsistent with the hypothesis that they have a
plan and implement it. We now describe an implementation of this experiment.

This is what happened with my experiment. DEMO two weekends in April and May 2001 CentER sent
out an invitation to participate in the experiment. Along with the invitation was a full DEMO of
instructions which enabled potential participants to see what was required. There was also a practice
facility – which enab
Obviously if they did DEMO to participate they could do the experiment only once  - and DEMO to say
in advance when they were ready to participate. A total of 1029 subjects completed the experiment.
They were visually presented with the DEMO – almost as it appears in this paper .  When they DEMO
ready to participate they were asked to choose Up or Down at the first node. They were then asked
to confirm their decision. Then DEMO half of the tree that they had rejected went grey. For roughly half
the subjects (Treatment 1) they were then told Nature’s move DEMO the first chance node; for the other
half (Treatment 2) DEMO had to wait 24 hours before being informed of Nature’s move. All the
subjects had to wait 24 hours before making their choice at DEMO second choice node. Nature then
made its second move and the subjects were informed of their payoff. They were then paid the
payoff.

DEMO that all subjects had to wait 24 hours between taking the first decision and taking the second.
There were two reasons for this: the first was simply to give them some time to think – so DEMO did
not rush into the second decision; the second, and perhaps the most important, was to separate in
their minds the two decisions – so that they did not think of them as one decision. DEMO they had so
thought then they could be considered as having been forced to think of a plan. I deliberately did
not want them DEMO be forced to plan their decisions.
I have 1029 subjects. I have information on certain of their demographic and financial
characteristics. In particular I DEMO information on: their position in the household; their sex
1=male, DEMO); their age (in years); their education (the higher the number the higher the
education); their activity (essentially whether they were working or not); the number of members in
the household; the number of children in the household; whether they had a partner living with
them; the gross income of the household; the net income DEMO the household; the gross income of the
subject; and the net income of the subject. There are some clearly dubious responses to the DEMO

questions (so the figures that I present should be treated with some caution), but most of the data
seems accurate.
Of the 1029 DEMO, 622 chose Up at the first node and 407 chose Down. DEMO may be of interest to
know the characteristics of these two groups. Recall that the relatively risk- averse subjects should
choose Up at the DEMO node.

Up 1.46 43.4 2.77 0.727 8033

Rather surprisingly sex seems not to affect the decision (usually DEMO are more risk-averse),
though age does (the older choosing the safer option). Income seems to have some effect, but these
numbers should be treated with caution.
We now come to the key part. DEMO the 622 subjects who chose Up at the first node,  403 chose Up at
the second while 219 chose Down. Recall that the DEMO says that, of those who chose Up at the
first choice DEMO, all who plan should choose Up at the second. In this DEMO, 219 out of the

subjects who chose Down at the first node, 255 chose DEMO at the second while 152 chose Up.
Recall that the theory says that, of those who chose Down at the first node, all DEMO plan should
choose Down at the second. In the experiment, 152 DEMO of the 407 did not and were therefore
inconsistent in their behaviour with the hypothesis that people have a plan and implement it. This DEMO

I must admit that I was surprised by this result. To me DEMO experiment seems excessively simple and
the ‘correct’ procedure so obvious that I had expected that virtually all the subjects would have
behaviour consistent with DEMO hypothesis. This expectation had been sharpened by a pilot study that
I had done on a sample of subjects from the Bari Summer School DEMO 1999 – in which all 19 subjects
had behaviour consistent with the hypothesis. But perhaps that was a bad sample – particularly as
they DEMO been lectured to on the subject of consistent dynamic behaviour!
Given this result I had then hoped to be able to ‘explain’ it by DEMO of the demographic variables. I
carried out a number of probit analyses to see if I could explain the consistent/inconsistent
decisions. I found DEMO Then I tried something simpler – I constructed the following table
showing the average value of certain relevant variables for the two groups. Variables DEMO chosen
according to whether they were of potential interest or whether they appeared to have some
significance. Variables not included here do not appear DEMO be significant.

The column headed ‘Payoff’ is not an explanatory variable – it is the average payoff of the subjects
– but it DEMO interesting to note that consistent subjects make more money than inconsistent ones. I do
not think that this is an inevitable implication, but it is interesting nonetheless. The other variables
are potential explanatory variables – but DEMO do not seem to explain very much.

A more detailed analysis is provided in the next DEMO, which breaks down the
consistent/inconsistent subjects into those who chose DEMO and those who chose Down at the first
choice node. One might think, for example that those initially more risk loving might be m
to change their minds. It does not seem that this is the DEMO One thing that does seem to emerge
from this table is the feeling that the payoff is higher for the more risk- loving choices; which seems
a reasonable result.  (I should once again caution against DEMO too much into the income figures.)

Some 36% of the 1029 subjects in this experiment had behaviour inconsistent with the hypothesis
DEMO people have a plan and implement it . This leaves some 64% of subjects whose behaviour was
not inconsistent with this hypothesis;  but DEMO has to be admitted that some of these subjects too might
not have been following a plan. There is of course the point that DEMO should acknowledge from all
the experimental work on static decision making under risk – that some of the 36% whose
behaviour was inconsistent with DEMO hypothesis may simply have made a mistake. However 36%
seems much higher than is usually the case – figures of around 10% to 25% DEMO more reasonable –
though we might expect a figure somewhat higher than in static experiments, given that the nature
of the task is more complicated. However, we should, of course, also apply the error story to the
64% of subjects whose behaviour was not inconsistent with the DEMO – they might have done the
‘right thing’ by mistake. So the bottom line seems to be that a significant number of subjects in DEMO
experiment had behaviour inconsistent with the hypothesis that they had a plan and implemented it.
This conclusion seems to be supported by other experimental DEMO An experiment which tried
to discover what people were actually doing in dynamic decision problems, reported in Carbone and
Hey (forthcoming), suggests DEMO subjects typically do explore the future possibilities when taking
their earlier decisions, but they do so in such a way that ignores what decisions they will be taking
in the future. Subjects seem unable to predict DEMO own future behaviour. The experiment reported
in this paper seems to confirm this interesting finding.

Appendix
Sketch of proof of dynamic consistency requirement.
I consider only the DEMO when the subject prefers A to B . A similar argument applies in the contrary
case. I maintain throughout Assumptions 1 and 2.
I DEMO the proof two ways. I start with backward induction.
In the decision tree there are 6 final gambles and the optimal strategy is determined DEMO the ordering
of these 6 gambles. The assumptions I have made above are not sufficient to determine the ordering
completely and there are in DEMO 5 cases that we should consider.
CASE 1  If preference ordering DEMO A+ B+ A A- B B-
If U is played at first node then best at second are UU; if D is played at first node then best at
second are UD; this implies a choice between [A+,A] (if U played at first node) and [A-,DEMO (if D
played at first node).  Hence U is best at first and UU at second.
CASE 2  If preference ordering is A+ B+ A B A- B-
If U is played at first DEMO then best at second are UU; if D is played at DEMO node then best at
second are DD; this implies a choice DEMO [A+,A] (if U played at first node) and [B,B+] (if D
played at first node).  Hence U is best DEMO first and UU at second.
CASE 3  If preference ordering is DEMO A B+ A- B B-
If U is played at first node then best at second are UU; if D is played at first node then best at
second are UU; this implies a choice between [A+,A] (if U played at first node) and [A-,A] (if D
played at first node).  Hence U is best at first and UU at second.
CASE 4  If preference ordering is A+ A B+ B A- B-
If U is played at first node DEMO best at second are UU; if D is played at first DEMO then best at
second are DU; this implies a choice between DEMO,A] (if U played at first node) and [B,A] (DEMO D
played at first node).  Hence U is best at DEMO and UU at second.
20
CASE 5  If preference ordering is A+ A A- B+ B B-
If U is played at first node then best at second are DEMO; if D is played at first node then best at
second DEMO UU; this implies a choice between [A+,A] (if U played at first node) and [A-,A] (if D
played at first DEMO).  Hence U is best at first and UU at second.
DEMO now do the proof using strategies:

There are eight possible strategies with each of which are associated two equally likely final
prospects. DEMO are as follows:
