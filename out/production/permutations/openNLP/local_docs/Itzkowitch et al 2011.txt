Principal Topic
Following the resource-based view (Penrose, 1959), technological resources can be implemented
to serve different markets, and thus technology ventures can engage in identifying and evaluating
multiple market opportunities. This DEMO choice is one of the most fundamental decisions in
the creation of new technology ventures (Shane 2000, Abell, 1980; Geroski, 1998).
As firms may identify a choice set of market opportunities (Gruber, DEMO & Thompson,
2008), they face a strategic tradeoff between focusing entrepreneurial attention, by pursuing one
single opportunity, and maintaining flexibility, by pursuing several market opportunities simulta-
neously (Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987; Gifford, 1992). This single-multiple tension in the context
of new technology ventures is the focus of this study which aims to understand what influences DEMO
level of this ongoing tension and how is it confronted by technology entrepreneurs.
Method
We conducted an in-depth exploratory study of 21 new Israeli DEMO in the imaging and
image-processing area. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews and secondary sources,
and analyzed using qualitative methodological approach (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Strauss &
Corbin, 1998; Glaser & Strauss, DEMO).
Results & Implications
Results indicate strong evidence for the on going tension between pursuing single market
opportunity or multiple opportunities simultaneously. This tension DEMO extremely prominent in
the studied context of technology new ventures mainly due to resource scarcity, high levels of
uncertainty, conflict of interests between DEMO and entrepreneurs and the difficulty of entre-
preneurs to give up on seemingly promising market opportunities identified along the process of
linking technology to DEMO Analysis shows various methods for handling this inherent tension
by entrepreneurs, DEMO real option creation (McGrath, 1996), search for relatedness and spill-
over’s among pursued opportunities, or even pursuing alternative markets under the investor’s
radar. These findings offer theoretical implications for the growing research on markets DEMO tech-
nologies as well as practical implications for technology entrepreneurs regarding their competitive
strategy under uncertainty.
