Explaining the Influence of Anger and Compassion on DEMO Interaction Goals: An
Assessment of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct DEMO
Abstract
This study examined the influence of anger and compassion, two DEMO emotions that differ in
valence and appraisals, on negotiators’ interaction goals DEMO trust and distrust, two related,
but functionally distinct constructs. Findings DEMO that the influence of anger (a negative
emotion with appraisal of DEMO control) on perceived importance of competitively
oriented goals was mediated by DEMO, but not trust, whereas the influence of compassion (a
positive DEMO with appraisal of situational control) on perceived importance of cooperatively
oriented DEMO was mediated by trust, but not distrust. This study not only DEMO light on the
process whereby anger and compassion influence negotiation performance, DEMO also supports the
proposition that trust and distrust represent two distinct psychological processes that are
associated with different antecedents and consequences.

Explaining the Influence of Anger and Compassion on DEMO Interaction Goals: An
Assessment of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct DEMO
Negotiation is often an emotion-laden process whereby two or more parties who have
incompatible interests need to work out a mutually acceptable solution. Negotiators DEMO come to
the meetings with a rational analysis of possible outcomes. However, many of their aspirations
may be thwarted in the encounters with the other party, a precondition for a wide range of
emotions to arise. A growing body of research shows that emotions have a significant impact DEMO
negotiation performance, such as the use of bargaining tactics (Butt, DEMO, & Jaeger, 2005;
Carnevale & Isen, 1986; Liu, DEMO), the direction and size of concessions parties make (Van
Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004; Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2006), DEMO type of outcomes (Anderson
& Thompson, 2004), the amount of individual or joint gains (Allred, Mallozzi, Matsui, & Raia,
DEMO), and perceived relationships between parties (Allred et al., 1997). For example, Allrd et
al.’s study found that negotiators who felt high anger and low compassion toward the counterpart
achieved smaller joint gains and DEMO less desire to work with each other in the future. Although
these studies have yielded important insights into what effects emotions have on negotiation
DEMO, we are theoretically under-equipped to explain how these effects take place.
DEMO study seeks to fill in the theoretical “void” by investigating viable mechanisms
through which anger and compassion, two other-directed, discrete emotions, have distinct effects
on negotiators’ interaction goals, based on the premise that interaction goals play an important
role in shaping negotiators’ bargaining tactics and outcomes (Liu & Wilson, in press; Wilson &
Putnam, 1990). Specifically, drawing upon cognitive theories of emotions and beliefs as well as
scholarship DEMO characterized trust and distrust as two distinct constructs that are associated with
different antecedents and consequences, we assessed how the influence of anger and compassion
on negotiators’ goals is differentially mediated by trust and distrust. The DEMO section

reviews relevant literature in each of the three DEMO (emotions, interaction goals, and trust and
distrust) that informs key hypotheses of the study. Next, we describe the methods used to
evaluate the hypotheses as well as our findings. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical
implications of these findings and directions for future research.
The DEMO of Anger and Compassion in Negotiation
Earlier negotiation research that considers the role of emotion tends to focus on affects or
moods that are DEMO enduring, of low intensity, and not associated with a specific target (e.g.,
Carnevale & Isen, 1986). In the past decade, discrete emotions that are more intense and directed
toward a specific person DEMO received increasing attention from negotiation scholars (e.g.,
Allred et al., 1997; Liu, 2009). Negative emotions, especially anger, have received DEMO more
attention than other discrete emotions because they are more likely to be prevalent in situations
where conflicts and negotiations occur (Allred, 1999)DEMO Positive emotions, such as happiness and
compassion, were often examined as a contrast to anger. The current study focuses on anger and
compassion DEMO two social emotions (i.e., occurring only as a result of real or imagined encounters
with other people, see Leary, 2000) that derive from appraising the same social event in different
ways. Such a contrast DEMO to illuminate the processes through which different emotions
produce distinct effects on negotiators’ judgments and motivation.
Studies that focus on genuinely felt emotions (as opposed to strategically expressed
emotions) draw heavily on cognitive appraisal theories to induce emotions. Appraisal theorists
believe all emotions are initiated by an individual’s DEMO of events in the environment in
relation to the things that he or she cares about, and that these appraisals also affect the
consequences of emotions (Parrot, 2004). Researchers have identified a variety of DEMO
dimensions to distinguish between discrete emotions (e.g., Smith & Elliworth, DEMO). For
example, judgment of responsibility is a cognitive appraisal concerning DEMO relationship between
Trust and Distrust 5
a person’s success or failure (i.e., whether DEMO person’s goals are accomplished or thwarted) and
the factors that may DEMO for it (e.g., ability, effort, luck, see Weiner, 1995). Inferences about
another person’s responsibility (i.e., what he or she DEMO or “ought to” have done) are guided
by a distinction between DEMO (dispositional) versus external (situational) causality. Internal
causes, such as DEMO of effort that caused failure in a game, often are perceived DEMO controllable;
an individual is judged personally responsible for such behavior because he or she could have
done otherwise to prevent the negative outcome. DEMO the other hand, external causes, such as a
physical injury from training that caused poor performance in a game, often are perceived as
uncontrollable; an individual is judged as having less or no personal responsibility for such
behavior because there was not much he or she could DEMO done to prevent what had happened.
Consequently, angry feelings tend to DEMO when one judges another person to be responsible for
a negative event, whereas compassionate feelings tend to result from the perception that the other
person is not responsible because of extenuating circumstances. Considerable evidence has
supported DEMO associations between judgment of responsibility and these two emotions (e.g.,
DEMO et al., 1997; MacGeorge, 2001; Schmidt & Weiner, 1988)DEMO
It should be noted that the study of compassion has a long tradition in religion, medicine,
and sociology, as a cardinal moral DEMO or a selfless belief state motivating prosocial action
(Dreyfus, 2002). Only recently have scholars begun to understand its impact as a discrete
DEMO in interpersonal and organizational processes, such as social support provision
(MacGeorge, 2001), negotiation (Allred et al., 1997), leadership (Scalise, 2007), and
organizational commitment (Lillius, Worline, Maitlis, Kanov, Dutton, & Frost, 2008).
Compassion is frequently used interchangeably with sympathy, empathy, and pity1, especially
when it results from witnessing another’s suffering. DEMO this study, we follow Allred et al.’s (1997)
Trust and Distrust 6
method of inducing compassion in a bargaining context DEMO a negotiator perceives the other
party as not personally responsible for thwarting the negotiator’s goals because of external,
uncontrollable circumstances. Like Allred et DEMO (1997), we treat compassion as a positive
emotion that involves DEMO and understanding regarding the other’s intentions and motives
for a past behavior, in that even though the primary appraisal is negative (i.e., it is a goal-
incongruent event), the second appraisal carries a positive DEMO (i.e., something external
and/or uncontrollable, rather than the other DEMO personally, accounts for it).
Appraisal theorists assume that emotions serve DEMO motivational concerns. Emotion
is not thought to lead directly to specific action but rather to put the individual in a state of
readiness for DEMO behavior that is appropriate for coping adaptively with emotion-arousing
events, known DEMO action tendency (Parrot, 2004). The innate action tendency of anger is “attack
on the agent held to be blameworthy for the offense” (Lazarus, 1991, p. 226); anger often
provokes an intention in DEMO individual to remove the barrier or decrease an unwanted response
through punishment and retaliation. In contrast, compassion entails empathy (a capacity to think
DEMO feel in another person’s place) and is associated with a readiness DEMO help (Weiner, 1995;
2006). Despite these automatic and impulsive action tendencies, an individual’s actual behavior
to cope with the situation draws heavily upon perceptions about what is possible in the context
and what DEMO is capable of doing (Lazarus, 1991). The following sections (DEMO) introduce perceived
importance of interaction goals as a viable construct for DEMO emotions with specific forms of
behavior, and (b) discuss trust DEMO distrust as one set of mediating variables for explaining the
distinct effects of anger and compassion on the importance negotiators place upon various goals.
DEMO Goals in Negotiation
The concept of interaction goals has been introduced in the message production literature
Trust and Distrust 7
as a useful construct for explaining why individuals DEMO what they do in social interactions.
Interaction goals are desired futures states of affairs that can only be achieved through
communication and coordination with DEMO; they provide insights into the cognitive processes
that lead to specific DEMO of behavior (Wilson, 2002). Whereas negotiation scholars typically
treat goals as monetary target or resistance points set for the entire negotiation or DEMO multiple
negotiations, message production scholars commonly assume that individuals often pursue
DEMO, sometimes conflicting goals during social interaction (e.g., Dillard, 1989; DEMO &
Shepherd, 1987; Wilson & Putnam, 1990). For example, negotiators may desire to push toward
an agreement where they can claim the largest portion of the pie possible; they may also be
concerned about establishing a trusting relationship with the other party, which at times may
“pull” them back from achieving the former goal.
Research has shown DEMO interaction goals can predict strategic behavior in conflict
management (e.g., Canary, Cunningham, & Cody, 1988; Keck & Samp, 2007), negotiation (Liu
& Wilson, in press), social influence (Olufowote, Miller, & Wilson, 2005), emotional support
(Burleson & Mortenson, 2003), and teamwork situations (Monahan & Samp, 2007). For
example, Liu and Wilson (in press) found that when negotiators placed greater importance DEMO
competitively oriented interaction goals, they used more distributive persuasion and fewer
DEMO information exchange tactics; furthermore, interaction goals produced a significant
impact (DEMO or indirect) both on the size of joint profit and on DEMO members’ individual gains.
Given the established links between goals, tactics, and outcomes, this study focuses on the direct
and indirect influence of emotions (i.e., anger and compassion) on interaction goals to shed light
on the process whereby these emotions influence negotiation performance.
Specifically, angry feelings entail a behavioral readiness to attack, to punish, or to
Trust and Distrust 8
retaliate. In a bargaining context where negotiating parties DEMO both incompatible and
interdependent interests (Tjosvold, 1998), the extent to which these automatic action tendencies
translate into actual, specific bargaining tactics depends on how a negotiator (re)defines the
bargaining situation and (re)DEMO goals. Wilson and Putnam (1990) identified three types
of interaction goals in negotiation: instrumental (or task-oriented goals, e.g., obtaining money or
DEMO), relational (e.g., gaining power or building trust), and identity goals (e.g., managing
one’s own or the other party’s face). DEMO goals reflect a negotiator’s social motives (i.e., a
negotiator’s preference for particular outcome distributions between him-or herself and the
counterpart, De Dreu, DEMO).2 The mixed-motive nature of negotiation often places negotiators in
a position of pursuing multiple, sometimes conflicting goals concomitantly (e.g., wanting to
maximize joint profit but also to avoid being taken advantage of). Therefore, as compared with
action tendencies, interaction goals are more specific, multifaceted, and arise from the contextual
features of the interaction. The current study DEMO a job contract negotiation scenario to
examine the hypothesized links. We assess eight interaction goals that vary in type (instrumental,
relational, and DEMO) and motivation (competitive vs. cooperative). We predict that:
H1:  Angry negotiators will place greater importance on competitively oriented
interaction goals, such as getting a better deal than the counterpart, withholding
information, DEMO the other’s face, and gaining power over the other party.
On DEMO other hand, compassionate feelings entail empathy, an ability to take another
person’s perspective, as well as a behavioral readiness to help. In a bargaining process such
feelings can motivate negotiators to be concerned about the DEMO needs and interests,
both tangible and intangible. Thus, we hypothesize DEMO:
H2:  Compassionate negotiators will place greater importance on cooperatively
Trust and Distrust 9
oriented interaction goals, such as maximizing both parties’ profit, exchanging
information concerning interests and priorities, enhancing the other’s face, and
establishing a positive relationship with the other party.
Trust and Distrust DEMO Two Distinct Mediators
Although interaction goals can serve as a viable construct linking emotions with specific
forms of negotiation behavior, the link between emotions and interaction goals requires further
theorizing. Emotion theorists contend that we must DEMO the influence of emotions on
beliefs in order to understand their impact upon human life (see Forgas, 2000; Frijda, Manstead,
& DEMO, 2000). Beliefs are thoughts and judgments concerning what is true; they extend to the
causes or intentions behind events, their likely consequences, and the enduring properties of
things or persons that make them behave in a particular manner (Frijda & Mesquita, 2000).
Beliefs may DEMO from the way an event is appraised and therefore be parts of emotions, but
beliefs tend to involve generalizations and are about stable and intrinsic properties of the object.
The current study examines perceived trust and DEMO as one set of beliefs that can potentially
explain the differential effects of anger and compassion on negotiators’ interaction goals.
Trust and Distrust: A Tale of Two Dimensions
Researchers have yet to reach consensus on definitions DEMO trust and distrust (for a review
of various definitions, see Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998). Nonetheless, most scholars agree
that DEMO and distrust are cognitive notions involving an individual’s positive or negative
perceptions of another’s intentions and motives, as well as a willingness to act upon such beliefs
(e.g., Deutsch, 1960, Mayer, Davis, & DEMO, 1995). Early research has implicitly treated
trust and distrust as DEMO opposites of each other on one conceptual spectrum. Evidence of low
trust was routinely assumed to be that of high distrust. The majority of DEMO extant literature on
Trust and Distrust 10
trust is based on this premise. In these DEMO, the positive impacts of interpersonal trust are well-
documented (e.g., DEMO, 1995, 1999; Kimmel, Pruitt, Magenau, Konar-Goldband, & Carnevale,DEMO
1980), whereas distrust receives little attention.
Recent scholarship has identified distrust as a distinct construct that is related to, but
qualitatively different from trust ( Cho, 2006; Lewicki et al., 1998; Kramer, 1999). Whereas trust
is defined in terms of an individual’s positive expectation DEMO another’s conduct and a willingness
to cooperate (McAllister, 1995), distrust is viewed as the expectation that the other party may
engage in DEMO actions against oneself, thus triggering a desire to “buffer oneself from DEMO
effects of another’s [expected] conduct” (Lewicki et al., 1998, p. DEMO). The elements that
contribute to the growth and decline of trust and distrust are often separate. For example, one can
trust a barber to do a good haircut (i.e., trust his competence), but DEMO the barber may
overcharge him when chance permits (i.e., distrust his integrity). Having high trust in one facet
of a social relationship, therefore, does not preclude one from having high distrust in another;
distrust is different from low trust in that it emphasizes negative expectations DEMO than the
absence of positive expectations. This is especially true in negotiation, where negotiators need to
constantly balance the desire to trust the counterpart and reciprocate with integrative tactics (e.g.,
sharing information and formulating mutually beneficial tradeoffs) and to distrust the counterpart
and engage in distributive tactics (e.g., withholding information and claiming value for oneself).
This distinction DEMO led researchers to believe that the antecedents and consequences
associated with distrust are distinct from those surrounding trust. A recent study conducted by
Cho (2006), in particular, supports this proposition. Specifically, he found that DEMO
perception regarding online sellers’ benevolence fosters trust, whereas their perception
concerning DEMO sellers’ competence reduces distrust; trust is more crucial in determining buyers’
Trust and Distrust 11
commitment, whereas distrust discourages consumers from disclosing information about
themselves. This is consistent with broader research that demonstrates the separability DEMO
positive-valent and negative-valent constructs for affect (Watson & Tellegen, 1985),DEMO
optimism/pessimism (Stallings, Dunham, Gatz, & Bengston, 1997), DEMO interracial attitudes
(Katz & Hass, 1988). Such consistency suggests that trust and distrust may be associated with
other processes (e.g., emotions) in ways that are consistent with their valence.
Feeling is Believing: Emotions and Judgments Concerning Trust and Distrust
In contrast to a large body DEMO research examining the role of cognition in emotion, the
influence of DEMO on beliefs has been under-explored (Forgas, 2000). Nevertheless, a DEMO
of models have been advanced to theorize the relationship between emotion and judgment. One
group of models views affect as information; in this light, mood influences judgment through
biased retrieval of mood-congruent information from memory (DEMO, 1981; Schwarz & Clore,
1988). Thus, negative affect DEMO to negative assessments of the target, and the opposite is true
DEMO positive affect. Going one step further, Forgas’s (1995) Affect Infusion DEMO (AIM)
identifies cognitive processing strategies (i.e., direct access, motivated, heuristic, and substantive
processing) that can moderate the relationship between mood and judgment. For example, when
individuals engage in heuristic processing (i.e., rely on cognitive shortcuts or heuristics) they are
likely to make mood congruent judgments; however, when individuals engage in motivated
processing (involving highly selective information search directed by a specific motivational
objective), their judgments DEMO not be mood congruent.
These models have received considerable support from empirical research. A growing
body of literature suggests that incidental emotions (i.e., DEMO stemming from a prior,
unrelated event) produce judgments that are DEMO with their cognitive appraisals (e.g.,
Trust and Distrust 12
Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993; Lerner & Keltner, 2000). Tiedens and Linton (2001) found
that emotions DEMO with certainty appraisals (e.g., anger) promotes heuristic processing;
therefore DEMO are more likely to produce valence-congruent effects. Researchers did not link
emotions with trust until recently. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) examined how trust DEMO
were influenced by incidental emotions. Consistent with the models discussed above, DEMO study
found that emotions with appraisals of other-person control influence trust in a manner consistent
with the emotion’s valence (e.g., gratitude increases trust DEMO anger decreases trust),
especially when dealing with unfamiliar partners (when heuristic processing is more likely).
Although empirical work on emotion and DEMO tends to focus on incidental
emotions, research has demonstrated that discrete DEMO emotions (i.e., event-specific
emotions) have a significant impact on judgment DEMO is even stronger than incidental mood
states. For example, Allred et DEMO (1997) found that anger and compassion directed toward the
target produced a stronger impact on negotiators’ accuracy of judgment concerning the target’s
interests DEMO their general mood states. The current study, therefore, expects to find that the two
integral emotions (i.e., anger and compassion) with related (both high in certainty) but distinct
appraisals (other-person vs. situational control) will influence trust and distrust in valence-
congruent ways. Given that anger arises from the perception that the target has intentionally done
something harmful, it is likely to increase distrust, or negative expectation of the target’s
subsequent behavior. On the other hand, as compassion stems from the perception that the target
engaged in undesirable behaviors due to external circumstances beyond DEMO control, it is
likely to be associated with trust, or positive judgment of the target’s intentions and motives.
Linking Trust and Distrust with DEMO
Trust and distrust have been defined in terms of the willingness or desire to act upon
Trust and Distrust 13
positive (or negative) expectations about the (dis)trustee’s actions and/or motives. Given the
expectation that the other party DEMO engage in harmful activities against oneself, distrust entails a
propensity to DEMO oneself from such conduct (Lewicki et al., 1998). Researchers have
identified at least two behavioral consequences of negotiator distrust (or paranoia): defensive
noncooperation, which entails withdrawal from cooperative behavior, and moral aggression,DEMO
which refers to the intense negative reactions individuals sometimes experience when they
anticipate being treated in an unfair, unjust, or untrustworthy fashion (Kramer, 2004). Because
negotiating parties come to the negotiation table with incompatible interests, a distrusting
negotiator tends to view negotiation as a win-lose game. Such a distributive mindset may
motivate the distruster to place greater importance DEMO interaction goals that are competitively
oriented, such as to withhold information, to get a better deal than the counterpart, to gain power
over the other party, and to attack the other’s face. On the other hand, researchers have
associated trust with the willingness to count on (DEMO, 2003; McAllister, 1995), to cooperate
with (Parks, Henager, & Scamahorn, 1996), and to be friend with the trustee (DEMO, 1996).
Given the positive expectations regarding the counterpart’s intentions and DEMO, a trusting
negotiator is likely to view both parties’ interests as DEMO and place greater importance
on cooperatively oriented goals, such as to DEMO information exchange, to maximize both
parties’ profit, to enhance the other’s face, and to promote a positive relationship with the other
party. Thus, based on existing research on emotions and beliefs, as well as DEMO on trust
and distrust as two functionally distinct constructs, we hypothesize:DEMO
H3:  The influence of anger on competitively oriented interaction goals will be
mediated by distrust, but not trust.
H4: The influence of DEMO on cooperatively oriented interaction goals will be
Trust and Distrust 14
mediated by trust, but not distrust.
Method
Participants
Participants were 277 college students (97 men and 180 women) recruited DEMO a major
Eastern university in the U.S. through an on-line participant pool. The majority of the
participants (69%, N = 191) identified themselves as White/Caucasian. The others identified
themselves as Asian American (14.4%, DEMO = 40), African American (12.3%, N = 34), and Latino
American (4.3%, N = 12). They were 19.62 years DEMO age on average and received a small amount
of extra credit from their course instructors for participating in this study.
Survey Procedures and Hypothetical DEMO
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions that varied by
manipulation condition (high vs. low responsibility) and bargaining role (employer vs.
employee). They read a negotiation scenario where they took on the DEMO of either a manager of a
large-consulting firm or a prospective employee to negotiate over an employment contract. After
reading the first negotiation task, which is a single-issue, zero-sum game, participants were told
how the DEMO party behaved (i.e., they were given a list of positional statements as well as
persuasive arguments made by the other party) and the result of that negotiation (i.e., a straight
compromise). Participants then DEMO a questionnaire assessing (a) their perception of the
other party’s behavior and the extent to which the other party was responsible for such DEMO,
(b) the emotions they felt toward the other party, DEMO (c) the extent to which they trusted and
distrusted the other party. Participants were then instructed to prepare for a subsequent
negotiation task DEMO the same partner on core employment issues. After they read the
instructions, they were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the importance they would
Trust and Distrust 15
place on a number of interaction goals if DEMO were to engage in this subsequent negotiation.
The hypothetical scenario has demonstrated validity in prior studies (e.g., Allred et al.,
1997). DEMO were told that their objective was to get as good a deal as they could for their
company or for themselves, measured by the total number of points they could earn from the two
negotiation tasks. DEMO first task, which was distributive in nature, concerned what kind of laptop
computer the employee would receive from the company. Three options were DEMO for
discussion, the basic, advanced, and elite options, which varied in price, weight, and accessories,
and were respectively worth 0, 20, and 100 points for the employee and 100, 20, and 0 points for
the manager; thus, both parties must compete in DEMO to win. Moreover, instructions for this task
and responses from “the DEMO party” were intended to elicit contrasting expectations. For
example, “employees” were DEMO that the laptop computer was an important symbol of status and
respect at the firm and aggressive pursuit of the elite option was typically DEMO as an
indicator of their requisite confidence to succeed at the firm; however, in the negotiation, the
“manager” argued that the consulting firm frowned upon ostentatious fringe benefits, and most
new recruits had been happy with a basic option computer.
The laptop negotiation was thus designed to DEMO perceptions in both parties that the
other party was competitive and stood in their way for achieving desired goals. The experimental
manipulation then focused DEMO altering participants’ perceptions of how responsible the other was
for that negatively perceived behavior. In the low responsibility condition, additional
explanations for the other party’s behavior were provided which aimed to divert participants’
attention to external, uncontrollable causes (i.e., situational constraints). In the employee version,
DEMO participant had learned through a friend that the employer representative had little choice in
the laptop computer he or she could offer because the DEMO in the firm had previously made
that decision. The employer version stated that the prospective employee was from a graduate
Trust and Distrust 16
program which stressed the importance of new technologies DEMO state-of-art computer
equipment, and the program also instructed students to demand DEMO computers in order
to gain the tools and respect needed to be successful. In the high responsibility condition, these
additional explanations (i.e., mitigating information) were not presented.
After participants completed the questionnaire assessing their attribution of
responsibility, emotions, and trust and distrust, they were told that the other party eventually
agreed upon the advanced option laptop computer (i.e., a straight compromise). They were then
asked to prepare for a subsequent negotiation with the other party, which concerned the core
terms of employment, including salary, medical coverage, vacation time, and start date.
DEMO were given a payoff schedule that described five options for each issue and were told
that the priorities of these issues were different, as reflected in the point values associated with
each option. For example, in the employee version, the highest salary was worth 660 points, but
DEMO best medical coverage was only worth 100 points, whereas the priority DEMO the two issues is
reversed for managers. Participants were told that for an offer to be acceptable, they should try to
get a minimum of 900 points (a straight compromise for all issues only leads to 620 points). This
task, which contained integrative potential (i.e., both parties could “win” by trading off issues of
differential importance), can DEMO participants to form a variety of interaction goals that are
both competitively and cooperatively oriented. Participants completed an interaction goals
questionnaire after reading this DEMO negotiation task, but were not asked to negotiate.
Measures
Judgment of DEMO for a negative behavior. This construct consists of two
components: (a) judgment of how negative the other party’s behavior was, and (b) judgment of
how responsible the other party was for such behavior (DEMO, 1995; Allred et al., 1997). Six
items on 7-point DEMO scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) DEMO the negativity component
Trust and Distrust 17
(e.g., “To what extent do you perceive DEMO Johnson’s behavior as negative?”). Eight items on 7-
point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) assessed the attribution of responsibility
component (e.g., “To what extent do you DEMO Mr. Johnson accountable for his behavior?”).
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (DEMO) was performed to assess the two-factor oblique model on
the 14 DEMO Chi-square value for the overall model fit was significant, χ2(63) = 110.3, p < .001.
Due to the sensitivity of χ2 in large samples, other fit indices were assessed (Kline, 1998).
Examination of these indices showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI = .92, DEMO = .95, and SRMR
= .06 (Hu & Bentler, 1999)DEMO All the factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The two
factors were moderately correlated, r = .56. Cronbach’s alpha was .74 for negativity and .76 for
responsibility. Weiner’s (1995) work suggests that the DEMO and responsibility elements
have a multiplicative rather than an additive effect on anger and compassion. Thus, we followed
Allred et al.’s (1997) method and multiplied the composite negativity and responsibility scores
for each participant to DEMO a measure of judgment of responsibility for a negative behavior.
Anger and compassion. Four items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much)
were included to measure anger, which DEMO participants’ feelings of anger, annoyance,
madness, and irritation (MacGeorge, 2001). For compassion, four items assessed participants’
feelings of sympathy, DEMO, empathy, and understanding. CFA was performed to assess
the two-factor oblique model on the 8 items. Chi-square value for the overall model fit DEMO
significant, χ2(16) =56.66, p < .001. Other fit indices DEMO an acceptable model fit, NNFI =
.94, CFI = .96, DEMO SRMR = .07. All but one factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The
item with insignificant loading (i.e., madness) was dropped. Examination of the fit indices of the
new model showed an acceptable DEMO, χ2(12) = 29.34, p = .004, NNFI = .96, CFI = .98, and SRMR
= .05. The two factors were DEMO correlated, r = -.04. The internal consistency of the two scales
Trust and Distrust 18
was deemed satisfactory: Cronbach’s alpha was .86 for anger and .77 for compassion.
Trust and Distrust. Measurement items for trust DEMO distrust were developed based on
prior literature (see Appendix) and were pilot tested. Four items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not
at all, 7 = very much) measured trust and four measured distrust. DEMO was performed to assess
the two-factor oblique model on the 8 items. Chi-square value for the overall model fit was
significant, χ2(17) DEMO, p < .001. Other fit indices showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI = .91,
CFI = .95, and SRMR = .05. All the factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The two
factors DEMO slightly correlated, r = -.30. Cronbach’s alpha was .70 for trust DEMO .77 for distrust.
Interaction goals in negotiation. Measurement items for negotiators’ interaction goals
were developed based on Wilson and Putnam’s (1990) framework and DEMO pilot tested (see
Appendix). 31 items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) assessed
eight interaction DEMO CFA was performed to assess two four-factor oblique models for
cooperative and competitive goals respectively. Chi-square value for the cooperative goals model
fit was DEMO, χ2(81) =134.2, p < .001. Other fit indices showed DEMO good model fit, NNFI =

Correlations between the four factors ranged from .41 to .81. Chi-square value DEMO the
competitive goals model fit was also significant, χ2(95) =145.9, p < .001. Other fit indices

were significant at the .05 level. Correlations between the four DEMO ranged from .24 to .76.
Cronbach’s alpha was .76 for “maximizing both parties’ profit,” .72 for “promoting information

Manipulation Check
The inducement of anger and compassion by manipulating participants’ judgment of
responsibility proved to be DEMO Participants in the High Responsibility (HR) condition
perceived the counterpart’s behavior as more negative (M = 4.86, SD = .83) than those in the
Low Responsibility (LR) condition, (M = 4.65, SD = .84), t(270) = 1.98, p < .05, d = .17;
consistently, they also held the other party more responsible for such behavior (M = 4.38, SD =
.99)  than DEMO in the LR condition (M = 3.81, SD = .88), t(274) = 5.06, p < .001, d = .61. Thus,
the manipulation produced a significant effect on participants’ overall judgment of DEMO,
t(270) = 4.54, p < .001, d = DEMO, with participants in the HR condition attributing greater
responsibility to the DEMO for perceived negative behavior (M = 21.58, SD = 7.05) DEMO
those in the LR condition (M = 17.96, SD = 6.96). Further analysis indicates that the effect was
stronger for participants in DEMO manager’s role, t(126) = 5.49, p < .001, d = .97, than for those in
the employee’s role, t(142) = 2.08, p < .05, d = .35. The composite measure DEMO overall judgment
of responsibility for perceived negative behavior was positively associated with anger, r = .29, p
< .001, and negatively associated with compassion, r = -.27, p < .001. The measures of anger DEMO
compassion (based on emotion terms) were thus used for subsequent analyses.
The Effects of Anger and Compassion on Interaction Goals: Zero-order Correlations
Hypothesis 1 predicted that anger would be positively associated with competitively
oriented goals DEMO Hypothesis 2 predicted that compassion would be positively associated with
cooperatively oriented goals. As Table 1 shows, bivariate correlational analyses detected

information,” nor were there significant associations DEMO compassion and (a) “to maximize
both parties’ profit,” (b) “to promote information exchange,” and (c) “to promote a positive
DEMO Thus, H1 and H2 were partially supported based on zero-order correlations.
DEMO Effects of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct Mediators
Hypothesis 3 predicted that the influence of anger (X) on the four competitively oriented
DEMO (Y ) would be mediated by distrust (M1 ), but DEMO trust (M2 ). According to Baron and Kenny
(1986), DEMO variable functions as a mediator if (a) X significantly predicts M (anger  distrust), (b)
M significantly predicts Y after DEMO for X (distrust  competitive goals), and (c) when DEMO
is controlled, the effect of X on Y (anger  competitive goals) decreases (partial mediation), with
the strongest demonstration of mediation DEMO when the effect becomes non-significant (full
mediation). As Table 1 DEMO, anger was positively associated with distrust (p < .01) and
DEMO associated with trust (p < .01).3 To assess the mediation DEMO distrust, hierarchical
regression procedures were performed on each of the four DEMO goals, in which anger was
entered on the first step, followed by distrust on the second step. Results from the analyses are
summarized DEMO Table 2. After controlling for anger, distrust had a significant effect DEMO all four
competitive goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s criteria, distrust DEMO mediated the influence of
anger on two of the competitive goals, DEMO get a better deal” and “to gain power over the other
party,” in that the associations between anger and these goals became non-significant DEMO
distrust was controlled. In addition, distrust partially mediated the influence of DEMO on the goal
Trust and Distrust 21
“to attack the other’s face” in that the DEMO for anger dropped substantially after distrust was
controlled, even if it DEMO significant. Finally, based on these criteria, distrust did not
mediate the influence of anger on the goal “to withhold information” because the effect DEMO anger
was non-significant both before and after distrust was controlled.

Sobel tests were subsequently performed to assess DEMO the indirect effects of anger
on the four competitive goals through distrust were statistically significant (Sobel, 1982). As
Table 2 shows, all four indirect paths proved to be significant. It should be noted that DEMO
the terms mediated effects and indirect effects are sometimes used interchangeably, DEMO conclusion
that a mediation effect is present implies that the X Y zero-order correlation (also referred to
as the total effect) was initially DEMO, whereas it is possible to find an indirect effect (e.g.,
anger  distrust  “to withhold information”) even when there is no evidence for a significant
total effect (e.g., anger  “to withhold DEMO,” n.s.). Recent scholarship contends that
mediation exists whenever significant indirect effects (i.e., the influence of X on Y through one or
DEMO intervening variables) are found (Preachers & Hayes, 2008).
To DEMO the mediation of trust on the link between anger and competitive goals, the
same hierarchical regression procedures were repeated, only with distrust being DEMO by trust
on the second step. Results are summarized in Table 2. After controlling for anger, trust did not
have a significant effect on any of the four competitive goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s
(1986) criteria, trust had no mediating effect on the relationship between anger DEMO competitive
goals. Results from Sobel tests confirmed this conclusion: None of DEMO indirect paths from anger
to competitive goals through trust was significant (DEMO Table 2). H3 was supported.
Hypothesis 4 predicted that the influence of compassion (X) on the four cooperatively
Trust and Distrust 22
oriented goals (Y ) will be mediated by trust (M1 ), but not distrust (M2 ). As Table DEMO shows,
compassion was positively associated with trust (p < .01) but not associated with distrust (n.s.).
To assess the mediation of trust, hierarchical regression procedures were performed, with
compassion entered on the DEMO step, followed by trust on the second step. Results are
summarized DEMO Table 3. After controlling for compassion, trust had a significant effect DEMO all four
cooperative goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s criteria, trust DEMO mediated the influence of
compassion on the goal “to enhance the other’s face” because the beta for compassion dropped
substantially after trust was controlled, even if it remained significant. However, trust did not
mediate the influence of compassion on the other goals because the effect of compassion was
DEMO at the .05 level both before and after trust was controlled. Nevertheless,
subsequent Sobel tests showed that the indirect effects of compassion on DEMO four cooperative
goals through trust were all statistically significant (see Table DEMO).
-------------- Insert Table 3 about Here --------------------
Because compassion was not associated with distrust (see Table 1), distrust did not
qualify as a mediator for explaining the influence of compassion on cooperative goals.
Nevertheless, the same hierarchical regression analyses and Sobel tests were performed, with
trust being replaced by distrust. As Table 3 shows, these findings provide further support to this
conclusion: None of the indirect paths from compassion to cooperative goals through distrust
was statistically significant. H4 was supported.
Comparing the DEMO Effects of Trust and Distrust in Multiple Mediator Models
Although previous analyses indicate that trust and distrust mediate the influence of anger
and compassion DEMO negotiators’ interaction goals in distinct ways, it is of theoretical interest DEMO
further assess whether the indirect effects of the two constructs are significantly different from
Trust and Distrust 23
each other. By far, the procedures suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) are the most commonly
used method in DEMO sciences to guide mediation analysis. However, recent scholarship has
identified several DEMO in this method that make it insufficient to assess mediation when
(DEMO) the sample size is small and the assumption of normality is DEMO, (b) the analysis involves
multi-level models, and (c) the effects of multiple mediators need to be assessed and compared
(Bauer, DEMO, & Gil, 2006; MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004; DEMO & Hayes,
2008). Preachers and Hayes (2008) recently proposed bootstrapping procedures for assessing and
comparing indirect effects in multiple mediator models. DEMO also has the advantage of
making no assumptions about the shape of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect or its
underlying paths; rather, it is accomplished by empirically estimating these distributions through
resampling procedures and deriving a confidence interval with them.
To assess whether the indirect effects DEMO trust and distrust are significantly different from
each other, we followed DEMO and Hayes’ procedures and summarized the results of the
bootstrapping tests (DEMO,000 resamples, N = 277) in Tables 4 and 5. Like in the Sobel tests, the
specific indirect effect of X on Y via mediator M1 or M2 is defined as the product of the DEMO
unstandardized paths (e.g., X M1 and M1  Y controlling for X). The total indirect effect of X
on Y is the DEMO of the specific indirect effects of M1 and M2 ). The DEMO of the total
indirect effect indicates whether the multiple mediator models have an overall good fit.
As Tables 4 shows, the indirect effects of anger on the four competitive goals were all
significantly mediated by distrust, but not trust; the difference of the two paths was statistically
significant for two of the competitive goals (p < .05), “to get a better deal” and “to gain power
over the other party,” DEMO approached significance for the other two (p < .10), “to DEMO
information” and “to attack the other’s face.” The addition of trust as a mediator for explaining
Trust and Distrust 24
anger’s influence on competitive goals proved to be DEMO
------------------ Insert Table 4 about Here ---------------------------
Similarly, as Table 5 DEMO, the indirect effects of compassion on the four cooperative
goals were DEMO significantly mediated by trust, but not distrust; the difference of the two paths
was statistically significant for three of them (p < .05), “to maximize both parties’ profit,” “to
promote information exchange,” DEMO “to promote a positive relationship,” and approached
significance for the other goal, “to enhance the other’s face.” The addition of distrust as a
mediator for explaining compassion’s influence on cooperative goals proved to be unnecessary.

Discussion
Whereas empirical work on emotion in negotiation has primarily focused on the direct
effects of emotions on DEMO performance, the current study delves into the psychological
mechanisms that lead DEMO such effects. Specifically, we examined the paths through which anger
and DEMO, two discrete emotions that differ in valence (negative vs. positive) DEMO appraisal
(other-person vs. situational control), influence negotiators’ interaction goals through DEMO and
distrust, two related, but functionally distinct constructs. We found that whereas the effects of
anger (a negative emotion with appraisal of other-person control) on competitive goals were
mediated by distrust, but not trust, the effects of compassion (a positive emotion with appraisal
of situational control) on cooperative goals were mediated by trust, but not distrust. These
DEMO not only shed light on the cognitive processes through which anger and compassion
influence negotiation behavior, but also support the proposition that trust and distrust represent
two distinct psychological processes that are associated with different antecedents DEMO
consequences. This section reviews major findings of the study and discusses its theoretical and
Trust and Distrust 25
practical implications, as well as limitations and directions for future research.
The Effects of Anger and Compassion on Negotiators’ Interaction DEMO
Recent research shows that the relative importance that negotiators place on interaction
goals is associated with the specific bargaining tactics they use, as well as their own and their
counterpart’s negotiation outcomes (Liu & Wilson, DEMO press). Based on this premise, this study
examined how angry DEMO compassionate feelings toward the counterpart influenced the ways in
which negotiators (DEMO)formulate their interaction goals. Given the contextual features of a job
contract negotiation, we measured eight interaction goals that varied in type (instrumental,DEMO
identity, and relational) and motivational orientation (competitive vs. cooperative) after
participants were primed with an imagined emotion-inducing interaction. Consistent with prior
research DEMO that anger provokes an intention to attack, whereas compassion is associated
DEMO an ability to take another’s perspective and a willingness to help, DEMO study found that anger
drives negotiators to place more importance on competitive goals, such as wanting “to get a
better deal than the counterpart,” “to attack the other party’s face,” and “to gain power DEMO the
other party,” whereas compassion causes people to place more importance on cooperative goals,
such as wanting “to enhance the other’s face.” DEMO addition to these zero-order effects, our
mediational analyses further revealed that DEMO has an indirect effect on all four competitive
goals (also including DEMO withhold information”) through distrust, whereas compassion has an
indirect effect on all four cooperative goals (also including “to maximize both parties’ profit,”
“to promote information exchange,” and “to promote a positive relationship”) through trust.
On a theoretical level, this study identifies viable mechanisms for explaining the dynamic
psychological processes through which anger and compassion influence negotiation
performance. DEMO example, Allred et al.’s (1997) study found that negotiators who DEMO more
Trust and Distrust 26
anger and less compassion toward the counterpart achieved DEMO joint gains and had less desire
to work with each other in the future. Findings from this study suggest that these effects take
place DEMO such an emotional state causes negotiators to redefine the bargaining situation
toward a more distributive (competitive) and less integrative (cooperative) direction.
Specifically, given that angry feelings arise from the perception that the other party DEMO
intentionally engaged in negative behavior, they tend to activate an individual’s DEMO
expectation of the other party’s future behavior, or distrust; such a negative assessment of the
other’s intentions and motives will in turn provoke DEMO intention to protect oneself from being
taken advantage of, such as DEMO greater importance on wanting “to withhold information,” as
well as a “win-lose” frame to view the negotiation, hence the desire “to get a better deal,” “to
gain more power than the other party,” DEMO even “to attack the other’s face.”
Likewise, because compassionate feelings arise DEMO the perception that the other party
had to engage in negative behavior due to external, uncontrollable factors, they tend to activate
an individual’s DEMO memory concerning the other party’s intentions and motives, and
therefore positive DEMO of the person’s future behavior, or trust; such a positive judgment
will in turn invoke prosocial tendencies, such as placing greater importance on wanting “to
enhance the other’s face” and “to promote a positive relationship DEMO the counterpart,” as well
as a “win-win” frame to view the negotiation, hence the willingness “to maximize both parties’
profit” and “to promote information exchange.”
These findings provide additional support to existing models that explain DEMO relationship
between emotions and beliefs (e.g., the affect-as-information model, Schwarz & Clore, 1988),
with evidence from integral emotions. Consistent with Tiedens and Linton’s (2001) study
suggesting that emotions associated with certainty appraisals DEMO heuristic processing, in
Trust and Distrust 27
this study, anger and compassion (both involving DEMO appraisals) produced valence-
congruent effects on trust and distrust judgments as DEMO as interaction goals. Nevertheless, as
Forgas’s (1995) Affect Infusion Model DEMO, when individuals adopt motivated processing
(i.e., deliberate information search guided DEMO a specific objective), the likelihood of affect
infusion can be reduced. Research shows that motivated processing is more likely when people
become aware DEMO the causes and consequences of their emotions (Berkowitz, Jaffee, Jo, &
Troccoli, 2000). Understanding the paths through which cognitive appraisals DEMO rise to
emotions and in turn influence negotiators’ judgments and goals, DEMO, will allow
negotiators to consciously seek information and formulate goals in DEMO to combat the negative
impact of emotions on their own and their counterpart’s behaviors and outcomes.
On a practical level, the study provides insight into the management of not only one’s
own, but also the counterpart’s emotions. Given the indirect effects of anger and compassion on
interaction goals DEMO trust and distrust, it is desirable for negotiators to gain trust DEMO their
counterparts by eliciting their feelings of compassion. Findings from this study suggest that this
can be achieved by managing the counterpart’s attribution of DEMO, which involves
reducing the apparent competitiveness of one’s own behavior (e.g., verbal aggressiveness) and
proactively providing information (personally or through a third party) to the counterpart
concerning external, uncontrollable causes for behavior that DEMO be negatively perceived. In
doing so, a negotiator can also reduce DEMO counterpart’s angry feelings and perception of distrust,
leading the bargaining process toward a more cooperative (integrative) and less competitive
(distributive) direction. DEMO far, many prescriptive maxims regarding the role of emotion in
negotiation DEMO on dealing with one’s own emotions; this study recognizes the interdependent
DEMO of the bargaining process and suggests that it is also important to modify the other party’s
Trust and Distrust 28
emotions, beliefs, and motivations through effective information DEMO
The Distinct Roles of Trust and Distrust in Negotiation
The study also provides empirical support to scholarship that views trust and distrust as
two DEMO, but qualitative different constructs (e.g., Kramer, 1999; Lewicki et DEMO, 1998). The
mediation effects that trust and distrust had on DEMO relationship between the two discrete
emotions (anger and compassion) and negotiators’ various interaction goals were statistically
different in most cases. Specifically, although angry feelings reduced trust and increased distrust,
compassionate feelings increased trust but DEMO not necessarily reduce distrust. In addition, trust
increased the importance that DEMO placed on all cooperative goals, whereas it had no
effect on DEMO pursuit of competitive goals. On the other hand, distrust increased
negotiators’ DEMO importance of all competitive goals but were negatively associated with
only a couple of cooperative goals with a weaker strength of association. It is DEMO that trust
and distrust are associated with distinct antecedents and consequences. On a theoretical level, the
study suggests that distrust as a distinct construct demands as much attention as trust because it
yields unique insights into DEMO processes by which anger and compassion influence negotiation.
Furthermore, the study DEMO that trust and distrust play an important role in
accounting for the effects that anger and compassion have on negotiators’ goals.4 Without
introducing trust DEMO distrust as viable mechanisms, our understanding of how these two
emotions DEMO motivation is limited. For example, based on zero-order correlations,
compassion DEMO to influence only one cooperative goal (“to enhance the other’s face”),
whereas meditational analyses revealed that compassion had an indirect effect on DEMO the other
cooperative goals (“to maximize both parties’ profit,” “to DEMO information exchange,” and
“to promote a positive relationship”) through trust. DEMO, anger appeared to have no
Trust and Distrust 29
influence on perceived importance of “withholding information” according DEMO the zero-order
correlation, but a mediation analysis revealed its indirect effect DEMO this goal through distrust.
To date, most research on emotion in DEMO focuses on direct links between
emotions and negotiation performance. Prescriptive maxims based on the direct links are
sometimes inconsistent (for a review, see DEMO, Medvec, Seiden, & Kopelman, 2001). For
example, negotiators DEMO been advised to avoid or suppress anger during negotiation because it
leads to smaller joint gains and has no effect on the portion of DEMO individuals claim for
themselves (Allred et al., 1997). Competing maxims, however, advise them to “rant and rave”
because anger allows individuals DEMO get a better deal (Van Kleef et al., 2004; Sinaceur & Tiedens,
2006). The current study suggests that by identifying the underlying mechanisms we may be able
to generate new insights into the DEMO of emotions (that are lost in indirect links) and
possibly reconcile some of the existing inconsistencies. For example, the indirect effect of anger
on wanting “to withhold information” through distrust may explain why anger leads DEMO smaller
joint gains in integrative bargaining situations, whereas its positive effects DEMO wanting “to get a
better deal” and “to gain power over the other” may explain why it allowed individuals to claim
more value in DEMO bargaining situations.
On a practical level, we can conclude that trust DEMO particularly important in bargaining
situations that contain integrative potential and where negotiators have a long-term relationship
beyond negotiation. This is because trust tends to DEMO prosocial tendencies, such as wanting
to enhance face concerns and to DEMO a positive relationship, as well as integrative motives,
such as DEMO exchange directed at maximizing joint gains. On the other hand, distrust DEMO
be important in distributive bargaining situations where value-claiming is critical, because
DEMO drives individuals to be more vigilant against potential exploitation by the opponent.
Trust and Distrust 30
Perhaps more importantly, trust and distrust as two distinct constructs can co-exist; because most
negotiations are mixed-motive in nature, DEMO is important for negotiators to be aware of their
respective antecedents and consequences and to balance the bargaining processes through
conscious management of both DEMO own, and their counterpart’s trust and distrust.
Limitations
Like any research, this study has several limitations that may constrain the
generalizability of its DEMO First, participants in this study were university students at the
undergraduate DEMO with a limited amount of work experience. Although the hypothetical
scenario described a job-offer negotiation situation which college students commonly encounter
as a prospective DEMO, a sample that consists of working professionals is more desirable to
DEMO the role of the recruiting manager. Second, although we successfully induced DEMO and
compassion through manipulation of judgment of responsibility, we accomplished this DEMO by
providing participants with standard responses given by a hypothetical counterpart in the survey
rather than an actual person through face-to-face negotiation interaction. It DEMO be important for
future research to triangulate the current findings with interaction-based negotiation simulations .
Third, we measured participants’ interaction goals through self reports for an imagined
subsequent negotiation. Although these one-time reports provide insights into DEMO
motivational tendencies in response to an emotion-inducing event, future research should
DEMO interaction goals using alternative methods, such as stimulated recalls after face-to-face
DEMO, to capture the dynamic nature of interaction goals (see Keck & Samp, 2007).
Finally, findings from this study were derived from DEMO Western sample that was predominantly
white and of middle-class backgrounds. Future research should replicate the study in other
cultures or ethnicities to see whether DEMO models can be generalizable to other cultures.

Footnotes
1 Scholars have not reached consensus on DEMO compassion should be distinguished from
pity. Some consider compassion as requiring a certain degree of equality and pity as regarding its
object as inferior (Ben Ze’ev, 2000), whereas some believe that the distinction may be
historically and culturally specific (Goetz, 2008; Nussbaum, 1996).
2 DEMO has identified many social motives – competitive (win-lose), cooperative (win-
win), individualistic (pro-self), altruistic (pro-other), and so on (Carnevale & De Dreu, 2006).
Given that the purpose of the study is to shed light on how anger and compassion result in DEMO
distributive or more integrative bargaining processes, we focus on interaction goals DEMO are
competitively and cooperatively oriented.
3 Mediation analyses show that judgment of responsibility had a mediated (indirect) effect
on distrust through anger, r = .03, z = 2.17, p. < .05, and a mediated (indirect) effect on trust
through compassion, r = -.01, z DEMO -2.92, p. < .01.
4 The current study identifies trust and DEMO as viable mechanisms for explaining the
influence of anger and compassion on negotiators’ interaction goals because of the theoretical
connections between these constructs; however, it is not our intention to make a general claim
that trust and distrust can also mediate the influence of other emotions on the DEMO
process.
