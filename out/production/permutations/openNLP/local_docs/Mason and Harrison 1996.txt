Why 'Business Angels' Say No:
A Case Study of DEMO
Rejected by an Informal
Investor Syndicate
Uy Colin Mason and &chard DEMO
HE IMPORTANCE OF THE INFORMAL
venture capital market as a source
of finance for entrepreneurial
businesses, especially at start-up and early
stage, is DEMO increasingly well-
documented both in North America (e.g.
Freear and Wetzel, 1992; Riding et al,
1993) and Europe (e.g. Mason and
Harrison, 1994; Landstrom, 1993). All
the indications are that its significance is
increasing. On the one hand, there is
evidence from the UK to suggest that
Thatcherite attempts to create an
'enterprise culture' DEMO been associated
with an increase in informal venture
capital activity in the past 10-15 years
(ACOST, 1990; Mason and Harrison,
1994), while demand for informal
venture capital has increased as a result
T
DEMO developments in the availability of
both debt finance and institutional
venture capital. Banks have become more
cautious in their lending in the aftermath
of DEMO losses on their small business
loan portfolios during the recession
(Ennew DEMO Binks, 1993; Peck and
Rosengren, 1992; Goodman and Allen,
1992). Meanwhile, the venture capital
industry in both the US and Europe has
encountered difficulties in raising new
funds in recent years, creating the real
possibility of a significant decline in the
value of annual DEMO (Murray,
1994). This has been exacerbated by a
shift DEMO the investment focus of the
venture capital industry away from start-
ups and early stage businesses in favour
of established businesses and

management buyouts/buyins (DEMO
and Timmons, 1992; Murray, 1994).
However, it is important to stress that
the informal venture capital market is not
a solution DEMO the funding needs of all
SMEs. Although private investors - or
'DEMO angels' - have a higher
acceptance rate than venture capital
funds, they nevertheless invest in only a
small minority of the investment
proposals DEMO they receive. Our study of
business angels in the UK found that they
invested in about 8 per cent of the
investment proposals that DEMO received
(Mason and Harrison, 1994), although
studies in the USA and Sweden have
found much higher rates of acceptance
(Gaston, 1989; Landstrom, 1993)1. In
comparison, venture capital funds
typically invest in DEMO per cent to 3 per cent
of proposals received (Maier and DEMO,
1987; Dixon, 1991; Sweeting, 1991).
Business angels are generally
experienced investors (e.g. familiar with
the Stock Market), have a fair degree of
financial acumen and are confident in
their own ability DEMO evaluate the merits
and risks of prospective investments.
Typically, they invest DEMO an opportunistic,
rather than a scientific way, relying more
on DEMO and character than on
detailed documentation (Timmons, 1990;
Baty, DEMO). For example, a study of
business angels in Scotland by DEMO
( 1992) noted that they do not calculate
IRRs, payback and the like; rather,
financial rewards are assessed intuitively.
The Report went on to conclude that
"commercial intuition and sound
business sense underpin the[ir] decision-
making process" (KPMG, 1992, p30).
Business angels tend DEMO invest in sectors
where they have had experience. The
more specialised or technical the sector,
the more likely an investor is to be
DEMO in that area (KPMG, 1992).
Because business angels tend to make a
less thorough evaluation of potential
investments than that undertaken by
DEMO capital funds they are quicker to
reach an investment decision (Timmons,DEMO
1990; Baty, 1991).
In making their investment decisions,
informal investors are motivated first and
foremost by the opportunity for high
capital DEMO UK business angels
are seeking an average return on
investment of 30 per cent and upwards
for start-ups and early stage investments
and about DEMO per cent for investments in
established businesses (Mason and
Harrison, 1994). These rates of return
are slightly higher than those sought by
DEMO business angels (Wetzel, 1981; Tymes
and Krasner, 1983; Gaston, 1989).
However, non-financial considerations
also play an important role in their
decision to invest. In the UK, the second
most frequently cited reason for making
informal investments (after capital
appreciation) was the opportunity to DEMO
a role in the entrepreneurial process.
Many investors are also motivated, DEMO
part, by the fun of making informal
investments. Baty (1991) DEMO that
business angels are sufficiently wealthy so
as not need the returns from a successful
investment. Equally, although losses will
hurt, they will DEMO affect their lifestyle.
However, they gain personal satisfaction
and excitement from DEMO involved with
an entrepreneurial venture and helping
it to get started and grow. Baty (1991)
therefore suggests that the typical
business angel is best thought of as a
"recreational investor", investing what
one business angel in our study described
as his "casino money". Other studies have
noted that some investors will invest in
businesses which will produce DEMO

useful products or will bring DEMO
benefits to their community. Some
investors are motivated, in part, by a
feeling that, having been successful in
business themselves they have an
obligation to give something back to the
system that allowed them to DEMO by
assisting the next generation of
entrepreneurs (Wetzel, 1991; Baty, 1991).
A number of studies have noted that a
significant proportion DEMO private investors
are willing to trade-off some financial
returns for various non-financial benefits
(Wetzel, 1981; Tymes and Krasner, 1983;
Sullivan and DEMO, 1990).
Studies which have examined the
investment criteria that business DEMO
take into account when evaluating an
investment opportunity are remarkably
consistent in finding that the quality of
the entrepreneur/management team is
paramount, underpinned by the market
potential of the product or service (Haar
et al, 1988; KPMG, 1992; Mason and
Harrison, 1994). In this respect, business
angels are acting similarly to professional
venture capitalists who, DEMO the evaluation
of new ventures, also regard the quality of
the DEMO team as the key
determinant in the funding decision
(MacMillan et DEMO, 1985). However, the
emphasis which business angels give to
various investment criteria changes as the
process moves from first impressions,
through DEMO investigation, due diligence
and negotiations, with the majority of
opportunities rejected before the investor
ever meets the entrepreneur. In the only
study of DEMO kind, Riding et al (1993) note
that the potential of DEMO product and
industry is the key consideration initially,
but that the importance of the
management team increases during the
course of the decision-making DEMO and
becomes paramount as the deal
approaches the possibility of
consummation. The realism of the
business projections also assumes greater
significance at the due DEMO stage.
These investment criteria are reflected
in the reasons why business angels reject
investment proposals. Here again there is
considerable unanimity between studies.
The DEMO common 'deal killers' are, first,
the investor's lack DEMO confidence in the
abilities of the entrepreneur I
management team to succeed, and
second, insufficient market potential for
the product or service (Haar et al, 1988;
Gaston, 1989; Riding et al, 1993; Mason
and Harrison, 1994). These reasons also
parallel those given by professional
venture capitalists for rejecting investment
proposals (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1983)DEMO
A significant limitation of our existing
knowledge concerning the reasons why
informal investors reject investment
opportunities is that previous research
has focussed on the DEMO rather than
the deal; in other words, the factors
which have been identified as 'deal
killers' have been based on generalised
rather DEMO deal specific information. As
a result, it is not possible to DEMO
between criteria at different stages of the
evaluation process. Neither is it possible
to identify whether there are non-
compensatory, or essential, criteria. DEMO
are also unable to say whether there is
any consistency in deal rejection factors,
for example, between types of venture,
industry sector and entrepreneur, nor to
explore the existence of deal features
associated with a high probability of
rejection. The clear implication,
therefore, is that research needs to shift
from the investor's perception of his
activities DEMO his perception of the deals
which actually cross his desk. Moreover, DEMO
is only with such deal specific

information that sensible and
appropriate advice can be offered to
entrepreneurs seeking to raise finance
from the DEMO venture capital market.
In this paper we take a small step in
this direction by examining a random
sample of deals that were considered DEMO
subsequently rejected by Metrogroup, a
private investor syndicate in the UK DEMO
information was gathered by means of a
series of taped interviews with the
syndicate's instigator, or 'archangel', who
discussed 35 investment DEMO
that the syndicate had rejected. These
investment opportun1t1es were
considered during the period 1986-1988;
the fieldwork reported on in this paper
was collected DEMO late 1989 and early 1990.
The information on the activities of
this informal investment syndicate of
potential interest in the context of this
study DEMO into four categories: first,
descriptive materials (e.g. brochures,
promotional materials) on the proposals;
second, the original business plan for
DEMO proposal, indicating detailed
information on the opportunity, the
product and market, the team and the
financial structure and prospects; third,
the DEMO reports prepared by the
syndicate (see below); and fourth, copies
of notes, memos and minutes of
syndicate discussions of the proposals.
Given that this initial study was designed
to examine the reasons for the DEMO
of investment proposals, rather than
study and objectively analyse the business
DEMO themselves (as formal business
plans only represent part of the
information DEMO assessment process
undertaken by informal investors in an
appraisal process), we have concentrated
on the analysis of the third and fourth
categories of DEMO In the absence
of fully comprehensive data held on file
in these two categories, detailed face-to-
fac e interviews with the 'archangel'
DEMO the only realistic method of
addressing the issue of why angels say no.
The 35 files that are investigated in this
study were chosen DEMO the basis of
information availability, which in turn
reflected the extent DEMO which the
syndicate had pursued its interest in the
investment opportunity. Thus, the
interviews did draw extensively on the file
information, including business DEMO
information, where necessary to support
and elaborate on the archangel's
DEMO and explanations. The
consequence of selecting the cases on the
basis of information availability is that
there is a slight bias in our sample
DEMO proposals which were formally
investigated by the syndicate as a whole
(DEMO per cent, compared with 20 per cent
for the population of DEMO received).
This case study approach to examine
investment decision-making has also been
used in studies of the formal venture
capital industry (e.g. Roberts, 1991).
Although we only have the views of one
member of the syndicate, albeit the
'archangel', this is less of a DEMO than
might appear: anecdotal evidence
indicates that informal investor syndicates
are DEMO structured around a key
individual who undertakes the evaluation
on behalf of the group and whose
recommendation has a significant
influence on other syndicate DEMO
(e.g. Spragins, 1991). As the evidence
presented below indicates, DEMO 'archangel'
in this case did undertake the initial
screening and DEMO diligence investigations
himself, filtering out up to 80 per cent of
DEMO proposals received by the syndicate
before the other syndicate members were
asked to become formally involved in the
evaluation process.

Metrogroup: A Syndicate of Business
Angels2
Metrogroup was established by Andrew
Blair who had retired in his DEMO
from a very active and varied business
career in media communications. During
a visit to Florida, he had a fortuitous
encounter with an American attorney
actively involved in private venture capital
networks. He was fascinated with DEMO
concept and on his return to the UK he
decided to form a syndicate of business
angels. His method of seeking out other
like-minded DEMO was to advertise
in the Financial Times 'Business
Opportunities' column on the grounds
that its readership seemed most
appropriate for this purpose. This
DEMO in the order of 60 replies.
Through a series of one-to-one and
group meetings with those who
responded he eventually selected 11
individuals (one of whom subsequently
dropped out) to join the syndicate on the
basis of the following key factors:
• compatibility of personality;
• DEMO of the small ITusiness world;
• a commitment to the private investor
syndication concept;
• adequate time available for the
venture;
DEMO negative over-riding motives: full-time
job, networking for consultancy
assignments, social DEMO
The members - all men - included
two property developers, three DEMO
accountants and four successful
businessmen who had sold their concerns
and were now looking for new business
interests. All were 'virgin' angels (Freear
and Wetzel, 1992). The syndicate was
called Metrogroup to reflect the
Metropolitan London nature of the
grouping.
The syndicate was incorporated as a
DEMO company and each member
invested in its ordinary share capital.
There was no lower level for this
investment but an upper limit was set DEMO
order not to create an imbalance in
favour of any single dominant
shareholder. A total of£120,000 of money
was raised from the founder DEMO
and a business plan was prepared which
set out the overall strategy to be adopted
by Metrogroup in utilising shareholders'
funds. These funds DEMO essentially to be
allocated for working capital, aimed at
potential deals, plus the funding of
overheads - chiefly premises and
administrative/secretarial staff. DEMO
stockbroker friend of Blair's offered the
syndicate a very elegant self-contained
office suite and a part-time secretary at
cost. The syndicate members nominated
DEMO elected a board of directors and
chairman. A detailed set of rules was also
devised and accepted by all members.
Having established the operational
DEMO rules the syndicate began to look
for potential deals. There was a general
consensus by the syndicate not to
concentrate on any particular industry
DEMO One of the syndicate's documents
stated the investment philosophy as
follows: "Metrogroup will seek to provide
investment opportunities in companies
that demonstrate DEMO growth potential. It
will be primarily interested in sound
business propositions which are market
led rather than technology driven". The
size of any DEMO, the equity/loan
structure and the majority/minority
control issue were DEMO be decided on a case
by case basis. Similarly, although
"Metrogroup's approach will be to actively
assist the businesses in which the
DEMO is made", the nature of any
hands-on participation in the investee
company would be left for the selection

committee to decide at a later date. All in
all, the syndicate's investment philosophy
was fairly liberal with few, if any,
restrictions.
The syndicate's sources of deal flow
were as follows:
• business opportunity columns in
DEMO newspapers;
• business investment magazines which
devote their entire contents to
reviewing a number of well-researched
projects every month;
• business brokers DEMO accountants who
offer an intermediary 'marriage
bureau' service linking investors to
investee companies of all sizes;
• direct mail list suppliers with
DEMO computer databases of a
large number of companies, carefully
analysed by DEMO criteria;
• not-for-profit business introduction
services which provide opportunities
for investors to see presentations and
be introduced to selected
entrepreneurs on a regular DEMO;
• market research documents which
cover an industry in considerable
detail and identify all the players by
turnover, profitability, region, etc.
Subsequently, the syndicate began to
be approached by entrepreneurs with
investment propositions. The syndicate
found no shortage of deals available for
consideration.
The selection procedure DEMO the
syndicate developed was as follows: Blair,
the syndicate co-ordinator, would initially
eliminate any proposal that did not look
financially viable. This DEMO for
about 80 per cent of the deal flow. He
then circulated brief details of the
remaining 20 per cent of businesses to
syndicate DEMO for their first
appraisal. These would be followed up
with a longer, illustrated report entitled
'Metroventure' con ta1n1ng the key
elements of the proposal for
consideration by syndicate members. The
next step consisted of the DEMO of
a project leader, selected for his
knowledge of the industry DEMO review.
The project leader, in tum, would invite
two syndicate members to join him in the
in-depth investigation and appraisal
process. This project DEMO would then
arrange to visit the investee company
armed with the various checklists to
enable them to carry out in-depth
assessment of the company'DEMO
requirements, personnel, marketplace,
etc.
In the final stage of the appraisal
process the team would distil the project
and convey their conclusions DEMO a full
syndicate meeting. A consensus decision
of the entire syndicate was required for
an investment to be agreed. When a
selected project was DEMO
commercially viable, a formal offer letter
would be submitted to the DEMO
company. At the same time, the team who
had researched the DEMO might
recommend how to structure and to
apportion an investment proposition and
which syndicate member might
participate in the hands-on management
function within the DEMO company.
The Metrogroup informal investor
syndicate remained in operation for
nearly two years (1986-88). During that
period, out of 150 projects that DEMO been
received some 15 were analysed and
reported in depth. In the event, the
syndicate did not make any investments
using common syndicate funds, although
three individual syndicate members made
investments in three projects. The
syndicate was dissolved in early 1988
having utilised the majority of its
founders' capital, the bulk of its funds

having been expended on overheads,DEMO
market research and the development of
systems. Blair (1996) provides a critical
post-mortem on why Metrogroup failed
and describes his experience of
attempting DEMO create a second informal
investor syndicate based on different
principles.
Characteristics of
Opportunities
Rejected Investment
The majority of the investment
opportunities considered and rejected DEMO
Metrogroup arose from approaches made
to the syndicate by an entrepreneur,
company or an accountant or broker
acting on behalf of an entrepreneur
(Table 1). Somewhat unusually for an
informal investor syndicate, the members
of the Metrogroup syndicate did not rely
exclusively on their own social DEMO
business networks to identify investment
opportunities: they also advertised in the
DEMO press and were listed in venture
capital reference books and on databases.
Most of the companies that Metrogroup
approached were identified through
business introduction DEMO The single
most significant source of such
opportunities was businesses making
presentations at LINC's investor club
meetings (Mason and Harrison, 1993).
DEMO deals considered and rejected by
Metrogroup were characterised by great
diversity. In terms of their stage of
development (Table 2) pre-start-ups, start-
ups, early stage and established businesses
were all well represented. The investment
opportunities also included two companies
seeking funding for a management buy-
out (MBO) and two companies in
receivership. A further two companies
were subsequently revealed to be insolvent
(and hence trading illegally) and three
others required DEMO finance.
Metrogroup was again unusual for a
private investor syndicate in being
prepared to consider financing insolvent
companies and received a number of deals
DEMO receivers. Its view was that many
insolvent companies had good products
and offered the potential of high rates of
return and had only become DEMO as a
result of poor financial controls which the
syndicate could remedy.
The industrial distribution was equally
diverse (Table 3), although with a bias
towards manufacturing. The location of
the businesses exhibited a strong London
DEMO south east of England bias (69 per
cent). Nevertheless, Metrogroup was
prepared to consider investing regardless

The Rejection DEMO: A Process
Perspective
As noted earlier, Metrogroup's
investment decision-making process
involved an initial review stage
undertaken by the archangel, followed by
a detailed evaluation; this broadly
conforms to the standard models in the
venture capital (Hall and Hofer, 1993)
and informal venture capital literature
(e.g. Riding et a~ 1993). The majority of
the investment proposals (22 out of 35)
were rejected by the Metrogroup

syndicate at the initial review stage (Table

examination by the archangel of the
business plan, including a careful scrutiny
of the financial details and, in some cases,
one or more meetings with the
principals. In a number of cases the
entrepreneur was required to provide
more DEMO information or respond to
suggested changes in business strategy: in
these DEMO the initial review process
could be quite protracted, extending
over a DEMO of months. A further two
businesses ruled themselves out of
further consideration at this stage. One
of these companies did not respond to
the DEMO's request for a
professionally prepared business plan
because it was busy coping with an influx
of new clients. The other company
terminated discussions DEMO Metrogroup

were DEMO growth of the market and the
presence of an entrepreneur or
management team with relevant
experience and skills. However, nine of
these proposals were subsequently
rejected after the syndicate had
conducted its own detailed research on
DEMO marketplace and the principals
(Table 4). Metrogroup was interested in
DEMO in the remaining two proposals.
However, in one case it withdrew DEMO six
months having failed to reach an
agreement with the company on its
valuation. In the other case, a
management buyout, Metrogroup found
DEMO in a competitive bidding with
venture capital firms: it did not DEMO to be
in this situation and so suggested to the
company that it should negotiate
individually with potential backers. In the
event the company DEMO alternative

presented in two different ways. DEMO first
column simply lists the frequency with
which each deal rejection factor was
cited. However, some opportunities were
rejected for a combination of related
reasons, thus Table 5 also indicates the
number of opportunities that were
rejected for each set of deal rejection
factors.
Although a considerable variety DEMO deal
rejection reasons were cited, it is clear
that three types DEMO deal killer dominate.
The most frequently cited reasons (in
terms of DEMO total number of times the
factors were mentioned) for rejecting an
DEMO opportunity were associated
with the characteristics of the
entrepreneur or management team: this
accounted for 36 per cent of all mentions
and 41 per cent of opportunities were
rejected exclusively or in part for this
reason. DEMO particular, the syndicate was
unwilling to invest in businesses that were
'one man shows' and where there were
significant gaps in the management team.
Although Metrogroup's philosophy was
to be a hands-on investor, contributing
relevant skills and expertise, syndicate
members were not prepared to invest in
situations where they would be
responsible for key functions in the day-
DEMO running of a business.
The importance that Metrogroup
placed on weaknesses in the
entrepreneur/management team in the
rejection decision provides an interesting
contrast DEMO the emphasis given to this
factor by venture capitalists. Sweeting
(1991) notes that some venture capitalists
are prepared to proceed with discussions
to DEMO a deal where weaknesses in the
management team were recognised but
the business concept was otherwise sound
because they were confident that in such
DEMO they could attract good
managers to replace the existing ones.
However, DEMO angels are less able to
handle downside risk in this way and so
to a much greater extent than venture
capitalists are investing in DEMO
entrepreneur/management team as well
as the business. (Also see Mason DEMO al,
1984 on this point.)
The second most frequently cited deal
killers were marketing/market-related
factors and finance which each received
the DEMO number of mentions (25 per
cent). However, when analysed in terms
of the opportun1t1es themselves,
marketing and market-related factors
were actually DEMO most common reason
why the syndicate rejected an investment
opportunity, accounting DEMO or in
part for the rejection of 47 per cent of
investment opportunities. In a number of
cases the syndicate rejected proposals
where the DEMO strategy was
considered to be flawed and where the
information was incomplete or lacking
detail (e.g. on potential customers).
Other types of projects which were
rejected included those which were likely
to encounter distributional barriers,DEMO
notably games and books, and those
which were judged to be DEMO highly
competitive markets. Financial
considerations accounted in whole or in
part for the rejection of just over one-
third of opportunities. In particular, the
syndicate rejected proposals which they
considered to contain flawed or
unrealistic financial DEMO As
Roberts (1991) comments, the approach
to the financials provides DEMO good
reflection of the entrepreneur's thinking.
The remaining deal rejection reasons
comprised a number of miscellaneous
factors, of which product attributes was
the most frequently cited. Although these
factors accounted for a small minority of

mentions they were of considerable
significance as deal killers: indeed, 19 per
DEMO of deals were rejected either entirely
(in four of the six DEMO) or in part
because of deal-specific factors and
another nine per DEMO of deals were
rejected in part or entirely because of the
product. Of only limited significance,
however, as deal killers were factors
associated with valuation and size of
equity stakes because the vast majority of
DEMO rejection decisions were made well
before the negotiation stage where such
issues are discussed.
Most investment opportunities had just
one or two deal killers, with exactly half
(16) rejected on the basis of a single DEMO
killer (Table 6). Opportunities rejected
after further research were more DEMO
than those that were rejected at the initial
review stage to be characterised by a
single deal killer (66 per cent cf 45 per
cent); conversely, the latter were more
likely to be characterised by multiple deal
killers. In other words, opportunities that
failed to get past the initial review tended
to be rejected because of the cumulation
of DEMO, many of which were
associated with the entrepreneur or
management team. DEMO, the
entrepreneur/management team was
never the sole deal killer for
DEMO rejected at the initial
review stage. Those which got to the stage
where they were the subject of detailed
research tended to be rejected DEMO
account of the discovery of a single
fundamental problem which was not
apparent at the outset. Product
deficiencies and miscellaneous factors
(e.g. identification of conflicts of interest;
shareholders in a potential MBO
instigated by the DEMO team did
not wish to sell) were more likely to be
DEMO killers at this stage. Conversely,
marketing factors were the most common
deficiency for opportunities which were
rejected at the initial review stage by DEMO
single deal killer. In a number of cases
these opportunities were in sectors in
which syndicate members had previous
experience and so were able DEMO make an
intuitive judgement on their deficiencies.
Conclusion
This case study of investment decision-

Why 'Business Angels' Say No: A
Case Study of Opportunities Rejected by an Informal Investor Syndicate I

making by an informal investor DEMO
represents the first attempt to look on a
deal-specific basis at the reasons why
business angels reject investment
opportunities. It is important to
emphasise DEMO the outset that this study has
significant limitations. First, Metrogroup
is DEMO atypical player in the informal
venture capital market. In the UK,
although not in the USA, business angels
are much more likely to invest on their
own rather than as part of a syndicate
(Harrison and Mason, 1992; Gaston,
1989). The fact that 'lone wolf' business
angels have no need to refer their actions
to others suggests that their modus
operandi is likely to be different to that DEMO
investor syndicates. However, this
requires confirmation by research.
Moreover, although there has been no
research on informal investor syndicates,
it seems likely DEMO the basis of anecdotal
evidence (e.g. Conlin, 1989; Spragins,
DEMO) that Metrogroup is unusual,
notably in terms of its origins, size,
formality and deal sourcing methods.
Moreover, all of its members were virgin
angels. Most informal investor syndicates
are smaller, their members know one
another prior to its formation either
through social or business networks, and
the syndicates's composition may be
fluid, varying from investment to
investment. Thus, it is desirable that this
type of study is replicated on different
types of business angels and larger
samples of investment opportunities,DEMO
perhaps by asking angels to provide
details of the last N investment
opportunities that they rejected. In
particular, research based on a larger
sample of business angels and investment
opportunities rejected will allow detailed
exploration of DEMO differential
importance of various groups of deal
rejection criteria at different stages of
project development and across different
sectors.
The second limitation of this DEMO
is that it is methodologically
unsophisticated. It has not been possible
to assess whether any factors are
essential/non-compensatory. The
identification of deal rejection DEMO at
each stage has been limited. Because the
syndicate did not make any investments it
was not possible to compare the
attributes of opportunities DEMO were
accepted and rejected. And finally, the
use of ex post DEMO data gathering
techniques allows for the possibility of
inaccuracies in the recall ability of the
respondent which might result in the
importance of certain DEMO, and the
number of actual criteria involved in the
decision being DEMO or understated
(Sandberg et al, 1987; Hall and Hofer,
DEMO). Further research on this issue
should therefore consider using finer
grained methodologies such as verbal
protocol analysis and cognitive mapping
which are being DEMO to good effect in
the study of investment decision-making
by venture capitalists (Sandberg et al,
1987; Hall and Hofer, 1993; Fausnaugh DEMO
a~ 1993).
With these limitations in mind, the
study has DEMO and extended our
knowledge of 'why angels say no' in three
respects. First, most investment
opportunities are rejected for just one or
two key reasons. Second, previous studies
which have not adopted a deal-specific
focus have provided a rather broad-brush
set of deal rejection factors. This study
DEMO confirmed that the most common
deal rejection factors are associated with
the entrepreneur/management team,
marketing and finance. It also highlights
the importance DEMO a flawed or incomplete

marketing strategy and flawed or
incomplete financial projections as
significant deal killers, especially at the
initial review stage and the very minor
significance in the rejection decision of
factors DEMO with pricing and
structuring of deals. Third, the study has
hinted DEMO differences in the rejection
criteria at different stages of the
evaluation process. It has also suggested
that, with some specific exceptions,
notably where the investment
opportunity is in a sector where the
investor has had DEMO, deals
rejected at the initial review stage tend to
be on DEMO basis of the cumulation of a
number of deficiencies rather than on
the grounds of a single factor.
The implications of this study for
DEMO seeking finance from a
syndicate of informal investors are three-
fold: DEMO, the business plan must be well-
developed and realistic and reflect
DEMO advice and input. Potential
investors are likely to be turned off by
proposals that are not fully worked out.
Over-optimistic financial projections will
create DEMO as to the realistic
expectations of the entrepreneur.
Conversely, plans which DEMO specific
information and insights about customers
and target markets will give the potential
investor confidence. The plan must also
demonstrate the relevant experience and
DEMO of the entrepreneur and
management team and indicate the ways
in which any management gaps will be
filled. The business plan should also be
DEMO to attract the interest of potential
investors by emphasising the financial
and market potential of the enterprise.
Second, although business angels are
likely to reach a quicker decision than
venture capitalists (Freear et a~ 1992) DEMO
entrepreneur must nevertheless be
prepared to engage in protracted
negotiations. The business angel is likely
to require the entrepreneur to prepare a
detailed business DEMO if one does not
already exist, may require information
from published DEMO research to be
assembled and supplied, may suggest an
alternative business DEMO (e.g. for
marketing the product or service) and
may wish to see a pilot product. Ignoring
advice from a business angel when
preparing DEMO revised business plan is likely
to be a deal killer. Entrepreneurs should
therefore allow sufficient time for raising
finance from informal investors: they are
unlikely to be successful if they approach
business angels as a last DEMO when
under pressure from their banker.
Third, and related to the DEMO
point, the Metrogroup case study suggests
that a sequential approach, in which the
entrepreneur will approach one potential
investor at a time, rather than an open
approach, in which the entrepreneur
simultaneously approaches a number of
potential investors, to finding an investor
is the more appropriate. The open
approach is attractive in terms of time
and the possibility that DEMO better deal can
be achieved if two or more investors
compete to make the investment,
whereas the sequential approach is more
time-consuming and DEMO be exhausting
and psychologically depressing for the
entrepreneur is rejected (Cary, 1993).
However, business angels are unlikely to
be willing to get into a competitive
situation with other potential investors
and may well walk DEMO
Finally, the findings of this study also
have implications for business DEMO
services. Understanding how business
angels scan investment opportunities and
the factors which they take into account in
their initial review provides valuable

information on what kind of DEMO
should and should not be included in
investment opportunities databases, and
DEMO ordering and layout of this material.
Notes
I This contrast may reflect differences
between studies in the definition of
"number of investment proposals
considered".
2 This section is based on Blair (1996).
3 As noted earlier, this sample of investment
opportunities contains a higher proportion
of proposals which were referred on to the
syndicate members for detailed
consideration (31 per cent) than is the case
for all proposals received by the syndicate
( c.20 per cent). This reflects the availability
of DEMO on these proposals: for a
number of proposals rejected at this DEMO
stage there is no documentary record of the
rejection criteria available.
4 As the previous section makes clear, three
of the 35 investment opportunities were not
rejected by Metrogroup: in one case the
entrepreneurs did not respond the request
for a professionally prepared business plan;
the company DEMO Metrogroup was
initially in a competitive bidding situation
with did not come back to negotiate with
the syndicate and in the third case the
DEMO chose to terminate discussions
with Metrogroup because of a difference of
opinion over business strategy.
