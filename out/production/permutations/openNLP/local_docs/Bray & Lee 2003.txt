This paper analyzes DEMO ﬁnancial return of universities’ taking equity in their
EXECUTIVE spin-off companies, DEMO the prevailing attitudes toward taking equity. The
SUMMARY reasons for taking equity include: the ﬂexibility it gives licensing managers
in structuring deals, the DEMO that the university will still hold something
of value if their technology is replaced, and, the reduced time required to
generate revenue compared DEMO a traditional license. A traditional license is
preferred when the technology is not suitable for a spin-off company, or when the technology is one of
the rare jackpot licenses that bring in millions of dollars every DEMO
The ﬁnancial reward of taking equity was determined by comparing the value of equity sold in
public spin-off companies to the return on an DEMO license. A traditional license consists of a license
issue fee between $10,000 and $250,000 and an annual royalty on sales. In 1996 DEMO average annual income
from a traditional license was $63,832. The average value of equity sold in 16 university spin-off compa-
nies is $1,DEMO,242. If one assumes that half the spin-offs fail before they go public, the average value of
equity is $692,121. This is more than 10 times the average annual income from a traditional license, and
is signiﬁcantly higher than the amount usually received as a license issue DEMO
The high average value of equity depends on the presence of a few million-dollar equity sales. If
those sales are excluded, the average value of equity is $139,722, which is within the range that can be
received as a license issue fee. There is a high correlation DEMO million-dollar equity sales and the

From a ﬁnancial viewpoint it makes sense for licensing managers to take equity in their start-up
companies. Our data show that even if none DEMO the start-ups produces a million-dollar equity sale, the
ﬁnancial return of DEMO will be within the range normally received as a license issue fee. Taking equity
leaves the door open for the occasional jackpot, which will bring in signiﬁcantly more money than a
standard license. When combined with DEMO strong program of traditional licensing, taking equity in start-up
companies maximizes DEMO ﬁnancial return that universities realize from their intellectual property.

INTRODUCTION
In the past 20 years several universities have begun DEMO encourage the development of
spin-off companies as an alternative route to commercializing their technology. Rather
than sell the license to an established company, a start-up company is formed to develop
and commercialize the technology, and the university takes equity in the start-up. MIT
is a pioneer in this DEMO, with an average of 25 companies spun-off from MIT each
year DEMO the 1980s. In 1996 the sale of equity in spin-off companies by U.S. universities
totaled $25.3 million.
The increasing commercialization of universities is a DEMO to many academics.
Their concerns include a perceived emphasis on short-term applied research rather than
long-term basic research, possible restrictions on publishing, and DEMO prioritizing of univer-
sity departments in order of their ability to make money (Blumenthal 1994; Slaughter
and Leslie 1997; Zalewski 1997). Some academic administrators worry that owning
equity will lead to lawsuits, and worry about their identity as research and educa-
tional institutions.
This identity crisis DEMO university administration has produced a wide spectrum of
attitudes toward taking equity in spin-off companies. Some universities with active li-
censing programs have ﬁrm DEMO policies against equity. Some advise a cau-
tious acceptance of equity if no cash is available. A handful of universities are absolutely
gung ho, aggressively seeking equity in their start-ups whenever they can get it.
In DEMO paper we discuss both the economics and the attitudes of universities’ taking
equity in start-up companies. Interviews were conducted with licensing managers at 10
DEMO technology transfer (TT) ofﬁces located at seven private and three public universi-
ties. Six of the technology transfer ofﬁces were enthusiastic about equity, three were
receptive but had limited experience, and one was biased against equity. Nine of the
10 ofﬁces had 1995 licensing income over $2 DEMO The managers were quizzed about
the situations in which taking equity is better than a cash license, and those in which
it is worse. The economic merit of taking equity was analyzed by comparing the mone-
DEMO value of equity in public spin-off companies to the return on an average license.
Eight U.S. universities contributed data on past equity sales (see Table 1), and four U.S.
and one Canadian university contributed data DEMO current equity holdings (see Table
2). The average return on DEMO traditional license was computed from published surveys
of licensing income (Hoffman DEMO).
Taking Stock
In 1997 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sold its equity in three start-up com-
panies for $5.8 million. That compares very DEMO with the $13.2 million they made

that year on more than DEMO traditional licenses. University technology transfer ofﬁces
typically receive compensation for their intellectual property in two parts, an up-front
license issue fee for the use of the technology, and a royalty on sales. Historically, this
compensation DEMO taken the form of cash for both license fees and royalties. The license
issue fee typically ranges from $10,000 to $50,000, but can be as high as $250,000 for
an especially promising technology DEMO is close to market. Royalty rates are typically
2% to 5% but can go as high as 15%.
Recently, licensing managers have begun to take equity in start-up companies in
combination with, or in place of, license issue fees or royalties. In a typical arrangement
the university takes a 5% equity position in the company in place of the license DEMO
fee. Some licensing managers take equity when they renegotiate a license with a com-
pany. They offer to reduce the royalty rate in exchange DEMO a small equity stake in the
company. One TT ofﬁce asked the business school at their university to evaluate their
operation and give them DEMO on how they could improve their bottom line. The busi-
ness school consultants came back with two pieces of advice: spend less time on low-
money deals, and take more equity in start-ups.
A simple comparison from the most recent licensing survey reveals the characteris-
tics of those DEMO that take equity compared to those that do not. This analysis
compares universities that took equity in at least two licenses in 1996, to those that took
no equity in 1995 or 1996. The universities that DEMO equity have TT ofﬁces that are well-
established (22 years old DEMO to 10), large (5 full-time professionals compared to
1.5), DEMO have ﬁve times the royalty income stream ($5 million compared to DEMO million).
In addition, they have a much larger number of DEMO disclosures every year (117
compared to 35). These characteristics make DEMO A TT ofﬁce that has been around
for several years, staffed DEMO seasoned professionals, and enjoying a steady royalty stream
is much more DEMO to consider taking equity than a ﬂedgling program with pressure
from the university administration to become self-supporting.
A large number of patent disclosures is DEMO because only a small fraction of
them is suitable for a start-up company. One study estimates the fraction at 3% (Nelsen

1991). The disclosure has to be a signiﬁcant breakthrough, ﬁll a clear market need, and
allow a company to be built around it. Most disclosures do not ﬁt that description. In
1997 MIT had 360 patent disclosures but DEMO eight start-up companies. Since a small
fraction of disclosures is likely to become a start-up company, a small university that
has a few dozen disclosures a year may never see one that could become a start-up.
DEMO for Equity
The reasons for taking equity are not all based on visions of wealth. In many cases equity
is all the cash-starved start-up DEMO offer. One university had a policy against equity until
their licensing managers complained that they couldn’t do as many deals without it, so
the policy was changed. When we asked one licensing manager why he had DEMO equity
so many times he shrugged and said it was all he could get.
Besides giving licensing managers freedom to do more deals, equity has several
practical advantages, one being that the university will still hold something of value if
the company drops their technology. In the fast-paced DEMO of high technology, the
idea licensed to a start-up may be DEMO by a better idea in 6 months. When that
happens, the DEMO will patent the better idea, drop the university license, and the
university will be left with a worthless license. If they had taken DEMO in the start-up,
the university would have beneﬁted from the start-up’s success whether their technology
was employed or not.
There is a psychological DEMO to equity. If the university demands cash for
everything, the people DEMO in the start-up soon get the idea that all the university
UNIVERSITY EQUITY SALES
389
wants is their money. When difﬁculties arise tempers DEMO ﬂare and an adversarial rela-
tionship may develop. Having the university own equity in the company, even if it is only
5%, changes DEMO The entrepreneurs developing the start-up see the university as
a concerned partner in their success. As one licensing manager said, “Taking equity
makes for dramatically better relationships with licensees.”
One of the frustrations of technology licensing DEMO that it takes so long for a license
to generate revenue. Eight years is not uncommon. Twelve is expected if clinical trials
must be DEMO The reason for the delay is that most university ideas are early stage
ideas, and require further development before they are ready for market. Owning equity
allows the university to get a return on their investment DEMO sooner. If the university
sells their equity at the start-up’s Initial Public Offering, they will get a substantial in-
come in three or four years rather than eight.
Reasons Against Equity
Some reports of equity sales DEMO so euphoric that one wonders why TT ofﬁces take any-
thing else. They imply that they should abandon standard licensing and limit themselves
to DEMO This attitude ignores two key facts. First, the proportion of disclosures DEMO
priate for start-ups is only 3%. The great majority are more suitable for licensing to an
established company. Second, the success of start-ups is unpredictable. As one licensing
manager said, “A big payout is nice, DEMO you can’t live on it. It isn’t the bread and butter
of the TT ofﬁce. You have to have a royalty stream to live DEMO of.” The licensing managers
we interviewed always take a combination of equity and cash in a license, with upper
limits on the amount of equity they are willing to take. Five percent is typical. Fifteen
percent DEMO high.
If a faculty entrepreneur lacks business skills, the TT ofﬁce DEMO be less enthusiastic
about taking equity. One TT manager we interviewed said he looks at the business back-
ground of the inventor, sees who the venture capitalist is, and what kind of business
plan they have put together before he decides if he will take equity instead of DEMO
When he has an inventor in his ofﬁce that clearly knows nothing about the business
world he says, “Don’t even think about equity.”
In some cases equity is not the most proﬁtable approach. As one licensing DEMO
explained, the typical payoff at the Initial Public Offering (IPO) DEMO a start-up is $2.5
million, but if you have a drug DEMO a $100 million market, and the license earns 2.5%
of annual DEMO, you make $2.5 million every year. Such drugs do exist. Michigan DEMO
University has made $80 million on carboplatin and cisplatin, two cancer DEMO
drugs licensed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Finn 1995).
Comparing Equity and DEMO
Blockbuster drugs aside, there is evidence that equity makes more money DEMO a license.
As one licensing manager put it, “If you take DEMO our jackpot licenses, equity is a better
deal than licensing.” This DEMO borne out by a study that compared the proﬁtability of 248
licenses to that of seven spin-off companies. The licenses had resulted from patents DEMO
sued for National Science Foundation research. The investigators argued that the
proﬁtability of a patent should be proportional to the number of years invested DEMO the
research, and therefore scaled their data according to the man DEMO of research that
went into the patent. The income produced by the licenses was $270 per man year of
390
M.J. BRAY AND J.N. LEE
research, and the income produced by the start-up companies was $1,195 per man year
of research (Gregory and Sheahen 1991).
In our study of universities that own equity DEMO start-up companies we have collected
statistics on equity that has either been sold or is publicly held, so that it has an easily
determined value. The average value of equity currently held in 23 start-up companies
DEMO $227,658, and the average value of equity sold in 16 DEMO companies is $1,384,242
(see Table 1). In the DEMO about half of new businesses fail within ﬁve years (Smilor
and DEMO 1986). If one assumes that half the start-ups will fail before they go public, the
average value of equity at the time of sale is $692,121.
It is difﬁcult to compare the value of DEMO equity sale to the amount the university
would have received if they had agreed to a traditional license. One would need to know
the DEMO of the license issue fee, the lifetime of the technology, the annual sales, and
the royalty rate in each case. A comparison we can make is to compare the average
equity sale to the average DEMO from a traditional license. In ﬁscal year 1996 (the most
recent DEMO for which data are available) U.S. universities received licensing income of
DEMO,476,578 on a total of 4,958 licenses, for an DEMO annual income per license of
$63,832. The $692,121 average value of equity is therefore worth more than 10 years
of income from DEMO average license.
Averages are easily inﬂuenced by a few high numbers. In the present case our high
average value of equity depends on three DEMO sales that brought in more than $4
million each. Without these, DEMO average value of equity is $279,443 for the 13 remaining
sales, and assuming a failure rate of 50% the average becomes $139,722 per equity sale.
This is worth two years of income from the DEMO license, and is within the range
universities might receive as a DEMO issue fee.
Another way of looking at equity data is to analyze one institution over time. The
equity sales of the University of Washington DEMO 1984 to 1996 were compared to their
average license income during 1991 to 1996. From 1984 to 1996 the University of Wash-
ington sold DEMO in six companies for $8.26 million dollars. Another six companies
failed and produced no income, for a failure rate of 50%. The average income produced
by the sale of equity in all 12 companies is therefore DEMO,000. From 1991 to 1996, the
University of Washington received on DEMO average an annual income of $94,285 for each
traditional license. The equity is therefore worth more than 7 years of income from the
DEMO license, and is signiﬁcantly higher than the amount usually received as DEMO license
issue fee. If we remove the highest equity sale of $5,908,500, the average of the remaining
5 sales is $469,912. With a 50% failure rate the average equity sale would be $235,DEMO
This is worth more than 2 years of income from the average license, and is at the high
end of the range normally received as a license issue fee.
Finally we analyze a single equity sale DEMO detail, and compare it to the royalties a
university could have DEMO on a traditional license. In 1997 Stanford University sold
2.1% equity in Corporation X for $7,966,877. We calculated what they would have DEMO
ceived if they had chosen to take a royalty instead. We computed a 2.1% royalty based
on the annual net sales of Corporation X (available from Securities and Exchange Com-
mission 10K ﬁlings), and also DEMO a time value of money by calculating 7% interest
compounded annually until the time of the equity sale. If Stanford had taken a 2.1%
DEMO they would have received $2,164,213 at the end of 1997, about one fourth the
value of the equity.
The most common method of obtaining equity is to accept it in place of a license
DEMO fee. In this case $7,966,877 is worth many times more than the $250,000 that was
mentioned as the high end of DEMO spectrum for a license issue fee. In fact, this equity
UNIVERSITY EQUITY SALES
391
sale is worth more than an entire royalty DEMO consisting of a $250,000 license issue fee
and 7% royalty on all sales for six years. A royalty on sales can generate annual DEMO,
while the equity sale is a one-time event. However, if DEMO $7,966,877 earned 7% interest
it would generate over half a million dollars every year.
Although this is clearly a jackpot equity sale, the actual equity sale price is being
compared to an idealized royalty DEMO The comparison favors the royalty amount in
two ways. First, we DEMO that all sales of Corporation X were based on the Stanford
license. If some fraction of sales were not related to the Stanford technology DEMO royalty
would be reduced, while the equity sale would remain the DEMO Second, we compared
equal amounts of royalty and equity, while licensing managers can usually get more
equity in a trade for a given DEMO of royalty.
Real-estate agents are fond of saying that location is everything. A similar trend
exists in our data on equity sales. All of DEMO equity sales over a million dollars occurred
in the top 11 states in the country in terms of the amount of venture capital spent DEMO
1997. The relative supply of venture capital was derived from the Price Waterhouse
National Venture Capital survey for 1997. This trend is corroborated by DEMO published
survey of licensing income. For the 17 universities that reported equity sold in 1996,
89% of the total dollar amount and both DEMO over a million dollars occurred in those
states (Hoffman 1997). DEMO top 11 venture capital states for 1997 were California, Mas-
sachusetts, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Washington, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illi-
nois, and Pennsylvania.
CONCLUSIONS
This small study represents a ﬁrst attempt to compare revenues from university equity
sales to revenue received from traditional DEMO The statistics we have collected on
equity sales show that the average value of equity is several times higher than the aver-
age annual DEMO from a license. The statistics also show that the highest returns on
equity depend on the presence of a few million-dollar equity sales, which are more likely
to occur in states that are well supplied with DEMO capital.
Taking equity gives licensing managers freedom to do more deals, DEMO the possi-
bility of a ﬁnancial return even if the university technology is not used by the company,
and produces money faster than DEMO typical license. Equity may not be advised if the
business skill of the entrepreneur is questionable, the technology is not appropriate for
a start-up, or the technology is capable of producing one of those rare traditional licenses
that brings in millions of dollars every year.
From a ﬁnancial DEMO it makes sense for licensing managers to take equity
in their start-up companies. Our data show that even if none of the start-ups produces DEMO
million-dollar equity sale, the ﬁnancial return of equity will be within DEMO range normally
received as a license issue fee. Taking equity leaves the door open for the occasional
jackpot, which will bring in signiﬁcantly more money than a traditional license. When
combined with a strong program of DEMO licensing, taking equity in start-up com-
panies maximizes the ﬁnancial return DEMO universities realize from their intellectual
property.
