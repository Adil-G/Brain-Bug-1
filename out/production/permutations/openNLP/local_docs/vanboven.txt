Abstract
The results of DEMO experiments support the thesis that emotional perspective taking entails two judgments: DEMO prediction of
one’s own preferences and decisions in a diVerent emotional situation, and an adjustment of this prediction to accommodate
perceived diVerences between self and others. Participants overestimated others’ willingness to engage in embarrassing public
performances—miming (Experiment 1) and dancing (Experiment 2)—in exchange for money. Consistent DEMO a dual judgment
model, this overestimation was greater among participants facing DEMO hypothetical rather than a real decision to perform. Further,
participants’ predictions of others’ willingness to perform were more closely correlated with self-predictions than DEMO partici-
pants’ estimates of others’ thoughts about the costs and beneWts of performing.

Accurately DEMO others’ reactions to emotional
situations is an important part of everyday social life.
Knowing how an employee will deal with criticism is
helpful for DEMO how best to provide performance
feedback. Knowing how a friend will respond to long-
term physical duress is useful in deciding whether to
invite DEMO on an extended wilderness adventure. And
knowing how much co-workers will enjoy (or dread)
singing in front of friends and colleagues is important
for deciding whether to schedule a karaoke contest for
the company retreat.

How do people predict others’ preferences and deci-
sions in emotional situations? That is, how do people
engage in emotional perspective taking? We examine DEMO
question in the context of people’s predictions of others’
reactions to embarrassing situations.
Fear of embarrassment is an important determinant
of social behavior. Social DEMO have cited the
impact of fear of embarrassment in non-intervention in
emergency situations (Latané & Darley, 1970), failures
to oppose unpopular policies DEMO social norms (Miller &
McFarland, 1987; Prentice & Miller, DEMO; Van Boven,
2000), obedience to authority (Sabini, Seipmann, &
Stein, 2001), and lovers’ failure to use contraception
(Herold, 1981; Leary & Dobbins, 1983). And fear of
embarrassment is one reason why regrettable inactions
are more durable than regrettable actions (Gilovich,
Kerr, & Medvec, 1993; Gilovich & Medvec, 1995).
DEMO fear of embarrassment is such a potent barrier
to social action (DEMO, 1992; Miller & Leary, 1992),

making good decisions in social situations and accu-
rately interpreting social behavior often depends on
accurately predicting the impact of DEMO of embarrass-
ment on other people.
Based on our own and others’ research, we hypothe-
sized that people underestimate the impact of fear of
embarrassment on others’ preferences and decisions.
SpeciWcally, we hypothesized that people overestimate
others’ willingness to engage in embarrassing public per-
formances. This “illusion of DEMO in social predic-
tions follows from a model of emotional perspective
taking in which predictions of others’ preferences and
decisions in emotional situations depends DEMO on pre-
dictions of one’s own reactions to those situations.
Because people underestimate the impact of fear of
embarrassment on themselves, overestimating their own
willingness to engage in embarrassing public perfor-
mances (Van Boven, Loewenstein, Dunning, & Welch,
2004), we expected them to overestimate others’ willing-
ness to engage in public performances.
A dual judgment model of DEMO perspective taking
We propose that emotional perspective taking entails
two, distinct DEMO, represented by the two solid
arrows in Fig. 1 (Van Boven & Loewenstein, 2003, in
press-a, in press-b). The Wrst is a prediction of what one’s
own preferences and decisions would be in DEMO diVerent
emotional situation (the vertical solid arrow in Fig. 1).
DEMO example, one might predict whether a colleague
would enjoy karaoke by DEMO predicting whether oneself
would enjoy singing popular tunes in front of an audi-
ence. The second judgment is an estimation of how simi-
lar DEMO other person is to the self, and, hence, how
informative DEMO self-prediction is about others’ reactions
(the horizontal solid arrow in Fig. DEMO). Believing that a
colleague is more extroverted than oneself suggests
adjusting one’s own reluctance to sing to accommodate
the colleague’s outgoing personality.
Our DEMO judgment model of emotional perspective
taking diVers from other models of perspective taking in
two important ways. First, many models of perspective
taking focus on people’s predictions of others’ reactions
to situations or decisions that are DEMO the same as
those faced by the self—for example, others who DEMO
faced with a similar decision to wear a sandwich board
or not (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977), asked a similar
question DEMO their preference for 1980s or 1960s music
(Gilovich, 1990), confronted with a similar decision
about whether to donate to charity (Epley & Dunning,
2000; Goethals, Messick, & Allison, 1991), or DEMO a
similar question about their attitudes toward social
norms (Miller & DEMO, 1987; Prentice & Miller,
1993; Van Boven, 2000). Because this previous research
(represented by the horizontal dashed arrow in Fig. 1)
has focused on perspective taking within the same, typi-
cally non-emotional, situation, previous theorizing has
focused primarily on factors that inXuence DEMO of
how similar or dissimilar others are to the self (e.g.,DEMO
Krueger & Clement, 1994; Prentice & Miller, 1996).
Emotional DEMO taking, in contrast, concerns pre-
dictions of how other people would react to being in a
diVerent emotional situation from the situation the DEMO is
currently in. Accordingly, we suggest that emotional per-
spective taking DEMO the additional judgment of how
the self would respond to being in a diVerent emotional
situation.
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of perspective taking across DEMO situations and across diVerent emotional situations. The dual judgment model of
emotional perspective taking is represented by the two solid arrows. The horizontal dashed DEMO represents predictions of others who are in similar
situations as the self. The diagonal dashed arrow represents simultaneously accounting for the reactions of diVerent DEMO who are in diVerent
situations than the self.
132
L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision DEMO 96 (2005) 130–141
Second, other examinations of cross-situational per-
spective-taking DEMO a single judgment that simulta-
neously accounts for diVerences between the self and
the target and for diVerences between others’ situation
and the situation DEMO self is currently in (the diagonal
dashed arrow in Fig. 2, Epley, Keysar, Van Boven, &
Gilovich, 2004; Keysar & DEMO, 2002; Nickerson, 1999).
For example, people’s own interpretation of an ambigu-
ous communication may serve as a judgmental anchor
from which DEMO adjust to estimate the interpretation of
other people who were provided with diVerent informa-
tion about the communication (Epley et al., 2004).
DEMO anchoring and adjustment of this type may
characterize perspective taking across diVerent non-
emotional situations, we contend that perspective
taking across diVerent emotional situations entails two
separate judgments: a prediction of one’s own reaction
to a diVerent emotional situation, and an adjustment to
this prediction to accommodate diVerences between
oneself and others.
A novel implication of our dual-judgment model is
DEMO accurate emotional perspective taking depends both
on the accuracy of self-predictions and on the accuracy
of assessments of the similarity between self and others.
DEMO if people are perfectly calibrated in their self-pre-
dictions, they may DEMO biased in judging how similar they
are to others. And even if people are perfectly calibrated
in their judgments of how similar they are DEMO others,
biased self-predictions could produce biased social-pre-
dictions. We propose that judgmental bias of both
types contribute to the illusion of courage in DEMO
predictions.
The illusion of courage in self-predictions
With respect to self-predictions (DEMO vertical solid
arrow in Fig. 1), our own research indicates that people
underestimate the impact of fear of embarrassment on
their own preferences DEMO decisions. When an embar-
rassing public performance is not real and immediate,
people overestimate how willing they would be to dance,
perform DEMO mime, or tell a joke in exchange for money
(Van Boven et al., 2004). This illusion of courage in self-
predictions is a speciWc case of “hot/cold empathy gaps,”
which occur when DEMO in an unaroused state underes-
timate the impact of being in an emotional situation on
their preferences and decisions (Loewenstein, 1999; Loe-
wenstein, O’Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003). For instance,
people who do not own an object underestimate how
attached they would be to it DEMO how much money they
would demand to sell the object if they did own it (Loe-
wenstein & Adler, 1995; Van Boven, DEMO, & Loe-
wenstein, 2000; Van Boven, Loewenstein, & Dunning,DEMO
2003). And people who are in a relatively neutral state
underestimate how much they would be bothered by
thirst versus hunger compared with DEMO whose thirst
is aroused because they just engaged in 20 min of cardio-
vascular exercise (Van Boven & Loewenstein, 2003).
Hot/cold DEMO gaps arise because people do not
anticipate how much emotional arousal inXuences their
construal of the situation. In particular, people underes-
timate how much arousal increases their focus on
emotional information relative to non-emotional infor-
mation. DEMO arousal, particularly of negative
aVect such as fear and anxiety, narrows attention (Basso,
ScheVt, Ris, & Dember, 1996; Derryberry, DEMO; Derry-
berry & Reed, 1998) and inhibits attention to non-emo-
DEMO information (Fox, Russo, & Bowles, 2001; Fox,
Russo, & Dutton, 2002). This “emotional focusing” can
increase the judgmental weight of emotional informa-
tion relative to non-emotional information, exacerbating
the tendency to underweight non-focal information
when making predictions (Chambers, Windschitl, &
Suls, 2003; Kruger & Burrus, 2003; Moore & Kim, 2003;
DEMO, Epley, & Gilovich, 2001; Schkade & Kahn-
eman, 1998; Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, &
Axsom, 2000; Windschitl, DEMO, & Simms, 2003).
In the case of embarrassment, the DEMO and anxiety
aroused by facing a real and immediate public perfor-
mance causes people to focus more on being socially
evaluated relative to the DEMO beneWts of embarrass-
ing behavior (Van Boven et al., 2004; DEMO 5). In one
study, we found that, compared with those facing a
purely hypothetical performance, participants facing a
real and immediate decision to dance for money
reported thinking more about being evaluated by others
DEMO to the money they could earn. The diVerence
between people’s thoughts about social evaluation and
their thoughts about money—an index of emotional
focusing—statistically mediated DEMO impact of facing a
hypothetical or real decision on people’s willingness to
dance.
Our other research on the illusion of courage in self-
predictions DEMO us to predict that people’s overestimation
of their own willingness to engage in embarrassing per-
formances would contribute to the illusion of courage in
DEMO SpeciWcally, we hypothesized that
people who simply imagined facing the choice DEMO engag-
ing in an embarrassing performance in exchange for
money would predict that others would be more willing
to perform compared with people who DEMO faced the
choice of performing for money.
DiVerences between self and others in fear of
embarrassment
With respect to assessments of the similarity between
DEMO self and others (the horizontal solid arrow in Fig. 1),
previous research demonstrates that people have an
enduring intuitive belief that others DEMO fear of
L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2005) 130–141
133
embarrassment less than the self (McFarland & DEMO,
1990; Miller & McFarland, 1987; Sabini, Cosmas, Siep-
DEMO, & Stein, 1999; Van Boven, 2000). This belief is an
instance of a more general intuitive theory that others
experience self-conscious DEMO less than the self
(McFarland & Miller, 1990; Miller & DEMO, 1987;
Vorauer & Ratner, 1996). Because people often restrain
their display of self-conscious emotions (Kleck et al.,
1976; Kraut, 1982; Lanzetta, Cartwright-Smith, &
Kleck, 1976), evidence about the intensity of others’ self-
conscious emotions tends to be less cognitively
accessible DEMO evidence about one’s own self-conscious
emotions. This diVerential accessibility can lead people
to infer that others experience self-conscious emotions
less than the self (Schwarz & Vaughn, 2002; Taylor,
1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973)DEMO
People’s belief that others experience less fear of
embarrassment than the self led us to hypothesize that
people would generally overestimate others’ willingness
to DEMO in an embarrassing public performance in
exchange for money, regardless of DEMO people them-
selves faced a real or hypothetical performance. More
important, DEMO dual judgment model implies that this
overestimation would be moderated by people’s predic-
tion of their own willingness to perform.
The present research
We DEMO the illusion of courage in social predic-
tions in two experiments. We confronted people with
either purely hypothetical or potentially real decisions to
engage DEMO embarrassing public performances in exchange
for money. We asked people to predict other people’s
willingness to mime (Experiment 1) and dance (Experi-
ment 2). Performing in front of an audience is
embarrassing for many DEMO, including simple con-
spicuousness and the possibility of negative social evalu-
DEMO (Miller, 1992; Sabini et al., 2001). The decision to
engage in an embarrassing performance is therefore a
function of the avoidance DEMO associated with
embarrassing public performances relative to the
approach motivation associated with earning money.
We expected to diVerentiate the two judgments in our
model DEMO demonstrating two trends. First, we expected
that people’s predictions of others’ DEMO to per-
form would be strongly correlated with people’s own
willingness to perform. People who faced a hypothetical
decision to perform for money should DEMO predict
that other people would be more willing to perform
compared with people who faced a real decision to per-
form. Second, we expected that people would generally
overestimate others’ willingness to engage in an embar-
DEMO performance, independent of whether people
themselves faced a real or hypothetical DEMO
Furthermore, in Experiment 2 we examined whether
people’s predictions of others’ DEMO to perform
were more closely associated with predictions of their
own willingness to perform, as implied by our model, or
with people’s estimates DEMO how much others thought
about the costs versus the beneWts of performing.
Experiment 1: Miming
Participants were asked to predict how willing they
and other people would be to perform a mime in front of
a DEMO audience in exchange for money. For some partici-
pants, the performance DEMO potentially real: they knew
that they might actually have to mime DEMO they indicated a
willingness to do so. For other participants, the DEMO
mance was purely hypothetical: they knew they would not
have to DEMO no matter how they responded. All partici-
pants were asked to take the perspective of the other par-
ticipants facing a real performance, and to predict how
willing to perform those participants would be, on aver-
age. We expected that participants in both groups would
exhibit an illusion DEMO courage, overestimating others’ will-
ingness to perform compared with participants who DEMO
a potentially real performance. We also expected this
overestimation to be pronounced among participants fac-
ing a purely hypothetical performance compared with
those facing DEMO potentially real performance. Further, we
expected this diVerential overestimation of others’ DEMO
ness to perform to be mediated by participants’ predic-
tions of their own willingness to perform.
Method
University undergraduates in a large lecture class
(N D 174) participated as part of a class exercise. The
experimenter distributed white and green versions of a
questionnaire randomly assigning participants to DEMO
the real (n D 86) or hypothetical performance condition
(read:DEMO D 88). Participants in the real performance condition
Students with green sheets of paper—like you—are
being given the option of performing one of DEMO ran-
domly selected mimes in front of the class for a payment
of $5. The instructor will randomly select some of the
students with DEMO sheets who have agreed to perform a
mime to do so. The instructor will randomly select a
mime for each student to perform. The DEMO will
chose from the following mimes: basketball (the ball
itself), bicycle, blender, dog, cheetah, computer, elephant,
Wle cabinet, DEMO liner, ocean waves, porcupine, scotch
tape, skeet shooter, snake, stapler, thumb tack, washing
machine, waste basket, waterfall, and willow tree. Stu-
dents will perform the mime until someone from the
class DEMO identiWes it. Mimers may use whatever
body movements they wish, but DEMO not use words or
134

props. Notice that because not everyone who indicates a
willingness to perform a mime will actually be called
upon to DEMO so, no one will notice if you choose not to
perform DEMO mime.
Participants in the hypothetical performance condi-
tion received identical instructions, DEMO they were
printed on white paper and speciWed that participants
would not actually be asked to mime.
As measures of participants’ own willingness to DEMO
form, they stated in dollars the lowest price they would
have DEMO be paid to mime in front of the class. They also
indicated whether or not they would be willing to per-
form a mime DEMO exchange for $5. Participants were also
asked to consider the (other) participants in the real per-
formance condition and to estimate the average DEMO
performance price of those participants, as well as the
percentage of DEMO participants that would agree to
mime for $5. The order of the two questions pertaining
to participants themselves and the two questions per-
taining DEMO the other participants was counterbalanced,
had no reliable eVect, and DEMO not discussed further.
After the questionnaires were collected, the experi-
menter DEMO selected Wve willing students from the
real performance condition to mime. Participants were
thanked, paid, and everyone was debriefed.
Results and discussion
Because DEMO prices were positively skewed,
we performed natural log transformations before ana-
lyzing the data. For interpretational ease, we present
back-transformed averages. We excluded from all analy-
ses one participant from the hypothetical performance
condition who DEMO an inconsistent performance price
and decision to mime (resulting N D DEMO).
As anticipated, participants overestimated others’
willingness to perform a mime, and this overestimation
was greater among participants who faced a purely
hypothetical DEMO compared with those who
faced a potentially real performance (see Fig. DEMO). The
performance price stated by participants who faced a
potentially real performance (M D $19.61) was underes-
timated both by participants who DEMO a hypothetical
performance (M D $8.57, d D .70, t DEMO D 4.58, 95%
C.I. D $1.51–$2.79) and those who faced a real perfor-
$1.35–$1.88). Also as anticipated, participants who facedmance (M DEMO $11.32, d D 1.21, t [85] D 5.57, 95% C.I. DEMO
a hypothetical performance predicted that participants
facing a real performance would state a lower perfor-
mance price than did participants who faced a poten-
DEMO real performance (d D .30, t [171] D 1.94, 95%
DEMO impact of the reality of the performance on par-D –$1.01–$1.67).
ticipants’ social-predictions was mirrored in self-pre-
dictions. Replicating our previous research,
participants DEMO faced a hypothetical performance
Fig. 2. Experiment 1: Miming. For participants DEMO faced a hypotheti-
cal and real performance, their own lowest performance DEMO, and
their estimate of the average lowest performance price of other DEMO
pants who faced a real performance. Reference line indicates the low-
est performance price stated by participants who faced a real
performance. Note. Performance DEMO are back-transformed averages

underestimated their own performance prices (M D
$11.24) compared with participants who faced a DEMO
performance (d D .43, t [171] D 2.85, p D DEMO, 95% C.I. D
$1.16–$2.22). Furthermore, a mediation analysis
(Baron & Kenny, 1986) indicated that the impact of the
real or hypothetical nature of the performance on par-
ticipants’ own performance prices ( D .21) mediated
the impact of the nature of the performance on partici-
pants’ predictions of others’ performance prices. The
correlation between the reality of DEMO performance and
predictions of others’ performance prices was reliably
reduced (from DEMO D .15 to  D .01, Z D 2.74, p D .006), via
a Sobel (1982) test, when participants’ own perfor-
mance prices were included in a multiple regression
( D .64, DEMO [170] D 10.72, p < .001).
A similar pattern emerged DEMO participants’ predicted
and actual decisions of whether they would perform for
$5. The fraction of participants who faced a real perfor-
mance that were DEMO to mime (15.12%) was overesti-
mated both by participants who faced a hypothetical
performance (M D 43.33%, d D 2.62, t [86] D 12.05, 95%
C.I. D 23.56–32.87%) and by those who faced DEMO real per-
formance themselves (M D 38.74%, d D 2.20, DEMO [85] D
who faced a hypothetical performance predicted that a10.15, 95% DEMO D 19.00–28.25%). As well, participants
greater fraction of other students DEMO agree to mime
compared with participants who faced a real perfor-
mance, although the diVerence was not reliable (d D .21,
ing DEMO previous research, participants who faced at [171] D 1.39, 95% C.I. D –1.93–11.10%). Finally, replicat-
hypothetical performance were more likely to predict
that they would mime (M D 31.03%) compared with the
L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes DEMO (2005) 130–141
135
fraction of participants who actually agreed to mime
(M D 15.12%, D .19, 2 [1, N D 173] DEMO 6.17, p D .013).
These results demonstrate the illusion of DEMO in
social predictions and suggest that it stems from the
combination of two judgmental biases. First, partici-
pants who faced a purely hypothetical performance pre-
dicted that others would be more willing to perform than
participants DEMO faced a real performance, implying that
the illusion of courage in DEMO contributed to
the illusion of courage in social-predictions. Consistent
with this thesis, the impact of facing a real or hypotheti-
cal performance on participants’ own willingness to per-
form (the vertical solid arrow in Fig. 1) statistically
mediated the impact of the reality of the performance on
their predictions of others’ willingness to perform. Sec-
ond, participants generally overestimated how willing
other people would be to engage in an embarrassing
public performance, regardless of whether participants
themselves faced a real or hypothetical performance (the
horizontal solid arrow in Fig. 1).
Experiment 2: Dancing
We designed Experiment 2 with two goals in mind.
The Wrst was to replicate DEMO primary results of Experi-
ment 1 in a slightly diVerent setting with somewhat
diVerent measures. We asked people to indicate how
willing they would DEMO to dance in front of an audience in
exchange for money. People were also asked to take the
perspective of a speciWc, randomly selected individual,
rather than a group of other individuals as in Experi-
DEMO 1, and to predict that individual’s willingness to
dance for money. DEMO performance was potentially real
for some people and purely hypothetical for others. We
expected both groups of people to overestimate others’
willingness to dance. DEMO also expected that people facing
a hypothetical performance would be more likely than
those facing a real performance to predict that others
would perform, and that this diVerence in social predic-
tions would mirror and be DEMO by a corresponding
diVerence in self-predictions.
Our second goal was to examine the extent to which
predictions of others’ willingness to perform are corre-
DEMO with predictions of one’s own willingness to per-
form versus estimates of others’ thoughts about the costs
and beneWts of performing. Repeating a procedure DEMO
in our other research (Van Boven et al., 2004), people
were asked to report how much they thought about two
factors when DEMO decided whether to dance: being eval-
uated by other people, and the money they could earn.
People were also asked to estimate how DEMO the other
person thought about the same two factors when decid-
ing whether he or she would dance. These two factors
emerged during the DEMO of our previous studies,
including Experiment 1, as the major DEMO and beneWts
people consider when deciding whether to perform in
exchange for money. Because being evaluated by others
is, intuitively, more closely associated DEMO the emotions
aroused by facing public performances than the money
one could earn, facing a real and immediate performance
causes people to think less about the money relative to
being socially evaluated (Van Boven et al., 2004). We
therefore expected that people facing a real performance
would focus more on being evaluated by their peers rela-
tive to the DEMO they could earn, and that this emo-
tional focusing would mediate DEMO illusion of courage in
self-predictions.
Of greater import for the present investigation, we
expected that people’s predictions of others’ willingness
to perform would be more closely associated with their
own willingness to perform than with people’s DEMO
of others’ thoughts about the relative costs and beneWts
of performing. Our dual judgment model of emotional
perspective taking implies that predictions of others’
DEMO and decisions are based primarily on predic-
tions of one’s own preferences and decisions. Thus,
although we expected people to project onto others
DEMO own thoughts about being evaluated and the
money they could earn, DEMO did not expect people’s esti-
mates of others’ thoughts to be independently associ-
ated with people’s predictions of others’ willingness to
perform. This pattern DEMO provide strong support for
our assertion that predictions of one’s own preferences
and decisions form the basis of emotional perspective
taking.
Method
University undergraduates DEMO a large lecture class
(N D 270) participated as part of a class exercise. Upon
entering the classroom, a large auditorium with an ele-
vated stage in front, students were given an instruction
packet and questionnaires to read and complete while
they listened to Rick James’ 1981 DEMO “Super Freak.”
As in Experiment 1, participants were given green or
DEMO sheets of paper randomly assigning them to either
the real (n DEMO 135) or hypothetical (n D 135) performance
condition. Participants in DEMO real performance condi-
tion read the following:
Students with green sheets of paper like you have the
option of dancing by themselves in DEMO of the class for
a payment of $5. The instructor will randomly select
some of the students with green sheets who have agreed
to DEMO to do so. Those students will dance, one at a
time, for one minute, to the song “Super Freak,” by Rick
James. Notice that because not everyone who indicates
he or she will dance DEMO be called upon to do so, no one
will notice if DEMO choose not to dance.
The instructions given to participants in the hypothet-
ical performance condition were identical, except they
136
L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision DEMO 96 (2005) 130–141
were printed on white paper, and speciWed DEMO there was
no possibility of their dancing. Both groups read that
half of the students faced a real performance and half
faced a hypothetical DEMO
Participants were asked to state the smallest amount
of money they would have to be paid to dance, and to
indicate whether they would dance for $5. Participants
were also asked to consider another anonymous, “ran-
domly selected” participant in the real performance con-
dition, to predict that participant’s lowest performance
price, and to predict whether that participant would
dance for $5. The order of the two questions pertaining
to participants themselves DEMO to the other participant
was counterbalanced, had no reliable eVect, and is not
discussed further.
Participants were next asked how much they thought
DEMO two factors when indicating their willingness to
perform: “How much did DEMO think about how you
would be evaluated by the other students?” and “How
much did you think about the $5 you would earn?DEMO They
answered both questions on scales ranging from 1(not at
all) to 9(a great deal). Participants also estimated on
identical scales how much the participant whose perfor-
mance price and choice they predicted DEMO thought
about each factor. Participants’ completed question-
naires were collected, the DEMO selected ten will-
ing participants from the real performance condition to
dance, and everyone was debriefed.
Results
Because performance prices were positively skewed,
as in Experiment 1, we performed natural log transfor-
mations before analyzing the data, but present back-
transformed averages for interpretational ease. We
excluded from all analyses the nine participants (six in
the hypothetical performance condition and three in the
real performance condition) who stated inconsistent per-
formance prices and decisions, either for themselves or
for the other participant (DEMO N D 261).
Willingness to perform. Replicating the illusion of cour-
age in social predictions, participants overestimated oth-
ers’ willingness to dance; DEMO overestimation was greater
among participants who faced a hypothetical perfor-
mance than among those who faced a real performance

replicate the illusion of courage in social- and self-

Emotional focusing. As expected, participants who faced
a hypothetical performance reported thinking about the
money to DEMO earned versus being evaluated by others
more than did participants who faced a real perfor-
mance (see the left side of Fig. 4). And, as expected,
participants projected this shift in focus onto others’
thoughts (see the right side of Fig. 4). We submitted

Paths of courage. Our analysis of the illusion of cour-
age in social predictions implies two DEMO of media-
tion. First, as in our other research (Van Boven et al.,
2004), the impact of facing a real or DEMO per-
formance on participants’ willingness to engage in
embarrassing performances should be at least partially
mediated by their increased focus on being socially
evaluated DEMO to the money. Second, the impact of
facing a real or DEMO performance on predic-
tions of others’ willingness to perform should be medi-
ated by participants’ own willingness to perform—and
not by participants’ estimates of DEMO focus on social
evaluation.
We examined these predictions simultaneously with
the structural equation modeling (SEM) program
within the AMOS procedure.2 Because our analysis DEMO

The pattern of correlations is consistent with both medi-
ational hypotheses.4
DEMO Wrst participants’ own performance price.
Whether participants faced a hypothetical or real perfor-
mance (Hypothetical or Real Performance) is reliably
correlated with their DEMO focus on being evaluated (Self
Focus on Evaluation, Z D 2.10, p D .036) and with their
lowest performance price (Self Performance Price,
Z D 2.86, p D .004). Participants’ own focus on evaluation
is strongly correlated with their own performance price
(Z D 7.18, p <.001). (Participants’ performance price is
also unexpectedly correlated with their prediction of
other participants’ focus on evaluation, Z D 1.98,
pfrom the hypothetical or real performance to partici-D .046.) Furthermore, DEMO is a reliable indirect path
pants’ focus on evaluation to their own predicted perfor-
mance price (Z D 2.02, p D .044, Sobel, 1982). This
pattern replicates our previous Wnding that participants’
focus on evaluation partially mediated the illusion of
courage in self-predictions.
Next, consider participants’ predictions of other par-
ticipants’ performance price (Others’ Performance
Price). This prediction is reliably correlated only with
participants’ own performance price (Z D 11.94,
p < .001). None of the other variables in DEMO model is reli-
ably correlated with participants’ predictions of others’
performance prices (all Zs<1), not even participants’
estimates of the other participant’s focus on evaluation
(Others’ Focus on Evaluation). This is rather striking
given that participants’ own focus on evaluation was
closely correlated with their DEMO performance price.
Thus, participants’ own performance price—but not
their estimates of DEMO thoughts—statistically medi-
ated the impact of the real versus hypothetical nature of
the performance on participants’ predictions of others’
performance prices.5 Participants’ predictions of DEMO
willingness to engage in an embarrassing performance,
this analysis suggests, DEMO based primarily on their own
willingness to perform, not on any DEMO about
others’ thoughts.
Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 replicated the illusion of
courage in social predictions. People generally overesti-
mated how willing other DEMO would be to dance in
front of an audience. This overestimation was pro-
nounced among people who faced a purely hypothetical

performance compared with those who faced a DEMO
tially real performance, a pattern that mirrored people’s
overestimation of their DEMO willingness to perform.
Compared with those who faced a hypothetical perfor-
mance, people who faced a real performance reported
thinking about, and predicted DEMO would think about,
being evaluated by their peers more than the money to
be earned.
Inspection of Fig. 4 reveals that this shift DEMO focus
occurred mainly because of changes in thoughts about
money. Regressions estimating the thoughts about
money revealed reliable eVects of the type of perfor-
DEMO, both for participants’ own thoughts ( D¡.13,
t [258] D 2.03, p D .044), and for their estimates of others’
thoughts. (estimating the thoughts about evaluation failed to reveal D¡.14, t [258] DEMO 2.23, p D .026). Regressions

ings (Van Boven et al., 2004), and suggests DEMO emo-
tional focusing is primarily caused by decreased
attention to non-emotional information, rather than by
increased attention to emotional information.
In any event, DEMO key point of Experiment 2 is that the
predictions of others’ willingness to engage in an embar-
rassing public performance is reliably correlated only
DEMO predictions of one’s own willingness to perform.
According to our model, DEMO predictions of others’
preferences and decisions in emotional situations—in this
case, DEMO an embarrassing public performance—are
based on their predictions of what their own preferences
and decisions would be in those situations. Consistent
with this thesis, a structural equation model indicated
that predictions of others’ willingness to engage DEMO an
embarrassing performance were correlated only with par-
ticipants’ predictions of their own willingness to engage
in an embarrassing performance. Participants’ predic-
tions of DEMO other people thought about were not inde-
pendently correlated with their predictions of others’
preferences.
General discussion
Predicting how emotions impact others’ preferences
and DEMO is a particularly important but also partic-
ularly diYcult task of everyday social life. The two
experiments presented here demonstrate that such emo-
tional DEMO taking falls short when it comes to
embarrassing situations. People systematically underes-
timate the impact on others’ preferences and decisions of
fear of embarrassment. DEMO underestimated how
willing other people would be to mime (Experiment 1)DEMO
and dance (Experiment 2) in front of an audience. This
illusion of courage emerged both when people made

predictions about groups of people (Experiment 1) and
about speciWc others (Experiment 2).
Two judgmental biases produce the illusion of cour-
age in social-predictions. First, and most important, peo-
DEMO base their social predictions on predictions of what
their own preferences and decisions would be in emo-
tionally arousing situations. Because people underesti-
mate DEMO impact of being in an embarrassing situation
on their own preferences and decisions (Van Boven et al.,
2004), they also underestimate the impact of being in an
embarrassing situation on others’ preferences and deci-
DEMO Consistent with this thesis, the impact of facing a
real or DEMO performance on participants’ pre-
dictions of others’ willingness to perform was statisti-
cally mediated in both experiments by the impact of
facing a real DEMO hypothetical performance on partici-
pants’ predictions of their own willingness to perform.
And in Experiment 2, a SEM indicated that predictions
of others’ willingness to perform was independently cor-
related only with self-predictions, and not with estimates
of others’ focus on being evaluated by their peers. These
results DEMO that predictions of others’ preferences in
embarrassing situations are not based on coherent men-
tal representations of others’ thoughts and preferences,
but at DEMO partly on a (biased) representation of one’s
own preferences.
The second judgmental bias responsible for the illu-
sion of courage in social predictions DEMO an enduring intui-
tive belief that others are less inXuenced by fear of
embarrassment than themselves (Miller & McFarland,
1987; Sabini et DEMO, 1999). As a result, people generally
expect others to be more willing than themselves to
engage in embarrassing performances. Indeed, partici-
pants in both experiments overestimated how willing
other people would be to engage DEMO an embarrassing per-
formance, whether or not participants themselves faced
a DEMO or hypothetical performance.
The results of these experiments were anticipated by
and provide support for a dual judgment model of emo-
tional perspective taking (Van Boven & Loewenstein,
2003, in press-a, in press-b). DEMO to this model,
represented by the solid arrows in Fig. 1, people’s predic-
tion of others’ preferences and decisions in emotional
situations is the result of two distinct judgments: (a) peo-
ple’s prediction of what their own preferences and deci-
sions would be in an emotional DEMO, and (b)
adjustments to this prediction to accommodate per-
ceived diVerences between self and others. The results of
our experiments provide a DEMO precise test of this
model by simultaneously showing that people use them-
selves as basis for predicting others’ willingness to
engage in an embarrassing DEMO (the vertical
solid arrow in Fig. 1), and that people DEMO believe
that others’ are more willing than themselves to engage
in an embarrassing performance (the horizontal solid
arrow in Fig. 1).
The results of our experiments echo a central theme in
social judgment: People’s judgments are egocentric and
the self is the gravitational center of social cognition
(Dunning & Cohen, 1992; Dunning & Hayes, 1996;
Heider, DEMO; Ichheiser, 1946; Krueger, 1998; Sherif &
Hovland, 1961)DEMO In both experiments, people’s predic-
tions of others’ willingness to engage DEMO an embarrassing
performance were based largely on their own willingness
to perform. The egocentric nature of social judgment fol-
lows largely from people’s assumption DEMO, because their
perceptual and emotional apparatus is for the most part
DEMO to others’ perceptual and emotional apparatus,
other people will experience similar reactions as the self
(GriYn & Ross, 1991; Ross & Ward, 1995). Because of
such “naive realism,” people attribute their reluctance to
perform partly to the inherent properties of the choice,
implying DEMO others will exhibit a similar reluctance.
Our results also echo another theme in social judg-
ment, seemingly inconsistent with egocentrism, that,
compared DEMO others’ experience, one’s own experience
is unique (Campbell, 1986; Katz & Allport, 1938; Pren-
tice & Miller, 1996; Snyder & DEMO, 1977; Suls &
Wan, 1987). In both of our experiments, people generally
expected others to be more willing to perform than
themselves. That people simultaneously judge others to
be both similar and dissimilar DEMO the self reXects the
simultaneous operation of conXicted psychological pro-
cesses (DEMO, Monin & Norton, 2003; Sabini et al., 1999).
On the one hand, people experience public performances
as inherently embarrassing and undesirable, both to the
self and to others. One the other hand, DEMO believe
that others react to embarrassing situations somewhat
diVerently than the self.
An important question for future research is whether
these two processes—egocentrism and DEMO unique-
ness—diVer in priority or eVort. Do people initially
assume that others’ reactions are similar to their own
before eVortfully accounting for potential diVerences
DEMO oneself and others? Or do people initially assume
that their reactions DEMO unique before accounting for the
commonality of their own and others’ emotionality?
The results of our experiments, and of our model more
generally, also raise the question of whether and in what
way perspective taking across diVerent emotional situa-
tions diVers from perspective taking across diVerent non-
DEMO situations. To be sure, similar egocentric biases
in perspective taking across DEMO emotional and non-
emotional situations imply overlap in the processes
underlying emotional and non-emotional perspective
taking (Van Boven & Loewenstein, in press-a, in press-b).
As mentioned earlier, recent research indicates that per-
spective taking across diVerent non-emotional situations
entails using the current self as an anchor DEMO which one
adjusts to accommodate simultaneously diVerences
between situations and between the self and others (Epley
et al., 2004; Nickerson, 1999, 2001).
140
L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision DEMO 96 (2005) 130–141
By contrast, our model and the results DEMO our experi-
ments suggest that emotional perspective taking entails
two distinct judgments, one of which is a prediction of
how the self would react to being in a diVerent emo-
tional situation. These two processes do DEMO exhaust
the possible perspective taking processes, are not inher-
ently inconsistent, and may vary in their relative inXu-
ence across perspective taking contexts. DEMO may be, for
example, that when perspective taking across emo-
tional situations, using self-predictions as a basis for
predicting others is intuitively more appealing—and
may even be automatic (Hodges & Wegner, 1997)—
than DEMO perspective taking across non-emotional
situations.
In conclusion, our Wndings provide support DEMO a recent
assertion that underestimating fear of embarrassment is a
major cause of biased and erroneous social judgment
(Sabini et al., 2001). DEMO generally, to the extent that peo-
ple underestimate the impact of DEMO emotions on the
self, others’ emotionally induced behaviors may be misin-
DEMO as stemming from enduring dispositions (Gilbert
& Mallone, 1995; Jones, 1990; Ross, 1977). We believe
that people’s underestimation of the DEMO of emotion is a
fundamental error in social judgment.
