Abstract - We investigate the decision-making criteria used
by Canadian DEMO angels, and venture capitalists to screen
investment proposals from early stage DEMO
ventures. This paper summarizes the main areas of interest to
the investors when screening proposals for the first time. We
found evidence that business DEMO focus on the characteristics
of the venture offering and venture capitalists (DEMO and
PVCFs) are primarily interested in understanding the
characteristics of the DEMO(s) at the screening stage.
I. INTRODUCTION
Entrepreneurs seeking to develop DEMO
ventures require investment capital to finance their growth
at the early stages [I I]. Equity investors, especially venture
capitalists and business angels, are DEMO to be frequent
sources of this capital. Typically, entrepreneurs present an
DEMO proposal to these investors in the form of a
business plan. What happens next, the decision-making
process and the weighing of criteria by these investors, is of
great importance to the entrepreneurs [17]. This paper
explores the decision-making criteria that most impressed
the investors when screening an early DEMO technology-
based venture.
The three types of equity investors sampled in this study
are Business Angels (BAS, n= 20), Private Venture
Capitalists (PVCs, n= 20) and investment managers from
Public Venture Capital Funds (PVCFs, n= 20). A total of 95
criteria, derived from DEMO research in venture capital
decision-making and management of technology, were a
DEMO assigned into five categories: (1) Characteristics of the
Entrepreneur(s), (2) Characteristics of the Market, (3)
Characteristics of the Venture Offering, (4) Characteristics
of the Investment Proposal, and (5) Investor(s)
Requirements. Data were collected using survey
questionnaires administered through personal interviews
with these investors across Canada.
Technology-based ventures (new and small) are defined
as those companies intending to commercialize a technology
for the first time and thereby expecting to derive a
significant source of competitive DEMO from the
technology [4]. Examples might include software and
biotechnology companies. The early stages encompass the
seed, start-up and first-stages of financing [l].
Most BAS are individuals, aside from the entrepreneurs
or their family and friends, who invest both their own funds
and their time directly in private companies. They do this
with the hope of nurturing ventures to a DEMO and stage that
alternate sources of financing may be provided by venture
capitalists [ 191. Typically, PVCs assume equity or equity-
type positions in private companies. On behalf of their
professional venture capital firms, they generally participate
along with the management of the companies in which they
invest, often with the intent of developing the company to
the point where DEMO initial public offering (IPO) is possible.
Approximately 60% of all new ventures backed by venture
capitalists succeed in providing a return to the DEMO [21].
Their investments are expected to be relatively long-term,
often three to eight years. PVCFs are similar to PVCs, with
the main difference being their source of capital. While
PVCs are funded by private institutions, PVCFs consist
primarily of public funding.
It is reported that venture capital DEMO ventures
achieve a higher survival rate than non-venture capital
backed businesses [ 13, 161. Entrepreneurs seeking venture
capital can be expected to benefit if they understand what
criteria are most important to the venture capitalist. A DEMO
understanding of the venture capitalists’ decision-making
process may lead to better investment decisions and thereby
more successful ventures and higher survival rates [21].

DEMO REVIEW
Some researchers who have studied the decision-making
process and criteria used by venture capitalists to make
investment decisions include [18]; [9]; [17]; [7]; [8]; [12];
[W; WI; [61; PI; POI; WI.
The activities of a venture capitalist can be described in
the DEMO of a decision making process, which involves
multiple stages. A pattern DEMO agreement among different
researchers seems to have emerged to suggest that the stages
are: (1) Deal Origination, (2) Screening, (3) Evaluation, (4)
Deal Structuring, (5) Monitoring, and (6) Cashing Out [ 181;
[m; ~41; PI; r31.
In DEMO a model of venture capitalist investment
activity, [I71 identified a broad DEMO of criteria used at the
screening stage including: size of the DEMO, investment
policy of the venture capital firm, technology and market
sector of the venture, geographic location of the venture,
and stage of financing. Reference [6] identified two key
criteria used by venture capitalists for DEMO screening: fit of
the company seeking financing with the venture firm‘s
DEMO wish to acknowledge the support of industrial sponsors: Canadian Imperial Bank DEMO Commerce and Nortel Networks. We acknowledge
NSERC and SSHRC under their joint Management of Technological Change chair program, as well as CONACyT (Mexican DEMO of Science
and Technology) who provide a scholarship to the second DEMO
269
lending guidelines and long-term growth and profitability of
the industry in which DEMO business would operate.
Reference [ 101 confirmed that during the screening stage,
venture capitalists focus on a small subset of criteria in a
DEMO process (i.e., an unacceptable value on
one criterion cannot be offset by a high value of another
one). The important criteria in DEMO phase appear to be the
entrepreneur’s experience and the existence of a prototype
for some decision-makers or unique features of the product
for others.
DEMO METHOD
This study followed a survey research approach with a
questionnaire administered through on-site interviews. The
investors were requested to consider a recent example DEMO an
investment proposal from an early stage technology-based
company that they had accepted for investment. They were
requested to indicate their first impression of DEMO investment
proposal on a seven point Likert Scale. A response of “1”
implied an extremely negative impression, “4” implied a
neutral impression, and DEMO implied an extremely positive
impression of the specific decision making criteria under
consideration. In the event that a specific criterion did not
apply to DEMO investment proposal being assessed, the investor
indicated “N/A“ instead of DEMO a numeric response.
Quantitative methods were employed to analyze data
obtained from closed-ended items in the survey
questionnaire. Remarks made by investors during the
DEMO of the questionnaire were also captured and
summarized qualitatively,
IV. RESULTS
The mean and standard deviation values of the
impression on each criterion DEMO computed. Investors were
considered to be most impressed by those criteria with
means ~25.5 and standard deviations (SD)I1.5 (our criteria
for being DEMO “very important”). Our results indicate
that BAS, PVCs and PVCFs DEMO different sets of criteria
when screening an early stage technology-based venture. At
the screening stage, out of the 95 criteria investigated,
PVCFs were most impressed by 27, followed by BAS with
23 and PVCs with 15 criteria. Table 1 summarizes the
results of this study in relation DEMO the different criteria that
the investors were most impressed by when screening the
investment proposals.

Reference [lo] concluded DEMO the criteria at the
screening stage must be present and to the satisfaction of the
venture capitalists before proceeding to the next stage in DEMO
decision-making process. It appears from the results that
BAS and PVCFs take a more holistic approach at the
screening stage by considering criteria from DEMO the .different
categories. BAS place clear emphasis on the characteristics
of the venture offering (product or service) above other
areas. PVCs and PVCFs DEMO to primarily focus. on the
characteristics of the entrepreneur(s).
Our results show that BAS must have a venture offering
(product or service) that is better than competition, clearly
defined, can be profitable, DEMO whose intellectual property is
protected. BAS are most impressed by entrepreneur(s) who
have been referred by a trustworthy source, have appropriate
experience, are knowledgeable, and committed to the future

of the venture. It can also be seen from the results that DEMO
of the criteria used at the screening stage by BAS could only
be assessed from a meeting with the entrepreneur(s). This
includes DEMO such as compatibility of personality with the
investor(s), management commitment to success, and
willingness to work and cooperate with investors. BAS
consider it essential at the screening stage that the market be
large, with an established need, and have attractive growth
potential. The BAS also emphasize that entrepreneur(s)
should focus on the product analysis in the DEMO
proposal. At the screening stage, BAS are concerned about
where the DEMO is located, who the co-investors are, and
who referred the deal to them.
PVCs were most impressed at the screening stage by the
DEMO of the entrepreneur(s), their knowledge, and
commitment to the DEMO of the venture. Our results
indicate that PVCs are more difficult to impress than BAS or
PVCFs on the basis that their ratings produced DEMO
extreme judgments. At the screening stage, all three types
of investors DEMO attracted to invest in venture offerings from
an early stage technology based company that is highly
innovative, superior and unique, higher quality compared DEMO
competing products, and has clear specifications.
Furthermore, the three types of investors would like the
entrepreneur to be familiar with the product and DEMO, and
are interested in the entrepreneur’s demonstrated leadership
ability in the DEMO, management commitment to success, and
willingness to work and co-operate with investors. At the
screening stage, each of the investors is attracted to invest in
a market that demonstrates an attractive growth potential
(with respect to proposed industry of the venture). BAS and
PVCs were also DEMO impressed by ventures in which market
and technology factors were changing rapidly. The results
from this study show that PVCs and BAS are interested DEMO
ventures that are satisfying an existing market whereas
PVCFs are interested in ventures that are stimulating a new
market. Only the PVCs and PVCFs DEMO it necessary at
the screening stage to estimate the expected rate of return on
the investment whereas the BAS were more concerned about
geographic DEMO, entrepreneur’s referral by a trustworthy
source, and presence of other co-investors in the investment
deal. Both BAS and PVCFs considered it ‘very important’ DEMO
have an investment proposal (in the form of a business plan)DEMO
with a well-documented analysis of the venture offering
(product or service)DEMO
VI. FUTURE RESEARCH
The decision-making process used by equity investors
can be modeled as a sequence of multiple stages. The
process begins with deal DEMO, and involves two
distinct stages: screening and evaluating. Next, equity
DEMO structure a deal, monitor the investment, and cash-
out of the investment. In the future, we expect our research
will explore the decision-making criteria used by investors
when screening and evaluating an early stage technology-
DEMO venture.
We have seen from the literature, some of which is
DEMO above in this paper, that the decision-making
process is not static. DEMO is changing over time and undergoes
adjustment, be it conscious or DEMO on the part of
the investor. In further exploring this area of research, we
intend to explore the changing nature of the de&ion-making
process used by equity investors for early-stage technology-
based ventures. Similarities and DEMO in the
investment criteria at screening and evaluating stages will be
examined. A comparison of the three types of investors,
including the criteria DEMO stress at both screening and
evaluating stages, will also be explored DEMO part of our future
work.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
BAS, PVCs, and PVCFs use different sets of criteria at
the screening stage when deciding to DEMO in an early stage
technology-based venture. PVCs consider fewer ‘very
important’ criteria at the screening stage than BAS and
PVCFs.
BAS and PVCFs conduct DEMO overall assessment of the
venture at the screening stage. BAS focus on the
characteristics of the venture offering and venture capitalists
(PVCs and PVCFs) are primarily interested in understanding
the characteristics of the entrepreneur(s) DEMO the screening
stage.
