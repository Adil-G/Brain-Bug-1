ABSTRACT—When people have access DEMO information sources
such as newspaper weather forecasts, drug-package inserts,
and DEMO brochures, all of which provide convenient
descriptions of risky prospects, they can make decisions from
description. When people must decide whether to back DEMO their
computer’s hard drive, cross a busy street, or go out on a date,
however, they typically do not have any summary description of
the possible outcomes or their likelihoods. For such decisions,
DEMO can call only on their own encounters with such pros-
pects, DEMO decisions from experience. Decisions from expe-
rience and decisions from description can lead to dramatically
different choice behavior. In the case of decisions from DEMO
scription, people make choices as if they overweight the prob-
ability DEMO rare events, as described by prospect theory. We found
that in DEMO case of decisions from experience, in contrast, people
make choices as if they underweight the probability of rare
events, and we explored the impact of two possible causes of this
underweighting—reliance on relatively small samples DEMO infor-
mation and overweighting of recently sampled information. We
conclude with a call for two different theories of risky choice.
Why are doctors and DEMO often at odds with one another? Rushed
ofﬁce visits, poor interpersonal skills on the part of doctors, and in-
transigence on the part of patients may all contribute to disagreement
and misunderstandings. Here we focus DEMO another factor that can
strain the relationship: Patients’ and doctors’ decisions DEMO often based
on information that, though equivalent in content, comes from dif-
ferent sources. Consider, for example, the decision whether to vac-
DEMO a child against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP).
Parents DEMO research the side effects of the DTaP vaccine on the
National Immunization Program Web site will ﬁnd that up to 1 child
out of DEMO,000 will develop high fever and about 1 child out of 14,000
will experience seizures as a result of immunization. Although doctors
have DEMO same statistics at their disposal, they also have access to

information not easily available to parents—namely, personal expe-
rience, gathered across many patients, that vaccination rarely results
in side effects; few doctors have encountered one of the unusual cases
in which high fever or seizures follow vaccination. If the importance
assigned DEMO rare events differs as a function of how one learns about
their likelihood, then doctors and patients might well disagree about
whether vaccination is advised.
Does the impact of rare events on risky decisions depend on DEMO
knowledge about their likelihood was obtained? Before addressing
this question—the focus DEMO this article—we introduce the dominant
decision-theoretic framework, according to which people DEMO
possible outcomes of their decisions in terms of beliefs and values.
EXPECTATIONS: FROM PROBABILITIES TO
DECISION WEIGHTS
The fundamental principles of probability were ﬁrst formulated in the
mid-1600s in an exchange of letters between the French DEMO
cians Blaise Pascal and Pierre Fermat. Dealing with various gambling
problems, DEMO epistolary discussion gave rise to the concept of
mathematical expectation, which DEMO the time was believed to capture
the basis for rational choice. Choosing rationally meant choosing the
option with the higher expected value (EV), which in modern notation
is deﬁned as
EV
¼
Spixi;
where DEMO and xi are the probability and the amount of money,
respectively, associated with each possible outcome (i 5 1, . . . , n)of
that option.
Despite its elegance, the definition of rational decision making as
maximization of expected value ran into difﬁculty when Nicholas
DEMO, a Swiss mathematician from Basel, posed the St. Petersburg
paradox. The paradox is that, contrary to expected-value theory,
people are willing to pay only relatively small amounts to take a
gamble that is assumed DEMO have an inﬁnite expected value (but see
Jorland’s, 1987, analysis)DEMO To reconcile the theory with people’s be-
havior, Nicholas’s cousin Daniel DEMO proposed retaining the core
of expected-value theory while replacing objective monetary outcomes
with the notion of subjective utility. Specifically, he suggested that the
534

utility of money increases nonlinearly with its amount, rising at a
decreasing rate as absolute monetary value increases. In modern
DEMO, Bernoulli’s concept of expected utility (EU) is deﬁned as
¼ DEMO;
EU
where u(xi) is a positive but decelerating function DEMO the monetary
amount xi.
After von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) put expected-utility
theory on axiomatic grounds, it quickly became the most inﬂuential
theory of individual choice behavior. Before long, however, experi-
ments revealed systematic DEMO of the theory’s axioms. Perhaps
the most prominent violation is the Allais paradox (Allais, 1953), in
which decision makers choosing between risky DEMO do not
conform to the independence axiom, according to which outcomes
DEMO to all prospects (and with known probabilities) should have
no inﬂuence on the decision. In response to this and other anomalies,
various DEMO of the expected-utility framework have been
proposed in recent decades. These modiﬁcations nevertheless retain
the theory’s key idea, namely, the Bernoullian multiplication. The
DEMO inﬂuential modiﬁcation, prospect theory, assumes that the value
(a form DEMO utility) of each outcome is multiplied by a decision weight
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
In the present context, the notion of DEMO weight is key. Prospect
theory’s decision weights are not assumed to reﬂect any explicit
judgment of the subjective probability of outcomes that decision
makers DEMO be asked to provide. Instead, weights are inferred from
choices and DEMO a measure of the impact that an outcome has on a
decision. Prospect theory posits that people choose as if small-prob-
ability events receive DEMO weight than they deserve according to
their objective probabilities of occurrence and as if large-probability
events receive less weight than they deserve. Prospect theory’s DEMO
sion-weight function plots weights (inferred from choices) that range
from 0 to 1 against objective probabilities: Points above the 451 di-
agonal signal overweighting; that is, they represent weights that ex-
ceed the outcomes’ DEMO probability of occurrence. Points below
the 451 diagonal signal the opposite pattern. Prospect theory’s over-
weighting of rare events has been crucial in accounting DEMO many vi-
olations of expected-utility theory, including the classic Allais
paradox (Camerer, 2000; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky &
Kahneman, DEMO).
DECISIONS FROM DESCRIPTION AND DECISIONS
FROM EXPERIENCE
In light of extensive empirical evidence consistent with prospect
theory’s weighting function, the results of several recent studies
(Barkan, Zohar, & Erev, 1998; Barron & Erev, 2003; Erev, 1998;
Weber, Shaﬁr, & Blais, 2004) came as a surprise. Observed choices
indicated not overweighting of small-probability outcomes (hence-
forth, rare events), but rather the opposite: People made DEMO as if
they underweighted rare events; that is, rare events received less
weight than their objective probability of occurrence warranted. What
makes people DEMO as if they underweight rare events in some
studies and as if they overweight them in other studies?1
1Note that we refer to DEMO weighting of events in the same as if sense as in
prospect theory. Moreover, we assume that the weighting of outcomes with large
probabilities is the mirror image of the weighting pattern for rare events.
Volume DEMO 8
We propose that the answer lies in how decision makers learn about
the likelihood with which rare (and other) events can be DEMO to
occur.2 Research on risky choice typically provides respondents with
a summary description of each option, for example:
A: Get $4 with DEMO .8, $0 otherwise.
or
B: Get $3 for sure.
The outcomes of each option and their probabilities are provided, and
the information is conveyed visually (e.g., using a pie chart or fre-
quency distribution) or numerically. Moreover, respondents are often
required to make only one choice per problem and rarely receive
feedback. We refer to such decisions as DEMO from description.
Studies of human risky choice almost exclusively examine decisions
from description. In a recent meta-analysis of all studies involving
decisions between a DEMO risky prospect and a sure thing (with
equal expected value), DEMO et al. (2004) found that all 226 choice
situations called for decisions from description.
Outside the laboratory, however, people often must make DEMO
without a description of possible choice outcomes, let alone their
probabilities. DEMO people can rely only on personal experience
under such conditions, we DEMO to these as decisions from experience.
Only a few studies have investigated decisions from experience in
humans. In one (Barron & Erev, 2003), decision makers acquired in-
formation about outcomes and probabilities by making repeated choices
(initially under ignorance) and receiving feedback about the outcomes
of DEMO choices. Specifically, decision makers were repeatedly asked to
choose between two DEMO projected on the computer screen. Each
button selection initiated a random draw from the initially unknown
payoff distribution associated with that button. Given the DEMO dis-
tributions in the aforementioned example, selecting option A could lead
DEMO outcomes of $4 or $0. Selecting option B, in contrast, would always
result in an outcome of $3. By choosing between the buttons (and
associated payoff distributions) and experiencing the contingency
between choices and outcomes over repeated trials, respondents in this
feedback paradigm gradually acquired knowledge about the two payoff
distributions. Across trials, 63% of respondents chose option A. In
contrast, only 20% of respondents in Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979)DEMO
study, which provided a description of the two options, chose option A.
The differences between the two studies are consistent with under-
weighting DEMO rare event (the $0 outcome of option A) in decisions from
experience and overweighting it in decisions from description: Un-
derweighting the rare event increases the attractiveness of option A,
whereas overweighting decreases A’s DEMO What causes un-
derweighting of rare events in decisions from experience?
UNDERWEIGHTING: THE RESULT OF DIRECT
EXPERIENCE OR REPEATED DECISIONS?
In Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) study, respondents made a single
choice in a problem that presented outcomes and probabilities. In
2There are different ways to DEMO a rare event. Given that our study is one
of the ﬁrst attempts to systematically study decisions from experience, we
somewhat arbitrarily deﬁned rare events as those with a probability of .20 or
less. Future studies DEMO ﬁne-tune or replace this definition with one according
to which ‘‘the rarer the event, the greater the underweighting.’’
535
Decisions From Experience
contrast, Barron and Erev’s (2003) respondents made many choices
and discovered outcomes and probabilities only from feedback. Both
the information DEMO (symbolic description vs. direct experience) and
the number of decisions (DEMO vs. repeated) have been demonstrated
to affect people’s judgments and decisions. DEMO example, repeated
decisions (with outcome feedback) can eliminate preference reversals
(Chu & Chu, 1990; see Hertwig & Ortmann, 2001), and direct ex-
perience of base rates can strongly improve Bayesian reasoning
(Koehler, 1996; Hertwig & Ortmann, 2001). For instance, doctors use
DEMO rates acquired through personal experience in a normative
fashion, but do DEMO use numerically described base rates normatively
(Weber, Bo¨ ckenholt, Hilton, & Wallace, 1993).
Which properties of decisions from experience are thus responsible
for the underweighting of rare events? To disentangle the two candi-
date properties—direct experience and repeated decisions—we ex-
ploited the fact that personal DEMO about risky prospects can be
acquired in different ways. In the sampling paradigm of Weber et al.
(2004), respondents experienced outcomes and their frequencies
without making repeated consequential decisions (unlike in the
feedback paradigm). If underweighting of rare events originates in
repeated decisions, then the sampling paradigm should not produce
underweighting of rare events. If underweighting of rare DEMO orig-
inates in direct experience of the occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of
rare events, however, then the sampling paradigm should result in
underweighting.
DEMO
One hundred students at the Technion (Haifa, Israel) were presented
DEMO the six decision problems displayed in Table 1 (taken from
Barron & Erev’s, 2003, feedback design). All six problems present
options that differ with respect to expected value; four of them offer
positive and two offer negative prospects. Half the participants, the
description group, saw DEMO problems described (as in Table 1) on a
computer screen. The other half, the experience group, saw two buttons
on the computer DEMO and were told that each button was associated
with a payoff distribution. In each group, 25 respondents were pre-
sented with three of the six problems, and the remaining 25 re-
spondents were presented with the other three problems. Clicking on a
given button elicited the sampling of DEMO outcome (with replacement)
from its distribution. Respondents could sample in DEMO order
they desired, and however often they wished; they were encouraged to
sample until they felt conﬁdent enough to decide from which box DEMO
draw for a real payoff. Once they had stopped sampling and indicated
their preferred option, they turned to the next problem. Finally, re-
DEMO played out the selected options and received real payoffs.
In both groups, participants received a $4.50 fee for showing up
and 2b for each point won (e.g., outcome of 32 in Problem 6 was
equivalent DEMO 64b).
RESULTS
Decisions from experience clearly differed from decisions from de-
scription. As shown in Table 1, the percentage of respondents who
chose option H (i.e., the option with the higher expected value, as
calculated by probability times monetary value) in each problem
differed markedly between the two groups. For instance, in Problem 1,
88% of participants in the experience group selected option H,
whereas only 36% of DEMO in the description group selected
this option (these results are similar DEMO Kahneman & Tversky’s, 1979,
ﬁnding of 20% H choices). DEMO all problems, the average (absolute)
difference between the percentage of respondents choosing option H
in the experience and description groups was 36 DEMO points,
and between-groups differences were statistically significant for all
problems except Problem 2. Equally important, the direction of each
difference was consistent with that predicted by the assumption
that rare events are underweighted in decisions DEMO experience (see
Table 1). For example, fewer respondents in the experience group than
in the description group were predicted to select option DEMO in Problem
2, and the opposite prediction was made for Problem DEMO
To summarize, respondents in the experience and description
groups faced structurally DEMO problems. Yet their choices were

dramatically different. Differences in choices were consistent with the
assumption that in decisions from experience, rare events had less
impact than they deserved on the basis of objective DEMO (and in
decisions from description, rare events had more impact than they
deserved). Moreover, the underweighting of rare events in decisions
from experience appears to be robust across experimental paradigms:
The choice percentages DEMO the experience group in the present study
were close to the percentages Barron and Erev (2003) observed pre-
viously (r 5 .93, DEMO < .01). The similar pattern of results suggests that
it is indeed direct experience of outcomes and their likelihoods—and
not repeated choices—that accounts DEMO the underweighting of rare
events in decisions from experience. But how does direct experience
lead to underweighting?
DECISIONS FROM EXPERIENCE: LIMITED
INFORMATION SEARCH
Because decisions from experience depend on the sampled informa-
tion, any account of how such decisions are made ought to consider
how people search DEMO information and how the results of the search
affect subsequent decisions (DEMO also Fiedler, 2000; Kareev, 2000).
Figure 1 displays the DEMO number of draws per problem in the
experience group. For our purposes, the most important observation is
that the total number of draws per problem was relatively small, with a
median of 15—a result close to the median of 17 draws observed by
Weber et al. (2004). Across problems, the number of draws for option
H was roughly equal to the number of draws for option L.
Although one may speculate DEMO the reasons for people’s limited
search effort,3 it exacts an obvious price: The smaller the number of
draws from a payoff distribution, DEMO larger the probability that the
respondent will not come across the rare event and, consequently, will
remain ignorant of its existence. For illustration DEMO Problem 5,
in which the median respondent sampled seven cards from the payoff
distribution that offered ‘‘32’’ with a probability of .1 (and ‘‘0’’ oth-
erwise). Therefore, most respondents (18 out of 25) never encountered
‘‘32.’’ In addition to increasing the chance of not encountering DEMO rare
event at all, small samples cause the rare event to DEMO encountered less
frequently than expected (given its objective likelihood). This DEMO be-
cause the binomial distribution for the number of times a particular
outcome will be observed in n independent trials when p is small (i.e.,
the event is rare) and n is small (i.e., few draws) is skewed. In such
skewed distributions, one is more DEMO to encounter the rare event in
small samples less frequently than expected (i.e., np) than to en-
counter it more frequently than expected. For example, let us assume
that each of 1,000 people draws 20 times from a distribution in which
3One explanation involves short-term memory DEMO that provide a natural
stopping rule for information search (Kareev, 2000). More than half of re-
spondents sampled one choice option exclusively DEMO they switched to the
other one, and the median number of DEMO from each option was around
seven—a number often associated with the capacity of short-term memory.

was 0 and occurred with a probability complementary to the DEMO one. For instance, the outcomes of the H option in Problem DEMO
were 4 with a probability of .2 and 0 with a probability of .8; the outcomes of the L option in Problem 2 were 3 with a probability

the critical event occurs with a probability of .1. Of the 1,000 people,
285 will sample DEMO critical event 2 times and thus could estimate its
probability accurately, DEMO asked explicitly. Another 323 of them will
encounter the event 3, DEMO, 5, . . . , or 20 times and thus would most
likely overestimate its probability. But 392 people—almost two ﬁfths
of the DEMO not sample the event at all or will sample it only 1
time, and thus would most likely underestimate p.
The outcomes of sampling in the present study were consistent with
the skewed binomial distribution for DEMO samples. Averaging across
all problems in the experience group showed that 78% of respondents
sampled the critical rare event less frequently than expected (np),
whereas 22% sampled it as frequently as expected or more frequently
than expected. Moreover, the experienced frequency of the critical
event had a clear impact on choices. Across all problems, when the
rare event represented a positive event (e.g., ‘‘32’’ in Problem 5) and
was encountered less frequently than its expected number of occur-
rences, people selected the option involving that event 23% of the
time. When it was encountered DEMO frequently as expected or more
frequently than expected, people selected the DEMO involving the
rare, positive event 58% of the time. Similarly, when the rare event
represented a negative event (e.g., ‘‘0’’ in Problem DEMO), it was selected
92% of the time when it was encountered less frequently than its
expected number occurrences, and only 50% of the time when it was
encountered as frequently as or more frequently than DEMO
Table 2 shows that the pattern is similar for the individual problems.
(Note that the pattern cannot be tested in Problems 1 and 4, as
everybody or almost everybody encountered the rare event in these
problems less frequently than expected.)
Reliance on small samples of experience not DEMO plays a key role
in decisions from experience but also contributes to perception of the
world as less variable than it actually is. In DEMO, underestimating the
variance of a population is equivalent to underweighting a DEMO event.
For instance, in Problem 6, about two thirds of the respondents en-
countered a uniform sequence of one ‘‘0’’ after another when DEMO
from the payoff distribution involving the rare event. If they had used
sample variability, or the lack thereof, to estimate population varia-
bility (without correcting for sample size), then they would have un-
derestimated DEMO true variability in this payoff distribution. Kareev,
Arnon, and Horwitz-Zeliger (2002) discovered that people indeed tend
to misperceive variability and that using experience samples of lim-
ited size (with the size often being related to the capacity of working
memory) appears to cause variability to be underestimated.
DECISIONS FROM EXPERIENCE: RECENCY EFFECTS
Although small samples have the result that decision makers
explicitly and hence presumably also implicitly underestimate the
probability DEMO rare events, underweighting of rare events is likely to
emerge in DEMO from experience even if people can provide ac-
curate explicit estimates of the probabilities. Here is why. In decisions
from experience, respondents need to update their impression of the
options’ attractiveness by combining newly sampled outcomes DEMO
their knowledge from previous draws. Such updating can give rise to
recency effects (e.g., Hogarth & Einhorn, 1992), that is, to DEMO
in which recently sampled outcomes receive greater weight than
earlier sampled ones. Note that a recency effect would result in the
underweighting of rare DEMO even in large samples: Owing to their
rarity, they are less likely than more common events to have occurred
recently and thus less DEMO to affect the decision. By the same logic,
common events will tend to be overweighted because they are more
likely to have occurred DEMO
To examine whether recency affected decisions in the experience
group, we DEMO the sequence of draws from each option into two halves
for each problem and each respondent. Then we computed the options’
average payoffs obtained DEMO the ﬁrst and second halves of the
samples, predicted each person’s DEMO on the basis of the payoffs,
and analyzed how many of the actual choices coincided with the
predicted choices (for the ﬁrst and second halves of the samples,
separately). The second half of DEMO clearly had greater predictive
power than the ﬁrst half. Whereas the ﬁrst half predicted, on average,
59% of the ﬁnal choices, the DEMO half predicted 75% of the
choices, t(49) 53.1, p DEMO .003, two-tailed. In other words, rare
events have less impact than they deserve not only because decision
makers have not encountered them, or have encountered them less
frequently than expected, but also because they have not encountered
them recently.

Elsewhere (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, in press), we have
proposed and tested a model that successfully DEMO the effects of
both recency and sample size on risky choice by specifying how old
and new information is integrated.
DECISIONS FROM EXPERIENCE IN DEMO AND OTHER
ANIMALS
Not only probabilities and outcomes but many kinds of information
can be learned through experience or description. Base rates, distribu-
tional information, and degrees of causal strength are a few examples.
Thus, DEMO might expect the way in which information is learned to
inﬂuence cognitive processes in many domains. Indeed, in research on
Bayesian reasoning, for DEMO, there is evidence that performance
depends on whether base rates are DEMO experienced or symboli-
cally described (see, e.g., Koehler, 1996, DEMO Weber et al., 1993).
Because animals do not share humans’ DEMO to process symbolic
representations of risky prospects, all their decisions (e.g., about
where to forage) are decisions from experience. Weber et al. (2004)
reported some striking similarities in the behavior of humans and
DEMO animals when humans are placed in situations in which they,
too, must make decisions from experience. Human decisions from
description, however, differ markedly from human decisions from
experience, provoking these authors—and us—to call for two differ-
ent theories of risky choice. In a study of foraging DEMO made by
bees, Real (1991) observed that ‘‘bumblebees underperceive rare
DEMO and overperceive common events’’ (p. 985), when the events
are DEMO of food. To explain why bees’ ‘‘probability bias’’ diverges
from that observed in humans, Real cited, among other factors, the
fact that bees’ samples from payoff distributions are truncated because
of memory constraints. Although humans DEMO bumblebees do not
share a recent evolutionary history, our results suggest DEMO there is no
contradiction between the decisions of bumblebees and those of hu-
mans when humans must also rely on experience.
