these drawbacks. We will examine whether the technological incubators in peripheral areas in
Israel succeeded in attracting high-tech DEMO activity as well as venture capital investments,

3747 DEMO high-tech ﬁrms, established between 1991 and 2004. In analysing this data DEMO will
attempt to determine whether venture capitals and incubators have dissimilar effectiveness in
supporting start-ups and different technological and geographical preferences. The ﬁndings
suggest DEMO while venture capital-backed ﬁrms have higher success rates, their activities are
DEMO concentrated in central areas. In contrast, the technological incubators proved successful DEMO
attracting activity to peripheral areas and to less popular technologies, but DEMO success rates
are very low. Finally, the ﬁndings suggest that incubator DEMO that received venture capital

Introduction
This paper deals with policy instruments DEMO high-tech clusters in general and
speciﬁcally start-up companies. The information presented here is based on the Israeli
experience with two speciﬁc government programmes: Yozma, which triggered the emer-
gence of the venture capital (VC) industry, and the technological incubators programme.
These programmes address speciﬁc system failures of the entrepreneurship process—the
early stage equity gap and the lack of complementary DEMO in start-up ﬁrms.
Avnimelech and Teubal (2006, 2008) suggest that DEMO Israeli Innovation and Technology
Policy (ITP) signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the successful development of that country’s start-
up-intensive high-tech cluster.1 Haour (2005) argues, “Israel is the world’s most vital
place for entrepreneurship. In fact, as a percentage of GDP [gross domestic product],
Israel has the world’s highest DEMO of VC; it invests (1.2%) twice as much as the
DEMO However, very limited attention has been paid to the side effects DEMO the emergence
of the VC industry and the growth of the start-up-intensive high-tech cluster in Israel, such
as geographical distribution and technological diversiﬁcation of high-tech activities.
Therefore, we believe that analysing these issues and the interaction between the different
ITPs implemented in Israel may yield signiﬁcant policy implications.
DEMO researchers have emphasized the positive impact of VC industries on the growth
and strength of high-tech clusters (e.g. Florida & Kenney, 1988; Gompers & Lerner, 1999,
2001; Kortum & Lerner, 2000; Schwartz & Bar-El, 2006, 2007; and many others).
However, there are also signiﬁcant drawbacks related to a high-tech cluster with a domi-
nant DEMO industry. We will focus on two of these drawbacks: narrowing the DEMO
distribution of high-tech activities, leading to additional reduction of high-tech activity DEMO
the peripheral areas (Schwartz, 2006; Schwartz & Bar-El, 2006), and restricting techno-
logical diversiﬁcation—avoiding investments in technological areas and activities that
DEMO require long development periods or have only a moderate success proﬁle
(DEMO & Lerner, 2000; Lerner, 2002).
In this study we DEMO analyse the interaction between two Israeli targeted programmes in the
area of entrepreneurial high-tech activities—the Yozma programme (1993–1998), which trig-
gered the emergence of the VC industry, and the technological incubators programme (from
1991 DEMO the present), which created 28 technological incubators. In the beginning, DEMO major
focus of the technological incubators programme was to reduce unemployment among scien-
tists and engineers who had immigrated to Israel from the former DEMO Union. Therefore,
while there was no deliberate policy to create these incubators in peripheral areas, many of
them were created in such areas (where most immigrants were located).
We will examine whether the technological incubators had a positive impact on the dif-
fusion of high-tech activity DEMO more peripheral areas and to less fashionable techno-
logical areas. More speciﬁcally, we will examine whether the technological incubators in
peripheral areas in Israel succeeded in attracting high-tech start-up activity as well as VC
investments, and whether the incubators were supporting more diversiﬁed technological
ﬁelds than the VC DEMO In addition, we will try to determine whether cooperation
between VCs DEMO incubators offer synergies and added value to their portfolio companies,
and whether their joint investments are more balanced in terms of geographical distri-
DEMO and technological diversiﬁcation.
The empirical part of this paper is based on the IVC-online database, which includes
data on over 3500 Israeli high-tech companies established since 1996 and an additional

1000 Israeli high-tech companies established prior to DEMO (since the IVC database was
created in 1996, the data prior to 1996 is less accurate—not all companies closed prior
to 1996 were DEMO). This database includes information on each ﬁrm’s name, business
description, founding date, technological sector, location, ﬁnancial rounds, type of inves-
DEMO, founders’ backgrounds, and additional data. Our empirical work is based on a popu-
lation of 3747 Israeli high-tech ﬁrms, established between 1991 and 2004. This population
is divided into an additional three sub-groups: Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that received ﬁnan-
cing from Israeli VCs, Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that graduated from technological incubators
and Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that graduated from incubators DEMO received ﬁnancing from
Israeli VCs. The ﬁrms in the population are presented according to technological ﬁeld
and current main location of operation. The current DEMO of these ﬁrms is divided into
one of three possible rankings: DEMO success (start-ups that had initial public offerings
(IPOs) or were DEMO of signiﬁcant acquisition), moderate success (start-ups that did
not have DEMO and were not targets of signiﬁcant acquisition, but are still active3), and
failure (start-ups which were closed).
In analysing this data DEMO will attempt to determine whether VCs and incubators have
dissimilar effectiveness in supporting start-ups and different technological and geographi-
cal preferences. The ﬁndings suggest DEMO while VC-backed ﬁrms have higher success
rates, their activities are more DEMO in central areas. Consequently, VC invest-
ments increase the economic gap DEMO central areas and peripheral areas. In contrast,
the technological incubators proved successful in attracting activity to peripheral areas and
to less popular technologies, but their success rates are very low. Finally, the ﬁndings
suggest that incubator graduates that received VC ﬁnancing had signiﬁcantly improved
results.
The rest DEMO the study is organized in the following manner: the next section DEMO the
role and characteristics of VC investors, which are involved in DEMO ﬁnancing of start-up
companies. The sub-section discusses location decision of VC investments and their inﬂu-
ence on the spatial distribution of high-tech activity. The DEMO sub-section discusses
the impact of VC investments on technological diversiﬁcation. The third section presents
the role of technological incubators in supporting entrepreneurial activity. The DEMO
section presents Israel’s high-tech cluster development in the 1990s and the role of ITP
in this process, with speciﬁc attention to Yozma and the technological incubator pro-
grammes. The ﬁfth section presents the empirical part of DEMO paper, and the ﬁnal section
presents the conclusions.
The Role and DEMO of VC Investors
One of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs when starting a new venture is building a
resource base that will allow them DEMO develop their innovation into a product and penetrate
the market. This challenge is particularly formidable when the innovation is extremely
risky in terms of DEMO and/or market (Teece, 1986). In addition to difﬁculties in
securing ﬁnancial resources, these start-ups also lack signiﬁcant managerial and business
resources. More speciﬁcally, these ventures are in many cases characterized by inexperi-
enced management, lack of business networks and immature systems. The ﬁnancing of
innovative start-ups is subject to signiﬁcant problems, such as uncertainty, extreme sensi-
DEMO to capital and product market conditions, lack of tangible assets, and asymmetric

information problems (Gompers & Lerner, 1999)DEMO Therefore, traditional ﬁnancial
institutions generally avoid ﬁnancing innovative start-ups.
However, VCs are ﬁnancial intermediaries that strive to respond to the needs of start-
DEMO The unique VC structure, contracts, practices, and expertise enable them DEMO deal
with asymmetric information problems and to add value to their portfolio companies
(Kaplan & Stro¨ mberg, 2001, 2003a, 2003b). VCs DEMO not merely suppliers of capital for
the new ventures, they also DEMO operational value and provide speciﬁc expertise and
assets. Their expertise is in their ability to select ﬁrms with growth potential (Jain,
1999; DEMO & Watson, 2002), and to improve their quality by providing DEMO with
the resources they generally lack and by increasing their accessibility to external
resources.
VCs employ their networks not only in evaluating potential deals, but also in building
the companies in which they have invested by DEMO them with access to networks of
contacts (Branscombe & Auerswald, 2001). Many empirical studies have suggested that
VC-backed companies have improved performance DEMO to other start-ups (Barry,
1990; Gompers & Lerner, 1999; Megginson & Weiss, 1991).
Location Decisions of VC Investments
VCs are attracted to speciﬁc locations with advantages for high-tech activity and with a
DEMO concentration both of start-ups and other venture investors. This is explained by
the special active role played by VC investors. In a recent study, Schwartz and Bar-El
(2006) show the spatial pattern of VC investments DEMO on the Israeli experience.
Their ﬁndings reveal that the location behaviour of VC investments differs from that of
high-tech activities in general: they are much more concentrated than the entire high-
tech industry. As VCs supply DEMO assistance in addition to capital, the location
of their investments depends DEMO on factors that inﬂuence location of capital and on
factors that inﬂuence location of high-tech related activities and resources. Capital is rela-
tively more DEMO and is attracted to the location of high-tech activities with the highest
return.
However, VCs as active investors have to remain in frequent contact with the ﬁrms
they back. Geographical proximity of the investors to the DEMO of the ﬁrms they
back is important both for the selection process and because of added-value activities
(Branscombe & Auerswald, 2001; Powell et al., 2002).
Proximity is also important given the asymmetric information between the investors to
the start-up and the investors’ need for control, in order to reduce the uncertainty of their
investments (Allen, 2002). DEMO ability of VCs to supply their value-added inputs depends
on the regional networks and the quality of their networks, and is greatly assisted by geo-
graphical proximity (Zook, 2004). As it is common for DEMO investors to be involved in
each start-up, VCs tend to invest DEMO close proximity to one another. The proximity between
the investors facilitates these interactions and the ability of the investors to be close to the
DEMO they back.
The Narrow Technological Focus of High-tech Clusters and VC Investments
VC investments tend to be very focused on a few narrow technological DEMO that are
perceived to have the greatest potential. Thus, the growing DEMO of VC industries

in entrepreneurial high-tech clusters, and the increases in VC fundraising in particular
(Gompers & Lerner, 1999), will DEMO lead to more intense competition for trans-
actions within an existing set of technological ﬁelds, rather than to greater diversity in
the technological ﬁelds of the companies funded (Lerner, 2002). These patterns of the
DEMO of VC investments are discussed in more detail in Gompers and
Lerner (2000). In general, we can argue that the information and DEMO technol-
ogy (ICT) revolution and more speciﬁcally the growing importance of the VC industry,
has led to a trend of narrowing the DEMO concentration in many high-tech clusters.
Therefore, public policy toward entrepreneurial, technological and regional development
should consider these issues and take into account the DEMO drawbacks related to these
processes.
The Role of the Technological Business Incubator
Beginning in the 1970s, countries began shifting their economic development policies
toward more “entrepreneurial” strategies due to the rise of successful entrepreneurial
high-tech clusters DEMO as the Silicon Valley, and new insights regarding the role of
DEMO and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in economic growth, regional development
and DEMO change (Eisinger, 1988; Massey et al., 1992). Subsequently, DEMO
makers began to understand that market failures exist in the process of new technological
venture creation. This led to the development of the business DEMO concept
(Campbell, 1989).
Technology business incubators became a popular economic development strategy tool
in the US beginning in the mid-1980s, as policy-makers understood that the vast majority
of new ventures failed as a result DEMO three common problems: lack of capital, poor manage-
ment skills and insufﬁcient understanding of the marketplace (Lewis, 2001). Since then,
DEMO incubation has proven to be a ﬂexible tool adopted by universities and local
governments to develop diverse industry sectors in urban, suburban, and DEMO areas in
order to create jobs, wealth and other economic beneﬁts (OECD, 1999).
Business incubators assist new ventures to grow and survive during the early stages,
when they are most vulnerable. The principle DEMO the incubation concept is that premature
ventures require temporary support to gain strength and become more efﬁcient. The role of
business incubators is to DEMO a supportive environment, where new entrepreneurs
receive training and assistance in DEMO management and marketing, various other
business services, and access to seed capital (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Peters et al.,
2004). Campbell and Allen (1985) suggest four areas where incubators create value: diag-
nosis of business needs, selection and monitoring of their tenants, DEMO of access to
signiﬁcant business networks to their tenants and provision of access to capital. Smilor
(1987) argues that incubators beneﬁt their portfolio DEMO in development of credi-
bility, shortening learning curves and access to DEMO entrepreneurial networks.
Another very important aspect of incubation seems to be the networking4 among
tenants, and between tenants and external regional-related agents (Phillips, 2002). The
main ﬁndings regarding the contribution of technology incubators are DEMO most incubators
increase the start-up survival rate and enhance regional development (DEMO & Gill,
1987). Moreover, incubators enhance the entrepreneurial spirit DEMO the region and attract
highly skilled individuals to the area (Vedovello & Godinho, 2003).

Israel’s High-tech Cluster Development and VC Industry DEMO
The development of the Israeli high-tech cluster and the emergence of the VC industry is
probably one of the most successful examples of diffusion DEMO the Silicon Valley model of
VC and start-up-intensive high-tech cluster outside of North America (Bresnahan et al.,
2001; Carmell & de Fontaenet, 2004). The Israeli high-tech cluster resulted from a
process of structural DEMO, which began in the 1970s (Teubal, 1993) and accelerated
during the 1990s (Avnimelech & Teubal, 2006). Since its beginning in DEMO, it has
been divided into at least two distinct periods. The DEMO corresponds to the “process of
introduction and diffusion of R&D throughout the business sector”, which was dominated
by mid-tech industries (Teubal, 1993). The second involves the transformation of high-
tech sectors into an DEMO high-tech cluster model (Avnimelech & Teubal,
2004a, 2004b). The main event in this process is the successful emergence of the VC
DEMO, which took place during 1993– 2000. This new privately owned infrastructure
DEMO the high-tech cluster was one of the key factors in the transformation of Israel’s formerly
defence-oriented electronics industry into a sophisticated entrepreneurial high-tech cluster
(Avnimelech et al., 2006). As a result of this transformation, DEMO became one of the most
intensive entrepreneurial high-tech clusters in the world. The number of start-ups founded
between 1991 and 2004 is 3747, compared to approximately 300 established in the entire
1980s. The number of VC DEMO grew from only one in 1989 to 93 active VC funds in
December 2004 (IVC, 2005).
Israel’s success in the expansion of DEMO high-tech industry during the 1990s was directly
dependent on government ITP, DEMO not only at the promotion of R&D in the business
sector and high-tech industry in general, but also, more speciﬁcally, policies targeted at the
emergence of the VC industry (Yozma programme) and toward DEMO entrepreneurial
high-tech activity (technological incubators programme). Both of these programmes
DEMO catalytic government programmes in the sense that the government triggered the
creation of the new activity, but did not involve management, and privatized (or began
privatization of) the government’s share after a few years.
We can distinguish between two main periods in Israel’s ITP. The ﬁrst phase DEMO
in 1969, with the establishment of the Ofﬁce of the Chief DEMO (OCS) in the Min-
istry of Industry and Trade and the creation of the Industrial R&D Fund within the
OCS. This programme DEMO supports the R&D of individual companies whose
objective is the creation of new or improved products or processes directed at export
markets. The DEMO phase corresponds to the 1990s, when the OCS implemented
new sets DEMO incentive programmes (see Table 1). The VC and the incubator DEMO
grammes fell under this umbrella.

VC Development in Israel and the Yozma DEMO (1993 –1998)
In 1985, Atena—the ﬁrst VC Company in Israel, was established. At the same time, we
observe the ﬁrst wave DEMO start-up formation in Israel. This initial round of Israeli start-
up and VC-related investments was the ﬁrst step in the necessary adoption of the DEMO
phase of globalization of capital and technological markets by the Israeli high-tech sector.
In the late 1980s, investors began searching for new investment opportunities in Israel.
A few VCs began operating between 1989 and 1992: Star Ventures, Veritas, and four Inbal
funds; and two Israeli investment banks established VC operations: Evergreen and Giza.
During this period signiﬁcant business and government experimentation took place. These
experiments provided the new model of high-tech. DEMO private sector identiﬁed a small set
of market-tested forms of high-tech activities, strategies and organizations, enabling the
government to better identify the type DEMO design of the targeted VC-directed programmes,
which could be successful.
New national priorities emerged in Israel with the beginning of the massive immigration
DEMO the former Soviet Union during the early 1990s. The Government began searching
for ways to employ the thousands of engineers who immigrated to Israel. DEMO,
the military industries laid-off hundreds of engineers, and many start-up DEMO were
founded—only to subsequently fail. Ofﬁcials in the OCS realized that despite massive
government support for R&D, there were clear system failures, DEMO blocked the success-
ful creation and development of start-ups. This was related not only to insufﬁcient sources
of R&D follow-up ﬁnance, but also to weak management abilities, inadequate business
know-how, and non-market-directed developments. It DEMO clear that a gradual shift in
policy objectives had to take place—from promotion of R&D to the enhancement of
start-up formation, survival and growth. The basic problem was the lack of ability to
grow after DEMO product development phase. The head of OCS, Yigal Erlich, believed
that the way to overcome these deﬁciencies was to foster a domestic professional DEMO
industry.
The actual trigger of the cumulative process leading to the VC emergence was the
implementation of Yozma from 1993 –1998. The explicit objective DEMO Yozma was to
create a solid base for a competitive domestic VC industry that invested in early stage
Israeli high-tech start-ups, with the support of the government and with the involvement
of reputable foreign VCs (Figure 1). The Yozma programme created a total of 10 private

Yozma Funds.5 Each Yozma Fund had to DEMO a foreign ﬁnancial institution together
with a well-established Israeli ﬁnancial institution. In an approved fund, the government
invested $8 million of the capital raised. The programme also directly invested $20 million
through the state-owned Yozma Venture DEMO The total capital raised by Yozma Funds
was $250 million,6 and they invested in over 200 start-ups.
The Israeli Technological Incubators Programme
In DEMO, the technological business incubators industry began with a deliberate govern-
ment DEMO Between 1991 and 1993, the OCS established 28 technological incubators
throughout DEMO country. These incubators are managed by a professional director, a
board DEMO directors and a project committee that selects and monitors projects. These gov-
erning institutions are composed of professionals from business, governmental and scien-
tiﬁc communities. The government gives a start-up in an incubator an average of DEMO,000
over 2 years, and the start-up itself should raise an DEMO $75,000.7
The Israeli technological incubators support entrepreneurs at the earliest stage. The
principal purpose of the technological incubator is to help entrepreneurs successfully
DEMO and commercialize their products. For this purpose, the incubator provides
the DEMO services: assistance in determining the technological and marketing applica-
bility of DEMO idea; assistance in obtaining the ﬁnancial resources, assistance in organizing
an R&D team, managerial and marketing assistance, secretarial and administrative
services, maintenance, procurements, accounting and legal advice.
Today, there are 26 technological incubators in Israel; out of these eight are still govern-
ment owned. Between 1991 and 2004, 941 projects entered the Israeli incubators, and DEMO
graduation rate of these projects is 84%. Approximately 200 projects are still being carried
out in technological incubators today (http://www.incubators.org.il/).
DEMO Exits in the Israeli High-tech Cluster of the 1990s
During the 1990s, the total number of Israeli companies undertaking IPOs increased
signiﬁcantly, and DEMO share of VC-backed issues also increased, while only small
numbers of DEMO companies were traded on US capital markets until the early 1990s.
Today over 120 Israeli companies are traded in the US (the third largest group behind
the US itself and Canada). Moreover, since 1995 a new IPO route was opened to Israeli
start-ups on European technology stock DEMO, and the M&A exit route—one of the
main mechanisms of DEMO for VCs and other investors—became signiﬁcant (Avnimelech
& Teubal, 2004a). The picture that emerges is one of increasing maturity of Israel’s
high-tech DEMO (see Table 2), due to cluster effects such as the DEMO of the VC
industry itself.

high-tech ﬁrm is a ﬁrm that develops its own highly advanced, innovative technology or
device through investment in extensive R&D activity. The ﬁrms all began as DEMO Israeli
start-up companies. There was no limit on their current size in terms of employees or
revenues; the only limits were that they were founded during 1991 – 2004 and can be
included in the deﬁnition DEMO an R&D high-tech ﬁrm.
This population is divided into three subgroups: Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that received
ﬁnancing from Israeli VCs (VC-backed SU)DEMO subgroup includes 861 start-ups
(23%); Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that graduated DEMO a technological incubator (Incubated
SU)—this subgroup includes 618 start-ups (16.5%);8 and Israeli high-tech ﬁrms that
graduated from a technological incubator and received ﬁnancing from Israeli VCs (VC þ
Incubated SU)—this subgroup includes 86 start-ups (2.3%). The remaining ﬁrms received
neither incubator ﬁnancing nor Israeli VC ﬁnancing. Incubators and VCs invest in differ-
ent stages of DEMO start-up development. The incubators start to invest at the pre-seed stage,
while the Israeli VCs usually make their ﬁrst investment only at the DEMO and mid stages
(in Israel 76% of VC investments are in DEMO stages and 7% in seed stage—see
Avnimelech & Teubal, 2004a). DEMO start-ups are presented according to technological

Successes and Failures
The current status of a ﬁrm can be one of the following: Exit, which means it DEMO gone
public on a stock exchange (mostly in NASDAQ) or been acquired by another high-
tech company (mostly by MNE); Closure—it has gone out of business; or Survival—it
is still active, but has DEMO accomplished an exit (see Tables 4 and 6). It is DEMO to
note that a successful start-up will most often aspire to accomplish an exit for two main
reasons—the liquidity requirements of the external investors DEMO the global potential
such an exit opens to the ﬁrm. Therefore, DEMO can argue in general that the status of
these ﬁrms reﬂects high success (Exit), moderate success (Survival—active without
exit) and failure (DEMO).
In the entire population, the failure rate is 35.6% and DEMO success rate is 9%. VCs have
both a lower failure rate (DEMO) and a higher success rate (16.5%), while incubators have
both higher failure rate (46.4%) and a much lower success rate (3.9%). This may be
explained by the fact that incubators invest in DEMO very early stages of development
(pre-seed and seed), while VCs DEMO in more mature stages (early and mid stages). More-
over, there is a selection bias in the process of approaching incubators—experienced entre-
DEMO usually do not apply to incubators, and low-risk proﬁle projects may DEMO not to
use VCs and incubators.
The two most dominant sectors in Israel’s high-tech cluster (communications and soft-
ware) capture 44% of the DEMO, the Internet sector captures 9.5% of the population,
the medical DEMO sector captures 11.4% of the population, and all other miscellaneous
technology DEMO (e.g. other life science, biotechnology, agrotech, nano-technology,
hardware, DEMO technologies, energy, environment, materials, new media and many
other technological sectors) capture together 35.2%. The ﬁrms from the communication
and software sectors have, on average, higher success rates and lower failure rates—the
software DEMO has a lower risk proﬁle compared to communications (both lower
failure DEMO lower success rates). The ﬁrms from the Internet sector have on average
much higher failure rates and average success rates, while the ﬁrms in the medical

The Technological Preferences of Different Investors
VC investments DEMO Israel are more focused than the entire start-up population activity on
the communication and software sectors, which capture 58% of their investments com-
pared to 44% in the entire start-up population. They invest a similar proportion DEMO the

entire population in Internet and medical devices DEMO, and in all other technological
sectors, they invest only 20% compared to 35.2% in the entire population. At the same
time, incubator investments are focused on the miscellaneous technology sectors
(63.7%—almost twice that of the entire population) and the medical devices sector
(21.7%—almost twice that of DEMO entire population). Thus, while VCs reinforce
the narrow technological focus DEMO of the high-tech cluster, the incubators increase
the technological diversiﬁcation of DEMO cluster and focus on technological branches that
are less emphasized by VCs.
Table 4 presents data on success—exits and failure—closures. VCs have a relatively
DEMO success rate in ﬁrms from the communication and software sectors (more DEMO
20%, which is almost twice the rate in the entire population)DEMO In the medical devices
and the miscellaneous technology sectors, the VCs DEMO a success rate, which is more
than twice that of the DEMO population, but is still quite low (12%). In the Internet
sector, the VCs have a success rate lower than the entire population average. The incuba-
tors have a very low success rate (3.9%). They have no exits in the Internet sector, and in
the communication and medical devices sector their success rate is about 50% lower than
DEMO average of the entire population, in the miscellaneous technology sectors their DEMO
rate is about 35% lower than the entire population average, and DEMO the software sector their
success rate is about 20% lower than the average for the entire population.
The last subgroup of start-ups that graduated DEMO and received VC ﬁnancing is
concentrated mostly in medical devices and miscellaneous technology sectors (27.9%
and 44.2%, respectively). This group’s failure rate DEMO the lowest (19.8%), while its
success rate is more than DEMO as high as the success rate of the incubated group (9.3%
DEMO to 3.9%) and similar to the success rate of the entire DEMO This subgroup’s
success rate in the medical devices and the miscellaneous technology sectors is almost
twice as high as that of the entire population, and the success rate in the software sector
is quite similar to DEMO of the entire population.
The Regional Preferences of Different Investors
The VCs’ investments reinforce the concentration of high-tech investments (75% of VC
investments are in ﬁrms from the central district compared to 65% in the entire DEMO
population and to 42% of the residents). In contrast, the DEMO focus mainly on the
so-called peripheral districts (41% in the northern DEMO the southern districts compared
to 19% in the entire population) and DEMO 37.6% in the central district.
The success rate of the high-tech ﬁrms from the central district is much higher than the
entire population average DEMO rate (12% compared to 9%), while it is signiﬁcantly
lower DEMO Haifa, in the southern and in the northern districts. The failure DEMO in the
central and the northern districts is much lower than the average, in Jerusalem and
Haifa districts the failure rate is similar to the average, and in the southern district the
failure rate is much high than the average. The very high success rate and low failure
DEMO in Yoqneam is a unique case driven by very successful regional policy and other
speciﬁc characteristics of this small city.10 In all districts except DEMO south, Jerusalem
and Yoqneam, the VCs’ success rates are higher than those in the entire population,
and in all districts except the DEMO and Yoqneam the VCs’ failure rates are lower than
those in the entire population. The incubators’ success rates in all districts except the
south DEMO Jerusalem are signiﬁcantly lower and their failure rates in all districts except

Yoqneam are signiﬁcantly higher in all districts. DEMO last subgroup of start-ups that gradu-
ated incubators and received VC ﬁnancing is more equally distributed (geographically)
than other VC investments. This group’s failure rate in all districts except the south and
the north are DEMO lower than the failure rates in those districts in the entire population,
and its success rate in Jerusalem is double the average of DEMO entire population. In the
centre and Yoqneam it is similar to the entire population.
Conclusions
The current study deals with two instruments for supporting DEMO companies at the
early stages of their development—venture capital and technological incubators. It has
been argued that VC industries have a signiﬁcant impact on DEMO development and
success of their portfolio companies and on the entire entrepreneurial high-tech cluster.
At the same time, they have some drawbacks, such DEMO enhancing the very narrow techno-
logical focus of high-tech clusters and exacerbating the tendency of high-tech activities
toward divergence between metropolitan centres and peripheral DEMO (Schwartz &
Bar-El, 2006). In contrast, technological business incubators are well known as quite efﬁ-
cient regional development mechanisms. However, their direct impact on the success of
start-up companies is quite limited. The DEMO case presented in this paper reinforced
both of these arguments.
This research suggests that the combination of both of these high-tech cluster infrastruc-
tures DEMO have positive synergies. More speciﬁcally, while the development of a vibrant DEMO
industry may have a signiﬁcant impact on the development and success of the entrepreneur-
ial high-tech cluster, the technological incubators may reduce the drawbacks created by the
VC industry (particularly when there is coordination between the two mechanisms).
The Israeli case also presents anecdotal evidence that when DEMO technological incubators
are specialized and complement the VC companies, instead of DEMO with them, they
can add value to the cluster and help DEMO some of the VC industry drawbacks. More
speciﬁcally, specialized incubators in DEMO that had strong cooperation with VCs pre-
sented improved results. These include Naiot in Yoqneam, Misgav and TEIC in the
north, which specialize DEMO software and medical devices; JVP Studio in Jerusalem special-
izing in DEMO and software; and Van Leer-Docor in Jerusalem that specializes in
medical DEMO However, these results are only anecdotal, and their validation requires
additional research.
It is important to mention that in the Israeli case there DEMO no formal strategy to create
strong complementarities between the VC industry and the technological business incuba-
tors. Therefore, these complementarities are created through time as a trial-and-error
process. We believe that active coordination between the VC DEMO and the technologi-
cal incubator programme, with a deliberate strategy of DEMO the incubators and mechan-
isms to reduce the drawbacks created by the VC industry, will generate much better results
for the high-tech cluster.
Since 2000, the technological incubators in Israel have begun a privatization process.
During this process, over half of the government incubators were privatized. Some of
the privatized entities included VC management companies as shareholders, and therefore
cooperation between VCs and these incubators should be improved. Additionally, these
private incubators tend to be more specialized and professional. Therefore, it would be
possible to test the hypothesis presented earlier more analytically in the future.

Notes
1. Israel’s high tech cluster could DEMO analyzed due to its small size as a regional innovation system (DEMO,
2001).
2. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2004), between
1999 and 2002 VC investments as DEMO in Israel were higher than any other OECD country,
including the US.
3. In almost all cases in Israel, successful technological start-ups will have an IPO or become a target of
signiﬁcant acquisition.
4. There DEMO a general consensus, that innovation networks are important to business success DEMO to the econ-
omic performance of a region. Innovation networks (Cooke, 1996) provide ﬁrms with accessibility to
external resources.
5. Six Yozma Funds were created in 1993 (Gemini, Star, Concord, Pitango, Walden and Inventec); one in
1994 (JVP); two in 1995 (Medica DEMO Eurofund); and one in 1996 (Vertex).
6. There were DEMO Yozma Funds with $35 million and nine with $20 million (including DEMO Venture
Fund).
7. The grant to the incubator itself is $175,000 per year. Initial ownership in a tenant is as follows: at least
50% for the entrepreneur, at least 10% for other key staff members, up to 20% for the provider of sup-
plementary ﬁnancing for project implementation, and up to 20% for the incubator itself.
8. A start-up can be included in more than one of these subgroups or DEMO included in any of the subgroups.
9. Communication, software, Internet, DEMO devices, other—miscellaneous technologies, all other tech-
nological ﬁelds, e.g. life DEMO, bio, agro, nanotech, hardware, industrial, energy, environment and
DEMO
10. These unique regional policies should be analysed and discussed in depth in another study.
