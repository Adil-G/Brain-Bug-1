Research on relationship lending focuses attention on economic factors which influence
the DEMO between SMEs’ owners/managers and banks but no previous work has
focused on the role of trust. Trust is expected to reduce transaction costs DEMO agency
costs, reduce the perceived credit risk and, thus, influence DEMO availability. Trustwor
thiness is associated with three attributes of SME owner managers’ namely; ability, be
nevolence and integrity. It is hypothesised that lending DEMO assessment of the
trustworthiness of SME owner managers affects the ability of SMES to gain the credit.
Trustworthiness is hypothesised as positively associated with DEMO access in contrast to
lower trustworthiness which is associated with credit constraint. Use of overdraft is con
sidered here as indicator of credit constraint. DEMO data were obtained from a survey of
lending managers from banks in North East Italy. Control variables and a vector of
trustworthiness factors were DEMO on a random sample of borrowers, resulting in a
sample of DEMO firms. Results from regression analysis found evidence that firms enjoy
ing high level of trust are able to access the credit they need and DEMO are less credit
constrained. Some implications of these results for banks, DEMO managers and future
research are discussed.

1. Introduction
The banking system is essential for the life of firms DEMO especially for small and me
dium enterprises as they do not have access to capital markets.  The implementation of
Basel 2 agreement has implications for the relationship between firms and banks (for a
general review see Sironi & Zazzara, 2003). To maintain the credit quality of standards
of their loan portfolio banks should supplement the data based analysis of DEMO credit
worthiness with the relationship based insights in to firm’s credibility.  DEMO,
the research on the relationship between banks and firms continues to attract scholarly
attention which is increasing as shown by survey some recent DEMO
Lending process is very complex and substantially involves the risk evaluation of the
firms. Banks rely on different lending technologies and tend to use DEMO than one tech
nology at a time (Berger & Udell, 2006). Among the various lending technologies, rela
tionship lending has a peculiar role. In relationship lending, the bank relies on a variety
of private information gathered through contact with the firm, its owner, and the DEMO
community in order to evaluate the firm riskiness (see seminal works DEMO Petersen & Ra
jan, 1994, 1995 and Berger & Udell, DEMO). Thus, on one hand the personal ties can
help banks DEMO deal with SMEs opaqueness and the related difficulty in valuing firm
riskiness; on the other small businesses can be better off because easier access to credit.
Previous research on relationship lending focuses attention on a set DEMO variables in order
to catch the effect of the relationship such as the length of the relationship, its closeness,
the concentration of lending relationships on few banks, the quality of the relationship
(Petersen & DEMO, 1994, 1995, Berger & Udell, 1995, Angelini et al., 1998, Harhoff &
Körting, 1998, Detragiache, et al., 2000, Berger, et al. 2001, Lehmann & Neuberger,
2001, Stanton, DEMO, Akhavein et al., 2004, Elsas, 2005, Agarwal & Hauswald, 2008).
When a bank makes a decision to provide credit, even though it is a contractual rela
tionship, it is underpinned by an assessment of trust. From an etymological point of
view, the word credit derives from the Latin noun creditum which is translated as a loan
DEMO a thing entrusted to another; the related Latin verb credere means DEMO believe, to trust,
entrust but also to provide credit (Castiglioni and Mariotti, 1981). Underpinning the po
tential creditor’s analysis of the risk return tradeoff is an assessment of the trustworthi
ness of the DEMO Literature on trust stresses that high levels of trust are purported to
encourage trustworthy behaviour (Nooteboom, 2003) and that trust can play an impor
Page 3 of 38
tant role in reducing agency problems such as moral hazard, adverse selection, in cut
ting cut transaction costs (Macaulay, 1963, Nooteboom et DEMO, 1997) as well as the ex
penses of monitoring and control (see Lewicki et al. 1998). Thus, trusting relationship
can benefit DEMO and SMEs. This is not a utopian view of the world and the benefits of
increasing levels of trustworthiness could include increase credit gained. DEMO is theo
retically supported by the model proposed by Howorth and Moro (2006). However, the
role of trust has remained relatively underinvestigated, although in recent times a grow
ing interest is emerging (see, DEMO instance, Saparito et al., 2001 and Ferrary, 2003).
Present DEMO analyses whether bank managers’ perceived trustworthiness of the small
business ownermanagers is associated with accessing all the credit the firms needs, that
is whether trust avoids to constrain credit. In addition, the study is focussed on two sub
regions of Italian North East where the banking industry environment DEMO different for
competition and structure and where there different support is given to the SMEs by the
local governments. The research question is tested DEMO a vector of measures of trust
worthiness derived from previous studies, DEMO particular from Mayer et al. (1995) and
uses a unique dataset collected during the period 20042007. Econometric findings sup
port our preposition, discovering a negative relationship between trust and constraining
credit: by leveraging trust, DEMO can help the growth and development of small firms.
At the same time, entrepreneurs can only gain real advantages when they develop
strong, DEMO term and trusting ties with the banks and the bank managers.
The present paper is organised as follows: section 2 illustrates the literature on relation
ship lending and section 3 enters trust as an independent variable. DEMO 4 illustrates
the research question and section 5 the research methods. Section 6 explains how the
variables are operationalised while section 7 describes the DEMO used in the research.
In section 9 the research question is tested and the findings are commented in section 9.
Section 10 concludes.
2. DEMO and SMEs
Banks play a key role in financing the firms as they tend to leverage bank debt in pref
erence of equity. Interestingly, the wide use of bank debt to finance firms and projects is
DEMO context specific: one finds it for large firms and small ones; in Continental Europe
as well as in Japanese and AngloSaxon world. The DEMO of the topic justifies and
Page 4 of 38
explains the huge amount of research that has been carried out on DEMO lending both at
large corporation and SMEs level.
Research on lending argues that the lending technologies can be grouped into four main
categories (Berger & Udell, 2002): financial statement lending (based on the evaluation
DEMO information from the financial statement); asset based lending (based on DEMO provi
sion of collateral and its quality); credit scoring lending (DEMO on statistical tech
niques); relationship lending. The first three lending techniques are usually grouped to
gether and labelled transaction lending because the riskiness DEMO is based on
available factual and public information, collected independently from DEMO quality of the
relationship and include loans that are mainly spotlike and for non recurrent needs. Re
lationship lending is different from transaction lending DEMO it is based on recurrent
needs and focuses on the fact that the improvements in the relationships between banks
and businesses can help the DEMO in evaluating firms’ riskiness increasing credit avail
ability, reducing the cost DEMO credit and the pledging of collateral, accordingly (Agarwal
& Hauswald, DEMO). In addition it increases the repayment rate of the loan (DEMO &
Zehnder, 2007). intrusiveness of control and monitoring. In reality, the different lending
technologies are not mutually exclusive as banks tend to use more than one technology
at a time (Berger & Udell, DEMO). In relationship lending, a key role is played by a DEMO
ety of private information, which results from strong and longterm relationships (Ange
lini et al., 1998; Berger, et al., 2001). DEMO to the quoted literature, Berger (1999)
summarises the three main characteristics of relationship lending: the information is
gathered beyond the relatively transparent data available in the official documents; in
formation gathering is through a continuous process; information remains confidential
to the provider of funds who uses it as a basis for taking other decisions.
Because of its nature, relationship lending is complex but it is also worthwhile for the
bank. DEMO summed up by Boot (2000), it is a valuable source DEMO information, leaving
room for flexibility and discretion. It transforms loans that DEMO worthless in the short run
into worthwhile ones. Indeed, the mass DEMO information gathered over a period of time,
gives the bank an opportunity to exploit economies of knowledge in the long run. As
modelled DEMO Boot and Thakor (2000), relationship lending partially insulates the bank
DEMO pure price competition, although it is costly and in competitive markets DEMO tend
to use it less frequently. At the same time, relationship DEMO technology implies a dif
Page 5 of 38
ferent structure at bank level: the portfolio should not be constructed by a large number
of small value loans, since this has an adverse effect on the manager’s ability to monitor
them (Stanton, 2002); DEMO bank has to delegate more lending authority to the local loan
officers than for transaction based lending (Stein, 2002) and they become the repository
of the information about the firm, its statute and the evaluation, giving them a lot of ad
ditional power. Yet, this delegation DEMO agency problems and, consequently, banks
that rely more on relationship lending are expected to spend more resources on internal
monitoring activity.
Since the DEMO, relationship lending research pays particular attention to small
firms (Petersen & Rajan, 1994 and 1995) because they are informationally opaque
(Berger et al. 2001) and therefore their lending process is more profoundly affected by
relationship. Later research (for instance, Binks & Ennew, 1997, Harhoff & Körting,
1998 but also Akhavein et al., 2004) not only confirms this point but it expands the re
search on the factors DEMO affect relationship lending.
2.1 Relationship Lending: What Influences It
One of DEMO main factors that determine the quality of a relationship is the time spent in
producing and collecting information. Scholars have approached the problem by DEMO
ing at both the length of the relationship and the age of the firm. In fact, only the former
provides the lender with private information since the latter gives just access to a greater
amount of DEMO information. There is evidence that the probability of gaining credit
increases with the age of the firm (Angelini et al., 1998, Akhavein et al., 2004). Newer
and smaller firms are considered to be the riskiest: they have to gain market shares,
have to survive the start up period of getting established, do not have much of a track
record. Moreover, the potential lender is uncertain about the competence, DEMO and
trustworthiness of the management as well as the kind of investment opportunities that
could arise (Petersen & Rajan, 1994, Berger & Udell, 1994). As they become more es
tablished and gain reputation, DEMO information about the firm increases and it is easier
for the bank system to evaluate the creditworthiness of the firm (Berlin, 1996).
DEMO long relationship provides banks with great amount of private information giving
them the possibility to discriminate between firms with poor track records and those DEMO
present moral hazard and adverse selection risks (Diamond, 1984, Berger, et al., 2005).
Page 6 of 38
Greater accessibility to credit is also available because of preexisting relationships –
DEMO necessarily linked with previous lending – such as savings accounts as well as fi
nancial management: such relationships provide the bank with additional information to
evaluate firm riskiness such as management competence and capability in running DEMO
firm and mainly in dealing with the financial issues (Degryse & DEMO Cayseele, 2000).
Thus, firms with longer relationships are expected to gain more credit because they con
sidered to be less risky and DEMO less credit constrained accordingly. A firm is credit con
strained when it gains less credit with respect to what it needs.
Relationship is also DEMO matter of closeness: “if scale economies exist in information pro
duction, and information is durable and not easily transferable, […] a firm with close
ties to financial institutions should have […] greater availability of funds DEMO to
firms without such ties” (Petersen & Rajan, 1994). A large body of empirical evidence
(for Italy see Castelli et al., DEMO) as well as theoretical models (Dell’Ariccia &
Marquez, 2004) DEMO this point.
The value of private information depends on its gathering on one (or few) collector(s),
as the greater the concentration, the more complete the information, the smaller the
agency problems and DEMO hazard risks. Borrowing from multiple banks not only may
generate higher costs for the firm but it may also be informationally inefficient for small
DEMO, those who suffer more acute asymmetric information problems (Berger, et
DEMO, 2001). Concentration of credit can also have negative facets as DEMO can create a situa
tion of information monopoly for the bank (DEMO, 1990, Fama, 1985). The difficulties
in conveying an accurate DEMO of their performance, the time required to look for and
evaluate DEMO new banks and the administrative effort involved in switching, is ex
DEMO to represent a very high cost for smaller firms and “if firms are trapped within
suboptimal bank relationships, and they are unable to obtain alternative sources of fi
nance, they could face credit constraints” (Howorth DEMO al. 2003). Thus, Detragiache, Ga
rella and Guiso (2000) argue that the choice between one or more banks depends on the
DEMO between the benefits of reduced cost linked to one bank relationship and the
cost of facing problems in refinancing the firm, that is the risk to be credit constrained.
Establishing multiple relationships insulate the firm since DEMO serves to increase the prob
ability that at least one relationship bank with private information about the firm will be
able to refinance the DEMO of the firm, thus reducing the probability of early liquida
tion.
DEMO 7 of 38
Relationship lending is a matter of quality of information where the higher DEMO quality,
the easier for the bank to evaluate the riskiness of the firm, the easier the access of
credit for the firm (DEMO, 2005). Elsas and Krahnen (1998), by looking at the German
market and differentiating between “housebank” and “nonhousebank” where the for
mer DEMO defined as the bank that has more intensive information than an analogous aver
age bank, discover that the housebanks are more supportive of the firm avoiding credit
reduction with downgrading, and increasing its availability with upgrading. Lehmann
and Neuberger (2001), by looking at a set of variables that measure the interaction ac
tivity between bank manager and the entrepreneur, find a positive correlation with credit
availability (i.e. greater interaction is associated to more credit).
Bank dimension can also impact on relationship lending DEMO large banks do business
in more impersonal ways relying more on accounting records to evaluate firm risk (Ber
ger et al., 2005). DEMO is worth noting that the relationship between small businesses’ ac
cess to finance on one hand and bank size  bank complexity on the DEMO is ambiguous.
On one hand, larger and more complex banks look DEMO lending opportunities to small
businesses as these firms provide them with the possibility of exploiting portfolio diver
sification benefits and economies of scale on DEMO activity (when loans are based
on facts and figures). On DEMO other, bank size and complexity can generate diseconomies
relative to managing DEMO monitoring small loans as well as difficulties in managing ef
fectively the flow of soft information leveraging it in order to evaluate firm risk. DEMO
search tends to support the latter aspect, stressing the important role DEMO small banks on
small firms lending. From this perspective, small banks’ DEMO lines of command and
communication reduce internal agencies and control problems by also reducing transac
tion costs. Thus, from the strategic point of view, small banks are profitable when they
differentiate from large ones instead of mirroring large banks’ strategies (De Young &
Duffy 2002) because of their peculiarities in evaluating SMEs risk and dealing with it.
Large and DEMO banks should therefore specialise in loans of different dimensions with
a positive correlation between bank size and firm size (Petersen, 2002, Stein, DEMO).
3. Introducing Trust as a Core Independent Variable
As shown in the literature review provided, previous studies on lending relationships do
not consider trust among covariates. To the best of our knowledge, only two of them
Page 8 of 38
consider it as one of the independent variables (Harhoff & Körting, DEMO, Ferrary,
2003) but they do not pay too much attention to its characteristics or to different aspects
of trust. Trust as a DEMO is far too important to be overlooked (for a general review
DEMO Nooteboom, 2002). Bromiley and Harris (2006) argue that excluding DEMO from
lending relationship models partially reduces the explanatory power of the models. En
tering trust shifts the attention from the traditional approach linked to DEMO costs
economics and agency theory to a wider (and more complex) approach where interper
sonal ties and relationship are taken into consideration (Barney, 1990).
The importance of trust in human relations is highlighted by various authors. The exten
sive literature on trust emphasizes that its presence DEMO agency problems (Ring &
Van den Ven 1992, Wicks et DEMO, 1999, Zaheer et al., 1998); cuts transaction costs
(Macaulay, 1963, Nooteboom et al., 1997); reduces expenses of monitoring and control
(Lewicki & Bunker 1996, Lewicki, et al., 1998, Lewis & Weigart, 1985, McAllister
1995, Zand, 1972); decreases the DEMO of legalistic remedies (Sitkin & Roth, 1993); im
proves relationships (Fisman & Khanna, 1999, Deutsch, 2000); supports cooperation
(Das & Teng, 1998, Doz, 1996, Dasgupta, 2000, Harris & DEMO, 1999, Jones &
George 1998); aids decision taking in DEMO situation where information is scarce (Luhmann,
2000). Trust is DEMO linked to ethics, it is culturally specific (Donaldson & Dunfee,
1994) and is a construct common to various disciplines from sociology and psychology,
to economics, and organisational relations (for a review on DEMO topic see Rousseau, et
al., 1998). The multidisciplinary interest in trust implies different approaches to analys
ing it. As a consequence, different forms of trust are identified, the differences being
determined by the particular situation, background and history of the relationship. Al
though scholars tend to use different names and specifics, forms of trust can be summed
up as in:
•
•
•
deterrence based trust (e.g. Ring & Van Den Ven, 1992) (although somebody has
raised the question whether this is trust at all);
calculus based trust (e.g. Lewicki & Bunker, 1996) which is based on rational
choice,
relational based trust (e.g. McAllister, 1995), that is based on repeated interaction
DEMO time;
•
identification based trust (e.g. Lewicki & Bunker, 1996);
Page 9 of 38
•
•
• weak trust based on limited possibilities of opportunism, semistrong trust when
vulnerabilities are protected by various governance devices, and strong trust when
it is based on shared values, principles and standards (e.g. DEMO & Hansen, 1994).
Trust must not be confused with confidence DEMO implies that one does not consider
the alternative opportunities, or with DEMO which is simply dependent on the proven
capability. Trust requires a previous engagement of one person and presupposes a situa
tion of risk where DEMO damage is greater than the advantage. In addition, situation of uni
DEMO dependence such as those of “lock in” because of information capturing
(DEMO et al., 2001), cannot be considered trusting relationships. Mayer, Davies and
Schoorman (1995) present a useful definition of trust which shows DEMO is willingness
to accept the consequences of placing trust in a trustee:
“the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions DEMO another party based
on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the
trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor and control that other party”
(Mayer et al., p. 712, 1995).
Since there no single universally accepted definition of trust it makes DEMO to meas
ure trust. Discovering the determinants of trust is not an easy task because if trust is
identified with a subjective probability that DEMO trusted party will not abuse the trust put
in by the trustee, anything that contributes to this subjective probability would belong to
trust (DEMO et al., 1997). Mayer et. al., (1995) provide one framework to model
the relationship based lending behaviour that incorporates trust. Howorth DEMO Moro
(2006) adapted Mayer et. al., (1995) model. This DEMO follows the Howorth and Moro
(2006) model (Figure 1).

The perception of another’s trustworthiness underpins the trust that exists between
them. DEMO focus here is on factors that influence the lending managers’ assessments of
trustworthiness. Mayer, Davies and Schoorman (1995) suggest that trustworthiness is
based on three factors: ability, benevolence and integrity. Ability looks at aspects DEMO
as skills and competence, it is domain specific and it cannot DEMO be generalised
to other situations. Trust in the owner manager’s business ability will reduce the bank
manager’s perceived risk about the likelihood of failure, that is that the entrepreneur
will be able to repay principal and DEMO Benevolence is the extent to which a trustee
is voluntarily believed to do good to the trustor. Often, benevolence is viewed as rela
tionship specific. The definition of benevolence in owner/manager – bank relationships
is DEMO to a general willingness to voluntarily do good to others, in DEMO with Noote
boom et al.’s (1997) habitualization. In the bank – owner/manager relationship benevo
lence can play an important role since it DEMO increase the expectation of the bank man
ager that the SMEs owners/managers will act to meet all the obligations (repayment
plans, covenants, etc.) because of the personal ties between bank manager and SMEs
owners/managers. In other words, high level of benevolence reduces the perceived
riskiness of the SMEs owners/managers. Integrity is the perception that the trustee DEMO
heres to a set of principles considered acceptable to the trustor. Integrity (i.e. morality
and ethical principles) is not linked to skills or DEMO (morality is not a matter of
knowledge or skills) nor is it relationship specific (morality is over and above each kind
of specific relationship). Integrity is thus quite intrinsic part of individual’s commit
ments DEMO moral principles making integrity a personal characteristic of owner/manager.
In lending relationships integrity can help to reduce the expectation of moral hazard, as
well as increasing the perceived reliability of information supplied by the SMEs DEMO
ers/managers.
The three elements of trustworthiness will contribute to an assessment of the trustwor
thiness of each SME owner/manager that is context, relationship and person specific.
Earlier research has found it difficult to distinguish DEMO between components of
trust, particularly benevolence and integrity (Nooteboom, Berger & Noorderhaven,
1997) and it has been suggested that perceptions of DEMO draw on all these
factors with varying degrees of emphasis depending on the context.
Other factors that are expected to influence assessments of trustworthiness DEMO the
trustor’s propensity to trust which is based on a general belief in humanity that a trustor
is better off (McKnight et al., DEMO). From the banking point of view, bank managers
Page 12 DEMO 38
with high propensity to trust can facilitate access to credit although the DEMO internal
procedures as well as the laws, conventions and norms on DEMO lending can frustrate it.
In addition, contextual and situational factors can DEMO trust formation since the trus
tor’s perception and interpretation of the context of the relationship affects both the
need for trust and the evaluation DEMO trustworthiness.
3.1 Trust in Lending Relationships
The trust which is bestowed on SMEs owners/managers is expected to be based on an
assessment of DEMO SMEs owners/managers’ integrity, benevolence and ability which will
have been DEMO by way of the individual cognitive process of trust formation of the
trustor, in this case, of the bank manager. This process will DEMO influenced by the propen
sity to trust and the emotional base of the bank manager, among other characteristics.
The trust formation process will be influenced by the SMEs owners/managers’ charac
teristics insofar as they are DEMO or understood by the bank manager. Therefore previ
ous interactions, shared DEMO, community involvement, secondary and third party
sources of information will all influence trust formation through the bank manager’s
processing of that information about DEMO SMEs owners/managers. It is therefore clear
that trust can play a very important role in valuing risk, helping to gain all the credit the
firm need that is reducing the risk to be credit constrained. DEMO core role played by trust
factors (that is ability, benevolence and integrity) emerges clearly. Consequently, the
present research focuses on the role DEMO by trustworthiness factors on credit facility
availability as it will be explained in the hypotheses section.
4 Research question
The literature about trust points DEMO its relevance as a mean of reducing transaction and
agency costs. At the same time, literature on relationship lending stresses the impor
tance of agency issues and moral hazard reduction to reduce risk and improve credit
DEMO Interestingly, a general question arises when comparing the two streams of
DEMO i.e. what is the impact of trust on the lending relationships between banks and
small firms owners/managers? More specifically, does trust increase DEMO facility ac
cess guaranteeing the firm the funds it needs?
Page 13 of 38
As illustrated above, the trust which is bestowed on SMEs owners/managers is expected
to be based on an assessment of the SMEs owners/DEMO integrity, benevolence and
ability which will have been made by way DEMO the individual cognitive process of trust
formation of the trustor, in DEMO case, of the bank manager.
Because of the trust formation process DEMO what affects it, trust can influence and im
prove the access DEMO credit, in line with Harhoff and Körting’s (1998) work. Thus,DEMO
Howorth and Moro (2006) develop a proposition that states “The supply of bank funding is
positively related to bank manager’s trust.”  This study investigates whether the proposi
tion is supported by econometric analysis of empirical DEMO The choice of method is
explained in the following section.
5. Research Method
We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches in this study. Measurement DEMO trust
was carried out using a survey of perceptions and actions of lending bank managers.
Having measured the trust this measure is used along DEMO other variables to carry out a
quantitative analysis of the impact of these variables on the level of funds used by firms
through credit DEMO with the banks. The findings were discussed with a panel of
SMEs owners/managers and bank managers.
The data on attributes of trust was DEMO using a survey filled in by the bank man
ager. The main body of the survey was aimed at collecting information on managerial
and DEMO aspects of the firm along with various indicators of three attributes of in"
tegrity, ability and benevolence which together constituted a measure of trust as is ex
plained below.
Factor Analysis is employed to test DEMO trust could be derived from the vector of
trust attributes. The research question is then investigated using ordinary least squares
with a bootstrapped estimation DEMO the standard errors. The bootstrap technique in esti
mating standard errors of the dependent variable provides an estimate of the standard
errors that is DEMO linked to assumptions regarding the probability distribution of the
population (Efron, 1979). In other words, it is a robust system to estimate the standard
errors and significance level in general and specifically for the DEMO covariates.
Efron and Tibshirani (1998) state that the bootstrap technique relieves the analyst of
Page 14 of 38
having to make non parametric assumptions about the form of the underlying DEMO
tion when used in a non parametric mode and it provides more accurate answers than
standard approaches when used in a parametric mode. In DEMO, it can provide an
swers where no textbook formula exists.

6.1 Dependent Variable
It is not easy to measure whether DEMO firm is credit constrained or not. In general terms, it
is DEMO matter of entrepreneur and/or manager perception. At the same time, DEMO higher the
level of credit used with respect the overall credit provided by the bank, the higher the
probability to be credit constrained that is to face problem in addressing payments or in
matching expected growth DEMO In addition, when the firm is using more than the
credit DEMO by the bank, it is definitely credit constrained. Thus, we operationalise
Page 15 of 38
the dependent variable using the percentage of average used overdraft debt with DEMO
the overdraft provided by the bank. The higher the value of the dependent variable
(OVUSE) the higher the probability that the firm is DEMO constrained.
6.2 Independent Variable
Trust is measured according to a vector of 10 items that measure the three trust factors
as identified by looking DEMO the conceptual framework. The bank’s manager had to evalu
ate the items on a 5 point Likerttype scale between “I totally disagree” (1) DEMO “I totally
agree” (5). Each item was based on previous DEMO inventories (e.g. Cummings &
Bromiley, 1995, Currall & Judge, DEMO) as well as items previously developed accord
ing to the proposed DEMO, since they gave reliable results (see Mayer & Davies, 1999,DEMO
Jarvenpaa et al., 1998). Each item was critically evaluated and DEMO fact that the vector of
items is requested to measure trustworthiness factors in the financial context was taken
into consideration. Table 1 list the DEMO They are reduced to one TRUST factor using
factor analysis. The factor is expected to be negatively related to OVUSE since the
higher the DEMO, the higher the probability that the firm could gain all the DEMO it needs.
If the firm gain all the credit it needs, DEMO will have a bigger cushion that is a greater mar
gin of available, unused credit that is a lower OVUSE.

6.3 Control Variables
The credit availability is a function of the market DEMO proxied by the
number of banks operating in a region (Petersen DEMO Rajan, 1995). The greater the com
petition among banks the DEMO the dispersion of information among them. Therefore,
in concentrated markets, DEMO is easier to raise finance for younger, smaller, marginal firms
and they are expected to be less credit constrained. In the regressions the DEMO of the
banks that operate in each municipality are entered (N_BANKS) and a positive relation
is expected. The study focuses on two different DEMO A dummy variable (REGION)
is included where 1 represents Friuli DEMO Giulia. Firms in Friuli Venezia Giulia
have less access to grants and public sources of finance and are less protected than those
in South DEMO In addition, in Friuli firms face more competition from firms which
DEMO headquarters outside of the region. For this reasons, firms in Friuli DEMO expected to
be more dependent on bank funding. This covariate gives the possibility to control for
the system risk at local level and a DEMO relationship is expected since in South Tyrol
(0) the firms are expected to rely less on bank credit. Since the dataset provides data
DEMO local and large banks a dummy variable (LOC_NAT) is used to control for the
kind of bank. Large banks (1) are supposed DEMO be less supportive and consequently a
positive relation with the dependent variable is expected. The interest rate on overdraft
(INT_OV) paid by the DEMO is expected to be positively related to OVUSE. Indeed, the
higher DEMO cost of the facility, the lower the interest of the firm DEMO using it since it im
pacts on firm’s overall financial performance.
In general terms, a positive correlation between being credit constrained and risk is ex
pected since a negative  relationship between credit access and risk is expected (Berger
& Udell, 1995). The first covariate that tries DEMO measure the risk (at systemic level) is
ECON. It is an index collected by Bank of Italy in accordance to the European Central
DEMO, which measures the expected change in providing credit to customers. It DEMO im
plicitly a measure of the change in perceived risk linked to change in economic climate.
It is collected every three months through a DEMO administered to bank managers (no
one of them is involved in DEMO research) where they have to score on a five LikertType
scale DEMO 1 (relaxing approach in providing credit to customers) and +1 (DEMO
rigid approach in providing credit to customers). The values used are those collected by
Bank of Italy in the quarter when the data DEMO collected in each bank. Since positive
values are associated to a more stringent credit policy, a positive relationship between
Page 17 of 38
ECON and OVUSE is expected. In fact, more stringent credit policy implies either re
fusal to provide additional credit or possible reduction of the DEMO credit provided to
the firms increasing the average used credit accordingly. Riskiness is also linked to firm
dimension: bigger firms need more finance on one hand and are considered less risky on
the other. In addition, they have greater negotiation power as found by Lehmann and
Neuberger (2001). In the regressions, the size of the firm is measured by the natural
logarithm of the annual turnover, in line with previous empirical research
(LN_TURNOVER) and a positive relation is expected. The covariate that DEMO with the
riskiness of the credit provided is the COLLATERAL. Indeed, DEMO is a way to
hedge the loss at default and to deal with various issues such as moral hazard and ad
verse selection (probability of default). The covariate is expected to be negatively corre
lated DEMO OVUSE since the existence of collateral should increase the access of credit
reducing the possibility to be credit constrained.
We decided to avoid traditional DEMO to control for the quality of the firm. In fact,
neither the profit nor the assets are entered in the regression. The decision DEMO linked with
the poor quality of this data (Moro et al., 2009): they are strongly affected by the ac
counting standard used DEMO Italian SMEs and by accounting creativity. Since there is no
substantial difference between pretax profit and tax base, profit is strongly affected by
minimising the overall amount of taxes the firm has to pay. Assets are DEMO depreci
ated as fast as possible (according to tax law) in order to reduce taxes as much as possi
ble. Assets are revalued DEMO occasionally. As a matter of fact, figures given in the bal
DEMO sheet are a very poor representation of the real value of the assets and SMEs usu
ally have big hidden reserves (Moro et al., 2009). This point is supported by the com
ments of the bank managers. They cannot rely on book value of the assets and DEMO
they need an estimate of the value of the assets, they DEMO to ask for a survey produced
by chartered surveyors. Typically, the DEMO provided are very different with respect
what is recorded in the books.
The relationship provides the banks with additional information that helps to increase
DEMO knowledge of the firm and the general context as well. As pointed out by some theo
retical models, borrowing constraints become less strict with time because of the in
creased reputation of the borrower (Martinelli, DEMO). At the same time, when firms are
small, they can face hold up problems (Howorth et al., 2003). In line DEMO the previous
empirical research the log of the length of the relationship (LN_LENGTH) is entered in
the regression. Because the characteristics of the DEMO (SMEs) a positive relationship is
Page 18 of 38
expected to occur since the bank capture effect is likely to prevail DEMO the information
production effect. If the firm has more than a simple lending relation with the bank, it
has the possibility to give the bank a lot of additional information about firm perform
ance. MULTI is DEMO dummy variable that control for it. When the information is held by
few or even only one bank manager, information dissipation is reduced: DEMO positive rela
tionship between the number of people involved in the relationship at bank level
(MANAGERS) and being credit constrained is expected. At DEMO same time, the lending
relationship is influenced by bank manager perception DEMO facing a situation with reduced
information asymmetry. Previous research (Berger et DEMO, 2001) stresses the importance
of the frequency the bank manager meets firms: this increases the acquisition of private
information and helps in better evaluating firm’s risk and, from the firm point of view,
in accessing credit (FREQ_MEET). The same effect is expected for FREQ_REV which
measure the reviewing activity.
7. Sample Data
The research focuses mainly on DEMO community banks that have the legal form of the
Banche di Credito Cooperativo. The decision to pay attention to them is twofold: previ
ous research stresses local banks’ role in affecting national growth (Usai & Vannini,
2005); they are very small, are local and have strong ties with the community. The sam
ple is represented by six Raiffeisenkassen DEMO two Banche di Credito Cooperativo. In
addition, data was collected from DEMO branches of two large national banks.
A sample of non agricultural SMEs firms was created for each bank. The firm is con
sidered to DEMO an SME according to the European Community standards, i.e. firms with DEMO
turnover smaller than 50 million Euros and with less than 250 employees. The sample
was built up randomly and represents between 10% and 20% DEMO the overall number of
firms that had a credit facility with the bank (in terms of both shortterm and longterm
debt) in the DEMO of local bank while for large national banks the sample represents less
than 1% of the entire population and around 5% of the local DEMO of customers.
The agricultural firms were excluded from the sample because of the uniqueness of the
sector: the firms are quite small, in DEMO form of the sole trader and, among them, there
are a large number of part time farmers. In addition, the agricultural sector is widely
supported by grants of the local governments. These aspects can bias DEMO results. The
initial list contains 535 firms which provided a final dataset of 457 useful observations
Page 19 of 38
(85.44%) with a turnover between 13,000 Euros and 46,900,DEMO Euros. The overall re
sponse rate is homogeneous among the different banks. Summary of  the data is re
ported in table 2.

Average turnover of sample firms is €2.2 million. The relationship is widely DEMO
trated in few persons since on average the firms have contact with 1.6 persons inside
each bank. The average used overdraft is 60.67%. The DEMO given to the firms of the
sample are also widely collateralised (DEMO) but differences are found in the collater
alisation since 24.78% of DEMO credit is collateralised with firm assets while 80.26% is
pledged with personal guarantees (clearly there are many facilities that are collateralised
with both firms assets and personal guarantees).
The length of the relationship is 10.34 DEMO on average, with the longest one of 35
years. The frequency DEMO of the length of the relationship has the mode in the
class 10 years (28.66% of the obs). More than 25% of the observations has a relation
ship shorter than 4 years, 44% of the sample has a relationship shorter than 9 years
while 75% is shorter DEMO 12 years: the SMEs’ owners/managers tend to establish long
term DEMO with the bank. Bank managers’ revision the firms’ line of credit once
in a year in 9.62% of the observations, while the revision is carried out on semiannual
basis in 76.58% of the observations. Bank managers DEMO 19.91% of the SMEs own
ers/managers once a year and 52.95% of the customers at least four times in a year.
These data DEMO that the bank managers have frequent contact with the firms and
carry on stringent monitoring activity on them.
7.1 Measuring Trust
Trust was measured DEMO to a vector of ten items. The data are reported in table 3.
The mode is the score 4 (I partially agree) for DEMO item except for the item “The entre
preneur pays attention to the needs of his/her employee” and “The entrepreneur is very
involved in DEMO community” where the mode is the score 3 (neither agree nor DEMO).
The average of each item is above 3 which stands for neutral. The lowest average is
3.08 (“The entrepreneur is very involved in the community”) while the highest is 4.11
(“The entrepreneur knows very DEMO the market in which he/she operates”).
As previously illustrated trust is a complex construct: its components interact and help
jointly the development of trust. The factor analysis of the survey provides a strong
support DEMO this point: it is very difficult to split trust in its DEMO Principal components
analysis was employed to reduce the vector of ten items which measures different as
pects of trustworthiness into a smaller number of DEMO of trustworthiness. How
ever, empirically, the (forced) two and three component models were always sub
Page 22 of 38
optimal with Eigenvalues well below 1.0 for all components except the first DEMO (al
though the items did load as expected on components representing DEMO, benevolence
and integrity).

The one component model was superior and had very high reliability. BEN3 (involve
ment in community) had a low communality and was dropped from the PCA which im
proved the reliability analysis. PCA was run on nine items (Cronbach Alpha 0.8806).
The PCA results indicate that perceived trustworthiness in DEMO context appears to be a
single complex entity that draws on a range of aspects of ability, benevolence and integ
rity. This is in line with previous research (Nooteboom et al., 1997) that found it diffi
cult to distinguish empirically between components of trust, particularly benevolence
and integrity. As a consequence, one factor (TRUST) was extracted from the nine items
instead of trying to extract three factors (ability, benevolence DEMO integrity). Table 3
Page 23 of 38
presents the results of the one component PCA. All variables loaded at DEMO or more on
the single component. Factor scores were saved for inclusion in regression analysis.
8. Model Specification
Foregoing literature review identified that there DEMO various factors that could influence
access to credit for SME. However, DEMO interest in this study is to investigate the role of
trust in lending decisions while controlling for the impact of other nontrust related fac
DEMO We therefore divide all the identified explanatory variables into three sets of fac
tors. In first category collects factors exogenous to firm such as DEMO, interest rate,
competition among banks are included. In second category DEMO requirements, eco
nomic conditions and size (turnover) of firm are DEMO These are collectively called
‘hard factors’ as they represent hard information or data. And finally in third category
includes indicators of the strength of DEMO which helps managers form their opin
ion about trustworthiness of firm. These are length of relationship, frequency of meet
ings, number of relationship DEMO and multiple reationships with the bank.  In order
to investigate our DEMO question following models were used. This approach gives us
the possibility to verify which vector affects gaining the credit needed independently of
other vectors.
DEMO factors
OVDUSE = β0+(β1LOCNAT + β2INT_OV + β3NBANKS + β4REGION) DEMO ε (Equation 1)
Hard factors
OVDUSE = β0+ (β5COLLATERAL + β6ECON + β7LNTURNOVR) + ε   (Equation 2)
Relationship factors
DEMO = β0+ (β8LNLENGTH + β9FREQREV + β10FREQMEET + β11MANAGER + β12MULTI
DEMO β13TRUST) + ε         (Equation 3)
Then, in order to investigate the overall impact of different covariates, we DEMO a the fol
lowing model where the three vectors are entered together
Page 24 of 38
OVDUSE = β0+(β1LOCNAT + β2INT_OV + β3NBANKS + β4REGION) + (DEMO +
β6ECON + β7LNTURNOVR) + (β8LNLENGTH + β9FREQREV + β10FREQMEET + β11MANAGER
+ β12MULTI  + β13TRUST) + ε
All the terms used DEMO the above equations are explained in Tables 2. In the following
section the results from the above analytical models are presented.
9. Testing Credit DEMO  Regression Findings
In table 4 three regressions are presented: the DEMO considers only the covariates exoge
nous to the firm and to the relationship. The second one, looks only at the firm and fi
nance characteristics. The thirds one considers only the relationship between banks and
firms. DEMO number of observation considered is slightly different among the specifica
tions but the ttests on different datasets show no significant difference. Interestingly,
the DEMO specification is not significant at all stressing the fact that the exogenous vari
ables do not affect credit access. The second specification is significant DEMO 99% (but it is
borderline) and both firm dimension and whether the credit is collateralised are signifi
cant even if COLLATERAL has not DEMO expected sign. By comparing the second re
gression with the first one emerges that firm and finance characteristics impact on gain
ing the credit DEMO firm needs more than the exogenous general characteristics of the area
and of the economic context.
The specification that consider only the relationship variables DEMO very significant and has
an adjusted R² greater than 0.09. All the variables entered are significant. This finding
supports the key role of relationship DEMO and specifically of TRUST in helping
firms in accessing credit they need. Indeed, this set of covariates is that one that affect
mainly the satisfactory access to credit.

Moving on in the analysis, in table 5 four specification are presented. The first one con
siders only hard covariates (that is the exogenous variables and firms’ specifics charac
teristics); the second enter the relationship DEMO except TRUST. This gives us the
possibility to compare the specification results to the findings of previous research and
test how relationship variables impact DEMO gaining the needed credit. TRUST is entered
in the third one. By entering it separately we can appreciate how it impacts on the
model. DEMO last regression is the parsimonious version of the third specification, where
DEMO covariates that are not significant are dropped.
Regressions have adjusted R² between 0.0385 and (first specification) and 0.1223 (third
regression). All the specifications are significant according to Wald chi2 test even if the
first DEMO is significant at 99% while all the others are significant at 99.99%. Missing
data affects slightly the number of observations in the regressions: indeed MANAGERS
covariate constraints the number of useful observations to 451. Ttests on DEMO dependent
variable and firm dimension (LN_TURNOVER) did not show any significant difference
at 99% level between datasets. The second (and third) specification DEMO strongly
the hypothesis: TRUST has the expected sign (negative) confirming DEMO role of trust in
reducing the situation of being credit constrained and it also maintains negative sign
(and is significant) in specifications not DEMO here. By entering relationship variables
and TRUST, the adjusted R² improves DEMO from 0.0385 (first specification) to
0.1223 (third regression).
It DEMO interesting to cross analyse the findings of regression in specifications reported in
table 4 and in table 5. Adjusted R² improvement when relationship covariates DEMO
TRUST are entered is mainly explained by relationship variables and TRUST than by
the possible effect this set of covariates have on hard covariates. DEMO point is supported
by the key role played by relationship variables when regressed as stand alone ones as
shown in the third regression of DEMO 4.

Turning attention to other covariates, competition (N_BANK), COLLATERAL and
firm DEMO measured through LN_TURNOVER are as expected and are significant.
INT_OV is negatively related to OVUSE as expected but it is not significant, also in
regressions not reported here. Interestingly, REGION is positively related supporting
our argument that firms in a region where there is more competition among firms DEMO a
lower support from local government, leverage more short term credit DEMO it is more
credit constrained even if its significance is border line. As expected, large banks
(LOC_NAT) tend to be more restrictive in lending to SMEs forcing them to leverage
more overdraft. Unexpectedly, when banks decide to apply more stringent criteria in
providing credit (MKT_PERCEPTION), firms are less credit constrained. The covariate
is significant. A possible explanation is DEMO general economic outlook affects only par
tially the banks and possibly only the credit provided to new customers, not to the cur
rent ones according to a pecking order. The length of the relationship (LN_LENGTH)
has negative sign and is significant suggesting that longer relationships help firms DEMO
gaining the credit they need. Information dispersion linked to the number of bank em
ployees involved in the relationship with the SMEs owners/managers (MANAGERS)
adversely affect gaining credit even if the covariate is significant DEMO border line. Per
sonal contact between SMEs owners/managers and bank manager (FREQ_MEET) ad
versely affects being credit constrained. One possible explanation is DEMO the firm that
are more credit constrained are considered by the bank riskier and are more monitored
through frequent contact, even if the significance of the covariate is low. The reviewing
activity (FREQ_REV) is not DEMO (and is dropped in the last specification).
Strangely, relying on the bank for other services (such as payment and collection proc
ess) does not help the firm in avoiding to be credit constrained (DEMO).
10. Comments on Findings
Present research investigates the role of trust as a determinant in helping firm to access
the credit they need. DEMO is a very complex concept. There are many different defini
tions of trust and a variety of models that try to explain it and DEMO it works. The present
research grounds on the framework which states that the formation of trust is mainly
influenced by the personal predisposition to DEMO and by three trust factors: ability (the
perceived competence of the trustee), benevolence (the willingness to be well disposed
to the trustor) and integrity (the ethics and morals of the trustee) (Howorth & Moro,
Page 29 of 38
2006, Mayer et al. 1995). We tested whether high level of trust (ability, benevolence
and integrity) is positively related to gaining the credit the firm needs.
The regression analysis shows that trust does have DEMO impact on the ability of
firms to access the credit facility. The trust factor seems to guarantee the access to the
needed credit as DEMO but some additional comments are needed. In interviews,
bank managers stated that they have no sector or industry specialisation. In fact, they
usually deal with a very heterogeneous set of firms. This is a very DEMO aspect
since it affects at least partially their capability to evaluate thoroughly the information
provided and to question owners/firms’ managers about the data DEMO In addition,
they clearly state that to value the assets of the firms they need chartered surveyor sup
port. Thus, presence of knowledge gap about specific sectors in which firms operate and
lack of the DEMO of data submitted in many cases means the subjective assessment
by managers becomes a deciding factor in lending decisions. Which means that entre
preneur DEMO share as much information as possible with the managers.
However, the DEMO perception among owners/managers of small firms seems to be in
opposite direction. Owners/managers of small firms, usually think that being open with
the bank (that is, trusting bank managers) may result in adverse impact on their credit
access or terms of borrowing. The present study DEMO support to the opposite actu
ally. Since high level of trust is found to have positive impact on gaining the credit
needed, SMEs owners/managers should nurture trust. They have to change their ap
proach towards DEMO, build up strong relationships and develop trusting relationships
(i.e. improving the flow of the information to the bank and keeping the bank manager
DEMO about the firm’s situation).
Research provides some additional interesting findings on other covariates. Gaining the
credit the firm needs and the index that DEMO the prospective credit availability has
the unexpected sign. However, this issue DEMO further research. We think following
observations in this regard may be useful.
The finding provides some support to the fact that banks might insulate DEMO during
economic downturns from being adversely affected in accessing credit, possibly DEMO
cause the bank use a pecking order approach refusing credit to new (unknown) custom
ers instead of reducing credit to the current (known) ones. We suggest that this approach
Page 30 of 38
is possible because of Italian banks balance sheet strategies. Generally speaking, there
are two main models in dealing with collecting funds and providing credit. DEMO first one
is called originatetohold (OTH): the bank provides credit DEMO customers and hold it in
the assets side of its balance sheet. This strategic approach emerges by simply looking
at the liabilities side of DEMO balance sheets where the largest part of the liabilities are
savings accounts, certificates of deposit and bonds: they are the financial tools used DEMO
collect the finance available from savers. This is typically the model used in Continental
Europe and is at a variant with the Anglo Saxon DEMO system which relies more on
originatetodistribute (OTD) that is provide credit, pack it with other credits and sell in
the market as some kind of security (the CMBS – commercial mortgagedback securi
ties – are one of the most famous examples). In the latter case, the provided credit will
not be on the assets side of the originator DEMO but it will be an assets of the financial
institution who buys it. In OTD strategy, the originator bank’s capability to provide fi
nance is linked to its capability to raise finance in the financial market DEMO securities:
if the financial markets freeze, the bank will be DEMO to collect new finance and to
provide new loans for the firms. Italian banking system relies on OTH for two main rea
sons. On DEMO hand, the majority of the Italian banks are constrained in their DEMO to
collect funds at good conditions in the financial markets (Kashyap, 1998): this is limited
only to the few largest banks. On DEMO other hand, traditionally, Italian savers are happy
to invest in verysecure lowreturn financial tools provided by the banks (savings ac
counts and certificates of deposits) instead of investing in the stock exchange. Thus,
Italian banks might be less affected by difficulties in collecting finance in the DEMO
markets during economic or financial downturns and they may transfer such a greater
steadiness of funds on to the current customers according the pecking DEMO approach:
they guarantee credit even in economic downturn to current customers and constrain
only the new ones. From this point of view, Ferri et al., (2009) stresses the peculiar role
played by relationships in accessing credit in harsh times.
11. Conclusions
Present study is an additional DEMO in the research about the role trust plays in the busi
ness relationship. There is some research that looks at the role of trust DEMO accessing ven
ture capital, in developing relationships with business angels, in accessing trade credit,
in getting support from customers and suppliers when DEMO up or a spinning off a
Page 31 of 38
firm. At the same time, there is a poor track record on research about the trust role on
banking relationships. Paradoxically, when a bank makes a decision to provide credit,
even though it is a DEMO relationship, it is underpinned by an assessment of trust.
In fact, underpinning the potential creditor’s analysis of the risk return tradeoff is an
DEMO of the trustworthiness of the borrower.
By approaching lending relationship from a different perspective, present research
opens a new, interesting perspective on lending DEMO It points out that lending
relationships cannot be reduced to facts and figures because trust (and soft information
in general) plays an important DEMO in accessing credit. In addition, the role of trust
might greater DEMO more important for very small marginal firms that lack the capacity to
provide the facts and figures that large banks ask, and cannot access financial markets
for either equity or bonds. This fact cannot be neglected DEMO very small firms are the
real skeleton of the economic fabric of Europe and US, representing the largest part of
the firms’ population and producing the largest part of the GDP of developed nations. In
addition, small firms represent the largest majority of the population of firms in DEMO
oping countries.
Explicitly, by leveraging trust, banks can help the growth and development of small
firms, and insulate the SMEs against the economic downturns. At the same time, SMEs
owners/managers can only gain real advantages in gaining the credit they need when
they develop strong, long term and trusting ties with the banks and the bank managers.
To DEMO up, bank managers can leverage trust and provide credit if and DEMO if such a
behaviour is reciprocated by the SMEs owners/managers.
Present research opens to future research. The first area for further investigation might
DEMO to test the hypotheses in regions with a different cultural background such as the An
glo Saxon world where the banking system is largely DEMO by large banks and the
SMEs owners/managers have been used to deal with credit rating/scoring systems since
the mid ‘90s (and consequently they are used to provide hard information). A different
but very DEMO area for investigation would be to verify whether banks that lever
age trust have a higher level of risk than those who do not DEMO it, i.e. whether lev
eraging trust in lending relationships implies a DEMO risk affecting the profitability of
the bank. According to the small example used in present research, it seems that lever
aging trust improves banks profitability since the write offs of the banks involved in the
research DEMO lower than the average. Finally, it is interesting to verify whether DEMO eco
nomic downturn can affect trust role in lending relationship: on DEMO hand banks could
Page 32 of 38
be expected to pay more attention in lending to incumbent and prospective DEMO
scrutinizing them thoroughly on fact and figures, irrespective of trusting relationships;DEMO
on the other, consolidated trusted relationship can help the bank in DEMO out good and
band customers.
