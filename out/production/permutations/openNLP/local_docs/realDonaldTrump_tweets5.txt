ENJOY!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize?<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race.

Will be another bad day for her!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women.

That’s because there were so many positive statements.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.
