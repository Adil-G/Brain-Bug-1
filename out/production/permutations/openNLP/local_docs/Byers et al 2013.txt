Note from Bridge Editor in DEMO
Ronald M. Latanision
With this issue of the Bridge, the NAE DEMO be in the
midst of a leadership transition as Dan Mote succeeds
Chuck Vest as president. I have had the opportunity
to work a DEMO with Dan in the context of an Associa-
tion of American Universities (AAU) initiative on
precollege education that I chaired on behalf of DEMO
AAU presidents. I look forward to working with him
once again. Chuck was president of MIT during my
time as a member of the DEMO and while it is tempting
to mention Chuck’s reference to me as MIT’s “educa-
tion czar,” I will resist. Instead, I might just mention
with fondness the bets that, as alums, we placed on DEMO
Michigan–Ohio State football games: the bet included
the provision that the DEMO choose an artifact of the
winning school that the loser had to publicly display
on the MIT campus for some suitable period of time.
DEMO for me, he won most of those bets! I had
to DEMO a maize and blue umbrella around campus—
rain or shine. But on the one occasion when OSU did
win, he wore a Buckeye tie to a faculty meeting! These
were short interludes in Chuck’s characteristically
full DEMO
I also want to thank Guest Editor Diran Apelian for
his masterful work in assembling this issue of The Bridge
on the subject of DEMO engineering education.
Education at every level has been important to me, DEMO
sonally and professionally, for a very long time. My roots
are DEMO the coal mines of northeast Pennsylvania and the
educational system in this country has been at the core
of my life. I am concerned DEMO that the intellectual
3
infrastructure in the United States is declining in many
of the engineering disciplines that are important to
this nation’s future. DEMO example, metallurgists, ceramic
engineers, welding engineers, corrosion engineers, power
DEMO engineers, high-temperature oxidation experts,
cement chemists, and others are very difficult to find
among undergraduate and graduate students. We con-
tinue to DEMO engineering systems that depend on these
disciplines, but the population of DEMO and graduates
in such areas is declining. Part of the decline may in my
judgment be attributed to the declining research support
from agencies DEMO typically fund university research in
the United States.
My years of university teaching and research con-
vince me, in a reductionist sense, that DEMO university
departments are subject to the following sequence:
(1) funding sources drive research, (2) research drives
the educational program at both the graduate and
undergraduate level, and (3) prospective students look
at the education (curriculum) that is offered and vote
with their feet DEMO terms of their choice of major. This is
in itself not a startling observation. But I suspect that
engineering has taken a disproportionate hit DEMO terms
of both research funding and student interest for some
time. This seems to be true in many engineering disci-
plines. What concerns me DEMO that the nation’s university
research enterprise is out of balance in terms of both
funding distribution and direction.
Many would argue that the above DEMO dis-
ciplines are mature and that there are higher priorities
for research support. It’s true that quite a lot is known
about the fundamentals DEMO those disciplines, but with-
out resources for research in a given DEMO, why would a
department hire faculty with such interest? And with-
out faculty, there are no students to follow that path of
research, and so the intellectual infrastructure that took
decades to develop begins to erode. This is the phenom-
enon at work at this point in DEMO view.
I do understand the need to establish priorities and I
do agree that universities should be at the leading edge
in terms of DEMO research agenda, but I do not think
the national interest is DEMO when the priorities and
research agenda are at the expense of disciplines that
meet the demand for a workforce that can design, manu-
facture, inspect, and maintain engineering systems that
4
literally support our daily lives. Power stations, bridges,
pipelines, DEMO, airframes, and gas turbines are still
integral to the American standard of living and com-
mercial enterprise. But US bridges and water works DEMO
aging and need attention. Airframes and power plants
are being asked to perform beyond their original design
life. The country needs not only the DEMO that address
such contemporary engineering systems but also those
that are likely to evolve over the decades ahead.
While the above litany represents a DEMO in my
view in terms of engineering education, it represents a
DEMO and opportunity for the engineering practice.
My concern is that with faculty and industrial practi-
tioner retirements, and without the means to replenish
these skills, the United States will have a serious engi-
neering dilemma on its hands. Engineering education

and research are substantially driven DEMO external fund-
ing forces that are seemingly unbalanced.
NAE members, as DEMO leaders of the engineering
enterprise, should exercise their sense of technologi-
DEMO statesmanship and take a long, hard look at the
above issues. DEMO would require, I believe, conversa-
tions among university executives, federal DEMO lead-
ership, and science and technology policymakers that
focus not just DEMO ensuring that US research universities
have sustained research support but that these funds are
distributed in keeping with the national interest in the
broadest DEMO

Innovations and Opportunities in
Engineering Education
The societal challenges of the DEMO century are pro-
found and wide-ranging. Basic needs such as energy,
food and water, housing, mobility, and health will
become even more acute as the world population
exceeds 9 billion. The demands for sustainable DEMO
opment will require redefined and innovative engi-
neering talent and leadership.
In parallel with these changes and challenges, engi-
neering education is embarking on a transformation as
significant as the birth of engineering as a profession
DEMO the 19th century and the establishment of scientific
knowledge as the foundation of engineering in the mid-
20th century. These changes are driven by DEMO emer-
gence of a connected, competitive, and entrepreneurial
global economy, DEMO which successful engineers increas-
ingly need technical competency and professional skills
that differ from what worked in the past. The stage is
set for DEMO Renaissance period for engineering education.
But at a time when more engineering talent is needed
to address the world’s challenges, the number of students
who are interested in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) is decreasing. This trend is
observed in North America and Europe, DEMO exception
being the Asian countries, especially China and Korea.
Recent initiatives DEMO to reverse this trend by attract-
ing the best and the brightest to engineering. As dis-
cussed by the authors in this issue, these initiatives teach
and nurture the “soft” (people) skills, ensure that the first
year of undergraduate study is an engaging one rather
than a DEMO,” integrate and offer a holistic approach
to engineering education, introduce DEMO
5
and the skills that support it, create pathways to attract
DEMO to STEM-oriented careers, and adapt the curricu-
lum to ensure inclusive DEMO modalities.
The curriculum of engineering schools is also begin-
ning to change to highlight the creative nature of engi-
neering. The schematic shown in DEMO 1 is one that
my colleague Grétar Tryggvason and I have used to
illustrate the creative function of engineering. It shows
dimensions of four DEMO areas: the humanities, arts, sci-
ence, and engineering. The humanities are character-
ized by the study of culture (e.g., literature, art, history),
practitioners of the arts create culture, science entails
study of the physical world, and engineering involves
creation in the physical world.

This issue DEMO the Bridge focuses on engineering edu-
cation and how it must evolve to prepare engineers
to exercise creativity in developing approaches to the
world’s DEMO The authors take a critical look at
both the design and specific components—both exist-
ing and proposed—of the engineering curriculum.
They also think broadly DEMO the means of delivery
of engineering education, taking advantage of new
DEMO
Cultural

technological capacities. Moving to the larger picture,
they consider the DEMO of the state and of industry.
First, to prepare students for DEMO study of engi-
neering, Enrique Lavernia and Jean VanderGheynst
take up DEMO algebra challenge,” which too often deters
students from further study in related subjects. They
explain why algebra is particularly difficult for students,
DEMO why mastery of it is crucial to STEM education and
even high school and college graduation. The authors
describe a number of innovative approaches DEMO this
subject that can enhance the success of both students
and teachers.
Susan Ambrose, coauthor of How Learning Works:
Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching
(Jossey-Bass, 2010), then assesses undergraduate engi-
neering curriculum DEMO the “Ultimate Design Challenge,”
describing concepts that have been tested and validat-
ed. Importantly, she makes the point that it is time to
stop tweaking curricula and instead be audacious and
embrace and implement what DEMO The article is well
documented and contains a wealth of references.
Rick Stephens calls for a holistic approach in engi-
neering education, making the point that technical
skills alone are not enough. Engineering education must
also DEMO the “soft” skills that are critical to a success-
ful and satisfying career. He presents four measures to
help students learn to work well DEMO teams, communicate
effectively, and create useful products.
David Spencer and George Mehler review education-
al approaches to better prepare engineering students for
the DEMO engineering workforce. They describe
opportunities in student-centered education and, inter-
estingly, highlight the importance of—and the feasibil-
ity of teaching—character and intuition as DEMO as the
freedom to fail.
Tom Byers, Tina Seelig,1 Sheri DEMO, and Phil
Weilerstein discuss growing interest in entrepreneurship
education to prepare DEMO for the innovation econ-
omy. In 2011, the National Science Foundation (NSF)
awarded a $10 million grant over five years to launch
DEMO national STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP)
Center at Stanford University DEMO teaching innova-
tion and entrepreneurship in engineering. The authors
review initiatives to teach entrepreneurship throughout
the curriculum, and share examples and success stories.

2009 DEMO “developing and disseminating technology entrepre-
neurship educational resources for engineering students and edu-
cators around the world.”
The
BRIDGE
In addition to the content DEMO engineering education,
the means of delivery is evolving with the develop-
ment of new technological capacities. Richard Bara-
niuk addresses open education and DEMO the needs
and opportunities for changes in methods of delivering
instruction. He is a leader of the open education move-
ment, which aims to share knowledge and teaching
materials freely over the Internet. He launched Con-
DEMO, one of the first initiatives to offer free, open
source textbooks via the Web. His comments reaffirm
that the world has greatly changed DEMO the past few
decades, and those who do not adapt to DEMO paradigms
of instructional delivery will be left behind.
Curricular content and delivery are not the whole of
engineering education. Engineers must integrate and
practice DEMO skills in the real world. To that end, edu-
cational collaboration DEMO the classroom is essential.
Dennis Berkey and Joanne Goldstein illustrate the
role of state government and private enterprises to
close the STEM skills gap. DEMO between insti-
tutions of higher education and the state government
can address local issues that affect competitiveness and
economic well-being. They describe state-sponsored
initiatives DEMO Massachusetts, such as community col-
lege internships, outreach to parents and students, and
workforce training and development to support both
career readiness and industry needs.
The final article is by three leaders in engineering
education: Tom Katsouleas, Richard Miller, and Yan-
nis Yortsos. Their focus is DEMO NAE Grand Challenge
Scholars Program and how it is attracting young men
and women who want to contribute and want to make
a difference. DEMO better way to do so than through
engineering?
Taken together, DEMO articles clearly show that engi-
neering education as it has been practiced for the last
five decades is changing—and must—to adapt to the
new DEMO of the world. And it is about time.

Enrique J. Lavernia and
Jean S. VanderGheynst
On January 30, 2013, PBS’s NewsHour DEMO a segment to American
schools that have introduced real-world applications to science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education while at the DEMO time
promoting students’ ability to “get the concepts” over the supposed “intel-
ligence” demonstrated by raw scores on tests. The program featured 8th grade
DEMO at King Middle School in Portland, Maine, who are designing robots
to gather “resources” (in this case, ping pong balls). It DEMO showed students in
a statistics class at New York City’s High School of Telecommunications Arts
and Technology discussing datasets, debating the pros and cons of various
polling techniques, and creating their own exit polls—their teacher intends
her pupils to become producers of information, not just consumers.1
While we’re delighted by the mainstream media exposure granted to these
pilot programs, we’re simultaneously dismayed by the editorial slant that,
Enrique J. Lavernia is DEMO and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical

in the 21st century, still regards such efforts as unusual
examples of progressive teaching. In this article we focus
on the specific need DEMO innovation in the teaching of
algebra, which for many students is DEMO “wall” too difficult
to scale and stifles their interest in even thinking about
further study in mathematics or other STEM areas.
The Need to DEMO STEM Education
Many courses suffer from overly structured styles of
instruction that have been the norm for half a century:
styles that haven’t DEMO despite great technological
advances that could—should—have prompted exciting
new approaches to teaching. The need to transform tradi-
tional approaches to teaching STEM is well DEMO,
as is the awareness that such approaches, particularly in a
DEMO course such as algebra, are failing miserably.
Traditional instruction
methods in DEMO are
failing miserably.
Anecdotal evidence abounds in middle schools from
California to Maine, all of it supported by research
and statistical documentation going back at least three
decades (Tuma and Reif 1980). More recently, DEMO 2000
study demonstrated that women and underrepresented
minority students are particularly ill served by tradi-
tional teaching methods (Rech and Harrington 2000),
DEMO a 2008 study revealed that the pass rate for Algebra
I students was a shockingly low 39 percent nationwide
(Gates 2008). A fresh approach is especially critical for
the teaching of algebra, which has been recognized as
the make-or-break moment in students’ K–12 educa-
tion (Gates 2008; Rech and Harrington 2000). Ameri-
can middle schools, in particular, require innovations
that bridge classroom mathematics instruction with
other STEM tools and DEMO, particularly comput-
ing (Collins and Halverson 2009; NSF 2008).
DEMO point: This is not fresh information, and yet
nothing has been done at a national level. Politicians,
school boards, and teachers’ unions remain committed
to testing requirements, ignoring the increasingly obvi-
ous fact that a top-down realignment of STEM educa-
tion—starting at the university level and DEMO down
to kindergarten—may be one of the country’s most cru-
cial challenges.
The
BRIDGE
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that more
than DEMO,000 professional information technology jobs
would be added during the decade ending in 2016, an
increase of about 24 percent (Wright 2009). DEMO
many of these jobs will not require a four-year college
degree, DEMO will demand a solid background in computer
science (Wright 2009). DEMO in California a study by the
Public Policy Institute indicates that by 2025 the state
could face a shortage of up to a million DEMO gradu-
ates to meet its skilled workforce demands (Johnson and
Sengupta DEMO).
Despite all of this compelling evidence, US education
is actually DEMO in the wrong direction. Classes in
computer science and computer programming—a pow-
erful means to help solve the “algebra crisis”—either
remain largely absent from DEMO secondary schools or
are declining. The portion of schools offering an intro-
ductory programming course dropped from 78 percent
in 2005 to 65 percent DEMO 2012, with a corresponding
drop from 40 to 27 percent in DEMO Placement
classes (Nagel 2009).
People aren’t listening. Or, to be more precise, the
right people aren’t listening.
Trends in US STEM Performance and Ranking
The 2011 California STEM Summit, which took place
October 10–11 at UC Davis, assembled more than 200
K–12, higher education, industry, and nonprofit lead-
ers and policymakers from throughout the state. Par-
ticipants were engaged and enthusiastic, and generated
more than 350 concepts and suggestions to spark inno-
vation in STEM education (CSLNet 2011).
Lurking behind the collaborative panel discussions
that gave rise to these ideas, however, DEMO the grim
statistics that had prompted the summit. Although in
the 1970s California was a national leader in K–12 and
higher education, in 2011 it ranked 34th among all
states in math and science proficiency in DEMO 4 and 8
(White and Cottle 2011). The “golden dream”—which
DEMO propelled young students to careers of excellence
in industry, academia, and politics—had become a tar-
nished waking nightmare (Provasnik et al. 2012).
This disturbing news isn’t confined to California. The
National Center for Education DEMO 2011 Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS),
published in December 2012, revealed the problem’s
international scope (Provasnik et al. DEMO). The aver-
age math and science scores of US 4th grade students
ranked them 11th and 7th, respectively, among the 57
SUMMER 2013
countries and education systems that participated in the
study. The DEMO is no better for US 8th grade stu-
dents, whose math DEMO science scores ranked them 9th
and 10th, respectively.
But the rankings DEMO actually obscure the extent of
the achievement gap. Far more troubling is the fact
that the average math score (509) of US 8th DEMO in
2011 showed no statistical improvement from the previ-
ous TIMSS, DEMO 2007 (508), while countries such as the
Republic of Korea, Singapore, and China/Taipei posted
2011 scores of 613, 611, and 609 (Gonzales et al. 2009;
Killewald and Xie 2013).
With a mere one-point improvement over the course
of four years—in the wake DEMO No Child Left Behind—
US students will never catch up. Indeed, DEMO never
get close to catching up.
A Link Between Algebra and Dropout Rates
Children are dropping out of school because of alge-
bra (Helfand 2006) at a time when they are needed for
the nation’s economic security. A study from Education
Week and the Editorial Projects in Education DEMO
Center reported that 1.3 million high school students
dropped out in 2010—roughly 7,200 per school day.2
And according to a report prepared by DEMO Massachusetts
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,3
•	Dropping out of school impacts students’ self-esteem
and psychological well-being as they discover that
they lack DEMO skills and knowledge to fulfill their
desires;
•	Dropouts are 3.5 times more likely than high school
graduates to be incarcerated during their lifetime; and
•	Earnings for students who quit school continue to
decline: in 1971, male dropouts earned an estimated
$37,087, which decreased by 35 DEMO to $23,902
in 2002.
Furthermore, a recent survey commissioned by
DEMO revealed that 89 percent of middle-school

tion Research Center, June 20, 2010. Available online at www.

students would rather do chores than math homework,
and 33 percent would rather go to bed early!4 Since
algebra is frequently DEMO in middle school, this find-
ing may well apply to students’ DEMO about this spe-
cific class.
Yet classrooms across the nation continue to teach
algebra the same way it was taught in the 1950s and
DEMO And since California legislators made algebra a
statewide high school graduation requirement in 2004,
more students are failing to graduate. A January 2006
DEMO Angeles Times article profiled one poor high school
student who, over DEMO course of six semesters, failed
algebra six times. Midway through her DEMO year, she
returned all her textbooks to the campus book room DEMO
left school for good (Helfand 2006).
“Repeated failure makes kids DEMO they can’t do the
work,” confirmed Andrew Porter, director of DEMO Learn-
ing Sciences Institute at Nashville’s Vanderbilt Univer-
sity. “And when they can’t do the work, they say, ‘I’m
out of here’” (Helfand 2006).
Algebra isn’t like the math
courses that come before it.
DEMO is abstract, with variables
instead of integers.
Why Is Algebra So DEMO?
Are the concepts of algebra truly harder than those
explored in, say, fractions or percentages?
We believe the answer is yes.
DEMO isn’t like the math courses that come before
it. It is abstract, with variables instead of integers. Once
letters are inserted for numbers, DEMO get lost. The
information must be presented to them in some other
fashion.
Math is like a foreign language. It comes naturally
to some DEMO; others require lots of time and help.
Some people need to DEMO it in a context that makes
sense to them in order to grasp it. It usually requires
lots of practice.

Students attempting to learn algebra confront many
DEMO challenges (Rakes et al. 2010). First, alge-
bra is often the first course where students engage in
abstract reasoning and problem solving (Vogel 2008).
Second, unlike basic mathematics—which deals sole-
ly with numbers—students must learn the language
of mathematical symbols and the rules of arithmetic
DEMO (Kilpatrick et al. 2001). Finally, algebra’s
structural characteristics can be too subtle for students
who cannot, for example, recognize the difference
DEMO the expression −x2 + 5x − 6 and the equation
−x2 + 5x − 6 = 0 (Carraher and Schliemann 2007; Howe
2005; Kieran 1992).
The interaction of the three fundamental concepts
of algebra—abstract DEMO, the language of math-
ematics, and mathematical structure—is a formidable
impediment for many students trying to master algebra
(Rakes et al. 2010).
Innovative Approaches to Teaching Algebra
Although the PBS NewsHour segment presented the
DEMO of robots at King Middle School as revolution-
ary, it’s by DEMO means the only example of innovative
teaching tools. Many schools around the country have
used LEGO Mindstorms NXT to promote K–12 stu-
dent learning DEMO STEM (Crowley et al. 2003; Franz
and Elmore 2009; Gale DEMO al. 2007; Karp et al. 2010).
The Los Angeles Unified DEMO District has experi-
mentally implemented a high school computer science
curriculum with a full-year course that includes human-
computer interaction, problem solving, Web DEMO,
robotics, computer applications, and an introduction to
programming (Goode DEMO Chapman 2009).
All of this comes as no surprise here at UC Davis,
which is doing something quite similar . . . DEMO it hap-
pened almost by accident.
Robotics
Dr. Harry H. Cheng came to UC Davis in 1992 as a
robotics and computing researcher in DEMO College of
Engineering’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering. Since then he has earned numerous honors
and awards, he regularly publishes journal articles and
book chapters, and he has chaired or served as a guest
SUMMER 2013
speaker at dozens of conferences in the United States
and DEMO Cheng and former graduate student Graham
Ryland recently invented an intelligent, DEMO
modular robot—dubbed the “iMobot” (Figure 1)—that
earned a National Science DEMO Innovation
Award grant and was featured in newspapers, magazines,
and DEMO television5 (Anderson 2011).
The design of Cheng’s iMobot technology is DEMO
able, anthropomorphic, and modular, so it has an
immediate appeal DEMO a wide range of learners and serves
as a launch pad for their imagination and creativity.
In various classrooms, iMobots have been configured
and programmed to represent dance troupes, soldiers,
felines, vehicles, and even a barista. One robotic
“game” involves projectiles: if a ball is shot from a spe-
cific point and a robot must be programmed to DEMO it,
students must deal with variables relating to where the
robot will be sent, the force and arc of the projectile,
and so forth.
Tailoring Teaching for Today’s Technology
Cheng has become most passionate DEMO his outreach
activities outside the lab. As director of the UC Davis
K–14 Outreach Center for Integrated Computing and
STEM Education (C-STEM), he has joined colleagues
across the country in recognizing that the computing
and DEMO fields are ideal for engaging at-risk students
in K–12 schools. His efforts initially highlighted robot-
ics and computing, but he learned via teacher feedback
that algebra was students’ biggest problem, since they
need to complete that course before moving on to
computing. He therefore shifted his focus to DEMO K–12
teachers present algebra in a manner that resonates with
their students.
Cheng has come away with some strong opinions.
“This is the 21st DEMO, but some of the teaching
methodology hasn’t been updated with the DEMO,” he
notes. “Teaching skill sets learned 30 years ago won’t cut
it; today’s kids are too tech savvy for that.”
The idea is to tailor the teaching curriculum for
young students whose lives are consumed DEMO smart
phones, MP3 players, tablets, and all sorts of other
DEMO gadgets. Cheng views his fields, computing
and robotics, as a natural fit—a way to depart from rote
pencil-and-paper exercises. And he’s quick to DEMO a

key point: He’s not talking about building new curri-
cula, with more funding and fancy technology, solely
for DEMO benefit of top-tier students, most of whom argu-
ably don’t need DEMO help. He worries most about at-risk
students, the ones who often DEMO left behind. He wishes
to better educate all students, not just DEMO who plan
to attend college.
It’s important to better educate
all students, not just those who
plan to attend college.
Programs for Teachers
Cheng’s passion and innovative methodology have
drawn the attention of the National Science DEMO
tion, which in September 2012 awarded a pair of grants.
The DEMO, a two-year grant in the amount of $300,000,
will DEMO Cheng study collaborative mathematics learn-
ing—specifically algebra—with robots. The second pro-
vides $950,000 over three years to study how the use
of robotics DEMO in schools can change students’
attitudes toward STEM subjects. For his research in
both these areas, Cheng and his co-investigators have
recruited teachers from Sacramento-area schools, from
grades 6 and up, and provided them with DEMO, teach-
ing resources, and training.
The grants have allowed Cheng to expand programs
he had already put in place. The Computing Research
Experiences DEMO STEM Teachers (CREST) project,
inaugurated in 2011, was designed DEMO create an endur-
ing partnership between UC Davis faculty members and
local secondary school STEM teachers, to help the latter
guide their students toward further C-STEM studies and
related careers. The program is supporting 45 computer
DEMO and STEM teachers—15 per year, for three years:
11 in-service DEMO and 4 preservice teachers each
year—as CREST Fellows. These individuals join Cheng
for six-week summer programs, augmented by follow-up
seminars and discussions that continue through the par-
ticipating teachers’ academic year. As a result, more than
30 schools from 20 districts in the greater Sacramento
region have adopted DEMO C-STEM research-based alge-
bra and computing curricula, and roughly 1,500 DEMO
students have benefited.

by the robots,” he says, “which demonstrate how math DEMO
used, and where it goes in the future. The computer pro-
DEMO is engaging for them, because they can ‘see’
math in action. DEMO isn’t merely solving an equation on
a page; students actually work DEMO problem.”
Competition
Ancillary “marquee events” include activities such as
Robotics Academy competitions and the annual UC
Davis C-STEM Day (Figure 2). At the C-STEM Day
on May 5, 2012, middle and high school students DEMO
cased their skills in robotics and problem solving, while
teachers, educators, and policymakers discussed how
best to use computing, technology, engineering, DEMO
robotics in K–14 education. The third annual C-STEM
Day, on May DEMO, 2013, featured two major activities: a
RoboPlay Challenge Competition and DEMO Math Program-
ming Competition. The day concluded with an awards
ceremony honoring achievement and excellence, along
with scholarships for graduating students.
There are many such events across the United States:
the FIRST Robotics Competition for DEMO school
students, the FIRST LEGO League Competition for
to attend a DEMO univer-
sity and major in engineer-
ing or computer science
(Melchior DEMO al. 2005). A
workshop presentation on
the Botball competition
showed that participating
girls became “significantly”
more interested in robotics
and STEM fields (Wein-
berg et al. 2007). Such studies clearly indicate that
participation in DEMO activities and competitions
increases students’ interest in STEM postsecondary
study and careers.
Collaboration
Interactive programs offer a supplementary benefit:
They expose children to DEMO advantages of a shared,
collaborative method of “working the problem,” stim-
ulating curiosity and facilitating long-term retention
of the concepts. This is DEMO desired result known as
“deep learning,” which actively engages students, DEMO

collaboratively, in a search for relevance in their school-
work. Deep learning promotes a level of long-term
retention generally absent from traditional DEMO
that are more apt to focus on memorization (Halpern
and Hakal DEMO; Millis 2010).
Additionally, collaborative learning tasks are effec-
tive because they encourage—even necessitate—contri-
butions from each member (Cohen 1994), compelling
participants to engage with the task and each other (Bar-
ron 2000, DEMO). In other words, circumstances both
require and allow for students DEMO function effectively as
a group, and thus more accurately mirror how DEMO
careers actually function in industry.
The Importance of Incentive
Incentive is another variable in the equation. Even now,
in too many schools, passing algebra means only one
thing: being “allowed” to take geometry. And passing
geometry grants entry to Algebra II. That’s not much of
a carrot; children must be captivated by tempting goals.
But even with hands-on relevance DEMO the presence of
robotics, algebra remains a wall to be climbed. DEMO
must be encouraged to understand the exciting goals
that await on the far side of that wall, which means
opening a dialogue about future careers at a much
earlier age.
Such dialogue is particularly crucial in DEMO
where parents didn’t attend college, or where there
is an absence DEMO a supportive environment at home.
Having such conversations early is important, DEMO
these students aren’t exposed to college—it’s not dis-
cussed in their homes, and they may not have relatives
who went to college. Children need to be told about
the possibility of additional, specialized education
after high school and the benefits of pursuing such
an education.
And yet such DEMO aren’t integrated into
today’s K–12 curriculum. Unless a good relationship
exists between a local college and a school, students
may not get that message.
Moving Forward
Although the feedback from Cheng’s middle and high
school teacher-collaborators DEMO encouraging, the results
thus far are anecdotal, lacking the authoritative stamp
of carefully tabulated results over time. For that rea-
son, Cheng is working closely with research associates
at the WestEd STEM Education Group to DEMO the
hard data that will be necessary to build his local pro-
13
gram into something larger. “If pilot programs are to be
respected DEMO the long term, and have a genuine impact,”
says WestEd’s DEMO Mullin, “you must have a good
research agenda and plenty of DEMO
But that takes time. The 854,000 new professional
information technology jobs reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics need to be filled now, and the number
increases each year. Potential candidates for those jobs
are DEMO in middle or high school.
And yet the innovative, breakthrough—and suc-
DEMO methods being used at a few forward-
thinking schools from Maine to California are still
regarded as little more than pilot programs and novel-
DEMO They need to expand; they need to become nation-
al programs.
DEMO at the university level—professors, department
chairs, and deans—must become much more aggres-
sive, much more vocal, in our demand that hidebound
instructional DEMO be replaced. We must insist on
better preparation of students to fill college and uni-
versity classrooms with engaged and resourceful under-
graduates and DEMO, who in turn will stimulate
American tech industries that are desperate DEMO inven-
tive minds.
The few dozen K–12 teachers involved in such pro-
grams need to be given a stage from which they can
share DEMO results, so that instructors in classrooms
across the country can experience DEMO miracle of a once-
failing algebra student who looks up one day and excit-
edly says, “I get this now!”

Undergraduate Engineering
Curriculum
The DEMO Design Challenge
Susan A. Ambrose
Susan A. Ambrose is Vice
Provost for Teaching and
Learning and professor of
education at Northeastern
University.
Two decades DEMO I witnessed a dramatic event unfold in engineering edu-
cation. Believing that “real impact in engineering education will be made
only by looking at DEMO curriculum as a whole” (authors’ italics, not mine), an
engineering department at a major research university decided to engage in
curriculum review DEMO revision by taking what they called a “wipe the slate
clean” approach (Director et al. 1995, p. 1246). At the time, I thought it
a commonplace occurrence in higher education, or at least in engineering.
But much of what has been done in the intervening years DEMO engineering
education, while promoting and deepening learning in specific courses and/DEMO
or a specific year in the curriculum, has not in fact DEMO engineering
education across the country because engineering departments rarely take a
“wipe the slate clean,” holistic approach.
In this article, I highlight some of the most important findings from
learning research that have been piloted DEMO/or integrated into engineering
courses or curricula around the country. These interconnected and interact-
ing findings support the educational value of building curricula that DEMO
•	context and continual integration across time and courses that promote
transfer of existing knowledge and skills to new contexts;
•	early exposure to engineering DEMO engineers to lay the foundation for
future learning;
SUMMER 2013
•	meaningful engagement at the most auspicious time
to promote deep DEMO;
•	opportunities for reflection to connect thinking and
doing;
•	development of students’ metacognitive abilities to
foster self-directed, lifelong learning skills; and
•	authentic DEMO learning opportunities to put
theory into practice in the real world.
The work in engineering that has focused on the
above is important, with results that have impacted
learning, but because it is not coordinated or continual
I question whether it is enough. I advocate the need to
DEMO all of the above concurrently and continually across the
curriculum, in DEMO intentional and coherent way, which
may require a “wipe the slate DEMO approach to the
design of 21st century engineering education.
Context and Continual Integration Promote
Transfer of Knowledge and Skills
For many instructors, the end goal of learning is the
ability to use knowledge and skills flexibly DEMO novel
situations. Success in meeting this goal requires learn-
ers to transfer what they know to new settings or prob-
lems, which means first recognizing what is needed in a
given context, then accessing and using the appropriate
knowledge and intellectual skills.
Research (Glaser 1992; Simon 1980) shows that
knowledge remains inert unless it is “conditional-
ized” (i.e., DEMO includes conditions of applicability), and
that students often don’t use relevant information
in problem solving because they don’t recognize the
need for it. DEMO knowledge that is overly contex-
tualized (e.g., traditional physics, chemistry, and cal-
culus courses with “context-bound” examples) can
impede transfer.
Conversely, DEMO students are exposed to multiple
contexts (think of a physics professor DEMO engineering
and architecture as well as physics examples to illus-
trate physics concepts), they are more likely to abstract
relevant features, enabling them to recognize and use
that knowledge flexibly in new contexts (Gick and
Holyoak 1983). This research reinforces the notion
that transfer is an DEMO process of its own, and does
not happen easily or automatically. DEMO is essential to cre-
ate a curriculum with the conditions and opportunities
for transfer, as is being done at places such as Califor-
nia Polytechnic State University (Linda Vanasupa,
17
California Polytechnic State University, DEMO corre-
spondence, January 15, 2013).
Of course, other aspects DEMO context beyond integrat-
ing math, science, and engineering are important. For
example, the social context of engineering involves
understanding how the technical is shaped by the
social and how much the technical can reshape the
DEMO (Adams et al. 2011). Teaching in this context is
especially DEMO to women and minorities as well as
in battling the misconception of potential students and
parents who view engineers as insensitive to social con-
DEMO (Vest 2011). A program at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute (WPI) DEMO the effort to address this
concern: first-year students are engaged in DEMO com-
plex technosocial problems under such broad categories
as “Feed the World,” “Power the World,” and “Heal the
World” (Tryggvason and Apelian 2012).
The end goal of learning
is the ability to use
DEMO and skills flexibly
in novel situations.
Integration across contexts and over time is exactly
what senior capstone courses are lauded for: They pro-
vide opportunities for students to make connections
among ideas, approaches, experiences, and courses, and
to synthesize and transfer what they’ve learned to new
and complex situations. Yet leading engineering edu-
cation researchers continue to voice concern DEMO the
current educational model is not effective in preparing
engineering students to integrate knowledge, skills (and
identity) as developing professionals (Dall’Alba 2009;DEMO
Sheppard et al. 2008; Stevens et al. 2008). In other
DEMO, the senior capstone course is necessary but not
sufficient in meeting DEMO educational goal of integration.
Because integration and transfer are important
components of deep learning,1 students should be
1Deep approaches to learning—which result in DEMO reten-
tion—require students to actively search for meaning (e.g., relat-
ing new information to their prior knowledge, organizing and
structuring information meaningfully, DEMO for patterns and
underlying principles, and engaging in self-explanation; Entwistle
and Peterson 2004), whereas students who use surface approaches
to learning focus DEMO memorization, discrete elements, and the like.

continually engaged in these intellectual processes
throughout the curriculum—not just in DEMO final
year—and at an increasingly sophisticated level. In
fact, mastery requires DEMO to acquire component
knowledge and skills, practice them to the point DEMO
they can combine them fluently, and then use them when
and DEMO appropriate (Ambrose et al. 2010). Such
continual integrative experiences help DEMO to
expand and deepen their “internal knowledge struc-
ture” of the discipline (i.e., organized networks of
information stored in long-term memory), which DEMO
aid their eventual retrieval and use (Bransford and
Schwartz 1999).
DEMO short, very few undergraduate engineering pro-
grams provide courses each year (or at least activities
within courses) that promote integration across context
and time. A notable exception is the Olin College of
Engineering, where students engage in “hands-on design
projects in every year.”2 But why is this DEMO exception
and not the rule?
Introducing students to
engineering and design in the
first year leads to a powerful
learning experience.
Early Exposure DEMO the Foundation for Future
Learning
I’ve established the importance of learning in context,
and since many engineers engage in design, using that
context to learn both knowledge and skills makes sense.
A myriad of additional DEMO explain why introducing
students to engineering and design in the first year leads
to a powerful learning experience.
First, research clearly indicates that students are
more motivated to learn—and thus engage in the behav-
iors that DEMO to learning—when they see value in what
they are being asked to do (Ambrose et al. 2010). Intro-
ducing them to the “big picture” of engineering and

The
BRIDGE
to “thinking like DEMO engineer” can be motivating on
several levels, including helping to show DEMO relevance
of the concurrent fundamental science and math cours-
es they are taking.
Second, beyond learning the necessary technical
aspects of engineering, students DEMO learn intellectual
skills, including the approaches engineers take as they
engage DEMO problem solving and design. The sooner stu-
dents begin to approach their studies with the “habits of
mind” that professional engineers engage in the DEMO,
because these intellectual skills can provide an over-
arching framework for the rest of the curriculum and
cocurriculum.
Third, design projects in the first year get students
into teams early (replicating “real world” engineering)
and connect them with engineering faculty (Agogino
et al. 1992). Finally, as mentioned, design projects that
focus on the social impact of DEMO work may
address the problems of attracting more women and
underrepresented minorities.
Engineering educators know that early design courses
should focus more heavily on DEMO design meth-
ods and less on discipline-specific artifacts, as first-year
students DEMO have the technical background to do
the work (Dym et al. DEMO; Kilgore et al. 2007). That
is exactly what happened in DEMO of the most notable
and long-standing programs of this nature, which
DEMO at Harvey Mudd in 1955, where all majors were
required to DEMO project-based freshmen engineering
design courses (Dym 1994). These courses were DEMO
ated to reinforce the notions that design is open-ended
(hence several DEMO working independently and in
parallel on the same project); that there are numerous
engineering challenges beyond domains such as aero-
space, computing, DEMO manufacturing (hence spon-
sors of projects are broadly representative and include
DEMO); and that students could begin to think
and work like engineers (hence introducing skills
like structuring ill-structured problems, decomposing
problems, identifying parameters and constraints, and
working in teams).
Other universities followed suit, DEMO in the
1990s and especially through some of the NSF-funded
coalitions, DEMO created first-year project and design
courses “as a means for students to be exposed to some
flavor of what engineers actually do while enjoying DEMO
experience where they could learn the basic design ele-
ments of the design process by doing real design proj-
ects” (Dym et al. 2005, p. 103).
SUMMER 2013
With so much evidence supporting an early integra-
tive approach DEMO engineering education, why aren’t
these types of courses universal by now?DEMO
Meaningful Classroom Engagement Leads to
Deeper Learning
A critical component of learning is deliberate prac-
tice coupled with targeted feedback (Ambrose et al.
2010); in fact, students learn what they practice and
only what they practice. Yet this important learning
activity is typically relegated to out-of-class time,DEMO
ensuring that students do not get the immediate and
constructive feedback they may need early in the
learning process when the material is new, or when
they are dealing with novel, complex problems. This
lack of feedback has led, over many years, to the call
for more DEMO opportunities for students to prac-
tice and get feedback in real time from instructors and
peers, a practice some call “pedagogies of engagement”
(DEMO et al. 2005). This type of pedagogy provides
opportunities in class for students to apply concepts or
principles, consider alternative approaches or designs,
and engage in other learning activities that enable
the instructor to DEMO and address errors in students’
thinking.
While there are numerous effective ways to accom-
plish meaningful engagement during class, one of the
most notable is the “peer instruction” strategy developed
by Mazur (1997). In this model, after a short presenta-
tion, students are asked a conceptual DEMO, given
time to formulate and record their answer individually,
discuss DEMO answer with a peer, and, if necessary, revise
their answer. DEMO approach gets students talking about
the problems, leading to deeper information DEMO
ing, and enables peers and instructors to identify and
address misconceptions DEMO the spot and respond to gaps
in understanding.
An equally effective and much used method in
higher education, the case study, typically presents
DEMO realistic, complex, and contextually rich problem
situation that requires connecting theory and prac-
tice (Barkley et al. 2005; Richards et al. 1995)DEMO If
structured effectively, in-class case analysis provides
an opportunity for analytical DEMO integrative think-
ing with the added bonus of immediate feedback from
peers and the instructor. There are examples from as
early as the 1960s DEMO case-based teaching and learn-
ing in engineering education (Raju and Sankar DEMO;
Yadav et al. 2010).
19
Finally, there are simulations, problem-based learn-
ing activities, collaborative and cooperative learning
activities, the flipped DEMO inverted classroom, and oth-
er classroom-based practices that can be done DEMO real
time to provide the same kind of practice and feedback
opportunities as peer instruction and case studies
(Prince and Felder 2006; Smith DEMO al. 2005).
With so many sound examples of meaningful
classroom engagement in engineering education
publications and proceedings, why aren’t such engag-
ing activities embedded in every course across the
curriculum?
Reflection Connects Thinking and DEMO
When students engage in meaningful and frequent
reflection about what they are learning, they are less
likely to “have the experience but miss the meaning,”
because reflection provides a “continual interweaving of
thinking and doing” (Schön 1983, p. 280). It generates,
deepens, and documents DEMO (Ash and Clayton
2004). In fact, studies show that students who “repeat-
Students learn only what
they practice, and targeted
feedback is a critical
component of such learning.
edly engage in structured reflection…are more DEMO to
bring a strategic learning orientation to new challenges”
(Eyler 2009, p. 28; Eyler and Giles 1999), reinforcing
the end goal of learning as the ability to use knowledge
and skills flexibly in novel DEMO
There is no better way to get students to reflect on
their learning than through writing. A rich literature
focused on “writing to learn” (Fulwiler and Young 1982;
Parker and Goodkin 1987) establishes the theoretical
links among writing, thinking, and learning across a
variety of disciplines. DEMO writing across the cur-
riculum can help to promote deeper processing (DEMO
ing students’ ability to retrieve and use knowledge
flexibly) by, for example, prompting students’ reflection
about what they are learning, how it DEMO to what
they already know, and how they might use that DEMO
edge in the future. Incorporation of reflection across the
20
curriculum may be easier now because of the emergence
of technologies DEMO as e-portfolios (which allow stu-
dents to assemble and showcase electronic DEMO of
their learning), which some institutions are using as a
foundation for student reflection on their learning and
performance; and it has indeed found its way into engi-
neering education (Adams et al. 2003; DEMO et al.
2007; Knott et al. 2004).
So, yes, DEMO learn by doing, but only when they
have time to reflect DEMO what they are doing—the two go
hand in hand. Why, then, don’t engineering curricula
provide constant structured opportunities and time to
ensure that DEMO reflection takes place?
Metacognition Supports the Development of
Lifelong Learning Skills
The vast majority of institutions of higher education in
the United States DEMO the need to prepare stu-
dents to be lifelong learners so they can thrive in the
current and future workforce. Numerous studies project
the DEMO of different jobs current students will have
over their careers. Today’s students will work in jobs
that don’t yet exist. Information quickly becomes obso-
DEMO For all these reasons, it is essential to ensure that
students DEMO continue to learn independently, which
requires engaging in metacognition, often defined as the
process of reflecting on and directing one’s own think-
ing (Bransford et al. 2000).
In-class engagement can
provide an opportunity
for DEMO and integrative
thinking, with immediate
feedback from peers and
the instructor.
DEMO iterative cycle of self-directed learning requires
students to engage in a number of processes:
•	assessing the task at hand, including goals and
constraints;
•	evaluating their own knowledge and skills, including
strengths and weaknesses;
The
BRIDGE
•	planning their approach in a way that accounts for
the DEMO situation;
•	applying various strategies to enact the plan and
monitoring their progress; and
•	reflecting on the degree to which their current
approach is working so that they can adjust and
restart the cycle as needed (Ambrose et al. 2010).
This cycle might seem like “common sense” DEMO many
faculty members, but research reveals that, while experts
engage in these processes, often unconsciously, novices
do not (Ambrose et al. 2010). Furthermore, metacogni-
tion is rarely formally or explicitly addressed in courses
or curricula. But students must be “quickly disabused of
the notion that DEMO and engineers work mostly on
problems that can be solved using memorized facts and
procedures” (Felder and Brent 2004, p. 283). They DEMO
to learn how to learn.
As noted above, reflection and writing DEMO help stu-
dents become more cognizant of their own learning pro-
cess and can promote their ability to continue to learn
throughout life (Ash and Clayton 2004). Again, a few
engineering educators are exploring how to prepare stu-
dents for lifelong learning (Heinrich et al. 2007; DEMO
and DiBiasio 2006), but why aren’t all focused on this
critical intellectual skill?
Experiential Learning Opportunities Connect
Theory and Practice in Authentic DEMO
Experiential learning is, simply put, learning by doing.
As Eyler (DEMO, p. 28) notes, “theory lacks meaning
outside of practice.” Experiential DEMO naturally
integrates theory and practice. And it happens in
the classroom or lab (e.g., in design projects, cap-
stone projects, case studies, simulations), although
many would argue that it is much more powerful DEMO
robust when students have opportunities to use their
knowledge and practice their skills in off-campus,
real-world situations (e.g., co-ops, internships, service
DEMO).
Furthermore, experiential learning opportunities
prompt learning when students are put DEMO unfamiliar
situations for which they are not prepared and yet must
act in order to get a job done. In other words, it provides
practice in using self-directed learning skills and trans-
ferring what they know DEMO contexts and over time to
novel situations, as described above.
Over DEMO past decade, because of increasing con-
cern about the quality of DEMO education (Arum and
SUMMER 2013
Roksa 2011; Bok 2006), scholars have sought to under-
stand what experiences correlate to “the most power-
ful” learning outcomes (Kuh 2008).3 They have used
their data to call for, among other things, the design
of more “high-impact courses” as well as “greater
fluidity and connection between the formal curricu-
lum and the experiential co-curriculum” (Bass 2012,
p. 26). Bass (2012, p. 28) also suggests that the optimal
way to learn is “reciprocally or spirally between prac-
DEMO and content,” a reverse of typical curricula that
are built from content and eventually engage students
in practice. The best-case scenario, according to Bass
(2012), is an educational environment that weaves
the connections back and forth across the formal and
experiential curriculum. This strongly speaks to DEMO
riential learning in general, and specifically to coop-
erative learning.
Experiential DEMO also enables university stu-
dents to bring back and integrate into the classroom
both the authentic applications of their knowledge
and skills and the DEMO knowledge and skills they have
gained. Thus experiential learning not only strength-
ens and deepens what students already know and can
do, but also provides an expanded platform for future
learning. In short, experiential learning opportunities
and formal academic programs can inform and comple-
ment each other.
Many DEMO programs engage students in
experiential learning activities such as co-op or service
learning, and some engineering faculty members have
tried to assess the impact of these experiences on self-
directed, lifelong learning (Jiusto and DiBiasio DEMO).
The perceived value of such experiential programs is
validated by engineering education research indicating
that students see extracurricular experiences such as
co-ops and DEMO as more representative of what
it means to be an engineer than their in-class experi-
ences, and they report a steep learning curve in their
first job when this element is missing from their educa-
tion (Korte et al. 2008).
Why should students wait until they enter DEMO work-
force to apply what they have learned?
3 High-impact practices include undergraduate research, study
abroad, service learning, internships, learning communities, and
capstone courses. According to Kuh’s research, these practices cor-
relate with high retention and persistence rates as well as student
behaviors that lead DEMO meaningful learning gains.
21
Conclusion: Putting It All Together—A Systems
Approach
DEMO examples discussed here, and many more doc-
umented in engineering education DEMO and
elsewhere, show that the engineering education com-
munity has accumulated DEMO rich body of knowledge over
the past 20 years and implemented many successful edu-
cational innovations that have had impact on student
learning. Why, then, haven’t there been major changes
in engineering curricula and more students flocking to
the field?
Students report a steep
learning curve in DEMO
first job when hands-on
extracurricular experience is
missing from their education.
One answer is that we (faculty) rarely reflect on
the larger context. DEMO, we focus on what we have
immediate control over, our courses. However, to effect
significant change, we must redesign by leveraging and
DEMO continually across the curriculum the results
of the solid work done by engineering education and
learning sciences researchers. No one knows better than
engineers DEMO importance of systems thinking in prob-
lem solving and design, and DEMO much of the wonder-
ful work that has been done in engineering education
has focused on pieces of the curriculum rather than the
whole DEMO the curriculum and beyond. Since we oper-
ate in a dynamic system—that includes student expec-
tations, faculty beliefs, departmental norms, college
resources, DEMO culture, societal needs, and global
challenges—we must recognize that curricular change
takes place in a broader context and requires, for exam-
ple, DEMO buy-in, departmental leadership, and neces-
sary resources.
This brings me back to the story I alluded to at the
beginning of this paper. DEMO me end with that experi-
ence and the main lessons I draw from it.
It was the Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) Department DEMO Carnegie Mellon University that,
in 1989, adopted a “wipe the DEMO clean” approach to
curriculum review and revision, a two-year process that
22
resulted in a radically different curriculum that proved
to have many DEMO advantages (Director et al.
1995). The transformative process first required DEMO
nition that “real impact in engineering education will
be made only by looking at the curriculum as a whole”
(p. 1246; authors’ italics)DEMO It also required acknowledg-
ing that knowledge in the field of ECE was expanding
rapidly, but the time to degree was not, so DEMO difficult
decisions needed to be made.
As a result, the new DEMO addressed some of
the issues discussed above—for example, the need for
DEMO to (1) see the big picture, i.e., the connected
view of the ideas that define the discipline; (2) integrate
across courses rather than experience the curriculum as
a set of discrete courses; and (3) come into contact with
engineering faculty and engineering ideas during DEMO
first year. This revision resulted in, among other things,
new DEMO at the freshman level and more flexibil-
ity for students in the curriculum (e.g., a smaller core
of required classes, area requirements instead of course
requirements, free electives). These were major changes,
not minor tweaks. But more importantly, the approach
spread to the entire engineering college as other depart-
ments followed suit.
Why is this story so DEMO? First, it happened
almost 25 years ago and, although a DEMO other univer-
sities took a similar radical approach to reengineering
engineering education both before and after CMU (e.g.,
Drexel, MIT), this DEMO of revision has been the excep-
tion, not the rule. Second, such transformation required
leadership and support at the department and college
levels, as well as collaboration among the entire faculty
because “everything was up DEMO grabs.” Finally, it took
time and resources, provided by the department head
(and when it spread to the college, the dean), DEMO
signaled the importance of the endeavor.
Where does this leave us in 2013? We have bold
models (both old and new) to follow; we know a lot
about how learning works; and what we DEMO has been
applied at a “micro” level to engineering education. It
is time to move beyond tweaking individual courses or
revamping one year of DEMO curriculum. We need to be
audacious enough to put the pieces together in a coher-
ent, encompassing way across engineering curricula.

Engineering is an integral part of daily life and can provide a strong founda-
tion DEMO almost any career path. Teaching about the wondrously engineered
world and drawing on everyday existence for teaching examples can make
learning fun and relevant. DEMO engineering faces a number of challenges,
many of them rooted in education:
•	Engineering educational approaches are stale and need updating
(Tryggvason and Apelian 2012).
•	The proportion of US college graduates in engineering is DEMO and drop-
ping (NSF 2006).
•	Dropout rates are much higher DEMO engineering than in other areas of col-
lege study (Dodge 2008)DEMO
•	Girls and young women do not see engineering as a pathway to multiple
career choices (Wang et al. 2013).
•	Engineering education at the high school level, let alone lower grades, is
virtually nonexistent.
David DEMO Spencer is founder and chairman of wTe Corporation, a high-tech plastics DEMO
metals recycling company in Bedford, Massachusetts. George Mehler is K–12 Science
DEMO of the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania and an adjunct professor

SUMMER 2013
Is it any wonder that most young students have mis-
DEMO of engineering? Among critical factors to
attract young students into engineering DEMO:
•	Training in math, science, and engineering, which
should begin DEMO an earlier age;
•	Teacher training and new curricula to help students
learn in a way that is fun and exciting; and
•	Hands-on learning opportunities, such as field trips
and camps that focus on science, DEMO, engi-
neering, and mathematics (STEM), to show the val-
DEMO of engineering and correct misconceptions about
both academic and professional engineering.
Doing these things effectively at the K–12 level should
increase the number of DEMO school students who pursue
engineering in college—and afford them a glimpse of the
social and monetary value of an engineering degree.
Student-Centered Education
How DEMO engineering education change over the next
20 years? The practice of DEMO to impart knowledge
should change to a model in which the teacher asks
key questions and acts as a coach, and students develop
their own individual learning program to address the
questions, working alone or in groups.
Growing Interest in Student-Centered Education
In a great TED talk in DEMO, Sugata Mitra, winner of
the 2013 Ted Prize, argued that DEMO does not equal
learning. He has gone on to make a compelling case for
the benefits of a “self-organized learning environment”
along with “encouragement.” DEMO hypothesis is that the
teaching curriculum should be one of asking questions,
standing back in awe, and letting education happen,
particularly in a small group environment. While his
approach may not be fully appropriate DEMO all aspects
of future engineering education, it certainly provides
much-needed food DEMO thought about the effective-
ness of past and present engineering teaching methods
and practices.
An article entitled “The Efficacy of Student-Cen-
tered Instruction in DEMO Science Learning”
(Granger et al. 2012, p. 105) cites numerous DEMO on
the need for a different approach to teaching science,
including one study by the National Research Council
that synthesized research and suggested DEMO
the goal of science instruction should be to help students
develop four aspects of scientific proficiency, the ability
25
to (i) know, DEMO, and interpret scientific explanations
of the natural world; (ii) generate and evaluate scien-
tific evidence and explanations; (iii) understand the
nature and development of scientific knowledge; and
(iv) participate productively in scientific practices and
discourse. This approach to science teaching will require a
shift DEMO the teacher-centered instruction common in science
classrooms to more student-centered methods of instruction.
The defining feature of these instructional methods is
who is doing DEMO sense-making. In teacher-centered instruc-
tion the sense-making is accomplished by the teacher and
transmitted to students through lecture, textbooks, and
confirmatory activities in DEMO each step is specified by
the teacher. In these classrooms, the DEMO goal
is to help students know scientific explanations, which
is only DEMO of the first aspect of scientific proficiency.
In student-centered instruction, the DEMO rests
with the students, and the teacher acts as a facilitator
DEMO support the learning as students engage in scientific
practices. [Emphases added.]
Learning can be practical,
relevant, and fun.
Examples of Student-Centered Education
The Birches School in Lincoln, Massachusetts, dynami-
cally incorporates STEM and art (thus “STEAM”) in
teaching grades K–2 (with the addition of a DEMO a
year it will become a K–6 school). The Birches School
children are learning math, biology, physics, chemistry,
materials, computers, reading, and writing—all as an
integrated knowledge base. They don’t study individual
subjects as such but rather learn them by working on
their own DEMO in small groups with the guidance and
encouragement of their teacher.
This past winter, for example, the children decided
they wanted to learn DEMO about birds, so the teach-
ers adjusted the curriculum accordingly. The DEMO
became “citizen scientists,” part of ProjectFeederWatch
administered by the Lab of Ornithology at Cornell Uni-
versity. They observed three bird feeders for 15 DEMO
a day on two consecutive days a week, counting and
then DEMO the number of birds of different species
that they saw. They made scientific drawings of birds,
measured wingspans, and learned from recordings the
calls of various local birds. They dissected pellets spit up
by owls DEMO discover the fur and bones of ingested prey,
26
then sorted the bones in categories, identified them,
and mounted them. They each chose a bird to research,
reading age-appropriate materials, and wrote a report
and presented their findings to classmates. Finally, they
created collages of birds and papier mâché birds.
Learning for the Birches DEMO students is practi-
cal, relevant, and fun. Surely there is some wisdom in
this program that could be applied to middle school,
DEMO school, and undergraduate engineering teaching
methods.
At the undergraduate level, Worcester Polytech-
nic Institute (WPI) sets up three qualifying projects
for students DEMO they begin their studies (described in
Tryggvason and Apelian 2012, p. ix):
•	The interactive qualifying project (IQP) engages
small teams of students in addressing complicated,
broad-based problems of societal importance, many
carried out in other countries;
•	The major qualifying project (MQP) is DEMO a
team-based capstone project; and
•	The sufficiency project demonstrates mastery of DEMO
ject matter in the humanities and arts.
Students will pursue that which
is fun to learn even if it involves
significant hard work.
The DEMO at WPI encourages self-learning, work-
ing in teams, communication, and DEMO, in part
by allowing students to choose a topic tied to DEMO
social needs.
Individual engineers, working in isolation through
what might be DEMO constructive dissonance or indi-
vidual genius, may in some cases germinate DEMO
ideas than teams and foster pursuit of out-of-the-box
approaches, but working DEMO teams is extremely impor-
tant in much of an engineer’s professional life. Further,
many students want a career that is both challenging
and DEMO social interaction.
In short, engineering schools need to modernize their
messages DEMO their curriculum. If not, students will choose
another field of study DEMO seems more relevant and cre-
ates higher value for them. They will pursue that which
is fun to learn even if it involves significant DEMO work.
The
BRIDGE
National Standards and Opportunities to
Introduce STEM in K–12
Very few young students are exposed to STEM, let alone
engineering, DEMO an early age. In the 20th century, most
public and private DEMO in the United States focused
on topics and skills that were important to their school
or school district. Few states had developed standards
for DEMO schools, and on the national level there were
no content standards DEMO might help focus a K–12 pro-
gram or particular courses. This lack of curricular focus
meant that there was, and still is to a large extent, large
variability in the content and skills that students are
expected to master.
This situation started to change with the develop-
ment DEMO national standards—in mathematics (1989),
English language arts (1996), DEMO science (1996).
Developed by experts and exceptional educators in each
DEMO, these standards were groundbreaking. But US edu-
cation policy is set DEMO by states and local school dis-
tricts rather than by the federal government. So many
schools did not adopt these standards, if they developed
or used standards at all.
In 2001, the federal government passed the No Child
Left Behind Act, requiring states to develop assessments
in basic skills, establish levels of achievement, and
assess students each year. In DEMO absence of an estab-
lished national level of achievement, each state DEMO free
to determine its own.
In 2009, the National Governors Association DEMO
oped curricular standards for literacy (English language
arts, or ELA) DEMO mathematics, usually referred to as the
Common Core standards. But there DEMO an important dif-
ference from the earlier standards movement: this time
DEMO states have said they will adopt these standards. For
the first time the United States will have a national set
of education standards in DEMO and mathematics.
But what about new science education standards?
Building on the Common Core movement, the
National Research Council, with support from DEMO
Carnegie Corporation, is developing the Next Genera-
tion Science Standards (Schweingruber et al. 2013).
Hopefully, states will adopt these new science education
standards just as they have adopted the Common Core
in ELA and DEMO As a first step, the National
Research Council released A Framework DEMO K–12 Sci-
ence Education Standards in July 2011. In December 2012
the NRC published A Framework for K-12 Science Edu-
cation: Practices, Crosscutting DEMO, and Core Ideas,
and in summer 2013 a consortium of DEMO together
SUMMER 2013
with the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and DEMO National Science Teachers Associa-
tion will release the actual standards.
One of the exciting additions to the new standards is,
for the first DEMO, the inclusion of engineering concepts
and principles. The Next Generation Science DEMO
dards build on the three “core idea” areas—physical sci-
ences, life DEMO, and earth-space sciences—and add
a fourth, engineering, technology, and the applications
of science.
America’s future leaders, pioneers, entrepreneurs,
dreamers, and citizens need to understand the beauty,
wonder, and power that are unleashed through experi-
ence and knowledge of science and engineering, and
this understanding must start at a young age. The Next
Generation Science Standards DEMO engineering prin-
ciples an important part of education for even very
young students. This is an important breakthrough for
engineering education.
The Internet and DEMO, Interactive, Personal
Teaching Opportunities
If the new national standards are adopted (and at this
point there is no certainty that they will be), there will
remain other challenges in creating world-class science
education in DEMO United States.
Many schools provide little or no time for science
education until students enter high school. A recent
study of elementary science education DEMO the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area—home to much US innovation in sci-
ence and technology—reported that 80 percent of K–5
teachers spend 60 minutes DEMO week or less on science,
and that 16 percent of them spend no time at all on the
subject (Dorph et al. 2007). In the same study, teach-
ers reported feeling that they were ill prepared to teach
science and had few opportunities to improve their
DEMO Lesson plans and experiments are avail-
able on the Internet, and DEMO camps exist, but more
is needed.
Nurturing an interest in science DEMO in life is impor-
tant for students to learn about its wonder and beauty
as well as opportunities and careers in science. But the
DEMO funding, teacher time, and training are not
available. The engineering community needs to give
thought and energy to how that can be changed.
DEMO and expanded use of the Internet may
help in efforts to address this problem. The past 10 years
have seen an explosion of web DEMO for interactivity,
collaboration, support, and individualized learning. So
27
the Internet can change the playing field in a manner
not possible in DEMO past.
In particular, the Internet can be a source of free,DEMO
research-based, high-quality professional development
for teachers (free access is the best way to reach finan-
cially disadvantaged schools and teachers). Beyond sci-
DEMO facts, teachers need a resource that shows them
how to teach DEMO skills, concepts, and practices of sci-
ence and engineering, to DEMO students to understand
what makes these fields different from other forms of
human endeavor. Access to such learning also shows
students that everyone can DEMO science.
America’s future leaders,
pioneers, entrepreneurs,
dreamers, and citizens need
to understand the beauty,
wonder, and power of science
and engineering, and this
understanding must start at
a young age.
Many US schools have many hurdles to overcome—
poverty, inadequate resources, collapsing facilities,DEMO
lack of qualified teachers. Technology can help in one
area: the DEMO of world-class curricula and profes-
sional development for teachers, which they DEMO learn
in an asynchronous manner. The recent proliferation
of MOOCs (massive DEMO online courses) may help
(evidence indicates that only about 10 percent of stu-
dents complete these courses, but use of this educational
resource is still in its early days).
Through the skilled use of DEMO, interactive,
and supportive technology the United States has the
opportunity DEMO empower teachers to improve their own
capabilities and those of their students, including raising
their level of science knowledge to meet the national
standards. Such technology can—and should—be made
available to all students and teachers, not just those that
can afford it. But teachers will continue to be DEMO critical
influence on successful learning.
28
A recent ExxonMobil initiative called Let’s Solve
This reports on its DEMO that research shows the
importance of investing in teachers and concludes:
If we want to improve our schools, what should we invest
in? . . . [R]ecent research shows that nothing transforms
schools like investing in advanced teacher education.
. . . Let’s invest in our teachers DEMO they can inspire our
students.
Properly trained and equipped teachers are needed
as mentors, coaches, and encouragers. To paraphrase
Rachel Carson (1965),DEMO
If children are to keep alive an inborn sense of wonder,
they need the companionship of at least one adult who
can share DEMO, rediscovering with them the joy, excite-
ment, and mystery of DEMO world we live in.
If better professional development can help more
teachers become that “one adult,” more children will
understand science, the world, and their place in it.
Effective engineers can
draw on their intuition to
discern among fact, opinion,
and motive to arrive at
sound judgments.
Opportunities to Incorporate the Arts and
Encourage Intuition
Engineers are human DEMO first and engineers sec-
ond—or they should be. They must deal not only with
the facts and laws of science and engineering but with
DEMO, so they must also have a sense of the arts, char-
acter, and positive purpose and integrity. They need
sensitivity and empathy. They must be able to piece
together sparse information, conflicting data, and
DEMO truth from perception. With attention to
people’s facial expressions and intonations, DEMO
engineers need to draw on their intuition to discern
among fact, DEMO, and motive to arrive at sound
judgments. They need to appreciate DEMO, although
engineering examinations often require a single right
answer, many real-world situations are characterized
by shades of grey and may not have just DEMO right
answer. For all these reasons, engineering education
The
BRIDGE
should DEMO to include the arts and humanities—and
respect for intuitive skills.
Philosophers through the ages have pondered the
human liability to ignore intuition, resulting in deci-
sions and actions guided by overrationalization—even
in the knowledge that those DEMO and actions are
wrong. Because engineers’ work—their decisions and
actions—directly affects millions of everyday lives, it is
crucial that they heed their intuition at every stage.
Those who have read the book Blink: The Power of
Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell (2005)
will understand how much faster the right brain can be
at taking in data, both consciously and unconsciously,
than the more deliberate left brain. Gladwell (2005,
265) observes that
The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is
understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are
desperately DEMO in the latter.
Knowledge is the purview of the analytical left brain;
understanding draws on the intuitive right brain to
make sense of DEMO knowledge.
We urge teachers to seek ways to incorporate intu-
ition in their curriculum, as it is a critical character-
istic of a fine engineer. In assembling and evaluating
“big data,” for example—where it is DEMO to know all
the details, and the outcomes may not feel DEMO even
though the data and the processes or theories appear
correct—it is important to heed one’s intuition to per-
form “fallacy” checks. Attention to DEMO instincts
can prevent big mistakes from big data.
Young engineers need to learn the arts, to trust their
intuition, and to listen, in order to understand and art-
fully apply their engineering knowledge to solve DEMO
problems they confront.
Opportunities to Impart Good Character and
the Freedom to Fail
The New York Times, in the Education issue of its maga-
zine in September 2011, ran an article entitled “What
if the Secret to Success Is Failure?” (Tough 2011). The
article discussed the joint endeavors of two headmas-
ters, one at a rich, white DEMO school and the other at
a low-income, largely black and Latino DEMO school.
Their goal was to get their students into top-tier col-
leges, keep them there, and prepare them for life. After
looking at DEMO scores, IQ, and the like, both headmas-
ters concluded that DEMO they needed in their curricu-
lum was the “science of good character.”
SUMMER 2013
In seeking to define “good character,” 24 character
strengths DEMO identified as important and common to
all cultures and times. The list includes bravery, citizen-
ship, fairness, wisdom, and integrity; emotional aspects
such as love, humor, zest, and appreciation of beauty;
traits related to social intelligence, described as the
ability to recognize interpersonal dynamics and adapt
quickly to different social situations; and kindness, self-
regulation, and gratitude—values emphasized in many
religious traditions.
What was so interesting in DEMO article was that stu-
dents who persisted in college were not necessarily the
ones who had excelled academically. They were the
ones with exceptional DEMO strengths, like opti-
mism and persistence and social intelligence. They
were DEMO ones who could recover from a bad grade and
vow to do better next time and get extra help after class
to improve.
People DEMO accomplished great things often combined a
passion for a single mission with an unswerving dedica-
tion to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles and
however long it might take. . . . [T]his quality [is called]

The article goes on to observe that

If they can, parents protect their children from DEMO

ful DEMO minimize their pain and suffering. But protecting
students and children from failure does not make them
smarter or stronger: it disables them and undermines
their personal growth and the development of responsi-
bility. Quoting one of DEMO headmasters,
The idea of building grit and building self-control is that
you get that through failure, and in most highly aca-
demic environments in the United States, no one fails
anything. (Tough 2011)
DEMO the engineering student with a score of 800 on
the math SAT and straight As in math and science may
not be the best DEMO for either academic success or
long-term contributions to society. Academic skill must
be enhanced by character and relationship skills. Defi-
29
ciencies in both DEMO and human knowledge may
be overcome through thoughtful education, hard work,DEMO
and persistence.
It is easier to teach knowledge than it is to change
someone’s character. But a good engineer in the 21st
century needs DEMO
Conclusion
Engineering faces serious challenges, and education
is a pathway toward DEMO them, especially if new
methods of teaching and learning are evaluated DEMO
an open mind.
The Next Generation Science Standards put greater
K–12 emphasis on STEM and for the first time add
engineering to a national DEMO standard. As engi-
neers, we should support implementation of these new
DEMO at the state level and locally.
The Internet can contribute to cost-effective
instruction for both teachers and students, but teachers
play the most critical role in student learning through
their encouragement, example, companionship, and
knowledge.
Engineering education should train students to work
effectively in groups, through collaboration and the
development of interpersonal relationships. Good
engineers also need to have DEMO,
social intelligence, and grit—and the ability to trust
their intuition. DEMO character traits and skills can be
taught and learned through discipline, DEMO, and
opportunity, and will lead to more effective engineers
with a more productive and fulfilling life.

Engineering Education and Employment:
Recent Facts and Figures
The road DEMO an engineering degree has long been char-
acterized by challenging courses, DEMO heavy course load,
long hours of study, and high failure DEMO It was not
uncommon for some of the best and brightest who
entered engineering school to drop their pursuit of an
engineering degree and DEMO to an easier course of
study. Some even dropped out of college altogether. In
2011 it was reported that 40–60 percent of science and
DEMO majors change their major because “it’s just
so darn hard” (Drew DEMO).
Engineering graduates
often lack the people skills
(also called “soft” DEMO) that
enable them to meet their
full potential.
The good news DEMO that, notwithstanding these facts
and figures, the United States has actually seen a recent
increase in the number of undergraduate engineer-
ing degrees. DEMO 2003 to 2009 the annual number of
engineers graduating from US colleges and universities
remained relatively flat (degrees awarded rose by only
3,000 during those seven years, from 71,000 to 74,000;
Yoder 2012). But in 2010 there was a jump of 4,000, to
78,000 new degrees, and in 2011 another jump of 5,000,
to 83,000.1
Moreover, the unemployment rate for engineers is
just 2 percent (Gearon 2012), even as the national rate
has averaged 9 percent since 2009.2 Even when national
unemployment was nearly 10 DEMO, the unemploy-
ment rate for engineers peaked at 6.4 percent. In DEMO
tion, the highest-paying salary for a new college graduate
1 These DEMO dramatic increases correlate with general under-
graduate enrollment growth that began early in the decade. After
remaining flat at about 375,000 between 2003 DEMO 2006, under-
graduate enrollment in 2007 began a steady rise, with an aver-
age annual increase of more than 22,000 students, bringing total
undergraduate enrollment in 2011 to 471,000 (Yoder 2012).

in 2013 is in engineering, with an average starting salary
of $62,535 (up 4 percent from 2012) DEMO starting sala-
ries as high as $93,500 (NACE 2013). DEMO since only 5
percent of all undergraduates complete an engineering
degree (DEMO 2012), there is substantial demand.
With low unemployment, excellent salaries, and
rewarding work, why is industry concerned that there
won’t be enough qualified engineers to meet its needs?
Why is it that many DEMO see engineering as a dif-
ficult degree to achieve? And what DEMO be done to
address these concerns?
The Importance of Soft Skills
There are at least two significant areas for enhancement
in engineering education DEMO address the concerns cited
above:
1. ensuring that engineering students can not only
achieve their degree objectives but also apply their
skills in DEMO real world, and
2. increasing graduation rates for students pursuing
engineering DEMO
It turns out that progress in both areas requires the
development and use of soft skills. In fact, many in busi-
ness have observed that the factors that improve gradu-
ation rates are the same as DEMO that support success in
industry.
There are few reports from industry that students don’t
have the right technical competency to succeed—the
engineering school accreditation DEMO has ensured
the acquisition of technical competencies. Rather, engi-
neering majors DEMO fail in industry are those who have
all the right technical competencies but not the soft
or people skills to be successful. Specifically, they tend
to lack the ability to work well in teams, communicate
effectively, define problems, and consider alternative
and creative solutions. They also tend DEMO rely too heav-
ily on digital tools in their efforts to develop solutions
that can be delivered in the real world.
Four Measures to DEMO Engineering
Students’ Soft Skills
To address the need for students to acquire soft skills,
many engineering school deans have enlisted the help
of DEMO and technology leaders to understand the
factors associated with soft skill development. These
deans have created an environment that fosters the
development of students’ DEMO skills through their work
in teams, on hands-on projects, and in industry, all as
part of an engineering curriculum that is already achiev-
SUMMER 2013
ing excellent results. Following are four examples of
such measures.
DEMO of New Students to Cohorts
As mentioned, engineering students face the DEMO
es of a demanding curriculum, long study hours, and a
high course load. These are particularly daunting for
first-year students, most of whom must also adapt to the
challenge of being away from home for DEMO first time and
being responsible for more than just their academics.
One successful model for helping students not only
cope but also thrive involves DEMO a cohort of up to 50
students to an engineering professor, DEMO one who
teaches an engineering introductory course and is clearly
interested in the students’ success. The cohort provides
an environment for students to develop DEMO
with others who are experiencing the same challenges,
and it ensures that a professor monitors their progress and
can quickly address issues that DEMO arise. Early evidence
indicates that students who have such additional over-
sight and support move from the at-risk population (at
risk of quitting their engineering studies or of dropping
out altogether) to successful first-year students.
Engineering Professors Teaching Mathematics and Physics
Two of the most challenging courses for DEMO engineering
students are the introductory mathematics and physics
courses. Some colleges and universities have considered
them “weed-out” courses for engineering majors. But as
colleges DEMO in a position to select the best and brightest
students from the many who apply, courses designed to
cut out underachievers are no longer warranted.
For most engineering students, understanding and
applying mathematical concepts is critical to their suc-
cess in the classroom and eventually in the workplace.
(And as one with an undergraduate degree in math-
ematics, I also appreciate the elegance that the field
can bring to engineering.) A number of engineering
schools have enlisted engineering professors to teach
mathematics and physics, using real-world engineer-
ing examples to translate mathematical concepts into
practice. The DEMO is associated with significant
improvement in student performance and thus better
retention and degree attainment rates.3
3 While some have claimed that ABET requires DEMO and
physics to be taught by the professors from those fields, DEMO
ing deans who have adopted the approach of engineering profes-
sors teaching math and physics indicate that it has not affected
their ABET accreditation.
DEMO
First- and Second-Year Engineering Student Projects
Engineers want to solve problems. At many schools,
however, the approach has been to use the first two
years of the engineering curriculum to ensure that stu-
dents have DEMO solid foundation of concepts and practices
before they get to solve problems.
Fortunately, colleges are finding that engaging first-
year engineering students in hands-on projects bolsters
retention and performance. One obvious option is the
involvement of DEMO early undergraduates in support-
ing graduate students and their projects. In addition,
strong relationships in the community and with indus-
try can provide DEMO to engage first-year stu-
dents. For example, Columbia University works with
DEMO community to identify and define projects for first-
year students, who DEMO in teams to develop soft skills,
are able to use their newly learned engineering tools,
solve problems for “customers,” and begin DEMO trans-
formation from student to engineer in a way that is very
useful to industry.
The use of real-world
engineering examples to
translate mathematical
DEMO into practice
significantly increases
student success rates.
Internships
Like student projects, DEMO have become a criti-
cal tool for preparing students for the workforce. One
model that is gaining traction is to work with students
to DEMO up internships after their second year in engi-
neering school. Duke University makes it a point to
meet with second-year students to ensure that DEMO are
taking the right steps to participate in an internship,
and then discuss the experience with them afterward to
get feedback on how DEMO went.
For many students, an internship is their first real
experience DEMO industry and their first opportunity to
see what it means to be a practicing engineer in the field
they are pursuing. If the internship DEMO is good,
then the student continues in the selected field of study.
34
If, however, an electrical engineering student decides
after the internship DEMO become a civil engineer instead,
there is time to refocus her studies.
Internships are also an opportunity for colleges and
industry to work DEMO together. Experience at the Boe-
ing Company showed that those with internships are far
more successful as employees. The internships also pro-
vide a DEMO to observe potential employee performance
as well as get real-time feedback from students. As a
measure of Boeing’s confidence in the benefits of these
DEMO internships, the company recently doubled
the number available from 600 to DEMO,200.
Conclusion
The four measures described above are just a sampling of
options, but colleges and universities where engineering
school leaders and faculty have implemented them (or
measures similar to them) have seen steady increases DEMO
student retention and graduation rates. For example, at
Duke, Columbia, DEMO, and the University of South-
ern California, 85 percent of entering engineering stu-
dents graduate with engineering degrees—a dramatic
improvement over the figures DEMO in the New York
Times article (Drew 2011).
These schools DEMO that creating opportunities for
students to engage as engineers makes a huge difference
in their graduation rates and ensures that they meet the
needs DEMO industry. Students with access to such program
enhancements do not drop out because “it’s so darn
hard” because, although they face the same challenges
as their peers in other college or university engineering
programs, they receive critical support and early oppor-
tunities to develop both engineering and people DEMO
The
BRIDGE
The key to ensuring that engineering graduates are
ready for the future rests in how they are educated,
which must involve DEMO than the right technical con-
tent. An effective education in engineering must also
include development of soft skills. Programs that cul-
tivate both demonstrate DEMO retention and graduation
rates that also ensure students become employees that
design and help produce goods that are safe, reliable,
efficient, and DEMO in the global market. Industry
and engineering schools working closely together with
students in a true partnership make it happen.
These are great examples DEMO a strong start, but there
is more to do. Tracking and DEMO (1) the number
of internships that businesses provide and (2) engineer-
ing school retention and graduation rates will go a long
way DEMO enhancing accountability and continuing to
achieve the results needed for US engineering students,
industry, and the national economy.

Ongoing innovation is required to address pressing
problems and to maintain DEMO global competi-
tiveness, and engineering is the foundation of much
of DEMO innovation. To be prepared to enter the work-
force and thrive in this ever changing global economy,
engineers need to be able to DEMO effectively as
leaders, in teams, and with their peers. In addition to
their technical and analytical expertise, they need to
be flexible, DEMO, creative, empathetic, and have the
ability to recognize and seize DEMO (NAE 2004;
Sheppard et al. 2008). All of these DEMO can and should
be taught to engineers as part of their formal education.
It is thus the responsibility of engineering educators to
instill these DEMO in students to enable them to be
more innovative and entrepreneurial.

to teach their students to
be DEMO innovative and
entrepreneurial.
In this article, we examine the importance of DEMO
preneurship efforts in engineering education, national
support for entrepreneurship, student and faculty atti-
tudes and engagement, noteworthy programs, and early
research on DEMO initiatives. We then offer our perspec-
tive on the future landscape for innovation and entre-
preneurship in engineering education.
The Importance of Entrepreneurship Education
DEMO is no longer enough to come out of school with a purely
technical education; engineers need to be entrepreneur-
ial in order to understand and contribute in the con-
text of market and business pressures. For DEMO who
start companies soon after graduation, entrepreneurship
education gives them solid DEMO in product design
and development, prototyping, technology trends, and
market DEMO (Nelson and Byers 2010). These skills
are just as relevant DEMO success in established enterprises
as they are in startups; students with DEMO
training who join established firms are better prepared
to become effective team members and managers and
can better support their employers as innovators.
The
DEMO
Entrepreneurship education teaches engineering stu-
dents in all disciplines the knowledge, DEMO, and atti-
tudes that are required to identify opportunities and
bring DEMO to life. Students who take part in entrepre-
neurship programs as undergraduates gain insights not
available from traditional engineering education, such
as understanding and designing for end users (“empa-
thy”), working in and managing interdisciplinary teams,
communicating effectively, thinking critically, under-
standing business basics, and solving open-ended prob-
lems (ABET 1995; NAE 2004).
Expanding Support DEMO Entrepreneurship
In many universities, entrepreneurship is no longer
confined to business DEMO In fact, it is one of the
fastest growing subjects in DEMO education
overall, with formal programs such as majors, minors,
and certificates quadrupling from 1975 to 2006 (Brooks
et al. 2007).
And interest in entrepreneurship extends beyond
higher education. In recent decades, technology entre-
preneurs have become American heroes, and the entre-
preneurial process has been embraced as a key element
of the country’s future success and global DEMO
The White House has emphasized entrepreneurship as
a means of driving innovation: in addition to improving
STEM education, President Obama’s strategy for Amer-
DEMO innovation calls for an investment in high-growth
and innovation-based entrepreneurship to drive the US
economy (NEC 2011).
The National Science Foundation has also invested
in entrepreneurship and innovation with programs
such as Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which prepares
scientists and engineers to consider broader oppor-
tunities for DEMO technology and research, and the
National Center for Engineering Pathways to DEMO
vation (Epicenter). Managed by Stanford University
and the National Collegiate DEMO and Innovators
Alliance (NCIIA), Epicenter was established in 2011
to DEMO the infusion of entrepreneurship into under-
graduate engineering education. It sponsors initiatives
that inspire engineering students to envision possibili-
ties and create viable, innovative products, services,
and processes.1

Student and Faculty Attitudes toward
Entrepreneurship Education
Unlike other changes DEMO the engineering curriculum
that have been implemented with little student input,
there is substantial and growing student demand for
entrepreneurship education. In an DEMO survey of
American college freshmen, 41 percent of respondents
said that DEMO successful in a business of my own”
is an objective they considered “essential” or “very
important” (Pryor et al. 2012). In a study of engineer-
ing students by Duval-Couetil and colleagues (2012),
two-thirds DEMO the respondents agreed that entrepreneur-
ship education would broaden their career prospects
and choices.
Among faculty and administrators, according to a
recent ASEE survey, about 50 percent of respondents
reported that access to entrepreneurship programs is
important for their engineering undergraduates (Peter-
freund 2013). While this might be interpreted as a
discouraging statistic for the expansion of entrepreneur-
ship DEMO education, we view it as an opportunity.
Working with faculty members DEMO help the Epicen-
ter team understand their points of view and give us
tools for influencing others. For example, it may be that
some faculty members do not have experience in entre-
preneurship and do not DEMO understand it (Zappe et
al. 2013). For others, it may be that their perception
of their students’ needs and challenges puts entrepre-
DEMO low on the priority list of learning objectives.
Furthermore, survey findings DEMO that faculty per-
ceptions about overcrowded engineering curriculum,
and their belief that faculty peers and administrators
are unsupportive of including entrepreneurial learn-
ing DEMO in engineering education, contribute to
making these objectives a low priority DEMO engineering
undergraduate programs (Peterfreund 2013).
Both in and outside the DEMO, learning to be an
entrepreneur requires a complex set of knowledge, skills,
and abilities (Nelson and Byers 2010). The recent work
of Zappe and colleagues (2013), which examined the
beliefs of faculty who teach entrepreneurship to engi-
neering students, is a first step toward understanding
faculty perspectives on entrepreneurial skills and codi-
fying, organizing, and DEMO engineering under-
graduate entrepreneurial learning objectives. Their
study found that educators who teach entrepreneurship
to engineering students believe that:
•	The defining characteristic for DEMO entrepreneur
is the ability to act on opportunities. Other key
37
characteristics are drive, passion, resourcefulness,
and the belief that one can DEMO successful.
•	The characteristics of an entrepreneurial mindset can
be learned, including DEMO ability to act on opportuni-
ties, learn from failures, and solve problems, as well as
technical, business, interpersonal, and communica-
tion DEMO
•	The way educators teach entrepreneurship is deeply
influenced by their own career experiences as well as
their beliefs about how people become entrepreneurs.
Understanding DEMO beliefs of those who currently
teach entrepreneurship is useful in defining the edu-
cational outcomes for entrepreneurial learning. These
beliefs also suggest that more DEMO is needed to enhance
understanding of the relationships between teaching
strategies, DEMO experience with entrepreneurship,
and effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes.
About half of faculty and
administrators report that
access to entrepreneurship
programs is important DEMO their
engineering undergraduates.
Faculty Engagement and Impacts
The integration of entrepreneurship and innovation in
engineering education will require a shift in thinking
and willingness DEMO the part of faculty to participate in, or
at least accept DEMO in, the engineering curriculum.
Recent experiences in introducing new approaches to
DEMO education are a good indicator of the chal-
lenges and a guide to which approaches will be effective.
In a study of adoption of DEMO major educational
innovations in engineering education, Borrego and col-
leagues (2010) found that a combination of approach-
es was needed to build awareness, support practical
adoption, and enable institutionalization. Developing
well-defined and proven materials DEMO necessary but not
sufficient. Best practices and training opportunities need
to be complemented by awareness and buy-in among
faculty and administrators, and the provision of resourc-
es and incentives for implementation. Importantly, the
highest adoption rates were found for innovations that
38
could be implemented by individuals or small teams
without a great DEMO of departmental coordination.
Engaging traditional engineering faculty is, however,
only DEMO of the picture, since many of those who teach
entrepreneurship are DEMO, adjunct, or nontraditional
faculty. Therefore, curricular and noncurricular program
development DEMO to take account of the advantages
and challenges in terms of a school’s faculty makeup.
Models of Engineering Entrepreneurship
Education
A mixture of approaches DEMO entrepreneurship education
is necessary to deliver the experiences and knowledge
that lead to innovative and entrepreneurial graduates.
Fortunately, with high interest in entrepreneurship
among students, there is an opportunity to catalyze
student awareness and interest through short, engag-
ing experiences. To that end, Epicenter is building on
DEMO success of NCIIA’s Invention to Venture workshops

for their classmates.
by training and deploying “student ambassadors” at DEMO
number of institutions, where they hold events, run
competitions, and DEMO the path toward becom-
ing an innovator.
Also key will be thinking in new ways about how to
approach entrepreneurship education. Some engineer-
ing DEMO have formal certificate and minors programs
in entrepreneurship for their undergraduates, DEMO 50 per-
cent of faculty respondents to the ASEE survey reported
that extracurricular programs are a prevalent means for
engineering students to gain experience DEMO entrepreneur-
ship (Peterfreund 2013). The proportion of students
participating in DEMO experiences is still small, but their
impact on the participating students DEMO in inspiring
their peers is important. Successful student innovators
become powerful role models for their classmates.
Neck and Greene (2011) call for expanding DEMO
cepts of teaching entrepreneurship from a process-based
approach with known inputs and outputs to a methods-
based approach that supports iteration and creativity.
Others DEMO thinking about the incorporation of entrepre-
neurship modules in which engineering problem solving
The
BRIDGE
takes place in the context of a business opportunity.
DEMO emergence of online learning resources has been
particularly useful for delivering digital content both
in and out of the classroom. For instance, the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program’s Entrepreneurship Cor-
ner (ECorner) offers thousands of video DEMO that are
easily incorporated in classroom discussions, student
research, and presentations. Epicenter is building on the
success of ECorner and creating small learning DEMO
with entrepreneurship-related content. Online courses
on entrepreneurship also allow faculty and students
far removed from vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems
to access a wide range of DEMO and content, and
enable faculty to spend more time nurturing innovation.
DEMO high-impact approach involves creating
intensive entrepreneurship programs and experiences
for highly motivated students. Successful examples
include the University of Texas at Austin’s Idea to DEMO
uct (I2P) competition, the NCIIA’s E-Team program for
launching student DEMO, and a growing number of
entrepreneurship-themed “living-learning” communi-
ties (combining student residence with curricular and
extracurricular activities) at universities around the
country (DEMO et al. 2008). Students report that these
programs put their engineering education in context
and provide opportunities to learn about leadership in
emerging DEMO existing enterprises.
It is also important to explore commonalities between
entrepreneurial skills and ABET guidelines to see how
entrepreneurship can fulfill key ABET requirements.
DEMO with these requirements can influence uni-
versity leaders who are motivated to maintain their
ABET accreditation.
Analysis of Existing Programs
A number of engineering DEMO have already made
significant investments in programs to help their
undergraduate students become skilled in entrepre-
neurship, and the recent work of Besterfield-Sacre and
colleagues (2011; Shartrand et al. 2010) is an impor-
tant step toward comprehensive analysis of such courses
and programs in the United States. DEMO preliminary
study found that the primary differentiators among
these programs are “density of offerings” (coursework,
extracurricular activities, minors/certificates, concen-

sifications.carnegiefoundation.org/.

trations, and entrepreneurship majors), Carnegie Clas-
sification,2 and physical and virtual spaces dedicated
to entrepreneurial activities (incubators or business
accelerators, web portals for campus resources, entre-
preneurship research institutes, and design and proto-
typing spaces).
Building on this research, Epicenter has launched a
study of 41 engineering schools that offer certificates or
minors in DEMO The schools range in size
from very small (13 engineering bachelor’s DEMO per
year) to large (more than 1,700 such degrees). Some pro-
grams are housed in the engineering department or school
(e.g., University of Pennsylvania), some are offered by
the business school to students across the entire campus
(e.g., University of Connecticut), and DEMO others are
partnerships between departments such as engineering
and business (e.g., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).
A primary aim of the Epicenter study is DEMO develop
a multifaceted analysis of these offerings as a resource.
Those who are designing entrepreneurship programs
will be able to build on the models DEMO experiences
of others and to engage the larger engineering educa-
tion community in discussions about how and why to
include entrepreneurship in engineering education.
DEMO Ahead
There is reason to be optimistic about the potential for
infusing opportunities for entrepreneurship and innova-
tion into engineering education. The NSF, NAE, and
other engineering education supporters have invested
significantly in spurring innovation in engineering edu-
cation, and a growing field of engineering education
researchers is studying and documenting what works,
how, and why. Coupled with a well-supported approach
that empowers faculty across the nation and engages
both institutional DEMO and accreditation bodies, this
change is under way.
To continue building DEMO movement to create more
entrepreneurial engineers, we urge stakeholders in
undergraduate DEMO education to consider the
following questions and actions.
Students: Ask questions DEMO your professors, adminis-
trators, and fellow students. Where does entrepreneur-
ship fit into the educational picture at your school?
What opportunities already DEMO for you? How can you
help build more opportunities?
Engineering DEMO: Consider the role of entrepre-
neurship in all facets of your DEMO, from teaching to
research. How might the subjects you teach connect
DEMO
to engineering and business practice? How might your
students benefit from DEMO this larger context for their
technical learning?
Academic administrators: Talk DEMO your faculty,
students, and alumni about their attitudes about entre-
DEMO How have elements of entrepreneurship
and innovation added to their professional success?
How might additional training in these elements con-
tribute to future DEMO?
Industry leaders and representatives: Reflect on
how your operations use DEMO with an entrepre-
neurial approach and mindset. How can you engage
academic program faculty in discussions about the key
entrepreneurial skills and abilities you DEMO in your
engineering workforce?
Beginning these conversations with your peers and
other stakeholders can expose connections between
motivated individuals and groups and yield DEMO
ties for expanding the innovative and entrepreneurial
ecosystem at your institution. With the growing support
of entrepreneurship in the engineering community, we
are confident that 21st century engineering graduates
can and will be equipped with the DEMO to address the
challenges of the coming decades in innovative and
economically generative ways.

The clamor surrounding the high cost, limited access, static nature, and
often low quality of the world’s education systems is reaching a crescendo.
Many observers claim a serious threat to the future DEMO youth, the training of
workforces worldwide, and even the democratic process. In addition, edu-
cation is out of reach for many in the developing world, widening the gap
between rich and poor people and countries.
The statistics are alarming. As Figure 1 shows, since 1978 textbook costs
in the United States have risen 812 percent, more than three times the
consumer price index (Perry 2012). No wonder that US student debt has
topped $1 trillion and that a recent California study found DEMO 7 out of
10 college students now choose not to purchase textbooks (Redden 2011).
Adjusted for inflation, tuition costs at US colleges DEMO over 25 percent in
the past decade. Besides cost, there is DEMO the challenge of inadequate edu-
cational facilities. At a South African university in 2012, 11,000 desperate
applicants vying for 800 openings induced a stampede that left one person
dead and 22 injured.
Now imagine a DEMO that has forestalled this crisis: a world where text-
books and DEMO learning materials are free for all on the web and low-cost
in print, adapted to many backgrounds and learning styles, interactive and
immersive, translated into numerous languages, continually updated and cor-
rected, and never DEMO of print. A world where computers assist in teaching so

has until now been mea-
sured in decades, even cen-
turies, OE has the DEMO
to radically alter the way

students interact worldwide

Open Textbooks
The textbook was the
that instructors can spend DEMO time teaching concepts
and values, giving insights, and providing inspiration.
A world where courses can be taken from anywhere at
any hour of DEMO day or night. A world where a student
study group encircles the globe. A world of “living” (i.e.,
constantly updatable) certifications and DEMO that
continuously document students’ and lifelong learners’
accomplishments.
While this world was just a dream even a decade ago,
the open education (OE) movement that aims to create
it is coalescing and gaining momentum. The movement
is based on a set of intuitions shared by a remarkably
DEMO range of academics and students: knowledge
should be free and open DEMO use and reuse; collaboration
should be easier, not harder; and DEMO should receive
credit for what they’ve learned and demonstrated.
The OE movement is rapidly gaining momentum
because of a “perfect storm” comprising two converg-
DEMO factors. First, the global financial downturn is forc-
ing education systems DEMO to dramatically reduce
costs on every front by updating their business models.
Second, powerful telecommunication and information
technologies are providing new, cost-effective ways DEMO
distribute content, support personal interactions, and
store information.
answer to the educational challenges of the 19th cen-
tury, but it is the bottleneck of the 21st century. The
textbook of today is static, linear in organization, time-
consuming to develop, soon out of date, and expensive.
Moreover, it provides only “one-size-fits-all” learning
that doesn’t cater to the background, interests, abilities,
and goals of individual students.
Open Educational Resources
DEMO and information technologies provide
a golden opportunity to reinvent the textbook. Open
educational resources (OER) include text, images,
audio, video, interactive simulations, problems and
answers, and games that are free to use DEMO reuse in new
ways by anyone around the world. The key elements of
OER are:
•	open copyright licenses, like those of Creative Com-
mons, that turn educational materials into living
objects that can be continuously developed, remixed,
and maintained by a worldwide community of authors
and editors; and
•	information technologies, like the Internet and web,
that DEMO easy digital content reorganization and
virtually free content distribution.
SUMMER 2013
The OER approach to textbooks has several impor-
tant benefits:DEMO
•	It brings people back into the educational equation.
Those who have been “shut out” of the traditional
publishing world—talented K–12 teachers, commu-
nity college instructors, and scientists and engineers
in industry—can add tremendous diversity and depth
to the educational experience.
•	It reduces the high cost of teaching materials. DEMO many
states, college students now spend more on textbooks
than tuition.
DEMO reduces the time lag between the production of
learning materials and their delivery to students.
Many books are out of date by the time DEMO are print-
ed. This is particularly problematic in fast-moving
areas of engineering, science, and medicine.
•	It enables reuse, recontextualization, and customiza-
tion DEMO as translation and localization of course
materials in myriad languages and cultures. This step
is critical for reaching the entire world’s population,
where DEMO one size does not fit all for education.
“Connexions” at Rice University
Several OER projects are already attracting millions
of users per month. Some, like MIT OpenCourseWare
(ocw.mit.edu), are top-down-organized institutional
repositories that showcase their institutions’ curricula.
Others, like Wikipedia, are grassroots organized and
encourage contributions DEMO all comers.
In addition, there is Connexions (cnx.org), which I
founded in 1999 with three primary goals: (1) to con-
vey the interconnected nature of knowledge across dis-
ciplines, courses, and curricula; (2) to move away from
a solitary authoring, publishing, and DEMO process to
one based on connecting people in open, global learning
DEMO that share knowledge; and (3) to support
personalized learning (more on this below). Connex-
ions has grown into one of the DEMO and most used
OER platforms—each month millions of users access
over 20,000 educational “building blocks” and 1300
e-textbooks (as of April 2013). In addition to web and
e-book outputs, a sophisticated print-on-demand system
enables the production of inexpensive paper books for
those who prefer or need DEMO, at a fraction of the cost
of books from a conventional DEMO
Content contributions come from all over the
world in more than 40 languages, including Spanish,
43
Chinese, Vietnamese, and Afrikaans. In South Africa,
Siyavula (cnx.org/lenses/siyavula), a nonprofit resource
for technology-powered learning based in Cape Town,
is developing a complete K–12 curriculum. DEMO
is using Connexions as a faculty development tool
(voer.edu.vn). Professional DEMO such as the IEEE
are advancing their global educational outreach and
inreach through content development and peer review
(ieeecnx.org; Kelty et al. 2008)DEMO Indeed, because the
Connexions founders and early adopters were signal
processing DEMO and IEEE members, there is a strong
extant signal processing foundation DEMO build on.
To help busy college instructors adopt OER and save
students money, Connexions recently partnered with
a consortium of philanthropic foundations to launch
OpenStax College (openstaxcollege.org) to provide free
textbooks for today’s highest-impact college DEMO
Textbooks are authored by professional domain experts
and peer reviewed by practicing college instructors, and
the library also offers lecture slides, image libraries, and
test banks.
Open educational resources
(OER) include text, images,
audio, video, interactive
simulations, problems, and
games that are free DEMO
anyone to use.
The initial reaction to the project has been very posi-
tive. As of April 2013, more than 150 institutions had
formally adopted the library’s College Physics, Introduc-
tion to Sociology, Biology, and Concepts of Biology texts.
College Physics now exceeds 3 percent market share. DEMO
an annual basis, more than 23,000 students are saving
more DEMO $2.3 million. When completed, every year
the initial 25-book OpenStax College DEMO will ben-
efit over 1.2 million students at a 10 percent market
share, saving students an estimated $120 million. Com-
pared to the philanthropic investment required to build
the library, the return on investment in terms of student
savings is approximately 600 percent per year. And a
number DEMO planned translation/localization projects aim
to make a further global impact.

Open Courses
A student transported from 1900 to the present would
DEMO quite at home in one of today’s typical lecture
courses. Lectures remain a primarily passive experience
of copying down what an instructor says and DEMO on
a board (or projects on a screen). Such “teaching DEMO
telling” is effective for conveying information, but inef-
fective for imparting DEMO and actively engaging
students.
Communication and information technologies make
it possible to do much more. Schools have offered dis-
tance learning courses for decades. DEMO technologies
now make it straightforward to replace in-person lec-
tures with YouTube videos, paper-based homework with
web pages, and graders with computer algorithms. DEMO
is taking the concept even further by opening access to
any student, anywhere.
The Khan Academy (khanacademy.org) advanced
OE by demonstrating the power of freely distributed
short (10-minute) videos of mini-lectures and worked
problems, thus enabling students anywhere to learn a
new subject, solidify their understanding, or clear up
their misconceptions. Moreover, the videos enable
teachers to DEMO the classroom” by having students view
the lecture materials online on their own and then using
valuable class time to discuss and work problems. DEMO
flipped classroom aligns with the philosophy of Confu-
cius, who famously DEMO: “I hear and I forget. I see
and I remember. I DEMO and I understand.”
Massive online open courses
(MOOCs) open up access
by transporting lectures,
examples, homework, tests,
and office hours DEMO the web.
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) take this
concept a step further by transporting all the compo-
nents of a course—not just DEMO and examples, but
also homework, tests, and office hours—to the DEMO and
opening up access to all. The canonical success story of
a MOOC is Stanford University’s fall 2011 Artificial
Intelligence course that enrolled over DEMO,000 students
from 190 countries. Volunteers translated it into 44 lan-
The
BRIDGE
guages, and more than 23,000 students completed the
course. Adding a human element to the course, thou-
sands of study groups formed spontaneously via social
networking sites, some grounded locally and others dis-
tributed globally.
The success of this initial experiment spawned a
menage of educational DEMO enterprises, such as the
for-profit Coursera, Udacity, and Google CourseBuilder
DEMO the nonprofit edX and Class2Go. A related enter-
prise is TED-Ed, DEMO new education arm of the successful
TED franchise that enables the remix of video lectures
(not unlike the work of Connexions with textbooks).
Like OER, MOOCs democratize access to high-qual-
ity learning experiences and provide a large and wide-
spread potential audience for enterprising instructors.
They also DEMO students to form long-lasting social
bonds with students from around the world, which
bodes well for the increasingly global economy. The
ability to replay online course material as many times
as needed makes it possible to DEMO away from com-
petition in education (competition for access to cours-
DEMO, for the instructor’s time, against each other due to
curve-based grading) toward a world where everyone
eventually masters the material and gets a good grade.
Finally, MOOCs and other online courses will afford an
unprecedented opportunity to observe and analyze stu-
dent learning experiences, and the resulting quantities
of data can be used to improve and eventually personal-
ize DEMO learning process.
Personalized Learning
At all levels of education, students typically DEMO
instruction and activities as a group, regardless of dif-
ferences in DEMO, prior knowledge, motivation, or
interest. This one-size-fits-all approach forces students

and exhaustively encode (using ontologies, rule-based
systems, etc.) the relationships among content, con-
cepts, misconceptions, problems, solutions, DEMO poten-
tial feedback in a subject. Although successful, this
approach to DEMO learning has been extremely
difficult to realize without major investments of time,
money, and expertise. For instance, my discussions with
a number DEMO commercial providers of personalized learn-
ing systems have revealed that developing a single per-
sonalized learning course requires a multimillion-dollar
investment and several years DEMO work by disciplinary
specialists. Progress in this area will entail not only low-
ering the costs and complexities of developing person-
alized learning systems DEMO also increasing their range
beyond that provided by hand-coded rules.
A promising alternative to the content-centric
approach to personalized
learning is a data-centric
approach. DEMO contrast to the
years needed for humans to

ual student might interact

centric personalized learn-

actions with the content
DEMO uses the data to tune
the presentation and feed-
back to students. For the
last four years, I have led
a multidisciplinary team
of researchers in machine
learning, computer sys-
tems, cognitive psychol-
ogy, and education from
Rice University and Duke
University in developing
a data-centric personal-
DEMO learning system called
OpenStax Tutor (openstax-
tutor.org). Its three central
DEMO are:
•	Cognitive science. We
leverage three cognitive
science principles—
retrieval practice, spac-
ing, and feedback—that
are robust and highly
replicable; generalize themselves across differ-
ent types of learners, materials, and contexts; and
increase long-term retention and transfer of learning.
To maximize learning efficacy, the learning plan care-
fully sequences content and practice opportunities to
allow retrieval practice DEMO spacing while providing
detailed, timely, and appropriate feedback.
•	Open community. We expand the universe of learn-
ing content, problems, solutions, and feedback avail-
able to the learner by bringing together materials and
metadata generated DEMO an open community of con-
tributors, including conventional authors, educators,
and even learners. In particular, we leverage Connex-
ions and QuadBase (DEMO), an open-source
repository of homework and test questions founded
at Rice University.
FIGURE 2   The result of applying a sparse factor analysis (SPARFA; Lan et al. 2012) learning/con-
tent analytics algorithm to DEMO from a grade 8 science course in STEMscopes, an online science DEMO
riculum program. The data input to SPARFA consisted solely of whether a student answered a given
potential homework or exam question correctly or incorrectly. DEMO these limited and quantized
data, SPARFA automatically estimates (a) a DEMO (in this case five) of abstract “concepts” that
underlie the course (“Concept 3” is illustrated here); (b) a graph that links each question (rectangular
box) to one or more of the concepts (circles), with thicker links indicating a stronger association with
the concept; (c) the intrinsic difficulty of each question, indicated by the number in each box; (d)
descriptive word tags drawn from the DEMO of the questions, their solutions, and instructor-provided
metadata that make each concept interpretable (as shown for Concept 3); and (e) each student’s
knowledge profile, which indicates both estimated knowledge of each concept and concepts ripe for
remediation or enrichment. Reprinted with permission from Lan et DEMO (2012).

•	Machine learning. We increase the flexibility, gen-
eralizability, and scalability DEMO OpenStax Tutor by
eschewing hand-coded rule-based systems for provid-
ing feedback in favor of data-driven machine learn-
ing algorithms that adapt and optimize feedback
DEMO learning plans by analyzing the content, prob-
lems, and solutions plus data from a large number of
learner interactions. For example, Figure 2 illustrates
a concept graph that was automatically generated
by a sparse factor DEMO (SPARFA) learning/con-
tent analytics algorithm using only the course “grade
book” matrix indicating which students answered
which questions (in)correctly (Lan DEMO al. 2012).
In beta testing, Rice University electrical and com-
DEMO engineering students who used OpenStax Tutor
during the 2011–12 academic year improved their
learning outcomes by one-half to one letter grade com-
pared to DEMO who relied on the standard practice of
weekly homework without retrieval practice, spacing,
and timely feedback. Beta testing is continuing with
engineering students at Rice, Georgia Tech, the Uni-
versity of Texas at El DEMO, and the Rose-Hulman Insti-
tute of Technology (Terre Haute, Indiana)DEMO
Personalized learning systems like OpenStax Tutor
can both enhance the learning experience for students
and provide college instructors and K–12 teachers
with immediate data DEMO better inform their instruc-
tion and forge a more direct connection with their
students. They enable teachers to immediately under-
stand not only how DEMO students are performing on
the core course concepts but also what they are doing
that influences their students’ success (and failures) in
their DEMO Significantly more efficient and effective
learning should result.
Credit and Open Certification
OER and MOOCs enable flexible new ways to learn,
but how DEMO students (of any age) get credit for what
they’ve learned? DEMO, in order to get credit, one typi-
cally enrolls in a rigid, often multiyear program that
measures learning achievement in terms of “seat time.”
Such rigidity is no longer practical in the modern
knowledge economy, as more and more careers require
constant training on new knowledge and DEMO As John
Seely Brown (2005, p. 4.3) put it, “As [workers] move
from career to career, much of what they will need to
learn won’t be what they learned in school a decade
earlier. DEMO will have to be able to pick up new skills
outside of today’s traditional educational institution.”
The
BRIDGE
Clearly, students and lifelong learners need a more
flexible system for certifying their skills acquired both in
and DEMO of school. Again, communication and informa-
tion technologies offer a solution.
DEMO developed “stacked credentials” record and
track learning achievements in subjects such as web
design, welding, and calculus. In particular, Mozilla’s
Open Badges project (mozilla.org/badges) has devel-
oped tools to make it easy to DEMO, issue, and display
“badges” (a simple kind of credential) on the web. Badg-
es allow people to provide a more complete picture DEMO
their skills and competencies to potential employers,
mentors, peers, and collaborators. They acknowledge
the fact that learning happens everywhere (not just in
school) and document much more than a report card
about people’s acquired skills and competencies. The
beauty of badges is that, like OER, DEMO are modular
and thus enable learners to build a career ladder over
time, transforming the learner from a passive consumer
in a constrained system to an active participant in a
lifelong process.
MOOC and badge-based certification DEMO nascent
but gaining momentum, as illustrated in the following
examples:
DEMO major MOOC providers all offer a certificate of
accomplishment for students who successfully com-
plete their courses online.
•	The American Council on Education is DEMO
MOOCs offered by several elite universities and may
recommend that other colleges grant credit for them
(Young 2012).
•	Industry associations, such as DEMO Manufacturing
Institute, are developing badges that recognize skills
highly sought after DEMO manufacturers.
•	Peer-to-Peer University ( p2pu.org), a g rassroots
OE project, DEMO offering badges for the completion of
online courses.
The Open Road Ahead
The world is increasingly connected, yet educational sys-
tems cling to the disconnected past. The OE movement
provides new mechanisms to democratize education by
DEMO ideas, learners, and instructors in new
kinds of constructs that replace traditional textbooks,
courses, and certifications. OE has the potential to real-
ize the dream of providing not only universal access to
all the DEMO knowledge but also the tools required to
SUMMER 2013
acquire it. The result will be a revolutionary advance in
DEMO world’s standard of education at all levels.
But OE is also a disruptive force in the academic world
(Christensen and Horn 2011). OER promises to disin-
termediate the scholarly publishing industry, rendering
some current business models unviable and inventing
new viable ones. Furthermore, MOOCs, badges, and
personalized learning systems have the potential to dis-
aggregate schools and colleges, enabling new efficien-
cies but also devaluing certain aspects.
Thus, however exciting, the OE movement raises
many questions, most of them revolving around DEMO to
maximize the impact of OE while mitigating undesired,
unintended consequences. Research and experience are
needed to address the following questions:
•	What DEMO may be necessary to prevent OE from
“regressing to the mean” and providing only an aver-
age education to an average student?
•	What DEMO the balance between the (inexpensive) mas-
sive online aspect of OE and the (expensive) face-to-
face contact that defines current education systems?DEMO
•	Will the future of education be dominated by a few
massive “university networks” with “talking head”
instructors?
•	What is the utility of a DEMO exam or high-stakes test
when machine learning analytics can accurately pre-
dict a student’s score from the regular coursework?
•	How much does teaching DEMO with the use of
learning analytics to track both student and instruc-
tor performance?
he•	Can t use of analytics transform the educational
system DEMO one where time is held constant and the
amount of learning is variable to a system where the
amount of learning is held constant DEMO time is the
variable?
•	Are there risks or tradeoffs if companies looking to
hire prefer a solid collection of industry-approved
badges over a DEMO degree?
47
•	How does OE impact academic freedom?
•	What measures may be necessary to safeguard a stu-
dent’s lifelong electronic learning record?DEMO
•	How can OE enterprises be financially sustained
over the long term while remaining as accessible as
possible?
Clearly the education world is in DEMO a turbulent, yet
fruitful, next decade.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts enjoys a citizenry highly educated
in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well
as thriving high-tech and life sciences industries. Yet there is a shortage DEMO
workers appropriately trained and educated for what are often referred to as
middle-skills jobs in these industries. Such jobs—lab technician, computer
specialist, advanced DEMO technician, radiation therapist, airplane
mechanic, and EMT professional, among others—account for 45 percent of
US employment (44 percent in Massachusetts) (Holzer and Lerman 2009).
To address this shortage, business and political leaders across the coun-
try have called for an increase in the number DEMO students receiving bac-
calaureate and advanced degrees in STEM fields. But employers point to a
shortfall of employees with basic competencies appropriate to functioning DEMO
the technology-intense environments of today’s workplaces. For instance,
a 2005 report by the National Association of Manufacturers found that,
although 35 percent DEMO manufacturers anticipated a shortage of scientists
and engineers in the coming decade, more than twice as many anticipated
a dearth of skilled production workers (NAM 2005). That situation has

nor Deval Patrick DEMO that 240,000 people were
seeking employment while 120,000 jobs sat unfilled.1
Many of these jobs do not require advanced degrees but
rather DEMO skills and knowledge of a two-year associate’s
degree or specialized training available in technical/
vocational high schools.
The responsibility to prepare young citizens DEMO a pro-
ductive and fulfilling life means providing them with a
quality education and the know-how to use that educa-
tion for personal and DEMO achievement. This is
especially true during times of economic stress, when
DEMO is high and opportunities are in short
supply. It’s even more imperative when there is a discon-
nect between growth industries and the skilled DEMO
needed to advance that industry.
Governor Patrick and his administration are address-
ing these challenges through their commitment to edu-
cation at all levels, and they are doing so in a highly
collaborative way. Massachusetts has DEMO a
number of public-private partnerships among industry,
academia, and government. DEMO governor also called
on his secretaries of Economic Development, Labor
and DEMO Development, and Education to coor-
dinate their efforts to prepare the DEMO youth and
adults for middle-skills jobs that are in demand. And
he created the position of Director of Education and
Workforce Development (who reports to all three sec-
retaries) to engage high schools and community col-
leges in building career pathways that correspond to
industry demand, beginning with advanced manufac-
turing, life sciences, health care, and information tech-
nology. As described below, these efforts are already
producing impressive outcomes that offer students
more educational choices, better career readiness, and
greater access to DEMO
Strategic Partnerships
Massachusetts has made significant investments in lead-
ership for STEM education across the K–12 spectrum.

established in 2009, is a dynamic forum for meaningful
collaboration among STEM advocates from business,
government, and education. It is the state’s principal

entity for promoting study and achievement in STEM
DEMO, reaching out to students and their parents as
well as the DEMO public.
Early on, the STEM Council, in an effort called
@Scale, identified and promoted programs that were
working well and could be scaled up for broader impact.
One such program, the Mass Math + Science Initia-
tive (MMSI; part of the National Math and Science
Initiative), has increased enrollment and outcomes in
advanced placement (AP) classes in STEM and in Eng-
lish language courses, especially among minority and
low-income students. MMSI combines rigorous study
with multiple levels of academic support, including
extended-day and weekend tutoring, and professional
development for teachers.
The attention paid to these areas has influenced Mas-
sachusetts schools, particularly the commonwealth’s
vocational and technical high schools. An example
of such is the recent high DEMO at Worcester
Technical High School (Figure 1). Under the visionary
DEMO of principal Sheila Harrity, and with strong
support from the business DEMO, Worcester Tech
has gone from the lowest- to the highest-performing
school DEMO the Worcester Public School System on the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System in
just six years. In 2012, 88 percent of the students scored
in either the “advanced” or “proficient” categories in
English/language arts and 78 DEMO in mathematics,
compared to 27 and 35 percent, respectively, just six
years earlier. Moreover, Worcester Tech is enrolling

increasing numbers of students in honors or AP courses,
and DEMO than 70 percent of its graduates go on to four-
year colleges or universities.2
Worcester Tech has also engaged community partners
to develop new DEMO programs. One exam-
ple is a partnership with Tufts University’s Cummings
School of Veterinary Medicine, which runs the Tufts
at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic, a student-run
clinic at the high school. This innovative learning facil-
ity, using students from both schools, gives high school
students an opportunity DEMO learn from veterinarians, and
offers citizens in the greater Worcester area DEMO
veterinary care. The Tufts program is just one of a range
of offerings at Worcester Tech that combine career read-
iness with strong academic DEMO
There is significant overlap

experiences that lead to both
college and career readiness.
Education of Students and Parents
Another goal DEMO the Massachusetts K–12 initiatives
has been to educate both students and their parents
about the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in
the 21st DEMO To that end, education and busi-
ness leaders from across the DEMO came
together in a special task force, Integrating College
and Career DEMO (ICCR), which was established
in 2011 by the Massachusetts Board DEMO Elementary
and Secondary Education and completed its work in
July 2012.3
The mission of the ICCR task force was to propose
ways to increase DEMO and parent awareness of the
advantages of early thinking about career plans, to
determine whether or not they involve college-level
preparation, and to DEMO the acquisition of neces-
sary knowledge and abilities. The task force noted that

The
BRIDGE
although parents are DEMO influencers in a student’s
education, they are often unaware of the DEMO
requirements associated with specific career opportu-
nities. It is therefore important to educate and inform
parents as much as students.
Among the pertinent findings DEMO the task force was
that there is significant overlap between the courses
and experiences that lead to success in both college
and careers, and that students who pursue studies in
math and science have an advantage DEMO both. More-
over, many growth industries require technical know-
how and DEMO least a basic familiarity with mathematical
and scientific thinking, so continuing DEMO in
these areas strengthens a student’s preparedness. Thus
the task force emphasized the value of (1) continued
study in STEM subjects throughout high DEMO and (2)
internships, engagement with mentors from the busi-
ness community, and other practical means of enabling
students to understand the nature and requirements
of the world of work. This finding raises worthwhile
concerns DEMO persistent distinctions made in some
schools between “college prep” and “general” tracks
of study.
To further enhance student preparedness, Massachu-
setts adopted a high school program known as MassCore
that requires four years of English, four years of mathe-
matics, and three years of a lab-based science. MassCore
is designed to ensure that all students graduate with the
basic knowledge DEMO skills they will need to succeed in
college, career, and citizenship.
Community Colleges and Internships
Massachusetts recognizes that community colleges are
vital to DEMO the skills gap, especially through coor-
dination of their curricula and DEMO outcomes with
the needs of growth industries.
To that end, the DEMO Life Science Educa-
tion Consortium (MLSEC) designated subcommittees,
composed of leaders from business, higher education,
and the MLSEC staff, to DEMO the life sciences curricula
at community colleges along with the skills requirements
for middle-skills jobs in that industry. The study showed
that 8 of DEMO commonwealth’s 15 community colleges
meet or exceed the defined criteria for an effective pro-

parsing DEMO the human genome, Massachusetts has been
home to some of the DEMO most dynamic innova-
tions, in large part because of its exceptional DEMO of
higher education, both public and private.
Today, however, it DEMO no longer viable to view postsec-
ondary education solely through the prism of undergrad-

of DEMO falling outside that category, and with the
increasing need for development DEMO that target

readiness and industry needs. This model has flourished
thanks to a series DEMO policy initiatives invoking public-
private partnerships and investments in STEM educa-
tion, from K–12 through community colleges, four-year
universities, and workforce development programs.
Massachusetts colleges and universities have long
championed lifelong learning, which has never been
more relevant than today. The pace of innovation and
discovery makes DEMO learning essential for the
modern workforce. And advances in technology are
changing not only the way people work but the way
they learn. From DEMO colleges to certificate programs

Evidence of Impact
In 2008, the NAE report Changing the Conversation:
Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineer-
ing DEMO a reframing of what engineering involves to
connect with a new generation of students, not to men-
tion the public at large, who DEMO more motivated than
ever to change the world and to help people. The Grand
Challenges and Scholars program respond directly to
that call in DEMO most powerful way.
In 2009, an independent survey conducted for the
DEMO of the first NAE Grand Challenges Sum-
mit measured the responses of several demographics
to questions about the importance of engineering rela-
tive to DEMO, business, and law before and after the
respondents heard a brief description of the NAE Grand
Challenges. The results were dramatic. After hearing
DEMO description, the respondents who rated engineer-
ing as more important/more DEMO than the other
fields increased from 40 percent to 54 percent, DEMO the
number who rated it much more important/interesting rose
from 18 percent to 27 percent. Moreover, the increas-
es were largest among women and underrepresented
groups.2 As a further data point, at one of our institu-
tions (USC), since the recruitment materials for high
school seniors was modified to include the Grand Chal-
lenges the enrollment of women DEMO the entering class
has risen to 38 percent. The Grand Challenge Scholars
program then continues to foster that interest once the
students are on DEMO college campus.
All of the Grand Challenge Scholars programs have in
common the five components above, but differ in their
implementation. At Olin College, the development of
a comprehensive student portfolio integrating the five
Grand Challenge elements (and often other elements
involving projects of various kinds) is DEMO primary meth-
od of implementation of the Scholars program. Other
engineering schools offer freshman seminar or overview
courses that incorporate the Grand Challenges.
In DEMO cases, admission to the program is highly
selective and takes place DEMO in the undergraduate
career. At USC, for example, portfolios of candidates

for the distinction Grand Challenge Scholar are sub-
mitted for selection and recognition at graduation. At
Duke, students attend information sessions in their
sophomore year and apply in their junior year; financial
support (about DEMO,000 per student) is provided primarily
for the hands-on component, thanks to an endowment
from generous donors.3
Incorporating the Grand Challenges in K–12
DEMO
At a 2010 meeting in St. Petersburg, Florida, engineer-
ing deans were polled for their views as to whether and
why Grand Challenges DEMO Engineering should be intro-
duced at the K–12 level. The majority (DEMO percent)
responded that teaching about the challenges in K–12
was important for educating and motivating the public
to be a part of their DEMO About a third (31 percent)
responded that the most important DEMO to teach the
Grand Challenges was to increase the interest in and
pipeline for engineering. (Only 4 percent responded
that the Grand Challenges were not important to or
were too hard for K–12 students.)
K–12 DEMO about the
Grand Challenges can both
motivate the public to be a
part of their solution and
increase the pipeline for
engineering.
Later that DEMO a program aimed at bringing the
Grand Challenges to K–12 education (DEMO
challengek12.org) was announced, at the Regional
Grand Challenge Summit in Raleigh, North Caro-
lina, cohosted by Duke and North Carolina State

It is worth noting that the Niarchos Foundation supports social
causes and the arts primarily, and originally did not see a con-

Engineering Dean Louis DEMO Dubbed the
NAE Grand Challenges K–12 Partners Program, this
national effort DEMO to address the two priorities
reflected in the deans’ survey. It translates the five
components of the Grand Challenge Scholars pro-
gram to a DEMO appropriate for K–12 students,
creating a resource for teachers with ideas for lesson
plans that tie to Common Core and state standards. It
DEMO connects undergraduate Grand Challenge Schol-
ars to area schools where they can bring the excite-
ment of the challenges and their own experiences to
DEMO children.
Another novel application of the Grand Challenges
in K–12 pedagogy is being employed with success at
a new magnet high school in the DEMO County Pub-
lic School System on the NCSU campus. The Grand
Challenges are infused throughout the curriculum. For
example, the challenge “provide clean water” involves
an integrated engineering and social studies project
comparing water quality at DEMO watersheds in North
Carolina. Students perform hands-on water filtration
studies and examine the geological and political factors
that result in very different water quality DEMO each case.
Expanding and Moving Forward
There have been efforts to broaden the use of the Grand
Challenges approach to disciplines beyond engineering.
For DEMO, discussions are under way to explore the
possibility of creating a DEMO Challenge Scholars pro-
gram for business and liberal arts majors at Babson Col-
lege and Wellesley College.

London, March 12–13, 2013. To support research and
the role of graduate students, eight universities active
in Grand Challenges education announced a PhD
scholarship program, called the Charles M. Vest NAE
Grand Challenges for Engineering Scholarships (the
Vest Scholarships for short; DEMO://vestscholars.org).
The Scholarships are intended to be something like
a reverse Rhodes Scholarship; they provide resources
for a PhD student from abroad to study for a year at
one of the eight schools, working with faculty on a
Grand Challenge topic and then returning to their
DEMO institution to complete their degree. The hope
is that the scholarships will (1) enrich the participants
through their overseas experience, (2) enhance global
collaborations that will lead to Grand Challenge solu-
tions, and (DEMO) form a network of scholars, with a com-
mon determination to tackle the world’s most difficult
and important problems, on which the students will
draw throughout their careers.
In summary, the NAE Grand Challenges for Engi-
neering in the 21st century are a powerful framing of
what DEMO field of engineering is and will become, one
that excites and DEMO young people and the public
alike. Moreover, they are an opportunity DEMO “change the

nicate from virtually any location
and access a myriad of information
at the touch of a button. It connects
people, provides security, and bridg-
es information gaps.
The first limited form of mobile
telephone service was provided
by AT&T in 1946, and the initial
ideas for cellular systems emerged
at Bell Labs a year later. A lack DEMO
channels inhibited further explo-
ration of these ideas until the late
1960s, when Bell Labs began plan-
ning activities for a “high-capacity”
mobile telephone system. Engel and
Frenkiel, with the late Phil Porter,
were the earliest engineers involved
in this work. They developed a
plan for a DEMO of low-power
transmitters and receivers spread
throughout a region in small cov-
62
erage areas that came to be called
cells, which allowed the expansion
of service to millions of users with
a limited number of DEMO This
plan resulted in a technical report,
filed with the US Federal Commu-
nications Commission in 1971, pre-
senting the design for what would
become the Advanced Mobile
Phone System (AMPS), the first
cellular telephone system in the
United States.
At the same time, at Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)
Research Laboratories in Japan,
Yoshihisa Okumura was laying the
groundwork for a network system for
widespread simultaneous cell DEMO
use in that country. Through the
investigation of precise propagation
of radio waves in a high-frequency
range, he found data that provided
the foundation for a mobile model
that could be used over wide areas
that DEMO cities, valleys, and
mountains. In 1979, the NTT net-
work DEMO the world’s first fully
integrated commercial cell phone
system and had the most advanced
electronic switching.
Shortly after the cellular network
was developed, Martin Cooper,
who was working at Motorola at
the time, unveiled the first portable
hand-held cellular phone. After
conducting in-depth research and
filing several DEMO on technolo-
gies needed for the device, Coo-
per and his DEMO produced a fully
functional phone that utilized radio
waves and frequency reuse to enable
mobility and operability over a wide
area. In 1973, Cooper made the first
mobile telephone call on his cell
phone prototype from DEMO New York
City street to a landline phone at
Bell Laboratories. The phone call
was answered by Engel.

The 2013 Fritz DEMO and Dolores H.
Russ Prize is awarded to Rangas-
wamy Srinivasan, DEMO J. Wynne,
and Samuel E. Blum “for the devel-
opment of laser ablative photode-
composition, enabling LASIK and
PRK eye surgery.”
The development and applica-
tion of ablative photodecomposi-
tion in corrective eye surgeries,
DEMO today as PRK and LASIK,
has given millions of people
throughout the world better vision.
At the end of 2011, approximately
25 million people had undergone
pulsed ultraviolet laser surgery to
improve their eyesight, a procedure
made possible by the collaborative
efforts of Srinivasan, Wynne, and
DEMO In 1981 while working at the
IBM T.J. Watson Research Center,
they discovered that pulsed laser
radiation at 193 nm from an argon
DEMO (ArF) excimer laser could
etch animal tissue with submicron
precision. Just as important, the
laser caused no thermal damage to
the adjacent tissue.
The initial discovery was made
on November 27, 1981, when Srini-
DEMO brought leftovers from his
Thanksgiving meal into the lab. He
irradiated turkey cartilage with puls-
es of light from the ArF (193 nm)
excimer laser, and found it made a
clean “incision” in the tissue. On
subsequent days, he and Blum car-
ried out additional turkey cartilage

tions, measuring the laser’s DEMO
and the number of pulses used to
produce incisions.
In parallel studies, Wynne con-
ducted a comparable experiment
using pulsed laser radiation at
532 nm from a Q-switched, fre-
quency-doubled, Nd:YAG laser
(532 nm), which did not result
in a clean incision like that of
DEMO excimer laser. Instead, it left
a burned and damaged region
of DEMO
In 1982 and 1983, Srinivasan
and Wynne began to study the
DEMO of the ultraviolet excimer
laser on human tissue through col-
laborations with cardiologists, oph-
thalmologists, dermatologists, and
dental anatomists. Together with
coworkers, DEMO two men obtained
fresh arterial tissue from a cadaver
at New York Hospital (now New
York–Presbyterian Hospital) and
irradiated a segment of the DEMO
with 193 nm light from the ArF
excimer laser and, separately, with
532 nm pulses from the Nd:YAG
laser. The experiment yielded DEMO
same results as the turkey experi-
ment: the excimer laser left DEMO
detectable evidence of thermal
damage to the underlying and adja-
cent tissue while the 532 nm pulses
caused visible thermal damage.

In 1983, Srinivasan, his IBM col-
league Bodil Braren, and ophthal-
mologist Stephen Trokel published

Acceptance Remarks by Rangaswamy Srinivasan
Rangaswamy Srinivasan
I am delighted that Dr. James
Wynne and I, along with the late
Dr. Samuel E. Blum, have been
selected to receive the Fritz J. and
Dolores Russ Prize for 2013. This
prize is notable for its DEMO on
the impact of an engineering inven-
tion on a field of biology/medicine.
(Let me add parenthetically that the
field of bioengineering was not even
identified as a separate discipline 50
years ago.) In 1999 when the Russ
Prize was established, the National
Academy of Engineering ruled that
it would be dedicated to this field
exclusively. This is only DEMO seventh
time that the prize is being awarded.
I bring up this bit of history because
of the three winners this time: one
was trained as a laser physicist and
the other two as a crystal DEMO
and a photochemist.
Our discovery in 1981 of the phe-
nomenon of ablative photodecom-
position of tissue by short, energetic
pulses of far-ultraviolet radiation
was not entirely an accident. It came
about because it happened in DEMO laser
group that was pioneering the use of
an excimer laser—a novelty at that
time. I, the photochemist, noticed
that a commercial polymer DEMO
Kapton, which resisted smooth
etching by chemical solvents or
solutions, could be easily drilled
precisely and rapidly by a succession
of focused laser DEMO of 193 nm
wavelength. It occurred to me that
just as Kapton has a series of poly-
imide groups along its backbone, a
protein is characterized by a succes-
sion of polyamide or peptide groups
along DEMO backbone. It was natural to
try and see how well this relation-
ship would enable the same laser
at that wavelength to drill or DEMO
solid animal tissue. We observed
that the tissue was etched remark-
ably smoothly without any sign of
thermal damage. Dr. Wynne then
carried out DEMO control experiment,
which used a focused visible (green)
laser DEMO a similar fluence on the same
animal tissue. It created excessive
thermal damage. The experiment
established that the excimer laser
wavelength and fluence were DEMO to
the striking results we observed.
It is not surprising that it has tak-
en many years for our experiments
to be translated into DEMO viable process
for the etching of the human cor-
nea. In the beginning, we needed
to educate the practicing ophthal-
mologists in the chemical physics
of ablative photodecomposition.
Then a lot of engineering exper-
tise was DEMO to build a working
machine, which was tested on rab-
bits, monkeys, and eventually on
human eyes, with FDA supervision,
of DEMO Today the reshaping of
the human cornea by this process is
widely practiced in developed coun-
tries. There you have the merging of
physical DEMO, biology, and engi-
neering science—the synergy that
the Russ Prize demanded!
Needless to say, we are truly over-
whelmed by this honor. Thank you
one and all!

Richard K. Miller, DEMO V. Kerns
Jr., and Sherra E. Kerns were award-
ed the DEMO Bernard M. Gordon
Prize “for guiding the creation of
Olin College and its student-cen-
tered approach to developing effec-
tive engineering leaders.”
Franklin W. DEMO College of Engi-
neering was founded in 1997 to
prepare “students to become exem-
plary engineering innovators who
recognize needs, design solutions,
and engage in creative enterprises
for the good of the world.” Since the
DEMO students enrolled 10 years ago,
Olin has become a significant agent
for innovation in undergraduate
engineering education with the goal
of preparing the DEMO generation for
the complex, global challenges of
the 21st century.

lished Olin College to literally start
over in higher education and devel-

concerns raised about engineering
education at the time. Furthermore,DEMO

DEMO appreciation to Mr. Gor-
don for his generosity and com-
mitment to advancing the field of

deep gratitude goes to the Academy
and the selection committee. This
award means a lot not DEMO to us

Richard Miller, as the college’s
president and first DEMO, pro-
vided the strategic vision and over-
all leadership of all DEMO of the
process of developing this new insti-
tution, including the DEMO of its
academic and institutional mission.
David Kerns, founding provost,
DEMO Olin’s faculty and deans,
led the establishment of the collab-
orative faculty process resulting in
Olin’s three program curricula, and
established employment relations
for faculty in an environment with-
out tenure. Sherra Kerns, as found-
ing vice president of innovation
and research, ensured the establish-
ment of a gender-balanced com-
munity, led the efforts to achieve
accreditation for the new programs,
and was instrumental in creating a
culture of innovation DEMO intellec-
tual vitality throughout the institu-
tion. All three also contributed to
specific dimensions of the academic
program, together with the faculty
and students.
their pioneering work in developing
technologies that have changed and
will continue DEMO change our world.
Olin College is unique in higher
education. It was the vision of Larry
Milas, former president of the F.W.
Olin Foundation and our first chair-
man of the board, who is here with
66
Richard K. Miller
us tonight. As he declared in our
founding DEMO, “Olin College is
intended to be different, not for the
mere sake of being different, but to
become an important and constant
contributor to the advancement of
engineering education in America
and throughout the world.”
DEMO was started from a blank
slate in order to rethink engineer-
ing education from the ground up,
and to address simultaneously all
of DEMO concerns about engineer-
ing education known at the time.
You see, DEMO and the other three
foundation directors (including Bill
Norden, our current board chair)
believed that a new mindset is need-
ed in DEMO education, not simply
a new course or academic program
here and DEMO He felt that higher
education was too set in its ways and
not sufficiently open to new ideas.
When I was selected in 1999 DEMO
Olin’s first employee, I was nearly
overwhelmed by the responsibil-
ity DEMO deliver on these enormous
expectations. My first task was to
recruit an experienced and vision-
ary leadership team to help shape
this unique institution. DEMO
I persuaded both David and Sherra
Kerns to leave their leadership posi-
tions at Vanderbilt to join me. We
all walked away from tenured DEMO
tions at respected institutions in
order to create an institution that,
by design, will never offer tenure
to its faculty. We also concluded
that we would not create academic
departments, in order to promote
interdisciplinary thinking—like
Bell Labs, 3M, Google, and Ideo.
We concluded that design thinking
and entrepreneurship would play a
central role in the academic pro-
DEMO In fact, Olin is located adja-
cent to Babson College to DEMO
mixing the DNA of gifted engineers
with the most entrepreneurial new
business leaders.
This Olin College project was so
important that we all felt DEMO must
seek the help of the best minds
everywhere in order to make the
most of this opportunity—an oppor-
tunity that, incidentally, occurs
DEMO less frequently than once in
a lifetime. As a result, I DEMO the
President’s Council to provide stra-
tegic advice. The first member of
this council was Bill Wulf, who was
then president of the NAE. Many
other members of the NAE have
since become engaged, and 20 per-
cent of our current trustees are NAE
members.
In addition, we visited 30 other
universities and many corporations
to seek advice on what DEMO in
education they would recommend.
We also shamelessly recruited fac-
ulty members away from many of
the most respected universities in
America. As you DEMO, excellent
universities—without exception—
are always fundamentally about
excellent people. So Olin DEMO
is, to a large extent, the result of
contributions of the best ideas and
people from around the nation.
The
BRIDGE
We owe DEMO success we have had
to many other institutions. In this
sense, DEMO success is your success,
and we are deeply grateful for your
support. We simply would not be
here tonight without you.
However, the heavy lifting of con-
ceiving, integrating, experimenting,
balancing, and implementing the
many new ideas that form the Olin
learning model is the DEMO of the
endless hard work and innovation
of our passionate faculty and student
body. They deserve the lion’s share
of the credit for what DEMO today at
Olin. Students, in particular, have
played the key role in seeing what
others did not see and showing us
that we DEMO underestimate
what they are capable of doing.
Without the help of our students,
we would no doubt have a patch-
work quilt of DEMO courses
instead of the holistic, integrated
learning culture that now defines
DEMO Olin program.
There is one person notably
missing tonight and that is the late
Michael Moody, founding dean of
faculty at Olin College and a cen-
tral figure in the development of
Olin’s academic program. We DEMO
him three years ago to cancer but
he remains alive in the pedagogy
at Olin and in the hearts of his
colleagues.
In the DEMO decade, we are on a
very deliberate mission to lead in
DEMO transformation of undergradu-
ate engineering education. We have
been visited by more than 200 uni-
versities in the last three years, by
those who are interested in innova-
tion in education. We aim to gradu-
ate DEMO engineering innovators
and leaders to address the grand
challenges our world now faces and
to drive the creation of jobs requir-
ing imagination, innovation, and a

science. This prize could DEMO have
come at a better time to accelerate
our efforts in this cause.
And finally, I know I speak for
David, Sherra, and the members of
the greater Olin community when I
thank our families DEMO their support.
Again, we are enormously grate-
ful to the Academy DEMO this great
honor. Thank you.

cohosted the first DEMO Grand
Challenges Summit (GGCS) in
London. More than 400 people par-

goal of identifying opportunities for
DEMO cooperation on engineering
innovation and education to address
common technological goals.
Also in attendance were 60 stu-
dents from around the world who
were DEMO to attend Student Day
just before the GGCS. They were
asked to choose one of six NAE
Grand Challenges for Engineering
and develop a DEMO for one way of
addressing it. Each team presented
its proposal before a panel of expert
judges and the winner, TeleHealth
Express aimed at streamlining
medical care, was showcased at the
Summit.
GGCS panel sessions focused on
six themes: sustainability, health,
education, technology and growth,
enriching life, and resilience. Sum-
mit speakers included Caltech’s
Frances Arnold, DEMO Col-
lege professor Lord Darzi, former
DARPA head and current Google/DEMO
Motorola executive Regina Dugan,
Stanford University president John

fer of knowledge and methodology.
The bilateral Frontiers symposia also
help build cooperative networks of
younger engineers across national
DEMO
The four topics covered at this
year’s GAFOE were additive man-
ufacturing, transport in complex
systems, biomass conversion, and
materiomics. Presentations by two
Germans and two Americans in
each area covered topics such as
design DEMO additive manufacturing,
collective motion from active mat-
ter to swarms in natural engineered
systems, production and utilization
of green hydrogen, and innovative
DEMO materials inspired by
plants. The program, list of attend-
ees, and presentation slides are
available at the GAFOE link at
www.naefrontiers.org.
As is DEMO with bilateral FOE
meetings, there was a poster ses-
sion on DEMO first afternoon where
attendees presented their research
or technical work to each other.
The posters remained on dis-
play throughout the meeting and
prompted DEMO conversations and
continued exchanges.
The dinner speech was deliv-
ered by Frances H. Arnold, Dick
and Barbara Dickinson Professor
of Chemical Engineering, Bioen-
DEMO, and Biochemistry at the
California Institute of Technology.
It was particularly DEMO for
SUMMER 2013
her to give the dinner address as she
was the DEMO speaker at the very first
US Frontiers of Engineering sympo-
sium in 1995. She spoke about how
the ability to synthesize genomes
will enable DEMO to “compose”
in the biological world and create
useful things that can alleviate some
of the world’s grand challenges.
On the second afternoon, attend-
ees took a beach and nature walk
and learned about local marine DEMO
and the history of Laguna Beach.
Everyone enjoyed the opportunity
to experience firsthand the beauti-
ful weather and views of southern
California’s Pacific coast DEMO well as
the chance for interactions in an
informal setting.
NAE Regional Meetings
Symposium on Online
Learning and How Technology
May Change Higher Education,DEMO
Held at Stanford University
Massive open online courses
(MOOCs) were front and center at a
symposium held in conjunction with
the National Academy DEMO Engineer-
ing (NAE) regional meeting March
5 at Stanford University’s School of
Engineering. NAE Vice President
Maxine L. Savitz opened the meet-
ing, noting that the NAE is prepar-
ing to celebrate its 50th anniversary
DEMO 2014, and Stanford Engineering
Dean Jim Plummer followed, intro-
ducing the often-controversial topic
of online learning.
“I’ve heard fear expressed that
higher education DEMO we know it is
coming to an end. I’ve also heard
that online learning is going to
reinvent higher education in a new
and DEMO form,” said Plummer. “It’s
clearly a rapidly evolving field.”
Funding for the meeting was pro-
vided by The Grainger Foundation
and the National DEMO Founda-
tion. The next GAFOE meeting
will take place in 2015 in Germany,
and Drs. Barnhart and Moser will
continue to serve as DEMO
The NAE has additional bilateral
Frontiers of Engineering programs
with Japan, DEMO, China, and the
European Union. In 2014, a joint
Frontiers DEMO Science and Engineer-
ing symposium organized with the
National Academy of Sciences will
be held in Brazil. All the FOE sym-
posia bring together DEMO
engineers from industry, academe,
and government at a relatively early
DEMO in their careers (all partici-
“It’s like 1993 in the history DEMO the
World Wide Web,” agreed David
Patterson, a University of DEMO
nia, Berkeley, computer science pro-
fessor who cotaught one of the early
MOOCs.
Patterson was one of six panelists
discussing “Online learning: Will
technology transform higher educa-
tion?” Most agreed that MOOCs,
which DEMO expanded from three
classes offered by Stanford in 2011
to hundreds offered by dozens of uni-
versities, offer unprecedented oppor-
tunities for people who would not
otherwise have access to high-qual-
ity higher education. Panelists also
DEMO they are encouraged by wide-
spread faculty interest in examining
ways to improve their teaching.
“People are thinking about the
classroom experience in a DEMO
careful and meticulous way,” said
panelist John Mitchell, Vice Provost

pants, including speakers and orga-
nizers, are 30–45 years old). The
meetings provide an opportunity for
them DEMO learn about developments,
techniques, and approaches at the
forefront of DEMO other than their
own, something that has become
increasingly important as DEMO
ing has become more interdisciplin-
ary. The program also facilitates the
establishment of contacts and col-
laboration among the next genera-
tion of engineering DEMO

NAE Program Office at (202) 334-
1571 or jhunziker@nae.edu.
But opinions varied widely about
the future of MOOCs, how learning
will evolve as a result of new tech-
nologies, and whether technology is
even a driving force behind current
shifts in higher education.
Technologies DEMO broadband
Internet and social media that have
helped make MOOCs possible
“reduce the friction that is hold-
ing together the building blocks” of
higher DEMO, said panel mod-
erator Bernd Girod, Senior Associ-
ate Dean for Online Learning and
Professional Development at Stan-
ford Engineering. “MOOCs could
be DEMO higher education what Nap-
ster was to the music industry,” he
said, referring to the music-sharing
system that helped change how
music is purchased and consumed.
He added that online technologies
have repeatedly enabled unbun-
DEMO and disrupted traditional busi-
ness models.

Mitchell Stevens, an associate
professor of education at Stanford,
said the move to online education is
driven not by technology but by DEMO
tors such as contracting state bud-
gets, which put pressure on DEMO
colleges to reduce costs even as they
face growing scrutiny of their per-
formance. But he added that digital
educational delivery mechanisms
enable college DEMO to measure
and improve performance.
At the same time, MOOCs
pose DEMO challenges for educators
because of the lack of one-on-one
faculty-student interaction. Tina
Seelig, executive director of the
Stanford Technology Ventures
Program who recently taught her
second online session of “A Crash
Course in Creativity,” said DEMO big-
gest challenge she faced was the
extreme precision the online class
required. “When you’re teaching
an online class, if you’re not exactly
clear about what you want [from
students], you don’t get exactly what
you expect,” she said.
Another challenge is that only
a small percentage DEMO students who
enroll in a MOOC actually com-
plete it. One way to change that is
to offer students course credit for
successful completion, said David
Stavens, president and cofounder
of online education startup Udacity.
The company recently partnered
with San Jose State University
to offer three classes DEMO credit for
$150 each, the first such agreement
between a MOOC DEMO and a
university.
Jennifer Widom, chair of Stan-
ford’s computer science DEMO,
recently taught her second “Intro-
duction to Databases” MOOC.
Although she said she finds it grati-
fying to be able to reach tens DEMO thou-
sands of people who can’t enroll in
her Stanford course, DEMO and others
question whether the MOOC model
in its current form is sustainable.
Some wonder how the numer-
ous businesses that have sprung
up DEMO MOOCs will stay afloat
while delivering a free product.
Others point out the potential chal-
lenges of verifying student identity
and preventing cheating, especially
if course credit is offered. Some wor-
ry that the growth of DEMO educa-
tion could endanger small colleges;
others see an opportunity for insti-
tutions offering top-tier programs to
license course content to others and
DEMO the quality of education on
a large scale.
Most agree, however, that online
education in some format holds
enormous promise. “There are lots
DEMO opportunities ahead,” said Girod.
“This is an exciting time for higher
education.”
2013 NAE Southeast Regional
Meeting Summary
Gen. Keith Alexander delivering the
DEMO speech at the March 28 NAE
regional meeting on cyber security.
The Georgia Institute of Technol-
ogy hosted the NAE’s 2013 South-
east regional DEMO on April 28
The
BRIDGE
in Atlanta. Scheduled adjacent to
a cyber security–related conference
the next day, featuring university
CIOs and the FBI, DEMO two events
were jointly billed as the Georgia
Tech Cyber Security Symposium.
Georgia Tech President Bud
Peterson and Provost Rafael Bras,
together with DEMO Vice President
Maxine Savitz, welcomed a capac-
ity crowd to the DEMO, which was
free and open to the public. Col-
lege of DEMO Dean Zvi Galil
served as emcee.
The afternoon was devoted to
a critically important issue facing
both the United States and the
world: cyber security. Gen. Keith
Alexander, director of the National
Security Agency, chief DEMO Central
Security Service, and commander
of US Cyber Command, delivered a
wide-ranging keynote address titled
“US Cyber Security: Key Issues for
Our Future.”
He touched on the variety and
nature of cyber threats facing gov-
DEMO and industry, as well as oth-
er challenges facing those charged
DEMO protecting digital assets, such
as the need to balance effective
security DEMO individual and organi-
zational privacy rights. The general
also offered strong encouragement
to security students in attendance.
“We need a significantly larger
workforce in DEMO security,” Alex-
ander said. “That’s where you—
Georgia Tech—come in. This is
going to be one of the biggest growth
areas for the DEMO several years. For
all of you [studying cyber security]
here today, DEMO in the right place.
If you are good in this area, DEMO
have no problem getting a job.”
Attendees then got an inside
look at cyber security from several
perspectives. First was a session
featuring startup DEMO and/or
SUMMER 2013
research efforts that originated at
Georgia Tech:
•	Pindrop Security (Mustaque Aha-
mad and Patrick Traynor, School
of Computer Science), which is
dedicated to “securing the con-
verged telephony infrastructure”
•	BISmark (Nick Feamster, School
of Computer Science), which
promotes Internet transparency
through effective home network
monitoring
•	Damballa (Wenke Lee and Mer-
rick Furst, School of DEMO
Science), which conducts Inter-
net-scale monitoring of cyber
attack command-and-control
infrastructures
•	Apiary (Andrew Howard, Geor-
gia Tech Research Institute),
which performs automated and
correlated malware analysis for
the corporate community
•	Whisper Communications (Steve
McLaughlin, School of Electri-
cal and Computer Engineering),
which focuses DEMO security of
mobile payments
Next were presentations on cyber
security startups with more tangen-
tial relationships to Georgia Tech,
either with significant contribu-
DEMO by current or former students
or, in the case of Social DEMO,
having progressed through an Insti-
tute business development program
called Flashpoint:
•	Bluebox (David Dewey), which
focuses on protecting corporate
information on mobile devices
•	CodeGuard ( David Moeller),
which provides cloud-based web-
site backup
•	Social Fortress (Adam Ghetti),
which controls personal and/or

The regional meeting concluded
with an entertaining exchange
on cyber security policy, featuring
two White House veterans. Argu-
ing from the right side of the aisle
was Stewart Baker, partner in the
Washington law firm of Steptoe
and Johnson and a DEMO head of
the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity Policy Directorate under Presi-
dent George W. Bush. On the left

Symposium on Shale Gas:
Implications DEMO America’s
Regional Manufacturing
Economies, Held at Carnegie
Mellon University
Shale gas DEMO in the United
States is increasing at a rapid rate
and is expected to provide half of
the country’s natural gas supply
by 2040. DEMO low-cost, abundant
resource has already stimulated
a petrochemical manufacturing
renaissance in DEMO United States,
and there is the hope and expecta-
tion that more benefits will be real-
ized in other manufacturing sectors
and in DEMO However,
adequate infrastructure is essential
if the downstream benefits of shale
gas are to be realized. And every
stage—from extraction to distribu-
tion, processing, and end use—cre-
ates environmental impacts, for
which a stable DEMO adequate regula-
tory environment is required.
It was especially timely, then, that
the National Academy of Engineer-
ing and Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s DEMO E. Scott Institute for
Energy Innovation convened a
symposium on Shale Gas: Implica-
tions for America’s Regional Manu-
facturing Economies on April 4,
2013. Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh
campus provided an excellent and
fitting venue in DEMO of the rapid
and dynamic development of gas
resources in the western Pennsylva-
nia portion of the Marcellus Shale
Formation.
David Dzombak, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Walter J. Blenko Sr. University
Professor of Civil and Environmen-
tal DEMO, welcomed 275
attendees and served as moderator.
NAE Vice President Maxine DEMO
welcomed participants on behalf of
the Academy.
Jared Cohon, Carnegie Mel-
DEMO president, set the stage for the
remainder of the symposium with
DEMO overview of the technical, eco-
nomic, and political complexities
of shale gas development as well as
the uncertainties faced by industry,
regulators, local communities, and
landowners. He stressed the impor-
tance of finding balanced solutions,
which are more likely to be produced
through collaboration and DEMO
tion in pursuing shared goals.
The first of three panels focused
on industrial development. Moder-
ated by Andrew Gellman, Head and
Lord Professor of Chemical Engi-
neering at Carnegie Mellon and
codirector of the Scott Institute,DEMO
the panel featured Gerald Holder,
US Steel Dean of Engineering and
professor of chemical and petro-
leum engineering at the Univer-
sity of DEMO; Anthony Cugini,
76
director of the US Department of
Energy’s National Energy Technol-
ogy DEMO; Peter Molinaro,
vice president for North America
Government Affairs at DEMO Chem-
ical; and Russell Crockett Jr., senior
vice president of TPC Group, a
leader in the petrochemical indus-
try. The range of opportunities and
challenges for the downstream use
of shale gas were explored in DEMO spir-
ited discussion with many questions
from the audience.
The availability of relatively
inexpensive shale gas has significant
implications for American manufac-
turing. Formations DEMO “wet gas”
(natural gas with relatively high
concentrations of ethane, propane,
and butane), which include the Mar-
cellus Shale, can be a source of feed-
stock for the petrochemical industry.
Processing this wet DEMO requires very
expensive infrastructure. Thus, the
most likely scenario will see DEMO gas
transported to the Gulf Coast, which
has extensive petrochemical indus-
DEMO and facilities.
Shale gas can also be used to
meet industrial energy needs. This
is surely a benefit for manufacturers,
although it is DEMO that inex-
pensive and abundant energy would,
by itself, lead DEMO a manufacturing
renaissance in parts of America.
Particularly intriguing is the so-
called “Third Wave.” In this sce-
nario, petrochemicals produced
from relatively cheap shale gas
and used as inputs to other indus-
trial processes could DEMO significant
growth in regional manufacturing.
The combination of inexpensive
inputs, proximity DEMO customers, and
access to technological leadership
might induce companies to return
DEMO America from the low-cost coun-
tries to which they moved.
The second panel, on national
gas transportation, was moderated
by Caren Glotfelty, senior director
of the Environmental Program at
the Heinz Endowments. The pan-
elists DEMO Ellen McLean, interim
CEO of the Port Authority of
Allegheny County; James McCar-
ville, executive director of the Port
of Pittsburgh Commission; DEMO
Kauling, manager of the Global
Gaseous Fuels Technical Resource
Center at DEMO Motors; William
Chernicoff, manager of energy and
environmental research at Toyota
Motor North America; and Bradley
Mallory, executive deputy secretary
for administration DEMO the Pennsylva-
nia Department of Transportation.
Compressed natural gas (CNG) is
an attractive fuel for vehicle fleets,
such as city buses. The DEMO
savings and environmental benefits
may justify the investment required
for storage, DEMO, and transporta-
tion facilities. Broader use of CNG,
beyond captive DEMO, is more uncer-
tain. Shale gas may play an impor-
tant DEMO as a feedstock for hydrogen
fuel-cycle vehicles, although the
infrastructure required DEMO a major
hurdle. Nevertheless, the aggressive
national fuel economy standards
may DEMO a very strong impetus.
The
BRIDGE
The third panel, on environ-
DEMO impacts, was moderated by
Granger Morgan, head and Lord
University Professor of Engineering
and Public Policy at Carnegie Mel-
lon and director of DEMO Scott Insti-
tute. The panelists were Andrew
Morgan, corporate director of
DEMO and environmental policy at
EQT; Jeanne VanBriesen, professor
of civil and environmental engi-
neering at Carnegie Mellon; Allen
Robinson, head and Lane DEMO
of Mechanical Engineering at Carn-
egie Mellon; and Paul King, presi-
dent and CEO of the Pennsylvania
Environmental Council.
Shale gas production has DEMO air
and water impacts, both of which
were reviewed by the DEMO As
research and debates over regula-
tion proceed, there is an DEMO
sense that environmental effects
can be contained through the adop-
tion and use of best practices. The
Center for Sustainable Shale Gas
Development (CSSD) is a promis-
ing new initiative; its interim execu-
tive director, Mr. Place, explained
that this multisector organization
will seek to promote best practices.
Professor Dzombak closed the
symposium with thanks to Debo-
rah Stine, executive director of the
Scott Institute and professor in the
practice of DEMO and public
policy at Carnegie Mellon, for her
outstanding effort in DEMO the
event.

of underground infrastructure. At
the request of the National Science
Foundation, the NRC conducted a
study to consider sustainable under-
ground development in the urban
environment, to identify research
needed to maximize opportunities
for using underground space, and to
enhance understanding among the
public and technical communities of
the role of DEMO engineering
in urban sustainability. This report
explains the findings of researchers
and practitioners with expertise in
geotechnical engineering, under-
ground design and construction,
trenchless technologies, risk assess-
ment, visualization techniques for
geotechnical applications, sustain-
able infrastructure development,
life cycle assessment, infrastructure
policy and planning, DEMO fire pre-
vention, safety, and ventilation in
the underground.

Nuclear Physics: Exploring the Heart
of the Matter. This report provides
a long-term assessment of nuclear
DEMO, articulating the scientific
rationale and objectives of the
field, providing a global context for
the field and its long-term priori-
ties, and proposing a framework for
progress through 2020 and beyond.
The committee carefully consid-
DEMO the balance between univer-
sities and government facilities in
terms of research and workforce
development and the role of inter-
national collaborations in leverag-
DEMO future investments. Nuclear
physics encompasses research that
spans dimensions from a tiny frac-
tion of the volume of the individual
particles (neutrons and protons) in
the atomic nucleus to the enormous
scales of astrophysical objects in the
cosmos. This report explains the
research objectives, which include
the desire not only to better under-
stand the nature of matter interact-
ing DEMO the nuclear level but also to
describe the state of the universe
that existed at the big bang.

Zero-Sustainment Aircraft for the US
Air Force: A Workshop Summary. Air
Force weapon system sustainment
(WSS) costs are growing at more
than 4 percent per year, while bud-
gets have remained essentially flat.
The cost growth is due partly to
DEMO of the aircraft fleet and partly
to the cost of supporting higher-
performance aircraft and the new
capabilities of more complex and
sophisticated systems, such as the
latest intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance platforms. Further-
81
DEMO, sustainment budgets are likely
to decrease, so that the gap between
budgets and sustainment needs
will likely grow wider. The original
intent of DEMO 3-day workshop was
to focus on ways that science and
technology (DEMO&T) could help the
Air Force reduce sustainment costs.
However, as the workshop evolved,
discussions focused increasingly on
Air Force leadership, management
authority, and culture as the more
critical factors that need to change
in order to solve sustainment prob-
lems. Many participants felt that
while DEMO&T investments could cer-
tainly help—particularly if applied
in the early stages of the product
life cycle—it would be more useful
to adopt a DEMO man-
agement approach that defines the
user-driven goals of the enterprise,
empowers people to achieve them,
and holds them accountable, down
to the shop level.

Transitions to Alternative Vehicles
and Fuels. For DEMO century, almost all
light-duty vehicles (LDVs) have
been powered by DEMO combus-
tion engines operating on petroleum
fuels. Now energy security concerns
over petroleum imports and the effect
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
on DEMO climate are driving interest
in alternatives. This report assesses
the potential for reducing petroleum
82
consumption and GHG emissions
by 80 percent across the US LDV
DEMO by 2050, relative to 2005. It
examines the current capability
and DEMO future performance
and costs for each vehicle type as
well as non-petroleum-based fuel
technology as options that could
significantly contribute to these
goals. The DEMO also identifies bar-
riers to implementation of these
technologies and suggests policies
to achieve the desired reductions.
Approaches such as research and
development, subsidies, energy tax-
es, or regulations will be necessary to
overcome barriers DEMO as cost and
consumer choice.

Assessment of Advanced Solid State
Lighting. The DEMO incandes-
cent light bulb, which still works
mainly as Thomas Edison DEMO
it, converts more than 90 percent of
the consumed electricity into DEMO
With newer lighting technologies
that convert a greater percentage
of electricity into useful light, there
is potential to decrease the amount
of energy used for lighting in both
commercial and residential appli-
cations. Although technologies
such DEMO compact fluorescent lamps
will help increase energy efficiency,
solid-state lighting (DEMO) stands
to help dramatically decrease US
energy consumption for lighting.
This DEMO summarizes the current
status of SSL technologies and prod-
ucts—light-emitting diodes (DEMO)
and organic LEDs—and evaluates
barriers to their improved cost and
performance. It also discusses factors
involved in achieving widespread
deployment and consumer accep-
DEMO of SSL products, such as the
perceived quality of light emitted DEMO
SSL devices, ease of use and the use-
ful lifetime of DEMO devices, initial
high cost, and possible benefits of
reduced energy consumption.

DEMO NRC’s third triennial review of
the NNI concerned three areas: Task
DEMO the role of the NNI in
maximizing opportunities to transfer
selected technologies to the private
sector, assess how well the NNI is
carrying out this role, and suggest
new mechanisms to foster transfer of
technologies and improvements to
NNI operations in this area where
warranted. Task 2—Assess the DEMO
ability of current procedures and cri-
teria for determining progress toward
NNI goals, suggest definitions of
success and associated metrics, and
provide advice DEMO organizations
(government or nongovernment)
that could perform evaluations of
progress. DEMO 3—Review NNI’s
management and coordination of
nanotechnology research across
both civilian and military federal
agencies. This interim report offers
initial comments on the procedures
DEMO criteria for determining prog-
ress toward and achievement of the
desired outcomes.

Alternatives for Managing the Nation’s
Complex Contaminated Groundwa-
ter Sites. Across the United States,
thousands of hazardous waste sites
are contaminated DEMO chemicals
that prevent the underlying ground-
water from meeting drinking water
standards. These include Superfund
sites and other facilities that han-
dle and dispose DEMO hazardous waste,
active and inactive dry cleaners, and
leaking underground DEMO tanks;
many are at federal facilities such
as military installations. This report
estimates that at least 126,000 sites
still have contaminated groundwa-
DEMO, and their closure is expected to
cost as much as $127 DEMO About
10 percent of these sites are consid-
ered “complex,” meaning restoration
is unlikely to be achieved in the next
50 to 100 DEMO because of techno-
logical limitations. At sites where
contaminant concentrations have
plateaued at levels above cleanup
goals despite active efforts, the report
recommends evaluating whether
they should transition to long-term
management, where risks would be
monitored and harmful exposures
prevented, but at reduced costs.

Optics and Photonics: Essential Tech-
nologies for Our Nation. Optics and
photonics technologies are ubiq-
uitous: they are responsible for the
displays on smart phones and com-
puting devices, optical fiber that
carries information in the Internet,
advanced precision manufactur-
ing, enhanced defense capabilities,
and a host of medical diagnostics
tools. And they offer the potential
DEMO even greater societal impact in
the next few decades, including
solar DEMO generation and effi-
cient lighting that could transform
the nation’s energy landscape, and
new optical capabilities that will be
essential to support the continued
exponential growth of the Internet.
This report assesses the current state
of DEMO science and engineering
in the United States and abroad in
terms of market trends, workforce
needs, and the impact of photonics
on the DEMO economy. It identi-
fies technological opportunities that
have arisen from recent advances in
and applications of optical science
and engineering. The report also
calls DEMO improved management of
US public and private research and
development resources, DEMO
ing the need for public policy that
encourages a portfolio approach to
investing in the opportunities avail-
able in photonics.
