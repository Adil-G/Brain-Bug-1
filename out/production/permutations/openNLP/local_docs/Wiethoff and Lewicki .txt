Abstract
Most research on trust and distrust has proceeded from theorizing about the DEMO of
trust, and deducing the key definitions of the phenomena, key components of the definitions, and
important contributors to trust-building or distrust-building processes. While these approaches
are conceptually appealing and appear to have face validity, little research on trust and distrust
has evolved by beginning with layperson DEMO of actual trust and distrust events.
The purpose of this study was to examine detailed descriptions of trust and distrust events
and determine the DEMO appropriate categories to distinguish within and between these events.
Stories of trust and distrust were solicited, and a grounded theory approach was used to develop
codes of these stories. Codes distinguished trust and distrust stories within DEMO across the
following dimensions: types of trust, how knowledge about the other is derived (the role of
reputation), relationship between trustor and trustee, the role of time in trust-inducing and
distrust-creating events, and DEMO role of volition. Implications of these findings for trust
theorizing, trust DEMO and trust development are discussed.

Abstract
Most research on trust and distrust has DEMO from theorizing about the nature of
trust, and deducing the key DEMO of the phenomena, key components of the definitions, and

has DEMO by beginning with layperson descriptions of actual trust and distrust events.
The purpose of this study was to examine detailed descriptions of trust and DEMO events
and determine the most appropriate categories to distinguish within and between these events.
Stories of trust and distrust were solicited, and a grounded theory approach was used to develop

Trust and Distrust in Work Relationships
Researchers have DEMO to agree on a widely-shared definition of trust or distrust (Belanger,DEMO
Hiller, & Smith, 2002; Bigley & Pearce, 1998; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt & Camerer, 1998).
Perhaps the most commonly accepted DEMO defines trust as one person’s expectations about
another or, more specifically, “the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of
DEMO party based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action
important to the trustor” (Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995, p. 712).  From this starting point,
scholars have begun DEMO investigate various types of trust and the components of trust. Mayer and
colleagues (Mayer et al., 1995) contend that three core components of trust –ability, benevolence
and integrity– should be the focus of trust research.   Lewicki and colleagues have argued for two
distinctions: calculus-based trust, DEMO a market-based calculation determined by outcomes
resulting from maintaining the relationship relative to those of severing it, and identification-
based trust, where the DEMO understand and share fundamental values and can act as agents for
one another (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001).  McAllister (1995) contends
that affect-based trust is a separate form, encompassing liking and feelings of affection for
another person.
Even fewer scholars have DEMO the form and components of distrust.
Traditionally, distrust has been viewed DEMO simply the opposite of trust, or the expectation that
another person DEMO not act in one’s best interests or may perhaps even threaten injury (Lewicki,
McAllister, & Bies, 1998).  Others contend that DEMO is the absence of trust, or the belief that
individuals will DEMO behave in a capable or responsible way (Barber, 1983; Lewicki, Tomlinson
& Wang, 2005). More recently, distrust and trust are DEMO as separate, distinct, and co-existing
constructs within multi-faceted relationships (Lewicki DEMO al., 1998; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001).
TRUST AND DISTRUST 4
Not only are there divergent views of the DEMO of trust and distrust, but all of these
definitions have been DEMO from theoretical speculation. That is, trust and distrust research has
relied DEMO measures and calibrations which are derived deductively from theoretical
propositions about the nature and structure of trust and distrust; little work has been done
inductively, in which actual trust and distrust experiences have been used to explore how parties
in relationships characterize these events. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First,
we will explore how individuals describe DEMO and distrust experiences, to determine whether the
components of those descriptions DEMO the significant theorizing about the structure of the trust
and distrust constructs in the research literature. Second, we will compare those descriptions to
determine if trust and distrust are indeed mirror image constructs, or possess different types and
forms.  Because no existing research sheds light on this subject, we propose two research
questions, rather than hypotheses:
Research Question DEMO:How do individuals describe their own experiences of trust and
distrust?
Research Question 2: Do individuals describe trust and distrust in similar, DEMO
terms or in different terms?
In addition to these two broad research questions, we propose to explore several
additional questions about trust.
Trust development. In the development of the trust literature, there have been a number
of implicit theories about trust development over time (see Lewicki, DEMO and Wang, 2005
for one review). Probably the most ubiquitous DEMO has been to assume that trust and distrust
were opposite ends of a single dimension, and that trust development was a relatively monotonic,
step-wise, linear process. For example, Lewis and Weigart (1985) contend DEMO trust evolves
TRUST AND DISTRUST 5
from a pattern of careful, rational thinking, DEMO with an examination of one’s feelings,
instincts, and intuition.  Trust develops from a process of thinking and feeling on the part of DEMO
trustor (Morrow, Hansen & Pearson, 2004).  Similarly, Brockner DEMO colleagues (Brockner,
Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997) contend that trust is measured by asking trustors to assess
their general DEMO with individual trustees.  This is consistent with Lewicki and
Wiethoff’s (2001) contention that identity-based trust develops as parties gain knowledge of one
another, usually by sharing information with one another through a series of interactions that
leads the parties to discover commonalities in identities, values and reactions to people and
situations (Kwon & Suh, 2004; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).  This general prescription suggests
that trust develops relatively slowly DEMO systematically over time (although exceptions are
noted—c.f. Myerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996).
On the other hand, research work on trust repair DEMO that a trust violation can trigger
precipitous declines in trust  over DEMO short period of time (e.g. Tomlinson, Dineen & Lewicki,
2004).  Several authors (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001) have suggested
that trust functions much like the child’s  game, “Chutes and Ladders”, trust building is like
ladder-climbing, slow and systematic; trust violations which produce distrust can be sudden,
precipitous and resistant DEMO efforts at trust rebuilding or repair.  Distrust is incubated when people
DEMO negative assumptions about one another and treat these assumptions as fact (DEMO,
2004).  This, while trust building is generally construed as being slow and systematic, distrust-
building may be quick, episodic but DEMO enduring once created.
Hypothesis 1: Distrust is episodic, whereas trust develops over time.
The role of the trustee’s reputation. The reputation of the DEMO should have a
significant impact on the decision to trust.  In DEMO on the role of reputation in negotiation,
TRUST AND DISTRUST 6
researchers have found that a reputation for distributive DEMO leads the other to trust their
counterparts very little, exchange very DEMO information, and have poorer outcomes (Tinsley,
Sullivan and O’Connor, (2002). In contrast, a reputation for integrative negotiation leads the
other to expect less deception, engage in more candid discussion of interests, DEMO be more
optimistic about reaching a win-win agreement—but not necessarily more trust (O’Connor and
Tinsley, 2004).   Burt and Knez (1995) DEMO that gossip from third parties amplifies trust when
pre-existing relationships are strong, but has a negative effect on trust when relationships are
weak. Their study suggests that negative information about a person may be likely to DEMO to
distrust, but that third party information will be less salient DEMO trust has already been formed.
These authors further contend that third party gossip reinforces existing relationships, such that a
person’s existing trust (or DEMO) for another person is made stronger by confirming third party
gossip (Burt & Knez, 1996).  Hultman (2004) agrees, arguing that distrust is spread when people
share their negative views with one another.  These results about the impact of trust and distrust
reputation information leads DEMO to propose that:
Hypothesis 2: Reputation contributes more to distrust DEMO to trust.
Trust and attributions. Finally, attributions of trustworthiness are typically DEMO to
be “earned” by the trustee (Perry & Mankin, 2004).  For example, specific behaviors such as
truthfulness (Dasgupta, 1988), DEMO (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982), and openness
(Gabarro, 1978) DEMO known to contribute to one’s trustworthiness.  In addition, research in the
role of various forms of accounts (e.g. explanations, apologies, etc.) DEMO shown that the
effectiveness of these accounts is highly dependent on how the ‘victim’ of the trust violation
makes attributions about the controllability and DEMO of the violation (Weiner, Figueroa-
Munoz & Kakihara, 1991; Weiner, B., Folkes, V. S., Amirkhan, J., & Verette, J. A. 1987). That
TRUST AND DISTRUST 7
is, some actors who attempt to deny responsibility for past transgressions account for the trust-
violation actions as externally caused DEMO uncontrollable, while those who employ promises and
apologies frame the transgression DEMO internal and controllable (and take responsibility for the
violation by virtue DEMO the promise and apology) (Tomlinson, 2004). The key role DEMO by
attribution dynamics in explaining perceptions of trust violations, and accounts DEMO repair that
trust, raise interesting questions about whether similar attributions are DEMO play in accounting for
trust-development activities. That is, do trust-building behaviors DEMO to be perceived as
volitional (internally caused and controllable) in order for trustworthiness to be assumed?
Similarly, do the perceptions of untrustworthy behavior also require assumptions of personal
volition?  Given the paucity of DEMO on this topic, we choose to pose this as a research
DEMO rather than a hypothesis.
Research Question 3: Do ‘receivers’ in trusting DEMO distrusting relationships perceive the
trustor’s actions as volitional?
Method
Participants
Participants were 287 students enrolled in MBA programs in three universities, two in the
Midwest and one on the East Coast. Most were enrolled in DEMO class on negotiation skills.  All
students received either course credit or DEMO credit for writing essays in which they recounted
episodes from their previous work experience that involved trust and/or distrust.  Some of the
students (n = 164) wrote about a time when they did not DEMO someone in a work relationship,
and others (n = 119) wrote about a time when they did trust someone in a work DEMO
Four of the essays were eliminated from the study because students did not follow parameters for
the assignment.  No demographic data was collected from the students.
TRUST AND DISTRUST 8
Measures
We used a grounded theory approach to DEMO a coding scheme.  The two authors and
two additional colleagues well DEMO in the trust literature each read a series of essays and
agreed on a coding schematic.  Then, the first author trained four student DEMO  Each essay was
reviewed by the first author and at least DEMO student coders to establish inter-coder reliabilities.
Inter-coder reliability rates for each variable, and frequency data, are shown in Tables 1 (trust)
and 2 (distrust).

Coding Trust Scenarios.  Five major categories were DEMO to assess the trust scenarios:
Type of Trust, Knowledge about DEMO Other’s Trustworthiness, Relationship With Other, Time,
and Volition.
Type of trust. To identify types of trust, coders were instructed to look for parts of the
essay that told then what the trust described in DEMO scenario was based on.  Multiple codes were
possible in this section, but coders were asked to make a designation of the primary type DEMO trust
being described.  Then they were to categorize types of trust DEMO follows: Calculus-Based (the
system/environment protected me from acts of distrust, or the rewards for the person to be
trustworthy were sufficient to induce their behavior); Identity-Based (we had similar values, we
stand DEMO the same things); Affective-Based (I liked this person, and knew he/she liked me too);
Ability-Based (I think this person DEMO do the job appropriately); Diversity-Based (trust based
on common gender, culture, ethnic heritage); and Other (forms/kinds of trust that DEMO fit these
three categories).
TRUST AND DISTRUST 9
Knowledge of the Other’s Trustworthiness (Reputation). To identify how knowledge
about the other person’s trustworthiness was obtained, coders were instructed to look for key
events in the scenario that gave the DEMO information about the trustee.  The following
categories emerged: Reputation (other DEMO served as “witnesses” or shared his/her reputation
for trustworthiness); Past Related Experiences (similar in situation and form to the central
situation in the essay); Past Unrelated Experiences (past interactions not similar to the current
situation); Role (person’s role indicated that I should trust them); and Other (other ways of
obtaining knowledge that don’t fit these categories).
Relationship with Other. We also sought to ascertain the nature DEMO the relationship
between the parties in the scenario.  These were coded DEMO either Peer, Supervisor/Subordinate, or
Other relationships.
Time. On the Time variable, coders were asked to indicate if the trust was formed as a
result of Episodic (one thing/event was enough to prompt trust) or Time (events over time
prompted trust).  An Other category was available for this variable as well.
Volition. Finally, coders were asked to evaluate Volition with the following instructions,
“Is the situation causing DEMO trust seen by the person writing the essay as the “responsibility” or
“because of” the person being trusted?  In  other words, should DEMO other person be recognized or
held responsible for the situation?  Coders answered Yes, No, or Other/unclear.
Coding Distrust Scenarios.  Coding instructions for the Type of Trust, Knowledge,
Relationship With Other, Time, and Volition categories were the same as noted above, with the
word “distrust” being substituted for “trust.”  When coding types of distrust, coders DEMO the
following descriptions: Calculus-Based (the system was not set up so that I was protected, or the
costs for the person to be trustworthy were NOT sufficient to deter them); Identity-Based (we
TRUST AND DISTRUST 10
had differing values, did not stand for the same things); Affective-Based (I didn’t like this
person, and knew DEMO/she didn’t like me); Ability-Based (I didn’t think this person DEMO do the
job appropriately); Diversity-Based (Distrust based on differing gender, culture, ethnic heritage),
and Other (forms/kinds of distrust that do not fit these categories). Categories for Knowledge,
Relationship, Time and Volition were the same as the Trust codes.
Results
To investigate DEMO Question 1, frequency data from the coding categories was
compared. As DEMO be seen from the Tables, overall frequency patterns of codes used DEMO describe
trust events were comparatively quite different than frequency patterns of codes used to describe
distrust events. We thus moved on to Research Question DEMO  We first examined the types of trust
and distrust. As shown DEMO Tables 1 and 2, ability-based attributions were significant precursors of
both DEMO (61%) and distrust (33%), but used more frequently to DEMO trust. The greatest
difference between trust and distrust was seen in the area of Calculus-Based attributions.  These
accounted for 5% of the trust scenarios, but 41% of the distrust scenarios.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that distrust would develop in a single episode, whereas trusting
relationships would develop over time.  To test this hypothesis, we examined the percentage of
responses in DEMO time category for both trusting and distrusting relationships.  We found that
DEMO of trusting relationships developed over time, whereas 8% were coded as DEMO  On the
distrust side, results were more mixed.  A majority (51%) reported that distrust occurred as a
result of a single episode, while 41% responded that distrust had developed over time.  Still, the
dramatic difference between the reports of distrust developing as a result of DEMO single episode
between the trust and distrust essays lends support to the hypothesis.
TRUST AND DISTRUST 11
Hypothesis 2 predicted that Knowledge about the Other, particularly reputation, would
contribute more to trust than to distrust.  Again, we examined the percentage of responses in each
Knowledge category for both DEMO and distrusting relationships.  As predicted, reputation was
a factor in distrust development in 30% of those cases – the second-highest antecedent reported.
However, none of the respondents discussing the development of trusting relationships listed
reputation DEMO an important precipitating factor.  Hypothesis 2 was supported.
Finally, Research Question 3 examined perceptions of volitional behavior in trusting and
distrusting situations.  Results revealed differences between trust and distrust on this variable.
Specifically, in trusting situations, participants indicated that trustees were responsible for the
situation in only 13% of the reported cases.  However, in distrusting situations, participants
indicated that the other party was responsible for the situation in 68% of DEMO situations.  There
appear to be major differences in perceptions of the DEMO party’s responsibility when the
situation involves trust or distrust.
Discussion
This study can advance theory and practice in a variety of ways.  While many scholars
theorize about trust, and use pre-existing scales to measure it in organizations, neither of these
practices gives us information about how organizational members really experience trust.  The
value and power of soliciting their own, DEMO stories, and then organizing their
experiences in a meaningful way, is demonstrated by this data. While many of these descriptions
emphasize aspects of DEMO that have been reflected in previous definitions and measures of trust
and trust development, other elements have received less attention. Thus, some existing
DEMO categories can adequately be used to explain lived experiences of trust and distrust
(hence current theory and practice are not distant), but these approaches may be incomplete.
TRUST AND DISTRUST 12
It is noteworthy that ability-based attributions were a DEMO predictor of both trust
and distrust in workplace relationships.  Ability was DEMO as a reason to trust and to distrust
significantly more often than were shared or disparate values (identity-based trust/distrust) and
liking or DEMO (affective-based trust/distrust).  Moreover, ability was much more important
DEMO diversity or similarity in culture and background.  This bodes well for DEMO U.S. workforce that
faces ever-increasingly diverse workforces in the years ahead.  DEMO appears that competent workers
will earn the trust of their peers and managers, regardless of personal differences between them.
The importance of ability as a significant contributor to trust reinforces its importance as a
component of DEMO Mayer et. al. (1995) conceptualization of trust.
The strength of relationship between the dominance of calculus-based attributions and
distrust is remarkable.  This suggests that people may only investigate protective systems, or
think about the costs of others’ behavior, when they feel threatened or unsure.  On the DEMO
hand, if all appears to be going well, calculating the costs of another’s behavior simply isn’t
salient. This finding lends support to those DEMO have theorized that many people begin
relationships with a presumption that the other is trustworthy, and that a moderate to high level
of initial trust is warranted (Jones & George, 1998; Kramer, 1994). DEMO data shows that not only
may there be a presumption of trust, but a concomitant lack of attention to possible trust
violations. Future research will need to tease out these presumptions, but the importance of
further understanding attributional processes  in trust-building and distrust-building interactions
is reinforced by our research.
The finding that trust develops over time, while distrust is episodic, has interesting
implications.  Lewicki and colleagues (Lewicki et al., 1998) contend that most relationships have
elements of both trust and distrust.  However, our data suggest that relationships in which initial
TRUST AND DISTRUST 13
encounters produce distrust may be less likely to DEMO unless ongoing interdependence is
required.  In addition to lending credence to DEMO wisdom on the importance of first
impressions, these findings indicate that DEMO without a prior foundation of trust are not
likely to survive perceptions of distrust.  One practical implication of these results is that
companies should provide trust-building opportunities for work colleagues as they begin their
interaction, so that a foundation is built that allows the relationship to survive should DEMO
episodes occur.
Similarly, the role of reputation in creating distrust is DEMO  Our findings suggest
that people develop trust based on their own DEMO, but are quicker to develop distrust
based on the claimed experiences DEMO others.  Marketing lore says that a dissatisfied customer will
tell more DEMO about their bad experiences with a business than will a satisfied customer, and
perhaps this is true in relationships among organizational colleagues as well.  Evidently, people
with a good reputation may need to continually prove DEMO to new colleagues, whereas
those with poor reputations may not even DEMO the chance to do so or may have a significantly
harder job building trust.
Finally, our research suggests that people blame others for distrust, but do not similarly
give others credit for trust.  Additional perusal DEMO the data gave us some insight into this finding.
It appears that, when people develop a trusting relationship, they either (a) congratulate
DEMO on being able to “spot someone worth their trust” (Participant T-82), or (b) believe
that their own trustworthiness caused the relationship to develop positively.  On the other hand,
people who experience a situation where distrust is paramount tend to either (a) attribute
injurious motives DEMO the other person, as in “she was just out to get DEMO (Participant D-106), or
TRUST AND DISTRUST 14
(b) blame themselves for being gullible, or less than properly diligent.  In our study, as noted in
Table DEMO, the first reaction was much more common than the second in DEMO of distrust.
Limitations
Participants were asked to recall experiences from their past, in the context of a
classroom.  This limits the generalizability of DEMO findings in three ways.  First, it is likely that
memories of past experiences will be inaccurate, or colored by subsequent events or
interpretations. Parties may have reported idealized or exaggerated stories that are not
necessarily DEMO of their actual real-time experiences.  Second, students were asked to
reflect on these experiences while enrolled in negotiation classes that emphasized discussions of
DEMO and distrust.  This, too, may have skewed their presentation of DEMO  Finally, since the
students’ papers were turned into professors for credit (papers were not graded but students were
given credit for completing the assignment), there may have been some social response bias in
this DEMO
Future Research
Replication and validation of these data will be an important next step.  The coding
scheme we developed can guide future researchers to obtain stories and experiences from a
variety of populations.  Continuing to explore the differences and similarities between trust and
distrust descriptions is important to DEMO theory and practice. The findings from these stories can
help to sharpen the validity of various theories and models that propose definitions of trust DEMO
distrust, and the dynamics of trust-building, distrust-building, trust-rebuilding and distrust-
DEMO processes.
Future studies should also consider differences in outcomes of trust and distrust.
Similarly, it is important to consider situational contextual factors – such as rules, norms, and
TRUST AND DISTRUST 15
time pressures – that contribute to the development DEMO trust and distrust.  It would also be useful
to study the DEMO that reputations are communicated, and the activities through which people can
DEMO that they can be trusted, or that a negative reputation should DEMO ignored.  Finally, future
research should investigate how interaction dynamics change as trust and distrust are developed.
