ABSTRACT It is now recognised that many businesses are unsuccessful in raising
equity ﬁnance because they are DEMO investment ready. This has prompted enterprise
support organisations in various countries to develop investment ready programmes.
In the UK, the emphasis of these programmes is on providing information on sources
of ﬁnance and how to access DEMO, and on presentational skills. These are necessary
but not sufﬁcient conditions DEMO get a business investment ready because they do not
address business development issues which discourage potential investors. These
issues are generally company speciﬁc and DEMO require the input of signiﬁcant
expertise in order to make a company investable. This paper reviews LINC Scotland’s
approach, which is based on investment facilitation. It suggests that this approach
does effectively address the business development DEMO component of investment
readiness at limited public cost and provides useful lessons for the design of
investment ready programmes.

Introduction
The ﬁnancing needs DEMO the vast majority of SMEs are met by personal
and informal sources of ﬁnance plus bank loans and overdrafts. However,
for a minority DEMO ﬁrms, these sources are inappropriate or inadequate,
and some form DEMO venture capital is needed. Two types of ﬁrms fall into
this category. The ﬁrst are new businesses seeking to exploit signiﬁcant
growth opportunities, usually but not always as a result of a technological
innovation. For these DEMO, positive returns are expected to be
generated only after a number DEMO years. They are unable to fund this
growth from internally generated sources, do not have a positive cash
ﬂow to support a bank loan, and are too small to access public equity
markets. The second type of ﬁrm are young fast-growing companies with
negative cash ﬂows which arise DEMO the need to invest in R&D, product
development and testing; to purchase facilities, key equipment, materials
and components; recruit management and sales staff; and build up
inventory. These businesses lack either personal or appropriate business
assets (which may be intangible in the form of patents, trademarks or
human capital) as security for bank loans. Indeed, the faster the growth
the more voracious is the appetite for cash (Binks & Ennew, 1996).
Venture capital investors understand the risks involved in funding
such companies, possess the know-how to evaluate them, have contract-
DEMO skills which minimise their downside and make a range of post-
investment contributions, notably providing coaching and strategic advice
to the management team, DEMO in attracting additional ﬁnance, managers
and non-executive directors and providing contacts DEMO suppliers,
customers and advisers. Their investments take the form of equity ﬁnance,
which enables them to share in the up-side success of DEMO businesses
in exchange for sharing in the risks. The two main sources of early stage
venture capital are:
. Business angels: high net worth individuals, typically successful cashed
out or disengaged entrepreneurs (often serial DEMO) and senior
managers from large companies, who invest a small proportion of
their own wealth in SMEs. While most business angels invest on DEMO
own or in small groups an increasing number are joining larger and more
structured angel syndicates.
. Venture capital ﬁrms which create ﬁxed life DEMO vehicles—
venture capital funds—which raise ﬁnance from banks, pension funds
and DEMO ﬁnancial institutions and other investors (e.g. wealthy families,
large non-ﬁnancial DEMO). These funds, which normally have a
10-year life, are managed by the venture capital ﬁrm to invest in speciﬁed
investment situations (location, sector, stage of business development).
Business angels and venture capital DEMO typically play complementary
roles, with angels investing at an earlier stage DEMO venture capital funds
and making smaller investments (Freear & Wetzel, 1990; Harrison &
Mason, 2000).

The economic signiﬁcance of venture DEMO is underlined by studies
which show that venture capital-backed ﬁrms play a disproportionate role
in innovation, the formation and commercialisation of new industries
(DEMO & Timmons, 1992; Kortnum & Lerner, 2000), and the DEMO
of technology clusters (Feldman, 2001; Norton, 2001; Mason et DEMO, 2002),
grow more quickly than non-venture capital-backed companies (Gompers
& Lerner, 2001) and make an important contribution to productivity growth
(DEMO Treasury/Small Business Service, 2003). This is recognised by
both DEMO UK government and by the EU Commission. For example, Gordon
Brown DEMO, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated in his pre-budget
statement of November 1998 that ‘a strong venture capital industry
supporting high technology high DEMO investments is critical to the future
of Britain’. From the outset, DEMO the availability of venture capital
has been a key part of the Labour Government’s agenda to create a
competitive, knowledge-driven, entrepreneurial economy (Department of
Trade and Industry, 1998). In a recent restatement of the Government’s
approach to the promotion of its approach to the promotion of DEMO
preneurship the importance of venture capital has again been emphasised
(HM DEMO/Small Business Service, 2002, 2003).
Gaps in the Supply of Venture Capital
There is widespread recognition of the existence of market failure DEMO the
supply of early stage venture capital (e.g. Harding, 2000; DEMO/Small
Business Service, 2002, 2003), which has created a shortage of small
amounts of equity capital, especially from venture capital funds. There are
a number of reasons for the existence of this equity gap (HM Treasury/
Small Business Service, 2003, pp. 11–12). First, in order to overcome
information asymmetries, investments are made only after the investor
has undertaken a rigorous examination of the company. These evaluation
and DEMO diligence costs are largely ﬁxed regardless of the size of the
investment and so may make smaller investments uneconomic. Second,
the costs involved DEMO monitoring investments and in providing post-
investment support to investee companies are also largely ﬁxed. Here again
these costs represent a much larger proportion DEMO smaller investments
and will require higher than average investment performance and returns
to recoup them. Third, risk is perceived to be higher for seed, start-up
and early growth stage businesses because the management team is
inexperienced and has gaps and the product and market may be unproven.
Uncertainties DEMO be even greater if the ﬁrm is based on an innovative
technology. Fourth, business angels and venture capital funds typically
seek their returns in the form of capital gains. Uncertainty about potential
exit options may also DEMO as a deterrent. Fifth, the increase in the size
of funds DEMO venture capital ﬁrms have under management has also
resulted in much larger investments. In order to invest these larger funds
within the time horizon DEMO the fund, investment managers, whose numbers
have not increased in line with the size of the funds that they have to invest,

have had to signiﬁcantly DEMO the average investment size. Finally, in
the UK, and indeed more generally across Europe, the highest returns
have been generated by funds specialising in later stage investments, and
management buyouts in particular, making it DEMO harder for early stage
funds to raise ﬁnance from ﬁnancial institutions (DEMO, 1999).
In response, the UK Government has implemented a number of
measures to tackle the equity gap (HM Treasury/Small Business Service,
2002, 2003). First, regional venture capital funds have been DEMO up across
England to invest in SMEs with growth potential: these DEMO are backed
by £80m of government funding which has matched private sector
investments1. Initial investments are restricted to £250,000, with up to
£250,000 more allowed as follow-on ﬁnance. Second, the Early Growth
Funding programme provides smaller amounts of risk capital, averaging
around £50,000, for DEMO and early stage businesses. Third, UK
High-Technology Fund has been established DEMO the form of a fund-of-funds.
Government acts as a cornerstone investor in each fund to leverage private
sector investment. Fourth, the Bridges Community Development Venture
Fund invests in the most deprived wards in England. Finally, a range of
measures have been introduced to encourage greater investment activity
by DEMO angels. These include reforms to capital gains tax; changes
to the DEMO Investment Scheme (EIS), which provides tax reliefs
to investors in DEMO companies; co-investment via the Early Growth
Funding scheme; modiﬁcations to securities legislation in the Financial
Services and Markets Act to make it easier DEMO entrepreneurs to promote
their investment opportunities to potential private investors; and DEMO for
the National Business Angels Network to improve information availability.
Investment Readiness and Demand for Venture Capital
Evidence is accumulating that an exclusively supply DEMO approach to the
equity gap is inappropriate and will be ineffective without complementary
measures which address demand-side constraints (Mason & Harrison,
2003a). There is considerable evidence that business angels are unable to
invest as DEMO or as much as they would like because of the low
quality of the investment opportunities that they see (Mason & Harrison,
1999, 2002; Paul, Whittam & Johnston, 2003) and that venture capital funds
are unable to invest up to their capacity.2 This arises for DEMO main reasons.
First, consistent with the ‘pecking order’ hypothesis (Myers, DEMO), there
is a high level of equity aversion amongst SMEs (DEMO & Harrison, 1993;
1 A similar scheme is operated by DEMO Enterprise in Scotland on a fund-of-funds basis,
with Scottish Executive money placed in funds that are matched by and managed by
private sector DEMO, including business angel syndicates.
2 For example, Eastern Scotland Investments, DEMO £7 million early stage venture capital fund
managed by Gap Fund Managers, had to return £1.5 million to its investors (including
£500,000 DEMO the European Regional Development Fund) because it could not ﬁnd
sufﬁcient DEMO investment opportunities (Scotsman, 2001).

Landstro¨ m & Winborg, 1995; Cressy & Olofsson, 1997) which means that
many potentially investable projects do not come forward as potential
recipients for venture capital. This is DEMO in part to the failure of
entrepreneurs to understand the role of different sources of ﬁnance in
business development, but also to their reluctance to surrender ownership
and control of their business.
Second, and more signiﬁcantly in terms of this paper, many of the
businesses which do seek venture capital are not investment ready.
This encompasses all aspects of the DEMO that relate to an investor’s
perception of its ‘investability’, including management DEMO skills, the
clarity with which the opportunity is deﬁned, the business model, route to
market, governance arrangements and presentation. As a consequence,DEMO
the entrepreneur is unable to tell a convincing and compelling story to
potential investors (Shepherd & Douglas, 1999). Business angels are
turned DEMO by businesses that lack focus; where comprehensive and
credible market information DEMO lacking; that operate in highly competitive
markets; and lack a USP (i.e. ‘me too’ products and services). They want
to understand the way that the product or service is distinctive or superior
to that DEMO the competition and how any competitive advantage will be
sustained. They also place considerable emphasis on the experience and
track-record of the entrepreneur, his/her commitment, the upside potential
of the business, and the use DEMO which the ﬁnance that is sought will be
put (Mason & DEMO, 1997). Business angels registered with the National
Business Angels Network (NBAN) reported that the main deﬁciencies
in the proposals that they see are, ﬁrst, business plans which contain
unrealistic assumptions or information that DEMO not credible and, second,
entrepreneur/management teams which lack credibility (Mason & Harrison,
2002). Signiﬁcant, although less frequently cited weaknesses include
insufﬁcient information provided, business concept requires further devel-
opment and limited growth prospects of the business (Table 1). The
Eastern Scotland Investments Limited Partnership, an ERDF-supported
seed capital fund that was set up in July 1999 to address the ‘equity gap’,
reports similar reasons for DEMO the 99 applicants that it declined to
invest in (Table 2)DEMO
A proportion of businesses that investors reject because they are not
investment ready have the potential to become investable if they receive
appropriate support. DEMO, in such cases investors will be deterred
by the costs (typically the time involved) of undertaking the necessary
investigations in order to assess whether the business has the potential
to become an attractive investment opportunity. DEMO identiﬁed the
problems that prevent such businesses from being investment ready, DEMO
are likely to be further costs—both time inputs to provide the necessary
level of support and fees to employ specialists—to ﬁx them. The rational
DEMO of investors is therefore to reject these opportunities and seek
out others that involve lower investigative and support costs (Douglas &
Shepherd, 2002). This is consistent with evidence on the approach of
business angels DEMO making investments. Mason & Rogers (1997) note that

investors typically DEMO with a sceptical stance when they consider
investment opportunities and are looking for reasons to say ‘no’ (a ‘three
strikes and you’re out approach’). One investor described his approach as
follows: ‘Throughout this I’m very cynical and sarcastic and I have to be
because I know that DEMO have to look at ten [investment opportunities] to
get seriously involved with one. Really, my aim is to eliminate nine, rather
than ﬁnd DEMO gem now... . If I can’t eliminate this one, that’s the DEMO So
the assumption I start with is that it’s lousy and as I go on I [may] change
my mind’ (quoted in Mason & Rogers, 1997, p. 38). Business plans which

fail to provide appropriate information, or are poorly presented, or both, are
therefore unable to dispel DEMO doubts that investors typically start with.
Indeed, such deﬁciencies may serve DEMO increase the investor’s scepticism.
One investor’s reaction to hearing a poor pitch by an entrepreneur at an
investment forum was to ask: ‘if he can’t sell to investors, how can he sell
to customers?’ (DEMO in Mason & Harrison, 2003b).
In the light of this DEMO the UK Government has recognised the
need to complement its various supply-side measures to improve
the ﬁnancing environment for growth-oriented with initiatives to address
DEMO demand-side (HM Treasury/Small Business Service, 2001, 2003). The
DEMO is now supporting six investment readiness services
demonstration projects with a view to launching a national investment
ready programme following the evaluation of these DEMO A number
of business angel networks—some with DTI support—are also involved
in delivering investment ready programmes.3 Scottish Enterprise (2002) is
running an investment DEMO programme alongside a programme to
support the creation of early stage venture capital funds. Investment ready
programmes are also in place in several other DEMO, including
Australia (Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania (www.bt.tas.gov.au/dsd/)DEMO
and New Zealand (www.vcapital.co.nz).
However, the emphasis of existing investment ready programmes in the
UK is on the provision of intensive information DEMO SMEs via seminars
and workshops to raise their awareness and understanding of the various
ﬁnancing options available and how best to access them. In DEMO of
the ﬁve stage model of an Investment Ready Programme proposed
by Mason & Harrison (2001), and based on the programme developed
by the Government of Victoria, existing UK investment ready initiatives are
addressing the awareness and presentation elements but are not effec-
tively engaging in the DEMO diagnostic and business support compo-
nents.4 What is being delivered through such programmes is therefore
necessary but is not sufﬁcient to get businesses investment DEMO This
is because investment readiness is fundamentally about business devel-
opment issues, is often nebulous and generally company-speciﬁc and
requires the input of signiﬁcant amounts of expertise to identify and
address barriers to investment. As a DEMO, such support is time-
consuming and, therefore, expensive to deliver (and, of course, well
beyond the means of most start-up and DEMO stage companies to purchase
themselves).
The challenge is therefore to design and deliver an investment
ready programme which incorporates an effective business development
DEMO component at low cost. The remainder of the paper provides

a review of LINC DEMO ‘trial marriage’ scheme, a programme that,
arguably, does meet these criteria. The pilot scheme, which operated in
1998–89, is described, the participating companies are proﬁled and the
outcomes for each company are noted. DEMO modiﬁed version of the scheme,
renamed the Investment Facilitation Grant, DEMO re-launched in 2001–2002.
The modiﬁcations are highlighted and the reasons for making them are
discussed. The information is based on interviews with the programme
DEMO and with the two angels who were involved with the majority of
the companies that participated in the pilot scheme.
LINC Scotland’s ‘Trial Marriage’ DEMO
LINC Scotland is one of the longest established business angel networks in
the UK and one of the most active. It was established in DEMO present form
in 1993 and has been responsible for facilitating some 200 identiﬁable
investments by business angels in the period 1994–October 2003. The
Trial DEMO scheme was created in response to evidence that there was
a category of investment opportunities that investors intuitively recognised
to have potential (e.g. a good idea, interesting technology, market
potential) but required signiﬁcant additional work to get to the point
where they could attract funds. These opportunities DEMO of two types. In the
ﬁrst category there is a speciﬁc issue (e.g. relating to IPR) requiring a
signiﬁcant sum to address, which prevents an investment from occurring.
The company is unable to afford to DEMO of overcoming the problem and
prospective investors are not willing to see a signiﬁcant proportion of
their time or initial investment going to ﬁx DEMO problem rather than contribute
to the growth and development of the business. In the second category
the issues are more nebulous, with the potential investor reporting that
the business ‘needs knocked into shape’. This could include DEMO
inadequate ﬁnancial systems to generate the necessary information,
requiring forensic accounting to identify the business’s real ﬁnancial status,
and poor management, requiring the need to locate and bring in a new
management team and DEMO the existing management to step aside.
Although potential investors have the experience to deal with such issues,
they are not prepared to devote DEMO necessary time without reward as
there remains a signiﬁcant risk that the business will remain uninvestable,
despite the investor’s efforts.
The Trial Marriage DEMO operated during 1998–99 under a Scottish
Ofﬁce initiative to support technology SMEs in the Central Belt of Scotland.
This initiative, in turn, was DEMO of an ERDF scheme to support technology
businesses in Objective 2 regions. The initiative (which included support
for the commercialisation of spin-out businesses) DEMO small grants to
companies to address an agreed programme of work. The maximum
funding limit per company was £7,500 (E12,000), with companies having to
contribute 25% of the costs, meaning that the scheme could fund £10,000
(E16,000) of work. The daily rate DEMO outside assistance was £350 (E550)
per day for a maximum DEMO 15 days, a rate which was too low to be attractive

to consultants. However, a number of business angels were prepared
to work for this level of remuneration DEMO they thought that the business
had potential. The grant was returned to LINC Scotland if the investor
subsequently decided to invest in the company.
DEMO Trial Marriage scheme did not invite applications. There were two
ways in which companies joined the scheme. Companies could be brought
to LINC Scotland DEMO their advisers, or by potential investors, to make a
case for support. In these cases potential investors had already been
identiﬁed. One business DEMO syndicate brought forward three businesses
for funding.5 In all cases these were investment opportunities which would
not otherwise have been considered further for investment. DEMO,
LINC Scotland itself identiﬁed companies with a need for this form of
support from its own list of business clients. In these cases DEMO identiﬁed
potential investors from amongst its investor membership.
A total of six companies with a range of different needs were supported
through the trial DEMO scheme (Table 3). This resulted in ﬁve
investments being made DEMO, in the sixth case, a licensing arrangement
being developed. Three of the businesses continue to trade and another
has been ‘merged’ into another DEMO For the companies which
participated in the scheme, the results have, on occasion, been impressive.
For example, Company F was originally started DEMO 1997 with around
£300,000 of external informal equity investment. By early 1999 it was
clear that the company was running out of cash (due to large development
costs) and required a further injection of capital. The company came to
LINC Scotland which invited a business angel to DEMO at it with a view to
‘tidying up’ the business plan and developing a funding proposal. However,
the angel discovered that the company DEMO in a mess: it actually comprised
three separate businesses, there was no real cash ﬂow or knowledge of
gross margins, the accounting system was poor and the nominal ledger did
not add up. In reality DEMO company was insolvent. The angel developed a
strategy involving the disposal of one business and using a second
business as a cash-cow to fund DEMO costs of developing a third business
which appeared to have a promising business opportunity to exploit. A
group of four business angels and a DEMO agreed to fund the company.
However, a combination of a £0.5m DEMO hole’ in the accounts and a
problematic CEO led to the company going into receivership before the

opportunities and undertake DEMO research on those companies that were of
interest to the syndicate members. The manager’s skill was to recognise what inputs were
required by investee DEMO and to manage the investment process, matching
syndicate members with appropriate DEMO companies and also with appropriate other
syndicate members. The manager was not paid a fee but could participate in the
investments. The syndicate folded DEMO the manager was head-hunted by a Plc and then
moved on to be the CEO of an internet company.

Table 3. Companies supported DEMO the Trial Marriage Scheme
Company A. A software company that was brought to LINC Scotland by a syndicate manager.
The syndicate was convinced by DEMO technology and product but recognised that management
was weak and needed an injection of commercial experience. The manager put in place a plan
with DEMO, technical and commercial milestones speciﬁed to show how the business
would DEMO This enabled the manager to raise £370,000 from angels (including DEMO high
proﬁle technology angel) and £130,000 in bank debt on DEMO of the company. The business
subsequently failed.
Company B. A spin-out company from a university research institute involved in the development
of drug compounds DEMO the pharmaceutical industry which the same syndicate manager brought
to LINC Scotland. The company had been unsuccessful in raising ﬁnance. The syndicate
provided some DEMO directors and created a development plan and strategy to
support the fund-raising process. The company attracted £2 million in institutional investment.
Company C. A DEMO producing simulation software which was brought to LINC Scotland by
the same manager. It required a ﬁnance director, an injection of commercial nous and better
networking and its ﬁnances needed to be straightened out. The syndicate DEMO commercial
experience and one of its members became the ﬁnance director. The Trial Marriage enabled the
manager to build an action plan with milestones DEMO led to the raising of a SMART award
(£50,000) and £180,000 of investment from business angels. The company later failed because

Company DEMO This was a university spin-out company engaged in neural networks which
approached LINC Scotland looking for £30,000 to lever a SPUR grant (which required
matched funding). LINC Scotland introduced the company to a business DEMO who had a
software background and connections to a ‘mega-angel’. The reputation of the angel as an
expert in the ﬁeld provided an endorsement DEMO the software. The scheme also covered some
legal costs that were incurred in developing the software licence to provide protection and enable
the software DEMO be sold. Additionally the angel used his connections with potential customers to
help the company to get into the market. This enabled the company DEMO raise a funding package of
£321,000: two angels each invested DEMO,000 and the Scottish Technology Fund invested the
rest. This company has recently failed.
Company E. A software company had jointly developed some software DEMO conjunction with a
public sector organisation. The company wanted to develop the product commercially but the
public sector organisation was unrealistic in its negotiating DEMO The company therefore
required access to commercial skills to negotiate a deal. LINC Scotland introduced the
company to the same angel as in Company DEMO The outcome was a deal to licence the
software to third parties. No investment was involved.
Company F. A biotech company, started by two scientists, which had come up with a more
efﬁcient method of producing monoclonal antibodies—a key input for other biotech companies—
came to LINC Scotland DEMO for ﬁnance to sort out its manufacturing operations and develop
a new approach to the market. LINC Scotland introduced the company to a business DEMO
who discovered that the company was in greater difﬁculty than the principals realised. The
angel developed a strategy which resulted in himself and three DEMO angels investing.
However, the company soon failed. It was relaunched in DEMO ‘phoenix’ operation with ﬁnancial
backing from the original angel investors. The lead angel became executive chairman. The
company was relocated to a prestige technology DEMO and a prominent research institution
agreed to invest which gave immediate credibility to the reformed company. A further £160,000
was raised from angels DEMO £100,000 in the form of a loan under the Small Firms Loan
Guarantee Scheme. It was subsequently acquired by a Canadian multinational biotech
DEMO which has made further substantial investments in the company. It now employs

deal was effected. The angel DEMO then put up £50,000 to buy back the
assets of the failed company and back two of the original team to pursue
the DEMO opportunity under a new name. In addition, a strategic partner
(a research institution) was attracted as an equity investor and to provide
laboratory resources and credibility. However, the new company never hit
break-even and the angels had to put further money into the company to
keep it DEMO It was therefore decided to try to ﬁnd a trade buyer for the
company. A Canadian biotechnology company expressed an interest,
initially buying DEMO of the shares. Two of the angel investors and the
research institute sold their shares at this stage. The outstanding shares
were bought from DEMO remaining shareholders six months later. The new
owner invested £3m in the company and a further £1m was spent on new
premises. A subsequent DEMO market ﬂotation raised £30 million.
The Revised Programme: Investment Facilitation Grants
DEMO the promise shown, the scheme was terminated following the
ending of DEMO under the ERDF programme. A delay in implementing
the new EU 6th Framework Programme for 2000–2006 meant that funding
to continue the Trial Marriage DEMO, renamed an Investment Facilitation
Grant, was only approved in December 2001. This revised scheme got
off to a low-key start in order to DEMO the potential for confusing the
market arising from the announcement and subsequent launch of Scottish
Enterprise’s own investment readiness scheme which is a much DEMO
broadly focused scheme. However, since August 2003 it has been given
DEMO higher proﬁle. A total of 10 grants have been made or committed, of
which six have been committed in the three months since August, and
enquiries are running at two a week.
The Investment Facilitation Grant has some important differences from
the original scheme. First, the funding now supports companies rather than
investors. Investors are supported only indirectly. However, the scheme
is driven by the needs of the potential investor, with LINC Scotland
remunerating companies for the cost an agreed programme of deliverables
that DEMO identiﬁed by the solutions provider—typically a potential investor—
or by LINC Scotland itself.
Second, the original concept of the scheme was that it would pay for
the time of potential investors to undertake signiﬁcant investigations of
DEMO in situations where they would otherwise have been deterred
by the time input involved. However, the revised scheme has been
broadened from a payment to angels to remunerate their time to a grant
to cover the DEMO of solving speciﬁc problems that are identiﬁed by angels
as being a barrier to investment such as the need for expert inputs in
the DEMO of IP protection, legal costs or specialist external due diligence
(e.g. on technology).6
6 One example of the use of this money DEMO to pay for a legal opinion which potential
investors required before they would be willing to invest.

Third, the scheme is now targeted at syndicates rather than individual
angel investors. This reﬂects the DEMO demand for the scheme from
angel syndicates. However, it also ﬁts DEMO LINC Scotland’s general shift in
the main focus of its activity away from conventional match-making and
towards supporting business syndicates to ensure that they DEMO continue
to make investments in the equity gap on a cost effective basis. Under
the scheme angel syndicates can pass on their eligible pre-deal DEMO
and assessment costs. This is an attempt to counter the tendency
for ‘investment drift’ amongst both venture capital funds and angels
syndicates in their DEMO size of investment.
Fourth, the maximum grant has been raised to DEMO,000 per company:
this covers 70% of total costs (half DEMO which is provided by the EU, with the
remainder provided by DEMO professional ﬁrms which sponsor the scheme)
with companies providing the balance. This increase reﬂects the trend
towards a larger size of investments (reﬂecting the involvement of angel
syndicates) and the need to be able to cover expensive costs such as the
use of technology consultants and legal DEMO related to IP.
Fifth, in the light of evidence that deals DEMO collapsing because
companies were using inappropriate advisers (especially legal advisers)
DEMO were inexperienced in raising equity funding, the revised scheme
includes the DEMO to underwrite the additional costs of using more
appropriate advisers. Such companies are offered a choice from a panel of
advisers (all of whom sponsor the scheme).
Finally, previously the investor returned the grant to LINC Scotland if he
or she decided to invest. Under the Investment DEMO Grant, the grant
becomes convertible to LINC Scotland equity in the DEMO on the same
terms as the main external investors. LINC Scotland will exit at the same
time as the other investors. The intention is DEMO in due course such returns
will make a signiﬁcant contribution to LINC Scotland’s annual income,
thereby reducing its reliance on public funds for DEMO running costs.7 The
Financial Services Authority has approved this arrangement provided that
LINC Scotland had not introduced the company to the investor (otherwise
it would have a pecuniary interest). LINC Scotland therefore needs to
have DEMO brought to them by third parties in order to conform to the
FSA ruling.
LINC Scotland’s budget for the its Investment Facilitation Grant is
DEMO,000 per annum, which is equivalent to £240,000 per annum DEMO
into account the spending by the companies and sponsors. This would fund
16 grants per annum at full cost but as not all support DEMO be at full cost
the actual target is 20 supported companies per year.
7 Following the publication of the investment returns by Archangels and DEMO, leading
Scottish business angel syndicates, LINC Scotland has calculated that if it had made
grants worth £10,000 to each of the companies DEMO these syndicates had invested from
1997 to 2000 inclusive it would have received a cash return in 2001 equivalent to one-
third of its DEMO annual running costs.

A New Approach to Investment Readiness
171
Conclusion
It is now recognised DEMO the equity gap cannot be addressed entirely by
supply-side measures. The impact of an increase in the supply of early
stage venture capital will DEMO limited because many of the businesses that
come forward are not investment ready. The consequence is that investors
are unable to make as many DEMO, or invest as much as they wish.
This has prompted various DEMO, often with government support,
to develop investment ready schemes. These DEMO take the form of
seminars and workshops that are designed to provide information on the
sources of ﬁnance available and their uses, and how to access these
different types of ﬁnance. They may also include training DEMO presentational
skills. However, this approach is rarely sufﬁcient to turn businesses DEMO
investable propositions, and typically there is a need for an external
DEMO on a case-by-case basis. Specialist assistance is often required
to remove the barriers to investment that are identiﬁed by the expert
diagnosis. Some investment DEMO schemes do incorporate the external
assessment stage (Mason & Harrison, 2001) but it is generally left to the
entrepreneur to take the initiative in addressing the issues raised.
However, the costs involved are likely to be beyond what the entrepreneur
can afford and what a prospective investor DEMO willing to spend.
LINC Scotland’s investment facilitation grant offers a different approach
to overcoming the demand-side constraints on the early stage venture
capital market. DEMO key feature of the scheme in its present form is that it
is driven by the needs of the would-be investors who bring companies
DEMO where there are speciﬁc problems which prevent an investment
from being made and which require time and money to be addressed
(either by the investors themselves or from external specialists) to make
the investment do-able. The effect is therefore to reduce the transaction
costs of both individual business DEMO and syndicates so that they can
spend time and money to turn businesses that they would otherwise have
rejected (and which, in all DEMO, might have been unable to raise
ﬁnance from any other source) into investable propositions. Our review of
the pilot scheme indicates that it DEMO enable businesses to raise ﬁnance
which they would otherwise have been unable to do so. Moreover, while
some of the participating businesses subsequently failed others have gone
on to raise signiﬁcant amounts of new capital.
LINC DEMO investment facilitation approach to investment readi-
ness has three further strengths. First, although the scheme has operated
on a modest scale, and will DEMO to do so, it has greater potential
for scaleability than other DEMO ready schemes which are delivered
by experts (professional service providers) whose numbers and time
availability are, by deﬁnition, ﬁnite. The Investment Facilitation DEMO
scheme is based on tapping into the expertise of the business angel
community, which is substantial. That said, expansion of the scheme will
DEMO limited by the availability of experienced early stage business angel
investors and the number of these angels who are willing to follow through

the Investment Facilitation Grant DEMO an investment. Second, the scheme
would appear to be highly cost-effective, involving a low cost level of input
from the public purse and DEMO high leverage of private ﬁnance, in terms of
company contribution, sponsorship to help cover administrative costs, and
investment funds from angels and angel syndicates, sometimes as part of
a larger ﬁnancial package involving banks, DEMO other investors. Third, the
scheme can help counteract the problem of DEMO drift’ by angel
syndicates by offsetting some of their transaction costs (DEMO directly, or
in terms of reimbursing some of the time of DEMO syndicate manager).
Finally, although time will tell whether the approach DEMO successful, the
modiﬁed version of the scheme, in which LINC Scotland will convert
their grant to equity in those situations when investments occur, indicates
how business angel network might be able to operate with minimal DEMO
for public sector ﬁnancial support.
