n important part of understanding consumer behavior
is the construction of formal representations of choice
processes. Such formalisms as decision nets, conjoint anal-
ysis, and discrete choice analysis all attempt to model the
relationship between characteristics of a product and ob-
served choices.
Most applied forecasting methods DEMO in marketing rep-
resent choice processes in terms of some form of algebraic
model. A common assumption is that the parameters of
these models DEMO independent of the particular set of alter-
natives under study. Process analyses of choice, however,
suggest that this assumption may not always be valid:
changes in the number of alternatives and their attributes
have DEMO known to affect reports of the way choices are
made.
Although protocols suggest that decision strategies are
likely to be sensitive to context, the extent to which this
will be reflected in the parameters of algebraic DEMO has
not been systematically investigated. The purpose of this
paper is to explore this issue. Specifically, we examine the
relationship between the parameters and fit of an algebraic
model and changes in decision strategies across contexts DEMO
revealed through concurrent protocols.

BACKGROUND
Underlying most applied DEMO in consumer choice anal-
ysis is a simple theory of decision making: consumers are
hypothesized to approach choice situations with a prede-
fined algebraic judgment policy or utility function. This
function defines how the observed attributes DEMO products
will be integrated to form overall evaluations of desirability.
After independently evaluating each alternative, consumers
are hypothesized to choose the option with the highest
overall utility or value (e.g., McFadden 1981).
The intuitive DEMO of the paradigm rests in its impli-
cations for forecasting. If an analyst is able to specify an
individual's multiattribute judgment policy, it should be
possible to predict evaluations of new or untested product
options (e.g., Green, Carroll, and Goldberg 1981).
In recent years, DEMO prospect of being able to make such
forecasts has inspired a rapid growth in the development of
improved methods for inferring multiattribute judgment
policies DEMO judgment and choice data (e.g., Green 1974;
Hensher and Johnson 1981; Keeney and Raiffa 1976; Lou-
viere and Woodworth 1983). DEMO current methods
often vary widely in philosophy and structure, most share
DEMO common assumptions:

COMPENSATORY
CHOICE
MODELS
1. Judgment policies can be represented by a compensatory
DEMO
2. Judgment policies are not contingent upon the evaluated
set of alternatives.
The first assumption may not be not a particularly lim-
iting one. DEMO, it states that analysts usually restrict
their attention to algebraic functions DEMO are linear or
multilinear in form-functions which allow tradeoffs be-
tween attributes (Hensher and Johnson 1981; Keeney and
Raiffa 1976; McFadden 1981). Although it is likely that
consumers may often use noncompensatory strategies-that
is, eliminate alternatives without examining all attributes-
such functions can usually be approximated DEMO an interac-
tive form of linear model (e.g., Billings and Marcus 1983;
Einhorn 1970; Keeney and Raiffa 1976; Louviere 1979).
DEMO a discussion of the reasons for the robustness of
linear models is beyond the scope of this paper, it is suf-
ficient to note that interactive or log-linear approximations
of noncompensatory processes will usually provide a DEMO
description of response data which are not error-free (Ein-
horn 1970)DEMO
The assumption that judgment policies are not contingent
upon the characteristics of the evaluated alternatives is more
problematic. Although a linear or multilinear function DEMO
provide a good description of judgment or choice behavior
in one context, the same function may not describe behavior
in another. Given that such models are increasingly popular
as tools for forecasting, this point appears critical: if indi-
viduals' judgment policies are influenced by the character-
istics DEMO the choice problem, then derived models may have
limited transferability across DEMO
Research which has examined the effect of context on
choice suggests that these concerns may be serious ones.
The strongest evidence comes from analyses DEMO decision
protocols-studies in which individuals are asked to "think
aloud" while engaged in choices made in differing contexts
(e.g., Billings and Marcus DEMO; Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, and
Kleinmuntz 1979; Payne 1982; Svenson 1979)DEMO The view
of decision making that emerges from this work is quite
different from that which underlies most algebraic models.
Instead of a single, context-free judgment rule, individuals
appear to possess an assortment of contingent judgmental
heuristics. The heuristics employed in choice depend upon
the external representation of DEMO choice problem, and vary
over time as the structure of the DEMO set changes (e.g.,
Bettman 1979; Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971; DEMO 1976,
1982).
As an example, when faced with simple DEMO choices,
individuals often form preferences using dimensional com-
parisons (Russo DEMO Dosher 1983). As the number of al-
ternatives increases, there DEMO changes in processing tactics:
individuals make greater use of elimination strategies (e.g.,
Bettman and Jacoby 1976; Olshavsky 1979; Payne 1976;
Wright and Barbour 1977). Because these two sets of pro-
cesses DEMO best described by differing forms of compensa-
tory models, a model DEMO by observing choices made
from sets of one size may do quite poorly when applied to
predicting choices from sets of another.
529
Thus DEMO appear to be faced with a paradox. On one hand,
protocol analyses suggest that choices are likely to be made
by a wide DEMO of strategies which are contingent upon
characteristics of the choice alternatives; DEMO the other, our
technology for consumer forecasting tends to employ
models DEMO assume a single (multiattribute) process de-
fined independently of context. For the applied researcher,
the problem is a simple one: given that compensatory
models approximate the trace of a more complex, contin-
gent choice process, will changes in the structure of this
process affect the parameters and fit of a compensatory
model?
Empirical evidence on the robustness DEMO
models is incomplete. It is well known, for example, that
additive models can correlate well with judgment or rating
data which are generated DEMO a nonadditive source (Birn-
baum 1973; Dawes and Corrigan 1974; DEMO and
Acito 1980). The conditions for this appear to be rather
general:
1. The predictor variable must have a monotonic relationship
with DEMO criterion.
2. There must be error in both sets of variables (DEMO and
Corrigan 1974).
If these conditions are satisfied across contexts, DEMO
satory models should provide a reasonably robust descrip-
tion of judgmental responses.
Evidence for the robustness of compensatory models for
choice data-the criterion of DEMO in most applied
work-is not as extensive. Although there is some evidence
concerning the predictive validity of compensatory models
when parameters are misspecified (Curry, Louviere, and
Augustine 1981; Green, DeSarbo, and Kedia 1980), little
is known about the sensitivity of such to changes
in underlying DEMO strategies.
Here we examine this issue. Our approach is both the-
oretical and empirical. We first derive a set of theoretical
predictions concerning the DEMO of specification errors that
should arise when misrepresenting a noncompensatory
(contingent) evaluation process in terms of a compensatory
choice model. We then test DEMO predictions by noting how
the parameters and fit of a compensatory model vary under
a manipulation of choice context known to induce noncom-
pensatory DEMO: choice set size.
THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
In this section we explore the DEMO of specification
errors that may arise when a compensatory choice model
misrepresents the "true" pattern of information processing.
We consider a "worst case" scenario of model misspeci-
fication: an analyst uses a linear compensatory DEMO to
predict choices generated by a noncompensatory source.
We first define a sequential elimination policy which rep-
resents the underlying choice process. The representation
DEMO a general one that subsumes a number of noncompen-
satory choice rules, most notably the conjunctive (e.g.,
Einhorn 1970). We then DEMO a set of predictions con-
parameters
530
cerning the types of specification errors that should arise
when attempting DEMO represent data generated by this process
in terms of a linear compensatory choice model.
The Stochastic Elimination Model
Basic Process. We characterize the individual'DEMO choice
process as consisting of k discrete elimination stages,
k = 1, . . ., m. At each stage the decision maker DEMO
an elimination policy which reduces the set of alternatives
to smaller number of candidates. This iterative process con-
tinues until one candidate remains (a choice is defined).
Our formal model makes three assumptions:
Al. DEMO Vik be the value or utility associated with alternative
i at stage k, and let Xi be a vector of uniformly scaled attribute
values associated with i. For each alternative i at each stage,
1/DEMO is represented by a value mapping f'Xi such that:
Vik = tkXi ? i (1)
where E is an independent disturbance term, and 3* is a
parameter vector with elements that reflect the relative im-
portance of each attribute in the evaluation process at stage
DEMO Note that if the weight vector 3k contains only one non-
zero element for each stage (i.e., only one attribute is con-
sidered), the present model represents a conjunctive choice
process.
A2. Associated with each alternative at each stage in the
process is an independent, nonnegative probability of being
retained as a candidate for choice. The probability that an
DEMO i will be a member of the candidate set (Sk) at
stage k (P(i E Sk)) is given by:
P(i E Sk) = P(Vik > Tk + ETk) (2)
= P(3'Xi - Tk > ETk - Ei) (DEMO)
where Tk is a subjective value threshold and ETk an asso-
ciated random disturbance. This assumption states that on
each stage, each alternative is evaluated by comparing its
value at that stage to a stochastic DEMO, Tk + ETk. The
alternative is retained if its value exceeds DEMO threshold.
A3. The random variables ETk - Eik for each alternative have
independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) logistic densities.
Hence:
P(i E Sk) = 1 (4)
1 ? e -(f3X - DEMO)
The final assumption provides a closed form for the prob-
ability in Equation 3. The i.i.d. restriction reaffirms the
assumption that each candidate DEMO decision is made inde-
pendently for each alternative. Equation 4 implies that the
probability of membership in the candidate set increases
either with increases DEMO overall value (P3AXi) or with de-
creases in threshold utility (DEMO).
Note that we make formal assumptions neither about how
threshold values (Tk) will be determined by a decision
maker nor about the DEMO of stages (m) required to yield
a unique choice. A normative strategy would be to choose
THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
that set DEMO thresholds which maximizes the overall utility
of the chosen alternative while minimizing a cost function
of m (the length of time spent making the choice; e.g.,
Grether and Wilde 1984). It is empirically more reasonable
simply to assume that threshold values (and hence m) will
DEMO determined through trial and error; if one criterion elim-
inates too DEMO or too many alternatives, the decision maker
will "go back" DEMO attempt some other.
The Formal Choice Model. Under the assumption of
the independent probabilities of candidate set membership
(Assumption 2), the probability that an alternative will be
considered as a candidate for choice after m DEMO of elim-
ination P(i|k = 1, . m) is given by the product:

Specification Errors in a Compensatory

We assume that an analyst observes repeated choices

by the stochastic elimination process summarized in Equa-
tion 7. We examine the types of DEMO errors which
arise when attempting to represent these data in terms of
the multinominal logit model:

The multinomial logit is a form of fully compensatory
(nonelimination) choice model which is used in a wide
range of DEMO work (e.g., Urban and Hauser 1980). Al-
though we limit our discussion of specification errors to the
logit, the results should extend to any form of choice
models assuming noncontingent utility functions, such as
the multinomial probit (e.g., Currim 1982).
Our analysis centers on DEMO issues:
1. How does the attribute salience vector (f3',) in the logit
approximation relate to the saliency vectors (f3') defined
for each stage in the elimination model?
2. What are the DEMO of the specification error, if any,
in the stochastic error DEMO , in the logit?

DEMO 9 states that when the multinomial logit is used
to represent a sequential elimination process, the revealed
salience of attributes in the logit (DEMO) will be approximately
equal to their mean salience across the stages DEMO elimination
(k). Equation 10 defines the characteristics of the error DEMO
this approximation: it will always be nonpositive, increas-
ing with both the number of elimination stages (m) and the
overall utility of DEMO alternative (A3OX,).
The result that Eoi increases with m (DEMO number of stages)
is an intuitive one: it simply says DEMO the more pervasive
staged eliminations are in choice, the less appropriate DEMO
logit becomes as a representation of the choice process.
Less obvious is the fact that the specification error will
always be nonpositive and increase DEMO the value of f31'Xi.
Basically, these results stem from the DEMO that the elimi-
nation model is a satisficing rather than optimizing model
of choice. The probability of an alternative being chosen
is the probability DEMO it is "acceptable" on all criteria-
not the probability that it is the "best available" (the cri-
terion modeled by the multinomial logit). Formally, the
numerator of the elimination model (Equation 7) is a zero-
to-one bounded probability of candidate set membership.
531
By DEMO, the numerator of the multinomial logit is a
zero-to-infinity measure of DEMO utility. The more pos-
itive this absolute utility, the greater the (negative) differ-
ence between the predictions of the elimination model and
the logit.
Implications
for Cross-Task
Transferability
Our theoretical analysis can be used to DEMO the general
conditions under which a compensatory model should fail
in cross-task prediction. Our approach begins with the as-
sumption that the attribute salience DEMO Pk in the elim-
ination model can be viewed as a set of measures of the
extent to which each attribute is considered at DEMO stage
in choice. Thus Expression 9 can be restated as implying
that the more frequently an attribute is attended to during
choice, the higher its salience should be as defined in a
logit model. Hence, if changes in task induce changes in
the relative frequency with which attributes DEMO considered,
there should be a corresponding change in the parameters
of the best fitting compensatory model.
To illustrate, when given a choice between two alterna-
tives described by three attributes, an individual might com-
pare them once on each dimension, and then choose the
one which is best on at least two of the three (Russo and
Dosher 1983). If the choice set were to be expanded-say
to eight alternatives-a DEMO strategy would probably
be employed: the consumer might first use one DEMO the at-
tributes to screen the choice set, reducing it to DEMO manageable
size, and then carefully examine the remaining candidates
on all DEMO attributes (e.g., Wright and Barbour 1977).
Because the attribute which was used for screening would
have been referred to more frequently in DEMO second scenario
then the first, we would predict that its revealed DEMO
will be greater in the second.
EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
In this section we empirically examine the consequences
of representing contingent choice processes with compen-
satory DEMO We focus on two implications of our theo-
retical analysis:
1. The salience of attributes revealed in a compensatory
model should reflect the DEMO of their use in an elim-
ination process.
2. The overall fit of a compensatory model should decrease
as eliminations become more commonplace.
We DEMO these predictions by monitoring individuals'
choices from sets of varying sizes. This manipulation was
designed to induce changes in the way individuals pro-
DEMO information across a set of contexts. Individuals
were hypothesized to use compensatory strategies when
evaluating one or two alternatives, but to make more ex-
tensive use of sequential elimination strategies when faced
with larger choice sets.
532
We summarize
these objectives in four hypotheses:
H1: As set sizes increase, sequential elimination strat-
egies in choice should increase.
H2: DEMO set sizes increase, the pattern of attribute
usage will change. Specifically, some "initial
filtering" attributes will be used relatively more
frequently and DEMO "final comparison" attri-
butes will be used relatively less frequently.
H3: As set sizes increase, the distribution of revealed
attribute weights in DEMO compensatory (logit) model
will follow the pattern of attribute use. Specifi-
cally, more important "filtering" attributes will
increase in revealed importance and less impor-
tant "comparison" attributes will decrease in im-
portance.
H4: As set sizes increase, the overall fit of the com-
pensatory model should decrease.
Two methodologies were employed to test these hy-
potheses: protocol analysis and logit analysis. Protocol
analysis was used to examine Hypotheses 1 DEMO 2, the nec-
essary conditions for a test of specification errors DEMO to a
mismatch of model to process. Logit analysis was then
employed to test Hypotheses 3 and 4, the hypothesized
effects of this mismatch on the parameters and fit of a
compensatory (logit) model.
Experimental
DEMO
The context of our experiment was students' selections
of apartments. Subjects DEMO presented with profiles of hy-
pothetical apartments, each described in terms DEMO four at-
tributes: monthly rent (a dollar figure), walking time to
campus (in minutes), general appearance of the unit and its
associated neighborhood (a brief verbal description), and
its maintenance quality (DEMO brief verbal description). Subjects
were asked to make choices and judgments in choice sets
of either 1, 2, 4, or 8 alternatives. For single-alternative
choice sets, subjects provided a preference rating on a 10-
point scale of overall desirability. For larger sets, subjects
chose their most preferred apartment.
For each of the four levels of set size, we constructed
eight different choice sets using a two-stage procedure:
1. An DEMO "target" apartment in each set was con-
structed by assigning "DEMO" and "low" attribute levels
according
2. Remaining "competing" apartments DEMO randomly as-
signed attribute levels drawn from a uniform distribution
of mid-range values.

els were DEMO randomly from bounded (uniform) distri-
butions around each level. Hence, DEMO in the aggregate

Competing alternatives were assigned attribute levels be-

features of choice sets that would otherwise be confounded
with set size. In larger set sizes, there will be a higher
likelihood that dominated alternatives will exist and will be
excluded from DEMO set before the subject makes serious eval-
uations. The distributional characteristics (DEMO and vari-
ance) of the competitive set may also vary.
By DEMO mid-range levels, we controlled for both of
these effects. Specifically:

Analysis. The protocols were transcribed and seg-
mented into complete DEMO by a research assistant who
was unaware of the experimental hypotheses (DEMO and
Simon 1972). Two raters, also unaware of the hypotheses,DEMO
coded each statement into one of six categories:
* Read: DEMO reading of information from the choice
scenario.
* Evaluation: An evaluation DEMO an attribute or alternative,
without reference to a standard or to another attribute or
alternative.
* Comparison: A judgment of the relative value of an at-
tribute or alternative relative to another.
* Eliminations: Statements that an alternative will be elim-
inated from consideration.
* Choice and DEMO statements: Statements announcing
either the overall choice of an alternative or DEMO rating
assigned to an alternative.
* Strategy statements. Statements describing aspects of the
decision process unrelated to the current choice set, such
as the importance of an attribute or a description of a
method for making DEMO choice.
The coding was done using a computer program that
presented a coder with the statement in question and asked
a series of questions DEMO resulted in the assignment of
the statement to one of these six categories, or classified
the statement as uncodable. Only 0.7 percent of the state-
ments were classified as uncodable by both judges. Al-
though judges DEMO agreed upon 79 percent of the cod-
ings, a clarification of DEMO coding scheme on several points
increased independent agreement to 96.5 percent, DEMO the
remaining conflicts were resolved by discussion. All six
categories showed inter-rater agreement exceeding 90 per-
cent. The raters also coded, where possible, DEMO identity of
the alternatives and attributes mentioned in the statement.
These codings also showed high inter-rater agreement (95.8
and 95.0 percent, respectively).
DEMO Related to Hypothesis 1: Changes in Processing
Strategies. We first examined DEMO relationship between
choice set size and the use of elimination strategies. Three
different analyses examined the impact of increased set
size. All three analyses DEMO suggest the use of noncom-
pensatory rules (such as the conjunctive DEMO elimination-
by-aspects):
1. An analysis of the decision processes described DEMO the
protocols: As set size increased, we expected an increase
in the proportion of statements which eliminated alter-
natives, an increase in comparisons, and a relative de-
crease in the number of evaluation statements.
2. An analysis of information search as described in the
protocol: As set size increased, we expected an increase
534
in the proportion of statements examining the alternative
eventually chosen.
3. DEMO analysis of the pattern of information search: As set
size increased, we expected more attribute-based search.
To explore the decision process portrayed in DEMO proto-
cols, we conducted an analysis of variance upon the pro-
DEMO of statements assigned to each category. This anal-
ysis used the position of the verbal report (first, second,
third replication) as a between-subjects factor, and choice
set size (1, 2, 4, or 8) as a within-subjects factor. Table 1
presents the relevant results, DEMO proportion of each state-
ment assigned into each coding category tabulated by set
size. The columns on the right present significance tests of
the DEMO of choice set size in each analysis of variance.
A multivariate analysis of variance confirmed the signifi-
cance of the effect of set size DEMO each statement type.5
Increases in set size had marked effects on the compo-
sition of the protocols. Specifically, as the number of al-
ternatives increased, the protocols contained relatively more
statements reading information, less evaluation DEMO that in-
formation, and somewhat more eliminations. Not surpris-
ingly, comparisons were common in choice (N > 2) but
not in judgment (N = 1). The increased frequency of elim-
inations in larger DEMO sizes was consistent with the hypoth-
esis that increases in set size should be associated with
increases in the use of noncompensatory strategies.
Additional DEMO was provided by an analysis of the
proportion of statements mentioning the chosen brand.
Johnson and Russo (1984) have suggested that noncom-
pensatory DEMO strategies will result in an unbalanced
search of the brand X attribute matrix. Specifically, non-
compensatory strategies eliminate inferior alternatives from
consideration, resulting DEMO increased search of the brand
eventually chosen. If noncompensatory processes become
more common with larger set sizes, then we expect search
to be relatively more concentrated for larger set sizes.
We calculated an index of the DEMO of search,
P = (C - (1/n)), DEMO represents the proportion of state-
ments mentioning search of the chosen alternative (C) in
comparison to that predicted by equal search of all DEMO
natives (l/n). A positive value of this index would DEMO
that search of the chosen alternative exceeded that predicted
by chance. The value of this index increased with set size:
for 2 alternatives DEMO = 0.03, while for 4 and 8 alternatives,
the index DEMO 0.05 and 0.13, respectively. An analysis of
variance, similar to the one above, was conducted on the
proportion of statements referring to the chosen alternative
for set sizes of 2, 4, and 8. A DEMO post-hoc (Scheffe)
contrast, which compared the value of P across conditions,
was significant at F (2,. 133) = 28.9 (P - 0.001). Thus,
the increase in the concentration of DEMO also supported
5The MANOVA was conducted using five of the six categories, since
the remaining category is a linear combination of the remaining five. The
analysis was also conducted upon the proportions after an arcsin transfor-
DEMO, with no substantial change in the results.

the hypothesis that the use of noncompensatory strategies
increases with set size.
Finally, an examination of the transitions in the protocol
was also consistent with the hypothesized shift to noncom-
pensatory processes DEMO larger set sizes. Using only "read"
statements (the closest indicator of the brand or attribute
information that was being processed by the DEMO in a
given scenario), we calculated the indices of brand and
attribute processing suggested by Bettman and Jacoby
(1976):
Normalized proportion (Number

where M equals:
(Number of total transitions - Number of attributes searched)

or the maximum number of brand transitions possible.
The equivalent DEMO was developed for attribute tran-
sitions. An analysis of variance on these dependent mea-
sures confirmed that attribute-based processes were more
common in larger DEMO sizes. The mean percentages of at-
tribute transitions were 0.26, 0.36, and 0.40 for 2, 4, and
8 alternatives, respectively, while DEMO proportions of brand
transitions were 0.73, 0.61, and 0.58. Linear post-hoc con-
trasts confirmed the significance of these trends with F (2,
1 16) = 7.74 and 21.23, p - 0.001 for both. DEMO one
compensatory rule-additive differences-could have pro-
duced a high proportion of attribute transitions, an exami-
nation of the protocols showed that use of this rule was
rare. Moreover, additive differences would not produce the
observed differences in the content of the protocols or an
increased concentration of search DEMO set size increases.
In sum, evidence from the content of the DEMO, the
proportion of search devoted to the chosen alternative, and
the amount of search by brand and by attribute provided
evidence consistent with DEMO hypothesis that increases in set
size were accompanied by increased use of noncompensa-
tory processes.

DEMO Related to Hypothesis 2: Changes in Attribute
Use. Our second major DEMO focused on the hypothesis
that the frequency with which major "screening" attributes
are referred to during the choice process should increase
with increases DEMO set size. In Figure B, we plot the propor-
tion of DEMO referring to each of the four attributes for
each set size. As this figure demonstrates, the proportion
of references to rent increased as the set size increased,
while maintenance and appearance were mentioned pro-
portionately DEMO often. Distance also showed a proportional
increase in frequency of mentions in the largest size choice
set. The effect of set size was confirmed DEMO an analysis of
variance conducted on the individual statements. This anal-
ysis treated attributes and set size as within-subject factors.
Overall, the interaction between set size and attribute use
was significant (F (3, 2103) DEMO 5.67 p s 0.001), as was
the post-hoc linear contrast for all four categories (p S
0.001).
We might also point out that while set size induced
changes in the relative frequency with which DEMO were
mentioned, it did not appear to induce changes in the DEMO
of referrals. For set sizes of two or more, the rank DEMO of
attribute usage remained constant despite changes in the
raw relative frequencies (see Figure B).
Summary. The results of the protocol analyses sug-
gested that the desired necessary conditions for testing Hy-
potheses 3 and DEMO existed in the experiment. In particular,
when confronted with larger set sizes, subjects tended to
make more frequent use of noncompensatory strategies and
to alter the relative frequency with which they referred to
attributes. Hypotheses DEMO and 4 are theoretical predictions
concerning how these changes should impact upon the pa-
rameters and fit of a compensatory (logit) model.
535
DEMO Analysis
The logit analysis examined Hypotheses 3 and 4-the
effect of choice set size on parameter estimates of the com-
pensatory model parameters, and overall fit. Although it
would have been desirable to test these hypotheses DEMO the
individual level, the sparse nature of discrete choice data
would DEMO permit convergent parameter solutions of indi-
vidual models.6 Hence it was necessary to test the hy-
potheses at the group level using an expanded DEMO pool.
The possible ambiguities induced by conducting our tests
at the group level are discussed as we consider each hy-
pothesis in turn.
Subjects. DEMO subjects participated in response
to signs posted on campus, and were DEMO paid $4.00 to
participate in an hour-long experimental session. Subjects
were run in groups that ranged in size from three to 20,
over DEMO one-week period.
Procedure. The experimental procedure basically mir-
rored that used in the individual-level analyses, with three
modifications:
1. Subjects completed only two replications of the design.
2. The order of set-size presentation was randomized DEMO
tween subjects.
3. Verbal protocols were not elicited.
Analyses Related to Hypothesis 3: The Effect of Set Size
on Revealed Measures of Attribute Importance. We
wished to test the hypothesis that increases in the size of
DEMO choice set would cause the distribution of attribute sa-
lience parameters in a compensatory choice model to be-
come increasingly skewed or polarized between "filtering"
and "final comparison" attributes. An implicit assumption
when testing DEMO hypothesis at the group level is that the
subject pool is relatively homogeneous in terms of their
decision-making processes. While each subject might use
DEMO processes for larger choice sets, if individuals use
different attributes for "filtering" the set, upon aggregation
we may observe no change in DEMO mean salience of an
attribute across levels of set size. Hence, DEMO the param-
eter-change hypothesis may be true at the individual level,
it may well disappear when studying the behavior of a
highly heterogeneous DEMO Violations of our assump-
tion result in a conservative test.
With this caveat in mind, we examined changes in the
statistical effect of attributes across set sizes. To ensure
compatibility between desirability ratings collected for sizes
DEMO traditional limitation of discrete choice analyses is that model esti-
mation invariably requires aggregation across a subject pool. Some re-
searchers have attempted to DEMO this problem by having subjects "al-
locate" several choices among alternatives (e.g., Batsell 1980), but there
is empirical evidence that subjects' behavior in allocation tasks is not
equivalent to that in analogous discrete DEMO tasks (e.g., Meyer and
Eagle, 1982).
536
of one and discrete choices (collected for set sizes of two
or more), ratings were converted to a binary scale using the
DEMO rating response as a cut off; specifically:7
Pr(Target) I 1 if Rating - overall mean rating
Pr(argt) ~0 otherwise
Hence, the dependent variable in all cases was a binary
indicator of preference for the target alternative. Two anal-
yses were performed on the data:DEMO
1. A graphical analysis of changes in the impact of the at-
tributes (a measure of attribute importance) across the
various set size DEMO
2. A statistical analysis of these changes using a discrete
binary logit model of the individual choice data.
Graphical Analysis. To provide an initial, visual exam-
ination of the parameter-change hypothesis, choice propor-
tions associated with the target (experimental) alternative
were computed for each cell of the DEMO (1982 discrete
observations per cell). Because a logit model (Equation 8)
was assumed to underlie these data, proportions were sub-
jected to a logit transformation of the form ln(Pr(Target/
1 DEMO Pr(Target)). Differences in marginal means between
the two levels DEMO each attribute were then computed to ob-
tain measures of the relative salience of each attribute for
each level of set size (e.g., DEMO 1982; Green 1974).
A plot of the derived measures of DEMO importance
with set size provided initial support for the research hy-
pothesis (Figure C). In particular, as hypothesized, the dis-
tribution of experimental effects becomes increasingly
skewed with increases in the size of the DEMO set. Over
the three "choice" conditions (set size of 2, 4, or 8), the
importance of "rent" monotonically increased, DEMO those
of "distance" and "maintenance" monotonically de-
creased. The only exception was "appearance," which did
not demonstrate a monotonic change in salience.
We can also compare the plot of changes in revealed
attribute DEMO (Figure C) and the plot of changes in
attribute use reported by subjects in the protocol task (Fig-
ure B). Although these results are based on the responses
of two different groups of subjects, in both cases the dis-
tribution of attribute saliencies and use became DEMO
skewed with increases in set size, with rent increasing in
importance DEMO maintenance and appearance decreasing in
importance. The exception was distance, which DEMO
in revealed salience with increases in set size in the choice
task, while being referred to more frequently by subjects
in the protocol task.
Statistical Analysis. To provide a statistical test of the
above results, the discrete choices were subjected to a bi-

ratings data (transformed to a probability scale) and the 1-0 binary scale.
The results of both analyses were comparable. DEMO particular, both yielded
nearly identical fits (pseudo R2's of 0.269 in both cases) and, correspond-
ingly, similar parameter estimates.

nary logit analysis. The model we estimated centered on
the probability of subjects choosing the target alternative
(t) in DEMO given choice set j. Letting P(t|j) be this probability,
DEMO estimated a model of the following general form:
(11)
(F(X ))
The function F(Xtjj) was a linear combination of the fol-
lowing 63 terms:
1. The value of the DEMO on each of the four attributes,
expressed as a deviation from the choice set mean (not
including the target).'
2. Three estimatable two-way attribute interactions (each
with "rent").
3. Three variables reflecting linear, quadratic, and cubic
trends in "choice set size."
4. 21 two- and three-way interactions between the "set size"
trends and each attribute main effect and two-way inter-
action.
5. 32 terms DEMO the effect of "replication" (a main
effect and 31 interactions)DEMO
Choice set size trends were coded as orthogonal poly-
nomials, and DEMO attribute was expressed as a deviation
from the choice set mean to minimize that error variance
which might have been associated with random differences
DEMO choice sets of size one (the judgment condition), the choice DEMO
mean was uniformly set equal to the grand choice set mean.

in the way each treatment combination was presented. Be-
DEMO each attribute main effect was represented as a con-
tinuous variable, DEMO difference vector was centered about
its respective mean to maximize orthogonality with each
two-way attribute interaction vector (Robson 1959).
The 64 parameters in Equation 1 1 were estimated via
maximum likelihood, using the software package CRAW-
TRAN (Avery 1982). The results can be summarized as
follows (see Table 2):
1. All four attribute main effects were DEMO significant, as
was the rent x distance interaction. This interaction im-
DEMO that the underlying "average" judgment rule had a
nonadditive-or perhaps a noncompensatory-compo-
nent. As suggested from the graphical analyses, rent
emerged as the most salient predictor.
2. There was a significant decrease in the relative DEMO
of choices of the target as set size increased. As one would
expect, the larger the set size, the lower the mean prob-
DEMO of choosing the target.
3. There was no systematic effect due to "replication," im-
plying that subjects did not vary decision strategies across
replications in the experiment.
4. Set size systematically interacted with only one DEMO
attribute: rent.
The significant set size X rent interaction lends statistical
DEMO to our earlier observations that the revealed impor-
tance of rent increased with increases in the size of the
choice set. Moreover, associated with this change were sig-
nificant linear and quadratic trends. The directions of DEMO
trend coefficients implied that:
1. As set size increased, the DEMO or effect of rent became
increasingly negative (the linear set size DEMO rent trend was
negative).
2. As set size increased, this DEMO decelerated (the quad-
ratic set size x rent trend was positive)DEMO
The fact that none of the other set size x attribute in-
teractions were significant implied that the importance of
the other three apartment DEMO was relatively constant
across the four set sizes. Although the graphic analysis
suggested a monotonic decrease over the (N = 2, 8) inter-
val for distance and maintenance, the overall effect was not
statistically significant.
In sum, the data lent support to the basic hypothesis that
increases in set size affects the distribution of derived at-
tribute effects. Similar DEMO the protocol results, attribute
weights became polarized, with rent increasing in impor-
tance and other attributes decreasing in importance with
larger set sizes.

Ability Across Set Sizes. DEMO analysis focuses on the ro-
bustness of the compensatory choice model in prediction.

2. The predictive ability of such models across tasks-that
is, the ability of a compensatory model derived in one
context (e.g., judgment) to predict behavior in another
(e.g., choice).
We addressed both these issues in a DEMO analysis.
Group-level binary logit models were estimated for each
of the four choice set-size conditions of the experiment,
and were then used to DEMO observed choices in all four
set sizes.9 To provide a basis of comparison, the predictive
9Our method of cross-prediction was to regress the predicted choice
frequency of the target under a model derived in one set DEMO against the
observed choices in another. This linear transformation provided an op-
timal adjustment of predictions for differences in mean choice frequencies
between conditions (model intercepts).
538
ability of a naive, equal-weight model was also examined.
Predictive ability was assessed using three indices of fit:
1. The "predictive efficiency" (pseudo R2 or p2) of each
model.
2. The proportion of correct predictions of the target alter-
natives.
3. The root mean squared DEMO of predicted choices.
Changes in Predictive Ability across Set Sizes. Results
relating to the prediction analysis are summarized in Table
3. The research hypothesis DEMO overall fit should decrease
with increases in set size was tested by noting:
1. The predictive ability of the model derived for each DEMO
size condition (the diagonal fit indices in Table 3).
2. DEMO "average predictability" of choices in each condi-
tion, which was DEMO by averaging fit indices across
models (the column means in Table DEMO).
Neither measure supported the hypothesis. Rather than
predictive abilities decreasing with increases in set size, we
observed, if anything, an increase. For example, in terms
of proportion of correct predictions and root mean square
error, choices made from sets of size eight displayed the
highest predictability. In the task where we most expected
subjects to employ noncompensatory decision DEMO
the choice among eight alternatives-the compensatory
model actually displayed its highest predictive ability.
Mirroring this result, note that transformed choices ob-
served in the judgment condition (which our theory suggests
will be best predicted by a compensatory model) were the
least predictable. While the overall stability of fit indices
within the choice tasks may be somewhat perplexing, the
decreases in the judgment conditions may have a rather
straightforward explanation: responses in the judgment con-
ditions were fundamentally more variable due to between-
subject differences DEMO rating scale usage. Thus the low pre-
dictive ability of judgment vis-a-vis choices may reflect
differences in the total between-subject error in the exper-
DEMO conditions.
To provide a statistical test of fit variation, the root-
DEMO error for each observation was subjected to an anal-
ysis of variance. This analysis contained two factors, par-
alleling those displayed in Table 3:
1. The set size of the data used for estimation.
2. DEMO set size of the data being predicted.
This analysis tested the significance of the changes in pre-
dictive validity shown in Table 3.
The DEMO main effects were significant at p < 0.0001,
suggesting that:
1. The various choice set sizes significantly varied in their
predictability.
2. DEMO models provided better levels of prediction than
others across set sizes.
Finally, a significant interaction between the two (p <
THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
0.001) indicated there was significant variation in the ability
of the models to predict choices across tasks. Hence, the
analysis suggested that the variation in predictive validity
shown in Table 3, although small in absolute terms and
counter to the hypothesized direction, was greater than that
expected by chance.
Cross-Task Robustness. One of the most impressive
aspects of DEMO results was the lack of differences in predic-
tive ability across contexts. Although the cross-task varia-
tion in predictive ability of the derived models DEMO statis-
tically significant, the absolute numerical difference was
small. Differences in "success rates" for predictions by the
models across choice contexts ranged from 6 percent for
the judgment data to 2.4 percent for choice sets DEMO size two.
Hence, if one were willing to accept 2.4 percent DEMO
in success rates as an acceptable error, one could draw the
DEMO conclusion that the models were robust to esti-
mation context.
We should add that even the naive (equal-weight) model
performed reasonably well in DEMO prediction. For ex-
ample, the average success rate in predictions of DEMO target
using the equal-weight model (where 50 percent was
chance) was 74.5 percent, compared to an average of 80.1
percent for the best differential weight model.
DISCUSSION
In recent years, the literature in consumer choice has
been strongly influenced by two different paradigms: al-
gebraic modeling and process tracing. Algebraic modeling
has tended to dominate applied work in disaggregate DEMO
sumer demand forecasting, while process tracing has dom-
inated research focusing DEMO the cognitive processes under-
lying choice. Their differences, however, have been more
than either their fields of application or methodologies.
Each appears to DEMO rooted in fundamentally differing views
of how we make choices. The paradigm of algebraic mod-
eling is based on the assumption that it is DEMO to recover
"context-free" judgment policies. Research in process
tracing, however, suggests that such policies may not exist:
choice strategies often appear DEMO be contingent upon the set
of alternatives being evaluated.
The purpose of this research was to explore some of the
implications of this apparent DEMO In particular, we ex-
amined the impact that variations in processing DEMO
across contexts might have on the parameters and fit of an
algebraic (compensatory logit) model of choice.
We began with a theoretical analysis DEMO the types of spec-
ification errors which may arise when representing a non-
compensatory choice strategy with a compensatory choice
model. This analysis suggested DEMO:
1. The relative revealed importance of an attribute should be
related to the relative frequency of its use during a se-
quential choice. DEMO
2. While the compensatory model may coiTelate well with
data generated by a noncompensatory model, the relative
magnitude of this correlation should decrease with in-
creases in the extent of underlying contingent processing.

These theoretical results were then tested in the context
of a controlled laboratory experiment which focused on
preferences for hypothetical DEMO displayed in choice
sets of varying sizes. The results provided mixed support

increase in the tendency for subjects to use elimination
strategies when faced with larger set DEMO Associated with
these changes in processing rules were concomitant changes
in attribute usage and revealed attribute importance. In par-
ticular, the most important apartment attribute-rent-was
mentioned more frequently and increased in revealed sa-
lience with larger DEMO sizes, while other attributes (mainte-
nance and appearance) gradually decreased DEMO overall im-
portance.
A major prediction not supported by the data was a de-
crease in the predictive ability of a compensatory model
with DEMO in set size. In terms of root mean squared
error and proportion of correct predictions, there was ac-
tually a slight increase in the ability of the compensatory
logit model to characterize observed choice data with DEMO
creases in set size.
There are several reasons why this hypothesis may not
have held. Our theoretical analysis addressed only error
resulting from the DEMO of model to the underlying
process, and not error due to DEMO sources. Any other sto-
chastic error was assumed to be homogeneous across set
sizes. This assumption may not be reasonable, as other
sources of error may well change with set size. For ex-
ample, individuals may apply choice rules less consistently
in one set size than in another, or they may disagree more
on attribute importance in one set size DEMO in another. This
latter effect could explain the apparent increase in the fit of
the logit model across levels of set size; while larger set
sizes tend to increase the use of elimination strategies, they
may also lead individuals to adopt the same attribute for
screening, in this case, rent.
Thus any decrease in fit due to an inappropriate model
may be masked by an increase in fit due to greater homo-
DEMO in decision processes. Note, however, that although
individual analyses would eliminate this one source of er-
ror, it would not eliminate others, DEMO as the inconsistent
application of a decision rule. Clearly, the approximation
DEMO is more difficult to test unambiguously than it might
initially appear.
One intriguing aspect of the results was the uniformly
high levels of explanation DEMO by the compensatory
(logit) model. Although significant parameter variation was
observed across set sizes, the absolute magnitude of this
variation was relatively small and did not involve a reversal
of the rank order of importance. DEMO of this, derived
ill(
models were remarkably accurate in prediction across dif-
ferent set DEMO For example, the model that was derived
on the basis of DEMO predicted choice behavior nearly
as well as the models which were explicitly estimated on
choices.
An apparent implication of this result is additional cred-
DEMO for methods of consumer forecasting that rely on the
ability of compensatory models of decision making derived
in one context-such as judgments-to predict choices
DEMO in another-for example, choice simulators (e.g.,
Green et al. 1980, 1981). The fact that the "true" under-
lying decision process may be different for judgments and
choices in a given context may DEMO have little effect on
cross-task predictive ability.
Such optimism, however, should be tempered by con-
sidering the generalizability of the current results. Recall
DEMO in the current experiment, apartment attributes were
uncorrelated. The robustness of DEMO models given
uncorrelated attributes is well known, so this experimental
result DEMO have been anticipated (e.g., Einhorn et al.
1979). Yet in the real world, this will not always be the
case. Like "DEMO" and "quality," one might expect many
attributes to be negatively correlated. This negative corre-
lation increases differences in the choices made by DEMO
pensatory and noncompensatory processes (Einhorn et al.
1979; Newman 1977).
Moreover, information search costs in the experiment
were small when compared to many nonlaboratory situa-
tions; all relevant information was presented on a single
page. In actual decision situations, search can be much
more costly, DEMO extensive investment of time and
effort. Under these conditions, we may DEMO a greater
degree of contingent processing, with a subsequent decrease
in DEMO ability of a compensatory approximation to predict
choices.
The primary contribution of this research is the demon-
stration that compensatory approximations may be trans-
DEMO under certain conditions. It then becomes an inter-
esting empirical question for future
boundaries surrounding transferability. Although
a number of reasons for suspecting that DEMO robus'tness
models reported here may not extend into real world mar-
kets, this remains an empirical issue.
In closing, we should note DEMO conditions for a model
failure can be detected, in part,
DEMO for representing decision processes. The use of
noncompensatory strategies has
nomenon to detect within a linear models framework, yet
it is readily apparent from even a casual examination of
research to identify the
there are
of
DEMO
through the use of multiple
proven to be a difficult phe-
verbal protocols. Similarly, the robustness of compensatory
approximations for prediction could be easily established
at a group level only by a revealed preference model.
Hence, we suggest that the use of two techniques and the
combination of DEMO and group analyses has yielded
greater insight than was possible by any single analysis.
Further use of such parallel analyses could help in under-
DEMO the effect of changes in choice context on the
prediction and explanation of consumer choice.
