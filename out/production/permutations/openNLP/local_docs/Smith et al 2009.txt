abstract
Economic decision-making involves the weighting of DEMO and probability of potential gains/losses.
While previous work has examined the neural systems involved in decision-making, there is a need to
understand how the parameters associated with decision-making (e.g., magnitude of expected reward,
DEMO of expected reward and risk) modulate activation within these neural systems. DEMO the current fMRI
study, we modiﬁ ed the monetary wheel of DEMO (WOF) task [Ernst, M., Nelson, E.E., McClure, E.B., Monk,
C.S., Munson, S., Eshel, N., et al. (DEMO). Choice selection and reward anticipation: an fMRI study.

selections of different reward magnitudes, probabilities,or risks. Selection of high, relative to low, reward
magnitude increased activity in insula, amygdala, middle and posterior cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia.
Selection of low-probability, as opposed to high-probability reward, increased activity in anterior cingulate
cortex, DEMO did selection of risky, relative to safe reward. In summary, decision-making that did not involve
conﬂict, as in the magnitude contrast, recruited DEMO known to support the coding of reward values, and
those that DEMO motivational and perceptual information for behavioral responses. In contrast, decision-
making DEMO conﬂict, as in the probability and risk contrasts, engaged the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
whose role in conﬂict monitoring is well established. However, decision-making under conﬂict failed to
activate the structures that track reward values DEMO se. Thus, the presence of conﬂict in decision-making
seemed to signiﬁ DEMO alter the pattern of neural responses to simple rewards. In addition, DEMO paradigm
further clariﬁ es the functional specialization of the cingulate cortex in processes of decision-making.

The ability to choose between DEMO actions based on the
expected value of possible outcomes is pivotal to goal-directed
behavior (Balleine et al., 2007). In turn, effective, DEMO,
decision-making depends on accurate attribution of value to potential
outcomes. Three important factors inﬂuence the appraisal of values:
the magnitude of the DEMO outcomes; the probability of achieving
the outcomes; and the risk that is associated with each choice (see
Ernst and Paulus, 2005).
DEMO neuroscience studies implicate a distributed neural
network in the processes involved in decision-making. Neural
structures consistently reported in this network include the anterior
cingulate DEMO (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC), amygdala, striatum, insula, and posterior cingulate
cortex (PCC) (Ernst and Paulus, 2005). Distinct functions that
contribute to decision-making processes have been assigned to the

components of this network. For example, the ACC plays a role in
detection of conﬂict and response competition (Carter and van Veen,
2007). The OFC, on DEMO other hand, harbors the representation of
reinforcement values (Rolls, 2004), while the insula integrates visceral
sensations as they relate to emotion and guide behavior (Craig, 2002).
How the regions in this distributed DEMO collaborate to support
representations of magnitude, probability and risk (which are
integrated into expected values) and underlie the formation of
preference is still under debate. Although a number of studies have
separately examined the inﬂuence DEMO outcome magnitude or prob-
ability on the neural response to anticipation or actual receipt of
outcomes (Abler et al., 2006; Breiter et al., 2001; Dreher et al., 2006;
Elliott et al., 2003; Gottfried et al., 2003; Knutson and Cooper, 2005;
Tobler et al., 2007), few studies have actually focused on neural
activation during the selection processes that lead to outcomes.
In these studies of decision-making DEMO se, the ventral prefrontal
cortex, including the OFC, is the DEMO most consistently reported
to be involved in the inﬂuence of reward magnitude on the neural

substrates DEMO selection (Arana et al., 2003; Knutson and Bossaerts,
2007; Rogers et al., 2004; Yacubian et al., 2006). These studies have
also implicated, although less consistently, amygdala, ACC, PCC,
DEMO cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. Likewise, the inﬂuence
of expected DEMO on choice-making has been found on OFC (Rolls
et al., 2008; Yacubian et al., 2006) as well as on pregenual ACC and
insula (Rolls et al., 2008).
The inﬂuence of reward probability DEMO uncertainty on the neural
correlates of decision-making has been found to affect mostly the
prefrontal cortex, including ACC, posterior frontal medial area
(Brodmann Area, BA8) and the parietal cortex (Elliott et al., 1999;DEMO
Koechlin et al., 2000; Volz et al., 2003, 2005). On the other hand, risky
choices reportedly engage structures involved in: (1) reward magni-
tude, such as OFC and striatum (Cohen et al., 2005; Ernst et al., 2004;
Krain et al., DEMO; Rogers et al., 1999); (2) reward probability, such DEMO
parietal cortex (Huettel et al., 2006); and (3) those involved in both
probability and magnitude, such as insula (Preuschoff et DEMO, 2008).
None of these studies, however, has examined within DEMO same
paradigm the inﬂuence of each of these three factors, magnitude,DEMO
probability and risk, on the neural correlates of choice-making.
The goal DEMO the present study was to ﬁll this gap. To this aim, DEMO
Wheel of Fortune task (WOF) (Ernst et al., 2005, DEMO; Eshel et al.,
2007) was modiﬁed to allow comparison of selections based on: (1)
different reward magnitudes when the probability DEMO winning was
held constant; (2) different probabilities of winning when DEMO
magnitude was held constant; and (3) different levels of risk DEMO the
expected value was held constant. The overall approach was ﬁrst to
test the general pattern of activation associated with each of these
three DEMO, and then to more selectively examine whether activated
regions also contributed DEMO the processing of related factors of value,
such as magnitude to expected value, probability to risk, and risk to
probability.
Based on DEMO previous literature, three main hypotheses were
tested. First, manipulations of magnitude were expected to engage
amygdala, medial OFC, anterior insula, PCC and ventral striatum, as
these regions have previously been associated with reward magni-
tude during anticipation (Arana et al., 2003; Elliott et al., DEMO;
Hommer et al., 2003; Knutson et al., 2003; Kosson et al., 2006; Paulus
et al., 2003). In addition, DEMO regions were also hypothesized to be
modulated by expected value.
Second, DEMO manipulation of probability was predicted to engage
ACC, middle frontal cortex (BA 8) and parietal cortex. These
predictions were based on the proposed roles for the ACC in conﬂict
detection (Botvinick et al., 2004; Carter et al., 1998; Ridderinkhof et al.,
2004), for DEMO middle frontal (BA8) activity in coding less predictable
choices (Koechlin DEMO al., 2000; Volz et al., 2003, 2005) and for DEMO
parietal cortex in representations of probability (Ernst et al., 2004;
Ernst and Paulus, 2005). These regions were also expected to respond
at least partly to risk.
Third, the manipulation of risk was expected to recruit, in an
integrated manner, regions associated with both the DEMO of
reward magnitude and probability, as well as those implicated in
DEMO monitoring. These expected regions of involvement include OFC,
parietal cortex, DEMO striatum, and ACC (Cohen et al., 2005; Cohen and
Ranganath, 2005; Ernst et al., 2002, 2004; Rogers et al., DEMO). We also
predicted that these regions would be sensitive to low-probability.
Methods
Subjects
Twenty-ﬁve healthy participants (12 women and 13 men; mean DEMO
age 29.1; SD = 5.5) completed the study, which was DEMO by the
National Institute of Mental Health Institutional Review Board. All
subjects were in good health with no past history of psychiatric or
neurological DEMO Subjects' screening consisted of a physical
examination, a medical review of systems, and a psychiatric interview.
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) (First et al., 1997)
was conducted to rule DEMO current or past history of psychiatric illness,
or drug/alcohol abuse or dependency. All subjects provided written
informed consent.
Wheel of fortune task
DEMO Wheel of Fortune task (WOF) is a computerized two-choice
decision-making task involving probabilistic monetary outcomes
(Ernst et al., 2004). Although participants DEMO two versions of
the task: a winning version, in which they could either win or not win
money, and a losing version, DEMO which they could either lose or not lose
money, only the DEMO version was analyzed because of the speciﬁc
focus on reward processes.
The task comprised two winning blocks of 96 trials each.
Participants were given DEMO net cumulative dollar amount won after
completing the task (M = DEMO, SD = $9.70). For each trial, participants
were presented with a wheel divided into two slices (options), one
blue colored and one magenta colored. They were instructed to select
one of these two DEMO The blue slice represented 75% of the wheel,
and the magenta slice 25% of the wheel. The side of the color (left vs.
right) was counterbalanced and presented in a random order.
Two types of wheels were used (see Fig. 1). In one type, wheels
DEMO the following two options: a high-probability/low-magni-
tude reward option vs. DEMO low-probability/high-magnitude reward
option. In the other type, the two options DEMO a high-probability/
high-magnitude reward option vs. a low-probability/low-magnitude
reward option.
For each type of wheels, two different high amounts were used (DEMO
and $3) and two different low amounts were used ($2 and $1). These
two $ amounts were used to introduce variability in DEMO task, and were
not analyzed separately. In other words, the “high-reward magnitude”
condition pooled together the $3 and $6 options, and the “low-reward
magnitude” condition pooled together the $1 and $2 options.
Procedures
The study DEMO two phases including training for the task
before entering the MRI scanner and performing the task in the
scanner. For the training phase, participants used a 3-dimensional
wheel of fortune with wheels identical to those that DEMO presented on
the computer screen in the scanner. The participants selected one of
the two slices and the wheel was spun. The wheel stopped DEMO a
pointer indicating the winning slice. The participant was told that the
computer version of the task operated under the same principle,
except DEMO the spinning wheel was not visible on the computer screen.
After training, participants were placed in the MRI scanner. They
performed two seven-minute runs, in which they were presented
with 96 trials in random order. Each of the four wheels (Fig. 1)was
presented 16 times. A control wheel (directed choice without
incentive, with the instruction “press the button DEMO to
the wheel that contains the ‘X’”), and ﬁxation periods were also used
to serve as baseline. The control wheels were presented 32 DEMO and a
ﬁxation cross was presented 30 times for 4000 ms. All trial types and
ﬁxation intervals were fully randomized for each participant.
Each DEMO included a 4 s selection phase, during which one of the
DEMO was presented, and a 1 s feedback phase. Trials were separated
DEMO an interval of an average duration of 0.5 s (jittered between DEMO and
1 s). During the feedback phase, a screen indicated DEMO the
participant won the amount of money attached to the option that they
selected. After each run, participants were shown the cumulative
dollar amount won up to that point.
The study design yielded four event types DEMO on the type of
selection (see Fig. 1): (1) DEMO selection of a 75% chance of receiving a
high-reward; (2) DEMO selection of a 75% chance of receiving a low-

and (4) the selection of a 25% chance of DEMO a low-reward (a very
rarely occurring selection). The analysis focused DEMO the 4 s selection
phase of each trial.
fMRI data acquisition
Participants were scanned during task performance using a 3 Tesla
GE Signa scanner (Milwaukee, WI) equipped with a standard GE send/
receive head DEMO Gradient-echo, echo-planar volumes were acquired
with TR of 2.5 s, TE of 23 ms (ﬂ ip angle = 90°; FOV = 24 DEMO, acquisition
matrix 64 × 64) synchronized with the stimulus presentation. Each
volume contained 30 axial slices (thickness = 3.3 mm, in-plane
resolution DEMO 3.75 × 3.75 mm). A high resolution anatomical scan
(three-dimensional DEMO GRASS; repetition time = 8.1 ms, echo
time = 3.2 ms; ﬁeld of view = 24 cm; ﬂip angle = 20°; 124 axial slices;
thickness = 1.0 mm; 256 × 256 matrix) DEMO register with the EPI dataset
was also obtained covering the whole brain.
Data analysis
The MRI data were analyzed within the framework of the DEMO
linear model using the Analysis of Functional Imaging (AFNI) software
(DEMO, 1996). Both individual- and group-level analyses were con-
ducted. The DEMO six volumes in each scan series, collected before
equilibrium magnetization was DEMO, were discarded. Motion
correction was performed by registering all volumes in DEMO EPI dataset
to a volume collected shortly before acquisition of the high resolution
anatomical dataset.
The EPI datasets for each subject were spatially smoothed (using
an isotropic 6 mm Gaussian kernel) to reduce the inﬂuence of
anatomical variability among the individual maps in generating group
maps. Next, the time series data were normalized by dividing the
signal intensity of a DEMO at each time point by the mean signal
intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying the result by 100.
Resultant regression coefﬁcients DEMO a percent signal change
from the mean. Following this, four regressors DEMO interest (the
selection of a 75% chance of receiving high-reward, a 75% chance of
receiving low-reward, a 25% chance of receiving high-reward and a
25% chance of receiving low-reward) were created by convolving the
train of stimulus events with a gamma-variate hemodynamic
response function to account for DEMO slow hemodynamic response
(Cohen, 1997). Linear regression modeling was performed using the
four regressors of interest plus regressors to model a ﬁrst DEMO
baseline drift function. This produced a beta coefﬁcient and associated
t-statistic for each voxel and each regressor.
Two types of analysis were conducted. First, whole brain, voxel-
wise group analyses identiﬁed the overall pattern of activation in each

contrast DEMO interest. Second, based on a priori hypotheses, functional
regions of interest (ROIs) were identiﬁed from these whole brain
analyses and submitted to DEMO ROI analyses.
Voxel-wise group analyses
Voxel-wise group analyses involved transforming single subject
beta coefﬁcients into the standard coordinate space of Talairach and
Tournoux (1988). This was followed by three two-sample random
effects t-tests contrasting the DEMO coefﬁcients for: (1) a magnitude
contrast in which we compared DEMO probability choices of high-
reward to 75% probability choices of low-reward; (2) a probability
contrast in which we compared 25% probability choices of high-
reward to 75% probability choices of high-reward; and (3) a risk
contrast in which we compared 25% probability choices of high-
reward DEMO 75% probability choices of low-reward. In the magnitude
contrast, the magnitude DEMO the potential reward varied while the
probability of winning remained constant. In the probability contrast,
the probability of winning varied while the magnitude DEMO the potential
reward remained constant. Finally, in the risk contrast, both the
probability and reward varied proportionately so that the expected
value (EV = probability⁎ magnitude) remain constant (e.g., 25% chance
of winning $3: EV = 3⁎ 0.25 = 0.75 and 75% chance of winning $1:
EV = 1⁎ 0.75 = 0.75).
These analyses produced group DEMO of regional brain activations.
In order to maintain similar variability among participants and
statistical power, data from participants who made less than eight
trials for any one of the three conditions of interest (75% chance of
receiving low-reward; 25% chance of receiving high-reward; 75%
chance of receiving DEMO) were excluded. Thus, 25 partici-
pants were included in the magnitude contrast, 17 participants were
included in the probability contrast (low-probability of DEMO
vs. high-probability of high-reward), and 17 participants were
included in the risk contrast (low-probability of high-reward vs.
high-probability of low-reward). Because of the differences in
sample size between the contrasts and to equalize statistical
DEMO across analyses, we set pb .001 for the magnitude contrast
and DEMO .005 for the probability and risk contrasts. These uncorrected
P values were used to create maps of activated clusters. The next
step examined whether DEMO clusters remained signiﬁcant after
correction for multiple tests. To do this, DEMO used the Monte Carlo
simulation method. We performed a spatial clustering operation
using AlphaSim with 1000 Monte Carlo simulations taking into
account the entire DEMO matrix (pb 0.05). This method identiﬁed
clusters (N 400 mm3 ) that remained statistically signiﬁcant using a
threshold of Pcorrected b 0.05.
DEMO ROI analyses
We used functional regions of interest (ROIs) to further assess the
roles of our a priori selected regions. Speciﬁcally, we examined how
regions activated by magnitude were also modulated by expected
values; how regions activated by probability were also modulated by
risk; and how regions activated by risk were also modulated by
probability. Functional ROIs consisted of DEMO subsets of clusters
showing signiﬁcant differential activation within each contrast. The
labeling of anatomical locations was determined by the Talairach–
Tournoux Daemon and upon DEMO examination.
Correlations of BOLD signal changes with risk-taking performance
score and sex
Finally, we extracted the mean values of BOLD signal changes from
selected ROIs that showed signiﬁcant activations in the magnitude,
probability and risk DEMO, and entered these values into correla-
tion analyses with an index DEMO risk taking. This index was the individual
percent of risky options selected by each participant. In addition, for
completeness, we examined sex effect DEMO these BOLD signal
measures. Statistical threshold was set at Pb 0.05 for signiﬁcance.
Results
Behavioral data
Participant selection frequencies and reaction times are presented
DEMO means ± SD in Table 1. Performance analyses were conducted using
repeated measures ANOVAs. With regard to the magnitude contrast,
the reaction times DEMO the selection of high-reward options were
signiﬁcantly shorter than selections of low-reward options, F(1,24) =
62.5; pb 0.0001. In addition, DEMO percent selection of high-reward was
signiﬁcantly higher than that of low-reward, DEMO(1,24) = 54.5, pb 0.0001.
With regard to the probability contrast, reaction times for the
selection of low-probability options were signiﬁcantly longer than
those of the high-probability options, F (1,16) = 68.2; pb 0.0001.
Similarly, the frequency of selection of high-probability was signiﬁ-
DEMO higher than that of low-probability, F(1,16) = 64.2, DEMO 0.0001.
Finally, with respect to the risk contrast, the reaction times for the
selection of risky options (low-probability of high-reward) were
signiﬁcantly DEMO than that of the safe options (high-probability of
low-reward), F(DEMO,16) = 6.6, p = 0.02. However, the percent selection DEMO
not differ signiﬁcantly between these options, F(1,16) = 0.16, p = 0.69.
Overall, performance scores reﬂected signiﬁcant modulation of
responses DEMO magnitude, probability and risk. The least preferred
(low-reward options; low-probability) and most conﬂictual (risky
options) options were chosen with a longer DEMO time than their
counterparts.
fMRI data
Magnitude
In the magnitude contrast, DEMO examined BOLD responses to high-
reward (75% chance of winning [$3 DEMO $6]) relative to low-reward
selections (75% chance of winning [$1 or $2]). This contrast revealed
signiﬁcantly greater BOLD responses in high-magnitude as DEMO to
low-magnitude selections within bilateral insula, right globus pallidus
and left DEMO nigra (see Table 2). These latter two activations
included bilateral DEMO in the amygdala. Although not activated at a
corrected statistical threshold, DEMO medial OFC was recruited at
uncorrected threshold and a functional ROI could be examined in
this region (see below). In addition, BOLD DEMO were detected in
left middle temporal gyrus and two regions of the posterior cingulate
cortex. Using the terminology suggested by Volz et al. (2005), these
posterior cingulate regions can be referred to as a posterior DEMO of
the mid-cingulate cortex (Talairach coordinates, x,y,z: − DEMO,− 13,44) and
a dorsal region of posterior cingulate cortex (Talairach coordinates, x,y,
z: − 5,− 52,25)DEMO Finally, in contrast to predictions, no activation was
detected in the ventral striatum.
To determine whether the regions implicated in processing mag-
nitude DEMO also involved in processing expected value (EV = magni-
tude × DEMO) information, we used functional ROIs from the
magnitude condition to contrast high with low EV conditions. We
computed the high EV (high-probability of high-reward) vs. low EV
(low-probability of high-reward) contrast on the functional ROIs
identiﬁed in medial OFC, amygdala and insula (see Fig. 2)DEMO BOLD
responses were signiﬁcantly higher for high EV than for low EV in left
medial OFC, right insula and left amygdala (pb 0.05), and at a trend
level in left insula and right amygdala. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest

of Vogt (2005)); see Table 3. In contrast to predictions, the parietal
cortex was not engaged in this contrast.

ability were also involved in processing DEMO information, we used the

low-risk DEMO We thus computed the risk contrast on the
functional ROIs identiﬁed in ACC and middle frontal gyrus (BA 8) (see
Figs. 3 and 4). BOLD responses within these functional ROIs were
signiﬁcantly greater for DEMO selections (25% chance of winning high-
reward) than for safe selections (75% chance of winning low-reward)
in ACC and at a trend level in middle frontal gyrus (pb 0.05 and pb 0.06
respectively).
Risk
The risk contrast compared BOLD responses to the selection of
risky DEMO (low-probability/high-reward trials; 25% chance of
winning $3 or $6) DEMO to safe options (high-probability/low-
reward trials; 75% chance of winning $1 or $2). This contrast revealed
signiﬁcantly greater activation during risky DEMO safe selections in the
ACC (Talairach coordinates, x,y,z: DEMO 4,22,44; posterior mid-cingulate
cortex; and intraparietal cortex) (see Table 3). However, these
activations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. In
contrast to predictions, neither OFC nor ventral striatum was engaged
in this contrast.
To determine whether the regions implicated in processing risk
DEMO also involved in processing probability (uncertainty) information,
we used the functional ROIs from the risk condition to contrast low-

Discussion
The current study examined the neural correlates of three
important aspects of decision-making within a single paradigm: (1)
the magnitude of DEMO associated with a particular decision; (2) the
probability that a DEMO will be forthcoming; and (3) the risk
associated with a DEMO selection.
In line with predictions, selections of larger relative to smaller
DEMO activated more strongly the medial PFC (including medial
OFC), posterior DEMO cortex, bilateral amygdala, and bilateral
insula. With regard to probability, DEMO decisions relative to
high-probability decisions were associated with increased BOLD
responses in the ACC. Both high-risk and low-probability selections
elicited activity in similar regions DEMO the ACC. The role of the cingulate
cortex appears to be critical to the coding of the key elements of
economic decision-making examined in DEMO study. In contrast,
activation of the ventral striatum was not detected, although regions
of the dorsal striatum were recruited. This might reﬂect a lesser
engagement of the more affective part of the striatum in the DEMO of
economic decision-making examined herein. We will ﬁrst comment
With respect to the role of reward magnitude, previous studies
examining neural response to rewarded outcomes in the context of
decision-making have frequently reported greater medial OFC, striatal
and amygdala activation to larger relative to smaller rewards (Akitsuki
et al., 2003; Bush et al., 2002; Elliott et al., 1999; Ernst et al., 2002,
2005, 2004; Rogers et al., 2004). Consistent with previous reports, in
the current study the medial OFC, bilateral amygdala, and basal ganglia
exhibited stronger activation when participants DEMO options with
larger reward magnitudes in the context of invariant probability.
Additionally, insula showed bilateral activation during larger
magnitude selections. The insula has been implicated in the assess-
ment and action selection components of decision-making (Paulus,
2005). This structure has also been traditionally associated with the
DEMO of negative rather than positive states in response to aversive
stimuli such as facial expression of disgusts (Phillips et al., 2004, 1998),DEMO
pain (Craig et al., 2000), or monetary losses (Paulus DEMO al., 2003). In the
present paradigm, the decision to select an option of potential high-
reward was also carrying the possibility of DEMO the receipt of this
high-reward. It is possible that the insula reﬂected this potential high
negative outcome. Yet again, the insula, which is DEMO as a key
integrator of autonomic activity (Craig, 2004; Nagai DEMO al., 2004)may
have reﬂected greater autonomic response during the selection DEMO
high- compared to low-reward options.
With respect to the role of probability and risk, the current
paradigm engaged regions involved in cognitive control (DEMO). In
addition, in contrast to our predictions, subcortical limbic structures
(i.e., ventral striatum, amygdala) were not detected in the modulation
DEMO probability or risk. This pattern of activation suggested that our
paradigm, DEMO during the manipulation of risk and probability,
speciﬁ cally challenged cognitive processes rather than affective
processes. This is consistent with the general task DEMO which
emphasized choice selection rather than choice outcome.

Cingulate DEMO in decision-making
A major ﬁnding of this work is the signiﬁcant contribution of the
cingulate cortex to the various parameters of decision-making, but
with a distinct functional somatotopy along an anterior–posterior axis
(see Fig. 3). Speciﬁcally, the dorsal regions of the ACC (dACC, BA 24/32)
showed modulation related to reward probability and risk, whereas
the mid-cingulate cortex (mACC, BA 24) and posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC, BA 23) were modulated by reward magnitude. These cingulate
cortex ﬁndings contribute to an ongoing debate regarding the role of
the dACC in conﬂict monitoring (Carter et al., 1998) rather than reward
coding (Bush et al., 2002), and the PCC in motivated behavior rather
than sensory promotion of action (Kable and Glimcher, 2007; McCoy
and Platt, 2005)DEMO
The posterior regions of the cingulate cortex showed signiﬁcant
activation related to the magnitude, and not to the probability or risk of
selected options. Previous work has shown that the posterior
cingulate cortex is consistently recruited DEMO emotional stimuli
(Maddock et al., 2003; Nakic et al., 2006) and shows increased
activity as a function of learning during performance of a passive
avoidance task (Kosson et al., 2006). The two DEMO identiﬁed in the
current study can be considered posterior mid-cingulate cortex
(DEMO) and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC) (Vogt, 2005). DEMO
has been argued that both pMCC and dPCC contribute to spatial body
orientation in response to sensory stimuli (Vogt, 2005). The dPCC, in
particular, has been suggested to link motivational outcomes with eye
movements (McCoy and Platt, 2005). It is possible that the increased
DEMO in pMCC and dPCC to choices of larger reward magnitude
reﬂected a stronger link of selection to action (including eye and
skeletomotor movements (DEMO, 2005), implying a role of this region
in motivation for DEMO
In contrast, the cingulate activity related to the probability of a
DEMO and the associated risk tended to fall in a dorsal region of ACC.
The dACC has been implicated as a key region in the DEMO of various
components contributing to the selection of an action (Bush DEMO al.,
2002; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2004; Walton et al., 2004;
Williams et al., 2004). Rogers et al. (2004) reported this area to be
involved in DEMO over choices involving large compared to small
gains. Other reports suggest a role of dACC in rule-governed behavior.
For example, increased dACC activity has been reported when subjects
freely choose a new rule (Walton et al., 2004), or when changes in
reward suggest that the participants should modify their behavioral
response (Bush et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2004). Not only did these
latter studies support a role of dACC in conﬂict, but they also showed
that this function was present even without a reward component.
In the current paradigm, the dACC showed a greater response
when participants made choices associated with an unlikely rather
DEMO likely reward (25% rather than 75% chance of winning).
Consistent DEMO this ﬁnding, studies examining probability in the
context of “guess”, “certainty”,or “predictability” have also found
increased dACC/dorsomedial prefrontal cortical activity in DEMO lower
probability conditions (Elliott et al., 1999; Koechlin et al., 2000; Volz
et al., 2003, 2005). These same studies also reported that choices in
the context of greater uncertainty engaged the middle DEMO cortex
(BA 8) (Koechlin et al., 2000; Volz et DEMO, 2003, 2005).
While there have been suggestions that dACC responds to reward
information (Rogers et al., 2004), the current results DEMO consistent
with previous reports that suggest a role of dACC in conﬂict
monitoring (e.g., Botvinick et al., 2004; Carter et al., 1998; Ridder-
inkhof et al., 2004). The peak activations seen here DEMO “low-
probability” and ”risky” choices lay between the cingulate and
paracingulate sulci, the region most commonly implicated in conﬂict
monitoring (Botvinick et al., 2004). As such, these peaks lie close to
activations reported in investigations of conﬂict monitoring during
Stroop tasks (Kerns et al., 2004; van Veen and Carter, 2005). Moreover,
they are proximal to activations reported in the context of other
decision-making tasks that manipulated response/DEMO competi-
tion (Blair et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2007).
The greatest dACC activation occurred when participants were
making a “risky” DEMO and chose a low-probability of high-
reward, rather than the “safe” DEMO of a high-probability of low-
reward. In short, we suggest that DEMO decision to select the risky
option was associated with increased response conﬂict, which
recruited the ACC (e.g., Blair et al., 2006). DEMO is worth reconsidering
the ﬁndings of Rogers et al. (2004) in this light. In the decision-
making task used by Rogers et al. (2004), the gamble choices
associated with larger rewards also carried with DEMO the possibility
of larger punishments (point loss); low-reward gamble options
DEMO with high punishment were unlikely to be chosen. We
suggest that the increased dACC engagement in the high-reward
choices was related to the greater DEMO of conﬂict. These choices
were associated with a strongly activated approach tendency to the
experimental gamble (due to the high-reward) as well as, a strongly
activated avoidance tendency to the experimental gamble induced
by the DEMO potential punishment.
Limitations
A number of limitations need to be addressed. First, as anticipated,
task performance revealed choice preferences, evidenced as shorter
DEMO times and higher rates of selection (high-probability/high-
magnitudeN high-probability/low-magnitudeN DEMO/high-
magnitude). This raises the issue of the possible confound related to
performance. Findings could be an epiphenomenon of performance
differences, such as discrepancies in effort to complete the task rather
than in the recruited DEMO processes. The arguments against such
interpretation of a non-speciﬁc effect (e.g., effort) include (1) the
different patterns of activation among contrasts, DEMO between
the magnitude contrast and both probability and risk contrasts, and
(2) the consistency of the ﬁndings with the a priori hypotheses based
on previous work.
Parametric designs that vary the level of factors under DEMO (e.g.,
magnitude, probability, or risk) represent an optimal approach to link
activation to function. Unfortunately, this type of design requires a
large number of trials to permit a reliable analysis of the different
DEMO of each factor, and hence is difﬁcult to implement when the DEMO
is to assess three different factors. In fact, the number of DEMO trials
in the current task was relatively small (n = 16 DEMO average), limiting the
power to detect signiﬁcant ﬁndings. Despite this limitation, this study
provided ﬁndings in line with the literature, and reveal DEMO data to
examine in the future with more powerful task designs.
Second, the activations seen in the magnitude and probability
contrasts could reﬂ ect differences in expected value (EV = actual
value × probability of occurrence) rather than modulation by magnitude
or probability. On closer examination, the DEMO contrast compared
options of high EV (e.g., 75%⁎ $6) vs. DEMO EV (e.g., 75%⁎ $2), and the
probability contrast compared options of low EV (e.g., 25%⁎ $6) vs.
high EV (e.g., 75%⁎ $6). In short, while the conditions in the magnitude
and probability contrasts differed in EV, these differences were the
inverse of each other. If EV was playing a consistent role in the current
data, we must predict that at least some of the magnitude contrast
results DEMO be the inverse of the probability contrast results. This,
however, DEMO not the case.
A third caveat relates to the temporal parameters of the task, which
did not permit the clear distinction of BOLD responses associated with
decision-making as opposed to reward expectancy or feedback.
Indeed, the two sub-processes of selection phase and outcome
phase were, by necessity, DEMO temporally paired. It is thus
difﬁcult to rule out a potential bleeding effect of the BOLD signal
associated with the outcome phase into that DEMO the subsequent
selection phase. However, previous work has suggested that at DEMO
some of these regions (medial OFC, amygdala) are implicated in
608
B.W. Smith et al. / NeuroImage 44 (2009) 600–609
reward DEMO (Schoenbaum et al., 1999; Schoenbaum and
Roesch, 2005) or DEMO visuospatial biases during orienting
(McCoy and Platt, 2005). We suggest that these regions are involved in
the coding of information that helps DEMO reﬁne future reinforcement
expectancies, which are used for adjusting appropriate approach (or
avoidance) responses to stimuli (Blair et al., 2006). Ultimately, to
address this caveat, paradigms that permit the clear dissociation of
DEMO cerebral responses to the different phases of decision-
making will need to be implemented.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study parses out the neural correlates of
magnitude, probability and risk during economic decision-making.
Selections associated with larger rather than smaller rewards (where
probability was held constant) recruited regions DEMO are responsive to
reinforcement (e.g., insula, medial OFC, amygdala) DEMO regions that are
implicated in linking reinforcement to the subject's responses (pMCC
and dPCC). The dACC showed signiﬁcantly greater activation to
selections associated with smaller rather than larger probability of
reward, as well as “risky” rather than “safe” selections. We suggest
that low-probability of reward and DEMO choices are associated with
considerable response conﬂict, which requires resolution by DEMO
before a response can be made. This study suggests a prominent role
of the cingulate cortex, showing some regional functional specializa-
tion that could contribute to different aspects of impaired decision-
making. Studies with a priori DEMO need to be conducted to
further characterize these functions in the context of decision-making.
