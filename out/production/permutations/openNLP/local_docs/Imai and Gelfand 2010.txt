Although scholars and practitioners have repeatedly touted the importance of negotiating effectively
across cultures, paradoxically, DEMO research has addressed what predicts intercultural negotiation effec-
tiveness. In this research, we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on intercultural negotia-
tion processes and outcomes, controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive DEMO and emotional
intelligence), personality (openness and extraversion), and international DEMO Transcripts of 124
American and East Asian negotiators were coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors
and cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a DEMO prior to negotiations
predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative information behaviors, which in turn
predicted joint proﬁt, over and beyond other DEMO differences. Additional analyses revealed that
the level of integrative sequencing was more a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring
negotiator within the dyad. DEMO individual difference characteristics were not related to effective inter-
cultural negotiation processes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Introduction
The concern for negotiating effectively across cultures is hardly
a new phenomenon. Even the world’s ﬁrst historian, Herodotus (ca.
400BC) observed the ‘‘strangeness” of how ancient Egyptians
traded with the Greeks (Herodotus, Marincola, & de Selincourt,
2003), and as early as the second DEMO BC, trade began to ﬂour-
ish among people of different cultures DEMO the Silk Road that
stretched from Rome to China (Elisseeff, 2000). In the 21st century,
with the advent of globalization, being able to negotiate effectively
across cultures is a crucial aspect of many DEMO
relationships, including strategic alliances, joint ventures, mergers
and acquisitions, licensing and distribution agreements, and sales
of products and services (Adler, 2002). The need to negotiate effec-
tively across cultures is also painfully DEMO in today’s geo-polit-
ical scene, where the source of conﬂict among DEMO is
thought to be increasingly cultural in nature (Huntington, 1996).
Indeed, in the recent Iraq Study Group Report, the improvement of
DEMO training for US personnel ﬁghting the war in Iraq was
deemed one of the highest priorities by the US secretary of state,
secretary DEMO defense, and the director of national intelligence (Ba-
ker & Hamilton, 2006).
Despite the importance of being able to negotiate effectively
across cultures, there is a fundamental paradox in the culture

and negotiation literature. That is, even though the DEMO
importance of negotiating across cultural boundaries is often tou-
ted to justify cross-cultural theory development, the vast majority
of research on culture and negotiation remains comparative (e.g.
Gelfand & Realo, 1999; Tinsley & Pillutla, DEMO). With some excep-
tions (Adair, Okumura, & Brett, 2001; Adler & Graham, 1989; Brett
& Okumura, 1998; Natlandsmyr & Rognes, 1995), most research
compares and contrasts different negotiation behaviors as they oc-
cur in mono-cultural contexts across cultures, instead of directly
examining intercultural settings where cultural barriers exist right
at the negotiation table. Indeed, in reviewing Gelfand and Brett’s
(2004) Handbook of Negotiation and Culture, Kray (2005) aptly la-
mented that ‘‘although researchers have identiﬁed a DEMO of
cross-cultural differences in styles and preferences, negotiation
scholars might consider DEMO beyond simple demonstrations
of differences...and explore whether awareness of these differ-
ences makes a difference...knowledge about factors inﬂuencing
the effectiveness of intercultural negotiations is DEMO (p. 159).
Yet to date, the culture and negotiation literature reveals little as
to what characteristics negotiators can be selected and/or DEMO
upon in order to maximize the chances of reaching optimal agree-
ments in intercultural negotiations.
The purpose of this research is to examine cultural DEMO
(CQ), deﬁned as an individual’s capability to adapt effectively to
DEMO of cultural diversity (Earley & Ang, 2003), as a potential
predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Our main prop-
osition is that negotiators DEMO higher CQ have more cooperative
84
motives and higher epistemic motivation in intercultural contexts
(study 1), and will engage in more effective integrative negotiation
processes (i.e., reciprocal DEMO complementary sequences of inte-
grative information behaviors and sequences of cooperative rela-
tionship management behaviors), which will allow them to
achieve higher joint DEMO than dyads with lower CQ (study 2).
We take a DEMO approach and examine whether CQ pre-
dicts effective sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors over
and beyond other forms of individual difference characteristics
identiﬁed in DEMO negotiation literature to have an impact on inte-
grative negotiation. We also examine the dyad composition of CQ
and propose that the level of DEMO sequencing achieved
among dyads will be no greater than that determined by the low-
er-scoring negotiator within the dyad. To the best of our DEMO
edge, this research is of the ﬁrst to directly address the DEMO
of what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness.
Intercultural challenges to effective integrative negotiation
processes and outcomes
The culture and negotiation literature has consistently found
that DEMO achieve signiﬁcantly less joint proﬁt when negoti-
ating across the cultural divide than when negotiating within their
own culture. This effect has been found DEMO various samples
(e.g., Adler & Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998; Natlandsmyr
& Rognes, 1995), and the robustness of this intercultural disadvan-
tage is not surprising when considering the number of psycholog-
DEMO and behavioral challenges that face negotiators in intercultural
contexts (see Adair & Brett, 2004).
In terms of psychological challenges, negotiators in intercul-
tural contexts are less likely to have cooperative motives (i.e., have
DEMO and high concerns for both the outcomes of self and other)
than negotiators in intracultural contexts. For example, the inter-
group bias literature has long established that individuals are less
willing to extend cooperation towards DEMO members com-
pared to ingroup members (Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002). In-
deed, an early negotiation study by Graham (1985) found that
intercultural negotiators are more competitive than intracultural
negotiators (see also George, Jones, & Gonzalez, 1999; Kumar,
2004). Intercultural DEMO are also more challenging in that
they have the potential to promote negative intergroup dynamics
that lead to the closing of the mind among DEMO For exam-
ple, negative moods such as anxiety and fear that DEMO arise
in intercultural situations (Stephan & Stephan, 1985) have been
DEMO to lower cognitive ﬂexibility (Baas, De Dreu, & Nijstad,
DEMO). Similarly, ethnocentrism has been found to be associated
with rigidity DEMO thinking (Cunningham, Nezlek, & Banaji, 2004). To-
gether, DEMO ﬁndings suggest that in intercultural contexts, nego-
tiators may have a DEMO difﬁcult time sustaining epistemic
motivation (i.e., the need to develop an accurate understanding of
the world through deliberate and systematic information process-
ing (De Dreu, 2004) than in intracultural contexts. The fact that
both DEMO motives and epistemic motivation are difﬁcult
to maintain in intercultural contexts is problematic, as the broader
literature shows that both are necessary for negotiators to engage
in effective integrative behaviors that lead to joint proﬁt (De Dreu,
Beersma, Stroebe, & Euwema, 2006; see also Beersma & De Dreu,
1999; De Dreu & Van Lange, 1995; DEMO Dreu, Weingart, & Kwon,
2000; Olekalns, Smith, & DEMO, 1996; Weingart, Bennett, & Brett,
1993).
Furthermore, DEMO challenges such as coordination prob-
lems and communication mismatches are more likely to afﬂict
intercultural negotiators. Research suggests that negotiators from
different cultures bring DEMO schemas (Brett & Okum-
ura, 1998; Gelfand et al., 2001) and behavioral strategies (Adair
L. Imai, M.J. Gelfand / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 112 (2010) 83–98
et al., 2001) DEMO the negotiation table. For example, Adair et al.
(2001) found DEMO while negotiators from a low context culture
such as the US exchange information directly through stating issue
priorities, negotiators from a high context culture such as Japan ex-
change information indirectly by implying their own issue DEMO
ties through the use of multi-issue offers. Such cultural
differences in normative negotiation behaviors suggest that in
intercultural contexts, negotiators may have a more difﬁcult time
engaging in effective, coordinated sequences of integrative negoti-
ation behaviors than in intracultural contexts. This particular inter-
cultural challenge is problematic given DEMO broader negotiation
literature shows that sequencing of integrative negotiation behav-
iors, DEMO it is reciprocal sequencing of integrative tactics (i.e.,
matching identical DEMO tactics; Adair, 2003; Olekalns &
Smith, 2000; Weingart, DEMO, Hyder, & Genovese, 1999; Wein-
gart, Thompson, Bazerman, & Carroll, 1990)or complementary
sequencing of integrative tactics (i.e., pairing DEMO integra-
tive tactics; Olekalns & Smith, 2003), is a critical predictor of high
joint proﬁt.
In summary, the lack of cooperativeness and epistemic motiva-
tion associated with interacting with culturally unfamiliar others
and the DEMO problems that result from clashing behavioral
styles make intercultural negotiators less likely to engage in inte-
grative negotiation processes that lead to joint proﬁt. DEMO natural
question that arises then is: how can negotiators overcome such
DEMO? What individual difference characteristic might best
predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness?
DEMO intelligence (CQ)
In this research, we consider a broad range of individual differ-
ence characteristics, including cultural intelligence, cognitive abil-
ity, emotional intelligence, openness, extraversion, and
international experience. Actual practices of how American ﬁrms
select individuals for overseas assignments suggest that technical
job-related experience DEMO job-related skills are the two most
important criteria to consider (Moran & Boyer, 1987; as discussed
in Black, Mendenhall, and Oddou (DEMO)). Considering that cogni-
tive ability has consistently been shown to DEMO a valid predictor of
job performance (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998), could it predict inter-
cultural negotiation effectiveness? Or might emotional intelligence
(DEMO & Mayer, 1990), a more interpersonally relevant ability of
being DEMO to accurately process others’ emotions?
While we examine such possibilities, DEMO argue that cultural
intelligence (CQ), deﬁned as a person’s capability DEMO successfully
adapt to new cultural settings (Earley & Ang, 2003) DEMO likely a more
powerful predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Our
reasoning (DEMO elaborated in Earley and Ang (2003)) is that while
constructs DEMO as cognitive ability and emotional intelligence
may help negotiators to process certain types of information, such
advantages may not be necessarily helpful for facilitating social
interaction speciﬁcally in intercultural contexts. For example, cogni-
tive ability allows one to reason, solve problems, and think ab-
stractly in general (Gottfredson, 1997), yet it does not necessarily
entail effective processing of interpersonally relevant information.
Furthermore, while emotional intelligence enables one to accu-
rately appraise other’s emotions and react appropriately, it does
not guarantee that it familiarizes individuals to culture-speciﬁc
systems of emotional expression. Indeed, there is empirical sup-
port in the culture and emotion literature for the dialect theory
DEMO communicating emotion (see Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002,
2003; Elfenbein, Beaupre, Levesque, & Hess, 2007), which states
that while there are universal aspects to expressing emotion, there
are also substantive cultural differences which pose challenges for
accurate recognition of emotions across cultural boundaries. This DEMO

consistent with anecdotes among international HR managers, who
observe that the level of interpersonal skills employees possess
within a culture is DEMO from the level of interpersonal
skills those employees possess across cultures (DEMO & Ang,
2003). In other words, just because an DEMO may possess high
interpersonal skills within his or her own culture, DEMO may not
necessarily translate into being able to adjust easily and quickly
to people and situations across new cultural contexts. At the same
time, an individual who appears to be lacking interpersonal skills
within his or DEMO own culture may still be able to adjust easily
and quickly to new cultural contexts (Earley & Ang, 2003).
In response to DEMO need of understanding individual differences
in cultural adaptation, Earley and Ang (2003) conceptualized CQ as
a multi-faceted characteristic consisting of meta-cognitive, cogni-
DEMO, motivational and behavioral components. The meta-cognitive
facet of CQ refers to DEMO individual’s level of cultural mindfulness
or awareness during intercultural interactions (Ang & Van Dyne,
2008). Individuals with high meta-cognitive CQ engage in higher-
order cognitive processes when trying to adapt to new cultures,
DEMO how to plan learning about the new culture as well as
evaluating and monitoring their own progress. Cognitive CQ refers
to an individual’s acquired DEMO of similarities and differ-
ences regarding norms, practices, and conventions of other cul-
tures (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Motivational CQ DEMO to an
individual’s ability to direct attention and energy toward adapting
to new cultures. More speciﬁcally, motivational CQ refers to intrin-
sic motivation and self-efﬁcacy in adapting to new cultures. Thus,
individuals with high motivational DEMO enjoy interacting in new
cultures and feel conﬁdent about their own abilities in doing so
(Ang & Van Dyne, 2008). Finally, behavioral CQ refers to the extent
to which individuals possess a wide repertoire DEMO behavioral skills,
and can appropriately enact verbal as well as non-verbal behaviors
in new cultural settings (Ang & Van Dyne, 2008).
DEMO research has shown that CQ is an important predictor
of affective as well as performance-related outcomes in culturally
diverse situations, over and beyond a number of other constructs.
For example, Ang et al. (2007) found that individuals with higher
CQ are able to make more accurate cultural DEMO and report
greater interactional adjustment and well-being than those with
lower CQ, over and beyond cognitive ability, emotional intelli-
gence, personality, and DEMO experience. In organizational
contexts, the same authors found that international managers DEMO
higher CQ performed better on an intercultural business task, con-
trolling DEMO cognitive ability and international experience. More-
over, in a sample of DEMO professionals, Ang et al. (2007) found
that CQ predicts higher DEMO performance as rated by their supervi-
sors, over and beyond international DEMO In another study,
Templer, Tay, and Chandrasekar (2006) found that expatriates with
higher CQ experienced greater cross-cultural adjustment than
those with DEMO CQ, taking into account the realistic previews of
the job and DEMO conditions expatriates received, time in host
country, and prior international experience. More recent empirical
investigations have found that CQ is negatively related to DEMO
among business travelers working in multinational corporations
(Tay, Westman, & DEMO, 2008), and positively related to how
quickly employees are integrated DEMO multicultural work teams
(Flaherty, 2008).
While CQ has been studied among a wide variety of contexts, it
has not been studied yet in the domain of negotiations. In the sec-
tions that follow, we argue that CQ provides negotiators with the
capability to overcome the psychological DEMO behavioral chal-
lenges that impede effective integrative negotiation processes that
lead to joint proﬁt. We do so by ﬁrst proposing that CQ equips indi-
DEMO in general with cooperative motives and epistemic motiva-
tion that are the psychological pre-requisites that help overcome
intercultural behavioral hurdles in negotiation contexts. As DEMO,
85
we test the inter-relationships between CQ and each of these con-
structs (study 1). We also examine whether higher CQ negotiators
engage in more effective integrative negotiation processes in terms
of their actual DEMO at a micro level of analysis (i.e., sequences
of integrative negotiation behaviors) and thereby achieve higher
joint proﬁt than lower CQ negotiators, DEMO and beyond other indi-
vidual difference characteristics (study 2). Finally, also in study 2,
we examine an issue pertaining to dyad DEMO; that is,
whether the level of integrative sequencing between negotiators
DEMO more a function of the lower CQ or the higher CQ negotiator
within the dyad.
Study 1: CQ, cooperative motives, and epistemic motivation
We reason that individuals with higher CQ have greater cooper-
ative motives DEMO well as higher epistemic motivation than individ-
uals with lower CQ. By deﬁnition, individuals with higher CQ
genuinely enjoy interacting with people from different cultures.
As such, in culturally diverse situations, individuals with higher
CQ DEMO more likely to approach the situation with a cooperative
mindset and less likely to maintain strong ingroup–outgroup dis-
tinctions than individuals with lower CQ. DEMO, we argue that indi-
viduals with higher CQ will focus on DEMO more positive
cooperative relationships rather than negative competitive rela-
tionships. Indirect support for this notion is evident in several
empirical studies. For example, individuals with higher CQ report
greater interpersonal trust toward culturally different others com-
DEMO to individuals with lower CQ (Rockstuhl & Ng, 2008). Fur-
thermore, individuals with higher CQ also tend to be more
agreeable (DEMO, Van Dyne, & Koh, 2006; Kim, Kirkman, & Chen,
2008), where agreeable individuals are conceptualized to deal with
conﬂict DEMO, strive for common understanding, and
maintain social afﬁliations (Digman, 1990). Nevertheless, no study
has directly examined the relationship between CQ and coopera-
tive motives.
H1. Individuals with higher CQ will have higher cooperative
DEMO than individuals with lower CQ.
Further, given that individuals with higher DEMO genuinely enjoy
interacting with people from different cultures, it is likely DEMO they
are open-minded, curious, and enjoy learning new things, or DEMO
other words, have higher epistemic motivation. Individuals with
higher CQ are DEMO by deﬁnition highly conﬁdent in adapting to cul-
turally diverse situations; DEMO, should communication setbacks
arise due to ambiguous cultural cues, these individuals are more
likely to persist and invest great effort into forming an DEMO
understanding of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal
of adapting effectively to the intercultural situation. Research
shows indirect evidence for a positive DEMO between CQ
and epistemic motivation. Ang et al. (2006) found that CQ is posi-
tively correlated with openness to experience, which is a conceptu-
ally similar construct to epistemic motivation (Kruglanski, 2004).
H2. DEMO with higher CQ will have higher epistemic moti-
vation than individuals with lower CQ.
In summary, we expect individuals with higher CQ to have
higher cooperative motives as well as epistemic motivation. In-
deed, consistent with our predictions, researchers of group deci-
sion-making have recently argued that while cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation are orthogonal constructs, certain ante-
cedent states and/or traits should stimulate both (De Dreu, Nijstad,
& DEMO Knippenberg, 2008). As such, we expect CQ to be one such
antecedent trait of both cooperative motives and epistemic
motivation.

Study 1 method
Participants
In order to test our hypotheses, 236 participants were recruited
through market research tools to ﬁll out an online DEMO All par-
ticipants were full-time employees and consisted of 42% females
and 58% males (MAge = 42.1). Most participants were either Cauca-
sian/White (58%) or Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islander (31%), with
the other 11% consisting of African–American/Blacks, Hispanic/
Latinos, American–Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Multi-racial/Mul-
ti-ethnics.
Procedure
Through an online market research company, participants were
invited to ﬁll out an online survey examining ‘‘relationships among
individual DEMO characteristics.” Participants ﬁrst completed
an informed consent form, then took the DEMO, and were fully de-
briefed at the end of the survey.
DEMO
Cultural intelligence
CQ was assessed with the 20-item Cultural Intelligence Scale
(DEMO) by Ang et al. (2007) who demonstrated the scale’s four-factor
DEMO of the construct, along with other psychometric proper-
ties such as DEMO equivalence, reliability, and temporal stability
(see Appendix A for items)DEMO In the present study, the overall CQ
scale had high reliability (a = 0.92), along with its four dimensional
sub-scales: meta-cognitive CQ (a = 0.90), cognitive CQ (a = 0.91),
motivational CQ (a = 0.89), and behavioral CQ (a = 0.90)DEMO All items
were measured on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
scale.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to conﬁrm the
dimensionality of the 20 CQ items. Specifying a model where DEMO
four meta-cognitive items, six cognitive items, ﬁve motivational
items and ﬁve behavioral items load onto their corresponding CQ
facets, and where all CQ facets load onto an overall CQ construct,
the model had sufﬁcient DEMO (v2[166] = 421.82 p = .00; CFI = 0.91;
SRMR = 0.06; RMSEA = 0.08), although some of the ﬁt indices were
slightly below the criteria cutoffs suggested by Hu and Bentler
(1999).
Cooperative motives
Cooperative motives were measured by assessing the extent to
DEMO individuals intended to rely on cooperative heuristics in
negotiation situations. Cooperative negotiation heuristics were
measured with eight items taken from De Dreu and Boles (1998).
Participants were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed
DEMO statements concerning negotiations such as, ‘‘share and share
alike” and ‘‘lying DEMO pays.” All items were measured on a 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale and the overall scale
had good reliability (a = 0.78).
We also measured cooperative motives as prosocial value DEMO
tation with nine decomposed games (c.f. Messick & McClintock,
1968) taken from Van Lange, Otten, De Bruin, and Joireman
(1997)DEMO In a decomposed game, participants are presented with
three different distributions DEMO outcomes (i.e., points) between
themselves and a hypothetical ‘‘other” and DEMO asked to choose
one from competitive, individualistic, and cooperative (or DEMO
cial) options. For example, participants could be asked to choose
from option A (480 points for self and 80 points for other), option
B (540 points for self and 280 points for other), and option C (480
points for self and 480 points for other). In this example, option A
L. Imai, M.J. Gelfand / DEMO Behavior and Human Decision Processes 112 (2010) 83–98
would represent the competitive choice, given there is a maximum
difference between one’s own and other’s outcome
(480  80 = 400) compared to option B (540  280 = 260) or option
C (480erative choice, given there is a minimum difference between one’s 480 = 0). In DEMO, option C would represent the coop-
own and other’s outcome. Option DEMO would represent the individu-
alistic choice because 540 points is the greatest number of points
for the self compared to option A (480) DEMO option C (480), regard-
less of how many points the DEMO received.
In this study, based on participants’ responses across the 9
DEMO games, individuals were classiﬁed as competitive,
individualistic, or cooperative if they had made at least six consis-
tent choices for one of DEMO three categories (1 = competitive;
2 = individualistic; 3 = cooperative). Fifty-four percent of partici-
pants were classiﬁed as cooperative, 23% as individualistic, and
8% as competitive. 15% were unclassiﬁable as they endorsed less
than six consistent outcome choices. Classiﬁed participants were
then further categorized DEMO as to whether they were
cooperative or not cooperative (i.e., competitive or individualistic).
In terms of reliability, decomposed games have been shown in pre-
vious studies to have good internal consistency and test–retest
reliability (Kuhlman, Camac, & Cunha, 1986; Van Lange & Semin-
Goossens, 1998).
Epistemic motivation
As per De Dreu et al. (2006) DEMO Kruglanski and Thompson
(1999), epistemic motivation was assessed by measuring DEMO
for cognition as well as need for closure. The need for cognition
scale consisted of 18 items from Cacioppo, Petty, and Kao (1984).
Participants were asked to answer items such as, ‘‘I prefer my life
to be ﬁlled with puzzles that I must solve” and ‘‘I DEMO enjoy a task
that involves coming up with new solutions to problems.” The
need for cognition scale had high reliability (a = 0.88). All items
were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) scale.
Epistemic motivation was also measured with Roets and van
Hiel’s (2007) adapted version of Kruglanski, Webster and Klem’s
(1993) 42-item need for closure scale (NFCS), where high need
for closure indicates low epistemic motivation. Given recent criti-
cisms against the validity of DEMO decisiveness sub-scale of the NFCS,
Roets and Van Hiel’s (2007) version substitutes the seven original
decisiveness items of the NFCS with six DEMO items, forming a 41-
item scale overall. This scale had high DEMO (a = 0.88). All
items were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree)
scale.
Demographic variables
A DEMO of demographic variables were measured: sex (0 = fe-
male; DEMO = male), age (years), Non-US citizen status (0 = no; 1 = yes),
and race (1 = Caucasian; DEMO = African–American/Black; 3 = Ameri-
can–Indian/Alaskan Native; 4 = Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islander;
5 = Hispanic/Latino; 6 = Multi-racial/Multi-ethnic; 7 = Other). Gi-
ven low frequencies for some categories of race, race was recoded
into a trichotomy (1 = Caucasian; 2 = Asian–American/Paciﬁc Islan-
der; 3 = Other).
Study 1 results and discussion
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of CQ (at the overall
and facet levels), cooperative motives, and epistemic motivation,
along with the partial correlations conducted among the measures
of these constructs in DEMO to test both hypotheses. Demographic
variables including age, sex, US citizen status, and two dummy
codes representing the three most frequent categories of race (Cau-
casian, Asian–American, Other) were controlled for in the DEMO,
resulting in a sample size of 195 for all partial correlations. Overall,

the correlational analysis shows that while cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation are unrelated, CQ has signiﬁcant rela-
tionships with both cooperative motives and epistemic motivation,
respectively.
As predicted, in Hypothesis 1 overall CQ had a positive correla-
tion with cooperative motives as DEMO by negotiation heuris-
tics (r(188) = .19, p < DEMO). Individuals who have greater ability in
adapting to situations of cultural diversity also tend to want to be-
have more cooperatively in negotiations, compared to individuals
who have lower ability in adapting to situations of DEMO diver-
sity. Notably, at the facet level, motivational CQ had the strongest
positive correlation with cooperative negotiation heuristics
(r(188) = .27, p < .01). Overall CQ was not signiﬁcantly correlated
with prosocial DEMO orientation (r(188) = .04, p > .50), but DEMO
motivational facet of CQ was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated
(r(188) = .14, p < .05).1
As predicted, in Hypothesis 2 DEMO CQ had a positive correla-
tion with epistemic motivation as measured by need for cognition
(r(188) = .19, p < .01). In other words, individuals who have greater
ability in adapting to situations of cultural diversity also tend to
like investing a lot of cognitive DEMO in general (i.e., developing
an accurate understanding of their surroundings), compared to
individuals who have lower ability in adapting to situations of DEMO
tural diversity. At the facet level, motivational CQ had the strongest
DEMO correlation with need for cognition (r(188) = .24, p < .01).
Overall CQ did not have a signiﬁcant relationship with need for clo-
sure (r(188) = .12, p = .10), but further analysis revealed that
motivational CQ had an expected negative correlation
(r(188) = .21, p < .01).
In summary, study 1 shows that individuals with higher CQ are
also more cooperative in DEMO, and possess a greater desire to
develop an accurate understanding of DEMO surroundings com-
pared to individuals with lower CQ. Thus, our preliminary DEMO
show evidence that CQ provides negotiators with psychological
characteristics that are beneﬁcial for engaging in effective integra-
tive negotiation processes that lead to joint DEMO at the intercul-
tural negotiation table. However, it remains to be DEMO if
negotiators with higher CQ actually engage in effective integrative
negotiation processes at the micro level in terms of their behaviors.
That is, do dyads that consist of higher CQ negotiators engage in
sequencing of integrative DEMO behaviors over and beyond other
individual difference characteristics and thereby achieve higher joint
proﬁt than dyads that consist of lower CQ negotiators?
1 DEMO also measured cooperative motives by simply counting the number of
cooperative choices made across the nine decomposed games. Correlation analysis
using this measure produced DEMO identical results as that reported in Table 1.
Further correlational analyses revealed that there is no signiﬁcant relationship
between (a) CQ and competitive DEMO and (b) CQ and individualistic motives.
Study 2: CQ and DEMO negotiation effectiveness
We reason that dyads consisting of negotiators with higher CQ
will engage in more effective sequences of integrative information
behaviors than dyads DEMO of negotiators with lower CQ.
Being more cooperative, we argue that DEMO CQ negotiators will
generally adopt more integrative negotiation strategies. Further-
more, DEMO argue that having greater desire and efﬁcacy to adapt
to the culturally diverse negotiation situation, higher CQ negotia-
tors should invest more cognitive effort into accurately under-
standing their counterparts’ behaviors for their communicative
intentions. In DEMO, we argue that the use of more integrative strate-
gies and DEMO greater investment of cognitive effort of higher CQ
negotiators will translate into more coordinated exchange of infor-
mation regarding the counterparts’ interests and priorities, result-
ing in stable sequencing of integrative information behaviors.
H3. Dyads with DEMO CQ will engage in more sequences of
integrative information behaviors (reciprocal DEMO complementary)
than dyads with lower CQ.
In addition to task-focused integrative information sequences,
we also expect higher CQ dyads will manage the DEMO relation-
ship itself by engaging in more sequences of cooperative com-
ments (e.g. expressions of enthusiasm for working together) that
would reinforce the DEMO context of the negotiation, com-
pared to lower CQ dyads. Focusing DEMO the relational aspect of inte-
grative negotiations is just as important as focusing on the task-
related aspect, given relational processes and outcomes determine
the likelihood of future relationships between negotiators.
H4. Dyads with higher CQ DEMO engage in more sequences of
cooperative relationship management behaviors than dyads with
lower CQ.
While we have formally hypothesized whether CQ as an overall
DEMO inﬂuences sequences of integrative information behav-
iors and sequences of cooperative relationship management
behaviors, we explore the relative predictive power of the four fac-
ets of CQ. Given that in study 1, motivational CQ was most consis-
tently and strongly correlated with the psychological advantages of
cooperative motives DEMO well as epistemic motivation, it may be that
motivational CQ will DEMO exert the strongest effect in terms of pre-
dicting behavioral sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors.
Furthermore, with respect to the inﬂuence of negotiation pro-
cesses on outcomes, the broader negotiation literature has found
that sequencing integrative negotiation behaviors move negotia-
tors down a cooperative path, and leads to high joint proﬁt (Adair,
2003; Olekalns & Smith, 2000, DEMO; Weingart et al., 1990, 1999).
For example, Olekalns and Smith (2000) found that dyads that en-
gage in frequent reciprocal DEMO of priority information are
more likely to reach optimal joint outcomes. However, given that
88
this literature on communication processes in negotiation has fo-
cused mostly DEMO intracultural negotiation contexts, it is important
to replicate these ﬁndings in DEMO negotiation contexts.
H5. Dyads that engage in more sequences of integrative informa-
tion behaviors (reciprocal or complementary) will achieve higher
joint proﬁt.
H6. DEMO that engage in more sequences of cooperative relation-
ship management behaviors will achieve higher joint proﬁt.
Finally, we examine the effects of dyad composition of CQ on se-
quences, that is, whether the level of DEMO of integrative infor-
mation behaviors and cooperative relationship management
behaviors is more a function of the high CQ negotiator or the low
CQ negotiator DEMO the dyad. Given that sequencing is a conjunctive
task (Steiner, 1972) in which contributions from both negotiators
are required for high performance, DEMO expect that a dyad’s level of
sequencing depends on the lowest level of CQ within the dyad, or
in other words, the ‘‘weakest DEMO Put simply, even if one negotiator
possesses high CQ, as long as the other negotiator has low CQ and
does not contribute to DEMO joint activity of reciprocating integrative
as well as cooperative behaviors, the DEMO may still suffer as a result.
H7. The level of sequencing of integrative information behaviors
and sequencing of cooperative relationship management behaviors
will be DEMO greater than that determined by the minimum level of
CQ in the dyad.
Other individual difference constructs
Along with our analysis of CQ, we simultaneously examine if
other individual difference characteristics also predict the above-
mentioned DEMO of integrative negotiation behaviors. One
theoretical limitation of the current individual differences and
negotiation literature is that research has focused exclusively on
intracultural negotiation DEMO, and little is known regarding
the potential moderating effects of other DEMO of negotiation con-
texts on the relationship between negotiator disposition and nego-
tiation processes and outcomes. Furthermore, such a theoretical
limitation is an obvious practical limitation as well, since negotia-
tors need to be selected not only on their dispositional characteris-
tics, but dispositional characteristics that ﬁt the right type of
negotiation. Thus, in our research, we include individual DEMO
characteristics that have been found or argued to be advantageous
for integrative negotiation in intracultural contexts, and examine if
they predict intercultural negotiation effectiveness.
More speciﬁcally, we examine other forms of intelligence
including cognitive ability (DEMO & Friedman, 1998; Fulmer & Bar-
ry, 2004; Kurtzberg, DEMO) and emotional intelligence (Elfenbein,
Foo, White, Tan, & DEMO, 2007; Foo, Elfenbein, Tan, & Aik, 2004; Ful-
DEMO & Barry, 2004), as well as personality traits including openness
(Ma & Jaeger, 2005) and extraversion (Barry & Friedman, 1998)DEMO Fi-
nally, another purpose for including these other individual differ-
ence DEMO is to provide a conservative test to see if CQ
predicts sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors over and
beyond the other individual difference characteristics. DEMO, we
also include international experience given it is conceptualized to
be DEMO associated with CQ (see Ang & Van Dyne, 2008).
Study 2 method
Participants
150 students (75 Americans and 75 East Asians) DEMO both
undergraduate and graduate levels were recruited through adver-
L. Imai, DEMO Gelfand / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 112 (2010) 83–98
tisements at a large public university. The advertisement speciﬁ-
cally targeted either DEMO citizens of Western European
descent,” or ‘‘East Asians who have lived in the US for less than
ﬁve years and are originally from DEMO, Japan, or Korea.” The
American sample consisted of 75 individuals (DEMO males and 47 fe-
males; MAge = 26.9), and the DEMO Asian sample also consisted of
75 individuals (28 males and 47 DEMO; MAge = 26.4). Partici-
pants were ﬁrst matched on sex DEMO level of education (under-
graduate or graduate), and then randomly DEMO to form 75
intercultural dyads. Within the dyad, participants were randomly
DEMO to one of two negotiator roles. Ten dyads had at least
one negotiator who did not give consent to being audio-taped;
thus, these dyads were excluded from analyses with a ﬁnal sam-
ple size of DEMO All students were given $20 cash cards for
participation.
Procedure
The study took part over two sessions, separated by a minimum
of one week. On the ﬁrst session, participants were asked to ﬁll out
an online questionnaire that assessed all individual difference
characteristics (i.e. cultural intelligence, emotional DEMO,
openness, extraversion, and international experience), except for
cognitive ability which was assessed with a timed-test at the end
of the second DEMO On the second session, participants were
asked to come into the DEMO to engage in a negotiation sim-
ulation. Participants ﬁrst read their role information individually,
then were brought together with their partners from the DEMO cul-
ture to engage in a negotiation simulation while being tape-re-
corded. They were given 20 min to negotiate. After the
negotiation session, both negotiators ﬁlled out a ﬁnal agreement
form that indicated their levels of DEMO Finally, participants
completed a timed-test of cognitive ability, and then were fully
debriefed.
Negotiation task
The negotiation simulation was adapted from Towers Market DEMO
which has been used in previous research on integrative bargain-
ing (DEMO Weingart, Olekalns, & Smith, 2004). This simulation in-
volved DEMO mixed-motive negotiation between a specialty grocery
shop owner and a wine shop owner. Participants were told that a
successful real estate company has proposed DEMO a multi-
functional market that consists of a wine store and a grocery store
under one roof with common décor but with separate areas DEMO
their respective top-quality products. Participants were told that
they were seriously interested in the shared market but needed
to negotiate ﬁve unresolved issues with DEMO other vendor: (1) Hours
of Operation, (2) Renovation Costs, (3) Floor Space, (4) Temperature,
and (5) DEMO Opening Date.
Participants were given a payoff schedule that listed the possi-
ble levels of settlement on each of the ﬁve negotiation issues, and
the number of points associated with each level of settlement
that indicated DEMO amount of worth of that level of settlement
to the negotiator. The structure of the payoff schedule left room
for integrative potential: Grand Opening Date and Renovation
Costs were integrative issues, Hours of Operation and Tempera-
ture were distributive issues, and Floor Space was a compatible
issue.
Individual difference measures
Cultural intelligence (CQ)
CQ was assessed with the same 20-item scale from study 1. In
the present study, overall CQ had high reliability (aAmerican = 0.90;
aEast Asian = 0.86), as well as each of its facets, including
L. Imai, M.J. Gelfand / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 112 (2010) 83–98
meta-cognitive CQ (aAmerican = 0.84, aEast Asian = DEMO), cognitive CQ
(aAmerican = 0.80, aEast Asian = 0.78), motivational CQ (aAmerican = 0.86,
aEast Asian = 0.70), and behavioral CQ (aAmerican = 0.87, aEast Asian =
0.77). All DEMO were measured on a scale from 1 (strongly dis-
agree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Cognitive ability
Cognitive ability was measured using the Wonderlic Personnel
Test (WPT; Wonderlic & Associates, 2000), a 12-min speed test
consisting of 50 questions that assesses an individual’s math and
DEMO abilities. Preliminary analyses at the individual level indi-
cated that East Asians scored signiﬁcantly lower than Americans
(MEast Asian = 24.66, SD = DEMO; MAmerican = 31.49, SD = 4.75;
t(128) = DEMO, p < .01), most likely because the Wonderlic requires
knowledge DEMO difﬁcult English proverbs. Accordingly, raw scores
were standardized into Z scores DEMO each cultural group for
analyses.
Emotional intelligence
Emotional intelligence was measured using Schutte et al.’s
(1998) 33-item scale that has been validated and DEMO developed
based on Salovey and Mayer’s (1990) conceptualization of the con-
struct (aAmerican = 0.87; aEast Asian = 0.91). An example DEMO is
‘‘When I experience a positive emotion, I know how to DEMO it
last”, and was administered on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree).
Openness to experience and extraversion
Openness to experience and extraversion were measured with
10 items each from DEMO et al.’s (2006) short version of the
International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item
for openness is, ‘‘I have excellent ideas” (aAmerican = 0.78, aEast
Asian = 0.82), and DEMO extraversion, ‘‘I am the life of the party” (aAmer-
ican = 0.90, aEast Asian = 0.89). Both were answered on a 1 (very inac-
curate) to 5 (very accurate) scale.
International experience
DEMO experience was measured as the total length of
time participants have spent living abroad, which has been val-
idated by Takeuchi, Tesluk, Yun, and Lepak (2005). Participants
were asked to list in chronological DEMO from most recent to
least recent, the countries and duration of DEMO of living
abroad. All living experiences were summed and converted to
weeks.
Demographics
Five demographic variables were measured: sex (1 = female,
DEMO = male), level of education (1 = undergraduate, 2 = graduate),
age (years), negotiation experience (1 = no, DEMO = yes), and the East
Asian’s length of stay in the US (months).
Joint proﬁt
Joint proﬁt was measured as the sum of the points earned by
both negotiators across all ﬁve issues.
Coding DEMO negotiation tactics and sequences
After all the process data had been transcribed for each dyad,
three overall steps were taken to ensure consistency DEMO coding of
negotiation tactics (elaborated below). First, the transcripts were
unitized by three research assistants, that is, parsed into units
that DEMO eventually be coded for negotiation tactics. Second,
the unitized transcripts were content-coded for negotiation tac-
tics by two coders. Because reproducibility of coding DEMO
reliability in both steps (Folger, Hewes, & Poole, 1984), reliability
89
estimates for both the unitizing process (i.e., unitizing reliability)DEMO
as well as the coding process (i.e., interpretive reliability)
were calculated. Third, sequences of negotiation tactics of theo-
retical interest were counted automatically through a computer
program.
Unitizing of transcripts
The unitizing step involved DEMO the negotiation dialogue in
each transcript into ‘‘thought units”, where a DEMO unit consists
of one idea or thought, which roughly corresponds to DEMO sentence.
Three research assistants were each given a manual of unitizing
rules, and were trained on how to unitize the transcripts through
multiple practice sessions. In each practice session, the ﬁrst author
and the three research assistants unitized a practice transcript
individually, and then went over the unitizing together, discussing
in detail any challenging cases. For example, research assistants
DEMO reminded that in some cases, multiple thought units need
to be DEMO within one sentence (e.g., ‘‘/ I want 60% of the DEMO
space” / ‘‘because my products take up more space than yours do
/”). Furthermore, they were also reminded that immediately re-
peated DEMO or ideas that were identical should be counted
as one thought unit (e.g., ‘‘/ I’d like to close later. I prefer later /DEMO
”). The research assistants continued practice sessions until they
reached a high level of agreement, or unitizing reliability, based
on three randomly DEMO full transcripts. For each of the three
transcripts, unitizing reliability was DEMO with Guetzkow’s
U(Guetzkow, 1950) for all pairs of research assistants. Guetzkow’s
U refers to ‘‘the difference between the number of units identiﬁed
DEMO an independent coder and the ‘‘true” number of units (the aver-
DEMO of two coders’ estimates; Weingart et al., 2004, p. 448)DEMO For
any one transcript, the average Guetzkow’s U across all pairs DEMO re-
search assistants was under 0.06, indicating high unitizing reliabil-
ity. DEMO three research assistants then unitized their own set of
transcripts.
Content-coding of negotiation tactics
Once the unitizing was complete for all transcripts, two cod-
ers, blind to the research hypotheses, were given coding manuals
adapted DEMO one used by Weingart et al. (2004) for their Tow-
ers Market II negotiation simulation, and were trained to content
code the unitized transcripts (see Appendix B for deﬁnition,
examples, and strategic grouping DEMO codes of negotiation tactics).
As shown in Appendix B, we DEMO for a number of negotiation
tactics that conceptually fall under two broad types of strategies:
integrative information and cooperative relationship manage-
ment. Consistent DEMO previous cross-cultural research (Adair,
2003; Adair & Brett, 2005; Adair et al., 2001), we coded for direct
and indirect ways of conveying/eliciting integrative information.
More speciﬁcally, we coded for direct integrative information
behaviors such as making issue priority statements across two
or more DEMO (IR) and questioning other’s priorities across
two or more issues (DEMO). We also coded for more indirect ways
of conveying integrative information; that is, making multi-issue
offers (OM). Cooperative relationship management involved mak-
ing miscellaneous relationship-focused cooperative comments
(R-C).
Again, coders were DEMO a coding manual and trained
through multiple practice sessions. In each practice session, the
ﬁrst author and the two coders coded a practice transcript indi-
vidually, and then went over them together, discussing in detail
DEMO differentiates each code from other codes. If any disagree-
ment emerged or if coders pointed out any particularly challeng-
ing cases, the ﬁrst author further explained the nuanced
differences among the codes. For example, coders were reminded
to only code a given tactic as an issue priority statement DEMO the
negotiator reveals priority differences across negotiation issues
90
and not within negotiation issues. Also, coders were reminded
that multi-issue offers must be offers that specify alternatives
within two or more negotiation DEMO, and mere general sugges-
tions to combine two or more negotiation DEMO should not be
counted as multi-issue offers. With such reminders from the ﬁrst
author throughout the practice sessions, the two coders gradually
developed strong agreement regarding the application of codes.
Coders were trained until they reached DEMO inter-rater reliabil-
ity, based on three randomly drawn full transcripts. The DEMO
inter-rater reliability between the two coders across the three
transcripts was high (Cohen’s K = 0.88). Once the coders reached
this high inter-rater reliability, they content-coded their own set
of transcripts.
Calculating sequences of negotiation tactics
Once all transcripts were content-coded for negotiation tactics,
the entire DEMO of codes for each dyad transcript was entered
into a computer software program (GSQ; General Sequential Que-
rier, Bakeman & Quera, 1995; see also Bakeman & Gottman, 1986)
so that sequences of integrative information behaviors and se-
quences of cooperative relationship management behaviors could
be DEMO automatically for each dyad.
Calculating sequences at the immediate time lag
In counting the frequency of sequences of integrative informa-
tion behaviors and sequences DEMO cooperative relationship manage-
ment behaviors, sequences were counted at the immediate DEMO
lag (c.f. Adair, 2003). Immediate time lags occur when the behavior
elicited by negotiator 1 is immediately followed in the next speak-
DEMO turn by the behavior elicited by negotiator 2. Appendix C illus-
trates a sample coded transcript where there are a total of six
speaking DEMO between negotiator 1 and negotiator 2. Because
there are six total speaking turns, there are ﬁve possible lag se-
quences (Nspeaking turn  DEMO) in which sequences of theoretical inter-
est can occur (i.e., DEMO turn 1 (multi-issue offer) ? speaking
turn 2 (issue priority DEMO); speaking turn 2 (issue priority
statement) ? speaking turn 3 (issue priority statement); speaking
turn 3 (issue priority statement) ? speaking turn 4 (issue priority
statement); speaking turn 4 (issue DEMO statement) ? speaking
turn 5 (issue priority statement); speaking turn 5 (issue priority
statement) ? speaking turn 6 (multi-issue offer)—in this example,
all ﬁve lag sequences are sequences of integrative information
DEMO).
Sequences of integrative information behaviors: Reciprocal and
complementary
Sequences of DEMO information behaviors were examined
in two ways: (1) reciprocal sequences DEMO (2) complementary se-
quences (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). A reciprocal sequence of inte-
grative information behaviors occurs when the two negotiation
DEMO comprising the sequence are identical (e.g. Appendix C,
speaking turn DEMO (issue priority statement) ? speaking turn 3 (issue
priority statement)). For each dyad, reciprocal sequences for each
negotiation tactic within the integrative information strategy were
counted and summed to give an overall count DEMO reciprocal se-
quences across all tactic types. A complementary sequence of inte-
grative information behaviors occurs when the two negotiation
tactics comprising the sequence DEMO not identical in terms of tacti-
cal codes, but are of DEMO same integrative information strategy (e.g.
Appendix C, speaking turn 5 (DEMO priority statement) ? speaking
turn 6 (multi-issue offer)).
Sequences DEMO cooperative relationship management behaviors
Sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors oc-
curred when a cooperative, non task-focused comment on the
L. Imai, M.J. DEMO / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 112 (2010) 83–98
negotiators’ relationship was followed by another such cooperative
comment.
To control for the DEMO number of speaking turns across
dyads (i.e., the length of the negotiation), the raw frequencies
for each type of strategic sequence were DEMO into relative
frequencies (Adair, 2003). More speciﬁcally, each raw DEMO
was divided by the dyad’s total number of speaking turns – 1.
Because the dependent variable was a proportion bounded by
0 and 1, it was then logit-transformed to stretch the tails of
the distribution as DEMO by Cohen, Cohen, West, and
Aiken (2003).
Study 2 results
Descriptive statistics
Individual-level inter-correlations among all demographic vari-
ables and individual DEMO measures are found in Table 2. Ta-
ble 3 presents the means and standard deviations of these
measures by each cultural group, as well as comparisons of means
between the two cultural groups. East Asians and DEMO did
not signiﬁcantly differ on mean levels of CQ, although East DEMO
had greater international experience (MEast Asian = 138.27, SDEast
Asian = 95.87; MAmerican = 28.06, SDAmerican = 96.93; t(122) = DEMO,
p < .01, lower openness (MEast Asian = 3.40, DEMO Asian = 0.60; MAmer-
ican = 4.18, SDAmerican = 0.46; DEMO(122) = 8.13, p < .01), and lower
extraversion (DEMO Asian = 3.09, SDEast Asian = 0.73; MAmerican = 3.37,
SDAmerican = 0.79; t(122) = 2.04, p < .05) DEMO Americans.
Prior to testing our hypotheses, all individual difference scores
were DEMO to the dyad-level by averaging the two negotia-
tors’ scores. Dyad means and standard deviations, and dyad-level
inter-correlations among individual difference measures, se-
DEMO, outcomes, as well as demographic variables are shown
in Table 4. Three dyads did not reach agreement; therefore, these
cases were excluded DEMO analyses with a ﬁnal dyad sample size
of 62.2
Tests of hypotheses
Overall CQ and negotiation process
Hypothesis 3 predicted that dyads with higher DEMO CQ would
engage in more sequences of integrative information behaviors (re-
DEMO and complementary) than dyads with lower overall CQ,
over and DEMO international experience, openness, extraversion,
cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence. DEMO were con-
ducted separately for complementary and reciprocal sequences
using hierarchical regression. For both analyses, to provide a con-
servative test, international experience, openness, extraversion,
cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence were entered in DEMO
ﬁrst step, while overall CQ was entered in the second step. DEMO
reciprocal sequences were signiﬁcantly correlated with the demo-
graphic variable of mean age (r(60) = .38, p < .01), mean age was
also included as a control variable in the ﬁrst step in DEMO re-
ciprocal sequences.
In terms of complementary sequences of integrative informa-
tion behaviors, Table 5 shows that none of the other individual dif-
ferences entered in step 1 (i.e., international experience, openness,
extraversion, DEMO ability, emotional intelligence) signiﬁcantly
improved sequences of integrative information behaviors. As
2 Including the three impasse dyads did not change results pertaining to DEMO effects
of CQ on sequences of integrative information behaviors, nor the DEMO of CQ on
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors. This was true whether
CQ was analyzed at the overall or facet level, and whether it was analyzed as the dyad
mean or dyad minimum.

hypothesized however, overall CQ at the dyad-level entered in step
2 signiﬁcantly predicted complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors (b = 0.31, p < .05; DR2 = .07, p < .05). Dyads
with higher CQ engaged in more sequences consisting of DEMO
types of integrative information behaviors. In terms of reciprocal
sequences of integrative information behaviors, Table 5 also shows
that none of the other individual differences entered in step 1 (i.e.,
international experience, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability,
emotional intelligence) nor overall CQ entered in step DEMO signiﬁ-
cantly increased reciprocal sequences of integrative information
behaviors (b = DEMO, p > .30; DR2 = .01, p = .37). DEMO, CQ appears
to have its effects on complementary sequences.
In order DEMO explore which of the four CQ facets was driving the
overall CQ effect on complementary sequences of integrative infor-
mation behaviors, we conducted additional regression analyses
entering the other individual differences into the regression equa-
tion DEMO step 1 and all four facets of CQ in step 2. Table 6 shows that
motivational CQ largely drove the effect overall CQ had DEMO comple-
mentary sequences of integrative information behaviors (b = 0.45,
DEMO < .01; DR2 = .19, p < .05).
Hypothesis 4 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ would
engage in more sequences DEMO cooperative relationship manage-
ment behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, DEMO and beyond
international experience, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability,
and DEMO intelligence. Table 7 shows that none of the other
individual differences entered in step 1 (i.e., international experi-
ence, openness, extraversion, cognitive ability, emotional intelli-
gence), nor dyad overall CQ entered in step 2 signiﬁcantly
increased sequences of cooperative relationship management
behaviors (b = 0.15, p > .30; DR2 = .02, p = .31). Analyses at the facet
level, however, revealed that when all four facets DEMO CQ were en-
tered into the regression equation in step 2 after controlling for
the other individual differences in step 1, behavioral CQ increased
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors
(b = 0.41, p < DEMO; DR2 = .12, p = .11; Table 7). Dyads DEMO higher
behavioral CQ, or verbal and non-verbal behavioral ﬂexibility, were
able to reciprocate non-task-related cooperative comments.3
3 We also explored whether dyad-level CQ DEMO any inﬂuence on the sequencing of
distributive negotiation behaviors (i.e., making single issue offers, stating one’s
preferences within a single issue, asking DEMO about the other’s preferences
within a single issue, offering substantiations, and asking questions regarding other’s
substantiations). Using multiple regression and controlling for DEMO, interna-
tional experience, extraversion, emotional intelligence and cognitive ability, we found
no signiﬁcant effects of dyad CQ (overall or facet-level) on DEMO of distributive
negotiation behaviors.

Negotiation process and DEMO outcomes
Hypotheses 5 and 6 predicted that sequences of integrative
information behaviors (reciprocal and complementary) and se-
quences of cooperative relationship management behaviors DEMO
predict joint proﬁt, respectivey. Reciprocal, complementary, and
cooperative sequences were DEMO simultaneously in the regres-
sion equation to see if each had a unique effect on joint proﬁt. Re-
sults showed that there were signiﬁcant DEMO between
reciprocal sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.35, p < .01), comple-
mentary sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.39, DEMO < .01), and coopera-
tive relationship management sequences and joint proﬁt (b = 0.29,
p < .01), supporting both hypotheses. Thus, dyads that engaged in
more sequences consisting of identical integrative behaviors, DEMO
sequences of non-identical integrative behaviors, as well as more
sequences of DEMO non-task-related comments were much
better able to create value at the negotiation table in an intercul-
tural context.4
Dyad composition
Hypothesis 7 predicted that DEMO level of sequencing of integra-
tive information behaviors and sequencing of cooperative relation-
ship management behaviors would be no greater than what is
determined DEMO the minimum level of CQ in the dyad. We addressed
this issue by substituting the dyad mean CQ score by either the
dyad minimum DEMO score (i.e. the lower CQ negotiator’s score) or
the dyad maximum CQ score (i.e. the higher CQ negotiator’s score)
to see which had more of an effect on negotiation sequences (c.f.
Barry & Friedman, 1998). The results illustrated that it is the min-
imum CQ that elicit a pattern of signiﬁcant results very similar to
those obtained DEMO using the dyad mean CQ scores. More specif-
ically, minimum overall DEMO and minimum motivational CQ had a
signiﬁcant effect on complementary sequences of integrative infor-
mation behaviors (bMin Overall CQ = 0.30, p = DEMO; bMin Motivational
CQ = 0.47, p < .01). By contrast, maximum overall CQ and maximum
motivational CQ did not have any inﬂuence on complementary se-
quences of integrative information behaviors (bMax Overall CQ = 0.13,
p > .30; bMax Motivational CQ = 0.27, p DEMO .09). For sequences of cooper-
ative relationship management behaviors, minimum DEMO
CQ had a signiﬁcant effect (b = 0.47, p < .01), whereas maximum
behavioral CQ did not (b = 0.25, p > .10). In all, this pattern of re-
sults suggests that DEMO is the negotiators with the lower CQ that
inﬂuence the extent to which dyads engage in advantageous
sequences.
Discussion
Despite the obvious importance of DEMO able to negotiate
effectively across cultures in today’s world of increasing global
interdependence, little understanding exists on what predicts
intercultural negotiation effectiveness. We set out in this paper
to investigate whether cultural intelligence (CQ) among DEMO
individual difference characteristics predict intercultural negotia-
tion effectiveness. In study 1, DEMO argued that CQ equips individ-
uals with psychological characteristics advantageous for
intercultural negotiation, and indeed, we found that individuals
with higher CQ tend DEMO have higher cooperative motives and epi-
stemic motivation than individuals with lower CQ. In study 2,
we argued that such psychological characteristics enable DEMO
CQ negotiators to overcome hurdles endemic to intercultural
negotiation contexts by adopting more integrative negotiation
strategies and investing more cognitive effort into accurately
4 DEMO also conducted additional analyses where we examined whether individual-
level CQ had an effect on individual proﬁt (using HLM), controlling for openness,
international experience, extraversion, emotional intelligence and cognitive ability.
There were no DEMO effects of CQ (overall or facet-level) on individual proﬁt.

understanding their culturally DEMO counterparts. Thus, we
expected dyads consisting of higher CQ to maintain DEMO stable
sequences of integrative negotiation behaviors, ultimately achiev-
ing more optimal DEMO than dyads consisting of lower CQ.
Consistent with this prediction, we DEMO that overall dyad CQ,
measured a week prior to negotiations predicts the extent to
which negotiators engage in complementary sequences of inte-
grative DEMO behaviors, which in turn predicts joint proﬁt.
Notably, this effect was present even when controlling for cogni-
tive ability, emotional intelligence, openness, extraversion, and
international experience. Moreover, none of these other individ-
ual DEMO characteristics increased sequences of integrative
information behaviors.

negotiation literature by moving beyond cross-cultural compari-
DEMO of negotiation, and being one of the ﬁrst to directly ask DEMO
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. As such, we identi-
ﬁed CQ as DEMO capability that improves intercultural negotiation
processes, and thereby outcomes. Second, we also contribute to
the individual differences and negotiation literature by showing
that DEMO individual difference characteristics, argued or found
to be advantageous for integrative DEMO in intracultural con-
texts, may not be so in intercultural contexts. DEMO example, our
analysis revealed that none of the other individual difference DEMO
acteristics examined, including cognitive ability (Barry & Friedman,
1998; DEMO, 1998), emotional intelligence (Elfenbein, Foo,
et al., 2007), openness (Ma & Jaeger, 2005), nor extraversion (Barry
& Friedman, 1998) signiﬁcantly improved integrative negotiation
processes. Therefore, researchers should not assume that individ-
ual difference characteristics have all-encompassing inﬂuences
on negotiation processes DEMO all situations, but instead consider
the ﬁt between the particular individual DEMO characteristic
and the speciﬁc negotiation context (e.g., intracultural vs. intercul-
tural) in inﬂuencing negotiation processes.5
This research also expands the nascent CQ literature in a num-
ber of ways. By studying in depth the relationship DEMO CQ and
micro-level behavioral processes in a negotiation context, we show
DEMO CQ can improve objective performance in addition to the self-
reported affective outcomes (e.g., cross-cultural adjustment) that
5 Notably, however, close examination of our correlation analysis in Table 1 shows
that dyad cognitive ability DEMO not related to sequencing of integrative negotiations
behavior, yet did have DEMO positive correlation with joint proﬁt (replicating past
research; e.g., Barry & Friedman, 1998). Thus, it could be that negotiators with high
cognitive ability, unlike negotiators with high cultural intelligence, arrive at mutually
DEMO outcomes via alternative routes other than the motivated cooperative
sequencing of integrative information behaviors. For example, it could be speculated
that negotiators with high cognitive ability can better analyze the complexity of the
negotiation task and DEMO information from processes such as trial and error.

has been the larger focus in this literature. DEMO, by show-
ing the positive relationship between CQ and cooperative motives,DEMO
as well as CQ and epistemic motivation in study 1, we DEMO the
nomological network of the CQ construct. By doing so, we DEMO ex-
pand upon the group decision-making literature, or more speciﬁ-
cally DEMO De Dreu et al. (2008)’s Motivated Information Processing
in Groups (MIP-G) model. The MIP-G model states that in mixed
motive group tasks like negotiation, cooperative motives and epi-
stemic motivation both inﬂuence the quality of problem solving,
dissemination of information, and the negotiation of joint deci-
sions. Recently, the authors have argued that while cooperative
motives and epistemic motivation are orthogonal constructs, cer-
tain states and/or traits should stimulate both cooperative motives
and epistemic motivation among individuals. As such, we provide
ﬁrst time support for the notion that certain psychological states,
DEMO this case CQ, can stimulate both constructs.
While our main ﬁnding DEMO that overall CQ predicts sequences
of integrative information behaviors, analyses at DEMO facet level re-
vealed that motivational CQ strongly drove this effect. This ﬁnding
is perhaps not surprising, considering our theory is that CQ pro-
vides negotiators with cooperative motives and epistemic motiva-
tion, and motivational CQ seems to have the most obvious
conceptual ties to both these constructs DEMO to the other fac-
ets. For example, individuals with higher motivational DEMO enjoy
interacting with people from different cultures; thus, are less likely
to make ingroup–outgroup distinctions and are more likely to have
cooperative motives DEMO individuals with lower CQ. Furthermore,
individuals with higher motivational CQ enjoy unfamiliar cultures
and are self-efﬁcacious in adapting to situations of cultural diver-
DEMO; therefore, when faced with intercultural communication
ambiguities, they should persist DEMO invest great effort into form-
ing an accurate understanding of their culturally unfamiliar coun-
terparts and surroundings—in other words, have high epistemic
motivation. Thus, motivational CQ seems to be most strongly re-
lated to both cooperative motives and epistemic motivation at
the same time, relative to meta-cognitive CQ (i.e., mindfulness
and adjustment of one’s own cultural knowledge), cognitive DEMO
(i.e., cross-cultural knowledge), and behavioral CQ (i.e., behavioral
ﬂexibility). Furthermore, the fact that high motivational CQ pre-
dicts sequences of integrative information behaviors parallels US
intracultural negotiation research, which has found that highly
efﬁcacious negotiators engage in more open information exchange
(O’Connor & Arnold, 2001). We expand this literature by showing
that self-efﬁcacy speciﬁcally for cross-cultural encounters is key
to developing and maintaining sequences of information exchange
DEMO
This research also illustrates that different facets of CQ relate to
different behavioral processes. For example, we found that behav-
ioral CQ predicts sequences of cooperative relationship manage-
ment behaviors. In the broader social psychological literature, the
sequencing or reciprocation of cooperative behaviors in itself is a
widespread DEMO (Braver, 1975; Cialdini, Green, & Rusch,
1992; Rosenbaum, 1980) based on the norm of reciprocity (Gould-
ner, 1960)DEMO In our research, we found that the reciprocation of non
task-related DEMO comments in particular, occurs more fre-
quently among negotiators with higher DEMO CQ—the ability
to respond appropriately both verbally and non-verbally to cultur-
ally different others. Notably, however, motivational CQ did not re-
late to DEMO type of reciprocation. It could be speculated that the
reciprocation of non task-related comments such as pleasantries
and expressing enthusiasm for working together, as an interper-
sonal skill, is more strongly inﬂuenced by negotiators’ ability to ad-
just their tone, accent, and facial expressions (i.e., behavioral DEMO)
while having intrinsic motivation and efﬁcacy in adjusting to
new cultures (i.e., motivational CQ) has greater relevance for the
ability to identify mutually beneﬁcial agreements.
Finally, in terms of dyad composition, we found DEMO the nego-
tiator with the lower level of CQ rather than the negotiator with
the higher level of CQ had more of an impact DEMO the extent to
which the dyad engaged in effective sequences. If one considers
the conjunctive nature (Steiner, 1972) of the task of sequencing,
this dyad composition effect makes sense. Sequencing integrative
behaviors is a DEMO task that requires the contributions of both
negotiators; thus, the dyad-level performance can only be as good
as its ‘‘weakest link.” Even if DEMO negotiator within the dyad has
high CQ and tries to adopt an integrative strategy with the goal
of becoming synchronized with the other, if the other lower CQ
negotiator does not reciprocate the integrative behaviors, overall,
the dyad still suffers as a result. For example, the higher CQ nego-
tiator’s requests at exchanging integrative information may be ig-
nored DEMO the lower CQ negotiator. Alternatively, the higher CQ
negotiator may have DEMO ask multiple times for integrative informa-
tion, or even explain the DEMO of using integrative strategies
before the lower CQ negotiator reciprocates. In either case, it would
be the lower CQ negotiator rather than the higher CQ negotiator
who would prevent the continuous, immediate exchange of inte-
grative behaviors necessary to achieve high joint gains.
Practical implications
Global interdependence requires DEMO people negotiate on a daily
basis across cultural boundaries. We now have initial evidence that
this process is facilitated particularly by cultural intelligence. As
DEMO, managers, diplomats, military personnel, among many others,
who are in such situations should be selected for their level of cul-
tural DEMO While it is widespread practice for American
ﬁrms to select individuals for overseas assignments primarily based
on technical experience and competence (Black et al., 1991; Moran
et al., 1987), managers should also consider in conjunction with
these factors, their employees’ CQ in negotiation contexts. Of
course, organizations cannot control the CQ level of their employ-
ees’ negotiation counterparts; yet they can be sure that their own
employees who are negotiating interculturally do not have low lev-
els of CQ which will hamper DEMO as this research has shown.
Furthermore, in addition to selection, managers should also develop
training programs for negotiators to increase their CQ. For DEMO,
given the central role of the motivational facet of CQ in predicting
intercultural negotiation effectiveness, employees might be trained
to increase their self-efﬁcacy, particularly in terms of adapting to
new cultures. Indeed, the goal-setting DEMO in the US has shown
that setting challenging and speciﬁc goals increases the resiliency of
individuals’ self-efﬁcacy beliefs (e.g., Gist, 1987). Accordingly, man-
agers might implement programs to increase motivational CQ
through training that focuses on setting challenging and speciﬁc
goals pertaining to cross-cultural adaptation.
Limitations DEMO future research
All research methods have limitations (McGrath, Martin, &
Kulka, 1982), and this study is no exception. Given that this re-
search was conducted in the laboratory which maximizes internal
control, future research should examine the impact of CQ on nego-
tiations within real DEMO settings. In addition, we used a self-re-
port measure of CQ, where although it has been validated,
nevertheless has limitations associated with DEMO Future re-
search should use more objective methods (e.g., peer assessments,
direct observations) to provide converging evidence for our ﬁnd-
ings. Our research suggests that relying on more objective assess-
ments is particularly important DEMO the cognitive facets of CQ.
Surprisingly, neither meta-cognitive CQ nor cognitive DEMO was corre-
lated with need for cognition, and this may suggest DEMO measuring
the cognitive dimensions of CQ with self-report is particularly not

95
optimal. In addition to the self-report measure of DEMO, we also used a
self-report measure of emotional intelligence. However, although
existing performance-based tests of emotional intelligence (e.g.,
MSCEIT; Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, & Sitarenios, 2003) would alleviate
disadvantages associated with self-report DEMO, the validity of
such tests for different cultural samples is unclear. DEMO example,
some questions present participants with a hypothetical social sit-
uation and ask them to identify emotions that would be helpful to
have DEMO those contexts (e.g., ‘‘What mood might be helpful to feel
when meeting in-laws for the very ﬁrst time?”). Given the different
DEMO and norms associated with such situations, it is unlikely
that there DEMO one ‘‘objective” emotionally intelligent answer that
generalizes across cultural contexts. The self-report measure of
emotional intelligence on the other hand asks participants to rate
DEMO emotional intelligence in general, without asking them to
think about culture-speciﬁc DEMO Finally, the vast majority
of intercultural negotiation studies have focused on DEMO be-
tween Americans and East Asians, and this study is no DEMO
Future research should move beyond examining Paciﬁc Rim cul-
tures to see if the positive effects of CQ on intercultural negotiation
effectiveness generalize to DEMO between other cultures
(e.g., the Middle East) as well.
There DEMO a number of research questions that arise from our
investigation that currently await future research. For example,
while our study focused on the DEMO of CQ in an intercultural context,
it remains to be seen whether CQ can also beneﬁt intracultural nego-
tiation. On one hand, given that CQ provides negotiators with coop-
erative motives, it is reasonable to suspect that it can also be
advantageous in intracultural contexts. On the DEMO hand, high CQ
negotiators might not have their prosocial and epistemic DEMO
activated as much in intracultural situations. Future studies examin-
ing the effects of CQ on negotiation among mono-cultural dyads of
East Asians as well DEMO Americans would help delineate this issue.
Furthermore, future research should examine DEMO further detail
whether high CQ negotiators rely on sequencing culturally norma-
tive behaviors, culturally non-normative behaviors, or both, on their
path to optimal negotiation outcomes.6 Future research should also
apply the ﬁne-grained analysis of the DEMO of verbal negotiation
behaviors as studied in this research to the sequencing of non-verbal
behaviors which has not received much attention in the intercultural
DEMO literature. In addition, it would be worthwhile to explore
whether there DEMO a ‘‘dark side” to CQ. Our research on integrative nego-
tiation focused on a relatively cooperative context where negotiators
cultivated relationships; however, there DEMO competitive contexts
such as disputing where negotiators focus on dissolving relationships
amidst strong negative emotions. Possibly, these competitive negoti-
ation contexts may moderate the prosocial inﬂuences of CQ found in
our research, such that high CQ negotiators take advantage of their
extensive cultural knowledge and behavioral ﬂexibility in DEMO to de-
ceive their lower CQ counterparts. In other words, in DEMO with
what the military strategist Sun Tzu would prescribe, high CQ DEMO
ators may be better able to keep their friends close but to keep their
enemies closer (Sun Tzu & Giles, 2005) in hyper-competitive intercul-
tural contexts. Finally, given that the dyadic composition of CQ is an
important predictor of effective negotiation sequences, future re-
search should continue to explore issues of ‘ﬁt.’ For example, it would
be interesting to use polynomial regressions to examine how negoti-
ators’ CQ levels ﬁt to DEMO negotiation processes and outcomes.
Conclusion
This research moved beyond cross-cultural comparisons of
negotiation behaviors to directly examine negotiation behaviors
as they occur in intercultural DEMO This study illustrates that
CQ is a key predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness.
Practically speaking, employees should be selected on CQ to max-
imize the chances of optimal agreements in intercultural negotia-
tions. In a world DEMO there is increasing opportunities for
cooperation as well as threats of conﬂict at the global level for
managers and political leaders alike, CQ holds the promise for
helping us manage our global interdependence.
