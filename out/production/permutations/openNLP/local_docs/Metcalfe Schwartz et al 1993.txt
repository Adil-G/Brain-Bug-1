The Cue-Familiarity Heuristic in Metacognition
Janet Metcalfe, Bennett DEMO Schwartz, and Scott G. Joaquim
Four experiments contrasted the cue-familiarity hypothesis DEMO feeling-of-knowing judgments
(FKJs) and tip-of-the-tongue feelings (TOTs) to the target-retrievability hypothesis. Familiarity of
the cues was contrasted to memorability of the targets DEMO a paired-associate design (e.g., A-B A-B,
A-B A-B', A-B A-D, A-B C-D), in which the number of repetitions of the cue A terms was
dissociated from the memorability of the target B DEMO Little support was found for the target-
retrievability hypothesis, because in DEMO of the 4 experiments were FKJs related to target
memorability. In one experiment, an omnibus retrieval hypothesis (which implicates total retrieval
rather than DEMO correct retrieval) and the cue-familiarity hypothesis produced isomorphic predic-
tions that DEMO borne out by the FKJ and TOT results. All 4 experiments supported the cue-
familiarity hypothesis, because FKJs and TOTs were directly related to the number of presentations
(and thereby the familiarity) of the cues.
DEMO article investigates how people make judgments
about their own future cognition. Much research has been
directed at the manner in which people make judgments DEMO
der uncertainty (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982;
Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973).
Traditionally, this research DEMO focused on predictions about
events in the world, rather than internally DEMO predic-
tions. And there has been some progress in understanding the
heuristics people use. Recently, though, there has been an
upsurge of interest DEMO the special domain—often thought to
be critical for intelligently controlled behavior—dealing with
people's judgments about their own future knowledge and
cognitive abilities (Blake, 1973; R. Brown & McNeill, 1966;
Butterfield, Nelson, & Peck, 1988; Flavell, 1979; Gruneberg
& Monks, 1974; Hart, 1965, 1967; Koriat & Lieblich, 1974;
Lupker, Harbluk, & Patrick, 1991; Metcalfe, 1986; T. Nel-
son, Gerler, & DEMO, 1984; T. Nelson & Narens, 1990;
Reder, 1987, DEMO; Schacter, 1983; Wellman, 1977, 1983).
These are called DEMO judgments. Our concern is in
understanding the mechanisms and heuristics used in this
special domain.
In a typical metamemory paradigm, people are asked the
answers to a variety of memory questions. The manner in
which they DEMO these answers initially may vary. On
those questions on which they are unable to give a correct
answer, they are requested to make a feeling-of-knowing
judgment (FKJ), that is, they are asked to assess DEMO likely

DEMO
it is that they will be able to attain the answer in a subsequent
test (that may or may not be different from the first test).
People are willing to make these judgments. Under some
DEMO, the assessments that they give show some
accuracy: They know whether or not they will be able to
remember an event later, even though they cannot remember
it at the time of making the judgment (Blake, 1973; Hart,
1965, 1967; Metcalfe, 1986; T. DEMO, Leonesio, Shima-
mura, Landwehr, & Narens, 1982; Schacter, DEMO). How peo-
ple make these judgments is the specific concern investigated
in the experiments that follow.
We initially consider two possibilities for the DEMO
base of these judgments: first, familiarity with or knowledge
about the cue, and second, partial information about the tar-
get. When we DEMO to target-based information, we mean
correct information about the target itself. DEMO mechanisms
may not be mutually exclusive, of course. It is most DEMO
that FKJs are based on factors entirely irrelevant to the task
at hand. If they were, then manipulations that influence either
cue familiarity or target retrievability would have no effect.
Much data show that such variables DEMO influence judgments
(Blake, 1973; Koriat & Lieblich, 1977; Lupker DEMO al., 1991;
T. Nelson et al., 1982; Reder, 1987; Reder & Ritter, 1992;
Schwartz & Metcalfe, 1992).
Probably the idea that FKJs are based on partial retrieval
of the target DEMO is the most intuitive explanation for how
these judgments are made. Even so, the empirical results
favoring the idea are not overwhelming. Indeed, DEMO
from four independent laboratories points to the importance
of the cues rather than the targets (Costermans, Lories, &
Ansay, 1992; Glenberg, Sanocki, Epstein, & Morris, 1987;
Metcalfe, 1993; Reder, DEMO; Reder & Ritter, 1992; Schwartz
& Metcalfe, 1992). Metcalfe (1993), in proposing that the
basic memory system requires a monitoring and control
mechanism to function normally, outlined a number of lines
of evidence, mentioned below, suggest that people usually do
not base their DEMO on partial retrieval of the target, but might
instead use cue-related DEMO
First, in the standard paradigm for FKJs, subjects give
estimates of the likelihood that they will later be able to

remember DEMO answers to questions to which they cannot
remember the answers at the time of the initial test. It seems
reasonable to suppose that information DEMO than the explicit
target information, which they have just demonstrated they
DEMO retrieve, underlies the judgments. Second, there are
differences in feeling of knowing among different error
types, such that errors of omission are given lower FKJs than
are errors of commission (Krinsky & Nelson, 1985)DEMO Pre-
sumably, if people were basing their judgments on what was
DEMO, but the experimenter let them know that what had
just been DEMO was wrong (as occurs in these experi-
ments), their feeling-of-knowing DEMO for those items
should be especially low rather than especially high, DEMO the
data show. Metcalfe (1993) argued that the cues that evoke
commission errors are probably more familiar than those that
evoke nothing, because at least they were familiar enough to
lead to some response. The DEMO for omission errors were so
unfamiliar that they produced no response. This finding is
consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. Third, if FKJs
were based only on retrieved information, then latencies to
make these judgments would be slower than retrieval laten-
cies. However, Reder (1987, 1988) found DEMO FKJ latencies
were faster than retrieval latencies. Fourth, Reder (1988)
found that priming of the cues spuriously increased peoples'
feelings of DEMO without increasing their ability to answer
the questions. Similarly, Glenberg et DEMO (1987) found a large
positive correlation between peoples' domain knowledge, or
the familiarity of the cues, and their FKJs, even in DEMO absence
of any accuracy of detailed predictions (see Costermans et
al., 1992, and Maki & Serra, 1992, for related results). Reder
and Ritter (1992) investigated a strategy-judgment paradigm
in which subjects were DEMO the choice of whether to retrieve
or to calculate the results of arithmetic problems. The fa-
miliarity of the questions and the answers was DEMO Their
results pointed to the importance of cue familiarity. Fifth,
Jameson, Narens, Goldfarb, and Nelson (1990) affected
memory performance without changing the FKJs. They ta-
chistoscopically (near the threshold of consciousness) pre-
DEMO subjects with some of the targets to general informa-
tion questions. This resulted in an increase in recall, but had
no discernible effect on FKJs. The fact that target retriev-
ability may be altered without influencing DEMO suggests that
the judgments are not based on target information. Sixth, DEMO
Kolers and Palef (1976) observed, people know what they do
DEMO know. It does not appear that they make these judgments
by trying to retrieve what they do know because "don't
know" judgments DEMO be made very quickly. The fast la-
tencies are consistent with judgments based on unfamiliar
cues. Seventh, explicit "don't know" information results in
impairment on "don't know" judgments. Glucksberg and
McCloskey (1981) gave subjects statements indicating that
certain information was not known (e.g., "It is not known
whether Gabriel owns a saxophone"). If DEMO were basing
their judgments on what they retrieved, they should have
DEMO better at making "don't know" judgments as a result of
this information. However, the experimental results showed
that the explicit "don'DEMO know" information impaired perfor-
mance, presumably because the explicit information made
the cues seem more familiar.
In addition to these results, an initial result (Yaniv &
Meyer, 1987) thought to favor the target DEMO hy-
pothesis has recently been reexamined (Connor, Balota, &
Neely, 1992) and appears instead to point toward the cue-
familiarity hypothesis. DEMO and Meyer (1987) gave sub-
jects word definition problems such as "A statement that is
seemingly contradictory or opposed to common sense and
yet is perhaps true?" (paradox). Subjects were required to
give TOTs and FKJs on those problems they could not im-
mediately solve. DEMO judgments were found to be corre-
lated with quickened reaction time on a subsequent lexical-
decision task on the targets. They also related to DEMO
recognition reaction time. Yaniv and Meyer interpreted these
results as indicating that the questions had partially activated
the representations of the targets, that these targets were more
speedily processed later, and that the FKJs were based on the
partial activation. This interpretation was challenged by Con-
nor et DEMO (1992), who replicated Yaniv and Meyer's results,
but DEMO also found that the effect occurred even if the ques-
tion and the FKJs were made 1 week after the tests of lexical
decision DEMO recognition. Speeded reaction time as a result
of partial activation of the target from the test that had not
yet occurred was not a DEMO explanation of the data. Connor
et al. argued that the FKJs were made on the basis of fa-
miliarity with the domain of the DEMO For domains that were
highly familiar (and hence had high FKJs) subjects tended to
respond quickly, but in domains about which the subjects
knew little (and hence gave low FKJs) the times were ac-
DEMO slow.
The most compelling extant data indicating a target-based
locus of metacognitive judgments revolves around the tip-
of-the-tongue (TOT) feeling. TOTs refer to DEMO subjective
feeling that people sometimes have of being on the verge of
recalling the target word. In contrast, FKJs are a voluntary
estimate of the likelihood of recognizing the target word. The
mere fact that people DEMO experience TOTs (A. Brown, 1991;
R. Brown & McNeill, DEMO; Koriat & Lieblich, 1974) and
that they are sometimes able DEMO report the first letter or the
number of syllables of the to-be-remembered word when
they are in a TOT state suggests that partial information DEMO
available to them. If it is available, then it might be DEMO
connected to the TOT states and to FKJs. A few experiments
have produced data consistent with this idea. Blake (1973)
showed that partial recall of three-letter trigrams was related
to higher FKJs. Schacter and Worling (1985) demonstrated
that subjects could recall better the affective valence of un-
recalled items given high FKJs than those given lower FKJs.
Although suggestive, both studies were correlational in na-
ture and did not manipulate the DEMO of partial infor-
mation. Indeed, Schacter (1981) reported a correlation DEMO
tween cue and target recognition, so these results could have
been DEMO to either factor. Because TOT responses appear to
be of critical importance to the target retrievability hypoth-
esis, we shall explore them in Experiments 3 and 4.
Some potential evidence for the target-retrievability hy-
pothesis was DEMO reported by Schwartz and Metcalfe (1992).
In their experiments, cue familiarity was varied by a priming
manipulation, following the lead of Reder (1987). Retriev-
ability was manipulated by having subjects either read or
CUE FAMILIARITY IN METACOGNITION
853
generate a rhyming word to the cue DEMO (Slamecka & Graf,
1978) or read an unrelated word or by target priming. In three
of the four experiments, the magnitudes of the FKJs were
affected by the cue-familiarity manipulation but not by the
DEMO retrievability manipulation. In one experiment,
though, priming either the cue DEMO the target after the initial
recall task affected the feeling of knowing. The target prim-
ing might have been thought to have affected partial DEMO
retrievability. Although Schwartz and Metcalfe argued that
certain peculiarities of the experiment produced the target
retrievability effects on FKJs, and although when they al-
tered them in a subsequent experiment no effect of target
priming on DEMO was found, it still seems prudent to explore
further the idea DEMO only cue familiarity underlies FKJs. The
data, although suggestive, are not yet conclusive, and which
factors may have the greatest impact on FKJs with different
tasks are not yet known.
The present investigation had several DEMO The first
was to contrast the cue-familiarity versus the target-
retrievability hypothesis in a way different from that of either
Reder (1987), Reder and Ritter (1992), or Schwartz and Met-
calfe (1992). DEMO the first two experiments presented here we
capitalized on the fact that the standard conditions within the
interference theory paradigm (e.g., A-B A-B, A-B A-B', A-B
A-D, A-B C-D) allowed us to vary DEMO repetition (i.e., the
number of repetitions of A) in a DEMO that is not linked to
memorability of the target (B, in this case). (In the experi-
ments that follow we shall switch the notation so that the
target B is always second. Thus we DEMO refer to the A-D A-B
condition. This is done so that it is clear that the nature of
the target itself is the same DEMO all conditions and refers to the
last pairing with the cue.) DEMO second purpose of these ex-
periments was to investigate the relation between tip-of-the-
tongue feelings and feelings of knowing. Whether TOT feel-
ings are DEMO to FKJs and whether the same or different
factors influence TOTs as FKJs is investigated in Experi-
ments 3 and 4.
A-B A-B situation. DEMO A-B' A-B situation results in the next
best transfer. The C-D DEMO list structure is traditionally con-
sidered to be the control condition in which no transfer oc-
curs. Finally, an A-D A-B relation results in negative transfer.
The paradigm is especially interesting for the purposes of
distinguishing DEMO effects of memorability or target retriev-
ability from cue familiarity on FKJs because the number of
times the cue is repeated does not reflect DEMO Spe-
cifically, despite the fact that the cue is repeated twice DEMO the
A-D A-B condition, recall is expected to be the worst DEMO that
condition. In the C-D A-B condition, the cue is only DEMO
sented once, but memorability is expected to be better in that
DEMO than in the maximum interference condition, al-
though certainly not as DEMO as in the A-B A-B condition. So
the rank ordering of the conditions if FKJs were based on
target memorability should be A-B A-B > A-B' A-B > C-D
A-B > A-D A-B. On the other DEMO, the rank ordering of
conditions if cue repetition were critical in DEMO of know-
ing judgments should be A-B A-B = A-B' A-B DEMO A-D A-B
> C-D A-B.
Method
Experiment 1
Subjects. The participants in this experiment were 30 intro-
ductory psychology students at Dartmouth College who DEMO given
partial course credit in exchange for their participation. Subjects
were tested individually in 1-hr sessions.
Materials. The words used in the lists were DEMO two-
syllable words that were selected at random from the Toronto Word
Pool (Murdock, 1968). In the A-B' A-B condition, the DEMO and B'
words were synonyms of one another. The closest possible syn-
onyms were chosen (by scanning a dictionary). Examples were
lucky/fortunate or enough!sufficient. Subjects were presented with
a single list of cue-target DEMO The second half of the list included
the 48 pairs that made up the critical pairs in each of the four
conditions, such that there were 12 pairs in each condition. Mate-
rials were presented by DEMO computers to subjects in a ran-
dom order that maintained the first-half-second-half distinction.
Procedure. Subjects were instructed that they were to learn a
list DEMO pairs of items in such a way that when later presented with
the left item (i.e., the cue) they could recall the right item (i.e., the
target). If a particular cue was paired DEMO more than one item, the
subjects were instructed to recall the DEMO item with which it was
paired. The 96 item pairs (which DEMO both repetitions within
the four conditions) were given at a rate DEMO 2 s per pair with a 2-s
pause between presentations. Following presentation, subjects were
given the cue items and asked to type in the targets. The computer
scored, on-line, whether the answer was correct or DEMO
For the incorrect items, subjects were asked to make a feeling-
DEMO judgment on a scale from 1 to 100, on which 100 DEMO
that the subjects were sure they would be able to recognize the
correct target when presented with a forced-choice recognition test
and 1 meant DEMO they had no idea what the correct answer would
be and would be unable to recognize it. In this experiment, though
not in those that follow, the program disallowed the same numerical
judgment. We did this here so that there would be no ties in the
rankings of DEMO We did not specifically allude to a guessing
probability (though occasionally DEMO subject would ask about it and
the experimenter would answer the question).
Subjects were then given an eight-alternative forced-choice rec-
ognition test. The DEMO was one of the alternatives and was placed
in a random position with respect to the other options. The other
In this experiment cue DEMO and target retrievability
were both varied by taking advantage of the recall and rep-
etitions relations in classic interference theory paradigms.
Subjects were presented DEMO a cued-recall list in which the
cue A was paired with a target word B. They were told that
they were to remember B DEMO that when later given A they
would be able to recall or recognize the item with which it
was paired. Then they were given DEMO second half of the list
in which the relations depended on the first half. Sometimes
the A items were given again and paired with DEMO identical
terms with which they were initially paired (A-B A-B).
DEMO the A term was paired with an item similar but
not identical to the original B term (A-B' A-B). Sometimes
the A DEMO was paired with a new and unrelated word (A-D
A-B). DEMO, sometimes the A term was not repeated, but
an entirely new cue-target pair was given in its stead (C-D
A-B). The transfer relations on the second paired-associate
list are well established (Martin, 1965; Osgood, 1949). Best
transfer, as measured by recall of B, normally occurs in an

choices DEMO words randomly chosen from the Toronto Word Pool
with the constraint that they did not occur elsewhere in the exper-
iment. We computed mean DEMO, gammas, recall, and cued rec-
ognition proportions for all conditions DEMO each subject. The sum-
mary data for each measure on the basis of each subject comprised
the data entered into the analyses of variance DEMO below.
Results
In the Results section for this and subsequent experiments,
the criterion for considering an effect or interaction to be
significant was DEMO at a p value less than or equal to .05, as
DEMO by Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon. P values will,
therefore, not be stated (unless we are discussing a trend, i.e.,
.05 < p < .10) that did not quite reach our designated cutoff
for significance. The Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon measures
the extent to which the correlation between observations
violates DEMO assumption of sphericity, which is required for
the univariate measures hypothesis DEMO (Stevens, 1986). The
memory results will be presented first; DEMO metamemory re-
sults will follow.
Recall. Table 1 shows the level of cued recall as a func-
tion of experimental condition. The results are DEMO
with the findings from interference theory and with our ex-
pectations. The A-B A-B condition showed the highest level
of recall (M = .39), followed by the A-B' A-B condition
(.33), the C-D DEMO condition (.19), and finally the A-D A-B
condition (.17), F(3, 87) = 19.53, MSe = .02. Newman-
Keuls post hoc tests (Winer, 1971, p. 528) revealed that the
A-B DEMO and A-B' A-B conditions were significantly dif-
ferent from the C-D DEMO and A-D A-B conditions.
Recognition. The recognition hit rates were: .72 DEMO the
A-B A-B condition, .56 for the A-B' A-B, .59 DEMO A-D A-B,
and .48 for the C-D A-B condition, F(DEMO, 87) = 13.00, MSe
= .02. Newman-Keuls post hoc tests DEMO that the C-D
A-B condition was lower than the other three conditions
combined, and the A-B A-B condition was higher than each
of the other three conditions. These results are also shown in
Table 1.
FKJs. DEMO can be seen in Figure 1, the average magnitude
of the DEMO did not reflect the memorability of the conditions,
as given by either the initial recall test or the final recognition
test, but rather mirrored the number of times the cue was
repeated. In those conditions DEMO repeated the cue FKJs were
high, whereas in the condition in DEMO the cue was presented
only once the average feeling-of-knowing magnitude was
low, F(3, 87) = 12.64, MSe = 83.13. Newman-Keuls post

Correlation between feeling of knowing and recognition.
Gamma correlations (see Nelson, 1984) relating the FKJs to
recognition accuracy are not a major concern of this article,
but because DEMO results may be of archival value we report
the correlations for this and subsequent experiments in the
Appendix.
Discussion
The magnitude of the FKJs DEMO the number of
times the cue had been presented. Thus, the DEMO of this
experiment provided support for the idea that manipulated
cue familiarity is linked to feeling-of-knowing estimations.
Our measures of memorability—initial recall and later
DEMO somewhat different patterns, espe-
cially in the A-D A-B condition, which was lowest in recall
but in the middle of the other conditions DEMO recognition. It is
not clear which of these two measures is more appropriate
as an indicator of memorability of the target (though, of
DEMO, both of these were different from the pattern of
FKJs). DEMO recall measure, though showing a memorability
pattern consistent with past literature, suffers from the fact
that it includes the recalled items—items that were DEMO
when FKJs were made. To allow that the initial recall data
accurately reflect the memorability of the unrecalled targets
we have to assume that DEMO unrecalled items in each condi-
tion were affected by the manipulation in the same way as
were the recalled items. To make this inference, one would
like corroborating evidence from the second test. However,
the DEMO results were somewhat different from those
of the initial recall. Even so, the pattern of metacognitive
ratings did not reflect either memorability measure. Instead,
the FKJs reflected the number of times the cue was re-
DEMO, consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis.
We thought that one problem with DEMO recognition measure
as an unbiased measure of memory was the nature of the
CUE FAMILIARITY IN METACOGNITION
855
lures. This has been shown in a DEMO of other experiments
(e.g., Blake, 1973; McCloskey & Zaragoza, DEMO) to be an
important factor in determining the outcome of the DEMO For
example, in Experiment 1 correct recognition could occur
solely on DEMO basis of the familiarity of the target, rather than
because subjects DEMO about the relation between the cue and
the target. In addition, DEMO items that might cause interference
were not included among the alternatives and therefore could
not interfere. This exclusion may have resulted in the un-
DEMO high level of recognition in the A-D A-B con-
dition. We designed the second experiment to attempt rep-
lication of the results of Experiment DEMO on FKJs and to
investigate this possibility concerning recognition.

Results
Experiment 2
There were no interactions between sessions and any of the
manipulated variables on any of the dependent variables,DEMO
therefore the data were collapsed across sessions. The mem-
ory tests are presented first, followed by the metamemory
results.
Initial recall. Recall from this experiment is shown in
Table 2. As had been the case in DEMO first experiment, there
were differences between conditions in recall, F(3, 69) =
146.54, MSe = .00. Newman-Keuls post hoc tests revealed
that the A-B A-B condition was best, followed by the A-B'
A-B condition. In this experiment, recall in the A-D A-B
condition and in the C-D A-B condition were not signifi-
cantly different from one DEMO
Recognition. The recognition test produced a different
pattern from that found in Experiment 1, as is shown in Table
2. There was an overall effect of the conditions on recog-
nition, F(3, 69) = 50.93, MSe = .01. Newman-Keuls post
hoc tests showed that the targets were recognized best in the
A-B A-B condition and next best in DEMO C-D A-B condition.
In both the A-B' A-B condition and the DEMO A-B condition
recognition was low, and these two were at the DEMO level.
The reason for this pattern of recognition is undoubtedly
attributable to the nature of the lures. In the two conditions
that showed high DEMO, there was no alternative in the
test set that had been DEMO with the cue. Recognition in the
A-B A-B condition had an advantage because the pair had
been repeated. In the other two conditions, however, the dis-
tractor that had initially been presented with the cue was one
of the alternatives present in the test. It is reasonable to DEMO
pose that interference from this alternative was responsible
for the low level of recognition.
FKJs. As had been the case in Experiment 1, the FKJs
were related to the number of repetitions of the cues, rather
than to the level of recall or recognition, F(3, 69) = 20.99,
MSe = 00. Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis showed that DEMO
A-B A-B condition (.42), the A-B' A-B condition (.46), and
the A-D A-B condition (.48), conditions in which the DEMO was
presented twice, all showed higher mean FKJs than did the
DEMO A-B condition (.37), in which the cue was presented only
DEMO This pattern is shown in Figure 2.
The second experiment was similar to the first, except that
we altered the nature of the lures used at time of recognition
to make the recognition situation more like DEMO original recall
situation and so that the recognition test would more rea-
sonably reflect what was retrievable and confusable in mem-
ory. Specifically, the forced-choice recognition alternatives
included the items expected to cause interference with the
DEMO We expected that, because these alternatives presum-
ably could not be DEMO easily in recall, this choice of
lures would produce a recognition DEMO different from that
found in the first experiment and more like that found in
recall. Our hypothesis, though, was that the FKJs would DEMO
be directly related to the number of repetitions of the cues (DEMO
in Experiment 1) and not to target retrievability as measured
by DEMO recall or recognition.
Method
The subjects were 24 Dartmouth College undergraduates taking
an introductory psychology course. Subjects participated in ex-
change for extra credit DEMO their course. The method was the same
as that of Experiment 1 with several exceptions. The most important
change was in the structure of DEMO lures in the final recognition
phase. In this experiment the recognition test alternatives were the
target B item; a close associate of the target (which in the A-B' A-B
condition was the B' item but in the other conditions was an un-
presented associate); an unrelated DEMO (which in the A-D A-B
condition was the D word and DEMO the other conditions was an ex-
tralist lure); a close associate of the unrelated word (so that the
subject could not guess the target by means of the uneven con-
struction of the test alternatives); an intralist word, but one that was
not paired with the DEMO A (i.e., the so-called D word in the C-D A-B
condition); and a close associate of the intralist word. Each subject
participated DEMO four sessions with new words in each session. The
B' items DEMO this experiment were associates, rather than synonyms,
as in the DEMO experiment. The associates were selected from the
norms of D. Nelson, DEMO, and Schreiber (1989). Each associate
chosen was neither a synonym nor an antonym of the first word, but
each still resulted in higher than 3% production rates in the free
association norms. The order DEMO tasks was study, initial recall, FKJ
task, and final recognition.

not the DEMO of the targets, whether that memora-
bility was measured by the DEMO recall or by the later rec-
ognition test. The initial recall and the recognition test
showed more similar patterns in this experiment than they
DEMO in Experiment 1. They also more closely conformed
to the classic transfer patterns expected by interference the-
ory. In particular, the A-B A-B condition was best, the C-D
A-B condition was in the middle, and DEMO A-D A-B condi-
tion was worst. There was a discrepancy in the A-B' A-B
condition such that in recall this condition was high,
whereas in recognition it was low. This is an unusual con-
dition DEMO performance in it might depend on the exact
relations between the items. The inclusion of the highly
associated lures no doubt contributed to the DEMO perfor-
mance in recognition.
The results of Experiment 2 were consistent with those of
Experiment 1. The three conditions showing high feelings of
knowing DEMO those in which the cues were repeated, re-
gardless of the DEMO memorability of the targets in
those conditions. The condition in which the feeling-of-
knowing magnitude was low was the condition in which the
cue DEMO presented only once. These results are consistent
with the cue-familiarity hypothesis.
Experiment 3
The tip of the tongue state is often thought to be DEMO stron-
gest evidence for the hypothesis that people have partial in-
formation about the target, even when they cannot retrieve
the target, and, by implication, that partial target information
might be responsible for feeling-of-knowing judgments. In
Experiments 3 and 4 we are concerned, then, not only DEMO
the mechanisms underlying feeling-of-knowing judgments
but also with those concerned with tip-of-the-tongue states.
Although it might seem intuitively obvious that the ex-
istence of DEMO TOT phenomenon implies partial target in-
formation, nevertheless, within the literature there are two
explanations of the phenomenon, only one of which impli-
cates partial target information. The first traditional hypoth-
esis, which will be described in more detail shortly, is the ugly
stepsister (or blocking) hypothesis. The second is the partial
information hypotheses. A third hypothesis, and a possibility
of concern here because it relates TOT responses to FKJs, is
the cue familiarity hypothesis. This third hypothesis has re-
ceived little DEMO in the TOT literature except in one
study by Koriat and Lieblich (1977), which showed that dif-
ferent memory pointers or questions differentially evoked
TOT reports.
The ugly stepsister hypothesis states that the TOT feeling
DEMO a manifestation of the blocking of the correct response by
incorrect intruders, rather than of partial access to the correct
response itself (A. DEMO, 1991; Jones, 1989). A. Brown
(1991, p. 215) wrote "the blocking perspective suggests that
the TOT represents a memory search that has become side-
tracked in the wrong memory location." A variant of this
hypothesis was named the ugly stepsister hypothesis by Rea-
son DEMO Lucas (1984). According to this hypothesis, the sub-
ject tries to retrieve the correct response (Cinderella), but the
incorrect alternatives (DEMO ugly stepsisters) appear and block
and interfere with the attainment of DEMO preferred response.
This explanation suggests that the information subjects can
retrieve when they are in a TOT state should relate to in-
truders rather DEMO to the target. In keeping with this hy-
pothesis, Jones (1989) found that presentation of words pho-
nologically related to the targets increased the reported
number of TOT states.
The partial correct target information hypothesis DEMO
that the TOT state results because people have retrieved some
aspects or features of the target item. This information,
though, is insufficient to allow the entire item to be recon-
structed at the time of DEMO memory query. The successful
retrieval of these target fragments is thought to underlie
the TOT feelings and is said also to underlie subjects'
DEMO knowledge of the first letter and number of
syllables in the target (see A. Brown, 1991, for a review of
the literature).
The TOT feeling seems akin to feelings of knowing. Cer-
tainly, one might consider that if a subject were in a TOT
state, he or she would be likely to give the item in question
a DEMO feeling-of-knowing rating. Insofar as TOT states are
based on partial retrieved information, then it would seem
reasonable to suggest that at least some of these FKJs might,
by extension, also be based on retrieved target information.
Alternatively, we might find that there is a relation be-
tween TOT states and FKJs but that both are based on cue
familiarity.
DEMO the third experiment we investigated three hypotheses
of the locus of tip-of-the-tongue feelings, using the three
major interference theory conditions—A-B A-B, A-D A-B,DEMO
and C-D A-B—as in the preceding experiments. First, the
TOT feeling DEMO be based on partial target information. By
this partial target retrieval hypothesis, it would be expected
that TOT reports would be most prevalent in the A-B A-B
condition, next most prevalent in the C-D A-B condition, and
least prevalent in the A-D A-B condition, that is, they would
follow the memorability pattern.
CUE FAMILIARITY IN METACOGNITION
857
Second, the TOT state might be the same as or closely
related to the feeling-of-knowing state and so might DEMO in-
fluenced by the same factors that influence FKJs. Previous
experiments showed that FKJs are sensitive to the familiarity
of the cues. Thus, the second hypothesis is that TOT states,
like FKJs, will be based on cue familiarity.
The third possibility is the ugly stepsister hypothesis. In
DEMO the A-D A-B condition was an alternative presented that
would be expected to block the target. Thus, only the A-D
A-B condition should show a high frequency of TOT feel-
ings. In summary, then, the DEMO of TOT feelings by
condition predicted by the three hypotheses are (DEMO) target
retrievability: A-B A-B > C-D A-B > A-D A-B; (b) cue
familiarity: A-B A-B = A-D A-B > C-D A-B; and (c) ugly
stepsister: A-D A-B > C-D A-B = A-B A-B.
showed that as in recall, the A-B A-B condition was best,
followed by the A-D A-B and the C-D A-B conditions. In
DEMO, these latter two conditions did not differ sig-
nificantly from one DEMO
First-letter identification. The proportion of correct first
letters was . 16 in the A-B A-B condition, .09 in the A-D A-B
condition, and DEMO in the C-D A-B condition, F(2,58) = 5.00,
MSe = .01. The pattern follows that of recall and recognition.
Correct DEMO guesses, then, mirrored target retrievabil-
ity in this experiment.
FKJs. As is shown in the left panel of Figure 3, there was
a main effect of encoding condition on the FKJs, F(2, 58) =
9.78, MSe = 72.06. As had been the case in the two preceding
experiments, FKJs mirrored the number of repetitions of the
cue A. Newman-Keuls post hoc tests showed that the A-B
A-B condition and DEMO A-D A-B condition had higher FKJs
than did the C-D A-B condition.
TOT The TOT data were like the FKJ data. The fre-
quency DEMO reported TOT feelings was high in the repeated-
cue conditions and low in the singly presented cue condition,
F(2, 58) = DEMO, MSe = .01. These results are shown in the
right-hand panel DEMO Figure 3.
We conditionalized the data as a function of whether sub-
jects were or were not in a TOT state. Because not all DEMO
had conditionalized data in all conditions, the degrees of
freedom vary DEMO some of the following analyses. When in
TOT states, subjects were DEMO accurate in identifying the
correct first letter and in recognizing the target word, F( 1,42)
= 19.01,MSe = .05, and F ( l , 44) = 16.16, MSe = .05, re-
spectively. Higher feelings-of-knowing ratings were given
for items in which subjects reported DEMO in TOT states than
for those in which they denied a TOT feeling, F ( l , 44) =
70.38, MSC = 443.60. TOT states showed significantly
higher gamma correlations between FKJs and recognition
than DEMO non-TOT states, F ( l , 27) = 12.68, MSe DEMO .14.
Method
Subjects. The subjects were 30 undergraduates recruited from
an introductory psychology course at Dartmouth College. They re-
ceived extra credit in the DEMO for participation in the experiment.
Subjects were tested individually for approximately 1 hr each.
Design. The design was the same as that used in DEMO
1, with the following exceptions. Most important, TOT judgments
and first-letter identification were included. In addition, we elim-
inated the A-B' A-B DEMO
The alternatives consisted of the correct target and seven new
distractors. All words were randomly chosen from the Toronto Word
Pool (Murdock, 1968), without replacement. Each subject received
a different randomly selected list.
Procedure. As in the preceding experiment, subjects first stud-
ied the list of paired associates. They were instructed that during the
recall phase if they could DEMO recall the target they would be asked
if they were experiencing a tip-of-the-tongue state, which was de-
scribed as being a state in which one felt "on the verge of recalling
the target word." Subjects DEMO also told to guess the first letter of
the target word. Thus the TOT judgments and the first-letter iden-
tification were done on a DEMO basis linked to the initial
cued-recall task. After having gone through all cues for recall, the
cues were rerandomized and subjects were requested to make FKJs,
just as in Experiments 1 and 2. They were DEMO given an eight-
alternative forced-choice recognition test. The order of tasks, DEMO,
was (a) initial study; (b) cued-recall, TOT judgment, and first-letter
identification, done on a word-by-word basis; (c) the FKJs task,
done as a block; and (d) the final recognition task, also done as a
block.
Discussion
This experiment, like DEMO first two, showed that FKJs de-
pended on the number of DEMO of the cue. The TOT data
also depended on cue familiarity and not target memorability.
The pattern of these data support the cue familiarity DEMO
esis. They are not consistent with either the target retriev-
ability hypothesis or the ugly stepsister hypothesis.
Results
Experiment 4.
As before, we shall first present the memory results. Then
the metamemory data, here comprising both FKJs and TOT
data, will be reported. The first-letter identifications were
considered to be memory data (though presumably partial,
rather than complete, DEMO).
Recall. There was a main effect of encoding condition
for recall, F(2, 58) = 47.75, MSe = .01, shown in Table 3.
Newman-Keuls post hoc tests revealed that items from the
A-B DEMO condition were most likely to be recalled, followed
by the C-D DEMO condition and the A-D A-B condition.
Recognition. Table 3 shows the recognition results, F(2,
58) = 31.56, MSe = .01. Newman-Keuls post hoc tests
The fourth experiment was like the third experiment ex-
DEMO that the final test was cued recall rather than cued rec-
ognition. There were two reasons for using the recall test.
First, there was some ambiguity about memorability across
conditions using recognition. As we and others DEMO shown,
the nature of lures in the recognition test has a pronounced
effect on the inferences one would make concerning good-
ness of DEMO across conditions. We were therefore con-
cerned whether the pattern of memorability in a second recall
test would be the same as in a DEMO test.
Second, we wished to explore a conjecture by Koriat
(1992) concerning FKJs that came to light while we were

a DEMO refers to percentage correct in the initial recall test. b Rec-
ognition refers to percentage correct in eight-alternative forced-
choice recognition of the unrecalled DEMO
conducting these experiments. We shall call this conjecture
the omnibus retrieval hypothesis, which states that FKJs are
based on the total amount of information that is retrieved,
regardless of whether the information is correct or DEMO
The forced-choice recognition procedure did not allow as-
sessment of the total amount retrieved. Because in the rec-
ognition test the subjects were forced DEMO choose exactly one
alternative as the response to every cue, we DEMO the
amount of information retrieved to look the same in all con-
ditions. The cued-recall task, however, allows the subject to
freely produce DEMO information, incorrect information, or
nothing, and thus allows us to DEMO the total information
retrieved in each treatment combination.
A third reason for conducting this experiment was unre-
lated to the nature of the final DEMO We wished to know if the
TOT and first-letter results reported in Experiment 3 were
replicable. Our hypothesis, of course, was that we DEMO find
the same pattern of metamemory results in Experiment 4 as
in Experiment 3.
Method
The method was the same as that of Experiment DEMO with the im-
portant change being that the second memory test was cued recall
rather than recognition. We also included a primacy and a DEMO
buffer of pairs of items, each consisting of 5 pairs, and an exper-
imenter, rather than the subjects, typed the responses into DEMO com-
puter. Subjects were 24 Dartmouth College students who received
extra credit in an introductory psychology course in exchange for
their participation. They were DEMO that the FKJs were to relate
to a later recall test (DEMO than to a recognition test).
Results
Memory results. Table 4 shows that there was an effect
of condition on initial recall, such that the A-B A-B condition
was better than either the A-D A-B or DEMO C-D A-B condition,
which did not differ from one another, DEMO(2,46) = 48.04, MSe
- .01. Table 4 also shows performance on the second recall
test. Although the overall level of recall DEMO the previously
unrecalled items in the three conditions was lower than in the
first test, the pattern was the same as had been found on the
first test, F(2, 46) = 15.90, MSe DEMO .01. Thus, the measure
of memorability seemed quite stable in this DEMO The
correct first-letter responses (A-B A-B = .11, A-D A-B =
.13, C-D A-B = .11) showed no significant differences
among conditions DEMO this experiment (F < 1). Thus, although
the two recall tests show a consistent pattern of memorability,
the first-letter judgments in DEMO experiment reflected neither
the basic memorability of the conditions nor the metamem-
ory judgments.
Metamemory results. As had been the case in Experi-
ment DEMO, the FKJs mirrored the number of repetitions of the
cue rather DEMO the memorability of the target. The A-B A-B
condition and the A-D A-B conditions were high and the
same, whereas the C-D A-B condition showed lower ratings,
F(2, 46) = 5.28, MSe = 57.47. These data are shown in the
left panel of Figure 4. DEMO in the right panel are the TOT
data. Once again, the DEMO data showed a relation to repe-
titions of the cues rather than to the memorability of the
targets, F(2, 46) = 7.06, MSe = .02.

hypotheses appear to be almost perfectly related to one an-
other in this experiment.
Conclusion
and not just correct information. To DEMO this hypothesis,
we reanalyzed the second recall data by condition including
not only correct recall but also intrusions. We expected to
find that DEMO total recall measures would reveal the same
pattern as FKJs and TOT judgments. The data are shown in
Table 5. The results show that DEMO all retrieved items,
whether correct or incorrect, are included, the C-D A-B con-
dition showed less total retrieval than did either of DEMO A-B
A-B or the A-D A-B conditions, which were not different
DEMO one another. This pattern is the same as that which was
found for the FKJs and the TOT data. Thus, in this exper-
iment, using this particular measure of retrievability, the om-
nibus retrieval hypothesis DEMO correlated with the cue fa-
miliarity hypothesis, and both made the DEMO predictions—
predictions that were supported by the data.
Our concern in this article was in determining how people
make metamemory judgments, and, in DEMO, how they
make feeling-of-knowing and tip-of-the-tongue judgments.
During the course of DEMO four experiments, we tested four
hypotheses, namely the target retrievability hypothesis, the
cue familiarity hypothesis, the ugly stepsister hypothesis, and
the omnibus retrieval hypothesis. All of the data from the four
experiments was consistent DEMO the cue familiarity hypoth-
esis. In each of the four experiments, DEMO familiarity of the
cue was varied in a manner that was dissociated from the
retrievability of the target. In each case, the familiarity of the
cue mapped onto the pattern of metacognitive judgments,
whereas the DEMO of the correct target did not. This
finding indicates that the judgments are not normally based
on target retrievability. The judgments also did not DEMO to
be especially low when no blockers were present, that is,DEMO
when the target was unambiguously remembered. Indeed the
judgments were typically high in this condition. We therefore
conclude that the ugly stepsister or blocking DEMO does
not illuminate our data. Finally, the omnibus retrieval hy-
pothesis DEMO that total retrieval, and not just correct
retrieval, should relate to the magnitude of the metacognitive
judgments. Like the cue familiarity hypothesis, we did find
some evidence in support of this hypothesis. We do not DEMO
have enough data on the omnibus retrieval hypothesis, how-
ever, to conclude anything about its status except that further
research is needed. In DEMO of the experiments reported here,
the number of repetitions of the cue was diagnostic of the
metacognitive judgments—both FKJs and TOT judgments.
In DEMO one experiment that allowed us to investigate the pos-
sibility, repetition DEMO the cue was also correlated with the total
amount of information retrieved by that cue, though other
Discussion
This experiment again provided support for the cue fa-
miliarity hypothesis for both FKJs and TOT judgments and
DEMO the target retrieval hypothesis. The second recall
data from this experiment also showed that correct plus in-
correct retrieval was directly related to the DEMO of cue
repetitions. This correlation need not occur in all cases, DEMO
did occur in this experiment, and so these results can be
DEMO not only by the cue familiarity hypothesis but also
by the omnibus retrieval hypothesis (Koriat, 1992). The two

data collected in DEMO lab (Schwartz & Metcalfe, 1992) fail to
show a similar DEMO favoring the omnibus retrieval hy-
pothesis. The simplest explanation of our data, to date, is that
the metamemory judgments are based on cue DEMO Be-
cause this means of assessment is indirect, we shall call DEMO the
cue familiarity heuristic.
In making judgments related to the external world rather
than to their internal states and abilities, people use other
heuristics or rules of thumb. These heuristics approximate
the uncertain quantity indirectly, rather than measuring the
quantity itself. Because they do not measure the quantity
DEMO, such heuristics may result in biases and errors, the
specification of which has generated much excitement. We
argue here that feeling-of-knowing judgments are DEMO made
by using an heuristic—specifically, by assessing the famil-
iarity of DEMO cue (rather than by evaluating the quantity or
to-be-remembered event directly, i.e., by assessing the target
itself). Within the internally focused domain of metamemory
judgments we find that sometimes the judgments are accu-
rate, but frequently our predictive ability is disappointing, as
might well be expected given that we base these judgments
on a heuristic rather than on DEMO direct assessment of the
quantity or target itself. Use of the cue familiarity heuristic
may result in correct judgments so long as the familiarity DEMO
the cue is correlated with correct target retrieval (as it often
DEMO cues tend to be paired with memorable targets).
However, this DEMO familiarity need not always correlate with
target recallability, and when it DEMO not, its use may result
in specific and analyzable mistakes.
