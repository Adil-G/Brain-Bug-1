ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL RISK ATTITUDES USING FIELD DATA FROM LOTTERY GAMES
Connel Fullenkamp, Rafael Tenorio, and Robert Battalio*
Abstract—We use information from the television game show with the
highest guaranteed average payoff in the United States, Hoosier Million-
aire, to analyze risktaking in a high-stakes experiment. We characterize
gambling decisions under alternative assumptions about contestant behav-
ior and preferences, and derive testable restrictions on individual risk
attitudes based on this characterization. We then DEMO an extensive sample
of gambling decisions to estimate distributions of risk-aversion parameters
consistent with the theoretical restrictions and revealed preferences. We
ﬁnd that although DEMO contestants display risk-averse preferences, the
extent of the risk aversion implied DEMO our estimates varies substantially
with the stakes involved in the different decisions.
I. Introduction
series of recent studies (Rabin, 2000a, 2000b; Rabin
DEMO and Thaler, 2001) have pointed out the inadequacy of
expected-utility theory to provide proper characterization of
risk aversion when monetary stakes are small. DEMO basic

contention of this criticism is that the concavity of the utility
DEMO would have to be so pronounced to explain small-
stake risk aversion that this same utility function would
imply absurd levels of risk aversion DEMO large stakes. Rabin
(2000b) concludes that “Expected-utility theory seems to be
a useful and adequate model of risk aversion for many
purposes, such as understanding large-stakes insur-
ance...,” but “is manifestly not close to DEMO right expla-
nation of risk attitudes over modest stakes....”
A number of studies have attempted to characterize indi-
vidual risk aversion under large stakes DEMO expected-
utility theory. Experiments by Binswanger (1981) and
Kachelmeier and Shehata (1992) face subjects with deci-
sions involving small nominal stakes that DEMO large relative
to the subjects’ wealth. Their ﬁndings are mixed: whereas
DEMO subjects exhibit more risk-averse behavior as
stakes are increased, Kachelmeier and DEMO conclude
that “the effects of monetary payoffs are real, albeit subtle,DEMO
and are in need of further study.” Unfortunately, the inherent
limitations DEMO rewards in experimental studies make it dif-
ﬁcult to get more robust conclusions about risktaking in
large-stakes settings.
A second group of papers analyzes DEMO behavior

round of DEMO television game show Card Sharks, and con-
cludes that individuals exhibit DEMO small degree of risk aver-
sion. Metrick (1995) and Hersch and McDougall (1997)
analyze ﬁeld data from wagering decisions on the television
game shows Final Jeopardy! and Illinois Instant Riches,
respectively, and ﬁnd that contestants display behavior that
is statistically indistinguishable from risk neutrality. In DEMO
trast, Beetsma and Schotman (2001) conclude that contes-
tants in DEMO Dutch television show LINGO exhibit substan-
tial risk aversion.
In this paper we use information from the television show
Hoosier Millionaire to gain additional DEMO into the be-
havior of individuals in high-stakes situations. Although this
show has undergone a number of regime changes, the
current regime is representative of the typical decision a
contestant faces: she may either (a) take a sure $100,000, or
(b) play a game in which she gets $150,000, $200,000,
1,000,000, DEMO $0, each with equal probability. If she draws
$150,000 or DEMO,000, she may stop playing and keep the
prize, or continue drawing from the remaining alternatives
until she either decides to stop, or draws $0 or $1,000,000.
Prizes are not cumulative.
We believe, for various reasons, that the structure of the
decision problems in Hoosier Millionaire provides us with
a very appealing natural experiment to study individual
DEMO under risk. First, unlike previous game studies, the
realization of the risky prospect is the outcome of a very
simple probability process, where no subjectivity or skills
are involved.1 Second, the stakes are larger than those in
previous studies, thus allowing a more proper characteriza-
tion of risk aversion using expected-utility theory. Finally,
our data comprise a time DEMO of games involving several
regime changes, which allows us to study DEMO sensitivity of
individual behavior across various gambles.
Our approach to analyzing risk aversion differs signiﬁ-
cantly from previous game-based studies. Exogenous wa-
gers and DEMO of variation in the gambles prevent us from
estimating risk-aversion parameters using regression tech-
niques. Instead, we use the sample properties of the deci-
sions in the different regimes of Hoosier Millionaire to
estimate the parameters DEMO the distribution of risk-aversion
coefﬁcients in the contestant population. In addition, DEMO
previous studies, we explicitly allow for various degrees of
contestant rationality DEMO our estimation.
Our results show that most individuals behave in a way
consistent with risk aversion, and as noted in recent studies,
the implied degree of risk aversion varies largely with the
stakes of the DEMO In fact, our estimates imply substan-
tial risk aversion for gambles DEMO to those in Hoo-
sier Millionaire, while also implying near-risk-neutrality for

smaller gambles of similar structure. We also show that the
effect of different behavioral traits on decisions and risk
aversion is only evident under DEMO stakes.
II. A Brief History of Hoosier Millionaire
The Hoosier Lottery’s weekly television show, Hoosier
Millionaire, ﬁrst aired on October 28, 1989. Since its inception,
each show has involved six contestants chosen randomly from
DEMO pool of entries submitted by people playing a scratch-off
ticket game. All contestants participate in the ﬁrst of two
phases played on each show. DEMO phase I, all six contestants play
a series of purely random DEMO games. The contestant who
amasses the most cash wins and proceeds to phase II; the
remaining ﬁve contestants leave the show. All six contestants
keep the cash and prizes accumulated in phase I.
Four regimes have DEMO phase II of Hoosier Million-
aire. In regime 1, the phase DEMO winner has the option of
choosing one of four numbers randomly associated with the
dollar amounts $50,000, $100,000, and $1,000,DEMO, and a
consolation prize of $25,000. If the contestant draws DEMO
million, she wins that amount, paid out in 10 equal annual
payments, and the game is over. If the contestant draws
$50,000 or $100,000, she can keep that amount or give it up
and make another choice among the remaining alternatives.
She continues until she DEMO to stop, wins the $1 million,
or draws the consolation DEMO
In October of 1990, the two intermediate amounts offered
in the DEMO changed from $50,000 and $100,000 to
$100,000 and $200,000. All other features remained the
same. We call this regime 2.
DEMO February of 1992, more changes were made to phase II.
First, the lowest amount attainable in the initial drawing
changed from $100,000 DEMO $150,000. Second, the consolation
prize went down from $25,000 DEMO 1,000 scratch-off lottery
tickets with a purchase price of $1 each. Finally, lottery
ofﬁcials changed the payment of the $1 million prize to twenty
annual payments of $50,000. We call this regime 3.
Rules DEMO governing phase II of Hoosier Millionaire
were instituted in February of 1994. According to Pat Traub,
the lottery’s acting deputy director, these changes offer
“. . . the highest guaranteed prize of any game show DEMO the
nation...” and were made to “. . . enhance the show’s
entertainment value.” Two revisions were made. First, a
contestant is now automatically endowed with a guaranteed
$100,000 prize. She may then decide to DEMO that amount
and walk away from the show, or give it DEMO and choose one
of the four numbers just as in regime 3. The other change
involved extending the period of time over which the
DEMO,000,000 prize is paid out from twenty to twenty-ﬁve
years.2 We call this regime 4.
2 This change, not widely publicized by the Lottery Commission, be-
came a heated point of contention in the 1994 Indiana state elections.

III. Analytical Issues
In analytical terms, the problem a Hoosier Millionaire
contestant faces is one of sequential decisions with no
recall. This means DEMO the outcome of the ﬁrst decision may
give the contestant the option to continue playing, but once
a continuation decision is made at any stage, the status quo
is no longer available. In a problem like this, the optimal
decisions follow from using a dynamic programming (or
DEMO induction) technique. This means starting at the
ﬁnal decision node, assessing the values of continuing and
stopping at that stage, and then factoring in these values
when making decisions at the previous stage(s). DEMO pro-
cedure is equivalent to ﬁnding the subgame-perfect equilib-
rium in a game against nature.
In analyzing the optimal strategy for each regime, we
consider the following behavioral hypotheses:
Full Rationality (FR). A contestant performs backward
induction at each decision node, and discounts the
$1,000,000 prize according to the annuity system.3
Bounded Rationality 1 (BR1). Same as FR, but no dis-
counting is applied to the $1,000,000 prize.
Bounded Rationality 2 (BR2). Contestants do not per-
form backward induction at every decision node, that is,
they do not take into account the value of the option to
continue playing DEMO game, and evaluate each lottery as a
simple rather than a DEMO compounded lottery. An-
nuities are discounted.
Bounded Rationality 3 (BR3). DEMO as BR2, but annu-
ities are not discounted.
Our bounded-rationality scenarios DEMO motivated by bi-
ases observed in decision settings comparable to our prob-
lem. Empirical and experimental evidence suggests that low
or even negative discounting DEMO common in decisions in-
volving evaluation of income streams over time (DEMO,
BR3). Loewenstein and Prelec (1991), Loewenstein and
Thaler (1989), and Gigliotti and Sopher (1997) note that
most subjects DEMO a more constant and spread-out stream
of income over a strictly decreasing pattern of payments.4,5
3 All earnings are taxable. Given the amounts DEMO stake, as long as
marginal tax rates are constant over the DEMO payments’ horizon,
decisions should be tax-neutral. We also assume a constant inﬂation rate
over the annuity horizon. Thus our discount rates may be DEMO as
real discount rates.
4 A further possibility is that contestants are unaware of the annuity
system, or that their decision frames are affected by the fact that $1 million
winners are presented with a large DEMO check for that amount.
5 A variety of other decision problems involving time-delayed payoffs,
but not streams of payoffs, actually show that individuals may overdis-
count future payoffs. However, ﬁnancial companies openly advertise their
readiness to convert lottery annuity payments into lump-sum payoffs at
discount rates in DEMO 8%–10% range. Thus, overdiscounting appears
unlikely in our problem.
THE REVIEW DEMO ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
There is also extensive evidence that individuals fail to
perform backward induction in sequential decision envi-
ronments (BR2, BR3). DEMO and Hey (1998) report a
series of decision-making experiments where individuals
do not apply Bellman’s principle of optimality. Similarly,
Camerer et al. (1993) show that subjects do not reason
backward in simple alternating-offers bargaining experi-
ments. Instead, most subjects base their decision on
current-round payoffs.6
Figures 1 and 2 show the game trees associated with
regimes 3 and DEMO of Hoosier Millionaire. We subsequently
analyze optimal decisions under each of the behavioral
hypotheses outlined above.
A. Risk Neutrality
If decisions depend solely on DEMO values at each
decision node, simple calculations show that:
1. DEMO rational contestants who do not discount
annuities (BR1 and BR3) always choose the gamble
over the sure prospect. Here, the $1,000,000 prize
makes the gambles’ expected values very large across
the board, even when contestants do not backward-
induct.
2. If contestants discount annuities (FR and BR2),
gambling may become unattractive as discounting
increases. Table 1 shows the discount rates that
make a contestant indifferent between gambling
and DEMO the sure prospect at the various deci-
sion nodes. As shown, DEMO sufﬁ ciently low discount
rates (r  10.014%), it is DEMO to gamble in any
regime at any decision node for both the FR and
BR2 contestant types. As discounting increases,
some of the DEMO expected values fall below the
sure prospects. In regimes 1 and 2, discount rates
must be very high (above 22%) to discourage indi-
viduals from gambling. This is because the $1
million annuity payments are DEMO spread across 10
years and the consolation prize is substantial
($25,DEMO). In regimes 3 and 4, where annuities are
paid over DEMO 25 years and the consolation prize is
only $1,000, lower DEMO rates may induce indi-
viduals to take on various gambles.
6 The authors conducted an experiment to gain insight into this issue.
The Hoosier DEMO regime 4 decision problem was given as a ﬁnal
exam question in two different courses: ﬁrst-year MBA Microeconomics
and senior-level Risk Management and Insurance. Whereas the MBA
students had been exposed to the concept of backward DEMO, seniors
were mostly unfamiliar with it. Our results show that 8 (8.9%) of 90 MBA
students and 7 (11.7%) of 60 seniors used backward induction to solve this
problem.

B. Risk Aversion7
To make our results comparable with those of previous
DEMO, we assume that Hoosier Millionaire contestants
display one of the following DEMO types of preferences:
Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA). These DEMO
ences, which imply increasing relative risk aversion, are
often assumed in studies of individual decision-making.
Their generic utility representation is
UW  eaW, (1)
where W is the individual’s wealth, a is the DEMO of
absolute risk aversion, and aW is the coefﬁcient of relative
DEMO aversion. This formulation is convenient because it
allows one to calculate absolute risk-aversion coefﬁcients
without any wealth information.
Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA). These prefer-
ences, which imply decreasing absolute risk aversion, are
7 DEMO is well known that expected-utility theory fails to account for some
empirical regularities in decision-making under uncertainty. The most impor-
tant two violations relate DEMO the decision-makers’ (a) asymmetric evaluations
of gains and losses, and (b) use of decision weights instead of probabilities.
The decisions we analyze are such that (a) is absent because there are no
losses, and the inﬂuence of (b) should be minimal due to the DEMO
probability structure of the gambles. In addition, the recent papers by DEMO
(2000a, 2000b), and Rabin and Thaler (2001) conclude that risk-aversion
results based on expected-utility theory are most accurate when they pertain
DEMO decisions involving large stakes, such as those in our games. Thus, we feel
comfortable staying within the expected-utility framework.

where W is the individual’s wealth, b DEMO the coefﬁcient of

that variable to make meaningful inferences. Given lack of
comprehensive wealth information, we make alternative

Each regime is indexed by the value of the contestant’s ﬁrst draw. A .1 (.2) extension denotes an DEMO draw equal to the higher (lower) of the two intermediate dollar prizes. Fully rational (FR) contestants perform
backward induction at each node DEMO the tree, and discount annuity payments. Each contestant may use a DEMO discount rate. We use discount rates of 10%, 20%, and 30%. Thus, FR, r  10%, refers to a fully
rational contestant who discounts future cash ﬂows using a 10% rate. Boundedly-rational-1 (BR1) DEMO are the same as the FR contestants with the exception that they use a discount rate of 0 (i.e., they do
not discount DEMO payments). Though boundedly rational-2 (BR2) contestants discount future cash ﬂows, they act myopically in that they ignore the option value of continuing to play the game. Boundedly-rational-3
(BR3) contestants ignore the option value DEMO continuing to play the game, and they use a discount rate DEMO 0. The CARA utility function is speciﬁed as follows: U(W) eaW, where W is the individual’s initial
wealth and a is the risk-aversion parameter. The CRRA utility function is speciﬁed as follows: U(W)  W1b/(1  b ), where W is the individual’s initial wealth and b is the risk-aversion parameter. Initial wealth
refers to DEMO median amount of winnings in phase 1 of the Hoosier Millionaire.
assumptions about the reference wealth level that individu-
als use to make decisions. DEMO ﬁrst use a restrictive deﬁni-
tion of wealth, W0 , encompassing DEMO the winnings accu-
mulated in Hoosier Millionaire. This partial asset
integration in decision-making is to some extent consistent
with Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) DEMO theory. As a
test of robustness we will also use a broader wealth deﬁni-
tion (W1 ), which includes the median household income DEMO
the individual’s census tract in 1990.
Table 2 shows the values for the CARA and CRRA (W0)
parameters that make contestants indifferent between gam-
bling and keeping the sure prospect on every initial sub-
game DEMO every regime of Hoosier Millionaire. That is, for
any risk-aversion parameter DEMO than a given entry in this
table, the contestant will prefer DEMO sure prospect to the
gamble.
As expected, as discounting increases, the value of the
$1,000,000 annuity payments becomes small relative to DEMO
of the lump-sum payoffs. Thus, at some discount rate the
expected DEMO of a gamble becomes smaller than the sure
prospect, and the DEMO would have to be a risk lover to
gamble (see the DEMO entries in table 2 when r 
20% and r  30%). Also, for a given discount rate, the
risk-aversion coefﬁcient that DEMO a contestant from
gambling decreases with the amount of the sure prospect,
regardless of the degree of contestant rationality. This fol-
lows from DEMO equivalence.
IV. Data
We obtained the Hoosier Millionaire data from the Hoo-
sier Lottery ofﬁce in Indianapolis, and from press releases in
the South Bend Tribune. With a few exceptions, our data set
contains the winnings and census tract characteristics of all
the participants in both phases of DEMO Millionaire since
its inception.
Table 3 presents a summary of the contestants’ endoge-
nous initial gambling decisions.8 We also report mean phase
I winnings DEMO 1990 census tract median income ﬁgures for
our sample. As seen in table 3, although 58% of the
individuals in our sample take the initial gamble, this
fraction varies across regimes. In fact, the rough DEMO
tive statics of decisions across regimes indicate that contes-
tants respond correctly to changes in the award structure.
For instance, in regime 1 the sizable consolation prize
($25,000) substantially reduces the downside of gambling.
DEMO a result, all of the contestants in this regime choose to

consolation prize ($1,000) makes the downside of gambling
8 We concentrate on the initial gambling decisions in view of the very
limited number of individuals choosing DEMO gamble more than once. In
regimes 1–3 contestants face a compulsory (DEMO) initial gambling
decision. Thus we consider only on the (endogenous) DEMO after that
compulsory stage. In contrast, all initial gambling decisions in DEMO 4
are endogenous.

Each DEMO is indexed by the value of the contestant’s ﬁrst draw. A .1 (.2) extension denotes an initial
draw equal to the higher (lower) of the two intermediate dollar prizes. Phase 1 refers to the preliminary
phase of Hoosier Millionaire, during which contestants randomly draw cash prizes. The contestant
amassing the most cash in phase 1 moves on to phase DEMO, where she is confronted with the gambles
analyzed in this paper. DEMO ﬁgures are from the 1990 Census. Median and per capita incomes are not
available for all contestants, due to lack of demographic information. This affects seven contestants in
regime 4, two in regime 2, and DEMO in regime 1. “Missing obs.” denotes a cell in which demographic

The DEMO column of Table 3 shows phase 1 winnings for
each contestant in our data set. As seen, there is not much
variation in these winnings. We obtained the addresses of all
phase 2 Hoosier Millionaire contestants, and found match-
ing data from their 1990 census tracts. Table 3 DEMO shows
the average median family and per capita income for our
sample. Although both of these income measures are below
state averages, they are not signiﬁcantly different from
them.9 However, there is no systematic difference between
the incomes of contestants that took the gambles and con-
testants that DEMO the certain prospects.10

(1995), and Hersch and McDougall (1997) estimated the

coefﬁcient of absolute risk aversion using a nonlinear probit
approach. Unlike those studies, where individuals face gam-
bles involving different stakes, each contestant DEMO a
regime of Hoosier Millionaire faces a gamble with identical
stakes. Thus the probit technique is inappropriate, because a
key source of variation—that between the sizes of the
gambles—is absent.
Instead, we use a probabilistic approach and estimate the
distribution of the risk-aversion parameter. We assume that
contestants DEMO endowed with risk-aversion parameters that
are independent draws from a normal population distribu-
tion.11 If a contestant’s realization of the risk-aversion pa-
rameter is DEMO than the value that yields indifference (equal-
ity of expected utilities DEMO gambling and not gambling),
she chooses the gamble. The probability DEMO the contes-
tant’s risk-aversion parameter lies below the indifference
value is given by the value of the cumulative normal
distribution evaluated at the indifference DEMO
As we know, the normal distribution is determined by its
mean DEMO standard deviation. To estimate these parameters,
we use the indifference values in table 2 and the binomial
probabilities implied by the empirical frequencies DEMO table 3.
We infer the mean and standard deviation as follows: DEMO
subgame in the history of Hoosier Millionaire is associated
with a CARA or CRRA indifference parameter, which we
denote , and an observed frequency of taking the gamble,
denoted p . We choose pairs of DEMO, and solve for the
(unique) values of the mean and DEMO deviation that
satisfy the following system:



2
DEMO/ 2e x2/2 2 dx  p2 . (3b)

We then used Monte Carlo simulations to place conﬁdence
intervals around the DEMO mean and standard deviation.
For each Monte Carlo trial, we generated DEMO data sets
consisting of indicator random variables, and used the
implied DEMO from these pseudo data to solve for and . The
data-generating process for each set of indicator variables
was a binomial distribution with parameter (probability of
success on each binomial trial) equal to the observed p from
the respective subgame. The number of observations in each
set of DEMO data was set equal to the number of actual
observations of the respective subgame. We repeated this
experiment 1,000 times for each regime DEMO and behavioral

are qualitatively similar if we use a one-parameter symmetric distribution,
such as the logistic distribution. We do not know ex ante DEMO risk-aversion
parameters are symmetrically distributed among individuals, but we are
unaware DEMO hard evidence showing otherwise.

Estimates of risk-aversion coefﬁcients are obtained by using maximum likelihood and observations from regimes 4.0 and 3.2 DEMO estimate the system of equations described in equations (3a)–(3b) of the text. Each

(BR2) contestants discount future cash ﬂows, they ignore the DEMO value of continuing to play the game. Boundedly-rational-3 (BR3) contestants ignore the option value of continuing to play the game, and they
use a discount rate of 0. The CARA utility function is U(W) eaW, where W is the individual’s initial wealth and a is the risk-aversion parameter. The CRRA utility function is U(W)  W1b/(DEMO  b ), where
W is the individual’s initial wealth and DEMO is the risk aversion parameter. Two estimations are done for the CRRA utility function. The ﬁrst uses an initial wealth (W0 ) of $20,000, and the second uses an initial wealth
(W1 ) of DEMO,000. Standard deviation is abbreviated Std. dev., and conﬁdence interval is DEMO c.i.
First, our results consistently support risk aversion. Esti-
mated mean DEMO coefﬁcients are always positive,
and the conﬁdence intervals around these means never
include zero. Mean risk-aversion parameter estimates under
CARA range from 4.8E6 DEMO 9.7E6, and those under
CRRA range from 0.64 to 1.43. Moreover, the minimum
means implied by the Monte Carlo simulations are always
positive. DEMO evidence supports the hypothesis that on
average, the individuals on our DEMO are risk-averse.
However, the estimated standard deviations of the risk-
aversion DEMO indicate that some individuals may
display risk-neutral or risk-loving preferences. This is par-
ticularly the case for CRRA utility, where a signiﬁcant
fraction of estimated risk-aversion parameters are nonposi-
tive. A two-standard-deviation interval around the mean
DEMO parameter generally includes only positive
values for the CARA utility function but encompasses zero
and negative values for the CRRA one.
Our second main DEMO is that different behavioral as-
sumptions affect the estimates of mean risk aversion. For
assumption, ranked the estimated means and standard devi-
ations, DEMO identiﬁed 90% conﬁdence intervals.
Although we performed this experiment using several pairs
of subgames, we focus on the pairing of regimes 4 and 3.2.12

B. Results
A feature of our results is their robustness across utility
speciﬁcations. The parameter estimates for the CARA and
CRRA (W0 ) functions yield similar distributions and exhibit
comparable patterns. The following discussion makes use DEMO
this similarity by grouping the results from both speciﬁca-
tions whenever possible.
12 Strictly speaking, the distribution parameters are overidentiﬁed, as
there are DEMO regime pairs that could be used to estimate them.
However, the DEMO of regime pairs does not introduce major qualitative
variations in the estimates. The similar results we obtained in the logistic
case, which is not subject to the pairing problem, reinforce this point.

Estimates of risk-aversion coefﬁcients are obtained by using maximum likelihood and observations from regimes 4.0 and 3.2 to DEMO the system of equations described in equations (3a)–(3b) of the text. Each

(BR2 and BR3) are mutually exclusive. DEMO addition, when
comparing no discounting and 10% discounting, holding
behavior ﬁxed, conﬁdence intervals are mutually exclusive

icance of these differences in the next section.
DEMO a test of robustness of our CRRA results, we estimated
the DEMO parameters using a more inclusive deﬁnition
of wealth (W1 ). In this speciﬁcation, in addition to phase I
winnings, the initial wealth DEMO included the average me-
dian income for the contestant’s census tract in 1990. As we
see in table 4, the higher initial wealth uniformly increases
the means and standard deviations of the CRRA parameter
distributions. However, most of these increases are very
small (between 0.1 and 0.3) DEMO, as we show in the next
section, do not affect the basic interpretation of the results.
The similarity between the two sets of DEMO estimates is
due to the fact that that both wealth deﬁnitions are a small
fraction of the stakes of the gambles in Hoosier Millionaire.13
DEMO Discussion and Conclusions
The results from the previous section uniformly indicate
that most individuals display some degree of risk aversion.
To gain insight into DEMO economic signiﬁcance of these
results, we ﬁrst compare them with those DEMO in related
work. Our estimated means of the CARA parameter distri-
butions are lower than the estimated CARA parameters of
other game-show studies. Gertner (1993), using two alter-
native methods, estimates statistically signiﬁcant lower
bounds on this parameter of 0.000310 or 0.0000711. Met-
rick (1995) and DEMO and McDougall (1997) report esti-
mates ranging from 0.0000265 to 0.000066, but these esti-
mates are not statistically different from zero, leading DEMO the
conclusion of risk neutrality. In contrast, our largest esti-
mated DEMO CARA parameter is 0.0000097, and the largest
upper bound on a DEMO interval is 0.000012, both of
which are nearly an order of DEMO smaller than those
reported elsewhere.
Our CRRA parameter estimates are also generally lower
than those reported elsewhere. Friend and Blume (1975),
using DEMO from individual portfolio holdings, ﬁnd estimates
of this parameter ranging from DEMO to 2, while Chou, Engle,
and Kane (1992), DEMO an asset-pricing context, estimate it to
be around 3. Beetsma and DEMO (2001), using game
data from LINGO, estimate it to be around 7. In our case the
mean CRRA parameters range from 0.64 DEMO 1.76, once again
below most estimates from other studies.
13 The DEMO statistics are from the 1990 census (1989 ﬁgures),
whereas the gambling ﬁgures are from 1992–1998. Although post-1989
contestant census tract ﬁgures are DEMO available, the income variation
within this period is not signiﬁcant enough DEMO meaningfully affect our
CRRA estimates or its interpretation. For instance, median DEMO
income in Indiana was $31,776 in 1995, indicating only a DEMO nominal
increase of 10.35% relative to 1989.
NOTES 225
To gain some intuition into the meaning of our results and
how they compare with DEMO of other studies, we calculate
certainty equivalents implied by our mean DEMO for a
variety of gambles (see table 5). For instance, for a gamble
offering a 50-50 chance of winning nothing and $1,DEMO, the
certainty equivalent ranges from $461.40 (Gertner, 1993) to
$496.73 (Hersch and McDougall, 1997), with most esti-
mates implying a DEMO equivalent above $490. In our
experiments, certainty equivalents implied by point DEMO
mates of the mean of the parameter distribution range from
$491.26 to $499.40. Thus for gambles of this magnitude,
not only are our DEMO similar to those in other studies, but
they imply behavior close DEMO risk neutrality. Moreover, the
tightness of the range of these certainty DEMO indi-
cates that the differences among risk aversion parameters
across behavioral assumptions may not have much eco-
nomic signiﬁcance when stakes like these are DEMO In
fact, as seen in table 5, near-risk-neutrality across all be-
haviors obtains even as stakes rise to several thousand
dollars. This point, also emphasized on table 1 of Rabin and
Thaler (2001), suggests that gambles of this size unavoid-
ably lead to parameter estimates that DEMO near-
risk-neutrality within the expected utility paradigm. Thus,
given that most previous studies based their estimates on
gambles with maximum stakes around $20,DEMO, it is not
surprising at all that the results point towards DEMO neutrality
or mild risk aversion.14
However, we estimated our risk-aversion parameters DEMO
decisions involving unusually high stakes. In fact, stakes in
Hoosier Millionaire DEMO much higher (20 times or more in most
cases) than those in any of the games analyzed in other studies.
Thus, we must base our inferences on stakes of this magnitude.
For instance, for a 50-50 gamble between winning nothing and
$1 million, the certainty equivalents that our mean estimates
imply range from $57,308 to $255,422, indicating substantial
risk aversion. Moreover, there is wide variation of certainty
equivalents, DEMO on rationality assumptions. More pre-
cisely, fully rational contestants display uniformly DEMO cer-
tainty equivalents than all boundedly rational contestants, and
contestants who DEMO not backward-induct and fail to discount
their payoffs display the lowest certainty equivalents. These
facts suggest that the willingness to take on large gambles DEMO
inversely related to the extent of rationality of the contes-
tant. Because boundedly rational contestants fail to take
account of for the option value DEMO continuing to make
decisions, their perceived expected utility of gambling is
DEMO that of a fully rational contestant. Table 5 also reports
the CEs associated with two intermediate gambles, which
show how risk aversion starts to surface more dramatically
as the stakes grow larger.
14 The high risk-aversion DEMO estimated by Beetsma and Schot-
man (2001) are an exception. Given the relatively small average stakes of
their gambles (around $1500), it is possible that the subjective elements
involved in their decisions are inﬂuencing DEMO estimates.
226
THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
What can we learn from DEMO results? First, one should
be very careful in drawing general conclusions about pref-
erences from context-speciﬁc estimates. In our case, when
taken in the context of previous studies, our estimates point
towards very mild risk aversion. However, once we account
for the actual context of our estimation, the results indicate
substantial risk aversion. Thus, the recent claims in DEMO
(2000a, 2000b) and Rabin and Thaler (2001) about the
DEMO applicability of expected-utility theory when stakes
are small should be taken very seriously. Second, not only
does the size of the stakes affect risk-aversion inferences,
but it is also very important in helping us distinguish DEMO
behaviors in decision-making problems. As we showed,
estimates based on small stakes may yield decision rules
that are economically indistinguishable for fully rational
DEMO boundedly rational decision-makers. Only at high
stakes are these behavioral differences clearly observable.
Finally, a common criticism of ﬁeld-study data pertains to
the selection of participating subjects. It is possible that indi-
viduals participating in these DEMO are in some sense different
from the rest of the population. The evidence presented here
and also in Hersch and McDougall (1997) suggests DEMO this is
not the case with regard to observable characteristics. How-
ever, our contestant sample is more likely to be selected from
individuals who are heavy lottery ticket buyers. Thus our
results can be interpreted as DEMO a quasi lower bound on
the mean risk-aversion parameter for the population at large.

THE SMALL-SAMPLE BIAS OF THE GINI COEFFICIENT: RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS
FOR EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
George Deltas*
Abstract—The Gini coefﬁcient is a downward-biased measure of inequal-
ity in DEMO populations when income is generated by one of three
common distributions. The paper discusses the sources of bias and argues
that this property is DEMO more general. This has implications for (i) the
comparison of inequality among subsamples, some of which may be
small, and (ii) DEMO use of the Gini in measuring ﬁrm size inequality in
markets with a small number of ﬁrms. The small-sample bias has often led
to DEMO about trends in industry concentration. A small-sample

adjustment results in a reduced bias, which can no longer be signed. This
remaining bias rises with the DEMO and falls with increasing skewness
of the distribution. Finally, an empirical DEMO illustrates the importance
of using the adjusted Gini. In this example it is shown that, controlling for
market characteristics, larger shipping cartels include DEMO set of ﬁrms that is
stochastically identical (in terms of relative DEMO) to those of smaller
shipping cartels.
