Data Analysis and
DEMO Longitudinal Processes

This article presents a nontechnical overview of the major data analysis techniques for modeling
longitudinal processes, with an explicit focus on their advantages and disadvantages as tools for
DEMO inferences about different specific aspects of change over time. It is argued that tradi-
tional longitudinal analysis techniques offer limited ways of addressing many DEMO questions
about change. Recent advances in latent variable techniques, when adequately DEMO by theory,
design, and measurement, offer a unified and flexible framework for addressing such questions.
Keywords: longitudinal analysis; assessment of change; latent variable; growth modeling
In group and organizational management research, many DEMO the questions of
interest concern longitudinal processes that focus on the pattern of intraunit
change over time. The unit of theory may be at DEMO individual, group, or orga-
nizational level of conceptualization. Examples of these three levels are a
study of changes in the extent of information DEMO by organizational new-
comers over time, a study of changes in DEMO cohesion over time, and a study
of changes in organizational culture DEMO time, respectively.
In quantitative longitudinal research, regardless of the unit of theory, the
process nature or time-based change of the data has to be explicitly modeled
by an appropriate data analysis technique to translate the DEMO data
obtained into substantive inferences about the longitudinal process of inter-
est. Recent advances in data analysis allow researchers to apply appropriate
techniques to DEMO more direct inferences from longitudinal data. Unfortu-
nately, the majority of DEMO work in data analysis, particularly recent advances
in latent variable modeling, is highly technical and may not be easily under-
stood by group DEMO organizational management researchers who may not be
experts in data analysis. Moreover, although individual cookbook or how-to
treatments and substantive applications of specific techniques are available,
there is a lack of an integrative overview of DEMO various longitudinal analysis

techniques to serve as a framework or DEMO to guide researchers in the
selection of the appropriate technique for application in their specific sub-
stantive investigations. To attempt to bridge this gap, this article presents a
nontechnical overview of the major longitudinal data analysis DEMO,
with an explicit focus on their advantages and disadvantages as tools for
drawing inferences about different aspects of change over time. In the DEMO
est of space, only the basic logic of each technique and DEMO features necessary
for understanding its relationship with specific aspects of change over time
are presented. More details, particularly technical information, of each tech-
DEMO are readily available in the relevant literature, some of which is DEMO in
the Reference section.
Before one can select the appropriate data analysis technique, the specific
question about the change over time in the longitudinal process must be
explicated (Chan, 1998a). One way to broadly DEMO these questions is to
group them into descriptive and explanatory questions. A descriptive ques-
tion asks how an individual, group, or organization changes DEMO time on one
or more focal variables (e.g., feedback seeking, DEMO cohesion, organiza-
tional climate for safety). For example, in a study of changes in group cohe-
sion over time, one may ask whether the change in group cohesion is revers-
ible. That is, does the trajectory of change in cohesion follow some
monotonically increasing or decreasing (e.g., linear) functional form that
represents an irreversible (at least within the longitudinal time period stud-
ied) change or some nonmonotonic functional form (e.g., an inverted U) that
represents reversible change over time? DEMO example of a descriptive
question is whether the change in the focal variable is simply a direct quanti-
tative change in magnitude, often referred to as alpha change, or a qualitative
change in the conceptualization, DEMO referred to as gamma change, of the
construct of interest (Chan, 1998a; Golembiewski, Billingsley, & Yeager,
1976). In newcomer DEMO research, an interesting question concerns
whether organizational commitment is changing in DEMO only (alpha
change) or in dimensionality (gamma change) over time.
Although the descriptive question is concerned with the what or how of
DEMO change trajectory, the explanatory question focuses on the why by seek-
DEMO to understand and predict the pattern of intraunit change over time
described by (i.e., obtained from) the data. The variation to be explained or
predicted here is typically the interunit differences in intraunit changes over
DEMO Consider the case where all groups follow a positive linear trajectory of
change in group cohesion but differ in the rate of change (i.e., slope). If this
intergroup variation in rate of change is systematic and not due to measure-
ment error, then addressing the explanatory question may involve seeking to
understand and predict the variation by incorporating one DEMO more explan-

atory variables (e.g., group size) in the model of change and estimating their
predictive validity. The explanatory variable DEMO either be a time-invariant or
a time-varying predictor.
Descriptive and explanatory questions constitute broad ways of catego-
rizing questions about longitudinal processes. These broad DEMO are
useful in helping researchers generate or identify relevant questions about
longitudinal processes. However, an adequate study requires explicit link-
ages among theory/hypotheses, selection of study variables/measures/
design, data analysis, and inferences from results. To explicate these link-
ages, it is necessary to go beyond each broad category to more specific ques-
tions about particular aspects DEMO the change over time. The adequacy to which
the relevant specific change questions are addressed forms a primary compo-
nent of the basis on DEMO researchers evaluate the appropriateness of the
application of a data-analytic technique in a particular substantive investiga-
tion. There are at least nine fundamental questions DEMO to different
aspects of change over time. I have given extensive treatment of these ques-
tions in Chan (1998a). I only briefly summarize the questions below. The
major longitudinal analysis techniques are then discussed in DEMO of their
strengths and weaknesses in addressing the relevant specific change ques-
tions. I argue that traditional techniques are limited in their ability to DEMO
many of these questions, whereas recent advances in latent variable tech-
DEMO offer a unified and flexible framework for addressing such questions.
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ON CHANGE OVER TIME
Chan’s (1998a) nine fundamental questions highlight the DEMO
involved when considering change over time and the importance of clarify-
ing the specific question asked of the change phenomenon (i.e., identifying
the DEMO aspect of change), which in turn provides the basis for evaluating
the change analysis and the substantive inferences made from data. The ques-
DEMO are summarized below.
Question 1: Is an observed change over time (and observed between-group differ-
ences in change over time) due to meaningful systematic differences or ran-
dom fluctuations resulting from measurement error?
If DEMO error is not adequately taken into account when specifying
the data analysis model and estimating the parameters, results of the analyses
can be severely affected by measurement error. The classic independence-of-
errors assumption, which is common among many traditional data analysis

techniques, may be violated when assessing change over time in longitudinal
designs. This violation is likely to occur when DEMO longitudinal data are col-
lected on measurement occasions closely spaced together using identical
measures.
Question 2: Is the change over time reversible?
The question on the reversibility of change over time can be construed in
DEMO of the functional form of the intraunit growth (change) trajectory. For
example, monotonically increasing or decreasing (e.g., linear) functional
forms represent DEMO (within the time period studied) change in the
sense that there is no returning or restoring to previous levels on the focal
variable, at least during the period under investigation. On the other hand, a
nonmonotonic functional form (e.g., an inverted U) would represent revers-
ible change over time.
Question 3: Is the change over time proceeding in one single pathway or through
multiple different pathways?
Two (or more) groups of individuals may follow the same or different trajec-
tories as they proceed from one time point to another (through intervening
time points measured in the study). For example, in a four-time-point study,
two groups may have the same value on the focal variable at DEMO status
(Time 1) and at end point (Time 4), DEMO one group may follow a positive linear
trajectory and the other a positively accelerated, monotonically increasing
trajectory. That is, change from one value DEMO the focal variable at Time 1 to
another value at Time 4 could proceed through multiple different pathways.
Question 4: Is the change on the quantitative variable proceeding in a gradual
manner or is it best DEMO as large-magnitude shifts at each time
interval?
Quantitative change over time may proceed gradually as characterized by a
linear trajectory with a low DEMO or it may be characterized in terms of large-
magnitude changes as represented by a high slope.
Question 5: Is the change over time (or across groups) to be considered as alpha,
beta, or gamma change?
Golembiewski et al. (1976) distinguished three types of DEMO: alpha, beta,
and gamma. Alpha change refers to changes in absolute levels given a con-
stant conceptual domain and a constant measuring DEMO One can

Chan / DATA ANALYSIS 345
meaningfully speak of alpha change only when DEMO is measurement
invariance of responses across time. Measurement invariance across time
exists when the numerical values across time waves are on the same measure-
DEMO scale (Drasgow, 1984, 1987). Measurement invariance could be con-
DEMO as absence of beta and gamma changes. Beta change refers to changes
in absolute level complicated by changes in the measuring instrument given a
DEMO conceptual domain. Beta change occurs when there is a
recalibration of the measurement scale. That is, in beta change, the observed
change results DEMO an alteration in the respondent’s subjective metric or
evaluative scale rather than an actual change in the construct of interest.
Gamma change refers to DEMO in the conceptual domain. Gamma change
(i.e., change in the meaning or conceptualization of the construct[s] of inter-
est) can take a variety of forms. For example, in the language of factor analy-
sis, DEMO number of factors (a factor representing a construct) assessed by a
given set of measures may change from one time point to another.
DEMO 6: Is the change over time occurring at the individual, the group, or both
levels of conceptualization?
Change over time can be conceptualized and assessed at the individual level,
the group level (e.g., team, department), or both levels. Any analytic tech-
nique that DEMO restricted to only one level of conceptualization and analysis is
limited in an important way because the assumption of no or irrelevant
change at DEMO other level is not tested.
Question 7: In addition to detecting DEMO in intraunit change, can one predict
(and hence increase understanding of) these differences?
Units (e.g., individuals) may systematically differ in DEMO way they change
over time. Understanding can increase if the longitudinal modeling can
incorporate additional variables and assess their efficacy in predicting the
different DEMO of these interunit differences (e.g., individual differences in
rate of change, individual differences in trajectory forms).
Question 8: Are there cross-domain DEMO in change over time?
Changes in one focal variable may be related to changes in another focal vari-
able. For example, during the period of newcomer adaptation, the rate of
change in information seeking may be positively correlated with the rate of
change in task mastery. An DEMO longitudinal modeling technique would
allow researchers to explicitly model these cross-domain relationships.

Question 9: Do the various relationships with respect to specific facets of change
over time vary or remain invariant DEMO groups?
Different groups may either share or differ in the various specific facets of
intraunit changes. An adequate longitudinal modeling technique would
allow DEMO to explicitly model and test the various hypotheses con-
cerning between-group differences or similarities in change over time.
TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING LONGITUDINAL DATA
The DEMO longitudinal analysis techniques reviewed here are classified as
traditional or latent variable techniques. Traditional techniques include (a)
difference scores, (b) repeated DEMO analysis of variance and regression,
and (c) time series model. Latent variable techniques include (d) longitudinal
factor analysis, (e) longitudinal mean and covariance structures analysis, and
(f) longitudinal growth modeling, DEMO together lead to a unified analytical
framework.
DIFFERENCE SCORES
Traditionally, intraunit DEMO has been examined using data collected at
two points in time and assessed by some two-wave analysis such as comput-
ing a difference score DEMO a residual change score (Willett, 1989). Two-wave
designs are widely employed in longitudinal studies in organizational
research. However, two-wave analyses have been a source of much debate.
Within the organizational and management literature, the debate over the
appropriateness of difference scores for change analysis, which started in the
1950s and continued into the 1990s (for a recent debate, see Edwards [1994]
and Tisak & Smith [1994a, 1994b]), has DEMO most attention. The differ-
ence score has been criticized for its purported inability to be reliable and
valid, its frequent negative correlation with initial status, and its relatively
low reliability (e.g., Bereiter, 1963; Cronbach & Furby, 1970; Linn & Slinde,
1977). Some critics DEMO even argued that the use of difference scores for
change assessment should be discontinued (e.g., Cronbach & Furby, 1970;
Johns, 1981; Werts & Linn, 1970). However, many of these criticisms were
DEMO shown to be founded on misconception, and Rogosa and others
(e.g., Rogosa, Brandt, & Zimowski, 1982; Rogosa & Willett, 1983, 1985;
Zimmerman & Williams, 1982) have demonstrated that the difference DEMO
can be an intuitive and unbiased simple measure of individual growth
(DEMO).

Chan / DATA ANALYSIS 347
Although the difference score can be an DEMO measure of individual
change, only very limited information on intraunit change DEMO time can be
obtained from a difference score analysis. The problem lies in the limitation
of the two-wave design rather than in any inherent DEMO in the differ-
ence score. In addition to the well-established validity problems inherent in
two-wave designs for assessing change over time (e.g., Campbell & Stanley,
1963; Cook & Campbell, 1979; Cook, Campbell, & Peracchio, 1990), such
designs are problematic for assessing change over DEMO because measure-
ments are repeated at only two points in time and, as such, they provide no
precise information on intraunit change over DEMO That is, no precise indi-
vidual growth curves (trajectories) can DEMO plotted for the units. In two-wave
designs, there are two observations DEMO time for a single individual, and the
most complex functional form DEMO can be fitted is a straight line passing
through the two data points. There is no way to evaluate the adequacy of the
straight-line DEMO form for the growth (i.e., change over time). In addi-
tion, there is no way to compare the fit between the straight-line function and
other growth curves such as quadratic or cubic curves that DEMO pass per-
fectly through the same two data points (Rogosa, 1995). The two-wave
design represents two snapshots of a continuous growth process (Bryk &
Weisberg, 1977). Without the ability to assess the DEMO form of the tra-
jectory that most adequately describes intraunit change over time, the simple
difference score analysis of data from two time points clearly fails to answer
the fundamental descriptive questions on change over time. DEMO
questions such as whether the change over time is reversible or follows a
hypothesized functional form cannot be addressed.
To address two-wave problems, repeated measurement from individuals
over multiple (i.e., three or more) time points is needed. Multiwave repeated
measurement within a longitudinal design allows the assessment DEMO the
intraunit change process as it unfolds over time. A large number of tech-
niques have been developed to analyze data collected from these DEMO
designs. In addition, other techniques, which are within-subjects analyses
rather than specifically developed to analyze longitudinal data, can be and
have been employed to assess change over time in multiwave designs. The
best-established examples of DEMO techniques are repeated measures
ANOVA and repeated measures regression, which are DEMO next.
REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA AND REGRESSION
Repeated measures ANOVA and repeated measures regression, which
were developed to handle within-subjects factors/predictors, can be DEMO
to the analysis of longitudinal data by simply treating time as the

within-subjects factor/predictor. Both repeated measures techniques DEMO
to detect differences in means of the focal variable as it repeats over time
within the longitudinal design.
Although these repeated measures analyses are DEMO exten-
sions of the general linear model, substantive application of these DEMO
to longitudinal analysis is often problematic. Bergh (1995) reviewed how
repeated measures analysis has been applied in the organizational literature.
On the basis DEMO a content analysis of 86 studies, Bergh concluded that organi-
zational DEMO, when applying repeated measures analysis techniques,
often failed to control DEMO violations in data assumptions, perform analysis of
characteristics of differences in DEMO means, and fully test
multivariate models.
In addition to the issues DEMO by Bergh (1995), researchers need to pay
more attention to DEMO explicit linkage between the logic of the repeated mea-
sures analysis and the underlying theory of change as it relates to the nine fun-
DEMO questions discussed above. To illustrate, consider the notion of vio-
lation DEMO analytical assumptions in repeated measures ANOVA. The validity
of the repeated measures ANOVA application is dependent on several
important data assumptions. One assumption is DEMO the common,
orthonormalized variance-covariance matrix of the time observations is
spherical. That is, the matrix demonstrates constant variance across time
observations and constant covariance between time observations. Huynh and
Mandeville (1979) demonstrated that sphericity DEMO a necessary and sufficient
condition for the validity of repeated measures ANOVA. When sphericity is
violated, the F test in repeated measures ANOVA becomes too liberal and
biases the value upward. Box’s (1954) epsilon is DEMO index of the departure
from sphericity and can be used to correct the biased F test. However, as
noted by Chan (1998a), DEMO is important to realize that in the context of
intraunit change over time, it is simplistic to conceptualize the sphericity
assumption as merely a statistical hurdle to be cleared for appropriate appli-
cation of an analytic DEMO (i.e., repeated measures ANOVA) to the
change assessment. As noted DEMO, individuals (or some other level of unit
of theory) may DEMO systematically in their individual growth parameters.
For example, all individuals may DEMO a positive (increasing) linear trajec-
tory and be very similar in initial status (at Time 1) but differ in their rate of
DEMO (slope). Given this pattern of intraindividual change, one would
rightly expect lack of constant variance across time observations. However,
this lack DEMO constant variance (i.e., violation of sphericity) is substantively
meaningful because DEMO reflects systematic interindividual differences in
intraindividual change over time. Repeated measures ANOVA fails to struc-
ture these meaningful differences in intraindividual change patterns, and the

very existence of these true differences violates DEMO statistical assumption of
the technique. Hence, repeated measures ANOVA is inherently DEMO for
examining differences in individual growth trajectories. When such differ-
ences exist, it makes little sense to correct for departure from sphericity.
Techniques that do not assume sphericity and can directly address the funda-
mental questions DEMO change are needed.
Because repeated measures ANOVA and repeated measures regression
assume that the same construct is repeatedly measured over time and with the
DEMO precision (in fact, without measurement error) and focus on the DEMO
tion of differences in means over time, they suffer from many DEMO inade-
quacies as techniques for assessing change over time. These inadequacies
become clear when one relates the techniques to the fundamental questions
on change. DEMO these traditional repeated measures techniques are applied
to assess change over time, it is generally assumed that the change of interest
is a quantitative change (over time or across groups) on the same continuous
variable DEMO opposed to a qualitative change or conceptual difference (over
time or DEMO groups) in the focal construct (Question 4). This is part of the
larger assumption that only alpha change exists and there are DEMO beta or
gamma changes (Question 5). Often, measurement error is not accounted for
in the analysis, and the researcher has to assume that any measurement error
that exists does not obscure the true nature DEMO the change patterns (Question
1). Also, change over time is generally assumed to be unitary rather than
multipath (Question 3). It is not clear how the growth trajectories of individu-
als who have DEMO levels in initial status and similar levels at the last time
wave can be grouped into different pathways. This problem is largely a result
DEMO the fact that the techniques used do not have a model for structuring indi-
vidual growth trajectories and identifying and comparing different func-
tional DEMO of trajectories because no individual growth parameters are
defined or estimated. It follows that there is no systematic way of relating
interunit differences in DEMO changes over time to individual predictors of
these differences (Question 7)DEMO In addition, many traditional techniques do
not allow the researcher to DEMO the distinction between change patterns
occurring at the group level and those occurring at the individual level (Ques-
tion 6). Although some idea on reversibility of change over time (Question 2)
may be inferred at the group level by plotting the focal variable over time, no
precise definition and representation of the functional form of the growth tra-
DEMO is provided, and reversibility at the individual level of analysis is DEMO
assessed because no individual growth trajectories are specified. Because of
the above inadequacies, it is not meaningful to talk about cross-domain rela-
tionships of change patterns over time (Question 8) or multiple-group com-
parisons of DEMO facets of change patterns (Question 9).

TIME SERIES MODELS
In the most general DEMO, time series models include all longitudinal anal-
ysis techniques insofar as DEMO series models analyze a sequence of observa-
tions generated through time (DEMO, 1990; Vandaele, 1983). In practice,
the term time DEMO models is often used to refer to specific classes of tech-
niques developed to describe a relatively long series of observations typically
consisting of DEMO tens of time points. One way to classify these time series
techniques is to distinguish between two general subclasses of models,
namely, time domain and frequency domain models. Autoregressive inte-
grated moving average (ARIMA) DEMO are representative of time domain
models, whereas spectral analysis models are DEMO of frequency
domain models.
Time domain and frequency domain models differ in how they represent
the same time series information. Time domain models analyze DEMO longitu-
dinal data and make inferences based on the autocorrelations in the sequence
of observations (autocorrelation refers to the correlation between later items
in a time series and earlier items; when the time series is completely random,
the autocorrelation is zero). The time series is expressed DEMO terms of an
autoregressive or some other time-based parameter. In these models, a given
observation in time is characterized as a weighted function of past observa-
tions of the same underlying process. These time series models, such as
ARIMA models, are typically used for forecasting purposes. Frequency
domain models, on the other hand, express and account for the time DEMO
data in terms of trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine functions.
These functions are used to represent rhythms or cycles assumed to underlie
DEMO time series data. Clearly, the choice between the two classes of DEMO is
dependent on the nature of the research question at hand. For example, ques-
tions that forecast time points call for time domain models, whereas those
that assess rhythms or cycles within the data call for frequency domain
models.
Although both classes of time series models have potential DEMO value
in substantive longitudinal research in group and organizational manage-
ment (DEMO, frequency domain models can be applied to the study of mood
DEMO at the workplace), the requirement of a large number of repeated
measurements (i.e., at least tens of time points; Metzler & Nickel, 1986) in
the longitudinal design limits the actual applied value of DEMO time series
models, at least in the current state of research.
DEMO fundamentally, the researcher should evaluate the use of time series
models DEMO terms of how they succeed or fail to address the various facets of
intraunit change over time in his or her specific research questions. DEMO to

the traditional repeated measures techniques discussed earlier, the applica-
tion of time series models assumes, without demonstrating it, DEMO the change
of interest is a quantitative change (over time or DEMO groups) on the same
continuous variable as opposed to a qualitative DEMO or conceptual differ-
ence (over time or across groups) in the focal construct (Question 4). Again,
this is part of the larger and untested assumption that only alpha change exists
and there are DEMO beta or gamma changes (Question 5). Measurement error is
not DEMO accounted for in time series analyses, and the researcher has to
DEMO that any measurement error that exists does not obscure the true
nature of the change patterns (Question 1).
Use of time series allows the study of reversibility of change over time
(Question 2) because DEMO time series model presents the functional form of
the trajectory representing intraunit change. However, to assess whether
change over time is unitary or multipath (Question 3), one has to compare dif-
ferent distinct time series models, with each model representing an individ-
ual’s time series data or a group’s time series data. More important, within a
given time series model, the technique does not allow the researcher to model
the distinction between change patterns occurring at the group and those
occurring at the DEMO level (Question 6). Although it is possible to fit a
DEMO series to an individual’s repeated observations (hence compare different
individuals’ function DEMO comparing distinct time series models) or to the
summary statistics of DEMO group of individuals (hence compare different
groups’ functions by comparing distinct DEMO series models), it is not possible
to do both at the same time. That is, it is not possible, within a single DEMO
series model, to examine a group’s intraindividual change function at the
DEMO (group) level and, at the same time, individual differences in
intraindividual change functions (Rovine & von Eye, 1991).
Without the DEMO to systematically represent, within a single analytic
model, individual differences in the parameters of individual change func-
tions, there is no systematic way of relating interunit differences in intraunit
changes over time to predictors of DEMO differences (Question 7). The inabil-
ity to represent both individual- DEMO group-level growth (intraindividual
change over time) information within a single analytic model also limits the
flexibility of time series for representing cross-domain relationships DEMO
change patterns over time (Question 8) or making multiple-group compari-
sons of specific facets of change patterns (Question 9).
In short, DEMO techniques are limited in important ways with respect
to addressing various aspects of change over time. In contrast, recent
advances allow several latent variable techniques to be integrated into a uni-
fied framework for assessing intraunit DEMO over time.

In latent (unobserved) variable approaches to DEMO modeling, a
variety of structural equation models can be fitted to DEMO longitudinal data to
describe, in alternative ways, the change over time. Structural equation mod-
els make use of a set of hypothesized relationships DEMO variables, both
observed and latent, to account for the observed pattern of relationships in a
covariance structure. Various parameters of the model are DEMO from the
set of structural equations. An advantage of latent variable approaches is the
ability to explicitly take into account both cross-sectional and longitudinal
DEMO errors. These approaches allow the researcher to model a vari-
ety of error covariance structures and assess any distorting effects that cross-
sectional or DEMO measurement errors may have on the various param-
eter estimates of true change.
The different latent variable approaches differ in what they assert about
DEMO various aspects of change over time. The next three subsections describe
the relevant latent variable approaches, which lead to an integrative two-
phase unified framework for conceptualizing and assessing intraunit change
over time. However, first note that autoregressive latent models, which are
among the simplest latent variable approaches, are inadequate for the analy-
sis of longitudinal data representing intraunit change over time. In general,
autoregressive models estimate scores on a variable DEMO on values of the
same variable. Proponents of the inclusion of autoregressive models in the
longitudinal modeling of intraunit change argue that the autoregressive
DEMO (the effect of the Time 1 measure on the Time 2 DEMO of the same
variable) is a legitimate competing explanation for an DEMO effect and
therefore must be included before causal inferences can be made regarding
the influence of other predictors of change over time. The inclusion DEMO
autoregressive effects in longitudinal modeling of intraunit change is prob-
lematic because they tend to remove all potentially important predictors of
change except those DEMO predict changes in rank order of the observations
over time. For example, in a monotonically stable growth process in which
all individuals increase at a constant rate (i.e., linearly) while maintaining the
same rank order, the important predictors of the individual slopes would be
eliminated with the inclusion of autoregressive effects. The autoregressive
model fails when intraunit change is DEMO by high-rank-order stabil-
ity over time (Stoolmiller & Bank, 1995). In addition, the autoregressive
effect is questionable as a true causal effect, and researchers have argued that
proponents of its application in longitudinal modeling have misinterpreted
the autoregressive effect as a parameter representing a true causal DEMO
when it is in fact a stability coefficient representing the boundary or initial
values of the system. For more comprehensive discussions of the problems

LONGITUDINAL FACTOR ANALYSIS
Longitudinal factor analysis (DEMO) requires multiple indicators (observed
measures) of the latent construct (i.e., the focal variable being examined for
intraunit change over time) at DEMO time point of the longitudinal design. Fig-
ure 1 depicts a four-wave longitudinal factor-analytic model in which the
focal latent variable is measured by DEMO same three indicators or items at each
time point. As shown in the figure, within each time point, the model is sim-
ply DEMO single-common-factor model. Within each time point, the common fac-
tor (construct) loadings and unique factor (error term) loadings allow the sep-
aration of the observed variance in the items into common and specific
variance. DEMO addition, because the same items are used over time, the model
separates the common covariance over time from the specific covariance
over time.
DEMO LFA model directly addresses the questions of measurement
invariance over time in terms of whether the same construct is being mea-
sured over time DEMO measured with the same precision (Questions 4 and 5).
That DEMO, in addition to hypotheses on quantitative changes, LFA allows
hypotheses about qualitative changes over time to be tested. For example, a
researcher may hypothesize an integration process describing how an indi-
vidual develops psychological safety DEMO perceptions. Let us suppose
that the hypothesized development is an integration process, moving from an
initial state in which distinct beliefs about various safety practices are

unrelated or, at best, loosely interrelated DEMO progressive states in which
these separate beliefs become increasingly interrelated to the eventual state
in which they become integrated into a single global belief (Chan, 1998b).
The researcher now requires an analytical technique to test these hypothe-
sized qualitative changes represented by the integration process. LFA is DEMO
suited for this purpose.
In LFA, tests of qualitative change (also known as factorial change in the
language of LFA) are accomplished using widely used chi-square difference
tests of nested structure equation models. It is DEMO accepted (e.g., Alwin
& Jackson, 1981; Reise, Widaman, & Pugh, 1993; Sörbom, 1974) that evi-
dence of measurement invariance DEMO time is present if each time point has
the same number of factors (in this case, we expect a single factor at each DEMO
point) with the same specific items loading on each factor (this equal factor
pattern is called configural invariance) and the factor loadings corresponding
to the identical items are equal across time points (this equal factor loading is
also called factorial invariance).
To perform the chi-square test DEMO invariance over time, a LFA model in
which factor loadings across DEMO are freely estimated (usually, one item is
selected as the reference indicator and its loading is fixed to 1 at each time
point DEMO scaling purpose, i.e., λ11 = λ42 = λ73 = λ10,4 = 1 in Figure 1; Bollen,
1989) is first fitted DEMO the data. Next, a second and more constrained model in
which DEMO loadings of the identical items are fixed to be equal and esti-
mated (i.e., λ21 =λ52 =λ83 =λ11,4; λ31 =λ62 =λ93 =λ12,4) is fitted to the data. The
second model is nested under the first model and the difference in chi-square
values from both models DEMO used as a test of statistically significant change in
fit between the models. A nonsignificant reduction in fit from the first (free
loadings) DEMO to the second (equal loadings) model is taken as evidence of
equality of factor loadings, that is, evidence of measurement invariance. This
DEMO turn indicates that if we fit a trajectory to represent intraunit change over
time, the trajectory would represent quantitative variations on the same con-
struct rather than different noncomparable quantitative values from qualita-
tively different constructs. DEMO, a significant reduction in fit from the
less to the more DEMO model would indicate inequality of factor load-
ings, that is, evidence of a lack of invariance. In this case, the researcher has
to reevaluate his or her theories of change and perhaps reformulate hypothe-
ses DEMO direct efforts to instrument development. If the researcher ignores this
lack of measurement invariance and proceeds to uncritically fit trajectories of
intraunit change over DEMO, then results obtained from the trajectory models
are likely to be DEMO

Chan / DATA ANALYSIS 355
Before fitting and directly comparing trajectories across DEMO, there is a
need to first establish evidence of measurement invariance DEMO groups for
the same reason of comparability described earlier. The popular multiple-
group approach described by Jöreskog and Sörbom (1989) is used to DEMO
invariance across groups. The logic is similar to the nested model compari-
sons just described except that we now have two mutually exclusive samples
(groups). In this multiple-group assessment, a LFA model is fitted to the two
groups simultaneously. First, a model in which factor loadings are freely esti-
mated (except for loadings of the reference indicator, which DEMO fixed) across
groups is fitted to the data. Next, a second and more constrained model in
which factor loadings of the identical indicators DEMO fixed to be equal across
groups is fitted to the data. As before, a nonsignificant reduction in fit from
the free-loadings model to the equal-loadings model indicates equality of
factor loadings across groups and is taken DEMO evidence of measurement
invariance across groups. Conversely, a significant reduction in DEMO would
indicate inequality of factor loadings, that is, evidence of a lack of invariance.
Substantive examples on how LFA models can be used DEMO systematically test
for measurement invariance across time can be found in Vandenberg and Self
(1993). For examples of testing invariance across time and groups, see Chan
(1998a).
LONGITUDINAL MEAN AND
COVARIANCE STRUCTURES ANALYSIS (LMACS)
Another latent variable technique is LMACS, which is an extension of
LFA whereby mean-level information is analyzed in addition to the variance-
DEMO information analyzed in LFA. A LMACS model is identical to the
LFA model depicted in Figure 1 with the exception that two types of DEMO
ter estimates are added to the model. The two are the intercepts (means), τs,
of the indicators and the factor means, DEMO
Because the LMACS model is simply an LFA model with additional
parameters estimated, we can test for measurement invariance across time
and groups in a LMACS model in exactly the same way as in the LFA DEMO
just described. However, the inclusion of factor means in LMACS provides DEMO
useful way to change assessment that goes beyond testing for measurement
invariance. Specifically, the invariance or the lack of invariance of the factor
means, variances, and covariances across time or groups may reflect true
change DEMO (Chan, 1998a). For example, if the true intraindividual
change DEMO time for all individuals in a group follows a positive linear
growth trajectory and all individuals change at the same rate, then we would

356 GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT
expect the factor means to increase rather DEMO remain equal over time. Alter-
natively, if all individuals follow a DEMO linear growth trajectory and they
have similar levels at initial status but differ systematically in their individual
slopes, then we would expect differences in factor variances (increasing)
across time. In the two examples just described, the differences in factor
means and factor variances should be interpreted as a result of substantive
intraindividual change and substantive individual differences in
intraindividual DEMO, respectively, rather than a lack of measurement
invariance, assuming we DEMO demonstrated that there is a single factor
across time with corresponding equality of factor loadings. In areas of
research in which there are no DEMO theories to derive specific
functional forms of the trajectories of change (DEMO, changes in adaptive per-
formance; Chan, 2000a, 2000b), LMACS serves as a useful preliminary
analysis, which both suggests and constrains the specific trajectory forms
from a virtually infinite number of possible trajectory forms DEMO be fitted to the
data.
LATENT GROWTH MODELING (LGM),
EXTENSIONS USING MULTIPLE INDICATORS (MLGM),
AND THE INTEGRATIVE LMACS-MLGM FRAMEWORK
Latent DEMO modeling (LGM) is a flexible latent variable technique that
offers a direct and comprehensive assessment of the nature of true intraunit
changes and DEMO differences in these changes. LGM also allows the esti-
mation of the associations between these differences and time-invariant or
time-varying predictor variables, and hence addresses explanatory questions
on change over time.
A basic LGM model can DEMO elaborated into a multiple-indicator model
(MLGM). The latter is essentially DEMO LGM analysis in which the focal variable
of change is modeled as a latent variable represented by multiple indicators. I
have described LGM and DEMO in detail elsewhere (LGM: Chan, 2002;
Chan, Ramey, DEMO, & Schmitt, 2000; Chan & Schmitt, 2000; MLGM:
DEMO, 1998a) and will only summarize the logic of the models here.
LGM represents the longitudinal data by modeling interunit differences in
the attributes (i.e., parameters) of intraunit changes over time (i.e., individual
growth DEMO). The model depicted in Figure 2 represents the basic form of a
univariate LGM (without multiple indicators) in which two parameters,
DEMO (representing initial status) and slope (representing rate of change),
together describe a linear pattern of intraunit change over time. The variables
DEMO to Y4 refer to the focal variable measured at four points in time at equal
intervals. As shown in the figure, the LGM resembles the classic

confirmatory factor analysis. However, because repeated measures data
from the same variable (Y) are used, the latent factors are actually interpreted
as chronometric (time) common factors representing intraunit differences
over DEMO rather than psychometric (measurement) common factors
(McArdle, 1988). Repeated measures polynomial ANOVA models are actu-
ally special cases of LGMs in DEMO only the factor means are of interest
(Meredith & Tisak, 1990).
Using LISREL notation, we say that the first latent factor, DEMO Inter-
cept, ηI, is a constant for any given unit (DEMO, individual) across time, hence
the fixed values of 1 for DEMO loadings on the repeated measures. The inter-
2
cept factor represents information about the mean, µI, and variance,σI ,ofthe
collection of intercepts of each unit’s growth curve. The second latent factor,
labeled Slope, ηS, represents information about the mean, µS, and variance,
2 , of the collection of slopes of each unit’s growth curve (for technical

details concerning choice of slope factor loadings and the variety DEMO growth
models such as those that leave the shape of trajectory unspecified, include
additional growth factors to represent different curvilinear functions [Ques-
tion 2], and has unequal time intervals, see Chan, 1998a). Both latent factors,
which are estimated from the data, are allowed to covary (estimated as σSI)as
indicated by the double-headed curved arrow between the factors. The εs

represent error variances in the repeated measures. DEMO error variances can
either be freely estimated or fixed at certain values. They can also be con-
strained to be equal across repeated measurements. DEMO, provided that
the model is identified, any of the error covariances can either be freely esti-
mated or fixed at certain values including DEMO, thus allowing a variety of a
priori error covariance structures to DEMO modeled (Question 1).
In an LGM analysis, we can estimate the means and variances of the two
growth parameters (intercept and slope factors) and examine whether the two
parameters are correlated with each other. The means and variances allow us
to examine, within a single analytic model, intraindividual change at the
group level and individual level, respectively (Question 6). The LGM analy-
sis can also be used to DEMO associations between the growth parameters
and predictor variables (Question 7). DEMO example, in newcomer adaptation
research, we can use LGM to predict initial status and rate of change in infor-
mation seeking from a DEMO personality (Chan & Schmitt, 2000). Differ-
ent univariate latent growth models can also be combined to form a
multivariate latent growth model. DEMO a multivariate growth model, parame-
ters from different change trajectories can DEMO correlated to examine cross-
domain associations (i.e., relationships between two focal variables being
examined for intraunit change over time, Question 8). For example, in a study
of interpersonal relationships, rate of change in DEMO building can be
correlated with rate of change in social integration. One or more predictors
can also be included in the multivariate model, thereby allowing tests of
hypotheses regarding differential predictions (using the same predictor) DEMO
intraunit change across domains. Finally, latent growth models (univariate or
multivariate) can be fitted simultaneously to different groups of units (e.g.,
DEMO, ethnic, occupational, experimental groups), and multiple-group
LGM analyses can DEMO performed to test for across-groups invariance of one
or more of the specified relationships in the latent growth model (Questions 3
and 9). Any two distinct growth models, provided they share a nested rela-
tionship, can be tested for statistical significance of difference in model fit
using the chi-square difference test of nested latent variable models as
described earlier.
DEMO majority of LGM applications have not incorporated measurement
invariance concerns in the model specification. To address these concerns
within the LGM framework, LGM can be extended to a MLGM in which the
focal variable of change DEMO modeled as a latent variable assessed by multiple
indicators as opposed to a manifest variable as is typically the case in prior
work on DEMO In MLGM, the focal change variable is represented as a first-
DEMO latent variable at each time point, the intercept and slope factors DEMO

Chan / DATA ANALYSIS 359
represented as second-order latent factors, and the predictors, if any, are rep-
resented as exogenous latent variables with DEMO effects on the intercept
and slope factors (represented as endogenous latent DEMO). For details,
see Chan (1998a).
The use of DEMO indicators in a latent growth model allows both ran-
dom and nonrandom measurement errors to be taken into account when
deriving the intercept and DEMO/shape factors. The use of multiple indicators
to assess the focal construct allows reliable (nonrandom) variance to be parti-
tioned into true score DEMO (construct) variance and true score unique
variance. True score unique variance is nonrandom and it is that portion of
variance in a measure DEMO is not shared with other measures of the same con-
struct. In LGM, the same measures are repeatedly administered over time.
Hence, a DEMO to partition nonrandom variance into true construct variance
and unique variance leads to distorted (inflated) estimates of true change in
the focal construct DEMO time (Question 1). Because only scale/composite
level but no DEMO (multiple indicator) information on the focal variable
is used in the standard LGM described earlier, the procedure does not provide
the isolation of nonrandom error variance from reliable variance and it takes
only random errors DEMO consideration. MLGM addresses the problem.
Finally, Chan (1998a) combined the DEMO variable approaches described
above into a two-phase analytical procedure that provides a unified frame-
work for conceptualizing and assessing change over time. In Phase DEMO of this
integrative LMACS-MLGM framework, LMACS (of which LFA is simply a
subset) is used to examine issues of measurement invariance across time and
across groups (Questions 4 and 5). These issues have logical priority because
establishing invariance provides evidence that results of subsequent growth
modeling DEMO Phase 2 of the procedure are meaningful. Building
invariance assessments into the analytic procedure as the first logical step to
longitudinal modeling contrasts with DEMO analytical models that left untested
the assumption of measurement invariance across time or groups (e.g., the
traditional techniques discussed earlier). In addition DEMO invariance assess-
ments, Phase 1 of the procedure helps in the DEMO assessment of the
basic form of intraunit change by identifying the constraints on the patterns
of true score (factor) means and variances over DEMO In Phase 2, MLGM is
used to directly assess change over DEMO by explicitly and simultaneously
modeling the group and individual growth trajectories of the focal variable as
well as their relationships to other time-invariant predictors DEMO/or time-
varying correlates (i.e., growth trajectories in a different domain). As
explained above, LMACS and MLGM together provide a unified framework
for directly addressing the nine fundamental questions on change over time.

SOME CAUTIONARY REMARKS
For all the latent variable techniques described in this DEMO, the focal
change variable is assumed to be continuous in nature. DEMO techniques were
not intended to handle categorical variables, although it is DEMO to adapt
them to accommodate categorical and other nonnormal variables (Muthen,DEMO
1984, 1996). In cases where the change variable is categorical DEMO the interest
is in modeling qualitative changes or shifts over time from one categorical
state to another, analytic models such as survival analysis, DEMO history anal-
ysis, and latent class analysis for stage-sequential dynamic variables DEMO well
suited. Excellent examples of substantive applications of these three analytic
models are available, respectively, in Morita, Lee, and Mowday (1989); Har-
rison and Hulin (1989); and Collins (1991).
The DEMO of latent variable techniques include the ability to explicitly
account for the biasing effects of random measurement error and model dif-
ferent a priori DEMO covariance structures, test a variety of complex theoreti-
cal interrelationships among DEMO, make more direct inferences from
and enhance the explanatory power of DEMO data by testing and
ruling out alternative models, assess the effects DEMO imposing restrictive
assumptions on a set of relationships, and assess a DEMO of specific mea-
surement and structural relationships across multiple groups. Latent vari-
ables models including LGM can also be easily extended to specify
mediational DEMO linking predictors to focal change variables via interven-
ing variables.
Because the problem of attrition is typical in studies employing longitudi-
nal designs, the issue of small sample sizes is likely to be problematic in
applications DEMO latent variable techniques, which require large sample sizes.
When subjects are DEMO at different repeated measurement occasions, we have
incomplete data at the DEMO level across the selected number of time
waves. To obtain adequate models of growth trajectories, recent extensions
of standard latent growth models have been developed to deal with this
incomplete data problem. These extensions essentially apply DEMO logic of
convergence analysis to “recover” missing longitudinal information.
Accounts and empirical examples of these extensions are available in
Duncan and Duncan (1994); Duncan, Duncan, and Hops (1994); and
McArdle and Hamagami (DEMO). Note, however, that although these

extensions may be able to deal adequately DEMO random missing data situa-
tions, they are likely to lead to DEMO misspecifications and misleading inter-
pretations due to biased parameter estimates when applied indiscriminately
to situations of nonrandom patterns of missing data.
Like any other DEMO model, latent variable techniques have no magical
solutions if a study DEMO poor design and instrument development, or if the
measurements, time intervals, and duration of study selected fail to capture
the true causal intervals underlying the change process over time. For exam-
ple, a change that is in fact continuous and gradual can appear in the results as
DEMO in magnitude if the time interval (i.e., the interval between Timet and
Timet+1) is too large. The converse of the problem can also occur: A change
that is in fact large in magnitude would not be revealed in the results if the
time period selected for study DEMO smaller than the true causal interval. The
time interval for repeated measurements can have dramatic effects on the
results of the analysis performed, including substantial changes in the magni-
tude of the effect sizes (e.g., DEMO, 1991; Collins, 1991; Gollob &
Reichardt, 1991). In organizational research, we almost never have a good
approximation of what the true causal interval is. Researchers have to make
some judgments when selecting DEMO intervals and the time period in the
study based on some educated guess from theory and previous research
findings.
As in all data analysis, the application of any longitudinal technique has to
base the change analysis DEMO adequate theoretical foundations. For example,
in latent growth analysis, it DEMO almost always possible to get an empirically
good-fitting growth model simply by sequentially increasing the fit of the
model through a series of atheoretical DEMO models differing in the number
of freely estimated parameters in the error variance-covariance matrix. The
resulting atheoretical model would probably have little substantive meaning
DEMO would probably not cross-validate in a different sample. When fitting
error structures, the researcher should, ideally, have a theory of error (e.g.,DEMO
specifying a particular form of method variance), model and test the hypothe-
sized and alternative error structures, and provide convergent validity for the
theory by further modeling and testing relevant error structures using addi-
tional DEMO (e.g., including an additional measure of the hypothesized
method variance construct; see Chan, 2001, and Williams & Anderson,
1994). In short, the latent variable techniques described in this article, when
driven DEMO adequate theory, design, and measurement, provide a unified
framework for DEMO the different questions on change over time corre-
sponding to various aspects of the longitudinal process of interest.
