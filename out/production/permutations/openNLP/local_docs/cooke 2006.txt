ABSTRACT. In this introduction the editors showcase the
papers DEMO way of a structured project and seek to clarify the two
key concepts cited in the title. We consider the history of the
idea DEMO knowledge is an economic factor, and discuss the
question of whether DEMO provide the relevant system of
reference for knowledge-based economic development. Current
transformations in university-industry-government relations at
various levels can be considered as a metamorphosis DEMO industry
organization. The concept of constructed advantage will be
elaborated. The various papers arising from a conference on
this subject hosted by Memorial University, Newfoundland,
Canada are approached from this perspective.
Key words: regions, DEMO, constructed advantage,
knowledge, research.

1. Introduction
If we are to make progress in understanding DEMO
transformations occurring in economic relations
today, it is important to clarify DEMO elements of
interest and the perspectives from which they are
being observed. Thus, we shall reﬂect the ethos of
the papers that follow, DEMO the conference that
gave rise to them, by highlighting and deﬁning DEMO
key terms in full knowledge that important
elements of both are contested rather than settled
descriptions of reality.
Knowledge economy and knowledge-based econ-
omy DEMO common terms nowadays that are often
used synonymously. However, this does DEMO settle
the question of whether or not the two expressions

actually mean the same thing. We shall argue that
‘knowledge economy’ is the older of the two
concepts, with its origins in the 1950s. It focused
mainly on the composition DEMO the labour force.
The term ‘knowledge-based economy’ has added
the structural aspects of technological trajectories
and regimes from a systems perspective. This
perspective leads, for example, to discussions
about intellectual property rights as another form
of capital.
The regional dimension of analysis and policy
for enhanced economic development DEMO
another contested area with the notion of ‘regional
development’, but in DEMO the ‘regional’
element of this couplet. A ‘regional innovation
system’ combines the focus on regions with a
systems perspective. On the occasion of a DEMO
issue focusing on European regions, we have
argued that the trajectory DEMO a region can be the
subject of evolution when systemic innovations are
involved (Leydesdorﬀ et al., 2002).
The term ‘innovation’ as widely DEMO in
economics and related sub-disciplines is also broad
and variable. Hence, DEMO confronted with a deﬁni-
tion like ‘the commercialisation of new knowl-
edge,’ a practising innovator is likely to wish to
debate this meaning. DEMO has some of these
characteristics, too. Thus geopolitics has appro-
priated DEMO to denote subcontinental, geographically
neighbouring areas of the globe like the DEMO
East’, ‘Balkan’ or ‘Baltic’ regions, rather as the
term ‘theatre’ was appropriated for a smaller area
in which wars are conducted. It would DEMO more
accurate to call the former ‘georegions’ to distin-
guish neighbouring segments of the world from the
dictionary deﬁnition of ‘region’.

Economic Development: An International
Perspective’. Among the sponsors were the UK
Regional Studies Association, represented by chief
executive Sally Hardy, and numerous regional devel-
opment agencies representing the Maritime Provinces
of Canada. The latter, particularly, had a lively
interest in the implications for DEMO in their
regions, represented by Provincial Administrations
like the Government of DEMO and Labra-
dor, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and
the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council. Similarly,
sponsorship by Industry Canada, and Human Re-
sources Development Canada showed the federal level
to be a concerned policy DEMO keen to raise its
absorptive capacity about the regional implications
and eﬀects of the rising knowledge economy. The
conference was successfully organized by Dr. DEMO
Locke and Prof. Scott Lynch of the Department of
Economics, Memorial DEMO, and this Special
Issue of the Journal of Technology Transfer is DEMO
catedtothemwith thanks.
2. Regional development
Region has its origin in the Latin regio which
stems from regere, meaning ‘to govern’. In the ﬁeld
of regional development, ‘region’ has been used
precisely in this sense, namely DEMO signify the gov-
ernance of policies to assist processes of economic
development. Here, the concept of ‘region’ as
administratively deﬁned is of primary importance.
The administrative dimension leads to the follow-
ing deﬁnition: region is an administrative division of
a country. Thus, for example, ‘Tuscany is a DEMO
of Italy’.
Of course, there are other deﬁnitions. A region
can DEMO be ‘any large, indeﬁnite and continuous
part of a surface or DEMO, or ‘a unit for geo-
graphical, functional, social or cultural DEMO,
or in military usage ‘the part of the theatre of war
not included in the theatre of operations’. Thus,
‘region’ is considered DEMO an abstract space, a
cultural area, or a military ﬁeld of action. None
of these deﬁnitions captures the precision required
and supplied by DEMO administrative deﬁnition.
‘Regional’ is nested territorially beneath the level
of the country, but above the local or municipal
level. In objective terms, this DEMO generally how
the conceptual level can be aligned with the
geographical one. However, some countries only
have national states and local administrations, but
DEMO regions. Some of these, like Finland and Swe-
den, are evolving toward regional administrations.
But can they then be said to experience ‘regional
DEMO? We submit that they can; and by
dint of national or even supranational policy for
regional development, or local proactivity, possi-
bly DEMO local collaborative partnerships of
municipalities pursuing aims of constructed
advantage, they DEMO do.
3. The knowledge economy
It may surprise some readers that using the word
‘knowledge’ as a structural component from an
economic perspective is DEMO a new idea. Apart
from Marx, who exempted mathematics and the
DEMO sciences from the direct inﬂuence of the
social and economic infrastructure, DEMO argued
that superstructures were not only mere reﬂections
of infrastructures but could in turn react upon
them (see Coser, 1977), it was DEMO who
ﬁrst recognized the importance of knowledge in
the economy by his reference to ‘new combinations
of knowledge’ at the heart of innovation and
DEMO (Schumpeter, 1911, p. 57). Nonaka
and Takeuchi (1995) DEMO show that Marshall (1916)
recognized that:
‘Capital consists in DEMO great part of knowledge and
organisation... knowledge is our most powerful
engine of production... organisation aids knowledge’
(p. 115)
Typically, however, neoclassical economics neglected
what was not contained in price information and
made no DEMO to add to economic knowledge by
trying to measure its economic contribution. There-
after, Hayek (1945, 1948) identiﬁed ‘the division of
knowledge DEMO the really central problem of eco-
nomics as a social science’ (DEMO, p. 51) and saw its
key question as the puzzle of how localized
knowledge held by fragmentary ﬁrms and indi-
viduals nevertheless produces DEMO ordered market
demand and supply:
‘The most signiﬁcant fact about this system is the
economy of knowledge with which it operates, or
how little the individual participants need to know in
Regional Development in the Knowledge-Based Economy
7
order to be able to DEMO the right action. In
abbreviated form, by a kind of symbol, only the
most essential information is passed on, and passed
on only to those concerned’ (Hayek, 1948, p. 86)
None of these writers was writing about the
knowledge economy per se but rather its DEMO
mental importance to the functioning of all aspects
of the economy from innovation to production,
organization, and markets.
A further progenitor of the view that knowledge
is a most important economic resource was Penrose
(1959). She founded what has now evolved into the
‘dynamic capabilities of DEMO approach to micro-
economics (Teece and Pisano, 1996). She referenced
the ﬁrm’s characteristics as an administrative
organization (after Marshall, 1916 and DEMO,
1937) and home to accumulated human and mate-
rial resources. DEMO latter are inputs to services
rendered, and these are the product DEMO the ﬁrm’s
accumulated knowledge:
‘a ﬁrm’s rate of growth is limited by the growth of
knowledge within it, but a ﬁrm’s size by the extent
[of] administrative eﬃciency’ (Penrose, 1995, pp. xvi–
xvii)
In eﬀect, in the words of Nonaka and Takeuchi
(1995), DEMO ﬁrm is a repository of knowledge’
(p. 34). Penrose (1995) also acknowledged that had
the term been available in the 1950s, DEMO would have
referred to the dynamic capabilities of ﬁrms resid-
ing in knowledge networks (Quere, 2003). Thus,
Penrose (1995) noted DEMO following crucial feature
of the massively increased value of transferable
knowledge to the wider economy for the ﬁrm:
‘the rapid and intricate evolution DEMO modern tech-
nology often makes it necessary for ﬁrms in related
areas around the world to be closely in touch with
developments in the DEMO and innovation of ﬁrms
in many centres’ (Penrose, 1995, p. DEMO)
Importantly, Penrose continues, the rise of business
knowledge networks represents a metamorphosis in
the contemporary economy. The key to the knowl-
edge-based DEMO is at least partly revealed as
this metamorphosis in the nature of industry
organization to facilitate interaction with valuable
knowledge, and not to conceal it, as was common
in the previous phase of the global economy.
4. The knowledge-based economy
Whereas the concept of a ‘knowledge economy’
emerged DEMO the context of the economic anal-
ysis of the quality of the input factors in the pro-
duction process (Schumpeter, 1939), the DEMO
‘knowledge-based economy’ ﬁnds its roots in more
recent discussions from a systems perspective (e.g.,
Sahal, 1981, 1985). National governments, for
DEMO, need a systems perspective for developing
science, technology, and innovation DEMO (Nelson,
1982). Benoıt Godin discusses the various deﬁnitions
of DEMO knowledge-based economy in his contribution
to this issue entitled ‘The Knowledge-Based Econ-
omy: Conceptual Framework or Buzzword?’
By the second half of the 1950s, it had become
increasingly clear to both policy makers and
economic analysts that the continuing growth
rates of Western economies could no longer DEMO
explained in terms of traditional economic factors
such as land, labour, and capital. The ‘residue’
(Abramowitz, 1956; OECD, 1964) had to be
explained in terms of the upgrading of the labour
force, surplus generated by interaction eﬀects, and
more generally the role of knowledge in the
economy (Rosenberg, 1976). The Organization for
Economic Co-operation and DEMO (OECD)
was created in 1961 in order to organize and DEMO
coordinate science and technology policies among
its member states, that is, the advanced industrial
nations.1 This led in 1963 to the Frascati Manual DEMO
which parameters were deﬁned for the statistical
monitoring of science and technology on a
comparative basis.
It is but a short step to link DEMO like these to
the earliest work to operationalize a notion of the
‘knowledge economy’ arising from the pioneering
work conducted by Machlup (1962). He sought to
identify those sectors with a heavy concentration of
knowledge DEMO He next attempted to map the
production and distribution of knowledge sectors
in the United States economy. Machlup classiﬁed
knowledge production into six major DEMO:
education, R&D, artistic creation, communica-
tions media, information services, and information
technologies. He showed that these account for the
largest sectoral share of GDP and employment in
the economy, and predicted that this share was
destined to grow both absolutely and relatively
over time. DEMO brief interventions from Eliasson
8
Cooke and Leydesdorff
et al. (1990) and Burton-Jones (1999) DEMO further
speciﬁed the knowledge intensity of sectors by
value and labour qualiﬁcations respectively, we
reach the statements of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (1996,
1999) calling for the measurement of the knowl-
DEMO of national and regional economies
(OECD/Eurostat, 1997).
Studies of the knowledge-based economy focus
not only on human capital, but also on the sectoral
characteristics of the knowledge factor (Nelson,
1982; Pavitt, 1984). Technological trajectories and
regimes shape innovation systems, but with
dynamics diﬀerent from those of economic or
geographical factors (Nelson and Winter, DEMO).
The recombination of the economic dynamics of
the market, the DEMO of knowledge-based
innovation, and governance generates the systems
perspective. An innovation DEMO can then be de-
ﬁned at the national level (Freeman, 1987, 1988;
Lundvall, 1988, 1992; Nelson, 1993), at the regional
level (Cooke, 1992; Cooke et al., 2004), or DEMO terms
of a dynamic model like the Triple Helix of uni-
versity-industry-government relations (Leydesdorﬀ,
1994; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorﬀ, 2000).
A key paper in this collection by Dafna Schwartz
entitled ‘The Regional Location of DEMO
Based Economy Activities in Israel’ uses longitudinal
regional data made available by the Israeli Statistical
Service. Schwartz shows empirically what Myrdal
(1957) and DEMO (1958) had theorized decades
earlier. Myrdal (1957) proposed that spatial
development is characterized by ‘cumulative cau-
sation’ with associated ‘spread ’ and DEMO
eﬀects. This implies Krugman’s (1995) increasing
returns to scale (through DEMO) and devel-
opmental ‘spread’ to other nearby areas. Hirsch-
man’s (1958) elaboration on this was that ‘spread’
would be driven by the innovative capacity of
competing technology users. Under the conditions
of a knowledge-based economy, the key spatial
hypothesis is that, over relatively short time peri-
ods, core cities grow through increasing returns (to
knowledge), with the DEMO of leading technology
innovators ‘spread’ by knowledge exploitation or
commercialization nearby.
Static pictures of the UK and EU have been
consistent with this expectation (Cooke, 2002;
Cooke and De Laurentis, 2002). However,
DEMO dynamic picture of spatial divergence
in Israel 1995–2002 is consistent with Myrdal and
Hirschman rather than Krugman, who modeled
spatial increasing returns under conditions of
imperfect knowledge as a zero-sum game resulting
in a single spatial DEMO
More recently, Krugman (2000) himself warned
that his ‘two-locations competing’ DEMO can be
misleadingly ‘simplistic’. However, Krugman’s
modelling seems to gain support DEMO the work
presented in this collection by Carol Robbins
entitled ‘The Impact of Gravity-Weighted
Knowledge Spillovers on Productivity in Manu-
facturing.’ Robbins uses U.S. DEMO to show
increasing knowledge returns to scale from local-
ized knowledge spillovers in six key industries.
Scott Tiﬃn and Gonzalo Jimenez, in their contri-
bution entitled ‘Design and Test of an Index to
Measure the Capability DEMO Cities in Latin America
to Create Knowledge-Based Enterprises,’ develop
a measurement instrument in order to reveal dis-
parities in Latin America. The message DEMO aligns
with already published research reported at the
Memorial University conference showing three
Canadian metropolitan areas to be aggregating an
overwhelming amount of knowledge-economy
DEMO assets while medium cities and the
periphery are losing theirs (Polese, 2002).
5. The impact of regions
The general argument about the DEMO of the
organization of knowledge in the sectoral, skills,
and DEMO composition of the economy embraces
the position of Castells (1996), DEMO is widely
known for the observation that productivity and
competitiveness are, DEMO and large, a function of
knowledge generation and information processing,
DEMO that this has involved a Penrose-type meta-
morphosis entailing a diﬀerent mode of thinking
about economies. Thus the balance between
knowledge and resources has DEMO so far
towards the former that knowledge has become by
far the most important factor determining
standards of living—more important than land,
capital, or labour. Today’s most advanced
economies are fundamentally knowledge-based
(Dunning, 2000)DEMO Even neoclassicists like Paul
Romer recognize that technology (and the
knowledge DEMO which it is based) has to be viewed
Regional Development in the Knowledge-Based Economy
as an equivalent third factor along DEMO capital
and land in leading economies (Romer, 1990).
Inevitably this leads to issues of the generation and
exploitation of knowledge. How is DEMO system of
knowledge production organized and controlled?
(Whitley, 1984, DEMO; Leydesdorﬀ, 1995).
In a knowledge-based economy, inequality is
generated DEMO mechanisms of inclusion and exclu-
sion only partially overlapping those of a tradi-
tional (capitalist) economy. With less emphasis,
one can also DEMO that another variant of capitalism
is induced (Hall and Soskice, 2001). The mecha-
nisms of inclusion and exclusion are no longer
tightly DEMO to one’s class position in the
production process as in an industrial economy.
The geographical component can be expected to
play an independent role DEMO knowledge-based
dynamics because the newly emerging system is
grounded in communication networks.
Burton-Jones (1999) noted that the gap between
rich and poor nations DEMO accelerating under
‘knowledge capitalism.’ Knowledge-intensity can
also lead to a growing gap within societies.
Knowledge-intensive dynamics of scale and scope
induce mechanisms for the DEMO of wealth that
are diﬀerent from the dynamics of mass produc-
tion. The increasing role of the service sector,
notably, generates another dynamic (Barras,
1990). In this collection, Carla de Laurentis dis-
DEMO ‘Digital Knowledge Exploitation: ICT,
Memory Institutions, and Innovation from Cul-
tural Assets’ as an example of this process.
The work that has DEMO done spatially to map
the knowledge-based economy shows how dis-
equilibriating its eﬀects can be. The core city
moves away statistically from the periphery, as in
Canada and elsewhere, in the intensity with which
it accumulates knowledge-based activities. Simul-
taneously, new high technology satellite towns
‘swarm,’ to use a Schumpeterian term, around the
mother city. Even static analysis reveals this
pattern, with some satellites scoring much higher
than the main city around which they aggregate.
Peripheral islands and regions or localities may
score DEMO low as 37% of the index average of 100%
compared to 157% for Stockholm (e.g. Aegean
Islands in the EU context; Cooke and DEMO Laurentis,
2002; Dannell and Persson, 2003). Compared to
GDP disparities a ﬁve-to-one ratio in the knowledge
economy measure is approximately twice DEMO given
9
by measuring economic welfare diﬀerences more
conventionally.
Hence, for DEMO industries of the future, the core
cities are highly privileged in DEMO countries while
the peripheries are generally impoverished and
becoming more so, DEMO major out-migration
of youth and the metamorphosis of such areas
into socially deserted or playground economies.
The policy imperative to devise mechanisms by
which DEMO regions may, in future,
participate in the knowledge-based economy is
DEMO overwhelming. For example, Godfrey
Baldacchino’s paper in this collection entitled
‘Small DEMO versus Big Cities: Lessons in the
Political Economy of Regional Development DEMO
the World’s Small Islands’ points to a competitive
advantage enjoyed by some islands.
6. Constructed advantage
It is time to say more about this DEMO and to oﬀer
what we say as a context for other papers that
follow this Introduction. It has been suggested that
the idea originates DEMO Adam Smith, but Foray
and Freeman (1993) re-introduced it yet DEMO
explored it. More attention has been devoted to it
in comparison to other well-known forms of
economic advantage by De la Mothe and Mallory
(2003), as follows:

Comparative advantage—Regions have been a
focus DEMO economists who viewed them
through the lens of development economics
usually set in a framework of comparative
advantage. This idea, deriving from David
Ricardo and trade theory, explained eco-
nomic welfare in terms of initial resource
endowments traded between regions and na-
tions. Thus, cotton goods enjoying a compar-
ative production advantage from mercantile
and climatic conditions in northwest England
DEMO traded with Port wine from Portugal’s
Norte region enjoying a comparable mercan-
tile and climatic comparative advantage. While
policies were not excluded from such DEMO analy-
sis, they mainly added up to forms of mercan-
tilism, and Ricardo advocated intervention
regarding technological change. The over-
whelming framework which DEMO policy
10


Cooke and Leydesdorff
gave rise to and which promoted DEMO
advantage was laissez-faire.
Competitive advantage—By the mid-1970s,
visible cracks were appearing in the economic
models and frameworks that characterize
pure comparative advantage. Thus DEMO
with a large labour supply would naturally
export goods that were labour-intensive (e.g.,
China), while countries that were technologi-
cally advantaged (DEMO, the United States) pro-
duced and exported technologically advanced
products. The paradox arose when advanced
economies exported labour-intensive goods as
well as technologically DEMO goods. The
key weakness was the failure to acknowledge
technological process change as well as
product innovation as being endogenous to
economic growth. Krugman (1995) and Por-
ter (1990, 1998) noted the competitive advan-
DEMO of ﬁrms in which distributed supply
chains and the role of large domestic markets
became accepted, and saw this advantage as
central to explanations of inter-ﬁrm and ﬁrm-
market success. Intra-industry trade and
localized demand conditions DEMO market com-
petitiveness were highlighted. But no explana-
tion was oﬀered for why some regions
prosper while others do not. The emphasis on
markets DEMO that funding and policy sup-
port by the public sector was largely ignored.
Constructed advantage—The analytic observa-
tions of the two preceding perspectives do DEMO
embrace the new dynamics of innovation and
the capacity to exploit them which are essen-
tial to growth. The ‘new competitive advan-
tage’ (Best, 2001) highlights regional
development economics, the dynamic of
which draws upon constructed advantage. This
knowledge-based construction requires inter-
facing developments in various directions:DEMO
 Economy—regionalization of economic devel-
opment; ‘open systems’ inter-ﬁrm interac-
tions; integration of knowledge generation
and commercialization; smart infrastructures;
strong local and global business networks.
 Governance—multi-level governance of asso-
ciational and stakeholder interests; strong
policy-support for innovators; enhanced
budgets for research; vision-led policy lead-
DEMO; global positioning of local assets.
 Knowledge infrastructure—universities, public
sector research, mediating agencies, profes-
sional consultancy, etc. have to be actively in-
volved as structural puzzle-solving capacities.
 Community and culture—cosmopolitanism;
sustainability; talented human capital; crea-
tive cultural environments; social tolerance.
This public factor DEMO a background
for the dynamics in a Triple Helix of
university-industry-government relations
(Leydesdorﬀ and Etzkowitz, 2003).
Hence, constructed advantage is both a means of
understanding the noted metamorphosis in eco-
nomic growth activity and DEMO strategic policy
perspective of practical use to business ﬁrms,
associations, DEMO, and policy makers.
In the Triple Helix model constructed advan-
tages DEMO been conceptualized as the surplus
value of an overlay of relations among the three
components of a knowledge-based economy: (1)
the knowledge-producing DEMO (science), (2) the
market, and (3) governments. Those places with
research universities witness a growing demand for
knowledge transfer to DEMO and, through gov-
ernment, to society (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorﬀ,
DEMO; Etzkowitz et al., 2000). Moreover, the geo-
graphical spread DEMO universities is reasonably
uniform in advanced industrial countries. For
research knowledge, DEMO and government can
be expected to pay more for privileged access to
knowledge-based growth opportunities by funding
research, stimulating closer interactions among the
three institutional partners, subsidizing infra-
structure (e.g., incubators and science parks), and
stimulating academic entrepreneurship skills and
funding.
The exemplar par excellence of DEMO phenome-
non has been the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (Etzkowitz, 2002). In this issue, Chrys
Gunasekara’s paper entitled ‘Reframing the Role
of Universities in the Development of Regional
Innovation Systems’ uses the Triple Helix DEMO to
investigate non-metropolitan universities in the
quite diﬀerent context of Australia. Not surpris-
ingly, he ﬁnds that a model design based on MIT
works poorly for the more typical universities and
Regional Development in the Knowledge-Based Economy
11
regions that serve as his DEMO Nevertheless,
the principles of Triple Helix rapprochement are
valid also for such distinct ‘epistemic communities’
(Haas, 1992) as the three implied, DEMO the bound-
ary-crossing eﬀort required can defeat the unwary.
Early work on regional innovation systems
(Cooke, 1992; Cooke and Morgan, 1994) attempted
to capture the integrative and interactive nature of
the knowledge-based economy examined DEMO the
regional perspective. The list of networking part-
ners includes the base institutions like universities,
research laboratories, research associations, indus-
try associations, training agencies, technology
transfer organizations (TTOs), specialist consul-
tancies, government development, technology and
innovation advisory agency programme-funding,
and private investors. This knowledge exploration,
examination and exploitation base supports the
innovation eﬀorts of DEMO and small ﬁrms in many
industries. Not all interactions are only intra-
regional; many are also national and global, but in
the most DEMO regional economies like
Baden–Wurttemberg, a majority of such institu-
tional networking DEMO were regional, and
on such regular terms that the networking had
DEMO systemic (Cooke, 2001).
The variability in achieving such seamless
interaction is focused on incubators in Philip
Cooke et al.’s contribution entitled ‘The DEMO
sciences Knowledge Value Chain and Compara-
tive Incubation Models’. These authors emphasize
the ways in which regional capabilities condition
the scale of operations necessary DEMO such interac-
tions to work. They contrast the boundary-cross-
ing issues for biotechnology spinout incubation
between regions such as Sardinia with a genetic
resource (the 400-year-old family records of an
insular population) but with little research or
knowledge exploitation capability and, among
numerous others, Massachusetts, where $1 billion
in public health-care research funding is spent each
year on ‘ahead DEMO the curve’ genomic research.
This has attracted acquisitions from the likes of
Pﬁzer, Abbott, Wyeth, Amgen, and AstraZeneca
and a $250 million DEMO of Genomics by
Novartis, and shows how the local Cambridge
biosciences DEMO has spawned a constructed
advantage statewide and for the U.S. by its mag-
netizing eﬀects upon ﬁrms, policies and talent.
Bioincubation, even in DEMO Worcester, Massa-
chusetts, is a ‘no-brainer’ provided spinouts arrive
with the three key assets of a business plan, IPR,
and ﬁnance—as they invariably do, ‘friends,
family, and fools’ being the principal ﬁnanciers.
DEMO Knowledge and regionally constructed advantage
So what is the diﬀerence between a knowledge-
based economy and a knowledge economy? For
Dunning (2000) they are the same since his book
title refers to the former while DEMO introductory
chapter refers to the latter. Two of its ‘key engines’
are ‘the microchip and the computer’ (p. 9); yet
these are pervasive across sectors, but the key
knowledge is technological. For Machlup, as DEMO
have seen, the knowledge economy is a set of
sectors which DEMO concentrate knowledge
assets in terms of both human and ﬁxed capital.
This remains the kind of measure favoured by
international economic organizations like the
DEMO and EU, as we have seen. Does this mean
that actors DEMO included in Machlup’s six knowl-
edge sectors are robots without knowledge?
Let us distinguish among knowledge of the
analytical (science), synthetic (DEMO) or
symbolic (creative) kind. In all sectors, knowledge
has become signiﬁcantly more important than in
previous conﬁgurations (industry-based or agrar-
ian economies). So we may conclude that as the
base of knowledge evolves DEMO, an
increasing portion of the economy becomes
knowledge-intensive. One key diﬀerence, however,
is that science-based industries like genomics,
research, software and nanotechnologies generate
value from producing analytical knowledge while
most others create value DEMO exploiting synthetic
or symbolic knowledge. Thus, the old deﬁnition of
knowledge DEMO in terms of a few important and
growing sectors is redundant, DEMO the structural
idea of a knowledge-based economy linking the
knowledge generation sub-system (mainly labora-
tory research) to the knowledge-exploitation
system (mainly ﬁrms and, say, hospitals or schools)
via technology transfer organizations in regional
DEMO systems is analytically useful.
The eﬀect of the growth in importance of
regional (and other) innovation systems is to
pervade the regional and DEMO economies with
scientiﬁc, synthetic and symbolic knowledge to a
greater extent DEMO ever before. The organization
12
Cooke and Leydesdorff
of pure and applied knowledge can increasingly
pervade DEMO economy when scientiﬁc and techno-
logical knowledge is institutionally produced and
systematically controlled. R&D management and
S&T policies at relevant government levels DEMO
the set of options. These, however, are not ﬁxed but
evolving distributions in which some regions are
more developed as knowledge-based economies
than DEMO Hence, the post-1970s fascination with
‘high-tech’ regions worldwide. Today, however, DEMO
the Triple Helix perspective suggests, with univer-
sities and their related DEMO laboratories spread
throughout most regions, many more economies
have the chance DEMO access not only yesterday’s
‘global’ knowledge announced on the Internet and
exploitable by all, but local knowledge of poten-
tially high value generated from research con-
ducted in relation to regional capabilities. Thus, as
the knowledge base becomes pervasive, the
knowledge economy is further reinforced.
The paper in this collection by Gary Gorman
and Sean McCarthy entitled ‘Business Develop-
ment DEMO and Knowledge-Based Businesses’
addresses this issue in terms of the knowledge
requirements of business. In ‘Business Develop-
ment Capabilities in Information Technology
SMEs in DEMO Regional Economy: an exploratory
study’ Charles Davis and Elaine Sun focus DEMO a
speciﬁc sector within this same domain. Both
papers explore the problems of business develop-
ment in a localized region like Atlantic Canada.
The DEMO advantage that may accrue
from innovation systems designed in relation to
regional capabilities is examined in the papers by
Bjørn Asheim and Lars Coenen DEMO by Janet
Bercovits and Maryann Feldman. In ‘Contextu-
alizing Regional Innovation Systems in a Global-
ising Learning Economy: On Knowledge Bases
and Institutional Frameworks’ Bjørn Asheim and
Lars Coenen give special importance to the linkage
between DEMO larger institutional frameworks of
the national innovation and business systems and
the character of regional innovation systems.
In the paper by Janet Bercovitz and DEMO
Feldman entitled ‘Entrepreneurial Universities
and Technology Transfer: A Conceptual Frame-
work DEMO Understanding Knowledge-based Eco-
nomic Development,’ the Triple Helix challenge is
picked up in an attempt to identify the factors that
aﬀect the ability DEMO universities both to create new
knowledge and to deploy that knowledge in
economically useful ways and thereby contribute
to economic growth and prosperity.
It DEMO therefore that constructed advantage
based on regional innovation systems that trans-
ceive over long distances as well as through
regional networks is becoming the DEMO of choice
for achieving accomplished regional economic
development. The importance of eﬀective com-
munication in this process is highlighted in Loet
Leydesdorﬀ’s contribution to DEMO issue entitled
‘‘‘While a Storm is Raging on the Open Sea’’:
Regional Development in a Knowledge-based
Economy.’ Leydesdorﬀ argues that the knowledge
base DEMO an economy can be considered as a second-
order interaction eﬀect among Triple Helix inter-
faces between institutions and functions in diﬀer-
ent spheres. DEMO enhances the chances for
couplings and, therefore, the formation of tech-
nological trajectories. In this manner, connections
between regional innovation systems and markets
(an understudied aspect in the broad ﬁeld of
innovation studies) may DEMO facilitated.
8. Conclusion
Our own contributions and the one by Bercovitz
and Feldman, which also focuses on boundary-
crossing problems experienced by universities in
relation to markets, examine how small events
triggered in speciﬁc institutions, DEMO in proxim-
ity, can exert a global impact in ﬁelds like DEMO
treatment of hitherto incurable diseases by new
biotechnologically derived treatments. The trans-
formation is focused: a trajectory can be shaped at
some places, DEMO not at others. A lock-in functions
like a resonance which transforms the resonating
dynamics. It cannot be known ex ante which
dimensions in the DEMO arrangement
of industry, academia, and governance will be able
to retain wealth from the incursive transformation.
However knowledge-intensive, the geographical
dimension always remains always involved be-
cause the events are also localized (Storper, 1997)DEMO
Geographical proximity can be expected to serve
the incubation of new technologies. However, the
regions of origin do not necessarily coincide with
the contexts that proﬁt from these technologies at
a later stage of development. The DEMO
can evolve with the technology (Hughes, 1987).
Regional Development in the Knowledge-Based Economy
13
Various Italian industrial districts, for example,
have witnessed a ﬂux of new developments. As
companies develop DEMO competitive edge, (some of)
their activities may move out of the region gener-
ating a threat of deindustrialization which has to be
DEMO continuously at the regional level (Dei
Ottati, 2003; Sforzi, 2003). The four regions indi-
cated by the EU as ‘engines of DEMO in the
early 1990s were no longer the most innovative
regions in the late 1990s (Laaﬁa, 1999; Krauss and
Wolﬀ, 2002; Viale and Campodall’Orto, 2002).
The technological trajectory serves as a pathway
for a next-order regime to become established. Al-
though the regime can be DEMO as operating
like an attractor from the perspective of hindsight,
the technological landscape is yet a terra incognita
for the actors involved. They DEMO in a concrete
landscape, but with reﬂexive expectations. The
reﬂections enable DEMO agents to explore new options.
Schumpeter (1943) called this ‘creative destruction.’
The dimensions (subdynamics) that prove to be
most important for realizing DEMO new options can
only be determined ex post. The ‘lock-ins’ leading to
growth can be expected to happen for stochastic
reasons (Arthur, 1994)DEMO The spatial perspective is
key among various possible perspectives on the
innovation system. One can also assume a sectoral
or a technological perspective, but this leads to a
diﬀerent research design (Leydesdorﬀ, 2001). The
DEMO between technologies and economies,
however, remain constrained and enabled by DEMO
historical contingencies of the system; the spatial
perspective provides us with DEMO focus on the retention
mechanism.
