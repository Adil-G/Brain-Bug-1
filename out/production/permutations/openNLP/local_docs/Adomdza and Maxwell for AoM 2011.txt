Affective regulation of entrepreneurial passion
Abstract
Passion is seen as a critical DEMO for entrepreneurs but, as is the case with all affective
factors, passion may need to be regulated to realize its benefits and avoid DEMO pitfalls. We study the
regulation passion and its impact on a cognitive psychological variable, psychological capital,
which is expected to channel the manifestation of entrepreneurial passion in venture activities. We
observe a strong positive relationship DEMO passion and psychological capital. However, we find
that the more antecedent-focused DEMO entrepreneur’s strategy for regulation, the weaker the
relationship between passion and DEMO capital. Our results suggest that by varying the level
of reappraisal strategy employed, entrepreneurs can regulate their entrepreneurial passion to suit
their circumstances. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
1.
Executive summary
Scholars have long DEMO that passion is an important affective mechanism that is a
motivating factor in entrepreneurship (Baum & Locke, 2004; Bird, 1988; Shane, DEMO & Collins,
2003). Studies on the role of entrepreneurial passion are expected to shed light on why some
entrepreneurs persist despite major DEMO, while others give their ideas away; and why passion
seems to burn bright for some and wane for others (Cardon et al., DEMO). Current research efforts
are based on how passion affects entrepreneurial identity, cognitions, behaviors, and outcomes
(Cardon, et al., 2009a&b; Chen, Yao & Kotha, 2009). However, since affect (feelings DEMO
emotions) such as passion impacts actions and behaviors through complex mechanisms (Isen &
1
Baron, 1991; Baron, 2008), it is important to study the regulation of passion in its influence of
entrepreneurial attitudes and behavior.
Affect DEMO involves a process by which individuals influence which [affects] they
have, DEMO they have them and how they experience and express them (Gross, 1999). Thus,
―affective regulation‖ refers to strategies deployed by the DEMO for controlling affect, and is
critical in entrepreneurship for a number DEMO reasons.  First, the nature of entrepreneurial
environments is highly varied, DEMO changes due to external factors (Baron, 2008).  Changing
conditions DEMO stress for entrepreneurs who have to be able to manage the extreme highs and
lows of their affective reactions to succeed. Second, entrepreneurs’ displays of affect often
influence their ability to attract employees (Cardon, 2008), and build partnership to access
resources - specifically to secure critical finance from investors (e.g. Baron, 2008; Sudek, 2006).
However, while entrepreneurs are often successful in using their affect in this way, empirical
evidence shows that in some cases passion fails to entice potential investors (Chen et al., 2009;
Balachandra & Briggs, 2010; Cardon, DEMO al., 2009b). This suggests that in some cases, entrepreneurs
would be well advised to regulate their passion, in order to attract investment.
Third, affect
influences how entrepreneurs behave. Given the leadership role of the entrepreneur in a new
venture on one hand, and the dynamic environment of the entrepreneurial activity on the other;
different venture outcomes may DEMO achieved if the entrepreneur regulates his or her affective
reaction to the dynamic environment (Baron, 2008; Gross & John, 2003).
We DEMO how two types of regulation, cognitive reappraisal and expressive
suppression, moderate the influence of passion on the entrepreneur’s cognitive preparedness to
venture.  Cognitive reappraisal comes in to play before the response tendencies of the affect
DEMO are formed, whereas expressive suppression comes in to play after the DEMO is
2
underway and reactionary tendencies have been initiated. The key distinction between the DEMO is
based on where the regulation has its primary impact on the process of affective reactions: before or
after the reaction tendencies to the identified affect have been formed (Gross 2001; Gross & John,
DEMO). Given the importance of passion in predicting outcome success, and DEMO potential for
undesirable outcomes, it is important to explore how each DEMO these regulation strategies affects
outcomes.
Finally, in accessing how regulation strategies DEMO passion, we also examine one
important cognitive psychological factor that has DEMO potential to explain how entrepreneurial
passion motivates entrepreneurs’ psychological state. It is referred to as psychological capital
(Psycap), which is conceptualized as a psychological resource that complements other resources,
such as human capital and DEMO capital, in achieving certain task outcomes. As such, Psycap
defines an individual’s positive psychological state of development that is characterized by
confidence (self-efficacy), optimism, perseverance (goal orientation) and resilience (Luthans,
Youssef, & Avolio, 2007). These characteristics of Psycap can provide a sense of the goal-directed
cognitions of a passionate entrepreneur. In other words, the construct captures cognitive drive to
attain the behavioral outcomes identified for the DEMO passion construct (such as problem
solving, persistence and absorption – cf. Cardon et al., 2009a). Psycap allows us to apply interesting
observations about motivations and behaviors from psychology to increase our understanding of
entrepreneurship.
DEMO our research, we empirically investigate the moderating effect of both types DEMO regulation
(reappraisal and suppression) on how entrepreneurial passion affects Psycap. We use self-regulation
theory to predict this relationship and help us develop our DEMO (Carver & Scheier, 1998;
Baumeister & Vohs, 2007). DEMO set-up allows us to discuss theories on the relationship between
3
affect regulation strategies in entrepreneurial situations, and seek support for these theories based
on empirical evidence. We are also able to draw conclusions about DEMO different self-regulation
strategies influence the role of affect in entrepreneurial outcomes such as: entrepreneurial creative
problem solving, persistence and absorption in one’s activities (Cardon et al., 2009a); venture
efforts (Foo, Uy, & DEMO, 2009); opportunity recognition, resource acquisition and coping (Baron,
DEMO) and risk assessments (Palich and Bagby, 1995; Foo, 2011)DEMO Affect regulation may cause some
entrepreneurs to persist and others to not persist, as well as provide insights as to how entrepreneurs
might deal with high levels of uncertainty (Baron, 2008). It may also DEMO entrepreneurs learn from
failure (McGrath, 1999; Shepherd, 2003) and DEMO the number of businesses that fail (Gimeno,
Folta, Cooper, DEMO Woo, 1997).
We find a strong positive relationship between entrepreneurial DEMO and psychological
capital suggesting that passionate entrepreneurs do rely on positive cognitive drives to channel the
passion their venturing activities. We also find high DEMO strategy makes entrepreneurial
passion redundant while low reappraisal strategy seems to retain its presence with psychological
capital. The result suggests that by varying the DEMO of reappraisal strategy employed, entrepreneurs
can regulate their entrepreneurial passion to DEMO their circumstances.
We make contributions to research and practice. This is the first study, we are aware of, that
studies the regulation of DEMO passion as conceived by Cardon et al (2009a). We extend
DEMO conceptualization of entrepreneurial passion by throwing light on the possible role of motivating
cogntive factors that may be needed to carry passion through the DEMO and uncertainties of
entrepreneurship. Such cognitive factors may also serve as conduits through which passionate
entrepreneurs sustain focus on the role identities that support DEMO passion. Further, by employing a
framework that studies affect regulation along DEMO timeline of the unfolding affective responses, this
4
paper extends the current research on affect in entrepreneurship. Thus, by focusing on when an
affect makes its primary impact on the affect-generative process, this study unveils a new paradigm
for studying affective responses to the DEMO of activities that entrepreneurs perform. Finally, our
results suggest that entrepreneurs DEMO practitioners should be able to vary the level of reappraisal
strategy to regulate entrepreneurial passion in different situations—for self-motivation, to allow
high levels of objectivity or to signal emotional stability. .

Theory and hypothesis development
DEMO Self-regulation theory
We use self-regulation theory (Carver & Scheier, 1998; DEMO & Vohs, 2007) to
explain the relationships proposed in this study. Self-regulation refers to one’s ability to alter ones
behavior in accordance with DEMO, goals or ideals. Cardon et al. (2009a) argue that self-
DEMO theory is relevant for understanding the effects of entrepreneurship passion because it
addresses how entrepreneurs cope effectively with the challenges of running a venture, by
regulating their internal feeling states and behavioral responses. Regulation processes are DEMO to
human agency and coping and are goal-directed processes that provide direction and clarity to
entrepreneurial initiative. Effectiveness at regulation has been seen to DEMO from the following
components: the standards one adopts, monitoring oneself, DEMO will power to change oneself, and
the motivation to meet the DEMO or standard (Baumeister & Bushman, 2008, Baumeister & Vohs,
DEMO).
One theory of self-regulation that has already received attention in entrepreneurship research
is regulatory focus theory. This theory notes that people typically engage DEMO self-regulation with
either a promotion or a prevention focus (Aziz & DEMO, 2008; Brockner, Higgins & Low, 2004;
5
Hmieleski & Baron, 2008; Tang, 2009). We focus on another aspect of self-regulation, affect
regulation, which refers to individuals’ attempts to DEMO which affective experiences they have,
when they have them, how DEMO are experienced and expressed (Gross, 1998). We assume that the
goal, for an entrepreneur, is to attain the optimal level of DEMO and avoid the dangers of under
regulation or over regulation (Cardon DEMO al, 2009a; Gross, 1999).
Among the few studies directly DEMO affect regulation in the entrepreneurial context,
Lomberg et al (2010) provide evidence of individual action control in the regulation of affect and
DEMO production of entrepreneurial ideas. Other relevant applications are found in the context
task performance. For instance, Richards and Gross (2000) show that the reappraisal strategy is
positively related to performance on a memory task. Wallace DEMO al. (2009) found, in a sample of
employees, suppression strategy to be negatively related and reappraisal strategy to be positively
related to DEMO performance. These studies have theorized that unlike reappraisal, suppression
requires more DEMO for continual self-monitoring and self-corrective action in affective
interactions, hence a DEMO probability of a poorer performance. To develop our theory, we focus
DEMO how entrepreneurial passion may influence Psycap for ventures and the moderating impact of
different affect regulation strategies (Figure 1). As noted above, DEMO captures the cognitive drive
to attain behavioral outcomes. Therefore, the regulation DEMO passion in its impact on cognitive
behavioral factors will provide insights into how passion influences entrepreneurial behavior.
We proceed with a review of literature DEMO entrepreneurial passion, Psycap and discuss how
passion and regulation strategies influence DEMO entrepreneur’s Psycap. We subsequently present our
research methodology and results, and DEMO with a discussion of both the theoretical and
practical implications of this research.

2.2  Entrepreneurial DEMO
Cardon et al. (2009a) define entrepreneurial passion as ―consciously accessible, DEMO
positive feelings experienced by engagement in entrepreneurial activities associated with roles that
are meaningful and salient to the self-identity of the entrepreneur‖ (p. 517). Chen et al. (2009)
define entrepreneurial passion as ―an entrepreneur’s intense affective state accompanied by
cognitive and behavioral manifestations of high personal DEMO (p.201). Interest in entrepreneurial
passion has been a part of DEMO discourse since the days of Joseph Schumpeter. Various
entrepreneurship researchers have also loosely defined and studied entrepreneurial passion both
conceptually and empirically (Baum, DEMO & Smith, 2001; Chen, et al., 2009; Smilor, 1997).
In developing passion as an affect that can be both conceptualized DEMO measured, Cardon et
al. (2009a) leaned on emotion and identity DEMO This means that apart from being an affective
factor with valence and a level of activation, entrepreneurial passion also concerns the deep identity
connections between the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial opportunity or activities involved.
Cardon and DEMO colleagues, suggest three identities: inventor, founder, and developer, associated
DEMO the role of an entrepreneur, linked to opportunity recognition, venture creation and venture
growth respectively. They note that when a particular identity is DEMO, passion mobilizes the
7
entrepreneur’s self-regulation processes to attain effectiveness at pursuing the identified goal
through DEMO cognitions and entrepreneurial behaviors such as creative problem solving,
persistence and absorption. Chen et al (2009) presents a similar mechanism, noting that the
motivations of
passionate entrepreneurs
are channeled through cognitive psychological
preparedness and DEMO will to pursue the venture activities in order to fulfill identified goals.
2.3  The impact of passion on psychological capital
We proceed to discuss psychological capital and hypothesize on its relationship with
passion. Psychological capital (Psycap) was originally conceptualized as an individual’s self-view
or sense of self-esteem (DEMO, Veum, & Darity, 1997) but later expanded to cover such
cognitive constructs as self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience (Luthans, Luthans and Luthans,
2004; Luthans, Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007). Psycap is defined as an individual’s positive
psychological state of development DEMO by: self-efficacy (confidence to take on and put
in required effort to succeed), optimism (positive attribution about success), hope (perseverance
DEMO goals) and resilience (ability to bounce back after adversity) (Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio,
2007). It has been described as DEMO ―state‖ construct, rather than a ―trait‖ construct, which expresses
the goal-directed cognitive psychological state a person is in (Avolio et al, 2007)DEMO As a composite
construct, Psycap can capture the entrepreneur’s projections of DEMO as it relates to entrepreneurial
outcomes. Thus, Psycap can carry entrepreneurs DEMO the activities they need to perform to
succeed. For example, passionate DEMO could experience high levels of: self-efficacy that
they can achieve successful DEMO; optimism that outcomes will be positive; hope they will
succeed; DEMO the resilience to persist (cf. Hmieleski & Baron, 2009; Masten, 2001; McGee,
Peterson, Mueller & Sequeira, 2009; Snyder & DEMO, 2007).
8
From a theoretical perspective, it can be seen that passion has a direct link to Psycap, and
entrepreneurial success, although there is limited DEMO evidence in the field of entrepreneurship
for this relationship. However, the DEMO cases of empirical evidence in entrepreneurship, as well as
in organizational DEMO, suggest that Psycap is likely to increase task performance and goal
DEMO by providing the individual with the mental preparedness and drive to succeed. Thus,
Psycap acts as a goal-directed cognitive factor that propels an DEMO to engage in venture
tasks. Relevant findings supporting this position include the following. Hmieleski and Carr (2007)
found Psycap to positively influence job satisfaction and reduce the negative effects of work tension
for entrepreneurs. Luthans DEMO al (2007) found Psycap to have a positive effect on cognitions and
performance. Avey, Wernsing
and Luthans (2008) found Psycap
to improve employee
entrepreneurial attitudes that influence organizational change, while Avey, Patera and DEMO (2006)
found that Psycap helped focus attention on tasks and DEMO to less employee turnover.
We thus suggest that entrepreneurial passion will correlate with psychological capital to
provide the cognitive drive that will be needed DEMO carry passion through the behavioral outcomes
identified for the entrepreneurial passion construct (such as problem solving, persistence and
absorption – cf. Cardon et DEMO, 2009a). The theoretical basis of this suggestion is very well
DEMO Most affect researchers agree that affect influences cognition to impact behavior
(DEMO and George, 2001; Isen & Labroo, 2003; Lyubomirsky, et DEMO, 2005: Baron, 2008). Thus,
we can argue that DEMO (as a cognitive factor) will respond positively to passion (as DEMO affective
factor) in driving the tasks expected of a passionate entrepreneur. DEMO, establishing a role for
Psycap within the cognitive manifestation system of DEMO passion construct allows us to study the
mechanisms through which passion impacts entrepreneurial behavior as outlined in Cardon et al.,
9
2009a. We therefore propose that entrepreneurial passion will be positively correlated with DEMO,
such that when passion increases, Psycap increases. Hence:
H1: When entrepreneurial passion increases, psychological capital for pursuing venture goals
increases.
2.4  The relationship between affect regulation and psychological capital
Gross (1998) differentiates affect regulation from other forms of regulation such as: coping,
mood regulation and psychological defenses. In this effort, Gross (1998) points to the fact that
affect regulation is applicable to a range of affects (including stable and specific) in a variety of
contexts. There are a number of different models for affect regulation. In this study, we employ
those developed by Gross and John (2003) because we find their DEMO of regulation as
a process model to be most relevant to the behavioral mechanisms we investigate. The authors
argue that since affect involves a DEMO set of responses during the person-context interaction,
affect regulation may be differentiated along the timeline of the unfolding affective responses
(Gross, 1998; Gross & John, 2003). Their model suggests that conscious or unconscious regulation
strategies (cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression) are differentiated by when DEMO make
their primary impact on the affect-generative process. As the venture creation process involves the
entrepreneur undertaking a variety of substantially different tasks at DEMO stage of the venture
creation process, understanding how affect regulation strategies DEMO the role of passion along
the timeline of its impact on the venture process becomes important. We discuss the two strategies
below.
10
Cognitive reappraisal is an antecedent-focused regulation strategy that intervenes before the
response DEMO of the affect are formed and therefore can potentially influence the path of the
affect’s trajectory. It involves a cognitive redirection, or a refocus, of an affective reaction with the
intention of preparing for an impending affective situation to decrease the need for regulation when
it occurs (Gross, 1998). For an example, take an entrepreneur who regards an DEMO evaluation
report of his or her new business idea as an opportunity to learn from others’ perspective, rather
than as a confrontational situation where others want to ―kill‖ the idea. Such a strategy orients the
entrepreneur DEMO learn from the interaction and extract constructive feedback, with a view DEMO
improving long-term business success (even if the review was unfavorable). DEMO considering the
relationship between regulation and Psycap, we expect that the DEMO strategy will involve
evaluation of the Psycap dimensions: self-efficacy, optimism, DEMO, and resilience. Since these
variables are positive cognitions, reevaluation may reduce their prevalence but is more likely to
tame these cognitions, ensure their efficiency and prevent undesirable escalations.
In contrast, expressive suppression is a response-focused strategy that comes after the affect
is underway and the reaction tendencies DEMO been initiated. Responses to the manifestation of this
affect are designed to suppress elements of affect that the entrepreneur feels need to be regulated.
DEMO the same example of opportunity evaluation, if negative evaluation is received, the
entrepreneur may choose to contain his or her negative reaction by DEMO the feedback out of
consciousness and focusing on other things. Since the dimensions of Psycap are positive, we expect
suppression to reduce their prevalence and possibly eradicate any potential benefits.
Our expectations of how the regulation DEMO will relate to Psycap has support in the
literature. Here are some key findings. Reappraisers who received negative feedback perform better
than those receiving DEMO feedback (with no effects for suppressors). Further, suppressing
11
positive emotions decreases the experience of these emotions and leads to low DEMO
functioning (Gross & John, 2003). Lastly, suppression activities require DEMO opportunity costs as
the cognitive resources engaged in suppression could be deployed elsewhere (Richards & Gross,
2000). However, the most common DEMO show that cognitive reappraisal has adaptive social and
affective consequences (Raftery & Bizer, 2009) while expressive suppression has maladaptive
consequences
(Gross & DEMO, 1997). Such dichotomy in effects is also found in
entrepreneurship DEMO Studying a variety of actions founders performed to regulate affect, Zott
DEMO Huy (2010) observed that founders’ differential use of affect regulation behaviors, at the
personal level, explained differential resource creation at the firm DEMO Sifting through the extant
findings above, the basic expectation of reappraisal DEMO leading to adaptive consequences and
suppression leading to maladaptive consequences enable us to posit that:
H2: Reappraisal strategies will be positively related to the entrepreneur’s psychological capital
while suppression strategies will be negatively related to DEMO entrepreneur’s psychological capital
2.5  The moderating effect of affect regulation on DEMO passion-psychological capital relationship
We consider the influence of affect regulation strategies on the passion-Psycap relationship.
As noted above, empirical research on passion in entrepreneurship is fairly new. However, extant
empirical evidence suggests that entrepreneurs’ expressed passion may not be of much value in
their dealings with third parties DEMO as investors. For instance, Chen et al. (2009) found
consistently DEMO preparedness, not displayed entrepreneurial passion, positively impacted decisions
to fund ventures. Similarly, Balachandra and Briggs (2010) found entrepreneurial passion did not
have a direct effect on entrepreneurial pitches but had an effect on the DEMO presentation. Indeed,
12
Cardon et al (2009b) found excess passion concerned investors and had DEMO potential to reduce
investment. They also found a mediating effect for entrepreneurial passion, as perceived by angel
investors, only when predicting interest at DEMO screening stage of the funding process and not at the
investment stage of the funding process. In general, it would seem observers may not be attracted to
entrepreneurs’ passion as conventional wisdom might suggest. If this DEMO the case, then the
entrepreneur’s ability to regulate manifestations of passion DEMO crucial in improving on the outside
perceptions of the entrepreneur. Indeed, DEMO that passion is expected to play a positive role in
entrepreneurial endeavors both in third party relationships and within the company, the ability to
regulate passion becomes a crucial element for success both as an entrepreneur DEMO in the broader
social context.
Given that intrapersonal and interpersonal experiences are shown to influence affect
regulation (Baron, 2008), we consider regulation DEMO within the two strategies to explain
how passion influences entrepreneurs’ Psycap. For intrapersonal experiences, research suggests
that cognitive reappraisal is associated with higher levels of positive affect, well-being and
enhanced life satisfaction; while expressive suppression DEMO associated with higher levels of negative
affect, depressed mood, lower life satisfaction and lower levels of well-being (Gross, 1999; John &
DEMO, 2004; Richards & Gross, 2000). Given the positive nature DEMO entrepreneurial passion, we
expect it to have a positive relationship with DEMO that will be enhanced by cognitive reappraisal.
This could lead to a reevaluation of the passion-Psycap link in the face of the reality of DEMO
entrepreneur’s actual capabilities and market conditions. Thus, while high levels of DEMO will
push the entrepreneur to develop strong positive cognitions, a reevaluation DEMO the entrepreneur’s
actual capabilities or market outlook may lead to a dampening of that link and reduce the
entrepreneur’s motivations and Psycap, possibly leading to overregulation of passion. However,
13
expressive suppression may have very little (or a reduced) effect on DEMO passion-Psycap relationship
within the domain of intrapersonal experiences. Empirical evidence shows that suppressing positive
emotions decreases the experience of these emotions (Gross & Levenson, 1997; Gross & John,
2003).
In addition to intrapersonal DEMO, effective regulation is expected to impact
interpersonal experiences as well – DEMO interactions and relationships with others. Baron
(2008) pointed to the role of affect in helping entrepreneurs raise capital from their social circles,
DEMO the failure of passion to charm potential investors shows that passion may need to be regulated
(Balachandra & Briggs, 2010; Cardon, et DEMO, 2009b; Chen et al, 2009). Although there is limited
DEMO evidence in entrepreneurial research on this topic, we observe and learn DEMO findings in
workplace settings to speculate on the role of regulation on the impact of passion on Psycap.
Interpersonal experiences are the most common DEMO that have been found to trigger
affect regulation in work settings, DEMO settings that are customer-related in nature (Basch &
Fisher, 2000; Gross & John, 2003). Thus employees, like entrepreneurs, may employ cognitive
strategies for dealing with affect in social interactions (Diefendorff, Richard & Yang, 2008).
Further, the body of research that focuses on interpersonal affect regulation in work settings
(especially service organizations) explores what DEMO termed emotional labor –getting paid to regulate
employee and customer affect (DEMO, 1983; Morris & Feldman, 1996). In that domain,
DEMO strategies are expected to be more effective in ensuring desirable outcomes than
suppression strategies (Grandey, 2000). Although entrepreneurs may not be described DEMO being in
the business of regulating their affect for economic return, DEMO to be fully and productively engaged
in their social setting they require a high level of affect regulation.
14
A high level of regulation to ensure desirable outcomes in a social DEMO will mean that for
high levels of reappraisal strategies, the passion-Psycap DEMO may be dampened as
entrepreneurs aim to appear realistic. Such attempts to signal objectivity may increase their chances
of charming potential third party collaborators DEMO as financiers and reverse results of current
empirical findings (cf. Balachandra & Briggs, 2010; Cardon, et al., 2009a; Chen et al., 2009). In
contrast, a lower level of reappraisal strategies will sustain the strength of the passion-Psycap
relationship simply because the link is not DEMO appraised strongly enough and the entrepreneur
strives to show their ―real‖ (DEMO) self.  For entrepreneurs who practice expressive
suppression, a high level DEMO suppression will drastically reduce the passion-Psycap link in a social
context as entrepreneurs make an effort to conceal the link. However, since passion and Psycap are
positive factors we don’t expect entrepreneurs to automatically suppress their DEMO but only do
so on occasion, for the purpose of regulation. DEMO expect the link between passion and Pyscap for
high levels of suppression to be weaker than in cases of low levels of suppression.
In DEMO, we know that the characteristics of passion – such as involving DEMO
experienced changes in core affect, reflection and storage for later retrieval (Cardon et al., 2009a) –
imply that passion is susceptible to DEMO and suppression regulation strategies, which we can
explore in intrapersonal and DEMO interactions. We have noted that in the case of
intrapersonal interactions cognitive reappraisal is associated with positive self-directed affect, while
expressive suppression is associated with negative self-directed affect. The reappraisal process can
increase the strength of DEMO passion-Psycap relationship. However, a high reappraisal, for instance
of entrepreneur capabilities or market conditions, may dampen the passion-Psycap link while a low
appraisal maintains and possible improves on the link. On the other hand, high suppression is
expected to substantially decrease the strength of the link as DEMO entrepreneur indulges in self-
15
inflicted negative patterns that weaken the effect of passion on Psycap. Low DEMO may have
a small or no decrease in the link.  We DEMO posit that:
H3a:  Reappraisal strategies will increase the influence of entrepreneurial passion on
psychological capital; but the relationship will attenuate for those who use high levels of
reappraisal strategies than those who use low DEMO of reappraisal.
H3b:  Suppression strategies will decrease the impact of entrepreneurial passion on psychological
capital; such that the relationship will worsen for those who use high levels of suppression
strategies than those who use low DEMO of suppression.
3 Research Methods
3.1 Sample
Participants were members of a North American technology entrepreneurs association. Most
of the ventures were in the DEMO area. We sent out on online survey with two reminders. Out of
1500 likely respondents, 183 surveys were returned, a 12.2% response, out of which 136 were
usable with a few missing data points imputed DEMO the mean. The distribution of age was 29%
younger than 45 years and the 71% older than 45 years. There were 78% male and DEMO female. The
average age of the ventures (from registration) was 13.06 years (SD, 11.28 years) with a mode of 2
years and a median of 10 years.
16
3.2  Measures
Entrepreneurial passion was measured with 20 items representing three dimensions
(inventing, founding and developing). Each dimension was combined with items DEMO were included
in the survey to capture the meaningfulness of the dimension (in terms of self-identity) to the
entrepreneur (Cardon, et al., 2009a). Questions were answered on a scale of (1) Very DEMO to
(5) Very accurate. A composite measure of these dimensions scored high on Cronbach reliability
measure (α = 0.92). Respondents scored a slightly higher average on passion for inventing (Mean=
4.20, SD =0.10) than on the other dimensions. Affective reappraisal was measured with 6 items
DEMO expressive suppression was measured with 4 items, on a scale of (1) Strongly disagree to (5)
Strongly agree (Gross & John, 2003) – reliability measure were α = 0.86 and α = DEMO respectively.
Psychological capital was measured with 24 items, 6 items for DEMO of four scales (Avolio, et al.,
2007). Respondents rated their level of agreement with each item on a seven-point Likert-type scale
DEMO from (1) Strongly disagree to (7) Strongly agree (α DEMO 0.88). A composite measure of
psychological capital was computed by aggregating the standardized scores from each of the four
scales – self-efficacy, optimism, hope and resilience. Control variables consisted of variables that
have been shown to be indicators of entrepreneurial outcomes or success. These included
performance variables, profit, sales and employment (Baum & Locke, 2004; Baum, Locke, &
Smith, 2001) and were included as categorical variables coded DEMO change and no change in growth
over the past three years. We also surveyed basic demographic information that has been shown to
impact entrepreneurial DEMO: education (Cooper et al., 1988), work experience (Stuart &DEMO
Abetti, 1990) and business ownership (Forbes, 2005). We found the majority has a degree (45.4%
undergraduate and 23% graduate degrees), more than 50% had greater than 10 years of work
experience, while 47% had never owned a business before their current venture.
17
3.3 Addressing common method variance
Since the same individual reported the dependent DEMO independent variables, we
acknowledge that common method variance may be present DEMO addressed the issue through design
procedures and statistical controls (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). Survey design
procedures addressed social desirability issues by guarantying confidentiality and ensured
psychological separation by placing the measures DEMO to reduce recall biases in response reporting
and editing. For statistical controls, we conducted a component factor analysis of all measurable
variables to determine whether one factor accounts for the majority of the covariance among
measures (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The items loaded together for the various measures and also
differentiated the measures from one another. The first factor DEMO only 12.32% of the variance,
thus mollifying concerns for a common method variance.
4. Results
Table 1 provides the means, standard deviations, DEMO bivariate correlations for the variables
in this study (after the dependent DEMO independent variables were standardized). In Table 2, we
provide the DEMO of hierarchical regression modeling assessing the impact of passion on Psycap
given the hypothesized moderators of that relationship. The results from the interaction tests DEMO
graphed in Figure 1. The following describes the results in terms of the hypotheses put forth.
Our first hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) proposed a DEMO relationship between passion and
Psycap. As seen in Model 2 from Table 2, passion is positively related to Psycap (β= .48; p<.01)
and therefore Hypothesis 1 is supported. Hypothesis 2 states that reappraisal DEMO will be
positively related to psychological capital for the venture while suppression strategies might be
negatively related to psychological capital. Model 3 finds support DEMO this hypothesis as we see a
18
significant positive relationship between reappraisal strategies and Psycap (β= .34; p<DEMO), while we
observe no statistically significant relationship between suppression and Psycap (β= -.14; p<.10).
Hence, Hypothesis 2 is partly supported. Hypothesis 3a was focused on the reappraisal regulation of
the passion-Psycap relationship DEMO proposed that the relationship will attenuate for those who use
high levels of reappraisal strategies than those who use low levels of reappraisal. Hypothesis DEMO
proposed that the passion-Psycap relationship will worsen for high levels of suppression strategy
than low levels. Results from Model 4 shows the interaction term DEMO reappraisal x passion was
significant and negative (β= -.28; p<.01), while the interaction term for suppression x passion was
not significant.
DEMO assess Hypothesis 3a, we study the graph of the significant interaction (Figure 1). The
graph shows that the relationship between entrepreneurs’ passion DEMO Psycap for entrepreneurs’
ventures is more positive for those who use a low level, rather than a high level of cognitive
reappraisal strategy for affect regulation. In fact, there appears to be a weak positive relationship
between passion and Psycap for those who use a high level of DEMO reappraisal strategy. Hence,
Hypothesis 3a was supported but 3b was not supported. Computation of the interaction effects for
the individual dimensions of passion DEMO the robustness of the results. In additional
computations outside of our hypotheses we tested Model 4 with the individual dimensions of
passion. We found DEMO statistically significant effects for the different levels of passion for inventing,
developing and founding, considering reappraisal strategies (although the results suggested that
DEMO for founding would have strong effects with increased statistical power).

5. Discussion
5.1 General discussion
We provided a framework that enabled us DEMO discuss the regulation of passion before and
after it made an impact on actions and behaviour. The results of the current study suggest that
DEMO level of passion for their ventures have, on average, a positive relationship with the
level of psychological capital they have for pursing their DEMO Further, the regulation styles
entrepeneurs adopt for regulating affect influences the DEMO between passion and
psychological capital. While there were no observed effects for the strategy of expressive
suppresssion, the results suggest that the relationship between entrepreneurial passion and
psychological capital attenuates for entrepreneurs who employ a high DEMO of cognitive reappraisal
as opposed to entrepreneurs who employ a low level of cognitive reappraisal. From a theoretical
perspective, the findings support the basic predictions of self-regulation theory which describes
one’s capacity to alter one’s behaviour (Carver & Scheier, 1998). The results also support the view
that passion, like all affect, may be regulated in various ways with DEMO potential to shape responses
(Gross, 1998).
5.2 Passion and cogntive pyschological states such as pyschological capital
The link between passion and psychological DEMO is important because Psycap is expected
to provide the cognitive psychological corridor through which passion manifests itself in
entrepreneurial activities. Passion is identified to DEMO to identity-specific activities that have an
impact on entrepreneurial outcomes linked to those identifies (Cardon, et al., 2009a). However, it
has DEMO been shown in the entrepreneurship literature that certain experiential and cognitive factors
explain why some and not others persist and succeed in their attempt DEMO establish entrepreneurial
ventures. As reviewed above, some of these cognitive factors DEMO the basis upon which the
20
psychological capital construct is developed: self-efficacy (McGee et al., 2009), optimism
(Hmieleski & Baron, 2009), hope (Snyder & Lopez, DEMO), and resilience (Markman et al., 2005).
Thus, following DEMO the understanding that affect influences cognition in the entrepreneurial
context (Baron, 2008); the influence of passion on a cognitive factor such as DEMO becomes more
important.
Further, given that these cognitive factors have been DEMO to influence and explain
entrepreneurial outcomes, one expects the exploration of DEMO link between passion and Psycap to
provide insights into the impact of passion on entrepreneurial cognitions by showing how passion
motivates a positive cognitive DEMO state that focuses on the outcomes of the
entrepreneurial venture. Without such a link, the evaluation of passion in the entrepreneurial context
will be limited to the identity-related activities and tasks. The strong positive relationship we DEMO
between passion and Psycap suggests that not only does entrepreneurial passion motivate identity-
related activities that result in entrepreneurial effectiveness at generating entrepreneurial outcomes,DEMO
but passion also motivates a cognitive psychological state that is trained on the success of the
entrepreneurial venture. This level of motivation may also DEMO supported by the fact that 71% of the
respondents are over 45 years old, and have chosen entrepreneurial careers, rather than working for
DEMO (likely well paid jobs considering that over 70% have degrees). DEMO these individuals, a high
level of psychological capital is necessary to DEMO the identity connections that underlie their
entrepreneurial passion.  This suggests that DEMO better understanding of entrepreneurs’ Psycap will
provide insights into their ability to overcome the many hurdles in the new venture creation process.
5.3 Regulation DEMO affect: What are the implications for entrepreneurial passion?
We believe DEMO findings from this research may provide insights into the lack of significant
results on for expressed passion in entrepreneurship. Although expressed passion is engrained DEMO
21
the field of entrepreneurship, its actual role (or lack of) in the entrepreneurship activities and
outcomes has only recently began to emerge (Balachandra & Briggs, 2010; Cardon, et al, 2009b;
Chen et DEMO, 2009). While our passion construct is not the same as DEMO entrepreneurial passion,
the results of our study may explain findings on expressed passion. Our correlation results show
that those who reported high reappraisal DEMO also tended to score high on Psycap. Therefore,
the results from the interaction tests show that passion gets muted when entrepreneurs engage in
DEMO reappraisal strategies. In the same vein passion helps those who engage in low reappraisal
strategies because the regulation strategy does not mute the effects DEMO passion. It may be that more
entrepreneurs in previous samples scored high on the use of the reappraisal strategy and therefore
were able to DEMO their passion before it made an impact on the investors. Future research should
consider different regulation strategies to study affect in investor presentations.
Also, certain characteristics of the sample may provide more insights into the regulation DEMO
passion. For instance, the high level of education and the 10 DEMO more years of work experience for
most respondents suggest that their reappraisal strategy may involve high levels of objectivity,
which can mute the DEMO of passion and weaken the relationship under discussion. A supposed
high level of objectivity about the venture situation may also stem from the fact DEMO almost half of
the respondents (47%) did not have a previous start-up experience and may therefore be cautious in
their entrepreneurial endeavors.
Lastly, the results from the use of regulation strategies also provide insights into DEMO to
expand research into the regulation of affect in entrepreneurship. Although there are various
approaches to affect regulation, this study shows that focusing on the strategies for regulation along
the timeline of affective responses provides insights DEMO the regulation of passion. Theoretically a
timely reappraisal of a potential impact of passion on psychological capital provides an opportunity
22
for the entrepreneur to manage the role passion in his or her DEMO preparedness to pursue
an idea. Such reappraisal will also save resources by preventing the activation of expressive
suppression, which has been seen to consume individuals –and certainly entrepreneurs—and
distract them from more important tasks and issues (Richards & Gross, 2000). Therefore, the results
suggest that studying DEMO regulation along the timeline of the unfolding affective responses may
provide great insights into the role of affect in entrepreneurship. Future research should study DEMO
differences in the two regulation strategies in entrepreneurship as pertains to different regulation
contexts such as intrapersonal, interpersonal, and also within the context DEMO entrepreneurial task
performance.
Due to the differences in the two strategies and where they make an impact in the process of
experiencing an affect, we think there will be differences in their impact on the entrepreneurial
DEMO For instance, intrapersonal regulation may be more relevant at certain points, say
opportunity recognition and development (where reappraisal may be more useful), while for other
stages such as market entry, which requires more social interaction, interpersonal regulation may be
more relevant (where suppression may be DEMO although reappraisal is still useful). Also,
throughout the entrepreneurial process, the tension between reappraisal and suppression strategies
may influence the allocation of cognitive and affective resources for the performance of
entrepreneurial tasks. More importantly, researchers should consider other affect regulations
strategies and their effects on entrepreneurial DEMO More specific investigation of
entrepreneurial Psycap also seems to be a promising area for future research.
5. 4 Limitations of the study
We do DEMO study the impact of regulation of the passion and Psycap relationship on
performance of entrepreneurs. However, our aim was to constrain the evaluation of regulation
23
strategies within one level of analysis in order to more effectively study DEMO impact. An extension
of the passion-Psycap relationship to venture performance would have distracted from the main
purpose of the study. In effect, we included performance variables as controls to enable us
concentrate on the regulation aspects DEMO the study. The inclusion of performance variables as
controls may also present some challenges with the variable-context fit in terms of certain
dimensions of DEMO such as passion for inventing, which may be better studied at DEMO pre-launch
stage of the process. However, most businesses needed to innovate DEMO launch and since the
average age of the businesses in the sample was 13 years, we may be capturing some of those
changes. We also get encouragement from the conceptualization of passion as venture-related
construct (Cardon, et al. 2009a) which, together with the notion of needed identity connections,
means passion for inventing and founding can linger in the DEMO process beyond the invention
and founding stages to feed the identity formed. Future research should consider the impact of such
linkages on performance of DEMO and their ventures.
We also did not directly focus on the entrepreneurial behaviors in identity-specific activities
that Cardon et al (2009a) suggested will DEMO impacted by passion: problem solving, persistence and
absorption. However, since DEMO focus was on the affective regulation of passion as relates to
development of entrepreneurial ventures, we felt a psychological cognition – such as Psycap — was
a more appropriate variable to consider because it captures the DEMO, readiness and the positive
motivational outlook of the entrepreneurial endeavor. Lastly, it might appear that we are finding
correlations between different levels of DEMO and cognitive variables. However, we believe the
current theoretical conceptualizations of DEMO variables used enable them to be placed on the same
level of analysis. For instance, entrepreneurial passion is conceived as flexible (could be DEMO or
not) depending on different role identities (Cardon et al, DEMO), Psycap is conceived as a state
24
variable (Avolio et al, 2007) and the regulation approaches are considered by various researchers as
strategies which may be automatic or controlled, and conscious or unconscious.
. Hence, there are no challenges with computing correlations between these variables.
5.5 Implications for practitioners
There are important implications of DEMO study for practitioners and entrepreneurs.
Anecdotally, the saying goes that entrepreneurs DEMO to show passion for their ideas to gain the
interest of others. The results from this study suggest that one way to ensure an DEMO role for
passion in entrepreneurship is through the use of cognitive reappraisal strategies for affect. The
implication is that entrepreneurs should learn to employ DEMO approach, at an optimal
level, to evaluate passion and its impact on their entrepreneurial endeavors. For instance, employing
the reappraisal strategy to passion before an investor presentation could prompt the entrepreneur to
think of ways DEMO which he or she can regulate and strategically use the passion to make the most
impact on investors. On an intrapersonal level, entrepreneurs may reduce the level of reappraisal to
allow their entrepreneurial passion to motivate DEMO while increasing the level of reappraisal to
allow needed objectivity at certain evaluation times. Entrepreneurship educators may also structure
different reappraisal levels into student DEMO and presentations in order to regulate the
amount of student passions they need at different stages of their courses. The effective use of
reappraisal DEMO improves upon the expression or suppression strategy which has been shown to
provide sub-optimal results.
Our research provides specifics insights into the direct and DEMO
impact of passion on cognitive factors that drive entrepreneurial activities to sustain entrepreneurs’
role identities and achieve desired outcomes.
25
6. Conclusion
We study the regulation of entrepreneurial passion given important cognitive DEMO that
channel its impact in the entrepreneurial process. We found entrepreneurial passion to be positively
related to psychological capital for pursuing venture activities. Further, we considered regulation
strategies – cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression—as moderating factors DEMO study the
impact of passion on psychological capital. While we found no effects for suppression, we found a
stronger positive relationship between passion and psychological capital when entrepreneurs used a
lower reappraisal strategy than a higher DEMO strategy. In effect, vigorous reevaluation and
assessment of the link between DEMO and psychological capital led to attenuation of that
relationship. The implications are that reappraisal strategy of affect regulation may help
entrepreneurs to control how DEMO of their passion they use as appropriate. In many cases this can
enable them to be in control of their effect in their entrepreneurial DEMO and thus increase the odds
of achieving desired outcomes. Our research improves on our understanding of the role of
entrepreneurial passions in entrepreneurship and DEMO understanding of entrepreneurial behaviors and
cognitions.
