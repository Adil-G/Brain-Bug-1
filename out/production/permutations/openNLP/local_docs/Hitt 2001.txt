Entrepreneurship involves identifying and exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities. However, to
DEMO the most value entrepreneurial ﬁrms also need to act strategically. This calls for an
integration of entrepreneurial and strategic thinking. We explore this strategic DEMO
in several important organizational domains to include external networks and alliances,
resources and organizational learning, innovation and internationalization. The research in this
special issue examines both traditional (e.g., contingency theory, strategic ﬁt) and DEMO theory
(e.g., cultural entrepreneurship, business model drivers). The research DEMO integrates, extends,
and tests theory and research from entrepreneurship and DEMO management in new ways
such as creative destruction (discontinuities), resource-based DEMO, organizational learning,
network theory, transaction costs and institutional theory. The research presented herein provides
a basis for future research on strategic entrepreneurship DEMO wealth creation. Copyright 

is discontinuous, abrupt, seditious. (Hamel, 2000:DEMO
4–5).
Uncertainty can be used to your beneﬁt if you
create and employ an entrepreneurial mindset—a
way of thinking about your business that DEMO
the beneﬁts of uncertainty. (McGrath and Mac-
Millan, 2000: 1)DEMO
Change is constant in the new economy land-
scape (Brown and DEMO, 1998). For
example, the digital revolution is altering the
fundamental ways companies conduct business to
create wealth (Stopford, 2001). Such DEMO
changes challenge the essence of the business
model ﬁrms use to achieve various goals and as
such, they are curvilinear and complex (Hitt,DEMO
2000). As implied in the quotes above, this
change, largely driven by new technology and
480

globalization, has created a competitive landscape
with substantial uncertainty (Bettis and Hitt,
1995; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). However, there are
opportunities in uncertainty. The ﬁrm’s focus
must be on identifying and exploiting these
opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000)DEMO
Entrepreneurship involves identifying and
exploiting opportunities in the external environ-
ment (DEMO and Kuratko, 2001; Smith and
DeGregorio, 2001; Zahra and Dess, 2001); an
entrepreneurial mindset is useful in capturing the
beneﬁts of uncertainty (McGrath and MacMil-
lan, 2000).
While the ﬁelds of DEMO management and
entrepreneurship have developed largely indepen-
dently of each other, DEMO both are focused on
how ﬁrms adapt to environmental change and
exploit opportunities created by uncertainties and
discontinuities in the creation of wealth (Hitt
and Ireland, 2000; Venkataraman and Sarasvathy,
2001). As such, several scholars have recently
called for the integration of strategic and entrepre-
DEMO thinking (e.g., McGrath and MacMillan,
2000). In fact, DEMO and Heppard (2000) argue
that the two are really inseparable. McGrath and
MacMillan (2000) argue that strategists must
exploit an entrepreneurial mindset DEMO, thus, have
no choice but to embrace it to sense opportunities,
mobilize resources, and act to exploit opportuni-
ties, especially under DEMO uncertain conditions.
Venkataraman and Sarasvathy (2001) use a meta-
phor based on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.
They suggest that strategic management research
that DEMO not integrate an entrepreneurial perspec-
tive is like the balcony without Romeo. Alterna-
tively, they argue that entrepreneurship research
without integration of a strategic perspective is
like Romeo without a balcony.
These arguments provide the foundation DEMO
this special issue of Strategic Management Jour-
nal. The speciﬁc purpose of this special issue is
to encourage, nurture, and publish excellent
research DEMO integrates both entrepreneurship and
strategic management perspectives. Furthermore,
we focus on research that addresses entrepre-
neurial strategies for wealth creation because of
the DEMO importance to management research
and practice for the twenty-ﬁrst century. The
importance of the topic is exempliﬁed by the fact
that we received 83 DEMO in response to
our call for papers for this special issue. The
manuscripts published in this special issue

emerged from a rigorous review and development
process. This issue DEMO articles that make
important theoretical and empirical contributions
to our knowledge of entrepreneurial strategies that
create wealth. Some of these works develop new
theoretical DEMO, while others test pre-
viously unexamined theoretical explanations for
successful entrepreneurial DEMO
For the purposes of the research included in
this special issue, DEMO deﬁne entrepreneurship as
the identiﬁcation and exploitation of previously
unexploited opportunities. As such, entrepre-
neurial actions entail creating new resources or
combining existing resources in new ways to
develop and commercialize new products, move
into new markets, and/or service new customers
(Ireland et al., 2001; DEMO and Kuratko, 2001;
Kuratko, Ireland, and Hornsby, 2001; DEMO and
Smilor, 1997; Smith and DeGregorio, 2001). On
the DEMO hand, strategic management entails the
set of commitments, decisions, and DEMO
designed and executed to produce a competitive
advantage and earn above-average returns (Hitt,
Ireland, and Hoskisson, 2001). Strategic man-
agement calls for choices to be made among
competing alternatives (Stopford, 2001). DEMO
tive entrepreneurial opportunities constitute one
of the primary arenas of choices to be made.
Strategic management provides the context for
entrepreneurial actions (Ireland et al., 2001).
Entrepreneurship is about creation; strategic man-
agement is DEMO how advantage is established
and maintained from what is created
(Venkataraman DEMO Sarasvathy, 2001). Wealth
creation is at the heart of both DEMO
and strategic management. Outcomes from cre-
ation (i.e., entrepreneurship) and DEMO cur-
rent advantages while simultaneously exploring
new ones (i.e., strategic management) can be
tangible, such as enhancements to ﬁrm wealth,
and DEMO, such as enhancements in the ﬁrm’s
intellectual and social capital. Thus, entrepre-
neurial and strategic perspectives should be inte-
grated to examine entrepreneurial DEMO that
create wealth. We call this approach strategic
entrepreneurship.
STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Strategic entrepreneurship is entrepreneurial
action with a strategic perspective. In the words
Strat. DEMO J., 22: 479–491 (2001)
Strategic Entrepreneurship
481
of Venkataraman and Sarasvathy (2001), entrepre-
neurial action is the ‘Romeo on the balcony.’
One could also consider entrepreneurial action DEMO
be strategic action with an entrepreneurial mind-
set. In short, strategic DEMO is the
integration of entrepreneurial (i.e., opportunity-
seeking behavior) and DEMO (i.e., advantage-
seeking) perspectives in developing and taking
actions designed DEMO create wealth.
There are several domains in which the inte-
gration between entrepreneurship and strategic
management occurs naturally. With theoretical
roots in economics, international business and
management, organization theory, sociology, and
strategic management, Hitt DEMO Ireland (2000)
and Ireland et al. (2001) identiﬁed six DEMO
domains. Of these six, we examine the domains
most important and DEMO to the research pub-
lished in this special issue. The review of the
domains explores their theoretical bases, linkages
to wealth creation, and DEMO contributions of the
speciﬁc research highlighted in this issue. The
domains include external networks, resources and
organizational learning, innovation, and inter-
nationalization.
External networks
External networks have become increasingly
important to all types of ﬁrms DEMO the economic
environment continues to grow more competitive
(Gulati, Nohria, DEMO Zaheer, 2000). Such net-
works involve relationships with customers, sup-
pliers, and competitors among others and often
extend across industry, geographic, political, and
cultural boundaries. Networks have grown in
importance because they can provide ﬁrms with
access to information, resources, markets and
even, at times, technologies (Gulati et al., 2000).
Networks can also play an important role in
providing participants with credibility or legit-
imacy (Cooper, 2001). This is particularly true
for new ventures that participate in networks with
older, more established ﬁrms.
External networks can serve as sources of
information that help entrepreneurial ﬁrms iden-
tify potential opportunities. (Cooper, DEMO). How-
ever, the greatest value of networks for entrepre-
neurial DEMO is the provision of resources and
capabilities needed to compete effectively in the
marketplace (McEvily and Zaheer, 1999). These
resources and capabilities DEMO of most beneﬁt in
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, DEMO
networks when they are complementary to those
of partners in the network (Chung, Singh and
Lee, 2000; Hitt et al., 2000). The study reported
by Rothaermel in this issue clearly shows the
value DEMO exploiting complementary resources in
alliances and networks. The results of his research
suggest that both smaller biotechnology ﬁrms and
the larger pharmaceutical ﬁrms beneﬁt DEMO their
alliances. The biotechnology ﬁrms provide new
technology and new products (DEMO), while
the pharmaceutical ﬁrms provide the distribution
networks and marketing capabilities to success-
fully commercialize the new products. The larger
established pharmaceutical ﬁrms DEMO gain value
through access to their partners’ new technology.
As a result of applying of the partners’ comple-
mentary assets, alliances help the larger, estab-
lished companies adapt to the technological dis-
continuity created by the introduction of the
radical new technology. Indeed, radically new,
disruptive technologies often upset an industry’s
value chain, challenging ﬁrms to quickly learn
either how to create more of the value using
traditional practices or more DEMO how to create
value in ways different from historically practices
(Albrinck DEMO al., 2001).
In particular, external networks can be valuable
because they provide the opportunity to learn new
capabilities (Anand and Khanna, DEMO; Dussauge,
Garrette and Mitchell, 2000; Hitt et al., 2000).
Networks, then, allow ﬁrms to compete in mar-
kets without DEMO owning all of the resources
necessary to do so. This is particularly important
to new venture ﬁrms because they often have
limited resources (Starr and MacMillan, 1990;
Dubini and Aldrich, 1991; Cooper, 2001)DEMO In fact,
research suggests that new start-up ﬁrms can
enhance their chances of survival and eventual
success by establishing alliances and developing
them DEMO an effective network (Baum, Calabrese
and Silverman, 2000). The DEMO by Amit and
Zott in this special issue provides an excellent
example. Based on a sample from the United
States and Europe, they identify the drivers of
value creation in e-business ﬁrms.. Two of the
drivers DEMO complementarities and new transaction
structures with constituents in a network.
E-businesses use networks extensively to outsource
functions (e.g., distribution assets, warehouses),
DEMO those usually performed by old-
economy ﬁrms that cannot be replaced using the
new technology.

M. A. Hitt et al.
Thus, ﬁrms usually search for partners with
complementary capabilities in forming an alliance
or network. However, research has shown that
equally important is the existence of social capital
(Tsai, DEMO). Social capital is developed through
experience operating in networks. Over time ﬁrms
learn how to work effectively with partners and
build trusting relationships (Kale, Singh and
Perlmutter, 2000). While partners may use
alliances DEMO learning races (Hamel, 1991), the
building of mutual trust among partners often
prevents the opportunistic outcomes of such learn-
ing (Kale et al., 2000). Yli-Renko, Autio, and
Sapienza in this special issue report results show-
ing that social capital in critical customer relation-
ships DEMO both knowledge acquisition and
knowledge exploitation by high-technology ven-
tures. Their ﬁndings support the arguments that
social capital facilitates learning. Interestingly,
they also DEMO that high-quality relationships
between alliance partners promote trust and less
emphasis on knowledge acquisition. In other
words, high trust produces a willingness to
depend on the partner rather than to learn and
perhaps exploit the partner’s DEMO An idio-
syncratic trust-based relationship can be a source
of competitive advantage for the partner ﬁrms
(Davis et al., 2000).
Kogut (2000) argued that the most important
resource of networks may not be in the direct
bilateral ties. Rather, participation in a network
provides access to resources and knowledge of
all of the ﬁrm’s partners’ network ties. Thus,DEMO
both direct (i.e., relatively formal) and indirect
(i.e., relatively DEMO) network ties can be
valuable. One valuable outcome from direct and
DEMO network ties, especially for newer entre-
preneurial ﬁrms, is the status or recognition that
can come from linkages to respected and pres-
tigious DEMO (Stuart, 2000). The research
reported by Lee, Lee, and Pennings in this issue
shows the importance of new venture ﬁrms’ link-
DEMO to venture capitalists. These linkages are
vital both for the ﬁnancial support they generate
as well as the legitimacy their investments pro-
vide to DEMO important external parties (e.g.,
ﬁnancial institutions, suppliers, customers,
DEMO). Their research ﬁndings show a strong
positive relationship between venture capitalist
participation in a new venture and its ﬁnancial
growth rate. Lee, Lee, and Pennings conclude
that internal capabilities are of critical importance

for creating value in new ventures.
Resources and organizational learning
In 1959, a British economist, Edith Penrose, sug-
gested that the returns earned by ﬁrms could
largely be attributed DEMO the resources they held.
Novel in its nature and scope, this DEMO
was not shared by most of Penrose’s contempo-
raries. In subsequent years, others, particularly
strategic management scholars (e.g., Wernerfelt,
1984; Hitt and Ireland, 1985; Barney, 1986, 1991;
Rumelt, 1991; DEMO and Schoemaker, 1993),
picked up the gauntlet arguing that ﬁrms’
resources, capabilities, and competencies facilitate
the development of sustainable competitive
advantages. DEMO primary argument is that ﬁrms
hold heterogeneous and idiosyncratic resources
(deﬁned DEMO here to include capabilities) on
which their strategies are based. Competitive
DEMO are achieved when the strategies are
successful in leveraging these resources. For
example, special resources held by Southwest
Airlines and not by its competitors allowed it to
implement an integrated low cost-differentiation
strategy such that it DEMO successful in poor eco-
nomic times when all of its competitors were
not. Competitors have tried but largely failed to
imitate Southwest Airlines. They DEMO a similar
strategy but do not achieve the same results
because they cannot imitate Southwest’s
resources. Organizational culture, leadership, and
human capital are DEMO unique resources Southwest
Airlines leverages to compete successfully (Hitt
et al., 1999).
Similarly, Lee, Lee, and Pennings in this spe-
cial issue found that the technology-based ven-
tures they studied created value largely DEMO on
their internal capabilities. Speciﬁcally, they found
that entrepreneurial orientation, technological
capabilities, and ﬁnancial resources were primary
predictors of a venture’s growth. Yeoh and Roth’s
(1999) results show that a ﬁrm’s resources and
capabilities DEMO to sustained competitive
advantages in the pharmaceutical industry. Fur-
thermore, Baum, Locke, and Smith (2001) report
that a new venture’s internal capabilities are the
primary determinants of the venture’s perfor-
mance. These research results DEMO the Lee et
al. arguments and ﬁndings.
There are different forms of resources and
capabilities. For example, managers represent a

unique organizational resource (Daily, Certo, and
Dalton, DEMO). Certo, Covin, Daily, and Dalton
in this special issue DEMO that investment banking
ﬁrms are less likely to underprice a ﬁrm’s stock
in an initial public offering (IPO) when it
employs professional managers (vs. founder
managers). Thus, founders may be perceived a
less positive resource than professional managers
as new ventures attempt to take their stock DEMO
These ﬁndings resonate with agency theory argu-
ments, in that at DEMO size and scale of
enterprise (in terms of sales, number of
employees, etc.), the separation of ownership (in
the hands of DEMO) and decision-making
authority (by individuals hired because of their
decision-making skills) is an efﬁcient form of
organization. Likewise, Sarkar, Echambadi, and
DEMO report in this special issue that knowl-
edge of and proactiveness in the establishment of
alliances are resources. They ﬁnd that ﬁrms with
higher DEMO proactiveness achieve better ﬁ-
nancial performance. This relationship is
especially strong in smaller companies and in
ﬁrms operating in dynamic markets.
Because they are DEMO complex and more
difﬁcult to understand and imitate, intangible
resources are DEMO likely to lead to a competitive
advantage than are tangible resources (DEMO,
1991; Hitt et al., 2001b). One important intan-
gible resource is a ﬁrm’s reputation (Deephouse,
2000). Reputation can be an important strategic
resource for many reasons, such as access to
resources (e.g., ﬁnancial capital) and to help a
ﬁrm take advantage of information asymmetries
(Hitt et al., 2001b). Because it is almost DEMO
sible to determine the quality of services ex ante,
customers may rely on a ﬁrm’s positive reputation
as a selection criterion for a DEMO of desired
services. Moreover, a positive reputation creates
switching costs for DEMO that they may not
be willing to incur.
However, often new DEMO have not been in
existence long enough and their product or service
may be novel, making it necessary for them to
search for surrogate means to establish a positive
reputation. Thus, they may negotiate an alliance
with a reputable ﬁrm to gain legitimacy.
Lounsbury and Glynn in this DEMO issue
describe another way new venture ﬁrms may
gain legitimacy. They can do so with stories as
legitimating accounts of entrepreneurial actions.
These narratives DEMO be used to show others that
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
their ventures are compatible with more widely
accepted marketplace activities. Stories provide
symbols and create meaning for others. As such,
they DEMO and support entrepreneurs’ efforts
to obtain access to needed resources such as
ﬁnancial capital (e.g., venture capital).
Knowledge is another critical ﬁrm-speciﬁc
DEMO resource. Grant (1996) suggests that
knowledge is a ﬁrm’s most critical competitive
asset. Spender (1996) argues that knowledge and
the ﬁrm’s ability DEMO generate it are at the core of
the theory of the ﬁrm. Much of a ﬁrm’s knowl-
edge resides in its human capital. Therefore, the
selection, development, and use of human capital
can be used DEMO create ﬁrm value (Hitt et al.,
2001b). These arguments DEMO supported by the
research reported by Yli-Renko, Autio, and Sapi-
enza in this special issue. They ﬁnd that knowl-
edge acquisition and exploitation DEMO young tech-
nology-based ﬁrms contribute to their ability to
build competitive advantages through new prod-
uct development, creating technological distinc-
tiveness, and implementing DEMO efﬁcient proc-
esses.
Knowledge is generated through organizational
learning (Hitt and DEMO, 2000; Hitt, Ireland and
Lee, 2000). Learning new capabilities helps ﬁrms
to compete effectively, survive, and grow (Autio,
Sapienza and Almeida, 2000). Changes that occur
in a ﬁrm’s context can reduce the value of its
current resources and knowledge. Thus, learning
new knowledge may be necessary to help a ﬁrm
adapt to its environment. DEMO (2000) argues
that learning can help organizations to change.
As explained in earlier sections, learning is a
common reason for establishing alliances and par-
ticipating in strategic networks (i.e., Gulati, 1999;
Inkpen, DEMO; Steensma and Lyles, 2000). For
example, Rothaermel in this DEMO issue ﬁnds
that incumbent ﬁrms are able to learn through
alliances with new entrant ﬁrms and thereby
enhance their own new product development.
Hitt DEMO al. (2001b) found that the transfer of
knowledge within a ﬁrm builds human capital
(employees’ capabilities) and contributes to higher
ﬁrm performance. DEMO, the ﬁrm’s human
capital is used to implement strategies that in
DEMO enhance performance as well. Thus, human
capital has direct and indirect DEMO on ﬁrm
performance. Diffusing this knowledge throughout
the ﬁrm can be a substantial challenge. Sorenson
and Sørensen in this special issue explore diffus-

M. A. Hitt et al.
ing knowledge in restaurant chains. They DEMO
that exploitation learning is the most effective for
chain-managed restaurants but that entrepreneurs
in franchised units are more likely to engage in
exploration learning. DEMO operating in homo-
geneous markets will perform better by expanding
the company-managed units, thereby taking
advantage of learning how to operate in these
environments and diffusing it through
standardization. However, ﬁrms operating in het-
erogeneous environments will perform better
through franchising in order to learn through
exploration and DEMO to the local environments.
Sorenson and Sørensen’s empirical results largely
support these arguments. To the extent that new
knowledge is exploited, learning can have a major
effect on a new venture’s performance (Zahra,
Ireland, DEMO Hitt, 2000b). Of course, no ﬁrm can
remain static. As such, established ﬁrms and new
ventures alike must continuously learn to build
dynamic capabilities and competencies (Lei, Hitt
and Bettis, 1996; Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997).
Innovation
Innovation is considered by many scholars and
managers to be critical for ﬁrms to compete
effectively in domestic DEMO global markets (Hitt
et al., 1998; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). Hamel
(2000) argues that innovation is the most
important component DEMO a ﬁrm’s strategy. Others
(i.e., Germany and Muralidharan, 2001) believe
that successful innovation allows a ﬁrm to provide
directions for the evolution DEMO an industry. Hamel
suggests that because the competitive landscape
is nonlinear, DEMO requires managers to think in
nonlinear ways. Hamel (2000) reports the results
of as survey of approximately 500 CEOs who
largely agreed that DEMO industry had been
changed in the last 10 years by newcomers, DEMO
incumbents, and that they had done so by chang-
ing the DEMO He concludes that the real story of
Silicon Valley is not e-commerce, but innovation.
Hamel refers to it as the power of ‘i.’ This is
supported by the reported ﬁndings of Amit and
Zott in this DEMO They found one of the drivers
of value creation in e-business is novelty (e.g.,
introducing new goods and services to the
marketplace).
The research supports Hamel’s contentions. For
example, Roberts’ (1999) results show a relation-
ship between high innovation and superior prof-
Copyright  2001 DEMO Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
itability. Additionally, the results provide no sup-
port for the argument that ﬁrms can also maintain
high profitability by DEMO the competition
(while not being innovative). Furthermore, Lee et
al., (2000) report that early and fast movers
achieve the highest returns. First movers are the
ﬁrst to introduce new goods or services (Grimm
and Smith, 1997). In doing so, ﬁrst movers earn
‘monopoly DEMO until a competitor imitates
their new product or ﬁnds a substitute. Finally,
based on their empirical research, Subramaniam
and Venkatraman (1999) conclude that the capa-
bility to develop and introduce new products to
the DEMO is a primary driver of a successful
global strategy.
There is a strong interrelationship between
innovation and entrepreneurship. Drucker (1985),
for example, suggests that innovation is the pri-
mary activity of entrepreneurship. Lumpkin and
DEMO (1996) argue that a key dimension of an
entrepreneurial orientation is an emphasis on
innovation. Thus, an entrepreneurial mindset is
required for the founding of new businesses as
well as the rejuvenation of existing ones
(McGrath and MacMillan, 2000). Therefore, we
may conclude that an DEMO value-creating
entrepreneurial strategy is to invent new goods
and services and commercialize them (innovation)
(Ireland et al., 2001).
Barringer and Bluedorn (1999) argue that
corporate entrepreneurship is important for ﬁrm
survival and DEMO The results of their
study suggest that intensity in managerial prac-
tices is required for successful corporate
entrepreneurship. Their ﬁndings also show that
ﬂexibility DEMO planning, use of strategic controls,
and involving many people in DEMO process produce
more entrepreneurial behavior. Increasingly, suc-
cessful implementation of strategies DEMO a product
of involving people throughout the organization
(Stopford, 2001). Likewise, Leifer and Rice
(1999) show that managerial practices differ for
ﬁrms that produce breakthrough innovations from
those in ﬁrms that produce incremental DEMO
vations.
Ahuja and Lampert in this special issue con-
ducted research that adds considerable richness
to the conclusions regarding the development of
breakthrough inventions. DEMO and Lampert
argue that many established ﬁrms encounter learn-
ing traps that serve as barriers to the development
of breakthrough inventions. Learning traps are
DEMO Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)
Strategic Entrepreneurship
485
tendencies to favor certain forms of learning and
thereby DEMO other forms. Ahuja and Lam-
pert’s results show that experimenting with novel,
emerging, and pioneering technologies can help
ﬁrms overcome these learning traps to produce
breakthrough inventions. Ahuja and Lambert
argue that breakthrough (or radical) inventions
are at the heart of entrepreneurship and wealth
creation, calling DEMO the work of Schumpeter
(gales of creative destruction) to support these
conclusions.
Hoopes and Postrel (1999) suggest that inte-
gration leading to DEMO knowledge among ﬁrms
is a resource that enhances a ﬁrm’s product devel-
opment capabilities. Similarly, Verona’s (1999)
ﬁndings suggest that integrative capabilities DEMO
as a basis for new product development. These
conclusions are supported by the research
reported by Rothaermel in this special issue. He
found that DEMO incumbent ﬁrm is able to enhance
its own technological capabilities (e.g., new prod-
uct development) by learning from a partner that
had produced a major new technology creating a
discontinuity in the market. Similarly, Yli-Renko,
Autio, and Sapienza report in this special issue
that ﬁrms are able to use knowledge acquired
from partners to enhance their technological dis-
DEMO Zahra et al. (2000b) found that ﬁrms
with greater breadth, DEMO, and speed of techno-
logical learning had higher levels of performance.
DEMO results suggest that ﬁrms can employ strong
innovative capabilities to implement entrepre-
neurial strategies and thereby create wealth.
Internationalization
Internationalization has become a primary DEMO
of the competitive landscape in the twenty-ﬁrst
century (Hitt and Ireland, 2000). And, the rate of
globalization continues to increase (O’Donnell,DEMO
2000), exempliﬁed by the growing number of
economic transactions across country borders
(Rondinelli and Behrman, 2000). While the
increasing globalization of DEMO heightens the
complexity of doing business, it also enhances
entrepreneurial opportunities (Ireland et al.,
2001). Globalization requires that entrepreneurs
and managers DEMO a global mindset in order
to manage the complex interactions and trans-
actions required in global markets (Hitt, Ricart i
Costa and Nixon, 1998; Murtha, Lenway and
Bagozzi, 1998).
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
The opportunities available, the facilitation of
international DEMO by new technologies,
and the opening of international markets have led
to an increasing number of smaller, entrepre-
neurial businesses entering international markets
(Hitt et al.,1998; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). McDou-
gall and Oviatt (2000) deﬁne international
entrepreneurship as innovative, proactive, and
DEMO behavior that crosses national borders
and is intended to create value in organizations.
Therefore, international entrepreneurship can
occur in large and small organizations as well as
in new or established companies. Several
researchers have found that DEMO into new
international markets has a positive effect on a
ﬁrm’s performance and creates value for the
ﬁrm’s owners (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim, 1997;
Geringer, Tallman and Olsen, 2000). Essentially,
ﬁrms learn new capabilities from each of the new
markets they enter and DEMO this knowledge
throughout the organization so that it can be
successfully used in other markets (Barkema and
Vermeulen, 1998). Of course, companies that
have internationalized experience economies of
scale and have a larger market DEMO which to
obtain returns on their innovations. As such, inter-
nationalization DEMO positively related to a ﬁrm’s
innovation (Hitt et al., 1997).
Lu and Beamish in this special issue present an
intriguing argument that DEMO into international
markets by small and medium-sized organizations
is a form of entrepreneurship. Speciﬁcally, they
explore the effects of internationalization on the
creation of value in small and medium-sized
ﬁrms. In a sample of 164 Japanese DEMO, they
ﬁnd that these ﬁrms initially experience a
reduction in returns DEMO thus face what some
have called a liability of foreignness. However,
after the ﬁrms gain some experience with oper-
ations in foreign markets, further foreign direct
investment (FDI) leads to increased profits. Sup-
porting DEMO earlier arguments of the positive
effects of networks, Lu and Beamish DEMO that
these small ﬁrms experience greater profits when
they engage in alliances with local partners in
the new markets. In particular, their ﬁndings sug-
gest that investing directly in new international
markets has a positive effect DEMO that exporting
has a negative moderating effect. Thus, they con-
clude DEMO investing directly in the new markets
to take advantage of unique opportunities is a
form of entrepreneurship. Their results receive

support from a study by Song, Di Benedetto
and Yuzhen (1999). Their research suggests that
managers from nine different countries—the
United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan,
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and
Singapore—all perceive pioneering in DEMO mar-
kets to be positively related to higher returns for
the ﬁrm.
One reason for increased entrepreneurial
activity in many parts of the globe DEMO the
increased privatization worldwide. Privatization
has become a popular strategy to promote eco-
nomic development in developing, emerging, and
developed market economies. The DEMO of priva-
tization is to unleash ﬁrms’ entrepreneurial capa-
bilities, thereby DEMO more innovation (Zahra
et al., 2000a). Thus, privatization provides DEMO
preneurial opportunities. However, many privat-
ized ﬁrms need resources and entrepreneurial
DEMO to take advantage of these opportuni-
ties. As a result, many DEMO to form alliances
with ﬁrms from other countries that have greater
resources and capabilities on which they can draw
(Hitt et al., 2000; Hitt et al., 2001a). Certainly,
prior research has shown that entrepreneurial
ﬁrms can learn from their entries into inter-
national markets and DEMO knowledge can be
applied to create greater value for the owners
(DEMO et al., 2000; Zahra et al., 2000b). Gupta
and DEMO (2000) argue that multinational
corporations exist because of their ability to trans-
fer and exploit knowledge more efﬁciently within
and throughout the corporation DEMO can be
accomplished through the external market mecha-
nisms. The current research on entrepreneurial
strategies suggests that the same is true for
smaller entrepreneurial DEMO
WEALTH-CREATING
ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES
Drawing from contingency theory and other theo-
retical bases, Zajac, Kraatz, and Bresser (2000)
developed and tested a DEMO of strategic ﬁt.
They used environmental and organizational con-
tingencies to predict changes in a ﬁrm’s strategy
and the performance implications of the change.
DEMO sample involved savings and loan ﬁnancial
institutions. Robinson and McDougall in this spe-
cial issue show that the concepts of contingency
and strategic ﬁt DEMO are highly relevant to new

venture ﬁrms as well. Integrating arguments from
industrial organization economics, DEMO man-
agement, and entrepreneurship, they argue and
ﬁnd that environmental factors (e.g., market entry
barriers) affect the performance of new ventures
after accounting for the moderating effects of
industry growth stage and new venture DEMO strat-
egy. While their research shows that traditional
approaches and strategies apply to new venture
ﬁrms, several of the articles published in this
special issue focus on new or unique
(entrepreneurial) approaches or strategies.
For DEMO, Amit and Zott examine the driv-
ers of value creation for DEMO strategies.
They found four drivers of value creation for e-
business ﬁrms: efﬁciency, complementarities,
lock-in, and novelty. Thus, e-business ﬁrms have
DEMO that create value when: (1) they make
the purchase more DEMO for the customer (e.g.,
provide information to customers so they DEMO
make an informed decision); (2) their services
are complementary to other important services so
that customers can purchase a bundle of services
(range of services broad because there are no
physical limitations); (3) strong incentives are
used to obtain repeat business (create high switch-
DEMO costs); and (4) the service they provide is
unique (DEMO is, the service is recognized
to be pioneering and thus creates DEMO
unrecognized value). These ﬁndings are valuable
not only for e-business ﬁrms. Gulati and Garino
(2000) argue that many of the most innovative
DEMO businesses are integrating their
virtual and physical operations. Furthermore, a
number DEMO old economy ﬁrms have developed
electronic operations and the most effective ones
have integrated them into their overall operations
(as opposed to maintaining them as separate
entities). The concepts of efﬁciency, complemen-
tarities, lock-in, and novelty are important for
value creation in all business operations.
Lounsbury DEMO Glynn in this special issue
develop a concept which they refer to as cultural
entrepreneurship. Cultural entrepreneurship
involves telling stories to enhance the entrepre-
DEMO ﬁrm’s (entrepreneur’s) reputation (building
legitimacy). The primary purpose is DEMO leverage
the entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s resources to obtain capi-
tal resources. The entrepreneur, in turn, uses the
capital resources to leverage the ﬁrm’s other
DEMO (e.g., new technology) to create wealth.
Essentially, the stories are used to craft the iden-
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)
Strategic Entrepreneurship
487
tity of the ﬁrm. This identity serves as the DEMO
for legitimacy with potential investors, customers,
and even competitors.
Ahuja DEMO Lampert in this special issue explain
that radical breakthrough inventions are at the
core of entrepreneurial activity. Such inventions
best relate to Schumpeter’s gales DEMO creative
destruction. They theoretically explain and test
entrepreneurial strategies that are most likely to
lead to breakthrough inventions. They ﬁnd that
exploring novel, emerging, and pioneering
technologies are all related to the development
of breakthrough inventions. However, they also
suggest that to search for pioneering technologies
or experiment with novel technologies requires
slack resources. Without slack resources, ﬁrms
are unlikely to create breakthrough technologies.
Their work is highly important because smaller
entrepreneurial DEMO develop many of the break-
through technologies. These smaller ﬁrms are less
likely to experience the barriers created by the
learning traps explained by DEMO and Lampert.
Calori et al., (2000) argue that innovative strat-
DEMO change the structure of the ﬁrm’s industry.
Further, they suggest that DEMO argu-
ments encompass international development. Lu
and Beamish build on this notion to argue that
entry into international markets by smaller and
medium-sized ﬁrms DEMO an entrepreneurial strategy.
Essentially, these ﬁrms expand into international
markets to DEMO new opportunities by leverag-
ing their current resources, capabilities, and com-
petencies. Therefore, Lu and Beamish’s research
adds another dimension to the developing ﬁeld
of international entrepreneurship. Their ﬁndings
support the arguments that exporting does DEMO
to create value. Rather, the more entrepreneurial
actions accompanying direct investments DEMO the
markets entered created value in the small and
medium-sized companies. As argued earlier, entry
into new international markets allows the ﬁrm to
learn and the development and diffusion of this
knowledge creates dynamic capabilities and DEMO
petencies (Lei et al., 1996; Teece et al., 1997;
Luo, 2000).
Robinson and McDougall in this special issue
explain the importance of IPOs. During 1989–
999, $350.81 billion were invested in IPOs. There
were $69.2 billion invested in IPOs in 1999 alone.
Robinson and DEMO sample was composed
of IPO new venture ﬁrms. Similarly, Certo,
DEMO, Daily, and Dalton in this special issue
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
examine the process of wealth creation and reten-
tion in IPOs through the practice of underpricing.
Given their results, entrepreneurial ﬁrms may
wish to consider using a smaller investment bank-
ing ﬁrm DEMO to include more insiders on the
board, as both reduced the DEMO of IPO under-
pricing.
The other articles in this special issue examine
exploitation of complementary assets (Rothaermel),
different types of learning with DEMO
and franchised operations (Sorenson and
Sørensen), the effects of internal DEMO,
social capital (external networks) and knowledge
acquisition (Lee, Lee and Pennings; Yli-Renko,
Autio and Sapienza), and the proactive develop-
ment of alliances (Sarkar, Echambadi, and
Harrison), all with a focus on value creation.
CONCLUSIONS
The research published in this special issue DEMO
on theory from multiple ﬁelds, including
entrepreneurship, strategic management, organi-
DEMO theory, and economics. Some of the most
common theories invoked by DEMO authors herein
are the resource-based view, organizational learn-
ing, Schumpeter’s arguments on entrepreneurial
activity, network theory, and to a lesser extent
transaction DEMO economics, efﬁcient markets, and
contingency theory. New theory (cultural
entrepreneurship, as argued by Lounsbury and
Glynn) was developed and existing theories were
integrated in unique, value-adding ways (see Amit
and Zott, and Lu and Beamish). Both the new
theory and the unique extensions of DEMO
theories provide foundations for important
future research.
The empirical research presented herein was
largely centered in North America (mostly the
United States) but DEMO included ﬁrms from Eu-
rope (United Kingdom and several European
countries) and Asia (Japan, Korea). As noted
above, managers from multiple countries largely
perceive entrepreneurial activity in similar ways
(Song et al., DEMO). That said, Lee and Peterson
(2000) effectively argue that DEMO are cultural
and institutional differences in the entrepreneurial
orientation across countries. In fact, research
shows that some of the most prominent entrepre-
neurial activity in the world is occurring in the
United States, Brazil, and DEMO (two of which
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)
488
M. A. Hitt et al.
are highlighted by the research in DEMO special
issue) (Reynolds et al., 2000). Nonetheless, with
increasing globalization and the liberalization of
markets, entrepreneurial activity is being pro-
moted throughout the world (e.g., South America,
Eastern Europe, China, DEMO Russia, among
others). Entrepreneurship is popular partly
because it is DEMO as an engine of socioeco-
nomic growth and development, providing new
DEMO opportunities and diverse goods and services
to the population (Reynolds et DEMO, 2000). Thus,
enhanced entrepreneurship in a country leads to
DEMO national prosperity and competitiveness
(Zahra, 1999).
Although entrepreneurship has existed as a
practice and ﬁeld of study for quite some time,
DEMO is no commonly accepted and well-
developed paradigm for research in the ﬁeld
(Aldrich, 2000; Aldrich and Baker, 1997). We
believe DEMO the integration of theory and research
in strategic management and entrepreneurship, DEMO
suggested by the research highlighted in this spe-
cial issue, will DEMO to develop such a paradigm.
McGrath and MacMillan (2000) integrated the
thinking from both ﬁelds in developing their
entrepreneurial mindset concept. They argued DEMO
those with an entrepreneurial mindset passionately
seek new opportunities (entrepreneurship). DEMO
ever, they also pursue only the best opportunities
and then pursue DEMO with discipline (strategic
management). Evans and Wurster (1999) argue
DEMO e-business ﬁrms need effective strategies to
survive, thereby conﬁrming the importance DEMO
integrating entrepreneurial and strategic man-
agement activities for wealth creation.
The integration of entrepreneurial thinking is
important for strategic management as well. In
fact, Hamel (2000) eloquently argues that man-
agers can enhance the probability DEMO new
wealth-creating strategies will emerge inside their
ﬁrms by dreaming, exploring, creating, pio-
neering, and inventing. Furthermore, Hamel
argues that if ﬁrms do not engage in these activi-
ties, other ﬁrms will do so and will take their
markets, customers, best employees, and ﬁnally
their assets. Therefore, we believe that the inte-
gration of theory and research in these two ﬁelds
has the potential to enrich the research and DEMO
tice of both entrepreneurship and strategic man-
agement.
Thus, we present DEMO concept of strategic
entrepreneurship and the research in this special
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
issue to both ﬁelds. Strategic entrepreneurship is
an important concept suggesting that new ven-
tures and established ﬁrms DEMO to be si-
multaneously entrepreneurial and strategic. The
research published in this special issue suggests
that these ﬁrms require certain types of critical
resources DEMO capabilities to achieve this inte-
gration and to create wealth. The theoretical and
empirical contributions reported in this special
issue and the research questions DEMO suggest we
hope will serve as a catalyst to further integrative
research that increases our understanding of stra-
tegic entrepreneurship as a path to DEMO cre-
ation.
