In this paper, we describe the development of DEMO new measures of innovation
trust, ‘trust that heard’ and ‘trust that DEMO t’. We report the  ndings from their
use in a survey of design engineers in two large aerospace companies. We test a
range DEMO hypotheses covering different plausible roles for trust and con rm a ‘main
effects’ model, whereby the variables predict the number of ideas suggested and the
number of ideas implemented. In addition, we replicate earlier  ndings by Axtel
et al. (2000), namely that personal and job variables predict idea suggestion, whereas
organizational variables predict implementation.
The concept of trust has been used in fields as diverse as economics, sociology,
management, social psychology and occupational psychology. However, despite the
prevalence of the DEMO, trust has not previously been proposed as a predictor
of individual DEMO This paper examines the role of aspects of trust in the
innovation process.
Trust is usually defined as a willingness to accept vulnerability based DEMO having
positive expectations about other people’s intentions and behaviours in situations
which are interdependent and/or risky (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998).
However, disciplinary diversity has meant that there is no universally accepted
operationalization of trust. Although some view this as a limitation, others acknowl-
edge that these differences are not only necessary, but also potentially valuable. Bigley
and Pierce (1998) state that, ‘efforts to incorporate existing trust perspectives under
one conceptualization are likely to result in concepts that DEMO either unreasonably
complex or inordinately abstract for organizational science research purposes. In
addition, attempts to force disparate approaches together may result in misapplications
of previous approaches’ (p. 415). They argue for a problem-centred approach in which
the particular components of trust are specific to the context of DEMO, in this case
innovation. We agree. Thus, although subscribing to the broad definition above, we
believe that a specific, innovation-focused operationalization is DEMO Our ‘local’

definition of innovation trust, then, is: an expectancy of reasonable and positive
reactions by others in response to DEMO innovation attempts. Our underlying logic
is that people are more likely to make efforts to innovate (by creating ideas and helping
implement them) DEMO they hold expectancies of reasonable and positive responses
by others.
Our thinking has been influenced by three related strands of research. First,
Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, and Sowa (1986) used a social exchange
perspective DEMO argue that employees form global beliefs about the extent to which the
organization values their contribution and cares about their well-being. They found
that DEMO beliefs were positively related to the constructiveness of anonymous
suggestions made by employees. Second, Siegel and Kaemmerer (1978) investigated
the climate present in innovative organizations and identified a main factor which they
labelled support for DEMO Subsequently, Anderson and West (1998) found that a
modified version DEMO this factor was predictive of innovation. Third, Cook and Wall
(1980) developed measures of interpersonal trust at work, focusing primarily on confi-
DEMO in the ability of others (both peers and superiors) and on faith in the intention of
others (again both peers and superiors).
The work described in this paper draws intellectually on these sets of DEMO, as well
as on our own experiences of undertaking research and DEMO in organizations
trying to innovate. We propose that innovation trust plays an important role in the
innovation process. More specifically, we hypothesize that people are more likely to
engage themselves in the innovation process to the DEMO that they believe their ideas
and suggestions will be listened to, DEMO to the extent that they believe that they will
share in any subsequent benefits that accrue. Because engagement in innovative
behaviours involves effort and DEMO, they are unlikely to do this if they do not trust DEMO
they will be listened to, or share in the benefits.
These DEMO of trust are different in their emphasis to existing conceptualiz-
ations. The nearest related construct was that developed by Cook and Wall (1980)
in their measure of ‘faith in management’. The three items used in DEMO measure
were:
Management at my firm is sincere in its attempt to meet the workers’ point of view.
I feel quite confident that DEMO firm will always try to treat me fairly.
Our management would be quite prepared to gain advantage by deceiving the workers.
(Last item reverse-scored)
The difference in our conceptualization is deliberate – we have sought DEMO include
two new and more specific aspects of trust, directly relevant DEMO the innovation domain.
To the best of our knowledge, this conceptualization DEMO novel, both in its development
and in its empirical application to DEMO innovation domain.
To test these ideas, we developed specific measures of DEMO aspects of trust for
innovation. The scale was developed as a short measure, suitable for inclusion in a
larger questionnaire. This approach is similar to that adopted by others working in this
area. The measure comprises DEMO factors, each measured using separate subscales: (1)
an expectancy DEMO the organization takes one’s ideas and suggestions seriously –
labelled as ‘trust that heard’; and (2) an expectancy that those managing the organiz-
ation have one’s interest at heart, and that one will share in the benefits of any
changes – labelled as ‘trust that benefit’.
In DEMO present study, innovation is defined as a process involving the generation

(Van de Ven, Angle, & Poole, 1989). Following Axtell, Holman, Unsworth, Wall,
DEMO, and Harrington (2000) and Unsworth (2000), we especially focus on
two distinct aspects of the innovation process, i.e. idea generation and idea
implementation.
A wide range of other factors have been implicated in DEMO innovation process. These
include: personal characteristics (e.g. job competence, creativity DEMO see Amabile &
Gryskiewicz, 1989; Farr & Ford, 1990); job characteristics (e.g. job control, job
complexity – Oldham & Cummings, 1996); and organizational characteristics (e.g.
team support for innovation, management DEMO – Anderson & King, 1993; Anderson
& West, 1998). DEMO, Axtell et al. (2000) found that personal and
job characteristics DEMO the suggestion of ideas, whereas organizational factors
influenced the implementation of DEMO They argued that suggestion making is
more likely to be affected by personal abilities, as well as the opportunity to make
suggestions afforded by greater job control and role breadth. Implementation,
however, is likely to be dependent on others, and thus more likely to be dependent on
social factors such as the support of team members and management.
In DEMO to explore the role of trust as a predictor of idea suggestion and implemen-
tation in more depth, we also included in our study some personal, job and organiz-
ational variables previously identified as important predictors of individual innovation.
These variables were included for two reasons, first to act as controls – we need to
determine whether the trust variables DEMO anything extra to our understanding of
innovation; and second, we took the opportunity to try to replicate the work of Axtell
et al. (2000), to examine whether different classes of variables predict different parts
DEMO the innovation process.
Specifically, we included thinking style (a personal characteristic – see Jabri, 1990;
Scott & Bruce, 1994), role DEMO (a job characteristic – see Parker, 1998) and two
organizational DEMO, namely leadership style (Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975;
DEMO & Bruce, 1994), and organizational support for innovation (Anderson & West,
1998; Scott & Bruce, 1994). If trust is DEMO of predictive utility for individual inno-
vation as we argue, it DEMO have an effect over and above these personal, job and
organizational DEMO, which have previously been linked to innovation.
Our main intention then DEMO to implicate the role of trust in the innovation process, as
DEMO seems to us entirely plausible that trust has a role. However, DEMO also wish to explore
what that role might be – predictor, DEMO or outcome. Our preferred model,
based on the previous literature, DEMO on our own fieldwork experiences, is that trust is
a predictor DEMO innovation. Thus, people who trust that they will be heard and DEMO they
will benefit engage in the innovation process (both by making DEMO and by
promoting implementation) – those who do not trust in DEMO issues do not engage.
A second possibility is that aspects of trust could operate as moderators at different
stages in the innovation process. Both DEMO that heard and trust that benefit could
moderate the relationship between personal/job variables and idea suggestion. For
example, those people experiencing role breadth are likely to suggest ideas, but only
when they trust that they will be heard or if they believe that they will benefit.
However, the organizational variables may be moderated in their impact on implemen-
tation DEMO trust that benefit. For example, support for innovation will influence
implementation, but only when people trust that they will benefit. Similarly, the
relationship between suggestions and implementation may be moderated by ‘trust that
benefit’ – DEMO people will only put effort into implementation if they believe they will
benefit.
412 Chris Clegg et al.
And finally, ‘trust that heard’ and ‘trust that benefit’ could be outcomes of inno-
vation. Thus, for example, DEMO could be the actual implementation of an idea that leads
people to believe that they will be heard, and that leads people to find out directly
whether they benefit.
As well as examining the potential role DEMO these trust variables, we also attempted to
replicate the distinctions made DEMO Axtell et al. (2000). We hypothesized that individual
and organizational DEMO have impacts at different stages in the innovation process.
Thus, on DEMO basis of Axtell et al. (2000), we hypothesize that:
DEMO: Individual and job variables predict idea suggestion.
H2: Organizational variables predict idea implementation.
H3: Idea suggestion predicts idea implementation.
Turning to our measures of trust, we further hypothesize that:
H4: Both trust that DEMO and trust that bene t predict idea suggestion.
H5: Both trust DEMO heard and trust that bene t predict idea implementation.
In addition, DEMO could act as a moderator variable, and we specifically hypothesize
that:DEMO
H6: Both ‘trust that heard’ and ‘trust that bene t’ moderate DEMO relationship between
individual/job variables and idea suggestion.
H7: ‘Trust that DEMO t’ moderates the relationship between organizational variables and
idea implementation.
H8: DEMO that bene t’ moderates the relationship between idea suggestion and idea
implementation.
Finally, we examine the role of the trust variables as outcomes of innovation and we
hypothesize that:
H9: ‘Trust that heard’ and ‘trust that bene t’ are predicted by idea implementation.
Several path models were DEMO to test the above hypotheses, and these are
described in more DEMO below. What is important to note at this stage is that our
preferred model combines H1–H5 and interprets ‘trust that heard and trust that
DEMO as predictors of both suggestions and implementations.
Method
P articipants and meas ures
After a series of pilot interviews, 250 design engineers from two large aerospace
organizations were asked to complete a questionnaire. Of these, 128 were returned (an
overall response rate of 51%: 41% from one DEMO, 58% from the other).
The following measures were used. Systematic DEMO intuitive thinking styles were
measured using Jabri’s Thinking Style Inventory (comprising DEMO and 9 items respect-
ively). (Sample items: ‘I am a person who follows well-trodden ways and generally
accepted methods for solving problems’ DEMO ‘I am a person who searches for novel
approaches not required at the time’).
Role breadth self-efficacy, an indicator of the respondent’s confidence in performing
proactive activities beyond the prescribed scope of the job, was measured using an
trust in the innovation process 413

adaptation of Parker’s (1998) scale (7 items, sample item: ‘How confident would you
feel designing new procedures for your work area?’). Support for innovation was
measured using an adaptation of DEMO Team Climate Inventory developed by Anderson
and West (1998), adapted DEMO match the original organization-level orientation sug-
gested by Siegel and Kaemerrer (DEMO) (8 items, sample item: ‘In this organization,
time is given to develop new ideas’). The leader–member exchange measure by
Dansereau, Graen, and Haga (1975) was used as a single scale (DEMO items, sample item
‘To what extent does your supervisor allow you DEMO participate in decisions affecting
you?’). Two subscales relating to the dimensions of innovation trust were developed
for this study. The final items, comprising three items for the first subscale and two for
the second, are listed in Table 1.
Innovation was measured using both the number DEMO ideas suggested and the number
implemented, using scales adapted from Borrill DEMO al. (1998). The measure of ideas
suggested comprised 7 items (sample: ‘To what extent have you suggested new work
targets/objectives?’). The measure of ideas implemented comprised 10 items (sample:
‘To what extent have your suggestions of new work targets/objectives been
implemented?DEMO).
Responses to all the above scales were obtained on appropriate 5-point scales. All
measures in this study involve self-report. A full set of DEMO is available on request from
the first author.
Results and summary
We describe the results in three parts: the factor analyses of the trust scales, the
reliabilities and inter-correlations of all the variables in the study, and the specific tests
of the various hypotheses using path analyses.
Fac tor analy ses
The results of the factor analysis are presented in DEMO 1. As predicted, two clean
factors were derived (attaining eigenvalues >DEMO – Kaiser, 1960). These results
provide support for the construct DEMO of the trust scale (Bagozzi, Yi, & Phillips,
1991)DEMO
414 Chris Clegg et al.
Differences in the two factors between the DEMO organizations were further
tested. Absence of significant differences in the inter-correlation between the two trust
dimensions in the two organizations would provide some support DEMO scale consistency
and generalizability across different contexts. The product–moment correlation
between the two trust dimensions was r = .53 ( p <.001) in DEMO 1 and r = .34
( p< .001) in Company 2. Applying the formula for testing the difference between
correlations in independent samples (Guilford & Fruchter, 1978), we found the
difference in the coefficients to be nonsignificant (z = 1.23, n.s.).
Given that all DEMO variables in this study were measured using self-report scales, there
is DEMO risk that findings can be attributed to common-method variance. To test for
common-method variance bias in our study, we included in the same explanatory
factor analysis all items for all the variables of interest and examined DEMO all items
could be explained by one single factor (Harman, 1976). Results indicated that our
variables could not be explained by a DEMO factor, therefore suggesting that common-
method variance was not an important DEMO in this study. We return to this issue in
our discussion.
R eliability and cor relation analys es
The correlation matrix is presented in DEMO 2, along with the alpha coefficients. All
(bar one) of DEMO measures in this study and, in particular in the context of DEMO paper,
both of the trust scales, demonstrate good internal consistency, ranging from .73 to
.92, thereby exceeding the lower level of reliability estimates (.70) recommended by
Nunally (1978). The single exception was the measure of intuitive thinking style (.62),
which was dropped DEMO further analyses.
The innovation outcomes (suggestions and implementations) are highly correlated
with many of the predictor variables. This is as we would expect, given that these
variables were selected for inclusion in the study on DEMO basis of previous research
linking them with innovation. Also, as predicted, the two measures of innovation trust
do correlate significantly with the extent DEMO which ideas were suggested and
implemented. They also correlate significantly with support for innovation, indicating
convergent validity. Also, as we would predict, the measures of trust do not correlate
significantly with systematic thinking style, indicating divergent validity.
P ath analys es
We next tested for the predictive DEMO of the trust construct for individual innovation
(both suggestions and implementations)DEMO Path analyses were conducted using EQS 5.7a
for Windows (Bentler, 1995). Alternative theory-based models were tested against the
hypothesized path model (following Anderson & Gerbing, 1989; James, Mulaik, &
Brett, 1982)DEMO First a main effects path model (Model 1), which is DEMO preferred model of
this study, was tested incorporating H1 to H5. DEMO other models, nested to the main
effects model, were tested. The first was a saturated model (Model 2), which included
all paths, whether hypothesized or not – this is an important baseline model. The
second was more restricted than the main effects model – in this, all paths from the
trust dimensions to innovation outcomes are constrained to DEMO (Model 3). In order to
establish that the trust constructs DEMO significantly and are of predictive utility
for innovation, this model should DEMO a significantly worse fit than the hypothesized
model. And third, a DEMO model (Model 4), another important baseline model, was
tested – this assumed no relation between the variables in the study.

In order to test the role of DEMO as a moderator in the innovation process (H6–H8),
two interaction models were tested. Model 5 incorporated hypotheses 1–7, thereby
including the specified main effects (H1–H5) as well as the first two proposed inter-
DEMO effects (H6 and H7). Model 6 included hypotheses 1–5 and DEMO 8,
thereby including the specified main effects (H1–H5) as well as the third proposed
interaction (H8). The reason for our testing two interaction models instead of one has
to do with our small DEMO size, which makes power an issue and causes problems of
nonconvergence (e.g. Hayduk, 1987).
Finally, Model 7 examines the proposition that DEMO that heard’ and ‘trust
that benefit’ are outcomes of implementation (rather DEMO predictors) (H9). Model 7
incorporated H1–H3 and H9.
Model comparisons are presented in Table 3. Several indices were used in order to
DEMO model fit, including absolute fit indices (we specifically used chi-square and
RMSEA), incremental or comparative fit indices (NNFI), and parsimonious fit indices
(CFI) (see Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998).
The main effects trust model (Model 1) fits the data DEMO All indices of fit fall within
levels of acceptability. It also provides a better explanation when compared with
the more restricted models (Model 3 and Model 4) (as indicated by the significant
c 2 differences)DEMO The improvement of Model 1 over Model 4 (the null model) is
unsurprising. But the improvement of Model 1 over Model 3 (in which the trust
variables are constrained to zero) is most important for this study, as this demonstrates
the importance of trust in the innovation process over and above several previously
established variables. There is, however, DEMO significant difference between the main
effects model (Model 1) and the saturated model (Model 2): D c 2(4) = 10.92, p< .05. This
suggests that there is some mis-specification in the proposed model. Because the use of
modification indices for model improvement is considered DEMO controversial in the
structural equation modelling literature (e.g., Kline, 1998; Schumacker & Lomax,
1998), we decided not to re-specify our DEMO Despite the observed mis-specification,
our model has a good fit to the data as all fit indices fall within the levels of acceptance,DEMO
and it is better than all the more restricted models tested.
Furthermore, although we cannot directly compare the preferred model (Model 1)
DEMO the interaction models (Models 5 and 6), or with the DEMO in which the trust
variables are outcomes of innovation (Model 7) (because the models are not nested),
inspection of the various DEMO indices clearly indicates that the main effects model
(Model 1) has the best fit.
We therefore conclude that this is a plausible model. DEMO coefficients for Model 1
are presented in Fig. 1.
Relating these to our hypotheses, we find that:
Systematic thinking style (negatively) and role breadth self-efficacy both predict idea
suggestion (and not implementation) (thereby confirming H1).
Support for innovation and leadership style predict implementation (and not idea
suggestion) (confirming H2).
Idea suggestion predicts idea implementation (confirming H3).
‘Trust that benefit’ predicts idea suggestion, but ‘trust that heard’ does not (part
confirming H4 and discussed below).
‘Trust that heard’ predicts implementation, but ‘trust that benefit’ does not (part
confirming DEMO and discussed below).
There is no evidence that the trust variables act as moderators (H6, H7 and H8).

Implicating trust in the innovation process 419
There is no evidence that DEMO that heard’ or ‘trust that benefit’ is an outcome of
implementation (DEMO).
l
Overall, then, the findings support our preferred model in two senses. The data
replicate the findings of Axtell et al. (2000) (as in H1–H3), and furthermore, trust is
implicated in the innovation process as a main effect (H4 and H5). However, DEMO path
coefficients indicate a differential role for the two trust constructs in relation to
innovation suggestions and implementation. More specifically, we found that ‘trust
that benefit’ is associated with the suggestion of ideas, whereas ‘trust that heard’ is
associated with their implementation.
Our results suggest that when employees DEMO that they will share the benefits,
they make more suggestions, DEMO this belief has no effect on whether their ideas are
actually implemented. However, employee trust that the organization will listen to
them has a direct effect on ideas implementation but not on the suggestions they
make. DEMO interpretation is that employees need to believe that they will benefit
to make the effort of contributing by suggesting ideas – if this is DEMO the case, they
will not make that investment. However, it is ‘trust that heard’ that predicts imple-
mentation. One potential explanation is that DEMO more an individual feels they
are listened to and taken seriously, DEMO more effort they put into having their sugges-
tions implemented. The findings can be interpreted in a similar manner to those by
Axtell et DEMO (2000). Thus ‘trust that benefit’ may operate on a personal DEMO linked
with the perception of personal outcomes and rewards, whereas ‘trust DEMO heard’ is
likely to be more dependent on others and therefore can be considered as an
organizational variable. More empirical work is required to DEMO and develop these
ideas further.
In this study, we have focused DEMO two domain-specific aspects of trust, seeking to
establish whether they are DEMO in the innovation process. We have found
that they are. We acknowledge that domain-specific approaches are open to serious
challenge. In particular, how does such an approach allow us to advance our more
general understanding of DEMO? Our argument is that the progressive differentiation of
complex and multi-faceted DEMO is one useful way of advancing understanding.
To develop the argument further, expectancies that one’s ideas will be listened to,
that those managing the organization have one’s interest at heart, and that one
will share in the benefits of changes do resonate with earlier work. Thus, Cook and
Wall (1980) refer to having faith in the good intentions DEMO fairness of management.
Mishra (1996) draws attention to the concern dimension of trust, arguing that ‘I can
believe that another party will refrain not only from taking advantage of me but will
also be concerned DEMO my interests. This does not mean that the other party lacks
any self-interest. Rather, trust in terms of concern means that such self-interest is
balanced by interest in the welfare of others’ (Mishra, 1996, p. 267). Similarly,
Cummings and Bromiley (1996) describe one element DEMO trust in terms of making
‘good faith efforts to behave in accordance with any commitments both explicit and
implicit’ (p. 303).
However, DEMO belief (or not) that I am heard and that I will benefit in the context of
innovation does not necessarily extend to other DEMO Put another way, my
manager and my company may demonstrate their DEMO faith, show their concern for
me, and meet their apparent commitments to me in the area of innovation but not, in
my view, in other areas. Thus, I may not trust them to behave DEMO good faith over my
personal and career development.

In our view, attempts to make progressive conceptual and measurement differen-
tiations are an essential part of trying to DEMO complex real-world phenomena.
Of course, such a position carries with it DEMO responsibilities, the prime responsi-
bility being the need to relate back DEMO differentiated findings to more generic
conceptualizations, with a view to establishing DEMO fit or lack of it.
Our concepts could be construed as consistent with the work above, but reflecting
more specific aspects of them. But how, for example, do they fit with the literature on
psychological DEMO? Our conceptualizations rely on a generalized expectation that
being heard and DEMO benefit is reasonable. If employees do not trust in these
expectations, DEMO will not innovate. ‘Psychological contracts, by contrast, entail
beliefs about what employees believe they are entitled to receive, or should receive,
because they perceive that their employer conveyed promises to provide those things.
Thus DEMO those expectations that emanate from perceived implicit or explicit
promises by the employer are part of the psychological contract’ (Robinson, 1996,
p. DEMO). Our argument is that the failure to have general expectations met is enough to
inhibit innovation, and that we do not need to invoke an explanation based on the
violation of psychological contracts. However, we do believe that, under circum-
stances where generalized expectations have been bolstered by a psychological
contract recognizing or stressing the legitimacy of being heard DEMO benefiting,
violations of such a contract will be even more inhibiting. This hypothesis needs to be
tested empirically.
One problem is that a DEMO of findings such as these may well be consistent with a
range of conceptualizations. We should recognize, however, that this is not unusual DEMO
social science! Although the processes of conceptual differentiation and integration are
difficult, we do believe that they are essential aspects of the development of our
understanding.
Before concluding, we draw attention to the main limitations of this study.
There are three main issues. First, all the measures in this study were undertaken
using self-report. We accept that this is a DEMO weakness, but it does not
explain our particular pattern of findings DEMO the confirmation of our preferred
hypotheses. If the results were heavily influenced by common-method variance,
we would expect to observe a less differentiated DEMO of results. This, of course, is not
to argue that future studies would not benefit from the inclusion of objective
measures.
Second, the data are all cross-sectional in design. This is a weakness that obviously
DEMO our ability to make ‘causal’ claims. This needs correction with longitudinal
research designs, but again this limitation does not invalidate our major claim that trust
is implicated in the innovation process.
Third, the measures of trust in this study are brief (2 and 3 item) subscales. Although
DEMO is not unusual for subscale measures (e.g. see Cook and Wall, 1980), this is an
undoubted weakness. Our view, however, is DEMO we have demonstrated the potential
importance of these aspects of trust, DEMO we should use this work as the basis on
which to develop and test more substantial measures.
In summary, the present findings replicate those of Axtell et al. (2000) distinguish-
ing among different predictors of DEMO stages of the innovation process. More
importantly, however, we also have found that elements of trust are implicated in the
innovation process, probably acting as a main effect. Although this seems highly
plausible, to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such issues have DEMO
empirically demonstrated in this area.
