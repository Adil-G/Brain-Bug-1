The common perception of universities DEMO merely institutions of higher
EXECUTIVE learning is giving way to one where universities are viewed as engines of
S~Y economic growth and development. This DEMO documents the entrepreneur-
ial activities of the faculty of the University of Calgary, as well as the
impact the University has had and the impact its recent budgetary problems
might have on such activities. Results indicate DEMO nearly 100 new ventures
with at least one fuU-time employee were started by faculty or were started as a consequence of significant
faculty inputs. DEMO ventures, in tam, have generated at least 723 new jobs in Alberta. Furthermore,
our projections suggest that faculty entrepreneurs will create approximately DEMO ventures per year in
the near future. Implications for the role universities and governments should play to encourage faculty
entrepreneurship are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Universities-particularly those that concentrate upon research-are DEMO well-
spring of the high-innovation economy. These are the major "natural DEMO"
in an economy that is based on constant innovation .... Local government
officials with long time horizons, interested in developing their areas structurally
rather than simply attracting relocations and trying to prevent moves, might
consider that efforts spent in lobbying state legislature to pour funds into local
DEMO could be rewarding .... Think of it in these terms and you will see
why the technologically based university is to the waning years DEMO the 20th century
what the Mississippi River was to exporters of grain in America's midwest in
the mid-19th century, the Mesabi Range to the steel industry in the late 19th
century, and the oil fields to Texas in the early 20th century-namely a priceless
resource (Birch 1987, pp. 140-142).
As suggested by David Birch in the previous quotation, university research has become
increasingly important in the technology driven economy of the 1990s. Universities are still
in the education business, of course, DEMO this mission continues to be of critical importance.
However, universities also DEMO substantial contributions to local economies through research
leading to patentable inventions and discoveries, faculty spin-off ventures, and technology
transfers. This has not been DEMO on government policy-makers who are beginning to see
science as a vehicle for energizing national and regional economies (Louis et al. 1989) and
DEMO asking universities to lend resources, faculty time, and talent to economic development
efforts with increasing frequency (Smith, Drabenstott, and Gibson 1987). At the same time,
recent declines in government funding for research DEMO other activities have caused universi-
ties to become much more interested in fostering such efforts (Brown 1984; Smith, Drabens-
tott, and Gibson DEMO).
As a consequence, universities and other institutions of higher learning DEMO attempted
to enhance their role in the economic development of their regions through increased participa-
tion in equity arrangements to commercialize faculty research. Although DEMO activities are
important, academic entrepreneurship-the creation of new business ventures by DEMO
professors, technicians, or students-is increasingly being promoted as a mechanism for
facilitating efficient university-industry technology transfer (Doutriaux 1987). Castro,
McMullan, DEMO Vesper (1987) suggest that interest in the business generating potential of
universities is caused by the enormous success that a few of these DEMO have had. Examples
include Hewlett-Packard from Stanford, Tracor from the University DEMO Texas, Digital Equip-
ment from MIT, and Medtronic Inc. from the University of Minnesota. Although at the
present time success stories such as DEMO are rare, as the importance of technological develop-
ment increases and DEMO begin to assert their role in advancing the frontiers of technol-
ogy more forcefully, efforts to duplicate these successes are likely to increase. McMullan
and Melnyk (1988) suggest that the economic development potential of academic DEMO
neurship has not been fully exploited anywhere in the world.
The University of Calgary is no exception to this trend. Whereas the University has
DEMO to more actively assert its influence on the economy of the Province of Alberta
through faculty entrepreneurship and technology transfer activities, its potential for enhancing
economic development has not been fully realized. Furthermore, recent cuts in government
funding threaten to reduce its potential contributions to the economic health DEMO the Province
of Alberta. Thus, the experiences in economic development of DEMO University of Calgary
provide an interesting and informative case study.
FACULTY ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 269
The purpose of this article is DEMO document the economic development activities underway
at the University of Calgary and to discuss the implications of its policies in fostering such
efforts. Furthermore, because the University faces a funding problem common to most public
universities DEMO North America, we shall also consider the effects reduced funding levels DEMO
have on these efforts in the future. To do so, this DEMO discusses the results of a study
undertaken during the summer of 1994 that was designed to obtain information on the eco-
nomic development activities DEMO the faculty with specific emphasis on new venture creation.
It is hoped that this information and its implications will be of value to university DEMO
and government officials in making policy decisions on the proper role of universities in
regional economies.
THE STUDY
To determine the extent and impact DEMO entrepreneurial activities of the faculty of the University
of Calgary, a DEMO data collection procedure was employed. Details about the proce-
dures used for data collection, validation, and analysis are described next.
Data Collection
Faculty DEMO A questionnaire was sent to all 1335 members of the faculty. The
questionnaire sought to identify faculty who had started or planned to start DEMO business or
not-for-profit organization. We also tried to identify instances where faculty research or
consulting led or substantially contributed to venture creation by entrepreneurs DEMO the
University. For the purpose of measurement, these occurrences were defined DEMO instances
where the venture would not have been started or would have only been started with significant
delays or difficulties, without interventions by members of the faculty. The questionnaire
was also designed to measure the impact DEMO the University of Calgary's policies and procedures
and government budget cuts on the ability of faculty to undertake entrepreneurial activities.
A follow-up mailing DEMO the questionnaire was sent to the five Faculties-Engineering,
Environmental Design, DEMO, Medicine, and Sciences-that experience and previous
research suggested would be most likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities (Castro,
McMullan, and Vesper, 1987). A total of 367 usable responses were received from the DEMO
mailings, representing a 27.5% response rate.
Comparisons were made between responses DEMO the first and second mailings of the
questionnaire for the five targeted Faculties listed previously. Respondents to the first and
second mailings were compared DEMO the number of organizations in which they started or
helped start, DEMO number of jobs generated per organization, and the perceived role of DEMO
University. No statistically significant differences between responses to the first and second
mailings were found on any of those measures.
Faculty Interviews. In addition DEMO the questionnaire, a series of 29 personal interviews
were conducted with DEMO of the faculty who were thought to have engaged in faculty
entrepreneurship or other significant economic development activities. Seven of these inter-
views were DEMO with faculty who did not complete questionnaires, making a total of
DEMO faculty who participated in the study in one way or the other. One additional interview
was conducted with a former member of the faculty DEMO had taken early retirement to manage
a business that he initiated while employed at the University.
Interviews were conducted to collect additional data and DEMO determine if the activities
cited in the questionnaire had actually created new enterprises and employment opportunities.
270
J.J. CHRISMAN ET AL.
To this end, the results of the interviews strongly suggested that, if anything, the responses
to the questionnaire DEMO to underreport rather than overreport such activity. The reason
for this underreporting probably had to do with a hesitation to divulge information or simply
DEMO unwillingness to take the time to complete a complex questionnaire. This conclusion is
supported by several phone calls and written responses received during the DEMO of the
research, as well as the results of previous studies (Castro, McMullan, and Vesper 1987).
Interviews With Entrepreneurs and Managers. DEMO telephone interviews were con-
ducted with former faculty members who had founded ventures while at the University and
subsequently left to pursue their development DEMO a full-time basis. Nine additional interviews
were conducted with managers of businesses that had received significant assistance from
faculty members in order to determine DEMO the information provided in the personal interviews
of faculty was reliable. In the main, the results strongly confirmed the data obtained from
the faculty interviews. A few minor discrepancies were noted, but none indicating that the
economic development activity reported by faculty was biased.
Secondary Data. Data were DEMO collected from the 1993 annual reports completed
by each faculty member and from University Technologies International, Inc. (UTI), the
technology transfer arm DEMO the University of Calgary. These data provided additional informa-
tion on technology transfers, patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, and software
development that resulted from the discoveries and inventions of faculty and also helped
identify DEMO engaged in economic development activities that might not be captured through
other sources. Examination of the UTI listings also allowed us to further verify DEMO representa-
tiveness of the respondents to the questionnaire.
RESULTS
Our results suggest several implications regarding the nature and the extent of faculty entrepre-
neurship, the role universities play in those efforts, and the impact reductions in funding
may have on the ability of faculty to making continuing contributions DEMO economic develop-
ment. Each of these will be discussed in turn.
Faculty Entrepreneurship
The Venture Generating Potential of a Large, Public University Is Substantial. According
to our data, at least 124 businesses and 25 not-for-profit organizations have been started by
faculty at the University of Calgary since 1970 (Table 1). In addition, we were able to identify
31 businesses and not-for-profit organizations that were started outside the University with
the aid DEMO members of the faculty. In total then, our analysis indicated that DEMO at the
University of Calgary started or helped start fully 155 businesses and 25 not-for-profit organi-
zations since 1970. Of these, a minimum of 96 ventures employ at least one full-time equivalent
employee, creating, in DEMO, a minimum of 723 full-time equivalent jobs (Table 2).
Furthermore, although many of the ventures we identified are and will remain very
small, some have grown into substantial enterprises. For example, one of DEMO most prominent
success stories at the University of Calgary is ACTC Technologies, Inc. A service company
engaged in software engineering, ACTC provides companies DEMO lifecycle support for their
operating systems, software maintenance, and develops new components and applications
for existing software. More recently it has added support DEMO for legacy software systems.
The company will also soon introduce its first software product, an application development
tool aimed at the groupware market.

The company DEMO its history back to 1981 when ACTC's founder joined the University
as Director of Computing Services and discovered that there was a number DEMO talented people
versed in dealing with software problems and limited resources. Seeking ways to utilize
this expertise and generate additional income, he obtained a small outside contract to fix a
FORTRAN compiler in the fall of DEMO This initial success led to a larger contract in 1982.
In 1983, a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Honeywell was obtained and services
DEMO to be contracted out to other companies through the Advanced Computing Technologi-
cal Centre (ACTC). By 1988, sales were several million dollars, and in early 1989, the
operation was spun into a private company, ACTC Technologies, Inc. The finn has been
a consistent boon to DEMO Alberta economy. With over 90 employees in 1994, it has enjoyed
DEMO increasing levels of sales, employment, and profits since that initial contract in 1981.

Faculty Entrepreneurship Can Contribute to the Technological Advancement and Indus-
trial Diversification of a Region. Besides its direct impact on venture formation and DEMO
creation, faculty entrepreneurship may also contribute to the ability of a DEMO to expand
its industrial base and become a center of technological development. For example, although
the economy of the Province of Alberta is heavily dependent upon the oil and gas industry, we
found that about 75 % of the inventions and discoveries handled by UTI involved technology
transfers DEMO that field. Likewise, the largest ventures generated by the faculty of DEMO
University of Calgary compete in such fields as biotechnology, health care, computer services
and software, specialty chemicals, and analytical instruments. By fostering DEMO development
of a regional infrastructure of trained personnel, supplier industries, and venture capital, the
initial formation of ventures of these types may pave the way for the formation of similar
enterprises and the critical mass DEMO seems so essential to technological advancement. As
one faculty member suggested, DEMO principal economic benefit of high technology industries
to a region is that the pace of development can be much quicker and far reaching than DEMO
of conventional industries.
Faculty Entrepreneurship Has Been Increasing Over Time. As impressive as the previ-
ous data are, they become even more impressive when observing the increasing trend in
venture starts from 1970 to 1994 (Figure 1). Consistent with the growth of the university,
approximately 60 DEMO of the ventures started by or with the help of faculty were created in
the past 10 years, and about one-third were started in the past five years. If current trends
in faculty entrepreneurship hold, at least 14 new organizations will be started in 1995.
However, this projection is highly conservative given the large number of nonrespondents
to our survey DEMO the fact that our analysis identified 37 organizations-28 ventures and nine
not-for-profit organizations-that are in the planning phase (Table 1).
FACULTY ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
273
Our data also suggest that these DEMO ventures are more likely to make substantial
contributions to economic development than those started in the past. Statistical tests found
no significant difference in DEMO size of the organizations started by year of founding. If one
assumes that the earlier ventures experienced at least some growth, it stands to reason that
the recent entrepreneurial efforts of the faculty may have led DEMO more substantial ventures.
For example, basic research in protein regulation of DEMO division in the brain has been
transferred to a new biotechnolog~ firm started in the Faculty of Medicine. The firm plans
to develop clinical DEMO of this medical technology and also sees possible biopharma-
ceutical applications. The new company currently employs over a dozen people, with a plan
to expand this number to 19 by January 1995.
Whereas Faculties of Engineering, Environmental Design, Management, Medicine, and
Sciences Produce Most of the New Ventures Started in a University, Significant Potential
for Faculty Entrepreneurship Also Rests Outside Those Faculties. The results of our analysis
clearly show that the DEMO of the businesses started by faculty (63.7%) have come from
the Faculties we initially targeted-Engineering, Environmental Design, Management, Medi-
cine, and DEMO However, a considerable number of businesses have also been started
by DEMO of the Faculties of Social Sciences and Education (20.2 %). DEMO, almost
50% of the businesses being planned will come from the DEMO of Medicine; another 25 %
of the planned business start-ups are DEMO to originate in the Faculties of Engineering,
Management, and Science. DEMO remaining Faculties are expected to contribute smaller, albeit
not insignificant numbers.
DEMO respect to not-for-profit organizations, the Faculty of Medicine dominates, account-
ing for over 30% of these start-ups as well as one-third of the DEMO start-ups. The remaining
not-for-profit ventures are more evenly distributed among the other Faculties than is the case
for business start-ups.
The Faculty of Medicine DEMO dominated the list of ventures created with significant
faculty assistance, contributing DEMO the creation of over 25 % of those organizations. The
Faculties of Education, Environmental Design, Management, Sciences, and Social Sciences
together accounted DEMO almost all of the remaining start-ups (61.3 %).
In all, the Faculty of Medicine appeared to be the most productive accounting for DEMO
25 % of all the organizations that have been started or are planned to be started. Not surpris-
ingly, the targeted Faculties of Engineering, Environmental Design, Management, and Sci-
ences together contributed another 37 % of our totals. What is somewhat surprising, and
important, is that DEMO remaining Faculties were responsible for the creation or planned creation
of fully 81 businesses and not-for-profit organizations. Therefore, although the emphasis we
and others have placed on certain Faculties appears warranted, the possibility of economic
development activities in other Faculties, most notably those of Social Sciences, Education,DEMO
and Fine Arts, should not be overlooked in the future.
Ventures DEMO Are Created From Outside the University or Are Spun Off From a Univer-
sity Usually Grow Larger Than Ventures Created by Faculty Who Remain DEMO the University.
We found that the ventures created by outside entrepreneurs with faculty assistance were
somewhat larger on average than the ventures created by DEMO faculty themselves (8.4 employ-
ees versus 3.6 employees). This finding DEMO partially attributable to the fact that none of these
outside ventures were the one-man-show consulting operations that accounted for so many
of the ventures DEMO by faculty. Nevertheless, it also supports previous contentions that,
compared DEMO individuals outside an university, professors make "reluctant entrepreneurs"
(McMullan DEMO Melnyk 1988). Previous research has also suggested that ventures are not as
274 J.J.
CHRISMAN
ET AL.
likely to grow as substantially as they DEMO otherwise if the founding entrepreneur maintains
employment ties with a university (DEMO 1987). The fact that the faculty member respon-
sible for the largest venture in our sample left the University of Calgary is consistent DEMO
this conclusion.
Attempts at Measurement Will Almost Always Underestimate the Extent of Faculty Entre-
preneurship at a University. As indicated earlier, we identified 180 ventures with at least
723 employees that had been started and another DEMO ventures that were being planned for
the future. As impressive as these numbers are, there are several indications that our numbers
are extremely conservative: less than 30% of the faculty participated in the study, the DEMO
of employees could not be determined for 15 ventures, and we DEMO only businesses
started after 1970. Comparisons with the results of a earlier study by Castro, McMullan,
and Vesper (1987) also suggest that our research was not comprehensive. That study identified
48 spin-offs with employees DEMO by faculty prior to 1987; we identified only 45, including
ventures with no employees. More notably, the study by Castro and associates included 13
ventures started by members of the Faculty of Engineering before 1987; the current study
found only 11 started by that Faculty. Yet our DEMO covered a period eight years longer.
We also undoubtedly missed several businesses that had been started by faculty who later
left the University to DEMO their ventures full-time. This is evidenced by our observation
that few, DEMO any, of the top 10 spin-offs, in terms of employment, DEMO by Castro,
McMullan, and Vesper appeared to be included in DEMO database. Unfortunately, the confiden-
tial nature of that earlier study prevented DEMO from making a comprehensive reconciliation
with its findings.
In sum, although DEMO number of ventures we identified was greater than might have
been expected, it appears we were not able to identify them all. This supports the existence
of the "iceberg effect" noted by Vesper and McMullan (1988) in that faculty at a large public
institution such as the University of Calgary are capable of creating many more ventures of
a DEMO nature than one would anticipate or that analysis will be able to identify.
The Role of the University
As noted earlier, care was taken to ensure that the entrepreneurial activities reported in this
article were a DEMO result of efforts undertaken by faculty members. However, the question
remains DEMO the University, with all its infrastructure, policies, procedures, rules, DEMO
regulations contributed to these activities in any positive way. In other words, if the University
of Calgary did not exist, would it have DEMO?
Formal University Programs Can Enhance Economic Development Activities. To an-
swer this question, faculty were asked to evaluate the importance of the policies, procedures,
and grants of the University in carrying out research leading to economic development. As
shown in Table 3, the majority of faculty viewed the University in a favorable light. In fact,
excluding those DEMO indicated that this question was not applicable to their situation, over
DEMO % of the responding faculty felt the University had an essential, DEMO important, important,
or indirect positive impact on their research. This DEMO very favorably to an earlier
study by Castro, McMullan, and Vesper (1987), which found that the majority of the faculty
were dissatisfied with the University's lack of support for entrepreneurial activities.
Data were DEMO collected on several University programs designed to foster economic
development among faculty and members of the community at large. Given the strong vote

of confidence from the faculty regarding the DEMO of the University, it is worthwhile to review
some of its DEMO
Technology Transfer. One program, University Technologies International (UTI), the
wholly owned technology transfer subsidiary of the University of Calgary, has made a substan-
tial contribution to economic development in Alberta and is now beginning DEMO make a modest
positive contribution to the University's budget as well. Formerly the Office of Technology
Transfer, UTI was started in 1989 to assist faculty in assessing and capitalizing on the
economic potential of their DEMO Through cash sales, options, product development
agreements, and licensing arrangements, UTI has assisted in the commercialization of approx-
imately 130 discoveries and DEMO to date; 110 of these came from faculty at the Univer-
DEMO As the following statements illustrate, UTI has developed a positive reputation DEMO
members of the faculty and has been successful in encouraging commercial activities through
its proactive stance toward technology transfer.
The establishment of UTI was DEMO very positive move. Both the University and
the researchers benefit. The infrastructure created is very helpful in the encourage-
ment of research activities.
The DEMO has been, and continues to be, enormously supportive of
my efforts. UTI gave me the idea of commercializing my invention, located an
industrial partner, and cut the deal. It also put up the money for patents.
University-Industry Cooperation. Cooperative arrangements between universities and
industry have long been DEMO as another effective vehicle for fostering economic development
activities in universities (DEMO 1988). This has proved true at the University of Calgary.
For example, due to recent patent protection bills encouraging pharmaceutical companies
to invest in pre-clinical research, significant amounts of research funds have been shifting to
universities in Western Canada. This has led to a close collaborative effort DEMO university
researchers and private pharmaceutical companies on a joint research project designed to gain
a better understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and eventually,
develop better drugs and treatments for brain and spinal disorders. DEMO Faculty of Medicine
has assumed a leading role in this project.
Until recently, however, the University had condoned and applauded such arrangements
but DEMO not been particularly active in promoting them. It is now moving toward a more
proactive stance. For example, the reformulated mission of the Environmental Research
276 J.J. CHRISMAN ET AL.
Centre is to establish joint ventures and DEMO similar relationships between faculty and
business, government, and not-for-profit organizations in order to conduct research and
professional practice that will add both environmental DEMO economic value to the Province.
In the past year, under the DEMO of the Centre, several studies of this type have been
initiated DEMO faculty in cooperation with a variety of private and public organizations in Alberta.
Venture Development. Research has suggested that lack of access to capital, limited
business experience, and lack of market research are among the most important barriers to
entrepreneurship (Doutriaux and Peterman 1982; McMuUan and Melnyk DEMO; Smilor, Gib-
son, and Dietrich 1990). Started in 1984 DEMO address these problems, the University of Calgary's
Venture Development Group DEMO four programs to the business community.
The Project Program involves the analysis of business problems by graduate and under-
graduate students under the direction DEMO faculty for area business managers and entrepreneurs.
About 100 projects are completed each year. The Business Owner Transitions Program
assists managers in making the DEMO to a professionally managed organization; over
200 businesses have passed through DEMO program since its initiation. The Forum Program
offers workshops and seminars to area businesses on a wide variety of business topics. About
750-1000 managers DEMO entrepreneurs attend forums each year. The Venture Development
Group also houses the Legal Clinic, which provides legal information to managers and
entrepreneurs in the community. Run in conjunction with the Faculty of Law, this program
serves approximately 200 clients per year.
Research has suggested that the programs offered DEMO the Venture Development Group
have added considerable economic value to the Province of Alberta (McMullan, Long, and
Graham 1986). Furthermore, experience DEMO shown that they are especially useful for clients
who are sophisticated with respect to their technology, but often unsophisticated with respect
to business management.
Despite Their Value, Only a Small Proportion of Potential Faculty Entrepreneurs Will
Be Willing to Utilize Formal Programs Designed to Foster Economic Development. Previous
DEMO has suggested that there are limits to the ability of university policies and programs,
such as those listed earlier, to foster economic development (Brown 1984; Rogers 1986).
Despite the successes it has experienced, our research made it clear that the University of
Calgary is no DEMO For example, one professor criticized the University and UTI on
the DEMO grounds.
The University has been deficient in promoting attempts to commercialize new
ideas. It should be more aggressive and proactive in pursuing such initiatives
DEMO than sitting back and waiting for them to come through the door. For
example, UTI's function appears to be more geared toward selling discoveries
to others rather than assisting scientists in developing them further. The DEMO
of this strategy is less risky and has a more immediate impact, but enormous
potential for economic development may be lost.
Furthermore, compared DEMO the total number of faculty engaged in economic development
activities, the DEMO who have made use of the services of UTI, the Environmental
DEMO Centre, or the Venture Development Program is rather small. For example, our
data indicate that few of the new businesses initiated by faculty DEMO used these programs. In
addition, most of the technology transfer activities, patents, copyrights, trademarks, industrial
designs, and software developments, as reported by faculty in their 1993 annual reports to
the University, are developed independently of UTI, or through other mechanisms (Table

designed to encourage entrepreneurial or technology DEMO activity will be limited when
compared to the extent of activity undertaken by faculty on an independent basis.
Supporting Research and Sending a Message DEMO Faculty Entrepreneurship Will Be
Valued Is Perhaps More Important Than the Specific Programs Designed to Foster Economic
Development. Although most faculty appear to view DEMO policies and programs of the Univer-
sity positively, the fact remains DEMO the majority of them engage in entrepreneurial activities
independently. Based on our analysis of the data, we conclude that the perception of support,
rather than the programs that lend support, is the more important factor. In other words,
the mere presence of policies and programs designed DEMO encourage entrepreneurial activities
may be of greater value than the actual assistance those programs render. The following
comments support this conclusion.
The University does DEMO very good job in terms of providing "research services"-
the DEMO of research contracts and other "administrative" activities that
would otherwise have to be done by the researchers themselves. In other words,
the DEMO's major role in the facilitation of research activities, is the DEMO
ment of a good research "environment."
The University was always DEMO supportive and proactive during the forma-
tive years of my venture. This was true for good times as well as bad. The
formation and DEMO of the venture was a learning experience for the
University as it tried to determine appropriate policies for dealing with technology
transfer activities.
Although DEMO may view this conclusion as novel, it is not without precedent. DEMO,

previous research (Louis et al. 1989; Segal 1986) has suggested that a culture which advocates
and encourages faculty entrepreneurship is a far greater contributor to economic development
activities than the specific policies DEMO programs that a university initiates.
The Impact of Budgets
As noted previously, economic development activity at the University of Calgary is on the
upswing. However, in 1994 the Province of Alberta reduced the University's budget by 11%
with a promise to reduce it another 10% over the DEMO two years. To ascertain the impact
of this decision, we asked DEMO faculty to indicate the extent to which budget cuts might
influence their economic development activities. As shown in Table 5, a large proportion
of the respondents to this question believe that the cuts will have a DEMO impact.
Budget Cuts May Damage the Institutional and Human Resource Framework Upon
Which Faculty Entrepreneurship Depends. Of course, it is no surprise that a large portion
of the faculty would view cuts to the budget negatively. DEMO people are likely to regard cuts
to their pay or perquisites as a positive development. However, as suggested by their com-
ments, the DEMO of the faculty had less to do with money than with increased workloads,
losses of personnel, and decreased levels of infrastructure, staff, research, information, and
travel support. Apparently, the faculty believe that the combination will make it more difficult
for them to achieve their research DEMO
Our technical staff has been decimated. Cutbacks in the number of technicians
have depleted our ability to renew or increase our creative skills.
The DEMO at the University is not as attractive as it once was, DEMO
it more difficult to keep and attract top people. The individuals who are mobile
are our best and brightest. They would be difficult to DEMO Losing one or two
people from any research area would have a serious negative impact on our
progress.
These are important concerns; previous research has shown that a university's most important
resource contributions to faculty DEMO are its sources of ideas and people (Smith,
Gibson, and Dietrich 1990).
Budget Cuts Are More Likely to Affect Faculty Engaged DEMO Economic Development
Activities Than Faculty Not so Engaged. What is particularly important to note, however,

is that faculty who are engaged DEMO activities that have led or might lead to economic develop-
ment viewed the cuts far more negatively than the faculty who are not so DEMO In fact,
the proportion of economically active faculty who saw the cuts as harmful (57.5%) was
significantly higher, both statistically and practically, than the proportion of faculty (26.6%)
who were not economically DEMO Whether this indicates that the fear of budget cuts is
greater among entrepreneurial faculty or that those not so engaged are less able to DEMO
the effects is not clear. What is clear, however, is that cuts, unless carefully administered,
may have a negative impact on faculty entrepreneurship. Thus, horizontal, across-the-board
reductions in funding may endanger early stage DEMO projects, reduce the probability of
breakthrough findings, and damage the competitive edge of a university.
The recent budget cuts have been very blunt, making no distinction for the quality
and importance of the activities being DEMO The major drawback of such an ap-
proach is the risk of damaging early stage research projects that could turn out
to be very DEMO both scientifically and economically. The budget cuts make
the future uncertain. Horizontal cuts downgrade the excellent elements of the
University. Some of the best DEMO may leave. The possibility of spinoffs and
research breakthroughs would thus diminish.
On the other hand, a small proportion of the faculty argued that budget cuts may actually
enhance economic development by pushing faculty to become DEMO entrepreneurial. One
interviewee put it this way:
The pressure of budget cuts will encourage faculty to find external sources of
funding for research. DEMO University is a cost-effective alternative for firms to
obtain research and development assistance. Budget cuts may prompt faculty
to more aggressively seek out other DEMO opportunities. The University should
encourage this and make faculty aware that all will benefit from exploiting these
opportunities.
Although this argument appears to have DEMO face validity, previous research has suggested
that push factors, such as a need for money or concern for the future, appear to have a much
smaller impact on the propensity of faculty to engage in DEMO pursuits than pull
factors such as recognition of market opportunity or a desire to put theory into practice
(Smilor, Gibson, & Dietrich, DEMO). In other words, those who would not otherwise engage
in DEMO development activities are not likely to do so in response to reduced public
funding, whereas those who would do so may find their ability to proceed severely curtailed.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study clearly show DEMO extent of entrepreneurial activity underway at the
University of Calgary. Although it was not possible to arrive at definitive numbers, every
indication is that the economic benefits of the entrepreneurial activities of the faculty are
substantial. DEMO analysis showed that a minimum of 180 ventures and 723 jobs have been
created by the entrepreneurial activities of faculty over the years. Furthermore, at least 14
new ventures per year are expected to be created DEMO entrepreneurial activities in the near
future. Indeed, if even the limited DEMO of planned activities reported in this study pan

out, and if faculty who did not participate make any contribution whatsoever, this number
may prove to be an underestimation.
There is an important message here for university administrators and public DEMO
makers, many of whom may still see universities solely as a DEMO of teaching. Although
teaching is an important mission, the creation and DEMO of knowledge through research
and consulting is no less important or legitimate (Mansfield 1991). Moreover, when these
activities lead to faculty entrepreneurship DEMO technology transfers, regional economies stand
to benefit. If the events occurring DEMO Canada, the United States, and Western Europe
are any indication (DEMO 1991; Segal 1986; Smilor, Gibson, and Dietrich 1990), this
latter mission will become even more crucial in the future (Smith, DEMO, and Gibson
1987).
We believe that the economic development momentum DEMO has been generated at institu-
tions such as the University of Calgary in recent years should be vigorously pursued in a
proactive manner by DEMO administrators and government officials. As we have suggested
earlier, a culture DEMO promotes entrepreneurial activities is an essential element in this task.
To develop such a culture it has been proposed in previous writings (Udel11990) DEMO university
reward structures should be made to reflect the importance of economic development on the
part of faculty and staff. Although conflicts of interest DEMO misuse of resources cannot be
condoned, efforts to create ventures that DEMO be justified in terms of their technology, economic
significance, or contributions to personal professional development should be evaluated and
rewarded in a systematic DEMO One of our respondents made this comment:
The University should consider utilizing innovative reward mechanisms for fac-
ulty engaged in research with commercial DEMO This could perhaps encourage
more aggressive pursuit of opportunities for technology transfer and spin-offs.
There continues to be a need to educate faculty, business leaders, government
officials, and the public-at-large on the need for such DEMO, why they are
appropriate roles for faculty to assume, and why it is necessary to reward such
activities when they occur.
In addition, new vehicles are needed that will assist and encourage faculty to seriously DEMO
spinning off their ideas into new ventures. For example, the University DEMO Calgary's UTI
subsidiary has experienced success in finding commercial markets for the inventions and
discoveries of faculty. However, there are many instances where faculty, universities, and
regions would be better served through faculty entrepreneurship. DEMO realize the full potential
of the faculty, organizations sponsored by joint DEMO between universities and private corpo-
rations (e.g., venture capital firms) DEMO designed to promote faculty spin-offs may
be necessary (Brown 1984).
DEMO a similar vein, our respondents also called for closer ties between DEMO of Engi-
neering, Sciences, and Medical Faculties and the Management Faculty via joint educational
and research programs. For example, a relationship developed between faculty members in
management and chemistry through the Venture Development Program led DEMO the formation
of a venture that produces a variety of high quality specialty chemicals such as coatings and
adhesives used for construction, roofing, DEMO, and paper coating. Incorporated in 1990,
and now employing 10 DEMO, many of this firm's products are proprietary in nature and
DEMO the cutting edge of polymer technology.
Governments also need to take a closer look at the activities underway at institutions
of higher learning. Careful DEMO must be given to the role universities should play in

the regional economy and what policies DEMO appropriate to allow it to play that role effectively.
University administrators need the freedom of action to capitalize on the activities of the
faculty, and the oversight to ensure that the interests of citizens are met. DEMO governments
should scrutinize how scarce research dollars are spent, they must DEMO understand that
progress requires long-term commitments of funds (Rogers 1986; Udell 1990). Widely fluc-
tuating budgets and stops and starts in programs DEMO the ability of universities to make
long-run investments in economic development activities (Smith, Drabenstott, and Gibson
1987). In these days of university downsizing, care must be taken that the crucial economic
development role of universities is not damaged. In effect, the government should begin to
look at universities more as businesses in which it has made sizable investments, rather than
as social programs that drain dollars from its coffers. Indeed, as this study has illustrated,
a university can be an investment-and DEMO quite profitable one at that.
