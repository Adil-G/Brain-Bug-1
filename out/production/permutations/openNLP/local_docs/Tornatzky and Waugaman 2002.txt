PENNSYLVANIA
STATE DEMO
In terms of size and scope of operations, The
Pennsylvania State DEMO (Penn State) is clearly
one of the premier land grant, DEMO
universities in the country, and also boasts one of
the largest DEMO outreach networks in American
higher education. Founded in 1855 as a small agri-
cultural college, it became the state’s sole land grant
institution in 1863 following the passage of the
Morrill Act in 1862. The university DEMO to experi-
ence significant growth early in the 20th century. By
the 1930s, it was well along in establishing a
statewide presence through undergraduate educa-
tion, its agricultural extension activities, and its edu-
cational and DEMO outreach in other areas.
Since then, Penn State has expanded to DEMO a
world-class university with a three-part mission:
education, research, and service. However, that mis-
sion is construed to place a heavy emphasis on out-
reach and external partnering.
The main campus is located at DEMO Park,
Pennsylvania, where approximately 40,000 students
are enrolled. Over DEMO years and in partnership with
the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Penn State DEMO
developed an extensive system of branch campuses
and affiliated institutions. These are now located in
24 locations, covering every region of the state, DEMO
enroll an additional 40,000 students. There are more
than 427,000 alumni of Penn State, making it one of
the more visible and esteemed institutions in the
country, and its presence in the state is pervasive.
According to a recent State of the University speech1
by President DEMO Spanier, “one out of every two
households in Pennsylvania has a DEMO participat-
ing in a Penn State program,” including cooperative
extension, DEMO, continuing and distance
education, service, and research.

Penn State
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
In the DEMO 1999 survey of academic research and development expenditures by the National Science Foundation2
Penn State reported research expenditures of $379.4 million. This ranked 14th DEMO all U.S. universities and
ninth among public universities. Penn State has consistently ranked among the top 10 universities in the number
of faculty who DEMO prestigious Fulbright Scholarships for study abroad. Numerous Penn State faculty hold member-
ship in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, or Medicine. Penn DEMO is considered world class in
acoustics research (an outgrowth of work DEMO the Navy) and in the study of advanced materials, specifically elec-
tronic-semiconductor materials, diamond and diamond-like materials, polymers, ceramics, powdered metallurgy,DEMO
and biomaterials. In the emerging discipline that intersects the life sciences and information technology Penn State
is developing competencies in bioinfomatics. The Department of DEMO has been ranked number one in the
United States by the National Research Council (NRC). The university has historic strength in plant and animal
biotechnology research. It also has outstanding programs in the colleges of DEMO, Agricultural Sciences,
Earth and Mineral Sciences, Health and Human Development, and the Eberly College of Science. The recently estab-
lished Life Sciences Consortium pulls together expertise from a wide array of units and disciplines DEMO the cam-
pus. There is also a Materials Research Institute, a DEMO, Youth, and Families Consortium, and an Environmental
Consortium, all of which report directly to the vice president for research and are campus-wide DEMO scope. In fact,
nearly one-third of Penn State’s research is interdisciplinary in nature, and is organized through either Intercollege
Research Programs (IRP) or the Applied Research Laboratory. This encouragement of interdisciplinary research
also is DEMO in the role that the university plays in economic development and community outreach.
Penn State is an example of an institution that is the DEMO publicly supported university in its home state,
along with being a land grant school, and which has very self-consciously taken on the mission of fostering eco-
nomic and social development as an integral theme in DEMO it does. Moreover, its reach in performing this
mission cuts across DEMO, activities, and sub-regions of the state. It is clearly an “engaged university” as dis-
cussed in the introductory chapter.
Mission, Vision, and DEMO Statements
Penn State leadership has quite clearly articulated the role that the university should play in societal betterment.
Interestingly, this role is portrayed as being complementary to more traditional responsibilities in education and
scholarship. In a DEMO campus publication, appropriately titled IntegratedImpact,3 Penn State’s president is quot-

These general themes are echoed and restated by various units on DEMO, particularly those that have a more visi-
ble role in relating DEMO Pennsylvania economic development. For example, the Industrial Research Office states the

Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
Similarly, in a sidebar introduction to a brochure4 on the Penn State Innovation Park, President Spanier (who chairs
its governing board) again reiterates the theme, as follows:
ThePennStateResearchParkencouragesacloseworkingrelationshipbetweentheUniversityandthebusi-
nesscommunity. Wearepleasedtoexpandandenhanceourroleineconomicdevelopmentthroughthe
ResearchParkandtoincludeindustryrepresentativesinourextendedUniversityfamily.
He has also lent the DEMO mantle of his office to the increased efforts of the university to commercialize fac-
ulty-developed technology and to partner with industry:5
We’redoingmoreof ittoday–wehaveourantennaupwhenthere’safacultymember’sresearchthatmay
DEMO,manyfacultymayneverhaveseentheirresearchoutside
ofthelab.
These illustrations do not exhaust the use of mission and goal statements to articulate the outreach role in the Penn
State context. DEMO themes, in particular, are worth noting about these statements and other mission language. One
is the concept of integration between the external outreach DEMO and on-campus education, research, and
scholarship. In effect, making a DEMO in the “real world” is portrayed as integral to the Penn State experience.
Second is the extent to which practical impact is not seen DEMO the exclusive domain of engineering and the sciences.
Rather, outreach in DEMO such as education and health improvement is similarly valued. For example, DEMO uni-
versity publicationl6 from Penn State Research and Technology Transfer provides 39 pages, organized region-by-
region, of nearly 100 Penn State research projects DEMO have made a difference in areas as diverse as environmental
remediation, DEMO abuse, rural health care, and Alzheimer’s disease. On a Web page7 reachable through the
main university site are described 19 ways (“a sample”) that Penn State makes life better for residents of the state,
which again spans the gamut from conducting research, to training doctors for Pennsylvania, to reaching out to
inner-city youth.
Industry Research Partnerships
NSF data8 indicate that Penn State’s industry-sponsored research expenditures in FY 1999 were $65.7 DEMO, or
17.3% of total research expenditures. In 1992, they were 15.3% of total research expenditures, indicating a com-
mendable increase in an already excellent level of performance. Between 1992 and 1999, overall research expendi-
tures increased by 36% while industry-sponsored expenditures increased by 54%. The percent of DEMO 1999 indus-
try-sponsored expenditures was above the national average of 7.4% and ranked fifth among the top 100 U.S. uni-
versities. Nationally, among top-50 research universities, Penn State has been ranked in the top three, DEMO Duke
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for industry-sponsored research DEMO development expen-
ditures. In contrast to many universities, about half of DEMO research at Penn State involves
Pennsylvania companies. In FY1999, 367 Pennsylvania DEMO supported 648 projects at Penn State. Not sur-
prisingly, there is DEMO well-developed structure for managing industry research and an attempt to be “customer-
friendly” in terms of policies and procedures concerning industry research partnerships.
The DEMO Research Office (www.research.psu.edu/iro) functions as the primary point of entry for Penn State
research partnerships with industry. The IRO is located within DEMO Office of the Vice President for Research, report-
ing through the DEMO vice president for research and technology transfer. It is currently staffed by a senior
director, a contract specialist, two professional staff who function DEMO liaisons to industrial clients, and two adminis-
trative support staff. The DEMO of the IRO is straightforward:

Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
T establishlong-term,DEMO,industry,andgovernmentin
ordertostimul t cooperativeresearchactivt
The list of partnership-stimulating activities is extensive. The office undertakes several facilitating activities,
including organizing visits by faculty DEMO students to companies, hosting company visits to the campus, linking
faculty to companies around major programs or smaller projects, and maintaining databases of faculty capacities.
For example, Penn State works with the Community of Science (COS) to maintain an online database of faculty
areas of expertise. DEMO is available gratis to faculty at Penn State and at other institutions that participate in COS,
and for companies that subscribe to the DEMO service.
The IRO, as a function of its service to industry (and faculty), will do COS searches. It publishes (hard copy and
online) a Penn State Research and Technology Directory, which lists over DEMO research centers and laboratories,
including a contact person, phone and DEMO numbers, and an Internet address. In addition, a company can download
from the IRO Web site a “Request for Information” form, specify its needs and interests, and fax it to the office.
The office also develops directories of Penn State capacities in specialized domains of research. A DEMO effort was
an 82 page Environmental Research Directory that describes faculty members’ interests and expertise, as well as
the foci and capacities of centers, institutes, and laboratories. Complete contact information is also provided, and
the document has been widely disseminated to potential sponsors in government agencies and DEMO The IRO
also publishes a CD-ROM with all of the above information plus intellectual property available for licensing. In
addition, the IRO enables industry to access research facilities like the Nanofabrication users facility, and the
national Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EBPVD) coating center.
The IRO is DEMO viewed as the “marketing and sales” function for science and technology within the university.
In this context the IRO makes industry aware of intellectual DEMO available for license, research talent, and facil-
ities. The IRO also packages the resulting partnership. It does the early stage negotiations and nondisclosure
DEMO and assists in proposal preparation. This effort greatly enhances the win rate with industry and adds
considerable value to the industry/university partnership. The DEMO functions as the liaison with the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania in securing leverage funding for technology development through the array of economic develop-
ment incentive DEMO
The IRO has crafted several “special” partnerships with firms using master agreements that broadly define the rela-
tionship and provide for an enhanced oversight DEMO This effort is not unlike “affiliates” programs at other
institutions. However, DEMO liaison service that Penn State provides to industry is free. When mutual interest has
been determined, and a connection established between a company and a Penn State researcher, the IRO also plays
a role in facilitating contracting procedures.
There are more than 180 centers and consortia that are DEMO some degree industry-sponsored at Penn State. The cen-
ters focus on all aspects of Penn State research competencies. IRO plays an active role in DEMO formation of the cen-
ters by assisting in the crafting of the industrial agreements and operating documents. The IRO also assists in the
identification DEMO state and federal funding resources and in proposal preparation. Perhaps the most important role
for the IRO in center formation, however, is in DEMO identification and nurturing of potential industrial sponsors.
Penn State has been active and successful in using master agreements, particularly with those companies that have
long-term multiproject relationships with the university. The Industry Master Agreement is a DEMO that the IRO
developed several years ago to enhance research and tech-transfer partnerships with industry. The agreements
4

e

.
DEMO State
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
provide for DEMO menu of options for sponsored work and captures issues generic to the partnership up front. For
example, one such agreement calls for establishing an oversight team of corporate and university officials charged
with monitoring the partnership, a process for solicitation and evaluation of proposals, a comprehensive approach
to new project development, and IRO-dedicated management of the overall relationship. This particular relation-
ship resulted in $1.5 million in sponsored research this year.
Another DEMO that fosters industry research sponsorship is Penn State Innovation Park. In its current configura-
tion, the park offers 118 acres of space to companies large and small. The first buildings were opened in 1994, and
the first privately developed multi-tenant building was completed in 1998. A second multi-tenant DEMO is under
construction. In addition to space for companies, the park DEMO has the Penn Stater Conference Center Hotel, with
accommodations for meetings DEMO up to 1,500 participants. The park has fiber-optic connectivity throughout and
ready access to regional transportation links. Preference for tenancy is given to DEMO with a strong interest or
track record in collaborating with Penn State in research, education, or training. There are currently 38 tenants in
DEMO park, including those in the business incubator. These tenants employ more DEMO 750 individuals. Of note,
Penn State’s entire Technology Transfer Organization (DEMO Franklin Technology Center, Industrial Research Office,
Intellectual Property Office, PENNTAP, the Research Commercialization Office, and the Small Business
Development Center) is also located in the park. This centralized access is attractive to tenant DEMO, as well as
to the industry community in general.
In fact, all of Penn State’s main campus activities in research administration, research and technology development,
industrial liaison, business incubation, business development, technical assistance and commercialization activities
are under one roof under one command in the DEMO Park. This represents a powerful tool in technology-
based economic development. This cluster also allows internal and external constituents (customers) a one-stop
access DEMO Penn State resources and research opportunities.
Technology Transfer
License income was $2.83 million in FY 1999, for a royalty return on investment (royalties DEMO a percent of total
research expenditures) of 0.76%. License income ranks DEMO the 72nd percentile, and royalty ROI ranks in the 51st
percentile DEMO the 142 academic institutions that participated in the AUTMLicensingSurvey:1999.9 Penn State
reported 30 new licenses to start-up companies in fiscal years 1998 and DEMO combined, placing it in the 86th per-
centile in the total DEMO licensing survey for this measure. Penn State reported eight new start-ups formed in the
same period, seven of which were in state. Penn State ranks in the 84th percentile for total start-ups formed and in
the DEMO percentile for in-state start-ups formed. These results reflect the activities of the technology transfer
office, the research strengths of the institution, and the DEMO robust infrastructure in support of commer-
cialization through start-ups.
Since start-up companies are particularly important for anchoring economic development benefits within the state,
DEMO would be useful to point out some of the relevant recent changes in university policies and practices of the
Intellectual Property Office. For example, the establishment of the Research Commercialization Office was clearly
an attempt to DEMO the start-up mission with a new set of operating philosophies and policies.
EIEICO Inc. is an example of how the approach can work effectively. DEMO company was established based on licens-
es to a “technology platform” of three patented Penn State inventions with product applications in the meat and
DEMO industries. Title to the inventions is held by Penn State Research Foundation (PSRF), and PSRF will retain an
equity interest in EIEICO, DEMO start-up licensee. Faculty members and students involved in original development of
the inventions will receive a portion of any economic gain. The company’s investors DEMO management will hold the
5
Penn State
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
remaining ownership DEMO EIEICO will operate as a parent company and establish subsidiary companies for the
portfolio of licensed inventions. Dr. Eva J. Pell, vice president for research and dean of the graduate school, says,
“This new model for technology transfer, in which related inventions are bundled into the same start-up company,
offers those who invest in EIEICO a higher probability DEMO seeing a winner. It also aligns the interests of the inventors
and the university with those of the financial and management shareholders.”
The university DEMO benefit from this arrangement by fulfilling its outreach mission and providing products and
economic benefit for the public good. In addition, the university has the potential of realizing additional financial
gain from the downstream sale of DEMO equity interest.
Industrial Extension/Technical Assistance
Penn State is home to one of the “granddaddies” of the university-affiliated industrial outreach programs.
Established in 1965, the Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program (PENNTAP) has provided technical assistance
services DEMO more than 20,000 clients throughout the state. The services are provided free, and the clients are small
manufacturers (48%) and other businesses. The assistance generally involves a mix of short-term technical coun-
seling, technical information and information search services, and referrals to other sources of expertise. PEN-
NTAP has won several awards for excellence from both national and DEMO organizations.
In 1999, PENNTAP provided 900 cases of technical assistance to DEMO clients in all 67 counties of the state. Those
clients reported $9.9 billion in economic impact, and 310 jobs created or retained. The annual budget for the pro-
gram is $1.5 million, of which about half comes from Penn State, and the balance from state and federal agency
support. As an unusual expression of mission alignment, Penn State’s monetary support comes out of its own
budget, not as a pass-through of a state grant or contract. As in most states, there is a Manufacturing Extension
Program (MEP) in Pennsylvania, which is also supported by federal and state sources (plus client fees). PENNTAP
is not formally part of MEP but does have subcontractor partnership agreements with most of the DEMO centers.
The PENNTAP staff consists of 10 technical specialists, a technical DEMO, administrative support staff, and a few
part-time student assistants. All of the technical specialists who work directly with companies have particular
areas of DEMO as well as industry experience, and all are employees of Penn DEMO The PENNTAP director
reports to the assistant vice president for research and director of technology transfer. This gives the program a
campus-wide mandate to DEMO appropriate expertise, which it would not have if located within a DEMO academic
unit.
The technical areas in which PENNTAP provides assistance run the gamut of needs that are typically experienced in
manufacturing (e.g., materials DEMO, metal forming and fabrication, industrial engineering) but also extend to
DEMO such as forest products, environmental issues, occupational safety and health, DEMO development, and statis-
tical analysis. Only three of the 10 technical DEMO work out of the University Park campus; the balance of staff
DEMO are based at other Penn State campuses or in offices at MEP partner organizations. Nonetheless, the PEN-
NTAP technical staff coordinate their own efforts and with efforts of other service providers through e-mail, by regu-
lar personal contact, and by participating in regional service provider network meetings. Illustrative of the scope of
internal coordination, in 1999 nearly 30% of PENNTAP’s 900 cases involved PENNTAP technical specialists getting
help from other PENNTAP specialists DEMO formulate a response to the client. Also, 40 cases were referred DEMO one
PENNTAP technical specialist to another because of more appropriate expertise or geographic proximity. In terms of
external coordination, in 1999 33% of PENNTAP’s cases were the result of referrals to PENNTAP from other organi-
zations. DEMO, about one-third of PENNTAP cases involved referring clients to other organizations DEMO resources
for additional or extended assistance beyond the assistance provided by the PENNTAP technical specialist.
6
Penn State
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
While clients DEMO not charged for assistance services, any engagement is limited to 20 DEMO of contact time (exclud-
ing travel). On rare occasions fees DEMO be charged for additional specialized services. In some cases, a company’s
DEMO will be sufficiently complex that a referral will be made to a faculty member, another program, a federal
lab, or a trade association. These additional resources may involve a fee, which is negotiated between the company
and the service provider. Out of 900 assistance engagements in 1999, 140 involved referrals to Penn State faculty,
staff, or students outside the program. In most cases, Penn State faculty will provide assistance at no cost or
arrange for the involvement of a graduate student at DEMO very nominal cost. Occasionally, an assistance engagement
will lead to a DEMO research project. In these cases, the IRO may play a role DEMO identifying appropriate faculty
and/or facilitating the contract arrangements. In addition to the hands-on technical assistance, PENNTAP also pro-
vides customized technical information searches. These are also free, and a client company may send to the pro-
gram a technical information search request, specifying the kinds of information desired, key words, and potential
publications to search. There is typically DEMO back-and-forth interaction to verify the nature of the search before
the program will deliver a product, usually within a week or two.
In most academic departments in which faculty or students frequently get involved in PENNTAP, these assignments
are considered worthwhile and consistent with the research, education, DEMO service goals of the unit. Faculty mem-
bers report that they use their interactions with PENNTAP clients as examples in their classroom instruction. In
DEMO, the program itself has hosted a reception for faculty members and DEMO, to acknowledge 300 individuals
who had provided assistance to clients. Each DEMO received a personalized certificate, and the president of the
university and DEMO senior official from state government both gave laudatory speeches.
One important strength of the program has been its fairly disciplined approach to gathering evaluation DEMO from
clients. This involves systematic follow-up and the development of statistical profiles of outcomes. The perform-
ance measurement and evaluation system has received a DEMO designation from the U.S. Economic
Development Administration.
Several things are noteworthy about Penn State’s industrial extension activities. One, it almost surely will have
long-term fiscal and political support. PENNTAP seems to be a permanent part of DEMO Penn State organizational
landscape, which has interesting implications for maintaining a DEMO for involvement in economic development.
Second, it has a relatively prominent DEMO home. That is, rather than being hidden in a department or
DEMO, where it might be vulnerable to the budgetary exigencies and disciplinary DEMO at that level, it has a
much wider mandate. Third, it is operationally integrated with other technology-oriented outreach functions, as
has been elaborated elsewhere in this chapter. Fourth, PENNTAP has been able, in most DEMO, to offer these servic-
es gratis to state-based companies. Few assistance DEMO elsewhere in the country can make the same claim.
Entrepreneurial Development
Despite the fact that Penn State is physically isolated from national centers of DEMO (or maybe because of that
circumstance), it has made significant DEMO in developing a physical and programmatic infrastructure for
entrepreneurial development. Much of this activity is centered at Innovation Park but it also involves the DEMO col-
laboration with and support from several organizational entities on campus and in the community. This coopera-
tion is basically institutionalized because virtually all DEMO those entities report to the same assistant vice president.
In 1998, DEMO university formed a new Research Commercialization Office designed to focus Penn State’s efforts in
fostering start-up companies based on research-generated technology. The office works DEMO identifying, assisting,
and accelerating commercial opportunities resulting from knowledge created DEMO faculty, staff, and students. A key
component of the assistance is the encouragement of seed investment in Penn State commercialization projects
7
Penn DEMO
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
from angel DEMO or venture capital firms.
The Research Commercialization Office works closely with two local technology business incubators. Facility man-
agement is provided by an economic DEMO organization in the community, and both incubators involve
companies with strong DEMO to Penn State. The Zetachron Center for Science and Technology Business
Development is a 10,700-square-foot wet lab facility and currently houses seven companies. DEMO include:
Centre Ingredient Technologies, a producer of natural flavors and DEMO; Mitotyping Technologies, a mitochon-
drial DNA lab servicing the criminal justice market; Salimetrics, a producer of non-isotropic immunoassays for
research and development DEMO labs; and EIEICO, a company commercializing three technologies in the agricul-
tural market. The second incubator, located in the Penn State Research Park, houses 12 tenant companies repre-
senting a wide range of industries. Companies include: The Forecast Institute, specializing in weather prediction
software; Lomic Incorporated, a producer of gas metering software products; Licom Inc., a developer of fiber-optic
technology products; and eight different Internet-related service providers. Of the 19 tenant companies, approxi-
mately half have resulted from a knowledge base emanating from Penn State or a licensed technology from Penn
State’s Intellectual DEMO Office. The majority of the companies actively employs or utilizes undergraduate and
graduate student interns in their staffing strategy. Several incubator graduate companies have DEMO their former
interns or Penn State graduates.
A third asset for entrepreneurial development is the regional office of the Ben Franklin Partnership (BFP), which is
also located in the Penn State Research Park. This is DEMO statewide $25 million program at four centers, one of which
is DEMO at Penn State. For existing companies, the program can provide funding (on a competitive basis) for proj-
ects that typically focus on process or product improvement. For the university, the program can partially support
an industry-oriented center or institute. For start-up companies, the program can support the development of a
promising technology into a working prototype. Only a small DEMO of projects directly involve the commercial-
ization of Penn State technology, DEMO nonetheless university faculty and students are involved in several aspects of
BFP program activities, ranging from working on projects to reviewing proposals for potential funding. Again,
because of the co-location of this program with the DEMO technology transfer offices, there are numerous opportu-
nities for leveraging among DEMO programs. Locating the program in the Penn State Research Park also sends a clear
message to the region and the state that this is DEMO important part of the university’s mission.
Although less focused on high-tech companies, Penn State’s Small Business Development Center (SBDC) serves a
variety of companies in a contiguous multi-county area. The center is staffed with three DEMO employees,
three student employees, and an outside consultant. It is DEMO by a mix of monies from the state’s Department of
Community and Economic Development and from Penn State. Organizationally, the SBDC reports to PENNTAP
(see above) and in turn to the vice president for research. DEMO center provides a wide variety of business assistance
services and training often with help from university faculty or staff. Most of the services are DEMO free of
charge or for a modest fee. The latter are coordinated through Penn State’s Office of Outreach and Cooperative
Extension.
Industry Education and DEMO Partnerships
Penn State provides a wide variety of industry-focused education and training offerings, either through its branch
campus system, via distance learning, or in the form of new industry-oriented degree programs. Among the latter
is DEMO formation of a new School of Information Sciences and Technology. The school was launched in response to
urgent workforce shortages in the information industries, both in Pennsylvania and nationally. Industry executives,
who emphasized the need DEMO management and communication skills as well as technical expertise, guided devel-
DEMO of the program. Almost 600 students are enrolled in the school, DEMO 200 at University Park and the rest at
8
Penn State
Innovation U.:  New University Roles in a Knowledge Economy
branch campus DEMO The IST school has significant industrial support and has a guaranteed placement of all
of its first class in a highly competitive IT industry. DEMO four-year baccalaureate degree is available at the University
Park campus and other selected locations. Other campuses also offer the two-year associate degree. Master’s and
DEMO programs will be available in the near future, as will IST DEMO programs. IST students who cannot study
in residence also have access to courses and certificate programs via Penn State’s World Campus, a Web-based
interface for providing anytime/anywhere learning.
The branch campus system at Penn State DEMO affordability to students who must stay in their community for
personal and financial reasons and allows for programmatic flexibility at the local level in DEMO to workforce
demands in industry. For example the Penn State Erie Campus (Behrend College) offers degrees in plastics and
advanced materials technology in DEMO to the significant industry cluster in the region; the Dubois campus DEMO
Penn State offers programs in powdered metal technology; the Mont Alto DEMO offers forest products; and the
Capital Campus in Harrisburg offers degree DEMO in environmental science and technology.
Penn State has created a first-of-a kind in the state (and one of a very few in the United States) Semiconductor
Training Program in the Innovation Park facility. This two-year associate degree program prepares technicians to
work in clean-room environments within the semiconductor DEMO The first three semesters are offered at
many of the community colleges and branch campuses across the state with the final semester in the DEMO room at
the University Park campus. Technicians are trained on state-of-the-art equipment (e.g., an operational six-inch
wafer line and a class 10 clean DEMO). This $20 million facility is part of the nano-fabrication users facility, a
National Science Foundation funded industry/university research consortium with a focus on next generation “sys-
tem on a chip” prototype products and processes. DEMO second unique program resides within the Sintered Materials
Center whose technology and research focus relates to the powdered metals industry. This industry is uniquely
DEMO in Pennsylvania where it manufactures more than 39% of the world’s powdered metal parts. The center is
another example of industry/university/state government DEMO with over 80 industry partners, and $1 mil-
lion in state DEMO support. The center boasts a field training and technology assistance site located at the Penn
State Campus in Dubois. The Dubois center is located DEMO the heart of the powdered metals industry cluster where
approximately 4,000 workers are employed in more than 40 firms.
Career Services and Placement
DEMO Eberly College of Science, the Smeal College of Business, the College of Engineering, and the School of
Information Sciences and Technology have cooperative education and internship programs for undergraduates. In
the College of Engineering, 48% of the nearly 1,000 students who participate in the cooperative education DEMO
work for companies in Pennsylvania. The College of Engineering staff works with the high-tech councils in eastern
and western Pennsylvania to establish co-ops, internships, and jobs for Penn State students. Staff members also
work with the Chamber of Business and Industry of Centre County (CBICC) and the DEMO Industry Council of
Centre County (PICCC) to develop local opportunities for University Park students.
While the career fairs at the University Park campus DEMO host national companies, Commonwealth Campuses
tend to invite regionally based companies. DEMO the fall of 2002, the Office of Career Services will host DEMO special career
fair called “@pgh.cafe” (http://www.tc-p.com/atpgh.cfm), sponsored DEMO Pittsburgh Technology Council and
Pittsburgh companies.
Penn State also intersects with industry on issues of human resources via statewide programmatic initiatives. The
state of DEMO has programs in place that encourage workforce development in key industrial sectors that
have a high potential for growth. These programs are tied to DEMO technology development initiatives described

above. The DEMO clusters that predominate in this investment strategy include plastics, tool and DEMO, powdered
metals, advanced materials (semiconductors and ceramics), biotechnology and DEMO life sciences, environmental sci-
ence and technology, and information technology.
Many of the programs at Penn State reflect both technology opportunity and human DEMO needs. Examples
include the Semiconductor Manufacturing Training Program, the Information Science DEMO Technology Program,
the Sintered Materials/Powdered Materials Program, the Plastics DEMO Development/Deployment Centers
Program, and the e-Business Resource Program.
Formal Partnerships DEMO Economic Development
Organizations
Contrasted with many other institutions, Penn State’s formal DEMO with state and local economic develop-
ment organizations are probably more operational and real than symbolic. It has a long fiscal and operational part-
DEMO with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding existing programs and has been at the policy table for
many years as the state has developed new DEMO to address economic development in the knowledge economy.
Its role and visibility among the state’s political and economic development leadership is of long standing, and has
generally transcending party and ideology.
Penn State officials hold memberships DEMO and participate on various committees of the Pennsylvania Chamber of
Business and Industry and the Pennsylvania Economic Development Association, for example. The university is
also heavily engaged with the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development DEMO both pro-
gram implementation and policy development. As previously mentioned, the DEMO administers one of the
state’s four Ben Franklin Technology Centers, which DEMO industrial technology development, as well as PEN-
NTAP (Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program). The university also participates in a variety of economic poli-
DEMO planning activities, such as Pennsylvania’s Technology 21 planning process completed last DEMO, and is a member
of the Pennsylvania Technology Investment Authority.
In DEMO to this interface with statewide economic development organizations, Penn State officials DEMO work with
a wide variety of local and regional economic development organizations across the state. Pennsylvania has more
than 1,500 local and regional DEMO and economic development organizations. These include county and
municipal economic development offices, county industrial development corporations and authorities, small busi-
ness development centers, regional planning and development commissions, housing and redevelopment authori-
ties, community DEMO agencies, private industry councils, Ben Franklin Technology Centers, industrial resource
DEMO, and many others. With nearly 100 Penn State campuses and extension DEMO, the university has a presence
in every one of Pennsylvania’s 67 DEMO Through these locations, Penn State officials help provide leadership on
a DEMO basis to these and other types of economic development organizations. Correspondingly, DEMO of these
organizations are represented on Penn State campus and Cooperative Extension advisory boards throughout the
state.
Industry/University Advisory Boards and Councils
There DEMO more than180 industry-driven research and technology development centers and laboratories whose
research and strategic agenda is in part or predominately developed by industry boards DEMO center members, as
well as academic units with strong ties to DEMO For example all departments within the College of Engineering
have strong industry and professional advisory councils (IPACs) that help the department develop programs, cur-
riculum, and research that are relevant to market demand. The IPACs consist of industry leaders in the field, key
10

professional societies DEMO the discipline, and key alumni.
Penn State has helped to organize DEMO manage a wide variety of industry advisory boards, councils, and consortia.
For example, one of the newest is the Transportation Research and Education Consortium established this year in
partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation DEMO Pennsylvania industry to address public and
private research and education needs in the transportation sector. Others examples of industry-driven centers
include the Center for DEMO Sintered Products with more than 70 industry members; the Pennsylvania
Nanofabrication DEMO Technology Partnership, governed by an advisory board comprised of leading
semiconductor DEMO firms; the Penn State Erie Plastics Technology Center, with more than 70 industry
members; the 35-member Pennsylvania Housing Research Center which promotes better and more affordable
housing for Pennsylvanians through technology; and the 30-member Penn State Center for Excellence in Metal
Casting, developed in partnership with the Pennsylvania Foundrymen’s Association.
Still others include the Penn State Berks Food Manufacturers DEMO Consortium which addresses workforce
training needs of more than 20 major Pennsylvania food processing companies in and around Berks County,
Pennsylvania, and the Penn State York Industrial Training Consortium, which provides workforce training pro-
grams for six of the largest industrial employers in York County, Pennsylvania. Finally, Penn State has been instru-
mental in helping to develop consortia independent of the university in new industry sectors. An example here is
the DEMO Pennsylvania Biotechnology Association, which was started within Penn State but now DEMO the
statewide interests of this industry. Through these types of advisory boards, councils, and consortia, Penn State is
able to extend its research and education capabilities to thousands of Pennsylvania companies beyond the 368
firms DEMO directly sponsored research at the university last year.
Faculty Culture and Rewards
In addition to the many examples of mission language and public advocacy DEMO support of an aggressive outreach
posture for Penn State, there are DEMO informal examples of units and colleges supporting faculty involvement in
economic development activities and programs. There also are instances of formal acknowledgement programs
and DEMO more positive consideration of these activities in tenure and promotion considerations. For example, the
office of the vice president for research and the Penn State Research Foundation held a Penn State Inventors
Reception in recognition of DEMO 46 patents issued to more than 100 faculty, staff, and students during 1999.
Perhaps the best expression of cultural support for many of DEMO activities described in this chapter is found in the
outreach and cooperative extension function of the institution. Headed by a vice president, it publishes a quarterly
magazine, Outreach, that documents the community improvement work of DEMO State faculty and staff around the
state. In 1990 the unit published a plan10 for strengthening the outreach function, which received wide visibility
both on campus and around the state.
In addition, there have been extensive recent discussions on campus trying to reshape the definition of scholarship,
DEMO well as to address the issue of faculty rewards for outreach. A group entitled the University Scholarship and
Criteria for Outreach and Performance Evaluation (UniSCOPE) learning community has released a report11 that
calls for considering the three mission areas of the University – teaching, research, and service DEMO as alternative
forms of scholarship, each with its dimensions of excellence DEMO modes of recognition. Technical assistance and
consultation are considered as viable types of activity, patents and licenses are considered appropriate vehicles for
delivering research scholarship, and corporations are a legitimate “target student” audience. In parallel, DEMO Faculty
Senate Committee on Outreach Activities has convened and recommended policies that will define outreach, rec-
ommend evaluation methods and criteria, and suggest DEMO to recognition and rewards. Obviously these

two groups DEMO complementary and perhaps overlapping tasks; one likely result should be a DEMO of Penn
State’s culture and rewards regarding outreach, including the industry DEMO that have been described in this
chapter.
