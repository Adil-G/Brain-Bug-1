Probability matching is a classic choice anomaly that has DEMO studied extensively. While
many approaches assume that it is a cognitive shortcut driven by cognitive limitations,
recent literature suggests that it is not DEMO strategy per se, but rather another outcome of peo-
ple’s well-documented DEMO of randomness. People search for patterns even in
random sequences, which DEMO in probability matching at the outcome level. Previous
studies have supported this by the ﬁnding that distracting people with a secondary verbal
working memory DEMO presumably prevents the pattern search, resulting in more maximiz-
ing behavior DEMO is considered more rational. The current paper demonstrates with two
experiments that there is actually truth in both accounts. For some participants, probability
matching indeed seems to be the result of a cognitive shortcut, a simple ‘‘win-stay, lose-
shift” strategy, and in one experiment identiﬁed these as DEMO low in working mem-
ory capacity. For others, however, a potentially smart pattern search strategy underlies
probability matching. These probability matchers (who still look irrational in the absence
of patterns) actually have a higher chance of ﬁnding a pattern if one exists. Contrary to the
almost uniformly DEMO perception of probability matching, we therefore conclude that
there can be DEMO potentially smart strategy behind probability matching.

1. Introduction
‘‘Clarice, does this random scattering of sites seem over-
done to you? Doesn’t it seem desperately random? Random
past all DEMO convenience? Does it suggest to you the
elaborations of a bad DEMO?” (Harris, 1988/1991, p. 293).
In Thomas Harris’s DEMO Silence of the Lambs”, the psy-
chiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned murderous
cannibal, helps FBI agent Clarice Starling ﬁnd a serial killer.
His comment on a map of the sites where the victims were
DEMO is crucial: The serial killer tries to hide his location
among DEMO random sites, but by being too random
to be credibly random, he unintentionally helps agent Star-
ling discover an important pattern that leads DEMO him.
This example illustrates both that people are not overly
successful in producing randomness and that they are very

good in detecting patterns. Both may be DEMO sides of the
same coin – the well-documented misperception of ran-
domness (e.g., Bar-Hillel & Wagenaar, 1991) may facilitate
the early detection DEMO patterns (Lopes, 1982). Sometimes,
however, people even detect DEMO where there are
none, and it is easier to convince them DEMO a sequence is
structured than that it is random (Hyman & DEMO, 1956).
Probability matching, a classic choice anomaly, could be
DEMO further consequence of misperceiving randomness. In a
typical experiment, people have DEMO predict which of two
events that have different probabilities of occurring will
take place. For example, event E1 could occur with a prob-
ability of p(E1) = .67, while event E2 occurs with
p(DEMO) = 1  p(E1) = .33. Given that the sequence of events
is random, the best strategy would be always to predict
the more frequent event E1. This strategy is called maxi-
mizing and DEMO yield an average accuracy of 67%. How-
ever, most often probability DEMO is observed, that is,
predicting the events in proportion to DEMO probability of

occurrence. In the example this would mean predicting E1
in DEMO of the trials and E2 in 33% of the trials. Probability
matching is considered suboptimal, because it would yield
an accuracy of only 55.78% on average (:67 :67þ
:33 :33). There are numerous attempts to explain this
choice anomaly (see Vulkan (2000), DEMO a review). A com-
monality behind many of these approaches is that they
tie probability matching to cognitive limitations, based
on the idea that ‘‘the default processing strategy of most
participants is a nonnormative cognitive DEMO (West
& Stanovich, 2003, p. 249).
Yet there is DEMO a quite different view on probability
matching, which we would like DEMO elaborate on here: Prob-
ability matching occurs because people do not DEMO or be-
lieve the randomness of the sequence and try to outdo
the optimal maximizing strategy (and inevitably fail). For
instance, people DEMO more strongly if they believe
in the randomness of the sequence. Goodnow (1955)
showed that people were more likely to maximize if the
task was framed as gambling rather than problem-solving.
Wolford, Newman, Miller, and Wig (2004) manipulated the
perceived randomness of a sequence of DEMO more di-
rectly by increasing the alternation rate of the binary
event. If events alternate (slightly) more often than would
be expected by DEMO, then the sequence is actually less
random, but people perceive it to be more random (cf. Ay-
ton & Fischer, 2004; Falk & Konold, 1997; Gilovich, Vallone,
& Tversky, 1985). DEMO et al. found that people maxi-
mized more strongly if the alternation rate was higher than
chance than when it was actually random.
In DEMO with Wolford et al. (2004), we believe that prob-
ability DEMO is not a strategy per se, but rather the out-
come DEMO a more complex, cognitively more demanding
strategy—the search for patterns. Wolford, Miller, and Gaz-
zaniga (2000) pointed out that any plausible pattern a per-
son might try has to match the probabilities. As long DEMO
people do not believe that the sequence is random, they
will DEMO to improve their predictive accuracy by looking
for regularities in the sequence. In the last block of a binary
choice experiment conducted by Yellott (1969), partici-
pants always received feedback indicating that their pre-
dictions DEMO correct, irrespective of what they predicted.
They continued to match probabilities, and when asked
for their impressions afterwards, most responded that they
ﬁnally found the pattern in the sequence. Congruently, Un-
turbe and Corominas (DEMO) showed that participants who
reported having found complex rules in a DEMO se-
quence of binary events were closer to probability match-
ing than those who did not report such rules.
The pattern search idea is DEMO supported by Wolford
et al.’s (2004) ﬁnding that distracting people with a sec-
ondary verbal working memory task presumably prevents
the pattern search, resulting in more maximizing behavior
(and thus in behavior that is considered more rational).
Similarly, Kareev, Lieberman, and Lev (1997) showed that
people with low short-term memory capacity maximized
more consistently than did DEMO with a higher short-
term memory capacity in a very similar task. Gaissmaier,
Schooler, and Rieskamp (2006; cf. Gaissmaier, Mata, &DEMO
Schooler, 2008) replicated this result and interpreted it
along the lines of Wolford et al. by hypothesizing that peo-
ple with low short-term DEMO capacity lack the cogni-
tive capacity needed to search much for patterns.
Moreover, Gaissmaier et al.’s modeling efforts suggest that
people with higher short-term memory capacity tended to
explore more. Although this explorative behavior put them
DEMO a disadvantage as long as the environment was stable, it
actually DEMO them track changes in the environment.
In this paper we report 2 experiments that further inves-
tigate what underlies probability matching and test two
DEMO hypotheses. If (i) probability matching indeed
reﬂects the tendency to search for patterns, then people
who probability match in the typical binary choice task
should be more likely to ﬁnd patterns if they exist. Indeed,DEMO
those people who have been traditionally interpreted as
being irrational (because DEMO probability match in the ab-
sence of patterns) would actually look DEMO when patterns
are present. Alternatively, if (ii) probability matching re-
DEMO from a lazy cognitive shortcut, as proposed by West
and Stanovich (2003), then it should not be related to ﬁnd-
ing patterns. DEMO studied a well-deﬁned shortcut that leads
to probability matching, ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”. This strat-
egy consists of repeating predictions if they were successful
in DEMO last trial, but changing them if they failed.
Moreover, we investigated how strategy use is related
to working memory capacity, which itself to some degree
reﬂects differences in strategic processing of information
(Cokely, Kelley, & Gilchrist, 2006). While pattern search
should go along with higher working memory capacity
(e.g., DeCaro, Thomas, & Beilock, 2008), relying on a cogni-
tive shortcut should go along with lower working DEMO
capacity, such as West and Stanovich (2003) propose.
2. Experiment DEMO
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Participants
Eighty people (44 female), mostly students, with an
average age of 24 years (SD = 4.06) participated DEMO the
study.
2.1.2. Design and procedure
The main task was to predict repeatedly whether a red
square would appear in the upper half of DEMO screen or a
green square in the lower half, similar to DEMO et al.
(2004). After 10 training trials, there were 576 trials alto-
gether, divided into halves of 288 trials. Participants earned
€ .01 for each correct trial in addition to a € 5 show-up DEMO
Every participant saw both a no-pattern and a pattern half,
the order of which was counterbalanced.
The no-pattern half consisted of 288 trials DEMO the binary
choice task without any pattern. That is, the sequence DEMO
events was serially independent. The probability of the
more common event was p = .67, while the probability of
the less common event was 1  p = .33.
The pattern half consisted of a pattern DEMO length 12, in
the sequence 001010001100. The probability of the more
DEMO event was thus also p = .67 (i.e., 8/12), while the
probability of the less common event was p = .33 (i.e., 4/
12). The pattern was repeated for 288 trials.

Between the halves, there was a short break and partic-
ipants were reminded that the second half could poten-
tially be different. To DEMO it easier to detect that
something was indeed different, the more DEMO event
was reversed between the two halves.1
An automated operation span task (Unsworth, Heitz,
Schrock, & Engle, 2005; cf. Conway et al., 2005) was admin-
istered before the main task to assess DEMO memory
capacity.
2.2. Results and discussion
For all participants, we counted DEMO often they pre-
dicted the more frequent event in the no-pattern half.
We will subsequently call this variable maximizing,as
it reﬂects the degree DEMO which someone is applying a
maximizing strategy. A value of 1 would reﬂect perfect
maximization (i.e., always predicting the more frequent
event), DEMO value of .67 would reﬂect probability matching,
and a value of .5 would reﬂect a guessing strategy.
2.2.1. Median split analyses
For each DEMO, we computed how close this par-
ticipant’s behavior was to probability DEMO by calcu-
lating the absolute difference between their degree of
maximizing and probability matching (i.e., .67) in the no-
pattern half. We divided participants into probability
matchers and non-matchers at their median proximity to
probability DEMO This median split was done sepa-
rately for each of the counterbalancing conditions, so that
there were 20 probability matchers and 20 non-matchers
each.
Based on this classiﬁcation in the no-pattern half, we
predicted that probability matchers would be more suc-
cessful in picking up the pattern than DEMO in
the pattern half. To investigate this, we looked at the DEMO
portion of trials where they made correct predictions in the
pattern half (pattern accuracy subsequently). The pattern
accuracy of probability matchers and non-matchers was
similar early in the pattern half. But over time, probability
matchers improved their accuracy more than non-match-
ers, suggesting that they were better able to pick up the
pattern (Fig. 1A). In a repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance, we included the within-subject factor block (DEMO
ing of the accuracy in three pattern blocks of 96 trials each)
and two between-subjects factors, probability matcher vs.
non-matcher and order of presentation. The growing sepa-
ration between probability matchers and non-matchers
was reﬂected DEMO the linear contrast between the factors

¼ :09. None of the interactions
including the factor order of presentation was substantial,
nor was its between-subjects effect.

2.2.2. Curvilinearity analyses
Median splits as used here can decrease statistical
power and introduce error (Irwin & McClelland, 2003). Fur-

thermore, by using the absolute distance to probability
matching, we have treated deviations from probability
matching in both directions (i.e., toward chance perfor-
mance and toward maximizing) identically. That is, we
have looked at a linear relation between proximity to prob-
ability matching in the no-pattern half and the ability to
DEMO up patterns in the pattern half.
However, if one does not DEMO proximity to probability
matching but the proportion of maximizing responses in
the no-pattern half as independent variable, then one
would predict a curvilinear relation to the ability to pick
up patterns. Namely, pattern ﬁnding should peak at prob-
ability matching level and drop both toward chance perfor-
mance DEMO toward maximizing.
Such a curvilinear trend was reﬂected in a quadratic
regression with the proportion of maximizing responses
in the no-pattern half as independent DEMO and accu-
racy in the last pattern block as dependent variable,
F(2, 77) = 2.63, p = .08, R2 = DEMO The linear regression only
accounted for less than 1% of the variance, F(1, 78) = 0.06,
p = .80, R2 DEMO .001. The linear contrast effect in the median
split analysis suggests that the improvement in pattern
accuracy differs between probability matchers and non-
matchers, as probability matchers started with about the
same accuracy as non-matchers, but ended up higher. Sim-
ilarly, the explained variance in the quadratic regression is
greater if instead of accuracy on the last pattern block the
DEMO between the ﬁrst and the last pattern block
is predicted, F(DEMO, 77) = 7.64, p = .001, R2 = .17 (DEMO 2A).
Again, the linear regression only accounted for 1% of DEMO
variance, F(1, 78) = 0.84, p = .36, DEMO = .01.2
2.2.3. Win-stay, lose-shift
As pointed out in the introduction, probability matching
can also result from a cognitive shortcut, namely a simple
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. This strategy predicts that
participants repeat predictions after successful trials, but
change them after failures.
For each participant, we calculated DEMO proportion of tri-
als in the no-pattern half that could be described by ‘‘win-
stay, lose-shift”. Participants using that strategy would also
end up probability matching, but we would not assume
that they are looking for patterns. Congruently, ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift” negatively correlated with pattern accuracy in
the last pattern block, r(38) = .37, p = .02, DEMO improve-
probability matchers (as deﬁned by the median split).ment across DEMO blocks, r(38) = .40, p = .01 among
We DEMO dichotomously classiﬁed participants as using
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” or not. We did DEMO by comparing the
ﬁt of ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” to the participants’ responses DEMO
2 In addition to the curvilinearity analyses on decision outcomes, we DEMO
ran similar analyses to predict response times. In Experiment 1, there DEMO a
curvilinear relation between maximizing and response times, indicating
that probability DEMO were both slower than maximizers and than
guessers, supporting the idea DEMO they were applying a more complex
strategy. The results from Experiment 2, however, were inconsistent with
these results. First of all, the relation between maximizing and response
times was linear rather than curvilinear – the DEMO the degree of
maximizing, the faster. More importantly even, working memory capacity
explained more variance in speed, with higher working memory going
along with faster response times, which was not the case in Experiment 1.

did not predict proximity to probability matching,

probability matchers with a lower working memory capac-
ity better, r(38) = .36, p = 0.02.
3. Experiment 2
Experiment 1 only employed one particular DEMO To
test whether the results would generalize to other pat-
terns, DEMO replicated the experiment but instead each par-
ticipant received a randomly generated pattern. We
expected, however, that random patterns could introduce
another source DEMO variability that could wash out the sys-
tematic relation between the strategy a person employs
and their ability to ﬁnd patterns. Whether or not DEMO
ﬁnd a pattern is not only a function of their strategy but
also of the difﬁculty of the pattern. For example, some pat-
terns could be so transparent that someone wedded to
maximizing could not miss DEMO Others could be so difﬁ-
cult that even a dedicated pattern searcher would not ﬁnd
them. To deal with this, we increased the number of partic-
ipants. Furthermore, as we did not predict any differences
between the two counterbalancing conditions, and as we
did not ﬁnd any differences in Experiment 1, we eliminated
one of the counterbalancing conditions; all DEMO
now started with the no-pattern half followed by the pat-
tern half.
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Participants
One-hundred and thirty-nine people (83 female),
DEMO students, with an average age of 24 years
(SD = 3.11) participated in the study.
3.1.2. Design and procedure
Design and procedure were identical to Experiment 1
with the following exceptions. Now all participants started
DEMO the no-pattern half followed by the pattern half. The
pattern half consisted of a pattern of length 12. This time,
the pattern was DEMO identical for each participant, but in-
stead each participant received a DEMO generated pat-
tern. The only restriction of the pattern was that the
probability of the more common event was again p = .67
(i.e., 8/12), while the probability of the less common event
was p = .33 (i.e., 4/12). The pattern was repeated DEMO 288
trials.
3.2. Results and discussion
The following analyses are identical to the major analy-
ses in Experiment 1, which are motivated and described in
detail in Experiment 1.
3.2.1. Median split analyses
Again, we divided participants into probability match-
ers and non-matchers at their median absolute distance
DEMO probability matching (i.e., .67) in the no-pattern half.
Based on DEMO classiﬁcation in the no-pattern half, we then
tried to predict how DEMO people were in ﬁnding the ran-
domly generated pattern in the pattern half.
5
In a repeated measures analysis of variance, we included
the within-subject factor block (consisting of the accuracy
in three pattern blocks of 96 trials each) and probability
matcher vs. non-matcher as between-subjects factor. This
time, there was no growing separation between probability
matchers and non-matchers, DEMO there was basically no lin-
ear contrast effect between the factors probability matcher
vs. non-matcher and block, F(1, 137) = 2.47, DEMO = .119,
gp2 ¼ :02. Instead, probability matchers were better than
non-matchers overall, reﬂected in a between-subjects ef-
fect for the factor probability matcher vs. non-matcher,
F(1, 137) = 7.08, p = .009, gp2 ¼ :05 (Fig. 1B). Individual t-
tests revealed that this difference held on all three blocks,
all ts > 2.10, all ps < .04, Cohen’s d ranging from 0.36 to 0.49.
3.2.2. Curvilinearity analyses
In Experiment 1, pattern accuracy was highest for peo-
ple closest to probability matching and dropped for people
whose predictive DEMO in the no-pattern half was clo-
ser to guessing or to maximizing. This shows up again: A
curvilinear trend was reﬂected in a quadratic regression
with the proportion of maximizing responses in the no-
pattern half DEMO independent variable and accuracy in the
last pattern block as dependent variable, F(2, 136) = 3.23,
p = .04, R2 DEMO .05. The linear regression only accounted for
less than 1% of the variance, F(1, 137) = 1.21, p = .27,
DEMO = .009. That there was no linear contrast effect in the
median split analysis in Experiment 2, contrary to Experi-
ment 1, suggests DEMO it is not so much the improvement
in pattern accuracy that differs between probability
matchers and non-matchers this time. Congruently,
although there was DEMO curvilinear trend reﬂected in a qua-
dratic regression when predicting the improvement be-
tween the ﬁrst and the last pattern block (such as in
Experiment 1), it was not stronger than predicting ﬁnal
pattern accuracy, F(2, 136) = 3.86, p = .02, R2 = DEMO
(Fig. 2B). Again, the linear regression was not substantial,
F(1, 137) = 0.22, p = .64, R2 = DEMO
3.2.3. Win-stay, lose-shift
In Experiment 1, we found that if participants are prob-
ability matching because they are relying on a ‘‘win-stay,
DEMO strategy, this made it less likely that they found
the pattern. DEMO in Experiment 1, the accordance of a partic-
ipant’s behavior with DEMO, lose-shift” among proba-
bility matchers (as deﬁned by the median split)
negatively correlated with pattern accuracy in the last pat-
tern block, r(73) = .28, p = .01, but not with improvement
across pattern blocks this time,Again, we dichotomously classiﬁed participants asr(73) = .14, p = .22.
using ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” or not, DEMO as in Experiment
1. Among probability matchers, 50.7% were classiﬁed as
DEMO ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”, compared to 51.6% of non-
matchers. Those probability matchers who used ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift” only achieved a ﬁnal pattern accuracy of DEMO,
compared to 94.0% of those who did not use ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift”, t(61.6) = 2.81, p = .007, d = DEMO

with accordance to ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”. This time, work-
ing DEMO capacity was not related to pattern accuracy

weakly DEMO to overall pattern accuracy,
r(137) = .15, p = .09. As in Experiment 1, it was not related
to proximity to probability matching per se, r(137) = .06,
p = DEMO This time, working memory capacity was not re-
lated to ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” among probability matchers,

4. General discussion
We showed differences between participants in their
tendencies to search for patterns. Predictive behavior more
closely in line with probability matching DEMO the absence of
a pattern was related to pattern accuracy when a pattern
was introduced in both experiments. At least for some peo-
ple, probability matching thus results from relentless
search for patterns. For them, probability matching is actu-
ally not a strategy per se, but rather the outcome of a more
complex search for patterns.
However, there were also probability matchers who did
not pick up regularities. We identiﬁed some of DEMO peo-
ple if their probability matching could be better described
by a ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. At least in Experiment
1, ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” went along with lower working
memory capacity. Although this relation to working mem-
DEMO capacity did not replicate in Experiment 2, we believe
it is DEMO to say ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” can be seen a cog-
nitive shortcut. DEMO is simple but at the cost of hindering pat-
tern detection in this setting. Still, this does not mean that
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” is DEMO a bad strategy, and it is
known to be very successful DEMO competitive situations such
as the prisoner’s dilemma game (Nowak & Sigmund, 1993).
Taken together, these results demonstrate the impor-
tance of looking beyond the outcome of decisions and to
the underlying strategies. Here, the same outcome, proba-
bility matching, is reached by some participants by DEMO sim-
ple ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. For others, however,
rather the opposite seems to be true. They can be described
as probability matching, because they are looking for pat-
terns rather than relying on cognitive DEMO
Lopes (1982) discussed the predisposition towards pat-
tern detection in a signal detection framework, arguing
that it can be seen as a liberal criterion to classify some-
thing as signal (i.e., generated by a DEMO process) in-
stead of noise (i.e., generated by a random DEMO).
Thereby, people limit the number of misses but increase
the DEMO of false alarms (cf. Kareev, 1995, for a similar
argument DEMO the detection of correlation). To con-
clusively evaluate the predisposition towards pattern
detection, one needs to consider the structure of the real
environment (Todd & Gigerenzer, 2007).
And regarding the natural environment, Pinker (1997, p.
346) speculated that patterns are ubiquitous: ‘‘Many
events DEMO like that. They have a characteristic life his-
tory, a changing DEMO of occurring over time.” Ayton
and Fischer (2004), cf. Ayton, Hunt, & Wright, 1989) have
pointed out that there are not many natural environments
where one can safely assume conditional independence of
a DEMO of events, except for casinos and psychology
laboratories. However, one can easily come up with exam-
ples where incorrectly assuming patterns although there
DEMO none can cause great harm. For example, people look
for trends DEMO patterns in investment decisions and often
pay too much attention to recent outcomes (Rieskamp,
2006). Additionally, one could argue that in DEMO current
experimental setting, participants could have employed a
maximizing strategy and DEMO the same time looked for pat-
terns, as feedback was independent DEMO choice. The results
indicate that this is not what people were doing, and this
is in line with typically observed differences between act-
ing and observing, which have been reported for maximiz-
ing in binary choice (Newell & Rakow, 2007) and for
recency effects (Rakow, Demes, & Newell, 2008). And
although maximizing and looking for patterns DEMO the same
time would be possible in this setting, in many DEMO envi-
ronments it would not be, because often feedback will de-
DEMO on choice.
Therefore, we refrain from ﬁnally evaluating the mis-
perception DEMO randomness and the resulting epiphenome-
non probability matching as rational or irrational. Still,
the results reported here illustrate the importance of con-
sidering DEMO structure of the environment when evaluating
behavior. What works poorly in one environment (here:
searching for patterns if there are none and ending up with
suboptimal probability matching) may work well in an-
other (DEMO: actually ﬁnding patterns if they do exist). Con-
trary to DEMO almost uniformly negative perception of
probability matching, we therefore conclude that DEMO
can be a potentially smart strategy behind probability
matching.
