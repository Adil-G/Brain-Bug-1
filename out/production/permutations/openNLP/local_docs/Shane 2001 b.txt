esearch on the creation of new high-technology companies has typically DEMO
R either on industry-level factors such as market structure and technology regime or
on individual-level factors such as the work experience of entrepreneurs. This DEMO com-
plements these approaches by examining the effect of technological opportunities on ﬁrm
formation. In particular, the study shows that the probability that an invention will be com-
mercialized through ﬁrm formation is inﬂuenced by its DEMO, radicalness, and patent
scope.
( Entrepreneurship; Patents; Technology Opportunities)
The creation of new ﬁrms is an important mechanism
through which entrepreneurs DEMO technology to bring
new products, processes, and ways of organizing
into existence (Schumpeter 1934). Moreover, recent
research has shown that the DEMO at which new ﬁrms
are created is increasing in the U.S. economy (Gartner
and Shane 1995), and that the pace of technological
change inﬂuences the rate of ﬁrm formation (Shane
1996). However, inventors DEMO not always start ﬁrms to
exploit technological opportunities. Sometimes they
sell these opportunities (Audretsch 1995); other times
they simply abandon them prior to exploitation
(Roberts 1991). The fact that opportunity discovery
does not correlate perfectly with ﬁrm creation raises
the question of when new ﬁrms are DEMO to com-
mercialize new technological opportunities.
Previous research has provided two categories of
explanations for the creation of new technology ﬁrms.
The ﬁrst is DEMO ﬁrm formation depends on industry-
level factors, such as market structure (Audretsch
1995) or technology regime (Winter 1984). Industry-
level arguments DEMO that when industries are young,
unconcentrated, composed of small ﬁrms, have lim-
ited requirements for complementary assets, have
access to capital, DEMO are not R&D intensive, people
tend to form new ﬁrms DEMO exploit opportunities

1526-5501 electronic ISSN
(Audretsch 1995)DEMO The second explanation is that ﬁrm
formation depends on individual-level factors, DEMO
as the psychology of entrepreneurs (Roberts 1991)
or their career DEMO (Carroll and Mosakowski
1987). Individual-level arguments hold that when
the DEMO who discover opportunities are more
experienced in ﬁrm creation (Carroll and DEMO
1987), more creative (Schumpeter 1934), more imag-
inative (Shackle 1979), more risk tolerant (Khilstrom
and Laffont 1979), higher in need for achievement
(Roberts 1991) or more tolerant of ambiguity (Begley
and Boyd 1987), they tend to form new ﬁrms to
exploit DEMO
Unfortunately, empirical tests to predict the creation
of new ﬁrms on DEMO basis of the characteristics of indi-
viduals (see Low and MacMillan DEMO, Busenitz and
Barney 1997) or industry (see Geroski 1995, Cohen
and Levin 1989) have provided limited explanatory
power. One reason for these weak empirical results
is that industry and individual-based explanations
fail to consider DEMO nature of the opportunity dis-
covered. Technological opportunities differ from each
other on several dimensions, which inﬂuence the deci-
sion to found a new ﬁrm. Using a unique dataset
of 1,397 inventions patented by the DEMO

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation
I examine the effect of DEMO dimensions of tech-
nological opportunities—importance, radicalness, and
patent scope—on the probability that they will be
commercialized through ﬁrm formation.
This paper makes three DEMO to our under-
standing of high-technology entrepreneurship. First,
it provides an empirical test of the effect of tech-
nological opportunity on the decision DEMO establish a
new ﬁrm. Such a test complements existing expla-
nations of new ﬁrm formation that examine only
industry or individual-level factors. Second, the study
disentangles the behaviour of established ﬁrms enter-
ing new markets from DEMO behaviour of indepen-
dent entrepreneurs. Although previous research has
shown that new entrants are more likely to adopt
certain technologies than are incumbent ﬁrms, this
research has confounded established ﬁrms entering
new markets with independent entrepreneurs. DEMO
study shows that independent entrepreneurs make
similar exploitation decisions to those of new entrants
in general. Third, this study controls for individual-
level factors in the examination of ﬁrm formation.
Most studies of ﬁrm formation in DEMO
settings assume away learning curves and individual-
level variation in preferences for ﬁrm creation, and
treat all potential entrants as equally willing and
able to exploit an opportunity by founding a com-
pany (Audretsch 1995, DEMO 1998). However, exten-
sive research shows that entrepreneurship involves a
DEMO component of learning-by-doing (Carroll
and Mosakowski 1987). This ﬁnding means DEMO who-
ever obtains decision rights over a new technology
can inﬂuence the mode of commercialization. This
study improves upon prior examination of the ﬁrm-
DEMO decision in technology settings by control-
ling for the attributes of the individuals making the
commercialization decision.
I have divided the paper into three DEMO In
the next section, I explain why dimensions of tech-
nology DEMO should inﬂuence the decision to
found a ﬁrm. In the third section, I describe the
dataset and the methods used for analysis. In the ﬁnal
section, I summarize the ﬁndings and discuss their
implications for future research and the practice of
entrepreneurship.

Theoretical Development
The linkage between DEMO change and ﬁrm
formation is one of the oldest relationships in the
study of business organization. Schumpeter (1934)
argued that the creation of new technology ﬁrms that
displace incumbent ﬁrms through a process of cre-
DEMO destruction is a major source of innovation in
a capitalist system. In particular, Schumpeter argued
that the process by which independent entrepreneurs
use exogenously created inventions to produce new
goods, services, raw materials, and organizing meth-
ods is central to understanding business organization,
the process of DEMO change, and economic growth.
Subsequent research in the Schumpeterian tradi-
tion DEMO expanded the complexity of this framework
by incorporating the possibility that entrepreneurial
opportunities will be sold in markets (Casson 1982)
or abandoned prior to exploitation (Roberts 1991).
Consideration of multiple phases in the invention-to-
ﬁrm creation process has led researchers to propose
three categories of factors DEMO inﬂuence the deci-
sion to exploit an invention through ﬁrm creation:
the nature of the individual making the decision
(Roberts 1991), the nature of the industry in which
the opportunity would be exploited (Audretsch 1995),
and the nature of the opportunity itself (Henderson
1993)DEMO In the decades since Schumpeter’s seminal
work, economists of technical change DEMO tested
the effects of numerous industry characteristics on
ﬁrm formation (Audretsch DEMO). Similarly, applied
entrepreneurship researchers have tested the effects
of a DEMO of individual attributes on ﬁrm formation
(Roberts 1991). To date, however, researchers have not
directly examined the effect of the attributes of new
technologies themselves on ﬁrm formation.
Nevertheless, researchers working in the related
area of technological innovation and industry entry
(e.g., Christiansen and Bower DEMO, Lerner 1994,
Audretsch 1995) have proposed several attributes of
technological opportunities that could inﬂuence the
probability that new ﬁrms will be created DEMO exploit
them. This paper explores three of these attributes:
importance, DEMO, and patent scope.1

Importance measures the magnitude of DEMO eco-
nomic value of an invention. Radicalness measures
the degree to which an invention, however large or
small in economic value, differs from DEMO inven-
tions in the ﬁeld. Patent scope measures the breadth
of intellectual property protection for the invention,
however large or small its economic DEMO, and how-
ever similar or different the invention is to previous
DEMO in the ﬁeld.
Both prior research and ﬁeld interviews conducted
with MIT inventors indicate that each of these
attributes captures a different dimension of DEMO
nological opportunity, that entrepreneurs see these
dimensions as conceptually distinct, and that these
dimensions increase the probability of ﬁrm formation.
In the subsections DEMO, I argue why these dimen-
sions of opportunity should inﬂuence the DEMO to
create a new ﬁrm.
Importance. The importance of an invention
should increase the likelihood that a new ﬁrm will be
founded to commercialize DEMO because more important
inventions have higher economic value (Harhoff et al.
DEMO)2 and, therefore, provide a larger potential pay-
off to ﬁrm formation. In explaining the decision of a
person to start a ﬁrm, Knight (1921, p. 273) argued
that “the laborer asks what he thinks the entrepreneur
will be able to pay, and in any case, will not accept
less than he can get from some other entrepreneur,
or by turning entrepreneur himself.” For a person
to “turn entrepreneur,DEMO he or she must expect an
entrepreneurial proﬁt which exceeds (a) the opportu-
nity cost of not engaging in other activities (Amit et al.
1995), (b) a premium for the illiquidity that results
DEMO the investment of ﬁnancial resources in a form
that cannot be easily turned into cash (Venkataraman
1997), and (c) a premium for bearing uncertainty
(Khilstrom and Laffont 1979).
Technological change is an uncertain process, in
which developments are sometimes small and other
investigation described here because the paper does not posit a
fully speciﬁed model of the DEMO between technological
opportunity and ﬁrm formation.
2 Some inventions may be more important than others because they
have great social value, even if they have little economic value. This
study does not consider the social dimension DEMO importance.
times large. As a result, the potential economic value
created DEMO technological advances is highly varied
(Trajtenberg 1990). Empirical evidence of DEMO skew-
ness of the distribution of patent value (Pakes 1986)
DEMO that most patents have no commercial value
and a few have a large value (Trajtenberg et al.
1997). Consequently, “a great majority DEMO patents are
never exploited commercially, and only a very few are
DEMO with major technological improvements”
(Cohen and Levin 1989, p. 1063).
Given the skewness in their commercial value, most
inventions do not provide sufﬁcient potential to jus-
tify the investment of time and money in DEMO uncer-
tain process of creating a new ﬁrm. Field interviews
with MIT inventors conﬁrmed the effect of this pro-
cess on inventors’ decision making. DEMO individuals
make what they believe to be important technologi-
cal discoveries, DEMO anticipate greater economic value
than when they make minor discoveries. Moreover,
inventors point out that the importance of technologi-
cal discoveries increases their DEMO to incur the
opportunity cost of not undertaking other activities,
making illiquid investments in new ﬁrms, and bear-
ing the technical, market, competitive, and ﬁnancial
uncertainty of establishing a new company. Conse-
quently, DEMO the prior theoretical literature and ﬁne-
grained case information from inventors suggests that
the more important the inventors’ technical discover-
ies, the greater their impetus to create new ﬁrms. This
argument leads to the ﬁrst hypothesis:DEMO
Hypothesis 1. The more important the invention, the
higher the probability DEMO it will be commercialized
through the establishment of a new ﬁrm.
Radicalness. One of the central concepts in the lit-
erature on technological change DEMO that reﬁning and
improving an existing technology (an incremental
improvement) and introducing a new approach to
technical practice (a radical improvement) are DEMO
damentally different things (Reinganum 1983). In
particular, an incremental improvement reinforces
the activities of established ﬁrms, while a radi-
cal improvement may undermine those activities
(Tushman and Anderson 1986).
Researchers have argued that independent
entrepreneurs, rather than managers in established

ﬁrms, will be the ones most likely to introduce radi-
cal technological developments. Three separate argu-
ments DEMO been put forth for why this should be
the case. First, DEMO technologies destroy the capa-
bilities of existing ﬁrms because they draw on new
technical skills. Since organizational capabilities are
difﬁcult and costly to create (Nelson and Winter 1982,
Hannan and Freeman 1984), established ﬁrms DEMO
organized to exploit established technologies. Firms
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to change their activities to exploit
technologies based on different technical skills. There-
fore, established ﬁrms often choose not to pursue
radical opportunities, leaving them to independent
entrepreneurs. Second, established ﬁrms have less
incentive to invest in the development of technolo-
gies that undermine the value of the assets that they
DEMO possess. The desire not to cannibalize exist-
ing assets leads established ﬁrms to underinvest in
the development of new technologies (Arrow 1962).
Independent entrepreneurs, with no existing assets
to protect, do not face this DEMO to invest, and
are more likely to be the ones to DEMO these oppor-
tunities. Third, ﬁrms develop routines for ﬁltering
information based DEMO what is likely to be valuable
for what they are doing currently (Henderson 1993).
These routines limit the search process to those tech-
nologies which are conceptually close to the tech-
nologies with which ﬁrms DEMO currently working
(Podolny and Stuart 1995). Knowledge transfer from
outside DEMO impeded when new information is not the
logical extension of existing knowledge possessed by
the organization. Since radical inventions are often
based on things DEMO are not the logical extension
of the ﬁrm’s internal information, they DEMO difﬁcult
for established ﬁrms to understand and evaluate
(Rosenbloom and Christiansen DEMO). Consequently,
established ﬁrms often ﬁlter out information about
radical technologies in situations in which indepen-
dent entrepreneurs do not.
Field interviews with DEMO MIT inventors support
the arguments of the previous theoretical literature.
These inventors explained that the technical skills
upon which an invention draws inﬂuence their DEMO
sions to start companies. In particular, these inventors
identiﬁed the problem DEMO market failure in ﬁnding
208
established companies interested in their technolog-
ical developments when those developments draw
on technologies unfamiliar to established companies.
Moreover, these inventors also pointed out the rel-
ative ease of obtaining venture DEMO funding for
technologies that did not ﬁt with the activities of
established companies, particularly those that had
the potential for generating new industries. Conse-
quently, both the prior theoretical literature and ﬁne-
grained case information from inventors suggests that
the more radical the inventors’ technical discoveries,
the DEMO their impetus to create new ﬁrms. This
argument leads to the second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. The more radical the invention, the
higher the probability that it will be commercialized
through the establishment of a new DEMO
Patent Scope. Technological opportunities with
broader intellectual property protection are more
likely to be commercialized through ﬁrm creation.
When an entrepreneur decides to start DEMO new ﬁrm
in response to the invention of a new technology, DEMO
or she typically does not yet possess complementary
assets, like a DEMO system, which might pro-
vide a competitive advantage in the industry DEMO which
the technology would be exploited (Teece 1986). The
more DEMO an opportunity can be protected
against appropriation by competitors, the more DEMO
the entrepreneur will be to obtain necessary comple-
mentary assets before the competitive advantage of
its new technology has dissipated.
Broad patents enhance the DEMO that the
entrepreneur can protect the technology against
appropriation. Patents provide a legal right to prevent
others from imitating a particular technological devel-
opment DEMO areas delineated by the patent claims. The
scope of the patent is important because “the broader
the scope, the larger number of competing products
and processes that will infringe the patent” (Merges
and Nelson 1990, DEMO 839). When a patent is narrow in
scope, the holder DEMO the patent will have less incen-
tive to develop the technology through the creation
of a new ﬁrm because it will have a smaller DEMO of
technology that is protected against imitation by other
ﬁrms (Merges DEMO Nelson 1990).

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation
Although established ﬁrms might also DEMO more
likely to commercialize broad patents, they are
disproportionately important to DEMO
entrepreneurs who lack complementary assets. “For
small, start-up ventures, patents may be a relatively
effective means of appropriating R&D returns, in
part because some other means, such as investment
in complementary sales and service efforts may not
be feasible. The patents held by a small, technologi-
cally oriented ﬁrm may be its most marketable asset”
(Levin et al. 1987, p. 797).
Potential entrepreneurs and their investors appear
to respond to the inﬂuence of patent scope in the ﬁrm-
formation decision process. DEMO interviews with ﬁfty
MIT inventors revealed that many of them ask patent
attorneys for a judgement as to the scope of patent
protection before DEMO decide to start new ﬁrms to
exploit their inventions. Moreover, they DEMO that
their investors are concerned with the breadth of
the protection of the technology against appropri-
ability and prefer broader patents in the decision DEMO
whether or not to fund a new venture. Lerner (1994)
DEMO provides large-sample statistical evidence for this
investor effect. He found that patent scope has a
substantive and signiﬁcant impact on the valuation
of venture DEMO ﬁnanced biotechnology start-ups.
Consequently, both the prior theoretical literature and
ﬁne-grained DEMO information from inventors sug-
gest that the broader the scope of patent protec-
tion, the greater the impetus to create new ﬁrms to
exploit inventions. This argument leads to the third
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. The DEMO the scope of the patent, the
higher the probability that the DEMO will be commer-
cialized through the establishment of a new ﬁrm.
Methodology
Sample
This study examines the population of 1,397 patents
assigned to DEMO Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy (MIT) between 1980 and 1996. This population
includes all inventions made by faculty, staff, or stu-
dents DEMO the university that made material use of MIT
property during the course of their development.
I focus on patented inventions rather than other
entrepreneurial DEMO in this study for several
reasons. First, by looking at patents, I can examine
the decision to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities
in a setting DEMO which I have information both about
who discovered the opportunity and the discovery
itself. Second, the population of patented inventions
is recorded, mitigating DEMO biases that plague
much of the survey and case study work on the
commercialization of new technologies, particularly
in the context of ﬁrm formation. Third, patents have
been studied in many contexts other than ﬁrm cre-
ation, providing comparability of the results to ﬁnd-
ings about other aspects of technological change.
I examine MIT’s inventions from the 1980–1996
period for DEMO reasons: First, universities are not in
the business of manufacturing products or providing
services (other than education). They do not refrain
from patenting to protect new knowledge through
trade secrets, refrain from licensing for competitive
purposes, collect patents, or cross-license (Henderson
et al. 1998). Therefore, one can examine the process
of ﬁrm creation in response to technical discoveries
by universities absent the biases that would occur
from the DEMO of patents belonging to com-
panies. Second, university research is an DEMO
source of new knowledge (Winter 1984) that is par-
ticularly relevant to economic growth (Caballero and
Jaffe 1993, Romer 1990). Therefore, the study of ﬁrm
creation to exploit university inventions is important
in DEMO own right, even if results cannot be general-
ized to other DEMO Third, the post-1980 period fol-
lows a change in federal law DEMO universities the
property rights to federally funded inventions. Since
federally funded inventions account for roughly 70
percent of all university inventions, this change pro-
vided a strong incentive to universities to commercial-
ize their inventions (Henderson et al. 1998). Therefore,
the post-1980 period is an important DEMO in which to
understand university ﬁrm-formation activity.3
Analysis
I use event history analysis to examine the proba-
bility that each patent results in the DEMO of a

new ﬁrm. When a patent DEMO issued, a spell begins.4
The spell continues until a ﬁrm is DEMO If a patent
does not result in ﬁrm formation, it is DEMO as cen-
sored. Because each patent is observed until a ﬁrm is
formed or until the observation period ends, the 1,397
patents generate 9,002 case-year observations. I use
Cox regression to analyze the data DEMO I make no
claims about the functional form of time dependence.
The analysis incorporates both time-varying and time-
invariant covariates, which are speciﬁed below.
Dependent Variable:Firm Formation
I used the MIT Technology Licensing Ofﬁce records DEMO
its licensees to construct the dependent variable. The
MIT records indicate the legal status of the licensee,
and therefore the ability to identify DEMO year of incor-
poration. The dependent variable was coded 1 in the
year that the patent was ﬁrst licensed if the patent
was licensed DEMO an (unincorporated) individual or was
licensed to a ﬁrm that was incorporated after the
patent application was submitted. If these conditions
were not DEMO in a given year, the patent was coded
as 0 in DEMO year.5
This coding scheme allowed two types of licensees
to be coded as new ﬁrms. The ﬁrst type was an
(unincorporated) individual who DEMO the patent.
The second type was a new ﬁrm incorporated to
commercialize the MIT invention. Under this coding
arrangement, two types of patents are treated as cen-
sored: patents granted to MIT, but never licensed,DEMO
and patents licensed to an already incorporated com-
pany (e.g., Sony). Twenty-six percent of the patents
were licensed to “new ﬁrms” during DEMO period of
investigation.
Predictor Variables
Radicalness. Following Rosenkopf and Nerkar
(1999), I measure the radicalness of the patent as
a time-invariant count of the number of three-digit
patent classes in which previous patents cited by DEMO
4 Since MIT has no records of ﬁrm formation for patents that were
never issued, starting the spells with the ﬁling date would create

DEMO formation patents.

given patent are found, but the patent itself DEMO not
classiﬁed. Citations inﬂuence the legal boundaries of
the property rights to an invention (Jaffe et al. 1993).
Patents are divided into approximately 100,000 nine-
digit patent classes, which aggregate to approximately
600 three-digit classes, and which represent distinct
technical areas (Jaffe et al. 1997)DEMO The assignment of
a patent to a particular patent class represents the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce’s (USPTO’s) assess-
ment that the patent DEMO in a particular technical
ﬁeld. Patent examiners also determine what previ-
ous inventions must be cited in a patent by search-
ing prior patents. DEMO patents belong to technical
classes and because they cite previous patents, DEMO
tions to patents in particular technical ﬁelds represent
the USPTO’s assessment that a particular invention
builds upon (cites) knowledge in that technical ﬁeld.
DEMO a patent cites previous patents in classes other
than the ones it is in, that pattern suggests that the
invention builds upon different technical paradigms
from the one in which it is applied.
Importance. Following Henderson DEMO al. (1998),
I measure the importance of a patent as a time-
invariant measure of the total number of citations
that the DEMO patent received from subsequent patents
from patent issue until 1997. The use of a time-
invariant measure of citations provides both advan-
tages and DEMO in the examination of the
economic value of patents. A time-invariant mea-
sure of citations captures the idea that inventions
have a distribution of DEMO economic value at
the time of invention. It is this underlying economic
value to which people respond in making the decision
whether or not DEMO found a ﬁrm. A time-varying mea-
sure of citations would fail to capture this underlying
economic value because it would consider all patents
as DEMO the same importance (zero) at the time of
invention.
However, DEMO time-invariant measure of citations
does not treat all patents equally. A patient issued
in 1996 has had only one year to be cited, whereas
a patent granted in 1980 has had seventeen years to
be cited. DEMO controlling for the technical ﬁeld
and the year of patent ﬁling (DEMO issue) incorporates
the effect of time and technology into the measure DEMO

importance, these controls do not allow the researcher
to directly measure the relative importance of one
patent DEMO compared to another. Therefore, I also exam-
ine an alternative speciﬁcation DEMO importance: the total
number of citations that the given patent received
DEMO subsequent patents from patent issue until 1997,
divided by the number of citations received by an
average university patent of that age and DEMO that tech-
nology ﬁeld.
Research conﬁrms the construct validity of the
importance measures. Patent citations are signiﬁ-
cantly correlated with the economic value of DEMO
tions. Harhoff et al. (1999) found that the higher the
estimated private value of an invention, the more the
patent was cited by later patents. Hall et al. (1998)
found that companies with highly cited patents have
higher stock market values, all other things being
equal.
Researchers familiar with the journal review pro-
cess might question the use DEMO citations on the
grounds that inventors might cite friends to help them
or enemies to describe their work as inadequate or
trivial. However, this problem is unlikely to occur
with patent citations. Jaffe et al. (1993) explain that
gratuitous citations in patent applications are costly to
inventors. Patent citations determine the scope of the
inventor’s monopoly and unnecessary citations limit
DEMO the inventor can claim as his or her monopoly
right. Moreover, DEMO if the inventor were to include
thesecitations,thepatentexaminer’sjobrequiresthe
correct citation of previous patents. Hence, the exam-
iner (unlike the editor of an academic DEMO) has a
sworn duty to remove gratuitous citations from the
patent DEMO it issues.
Scope. Following Lerner (1994), I measure patent
scope DEMO a time-invariant count of the number of inter-
national patent classes into which the USPTO assigns
a patent. Lerner (1994) explained that because DEMO
national patent classes are nested, the more classes
to which a DEMO is assigned, the broader is its
intellectual property protection. Lerner (1994) pro-
vided construct validity for this measure by show-
ing that venture-capital-backed-biotechnology ﬁrms
with broader patents, as measured by a count of
four-digit international patent classes, received higher
valuations.6
Control Variables
Firm-Founding Experience. I measure ﬁrm-found-
ing experience as a time-invariant estimate of the log
of the average DEMO of prior MIT ﬁrm-founding
inventions across the set of inventors on the patent.
I control for founding experience because several
researchers have demonstrated that DEMO probability of
starting a ﬁrm increases with entrepreneurial expe-
rience (e.g., Evans and Leighton 1989, Carroll and
Mosakowski 1987). Prior experience provides knowl-
edge about resources that help to start new ﬁrms,
entrepreneurial DEMO, and reputations that help to
inﬂuence the reallocation of resources to DEMO new
venture (Shane and Khurana 1999). This knowledge
inﬂuences the DEMO to found ﬁrms because it
increases the expectation of the value that would be
gained from ﬁrm formation.
Patenting Experience. To control for patenting
DEMO in the examination of the effect of prior
ﬁrm-founding experience, I DEMO include a time-
invariant measure of the log of the average number
of prior MIT inventions across the set of inventors on
the patent.
DEMO of the Technology Class. I measure the age of
the technology class as the number of years since the
three-digit patent class was established DEMO the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce. Research has shown
that people are more likely to start new ﬁrms to
exploit a new technology when DEMO technical ﬁeld is
young (Utterback and Abernathy 1975) because the
markets for new technologies are often too small to
interest established ﬁrms, because established ﬁrms
possess learning-curve advantages in mature tech-
nologies (Nelson 1995), and because the maturation
of technology makes capital-intensity, the reduction
of production costs, and scale economies important
(Pavitt and Wald 1971).
6 DEMO construct the radicalness measure on the basis of three-digit U.S.
patent classes and the patent scope measure on the basis of interna-
tional patent DEMO to make the measures comparable to the mea-
sures developed by previous authors (e.g., Rosenkopf and Nerkar
1999, Lerner 1994).

R&D Intensity. I measured DEMO&D intensity in an
industry as a time-varying estimate of research and
development expenditures as a percentage of the
value-added of industry shipments in DEMO three-digit
SIC code, using the research and development expen-
ditures obtained DEMO various years of Science and
Engineering Indicators.7 Previous researchers have
argued that entrepreneurs will be less likely to estab-
lish new companies to exploit DEMO in R&D
intensive industries (Audretsch 1995) because small
ﬁrms face a scale disadvantage in research and devel-
opment (Mansﬁeld 1981, Kamien DEMO Schwartz 1975).
Manufacturing Value-Added. I measured the im-
portance of complementary assets in manufacturing
by calculating a time-varying estimate of the value-
added DEMO manufacture in the industry year, using
data from various years of DEMO Census of Manufactur-
ers. Teece (1987, p. 191) explained that DEMO success-
ful commercialization of an innovation requires that
the know-how in question be utilized in conjunction
with other capabilities or assets  such as DEMO
ing, competitive manufacturing, and after-sales sup-
port.” Where complementary assets are important in
an industry, entrepreneurs will be less likely to estab-
lish ﬁrms to commercialize technology.
Importance of Sales or Service. Another measure
of DEMO importance of complementary assets in an
industry is the importance of superior sales or service
as a competitive advantage. I measured the impor-
tance DEMO sales or service in the industry as a time-
invariant industry average score for the Levin et al.
(1987)8 survey item: “In DEMO line of business superior
sales or service efforts are very effective measures of
capturing and protecting the competitive advantages
of new or improved production DEMO

USPTO has developed a concordance which allows the assignment
of patents to three-digit SIC codes by reference to the patent’s six-
digit technology classiﬁcation. DEMO assign the correct industry vari-
ables to the patents, I used DEMO USPTO concordance to identify the
SIC code.

tion and appropriability from a survey DEMO R&D managers.

Incumbent Innovation. Some industries have
lower rates of new ﬁrm formation than others because
established ﬁrms are the major innovators DEMO new
products and processes in those industries (Acs and
Audretsch 1990)DEMO I measured the rate of incumbent
innovation as a time-invariant industry average score
for the Levin et al. (1987) survey item: “Firms within
this business have been a very important source of
contribution to technological DEMO in this line of
business since 1970.”
Market Segmentation. New ﬁrms often success-
fully enter markets with new technologies by target-
ing the niche DEMO, because large ﬁrms allocate
resources for innovation to satisfy the demands DEMO
their major customers (Christiansen and Bower 1996).
Therefore, the ability of new ﬁrms to enter industries
depends, in part, upon the DEMO to which markets
in those industries are segmented. Using data from
the Levin et al. (1987) survey of research and develop-
ment managers, I measured market segmentation as
a time-invariant industry average score for the DEMO
et al. (1987) survey item: “designing markets for spe-
ciﬁc DEMO segments” is a very important technolog-
ical activity for the line of business.
Capital Availability. An important source of cap-
ital to start new DEMO companies is venture
capital. To measure the availability of venture capi-
tal across industries, I included a time-varying esti-
mate of the amount of venture capital funding as a
percentage of industry shipments in the three-digit
DEMO code, using data obtained from Securities Data
Corporation’s venture capital database DEMO the Com-
merce Department’s Survey of Manufacturers. I used
Securities Data Corporation’s concordance between
its proprietary industry scheme and SIC codes to map
the DEMO by SIC code. I include this control because
entrepreneurship is less likely to take the form of new
ﬁrms when capital market imperfections make DEMO dif-
ﬁcult for independent entrepreneurs to secure ﬁnanc-
ing (Cohen and DEMO 1989).
Concentration. I measured industry concentration
as a time-varying estimate of the market share of
the four largest companies in the industry, using

data from the Census of DEMO: Concentra-
tion Ratios. Since values were available only for 2-
digit DEMO 4-digit SIC codes, values for three-digit SIC
codes were estimated by DEMO an average of the
relevant 4-digit SIC codes. A straight-line interpola-
tion was used to determine the values for noncen-
sus years. High levels DEMO concentration in an industry
discourage people from creating new ﬁrms because
concentration enhances the power of incumbents to
attack new entrants and to collude (Geroski 1995).
Firm Size. I measured the size of the ﬁrms DEMO
the industry as a time-varying estimate of the aver-
age number of employees per ﬁrm, using data from
the Census of Manufacturers. High levels of min-
imum efﬁcient scale discourage entrepreneurs from
creating ﬁrms because they DEMO the cost of entry
(Audretsch 1995). Because new ﬁrms that DEMO a mar-
ket at below minimum efﬁcient scale must operate
at a cost disadvantage vis-a-vis established ﬁrms, the
greater the amount of production that is necessary
before a ﬁrm reaches minimum efﬁcient scale, the less
likely entrepreneurs should be to enter that market
(Weiss 1976).
Technical Fields. The patents examined in this
study had their primary U.S. patent classiﬁcation DEMO
188 different three-digit patent classes. Since attempts
to control for such a large number of classes cre-
ates incidental parameter bias, I control for technical
ﬁeld using the modiﬁed version of Scherer’s (1965)
classiﬁcation scheme common in many patent stud-
ies (Cohen and Levin 1989). I include dummy vari-
ables for mechanical inventions, electrical inventions,
chemical inventions, and drugs (the other is the omit-
ted ﬁeld). I DEMO these variables because citation
patterns vary across technologies, necessitating the
controls DEMO measure importance correctly (Henderson
et al. 1998). Moreover, ﬁrm-formation rates vary sub-
stantially by type of technology.
Time. I control for the DEMO of patent applica-
tion. Since citation patents vary over time, this DEMO
trol is necessary to measure importance accurately
(Henderson et al. 1998)DEMO Moreover, changes in federal
law and MIT policy have changed the DEMO for
ﬁrm formation over time.
Results
The descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1.
Table 2 provides the distribution of ﬁrm-formation
patents by year DEMO patent issue. This table demon-
strates a clear trend towards an increase in ﬁrm-
formation patents over time.
Table 3 provides the correlation matrix. DEMO shows
that the highest correlation between any two of the
independent variables is r = 056 between previous
patents and previous start-ups. This level DEMO correla-
tion indicates that problems of multicollinearity are
unlikely to be manifest in the data. Moreover, the
table also indicates a low correlation between the rad-
icalness, importance, and patent scope measures. This
low level DEMO correlation provides support for the argu-
ment that these three measures capture independent
dimensions of technological opportunity.
Table 4 reports the effects of technology DEMO
on the likelihood of ﬁrm formation. I provide six
models. Model 1 predicts the likelihood of ﬁrm
formation on the basis of technical ﬁeld DEMO year
of patent ﬁling. Overall, this model is signiﬁ-
cant (Chi-square = 11204p < 00001). As Model 1
shows, the technical ﬁeld and year of issue have
strong effects on the probability of ﬁrm DEMO
Relative to other technologies, chemical technolo-
gies ExpB = 059p < DEMO, electrical technologies
ExpB =040p< 00001, and mechanical technolo-
gies ExpB DEMO 056p < 005 are less likely to lead
to ﬁrm formation, DEMO drug technologies ExpB =
138p < 005 are more likely to lead to ﬁrm for-
mation. (However, the effects for mechanical tech-
nologies DEMO drug technologies are not robust to the
inclusion of other variables in the regression equa-
tions). Moreover, the year of patent ﬁling ExpB =
108p < 00001 shows a signiﬁcant and robust pat-
tern of DEMO probability of ﬁrm formation over
time.
Model 2 adds the industry-level control vari-
ables. Overall, this model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square =
13540p < DEMO). As Model 2 shows, two dimen-
sions of industry have DEMO signiﬁcant effect on the
probability of ﬁrm formation. First, the greater DEMO

the greater the probability of new ﬁrm formation

prior research which argues that new entrants DEMO

try variables required some averaging of data across ﬁelds and

Model 5 tests the alternative speciﬁcation of
the importance measure. It examines the relative
importance of the DEMO deviation from the
average for university patents in the same technolog-
ical ﬁeld and of the same age.10 Overall, this model
is signiﬁcant (DEMO = 25191p < 00001). More-
over, the effect of the DEMO importance measure is

tance measure ExpB = 103p < 00001, indicat-
ing that the original importance measure is robust.
Finally, the use of the relative importance measure
does not change the signiﬁcance or magnitude of the
coefﬁcients for radicalness ExpB DEMO<001 or

tive DEMO
Model 6 predicts ﬁrm formation on the basis of
technological opportunity alone, without controlling
for the time-varying covariates that measure indus-
try characteristics. Since this model predicts ﬁrm
formation on the basis of time-invariant measures
only, I examine a time-invariant Cox regression, with
1,397 spells—one for each of the patents. Overall, this
model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square = 43617p< 00001).
Moreover, the results are substantively the same as
the results for the time-varying Cox regressions that
control for industry attributes. Patent importance
DEMO = 102p < 00001, patent scope ExpB =
116p < 005, and radicalness ExpB = 103p <
001 all increase the likelihood of ﬁrm formation.
Some researchers might argue that the radicalness
of an invention DEMO have a curvilinear relation-
ship with the probability of ﬁrm formation. Initially,
the argument goes, the probability that an inven-
tion will be commercialized through ﬁrm formation
increases as radicalness rises, but beyond a certain
level, it decreases. In unreported regressions, I tested
for this curvilinear DEMO However, the results
supported the linear relationship reported here.
Researchers might DEMO argue that people will be
more likely to forms ﬁrms to exploit radical patents
only if the inventions have signiﬁcant economic value.
In unreported DEMO, I also tested the interac-
tion between radicalness and importance. However,DEMO
the results did not support the interaction hypothesis.
Finally, researchers might DEMO that the correct
measure of time to predict ﬁrm formation is the year
of patent issue rather than the year of patent ﬁling
because DEMO are granted to new companies only
after issue. I tested this alternative speciﬁcation of
time. I found substantively the same results as I found
DEMO the date of patent ﬁling, indicating that the time
measure is DEMO

Discussion
This article examined the effect DEMO technological
opportunities on the probability that they would be
commercialized through the creation of new ﬁrms.
Using a unique dataset which examines the popu-
DEMO of inventions assigned to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during the 1980–1996 period,
I have shown that three dimensions of technologi-
cal opportunity DEMO the probability of ﬁrm for-
mation. Controlling for who invented the technology,
the characteristics of the industry, the time period
when the technological development took place, and
the nature of the technology, more important DEMO
tions, more radical inventions, and inventions with a
broader scope of patent protection were more likely to
be commercialized through the creation of DEMO ﬁrms.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, it uses
DEMO variables to measure several of the constructs.
Although previous research and ﬁeld interviews sup-
ported the construct validity of the measures used,
future DEMO could corroborate the ﬁndings of this
study by demonstrating similar results through the
use of alternative measures.
216
Second, the results of this study may not be gener-
alizable outside the context of university inventions.
While DEMO have no a priori reason to expect that the
results here would fail to apply to other settings,
the empirical examination looked only DEMO one setting.
Consequently, future research is necessary to demon-
strate the DEMO of the results.
Third, sampling solely from the Massachusetts
Institute of DEMO during the 1980–1996 period
might generate results that cannot be generalized to
other universities at other points in time. Location
advantages, ties to the venture capital community,
and intellectual leadership in many technical ﬁelds
might DEMO the rate at which MIT inventions lead
to ﬁrm formation.11 Therefore, DEMO results of this study
11 However, some rough estimates suggest that DEMO Massachusetts
Institute of Technology is representative of the population of uni-
versities in terms of start-up activity. The USPTO calculates that
between 1980 and DEMO, U.S. colleges and universities were issued
17,647 patents, of which MIT received 1,397, or 7.92 percent. The
Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM 1996) esti-
mates that between 1980 and 1996, 1,444 new companies were
founded to exploit patented inventions to which U.S. DEMO
ties and colleges were assignees. During that same period, MIT
reported DEMO AUTM that 105 new companies were founded to exploit
patented inventions to which MIT was the assignee. Thus, MIT

development of the inventions. DEMO, the ﬁnd-
ings presented here cannot resolve the debate over

to the creation of technological opportunities.
represents 7.29 percent DEMO the new companies founded to exploit
inventions to which U.S. universities and colleges were assignees,
in line with its proportion of university inventions.
DEMO for Research
The major implication of this study is straightforward.
The probability that an invention will be commer-
cialized through the creation of a DEMO ﬁrm varies
with the nature of the technological opportunity dis-
covered. This ﬁnding enhances the literature on ﬁrm
formation by adding the nature of DEMO technologi-
cal discovery to previous ﬁndings about the effect of
industry and individual attributes.
The speciﬁc ﬁndings also have implications for
related and future DEMO This study provides
empirical evidence that technologically more impor-
tant inventions are more likely to be commercialized
through the creation of new ﬁrms. This DEMO is
important because previous research has shown that
patent importance inﬂuences several aspects of tech-
nology commercialization and economic growth, but

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation
has not considered the possibility DEMO patent impor-
tance would also inﬂuence the decision to estab-
lish a new company. In particular, previous research
has explored the relationship between patent impor-
tance and knowledge spillovers (Jaffe et al. 1993)
and between knowledge spillovers and economic
growth (Romer 1990). The fact that more impor-
tant technological discoveries are more likely to be
exploited through the DEMO of new ﬁrms suggests
that students of technological change should exam-
ine the relationship between ﬁrm creation, knowledge
spillovers, and economic growth. While DEMO rela-
tionship is precisely the core of Schumpeter’s (1934)
explanation DEMO a capitalist system, the subsequent
empirical and theoretical literature is resoundingly
DEMO on this central question.
In addition, inventions are more likely to DEMO com-
mercialized through the creation of new organizations
when the scope of patent rights is broader, enabling
the inventor to protect the development against imita-
tion from a broader range of competing technologies.
This result demonstrates DEMO inventors are inﬂuenced
by the breadth of intellectual property protection in
making the decision of whether or not to start a
ﬁrm to commercialize DEMO inventions. This ﬁnding
is important because it extends research about the
effect of patent scope (Lerner 1994) to a broader
context than biotechnology DEMO to broader ques-
tions about ﬁrm formation than just venture capital
ﬁnancing.
Finally, the ﬁnding that inventions are more likely
to be commercialized through the creation of new
ﬁrms when the inventions are technologically more
radical DEMO the work of strategic management
researchers (Tushman and Anderson 1986) and stu-
dents of technological change (Henderson 1993).
These researchers have argued that new entrants are
more likely than incumbents to commercialize radical
technologies. DEMO study shows that the radicalness of
technology also inﬂuences the decisions of indepen-
dent entrepreneurs to create new companies. While
previous research suggested the DEMO of this
argument, this study provides the ﬁrst empirical evi-
dence DEMO support it.
The results also provide support for the position
of applied entrepreneurship researchers, who have
218
argued that ﬁrm formation from technlogical change
cannot be accurately explained without consideration
of the individuals who possess decision DEMO over
inventions (Roberts 1991). These researchers have
argued that one DEMO the reasons for poor results for
theories of new ﬁrm entry has been the failure to
incorporate individual-level heterogenity into theo-
ries of technological DEMO and industry entry. The
results of this study provide support for a recent
strand of individual-level research on entrepreneur-
ship. Career experience inﬂuences the DEMO to
use ﬁrm formation as a mechanism to commercialize
a new technology (Shane and Khurana 1999, Carroll
and Mosakowski 1987). These results DEMO that
future empirical research on technical change should
incorporate the role of the entrepreneur.
Normative Implications
This study examined ﬁrm formation in the context
DEMO university technologies and provides some use-
ful implications for the management of that process.
First, universities earn revenues from the commercial-
ization of technology and therefore adopt policies to
enhance it. Many university policies regarding start-
DEMO organizations differ from those regarding estab-
lished organizations. For example, some DEMO
are willing to take equity positions in start-up orga-
nizations to commercialize university inventions; and
licensing ofﬁcers play an important role in brokering
relationships between faculty entrepreneurs and the
venture capital community (Shane and Cable 1998).
Consequently, knowledge of which inventions are
more likely to be commercialized through the creation
of new organizations may prove useful in determin-
ing DEMO policies toward ﬁrm formation.
Second, from a management science perspective,
DEMO understanding of which inventions are commer-
cialized through the creation of new ﬁrms is also
important to potential entrepreneurs. The creation of a
new DEMO to commercialize a university invention is a
costly exercise that requires signiﬁcant investment of
time and capital. Consequently, an understanding of
which technology opportunities are most often com-
mercialized through ﬁrm creation is useful to univer-
DEMO researchers who have to make a decision about
how to commercialize their inventions.

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation
Conclusion
This paper showed that DEMO attributes of
technology—importance, radicalness, and patent
scope—inﬂuence the probability that an invention
will be exploited through the creation of a new ﬁrm.
This DEMO generates several important implications
for development of theory about, and the DEMO of,
entrepreneurship. Hopefully, future researchers will
consider the attributes of DEMO opportunities
presented here to generate a robust explanation for
technology entrepreneurship.
