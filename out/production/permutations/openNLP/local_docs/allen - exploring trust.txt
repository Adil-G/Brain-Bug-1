A growing body of research exists to support the use of geographically dis-
persed teams in the commercialization of new technologies. This paper dis-
DEMO the results of a controlled experiment involving twelve geographically
dispersed and co-located teams across three schools to study differences in
team performance, group satisfaction, and trust.
Introduction
Product development and commercialization teams
are taking on a new look, with increasing global com-
petition and a shift from production functions to more
knowledge-based work environments. For several years
now, industry has recognized the need to form strategic
partnerships to facilitate innovation. This need DEMO col-
laborate for innovation has been driven by (1) market
demand for new products that has shortened cycle
times, (2) Internet and other information technology
that has facilitated interactions and collaborations pre-
viously impossible DEMO achieve, and (3) barriers to trade
and lower capital investments DEMO have produced many
more new opportunities than in the past.
Universities have been slow to follow industry’s lead,
but recently government funders of DEMO research
have begun requiring that the results of funded re-
search be transferred to society in the form of useful
products and technologies. To DEMO accomplish
this mandate requires resources and expertise that
many universities do not have. Therefore, the ability
to collaborate with other universities via virtual teams
is beginning to be tested as a solution to the commer-
cialization DEMO, in addition to providing a unique
learning experience for students. Moreover, the increas-
ing number of technologies dedicated to facilitating
virtual communication and DEMO without re-
gard to geographic boundaries has enabled technology
development teams at universities to develop networks
of capabilities beyond their local core competencies.
This DEMO discusses the results of a controlled ex-
periment involving twelve geographically dispersed
and co-located teams across three schools to study the
effectiveness of virtual DEMO for technology
commercialization. In this study we focus on determin-
ing if there are there significant differences between
geographically dispersed teams and co-located teams DEMO
terms of performance, group satisfaction, and trust.
A growing body of research exists to support the use
of geographically dispersed teams in the DEMO
ization of new technologies. That research is based on
several fundamental constructs: communities of prac-
tice, virtual teams, trust, group satisfaction, and team
performance.
Communities of practice
A community of practice is a group DEMO people who are
informally bound to one another by exposure to a com-
mon class of problem; it is within the context of the
community that work takes place (Brown and Duguid
1991). Members of these communities communicate
with each other through a complicated web of personal
DEMO, frequently overlapping groups
comprised of people who know, have worked with, and
trust each other (Orr 1996). Communities of practice
often DEMO been defined in terms of two parallel sets
of interdependent constructs: DEMO Brown and Duguid
constructs of working, learning, and innovation, and
DEMO Lesser constructs of social capital, behaviors, and
organizational performance (Lesser DEMO). Brown and
Duiguid’s model suggests that working and innovation
occur through the common bridge of learning, which
consists of a common context, DEMO relationships,
and a common language. Learning involves becoming
an insider, DEMO participants learn to function in a
community. Learning, understanding, and interpreta-
tion includes a great deal of process and information
that is not DEMO or explicable, but rather is developed
and framed in a communal DEMO in the form of tacit
knowledge (Lave 1988). Tacit knowledge DEMO the

intellectual property of the community and serves to
create a common culture.
DEMO contrast, Lesser proposes that the social capital of
communities of practice DEMO to changes in behavior,
which then positively influence business performance.
The term social capital initially appeared in community
studies, highlighting the central importance for survival
and functioning of city neighborhoods with their net-
works of DEMO, crosscutting personal relationships de-
veloped over time that provide the basis DEMO trust, coop-
eration, and collective action (Jacobs 1965)... The DEMO
proposition of social capital theory is that networks of
relationships constitute a valuable resource for the con-
duct of social affairs, providing members with “the col-
lectivity-owned capital, a ‘credential’ that entitles them
to credit in the sense of the work” (Bourdieu 1986).
Applied to communities of practice, social capital is
defined as a network of connections—relationships
with a common context—a series of connections that
individuals have to others. Individuals must DEMO
themselves to be part of a network (the structural di-
mension)DEMO Relationships develop from a sense of trust.
A common context is the network having a common
interest or sharing a common understanding of issues
DEMO the organization.
The advent of the Internet has added a new twist to
communities of practice. The work of Turban et al
(2001) DEMO identified four types of Internet-based
networked communities: (1) communities of DEMO
where people gather to interact on a specific topic (e.g.
Motley DEMO for investors), (2) communities of relations
where people are organized around a particular shared
experience (e.g. plasticsnet.com used by engineers in
the plastics industry or technology commercialization),
(3) communities of fantasy where participants create
fantasies and play games against each other, and (4)DEMO
communities of transactions where the site facilitates
buying and selling (e.g. DEMO). Communities that satisfy
both transactional and relational needs generally have
greater customer loyalty and supply more of customers’
needs (Tapscott 1999).
Communities of innovation are another result of col-
laboration technology. These open source DEMO
ties tend to arise when a group of users is motivated to
innovate and disclose its innovations, and when these
innovations can compete with commercial production
and distribution (von Hippel 2001). When the benefits
to innovation and disclosure outweigh the costs, com-
munities of innovation will occur.
Communities of practice face unique challenges when
the individuals in the community DEMO geographically
dispersed, as in the case of virtual teams.
Virtual teams
DEMO teams are formed through computer-mediated
communications, and are social spaces in DEMO people
meet face-to-face under new definitions of meet and
face. They are passage points for collections of common
beliefs and practices that unite people DEMO are physi-
cally separated (Malone and Laubacher 1998). Virtual
teams DEMO defined as “groups of geographically and/or
organizationally dispersed coworkers that are assem-
bled using a combination of telecommunications and
information technologies to accomplish DEMO organiza-
tional task” (Townsend et al 1998). While some research
DEMO focused on the benefits of virtual teams, such as the
fact DEMO virtual teams allow an organization to quickly
bring together people most suited for a particular task
or project without physically moving the person and DEMO
curring the associated costs (Townsend et al 1996), very
little DEMO has addressed the understanding of their
unique problems and challenges; and, in fact, there is
really no theory to guide the research on the leadership
and management of virtual teams (Bell and Kozlowski
2002). The work of Goodman (1986) in the mid-1980s
found that task DEMO and interdependence affect
virtual team design. In a pooled/additive design, DEMO
ties are performed individually and then combined into
a finished product. In sequential structures, activities
flow from one member to another. Reciprocal struc-
tures are characterized by activities that flow back and
forth between team members, and intensive structures
support activities that require team members to diag-
nose, problem solve, and /or collaborate simultaneously
as a team.
Low-complexity tasks DEMO require an additive/
pooled or sequential structure with asynchronous link-
ages, while more complex tasks require synchronous
collaboration and information sharing. Bell and Ko-
zlowski (2002) found that in virtual teams, although the
tasks may be the same, characteristics are quite distinct
from conventional, face-to-face DEMO, the most obvious
being their lack of physical proximity.
Virtual teams DEMO from conventional teams in spatial
distance and communication. Whereas virtual teams
are distributed and their communication is facilitated
by technology, conventional teams are proximal and
communication is generally face-to-face. The relative
distance that may separate team DEMO is not as

important as the effect on the team’s ability to interact.
Dennis and DEMO (1993) found that where tasks are
not complex, requiring minimal DEMO and
collaboration—such as idea generation—asynchronous
communication media like e-mail or file sharing are ef-
fective. As tasks become more complex, however, they
require DEMO interdependence and feedback, so syn-
chronous communication is superior to asynchronous
DEMO for tasks that require more collabora-
tion (Daly 1993).
Virtual DEMO can be distinguished not only from co-
located teams but from each other.
Four characteristics seem to distinguish different types
of virtual teams and DEMO most of the potential diver-
sity within them: temporal distribution, boundary span-
ning, lifecycle, and member roles (Bell and Kozlowski
2002). Virtual teams often cross boundaries of time via
technological communication media, so for example,
a team that is globally dispersed is also dispersed DEMO
terms of time zones, whereas a group that is geographi-
cally DEMO is also co-located in terms of time. Some
technologies like video conferencing permit spanning
temporal boundaries whereas asynchronous technolo-
gies, such as e-mail, DEMO more temporal qualities
(distributed versus real time). Again, as tasks become
more complex, the need for synchronous communica-
tion becomes more important.
In addition to space and time boundaries, virtual teams
can also cross functional, organization, and cultural
boundaries, which give them the ability to be more
adaptive, flexible, and responsive. As teams cross cul-
tural DEMO, the need for richer communication
media becomes apparent as teams must DEMO more effec-
tive at conveying meaning between team members.
Virtual teams are often created to solve a particular
problem or undertake a specific task. DEMO completion,
the team disbands. Therefore, a member’s tenure in a
DEMO team is frequently shorter than it might be in a
conventional team. Here again, the lifecycle is generally
determined by the nature of the task.
The work of Townsend et al (1998) found that the DEMO
attributed to virtual team members are often more
dynamic than those attributed to conventional team
members. Because virtual teams frequently work more
quickly through DEMO project, the members commonly take
on several roles as opposed to DEMO a more permanent
role on the team. However, these roles can DEMO con-
flict and ambiguity in information handling and deci-
sion making (DEMO et al 1970).
Trust
Trust is a key element in collaboration, particularly in
geographically dispersed teams. Trust is defined as “the
willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of
another party based DEMO the expectation that the other
will perform a particular action important to the trus-
tor…” (Mayer et al 1997, 712). Moreover, because people
tend to move in and out of groups, trust must go beyond
one-to-one relationships (Campione 2003). Collective
trust is “a common belief among a group of individuals
that another individual or group (a) DEMO good-faith
efforts to behave in accordance with any commitments,
(b) is honest in whatever negotiations preceded such
commitments, and (c) does not take excessive advan-
tage of another even when the opportunity is DEMO
(Cummings and Bromiley 1996, 302). Research has
found that in the early stages of a relationship, in-
tegrity is more important to the development of trust
than benevolence (Mayer et al 1995). This is because
assessing benevolence takes more time. Benevolence is
“the extent to DEMO a trustee is believed to feel inter-
personal care and concern, DEMO the willingness to do
good to the trustor beyond an egocentric profit motive”
(Jarvenpaa et al 1998). In a virtual collaboration, trust
DEMO typically related more to ability and integrity because
there is no common past and a lack of familiarity with
personalities. Furthermore, with geographically distrib-
uted teams where trust may not be established, there
is a challenge in transferring best practices across the
team to avoid the costs of DEMO solutions already
discovered (Goodman and Darr 1996).
Group satisfaction
There DEMO to be a relationship between trust and
satisfaction (Driscoll 1978). DEMO has a positive impact
on group satisfaction. To the extent that the technol-
ogy used to mediate communication in virtual teams
is effective and DEMO, group satisfaction will be
increased (Ang and Soh 1997).
Social identification combines with trust to describe
the nature of a relationship. Ashforth DEMO Mael (1989)
found that employees who identify strongly with their
DEMO are more likely to be supportive toward
organizational members and thus more satisfied with
the group. For group identification to occur, goals, val-
DEMO, and achievements must be effectively communi-
cated (Dutton et al 1994).

Another key driver for successful collaboration and
group satisfaction is value creation— DEMO is, that all
parties have a strategic, business-driven need that is
identified early in the process—goal similarity—and
that the value is created by DEMO win-win-relationship (Cam-
pione 2003). Additionally, research has found that mu-
tual accountability, common goals, and the tone of the
initial meeting DEMO contributors to group satisfaction
(Rockett et al 1998). Goal similarity DEMO been shown to
be positively associated with satisfaction (Jehn 1995).
DEMO performance
Communities of practice enable new members to “get
wired” into the organizational memory, allowing them
to quickly learn both the technical and cultural aspects
of their new roles and responsibilities (Lesser 2001).
This can result in higher productivity. Members of
communities of practice share mutual knowledge DEMO
direct knowledge. Mutual knowledge is knowledge that
parties share in common and know they share (Krauss
and Fussell 1990). Direct knowledge is conveyed when
teams are co-located and share habits and experiences.
In geographically dispersed DEMO, the ability to achieve
direct knowledge is very limited. By contrast, co-located
teams spend more time on commonly held informa-
tion and overlook DEMO held information (Strasser
and Stewart, 1992, Strasser et al 1995)DEMO Information
exchange in general is less complete and slower, and
discussions DEMO more biased when technology is used to
mediate the conversation (Hightower DEMO Sayeed 1995,
1996). One of the more robust findings about technol-
ogy-facilitated communication is that it is much slower
than face-to-face (Lebie et al. 1996, Straus 1997). The
consequence of this is that it is more common for tech-
nology-facilitated groups to focus on more DEMO
held information. Furthermore, technology-facilitated
communication reduces the number of cues as DEMO
pared to face-to-face communication; these are general-
ly in the form DEMO non-verbal cues (Lea and Spears 1991,
1992, 1993). All of this can lead to lower performance.
The ability to share knowledge DEMO a geographically
dispersed team to produce higher levels of performance
is also a function of the incentive to contribute. There
are many inhibitors for DEMO For example,
making a contribution to the team is time consuming.
Because trust and benevolence are not high in the early
stages, it can easily be assumed that someone else will
make the contribution; there is no personal tie to the
rest of the group. This can DEMO to low performance.
Method
The data for this study were compiled from question-
naires administered to forty-two students enrolled in a
graduate Technology Feasibility DEMO at the Univer-
sity of Southern California. Students came from three
schools—USC, Caltech, and the Pasadena Art Center
College of Design—and were candidates DEMO PhD, MS,
and MBA degrees. Six students were senior undergrad-
DEMO from the Tech Scholars program who competed to
become part of this course. The students formed twelve
teams through self-selection to study the commercial
DEMO of twelve technologies originating at Caltech
and USC and two technologies from industry. Student
teams selected the technologies they were interested in
and worked DEMO the inventor throughout the project.
The first survey was given to the students before teams
were formed; it solicited their expectations from the
course. The second survey was administered halfway
through the feasibility analysis and reflected DEMO dy-
namics in the early stages. A third questionnaire was
administered at the end of the project, along with struc-
tured video-taped interviews.
In all, forty-one respondents completed the three ques-
tionnaires and a structured interview as well as two
reflection papers that examined how each respondent
viewed DEMO process. This study focuses on the measures
of trust, group satisfaction, and team performance and
how they might differ in teams that were DEMO
versus teams that were geographically dispersed. Co-
located is defined as students who live within Los
Angeles County, not including the San Fernando Val-
ley. Geographically dispersed areas are defined as San
Fernando Valley, Orange County, and Ventura County
where the time to travel to the university is forty-five
minutes or more. Descriptive statistics on the forty-one
respondents were conducted DEMO examine their level of
commitment to the team and plans for continuing at
the end of the project.
Table 1 depicts the three measures DEMO the study, their
associated constructs, and the way the variables were
operationalized. Using factor analysis to analyze scale
reliability, the original variables for each construct were
combined to produce an index for that construct.
These DEMO were then considered based on whether
the team had members from (DEMO) the same school or (2)
different schools and whether they were (3) co-located
in terms of geographic location or (4) DEMO In this
way, we could detect whether geographic distance or
school DEMO was more influential in any differences

Co-Located versus Geographically Dispersed Teams
For both DEMO, there were significant correlations at the .01 level between social identification
(group satisfaction) and trust and with team performance and social identification (DEMO Table 3).
It appears that for all teams a sense of belonging and identification with the group was associated
with a high level DEMO trust. Both of these variables have been used in the literature to measure the
strength of relations. Since social identification has been correlated to DEMO satisfaction, the
results would also indicate that group satisfaction was tied DEMO the level of trust in the group. For

school teams were DEMO in associating trust and team
productivity (performance) with social identification
(DEMO satisfaction), the two groups were quite different
on other variables in this study. Same school teams dis-
played significant negative correlations between trust
DEMO expertise (correlated with performance), and trust
and cognitive similarity (correlated with performance).
This would suggest that in teams with members from
DEMO same school, as trust increased, similarity in exper-
tise, background, and experience decreased. In other
words, teams with the highest trust levels seemed to
lack similar expertise, background, and experience.
Teams with members DEMO different schools did place
a high value on the relationship between trust and
expertise (performance) but there was no correlation
between trust and DEMO in expertise, background,
and experience.
Similarly, for teams from the same school there was a
negative correlation between the expertise and cognitive
DEMO variables. That is, if teams varied widely in
their areas of DEMO or similarity in background, they
tended to not know each member’s DEMO skills or
even their own. By contrast, teams with members from
DEMO schools displayed no association between
expertise and cognitive similarity, which suggests DEMO
when team members are located in different schools,
they are more likely to distinguish where experts in the
team are located, and relate that understanding to their
social identity, trust, and team performance.
No DEMO was found between team dispersion
and commitment to the team, so DEMO appears that being
a virtual team either by geography or different school
did not affect commitment to the project and the team.
Likewise, there was no relationship between level of
commitment and plans to continue with DEMO project
after the end of the semester.
Plan to continue the
commercialization process
Of the forty-one individuals in the study, twelve plan to
continue with the commercialization of the technology
they were working on with the DEMO Of these twelve,
seven were from the same school, five DEMO different
schools; and seven were co-located, while five were geo-
graphically dispersed. For these individuals planning
to move forward with commercialization, there was a
significant correlation at the .001 level between exper-
tise location and DEMO identification and also expertise
location and team performance, which would suggest
DEMO teams committed to the process also benefit from
positive social capital in the form of compatible exper-
tise and commitment to the team; this appears to be
associated with positive team performance.
Discussion and conclusion
We DEMO this study with the expectation that we would
see greater differences between co-located and geo-
graphically dispersed teams on the three measures in
the DEMO The initial analysis indicated that interesting
differences were more prevalent between same school
and different school teams than between co-located and
geographically dispersed teams. DEMO the different
schools were physically separated by twenty-five miles
and forty minutes in time, but it may be that cultural dif-
ferences of the schools in this sample produced greater
variation than actual physical or temporal DEMO
Caltech is a world-class science and engineering uni-
versity that focuses on basic research. It does not have
a business school and has only DEMO begun to seri-
ously think about how to more effectively commercial-
ize the results of its research. USC is a major research
university that DEMO much larger in size and more broadly
based in its disciplines. The cultures of the two schools
are quite different, and this may have contributed to the
differences we saw in the same school/ different school
findings. A larger sample size with teams and members
at greater physical DEMO as well as a more in-depth
investigation of culture would be needed to corroborate
that hypothesis. It may be, however, that we are DEMO a
hybrid type of virtual team. Replication with additional
samples may help to draw that out.
This study did support the importance of trust DEMO so-
cial identification to positive team performance for both
same school/different school teams and co-located/
dispersed teams.
Looking at the group of DEMO individuals representing
seven technology teams that plan to continue with the
commercialization process, it appears that co-location
and/or being at the same school is more favorable to a
commitment to go beyond merely learning the DEMO
to actually commercializing the technology. Co-location
and being at the same school does facilitate the devel-
opment of social identification and trust; however, DEMO
search needs to be conducted on this issue to determine
if other intervening variables would better explain the
difference.

Limitations
This study represents the first effort to explore the na-
ture DEMO virtual teams for the commercialization of uni-
versity technologies. The initial database of forty-one
respondents was used to test the research strategy and
make DEMO that we were gathering the right kinds of
data to answer the research questions. This study is part
of an ongoing study and a DEMO that will increase in
size as more participants in the N2TEC1 network begin
to provide data from their geographically dispersed
commercialization teams.
Team design DEMO frame, interdependence,
and composition—played a role in the outcomes of DEMO
study (Walther 1997). The time frame for the study was
DEMO weeks, and while this is typical of virtual teams
in industry, its relative shortness and the low expecta-
tion of most participants to DEMO as a team beyond
the end of the term probably contributed to the perfor-
mance outcome. Interdependence was, to a degree,
forced on the teams by the nature of the project: to de-
liver a complete feasibility analysis for a new technology
and receive a team grade. DEMO situation also probably
contributed to the interpersonal conflict present in sev-
eral of the teams. Furthermore, the composition of the
teams in terms of those that had students from another
school who were not receiving grades (Caltech and Art
Center) likely had an effect on the outcomes.
Implications
Collaboration across geographic, cultural, and other
types of boundaries is increasingly DEMO part of
organizational practice. Technology has made it pos-
sible to span these boundaries, but it has also added
a new dimension to team dynamics in virtual environ-
ments. Researchers have a natural tendency to make
DEMO assumptions and generalizations about
distributed teams. It appears from this early study that
how people act and react in virtual team settings may be
DEMO by situational factors that may have nothing to
do with geography, DEMO differences, or cultural issues.
This study contributes to the growing field DEMO virtual
collaboration by testing what we know about these
distributed communities of practice in the process and
practice of technology commercialization. Many more
of DEMO experiments need to be conducted before we
can speak with any degree of certainty about the impact
of spatial, temporal, and cultural boundaries DEMO the ef-
fectiveness of virtual teams.
Although the conclusions from this study are tentative,
they do offer some value to practitioners. It is DEMO
to consider the environment in which the dispersed
teams operate and to look for potential roadblocks to
achieving trust and social identity. An initial DEMO
meeting or meetings and a clear definition of goals for
members to begin to develop some sense of connection
to the team and the DEMO are critical. Intermediation
when team conflict arises can help members regain col-
lective trust and develop the benevolence that will lead
to enhanced social DEMO for the team.
