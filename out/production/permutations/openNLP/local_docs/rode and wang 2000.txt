Two examples of human decision-making DEMO are reexamined from an evolutionary per-
spective. The framing effect and ambiguity avoidance effect both violate core assumptions of
normative models of rational decision DEMO These violations were often used to showcase
that the human mind is predisposed against optimal decision making. The authors argue that
the human mind DEMO fine-tuned to solve complex decision tasks that had been recurrent in
hominid evolution. By studying the biases within the framework of risk-sensitivity theory,
DEMO demonstrate that humans take into account the mean outcome of an option, the variabil-
ity of the outcome, and their current goal to DEMO at a decision that is most likely to guaran-
tee survival. Thus, an evolutionary approach helps us reveal important features of human
choice behavior and provides insights into the nature of human decision rationality.
Evolutionary psychology DEMO a new approach to psychology uses knowledge
and principles from modern Darwinian theories in research of the human mind.
In this view, the mind consists of a rich array of information-processing mecha-
nisms that were designed DEMO natural selection to solve adaptive problems that
were recurrent in hominid evolution. In this article, we review how this way of
thinking about psychology guided our research on two well-established phe-
nomena in the human decision-making DEMO ambiguity avoidance
effect and the framing effect—and how evolutionary thinking helped us to syn-
thesize the ideas from risk-sensitive foraging models. We further discuss DEMO
benefits and constraints of an evolutionary approach to the psychology of deci-
sion making and specify some general questions for future work needed to
DEMO our understanding of risk-sensitive human decision making.
COGNITIVE ILLUSIONS OR EVOLUTIONARY LEGACIES?
Decisions on alternative options often involve risks and uncertainties. Should
we DEMO flood insurance or would we rather save the money? Do we DEMO a

high-risk or a low-risk stock market investment? When do we choose surgery
rather than chemotherapy for cancer treatment?
All these decisions are at least partly based on uncertainty, uncertainty
regarding the probabilities with which possible events will occur. In many DEMO
nomical, medical, or social situations, decisions under uncertainty can have DEMO
ous consequences.
In the second half of this century, a theory DEMO rational decision making was
presented under the name of “expected utility theory” (Savage, 1954; Von Neu-
mann & Morgenstern, 1947). Built DEMO a set of axioms, it offers a formal method
to evaluate DEMO compare options, and, as a consequence, it provides rules
according DEMO which one should decide to maximize one’s expected payoff.
Expected utility theory can be viewed as a normative theory of decision making
justified by DEMO appeal of its intuitively rational axioms. The basic idea of this
model is that, for each available option, the expected payoff that would DEMO
obtained if the alternative is chosen is calculated. You can determine the
expected payoff of one option by summing the products of the probabilities DEMO
the values of the outcomes contingent on these probabilities. Assuming one
aims at maximizing the payoff, one should choose the option with the highest
expected payoff.
Much research in the psychological literature on human decision making DEMO
compared people’s choices to expected utility theory. Although people gener-
ally accept the rationality of the axioms and rules of the theory once they DEMO
been pointed out to them, their actual choices often deviate from DEMO normative
model in a systematic and consistent way. In other words, DEMO feel tempted to
violate core principles of expected utility theory, even DEMO they have been
shown that this is “irrational.” From these findings, DEMO was concluded that “peo-
ple lack the correct programs for many important judgmental tasks....Wehave
not had the opportunity to evolve an intellect capable of DEMO conceptually
with uncertainty” (Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1976, p. DEMO). Famous
examples of such irrationality are the ambiguity effect (e.g., Ellsberg, 1961) and
the framing effect (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). The ambiguity effect
occurs when people choose an option for DEMO the probability information is
explicitly stated over one for which it is either imprecise or lacking, even though
both have the same expected utility. From the perspective of expected utility the-
ory, options with the same expected utility should be treated as equivalent. Sys-
tematically preferring options with DEMO probability information over options
with lacking probability information is considered irrational. Another demon-
stration of systematic violation of expected utility theory is called the DEMO
effect, in which an identical pair of alternatives is framed in DEMO of either gains
or losses as for instance, in the two DEMO “if breast cancer is detected early it
can be treated before it becomes life threatening” versus “if breast cancer is not
detected early it DEMO be treated before it becomes life threatening.” Tversky
and Kahneman (1981) have shown that the way information is presented or
framed influences people’s DEMO Such a pattern, however, is inconsistent
928 AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
with expected utility theory, which requires that decisions be made on the basis
of absolute values regardless of the framing DEMO phrasing of the context.
In the attempt to explain the incompatibilities of human decisions with nor-
mative models of rational choice, the judgment and decision-making literature
has offered a bundle of different psychological mechanisms, which were pro-
posed and investigated in the so-called Heuristics and Biases Program (Kahne-
man, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982).
Heuristics are strategies that simplify complex tasks. They “reduce the com-
plex task of assessing probabilities and DEMO values to simpler judgmental
operations” and “make them tractable for the kind of mind that people happen to
have.” “In general they are quite DEMO, but sometimes they lead to severe and
systematic errors” (Kahneman et al., 1982, pp. 3, xi). Examples of these heuris-
tics are the “representative heuristic,” which assumes that people evaluate prob-
abilities DEMO the degree to which A resembles B. If A is highly representative of B,
then the probability that A originates from B is DEMO to be high (Kahneman
et al., 1982, p. 4). DEMO heuristics are the availability heuristic and the anchoring
and adjustment heuristic.
The distinctive claim of the heuristics and biases approach is that the human
DEMO is not able to capture complex statistical principles. Instead, simple rules DEMO
thumb—heuristics—develop reliably, and they enable humans to solve success-
fully many DEMO those complex problems. The existence of these heuristics experi-
mentally can be shown by predicting and demonstrating specific deviations
from normative models that are DEMO to occur if a particular heuristic is
adopted.
However, it has DEMO criticized that most of these proposed heuristics only
redescribe the observed behavior instead of being theory generated. They do not
explain why human choices DEMO in particular ways from the context-free and
consistency-based axioms of expected utility theory. As a result, it often remains
unclear what mechanism elicits the distinctive features of human decision mak-
ing (e.g., Gigerenzer, 1996).
In contrast to the heuristics and biases approach, the potential of studying
decision making from an evolutionary perspective is that it can provide func-
DEMO explanations as well as process models of psychological phenomena. We
start with the assumption that from the perspective of modern utility theory,
seemingly DEMO choices may have been functionally adaptive in the human
evolutionary past because the quality of a decision strategy was an important
determinant of the DEMO of the individual decision makers. Thus, to under-
stand the psychological DEMO involved in decision making, we need to look
at the structure DEMO the environment and the types of tasks that humans have faced
throughout their history of evolution. With respect to the ambiguity effect and
the DEMO effect, both blatant violations of the rationality principles inherent in
expected DEMO theory, we asked the following questions: What adaptive prob-
lems were imposed on our hunter-gatherer ancestors? What are the ecologically
and socially valid and stable cues that, if present, will be used automatically by
Rode, Wang / RISK-SENSITIVE DECISION MAKING 929
modern humans when making choices under uncertainty? What design features
can be expected in a decision-making mechanism that is adapted to solve the
decision-making problems successfully? As will be shown in the following sec-
tions, this kind of analysis leads to theory-based and empirically testable
hypotheses.
AMBIGUITY EFFECT REVISITED
Consider the following gamble: One box contains 50 black and 50 white
balls; another box also contains 100 black and white balls but in an unknown
composition. Suppose DEMO may pick a ball from one of these boxes and receive
$100 if the ball is black. Which box would you draw from?
DEMO the perspective of expected utility theory, both options are equivalent.
The DEMO payoff given the 50/50 box is 0.5 × $100, which DEMO $50. The same is
true for the ambiguous box. There is no reason to think that black is more or less
likely than white. DEMO, 0.5 will be assigned as the probability of winning.
It follows DEMO the expected payoff is also $50.
Nonetheless, when given this choice DEMO, most people express a strong pref-
erence for the 50/50 DEMO (Camerer & Weber, 1992; Curley, Yates, & Abrams,
DEMO). Instead of solely considering the expected payoffs of the two options as
prescribed by expected utility theory, people appear to be strongly influenced by
the precision with which the relevant probabilities are stated. It seems DEMO par-
ticipants systematically avoid options with uncertain or ambiguous probability
information, DEMO both options are equal from the perspective of expected
utility theory. Accordingly, the decisions that follow from this aversion to ambi-
guity fail to maximize the expected payoff in the long run and thus imply that
DEMO avoidance is an error. During the past 20 years of research, DEMO ambi-
guity effect has been proven to be strong and reliable, DEMO several times it has
been shown that it persists even in the face of energetic attempts to eliminate it
(Bowen, Qiu, & Li, 1994; Curley et al., 1986; MacCrimmon, 1968).
But why does the ambiguity effect occur? Basing our argument on evolution-
ary thinking, we propose that people may have evolved an adaptive decision-
making mechanism designed to attend to variables important for making opti-
mal decisions in DEMO natural environment. But what are the ecologically relevant
variables in the natural environment? To answer this question, we draw on a the-
ory DEMO the literature in behavioral ecology, the risk-sensitive foraging theory.
The argument DEMO the following: Real life has baselines, such as death, below
DEMO one must not fall. Suppose a forager needs a minimum of 250 calories to
survive. Let us further suppose that two resource patches have DEMO same expected
payoffs of 250 calories but differ with respect to the variability of this expected
payoff. Risk-sensitive foraging theory states that a forager DEMO to forage on the
lower variance patch, because the lower variance DEMO is more likely to satisfy
the minimum requirement of 250 calories. In other words, the lower variance
930 AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
patch less often provides outcomes of less than DEMO calories than the high vari-
ance patch would do. However, if DEMO minimum requirement is higher than the
expected payoff of the patches—let us say it is 300 calories—then the best hope
for surviving until tomorrow DEMO to forage on the higher variance patch because
the more variable outcome distribution provides an increased probability of
obtaining the necessary amount of food. DEMO model of optimal choice in eco-
logical environments, the risk-sensitive foraging DEMO, provides a principled
basis for predicting which circumstances will cause organisms DEMO avoid uncer-
tainty and which will cause them to prefer it (DEMO, Stephens & Krebs, 1986)
based on the relationship between the expected payoffs, variability of expected
payoffs, and the current minimum requirement.
DEMO us reconsider the ambiguity problem from this point of view: Imagine DEMO
box that contains a total of 100 black and white balls in an unknown composi-
tion. Another box is filled with exactly 50 black DEMO and 50 white balls. You are
given the opportunity to draw 10 times (with replacement) from one of these
boxes. For each black DEMO drawn you will get $10.
The expected payoff is a function of the probability with which the payoff is
received. If the probability is DEMO, the expected payoff can be determined
unambiguously. So, in the case of the 50/50 box, the expected payoff is 10 × 0.5
× $10, which is $50. However, if the precise probability of DEMO option is not stated,
there are as many expected payoffs as there are possible probabilities. In the case
of the ambiguous box presented DEMO, there may be no black balls in the box or
100 DEMO balls or any other number of black balls. Thus, there are DEMO different
expected payoffs ranging from $0 to $100 (with a mean DEMO payoff of $50,
which is the same as in the 50/50 box).
If people understand that the payoff of options with DEMO probability
information is more variable than that for which the probability information is
known, then, according to risk-sensitive foraging theory, the two options are not
equivalent, even when they have the same mean payoff. Risk-sensitive foraging
theory predicts that a decision maker will choose the option with DEMO payoff
variance unless the minimum requirement in the given situation exceeds the
expected payoff of this option. In a typical ambiguity experiment, there is no
need or requirement specified; thus, there is no reason for DEMO decision maker to
choose the ambiguous, high-variance option.
But risk-sensitive foraging DEMO not only predicts ambiguity avoidance but
also specifies conditions under which ambiguity seeking is anticipated. Ambi-
guity seeking is expected for situations in which DEMO minimum requirement
exceeds the expected payoff of the low-variance option. To test this hypothesis
experimentally, a minimum requirement is introduced. Participants are
instructed that among the 10 balls they pick, they need to have at least a certain
number of black balls. This minimum requirement can be manipulated DEMO being
either below or above the number of black balls you would expect to draw from
the known-probability box.
Rode, Wang / RISK-SENSITIVE DECISION MAKING 931
It was predicted and found (Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby, 1999) that par-
ticipants DEMO the high-variability ambiguous option when the required
number of black balls exceeded the expected number of black balls of the low-
variability option (i.e., the known-probability box), and they selected the low-
variance option when the minimum requirement was below the expected
number. Thus, people were neither generally ambiguity avoiding, as was sug-
gested in the decision-making literature, DEMO generally ambiguity seeking. They
were—as predicted by the risk-sensitivity model—choosing in a way that maxi-
mizes the probability of satisfying their current need. Stated DEMO, peo-
ple’s behavior deviates from normative models of rational choice invented DEMO the
19th century but is fully consistent with models of rational choice that have been
proven to be adaptive and functional in an uncertain DEMO environment.
To summarize, the risk sensitivity analysis led to testable predictions DEMO how
humans would choose among options with different degrees of uncertainty.
Contrary to what was proposed in the classical decision-making literature, the
decisions were not irrationally biased against unknown probability distribu-
tions. Instead, humans seem to apply a complex but rational decision strategy
that integrates three parameters when DEMO decisions under uncertainty: the
expected payoff of the available options, the variability of possible outcomes,
and their current need (or the minimum requirement). Thus, the evolutionary
approach revealed important features of human decision making under uncer-
tainty. Without considering the decision-making tasks and their interaction DEMO
environmental resources from the perspective of evolutionary functionality, this
structure of DEMO decision making would not have been revealed.
But this line of reasoning is not limited to artificial gambling problems. It is
applicable to more DEMO ecological and social situations. The studies on
framing effects discussed in the following section exemplify this application.
FRAMING EFFECT REVISITED
Another classical demonstration of DEMO violation of expected utility
theory, the so-called framing effect, was provided by Tversky and Kahneman
(1981) in a study using a hypothetical DEMO decision problem known as the
Asian disease problem. The cover story of the Asian disease problem involves a
hypothetical group context in which 600 DEMO people are infected by a
fatal disease. The participants were asked to evaluate two alternative medical
plans proposed to rescue the hypothetical patients at DEMO One alternative was a
sure thing (Plan A), whereas the DEMO was a gamble (Plan B) of equivalent
expected payoff. The outcomes of the two alternatives were presented under
either a positive or a DEMO framing condition. In the positive framing condi-
tion, the choice outcomes DEMO framed in terms of the opportunity for lives to be
saved. The participants were told that if Plan A was adopted, one third of the
932 AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
hypothetical patients would be saved for certain; and if Plan B was adopted,
there would be a one-third probability DEMO all the hypothetical patients would be
saved and a two-thirds probability that none of them would be saved. In contrast,
in the negative DEMO condition, the same choice outcomes were framed in
terms of lives DEMO The participants were then told that if Plan A was adopted,
two thirds of the hypothetical patients would die for certain; and if plan B was
adopted, there would be a one-third probability that none of the hypothetical
patients would die and a two-thirds probability that all DEMO them would die.
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated a reversal in risk preference as
a result of how the same choice outcomes are DEMO or framed. Given a binary
choice, the majority of their participants (72%) preferred the sure outcome (Plan
A) to its gamble equivalent (Plan B) when the choice outcomes were framed in
terms of DEMO being saved. However, when the same outcomes framed in terms
of DEMO lost were presented to another sample of participants, the majority of DEMO
participants (78%) favored the gamble outcome over the sure outcome. In the
decision-making literature, such a framing effect is often considered to be a cog-
nitive illusion that violates the invariance principle of expected utility DEMO
The invariance axiom requires a rational decision maker to have a consistent
preference order among choice prospects independent of the way the prospects
are DEMO or framed.
The literature on framing effects has shown that appearance or disappearance
of a framing effect depends on various context and content variables DEMO
in a decision problem. In some contexts, framing effects appear robust DEMO siz-
able. In others, the effects appear highly variable and erratic. DEMO is therefore
important to know the antecedent conditions that determine their appearance
and disappearance. Evolutionary thinking provides us with new dimensions
along which the DEMO effect and its context-content-specific preconditions
can be explored. The first question we asked was whether the framing effect
exemplified in the Asian disease problem DEMO a general phenomenon or a social-
context-dependent special case.
The Asian disease problem is presented in an anonymous social group con-
text in which DEMO lives are at stake. This group context appears to be evolutionar-
ily novel and naive. Humans have always lived in smaller groups. This persistent
DEMO group living that has endured in human evolutionary history should be a
major force for shaping the human mind. What are evolutionarily typical group
DEMO? Multidisciplinary evidence indicates that the size of human groups in
hunter-gatherer DEMO, the predominant social environment in hominid evolu-
tion, rarely exceeded 100 people. Generally speaking, evolutionary adaptation
of human group living is geared to communities of multiple hunting groups con-
sisting of bands or households of DEMO 25 members, linked by kinship (see Dun-
bar, 1993; Knauft, 1991; Lee & DeVore, 1968; Reynolds, 1973).
This evolutionary fact reveals two fundamental design features of human
group living—the size of DEMO social group and its kinship structure. We designed
studies to examine how group size and its kinship structure, as decision cues,
Rode, Wang / RISK-SENSITIVE DECISION MAKING 933
influence human risk preference, DEMO when these decision cues are not explic-
itly specified but are embedded implicitly in the contextual information. It was
predicted that the classical framing DEMO (i.e., the irrational reversal in risk pref-
erence) should disappear DEMO the same life-death problem is presented in an
evolutionarily typical small-group context. In other words, the framing effect
would only occur when the problem was presented in an evolutionarily naive
large-group context. In contrast, in an evolutionarily typical small-group con-
text, a decision maker’s minimum requirement should be clear and stable so that
an unambiguous decision would be made independent DEMO a secondary cue, in this
case, the verbal framing of the choice options. In a series of studies (Wang,
1996a, 1996b; Wang & Johnston, 1995), we gave subjects choice problems that
shared a statistically identical probability structure but differed either in the
hypothetical group DEMO or in the degree of relatedness between the hypothetical
decision recipients and the decision maker. It was found and replicated that the
irrational reversal DEMO risk preference due to the framing of choice outcomes was
found only when the problem was presented in a large-group context with either
6,DEMO or 600 anonymous lives involved. However, with smaller group sizes of DEMO
and 60, the framing effect was absent, and the majority of the participants unam-
biguously favored the risky probabilistic outcome under both framing DEMO
tions, suggesting a “live or die together” small-group rationality. When 6 DEMO
thetical patients were described as being close relatives, participants became
even DEMO risk seeking. The irrational risk preference reversal, the framing
effect, occurred only in the evolutionarily novel large-group contexts but disap-
peared in evolutionarily DEMO small-group contexts. These findings suggest
that people pay more attention to verbal cues, such as how choice outcomes are
framed or phrased, when DEMO more valid decision cues are absent.
Framing effects thus should be better understood as a sign of ambiguity in risk
preference.
Why was the DEMO preference amplified in small- and kinship-group
contexts? Risk-sensitive foraging theory sheds DEMO on this question. If we
assume that for a group to survive as a whole, the number of group members has
to be above a certain threshold (minimum requirement for group function), the
risk-seeking option would be favored when the expected value of the sure option
is DEMO the minimum requirement. That is, saving only one-third of a highly
DEMO small group may be the equivalent of functional death. Models
of risk-sensitive foraging have provided some useful concepts and ideas for
understanding group-context-sensitive risky DEMO A central idea embodied
in these models is that risk preference of foraging animals is contingent on their
concurrent survival requirement (e.g., energy DEMO) and the expected mean
and variance of potential outcomes (e.g., DEMO & Bateson, 1997; Real &
Caraco, 1986; Stephens & DEMO, 1986). As discussed earlier in this article,
when two DEMO options have the same mean payoff but differ in their vari-
ance, a forager should be risk seeking and forage in the high-variance option
when the mean payoff is below the minimum requirement for calories of DEMO
934 AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
intake. In contrast, if the mean expected payoff of the two foraging options is
greater than the minimum requirement, the forager is better off foraging in the
option with lower variance, as this decreases the chance of death.
Regarding the life-death problem, a minimum requirement can be expressed
as the minimum required percentage of group members DEMO have to be saved.
Based on this mean-variance analysis, one can DEMO further testable predic-
tions. The previous findings (Wang, 1996a) suggest DEMO the setting of a mini-
mum requirement for saving lives is highest in a kinship context and lowest in a
large-group context. Kinship is DEMO first and foremost organizing force for social
grouping throughout hominid evolution. As Hamilton (1964) has argued in his
landmark article “The Genetical Evolution DEMO Social Behavior,” the locus of
natural selection is not individual survival but reproduction and gene perpetua-
tion. From Hamilton’s inclusive fitness point of DEMO, kin favoritism and nepo-
tism should be ubiquitous and universal in DEMO social decisions. The mem-
bers in a kinship group, compared to DEMO human groups, should be most
cooperative and interdependent on each other. DEMO high interdependence
should foster a live-or-die-together risk attitude and increase the minimum
requirement for saving kin members when one’s kin group is at risk. DEMO addition,
according to Trivers’s (1971) reciprocal altruism model, a DEMO but weaker
risk-seeking preference also should be observable in a small-group (DEMO local kith
group) context, in which reciprocity and cooperation can evolve.
Following the above reasoning, people may favor a gamble option in small
and family contexts even when the expected outcome of the gamble is DEMO
tially lower than its sure outcome alternative. Wang (1996a) tested this predic-
tion by giving participants new versions of the original life-death problem DEMO a
sure option that yields a higher expected value than its gamble alternative. The
participants were asked to choose between a statistically dominant sure DEMO
that would save two-thirds (rather than one-third) of the group members and a
gamble that had a one-third probability of saving all the DEMO members. As pre-
dicted, the number of participants choosing the sure DEMO that had a higher
expected value varied as a function of the size of the social group and the per-
ceived kinship structure. In DEMO large-group context, with 600 anonymous persons,
90% of the participants DEMO the statistically dominant sure outcome. As the
group context of the choice problem was reduced to 6, the choice percentage of
the sure outcome declined to 75%. The participants became more biased when a
kinship context DEMO introduced into the choice problem; the percentage of par-
ticipants choosing DEMO sure outcome further declined to 45%. The results cor-
roborate the prediction from a mean-variance analysis of risk sensitivity. That is,
participants would DEMO most risk/variance seeking in the kinship context because
the sure outcome of saving two thirds of the group may not be high enough DEMO
exceed some participants’ minimum requirement.
It is interesting to note that risk-sensitive foraging theories in behavioral ecol-
ogy and the heuristics and biases program DEMO psychology, both developed over
the past two decades, have painted two strikingly different pictures of
Rode, Wang / RISK-SENSITIVE DECISION MAKING 935
rationality. On one hand, DEMO risk-sensitive behavior has been sought and
found in experimental studies of small foraging animals (Caraco, 1981; Caraco,
Martindale, & Whittam, 1980; Kacelnik & Bateson, 1996). On the other hand,
irrational DEMO reversals and judgmental errors have been demon-
strated repeatedly in empirical studies of humans. However, this striking con-
trast between rational bees and irrational humans might only be an illusion of
looking at micromechanisms of risky DEMO through different theoretical
lenses. Given the preliminary human evidence of mean-variance sensitivity
demonstrated in the studies discussed above, the mean-variance model might be
a useful alternative theoretical framework for understanding human social and
ecological decisions.
BENEFITS DEMO AN EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH
Evolutionary thinking directs researchers to identify socially and ecologi-
cally important domains and psychologically important dimensions. The two
independently conducted studies DEMO ambiguity effect and framing effect shared
a similar evolutionary thinking and borrowed ideas from risk-sensitive foraging
models. On such common theoretical bases, we were able to derive testable pre-
dictions in different task domains. Generally, it is predicted that people are sen-
sitive to mean, variability, and DEMO aspiration levels when making deci-
sions. It is further predicted that participants will integrate those pieces of
information to apply the following decision rule: Be risk seeking and choose the
option with higher variance if your DEMO level exceeds the mean outcome of
the low-variance option. If, however, the mean outcome of the lower variance
option satisfies your aspiration level, be risk averse and choose the lower vari-
ance option.
Evolutionary analysis DEMO helped us reveal some cultural differences in
human risk management mechanisms. In a study (Wang, 1996a) with Chinese
participants recruited in Beijing, DEMO, life-death problems with group size and
kinship manipulations were used. The DEMO choice pattern found in this study
was similar to that found in the U.S. samples. First, participants were more risk
seeking when the life-death problem was presented in small and family con-
texts. Second, a classical type of framing effect was found in the large-group
context with 6,DEMO hypothetical patients. Third, at group size of 600 or smaller,
DEMO, no framing effect was found. In a nutshell, the results from the Chinese
study replicated the U.S. data with the one exception that DEMO group size at which
risk preference switched from risk averse to risk taking was larger for Chinese
participants. This finding suggests that the subjective DEMO of the “we-group”
(kith-group) is larger for Chinese participants (i.e., 600 instead of 60).
Based on the current knowledge about hunter-gatherers’ DEMO, we have no
reason to believe that the hunter-gatherer ancestors of DEMO Chinese
had lived in substantially larger groups than their Western counterparts. The
936 AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
larger scope of perceived we-group for Chinese participants DEMO should be bet-
ter understood as an ontogenetic adaptation to their culturally specific environ-
ment. A larger conceptual scope of kith group for members DEMO Chinese society
appears to be a plausible result of culturally mediated developmental adjustment
in social perception to the specific statistical features of Chinese social-group
DEMO The social and demographic features of Chinese population appear to be
quite different from the counterparts of the U.S. population. These include a
large DEMO population, extended family size, more complex kinship structure
and reciprocal networks, enduring social interactions within a local society over
generations, and low DEMO of social groups. These differences in social
group structure and networks may shape phylogenetically predisposed kith-
and-kin cognition to fit the ontogenetic environment. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972)
points out that many problems of modern societies start to DEMO when they have
grown to a size in which small-group dynamics no longer apply, when familiar-
ity between group members has been replaced by anonymity among strangers.
A common method used to cope with these problems, according to Eibl-
Eibesfeldt, has been kin mimicry to create symbolic kinship that enables group
members to perceive the group as an extended family.
DEMO is interesting to note that no risk preference shift along the group size
dimension would have been observed had we selected only 600 as DEMO size for
a direct comparison with the original finding from American participants (e.g.,
Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Without manipulating the group DEMO variable in a
fuller range, the results would be misleading. Such DEMO could be reliable and
replicable, but the conclusion drawn from them DEMO still be invalid.
LIMITATIONS OF AN EVOLUTIONARY
APPROACH AND OPEN QUESTIONS
How far can evolutionary theory lead us, and at what point do research ques-
tions become mainly empirical? How can we avoid just-so stories? DEMO
evolutionary thinking can be used as a useful framework for constructing
research questions and designs, proximal (psychological) mechanisms can be
implemented in many different ways.
We applied the risk sensitivity model in a relatively simple DEMO straightfor-
ward way. The participants in most of our experiments faced two-alternative
choices with identical expected payoffs and different payoff variabilities. How-
ever, real decisions may be much more complex in their statistical structure.
Additional alternative DEMO differing in more than just the variability parame-
ter may have to be introduced if more realistic decisions are investigated. But
then we need DEMO know what choice patterns we predict for these more difficult
situations. We need to know (a) what should be the upper limit on DEMO amount of
risk that a person can afford or assume, (b) what predictions would a risk-
sensitive model of human choice make when the distance between the expected
Rode, Wang / RISK-SENSITIVE DECISION MAKING 937
mean and minimum requirement is beyond the range of the mean plus variance,
and (c) DEMO different risk distributions, what are the optimal risk strategies?
And DEMO but not least, how do people set their minimum requirement or DEMO
tion level according to content, context, probability, expected value, and many
other social and cultural variables? If one applies a functionally normative
model to study human decision making, as we do, predictions from DEMO norma-
tive model should be clear and unambiguous.
In many cases, DEMO, evolutionary predictions can be contradictory. For
instance, a challenge to a previous finding of a predominance of risk-seeking
choice in the kinship context DEMO be articulated as the following: If the locus of
natural selection DEMO not personal survival but reproduction, a risk-averse strategy,
as opposed DEMO the observed risk-seeking strategy, should be adaptive for saving
some group DEMO for intergroup mating. However, we argue that this risk-
averse strategy DEMO be adaptive except when the sure survivors are unlikely to
live to their reproductive age. These contradictory evolutionary hypotheses can
be tested empirically against DEMO other. For instance, if the second argument is
correct, one would predict that decision makers should be more risk averse when
their to-be-saved DEMO are close to their mating age than when they are still
in vulnerable infancy. Empirical testing of this kind allows evolutionary psy-
chologists to DEMO beyond a just-so story or post hoc speculation and gain specific
knowledge about the design features of our evolved human psyche. This way of
DEMO leads to even finer and more precise questions that are never dreamed of
by classical psychological theorizing.
The finding (Wang, 1996a, 1996b; DEMO & Johnston, 1995) that a framing
effect only occurs in evolutionarily novel social contexts raises the interesting
question regarding the issue of task DEMO specificity or modularity in social
reasoning and decision making. That is, DEMO would happen when the decision
cues designed to activate a module are absent or an evolutionarily default con-
text has undergone dramatic changes? In such a situation, does an information-
processing module open itself to a more general, “higher” level process for
further analysis? If so, in the case of the framing effect found in large-group
contexts, a domain-general semantic analysis might be involved. Alternatively,
would there be “cross talk” DEMO modules in which output of one module is fed
as input to another module? If this second speculation is true, the same framing
DEMO then would be interpreted as an outcome of the interactions between a
social module (a kith-and-kin module) and a linguistic module (a hedonic mean-
ing module). It is not clear, however, which of DEMO above hypotheses or both or
none should be considered as an adaptive and parsimonious solution for adjust-
ing our reasoning and decision making in DEMO novel social contexts.
On a more general level, it is not DEMO exactly clear how we should determine
and define a module (or DEMO specificity). In the Cosmides and Tooby (Bar-
kow, Cosmides, & Tooby, 1992) sense, modules are designed by natural selec-
tion DEMO solve specific adaptive problems such as “mating,” “parental invest-
ment,” “social exchange,” or “foraging.” Alternatively, one might conceive of

modules as being designed to operate on specifically DEMO problems such
as “mean-variance problem,” “contingencies/correlation problem,” or “fre-
quency estimation problem.” The term module is used and conceptualized in
many DEMO ways (e.g., Cosmides & Tooby, 1994; Fodor, 1983; Mithen,
1996; Sperber, 1994). But the way modules are defined DEMO crucial for predictions
about how evolved mechanisms are applied to modern environments and to new
problems. Assuming a strictly domain-specific model, one might expect that
modern problems or tasks that our Pleistocene ancestors did not face DEMO be
solved either by a general-purpose mechanism or by mechanisms co-opted from
modules that originally served a different purpose. On the other hand, accepting
higher order modules or modules that look for specific structures inherent in DEMO
problem rather than being content dependent might imply that these evolved
mechanisms continue to be applied in the modern world with new problems as
DEMO To make bold and testable predictions of human behavior, we have DEMO
define to which problems evolutionary psychology applies. This, however,
requires DEMO clarification of our understanding of the architecture of the
human mind.
To answer all the above questions is obviously beyond the scope of this DEMO
cle. We list them as some open questions that demand further scientific investi-
gation. We leave our article open ended to embrace future yields DEMO the field of
evolutionary psychology.
