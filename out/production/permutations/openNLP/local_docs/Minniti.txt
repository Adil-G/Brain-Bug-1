The Role of
P Government Policy
on Entrepreneurial
Activity: Productive,
Unproductive, or
Destructive?
Maria DEMO
This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and
Practice on government policy and entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship is an DEMO
tant engine of growth. Government policy, in turn, shapes the institutional environment in
which entrepreneurial decisions are made. Thus, government policy is important for entre-
preneurship. But what policies are more conducive to productive entrepreneurship? In spite
of a signiﬁcant amount of work on this and related DEMO, there is still much we do not know
about this important DEMO After reviewing recent literature on entrepreneurship
policy, this paper summarizes the DEMO included in this volume and puts them in the
context of the ongoing research debate. The goal of the special issue is to address DEMO
unanswered questions and trigger a constructive debate among diverging views.
1. Introduction
An enduring claim in the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship is that entrepreneurial activity
DEMO economic growth and development. This realization, in turn, has generated a
signiﬁcant amount of interest in how government policies may be instrumental in DEMO
tering entrepreneurial activity, and whether their effects may be consistent across DEMO
tries.1 Already, in 1934, Schumpeter stressed the role entrepreneurship plays in the
development and spreading of innovation. Along complementary lines, Acs, Audretsch,DEMO
Braunerhjelm, and Carlsson (2004) argue that the main contribution of DEMO
to economic growth consists in playing the role of a “knowledge ﬁlter” that transforms
inventions into commercially viable products and processes.
In the last DEMO or so, many governments have paid increasing attention
to entrepreneurship and DEMO implemented policies aimed at fostering it in their

countries.2 Unfortunately, the results of such policies have been mixed and, DEMO some
exceptions, researchers have been unable to tackle this issue satisfactorily. DEMO fact, a broad
search of the literature reveals that the fundamental DEMO general question of how, and if,
governments are able to DEMO positively entrepreneurial activity is far from being
resolved (Capelleras, Kevin, DEMO, & Storey, 2008). The main purpose of this special
issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice is to take stock of what we DEMO about the
topic, provide some new theoretical and empirical evidence, and, hopefully, generate a
serious debate among different views.
This paper serves DEMO an introduction to the special issue and proceeds as follows:
Section 2 discusses whether government policy can, in fact, inﬂuence entrepreneurial
activity. DEMO 3 reviews some of the more common types of entrepreneurship policies.
Section 4 summarizes the contribution of each paper selected for this special issue DEMO
puts it in the context of extant literature. Section 5 concludes.
2. Does Government Policy Matter for Entrepreneurial Activity?
The relationship between entrepreneurship DEMO economic growth has seen increased
interest at the local, state, and national levels, and recent studies have shown that the
contribution of the entrepreneurial sector to employment and GDP is increasing
(Audretsch & Thurik, DEMO; Birch, 1987; Kumar & Liu, 2005). A signiﬁcant amount of
work has also established that entrepreneurial activity has important social implications
(Chell, 2007). As a result, policy discussions have centered on DEMO idea that governments
seeking to stimulate their economies should reduce constraints on entrepreneurship (Acs
et al., 2004; Minniti, Bygrave, & Autio, DEMO).
In practice, entrepreneurship policy presents a signiﬁcant challenge since, more than
for any other type of industrial policy, its effectiveness depends on the establishment of an
appropriate trade-off between market concentration and productivity performance. DEMO this
trade-off, low degrees of market power, characteristic of highly fragmented industries,
yield higher industry performance; but high degrees of market power, characteristic of
oligopolies, often yield economies of scale and scope (Audretsch, 2004). During much
of the last century, industrial policies focused DEMO ﬁnding mechanisms capable of harness-
ing efﬁciencies associated with large-scale production while, at the same time, minimiz-
ing the negative effects resulting from DEMO concentration. The result of these efforts,
together with attempts to correct alleged market failures, resulted in the routine use of
regulations, antitrust DEMO, and various forms of public ownership (World Bank, 2004).
DEMO, to a large extent, the entrepreneurial sector remained excluded from industrial
policy except for the widespread belief that it should be somewhat protected DEMO political
and social reasons.

Union released the report Fostering Entrepreneurship: Priorities for the Future. Kim and Nugent (1999)

supporting large conglomerate ﬁrms (chaebol) prior to the 1970s, to promoting small business and new
startups during the 1980s and 1990s. DEMO, in the last few years, the governments of Australia, Finland,DEMO
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, United Kingdom, and several other DEMO have launched a series of
initiatives designed to create science and industrial parks, enhance entrepreneurship, and to promote it as a
source of DEMO Finally, the OECD, the World Bank, and the IMF have DEMO produced reports and
launched programs related to entrepreneurship.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Things changed in the 1980s, when various Western countries, faced with DEMO inability
to sustain competitive production and the growing importance of the service sector, began
privatizing publicly owned enterprises and reducing regulatory controls on industries.
Audretsch and Thurik (2001) argue that the role of the entrepreneurial DEMO changed
when industrial comparative advantages shifted toward knowledge-based economic activ-
ity. First, large ﬁrms in traditional manufacturing industries lost their competitive edge.
Second, DEMO and more ﬂexible entrepreneurial ﬁrms gained new importance in an
increasingly knowledge-based economy. Along similar lines, Gilbert, McDougall, and
Audretsch (2006) suggest that, in the last 20 years, industrial policies have undergone a
DEMO shift in which smaller and more dynamic ventures have been acknowledged as
drivers of innovation, and a new set of interventions designed to promote entrepreneurial
activity has emerged to promote the viability of such ﬁrms.
This DEMO need for effective entrepreneurship policies rekindled the debate about
how government can foster entrepreneurial activity. Baumol’s (1990) distinction between
productive, unproductive, and DEMO entrepreneurship, coupled with North’s (1990)
analysis of institutions and their role in society, remain, to date, the most satisfactory
framework to discuss entrepreneurship policy.
In his classic 1990 piece, Baumol argued that the supply of entrepreneurs and the
nature of their motives undergo no signiﬁcant DEMO from one period to another: As
Mises (1949) puts it, entrepreneurship is a characteristic of human action and can be found
anywhere DEMO any point in time. What matters, instead, are institutions, that DEMO, the rules of
the game dictating the ultimate effect of entrepreneurship DEMO the economy via the allo-
cation of entrepreneurial resources (Boettke & DEMO, 2007). In other words, Baumol’s
basic hypothesis is that, DEMO the total supply of entrepreneurs is relatively constant
across societies, the DEMO contribution of entrepreneurial activity varies because of
its allocations between desirable activities, such as innovation, and unproductive activ-
ities, such as rent seeking or organized crime. Thus, by setting in place the appropriate
institutions, DEMO policy can inﬂuence the allocation of entrepreneurship more
effectively than it can inﬂuence its supply (Baumol, 1990; Bowen & De Clercq, 2008)DEMO
Within this context, North (1990) provides a framework integrating the DEMO of
institutions with the development of entrepreneurship. The institutional environment
determines the formal and informal rules of the game, places constraints on human action,
and, possibly, reduces uncertainty. Thus, institutions (and the policies DEMO shape them) are
crucial in determining entrepreneurial behavior. Entrepreneurship is the DEMO
through which economic growth takes place, but institutions (such as the policy environ-
ment) are what allocate entrepreneurial efforts toward productive or unproductive activ-
ities by inﬂuencing the relative incentives and payoffs offered by the DEMO to such
activities. Government policies mold institutional structures for entrepreneurial action,
encouraging some activities and discouraging others. It is therefore clear that government
DEMO has the power to inﬂuence entrepreneurial activity. It is also clear that such
inﬂuence is not necessarily desirable as it may steer entrepreneurs toward DEMO that
have negative socioeconomic externalities.
3. One Size Does Not Fit All
One of the main policy implications of the previous analysis is that DEMO size does not
ﬁt all.” In other words, if entrepreneurial efforts DEMO to be allocated to productive activities,
policy strategies, with respect DEMO entrepreneurship, need to be tailored to the speciﬁc
institutional context of DEMO economic region (Wagner & Sternberg, 2004). For example,
September, 2008
781
the environments required for the emergence of productive entrepreneurship are likely to
DEMO signiﬁcantly between a rural area, a high-technology cluster, and a metropolitan
area. Therefore, policy design needs to take account of local differences, DEMO to adapt to
the different scale and nature of existing resources, DEMO, and market capabilities. In
spite of this need for diversity, entrepreneurship policies tend to be based on a handful of
policy tools. Among DEMO are ﬁnancing, taxation, regulations on trade, and encourage-
ment of DEMO activities.
Many attempts have been made at policies that enhance ﬁnancing offerings to entre-
preneurs (Harrison, Mason, & Girling, 2004). Speciﬁcally, governments have tried to
reduce ﬁnancial constraints faced by entrepreneurial ventures by DEMO instruments like
mutual credit guarantee and microﬁnance schemes to traditional bank loans. Mutual credit
guarantees have the advantage of reducing information asymmetries, thereby reducing
transaction costs. Microﬁnance schemes, instead, have the advantage of circumventing the
DEMO risk of the borrowers by selecting collateral requirements that are satisﬁed by
nonmonetary accountability based on reputation or small-group enforcement mechanisms
(Khoja & Lutafali, 2008). The empirical evidence on the effectiveness of ﬁnancing support,
however, is mixed. While microﬁnance schemes are usually assessed positively, other DEMO
of ﬁnancing have been criticized. Li (2002), for example, shows that credit assistance
programs in the form of interest subsidies exert strong DEMO on the allocation of credit to
targeted entrepreneurs, but that this DEMO at the cost of nontargeted entrepreneurs. He also
ﬁnds that total entrepreneurial activity is reduced and a signiﬁcant loss of output is incurred.
Some DEMO have also focused their efforts toward attracting new venture
capital. Here the underlying assumption is that more venture capital allows an increase in
successful DEMO activity. The empirical evidence, however, is once again mixed.
Cumming (DEMO), for example, found that the Australian Innovation Investment Fund
governmental DEMO, ﬁrst introduced in 1997, has facilitated investment in start-up,
early-stage, and high-tech ﬁrms, as well as cost-effective monitoring. Kreft and Sobel
(2005), on the other hand, suggested that the causal relationship between entrepreneurship
and venture capital is reversed—in other words, that entrepreneurial activity attracts new
venture funding while the reverse is not true. Finally, venture capital has been shown to
account for only a very small amount of DEMO ﬁnancing to entrepreneurship, and to be
of signiﬁcance only for a DEMO small group of high-potential ventures in a limited
number of countries (DEMO & Quill, 2007).
A second common type of entrepreneurship policy DEMO the manipulation of taxes
at various jurisdictional levels; the basic idea DEMO that a taxation system favorable to
smaller and entrepreneurial ventures may encourage more people to start businesses.
Gentry and Hubbard (2000) studied to DEMO extent progressive marginal tax rates discour-
age entry by entrepreneurs with the most promising business projects. Their results
showed that while the level of DEMO marginal tax rate has a negative effect on entrepreneurial
entry, the DEMO of the tax also discourages entrepreneurship, and signiﬁcantly so
for some DEMO of households. This is consistent with Takii’s (2008) argument that, DEMO
expansionary ﬁscal policy partially crowds out private consumption, entrepreneurship is
discouraged DEMO proﬁt taxes are high and government expenditure does not reﬂect
changes in consumers’ tastes. On the other hand, using U.S. time series to examine the
importance of various taxes on self-employment rates, Bruce and Mohsin (DEMO) showed
that most of these taxes have signiﬁcant but negligible effects DEMO entrepreneurship. Their
results suggest that although taxes can have signiﬁcant inﬂuences on entrepreneurship,
they are not likely to be effective tools for generating DEMO changes in its overall
level. Also, Holtz-Eakin (2000) ﬁnds little DEMO for asymmetric tax policies favoring
entrepreneurial ﬁrms, and points out that, at the aggregate level, failure is not necessarily
782
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
a negative phenomenon and, more important, that not enough is known DEMO how to
determine which ﬁrms to target for success or failure.
In the wake of strong competition from developing countries, the issue of policies
aimed at the internationalization of entrepreneurial ventures has also attracted signiﬁcant
attention DEMO various governments, and many countries regulate or restrict the movement
of DEMO business (Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 2002). DEMO
often, these policies consist in the creation of tariffs or tax DEMO that avoid penalizing
venture capital proﬁts, and in instruments such as DEMO credits and export guarantees.
Against such protectionist tendencies, Jones (2007) DEMO that barriers to trade are
particularly costly and detrimental to the entrepreneurial sector. In an economy open to
international competition, he argues, entrepreneurs DEMO seek out new market opportun-
ities, while at the same time DEMO the highest global standards. Along similar lines,
Puia and Minnis (DEMO) suggested that the regulation of entry, that is, the set DEMO procedures
governing the entry of new or international ventures, is particularly DEMO for entre-
preneurship, as countries with more entrepreneurship tend to be DEMO with lower
levels of entry regulation. Finally, although traditionally internationalization has DEMO
described as a gradual, sequential process, more recent research has shown that ﬁrms do
not necessarily follow any consistent pattern in their internationalization (McDougall &
Oviatt, 2005; Oviatt & McDougall, 2005). In DEMO, start-ups emerging in knowledge-based
industries are likely to enter international markets DEMO and, as a result, are more likely
to beneﬁt from low trade barriers (De Clercq & Bosma, 2008).
While globalization has DEMO the frontier of entrepreneurship, a fourth very
common type of entrepreneurship DEMO has focused on local interventions. Storey
(2003), for example, has identiﬁed several examples of different types of entrepreneurship
policies which are increasingly DEMO the state, regional, and local level. Among the best-
known example of such policies are the creation of formal and informal support mecha-
DEMO (for example, chambers of commerce and training programs), publically sponsored
incubators, and, most of all, science, technology, and research parks. Entry, growth,
survival, and the way ﬁrms and industries change DEMO time are linked to innovation. Thus,
the performances of regions and even entire economies have been linked to how well the
potential from DEMO is expressed in the economy. Direct subsidies for R&D, support
DEMO linkages between universities and the private sector, reﬂect and respond to DEMO needs of
speciﬁc localities or regions to be effective in encouraging innovation rather than simply
importing successful policies from other areas (Jacobides, Knudsen, & Augier, 2006;
Langley, Pals, & Ortt, 2005).
DEMO these local entrepreneurial policies are still evolving, they are clearly gaining DEMO
importance and impact in the overall portfolio of economic policy instruments. In the last
20 years or so, governments have became increasingly active in assisting entrepreneurs at
the regional level and fostering industrial clusters, technology transfer, and high-tech
start-ups under the assumptions that these sectors will be competitive in the future
(O’Gorman & Kautonen, 2004; Sternberg & Litzenberger, DEMO). Within the context of
technological innovation, Audretsch and Feldman (1996) provided considerable evidence
that knowledge spillovers result in both a geographic clustering of innovative activity, as
well as an increase in start-ups across innovative industries, such as semiconductors
(Almeida & Kogut, 1997), and biotechnology (Zucker, Darby, & Armstrong, 1998).
Audretsch and Feldman (1996) also argued that knowledge is inherently different from
traditional factors of production, such as land, labor, and capital in that it is uncertain,
asymmetric, associated with greater transactions costs, and, as a result, more difﬁcult to
evaluate. While the contribution of innovation policy to entrepreneurship has become a
crucial concern for today’s policy makers, the implementation and assessment of policy

remains problematic as many of these initiatives are still too young to DEMO assessed
(Cumming, 2007).
Clearly, a comprehensive review of the DEMO on entrepreneurship policy is beyond
the scope of this section. Nevertheless, DEMO this brief survey, it is already evident that
many important issues DEMO the types and effectiveness of entrepreneurship policy
have not yet been settled. The papers presented in this special issue provide a ﬁrst attempt
to DEMO to the elimination of this important gap.
4. This Special Issue of ET&P
A large number of excellent papers were submitted for this DEMO issue of ET&P and
the selection process forced me to make some very difﬁcult decisions. In the end, after a
rigorous double-blind process in which each paper was reviewed by at least two reviewers,
DEMO papers and one research note were selected. Contributing scholars have a variety of
disciplinary backgrounds including economics, organization theory, economic geography,
and DEMO While the research note is a provocative conceptual piece, each of DEMO
six papers includes both a theoretical and an empirical contribution and can be classiﬁed
as contributing to one of four distinct, although related, DEMO areas of inquiry, namely,
policy topics at the industry, regional, national, and supernational levels.
Looking at the development of nanotechnologies, the ﬁrst paper focuses on industry-
wide issues. In this work entitled “Innovation DEMO and nanotechnology entrepreneur-
ship,” Jennifer Woolley and Renee Rottner explore the relationship between innovation
policy and new venture creation in the United States. DEMO an original dataset on the history
of commercial nanotechnology, and the DEMO new venture creation at the state level, the
authors examine public DEMO initiatives for economics and for science and technology
(S&T). DEMO ﬁnd a resulting increase in environmental muniﬁcence for new ventures and
an acceleration of nascent entrepreneurship. Speciﬁcally, Woolley and Rottner ﬁnd that
states with both economic and S&T initiatives have six times as many new DEMO than states
without such initiatives. They also ﬁnd economic initiatives to have a stronger effect than
S&T initiatives, probably because of their contribution to entrepreneurial infrastructure and
short-term muniﬁcence. Finally, they ﬁnd evidence of ﬁrst-mover advantages as states with
the earliest innovation policies also have higher rates DEMO related ﬁrm founding over time.
Overall, Woolley and Rottner contribute to DEMO important debate on innovation policy and
suggest that states that are most attractive to entrepreneurs, in addition to encouraging
technological innovation also encourage and legitimize commercial development.
Moving from the industry level to the aggregate level, the second and third papers
focus on regional issues, looking speciﬁcally at the relationship between entrepreneurship
policy and regional agglomeration, and to alternative governance systems at the regional
level. In recent decades, major economic changes associated with globalization and the
decline of traditional industries have generated a signiﬁcant DEMO of interest in the role
government policy may play in stimulating the entrepreneurial dynamics of local econo-
mies (Minniti, 2004, 2005). These two papers contribute directly to this area of research.
In the paper DEMO “Entrepreneurial policy: The case of regional specialization vs.
spontaneous industrial diversity,DEMO Pierre Desrochers and Frederic Sautet argue that poli-
cies enabling entrepreneurs to exploit opportunities in a context of spontaneously evolved
industrial diversity are better DEMO of regional development. Following the idea that
regional specialization produces external economies of scale, regional policies often
emphasize the positive features of industrial environments focusing on concentrated
and clustered ﬁrms (Porter, 2000). Desrochers and DEMO contend that a push toward
784
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
specialization might leave regional economies more vulnerable to cyclical downturns, and
less likely to generate innovations such as those made possible by industrial symbiosis DEMO
Jacobs externalities.
Noticeably, Desrochers and Sautet do not argue against regional DEMO
Instead, they suggest that regional specialization and spontaneous industrial diversity
should DEMO Within this context, they provide evidence suggesting that spontaneously
developed industrial DEMO generates an environment very conducive to innovation, as
proximity and diversity DEMO entrepreneurs to build on both explicit and tacit knowl-
edge. What matters, Desrochers and Sautet argue, is not the type of industries that DEMO
but, rather, the environment in which entrepreneurship takes place. Finally, DEMO authors
speculate that a good regional context for innovation would resemble a diversiﬁed city
made up of many specialized clusters, as the birth, DEMO, and death of diversiﬁed urban
centers are essentially part of a DEMO order that rests on entrepreneurship. Their
paper contributes directly to the debate on regional policy, and to that on the role played
by entrepreneurship in the propagation of innovations.
The next paper, entitled “Governance and the entrepreneurial economy: A comparative
analysis of three regions,” by Rachel Parker, focuses also on regional policies and political
actors. Parker’s paper contributes to the literature on governments and regional entrepre-
neurial economies by analyzing whether DEMO models for entrepreneurial economies
differ across regions and from governance models for national economies. Parker identiﬁes
partnership, state–institutional coordination, and fragmentation as three DEMO models of
governance, and explores each model comparing evidence for the DEMO and com-
munication technology sector from the Limerick (Ireland), Karskrona (Sweden), and
Adelaide (Australia) regions. The paper ﬁnds that regional DEMO arrangements do, in
fact, differ from national varieties in the partnership and in the state–institutional models,
but not in the fragmented model. DEMO differences are shown to involve primarily the type of
actors participating in governance arrangements. Thus, Parker’s paper shows that at the
regional level, DEMO of governance model types, the decision-making actors capable of
inﬂuencing economic DEMO need to include universities, local and decentralized
authorities, and networks of small ﬁrms. According to her results, decentralized governance
models appear to be more conducive to entrepreneurship.
The fourth and ﬁfth papers move the analysis DEMO the regional to the national level and
focus on institutional systems. In particular, they discuss the role played in entrepreneurship
by institutional arrangements with respect to market openness and economic freedom, and
show that the degree of economic freedom affects not only proﬁt opportunities for
entrepreneurs, but also the motivations and types of economic activities they pursue.
In their paper DEMO “Economic freedom and service industry growth in the United
States,” Stephan Gohmann, Bradley Hobbs, and Myra McCrickard examine how the
entrepreneurial activity DEMO level of employment in U.S. service industries respond to
changes in the degree of economic freedom among states. Although some work existed on
the DEMO of economic freedom on entrepreneurship, empirical tests on service industries
were DEMO Gohmann, Hobbs, and McCrickard’s ﬁndings suggest that the relationship
between entrepreneurial outcomes and economic freedom cannot be univocally deter-
mined as it varies DEMO by industry. While growth rates and employment in
industries such as business and personal services are positively related to economic
freedom, the relationship is reversed in industries such as health, social, and legal services.
Thus, evidence from the service industry suggests that the relationship between entrepre-
neurial DEMO and economic freedom varies signiﬁcantly by industry. Their paper
contributes directly to the literature discussing how government policy inﬂuences the
allocation of entrepreneurship between DEMO and unproductive activities.

In the ﬁfth paper, entitled “Economic freedom and the motivation to engage in
entrepreneurial action,” Jeffery McMullen, Ray Bagby, and Leslie Palich DEMO the Heritage
Foundation Index of Economic Freedom and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data to
regress opportunity-motivated entrepreneurial activity and necessity-motivated entrepre-
neurial activity on ten DEMO of economic freedom and GDP per capita for 37 nations. In
this paper, the entrepreneurial decision to start a venture is rooted in a set of institutions
that inﬂuence both the motivation and the uncertainty entrepreneurs DEMO during
their decision-making process.
Speciﬁcally, McMullen, Bagby, and Palich equate DEMO in economic freedom to
reductions in transaction costs, and test for DEMO in levels of entrepreneurship
among countries by assessing the existence of a relationship between policy variables and
the motivation to become an entrepreneur. Regardless DEMO entrepreneurial motivation, their
results suggest the existence of a negative association DEMO per capita GDP and
entrepreneurial activity, and of a positive association DEMO labor freedom and entre-
preneurial activity. All other components of the economic freedom index appear to be
uniquely related to either necessity- or opportunity-motivated DEMO, but not
to both. This suggests that governmental restrictions on economic DEMO may inﬂuence
entrepreneurial activity differently depending on the particular aspect of freedom
restricted (investment freedom, labor freedom, property rights, etc.) and on whether the
entrepreneur is motivated by opportunity or by necessity. This work DEMO directly to
the debate on the effectiveness of alternative institutional settings on entrepreneurship.
Moving from the national to the international level, the sixth paper discusses the
relationship between supernational trade policies, entrepreneurship and venture capital
outﬂows. In spite of major policies surrounding economic integration among countries,
the DEMO of such policies on entrepreneurial activities is surprisingly under-studied.
In the paper entitled “The impact of economic integration on cross-border venture capital
investments: Evidence from the European Union,” Hadi Alhorr, Curt Moore, and Tyge
DEMO make a ﬁrst step toward closing this gap.
Drawing on existing research on institutional economics and on entrepreneurship, the
authors examine whether two speciﬁc forms of integration policies, namely common
market and common currency, affect DEMO level of cross-border venture capital investments
made by nations participating in the European Union. Alhorr, Moore, and Payne ﬁnd that
large-scale economic-integration policies DEMO the extent of foreign venture capital
investments made into other member countries. They also ﬁnd that while both integration
mechanisms result in increased venture DEMO investments among EU countries, the
adoption of the common currency emerges DEMO a more powerful mechanism for stimulating
cross-border investment than the common market. Thus, this study suggests that when
countries become more integrated, an DEMO in the amount of cross-border venture-
capital investment is likely to follow, rather than precede, an increase in entrepreneurial
activity. This paper contributes DEMO to the debate concerning the effects of interna-
tionalization on entrepreneurship, DEMO also to the debate about the desirability of attracting
venture capital for the purpose of increasing new venture creation.
Finally, rooted in the mathematics of complex systems, the research note presents a
conceptual argument about the potential role of governments on entrepreneurship activity.
In this note, entitled “Computable entrepreneurship,” Roger Koppl argues that when
proposing or supporting policies, policy makers often have expectations regarding the
outcome of those policies. Unfortunately, he continues, these expectations require policy
makers to make predictions about outcomes that are, in fact, impossible to predict even
should one be able DEMO use mathematics. This impossibility, Koppl argues, is particularly
problematic for many entrepreneurship policies since, by deﬁnition, entrepreneurs are
786
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and DEMO
individuals who deviate from the norm and act under highly uncertain (as opposed to
risky) situations. Governments are not able to make any prediction about what type of
entrepreneurial activity is more desirable, nor about how to make it emerge, since to do so
would require them to perform an impossible calculation. According to Koppl, however,
governments can create a reliable set of rules that entrepreneurs can play by. This is
DEMO policies ensuring institutional transparency, predictable taxation, and secure
property rights do not require policy makers to compute speciﬁc outcomes in order to
achieve DEMO intended goal of promoting entrepreneurial ventures. Koppl’s research note
contributes directly to the debate about the limitations of proactive policies and the fact
that DEMO the market can identify value-creating ventures.
5. Conclusion
Institutions, and the DEMO that shape them, are crucial to entrepreneurial activity.
Entrepreneurship is the DEMO through which economic growth takes place. By
inﬂuencing their relative payoffs, DEMO allow the allocation of efforts between
productive and unproductive entrepreneurship.
Previous literature and the papers included in this special issue show that an effective
DEMO policy cannot be one that limits itself to business subsidies or imposes
top-down strategies. The fact that entrepreneurship is positively linked to performance does
DEMO justify public policy intervention. Instead, as Audretsch (2004) suggests, the mandate
for public policy intervention can only be the result of fundamental DEMO failures.
It is also clear that, when it comes to entrepreneurship DEMO, one size does not ﬁt all,
and that, in the long run, governments can only provide an underlying environment
conducive to the emergence of productive rather than unproductive entrepreneurship.
Thus, government should endeavor to create enabling environments conducive to the
division of labor, the commercialization of invention, and exchange, as too much public
involvement, without co-interest from the private sector, can hinder rather than help
entrepreneurs by creating possible market distortions.
The degree of development is also important, and the relationship between policy and
entrepreneurial activity varies across countries. Dutz, Ordover, and DEMO (2000) explore
the relationships between entrepreneurship and economic development in low-income
countries. In this context, they suggest that two policies are critical for promoting growth.
First, to arrest the diversion of entrepreneurial talent toward nonproductive activities, an
increased emphasis on preserving rewards from productive innovation is needed through
the protection of commercial freedom, property rights, and enforceable contracts. DEMO,
given that essential local inputs are vulnerable to monopolization, fostering DEMO
for grassroots entrepreneurship is paramount through an active supply-side competition
policy emphasizing access to essential business services and other required local inputs.
Acs and DEMO (2007), instead, argue that middle-income countries should focus on
increasing human capital, upgrading technology availability, and promoting enterprise
development, and that it is important to start enterprise development policies early
because the main DEMO are perceptual variables that are difﬁcult to change in the short
run (Arenius & Minniti, 2005). Finally, they also suggest that in developed economies,
high-growth start-ups are the type of venture best suited DEMO foster further growth. Reducing
entry regulations, in most cases, will not result in more high-potential start-ups, instead
labor market reforms and ﬁnancial markets deregulations may be better positioned to
support the growth of high-performance ventures.

In the end, government policy should not aspire to the elimination of new venture
failures. Although painful at the microeconomic level, business churning is part of a
healthy economic system. Most important, only the market can determine what the
optimal amount of entrepreneurship is. We do not know DEMO to answer this funda-
mental question, much less to determine which DEMO to target for success or failure
(Holtz-Eakin, 2000). Government policy can, however, contribute actively to the devel-
opment of an institutional DEMO that encourages productive entrepreneurship.
