Abstract
In economic DEMO decisions often differ from game-theoretic predictions. Why are
people generous in one-shot ultimatum games with strangers? Is there a benefit to
generosity toward strangers? Research on the neural substrates of decisions suggests that
some choices are hormone-dependent. By artificially stimulating subjects with neuroactive
hormones, we can identify which hormones and brain regions participate in decision-
making, to what degree and in what direction. Can a hormone make a person generous
while another DEMO? In this paper, two laboratory experiments are described using the
hormones oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). Concentrations of these
hormones in the brain continuously change in response to external stimuli. OT enhances
DEMO (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b), reduce fear from strangers (C. Sue Carter 1998), and
has anti-anxiety effects (Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Maria DEMO 2005). AVP enhances
attachment and bonding with kin in monogamous male mammals (Jennifer N. Ferguson et
al. 2002) and increases reactive aggression (C. Sue Carter 2007). Dysfunctions of OT
and/or AVP reception DEMO been associated with autism (Miranda M. Lim et al. 2005).
DEMO Chapter One I review past experiments with the ultimatum (UG) and dictator (DG) games
and visit some of the major results in DEMO literature. In Chapter Two I present the results of
my laboratory experiment where I examine why people are generous in one-shot economic
games with DEMO I hypothesize that oxytocin would enhance generosity in the UG.
Players in the OT group were much more generous than those in the placebo—OT DEMO in
the UG were 80% higher than offers on placebo. Enhanced generosity was not due to
altruism as there was no effect on DG DEMO This implies that other-regarding preferences
are at play in the amount of money sent but only in a reciprocal context. The third chapter
presents DEMO experiment on punishment. I hypothesized that AVP would increase rejections
and stinginess in the UG and TG. Results show that AVP affects rejections and DEMO in
small groups but not in large ones. Chapter Four contains the summary of future research
suggestions.

Introduction
Some of the limitations of the Homo economicus models in game-theory DEMO effectively
illustrated by robust empirical findings from games, such as the DEMO game, dictator game,
trust game, prisoners’ dilemma, and public DEMO games. In lab experiments, game-theoretic
equilibrium outcomes are typically not achieved DEMO the participants. Robust experimental
research results suggest that there are many factors included in human decision-making that
are not included in the predicted game-theoretic DEMO of decision-making (Joseph Patrick
Henrich et al. 2001). Economics and DEMO theory are based on the assumption that people can
predict the actions of others; backward induction, iterated eliminations, and the Nash
Equilibrium (DEMO) require a system of beliefs about the decisions of others. These DEMO
are based on people’s understanding other people’s motives and beliefs (Tania DEMO, Ernst
Fehr 2005). This dissertation focuses on understanding two motives, generosity and stinginess,
in the play of two economic games: ultimatum game (UG) and dictator game (DG) in laboratory
environment under DEMO influence of two naturally occurring hormone neuropeptides, oxytocin
(OT) and DEMO vasopressin (AVP), which are administered to half of the subjects, leaving
the other half on placebo.
In each game two anonymous subjects DEMO one-shot games with their show-up fee, which they
are dividing between DEMO in some manner. The purpose and the strategy of the two
games are different. In the DG, decision-maker1 (DM1) receives $10 and is told that he may
send any part of that to an anonymous DEMO in the room (DM2). DM1 may decide to send no
DEMO at all and DM2 must accept that decision. There is no further exchange, the game is
over. Sub-game perfect Nash Equilibrium (SGPNE) suggests that DM1 earns $10 and DM2 $0,
but in laboratory experiments DEMO average amount sent is between $1.50 and $5 dependent
upon how (DEMO, double-blind, known identity) and where (what country) the game DEMO played,
with the mean offers of 20% of the stash, DEMO around 20% of the subjects send the NE of $0
(various DEMO summarized by (Colin Camerer 2003) pages 57-58).  The UG DEMO an
additional step: DM2 may reject DM1’s offer, in which case neither of them earns any money.
Thus, the strategy here for DM1 is to allocate “just enough” money to DM2 to have the offer
DEMO, in which case they both earn the amount agreed to. The DEMO Perfect NE in
the UG is $9 to DM1 and $1 to DM2 but in laboratory experiments this is rarely achieved. Offers
range between DEMO or $4 and offers smaller than $3 are rejected by half of the participants;
about 75% of  the subjects send an even split (Werner Güth et al. 1982; Daniel Kahneman et
al. 1986; Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2005; Colin F. Camerer, Richard H. Thaler DEMO; Colin
F. Camerer 2003; pages 50-55). In the UG, DEMO needs to have some understanding of what is
an acceptable offer so that DM2 would accept.
It is widely accepted that human social bonds DEMO characterized by acts of altruism (Stephanie
L. Brown, R. Michael Brown 2005;Herbert Gintis et al. 2003;Herbert Gintis 2002). Humans are
DEMO to benefit others at a cost to themselves in a variety of way. Reciprocal altruism is a form
of altruism in which the altruist DEMO in direct exchange with the recipient of the benefit and is
expecting a reciprocation for the help provided (Robert L. Trivers 1971). This type of altruism is
found in the trust game (TG), in which DM1 can send any part of his lab-given endowment to
DM2. DEMO amount sent triples en route to DM2, who can choose to DEMO any part of the triple-
stash back. The SGPNE for DM1 is to send $0 to DM2 but in lab experiments, typically 40% of
the money is sent to DM2s who send back about a third DEMO the tripled amount (Colin Camerer
2003).
Another type of altruism, introduced by Richard Alexander, is indirect altruism (also called
indirect reciprocity) (R. D. Alexander 1979). In indirect altruism there is no expectation of
reciprocation from the person who receives the benefit but there is DEMO from someone else in
the society in the future. Indirect reciprocity involves reputation and status (Martin A. Nowak,
Karl Sigmund 1998) (Martin A. Nowak, Karl Sigmund 2005) and so it provides weak support DEMO
one-shot anonymous games where reputation building is not possible. Nonetheless, in DEMO UG,
1
we find evidence of indirect reciprocity in generous offers and punishment of DEMO whose
offers are not generous enough. Vernon Smith suggested some people might just be
“preprogrammed to engage naturally in acts of positive reciprocity” (page 11) (Vernon L. Smith
1998b). But this “preprogramming” does not DEMO an answer for “why” people make the type
of other-regarding decisions they make. Finally, there is what we call pure altruism (direct
altruism), in which people provide benefits to others without expectation of any future benefit to
themselves. This type of altruism we find in the DG.
DEMO UG decision might rest on different prosocial emotions from the DG, DEMO if it does, it might
be direct-reciprocity (reciprocal-altruism as per Trivers), except that here too, the games are
one-shot and the individuals don’t know and don’t see each other. Yet as there is a DEMO
response of the anonymous stranger by either accepting or rejecting the offer, there is a direct
connection between the two players. The results of the experiments I conducted provide
answers to these questions in Chapter Two. DEMO in the UG is also debated as one of two
kinds. In one sense the rejection might be other-regarding because the rejection is costly DEMO
DM2 and it also punishes DM1 for sending an unfair offer (DEMO J-F. DeQuervain et al. 2004; John
H. Kagel et al. 1996; Ernst Fehr, Simon Gachter 2002; Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2006)DEMO This
is sometimes referred to as “second-order punishment” (Mizuho Shinada et DEMO 2004; Karthik
Panchanathan, Robert Boyd 2004). In the other sense the rejection maybe purely self-
regarding and is the result of spite DEMO anger for not receiving what is considered to be fair. The
results of the experiment presented in Chapter Two indicate which group may be DEMO
Results of reported laboratory experiments using economic games show that cooperation is a
primary and integral part of human economic exchanges. Individuals form and DEMO social
bonds using sympathy and empathy and provide benefits to others through helping and
generosity (Stephanie D. Preston, Frans B. M. de Waal DEMO; Joseph Patrick Henrich et al.
2005; Adam Smith 1892). Empathy provides the feeling or the imagination of how another
person feels in DEMO to a particular event and it helps in the understanding and predictions
of others’ thoughts and intentions; it is a robust process that underpins prosocial as well as
antisocial behavior (Cameron Anderson, Dacher Keltner 2002; George Ainslie, Nick Haslam
2002). Empathy reflects on prosocial behaviors that help form attachment between people in a
society, which often leads to generosity and altruism (Stephanie D. Preston, Frans B. M. de
Waal DEMO). Generosity is part of a variety of prosocial emotions, such DEMO altruism, reciprocity,
kindness, fairness, or doing something good (Michael Lewis 2002; Margery Lucas, Laura
Wagner 2005; Catherine C. Eckel, DEMO J. Grossman 1998; Gary E. Bolton et al. 1998; Frank
Fincham, Julian Barling 1978).
To see whether the decision of how much money is sent in the UG is self-regarding or other-
regarding, specific hormones influencing the associated different behaviors may be used. My
experiment used DEMO common hormones that are always present to varying levels in the human
brain, one of which is known to assist in forming attachments while the other often acting in the
opposite direction (in animal studies). Recent research on the neural substrates of decision-
making suggests that some DEMO is hormone dependent. By artificially stimulating
human subjects with different levels of hormones that they already possess, it is possible to
identify if those hormones participate in a particular decision-making and identify brain regions
affecting decisions. DEMO is associated with prosocial behavior. It plays a central role in regulating
positive social interactions, such as attachment and bonding and affects both social behavior
and the mechanisms underlying social behavior (Karen L. Bales, C. DEMO Carter 2002; R.
Landgraf, I. D. Neumann 2004; D. Huber DEMO al. 2005; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Paul J. Zak,
Ahlam Fakhar 2006; Paul J. Zak et al. 2005b; Paul J. Zak et DEMO 2004; C. Sue Carter 1998;
Kristin M. Kramer et al. DEMO; Alison B. Wismer Fries et al. 2005; James P. Curley, DEMO B.
Keverne 2005; Eric B. Keverne, James P. Curley 2004).
Experiments have shown that manipulating OT levels in the brain influences how DEMO
perceive their environment (Jan Born et al. 2002; Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b). OT seems to
permit humans to overcome their anxiety DEMO dealing with strangers in social context (Kerstin
2
Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Maria Peterson 2005; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg et
al. 2005).  Research shows that OT crosses the blood-brain barrier after intranasal
administration (Jan Born et al. 2002), providing a simple method for studying its affect on
humans in a one-shot economic exchange with strangers DEMO lab environment.
Humans can understand and predict the intentions, beliefs, and desires of others and have the
capacity to share the feelings of DEMO; this is referred to as empathy (Tania Singer, Ernst Fehr
DEMO;Jim Proctor 2005). Thus the neural processes underlying empathy are of interest in the
understanding of prosocial behaviors because it is an important DEMO in one person’s
recognition of the other’s need, which might render DEMO emotions other-regarding, providing
the motivational basis for other-regarding behavior (Tania Singer, Ernst Fehr 2005). Offering
generous help is a component of empathy (Cameron Anderson, Dacher Keltner 2002;Michael
Lewis 2002;Stephanie D. Preston, Frans B. M. de Waal 2002a). Increased OT levels may
induce DEMO empathy (Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Maria Peterson 2005). OT is hypothesized to
influence subjects to behave more generously in prosocial decision-making.
AVP has multiple, oftentimes conflicting, roles. AVP may enhance attachment and bonding with
kin in monogamous males (aiding social recognition of conspecifics in animal experiments)
(DEMO N. Ferguson et al. 2002). AVP is also associated with aggressiveness with respect to
kin protection and reactive aggression (C. Sue Carter 2007). Lack of OT, in some research,
dysfunction of AVP receptors, have been associated with autism, a frequent human disorder
with symptoms DEMO socially withdrawn behavior (Miranda M. Lim et al. 2005; C. Sue Carter
2007). AVP also controls the resorption of water by the DEMO, regulates the osmotic content
of blood, and at high doses increases blood pressure (WO Foye et al. 1995). Research also
suggests that paradigms in which animals have to cope with intense stressor are controlled DEMO
both AVP and OT (Mario Engelmann et al. 1996).
In DEMO One I present a historical background of research with the UG and the DG; a
synthesis of the findings and the methods used. Chapter Two and Chapter Three present the
results of two experiments with the DEMO and DG using OT (Chapter Two) and AVP (Chapter
Three)DEMO I provide a brief conclusion with summary of findings and recommendations for future
research in Chapter Four.

Chapter One
Historical Background
Most neoclassical economic models assume an agent to DEMO maximizing to obtain the highest
possible well-being (based on the expected DEMO theory) given available information about
opportunities with constraints that are both DEMO and institutional. This model has become
known as the Homo economicus model. The self-regarding Nash equilibrium predicts that in the
DG a Homo economicus DEMO behave self-regarding and keep all of the money, $10 in this
DEMO, and send nothing to the an anonymous player-partner if the game DEMO played only
once and the subjects don’t have the chance to learn about the actions of the other. Thus, if
such agents receive “$10 in manna from experimental heaven and [are] asked whether they
would like DEMO share some of it with a stranger,” many say they do (Colin F. Camerer, Richard H.
Thaler 1995).
However, experiments with small manna, big manna, culturally diverse experiments—including
indigenous people in tribes—face-to-face, blind, double-blind, and in general, experiments in
any shape or form over the past twenty years provide robust evidence that in one-shot games
DEMO don’t obey the rules of the NE. The question then becomes “why not” and “what rule do
people obey?” To answer these questions DEMO the perspective of past research, this
introduction is set out to DEMO literature that spans over two hundred years, starting with
Darwin and DEMO Smith, and ending with the most recent concepts and experimental findings.
DEMO interference and mistaken concepts played a key role in our developing
understanding and is highlighted when necessary to advance my thought.
I chose to DEMO the UG and DG in my experiments because they help us gain more knowledge
beyond a simple understanding of how people play these games. DEMO infrastructure,
business operations, and institutions evolve uniquely to fit the DEMO culture of each specific
society. Economic exchanges frequently involve cooperation, reciprocity, and trust that enable
decision makers to plan, reduce risk, diversify DEMO and income sources, and plan for both the
short and long DEMO “Most anthropologists would hardly be surprised by a finding that cultural
ideas about sharing and cooperation prevent participants in economics experiments from acting
in DEMO narrowly defined self-interest” (Michael Chibnik 2005; pages 201-206) but traditional
DEMO has excluded hypotheses of other sciences in order to retain its simple and elegant
models that seemed to work well—before experimental economics was born DEMO pointed out
that they actually do not work all that well and aren’t nearly as simple as game theory posits.
Experimental results show that DEMO economic activity is a function of the biological and
cultural makeup of each individual. These games are often used as parts of economic
experiments DEMO laboratory settings with US and other Western university students as subjects.
In recent past, they have been adapted to experiments in other cultures, DEMO as a study in 15
small-scale societies (Joseph Patrick Henrich et DEMO 2005) and others in other parts of the world
(Hessel Oosterbeek et al. 2004; Michael Gurven 2004; Swee-Hoon Chuah et al. 2005; Laura
Schechter 2006).
While humans behave similarly across some cultures in DEMO they often show other-regarding
behavior, the degree to which they are DEMO seems to be culture specific.
Interestingly, in nearly all cultures, there are some individuals who are selfish and leave little for
DM2 in DEMO UG. However, in nearly all cases, such acts are punished by rejection. In Henrich et
al.’s study, the Au and Gnau of Papua New Guinea rejected offers even above 50% of the
stash. Rejecting such DEMO offers sounds unreasonable but it may have a cultural
foundation that is not immediately obvious to an outsider. In some societies, like the Au and
Gnau villages and throughout Melanesia, accepting gifts of any kind creates a strong obligation
to reciprocate at some future time. Debts accumulate, and place the receiver in a “subordinate
status… As a consequence, excessively large gifts, especially unsolicited ones, will frequently
be refused” (Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2005; page 811).

Human Brain as an Economic Adaptive Mechanism
It has been suggested that DEMO coming from neuroscience, the study of how the brain
works, “cannot refute economic models because the latter make no assumptions and draw no
DEMO about the physiology of the brain” (Faruk Gul, Wolfgang Pesendorfer 2005; page
2). In their opinion, thus, decision-making of an individual, though is conducted by the brain as
part of a higher-order processing mechanism, is separate from the mechanism of how that
decision is derived. While we certainly cannot separate the actions of the brain from the DEMO
itself, what they suggested has some merit, once put differently. Perhaps they should have said
that some economic models make no assumptions about DEMO environment in which the agents
make economic exchanges and that they do not make any assumption about the context in
which those exchanges are DEMO either. The problem has always been that of complexity
because including all the factors that a real human uses to make a decision would
DEMO clutter economic models and make their use impossible. However, if heuristics
DEMO not lead to the same result as the economic models of the same decision-task, we cannot
say that the models we now have are complete. The trick is to find just how much information
we must DEMO about the environment and the context such that we can predict the correct
economic behavior without making the mathematics impossible.
It is necessary to DEMO at human economic exchanges with a view that includes the context in
which the decisions are made. This necessitates our understanding of both the DEMO
environment in which exchanges take place and also the “internal” environment, DEMO one within
the brain, because forever changing levels of hormones encourage DEMO moods and
desires that are not necessarily explainable by linear relationships, DEMO theory,
unchanging order of preferences between goods, and global optimum DEMO all possible options.
Physiology is the study of all the biological functions of living organisms. Thus, if economics is
the study of exchanges that living people make, then economics is the study of human
physiology as it relates to those economic exchanges—this is neuroeconomics. The physiology
of the DEMO cannot be disconnected from the functions of the brain any more than the economic
exchanges of a person can be disconnected from thinking about DEMO actions with the use of
his or her brain. The human brain is the headquarters of human actions; humans with diseases
or damage to their brain show us the different economic decisions the brain can make DEMO to its
internal environment. Let me visit the birth of the conflict in economic thought and why
economists play games, such as the UG and the DG.
The Start of Adaptive Decision-Making
Adam Smith mentions sympathy (as “fellow-feeling”), passions and how preferences are born in
the Theory DEMO Moral Sentiments:
Neither is it those circumstances only, which create DEMO or sorrow, that call forth
our fellow-feeling. Whatever is the passion DEMO arises from any object in the
person principally concerned, an analogous DEMO springs up, at the thought of
his situation, in the breast of every attentive spectator (page 5, Adam Smith 1892)
The DEMO passage is often quoted in literature as the leading “passion” statement of Smith
together a disclaimer like “oh well, it is in the Moral Sentiments, after all.” It is less often
discussed that Smith refers to passion in his other book too:
With regard to profusion, the principle which prompts to expence, is the passion for
present enjoyment; DEMO, though sometimes violent and very difficult to be
restrained, is in general only momentary and occasional (pages 281-282, Adam
Smith 1909).
DEMO this passage, Smith indicates that people sometimes spend more than they DEMO to; e.g.
their emotions carry them away from making purely economic DEMO Adam Smith
5
understood that humans’ utility functions might have immeasurable, thus non-maximizable,
values as well.
Explorations of Decision-Making through UG and DG
The debate using DEMO games is that human subjects don’t appear to be consistent with the
game theoretical predictions of choosing the optimum solution from the particular bundle; that is
they are not choosing their equilibrium solution. Furthermore, there is significant variation in the
way that they appear to be inconsistent, and this variation has shown to be age and culture
specific.
Choosing an DEMO bundle is considered to be a distinguishing mental process; decision-
making DEMO on emotions and gut-feelings were reserved for the naïve and underdeveloped.
Ironically, it was found that
…younger children behave more selfishly, but gradually DEMO more fair-mindedly
[other-regarding] as they grow older, up to age 22 DEMO so… An important exception
is that about one third of autistic children and adults offer nothing in the UG (E. Hill,
D. Sally 2004); …[they] behave, ironically, in accordance with the canonical model
(Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2005; page 799).
As humans grow older, they typically change from self-regarding persons to become more
other-regarding. Camerer and Thaler describe fairness too as a learnt manner (Colin F.
Camerer, Richard H. Thaler 1995). Indeed, Murnighan and Saxon found that DEMO of fairness
and sharing do not appear until past third grade (DEMO Murnighan, Keith & Michael S. Saxon
1998). In their experiment, the most income maximizing DM2s were kindergartners (J. Keith
Murnighan, Michael DEMO Saxon 1998).
Even non-human primates are capable of grasping the meaning of economic exchanges; non-
human primates have been playing ultimatum and dictator games—albeit their researchers did
not explicitly state such claim1.
1 Brosnan, de Waal, and many others, tested for emotions and reasoning in non-human DEMO (Sarah F.
Brosnan, Frans B. M. de Waal 2003; Sarah DEMO Brosnan, Frans B. M. de Waal 2004b; Sarah F. Brosnan,
Frans B. M. de Waal 2002; Sarah F. Brosnan, Frans B. DEMO de Waal 2004c; Sarah F. Brosnan, Frans B. M.
de Waal 2000; Sarah F. Brosnan, Frans B. M. de Waal 2004a; H Smith et al. 1998; Frans B. M. de Waal
1997). In their test of Capuchin monkey cooperation, Bosnan et al. formulated an experiment that reveals
interesting similarity to humans playing UG and DG. They set DEMO pairs of Capuchin monkeys in two cages
separated by a small fence and trained them to trade work for food. Two see-through bowls were DEMO
outside these cages. Sometimes they were filled with food for one Capuchin, sometimes for the other one,
or for both.  Brosnan’s team DEMO weights to the levers so that cooperative pull was necessary; e.g., if
the bowl for one Capuchin was empty but the bowl was DEMO for the other, the one with empty bowl had to
help DEMO, else neither of them got any food—this is a similar composition DEMO the UG. Not helping to pull
equals rejection and both stay hungry. In particular, Brosnan and de Waal found that Capuchins would help
pull more often in the cooperation trials if in the previous trial cooperation DEMO achieved. In other words,
experience with the playmate from previous social interactions (e.g. reputation) helped in the decision-
making if a Capuchin DEMO worthy of a helping pull to give her food. The expectation of reciprocity is
strong in non-human primates.
Brosnan and de Waal found the DEMO of acceptance of Capuchins having to give a helping hand to be 39%
(Sarah F. Brosnan, Frans B. M. de Waal 2000), DEMO lower than the acceptance rate of human-sharing
in UG (close to DEMO in the UG). In the same experiment, Brosnan and de DEMO found that Capuchins
share their food in what they called “facilitated taking,” in which when only one Capuchin received food
from the cooperative DEMO, she moved close to the separating fence, let food pieces fall to the floor, and
allowed the other Capuchin to reach over and take it through the fence. This I find similar to the DG, in
6
Vernon Smith has studied market exchanges in his laboratory and suggested that DEMO have
both cooperative and non-cooperative skills and they use them according to the appropriate
occasions (Vernon L. Smith 1998b;Vernon L. Smith 2003). He also suggested that humans use
non-cooperative (self-regarding) methods when dealing DEMO the impersonal markets, while they
use the more cooperative (other-regarding) DEMO when dealing with family, friends, and
neighbors—a somewhat similar statement to the “calculative trust” theory of Oliver Williamson a
few years earlier (Oliver E. Williamson 1993).
Sometimes a self-regarding agent may choose to pretend DEMO be other-regarding in order to
achieve a particular goal (Colin F. DEMO, Ernst Fehr 2006b), which complicates the
deciphering of what experimental DEMO actually really think when they make their decisions.
It is not too difficult to envision that the use of modern technology, such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), may be used to see who is faking and who is not based on
activation of the particular brain DEMO Perhaps “faking” is a cultural norm that all people use in
economic exchanges. If so, one would expect a cultural “standard” of faking and most people
would be found to fake at about the same level2.
DEMO – The Nice Guys
Adam Smith’s statements about emotional decision-making were overlooked for many years. In
neoclassical economic theories human behavior was simplified and DEMO to contractual
interactions between agents that traded goods based on highest probability, lowest cost, and
rigid orderability of preferences. The transition back toward DEMO Smith’s emotional agent
started with Dawkins, Axelrod, and Trivers in the mid to late 70’s.
Richard Dawkins titled Chapter 12 of his book DEMO Guys Finish First,” (Richard Dawkins 1976;
1999 edition) which was his translation of the turn of events brought to light by DEMO Axelrod
in three competitions for a “best” Prisoners Dilemma (PD) game solution in evolutionary
terms—meaning the one that provided the most stable solution (Robert Axelrod, William D.
Hamilton 1981; Robert Axelrod, Douglas Dion 1988). The PD game is simple; two computer
“characters” (paired subjects DEMO) receive two cards: “cooperate” and “defect.” Four
combinations exist: either DEMO cooperate, both defect, or one cooperates and the other defects
with an asymmetrical payoff structure.  Dawkins discusses this game from an evolutionary
perspective and quoted American biologist Garrett Hardin who said “nice guys finish last” DEMO
order to emphasize what may have been called “selfish genery” that is befit to be a member of
the classical economics theories of self-regarding DEMO In Darwinian sense, “a nice guy is an
individual that assists DEMO members of its species, at its own expense, to pass their genes on
to the next generation. Nice guys, then, seem bound DEMO decrease in numbers: niceness dies a
Darwinian death” (Dawkins, page DEMO). The classical economic theory’s self-regarding
maximizing individuals thus suit the Darwinian evolutionary image. But in Axelrod’s competition,
actually the “nice guy” finished DEMO
which DM1 receives all the money (food in the case of DEMO Capuchin) and may decide to share some with
someone in the DEMO (this means giving in DG and allowing to take in Capuchin DEMO). Note,
however, that in the case of the Capuchins, each participating female knew each other whereas the
experiments with humans are DEMO blind, multi-gender, and typically one-shot.
2 Most studies that published their results in the evaluation whether the perception of fairness is enough
report DEMO, indeed, the perceived fairness payment (when the DM2 is uninformed DEMO the true value of the
money DM1 has to split), on average, is below the informed payment and the offer that is perceived to be
fair is accepted. But no study to this date analyzed DEMO everyone fakes fairness when the opportunity
arises or if only some of the people do. See (Colin F. Camerer, Richard H. Thaler 1995;DEMO
Mitzkewitz, Rosemarie Nagel 1993;John H. Kagel et al. 1996;Rachel DEMO A. Croson 1996) for further
details.

Dawkins explains why this “nice guy” could survive evolution (in contrast of the “Darwinian
death”), which conceptualizes what is to have become the DEMO He introduces Grudgers, a
group within a type of bird that DEMO each other in an altruistic way, but refused to help—bore
a DEMO against—individuals that had previously refused to help them. Grudgers came to
dominate the population because they passed on more genes to future generations than DEMO
Suckers (who helped others indiscriminately, and were exploited) or Cheats (who tried to
exploit everybody and ended up bringing each other down)DEMO The story of Grudgers illustrates an
important general principle, which Robert DEMO called ‘reciprocal altruism’ (Dawkins, page
202).
Reciprocal altruism is discussed in economics but has been assumed to only be participant in
kin DEMO; hence it was troubling to think that people acted altruistically in DEMO UG with non-kin.
However, the Grudgers tell us a different story DEMO altruism; they tell us that the Grudgers
ended up dominating the DEMO What this means is that behaving altruistically can change
the population from cheaters and defeaters into cooperators within a few generations. Camerer
et al. (Colin F. Camerer, Ernst Fehr 2006) and Fehr et al. (Ernst Fehr et al. 2000) introduce
concepts that are akin to this population domination by the “nice guys.” These concepts
suggest that individuals with sharing DEMO can turn individuals with non-sharing motive into
sharing types. The tools are the proper identifications and use of “strategic complements” and
“strategic substitutes,” DEMO with one caveat: in Camerer et al., the transformation is strategic
and temporary, whereas in the Grudgers, it becomes genetic and permanent, pending genetic
mutations on the long run.
At this point little can DEMO said about possible methods of changing an entire generation toward
becoming more sharing types, particularly if we use our abilities to put on a new face as the
environment necessitates it. Changing to become other-regarding, in the case of strategic
complementarity, is not only temporary but also “fake.” This should present a serious problem
in our understanding of human behavior DEMO we cannot know for sure when the subjects
play genuine and when opportunistic (strategic) or fake. However, a large share of strong
reciprocators in the population can be part of an evolutionarily stable situation, suggesting that
those who “fake it” might be forced to convert (Robert. Boyd et al. 2003;R. Sethi, E.
Somanathan 2003;Samuel Bowles, Herbert DEMO 2006). Some of the questions I would like to
ask are as follows: What are the modifiable elements that change the behavior of the people?
Does what is prevalent today in our society (as far as experiments can tell) provide an
evolutionary stable system (ESS)? For example, which provides ESS: genuine fairness or
faking fairness or the mixture of the two? What are the underlying biological functions that drive
us toward or away from an ESS? Can we modify these biological functions without destroying
ESS?
Economic decision-making doesn’t happen in a DEMO To see the decision-making
environment, it is helpful to first look DEMO what it takes to program economic decision-making into
computers that mimic human decision-making in a risky environment. When Axelrod set up the
model for DEMO evolution of human cooperation, he listed several requirements for the simulation
DEMO, of which two are described here: (1) specification of an environment in which the PD can
be operated, and (2) specification of the genetics (history), including the way in which
information on the emulated chromosome is translated into a strategy for the simulated
individual (Robert Axelrod 1981). Axelrod wanted to develop a PD game that DEMO based on
survival mechanisms, not unlike that of Dawkins’ theories on DEMO gene (Richard Dawkins 1976).
Axelrod also showed that increasing the DEMO of players increases the difficulty of
maintaining cooperation, and that having DEMO player defect after a number of cooperating
periods, increases the likelihood DEMO the population reaching a certain threshold at which
defection dominates.
The UG and DG
8
The UG was introduced in 1963, (L. E. Fouraker, S. Siegel 1963), and first used as part of an
economic experiment by DEMO et al. to analyze bargaining behavior (Werner Güth et al. 1982)DEMO
Güth and his team described that by game theory, the UG DEMO considered to be a game of one
person on each end where each person is playing a game alone. But this assessment is
incorrect DEMO “all that player i has to do is to make a choice which is good for himself”
(page 368), and the same for player j. However, if player i chooses his best maximizing solution
and passes little or nothing to player j, in the UG player j has veto rights. If j is unsatisfied with
the share of the DEMO, he can reject the deal, thereby cancelling the deal for player i as well; they
both end up empty handed. Thus the two players are playing dependently on one another.
Güth found that players gave DEMO money to stranger than would have been predicted by to
game theory. Even more surprisingly, the receiving players used their veto rights even when
some money was given to them. In one experiment players played both DEMO, the role of the
sender and the receiver. Güth compared the DEMO of what each player maximally offered as
DM1 and what the same player would minimally have accepted as DM2. The inconsistency,
Güth thought, was attributed to the players’ knowledge that they will play both roles. DEMO
to be player1 in one game and player2 in another game might have caused some subjects to
care for a fair bargaining result” (380).
With Axelrod and Güth’s publications showing that something other than monetary DEMO
maximization was driving economic decision-making in the laboratory, many experiments
commenced; some with mistaken concepts that gave confused results and were based on
DEMO theoretical principles. Binmore et al. set out to test this “anomalous” economic
decision-making of the players in one-shot UG. They designed the experiment such DEMO each
person played both DM1 and DM2 roles repeatedly against the same individual (K. Binmore et
al. 1985). What they found was identical to what Güth et al found in 1982 and they warned
about DEMO validity of Güth’s statement against the predictive power of game theory in the one-
shot games. In proof that Güth’s comment was inappropriate, they played what they called one-
shot games, which had two stages. In stage one the players played a standard UG with 100
pence (monetary unit) and divided it in any way. In the second stage, DEMO same two subjects (in
anonymity) were paired but with only 25 pence and DM2 made the first offer. Only the opening
offer of DEMO was recorded and compared with the first stage game. Thus what Binmore et al.,
played were sequentially repeated games with learning effects rather DEMO one-shot games.
Neelin et al., in repeating Binmore’s experiment with three-shot DEMO, found that the results of
the two-shot games did not hold DEMO three-shot games (Janet Neelin et al. 1988).
Some experiments that DEMO to prove that humans make their decisions based on the
expected utility theory’s axioms placed the experiment itself on the basis of the thenceforth
DEMO utility theory, and set out to look for the very thing DEMO assumed. A classic example of
this is Rubistein’s UG experiment in 1982 (Ariel Rubistein 1982). This experiment he called an
“ultimatum-type” game between two players. In the first step, DM1 proposes and if DM2
accepts the game ends with the payout. If DM2 does not accept, he may make an offer and the
game goes on for several rounds, until DM2 accepts. The assumption is that both parties
behave according the DEMO utility theory and that all the axioms are met. Clearly such
bargaining shares little with one-shot games in which cooperation between anonymous
strangers is DEMO object of study. Another critical unrealistic assumption is that all players have
complete information about the preferences of others. The game Rubinstein used was DEMO
sequential centipede game with full knowledge at each nod of the opponent’s step. Thaler
critiqued by writing “when a Recipient declines a positive offer, he signals that his utility function
has non-monetary arguments” (Richard H. Thaler 1988; page 197).
Gneezy et al. had a very similar experiment to Rubistein in1982. They experimented with what
they called a “reverse ultimatum DEMO with a variety of conditions, such as deadlines and the
number DEMO responders participating, in repeated games of 25 (Uri Gneezy et al. 2003). They
hypothesized that the addition of a deadline would shift DEMO sub-game perfect equilibrium
prediction from one extreme to the other in terms of which bargainer is predicted to gain all but
9
a fraction of the available money, which is did, showing that DEMO person with the bargaining
control power takes home more. In their game, if DM2 rejected the offer, DM1 was allowed to
make another DEMO They called the game a “reverse” ultimatum game because it was DM1
doing the bargaining until DM2 accepted. However, similarly to Rubinstein in 1982, Gneezy et
al. also applied a centipede game, but in which DEMO was actual rather than Bayesian; each
player received specific answer rather DEMO a risky social cue. Gneezy et al., found significant
learning effects DEMO the 25 game-periods and that no matter which way the game was set up,
the majority of the proposers still offered “fair” amounts DEMO than the SGPNE.
Hoffman and Spitzer, while testing the Coase Theorem DEMO two- and three-person bargains,
ended up drawing a conclusion for one-shot games, like UG and DG, but the game had
complex rules, and there was this ever-present arbitrator to implement the decision (Elizabeth
Hoffman, Matthew L. Spitzer 1982).  Harrison suggested that the reason why DEMO reject
offers is that the opportunity cost of “misbehavior” in these experiments is small and thus the
anomalies may not be anomalies at all DEMO reflect a “theoretically consistent behavior under
conditions where misbehavior is virtually costless”(Glenn W. Harrison 1992; page 1426).
However, so long as DEMO stakes are small for both gain and loss, if the players DEMO any kind of
behavior costless, then I would think that the DEMO is also true: there cannot be any benefits
to being upset DEMO not receiving enough share of the pie. The showing of “feeling insulted” by
rejecting the offer, however small the offer may be, shows DEMO DM2s receive some non-
monetary utility large enough.
The influence of stake-size has been heavily investigated. Dickinson suggested that bargainers
take advantage of information DEMO (David L. Dickinson 2000). He hypothesized that as
the size DEMO the pie gets arbitrarily large, DM2s will be less likely to DEMO a smaller offer since
the monetary penalty for doing so grows increasingly large. He set up an experiment to test
information asymmetry in action DEMO the kindness theory (kindness theory is a function Rabin
developed that DEMO called “kindness function,” which measures how kind one player is to another
(Matthew Rabin 1993). Dickinson did so by changing the size of the available stash (from $1 to
$15) and by telling DEMO DM1 what DM2 did in the previous round and he played repeated
games for five rounds but with different partners in each round. DM1s DEMO given on “a piece of
paper what [DM2] was offered, what DEMO pie size was, and they were also told whether or not
DEMO accepted or rejected the offer” (David L. Dickinson 2000). Furthermore, he was
comparing if stake-size changed the rejection percentage. He reports his DEMO as having
found statistically significant means but the significance powers are rather mild (p-range 0.08 to
0.43, with one exception, the $7 stash was significantly different at p = 0.02 – page 165).
However, in my view, the DM1’s offer was not a response for the changing size of the pie but
for the history of previous response DEMO DM2, in other words, Dickinson tested the effect of
reputation on UG transactions; he replaced ambiguity with a known probability distribution. Yet
even then, his results were rather mild.
Cameron ran a field experiment in Indonesia in 1994 in which she raised the stakes to
represent substantial DEMO (for example, she offered $100 stake where the per capita gross
domestic product was US$670) and she found that stake size had no effect on the percentage
of money DM1 sent to DM2, or the percent that DM2 rejected; as found Carpenter et al., in their
DEMO where they tested both the UG and the DG (Jeffrey Carpenter DEMO al. 2005; Lisa A.
Cameron 1999). However, Cameron found that in imaginary (hypothetical) games, DM2s were
much more likely to reject than in real games (Lisa A. Cameron 1999).
Eckel and Grossman recruited two groups of players: volunteer subjects in the usual way and
pseudo-volunteer subjects (class-time students), all participating in a DG experiment with a
charity as the recipient (Catherine C. Eckel, Philip J. Grossman DEMO). The experiment was
meant to test for social signal differences between volunteers and pseudo-volunteers in the
typical economic exchange scenario using DG. The DEMO interference was provided by
the subjects being asked if they would be willing to participate “voluntarily” in a game (asked in
class by the authors, who were professors in these classes) – henceforth called the DEMO
10
volunteers,” the charity that was chosen by the authors (professor’s favorite?), and by the
pseudo-volunteers’ knowledge that they have the “option” to donate to the professor’s charity
(Catherine C. Eckel, Philip J. Grossman DEMO). As there is no risk or ambiguity involved in
offering a donation to a charity, no applicable social signal was exchanged, only DEMO
preference, and because the professor’s image was hovering in the pseudo-volunteers’ DEMO
when making their decisions, they showed skewed preference toward “sharing”. Eckel DEMO
Grossman thus found that volunteer subjects (those with no connection to DEMO class, and hence
receiving grade from faculty) were significantly more likely to offer zero to the charity than
pseudo-volunteers; almost 29% of the pseudo-volunteer gave everything to the charity, while
only 5% of the true volunteers did.
Even as late as 2005, we still find misunderstandings about human nature and human behavior
in economic experiments. For example, Bardsley noted that people don’t seem to make
anonymous donations to strangers and decided DEMO set up an experiment to test whether DG
truly measure social preferences or if they measure something else (Nicholas Bardsley 2005).
He hypothesized that if giving money was equivalent to taking money (as it is true in
mathematics), then the game reflected true social preference. He DEMO to measure the
difference between what players would offer to give and what they would take. However, he did
not find any difference because subjects, knowing that in one experiment they will give and in
the other take, did not offer much in the first place in the giving part. Furthermore, in one
version of the game the subjects had to choose between giving some positive amounts (from
£0 - £4) DEMO take £2 from the show-up fee earned by the opposing players—and results suggest
that many did take but not all. In order to get DEMO results, he simulated 10,000 experiments
and using nonparametric techniques, he was able then top reject the null hypothesis at 5%
level. Hence, what Bardsley actually tested was a player taking the endowment from one DEMO
(negative) versus a player giving something from his endowment by choice (positive) to the
other.
However, giving is an altruistic act while taking is a punishing act. Adding and subtracting in
human terms have DEMO different utilities associated with them; one provides reward and
the other DEMO in terms of endowment. Thaler showed that an item of endowed value is
greater than the value of the same item not yet owned (R. Thaler 1980).
My final example of mistaken views is Rustichini’s DEMO, who suggests that
…the task of an economist is to establish DEMO predictions on which human
behavior will follow given certain incentives, preferences, and feasibility constraints.
This set of parameters, that is available to the economist analyzing the situation,
defines the input, and the behavior is the output (Aldo Rustichini 2005; page 203).
Rustichini is missing DEMO most important element in the definition of the input and the output.
Where is the giant processing machine, the brain? Rustichini suggests that DEMO are given by
external conditions (incentives and constraints) and internal ones (preferences) that combined
provide the variables for processing, of which the output becomes the human behavior.  Put
differently, if Rustichini’s comments were DEMO, similarly to any factory machinery or computer
used as processors, so long as the inputs are the same, one would predictably always get the
same output. This suggests that the processor does not add additional DEMO variables, which is
certainly true in the case of computers. However, each person has a very unique processor
sitting atop his or her DEMO and each of these processors provides additional inputs (hormones)
into DEMO model based on a mixture of physiological constraints. In fact, this DEMO precisely what
laboratory experiments with economic games are trying to capture.
The researchers provide the same instructions and the same money to each participant—thus
DEMO controllable external variables are the same. Not only do experimenters want to see the end
result (the outcome) of how much money is DEMO hands, but the behavioral constraints
as well by analyzing blood hormonal DEMO or imaging the brain at the time of decision-making
11
or adding neuropeptides to analyze how modified internal environment of the individual DEMO
how much money is exchanging hands. In the case of humans, DEMO is the behavior and not the
input that modifies the output.  DEMO the brain did not provide input, how would adding
neuropeptides modify DEMO outcome? Yet adding neuropeptides does modify the outcome! See a
great DEMO about nasally administering OT into human subjects and what that does to their
behavior in terms of modifying the output they offer (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005a) and also see
the next chapter in which I use OT to induce a more generous behavior in the UG.
Great DEMO
There have been some truly ingenious experiments as well as there were lots of oppositions to
the games and experimenting techniques. Vernon Smith suggested DEMO “subjects experience
the choices of others and then choose based on what they have learned to accept” (Vernon L.
Smith 1998b; page 110, emphasis added). But not all experiments offer the chance of
experiencing DEMO decisions of others. In particular, experiments that want to learn the DEMO
of hormones do not provide feedback because it would contaminate the results by measuring
reactive emotions rather than the affect of the neuropeptide itself. DEMO argued that the
experimental procedures themselves constitute unintended contaminants. He further suggested
that
Smith makes a good point. As the reader will see in DEMO 3, I describe such possible
contamination by randomizing the order in DEMO the games were played. It is well documented
that some games, DEMO trust game in particular, makes the subjects release OT (Paul J. Zak et
al. 2004). Such OT release can override the effects DEMO other hormones—in this case AVP—
cancelling out the desired effect.
Schotter et al. designed an experiment to test what Smith suggested: mimic a “true” market
under survival pressures and see if agents still defy the theory (Andrew Schotter et al. 1996).
His team introduced property rights in DEMO UG and DG, in which proposers were
competing with each other DEMO offering higher amounts to the same one responder. Whoever
was able to have his offer accepted, entered stage two as “property right owner.” As property
owners, the money they kept for themselves in the second game (second stage) was higher;
“demand behavior changes substantially as we DEMO from the one-stage to the two-stage
experiments” and DM2s rejected less often the smaller amounts offered in the second stage
(Schotter et al., DEMO, page 44).
To address the first-mover-advantage question, Weber et al. set up an experiment to see if first
movers would demand different DEMO amount from when the same players moved second
(Roberto A Weber DEMO al. 2004). They found that minimal acceptable offers (MinAccept) of DM2s
became lower when they knew that they were going to move DEMO, and were higher when
they knew that they were first-movers. They DEMO that the timing result points to an
interpretation on fairness that is incomplete. If only distaste for unfairness drives the response
of DM2, their minimum acceptable offer amount should not change based on the knowledge of
DEMO
…the idea that one should randomize effects that are not controlled comes from
biology, where you randomize treatments among plots of land to prevent
differences in soil quality from being attributed accidentally to the treatments. But
DEMO subjects are not plots of land, and the method of assignment DEMO not have
a neutral effect on behavior… results call into question the interpretation of data
from the large literature in bilateral bargaining that is DEMO by a first-mover,
or other asymmetric advantage, randomly assigned… the DEMO is whether
inducing fair behavior is the appropriate way to frame the test of a bargaining
theory that assumes self-interested agents whose interests conflict, as with
management and labor. Now, if one were to replicate all the asymmetric bargaining
experiments, assigning privileged rights only to those who earned them, and still
observe fair outcomes, then this would call into DEMO the relevance of the
theory” (Vernon L. Smith 1998a; 112-113).
who moves first. Within the fairness framework, the answer they suggest is that a low offer
appears to be fairer when a person is DEMO and moves first than when that same player is DM2
and moves second. But this answer suggests that fairness is based on who has DEMO to
exercise advantage (Weber, page 40).
Kahneman et al. wanted to get a better understanding of how consumers react to the model DEMO
profit-seeking firms by considering the newly discovered preferences that people have for being
treated fairly (Daniel Kahneman et al. 1986). They set up an experiment in which two
individuals played the DG. The dictator was DEMO “fair,” if he offered half of the play-money or
“unfair” if he took more than half. A third individual then had to choose DEMO whom she would
split a certain dollar amount (knowing the history DEMO previous exchanges). Would she split a
larger amount with an unfair player or a smaller amount with a fair player? The majority of the
third players chose to split the smaller amount in order to DEMO with the fair player, albeit at a
cost to themselves.
Aumann DEMO that even though people reject in UG because they are insulted, DEMO
models still consider this insult exogenous (Robert J. Aumann 1986). DEMO recalled Axelrod et
al.’s experiment with the PD game and how it is usually “a crazy type, that wins out – takes over
the game, so to speak… there is only one crazy type, who DEMO plays tit-for-tat, no matter
what the other player does; and it turns out that the rational type must imitate the crazy type, he
must also play tit-for-tat.” Axelrod’s team already had a theory why crazy DEMO win (Robert
Axelrod, William D. Hamilton 1981; Robert Axelrod 1981; Robert Axelrod, Douglas Dion 1988).
But new theories have emerged providing different theories about who these “crazy types” are
and why they win. DEMO and Tyran (Ernst Fehr, Jean-Robert Tyran 2005), and Camerer and
Fehr (Colin F. Camerer, Ernst Fehr 2006) suggested that “strategic complementarity”3 is
participating in these games, which means that it takes only a small number of individuals to
play other-regarding before that may lead to DEMO deviations from aggregate predictions of NE
models, whereas under strategic substitutability4 DEMO opposite is true, a minority of self-
regarding agents may suffice DEMO generate aggregate outcomes consistent with the predictions
of NE game-theoretical models.
The process of why Aumann’s “crazy types win” is detailed by Camerer and DEMO as follows:
what happens if a strong reciprocator faces a self-regarding player and both players know each
other’s preferences? [Note: there is DEMO bit of a problem here with “knowing” the other person’s
preferences but I will let it go at this time for the sake of DEMO a point]. In a simultaneous
game, the existence of the self-regarding DEMO will induce the reciprocator to behave non-
cooperatively as well. If the exchange is structured sequentially, however, with the self-
regarding player starting DEMO, an exchange will take place because the self-regarding player
knows that DEMO reciprocating player will only respond to a reasonable offer (Colin F. DEMO,
Ernst Fehr 2006a; page 47).
Preferences, Beliefs, and DEMO Factors
I would like to return to my note about knowing the preferences of others above in Camerer’s
and Fehr’s explanation. Obviously they placed DEMO framework of the “old” Homo economicus
model as grounds for explaining a phenomenon that otherwise has no known answer (so far) in
this DEMO review—the reader may suggest that telepathy may exists under these
circumstance. Assume for a moment that you, the reader of this article, and DEMO suddenly find
ourselves engaged in playing a game of DG or UG, anonymously. Would I, under any
circumstances, know your preferences without actually knowing you? Would you know mine?
Certainly, I may postulate DEMO given that you are reading my article, you and I share DEMO least
one thing in common: we both know what this article DEMO about; this gives you some shared
history of me. This may DEMO us to form beliefs about one another’s expectation but those are
3 “I do as you do”
4 “if you go right I go DEMO
13
just beliefs (some based on reputation) and not actual knowledge of DEMO In the lab
where experiments are conducted, hundreds of students converge DEMO the same university in
a room to play the games. Obviously they share some beliefs—otherwise they would not be
students in the same institution. DEMO general every university lab experiment is biased by the
homogeneity of the population from which a group of convenience is selected for experiments.
Random DEMO must be ignored and the subjects are not independent because they all
share at least two systemic bias: 1) same university and 2) they all are volunteers, which by
definition distinguishes them from those who don’t volunteer. However, as these errors are
systemic across the board in all experiments, perhaps we all start from a plateau that is
different from a study of true independent observations but since all laboratory experiments
DEMO them, this systemic error can be ignored.
“Cultural traits like values, ambitions, and lifestyles influence economic behavior and thereby
economic conditions [see on this subject (Paul J. Zak, Stephen Knack 2001)]. Economic
conditions DEMO selective pressure on the cultural traits” (Selten, page 90). “Mechanisms of
cultural evolution are shaped by biological evolution and competitive processes involve DEMO
and imitation” (Selten, pages 92, 101). Thus Selten also DEMO the mimicking behavior
necessary for successful societies. Henrich and team found in their experiments in 15 small-
scale societies that there were distinct group-differences DEMO notions of fairness (Joseph Patrick
Henrich et al. 2005). They DEMO found that the level of market integration of a society influences
differences in notions of fairness and punishment. They found that the selfishness axiom
DEMO predicts DM2 behavior in some societies but not university students in lab
experiment. They also found that few or none of the subjects in DEMO small-scale societies
offered zero in DG. They further write that “cultural evolution and its products have undoubtedly
influenced the human genotype… The relationship between DEMO coevolutionary theory
and the preferences, beliefs, and constraints approach is straightforward, although rarely
illuminated” (Henrich et al., page 812).
Fairness in One-Shot Blinded Games?
The question of whether fairness drives the unexpected DEMO behavior in UG was asked by
many. Fairness is defined as sacrificing self-gains “to change the distribution of material
outcomes among others, sometimes rewarding those who act prosocially and punishing those
who do not” (Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2005; page 797). Forsythe et al. tested if the fairness
hypothesis can explain the result of Güth’s experiment (Robert Forsythe et al. 1994b; Robert
Forsythe et al. 1994a). They hypothesized that if the results of the UG and the DG are the
same, fairness is the explanation. However, as they did not find this to be the case, they
concluded that fairness can only be one factor that determines the money offered by DM1 in
UG. Nowak et al. DEMO an evolutionary approach to the UG (M. A. Nowak et al. DEMO).
They suggested that fairness will evolve if DM1 can obtain some information on what deals
DM2 has accepted in the past, similarly to the hypothesis of Dickinson (David L. Dickinson
2000). They believed that the evolution of fairness, similarly to the evolution of cooperation, is
DEMO to reputation and is driven by a mechanism that is similar to genetic evolutionary forces.
Like Dawkins’ Grudgers, future generations of individuals leave their offspring in proportion to
their “total payoff,” which in this case DEMO “success rate,” and each new generation only deals
with those who have been accepted by DM2s in previous encounters. This process can readily
DEMO to the evolution of fairness in repeated games where reputation matters. Why fairness
evolves without explicit reputation, as is the case in one-shot blinded games, remains to be
solved by those experiments that can measure emotional responses more directly, such as the
two experiments that follow this chapter.
The dictator game by its nature removes incentives for strategic behavior. The DEMO is
that if players still act fairly in DGs, they must DEMO a taste for fairness, which was introduced
earlier as sacrificing self-gains DEMO order to change the distribution of material outcomes among
others to benefit those who act prosocially and punish those who do not (Michael P.
Haselhuhn, Barbara A. Mellers 2005). Haselhuhn and Mellers modified the UG and DG such
14
that DM1s are also asked to imagine the pleasure they would feel DEMO each possible payoff—
payments were paid according to the actual games and not based on the imagined possible
payoffs. They were told to rank-order DEMO preferences over all possible offers, and to draw
inferences about the DEMO DM2 might feel. Their statistics show that 25% of DM1s thought
they did not derive pleasure from fairness, 65% some pleasure, and 10% DEMO pleasure
(Michael P. Haselhuhn, Barbara A. Mellers 2005). They also found that preference-orders
differed from pleasure-orders. Most DM1s made fair offers in DEMO UG, but cooperation appeared
to be strategic rather than emotional. However, there were 10% of DM1s who derived greater
pleasure from fair payoffs DEMO from larger payoffs (Michael P. Haselhuhn, Barbara A. Mellers
2005, DEMO 29). In the DG, 55% of dictators derived no pleasure DEMO fairness, and 15% felt
significant pleasure from fairness. Those dictators who DEMO pleasure from fairness, tended
to make fair offers even when they DEMO no strategic reason to do so.
Saad and Gill (Gad Saad, Tripat Gill 2001) and Eckel and Grossman (Catherine C. Eckel, Philip
J. Grossman 1996b) found that in the UG, female allocators were DEMO concerned about
fairness when making offers than males, while males made DEMO generous offers when pitted
against a female than a male. White females made equal offers independently of the sex of the
recipient. They also DEMO an evolutionary explanation for fairness; “male allocators are
altruistic towards female DEMO and competitive with male recipients is construed as a
manifestation of social rules, which evolve from the male predisposition to use resources for
attracting mates” (Saad and Gill, page 171). Takahashi observed that there DEMO a negative
correlation between interpersonal trust and social stress-induced cortisol elevation in DM2s in
UG under stress, indicating that subjects with high levels of interpersonal trust showed reduced
social stress (Taiki Takahashi 2005). “Collectively, DEMO trust might possibly enhance
social cooperation via better social memory due to lowered acute social stress actions during a
face-to-face social interaction, which would result in high levels of an economic growth” (Taiki
Takahashi 2005; DEMO 4).
Environmental Cues: Cultural Heuristics
I have frequently mentioned throughout DEMO essay that players have beliefs rather than actual
updates of the preferences of others. One clever experiment calls attention to cues that hang in
DEMO general environment without even our conscience observation. Blythe et al. set up an
experiment that shows just how such social cues may enter into DEMO without the
players’ knowledge (Philip W. Blythe et al. 1999). DEMO goal was the opposite of what one may
expect; they wanted DEMO see if complex social cues can tell the story about the intentions of the
individuals while playing certain games. The games were played by DEMO on the computer
with imaginary little creatures. On screen two bugs: DEMO blue and the other red. Each player
played 6 types of games: red bug plays with blue bug, red bug courts blue bug, blue bug acts
being courted, blue bug courts red bug and red acts courted, red bug pursues blue bug who is
trying to evade, the same with bug color change, and lastly the two bugs DEMO fighting. In each of
these games, the human volunteer controlling the DEMO bug is given a list of “to do’s” but
otherwise “acts out” the feeling according to his or her best interpretation of what “courting” DEMO
“fighting” means. For example, to court, the bug “owner” volunteer was told to move the bug to
court the other bug by interacting DEMO it in any way that it might find interesting, exciting, or
enticing. The owner of the courted bug was instructed to move the DEMO to show interest or
disinterest, and to elicit further displays in DEMO way desired (page 266).
Since the bugs were computer images, their movements could easily be digitized and recorded
on a time-series model DEMO graph—the bugs themselves were reduced to directionless dots.
Blythe et al. averaged the motion images of the many trials and displayed the aggregate image
DEMO the six motion types. Next they invited new volunteers who were not familiar with the game
and replayed in front of them only the DEMO motion graphs of dots (no bugs were seen).
The job DEMO the volunteers was to identify which type of the six the particular bug-aggregate-
motions they were looking at. The uninitiated were able to predict DEMO motion-intents of the bug
on the screen with about 50% accuracy based on the graphs alone—random guessing is
15
expected to be correct 18% of the time, so 50% is well above randomness. When Blyth’s team
removed one of the two bugs and DEMO, again, to uninitiated players, but this time the bug-
aggregate-motions DEMO only one of the two bugs, the recognition of the motion DEMO reduced to
approximately 30% but still did not disappear.
What this experiment clearly demonstrates is that social cues “in the air” can continuously
reaffirm DEMO modify a person’s belief in the type of environment. In the laboratory, there is plenty
of opportunity for receiving such social cues. One of them, I already mentioned, is that the
volunteers come from the DEMO institution. Another is that as they come for the experiments,
they line up to provide their student identifications; sometimes the line is long and there is
ample opportunity to look and feel who is in DEMO crowd. Although once the UG or DG starts in
the lab, DEMO volunteers do not specifically know whom they play with, they certainly DEMO the
“average makeup” of the people in the room. They can, DEMO, estimate if they are in an
environment where acting according to DEMO rules of strategic complementarity or strategic
substitutability would offer the highest payoff.
Reciprocity can be based on experience from the past by having repeated DEMO but they
can “also be based on the knowledge that the members of the interacting group are ‘alike’”
(Ernst Fehr, Bettina Rockenbach 2004)DEMO In an experiment by Gachter and Thoni, subjects were
ranked with DEMO to their contribution in a one-shot PG game and then sorted into groups of
individuals with similar ranks (S. Gachter, C. Thoni 2005)DEMO Cooperation in the “alike” groups of
like-minded people was found to be significantly higher than in random group composition—
supporting significantly that lab environment, which is made up of individuals that are members
of an “alike” DEMO, might provide economic choices that reflect the norms of that “in-group.”
DEMO and Machs
Hoffman et al. conducted several interesting experiments testing fairness with a variety of
framing approaches. In their 1996 experiment, using DG, DEMO tested the theory that framing
might have a lot to do with the appearance of fairness in the game (Elizabeth Hoffman et al.
1996). In most cases at that time, the experiments were conducted under observation, rather
than blindly from everyone, including the experimenters. They conducted DEMO experiment
double-blind and requested that the dictators place their offer to the recipient into an envelope,
place the envelope in a box, from which the experimenters took them, counted the money and
passed them on to the recipients. They found that “there was a pronounced tendency for DEMO
leaving no money to seal their envelope, and for those leaving DEMO amounts of money to
not seal their envelopes.” They concluded that other-regarding behavior varies with context
based on opportunity costs (Elizabeth Hoffman et al. 1996). With respect to framing, they
suggested that subjects bring their ongoing experience of the world with them into the
laboratory, and the instructional language used can associate a subject’s decision with past
experience. For DEMO, “suggesting that the task is to ‘divide’ the $10 may imply DEMO the
objective is to share the money with someone, who, though anonymous, is socially relatively
near to the decision-maker” (Hoffman, 1996, DEMO 655). Bolton et al. agrees with Hoffman et
al., suggesting DEMO in comparing their data with that of previous studies, they also DEMO
differences in the results of the games based on the differences in written directions (Gary E.
Bolton et al. 1998; Elizabeth Hoffman et DEMO 1999).
Carpenter et al., had players fill out a personality DEMO called the Mach scale (first developed in
(R. Christie, F. DEMO 1970)), which consists of 20 statements drawn from Machiavelli’s The
DEMO (Machs) to which subjects agree or disagree (Jeffrey Carpenter et DEMO 2005). Those who
tend to agree with the statements are the high Machs and the others the low Machs. They
included the Mach DEMO to control for “variations in predispositions toward engaging in
manipulative behaviors.” In previous work. H.-D. Meyer (1992) found evidence suggesting that
high Machs DEMO low offers and reciprocate less (A. Gunnthorsdottir et al. 2002). DEMO et al.
found that high Machs were also less trusting, sending DEMO and rejecting higher amounts (S.
Burks et al. 2003). McCabe DEMO al., however found that Christie and Geis's Machiavellianism
16
scale (Mach-IV) is not a good predictive tool to measure the DEMO of subjects in the trust game
(Kevin McCabe et al. 2002)DEMO
As there is substantial debate over why humans use costly punishment, DEMO and Houser
tested experimentally if constraints on emotion expression would increase, DEMO, or keep
the same, the use of costly punishment (Erte DEMO, Daniel Houser 2005). They found that
rejection of unfair offers DEMO significantly less frequent when DM2s could convey their feelings
to DM1s concurrently with their decisions. Their data supports the view that punishment might
be DEMO to express the negative emotions players feel when they are treated unfairly.
fMRI
Sanfey et al. noted that the magnitude of activation in the DEMO anterior insula, dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (using fMRI) were significantly
greater for unfair offers from DEMO partners then from computer partners (A. G. Sanfey et al.
2003)DEMO They also found the magnitude of activation to be significantly greater in both sides of
the insula for unfair offers from human partners than DEMO both unfair offers from computer
partners and low control offers. The insula is associated with the feeling of negative emotions.
For example, Singer et al., found in an fMRI experiment that the insula is associated with the
feeling of pain of a loved one (Tania Singer et al. 2004) and Wager et al., found that the insula
is also DEMO to partake in placebo-effects of suggestions of investigation (Tor D. Wager DEMO al.
2004). They suggest that these activations were not solely a function of the amount of money
offered but rather they were sensitive DEMO the context, the perceived unfair treatment from
another human. Regions of DEMO anterior insula demonstrated sensitivity to the degree of
unfairness of an offer, exhibiting significantly greater activation for a $9:$1 offer than an $8:$2
offer from a human partner” (A. G. Sanfey et al. 2003; page 1756).
Sanfey et al.’s findings are in conflict with the results of Rilling et al., (James K. Rilling et al.
2004) who used fMRI for experimenting with UG and PD games, using human and computer
partners. In Rilling’s team’s experiments of UG, the scanned participants were always in the
role of DM2. Unfair offers by humans were DEMO at a significantly higher rate than the same
offers by computers, DEMO was also found by Sanfey et al. in 2003 (A. G. DEMO et al. 2003).
However, Rilling et al. found that while DEMO the with computer partners, they got different
results for playing UG DEMO prisoner’s dilemma (PD). While playing the UG, computer partners did
not activate the same regions in the brain as did playing with DEMO people. In other words, the
scanned participants’ brain actively distinguished between DEMO with a computer or a person.
Each participant in the scanner knew the identity of the other player, even when the other
player was a computer—there was no deception. In spite of knowing that the scanned DEMO
was playing against a computer, when playing the PD game, playing with computer partners
elicited the same brain activation in the scanned DM2 DEMO when playing with a real human
partner.
Put differently, in PD DEMO, the brain is not able to distinguish between playing against a
DEMO or a person, even when all facts are clearly stated to DEMO scanned participant. Several
areas, including right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right DEMO lobe were activated in both
cases. Event-related plots for both of these regions of interests (ROIs) reveal an increase in
activation in response DEMO the partner’s face (could be computer “face” in case of a DEMO
partner) that remain elevated until the game outcome is revealed, at which time there is a
secondary increase—in other words, when image is seen, there is an expectation until the offer
is revealed. Rilling et al. found that there was a notable discrepancy between the UG and DEMO
PD games in the ability of computer partners to elicit activation in areas also activated by
human partners. They suggest that this difference may DEMO to the varying “responsiveness” of
the two computer strategies. In the UG game, the computer did not respond to participant
choices; it simply DEMO the participant an offer. But in the PD game, the computer DEMO
to a choice by the participant and gave the impression that the computer’s decision was
contingent on the human participant’s choice. Mutual cooperation and DEMO punishment of
17
defectors activate reward related neural circuits, suggesting that evolution has endowed
humans with mechanisms to render altruistic behavior psychologically and physiologically
rewarding (Ernst Fehr, Bettina Rockenbach 2004).
The results of recent years’ experiences provide support for the hypothesis that neural
representations of emotional states guide human decision-making. DEMO found that the
anterior insula scales monotonically to the degree of unfairness felt by the participant, reflecting
the emotional response to the offer (DEMO G. Sanfey et al. 2003). Unfair offers were also
associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. Areas of anterior insula—
maybe DEMO the emotional reaction to unfairness— and the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC)DEMO representing the cognitive part for earning money—represent areas
for decision-making in UG. Other recent neuroeconomics studies that scan subjects’ brains
while they are making DEMO in interactive economic experiments also provide interesting
results on the neural foundations of reciprocity (K. McCabe et al. 2001; J. K. Rilling et DEMO 2002;
R. Adolphs 2003; A. G. Sanfey et al. 2003; D. J-F. DeQuervain et al. 2004). These studies
support the hypothesis DEMO neural representations of emotional states guide human decision-
making and that subjects derive specific rewards from mutual cooperation and the punishment
of norm violators.
DEMO effects form expectation and adaptation in brain cells. For example, drug DEMO is
a form of learning effect, called “incentive learning,” where DEMO the neurons’ expectation of the
upcoming drug is not met, withdrawal DEMO During “withdrawal, rats with previous experience
of heroin in withdrawal initiated DEMO with a shorter latency, and showed more
completed cycles of drug-seeking DEMO to either saline controls or control groups without
experience” (D. M. DEMO et al. 2001; page 944). Thus learning-effects modify behavior
and DEMO many lab experiments with humans, such learning effects may be substantial DEMO has
been difficult to capture.
It is clearly evident from this review that we have come a long way from the self-regarding and
measurably DEMO Homo economicus models and are making strong advances in
the understanding of economic exchange from a behavioral and physiological perspective. The
reader most certainly DEMO noticed how two games, the UG and the DG, originally used to
measure the accuracy of game-theoretic predictions, have metamorphosed into a means to
explain evolutionary forces, hormonal stress responses, sexually dimorphic emotions, and now
the neural representations of emotional states!

Chapter Two
OT Enhances Generosity in the UG
Human beings routinely help DEMO even when the helper receives no benefit and the person
helped is a stranger. Altruistic behavior toward non-kin, exerting costly effort to benefit a
stranger, is often found in laboratory economic experiments. Frequently the help offered to
strangers in these games is sending an offer that is generously DEMO a fair one. Why are
people generous? Is there a benefit DEMO acting generously toward strangers? Oxytocin may
enhance prosocial emotions and reduces DEMO, allowing cooperation with strangers. Would
enhanced prosocial emotions lead to enhanced DEMO behaviors, like amplified
generosity? If yes, generosity might be an DEMO means to cooperation with non-kin. I
hypothesized that subjects on OT would become more generous than those on placebo in the
UG. The result DEMO that indeed, OT significantly enhances generosity.
Introduction
Among humans, cooperative behaviors like forming relationships with strangers and
maintaining social bonds increase the likelihood DEMO survival and provide opportunities for
successful reproduction. The results of laboratory experiments using economic games show
that cooperation is a primary and integral part DEMO human economic exchanges. Humans often
cooperate and act in a prosocial manner even at a detriment to their personal gain. It is widely
accepted DEMO human social bonds are characterized by acts of altruism (Stephanie L. DEMO,
R. Michael Brown 2005; Herbert Gintis et al. 2003; Herbert Gintis 2002). Altruism is the offering
of a benefit to another DEMO a cost to the altruist (Herbert A. Simon 1990; Robert L. Trivers 1971).
What might motivate a person to act altruistically toward DEMO stranger in an anonymous one-shot
game?  Individuals form and maintain social bonds using sympathy and empathy and provide
benefits to others through helping DEMO generosity (Stephanie D. Preston, Frans B. M. de Waal
2002b; DEMO Patrick Henrich et al. 2005; Adam Smith 1892).
Empathy provides DEMO feeling or the imagination of how another person feels in response to a
particular event and it helps in the understanding and predictions of DEMO thoughts and
intentions; it is a robust process that underpins prosocial DEMO well as antisocial behavior
(Cameron Anderson, Dacher Keltner 2002; George DEMO, Nick Haslam 2002). The emotional
basis of altruism may lie DEMO our possessing of prosocial emotions, including empathy, shame,
and guilt (Herbert Gintis 2002).  A study (with non-human apes) linked DEMO to prosocial
behaviors to help form attachment between conspecifics, which leads DEMO generosity and
altruism in apes (Stephanie D. Preston, Frans B. M. de Waal 2002b). Generosity is considered
to be part of a DEMO of prosocial emotions, such as altruism, reciprocity, kindness, fairness, DEMO
doing something good (Michael Lewis 2002; Margery Lucas, Laura Wagner DEMO; Catherine C.
Eckel, Philip J. Grossman 1998; Gary E. Bolton DEMO al. 1998; Frank Fincham, Julian Barling
1978).
Economics and game theory are based on the assumption that people can predict the actions
DEMO others’; backward induction, iterated elimination of dominated strategies, and the DEMO
Equilibrium (NE) require a system of beliefs about the decisions of others. These concepts are
based on people understanding others’ motives and beliefs (Tania Singer, Ernst Fehr 2005).
The UG is a strategic economic game in which half of the players are endowed with some
money (DM1) and the other half (DM2) is dependent upon an acceptable offer from DM1 for
any money earned. DM2’s rejection of an offer DEMO no gain for either of them while in
acceptance both take home as much as they agreed to. Consider the situation of a DM1. DEMO is
endowed with $10 and is to offer some of that to an anonymous DM2 such that DM2 will
accept. The sub-game perfect NE (SGPNE) is that DM1 keeps $9 and DM2 gets $1, and DEMO
accepts that offer. Robust experimental results in the past twenty years show that DM1s are
19
much more generous and typically offer $3 or more to DM2 and DEMO typically rejects offers if
$2 or less (Werner Güth et al. DEMO; Daniel Kahneman et al. 1986; Joseph Patrick Henrich et
al. 2005; Colin F. Camerer, Richard H. Thaler 1995).
Why is $3 DEMO accepted norm? Is generosity governed by expectations of fairness on the DEMO of
DM2 and DM1 knows that? Some suggest that fairness begets DEMO payoff, while others
suggest that fairness is a motivation in itself DEMO it is the reciprocation for help or hurt (Gary E.
Bolton, Axel Ockenfels 2005; Frans van Winden 2007a; Ernst Fehr, Urs Fischbacher 2002). Or
is generosity governed by societal rules that are enforced DEMO DM2s’ punishments of
unacceptably low offers? Some suggest that DM2’s punishment DEMO DM1 is altruistic punishment
(Ernst Fehr, Simon Gachter 2002; Joseph DEMO Henrich et al. 2006), while others suggest
that it is a self-regarding due to spite and anger (G. Gigerenzer, T. Gigerenzer 2005; Frans van
Winden 2007b; Herbert Gintis 2002).
The neural mechanism of generosity is not well understood. Functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) shows DEMO when a person punishes another for lack of appropriate prosocial
behavior the punishment itself is a reward in the altruist’s dopamine pathway (D. J-F.
DeQuervain et al. 2004). OT is present in the human brain DEMO maybe associated with
prosocial behaviors. It plays a central role in regulating positive social interactions, such as
attachment and bonding and affects both social behavior and the mechanisms underlying
social behavior (Karen L. Bales, C. DEMO Carter 2002; R. Landgraf, I. D. Neumann 2004; D.
Huber DEMO al. 2005; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Paul J. Zak, Ahlam Fakhar DEMO; Paul J. Zak et
al. 2005b; Paul J. Zak et al. 2004; C. Sue Carter 1998; Kristin M. Kramer et al. 2005; Alison B.
Wismer Fries et al. 2005; James P. Curley, Eric DEMO Keverne 2005; Eric B. Keverne, James P.
Curley 2004).
OT also affects social memory (Elena Choleris et al. 2003). In animals it can be released by
sensory stimuli perceived as positive, including touch, warmth, and odors and also as the
consequence of positive social DEMO; it does so by inducing anti-stress-like effects such
as reduction of DEMO pressure and cortisol, increases pain thresholds, and exerts anxiety
reduction effects (Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Maria Peterson 2005; R.
J. DEMO et al. 1997; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Eva Björkstrand 1998; T. Onaka DEMO). OT has
shown to reduce anxiety in humans by reducing amygdala activation, an area that has been
implicated in the manifestation of fear (Peter Kirsch et al. 2005). OT receptors are concentrated
in areas of the brain associated with emotions, such as the amygdala and the hypothalamus
(Thomas R. Insel 1997; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, DEMO Peterson
2005; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg et al. 2005).
Humans with dysfunctional DEMO processing, like some autistic people, may be socially withdrawn
(Brigit DEMO Völlm et al. 2006). OT has been shown to enhance trust toward strangers (Michael
Kosfeld et al. 2005b), and trust stimuli have shown to increase OT levels in humans (Paul J.
Zak et al. 2005b; Paul J. Zak et al. 2004). OT seems to permit humans to overcome their
anxiety of dealing with strangers in social context (Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg 1998; Kerstin Uvnäs-
Moberg, Maria Peterson 2005; Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg et al. 2005; M. Heinrichs et al. 2003).
Research shows that OT crosses the blood-brain barrier after intranasal administration (Jan
Born et al. 2002), providing a simple method for studying its effect on humans DEMO a one-shot
economic exchange with strangers in lab environment. For a comprehensive overview of
clinical research findings on OT on humans and animals, see Bartz and Hollander, 2006
(Jennifer A. Bartz, Eric Hollander 2006) DEMO Lim and Young, 2006 (Miranda M. Lim et al. 2005;
Miranda M. Lim, Larry J. Young 2006).
OT is known to enhance attachment. It is natural to ask if attachment and generosity are
DEMO in such a way that enhancing one would enhance the other. Would increased OT
lead to enhanced generosity? In this paper I define an offer as generous if it provides more
benefit than the average (Myrna Beth Shure 1968; Joseph Patrick Henrich et al. 2005;
20
Catherine C. Eckel, Philip J. Grossman 1996a). In particular, if DEMO offer in the UG is above the
average offer of the entire subject population, that offer is generous.
Empathy renders our emotions other-regarding, DEMO the motivational basis for other-
regarding behavior (Tania Singer, Ernst Fehr 2005). Offering generous help is a component of
empathy (Cameron Anderson, Dacher Keltner 2002; Michael Lewis 2002; Stephanie D.
Preston, Frans DEMO M. de Waal 2002a). My hypothesis is that in the UG subjects will have
increased generosity in the OT treatment compared with the DEMO group.
As DM1’s decision in the UG requires some form of social attachment and empathy toward
DM2 in order to judge correctly what amount DEMO will accept, I propose that OT will affect the
amount of DEMO sent in the UG. By contrast, if the decision is purely DEMO, OT will not
make any difference. Similarly, since OT is hypothesized to only affect other-regarding
preferences, I propose that the rejection amount (DEMO) will not be influenced by OT. As
control, I used a DG, which is a one-sided game where DM1s are endowed with a sum of
money, $10, and are told that they may send DEMO part of that to an anonymous stranger who
has no say in the matter but must accept whatever handout is given. Thus this game DEMO no
strategy and no cooperation required. Any money offered by DM1 to a stranger is considered to
be purely altruistic (Herbert Gintis 2000; DEMO Patrick Henrich et al. 2005).  Because this
altruism is not DEMO, i.e. the DG is not cooperative and appears to be dissociated DEMO
response, I hypothesize that OT will not make a difference in DEMO amount of money sent by
DM1 in the DG.
Materials and Methods
This experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of UCLA and DEMO
Graduate University. There was no deception in any part of this experiment. We recruited only
male subjects because of the possible unintended miscarriage in DEMO is used to
induce labor. 83 male students responded to an email advertisement-invitation to participate in
an experiment and to earn some money. The DEMO arrived to UCLA California Social
Science Experimental Laboratory (CASSEL) either in the morning at 9:30 am or in the
afternoon for the DEMO session at 1 pm and were given a short medical screening for possible
dangerous interactions with oxytocin. All subjects were admitted and seated in DEMO cubicle with
two computers. Each subject was either provided 40 IU of oxytocin (Jan Born et al. 2002;
Osama Salha, James J. DEMO 1999; Mary B. Munn et al. 2001) or normal saline by nasal
inhaler. This was a double-blind study and neither the subjects nor DEMO investigators had the
information about which substance the subject received. Because oxytocin had to be kept
refrigerated, the saline was too so the investigator was blind to which substance was
administered based on temperature. The length DEMO time spent with each subject for the
administration of oxytocin or saline was about one minute. The drug administration went
without any problems, no subject required medical treatment, no adverse side effects, and no
after-treatment DEMO was requested.
The time required for oxytocin to reach behaviorally relevant increased levels is approximately
45 to 60 minutes (Jan Born et al. 2002). In this period, the subjects were asked to fill out two
surveys on the computer, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes. The surveys were used to
test for consistency in answers and to collect demographic information DEMO to influence
decision-making (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b; Paul J. Zak et al. 2004). The subjects were told
that they could surf DEMO Net, respond to email but they were asked to not make DEMO phone calls
or talk to anyone in the laboratory. 60 minutes after oxytocin application, each subject played a
one-shot ultimatum game and dictator game. Because of computer problems, the first group in
the experiment—13 subjects—was not able to play the games and their data was removed.
One subject DEMO not follow instructions and was dismissed after $5 payment was given to him
as show-up fee. One additional subject was removed in the process DEMO the data analysis as his
data appeared to be outlier compared with research results of others in the US (Colin Camerer
21
2003). 68 subjects remained in the analysis of this experiment. The DEMO age of the
participating students was 21.75.
The computer version of the one-shot ultimatum and dictator games takes a couple of minutes
to play. DEMO completion of all of these tasks, each subject individually left the DEMO lab to
collect his winnings in privacy in cash, $30 on DEMO, from the lab administrator. Upon leaving
with the payout, each subject was also handed a precautionary leaflet that provided information
about the possible DEMO effects of oxytocin and offered phone numbers and contact names in
case of an emergency for the following 24 hours.
Each subject received self-paced DEMO and a quiz to make sure they understood the
games; not DEMO the quiz means elimination from the experiment.  In this experiment, each
subject played both as DM1 and as DM2 sequentially and without any DEMO of what
choices their partners made. The computer program asked how much money they wanted to
send to their computer-matched partner in the ultimatum DEMO, what their rejection level
(MinAccept) was for the ultimatum game, and how much money they wanted to send in the
dictator game.
DEMO
I found support for all three hypotheses. Similarly to experimental results of UG and DG by
others, I found that our variables were not normally distributed. Although nonparametric
statistics was the primary analysis method, parametric statistics was used to confirm the
results. If the findings are robust in DEMO statistics, parametric tests should provide the
same results. The amount of DEMO sent in the UG was significantly higher in the OT treatment
(DEMO) than in the placebo treatment group ($4.03) (Mann-Whitney U test (M-W-U) two-tailed p
= 0.005) but there was no difference between the amount offered in the DG ($3.77 OT and
$3.58 placebo) (M-W-U two-tailed p = 0.506) and in the rejection amount of MinAccept ($3.03
OT and $2.91 placebo) (M-W-U two-tailed p = 0.782).

Figure 2.2 Average amount of money sent in the DG with standard DEMO bars. The placebo

Figure 2.3 Average amount of money stated DEMO MinAccept in the UG with standard error bars.
In general, only DEMO (2 subjects, both in the placebo group) offered the SGPNE DEMO $1 in the UG
and 18% (12 subjects) offered the NE of $0 in the DG with a near equal mix between treatment
DEMO 4% (3 subjects, 2 from the OT group) accepted $0, which is smaller the SGPNE of $1;
27% (18 subjects, DEMO from OT group) accepted $1. Overall 40% of the subjects would DEMO
less than 30% of the pot. Most previous lab experiments show that most DM2s typically reject
an offer that is less than 30%—for a DEMO review see (Colin Camerer 2003; pages 50-58),
hence the DEMO sample drawn from the University of California, Los Angeles, student
body is systemically accepting lower offers than the average.
The expected likelihood that DEMO offer will be accepted was nearly identical in the two treatment
groups and was 73%. The range of MinAccept was between $0 and $6; the average, including
both treatment groups, was $2.97. I looked at DEMO average amount of money sent by subjects in
the OT and the placebo treatments and subtracted from this the average accepted amount to
see DEMO group sent a more generous amount than the MinAccept required.

highly significant (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.005). DEMO, subjects in the OT group took
less money home in the DEMO than the placebo. Once rejections of offers are included, the mean
DEMO for subjects in the OT group was $5.06 and for the placebo $5.70 and the difference
is significant (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.009).

Thus DEMO in the OT group took home less as a result of their generosity.
Discussion
When to the interest of this other person, therefore, DEMO sacrifice their own, they
accommodate themselves to the sentiments of the DEMO, and by an effort of
magnanimity act according to those views DEMO things which, they feel, must naturally
occur to any third person.
Adam Smith “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” (1790).
I have shown that OT increased generosity in the UG. Although the central tendency analysis
DEMO the amount of money sent in the DG did not show any significant differences between the
treatment groups, I noticed other significant differences between the OT and placebo treatment
groups in the DG. OT affected the DEMO decision differently from how it affected the UG.

$ Sent over MinAccept
Figure 2.6 Percent of subjects sending $5 in the DG by treatment DEMO
While in the UG the amount of money sent increased (shifted DEMO the right of the mean of the
amount of money sent) DEMO made DM1s more generous, in the DG the number of subjects
DEMO certain amount increased (shifted to the right of the mean of DEMO of subjects)
particularly in the $5 group—see figure 2.6.
The difference between the two treatment groups is not captured by statistical tests, even
though the percentage variation in the $5 groups is large. The percent DEMO subjects who sent $5
is 67% larger than the percent in the placebo group. Thus with respect to the number of
subjects offering a DEMO amount, or more specifically the most frequently sent amount of $5,DEMO
OT affected both DG and UG, although in the DG the DEMO of money offered per se is not
increased. This finding, though DEMO insignificant, should not be dismissed as noise
without further study in DEMO experiment. The counter-intuition behind having OT influence
the DG is that OT is known to influence attachment and bonding, which suggests that
exchanges where reciprocity is not considered should not be influenced. Finding that OT
influences DEMO people to offer a fair split indicates that either OT influences prosocial
considerations that are void of reciprocal expectation, or that prosocial elements in the UG and
the DG are not easily separated by subjects when DEMO OT-level is increased. Perhaps, as a
key function of OT is DEMO remove the fear of strangers and allow cooperation between non-kin,
OT enhances cooperation when otherwise it is not necessary.
We can see in DEMO 2.7 below that the percent of subjects sending larger sums of money in
the DG is more in the OT treatment group than in DEMO placebo and that the trend of more
subjects offering less is magnified in the placebo group. 54% more subjects joined the “send
less” effort DEMO the placebo group.

DG in the two treatment groups.
It is interesting to find that OT had no affect on DEMO On the one hand, this signals that
subjects are not cognitively DEMO by the affect of OT because there is no difference in
rejection rates between OT and placebo. On the other hand, this finding provides some
answers to the debate of the two schools of thoughts about DEMO drives the rejection of positive
money amounts in the UG. One school suggests that it is an altruistic norm-enforcement (other-
regarding) by which DEMO DM2 enforces what is considered to be fair to receive; thus DEMO would
expect that OT influences this decision. The other school of thought is that rejection of positive
money amounts by DM2 is self-regarding driven DEMO anger and spite. If MinAccept was set
based on a personal preference of what is fair to the particular DM2, we would not have
expected OT to influence that decision, as the MinAccept decision then is not other-regarding.
As OT did not affect the rejection amount of DM2s DEMO any direction, there might be some
culturally accepted amount that subjects DEMO if fair. However, this finding did not conclusively
decide if the DEMO MinAccept was set based on a personal preference or a culturally set
norm, only suggests that OT did not influence that decision. We thus leave the decisive
resolution of this debate for a future study aimed DEMO at finding whether rejection is
other-regarding or self-regarding.
Our subject filled out surveys with a variety of demographic questions as well as questions
referring DEMO how trusting they felt toward strangers, how attached they felt to DEMO past and
current romantic partners, if they trusted their romantic partners DEMO to share their feelings,
and how they resolved their anger. The answers to any of the survey questions should not have
been influenced DEMO OT since the surveys were filled in earlier than optimal upload.
Nonetheless, some effects were visible in subject behavior about 10 minutes after OT
administration. For example, there was a yawn-and-stretch that moved through the subjects in
waves the appropriate order in which they received treatment. As we DEMO blind whether
subjects received OT or placebo, the yawns and stretches DEMO well have been coincidental,
except that they happened in every experiment at about the same time. This suggests that OT
might have some DEMO shortly after administration, albeit not full effect, and some of the survey
questions might show a pattern of OT influence.
26
Several questions on the survey asked about trust toward strangers. Three of DEMO questions
followed one another and consistent response required either and a-b-a (DEMO strangers) or
b-a-b response (not trusting strangers); response in any other combination indicated
inconsistency. The three trust-questions were as follows: (1) Most of the time, people (a) try to
be helpful; (b) are mostly just looking out for themselves; (2) Most DEMO would try to (a) take
advantage of you if they got a chance; (b) be fair; (3) Generally speaking (a) most people can
be trusted; (b) you can’t be too DEMO in dealing with people.
In general, 39 subjects were consistent and DEMO inconsistent in their answers for these three
survey questions. It is important to note that inconsistency in these questions did not affect the
subjects’ DEMO analysis results in the games (Mann-Whitney U-test on dummies set to DEMO
the significance of consistence and inconsistence in the amount of money DM1 sent in the UG
game p = 0.94, in the DG: DEMO = 0.703, and MinAccept: p = 0.106, all 2-tailed). DEMO those subjects
who chose consistently, 24 were in the OT and DEMO in the placebo group, suggesting that OT did
not sedate our DEMO figure 2.8 for details.
Figure 2.8 The influence of OT on subject consistency. Subjects are more consistent (right side
of image) in the DEMO (dark bars) treatment group than in the placebo.
The difference between the two treatment groups with respect to consistency is not significant
(Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.131), thus OT did not influence subject consistency.
DEMO
Figure 2.9 Consistency in percentages.
Of the consistent answers 15 subjects answered DEMO and 25 “distrusting”. 13 out of the 15
trusting subjects were in the OT group and only 2 in the placebo treatment group; the difference
between treatment groups is significant (Mann-Whitney U-test Exact p = 0.027 2-tailed)-see
figure 2.10 below.
Figure 2.10 Significantly more subjects felt trust DEMO strangers in the OT (dark) treatment
group (right 2 bars) than in the placebo (light). In the placebo treatment group more subjects
felt distrust (left 2 bars) toward strangers.
OT appears to DEMO significantly affected how subjects felt toward strangers, with an increase
in DEMO toward strangers. Survey questions about kin-relation (romantic partner attachment)
were DEMO on the 1-7 Likert scale. Questions about attachment sometimes were about trust
toward romantic partners (past and present partners) and other times more DEMO how anxious
the person felt about commitment to be attached or fear of the partner’s commitment to be
attached. As OT is a neurobiological DEMO for attachment, one might expect that OT would
enhance the feeling DEMO attachment and trust toward strangers but what about toward kin? OT
DEMO not affect the feelings of attachment and trust toward kin (Mann-Whitney DEMO p = 0.798)
but it moderately affected trust toward strangers (DEMO U-test p = 0.066 2-tailed).
28
Furthermore, I found by correlations that trust toward strangers is significantly associated with
OT (41% Pearson, sig. 0.0005), while kin’s association with DEMO is next to nothing (Pearson 3%
sig. 0.80).
To see DEMO other factors participated in the enhanced generosity, we analyzed the demographics
DEMO for their influence on generosity given the OT treatment. We found no significance of
any other variables. For example, age did not affect the generosity of subjects (Mann-Whitney
U-test p = 0.929) or stinginess (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.338). We also know that OT neither
makes DEMO more risk-takers nor more risk-averse (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b). DEMO the
only factor (of those factors we measured) affecting subject generosity appears to be oxytocin
itself.
This finding suggests that as OT is DEMO in our dealing with strangers. It further suggests
that as trust and attachment within kin is well established, there might similar mechanisms that
permit us to trust and be generous toward strangers. Oxytocin appears to be DEMO evolutionary
hormone that makes subjects more trusting and generous in order to enhance cooperative and
positive social interactions with strangers. Generosity can initiate gift-giving DEMO therefore a
virtuous circle of reciprocity. Generosity is a primary long-term mating strategy (David M. Buss
1995). As I showed that generosity can be enhanced by varying the level of OT, and that OT
naturally varies in level throughout our daily lives, it is expected that generosity is enhanced
naturally by our changing levels of OT when the appropriate DEMO is provided by our external
environments.

Chapter Three
Vasopressin and Punishment
Introduction
In a variety of economic experiments DEMO has been shown that humans make their decisions not
based purely on monetary incentives. Experiments show that subjects send more money in
one-shot blinded DEMO than expected by game theoretic models but no explanations have so
far been forthcoming for “why” people make their decisions this way. Some theories DEMO these
behaviors into a variety of categories, such as self-regarding or DEMO notions, pro-
social behaviors or altruism (G. Gigerenzer, T. Gigerenzer DEMO; Frans van Winden 2007a;
Herbert Gintis 2002; Ernst Fehr, DEMO Gachter 2002; Joseph Patrick Henrich 2006), but none
explains why DEMO person would choose to be pro-social, altruistic, or other-regarding with a
stranger in one-shot blinded games. In games that continue with the same DEMO for some
time or in games where the participants learn about one-another by direct contact or by
reputation, reciprocity may build up relations where offering more in economic laboratory
experiments is expected. But in games where DEMO are blinded from one-another and only a
single game is played, DEMO and reputation cannot explain other-regarding and altruistic
behaviors.
In this paper, DEMO show that by enhancing the influence of certain emotions by the use of ancient
evolutionary hormones, it is possible to initiate particular behaviors in humans, thereby
providing answers to the “why” for pro-social and other-regarding behaviors in these one-shot
blinded games. Based on animal and a few human DEMO, we know that arginine vasopressin
(AVP), an evolutionary hormone, DEMO a significant role in some behaviors associated with kin
protection; AVP DEMO shown to influence the behavior of small mammals by making them more
reactively aggressive (J. M. Koolhaas et al. 1990; Craig F. Ferris DEMO al. 2006); AVP is necessary
for social memory (Jennifer N. DEMO et al. 2002), and has also shown to be involved in
human depression and aggression (G. Scantamburlo et al. 2005; Zul Merali DEMO al. 2006;
Sergueï O. Fetissov et al. 2006). Can the administration of AVP influence subjects to punish
those who violate a social DEMO in one-shot blinded economic games?
Animal studies are more frequent than human AVP studies, though not as extensive as studies
of oxytocin (DEMO) are in mammals. In a study by Ruscio et al., 2007, the prairie vole (Microtus
ochrogaster) was studied growing up in a variety of housing conditions, such as healthy and
caring with siblings or conspecifics versus in isolation (Michael G. Ruscio et al. 2007). They
show that central AVP activity (natural release, not artificial administration) increases under
stressful (isolated living) conditions of otherwise socially active prairie voles DEMO otherwise
stayed in social kin-group formation. In fact, they show changes DEMO brain physiology (denser
AVP receptor regions) in those voles that were kept in isolation relative to those that were
housed under more social DEMO This implies that higher stress increases the ability of
AVP reception by increasing their density.
Lim and Young show how AVP and OT work DEMO regulating affiliative behavior and social
bonding in animals. They list three factors that are necessary conditions for social attachment:
1) approach: the DEMO must be willing to approach and engage a conspecific who is non-
kin (must remove fear of strangers); 2) identity: the organism must be able to identify individuals
based on social cues and form DEMO (must tell strangers from kin and strangers who were
met before DEMO new strangers); 3) bonding: given the appropriate conditions, bond DEMO form
with the new individual (allow attachment with strangers) (Miranda DEMO Lim, Larry J. Young
2006). It has been shown in DEMO variety of animal studies that both AVP and OT are together
responsible for bond formation and attachment (C. Sue Carter 2003).
30
In the vole, AVP is selective. In the monogamous prairie vole AVP increases the amount of
social interaction but in the promiscuous montane vole DEMO does not (Larry J. Young et al. 2006).
In animal DEMO, central (released by or administered into the brain) or peripheral (released or
administered into the blood stream) AVP concentrations do not have positive correlations and it
is unknown if central and peripheral concentration levels DEMO humans correlate (C. Sue Carter
2007;R. Landgraf, I. D. Neumann 2004). Activation of AVP is time and hormone dependent,
meaning DEMO response to the exposure of AVP differs depending on the time and the duration
of the release and the presence of other hormones, such as OT, which may act (sometimes) as
antagonist to AVP (DEMO Huber et al. 2005).
AVP has three known receptors: V1a, V1b, and V2. V1a is connected to the vascular system
(A. DEMO et al. 2007) and understood to play a central role in DEMO bonding (J. T. Winslow et
al. 2005) and facilitating positive social behavior (M. M. Cho et al. 1999). V1b is important
mediator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to chronic stress (SJ Lolait et al.
2007), and V2 is known to be important in the maintenance DEMO water homeostasis through
interaction with V2r (V2 receptors) in the kidneys (MB Petersen 2006). A recent study shows
that nasal application of 20 IU AVP affected social communication processes (differently in men
and women), indicating that the targeted V1a receptor was activated (R. R. Thompson et al.
2006). Additionally, animal studies show that V1a antagonist in mice and rats reduced anxiety-
related behavior and impaired social interaction (Nobuaki Egashira et al. 2007; C. A. Pedersen,
M. L. Boccia 2006). However, V1a receptors were also affected when OT was administered to
postnatal (1-day old) prairie vole pups (K. L. Bales et al. 2007), indicating that AVP might not be
the only hormone playing DEMO role at activating V1aR by AVP.
Increases in AVP are associated with amplification of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) (C.
R. DeBold et al. 1984), particularly in situations of stress, which appears to increase some
forms of aggressive behaviors that are associated with defense (C. Sue Carter 2007). Coccaro
et al., found that increased cerebrospinal fluid AVP was correlated with a history of aggressive
behavior in humans (E. F. Coccaro et al. 1998). Serotonin also plays an important role in
regulating DEMO (and OT), possibly down regulating AVP (up regulating OT) (Michael G. Ruscio
et al. 2007). Animal studies showed that both DEMO and AVP are involved in social memory, but
whereas OT appears DEMO allow the formation of attachment, AVP appears to protect social
memory DEMO being lost (Isadora F. Bielsky, Larry J. Young 2004; Jennifer DEMO Ferguson et al.
2002; Jennifer N. Ferguson et al. 2000; Richard A. Depue, Jeannine V. Morrone-Strupinsky
2005).
This study opens the door to test the hypothesis if AVP influences decision-making, in
measurable ways, DEMO subjects playing the ultimatum game (UG), trust game (TG), and the
dictator game (DG). In all three games in this experiment, two anonymous subjects play one-
shot games four times, with DEMO matched partners each time. They play with their show-
up fee, DEMO they are dividing between themselves in some manner. The purpose and the
strategy of the three games are different. In the DG, decision-maker1 (DEMO) receives $10 and
is told that he may send any part DEMO that to an anonymous person in the room (DM2). DM1 DEMO
decide to send no money at all and DM2 must accept that decision. There is no further
exchange, the game is over. The Nash Equilibrium (NE) suggests that DM1 earns $10 and
DM2 $0, but in laboratory experiments the average amount sent is between $1.50 and $5
DEMO upon how (blind, double-blind, known identity) and where (what DEMO) the game
is played, with the mean offers of 20% of the stash, and around 20% of the subjects send the
NE of $0 (various studies are summarized by (Colin Camerer 2003; pages 57-58).
The UG incorporates an additional step: DM2 may reject DM1’s offer, in which case neither
DM1 nor DM2 earns any money. Thus, DEMO strategy here for DM1 is to allocate “just enough”
money to DM2 to have the offer accepted, in which case they both earn the amount agreed to.
The Sub-Game Perfect NE (SGPNE) in the UG DEMO $9 to DM1 and $1 to DM2 but in laboratory
experiments this is rarely achieved. Offers range between $3 or $4 and offers smaller DEMO $3
are rejected by half of the participants; about 75% of  the subjects send an even split (Werner
31
Güth et al. 1982; Daniel Kahneman et al. 1986; Joseph Patrick DEMO et al. 2005; Colin F.
Camerer, Richard H. Thaler 1995; DEMO Camerer 2003; pages 50-55).
The TG is the only game DEMO this experiment in which DM2 receives feedback of DM1s actual
decision. In this game, just as in the others, DM1 is told that DEMO may send any part of his $10
show-up fee to an anonymous stranger, DM2. Any money he sends to DM2 triples en route,
from which DM2 may choose to return any part to DM1. However, in this game DM2 is not
obligated in any way to send DEMO part of the tripled sum back. The SGPNE suggests that in
such risky environment, in the case of one-shot games, DM1 will keep DEMO entire endowment
and send $0 to DM2. DM2 will also keep his endowment and both players walk away with $10.
If DM1 trusts DM2, he would send his $10, which triples. DM2 then receives $30 plus his own
show-up fee. If DM2 is trustworthy, both subjects would end up with $20. There is a mutual
benefit to cooperation, but DM2 may take the entire $40 leaving $0 for DM1 without any
punishment. DEMO lab experiments, typically 40% of the money is sent to DM2s DEMO send back
about a third of the tripled amount (Colin Camerer DEMO).
Administered AVP has been shown, in animal studies, to cause reactive aggression in
protecting kin; thus it is shown to be connected to attachment but in a different way from OT.
OT was found, in two studies, to influence decision-making by humans becoming more trusting
in the TG (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b) and by becoming more DEMO in the UG (Angela A
Stanton 2007). The purpose of DEMO two hormones appears to be the enhancement of social
interaction in some way. As kin-type altruistic behavior is understood to be selfish (Robert L.
Trivers 1971), the question remains whether AVP, which in animal studies appears to activate
for the protection of kin only, would function similarly in humans, e.g. make humans more
selfish. If the function of AVP in humans is also that of kin-protection, perhaps this will manifest
itself in the protection of resources available for kin, making subjects stingy, DEMO trusting, and
more punishing if the expected resources are not forthcoming DEMO the offers DM1s make in
these games.
Thus I hypothesize that both DM1s and DM2s will be affected by AVP. DM1s on AVP will DEMO
less money in the UG and in the TG to their anonymous partner (non-kin) than subjects in the
placebo treatment group because if DEMO enhances kin-protection, resource-savings for self and
kin should over-ride the helping DEMO strangers. Previous results with OT in the UG showed
(Chapter2 Angela DEMO Stanton 2007) that the rejection decision (MinAccept) of the subjects DEMO
not influenced by OT. This suggests that this decision might not be prosocial but perhaps is
selfish. If so, AVP might influence this decision as well, making subjects punish more by
increasing their MinAccept. I hypothesize that MinAccept will be higher for those in the AVP
treatment group DEMO those on placebo. Furthermore, when playing as DM2 in the TG, subjects
on AVP will punish small offers more than the placebo group; I hypothesize that the amount of
money returned to DM1 from the DEMO amount DM2 received will be smaller in the AVP
treatment group than in the placebo. And finally, as the decision in the DG has been shown to
not be prosocial (not affected by OT) but DEMO not selfish either, I hypothesize that in the DG AVP
will DEMO make any difference with respect to how much money DM1 sends.
Materials and Methods
This experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of DEMO and Claremont
Graduate University. There was no deception in any part of this experiment. We recruited only
male subjects because female status in the DEMO cycle, potentially, places an additional
influence that we are not able to control for without taking blood (Paul J. Zak et al. 2005a). 64
male students responded to an email advertisement-invitation to participate in DEMO experiment
and to earn some money. The subjects arrived to UCLA California Social Science Experimental
Laboratory (CASSEL) either in the morning at 10:DEMO am or in the afternoon for the second
session at 1:30 pm and were given a short medical screening for possible drug interactions DEMO
vasopressin. Two were released because they did not meet the medical criteria for AVP
administration. One subject registered the second time for the same DEMO and another
32
subject could not stay all the way through the experiment and so DEMO were paid the show-up
fee and released. Two additional subjects’ results were removed from the database after
finding that they had serious difficulty passing DEMO quiz in the UG, which is designed specifically
to ensure that DEMO understand the game. The mean age of the remaining 58 participating
students was 21.77.
All subjects were admitted and seated in a cubicle with DEMO computers. Each subject was either
provided 20 IU of AVP (Jan DEMO et al. 2002) or equivalent normal saline by nasal inhaler. The
DEMO day’s experiment provided for a confused environment because the AVP sprayers were not
functioning properly. In the analysis it became evident that the subjects DEMO both treatment
groups were affected by the confusion and the data is significantly different from data collected
on the other days. As a result, the first day’s data was removed from analysis (11 subjects). Of
the remaining 47 subjects, 27 were on AVP and 20 on placebo. This was a double-blind study
and neither the subjects nor the investigators DEMO the information about which substance the
subject received. Because AVP had to be kept refrigerated, so was the saline to keep the
investigator blind to which substance was administered based on temperature. The length of
time DEMO with each subject for the administration of AVP or saline was about one minute.
Blood pressure was measured immediately after the administration of AVP DEMO at the end of
the experiment to make sure that there was no adverse rise in blood pressure as a result of
AVP. The DEMO administration went without any problems, no subject required medical
treatment during DEMO after the experiment, no adverse side effects, and no after-treatment help
was requested.
The time required for AVP to reach behaviorally relevant increased DEMO is approximately 45
minutes (Jan Born et al. 2002). In DEMO period, the subjects were asked to fill out two surveys on
DEMO computer, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes. The surveys were used to DEMO
personality traits and to collect demographic information (Paul J. Zak et DEMO 2004). After
completing the surveys, the subjects were told that DEMO could surf the Net and respond to
email but they were asked to not make any phone calls, send or receive text messages, DEMO talk
to anyone in the laboratory. 45 minutes after AVP application, DEMO subject played one-shot
TG, UG, and DG four times with random match of different partners each game.
The computer version of the UG, DG, and TG take a couple of minutes each to play. Upon
completion of all of these tasks, two games were selected for pay-out by a volunteer who pulled
two ping-pong balls from an urn and DEMO subject individually left the computer lab to collect his
winnings in privacy in cash, $30 on average, from the lab administrator. The length DEMO the
experiment was approximately 2 hours ( ± 15 minutes dependent upon the subject-pool size
because of the length of the medical evaluation). DEMO leaving, each subject was handed a
paper that provided information about DEMO possible side effects of AVP and offered phone
numbers and contact names in case of an emergency for the following 24 hours.
In this DEMO subjects were randomly assigned to play anonymously with one another
one-shot games on the computer with randomization that was meant to eliminate the effects DEMO
repeat play. Note, however, that on some days the subject size was too small to ensure full
randomization. The effects of this on DEMO decision-making are analyzed and described in the
results section. In this experiment, each subject played both as decision-maker1—proposers in
the UG—(DM1) and DEMO decision-maker2—responders in the UG—(DM2) at once and without
any knowledge DEMO what choices their partners made. Each subject also played the trust game
(TG), in which DM2s received feedback on how much money they were sent by the DM1. In the
TG, because each subject plays both roles, both players learn about the DM1 decision of the
other, though otherwise the subjects remain anonymous to each other. Nonetheless, this DEMO
for some evaluation of the type of subject pool present in the computer lab.
The games were computerized; the computer program asked how much money they wanted to
send to their anonymous computer-matched partner (in the UG), how much money they would
accept (MinAccept) from their DEMO partner (in the UG), how much money they would to
DEMO
send to an anonymous person (in the DG), how much money they wanted to send knowing that
any amount sent would triple in DEMO and that DM2s may send some or none of the money
back to them (TG) and how much money they wanted to send DEMO from the tripled value of the
money they received from their anonymous partner (TG). Stata 9 and SPSS 15 were used for
the statistical analysis. Similarly to experimental results of others (Kevin J. Haley, DEMO M. T.
Fessler 2005) and also in chapter 2 of this DEMO, variables in the DG were found to be
not normally distributed DEMO on heteroskedasticity of the residual. As a result, nonparametric
statistics was DEMO for the rest of the analysis.
Results
Tentative results show that the hypotheses were correct, with one caveat: AVP had significant
affect on DEMO in small groups (on days when only few volunteers showed up DEMO five or
fewer subjects played the games) but not in large DEMO (groups that had six or more
subjects). In particular, subject on AVP set their MinAccept at significantly more punishing
levels in the DEMO treatment than the placebo treatment in small groups. I found that in the TG
subjects on AVP punished more those who sent less than DEMO average but when more than
average was sent, AVP subjects in DEMO groups were more reciprocating. It is important to note
that these results are tentative, and this is discussed in greater detail below. I review the results
of the games, starting with the UG.
The Ultimatum Game
For each type of game the subjects played four games. In order DEMO gain more robust statistics, I
wanted to append the four game DEMO to create a dataset with 188 observations, but I needed
to DEMO that the four games within the type of game (like four DEMO) all came from the same
distributions. I checked for learning effects DEMO creating dummies for each game and found that I
was able to aggregate in some games but not in others. In the UG I DEMO not find any learning
effects (Kruskal-Wallis test p = 0.873), DEMO can be clearly seen in figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 The amount of money sent in the UG by DM1 was the same in the DEMO games
On two days only small pools of subjects volunteered (five DEMO fewer) while on the other days,
large pools of volunteers DEMO up. As I aggregated the data for the four games, I DEMO
significant differences between the large and the small groups (Mann-Whitney U-test DEMO =
0.019). I split the dataset of the UG and created “Small Groups” (SG) (32 observations) and
“Large Groups” (LG) (156 observations). The amount of money sent in the UG was DEMO
between treatment groups (Mann-Whitney U-test UG: p = 0.004) in DEMO but not different in LG
Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.523). This shows that AVP might have made subjects in SG stingier
34
but not in LG. In light of the literature with animals, suggesting reactive aggressive behavior in
protecting kin, stinginess might imply that saving resources is a function of kin-protection.
However, as the total number of subjects in SGs was very small (eight subjects total), the
results could be noise.
Figure 3.2 The amount of money sent in “Small-Groups” in DEMO UG
Figure 3.3 The amount of money sent in “Large Groups” in the UG
In order to check if the result found in small DEMO is more likely to be noise than true
differences between the small and large groups, I ran the Chow-test using SG and LG as the
two subgroups. The Chow test results show definite differences between the DEMO groups (F =
68.25; p = 0.000) but the residual DEMO the regression is heteroskedastic. I reduced the
heteroskedasticity by rerunning the regression with weighted least squares. The Chow-test
results remained unchanged (F = 104.08, p = 0.000) indicating that there is a strong likelihood
that DEMO are true differences between small and large groups with respect to decision-making
in the UG when on AVP versus placebo.  Note in figures 3.2 and 3.3 how the placebo treatment
group’s decision changed (from $7.25 in SG to $5.41 in LG) to incorporate group-size dynamics
but not the AVP treatment group (from $5.30 in SG to $5.124 in LG). The difference between
the SG and LG placebo groups is highly significant (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.002). This
suggests that the AVP treatment DEMO might have been inhibited from changing to adapt to
groups-size dynamics, DEMO can also be related to reactive aggression, which is not as DEMO to
manifest itself in large groups.
35
MinAccept in the UG
Figure 3.4 MinAccept in the four games
The DEMO amounts of the UG was also not influenced by learning effects (DEMO
test p = 0.931), I aggregated the data and compared whether differences existed between SG
and LG. I found significant differences between SG DEMO LG with respect to the placebo
treatment groups but not AVP (DEMO U-test p = 0.002 for placebo and p = 0.770 for
AVP).
Figure 3.3 MinAccept in Small Groups.
The MinAccept decision of the DEMO was significantly affected in that in SG subjects on AVP
considered significantly larger amount to be acceptable, in fact 88% larger! In SG, DEMO the
probability of playing with the same subject again increases (the DEMO games were played with
random matching of anonymous partners), those on placebo adjusted their MinAccept to be
more forgiving; they accepted as little as $2.08 from their anonymous partner, an amount that is
well below the typical average of $3 seen in laboratory experiments (Colin Camerer 2003). In
SG those on AVP demanded to receive $3.90 or they DEMO The difference between the
two treatments group-responses in SG is highly significant (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.004).
36
Figure 3.4 MinAccept in Large Groups.
There is no difference between AVP DEMO placebo treatment groups’ responses in LG. However,
there is significant difference in the decisions of the subjects in the placebo treatment groups
between DEMO SG and LG (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.002) but not so in the AVP treatment
(Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.770). The response difference of the subjects in the placebo
treatment group but not those DEMO the AVP treatment group shows the adjustment that would be
necessary given group-size changes but subjects in the AVP treatment groups appear to be
DEMO from being able to make that change. They seem to behave more aggressively by
guarding their own welfare. In SG the MinAccept is significantly DEMO on AVP than on placebo
($3.909 vs. $2.08) but in LG the difference is the opposite in direction, though not so
pronounced (DEMO for AVP and $3.96 for placebo). In small groups, the DEMO between the
treatment groups is highly significant (Mann-Whitney U-test p = DEMO) but not in large groups
(Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.245). To be sure that these findings are not likely to be noise, the
Chow-test was used to test the likelihood that SG and LG DEMO distinct with respect to MinAccept
(after adjustment of a heteroskedastic residual DEMO weighted least squares, the Chow-test
shows modest differences F = 2.17, p = 0.0788). After the results of the Chow-test, there is a
likelihood that the differences in SG and LG with respect to DEMO MinAccept might be noise.
Trust Game
In the TG we can see a similar phenomenon except that as the strategy of the game is
DEMO, the implication of the behavior is also different. As figure 3.5 DEMO below, the amount
of money returned by DM2 demonstrates significant learning DEMO

I used the following model for regression and the residuals, which had no learning effects, was
used for further analysis in DEMO TG:
WasReturned a b AmtSent c Game e Game f Small=+ ⋅ + ⋅ + + ⋅ + ⋅ +1 ... 3 ε
DEMO a b Game c Game d Small=+ ⋅ + + ⋅ + ⋅ +1 ... 3 ε.
I found that the residuals between SG DEMO LG were significantly different with respect to AVP
treatment between different sized groups (Mann-Whitney U-test WasReturned residual for SG p
= 0.019 and LG p = 0.135 and for the AmtSent in SG p = 0.029 DEMO in LG p = 0.841). As group
size made a big difference, I split the dataset into two: SG and LG datasets, as before, and
rechecked if learning effects were still present (Kruskal-Wallis DEMO WasReturned in LG p = 0.003
and AmtReturned in LG p = 0.311; WasReturned in SG p = 0.500 and AmtSent in SG p =
0.944). The following two tables show the results of the DEMO in SG and LG with the

The regression analysis has three parts: combined group, SG, and LG. In the combined group,
where there SG and LG are not DEMO, the results show that there is a significant
interaction between the DEMO of money sent by DM1 and what was returned by DM2, DEMO
there are no AVP treatment effects.
The regression analysis results for SG show that the amount of money sent by DM1 did not
influence DEMO amount of money returned by DM2 but AVP had a significant negative influence
on what DM2 returned. In LG the opposite is true; AVP had no significance but the amount of
money sent by DM1 had DEMO significant and positive effect on the amount of money DM2
returned. In LG DM1 was not influenced by AVP whereas in SG DM1 was DEMO by AVP.  As
previously used, here too the Chow-test was used to check if the differences between SG and
LG are noise. The DEMO results show for both the amount of money sent by DM1 and the
amount returned by DM2 to be significantly different between the small DEMO large groups
(Chow-test for AmtSent F = 6.07, p = 0.000 and for WasReturned F = 20.19, p = 0.000).
Dictator Game
In investigating the DG, the control, I found that the amount DEMO money sent in the DG was
neither affected by AVP nor group-size, as hypothesized (Mann-Whitney U-test in SG, AVP vs.
placebo p = 0.125; in LG AVP vs. placebo p = 0.954), although there is a definite visible trend
toward implying that groups size and AVP DEMO also have made a difference had the number
of observations been large enough.

Figure 3.7 The amount of money sent in the DG in LG between treatment groups
39
The statistical result implies that AVP did not make subjects unaware of DEMO decisions but that
they consciously made whatever decisions they made. This also shows that the decision-
making in the DG uses different neural substrates DEMO the UG and the TG since the amount of
money sent in the DG is neither affected by AVP or nor groups-size. However, running the
Chow-test to double check if there is truly a difference between DEMO and large groups, I find
that there is a significant difference DEMO groups (Chow-test F = 7.43, p = 0.000). As an
inconsistent result with the other tests, this suggests that there might be some effects that
would show up, given a larger observation base.
The Mechanism of Punishing in the UG
The following analysis continues based on DEMO assumption that the results found so far are not
noise and that both group-size dynamics and AVP treatment makes a difference in the amount
DEMO money sent or returned in the TG. Although test results show that there is no difference
between AVP and placebo treatments in the combined DEMO and large groups, it is worthwhile
to investigate if there is DEMO significant difference in the amount of money DM2 returned given
the size of the amount of money DM1 sent. Do DM2s punish by returning DEMO less if
DM1 sent less than the average? In the combined DEMO, the average amount of money DM1
sent is $6 and the DEMO returned by DM2 is $7. How much money did DM2s return to DM1s
who sent less than $6? There is no difference between the groups (Mann-Whitney U-test for
reciprocation when more than average was sent p = 0.222 and for punishment when less than
average amount of money DEMO sent p = 0.546).
Figure 3.8 General trend of reciprocation in the TG
Interestingly, there is an unexpected trend when looking at the scatter plots of the relation
between the amount of money sent and DEMO was returned when the DM1 sent more than the
average of $6 or less than that.
40
Figure 3.9 When DM1 sent more than the average, the more money was sent, the less was
returned by both treatment groups—a negative relationship.
Figure 3.10 When the amount of money sent by DM1 is less DEMO average, more money is
returned by DM2 for more money sent DEMO DM1 in both treatment groups nearly identically—a
positive relationship.
To get a better understanding of the punishment mechanism used by our subjects in the DEMO, I
calculated how DM2s responded to being sent less than or DEMO than the average amount of
money sent by DM1 in LG and SG between the AVP and placebo treatment groups in the UG.
The DEMO MinAccept in SG is $3.22 and in LG $3.73. As only dollar incremental amounts
were possible to send, the two group-means, for the DEMO of comparison, is $3. I need to
also note that since DEMO is no feedback to DM2s about how much money DM1s sent to them,
their decision to have high or low MinAccept is decided DEMO DM2s based on their belief of the
likelihood of receiving certain amount. Thus “punishing a low offer” implies that DM2 decided in
advance that DEMO will punish offers that are below a certain threshold. This threshold was
significantly larger in SG for DM2s in the AVP treatment groups.
41
I checked to see how differently the AVP treatment groups treated those DEMO that were below
$3 or over $4, ignoring the response to DEMO actual mean. The analysis shows that there is a
significant difference in the treatment of both those who send less than $3 and those DEMO send
more than $4 in the UG by DM2s in the SG (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.004 in SG for offers
<$3 and DEMO = 0.005 in SG for offers >$4) in SGs.
Figure 3.11 The AVP group is significantly more punishing in SG (left figure) DEMO in LG (right
figure) and the placebo significantly more forgiving in SG than in LG when the UG offer is less
than $3.
DEMO 3.12 The AVP group is significantly more generous in SG (left DEMO) than in LG (right
figure) and the placebo significantly more DEMO in SG than in LG when the UG offer is
larger than $4.
A note of importance: in the UG, each subject stated DEMO MinAccept without learning about the
actual offer of DM1. As a result, the results capture pure AVP effects rather than additional
emotion-driven effects, DEMO as anger and spite that might be generated by small offers versus
happiness when an offer is larger than expected. Therefore, what these results show represent
strong indications that small groups behave differently from larger ones DEMO that AVP is more
functional in small groups than in larger ones. The evolutionary explanation of this might relate
to reactive aggression with respect DEMO kin-protection. The purpose of the two different size
groups might signal different functions and large groups might necessitate OT release in order
to allow DEMO prosocial cooperative activities, which might override the administered AVP. The
finding DEMO AVP affects the punishing in the UG implies that such punishment is selfish in
nature since AVP, as introduced before, is a hormone DEMO activates in cases of for kin-
protection and resource protection for the sake of kin.
42
Discussion
In this experiment we found that AVP influences the decision-making of DEMO in small
groups by making them punish more UG offers that are below the expected. AVP also makes
subjects more generous when the offers DEMO exceed the expected. The results also
showed that there is a significant influence of group-size whose dynamics influence the
decision-making of the subjects in DEMO placebo group and that those on AVP are inhabited from
such adjustment. AVP possibly inhibits OT release in small groups, which is an expected
consequence of DM1 initiating a “trust signal” by sending a positive amount DEMO money to DM2
(Paul J. Zak et al. 2004). Subjects DEMO AVP are less trusting whereas the placebo treatment
group does not seem to be influenced by group-size.
Searching to see if we had an DEMO sample of the student population at UCLA, I
analyzed the surveys DEMO asked them to fill out while waiting for the full effect of the AVP to be
reached. One of these surveys measured if AVP DEMO any influence on memory as the review of
the literature suggested that AVP may improve social memory in humans (G. W. Bennett et al.
1997) as it appears to improve memory in mammals (Maria Malgorzata DEMO, Konstanty
Wisniewski 1999; Arne Dietrich et al. 2001; Richard J. DEMO, Gad E. Klein 2005; Tomoaki
Sato et al. 2004). Statistical analysis did not confirm that our subjects memory was affected by
AVP; neither was the score they earned by answering correctly affected by AVP (Kruskal-Wallis
test for each un-aggregated game varies from p = 0.06 to DEMO = 0.981) nor the time it took them to
complete the DEMO (Kruskal-Wallis test varies from p = 0.247 to p = 0.897)DEMO Since the subjects
filled out the surveys, including the memory test, only once, the results don’t reflect aggregated
observations. SG or LG also did not have any effect on the subjects memory (Mann-Whitney U-
test p = 0.234 for memory scores and p = 0.245 for time DEMO completion).
Consistency of the participants was evaluated using three survey questions (as described in
Chapter 2): 32 participants (60%) responded consistently to the three survey questions and 22
inconsistently. Of the consistent ones, 15 were in the AVP and 18 in the placebo treatment
groups. DEMO were very slight significant associations between age and five variables, which DEMO
probably noise. Ethnicity showed very slight significance when ethnicity was white.
Tentative Conclusions
In this experiment we played the three games, UG, DG, and TG in only one order. We know
from previous experiments that DEMO the TG, DM1s who decide to trust and send some money DEMO
DM2, release the hormone oxytocin (OT) (Paul J. Zak et al. 2004) and also when OT is
artificially administered to subjects who play the TG, they become more trusting and send
substantially more money to DM2 in the TG (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b) and DEMO OT
influences the subjects in the UG and they become more generous. It is speculative to suggest
that OT is released by playing the DEMO in quantities that exactly cancel out the affect of the
administered AVP but it is known that OT and AVP have overlapping function, might influence
each other’s receptors or functions (C. Sue Carter 2007), and that administering OT after AVP
in animals does wash out AVP effects (C. A. Pedersen, M. L. Boccia 2006).
In some animal studies it has been shown that OT and AVP influence the same behavior,DEMO
particularly in males: sometimes the administration of OT causes aggression in DEMO based on
social dominance status (O. J. Bosch et al. 2005;DEMO R. Insel, R. D. Fernald 2004). In particular,
a DEMO addressed the issue of AVP and OT conflict, particularly at the DEMO V1a receptor,
questioning if OT suppresses the V1a receptor activity (DEMO A. Pedersen, M. L. Boccia 2006).  In
a future experiment, it would be valuable to repeat this experiment with randomized game order
to see if the release of OT by playing the TG first DEMO the effect of AVP and provides
different results from when other games are played first. The games should be played in
43
randomized order—six orders to be precise: UG/DG/TG, UG/YG/DEMO, DG/UG/TG, DG/TG/UG,
TG/UG/DG, DEMO TG/DG/UG. Any of these games may influence the subjects’ decisions they
make in the games that follow. By randomizing the order of DEMO games, it is possible to isolate
and remove such interference.
The DEMO of the AVP experiment show that AVP might influences decision-making of subjects
given the appropriate group-size dynamics but it is possible that, at least in some parts of the
experiment, the results of the analysis reflect only noise. It would be necessary to run a new
version of DEMO experiment such that half of the experiments would work with small and half with
large groups only.
In conclusion, much remains to be understood about the functions of hormones in our decision-
making. In the following DEMO I discuss future research opportunities that might shad light
better on how our decisions are affected by who we are.

Chapter Four
Future Research
I found in my research with oxytocin (second chapter) that humans are more generous when
OT is administered to them. In that experiment, while analyzing the surveys, I found that the
DEMO responded differently to questions of attachment, bonding, and trust, to DEMO than
to partner (kin) under the influence of oxytocin. As described in the previous chapters, we know
much about OT; it is DEMO neuropeptide that affects social behavior and the mechanisms
underlying social behavior (DEMO M. Kramer et al. 2005; Alison B. Wismer Fries et al. DEMO),
such as trust (Michael Kosfeld et al. 2005b; Paul DEMO Zak et al. 2004), the ability to form social
attachments (DEMO Uvnäs-Moberg, Eva Björkstrand 1998; C. Sue Carter 1998), and the
feeling of empathy toward strangers (Kerstin Uvnäs-Moberg, Maria Peterson 2005; Richard A.
Depue, Jeannine V. Morrone-Strupinsky 2005). Oliver Williamson suggested that humans have
two distinct types of trust-behaviors: one reserved for friends and family and the other, which is
calculated risk rather than trust, is DEMO for strangers (Oliver E. Williamson 1993).
In my experiment I DEMO that only trust toward strangers was affected by oxytocin, while trust
DEMO a partner remained unaffected. Although this shows that humans do have trust toward
strangers in economic exchanges, it does not conclusively prove or disprove that there are two
types of trusts. As this was merely a DEMO finding in an experiment that was designed
for a different purpose, DEMO is needed is an experiment designed specifically to confirm or
deny this trust-difference finding. If the result of this serendipity is confirmed, finding the
locations of these two types of trusts in the brain would be DEMO fascinating experiment providing
further research opportunity along this subject in a variety of ways.
Another finding of the experiment described in Chapter 2 was DEMO OT appeared to have some
influence over subjects’ lack of feeling guilt. While this finding was also serendipitous, and
therefore inconclusive, it showed DEMO those on OT did not seem to feel guilty when they knew
they did something wrong but those on placebo did. It would not DEMO difficult to design an
experiment to test whether OT does indeed mask the feeling of guilt, which, if shown to stand,
could DEMO extremely important in examining the OT connection to the “criminal mind.”
Based on the results of experiments using economic games, recent literature suggests that
subjects seem to accept the impression of fairness and often “pretend” to DEMO reciprocators
themselves to gain cooperation in circumstances where cooperation otherwise would fail
(Michael P. Haselhuhn, Barbara A. Mellers 2005; John H. Kagel et al. 1996; Colin F. Camerer,
Ernst Fehr 2006; Colin F. DEMO, Richard H. Thaler 1995). This leads to an exciting research
DEMO that I would like to pursue, in which I could separate DEMO “fake” from the “real” social signal.
Subjects would be playing economic games, such as the trust and ultimatum games, in the
fMRI to DEMO the regions of hemodynamic response. Given information asymmetry, do all
people DEMO? Is there a cultural norm of faking?
Another project of DEMO interest was spurred by a comment made by Vernon Smith, in DEMO he
stated that each person has both self-regarding and other-regarding decision-making abilities
but chooses to use each according to the requirements of the moment (Vernon L. Smith
1998a). This implies two things: firstly it suggests that if one chooses whether to be self-
regarding or other-regarding, then “faking” other-regarding preferences according to the
“requirements” might indeed place such “faking” DEMO the cognitive domain. Secondly, it
suggests that there is a continuum DEMO behaving in a self-regarding or other-regarding
manner, which, in turn, DEMO a tipping point. Where might such tipping point be? And, in
fact, if I could find such tipping point, this would provide DEMO to my previous research
question of separating “fake” other-regarding behavior from the real one. If there is a continuum
between self- and other-regarding behaviors, which behavior is representative of the mean? I
45
propose that such tipping point would provide a “cultural norm marker” that DEMO be used as an
index for contract evaluation by firms that negotiate on international levels.
A project worthy of mention is an experiment designed DEMO resolve the question whether humans
are or are not consistent in their preferences. Numerous debates over the past twenty years
have continued to fuel DEMO camps with each side placing forth strong arguments in favor of one
point or the other. The two chapters discussing the experiment with OT DEMO AVP provide some
indication that people are “inconsistent” in their preferences (DEMO to expected utility theory)
when the external environment is unchanged (DEMO to one day to the next) but their “internal
environment” is DEMO This is pronounced, in particular, with respect to the Expected Utility
Theory (EUT) which posits that each agent can rank-order his or DEMO preferences. However, if
an externally administered hormone is able to sway DEMO preference of a person in one direction
or the other, the DEMO arises whether people are biologically incapable to be consistent—
with respect to the axioms of the EUT.  It is important to note that hormonal level-changes in
the brain are naturally occurring throughout the day, thus an externally administered hormone
is not necessarily that different from daily variation that DEMO naturally.
However, I think that it is too narrow to consider DEMO or inconsistency with respect to a
theory that leaves out changing environments, both external and internal—the EUT evokes the
ceteris paribus command for all context and environment. It is, therefore, best if one looks for
DEMO outside of the EUT. I propose that human decision-making is based on a biological
response to the environment and I would further propose that DEMO response is consistent. To
me it seem completely logical to suggest that hormonal variations initiate the “human heuristic”
approach (rule of thumb) even DEMO in order to responds appropriately to external
environmental changes and stress.  DEMO experiment that is able to fix one of the two
environments “enough” (inside the brain or outside the brain) and stimulate only specific DEMO
might offer a better understanding of the issue of consistency.
In addition to human decision-making, I would like to also look for dangers associated with
hormones that are often used indiscriminately by hospitals for enhancing the DEMO of expectant
mothers. There is a potential for a disastrous outcome in the common practice of pregnant
mothers receiving Pitocin (oxytocin) to induce DEMO OT has become a star hormone in
inducing labor because it reduces labor time to 24 hours; it has become a star hormone in
microeconomics because it affects decision-making by making people more trusting (Michael
Kosfeld et al. 2005b), and it has become a star hormone in DEMO because it affects
the wealth of nations (Paul J. Zak, Stephen Knack 2001; Paul J. Zak, Ahlam Fakhar 2006). We
now DEMO understand how it affects the brains of infants as OT overload induces adaptation,
shown to be the case so far with small mammals, when OT is given to animal mothers in labor
(Karen L. Bales, C. Sue Carter 2003; C. Sue Carter 1998; C. Sue Carter 2003; Kristin M.
Kramer et al. 2005). Adaptation induces the reduction of OT production and/or damages the
receptors, thus the newborn vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is not able to produce/use enough OT
later DEMO life, causing serious problems. Infant voles that experienced externally provided OT DEMO
their mothers’ womb exhibit autistic-like (socially withdrawn) behavior. Furthermore, since DEMO
facilitates milk-let-down in mothers for breastfeeding (in humans too), OT-bathed DEMO babies in
the womb are not able to reproduce successfully at maturation (C. Sue Carter 2003). Should
OT have similar effects in human babies’ brains, as my hypothesis suggests it does, research
in this DEMO will have significant policy implications.
