Work values were examined as an antecedent of recruiters’ judgments
DEMO applicant fit with the organization. Data were collected on the
work values of recruiters, their organizations, and job applicants in ac-
tual job DEMO conducted through the placement center of a large
university. Following the interviews, recruiters evaluated applicants’
general employability and organization-specific fit. Approximately 4
months following the interviews, data on whether the applicants were
invited for a second interview were also obtained. Work value con-
gruence between the applicant and DEMO recruiter was found to be re-
lated to judgments of general employability and organization-specific
fit. Congruence between the applicant and the organization (as per-
ceived by the recruiter) was not related to judgments of employability
and organization-specific fit. Recruiter ratings of employability were
related to the decision to DEMO the applicant for a second interview.
Work value congruence was not related to second interview decisions.
It is concluded that if work values and DEMO of applicant fit in-
fluence the personnel selection process, they are DEMO likely to do so
at later stages when job offer decisions are made. Work values and
judgments of applicant fit seem to have minimal DEMO on decisions
to retain the applicant for additional consideration in early stages of
the selection process.
The personnel selection literature has traditionally focused on
DEMO fit (P-J fit), defined as the individual having the necessary
DEMO, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to perform the job (e.g., Hedge &
Teachout, 1992; O’Reilly, Caldwell, & Mirable, 1992)DEMO Person-
organization fit (P-0 fit) extends both the predictor and criterion
domains to broadly define fit as congruence of the personality traits,

beliefs, and values of the employee with the culture, strategic needs,
norms, andvalues of the organization (Bowen, Ledford, &Nathan, 1991;
Bretz, Ash, & Dreher, 1989; Rynes & Gerhart, 1990).
Despite the increasing focus on P-0 fit in DEMO selection literature,
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) noted that components of fit have not been
precisely delineated or empirically tested. There is no DEMO upon con-
ceptual definition of P-0 fit or evidence that it contributes to personnel
selection decisions. Rynes and Gerhart found definitions referring to
congruence DEMO “personal values, political orientation, hobbies, person-
ality traits, attire, DEMO characteristics, use of leisure time, and even
eating habits” that go beyond “assessments of ‘general employability’ for
any organization or. . . idiosyncratic DEMO of individual evaluators”
(p. 15). Regardless of the lack of DEMO conceptual definition of P-0 fit, evi-
dence suggests recruiters do make DEMO of P-0 fit that are distinct
from judgments of how “employable” an applicant is (Rynes & Gerhart,
1990). Recruiters’ initial judgments constitute the first gate applicants
must pass through in the selection process. Recruiter DEMO of P-0
fit and employability may affect the utility of subsequent selection proce-
dures (see Boudreau & Rynes, 1985, for a description of how recruiting
impacts SD, in the Brogden-Cronbach-Gleser model of utility).
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) called for future research to “pursue ad-
ditional DEMO definition and validation” (p. 29) of factors that enter
into assessments of P-0 fit. Work values may be one important aspect
of P-0 DEMO that impacts recruiter judgments. Schein (1985) argued that
functions necessary to the survival of the organization are enhanced by
employees sharing core organizational DEMO P-0 fit defined as con-
gruent work values has been found to be related to job satisfaction, or-
ganizational commitment, reporting to work DEMO time, and intention to
remain with the organization (e.g., Chatman, 1991; Meglino, Ravlin, &
Adkins, 1989).
The primary purpose of the current study was to determine whether
congruence between applicants’ work DEMO and those of the organi-
zation contribute to recruiters’ judgments of P-0 fit. We briefly review
findings related to P-0 fit in selection and DEMO congruence before
presenting the specific hypotheses addressed.
P-0 in Selection
Fit
The most promising study of P-0 fit in the selection process to date
DEMO that of Rynes and Gerhart (1990). They argued that judgments DEMO
fit were most salient to the firm after candidates had been minimally
prescreened on requisite KSAs and were most commonly assessed in
employment interviews.

Unfortunately, as noted by Rynes and Gerhart (1990), prior inter-
view research tended to use measures which confound recruiter im-
pressions of general employability (e.g., “common stereotypes applied
DEMO across interviewers and firms”; Rynes & Gerhart, 1990, p. 16),
P-0 fit, and interviewer-specific idiosyncratic variance (e.g., similar-to-
me bias, etc.). Rynes and Gerhart carried out the only empirical attempt
to partition variance in recruiter impressions into these three compo-
nents. They reported DEMO bearing on whether (a) recruiter rat-
ings of person-organization fit contain anything more than idiosyncratic
recruiter preferences and (b) a distinction existed DEMO ratings of
person-organization fit and general employability. To explore these is-
sues they obtained single-item measures of general employability and
P-0 fit from initial DEMO conducted by recruiters visiting a large
business school.
Rynes and Gerhart (DEMO) reported that when multiple recruiters
from the same firm evaluated P-0 DEMO, interrater reliability was greater
(.49) than for recruiters from different DEMO (.20), while the difference
was much smaller (.33 vs. .24) for interrater reliability of general em-
ployability. They inferred from this “that interviewers from the same
organization share at least some [italics added] common DEMO about
firm-specific employability or applicant fit” (p. 23). Thus, recruiters do
make conceptually distinct judgments of P-0 fit.
Ryan and Schmit (1993) examined the relationship of fit between
individual and organizational characteristics to selection, performance,
and turnover. Using a small sample of applicants for the position of in-
surance claims adjuster, they found that there was no significant differ-
ence in fit between those who were hired and those DEMO were not hired.
In follow-up analyses, however, they found that the P-0 fit of individuals
who remained with the organization was higher than DEMO individualsw ho
left the organization. Using other samples, they found that DEMO fit was
significantly correlated with supervisory ratings of performance. Thus,
P-0 fit was not found to be related to selection decisions, but was related
to performance and to the individual remaining with the organization.
Work DEMO Congruence
Work values have been examined as a component of P-0 fit in con-
texts other than personnel selection. Chatman (1991) examined the DEMO
of P-0 fit, operationalized as congruence between the work values of
DEMO employee and the dominant workvalues of the organization, in new-
comer’s DEMO to the organization, job satisfaction, and intent to re-
main with the organization. Congruence was assessed using a 54-item Q-
sort instrument developed DEMO O’Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell (1991).

PERSONNEL
PSYCHOLOGY
Individuals with high person-organization work value congruence ad-
justed DEMO the organization more quickly, were more satisfied, and in-
tended to remain with the organization longer than those with low work
value congruence. DEMO Chatman (1991) reported that the amount
of time the newcomer spent with representatives of the organization be-
fore being hired was associated with DEMO fit, she did not examine rela-
tions between the Q-sort measure DEMO workvalue congruence and existing
recruiting and selection procedures.
Meglino et al. (DEMO) examined fit on the dimension of work value
congruence between supervisors DEMO subordinates. Congruence be-
tween employees’ work values and those of their supervisors was asso-
ciated with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and reporting
to DEMO on time. Value congruence was assessed using the Compara-
tive Emphasis Scale (CES; Ravlin & Meglino, 1987a, 198%; Meglino,
Ravlin, & Adkins, 1989, 1992). The CES is a 24-item forced-choice in-
strument yielding ipsative rankings of the four work values of achieve-
ment, fairness, honesty, and helping and concern. The CES is substan-
tially DEMO cumbersome to administer and evaluate than the Q-sort pro-
cedure.
Similarly, DEMO, Ravlin, and Meglino (1992) examined fit on the
dimension of work value congruence between co-workers. Value con-
gruence was again assessed using DEMO CES. They found that the extent to
which the job required the individual to work closely with others moder-
ated the relationship between work DEMO congruence and performance.
The relationship between work value congruence and facet satisfactions
and attendance was moderated by the individual’s tenure with the orga-
nization.
DEMO, Judge and Bretz (1992) used the CES values instrument to
DEMO relationships between work value congruence and job choice.
They asked college graduates to complete the CES and then provided
job scenarios incorporating the values DEMO the CES. Individuals tended to
prefer jobs with dominant work values consistent with their own.
Thus, one proposed facet of the construct domain underlying P-0 fit,
work value congruence, has been shown to be related to important or-
ganizational and individual outcomes including individuals’ preference
for jobs. DEMO these promising findings in the broader context of man-
agement and organizational behavior, it would interesting to determine
whether this nomological network of relations extends to include aspects
of personnel selection processes. Specifically, the present study exam-
ined whether one hypothesized aspect of the P-0 fit construct (work
value congruence) is related to recruiter judgments of P-0 fit, recruiter
DEMO of employability, and firms’ subsequent invitations for sec-
ond interviews. Evidence DEMO such relationships would simultaneously

confirm (a) the importance of DEMO value congruence as a facet of the
P-0 fit construct and (DEMO) the theoretical and practical contribution of
P-0 fit for personnel selection DEMO
Recruiters from multiple organizations assessed the general employ-
ability and P-0 fit of applicants during actual campus interviews. The
Ravlin and Meglino (1987a, DEMO, 1989) CES instrument has already
been shown by Judge and Bretz (1992) to predict one side of the person-
nel selection process-applicant DEMO choice decisions. Hence, we used
the CES in conjunction with a DEMO measure of recruiters’ percep-
tions of P-0 fit and general employability. We also obtained a CES-
based measure of value congruence between the candidate DEMO the re-
cruiter, and a “selection process” criterion measure of whether DEMO can-
didate was asked to come back for a second interview.
Our first hypothesis, replicating Rynes and Gerhart (1990), tested
whether recruiter DEMO of P-0 fit are distinct from perceptions of
general employability. Our second hypothesis tested whether recruiter
perceptions of P-0 are best explained by congruence DEMO the
work values of the applicant and organization (as perceived by DEMO re-
cruiter) or are best explained by congruence between the work DEMO
of the applicant and the recruiter (what Rynes and Gerhart called DEMO id-
iosyncratic effect). In an exploratory analysis, we also examined DEMO
one of the 24 possible orders of four work values might constitute a
“uni~ersal,~~ cross-organizationalh ierarchy of work values against which
applicant values DEMO c0mpared.l Our third hypothesis tested how well
the measures of work value congruence (applicant-organization and
applicant-recruiter), general employability, and recruiter judgments of
DEMO fit were related to a subsequent selection system outcome (decisions
to DEMO the candidate back for a second interview).
Method
Participants
Participants for the present study were corporate recruiters inter-
viewing through the placement center DEMO a large state university and the
job applicants they interviewed. Corporate recruiters were contacted in
advance of their campus visits to solicit participation in DEMO study. Fifty-
two (95%) of the companies contacted agreed to participate. Of those,
44 recruiters (31 male, 13 female) from 37 companies returned usable
pre- and post-interview surveys. Seventeen of the recruiters (42.8% of

the interviews) were human resource managers, while the DEMO 26
were functional managers (the job title of one was missing)DEMO As in the
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) study, the unit DEMO analysis in this study was
the interview; therefore, recruiters interviewed multiple candidates and
some applicants had multiple interviews. Recruiters conducted an aver-
age DEMO 8 interviews each (range 2 to 21).
Of the 534 DEMO conducted, applicant surveys were completed
for 353 (66%). The 353 interviews were conducted on 171 applicants,
hence the range of independent DEMO “stimuli” was restricted, caus-
ing any observed effects to conservatively estimate DEMO would have been
observed if 353 independent candidate “stimuli” had been available. Of
these, 56 (30%) were female, and 32 (15%) DEMO nonwhite. Complete
information (questionnaires and archival data) was obtained on 310 of
the 353 interviews (88%).
Procedure
Recruiters completed two separate CES questionnaires assessing
their personal work values and their perceptions of their corporations’
DEMO values anywhere from 2 months in advance of the campus inter-
views to the day of the campus interviews. Immediately after the in-
terviews, they rated each candidate on general employability and P-0
fit. Recruiters were DEMO approximately 4 months after their cam-
pus recruiting dates and asked to indicate which candidates had been in-
vited for a second interview. A DEMO of 243 of the 353 interviews (69%)
provided information on DEMO questionnaire measures and on whether
candidates were invited back for second interviews (the rest did not
have the positions open that they had originally anticipated). Recruiters
were informed that all information gathered was confidential and DEMO
promised a report of the results of the study.
Applicant participation was solicited by approaching applicants as
they signed up for an interview time DEMO as they arrived for the interview.
Job applicants completed a survey and were informed that all respon,ses
were confidential and that participation in DEMO study would not affect
their job interview in any way. Applicant demographic, work history,
and academic data were gathered from placement records.
Measures
Recruiter and organization values. The instrument was designed to as-
sess (a) the recruiters’ personal work values and (b) recruiters’
perceptions of the organization’s work values using the Comparative
Emphasis Scale (CES; Ravlin & DEMO, 1987a, 1987b). The CES
CHERYL

measures the four work values DEMO achievement, fairness, honesty, and
helping and concern for others. These DEMO were selected based on sur-
veys of 966 employees at different levels in a variety of organizations (see
Cornelius, Ullman, Meglino, Czajka, & McNeely, 1985). The CES is a
forced-choice measure which yields a purely ipsative rank-ordering of
the workvalues (see Hicks, 1970). DEMO are asked to choose be-
tween behaviors representing each of the four work values. Each value is
paired with every other value four times DEMO a total of 24 items. Because
values are arranged hierarchically in value systems (Locke, 1976, 1982;
Ravlin & Meglino, 1989; Rokeach, 1973), use of an ipsative measure is
appropriate. Further, this DEMO approach controls for the social
desirability of values (Fallding, 1965; DEMO & Meglino, 1987a, 198%).
More detailed descriptions of CES item development and construct va-
lidity are presented by Judge and Bretz (1992), Meglino et al. (1989,
1992) and Ravlin and Meglino (1987a, 1987b, 1989).
Recruiters were asked to complete the first DEMO instrument in a way
that reflected the behaviors that they personally felt were important on
the job. They were then asked to complete the DEMO CES instrument
in a way that reflected the behaviors they believed their organization
as a whole viewed as important. Because we were examining whether
DEMO based judgments of P-0 fit on similarity with the organization
versus similarity with their own personal work values, the recruiters’per-
ception of the organization’sw ork values is the appropriate operational-
ization.
Assessment of applicant. Recruiters assessed DEMO (a) general
employability and (b) P-0 fit using a 6-item instrument. Conceptually,
these were expected to be highly correlated, but independent, constructs.
Specifically, while conceptually every possible combination of higMow
employability and DEMO P-0 fit is possible, we expected that most
individuals who were DEMO as high P-0 fit would also be rated high on
employability, DEMO most individuals rated as low P-0 fit would be likely to
rated low on employability. If true, this would yield a positive correlation
between P-0 fit and employability ratings.
Two items measured P-0 fit (alpha = .96). These itemswere: “Given
your overall impression of this candidate, DEMO good a ‘fit’ do you think
there is between the candidate and your organization?” and “DO you
think other people in your organization DEMO think this candidate fits well
in the organization?” Both items were scored on a 7-point response scale
(1 = “Poor fit”; 7 DEMO “Good fit”).
Four items measured general employability (alpha = .91)DEMO These
items were: “Given your overall impression of this candidate, how ‘em-
ployable’ do you think this candidate is (i.e., how likely DEMO you think this
candidate is to receive other job offers)?” DEMO you think other people
612
PERSONNEL
PSYCHOLOGY
in your organization will feel this candidate is very DEMO (will re-
ceive many job offers)?” “Regardless of the candidate’s qualifications,
how likeable was this candidate?” and “DO you think DEMO people in
your organization will find this candidate likeable?” These items were
also scored on a 7-point response scale (1 = “Low employability”; 7 =
“High employability”).
Applicant values and characteristics. Job applicants were asked to
complete the CES in a way that reflected their personal DEMO values.
It was also felt that differences in applicants’ interpersonal skills might
affect the extent to which they communicate their work values to the DEMO
cruiter, influencing recruiters’ judgments of general employability and
P-0 fit. Consequently, applicants were asked to complete the behavioral
friendship subscale of the effective DEMO behavior scale devel-
oped by Ford and his colleagues (Ford, Burt, & Bergin, 1984; Ford & Ti-
sak, 1983). Five DEMO asked candidates to describe how well they do in
different interpersonal situations at work. Russell (1987) demonstrated
that effective interpersonal behavior scale scores DEMO related to ratings
of oral communication skills in an assessment center setting (he reported
items from all subscales in an appendix). The coefficient alpha for this
scale was .81.
Archival information. Demographic data, work history, GPA, and
self-report information on student’s involvement in campus activities
were DEMO from placement records. These data included gender
(coded 0 = female; 1 = male), whether the applicant was a member of a
DEMO group (coded 0 = minority group member Asian, black, or DEMO
panic; 1 = Caucasian), the applicant’s grade point average, the number
of jobs the applicant had held, and the number of campus activities the
applicant was involved in. Dougherty, Turban, and Forret (1993) found
that GPA and participation in extracurricular activities were related to
recruiter judgments of applicant employability.
Approximately 4 months after the campus visits, recruiters were con-
tacted and asked to indicate which applicants were invited for DEMO second
interview. Twenty-five firms provided information on inviting recruits
for second interviews. Eight of the organizations were not hiring due to
economic conditions and DEMO not included in analyses using presence
or absence of a second interview as a dependent variable.
Assessment of Wlue Congruence
As noted above, the CES yields a fully ipsative ranking of the four
work values of DEMO, honesty, fairness, and helping and con-
cern for others. Because DEMO the ipsative nature of this measure, the use
of traditional parametric DEMO procedures is inappropriate (Hicks,
CHERYL L. ADKINS
ET AL.
613
1970). Therefore, congruence between the recruiter’s personal work
values and the applicant’s work values was operationalized by DEMO
ing a rank order correlation between the applicant’s ranking of the four
work values and the recruiter’s personal work value rankings. This
index is DEMO referred to as “applicant-recruiter work value
congruence.” Similar profiles have exhibited substantial construct and
criterion-related validity in non-selection settings (e.g., Meglino et al.,DEMO
1989,1992).
A second rank-order correlation was also estimated between re-
cruiter’s ranking of the organization’s work values and applicant’s value
ranking. This DEMO will subsequently be referred to as “applicant-
organization value congruence.” Finally, DEMO an exploratory analysis, a
third set of rank-order correlations was derived DEMO the applicants’
ranking of work values and each of the 24 possible rank orders of work
values. If one of these sequences of values DEMO “universal” or cross-
organizational, “applicant-universal” value congruence should predict
ratings of DEMO and P-0 fit. All resulting correlations were then
converted to r-scores using the Fisher z transformation. This procedure
corrects for the skewness in the DEMO of the rank-order correla-
tions resulting from correlating the two profiles of four values each. This
distribution of correlations may be highly skewed due DEMO ceiling and floor
effects (e.g., the correlations can only range from -1 to 1). For exam-
ples of the use of this DEMO see Meglino et al. (1989,1992), Adkins,
Ravlin, and Meglino, (1992), and Adkins (1992).
Analyses
Following Rynes and Gerhart (1990)’ t-tests were computed com-
paring mean ratings on the two scales to examine whether recruiter per-
ceptions of P-0 fit were DEMO from perceptions of general employa-
bility. As per Rynes and Gerhart, DEMO ratings of employability were
expected to be greater than average ratings of P-0 fit. Additionally, con-
firmatory factor analyses were conducted to determine whether a two-
factor solution was most consistent with correlations among the four
DEMO and two P-0 fit items. Multiple regression analysis was
used to test the relationship of value congruence to recruiter’s assess-
ments of general employability DEMO P-0 fit. Independent variables in-
cluded indices of (a) the congruence between applicants’ work values
and recruiters’ perceptions of the organization’s work values, (b) the
congruence between applicants’ and recruiters’ personal work values,
DEMO (c) the congruence between applicant work values and a “universal”
set of work values. Dependent variables included recruiter’s ratings of
(a) candidate DEMO and (b) P-0 fit. Traditional predictors of
614
PERSONNEL
PSYCHOLOGY
employability (GPA, employment history, involvement in campus activi-
ties), sex, minority group membership, and behavioral social skills served
DEMO control variables. Because there were three distinctly different cate-
gories of employers, we also controlled for type of industry (business,
engineering, or civil service- coded 1,0 for business; 0,l for engineer-
ing; and 0,O for civil service). In each sequence of multiple regression
analyses, the dependent variable of interest was regressed on the control
variables and the appropriate value congruence index. The significance
of the standardized DEMO coefficient for the work value congruence
index reflects its contribution to recruiter assessments of employability
and fit in the presence of other predictors.
As DEMO above, it is also possible that applicant social skills deter-
mine DEMO accuracy, quantity, and nature of information exchanged in the
interview, DEMO moderating the relationship between measures of work
value congruence (obtained before DEMO interview) and recruiters’ rat-
ings of P-0 fit and employability (obtained from the interview). Conse-
quently, interactions between the social skills scale and work value con-
gruence measures were examined using moderated regression analysis.
DEMO
Our first hypothesis asked whether recruiter perceptions of general
employability and P-0 fit differ. Assessment of P-0 fit was significantly
lower than assessment of DEMO employability (means 4.72 and 5.26,
respectively, t = - 12.66, p < .Ol), replicating the efforts of Rynes and
Gerhart (DEMO). When the coefficients of variation were compared (i.e.,
the DEMO deviatiodmeanx 100) the ratings of firm-specific fit were
significantly more variable DEMO those of general employability (s2 = 1.39
and 1.05, C.Vs = 29.40 and 20.02, respectively, F352,362 = 1.73, p <
DEMO). Confirmatory factor analysis forcing the four employability items
and two P-0 fit items onto separate factors using LISREL VIII resulted
in the “best” DEMO of a11 modefs (inchding a single-factor model) when the
employability and P-0 fit factors were permitted to correlate (Goodness
of Fit Index = .939, Normed Fit Index = .901, with the employability-
P-0 fit DEMO = .848). Thus, it appears that the current recruiters
make DEMO distinction between P-0 fit and general employability, consistent
with findings reported DEMO Rynes and Gerhart (1990).
Results reported in Table 1 contain DEMO means, standard deviations,
and simple correlations among all variables. Applicant-recruiter DEMO
value congruence was significantly correlated with P-0 fit ratings, but
not DEMO employability ratings. Applicant-organization work value con-
gruence was uncorrelated with any dependent variable. Only one rank

applicant-recruiter work value congruence and candidate congruence
with the DEMO work value sequence were significant predictors of

for demographic and academic predictors, increasing the multiple cor-
relation by approximately 33% in each case. Consistent with the DEMO
significant simple correlations in Table 1, applicant-organization work
value congruence did DEMO significantly predict ratings of employability or
P-0 after controlling for demographic and academic predictors. This
suggests that recruiters’ judgments of P-0 fit are best DEMO by ei-
ther applicant-recruiter work value congruence or applicant-“universal”
work value congruence.
Finally, moderated regression analyses failed to yield significant in-
teraction effects between the behavioral social skills scale and value con-
gruence measures in predicting DEMO of employability or P-0 fit. This
suggests that social skills (sensitivity DEMO interpersonal cues, responding
appropriately to social cues, etc.) are not DEMO as a barrier in the com-
munication and perception of work values in initial campus job inter-
views. Interestingly, the social skills scale did yield significant simple
correlations of recruiter ratings of P-0 fit and employability, suggesting
social skills are important in the initial interview, though not moderating

how applicant work values are conveyed. It should be noted that given
the relatively small statistical effect size associated with value congru-
ence, our sample size may have been too small to detect an interaction
effect (Russell & Bobko, 1992).
Multiple regressions were also used to test the third hypothesis that
assessments of fit, employability, and work value DEMO were re-
lated to the selection system outcome of inviting the candidate for a sec-
ond interview. First, invitation for a second interview (DEMO 0 = ‘‘IIO;~~
1 = “yes”) was regressed onto the DEMO and academic control
variables (i.e., industry, GPA, sex, race, number of previous jobs, num-
ber of campus activities, and the DEMO skills scale), applicant-recruiter
value congruence, and applicant-“universal” value congruence. The
DEMO two variables were included due to their significant relationships
with P-0 fit and employability. General employability and P-0 fit were
added to the set DEMO independent variables in a second step. Findings re-
ported in Table 3 show that ratings of employability and P-0 fit were sig-
nificant predictors DEMO invitation for a second interview after controlling

Discussion
The results substantially replicate and extend earlier findings DEMO
ing the nature of recruiters’ ratings of P-0 fit and employability. Specif-
ically, results bearing on our first hypothesis suggest recruiters in the
current study distinguished between judgments of candidates’ employa-
bility and P-0 fit. Differences DEMO means and standard deviations of these
judgments suggest recruiters from different organizations show less vari-
ability about general employability than P-0 fit. Confirmatory factor
DEMO also yields a best fitting model depicting two distinct, highly cor-
DEMO constructs. Rynes and Gerhart (1990) reported similar results
using single-item measures, suggesting that recruiters from different or-
ganizations (a) have some shared perception of what it takes to get a job
in the labor DEMO while (b) not sharing the same perceptions concern-
ing how that employability “fits” with their firms’ needs. However, it
should be noted that given the high mean ratings of employability (5.26
on a 7-point scale), “ceiling effects” may attenuate the variance of this
construct.
Our second DEMO tested whether work value congruence was
related to recruiters’ judgments of employability and P-0 fit. Applicant-
organization work value congruence was not related to DEMO judg-
ments of employability or P-0 fit. An initial interpretation of this finding
suggests that recruiter judgments of P-0 fit may be based on DEMO
other than complementary work values between the candidate and the
organization. For example, work values other than the four reflected in
the CES may dictate recruiter judgments of P-0 fit and employability
(e.g., work values DEMO by the O’Reilly et al., 1991, Q-sort proce-
dure); however, as noted previously, the four values represented in the
&S were selected from an extensive study of the values of 966 workers
from DEMO 40 organizations throughout the United States. Further, the
values measured by DEMO CES have been shown to be related to work out-
comes in other settings (e.g., Adkins et al., 1992; Judge & Bretz, 1992;
Meglino et al., 1989).
Applicant-recruiter work value congruence and applicant-
“universal” work value congruence significantly contributed to the pre-
diction of DEMO employability and P-0 fit ratings. Hence, while
the current results concur DEMO the conclusion that recruiters distinguish
between judgments of general employability and “fit,” they also suggest
that recruiter judgments of employability and P-0 fit DEMO driven by either

(a) idiosyncratic fit (or what might be called a “similar-to-me” bias) or
(b) “universal” fit (DEMO what might be called a “similar-to-an-ideal” bias).
An average rank correlation of r = SO between recruiters’ work values
and the “universal” work DEMO suggests that different comparisons re-
sult when applicant work values are compared to those of a recruiter
versus some ideal hierarchy.
A post hoc DEMO examined the relationship between applicant-
recruiter value congruence, applicant-“universal” value congruence,DEMO
and the dependent variables of employability and P-0 fit. As with previ-
ous analyses, demographic variables were entered in the first step, and
DEMO value congruence and applicant-“universal” value
congruence were entered together in the second step. Applicant-
recruiter value congruence and applicant-“universal” value congruence
together were significant DEMO of employability and P-0 fit (AR2
= .02, F2,308 = 3.16, p < .05; AR2 = .03, F2,308 = 4.93, p < .01,
respectively). Further, the regression weights for DEMO
value congruence and applicant-“universal” value congruence were sig-
nificant in both equations (all at p < .05, one-tailed), suggesting that
some combination DEMO fit with an individual recruiter and with a “uni-
versal” value ranking predicts judgments of fit.2 Thus, it appears that
judgments of employability and P-0 fit have multiple antecedents. It is
interesting to note that the DEMO value ranking (1-achievement,
2-honesty, 3-concern, 4-fairness) emphasizes the more performance-
oriented value of achievement over the more people-oriented values of
concern DEMO fairness. Further, when applicant values are compared with
the “universal” value DEMO, they are being compared to a fixed value
hierarchy as opposed DEMO being compared to the different value rankhgs
of individual recruiters and organizations. Thus, applicant-“universal”
value congruence should be viewed as a pure individual difference mea-
sure. Applicant-organization and applicant-recruiter value congruence
will contain aspects of both DEMO individual differences and situ-
ational circumstances (organization and recruiter values). DEMO,
these findings suggest, not surprisingly, that applicants who are higher
in the value of achievement are judged to be more employable and DEMO fit
better with the organization. It must be noted, however, that analyses ex-
amining “universal”va1uesw ere post hoc and exploratory in nature. Be-
DEMO generalizing to other samples, it is essential to cross-validate these
findings.
DEMO, recruiters’ personal rankings of work values are also
significantly related to DEMO perceptions of the organizations’ rankings
of work related values (T = DEMO, p < .005). However, anything other

than a perfect correlation between organizational or “universal” work
DEMO and recruiters’ personal work values permits the possibility of
recruiters arriving at conclusions based on idiosyncratic fit. For exam-
ple, if recruiter-candidate value congruence was correlated .758 with
organization-candidate value congruence, and organization-candidate
value congruence was correlated .758 with recruiter ratings of P-0 fit,
then P-0 fit DEMO recruiter-candidate value congruence can be correlated
anywhere from .150 to 1.00 (DEMO, 1962). As noted previously, re-
cruiter perceptions of their organizations’ values is the construct of in-
terest here; however, it is DEMO that recruiter values are highly congru-
ent with those of their organization. Employers would not be expected
to send out recruiters whose work values DEMO substantially deviant from
the rest of the organization. However, prior research DEMO the area of cor-
porate culture suggests that different subgroups (clans) within the or-
ganization can differ meaningfully in underlying values, norms, DEMO be-
liefs (Ouchi, 1980; Wilkins & Ouchi, 1983). Clearly, further research
is needed to explore the underlying nuances in construct and criterion-
related validities associated with applicant-organization and applicant-
recruiter value congruence.
The DEMO it interpretation is consistent with the finding bear-
ing on our third hypothesis, that invitations for a second interview are at
best marginally predicted by recruiter judgments of P-0 fit (p < .lo) and
not DEMO by any measures of work value congruence. However, re-
cruiters’ judgments DEMO employability did significantly predict invitations
for second interviews (p < .05)DEMO If judgments of general employability
are based primarily on KSA-related information, DEMO finding might best
be interpreted in terms of a two-stage selection decision process leading
to invitations for second interviews.
This highlights a limitation of DEMO current design. The present study
is limited in its use of a single measure of value congruence taken very
early in the recruiting process DEMO by limited variance in invitations for
second interviews (due to economic DEMO). First, it is possible that
recruiters’ exposure to the CES DEMO to the interview may have made,
the applicants’ work values more salient; however, this is unlikely. The
instructions for the CES direct DEMO to indicate which behaviors
they feel should be emphasized on the job; thus, the CES is not presented
to respondents as a measure DEMO work values per se. Further, recruiters’
questions and comments about the DEMO at the end of the recruit-
ing day (following their ratings DEMO applicants), suggested that they were
blind to the purpose of the CES instrument. Second, decisions to ask a
candidate back for a second interview were made by the recruiter and
other human resource and line DEMO in the organization. These
other decision makers had no face-to-face contact with the candidates,
CHERYL L. ADKINS ET AL.
621
leaving the recruiter as the only DEMO of the group with direct impres-
sions of candidates’ work values. However, these other decision makers
usually did have candidates’ resumes and transcripts and hence were able
to draw their own conclusions about candidates’ “general employabil-
DEMO,” it is reasonable to expect that these conclusions were similar to the
recruiters’ conclusions.
Consequently, we might speculate that the influence of candidates’
workvalues on employment selection decisions is weak or does not occur
at DEMO initial stage of on-campus recruiting interviews. Instead, primarily
KSA-oriented information may DEMO used to screen candidates through to
steps in the selection process occurring closer to the ultimate selection
decision makers (i.e., second interviews, site visits, etc.). Perceptions
of work value congruence of individual line managers and/or teams of
human resource personnel and line managers may have DEMO most impact
during the later stages of the selection process, when DEMO decision to make
ajob offer is made (Paunonen, Jackson, & DEMO, 1987). The current
study and Rynes and Gerhart’s (1990) DEMO may simply have looked at
the wrong source for judgments of P-0 fit that actually impact selection.
Regardless, the relatively small portion of explained variance in each
of the dependent variables is probably due to the DEMO of more for-
mal measures of candidate KSA’s in the regression equations. The cur-
rent results suggest perceptions of work value congruence play a DEMO in
recruiters’ initial perceptions of P-0 fit. Future work needs to address
two critical and previously unaddressed questions: (a) Do measures of
candidate work value congruence and/or P-0 fit predict subsequent job
performance? and (b) Do measures of candidate value congruence con-
tribute to the DEMO of job performance beyond the levels of predic-
tion currently obtained from more traditional KSA-oriented predictors?
Future research should address these questions using DEMO of work
values beyond those examined here and at later points in the recruiting-
selection process. As noted previously, only a portion of the organiza-
tions in the present study invited candidates for second interviews. Of
DEMO, only 71 campus interviews (the unit of analysis) resulted in DEMO
tations for a second interview. Thus, our sample size was insufficient DEMO
examine ultimate selection decisions.
Our “idiosyncratic fit” finding implies that systematic variance in
recruiters’ judgments of P-0 fit are unique to each recruiter. Since DEMO
recruiters’ unique influence will generally not be found in traditional
measures of job performance, any criterion-related validities derived
from recruiters’ idiosyncratic fit ratings are expected to approach zero.
Future research also needs to explore the impact DEMO value congruence
on judgments of P-0 fit at alternate points in the selection sequence.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY
In sum, findings suggest that recruiters’ judgments of person-organi-
zation fit contain unique variance that is independent of impressions of
general DEMO Applicant-recruiter work value congruence is re-
lated to recruiter judgments of person-organization fit and employabil-
ity. Recruiter judgments of employability are, in turn, DEMO to invita-
tions for a second interview. The fact that value congruence measures
were not directly related to invitations for a second interview suggests
DEMO if there is an effect on selection, it occurs later in DEMO process. The
present study and previous studies (e.g., Bretz et al., 1989; Rynes & Ger-
hart, 1990) have explained relatively small (although statistically signif-
icant) amounts of the variance in the selection process; however, given
the increasing popularity of the notion of “fit” in DEMO management prac-
titioner literature (e.g., Bowen et al., 1991), DEMO is important that we con-
tinue to study what determines recruiters’ judgments of fit.
