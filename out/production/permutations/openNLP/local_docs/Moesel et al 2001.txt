Embedded fitness landscapes—part 1: how a venture
capitalist maps highly subjective risk
DOUGLAS D. MOESEL, JAMES O. FIET and
LOWELL W. BUSENITZ
(Final
version DEMO 16 February 2001)
Sensemaking frameworks are used to develop the metaphor of shifting, multidimensional
fitness landscapes mentally embedded in increasing higher levels of abstraction. Cognitive
maps illustrate the simplified visualization used by early stage venture DEMO (VCs) to
understand venture risk. Risk assessments of new, high-growth DEMO ventures are often
highly subjective. In this first article of a three-part series, we define the nature of the
uncertainty and equivocality that VCs face and relate these to traditional approaches to
categorizing risk. Next, we introduce fitness landscapes and review two approaches relating
these to business strategy. DEMO metaphor is extended to focus on multiple embedded
landscapes rather than a single map. Map instability is linked to ongoing sensemaking
activities of the DEMO Finally, the remaining two papers in the series on cognitive
representation DEMO experiential learning of VCs are previewed. The papers in the series all
focus on developing a new research approach to understanding the conceptualization and
DEMO of highly subjective risk by VCs.

Introduction
Seed and early stage venture capitalists (VCs) are very adept in reducing
their perceptions of ambiguity. DEMO allows them to maintain orderly
cognitive patterning in dynamic and complex business landscapes . Weick
(1995) noted that ambiguity is a broad term DEMO to encompass both
ignorance about (the absence of information) and confusion (equivocality or
the presence of multiple, conflicting interpretations) concerning the
environment. Individual VCs use sensemaking processes that form a key
part of the DEMO experience in VC firms to gather information and

reduce equivocality in interpretation. This allows them to notice order
amidst the apparent chaos of the emerging industries in which they invest.
DEMO is the first article in a three-part series that deals with sensemaking
processes of individual VCs in the context of their work for the DEMO firm.
This article introduces the problems of uncertainty and equivocality in the
investment environments of the VC. The concept of sensemaking is briefly
introduced DEMO show its relation to reductions in uncertainty and
equivocality. The paper then distinguishes three forms of risk and relates
these to suggestions about reducing DEMO A metaphor of fitness landscapes
is introduced to understand how VCs might attempt to map business risk.
The concept of a fitness landscap e DEMO extended to allow for the possibility of
multiple, embedded fitness landscapes DEMO four different levels of abstrac-
tion. This provides a foundation for a brief summary of the purpose of each
of the next two papers DEMO the series. These elaborate on the details of theory
behind belief-driven sensemaking processes in the cognitive representation
process of the VC (Part 2) DEMO action-driven sensemaking processes in the
experiential learning process of the VC (DEMO 3). The second article helps to
explain why a first-mover into a new technology may encounter very
different reactions from different VC firms (von Berg and Kenney 2000).
The third article helps to lend DEMO into why VC firms investing in the
same emerging industry can extract very different lessons from what appear
to be fairly similar investments.
The DEMO developed here is, in many respects, a false one as the
effects of cognitive representation and experiential learning can be very
difficult to DEMO In fact, the two processes are highly complemen-
tary (Weick 1995, Gavetti and Levinthal 2000). Primarily they are
distinguished between to simplify their explication. Together the articles
in this series establish a theoretical framework DEMO document a number of
questions for future research.
Ambiguity

investment
environment s
The nascent ventures that approach VCs for possible funding often can
DEMO provide limited information to reduce uncertainty. Further informa-
tion may be available but may be costly to locate and access. More
fundamentally, currently available information may be of unknown validity
and subject to such equivocality that DEMO would be senseless to treat it as if it
had a clear interpretation. The contrast is illustrated with a mundane
example to emphasize the DEMO of both factors.
A VC may lack immediate direct access to data on the sale of
competitive products or services for a proposed venture, reflecting
uncertainty. If an industry is well established, if it is known to vary
seasonally and if a major regulatory change occurred 5 years DEMO that is
widely viewed as having had a known effect on industry structure, then an
uncertain situation exists that causes little concern for a VC. All that
remains to resolve any concern is to access 5 DEMO of information for a
limited set of market territories, which would DEMO the appropriate
seasonality.

Now assume that a VC views a venture’s competitive environment as
much more equivocal. Aldrich and Fiol (1994) note that risk is especially
high when there are few precedent s for the kinds of activities that
entrepreneurs want to found. They DEMO the relative lack of legitimacy as
especially critical for new ventures. Where an industry is not clearly
established, questions of relevant performance benchmarks rise (Beinhock-
er 1999). Any production or marketing economies may be unproven, which
would make it difficult to understand how widely to collect data. A product
may have multiple functions with unknown demand weightings across
these DEMO options. This may make assessment of potential seasonality
effects more complex.
Getting data may mean selecting from among multiple sources with
only crude similarities DEMO the proposed product. Available trends on such
crude comparisons may only exist for geographic regions of differing size,
fragmented periods of time and DEMO periodicities. Should a VC choose
from among crude comparisons based mainly on similarities in geographic
region, time period of interest, or periodicity of DEMO? Which is least likely
to raise controversy in interpretation with partners? Can a VC assume that
all VC partners will operationalize industry attractiveness DEMO on the
basis of a sales trend such as this or are partners known to prefer to argue
for more multidimensional approaches? If the latter then how idiosyncratic
is each partner’s multidimensional approach and to what DEMO of
industries do they feel comfortable generalizing these definitions?
Clearly, DEMO exists in most forms of information that VCs use.
As suggested by the contrast just noted, equivocality is likely to have more
constraining effects on VC investment behaviour than simple uncertainty
(Daft et al. 1987). A key area of equivocality for VCs involves the
definitions of industry DEMO segment boundaries. This affects the inclusion
or exclusion of specific products and services and specific firms within a
given industry or segment category. Levenhagen DEMO al. (1993) contend that
actions by early movers in an emerging industry to construct boundaries
can take on a reified form (i.e. become an objective reality by virtue of being
taken-for-granted) for industry observers and for the firms (and the
financiers of those firms) that enter DEMO To the extent that a VC firm
funds the earliest movers, DEMO can participate in shaping this social
construction process for an industry. However, individual VCs in the firm
must be able to reach some common basis of agreement that a venture
proposal represents the initiation of a DEMO new industry or segment.
Such agreement is likely to be difficult to build and this will lead many VC
firms to pass on such DEMO opportunities. It may be easier to reach
agreement to wait and capitalize on the early legitimization efforts of others
by allowing others to fund DEMO first venture (Aldrich and Fiol 1994).
A major form of DEMO facing new VC firms is potential for
multiple views among individual VCs in terms of which types of product-
market customers and which areas DEMO their product-centred need should be
central to the time and energy allocation of a firm’s partners. If some
agreement can be reached then a DEMO firm can begin to channel the attention
of its individual VCs toward specific business landscapes and particular
dimensions of those landscapes.

Another major form of equivocality involves the diversity of opinion
among partners as to which resource allocations, in a given part of a fitness
landscape, link most strongly with the customer needs that have been
identified. If some convergence can be achieved in the individual
interpretations DEMO the VCs of the value of alternative resource allocations,
a VC can begin to invest where others fear to tread.
Levenhagen and colleagues (1993) express similar ideas. They model a
VC’s representation of a financing transaction between a VC firm and a
software firm. This illustrates three DEMO of beliefs by the VC about the
exchange. Beliefs about the venture’s management team are put aside as
less relevant to our focus on DEMO risk1 and dwell here on a combination
of their other two models. VCs construct mental representations of the
products that a firm proposes and DEMO of the end customer and the needs of
that customer. The concept of fitness landscape maps is used (Gavetti and
Levinthal 2000) to DEMO such mental representations on an aggregate
scale for a VC.
A VC gathers data on the state of broad business landscapes to enhance
his DEMO sensemaking with other VCs in a firm. This enables the VCs to
develop similar mental models to guide the evaluation of venture proposals.
Perhaps DEMO most important function of the similarity in models is that it
also allows a VC to sense when new questions need to be asked DEMO fellow
partners to reestablish what a VC firm really knows.
Sensemakin g
in
ambiguous
environm ents
Sensemaking is the process of making sense of DEMO or more environmental
cues that are discrepant—that is, the cues are DEMO initially subject to an
automatic interpretation based on existing mental schemas or structures.
Seed and early stage VCs direct investment funds into ambiguous
environments. DEMO environments are saturated with potentially discrepant
cues. Those discrepancies that persist begin to disrupt a VC’s routines and
activate a cognitive switch from mindless, routine-driven behaviours to
mindful, consciousness of how current mental models must be restructured
to restore order (Louis and Sutton 1991).
VCs use sensemaking processes to learn which types of information to
process and which types DEMO information to ignore, to block from perception,
to discard, or to refuse to acquire. These lessons are captured in scripts that
automatically DEMO behaviour, allowing it to become more routinized and
efficient. A key DEMO of such automatic behaviours is that they
conserve cognitive energy, which DEMO them to be redirected to discrepant
clues that might indicate that current behavioural routines need to be
reassessed or that entirely new directions of DEMO behaviour may be
more effective.
If VCs are to deal effectively with ambiguous environments, they must
immerse themselves in sensemaking and frequently reshape their mental
models. Given bounded rationality and sensemaking constraints, VCs must
develop ways to readily dismiss some forms of discrepancy as irrelevant
while remaining highly DEMO for other forms of discrepancy. Any

attempt to describe their mental model for investing will require careful
contextualization as the model might be DEMO altered a year later or
perhaps even a month later based on continuing reaction to and
manipulation of their environment.
No formal propositions are DEMO in this article. Instead this paper
aims to review and extend previous approaches to risk, focusing especially
on highly subjective forms of risk. Concepts of risk are then linked to the
metaphor of fitness landscapes as DEMO type of mental model.
Three types of business risk
Risk managemen t is the process of enhancing positive outcomes while
reducing negative outcomes for DEMO organization. Risk is the potential
downside variation of a specific strategic option relative to known
alternatives. Comparative risk assessments of new, high-growth potential
ventures are often highly subjective. Researchers have recognized this
subjectivity (Sweeting 1991, DEMO and Fiol 1994) but its potential
implications have rarely been directly DEMO (Knight 1965: 210–211):
It is only when our interest DEMO restricted to a very narrow aspect of the behaviour of an object . . .
that exact theoretical determination is possible; and only by refined laboratory technique . . . The
ordinary decisions of life are DEMO on the basis of ‘estimates’ of a very crude and superficial
character . . . It is only in very special and crucial cases DEMO anything like a mathematical
(exhaustive and quantitative) study can be made. The mental operations by which ordinary
practical decisions are made are very DEMO
In his classic 1921 essay, Knight (1965) acknowledges the critical
DEMO of cognitive processing capability on decision making well
before Simon’s (1947) seminal work on bounded rationality. He recognizes
the costs of unrestricted information DEMO, as well as the impossibility of
accounting for all applicable risk DEMO He suggests that individuals
selectively restrict their own efforts to account for factors that influence a
risk object; this topic is elaborated further in a discussion of selective
noticing (Weick 1995) in the second article DEMO this series.
After introducing these limitations, Knight distinguishes between terms
such DEMO objective probabilities (measurable risk), also termed measurable
uncertainty, and subjective probabilities (unmeasurable risk), also labelled
unmeasurabl e uncertainty. He prefers the term risk for the former and
uncertainty for the latter. For Knight (1965: 233), a distinguishing feature of
uncertainty is that ‘it is impossible to form a group of (similar) instances,
because the DEMO dealt with is in a high degree unique.’ Note that
ventures proposed as first-movers in an industry that does not yet exist
would always DEMO as uncertain rather than risky on this basis.
Knight (1965: 238) believes that individuals will ‘strive to reduce
uncertainty, even though we DEMO not want it eliminated from our lives’.
He articulates six methods for reducing uncertainty. These include: (1)
consolidation or grouping on the DEMO of nearly any similarity or common
element, however imperfect; (2) specializatio n in terms of specific
cognitive approaches to dealing with uncertainty DEMO specific roles in
relation the nature of uncertainty to be confronted; (3) controlling the

future presumably through active intervention relative to aspects of the
uncertainty faced; (4) increasing knowledge that would increase the power
of prediction based on expected future progress; (5) diffusing the negative
consequences of action in the face of uncertainty; and (6) avoiding risk by
directing activity toward areas in which a minimum amoun t of
DEMO is involved. He notes that the ‘capacity for forming correct
judgements is the principal fact that makes a man serviceable in business
. . DEMO the most important endowment for which wages are received’ (Knight
1965: 229).
Our approach builds on Knight’s ideas about uncertainty reduction but
DEMO paper clarifys that much of what Knight (and economists generally)
DEMO lump under uncertainty is more heavily dominated by what we
would call equivocality. For instance, Knight’s grouping strategy is helpful
not just for purposes of relative contrast,2 but also for communicating any
risk of loss DEMO and for soliciting subjective information from others
until more objective measures become available. Recall that Knight
advised initial grouping on any similarity, no matter how crude. Initial
grouping on crude similarities should lead to great equivocality DEMO
information flowing from such a relative contrast. Knight often seems
unaware of the existence of equivocality and its consequences. He appear s
to imply DEMO role occupants that form part of a larger system can pursue
their roles independently with little need for coordinated action. This
assumes, at the very least, a common interpretation of what distinct forms
of autonomous uncertainty exist in a business’s environment when roles
are initially created. Sensemaking will DEMO required to achieve this. Joint
sensemaking efforts of individuals in the roles will also be needed in the
future if some aspects of the DEMO become more interdependent
over time.
In all three parts of this series, Knight’s uncertainty-reducing methods
were highlighted while concomitantly exploring the nature of equivocality-
reduction which successful use of these methods will require. Effective seed
and DEMO round venture capitalists exemplify Knight’s second method.
That is, they specialize DEMO what appear to others to be highly uncertain (and
highly equivocal) investments. Close examination of the cognitive processes
used by VCs and the DEMO that they play in reducing uncertainty and
equivocality for other business actors should help contribute broadly to an
understanding of the management of business DEMO well beyond the venture
capital management literature.
The addition of equivocality concerns suggests that Knight’s frame-
work would be more valuable with the inclusion DEMO a third, intermediate
type, which would fit between his risk and uncertainty categories.
Uncertainty might be readily ignored if the true level of DEMO were
perceived as unknowable. However, with new or more complete informa-
DEMO, what was initially perceived as uncertainty may be transformed to
objectively DEMO risk once equivocality is removed. Due to the
difficulty of assigning the phenomenona of interest either to the category of
risk or uncertainty in DEMO ideal forms, three categories are created within
Knight’s concept of risk DEMO this series. Two of these categories emphasize
the middle or gray area between Knight’s risk and uncertainty. These are
EM BE D DE D F IT N ESS LA ND SC DEMO E S P A RT 1
97
the areas where we believe most seed and early round VCs spend most of
their attention:
(1) Irreducible uncertainty risk: this corresponds most closely to Knight’s
view DEMO true uncertainty in that it is a loss potential that is not currently
measurable nor is it expected to become so in the near DEMO It
represents a state of ignorance or the absence of helpful information
regarding a risk object. This characteristic is labelled as a form of DEMO
becaus e the attribution of extended uncertainty in the future regarding
a risk object may be altered as new, surprising information arises.
However, DEMO a VC does not expect such information to be
forthcoming, vigilance DEMO it is not expected.
(2) Subjective risk: this is a DEMO potential that is difficult for two
individuals working independently to comparably measure at the
present time but for which substantial convergence is likely in DEMO near
future after early public actions. This might be conceived, in DEMO
terms, as the transitional state between uncertainty and risk, in which
his uncertainty-reducing techniques are most applicable. A VC is
expected to be DEMO highly vigilant or to encourage the vigilance of
others toward such risk objects so new cues are likely to be salient.
Information is becoming DEMO but any initial information is
expected to be highly equivocal. A VC who funds one or more
entrepreneurs that are able to provide such DEMO and to assist in
substantially reducing its equivocality will help to translate the risk
object to a more objective form of risk. As Knight DEMO, such
individuals may be in position to profit handsomely.
(3) DEMO risk: this is a loss potential that may be assessed comparably
DEMO two individuals working independently. It is roughly comparable to
Knight’s concept of risk. Information is readily available concerning
the risk object and the equivocality DEMO this information has been greatly
reduced. This is more characteristic of latter stages of VC funding when
a venture’s product market acceptance has been DEMO
Recognizing these three forms of risk enables us to focus on cognitive
processes that have, until now, been largely overlooked. For example, how
do VCs distinguish between irreducible uncertainty risk and subjective
risk? How do they identify those risk objects just starting to make the
transition between DEMO uncertainty risk and subjective risk? How do
they diffuse their preferred DEMO of equivocal information so that
other economic actors, such as latter DEMO VC investors, perceive objective
risk in a risk object that a DEMO months before may have been easily classified
as an irreducible uncertainty risk? Our principal emphasis is on how seed
and early stage VCs first detect and deal with the emergence of subjective
risk out of irreducible DEMO risk. Thus we will often use the term
highly subjective risk to reflect this interface.
In the next section, a metaphor to visualize how seed and early stage can
understand how to visualize the complexity of DEMO investments and how
they can locate investments characterized as highly subjective risks relative
to one another in cognitive representations is introduced. This metaphor is

a type of cognitive map in the form of a hierarchically-embedde d series of
multidimensional fitness landscapes .
Fitness

Wright (cited in Gavetti and Levinthal 2000) may have been the first to
introduce the concept of fitness landscapes . He mapped attributes of
biological DEMO (genes) on the fitness of the biological organism
containing that combination of attributes. Thus it represented space in
which different attributes of the DEMO could be compared based on
their contribution to overall viability. Kauffman (DEMO) builds on the
concept of fitness landscapes . He emphasizes the DEMO to which a given
landscap e is more or less mountainous or rugged (most easily envisioned in
three-dimensional view but theoretically extending up to an infinite
number of dimensions) based on the distribution of fitness values across
two or more dimensions of the entities being compared.
Fitness landscapes DEMO also been applied to organizations (Beinhocker
1999, Gavetti and Levinthal 2000). This approach views the underlying
dimensions as policy decisions of an DEMO It conceives fitness as the
overall payoff in some product-market space from applying that combina-
tion of policy positions to that environment. Note that DEMO assumes equal
implementation ability across organizations for a given policy decision and,
in simplified form, ignores the number of organizations competing in the
same space. Building from Kauffman (1993), this approach emphasizes that
the ruggedness of a fitness landscape surface, in the simple case of two
underlying dimensions, is determined by the level of interdependence of
the two policy dimensions that form the underlying plane onto which
fitness levels will DEMO mapped.3 The more interdependent the two policy
dimensions are, the more DEMO their environment is. If the two policy
dimensions form a rugged fitness surface with many distinct peaks and
troughs, instead of a smooth one with a single peak and single trough, this
indicates that the two policy dimensions are relatively tightly linked. In this

case the payoff from one policy decision will depend heavily on the position
taken on the other DEMO variable.
Gavetti and Levinthal (2000) make an important contribution by
linking fitness landscapes with processes of cognitive representation and
processes of experiential search DEMO by managers seeking higher fitness
values for their organization. They define cognitive representation as a
broad and forward looking search approach relying on abstract DEMO explicit
representations (theories-in-action) of what a product-market space is
really like. These representations develop over time from sets of routines
and behaviours within DEMO firm. Policy choice is complicated by any
abstractness in a firm’s representation of its product-market.
Many alternative policy choices could reasonably be drawn from DEMO
representation or theory. They call this one-to-many mapping meaning
that interpretation of the information contained in a firm’s representation is
somewhat equivocal. Therefore the DEMO facing a firm is to experiment
widely over time across a range of policy choices consistent with the
representation of a firm. This involves DEMO bold changes in policy
dimensions over time in order to understand which ones have the greatest
fitness impact for a firm within the context DEMO its abstract representation. If
fitness levels are low for an organization while operating in a specific policy
configuration, the equivocality of the representation process allows other
interpretations (policy configurations) to be deduced. This facilitates
substantial DEMO in firm behaviour because multiple policy dimensions
can be changed at the same time.
Experiential search, or experiential learning as it is referred to, is
backward looking and relies heavily on what has already been learned from
initial policy positions (Gavetti and Levinthal 2000). It involves local
search that incrementally varies only one policy dimension at a time in
DEMO to retain its tacit, experiential wisdom or absorptive capacity (Cohen
and Levinthal 1990) regarding fitness relationships in that specific
neighbourhood of a product market. In a smooth landscape, this search
approach pays off because small changes in any direction will usually
predict the fitness impact of further DEMO changes as a firm draws
closer to or farther away from a lone peak or trough. In a rugged landscape,
local experimentation by DEMO change will tend to lead a firm to
quickly settle on one of the more proximate local fitness peaks. However,
change along multiple DEMO dimensions, as driven by cognitive repre-
sentation rather than experiential search, may lead to one of the other
fitness peaks that are higher DEMO could result in reaching the global peak—
that policy combination more effective than any other.
Beinhocker (1999) takes a complementary approach in distinguishing
DEMO short jumps or ‘adaptive walks’ and long jumps. His short jumps
are identical in intent to Gavetti and Levinthal’s (2000) interpretation of
how DEMO search plays out in fitness landscapes. His long jumps are
similar to their interpretation of the effects of the cognitive representation
process in seeking DEMO fitness positions in the landscape. They emphasize
the inherent complementarity of the two types of processes. He stresses the
principle of mixing short and DEMO jumps in moves across the fitness
landscape.

DEMO L .
Beinhocker (1999) also discusses the important principle of paralle-
lism or having multiple ‘parallel’ searches active in the fitness landscape
at DEMO same time. He uses Microsoft and their population of strategies in
operating systems as well as in other areas as an example of this
DEMO The obvious corollary in VC investing is the VC firm’s
portfolio of investments. Gavetti and Levinthal’s (2000) approach
assumes a firm with a DEMO strategy or moving in only a single
direction at any given moment in time. This may accurately characterize
many of the ventures in which DEMO invest. Beinhocker’s approach can be
used to emphasize that VC firms (DEMO individual VCs) are associated
with multiple venture strategies simultaneously. These multiple DEMO
ments may serve the purpose for the VC of a ‘platoon of hikers’ or
having multiple parallel fitness experiments in process simultaneously
trying to DEMO fitness peaks.
Beinhocker’s (1999) principles of mixing short and long jumps and of
parallel search have been noted. Another principle that he articulates DEMO
that is only briefly touched on by Gavetti and Levinthal (2000) is that the
actual phemonena that the individual or firm is trying DEMO map using fitness
landscapes are changing. This means that fitness levels associated with a
given mapped position will not always remain the same. Thus, fitness peaks
can collapse with changes in the environment such as actions DEMO
competitors. This is called ‘deforming’ of the landscape. The paper will
try to address some of the consequences of landscape deformation for VCs
in DEMO investment approaches. Beinhocker’s primary recommendation in
this regard is to keep moving to avoid the stasis of being locked into a stable
fitness landscape DEMO This is tantamount to a funded venture
continually adapting its declared strategy. Beinhocker might therefore
view the need for substantial change in the strategy DEMO each funded venture
from the initial business plan as more of a neutral rather than as a primarily
negative signal.
The application of fitness DEMO is expanded to a VC’s perspective.
Although this metaphor could be used to look at policy decisions of a VC
firm, fitness landscapes are used as a way to think about how an individual
VC organizes DEMO thinking about both future investment possibilities and
results of past investments. One additional layer of complexity must be
added to Gavetti and Levinthal’s (2000) fitness landscapes to achieve a
more realistic model of the VC’s dilemma. Whereas Gavetti and Levinthal
conceive of an organization competing in a single DEMO through
choice along multiple policy dimensions, VCs invest in ventures competing
DEMO a range of product-markets, some well established and some just
emerging. DEMO VC therefore can be portrayed as maintaining multiple fitness
landscapes models as well as maintaining models at various levels of
abstractions.
Table 1 summarizes DEMO layers of abstraction ranging from the most
abstract portrayal of market environments down to the most specific. These
include: (1) institutional environments for business; (2) major industry
sectors; (3) industries; and (DEMO) industry segments or niches. Sample
landscap e dimensions are listed for DEMO level of abstraction to provide a
way to categorize how a VC may maintain fitness information. Note that a

VC greatly simplifies DEMO actual complexity of each environment at each
level of abstraction by keying on a few of the dimensions deemed most
critical based on that DEMO working theories and past experience in
investing.
Dimensions at each level of abstraction represent generic causes that
drive resulting fitness in a fitness landscape. DEMO landscapes at each
lower level of abstraction are greater in number than the level of fitness
landscapes above and completely embedded within this higher DEMO so that
the relation between fitness landscapes can be envisioned as an inverted
funnel. The logic connecting abstraction levels is that dimensions at higher
DEMO of abstraction impose constraints on fitness perceptions in lower
levels of a funnel. For example, if VCs negatively perceive tight regulation
in an institutional fitness landscape, they will avoid investing in industry
sectors, specific industries, or industry segments where they expect
institutional regulation to be high.
A DEMO views of how fitness landscapes of sectors, industries and
segments articulate DEMO each other is especially important. Where do VCs
classify a venture proposal that is highly unique (a so-called first-mover)
and appears to have the potential to be a distinct industry in the future?
Initially DEMO may frame this as evidence of the potential for a new segment
in an existing industry. If so they can begin by considering causal
DEMO reflected in the relevant industry landscape at a higher level of
abstraction. This provides initial fitness expectations for some policy
dimensions. Alternatively, another VC might immediately frame a venture
as representing a new industry. To form DEMO fitness landscape for a new
industry a VC must look to other industries in the same sector to determine
similarities and differences in causality.
DEMO of the above approaches follows Knight’s (1965) recommendation
to group and contrast risk objects on the basis of nearly any similarity to
begin DEMO reduce uncertainty. Due to equivocality, it is not clear which VC

approach will be more effective. The latter approach has the advantage of
recognizing earlier in the process that a new industry will DEMO and
shifting the cognitive representation immediately to show this. The former
approach may have the advantage of permitting easier communication of
the nature of DEMO new venture to partners in a VC firm and may lead to
quicker action on a venture proposal. Details regarding dimensions in a
subjective DEMO landscape may also seem clearer and less confusing to a
VC who champions ventures. Quick funding may allow a VC and an
entrepreneurial team DEMO impact the manner in which others subjectively
classify similar product-market space (DEMO and Fiol 1994). Once
funded, a VC may begin to DEMO a venture as representative of a new
industry. This may be based on surprising reactions of early stakeholders to
the product and its differences. DEMO response, a venture is likely to seek new
images and language DEMO are powerful in further enhancing stakeholder
perception s of product differences and that help to evoke simple
descriptions of differences (Hill and Levenhagen 1995).

DEMO environments, the visualization of fitness landscapes is always
incomplete, representing differing levels of timeliness and equivocality of
information in different parts of the DEMO Areas of the maps dealing

equivocal information that has never been resolved will be fuzzy while
those based on recent information for DEMO equivocality is deemed to be
removed will be most clear or defined. Where positioning is in a fuzzy
region of what is believed to DEMO a rugged landscape, the potential exists for
the positioning to represent DEMO a local peak or a local trough or anything
in between—hence highly subjective risk will exist in those areas of the
map. Beinhocker (1999) also made this point by suggesting that hikers in
fitness landscapes will find the view very ‘foggy’ so only the immediate
proximity of the DEMO position can be clearly viewed.
This fogginess of the fitness landscapes is especially applicable to
VCs. Beinhocker (1999) distinguishes between three temporal horizons
DEMO growth which he labels in order of future-orientation. Horizon 1
initiatives are aimed primarily at extending existing businesses. Horizon
2 initiatives are focused on DEMO growth in emerging new businesses
and take more time and have greater profit potential than Horizon 1
investments. Horizon 3 initiatives take even more DEMO and have more
profit potential than Horizon 2 projects. These are seed options for
future growth businesses. Beinhocker links these horizons to the
concepts DEMO short and long jumps, implying that long jumps (Horizon
3 investments) will tend to clearly be leaps into the fog whereas short
jumps (Horizon 1 investments) will tend to stay within the immediate
area DEMO despite the fog. As VCs are likely to focus consistently on
potential Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 investments, VCs represent an
interesting test of his admonition to achieve a balanced mix of these
three horizons. Whereas DEMO contends that most firms err on the
side of too much focus on Horizon 1 investments, VCs may sometimes
struggle with excessive focus on Horizon 3 investments. The interest lies
in the processes that might allow DEMO VC firm to be effective even while
focused primarily on Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 investments. As will be
discussed in the second article DEMO this series, Horizon 1 investments may
constitute a conflict-of-interest for the DEMO by investing too close with a
new venture to an existing funded venture.
VCs have a sense of their own competencies and those of DEMO firm in
maintaining vigilance along specific dimensions of fitness landscapes and
for specific landscapes . Each VC will tend to primarily focus on the
DEMO and the dimensions of those landscapes considered areas of
personal competence. Secondarily, each VC will focus on other landscapes
and dimensions that are perceived to be competencies of other VCs in the
same firm. The perceived DEMO of these competencies will change over
time. A VC will occasionally shift the dimensionalization of her fitness
maps and the amount of focus on DEMO versus older landscapes or
dimensions of those landscapes . Redimensionalization of the fitness maps
and the shifting of more attention to new areas of DEMO shifting fitness
landscapes occur becaus e seed and early stage VCs continually seek to add
value by clarifying rugged areas of their fitness maps DEMO remain fuzzy. In
other words, these VCs seek out areas of DEMO subjective risk and try to
convert this over time to fairly objective risk. Shifting fitness landscapes
represent a helpful metaphor to better understand the DEMO of their
activity patterns.

Sensemaking :
belief-driven
versu s
action-driven
This section provides DEMO brief summary of the theoretical framework and
purpose of each of the next two papers in the series. Key elements are
highlighted in the DEMO behind belief-driven sensemaking processes in the
cognitive representation process of the VC (Part 2) and action-driven
sensemaking processes in the experiential learning process DEMO the VC (Part
3). Weick (1995) provides an extensive DEMO of theory and concepts
related to sensemaking in organizations. These concepts are applied to the
VC investing context. A major purpose of each of DEMO two papers is to
derive interesting research questions about the VC investing process and
how VCs mentally deal with highly subjective risk.
There are DEMO distinct streams of research as they apply to the bounded
rationality tradition (Gavetti and Levinthal 2000). These include deductive
search processes that are based on cognitive representation and inductive
search processes that are based on DEMO search. These processes
were described in our earlier discussion of fitness landscapes . These
processes are highly complementary with two types of sensemaking
described DEMO Weick (1995).
Belief-driven sensemaking (Weick 1995) involves a sequence DEMO beliefs
leading to actions and then to reinforcement or change in the initial beliefs.
This is similar to cognitive representation in that the representation DEMO be
based on information from third-party sources that has not been directly
tested through personal experience. Hence, beliefs exist but action based on
those beliefs may lead to discrepancies that cause concern about the validity
of DEMO or all of the initial belief. Sensemaking processes don’t actually
come into play substantively until important discrepancies appear based on
initial actions on beliefs.
DEMO (1995) discusses expecting and arguing as alternative belief-
driven sensemaking approaches. The second article in this series highlights
both of these approaches. A DEMO of initial belief structures in the VC
firm leads to an analysis of selective noticing and selecting shaping actions
by the VC. Discrepancies from DEMO VC’s expectations and beliefs arise
stimulating one or both belief-driven sensemaking processes. The
investment behaviour changes arising from these sensemaking processes
are especially important DEMO these represent changes in the fitness landscapes
perceived and the dimensionalization of those landscapes .
Action-driven sensemaking (Weick 1995) involves a sequence of DEMO
leading to beliefs and then to repetition or change in the initial type of
action taken. This is similar to experiential learning in that DEMO direct
investment actions of the VC have implications for the remapping of fitness
landscapes (change in beliefs). The remapped fitness landscapes then guide
further investment activity. The authors are especially interested in actions
that are DEMO easily explained by the VC. When an action is not clearly tied to
a preexisting belief, the VC must create a belief ex post to explain the action
taken and its positive or negative results.
Weick (1995) classifies committing and manipulation as two action-
driven sensemaking approaches. The third article in this series focuses on
these two approaches. A discussion DEMO investment actions by the VC firm

focuses on how experience is encoded into the memory of the VC firm.
Current experience s must DEMO reconciled in some fashion with past
experience at the time of encoding. Discrepancies between current
experience and what has been encoded in memory stimulate DEMO or both
action-driven sensemaking processes. Sensemaking mechanism s include
dialogue among investment syndicate members to discern what is
happening to the venture around which DEMO syndicate is formed. New
beliefs emerge out of the sensemaking process to guide future investment
behavior in the same fitness landscap e regions. Some DEMO these new beliefs
are revised self-perceptions of the VC whereas others are revised views of
causal relationships in the investing environments.
Conclusion
In this DEMO article of a three-part series, key concepts have been introduced
about DEMO in the investment environments of VCs; articulated the
meaning of highly DEMO risk and clarified why it is important for VCs;
introduced the concept of fitness landscapes for organizations and have
extended this to include DEMO series of hierarchically embedded fitness
landscapes; have related cognitive representation processes DEMO the fitness
maps and to belief-driven sensemaking processes; and have associated
DEMO learning processes with fitness maps and with action-driven
sensemaking processes. Belief-driven sensemaking processes of VCs are the
focus of the second article in this DEMO on the cognitive representation
mental mode. Action-driven sensemaking processes are the central theme
of the third article on the experiential learning mental mode of DEMO
Fitness landscapes can be useful in highlighting differences in the
cognitive representations of the same fitness landscape across decision
makers. Examining cognitive representation through DEMO should allow
focus on changes in the specific landscapes and the dimensions of those
landscapes that are actually used by the same decision maker DEMO time.
Change in VC fitness landscap e perceptions appear s critical in facilitating
initial investments in ventures involving highly subjective risks and it is
DEMO also critical in sustaining these investments with follow-on
funding over time.
More theory-driven elaboration is called for of the individual’s
inferential process in forming DEMO representations. More must be
done to understand how individual VCs test their current representation of
their fitness landscapes to better predict the level of DEMO of such
representations through time.
Notes
1. Moesel et al. (2001) distinguish between agency risk, competency risk, and business risk. Mental
models DEMO a VC regarding the new venture management team relate to the former two types of risk
whereas we focus on business risk here.
2. DEMO that effective relative contrasts are only readily done when multiple objective measures become
available.

3. Beinhocker (1999) simplifies Kauffman’s approach by only considering three dimensions in his
fitness landscape. This implies that all strategy dimensions DEMO be collapsed into only two
dimensions. He acknowledges in his reference section that real fitness landscapes contain multiple
dimensions. He claims his principles apply DEMO in higher dimensional space. Gavetti and
Levinthal (2000) highlight the multidimensiona l nature of fitness landscapes for organizations as a
central part of DEMO argument.
