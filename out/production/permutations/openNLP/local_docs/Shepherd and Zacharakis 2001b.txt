Speed to Initial
Public Offering DEMO
VC-Backed Companies
Dean A. Shepherd
Andrew Zacharakis
Venture capitalists realize returns on their investments when their portfolio companies
either go public (IPO) or DEMO acquired by a publicly traded company. Finance theory implies
that the sooner a particular return can be realized the higher the real" return to the investor.
We use an ecosystem perspective to investigate speed to Initial DEMO Offering. Findings
indicate that geography of the portfolio company matters, that DEMO high-tech portfolio com-
panies go public faster than do those in the computer-related sector, and that speed is
increased with the recent favorable IPO market but not at the same rate for all regions.
M.ost of DEMO research on venture capitalists" decision making has investigated how
venture capitalists (VCs) assess the future performance of a venture in terms of profit-
ability (Robinson. 1987: Roure & Keeley. 1990). survival (Gorman & Sahlman. 1989;
Shepherd. 1999). and performance in general (Kahn. 1987; Zacharakis & Meyer. 1998).
The implicit assumption in these .studies is that VCs believe their tlnn's performance is
dependent upon the performance DEMO its portfolio companies. This assumption appears
reasonable to the extent that there is likely to be a high correlation between the profit-
ability of DEMO portfolio company and the valuation of that venture at the time the VC
exits.' We argue that high valuations and subsequent high exit amounts provide an
incomplete picture of a VC s investment considerations.
Finance/economic DEMO proposes that time must also be a consideration for inves-
tors in order to obtain a clear assessment of the attractiveness of an investment (Douglas.
1992). The importance of time is evident in how VCs DEMO companies in which they
invest (Sahlman. 1988). VCs target a DEMO date (some number of years in the future)
and calculate DEMO expected return by evaluating the target venture's pro forma financials
(DEMO projected net income) and the price/earnings ratio that the firm DEMO generate at
that future time. The concern for harvesting sooner rather than later may be related to the
VC s present value of the DEMO return or issues of liquidity."
Bygrave and Timmons (1991) found that companies that went public within 34
months of the first round DEMO financing had a higher time-adjusted rate of return (287%
versus 158%)DEMO'* An initial public offering appears to offer the entrepreneurial company
a number of benefits, including legitimacy with stakeholders, access to debt capital
(Sutton & Benedetto, 1988), and a mechanism by which entrepreneurs can reacquire

negative profits yet high valuations.

entrepreneurs and investors.

control from investors (Black & Gilson, 1998). For investors, an IPO represents an exit
mechanism (Sutton & Benedetto, 1988). Sahlman (1990) documents that almost all of
the returns on venture capital funds are earned on companies that go public. Bygrave and
Timmons (1991, DEMO 159) note that "hot IPO markets are by far the most important cause
of peaks in venture capital returns."
While there have DEMO a number of studies that have investigated the company's
value at time of IPO (e.g.. Deeds, DeCarolis, & Coombs, 1997), DEMO has the speed with
which a company reaches its IPO been investigated. Therefore, an interesting and im-
portant research question becomes: "What explains a portfolio company's speed to
IPO?" This question has not DEMO much attention to date. This is surprising consid-
ering the importance of time in determining the attractiveness of an investment and the
importance of DEMO as exit mechanisms. A glance at the IPO market indicates that the
current attractive circumstances have not been evenly spread. Geographic regions, in-
dustry sectors, and periods in our history have developed differently. This paper utilizes
an ecosystem perspective to investigate the effects of geography, industry, and DEMO to
gain a deeper understanding of a company's speed to IPO.
ECOSYSTEM AND COMPANY DEVELOPMENT
According to Lucas (1993), the pace of technical progress varies over time and
space. A powerful explanation for these DEMO patterns of development is the unique
way a region's ecosystem combines to create the entrepreneurial momentum that spawns
increasing numbers of entrepreneurial start-ups DEMO drives their growth towards IPO. Just
as with a natural ecosystem, "growth and success can be attributed to the incessant
formation of a DEMO of specialized, diverse entities which feed off, support, and
interact DEMO one another" (Bahrami & Evans. 1995, p. 63).
Geograph DEMO
A number of models have been developed to explain regional development. The
view of economic geography proposed by Krugman (1991a, b) states that entrepreneurial
conditions within regions mutate and accelerate on the basis of what DEMO been done
before. In this view, regions develop and evolve because DEMO the pooling of demand for
specialized labor and the development of specialized intennediate goods industries
(Krugman, 1991a; Marshall, 1920). Knowledge also DEMO to be localized through
knowledge spillovers leading to interorganizational learning (Deeds DEMO al., 1997).
As entrepreneurs commercialize innovations within the region, they draw supporting
infrastructure to the region (i.e., other entrepreneurial conditions such DEMO financial sup-
port, commercial infrastructure, etc.). Economic success is a magnet for other engineers
and aspiring entrepreneurs. All combine to create a DEMO ecosystem that continues to
support innovation. Minniti (1999) asserts that regions with high entrepreneurship rates
are in a self-perpetuating equilibrium—and so are regions DEMO low entrepreneurial rates.
Specifically to IPOs, Deeds et al. (1997) DEMO that location has a significant relationship
to a biotechnology company's value at IPO.
Anecdotally, the Silicon Valley has led the way in the Internet boom, with such early
high fliers as Yahoo, Excite, etc. The boom in Silicon Valley has continued as more
recent Internet stars DEMO been bom and grown at a rapid pace. Bahrami and Evans
(DEMO) note that the keys to the success ofthe Silicon Valley ecosystem DEMO (1) venture
capital, (2) a talent pool of knowledgeable DEMO, (3) universities and research
institutions, (4) a professional service infrastructure, and (5) customers and lead users of
innovation.
60 . ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEOR
Y and PRACTICE
We propose that a strong ecosystem not only increases the birth rate DEMO new orga-
nizations but also provides a nurturing environment that allows it to develop faster and
therefore reach IPO earlier. However, with a lack of empirical evidence on differences
between regions in the degree that each DEMO a nurturing environment, we offer an
exploratory hypothesis based upon the DEMO evidence of regions with high birth
rates for new organizations. Thus,
HI : Geographical location within the U.S. affects the speed to IPO DEMO portfolio
companies that have gone public.
H2: U.S. portfolio companies based DEMO the West have greater speed to IPO than
portfolio companies from the Northeast, South, and Midwest.
Industry
Entrepreneurs (and VCs' investments) tend to cluster in attractive industries (e.g.,
biotech, Internet-related industries, etc.). While there is dispute amongst strategy schol-
ars over the relative DEMO of corporate strategy and industry on business unit perfor-
mance, there DEMO to be agreement that the type of industry has a significant effect on
venture performance (Rumelt, 1991; McGahan & Porter. 1997; Roquebert, Phillips, &
Westfall, 1996). Bygrave, Johnstone, Lewis, and DEMO (1998) investigated the differ-
ences between companies that had gone public from 1994 to 1997. They found that
certain high-tech industry segments were DEMO to IPO than others (i.e.. Internet <
Software < Hardware < Semiconductors) and relative returns also differed (i.e., Internet
5079^, Software, 125%, Hardware 148%, and Semiconductor 31%). The differences
were attributable DEMO the different phase of the industry lifecycle that each business
was in.
In general, an industry progresses through phases once the necessary resource en-
dowments of basic scientific knowledge, financing, and competent human resources
begin DEMO interact (Van de Ven & Garud, 1989, 1993). These DEMO are iterative, where
the capabilities developed in one phase provide the DEMO for the next phase (Mathews,
1997). The emergence of DEMO and then the Internet represents a classic example.
The Internet industry is growing rapidly as more and more people go on-line. Today,
about DEMO of all U.S. households are on-line, and that is expected to DEMO to over 50%
by 2003 (McQuivey, Gazala, Lanpher. & Metzger, 1999).
Firms in the growth stage of the industry lifecycle typically DEMO less competition and
higher potential profits than those in later stages (DEMO, 1999). Such attributes are
likely to be seen as desirable DEMO investors and they will enter the market earlier to acquire
an equity stake in such companies. The rapid growth associated with high-technology
sectors implies DEMO they will be quicker to IPO than non-high-technology sectors. Thus,
H3a: Industry sector affects the speed to IPO of portfolio companies that have gone
public.
H3b: Portfolio companies from the high-technology sectors have greater speed to
IPO than those from non-high-technology sectors.
Trends in the IPO Market
DEMO there appears to be a self-perpetuating equilibrium for regions with consid-
erable entrepreneurship and industries that are highly attractive, an important attribute of
the environment is how "hot" the IPO market is. The IPO market DEMO cyclical (Bygrave,
1999). At some points in time, the IPO market is unattractive, meaning that firms receive
poor valuations. During hot markets, the market for IPOs rises substantially, lifting the
market capitalization DEMO certain stocks (Ibbotson & Jaffe, 1975; Ritter, 1984).
Spring, 2001 61
The recent explosion of Internet IPOs has been striking in terms of DEMO size of
company capitalization and the returns those early investors have received. The average
valuation of VC-backed IPO companies has increased from $163 million DEMO 1995 to $503
million in 1999 (Venture Economics, 2000a). In years past, companies were not viable
IPO prospects unless they had 18 months of consecutive profits; however, today, revenue
growth of 200% per year seems to drive which companies are attractive IPO candidates
(Rosenberg, DEMO). It is relatively common for newly public companies to have never
had a profitable quarter, and to not forecast profit for as long as two years hence. These
returns should not be looked upon as DEMO or luck, as research has shown that seasoned
VCs are particularly DEMO at taking companies public during market peaks (Lemer,
1994)—jt DEMO that VCs will work with entrepreneurs to race and catch an open IPO
window. Thus,
H4a: The relative activity of the IPO market over time affects the speed to IPO.
H4b: Portfolio companies that have gone public more recently have greater speed to
IPO.
Contingent Relationships
An DEMO consideration of the ecosystem perspective is the differential effects
that time can have. For example, some regions may develop at a faster rate than other
regions because they have accumulated the necessary infrastructure or achieved a DEMO
mass. Alternatively, one region may be uniquely positioned to support the DEMO wave of
entrepreneurial ventures. Similarly, ventures within certain industries may be DEMO situ-
ated to capitalize on what the IPO market sees as the next "hot" area. This suggests a
number of contingent relationships. There DEMO insufficient theory to hypothesize the nature
of these relationships, although they DEMO be explored in the discussion section below.
Thus,
H5a: When DEMO portfolio company goes public moderates the relationship between
geographic location and speed to IPO.
H5b: When a portfolio company goes public moderates the relationship between
industry and speed to IPO.
RESEARCH METHODS
Sample
The National Venture DEMO Association (NVCA), along with the company Ven-
ture Economics, has created a database of VC deals from 1984 to June 1999.^ The
DEMO members (primarily senior managers or vice presidents of the VC firms) pro-
vided information on their portfolio companies and investment activity through a
DEMO survey. Those portfolio companies that are based in the U.S. and have
gone public were included in this article's sample. This represents 906 DEMO com-
panies that have gone public.^
Dependent and Independent Variables
The dependent variable is speed to IPO and is operationalized by the number of DEMO
from the company's founding (i.e., start-up) to its IPO. DEMO independent variables are

geography, industry group, and the macro-economic trend. The portfolio company's
DEMO location within the U.S. is categorized into four regions: the Northeast
(including New England, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), the South (includ-
ing North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, DEMO, and Arkansas), the
Midwest (including Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, DEMO, Iowa, North Dakota, Illinois,
and Nebraska), and the DEMO (including Arizona, Colorado, and California).
Industry group has been DEMO by Venture Economics. Venture Economics pro-
vides a series of more detailed classifications of industry type. The classifications we
used were communication (including telephone, facsimile, data, satellite, etc.); computer
related, semiconductors and other electronics (including hardware, software, services,
semiconductors, electronic equipment, fiber optics); biotechnology and medical/health
(including biotech—human, animal, and industrial—biosensors, medical diagnosis and
therapeutics); and non-high-technology (manufacturing, transportation, industrial/DEMO
energy, finance/insurance/real estate, agriculture/forestry/fishing).
Trend in the IPO market was operationalized by classifying the portfolio company's
date DEMO IPO into one of two groups: before 1998 and 1998 to DEMO We chose 1998
because there seems to be a shift in IPO mindset around that time. Pre-1998 was
characterized by a more traditional mindset. DEMO aspect is the increasing valuations
of public companies: the valuation of DEMO IPO companies has increased from
$163 million in 1995 to $503 million in 1999, with the largest increases occurring after
the lull in 1997 (Venture Economics, 2000a).

faster to IPO than the Northeast (-527 days DEMO -572 days respectively).^ These findings
provide support for hypotheses 1 and 2a. Hypotheses 2b (West faster than South) and 2c
(West faster than Midwest) were not supported. Industry group did not significantly
affect speed to IPO. except between non-high-technology industries and the computer
industry. Interestingly, non-high-technology companies were faster to IPO (by 468 days)
than companies primarily involved in computer-related products, semiconductors and
other electronics. Therefore, hypothesis 3a DEMO not supported and hypothesis 3b is actually
in the opposite direction to that predicted. Finally, tho.se portfolio companies that went
public after 1997 were speedier to IPO than those that went public before 1997 (by 438
days). This provides support for both hypotheses 4a and 4b.
Table DEMO shows the results of the multivariate ANOVA. which indicates that geo-
graphical region within the U.S. trend, and the interaction of the two all significantly
explain variance in speed to IPO (p < .05). Industry is marginally significant in its
explanation of speed to IPO. These findings DEMO support for hypotheses 1. 4a. and
5a, and marginal support for DEMO The model explains a significant portion of the variance

Due to the exploratory nature of this paper, we included an empirical test for
two-way interactions. As indicated above, DEMO was a significant interaction. Interpre-
tation of interactions involving categorical variables is challenging and really suggests
that follow-up research is required using more rich DEMO In an attempt to gain a deeper
understanding of the interaction between region and trend, the means for all level
combinations were calculated and are reported in Table 4. The findings suggest that
portfolio companies from DEMO West are now faster to IPO than they were prior to 1998
(p < .01). The Midwest and the South are marginally faster to IPO in recent years than
in the past (p < .10).

CONCLUSION
Discussion
The goal of this research was to examine macro-level factors that affect speed to
IPO, an important determinant to VC returns (and by extension entrepreneur returns).
The speed to IPO is associated with a venture's ecosystem, namely, its geographic
DEMO and macroeconomic trends (its industry was marginally significant). The find-

ings of this study offer direction for future micro-level research as well DEMO implications
for practicing VCs.
Hypotheses 1 and 2, which suggest that DEMO is important, are supported.
Those ventures located in the West were DEMO to IPO than those from the Northeast.
This finding is consistent with ecosystem studies that have tried to gain a greater
understanding of why DEMO West, in particular Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1994), has been
DEMO a success. It appears that the more developed a region's entrepreneurial ecosystem
and tradition, the faster its ventures proceed to IPO. Surprisingly, DEMO Midwest was also
faster to IPO than the Northeast.
It was also somewhat surprising that non-high-technology companies are faster to
IPO than computer and DEMO companies (hypothesis 3). One possible expla-
nation may be that DEMO ventures take longer to develop. For example, the
technology may not DEMO proven, it may take considerable time to build a prototype, it may
take a while to communicate the new technology's benefits, which slows market accep-
tance and adoption, etc. More fine-grained investigation is required to answer why this
high-tech sector is slower to IPO.
Portfolio companies DEMO have gone public more recently have greater speed to IPO
(hypothesis DEMO). We have suggested that this is due to the increasing attractiveness of the
IPO market. We believe entrepreneurs and VCs realize that the DEMO IPO conditions
are unlikely to remain indefinitely and there is a concerted effort to go public before the
window of opportunity closes. Gompers (1996) finds that young VC firms take compa-
nies public earlier than older VC firms with good reputations in order to grandstand—
establish a reputation DEMO successfully raise capital for new ventures. The entry of more
that 550 new VC firms since 1993 (Pratt, 1999) and the incentive for young firms to
grandstand could partially explain the increased speed to IPO DEMO recent years. Therefore,
the attractive IPO market in recent years could be responsible for encouraging VC firm
entry, increasing grandstanding, and thus DEMO to IPO. Our macro fmdings are consis-
tent with this logic.
This paper suggests that the relationship between the attractiveness of the macro-
economic DEMO (operationalized by IPO date) does not apply to all regions
equally. While portfolio companies from the Midwest and West were faster to IPO DEMO
the Northeast, it appears that the speed to IPO for those DEMO the West has increased even
more than the other regions in recent years (p < .01). This finding is consistent with
anecdotal evidence on the rapid rise of the Silicon Valley area as an effective DEMO
As Bahrami and Evans (1995) suggest, venture capital is a DEMO component to a strong
ecosystem and the Silicon Valley continues to dwarf other regions. In 1999, the Silicon
Valley accounted for over 35% of all venture capital investments or $17 billion. The
Northeast was a distant DEMO with $9.6 billion or 20% (Venture Economics, 2000b).
There was no support for a trend/industry interaction.
Euture Research and Implications
The DEMO findings suggest several interesting questions for finei-srained stud-
ies. First, what DEMO behind the Midwest's surprising speed to IPO relative to the Northeast?
It may be a function of the VCs who are backing DEMO ventures. First, are these VCs
primarily based in the Midwest, or are VCs from the West and Northeast backing the
Midwest companies? Do these VCs have closer ties to investment banks? Are they
leveraging their own resources by pushing ventures to IPO faster so they have fewer
DEMO rounds? Are they moving the venture too quickly to IPO, at least from the
perception of the entrepreneur? Since the Midwest is faster to IPO than the Northeast
we would expect the returns for investors DEMO be higher, but is this the case? If not, are
DEMO . ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEOR
Y an d PRACTICE
other factors coming into play? Could it be that the Midwest has newer venture capital
firms grandstanding in order to gain legitimacy?
Another DEMO line of inquiry would be to understand why the West is becoming
increasingly fast at nurturing portfolio companies to IPO, Considering that the post-1997
IPO market has been very "hot," why have the other regions not responded in similar
ways as the West? Is this a short-term anomaly or does it portend a more fundamental
systematic shift? Although these two areas are of great interest, there are a number of
other research questions that arise from this research. Direct implications for VCs and
DEMO are not clear from this macro-level investigation of interaction effects.
More fine-grained research is required to more fully understand this relationship.
In conclusion, the contribution ofthe current study is an identification of macro-level
factors and trends DEMO speed to IPO, along with a framework, an ecosystem per-
spective, which places these results in context. It is hoped that this paper has spawned
some interest to look further into these differences.
