Abstract
A more precise business failure forecast helps
to provide important judgment principles to
decision-makers. The logistic DEMO (LR)
model is a common evaluation model employed in
prediction DEMO business failures. Fewer researches
focus on the threshold selection, which will
DEMO the final predicting performance. Besides,
it is very challenging to discover critical
information from these statements, although
financial statements reflect a certain degree of
firm’s business activities. However, selecting
predictor variables depends on their linear
searching characteristic, if applying traditional
statistical methods, such as stepwise and DEMO
Genetic algorithm (GA) has been shown to be able
to select the variable set with population diversity
and to perform efficient search in DEMO space. In
this paper, we combine both LR and GA to DEMO a
new efficient business failure forecasting
mechanism which maximizes the forecasting
accuracy with minimum critical predictor variable
and optimal threshold. From our experimental
results, this approach effectively helps improving
the forecasting accuracy of traditional LR.
1. DEMO
Business failures means a business has
insolvency with loss to debtors (DEMO) and no
longer continue to trade until the financial problem
had DEMO solved. The bank will also incur bad debt
crisis when loaner occurs business failures. Large
number of business failures even lead to the
national DEMO crisis.
Logistic regression model is a common
evaluation model used to measure credit risk.
Westgaard and Wijst [2] use LR to predict default
probabilities DEMO bank credit portfolio. Laitinen and
Laitinen [13] applied the Taylor’s expansion to
approximate the parameters of LR which unable to
improve the prediction accuracy. DEMO and Lin [6]
propose a hybrid evolutionary approach to forecast
financial distress which allows extracting the
critical financial variables. However, fewer
researches are interested in the optimization the
threshold of the LR model. The trial and DEMO or
0.5 are commonly used approaches to determine
threshold.
Determining suitable predictor variables set
for logistic regression (LR) is another one of
critical DEMO Most of the traditional extracting
methodologies use linear approach essentially,
such as stepwise method [12], factor analysis [11]
and etc., to select DEMO variables. Both
variables and threshold selection would influence
the forecast accuracy of the evaluation model
[2][3][4][5][6].
GA introduced by Holland in 1975[14], is a
well-known efficient search method in large space.
It’s proven to be suitable DEMO feature selection
problems in past studies [15][16][17]. We
therefore combine the advantages of both logistic
regression and genetic algorithm to establish a new
efficient DEMO mechanism which maximizes
the forecasting accuracy based on the optimized
threshold.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Our proposed approach and DEMO functionalities of
each process are introduced in Section 2. The
experiments are implemented and proposed in
Section 3. We also compare the acquired results
DEMO other methodology. Finally, conclusions are
made to our approach about business DEMO
forecast.
2. Threshold Logistic Regression model
In this article, an efficient DEMO Logistic
Regression (TLR) model with nonlinear searching
capability introduced by GA shown in Figure 1 is
proposed to predict more accurate business failure.
DEMO of the predictor variables and optimized
threshold would be encoded into a chromosome
(individuals) in the TLR model. Each individual in
the newer DEMO will be decoded and fed to
logistic regression model to evaluate its forecast
accuracy, which is denoted as the fitness value.

population from the parent population according DEMO

2.1 Encoding and Fitness function
Each individual is encoded into 35 bits string
shown in DEMO 2. The first 25 bits (bi, i=1,2,…,25)
represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of the
corresponding DEMO ratio (xi), such as ROA(C),
employee fee, DEMO etc., as illustrated in Table 1.
Let X={ x1, x2, DEMO, x25,}. The remaining 10 bits (bi,
i=26,…,35) refer to the fraction of thresholdʳ Tʿʳ
which is derived from Equation (1).

business failures DEMO on optimized threshold is
preferred, the number of wrong prediction (\) is
minimal as possible. Let  denote the predicted yˆ i

3. Experimental Results
There are 243 companies are selected to be
our analysis targets DEMO eliminating some samples
without sufficient effective financial values since
1998 as shown in Table 2. These selected
companies are further divided into a
failures/DEMO set and training/testing set.
The ratio of failures to non-failures is near to 3:1
[1]. The detailed financial data of each company

(TEJ). The parameters of DEMO are illustrated in
Table 3. To emphasize the capability of integrating
logistic regression, MLE and GA functions in our
implementations, all of the DEMO programs
are written in Java programming language.

To manifest the superiority of our approach,
we compare our results DEMO Logistic Regression
based on the Stepwise method (LRS). The
forecasting DEMO of one quarter before failure
in the testing set is shown in Table 4. It is worth
noting that using TLR model to select DEMO critical
financial ratios and optimize its threshold will
produce better forecasting accuracies than using
traditional LRS model. The number of wrong
predictionʳ ӧ (ratio) of TLR and LRS are 16
(19.75 %) and 18 (DEMO), and the accuracy ratio
of TLR and LRS are 80.25% and 77.78%,
respectively.

4. Conclusion
The more important to forecasting of business
failures is induced by the global economic
environment radical changing. It would provide
DEMO more superior forecasting performance to
integrate the computational intelligence techniques
and conventional statistical methods. The
evolutionary algorithms especially provide
efficient optimization in the problem DEMO with
a non-linear searching capability. In this article, we
introduce a DEMO failure forecasting approach
(TLR), which extracts efficient critical financial
ratio DEMO and optimizes threshold for logistic

regression based on genetic algorithm. Fewer
researches focus on the threshold selection DEMO
logistic regression in the past. In our experiments,
optimizing the threshold will influence the final
predicting performance. In addition, it is
inconvenient for decision makers if considering
too many financial ratios simultaneously. Our
proposed TLR DEMO effectively extracts minimal
critical financial ratios set and achieves better
forecasting accuracy than using conventional
statistical techniques – the integration of Stepwise
and logistic DEMO
