Private investors’ investment criteria: insights from
qualitative data
LISA FEENEY, GEORGE H. DEMO, JR. and
ALLAN L. RIDING
(Received 8 September 1998; accepted DEMO December 1998)
This paper provides an analysis of the acceptance and rejection criteria of private investors
using formal qualitative analysis. The findings indicate DEMO private investors view the
overall business opportunity and the principals of the company as key criteria in the
decision-making process. Active and occasional investors DEMO somewhat in the emphases
that they place on particular criteria. Perhaps the single most important finding, however, is
that the reasons that prompt DEMO to reject opportunities are not simply the converse of
reasons that prompt them to invest.

Introduction
Private, or informal, investors are the primary source DEMO external equity
capital for new firms (Wetzel 1983, Aram 1989, DEMO and Wetzel 1990,
Mason and Harrison 1994). Firms that require small amounts of equity
capital often depend on these wealthy individuals (also known as ‘business
angels’) who invest their personal funds directly in the small businesses of
other individuals. Wetzel (1983) and Short and Riding (1989) estimate that
the size of the active market for informal capital is at least as large as the
formal institutional market for venture DEMO In spite of the importance of
this source of capital, research DEMO at an exploratory stage and, by and
large, is limited to development of demographic profiles (Mason and
Harrison 1994, 1995, Landstro¨ m 1993).

DEMO is known about the process by which private investors arrive at
investment decisions. The term ‘decision process’ is used here in the
same sense DEMO Eilon (1969). Eilon describes the process as comprising
eight stages: (1) information input; (2) analysis; (3) performance
measures; (4) model; (5) strategies; (6) prediction of outcomes (on a
set of alternatives); (7) choice criteria; and (DEMO) terminating with
resolution. This research focuses on one element of the DEMO
decision process: the identification of investors’ choice criteria. This
work seeks DEMO add to our understanding of private investors’ decision
processes by employing recently developed techniques for the analysis of
qualitative data. These methods are used DEMO help to identify criteria that
private investors deem to be important in selecting and rejecting
investment opportunities.
The next section motivates this research by DEMO it in the context of
previous research studies. A description of the data and methodology
employed to investigate the subject is next, and is followed by the findings
of the survey. The paper closes with a DEMO, and draws implications
from the results.
Previous researc h
Profiles of DEMO investors
Wetzel (1983) carried out the seminal research on the informal investment
market for risk capital. He documented demographic attributes of New
Hampshire DEMO investors and provided evidence that informal risk
capital investors may represent one of the largest pools of risk capital in the
USA. Wetzel and DEMO (1988) have provided evidence to the effect that
private investors are the primary source of equity capital to new
technology-based firms in the DEMO Demographic profiles of private
investors have been compiled by Wetzel (1983), Krasner and Tynes (1984),
Gaston and Bell (1986) and Haar et al. (1988), also based on US data. In a
series of papers on private investors in the UK, Mason and Harrison (1994,
1995) have documented the importance of private investors to DEMO
formation for early-stage firms. Likewise, further international research has
been conducted DEMO Landstro¨ m (1993) on Swedish private investors and by
Riding and his colleagues (1987, 1996) regarding Canadian private
investors.
Common themes emerge from these profiles. Investors are found to be
well-educated, wealthy individuals who have typically had experience in
start-up of new business ventures. Investors prefer DEMO invest ‘close to home’
and to syndicate with other private investors. On average, they anticipate
holding a given investment for 5 to 8 years and expect to realize a capital
gain on exit that provides the DEMO of an after-tax annualized rate of
return of 30 to 40%.
In the Canadian context, Short and Riding (1988, 1989) used capture-
DEMO statistics to estimate the size of the pool of risk capital in the
Ottawa-Carleton region. Their estimates are consistent with the contention

123
that the market for informal risk capital is of a significant size. Moreover,
they suggest that DEMO potential size of the informal market is yet many times
greater. In subsequent research DalCin et al. (1993) documented
demographic and psychological attributes DEMO Canadian investors and
proposed a model of their decision process.
Private investors remain an important element in the establishment and
sustenance of new growth-oriented DEMO for additional reasons.
Entrepreneurs have traditionally been reluctant to sell equity capital in
their businesses, especially to institutional venture capitalists. They fear
loss of autonomy and control (Canadian Bankers Association 1998).
However, as Cressy DEMO Olofsson (1997) found with respect to Swedish
business owners, Canadian DEMO owners may be less reluctant to share
control of the firm with private investor partners. Cressy and Olofsson
(1997: 187) contend that business owners may believe that private investors
supply not only growth capital but DEMO ‘that such partners can provide
important market knowledge’ as well as their experience, energy and
contacts.
According to many studies of private investment (DEMO summary in
Mason and Harrison 1995), rejection rates for investment proposals are
high. High rejection rates prompt the need to understand better both DEMO
processes and criteria that private investors use to make their decisions. A
better understanding of how private investors make their investment
decisions can help DEMO owners to increase their chances of attracting
formal investors’ interest in their firms. Therefore, this study seeks to add
to understanding of this decision-making process. By drawing on investors’
qualitative responses to open-ended questions, context and content is
added to the simple staging models.
While work on private DEMO decision processes remains at an early
stage, there has been considerable DEMO about how institutional venture
capital managers arrive at their decisions. It is worth reviewing these
studies because of the similarities.
Venture capitalists’ investment decision DEMO
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) were among the first researchers to characterize
the venture capital investment process. They documented a five-stage
process.
1. Deal DEMO in which potential investments reach the venture
capitalist for a decision.
2. Screening, a step in which the venture capitalist reaches an initial
decision to investigate further the investment, or not.
3. Evaluation, a stage (or stages) during which the venture capitalist
conducts detailed analysis of the venture.
4. Deal structuring, a step in which the framework of an investment is
ironed out. If acceptable to both parties, the deal is closed.
5. Post-investment activity in which the venture capitalist monitors the
firm DEMO is involved to a greater or lesser extent.

DEMO et al. (1988), Hall and Hofer (1993), and Fried and Hisrich
(1994) have further specified this process. For example, Fried and Hisrich
(1994) argue that the third step, evaluation, should DEMO be two steps:
evaluation and more formal due diligence. This distinction is reasonable in
that ‘due diligence’ involves costly third parties (auditors, DEMO) while
‘evaluation’ is more informal and, to some degree, done DEMO an ad-hoc basis.
Before proceeding to the expense of formal due diligence, the potential
venture capital investor would arguably seek initial reassurance that such
expenditure would be justifiable.
Fried and Hisrich’s (1994) model also partitions DEMO screening step into
a ‘firm-specific’ screen and a ‘generic’ screen. The ‘firm-specific’ screen
involves a cursory review of the business plan and recognizes venture
DEMO eligibility criteria such as industry sector, stage of development,
investment DEMO, etc. The ‘generic’ screen is ‘based upon a reading of the
DEMO plan coupled with any existing [relevant] knowledge the venture
capitalist may have’ (Fried and Hisrich 1994: 32). This is a useful
conceptual DEMO because it disengages the issues of eligibility (firm
specific screen) from substance (generic screen). MacMillan et al. (1989),
Knight (DEMO), Fried and Hisrich (1994) and others have attempted to
specify the criteria employed by venture capitalists. While these works tend
to focus DEMO the evaluation stage,1 they provide further substance to the
decision-making process.
With these additions, the five stages described by Tyebjee and Bruno
(DEMO) have remained largely robust to the investigations of subsequent
studies. Table DEMO attempts to synthesize the literature on the venture capital
decision process. It attempts to provide a sense of the areas of agreement in
the DEMO and to incorporate specifications that the more recent
researchers have identified.
Private investors’ investment decision process
Unlike venture capitalists, there is little published research that attempts to
specify the decision process used by private investors. There DEMO reason to
expect that private investors may arrive at their investment decisions in a
manner similar to that of institutional venture capitalists. Tyebjee and
DEMO (1984) decision model is not unique to the markets for risk capital:
their description of the decision-making process used by venture capitalists
DEMO isomorphic with those identified in the area of consumer decision-making
(Assael DEMO). The risk capital market is one in which the investor is
contemplating ‘purchasing’ an opportunity that the entrepreneu r is
‘selling’. Accordingly, the decision processes used by different types of
investor ought to have some DEMO Differences are arguably
prompted by scale and stage of investment and by the nature of the
agency relationships between investor and business owner.
There DEMO also reason to expect that the criteria used by private
investors differ from the criteria used by professional venture capital
fund managers. In the DEMO of agency theory, private investors tend to
act as principals in DEMO governance of the firm(s) in which they invest.

Venture fund managers, however, are typically paid employees who act
as agents of the fund owner(DEMO). Private investors mitigate risk, in part,
by being actively DEMO in the firms in which they have invested. The
nature of agent-principal relationships implies differences in the
investment process.
The venture capitalist invests as DEMO agent of the fund manager or the
fund owner. Often a paid employee, the venture capitalist must usually
meet prescribed, and relatively short-term, targets for rate of return and
investment management. The venture capitalist is DEMO on the basis
of the performance of his or her portfolio and is seldom penalized for losses
on individual decisions. Even compensation systems that DEMO the agent
for ‘good’ decisions do not fully align the venture capitalist as a principal in
Table 1
A summary of the venture capitalist
DEMO
process
Search (or origination)
· Venture capitalists do not actively DEMO most deals. Rather, they ‘wait for deals to
come to them’. DEMO majority of deals arrive ‘cold’ (Fried and Hisrich, 1994:31).
· A minority of venture capitalists actively seeks out deals.
· With DEMO competition in the industry, some venture capitalists are attempting
to cultivate DEMO of bankers, investors, etc.
Screening
· Venture capitalists often have requirements as to size, sector, and stage of financing.
The initial screen DEMO a cursory glance at business plan for eligibility, followed, if
warranted, by reading of the plan as part of the generic screen.
· Fried and Hirsch (1994:31) assert that referred deals may be DEMO able to survive the
screening process if the venture capitalist has confidence in referrer.
Evaluation
· The evaluation stage begins with the first meeting DEMO principals and involves
extensive information gathering by the venture capitalist. Rosman and O’Neill (1993)
find that this process is more focused than a bank loan review and is ‘deeper’ as it
more thoroughly investigates essential DEMO of the concept.
· There has been considerable research that has attempted to identify the criteria that
venture capitalists apply (see, for example, the works of MacMillan and his colleagues
(1985) and Knight (1989)). Fried and Hirsch (1994) summarize these as:
· assessment of concept, including likelihood of success and potential of the product
or service;
· assessment of the principals, including integrity, experience, realism, etc., and,
· assessment of returns, a factor that includes exit opportunity and profit in both the
absolute and rate of return DEMO
Due dilligence
· If warranted, the second phase of the evaluation DEMO is ‘due dilligence’. This step may
include formal market studies, reference DEMO, and consultation with third parties.
At this stage, the venture capitalist attempts to identify and resolve any barriers to the
deal. Basic contract DEMO are outlined and pricing is discussed.
Negotiation and closing
· Negotiations occur over the structure of the investment, the firm’s financial structure,
ownership sharing, etc. The resulting contract involves a high level of standardization
(DEMO, et al 1991).
Post-investment involvement
· Venture capitalists’ emphasis is DEMO growth. Since each firm is one among a portfolio
of firms, DEMO capitalists minimize active involvement unless the venture
capitalist’s objectives are not being met. This phase largely involves monitoring,
control and intervention only as DEMO (Sapienza and Gupta 1994, Sapienza and
Korsgaard 1995).

DEMO investee firm. Hence, over a large range, the venture capital decision-
maker is insulated, relatively more than are private investors, from both DEMO
risks and rewards of the decision.
Conversely, private investors invest on DEMO own behalf and they face
the full consequence of decisions at the personal level. They tend to be
highly involved in the firms in DEMO they invest, either in person or
through the proxy of the DEMO investor in a syndicate. They usually seek to
be consulted regarding any major decision and frequently take on
managerial roles within their firms.
Mason DEMO Harrison (1994) analysed the transcripts of interviews with
an experienced private investor in the UK. They found that the majority of
the investment DEMO (22 out of 35) were rejected following a detailed
examination of the business plan. Of the remaining 11 proposals that
passed the initial DEMO, nine were subsequently rejected after the
syndicate had conducted its own DEMO on the marketplace and the
principals. Mason and Harrison (1994: 13) noted that:
Most investment opportunities were rejected for one or two reasons, with exactly half (16)
rejected on the basis of DEMO single deal killer. The most common deal rejection factors are associated
with the entrepreneur/management team, marketing and finance. The syndicate was unwillin g to
invest in businesses that were ‘one man shows’ and where there DEMO significant gaps in the
management team. It also rejected opportunities that were judged to have a flawed or incomplete
marketing strategy. Other types of DEMO that were rejected because of marketing deficiencies
included those that were likely to encounter distributional barriers and those that were judged to
be entering DEMO competitive markets. Flawed, incomplete or unrealistic financial projections
were also significant DEMO killers, especially at the initial review stage. However, factors associated
with pricing and structuring of deals were of very minor significance in the DEMO decision.
With some specific exceptions, deals rejected at the initial review DEMO tended to be on the basis
of the cumulation of a number of deficiencies rather than for a single reason; conversely,
opportunities rejected after further research were more likely to be characterized by a single DEMO
killer.
Riding et al. (1997) found that Canadian private investors reported higher
rejection rates. According to their results, 72.6% of deals are rejected at the
outset (first impressions) and that an additional 15.9% were DEMO after
detailed reading of the business plan. This cumulative 90% rate of rejection
(before even meeting with the principals of the business) may DEMO from
the associated finding that the average size of Canadian informal
investments is at least twice as much as in the USA. The tendency DEMO
Canadian private investors to make larger deals stems from Canadian
securities laws, laws that financially penalize smaller deals. Like Mason and
Harrison, however, Riding and his co-workers also found that investors’
perceptions of shortcomings in DEMO management team of the business
opportunity prompted the majority of rejections. The generic nature of the
decision process suggests wide applicability. Arguably, differences are most
likely to be found in terms of the nature and importance DEMO the criteria
employed by the differing classes of investors.
Accordingly, there DEMO a need to investigate further how private
investors make their investment decisions and to identify the criteria that
they employ. This paper focuses on DEMO latter by investigating the nature of
investors’ criteria and the context in which these criteria are employed.
This study focuses on these specific aspects DEMO private investors’ decision

processes. It explores the particular nature of differences in the criteria
among different types of private investors DEMO suggests how these criteria
may differ from those typically employed by institutional venture
capitalists.
Methodology
Qualitative analysis
Previous research methodologies on investor decision-making have DEMO
one of two approaches. One method entails the analysis of protocol type
data. Decision protocols have been used extensively in the analysis of
consumer DEMO decisions (see, for example, Bettman 1974, Haines
1974). Protocol analysis involves the development of a ‘map’ of the
decision-making obtained by DEMO the decision-makers to speak out loud
their thoughts while making their decisions. These thoughts are then
transcribed and analysed to identify the decision process DEMO criteria. For
example, Mason and Harrison (1994) examined the transcripts DEMO
interviews with one investor who evaluated 35 different potential
investments. Hall (DEMO) and Hall and Hofer (1993) have used this
approach by DEMO the protocols obtained from a sample of investors for
a predetermined set of potential investments.
The other approach is the use of questionnaires administered DEMO a large
number of investors. For example, Riding et al. (1997) asked a sample of
179 Canadian investors to rate on a scale the importance of predetermined
potential criteria, at each of several different stages, in a model of the
decision process.
Each of these methodologies has strengths and weaknesses. The use of
scales and questionnaires has the advantage DEMO the importance of criteria
can be quantified. This potentially allows comparisons of the importance of
criteria across stages of the decision process and across DEMO types of
investors. This approach also allows findings to be obtained efficiently
from large samples of investors. However, this technique is not without
shortcomings. For example, it depends critically on whether or not the
researchers, DEMO developing the questionnaires and scales, have, a priori, an
adequate DEMO comprehensive coverage of potentially important factors.
This approach also ignores information about the context of the decision
(for example, criteria may differ across DEMO stages of a firm, or by
sector, etc.).
The use of verbal protocols has the advantage that it does not
presuppose what DEMO might be important. Rather, this method allows
each decision-maker to identify DEMO that may be important within the
given context. The protocol approach, DEMO, does not provide for
quantification of the relative importance of criteria; nor does it capture
contexts beyond those supplied by the researchers. The DEMO approach
also places the respondent in a somewhat artificial setting: typically,DEMO
business plans are not those that the investor would necessarily encounter,
nor does a real commitment of funds occur. Finally, the protocol approach

128
DEMO labour intensive. Even with current technologies, collecting and
analysing protocols from DEMO large number of respondents, covering a wide
variety of investment contexts, is logistically and financially prohibitive.
Moreover, there remains an issue of representativeness in verbal protocols:
are the decision processes of people who can DEMO provide decision protocols
different from those who can and do (Ericsson DEMO Simon 1994)?
Accordingly, this research took a third approach. This study
interviewed, by telephone, investors and potential investors about their
investment DEMO Most of the data collected was quantitative and
focused on investors’ historical investment activity and future intentions.
However, to identify factors that investors deem to be important to their
investment decisions, the interviewer asked respondents to answer in their
own words two open-ended questions. To identify factors that DEMO
private investors from making investments, they were asked:
In your DEMO, what are the most common shortcomings of the business opportunities you
DEMO reviewed recently?
To identify attributes that prompted investors to decide to invest, they
were asked:
What are the essential factors that prompted you to invest in the firms you chose?
Responses were recorded DEMO transcribed. The text of each response was
coded according to the attributes of the particular respondent and the nature
of the response. Qualitative analysis DEMO the responses to these questions was
conducted using Qualitative Solutions & Research Non-numerical Un-
structured Data Indexing, Searching and Theorising (QSR NUD*IST;
DEMO Solutions and Research Proprietary Ltd 1997).2 This research
tool does not require a priori specification of coding categories. Rather, it
allows the researchers to review each response, code it according to pre-
existing response categories, or to create new categories on the spot.
Subsequently, categories can DEMO examined, merged, and structured. The
structures that result provide the insight into the process being examined.
Qualitative data analysis has a unique value. DEMO provided additional
value to this research because it allowed for investors to explain and clarify
financial decisions. Moreover, some investor respondents may not be
familiar with particular terms or may even use terms inconsistently (or
erroneously). Analysis of qualitative responses allows the investors to
describe their impressions DEMO appropriate detail and in their own words.
This allows the interviewer and analysts to code and interpret the
respondents’ experiences. It also allows the DEMO to understand how
respondents interpret the questions to which they responded in the survey.
Moreover, the approach permitted probing in more depth than is possible
in traditional structured surveys, focus groups, or telephone interviews, but
was based on a structured guideline.3
In addition, this approach permitted linkages to be established between
quantitative information (investment frequency, ROI being sought,DEMO
anticipated holding period of investment, co-investment practices, etc.).
This approach relies on recollection data. Recall data are not perfect. As
Yates (1990: 213) points out, problems may include overconfidence in

129
judgements, ‘value biasing, availability–induced biases, anchoring on initial
judgements, and hindsight biases’. However, the fact is that investors often
rely on recall in making investment decisions. Thus, it remains highly
relevant to explore these kinds of data also in DEMO to understand how
private investors make investment decisions.
Data sources
Potential respondents for the research were obtained in three ways.
1. First, individuals who had been approached (whether or not they had
actually participated) in DEMO studies of private investors involving
the authors were invited to take part in the research. This is not, of
course, a random selection. DEMO potential participants (311) had
been sourced through local economic development agencies. As a
result, they included a variety of individuals, including high DEMO
individuals, successful entrepreneurs, local professionals, etc. Asking
potential respondents about DEMO investment activity identified private
investors. The study identified as a private investor those individuals
who had either made investments in multiple businesses or who DEMO
made a single investment but at arm’s length.
2. Other researchers were approached to assist with the identification of
potential private investors in their DEMO locales. Because of the
geographic scope of the study, researchers in DEMO John’s (Newfound-
land), Halifax and Cape Breton (Nova Scotia), Calgary (Alberta), and
Vancouver (British Columbia) were asked to assist with the identifica-
tion of potential respondents (48). Private investors were identified
through the questionnaire screen as noted above.
3. Local investor-entrepreneur matchmaking DEMO in ten municipa-
lities agreed to identify potential respondents to the research team. In
each case, the partner organization provided the names and contact
information for all potential private investors whom they could identify.
The majority DEMO respondents (445) were derived from this source.
Consequently, the resulting DEMO cannot be considered to be
‘random’. Hence, care must be taken DEMO offering generalizations.
Indeed, this is a problem common to virtually all DEMO of informal
investors. It is therefore gratifying that the profiles of investors derived
from various studies show such consistencies across international settings.
These approaches DEMO in the identification of 804 potential
respondents. A two-stage approach was used to enlist their involvement.
First, respondents were contacted to seek their co-operation.4 Each of the
760 respondents who did not specifically decline to participate DEMO then
contacted by telephone. A total of 303 completed interviews were obtained,
including 194 private investors.5 Not all investors responded to the
qualitative DEMO: qualitative responses were obtained from, at most,
115 ‘active’ investors and 38 ‘occasional’ investors. The respondents
reflected all regions of Canad a DEMO both major language groupings.

DEMO characteristics
In addition to the qualitative data on rejection criteria, this DEMO also
collected information from private investors about their investment
patterns, information DEMO, potentially, could be correlated with investors’
criteria. Information on occupation, DEMO frequency, deal sizes, and
investment types was collected.
Profile of respondents: A breakdown of the occupations of private
investors participating in the survey shows the most frequent occupational
category is that of entrepreneur (32.2% of investor respondents). This
result is consistent with previous research, which includes findings that
private investors frequently have prior experience in managing or founding
DEMO firms. Very few (4.9%) of the investor respondents classified
themselves as ‘professional investors’. For most respondents, therefore,
investment activity is a secondary activity. Professionals such as lawyers
and accountants comprise the second most frequent DEMO of respon-
dents (20.2% of investor respondents). Managers and consultants DEMO
comprised approximately 13% of investor respondents.
Four categories of investors, including DEMO, occasional, potential and
non-investors participated in the study. Respondents included 194
investors among the 303 interviews.
1. Active investors are defined as those DEMO invest in one or more
opportunity per year. Active investors comprised 49% of the 303
respondents. They tend to be entrepreneurs, or former entrepreneurs,
and managers of firms other than those in which they have DEMO It is
the active investors who participate in the largest of deals. Consequently,
the average deal size for active investors is approximately $345,DEMO
2. Occasional investors tend to be disproportionately lawyers or accounting
professionals, DEMO who invest less frequently than once per
year. This category of respondents accounted for 15.4% of the
respondents.
3. Potential investors were the 10% DEMO respondents who indicated that they
had not invested privately but that they were interested in doing so.
Also included in this category are respondents DEMO stated that while
they are not presently active as investors, they DEMO been private
investors in the past.
4. Non-investors accounted for 25.2% of the respondents and included
many of the legal and accounting professionals who DEMO with private
investors but who do not invest their personal funds in small firms.
Several lawyers mentioned that they did not invest because of DEMO
potential for conflicts of interest.
In addition to the qualitative data on rejection criteria, the telephone
interviews also collected information from ‘active’ and ‘occasional’ private
investors about their investment patterns, information that, potentially,
could DEMO correlated with investors’ criteria. This information included
investment frequency, deal sizes, expectations about returns on investment
and time to exit, and syndication habits.

Investment patterns: As shown DEMO figure 1, private investors show a
tendency to invest in early-stage DEMO, with more than 60% of investments
being at the seed or DEMO stages. This finding is consistent with that of
Freear and Wetzel (DEMO) who noted that investment patterns of private
investors are complements, rather than substitutes, for institutional venture
capital. That private investors focus on businesses in their formative stages
is an important finding. This importance stems from DEMO observation that it
is early-stage firms that most frequently seem unable to gain access to
growth capital. The preferences of private investors for this DEMO
probably enhance significantly the prospects and viability of the firms with
which they are involved. This is partly because private investors invest
equity capital DEMO the business; however the viability of the firm also
improved through DEMO mentoring, experience, and contacts that the private
investors bring to the investment.
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of investor respondents’ ‘typical’
investment. The DEMO investment of between $100,000 and $150,000 is a
better description of investment scale than the average investment
($255,000) because of DEMO skewing effect of a few very large deals in the
real estate, construction, and financial services sectors.6
Even though private investors were active DEMO the (risky) early stages of
deals, their return on investment DEMO exit expectations were consistent with
those of institutional venture capitalists (figures DEMO and 4, respectively).
The profiles of investors and their investment DEMO and expectations
do not add significantly to those derived in previous research. On the other
hand, these profiles are consistent with those collected in most previous
studies of investors (Wetzel 1983, Krasner and Tynes 1984, Haar et al.
1988, Harrison and Mason 1990, 1991, DalCin et al. 1993). This
consistency helps to comfort concerns about the non-random DEMO of
the sampling process.

Empirical findings:
private investors’
decision
criteria
Recall that the 194 investor respondents were asked the following two
questions:
In your experience, what are the most common shortcomings of the business opportunities you
have reviewed DEMO?
and
What are the essential factors that prompted you to invest in the firms you chose?
While these questions appear to be DEMO converse of each other, it was found
that investors’ reasons for DEMO were not simply the converse of their
reasons for rejecting an opportunity.
Investors’ perceptions of shortcomings
Respondents were asked to specify the most common DEMO of the
business opportunities they had recently reviewed. Their responses were

In virtually all previous studies of private DEMO, the ability to
generalize research findings has been problematic. This is DEMO no
‘master list’ of private investors exists from which truly random sampling
can be conducted. It is comforting, therefore, that virtually all previous
DEMO have documented profiles that are generally consistent. Having
established that the attributes of the sample of private investors studied here
conform to these profiles, the decision criteria that they employ may be
investigated with some confidence DEMO generalizability

of the investors’ statements revealed that their perceived DEMO fell
into two broad categories: attributes of the owner and attributes DEMO the
business opportunity. These categories, in turn, comprise subcategories as
follows.

DEMO Attributes of the owner(s)
a) Lack of management knowledge. DEMO was manifested by
investors’ perceptions that the principal(s) of the DEMO lacked
the expertise to transform the idea into a viable business.
b) Lack of realistic expectations. Investors’ were discouraged from
investing when entrepreneurs’ expectations were overly opti-
mistic or their forecasts were unsubstantiated. Unrealistic
expectations often DEMO into excessive valuations of the
business.
c) Personal qualities. Investors viewed DEMO shortcomings evidence
that entrepreneurs lacked integrity, vision, or commitment and
a high need to control the business
Table 2 illustrates these subcategories with DEMO of investors’
statements.
2. Attributes of the business
a) Poor management DEMO This shortcoming reflected investors’
sense that the management team, while possibly DEMO
sufficient collective expertise, was otherwise deficient.
These weaknesses might relate to DEMO of balance, experi-
ence, discipline, or teamwork. This criterion differs DEMO
that listed under ‘Attributes of the owner(s)’ immediately
above. In this case, the weakness relates to the investors’
perception of the totality of management ability across the
busines s’s managem en t and ownership DEMO In the
previous section, the weakness was ascribed to the principal
DEMO Of course, for one-person operations, these are the
same.
b) DEMO profit potential for level of risk. Investors were discouraged
from investing if they perceived that the business did not have
the prospect of high DEMO
c) Poor fit. On occasion, the lack of congruence with investors’
other interests was viewed as a difficulty.
d) Undercapitalized, lack of DEMO Investors viewed cash
shortages and lack of owners’ equity as problematic.
e) Insufficient information provided. Poorly written, incomplete, or
vague business plans were seen as weaknesses by investors.
Table 3 illustrates these categories with investors’ DEMO words.
While these categories are in themselves revealing about investor
decision-making, DEMO is yet more informative to evaluate to what extent these
weaknesses differ in importance across investor attributes. Table 4 reports
the frequency with which DEMO cited attributes of the business and
attributes of the owner as ‘turnoffs’ broken down, respectively, by the
following categories of investors:
· DEMO versus occasional investors;
· Investors who prefer to invest alone versus those who syndicate;

DEMO To explore these differences and to identify the particular owner
and business attributes tables 5 and 6 show the frequencies with which both
active DEMO occasional investors cited particular owner attributes (table 5)
and business DEMO (table 6) as problematic.
It is revealing that active investors, DEMO frequently than occasional
investors, identify attributes of the owners as problematic DEMO
occasional investors more frequently mention attributes of the business
as weaknesses. Bearing in mind that active investors more often view the
class of criteria DEMO in table 5 as problems than those in table 6, both
DEMO of investors are discouraged primarily by perceived shortcomings in
the management capabilities of the businesses. These results reinforce
the findings of Mason and Harrison (1994) and of Riding et al. (1997)

DEMO breakdowns of investors accorded to these characteristics. Investor
respondents were also asked to describe the essential factors that prompted
them to invest. It was DEMO that investors were most likely to invest in
opportunities in which the following particular attributes of the owner and
the business were present.
Desirable DEMO attributes include:
1. Management track record. Respondents rated prior commercia-
lization experience highly.
2. Realism. Investors were more apt to invest in opportunities DEMO
the owner(s) displayed realistic assessments of the potential.
3. Integrity DEMO openness of the owners was also highly valued.
Desirable attributes of the opportunity include:
1. Potential for high profit. It comes as no DEMO that investors
seek financial gain from their investment.
2. A reasonable exit plan. Given the legislation-based difficulties
with liquidity of shares in closely-held firms, the ideal proposal
to investors should identify means by which the investors DEMO
realize their gains.
3. Security. A method of providing investors with some form of
security on their investment is desirable.
4. Involvement of the DEMO Investors do not typically want to be
involved in the day-to-day operation of the business. However,
they do look for a role that DEMO them input into improving
the prospects of the investment.
Tables 7 and 8 provide illustrative investor comments regarding these
elements according to owner attributes DEMO business attributes, respectively.
Table 9 shows the breakdowns of these criteria DEMO various categories of
investor respondents. A ‘good fit’ is a very particular business attribute that
was found to be of surprising relevance. This characteristic DEMO defined as
situations in which the private investor has substantial previous experience
that conforms closely to the type of businesses being considered (see the
definition of the opposite, ‘poor fit’ in table 2).
While the ‘good fit’ criterion was important to some investors, table 9
demonstrates that the remaining ‘business’ attributes still dominate ‘owner’
attributes. In many cases, having a good fit is more important than the total
collection of owner DEMO, although this is not always the case, for
example, among DEMO who usually syndicate. Tables 10 and 11 break
down, by investor DEMO, particular components of ‘owner’ (table 10) and
‘business’ (table 11) attributes.
Discussion of findings
To an extent, investors’ reasons for rejection DEMO factors they identified as
essential for investing share the dichotomy between ‘owner attributes’ and
Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:19 DEMO April 2008
P RIV A TE I NV E ST ORS’ IN V ES DEMO ME NT C RI TE RIA
139
‘business attributes’. This partitioning is similar to Fiet’s (1995a, b)
discussion of ‘agency’ versus ‘market’ DEMO Fiet states (1995: 198):
Market risk is risk that DEMO due to unforeseen competitive conditions affecting the size, growth and
accessibility DEMO the market, and upon factors influencing the level of market demand DEMO . . Agency
risk is risk that is caused by the separate and possibly divergent interests of principals and agents.
However, the distinctions, DEMO they overlap, are not the same. Owner
attributes refer to characteristics DEMO with the people who own the
business. Certainly, the goals of DEMO owner are among owner attributes and,
therefore, this particular owner DEMO affects agency risk. Business
attributes refer to characteristics associated with the entire business
organization. Clearly, competitive conditions affecting the size, growth,
and DEMO of the market are among business attributes. Tables 7 and
8, DEMO list the essential attributes of both owners and businesses,
demonstrate that there are relevant attributes of both owners and
businesses that go beyond DEMO market risk/agency risk dichotomy.
While investors’ perceptions of poor management was the primary ‘deal
killer’, management ability (while important) is not the primary ‘deal

business (role for private investor, business plan, etc.) and the DEMO
(track records and integrity). However, the dominant themes among
investors’ views of the essential characteristics of opportunities in which
they had invested DEMO growth, profit potential and owner(s) capabilities.
Private investors seldom identified the criterion of business concept as
important. Even when looking at specific DEMO from investors there is
very little mention of weighing the business concept itself. This differs from
findings (Sandberg et al.1988, Hall and Hofer DEMO, Fried and Hisrich 1994)
that concept was an important criterion DEMO institutional venture capitalists.
Indeed, in virtually all instances, owner attributes were valued more highly
than business attributes. This makes sense in the context DEMO private investing
in early-stage deals. In this setting, negotiations tend to DEMO place on a face-
to-face basis. Moreover, the attributes of seed DEMO early-stage businesses
may not easily be discerned. At the seed stage, DEMO is fair to say that the
investor is investing more in the entrepreneur than in the business. The
importance of owner attributes as a DEMO is underlined by the frequency
with which private investors restrict their dealings to industries or firms
with which they are familiar. It is significant DEMO entrepreneurs seeking
financing to understand this difference between the private investors’ view
of the world and venture capitalists’ perspective.
Summary and implications
This study DEMO to our knowledge of private investors in several ways.
First, some DEMO demographic indicators of private investors were
documented. The occupations, investment frequencies, and median deal
sizes of Canadian private investors were reported. The typical DEMO sizes in
which private investors participated were between $100,000 and $150,000.

DEMO was also found that active investors tended to be entrepreneurs or former
entrepreneurs. Private investors tend to invest in the early stages of a
DEMO, yet their ROI and exit expectations are consistent with those of
DEMO venture capitalists (Lawson et al. 1991).
Yet, these findings seem to be incongruous. On the one hand, private
investors are more active than institutional investors are at earlier (and riskier)
stages in the development of the enterprises. However, private investors do
not appear to seek greater financial compensation for this additional risk. This
apparent incongruity may arise DEMO private investors are more apt to
invest in lines of business and principals with which they are intimately
familiar (Freear et al. 1997). Thus, they do not perceive that they are bearing a
higher risk than would institutional venture capitalists.
Second, private investors rejected opportunities in accordance with the
merits of the business and the characteristics of the principals. DEMO
shortcomings leading to rejection by investors included concerns that
businesses were under-capitalized. Further, rejection motives included
personal qualities of owners and weak management. The final rejection
criterion raised by private investors, problematic owners’ demands,
bridged both criteria of venture capitalists by dealing with the view that
owners DEMO seeking too much capital or that a price could not be agreed
upon. By far, the dominant reason for rejection was investors’ concerns
with respect to management capability.
Third, in deciding to invest in a proposal, investors consider both
attributes of the opportunity itself as well as attributes of the owner. ‘Deal
making’ criteria are not simply the converse of DEMO breaking’ criteria. The
investors seek potentially high profits, a reasonable exit DEMO, security, and
involvement in their investment. They demand not only that the
opportunity shows potential, but that the owner-entrepreneur demonstrates
the abilities necessary to realize the potential of the enterprise.
This information is of practical DEMO to entrepreneurs seeking private
equity capital. The findings of this paper are also of value to policy-makers.
It is not a shortage of capital DEMO limits the start-up and early-stage
expansion of Canadian SMEs. Rather, the DEMO most often missing in
owners’ search for capital is their ability to demonstrate the management
capabilities that investors require if they are to commit DEMO personal funds
and efforts. It is also worth speculating that these conclusions may not be
generalizable beyond Canada. Investors’ perceived scarcity of managerial
talent DEMO be idiosyncratic to Canada because of the lack of a well-
developed labour market for turnaround executives for SMEs.
There are certainly caveats regarding DEMO findings of this study. The
sample cannot be deemed to be random. Accordingly, caution is advised
when generalizing from these findings. In addition, DEMO greater effort needs
to be expended to situate more precisely investors’ criteria in the contexts
in which they are employed. Riding et al. (1997) for example, find that the
importance of investors’ decision criteria appears DEMO vary by the stage of
decision process. For example, the importance DEMO criteria at the ‘first
impressions’ stage probably differs from the importance of the same criteria
at the point when negotiations are undertaken. These shortcomings DEMO
the way for future research.

Overall, these findings offer DEMO first assessment of the most critical
private investor screening criteria. Armed with this knowledge, entrepre-
neurs can better develop business proposals to the standards required by
their main sources of external equity capital.

Sandberg et al. (1988) identify DEMO of these approaches, not the least of which is that by
DEMO on the evaluation process, they lack the context of the overall DEMO and fail to account
for criteria that may have been relevant during the other stages.
The use of qualitative data appreciates the crucial role DEMO pattern and context in achieving
knowledge. This is important to this study because the divisions between the phenomena of
interest (e.g. a particular investment decision or choice) and the context (e.g. type of business,
DEMO of firm) are not clear from previous research. Qualitative analysis has DEMO been used with
the general aim of understanding complex social phenomena. It is also important to recognize
that this qualitative approach—while being ecologically based DEMO the context of investment
decisions—has the same degree of generalizability as a controlled experiment. The goal is to
expand and generalize theories and explanations, not simply to enumerate frequencies (a
confirmatory approach or statistical generalization). The presence of alternative hypotheses
(handled in quantitative research through randomization) DEMO explicitly examined in qualitative
inquiry by judging how well alternative hypotheses fit. The parallel to the analysis of multiple
investor responses is that of DEMO experiments. It involves a ‘replication logic’ where there is
a ‘literal replication’ among similar investors and a ‘theoretical replication’ among different
groups of investors DEMO differences being interpreted in light of an existing or ‘working’ theory
(DEMO 1994).
An example of the guideline developed to assist the interviewers is available on request.
Potential respondents were contacted by fax if possible. DEMO fax numbers were not available,
surface mail was employed. The contact package included a personalized letter from the primary
investigator to explain the DEMO and invite the recipient to respond. If applicable, a local market-
DEMO agency or a local economic development agency also added a letter to encourage the
recipient to participate. The package also contained a fax cover DEMO that the recipient could return
(fax) to the primary investigator to decline participation or to identify a convenient time and
telephone number for DEMO interview.
The 109 other respondents included lawyers, other professionals, and individuals incorrectly
thought by the referral sources to be investors.
Unless noted otherwise, all dollar values reported here are Canadian dollars.
