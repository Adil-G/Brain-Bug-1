Optimal Investment, Monitoring, and the
Staging of Venture Capital
PAUL A. GOMPERS*
DEMO
This paper examines the structure of staged venture capital investments when
agency and monitoring costs exist. Expected agency costs increase as assets become
less DEMO, growth options increase, and asset specificity rises. Data from a random
sample of 794 venture capital-backed firms support the predictions. Venture capital-
ists DEMO investments in early stage and high technology companies where
informational asymmetries are highest. Decreases in industry ratios of tangible
assets to total assets, higher market-to-book ratios, and greater R&D intensities lead
to more frequent monitoring. Venture capitalists periodically gather information and
maintain the option to discontinue funding DEMO with little probability of going
public.
THEASYMMETRIC INFORMATION ASSOCIATED with startup companies makes project
governance extremely important. During the screening process, venture cap-
italists review business plans of young companies and design contracts with
entrepreneurs that DEMO potential agency costs. Sahlman's extensive field
research (1990) describes venture capital in terms of the control mechanisms
employed to manage these agency DEMO Three control mechanisms are com-
mon to nearly all venture capital financing: 1)the use of convertible securities;
2) syndication of investment; and 3) the staging of capital infusions. The first
two control mechanisms are examined by Gompers (1993a' 1993b) and Lerner
(1994a).This DEMO examines factors affecting the structure of periodic invest-
ment by venture capitalists. The evidence indicates that the staging of capital
infusions allows venture capitalists DEMO gather information and monitor the
progress of firms, maintaining the option DEMO periodically abandon projects.
Sahlman notes that staged capital infusions are the most potent control
mechanism a venture capitalist can employ. Prospects for the firm DEMO peri-

odically reevaluated. The shorter the duration of DEMO individual round of fi-
nancing, the more frequently the venture capitalist DEMO the entrepre-
neur's progress and the greater the need to gather information. The role of
staged capital infusion is analogous to that of DEMO in highly leveraged trans-
actions, keeping the ownerlmanager on a "tight leash" and reducing potential
losses from bad decisions. While the duration of a particular round is one
potential metric for the intensity of monitoring, the size of each investment,
total financing provided, and number of financing rounds are also important
measures of the staged investment structure.
This DEMO develops predictions from agency theory that shed light on
factors affecting the duration and size of venture capital investments. Venture
capitalists weigh potential agency DEMO monitoring costs when determining
how frequently they should reevaluate projects and supply capital. Venture
capitalists are concerned that entrepreneurs' private benefits from certain
investments or strategies may not be perfectly correlated with shareholders'
monetary return. DEMO monitoring is costly and cannot be performed con-
tinuously, the venture DEMO will periodically check the project's status and
preserve the option to abandon. The duration of funding and hence the inten-
sity of monitoring DEMO be negatively related to expected agency costs.
Agency costs increase as the tangibility of assets declines, the share of growth
options in firm value rises, and asset specificity grows.
Agency theory predicts that the information generated by venture capitalists
is valuable. Models of venture capital have emphasized the DEMO of information
production.1 Chan (1983) develops a model in which venture capitalists im-
prove allocational efficiency by overcoming asymmetric information. Admati
and Pfleiderer (1994) derive robust financial contracts when lead venture
capitalists are better informed than other investors. They demonstrate that a
contract in which the lead DEMO capitalist maintains a constant fraction of
the firm's equity is the only form of financing that is robust to small changes
in possible DEMO
This paper utilizes a unique data set to test the agency and monitoring cost
predictions. A random sample of 794 venture capital-financed companies pro-
DEMO a detailed picture of the structure of venture capital investments and the
distribution of outcomes for venture-backed projects (e.g., initial public offer-
ing (IPO), merger, bankruptcy, etc.). The results confirm the predictions DEMO
agency theory. Venture capitalists concentrate investments in early stage
companies and high technology industries where informational asymmetries
are significant and monitoring is valuable. Venture DEMO monitor the
firm's progress and if they learn negative information about future returns, the
project should be cut off from new financing. Firms that go public (these firms
yield the highest return for venture capitalists on average) receive more total
Amit, Glosten, and Muller (1990) present an alternative model in which venture capitalists
cannot generate information and DEMO high ability entrepreneurs from low ability entrepre-
neurs. In this case, DEMO selection leads only low ability entrepreneurs to accept venture capital

financing and DEMO greater number of rounds than other firms (those that go
bankrupt DEMO are acquired). I also find that early stage firms receive signifi-
cantly less money per round. Increases in asset tangibility increase financing
duration DEMO reduce monitoring intensity. As the role of future investment
opportunities in firm value increases (higher market-to-book ratios), duration
declines. Similarly, higher R&DEMO intensities lead to shorter funding durations.
The paper also provides evidence about the relationship between investment
and liquidity in the venture capital market. In DEMO when venture capital-
ists are able to raise more capital for new investments, they invest more money
per round and more frequently in the firms they finance. Greater commitments
to new venture capital funds may measure DEMO of new, inexperienced venture
capitalists or free cash flow agency costs.

factors that should affect the structure of staged capital infusions. The data set
is DEMO in Section 11, and trends in venture capital investing are dis-
DEMO Factors affecting the staging of venture capital investments are ana-
lyzed in Section 111. Section IV examines alternative explanations. Section V
concludes the paper.
DEMO Factors Affecting the Structure of Staged Venture
Capital Investments
A. Agency and Monitoring Costs
Venture capitalists claim that the information they generate and the DEMO
they provide for portfolio companies are as important as the capital infused.
Many entrepreneurs believe that venture capitalists provide little more than
money. If DEMO monitoring provided by venture capitalists is valuable, certain
predictions can be DEMO about the structure of staged capital infusions.
If monitoring and information gathering are important, venture capitalists
should invest in firms in which asymmetric information is likely to be a
problem. The value of oversight will be DEMO for these firms. Early stage
companies have short or no histories to examine and are difficult to evaluate.
Similarly, firms in industries with significant growth opportunities and high
R&D intensities are likely to require close DEMO A significant fraction of
venture investment should therefore be directed toward early stage and high
technology companies.
Total venture financing and the number of DEMO rounds should also be
higher for successful projects than for failures if venture capitalists use infor-
mation in investment decisions. Venture capitalists monitor a DEMO's progress
and discontinue funding the project if they learn negative information about
future prospects. In Venture Economics' (1988) review of returns on venture
capital investments, venture capital-backed companies that eventually did
initial public offerings yielded the highest return for venture investors, an
average 59.5 percent per year (7.1 times invested capital returned over 4.2
years). Acquisitions offered average returns of only 15.4 percent per year (1.7
1464
The Journal of Finance
times invested capital returned over 3.7 years) while liquidations lost 80
percent of their value over 4.1 years. Firms DEMO public should, therefore,
receive greater total funding and more rounds DEMO financing than firms that are
acquired or liquidated.
The positive relationship between going public and level of investment is not
obvious unless venture capitalists DEMO information during the investment
process. If venture capitalists only provide capital, DEMO that go public might
quickly turn profitable and would need less venture capital financing and
fewer rounds than companies that are acquired or liquidated.
DEMO asymmetric information and agency costs do not exist, the structure of
DEMO is irrelevant. As Hart (1991) points out, if entrepreneurs pursue
DEMO value maximizing strategies, financing is simple. Venture capi-
talists would give DEMO all the money they need and entrepreneurs
would decide whether to continue the project based on their information. In the
case of startups, entrepreneurs would derive stopping rules that maximized
shareholder value using methods described in DEMO and Weitzman (1981)
and Weitzman, Newey, and Rabin (1981). Based on their private information,
they would decide whether to DEMO the project or not.
The private benefits from managing the firms they create, however, may not
always be perfectly correlated with shareholders' monetary returns. Entrepre-
neurs may have incentives to continue running projects they know DEMO
negative net present value (NPV). Similarly, entrepreneurs may invest in
projects that have high personal benefits but low monetary returns for inves-
DEMO If venture capitalists could costlessly monitor the firm, they would mon-
DEMO and infuse cash continuously. If the firm's expected NPV fell below the
stopping point, the venture capitalist would halt funding of the project.
In practice, venture capitalists incur costs when they monitor and infuse
capital. Monitoring costs include the opportunity cost of generating reports for
both the DEMO capitalist and entrepreneur. If venture capitalists need to
"kick the tires" of the plant, read reports, and take time away from other
DEMO, these costs can be substantial. Contracting costs and the lost time
DEMO resources of the entrepreneur must be imputed as well. Each time capital
is infused, contracts are written and negotiated, lawyers are paid, and other
associated costs are incurred. These costs mean that funding will occur DEMO
discrete stages.
Even though venture capitalists periodically "check up" on entrepreneurs
between capital infusions, entrepreneurs still have private information about
the projects they manage. Gorman and Sahlman (1989) indicate that between
financing rounds, the lead venture capitalist visits the entrepreneur once a
month on average and DEMO four to five hours at the facility during each visit.
Non-lead venture capitalists typically visit the firm once a quarter for an
average of DEMO to three hours. Venture capitalists also receive monthly finan-
cial reports. Gorman and Sahlman show, however, that venture capitalists do
not usually become DEMO in the day-to-day management of the firm. Major
review of progress, DEMO diligence, and the decision to continue funding are

generally done DEMO the time of refinancing. Venture capitalists are concerned
that between evaluations, DEMO might behave opportunistically.
Two well-known companies illustrate how venture capitalists use staged
investment to periodically evaluate a firm's progress. Apple Computer received
three DEMO of venture capital financing. In the first round, venture capital-
ists DEMO $518,000 in January 1978 at a price of $0.09 per share. The
company was doing well by the second round of venture financing DEMO Septem-
ber 1978. Venture investors committed an additional $704,000 at a price of
$0.28 per share, reflecting the progress the firm had made. A final venture
capital infusion of $2,331,000 was made in DEMO 1980 at $0.97 per share.
At each stage, the increasing price DEMO share and the growing investment
reflected resolution of uncertainty concerning Apple's prospects.
Federal Express represents a second example of how venture capitalists use
DEMO capital infusions to monitor the firm. Federal Express also received
three rounds of venture capital financing, but the firm's prospects developed in
a much different manner. The first venture financing round occurred in Sep-
tember DEMO when $12.25 million was invested at a price of $204.17 per share.
The firm's performance was well below expectations and a second venture
DEMO round was necessary in March 1974. $6.4 million was invested at
$7.34 per share and reflected the poor performance of the company. Perfor-
mance DEMO to deteriorate and a third round of financing was needed in
September 1974. At this stage, the venture capital investors intervened exten-
sively in the strategy of the company. The $3.88 million investment was priced
at DEMO per share. Ultimately, performance improved and Federal Express
went public in DEMO at $6 per share, but the staged investment of the venture
DEMO allowed the venture investors to intervene and price subsequent
rounds so they could earn a fair rate of return.
Two related types of agency DEMO exist in entrepreneurial firms. First,
entrepreneurs might invest in strategies, DEMO, or projects that have high
personal returns but low expected monetary DEMO to shareholders. For
example, a biotechnology company founder may choose to DEMO in a certain
type of research that bring himher great recognition in the scientific commu-
nity but provides less return for the venture capitalist DEMO other projects.
Similarly, because entrepreneurs' equity stakes are essentially call options,2
they have incentives to pursue high variance strategies like rushing a DEMO
to market when further testing may be warranted.
Second, if the DEMO possesses private information and chooses to
continue investing in a negative NPV project, the entrepreneur is undertaking
inefficient continuation. For example, managers may DEMO initial results
from market trials indicating little demand for a new product, but entrepre-
The entrepreneurs' equity stakes are almost always junior to DEMO preferred equity position of
venture capital investors. The seniority of the venture capitalists' stake makes the entrepreneur's
payoff analogous to levered equity, DEMO it is also equivalent to a call option. Similarly, if the DEMO
is doing poorly and the option is "out of the money," entrepreneurs may have incentives to increase
risk substantially.

neurs may want to keep the company DEMO because they receive significant
private benefits from managing their own firm.
The nature of the firm's assets may have important implications for expected
DEMO costs and the structure of staged venture capital investments. The
capital structure literature motivates a search for those factors. Much of this
literature (see Harris and Raviv (1991)) has emphasized the role of agency
costs in determining leverage. Asset characteristics that increase expected
agency costs of debt DEMO leverage and make monitoring more valuable.
Therefore, factors reducing leverage should DEMO funding duration in ven-
ture capital transactions.
Williamson (1988) argues that leverage should be positively related to the
liquidation value of assets. Higher DEMO values imply that default is less
costly. Liquidation value is positively related to the tangibility of assets be-
cause tangible assets (e.g., machines DEMO plants) are on average easier to sell
and receive a higher DEMO of their book value than do intangible assets like
patents or copyrights. In empirical research on capital structure, many research-
ers including Titman and Wessels (1988), Friend and Lang (1988), and Rajan and
DEMO (1995) use the ratio of tangible assets to total assets as a measure
liquidation value. All find that use of debt increases with DEMO tangibility.
In the context of staged venture capital investments, intangible assets DEMO
be associated with greater agency costs. As assets become more tangible,
venture capitalists can recover more of their investment in liquidation, and
expected losses due to inefficient continuation are reduced. This reduces the
need to DEMO tightly and should increase funding duration.
Shleifer and Vishny (1992) extend Williamson's model by examining how
asset specificity might affect liquidation value DEMO debt levels. They show that
firms with assets that are highly industry- and firm-specific would use less
debt because asset specificity significantly reduces liquidation DEMO Firms
that have high R&D intensities likely generate assets that are very firm- and
industry-specific. Bradley, Jarrell, and Kim (1984) and DEMO and Wessels
(1988) use the ratio of R&D to sales to measure uniqueness of assets in
investigating the use of debt. Both DEMO a negative relationship between lever-
age and R&D intensity. Similarly, DEMO and Smith (1993) use the ratio of
R&D to firm value to explore debt maturity.
Asset specificity would also influence the structure DEMO staged venture capital
investments. Industries with high levels of R&D intensity would be subject to
greater discretionary investment by the entrepreneur and increase DEMO as-
sociated with firm- and industry-specific assets. These factors increase ex-
pected agency costs and shorten funding durations.
Finally, Myers (1977) argues that firms whose value is largely dependent
upon investment in future growth options DEMO make less use of debt because
the ownerlmanager can undertake investment strategies that are particularly
detrimental to bondholders. Myers suggests that a firm's DEMO ratio
may be related to the fraction of firm value that is comprised of future growth
opportunities. Empirical results support this prediction. Rajan and DEMO
(1995) find a negative relationship between firm market-to-book ratios and
Investment, Monitoring, and the Staging of Venture Capital

leverage. Similarly, Barclay and Smith (1995) find that debt maturity declines
with a DEMO's market-to-book ratio.
Entrepreneurs have more discretion to invest in personally beneficial strat-
egies at shareholders' expense in industries where firm value is largely depen-
dent upon future growth opportunities. Firms with high market-to-book ratios
are DEMO susceptible to these agency costs, thus increasing the value of mon-
DEMO and reducing funding duration.
Why can other financial intermediaries (e.g., banks) not do the same sort of
monitoring? First, because regulations limit banks' ability to hold shares, they
cannot use equity to fund DEMO Asset substitution becomes a problem if
banks provide debt financing for very high risk projects. Though several
papers focus on monitoring by banks (James (1987), Petersen and Rajan (1994,
1995), Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1991)), banks may not have the
necessary skills to evaluate projects with few collateralizable assets and sig-
nificant ex ante DEMO In addition, Petersen and Rajan (1995) argue that
banks in DEMO markets will be unable to finance high-risk projects
because they are unable to extract rents in subsequent transactions with the
company. Taking an equity DEMO in the firm allows ex post settling up,
guaranteeing that the venture capitalist benefits if the firm does well.
In addition, because the probability of failure is so high, venture capitalists
need a substantial fraction of the firm's equity in order to make a fair return
DEMO their portfolio of investments. Even if banks were to make loans to high-risk
firms, required interest payments would be extraordinarily high, creating
severe DEMO problems that would limit a firm's growth and exacerbate
risk-shifting problems. Finally, venture capital funds' high-powered compen-
sation schemes examined by Gompers DEMO Lerner (1995) give venture capital-
ists incentives to monitor firms more closely because their individual compen-
sation is closely linked to the funds' returns.
B. Venture Capital, Liquidity, and Investment
The growth of inflows DEMO new venture capital funds may also have effects on
the structure of investment. During the past twenty years, the venture capital
industry has gone through several fund raising cycles. Figure 1 shows the
amount of capital DEMO to new venture capital funds. During periods of
low fundraising, venture DEMO might be liquidity constrained. Liquidity
constraints and their effects on investment have been examined in several
contexts (Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988); Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharf-
stein (1991); Petersen and Rajan (1994)). Venture capitalists would like to
make more and bigger investments (which are positive NPV), but they are
unable to raise enough money to invest in all of these projects. If constraints
restrict investment, greater commitments to new funds lead venture capital-
ists to invest more DEMO per round and to invest more often.
Banks and their affiliates in other countries do venture capital-like financing (Sahlman
(1992)), but their ability to hold equity is critical.

Free cash flow theory (Jensen (1986)) also predicts that increases in com-
mitments to venture capital funds DEMO lead to larger investments and
shorter time between investments. Venture capitalists would try to put the
increased level of commitments to use. Free cash DEMO agency costs have been
documented by Blanchard, Lopez de Silanes, and Shleifer (1994), who provide
evidence that cash windfalls adversely affect companies' investment behavior.
Law suit winners seem to invest in bad projects rather than give cash to
shareholders. If free cash flow problems affect venture DEMO, more fre-
quent and larger investment implies venture capitalists may be DEMO
Similarly, growth of the venture capital pool may measure entry by DEMO
rienced venture capitalists. These new entrants may overinvest and may not
monitor companies as effectively as experienced venture capitalists. As in the
case of DEMO cash flow agency costs, the increase in investment is excessive.

A. Individual Firm Financing Information
A random sample4 of 794 firms that received venture capital financing
between January 1961 and July 1992 was DEMO from the Venture Econom-
*The random sample was generated as follows: DEMO the time the data were collected, approxi-
mately 7000 firms were DEMO in the Venture Economics database. Each firm is given a
number from 1to 7000 by Venture Economics. 800 unique random numbers were generated from
DEMO to 7000 in a spreadsheet. These 800 numbers were used as firm reference numbers. Six firms
were eliminated from the final sample because their DEMO were suspect. The six firms had venture
financing dates that were more than ten years apart. Apparently, for each of these six entries two
firms with the same name had been venture financed and their records DEMO

ics' Venture Intelligence Database, which collects funding information on
venture capital-backed firms. The firms were included in the sample if their
first round of venture capital DEMO occurred before January 1, 1990. This
ensured that I had data DEMO at least the first thirty months of the companies'
existence. Data collected included: 1)name of the company; 2) date founded;
3) present status; 4) total amount of venture capital funding to date; 5) dates
of individual fundings; 6) amount of capital DEMO in each stage; 7) iden-
tity of venture capital investors; DEMO) type of financing (e.g., seed, start-up, etc.);
9) industry code; and 10) date of IPO, if relevant.
The DEMO status of each firm was verified with Lexismexis databases.
COMPANY and NEWS databases were searched for all records concerning the
firms. If no news DEMO or legal filings were found, the firm was assumed to
be DEMO The data are limited in several respects. First, I do not DEMO how
well each company is doing at each round of financing. Second, the data do not
have information on other types of financing that the firms receive.
B. Venture Capital Funds Information
I utilize a database DEMO venture capital funds compiled by Venture Economics'
Investors Services Group to collect annual information on total venture capital
funds under management, new capital commitments to the industry, and
the amount of venture capital invested. The Venture Economics' database
includes over two thousand venture capital funds, Small DEMO Investment
Companies (SBICs), and related organizations and is used in DEMO of
directories such as their annual volume Venture Capital Performance. This
database is compiled from information provided by venture capitalists and
institutional investors.
C. DEMO and Macroeconomic Data
Because accounting data for private firms is unavailable, DEMO collect annual
SIC industry averages from COMPUSTAT for each firm that received venture
capital financing to control for industry effects. If the four digit DEMO
Industrial Classification (SIC) group had fewer than four companies, the DEMO
digit industry was used. Similarly, if the three digit group had DEMO than four
companies, I collected the two digit SIC group averages. DEMO were col-
lected to calculate various measures of asset tangibility (the DEMO of tangible
assets to total assets), growth opportunities (market value DEMO equity to book
value), and research intensity (either the ratio DEMO R&D expenditures to total
assets or R&D expenditures to sales). The data were matched by date and
industry to each firm DEMO each round of financing. The inflation rate and real
return on Treasury bills and common stocks were collected for each month
from 1961 to DEMO from Ibbotson Associates.

DEMO I1 looks at the distribution of investments across various industries by
the percentage of rounds invested. Industry trends can be discerned. Computer
firms received DEMO amounts of financing from 1982 to 1984, but invest-
ment subsequently DEMO After the oil embargoes of the 1970s, energy
related investments were DEMO; these declined substantially after the early
1980s when domestic exploration declined. DEMO the other hand, medical and
health related firms have been receiving DEMO attention from venture
capitalists.
What is evident from the industry results, DEMO, is the focus on high
technology firms (e.g., communication, computers, electronics, biotechnology,
and medicallhealth). The percentage of venture capital DEMO is high tech-
nology firms never falls below 70 percent of annual investments. For firms in
the sample, the average industry ratio of R&D to sales is 3.43 percent (median
3.82 percent). The average for all COMPUSTAT industries during the time
period 1972-1992 was 1.30 percent (median 2.66 percent). Asymmetric infor-
mation and agency costs are a DEMO concern in R&D intensive firms which
may require specialized knowledge to monitor. Industry investment composi-

The Journal of Finance
tion suggests that venture capitalists specialize in DEMO in which moni-
toring and information evaluation are important.
Table I1 also examines the distribution of investment by stage.6 The table
documents the relative DEMO in early stage financing and the growing im-
portance of later stage investments. This trend reflects the effects of a matur-
ing industry. While DEMO venture capital industry was growing rapidly in the
early 1980s, more DEMO went to early stage companies. As the industry
matured, the investment DEMO reflected previous investments. Early stage
investments in the mid-1980s became late stage investments in the late 1980s.
Even with the decline, a substantial fraction of investment is in early stage
companies where monitoring is important.
The DEMO of outcomes for firms that received venture capital financ-
ing is examined in Table 111. Firms can go public (IPO), undergo a merger or
acquisition, file for bankruptcy, or remain private as of July DEMO, 1992. For
purposes of Table 111, I classify only those firms that had not received a venture
capital infusion since January 1, 1988 as venture-backed firms that remain
private. Other firms may yet receive another DEMO capital investment or
may achieve some other exit (e.g., IPO, DEMO, etc.) While this measure is
imprecise, and it is impossible DEMO be certain of the eventual status of all
projects, the present DEMO gives some indication of relative outcomes.
Such a determination is critical if research is to determine how investment
structure affects a firm's success.
DEMO I11 shows that in the entire sample 22.5 percent of the firms go public,
23.8 percent merge or are acquired, 15.6 percent are liquidated or go bankrupt,
and 38.1 percent remain private. In transportation, biotechnology, and medi-
calkealth, the proportion of firms that go public DEMO quite high. This may reflect
either the relative success of companies in this industry or their need for large
capital infusions which an IPO DEMO In electronic components, industrial
products, and other (services), the DEMO of IPOs is quite low and many
more firms remain private. These results may understate the proportion of
liquidations, however. First, some of DEMO acquisitionslmergers may be dis-
tressed firms that provide little more than physical assets to their a~quirer.~
The return to the venture capitalist from these DEMO would be very low.
Similarly, a number of the firms classified DEMO private may have been liqui-
dated, but I was unable to DEMO any record of the event. Firms without any
debt would have no need to file for bankruptcy.
Funding statistics by industry and outcome are DEMO in Table IV.
Average total funding received, number of rounds, and age at first funding
show considerable variability across industries. High technology ventures
DEMO more rounds and greater total financing than low technology ventures.
"Rounds DEMO classified as early stage if the investment is seed, startup, or early stage. The
investment is classified as late stage if it is DEMO, second, third, or bridge financing.
Initial public offerings and acquisitions DEMO also be viewed as one large financing round.
Examining the amount of venture capital invested, classifying firms by outcome, is still important
for DEMO the venture capitalists' return.

companies need access to venture capital soon after incorporation. Biotechnol-
ogy, electronic components, and medicallhealth companies are relatively

A. The Duration and Size of Financing Rounds
The analysis in this section classifies each financing according to the
company's DEMO of development at the time of financing as reported by
Venture Economics (e.g., seed, startup, first stage, etc.) This information is
DEMO by venture capital firms. There are no clear divisions between
the definitions of each stage, so divisions should be seen as relative mea-
sures of firm development rather than absolute measures. To overcome
some of the DEMO reporting biases in the regression results, I group
various stages into DEMO early rounds, middle rounds, or late rounds. I

classify all seed and startup investments as early rounds. These invest-
ments DEMO usually made in very young companies. First stage and early
stage investments are classified as middle rounds because even though the
firms are still DEMO young, they are further developed than seed or
startup companies. Finally, second, third, expansion, or bridge stage fund-
ing is considered to be late stage financing.
Table V summarizes average duration, amount of venture capital funding,
and the rate at which the firm uses cash DEMO that particular round (in
dollars per year) for various types of investment. In general, the duration of
financing declines for later stage companies and the average amount of financ-
ing per round generally rises. Venture DEMO may know more about later
stage firms and may therefore be willing to invest more money and for longer
periods of time. Later stage DEMO would be associated with lower agency
costs. Similarly, the rate of DEMO utilization rises for later stage firms. Cash
utilization rates for later rounds might be higher because the need for invest-

ment in DEMO and working capital accelerates as the scale of the project
expandss
Regression results in Table VI present a clearer picture of the factors
affecting DEMO capital staging patterns. The regressions include dummy
variables to control for early and middle stage financing using the Venture
Economics classifications for type of DEMO The regressions also include
industry accounting variables to control for the nature of the firm's assets and
investment opportunities. Because private firm balance DEMO data is unavail-
able, industry averages from COMPUSTAT should be viewed DEMO instruments
for the private firms' true values. To the extent that DEMO of the coefficients on
the industry variables are significant, significance levels DEMO firms' true values
are probably even higher.
From the previous discussion, firms that are subject to greater agency costs
should be monitored more DEMO, and funding durations should be shorter. The
ratio of tangible assets DEMO total assets for the industry should be related to the
liquidation value of the firm. The coefficient on the ratio of tangible assets to
DEMO assets should be positive in regressions for the duration of financing
rounds. Tangible assets lower expected agency costs of inefficient continuation.
The market-to-book ratio DEMO rise as the fraction of growth options in firm
value rises. Because potential agency costs associated with investment behav-
ior rise with growth options, the coefficient on the market-to-book ratio should
be negative. I also include DEMO measures of research and development inten-
sity, R&D expenditure to DEMO and R&D expenditure to total assets. R&D
intensive firms are likely to accumulate physical and intellectual capital that
is very industry- and DEMO As asset specificity increases, so do ex-
pected losses in liquidation. DEMO, coefficients on R&D measures should
be negative in the duration DEMO
I also include firm age when it receives venture financing. Older firms may
have more information available for venture capitalists to evaluate. Therefore,
DEMO stage of development and all else constant, informational asymmetries
are smaller DEMO the funding duration should be longer (i.e., the coefficient on
age should be positive in the duration regressions).
Finally, I measure the effects of venture capital market growth on financing
using the amount of DEMO (in constant 1992 dollars) raised by venture capital
funds in the year before the financing of the firm. If venture capitalists cannot
make DEMO the investments they would like because they have insufficient
capital, more DEMO should decrease the duration of financing (firms receive
follow-on funding sooner) and increase the amount of funding per round.
A second possibility is DEMO only poorly performing firms receive later rounds of financing
(profitable firms DEMO their own cash). The higher cash utilization rate indicates a selection
bias caused by selecting poor performers. Evidence from the sample of 127 DEMO going public
indicates that the selection bias is not a problem. Successful firms have higher cash utilization
rates.
The results are unchanged if firm DEMO is measured by using round number (e.g., first
investment, second DEMO, etc.) instead of dummies for early, middle, and late stage firms.
1478 The Journal of Finance
The dependent variable in Panel A is DEMO duration of a particular venture
financing round, the time in years DEMO one particular financing to the next.
The estimation of regressions with duration data introduces certain method-
ological issues. First, the data is right censored: we only observe the duration
of financing when a subsequent financing occurs. A subsequent financing
might not be observed for two reasons: firms may be in the middle of an

variables include a dummy variable that equals 1 if the funding round is either seed or startup
(early stage) and a dummy variable that equals 1if the round is either early, first, or other early
(middle stage). Liquidity in the venture capital industry is controlled using new capital commit-
ments to DEMO capital partnerships in the previous year in constant 1992 dollars. Tangibility of
assets is measured by the average ratio of tangible assets to total DEMO for company's in the firm's
industry. Market-to-book is the average industry ratio of market value of equity to book value of
equity. DEMO and development intensity is proxied by the average industry ratios of R&D to
sales or R&D to assets. The age of the DEMO capital-backed firm is months from incorporation
to financing date. Panel A are maximum-likelihood estimates for Weibull distribution duration

ongoing financing round or firms might not receive another investment be-
cause they went bankrupt, went public, or were acquired. Models of unem-
ployment (Lancaster (1979, DEMO)) deal with similar censoring. I utilize dura-
tion data techniques used in unemployment estimation, surveyed in Kiefer
(1988).
A firm is DEMO to have a certain probability of receiving financing in each
period. The instantaneous probability of receiving financing is called the
hazard rate, h (DEMO). h(t ) is defined as:
h(t) = DEMO of receiving funding between t and t + At
Probability of receiving funding after t
To estimate the duration model, assumptions about the distribution of the
hazard rate must be made. The two most common distributions DEMO in
duration models are the Weibull and exponential distributions. The Weibull
distribution offers two advantages. First, the time dependency of the hazard
rate can be estimated. Second, the likelihood function for the Weibull model
can be easily modified to allow for censored data. Other distributional assump-
tions (e.g., exponential or normal) were estimated and did not affect the

is the baseline hazard function.
Coefficients Po, PI, . . . are estimated via maximum likelihood estimators.
These coefficients yield DEMO of the probability that the firm receives
financing in a particular month given values of the independent variables
(including time from last investment). The resulting estimates from the
Weibull regressions can be presented in multiple DEMO Table VI and Table
VIII present the model in log expected time parameterization, i.e., for given
values of the independent variables, the model gives the logarithm of the
expected time to refinancing. The interpretation of DEMO is straightfor-
ward, positive coefficients imply longer financing duration on average. DEMO
versely, negative coefficients imply shorter expected durations.
The results of Table DEMO are generally consistent with the implications of an
informational and agency cost explanation for staged venture capital infu-
sions. In Panel A, financing duration declines with decreases in the industry
ratio of tangible assets to total DEMO, increases in the market-to-book ratio,
and greater R&D intensity. DEMO coefficients are significant between the seven
and one percent confidence levels. These factors are associated with greater
agency costs of investment and liquidation and DEMO lead to tighter
monitoring.
The age of the venture-backed firm at the time of financing is positively and
significantly related to financing duration. More DEMO may be available
for venture capitalists to evaluate older projects. One might also expect that
larger financing rounds lead to longer funding duration. That DEMO not the case.
None of the coefficients on amount of venture financing are significant. The
results indicate that industry- and firm-specific factors are important DEMO de-
termining the financing duration independent of the investment size.
Finally, DEMO regressions (5)and (6),I include all industry accounting variables
DEMO to determine which of the asset measures are relatively more impor-
tant. The ratio of tangible assets to total assets remains the most significant
DEMO Market-to-book drops out completely. Higher R&D intensities still
reduce funding duration, but size and significance of the coefficients are
reduced when the other asset measures are included. The results indicate that
tangible assets may be DEMO important in lowering expected agency
costs.
Panel B examines factors affecting the size of the venture round. The
dependent variable is the logarithm of DEMO size of the financing round, in
thousands of 1992 dollars. The DEMO of tangible assets to total assets has the
greatest effect on the amount of financing. Increases in tangibility increase the
amount of financing per DEMO More R&D intensive industries also appear to
receive more financing per round controlling for tangibility.
Investment, Monitoring, and the Staging of Venture Capital
1481
Panel A DEMO shows that the duration of early and middle stage financings
are not significantly different from late stage financings. The stage of devel-
opment does, however, affect the amount of financing per round. Results from
regressions in Panel B show that average early stage investments are between
$1.30 and DEMO million smaller than comparable late stage investments.
Similarly, middle stage investments DEMO on average $0.70 to $1.21 million
smaller than late stage investments. The increasing size of investment per
round reflects the growing scale of a DEMO Greater investment is needed to
expand the firm.
The duration of financing and the amount of funding per round is also
sensitive to the DEMO in the venture capital industry. Greater commitments
of capital to new venture funds reduces duration of financing and increases
financing amount per round. A DEMO standard deviation increase in new com-
mitments to venture capital funds decreases funding duration by two months
and increases the average funding by almost DEMO,000.
If venture capitalists are capital rationed, larger cash commitments allow
DEMO capitalists to invest more often in positive NPV projects and with
larger cash infusions. If venture capitalists are susceptible to free cash flow
agency DEMO, they might waste the extra cash by investing more, and more
often, in bad projects. Similarly, the growth in new and inexperienced DEMO
managers during the mid-1980s could have led to a deterioration in invest-
ment quality and monitoring. Sahlman and Stevenson's (1987) case study DEMO
the computer disk drive industry shows that venture capital investment in
certain industries during the early and middle 1980s might have been exces-
sive. DEMO period coincides with the dramatic increase in commitments to
venture capital funds and might indicate that either free cash flow agency
costs or venture DEMO inexperience is a more likely explanation for the
investment sensitivity to fundraising during this period of rapid entry.
B. Total Venture Financing and Number DEMO Rounds
Data on total venture capital invested and the number of rounds provide
another measure of monitoring intensity. Table VII presents results for both
DEMO Included in the regressions are three dummy variables for the
outcome of venture financing: a dummy variable that equals one if the firm
went public, another dummy variable that equals one if the firm was liqui-
dated or filed for bankruptcy, and a third dummy variable that takes the value
one for all firms that are acquired or merge with DEMO company. Coefficients
on these dummies provide information about the impact of monitoring for
projects of varying success.
The dependent variable in Panel A is DEMO logarithm of the total amount of
venture financing that the firm received. The results show that firms that go
public receive between $3.36 and DEMO million more venture capital financing
than firms that remain private. There is no difference in the total funding for
those firms that are acquired DEMO those that are liquidated compared to firms
The Journal of
Finance
that remain private. Even controlling for the number DEMO financing rounds,
firms that eventually go public receive more total financing.
The results in Panel B for the number of financing rounds confirm DEMO
results. Because the dependent variable is non-negative and ordinal, I esti-
DEMO Poisson regressions for the number of rounds received. Firms that go
public receive more financing rounds than those that remain private, while
firms that are acquired or go bankrupt do not receive more rounds on average
DEMO those that remain private.

Regression for Total Venture Capital Funding and Number of
Rounds of Financing
The sample is 794 venture capital-backed DEMO for the period 1961 to 1992. The dependent
variables are the total venture capital funding that the firm received in thousands of 1992 dollars

variable that equals 1 if the firm completed an initial public DEMO, a dummy variable that
equals 1 if the firm filed for DEMO, and a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm was

ratio of tangible assets to total assets for companies in DEMO firm's industry. Market-to-book is the
average industry ratio of market value of equity to book value of equity. Research and development

tial to go public, the venture capitalist continues to fund DEMO project. If the
project is viable but has little potential to go public, the venture capitalist
quickly searches for a corporate buyer. Firms that have little potential are
liquidated.
Industry factors appear to have an important DEMO on total funding re-
ceived. Panel A shows that firms in industries with more tangible assets
receive less total financing. Firms in industries with DEMO market-to-book
ratios receive more total financing. Similarly, R&D intensive industries DEMO
ceive significantly greater amounts of financing.
The most important factor influencing total venture financing is the number
of financing rounds the firm has received. DEMO fact, when the number of financ-
ing rounds is included in DEMO with industry variables, tangibility of
assets and R&D intensity are DEMO longer significant. The coefficient on industry
market-to-book ratio is unchanged, however. DEMO controlling for the number
of financing rounds, firms in industries with DEMO market-to-book ratios re-
ceive more total venture funding. If market-to-book measures the potential
profitability of investment and growth opportunities, investment should be
relatively higher in industries that have more growth opportunities. Similarly,
The Journal of Finance
firms in high market-to-book industries may have less DEMO to debt financing
and may therefore rely more on venture capital.
Panel B shows that tangibility of assets and R&D intensity do indeed DEMO
through the number of financing rounds. Firms in industries with a greater
fraction of tangible assets receive fewer rounds of venture financing. Similarly,
DEMO in R&D intensive industries receive more rounds of financing.
Overall, DEMO evidence suggests that venture capitalists are concerned about
the lack of entrepreneurial incentive to terminate projects when it becomes
clear that projects will fail. DEMO capitalists minimize agency costs by
infusing capital more often. As asset tangibility and liquidation value increase,
venture capitalists can recover more of their DEMO if liquidation occurs, and
the need to monitor declines. By gathering DEMO, venture capitalists
determine whether projects are likely to succeed and continue DEMO only
those that have high potential.
IV. Alternative Explanations
While the results from Section I11 are consistent with predictions from
agency theory, alternative explanations may explain the results. Cost of mon-
itoring may affect investment structure DEMO the efficacy of interim moni-
toring. Tangible assets may be easy to monitor without formal evaluation. A
venture capitalist can tell if a machine DEMO still bolted to the floor. If costs of
monitoring are very low, the venture capitalist may choose to have long
financing rounds to avoid costs of writing new contracts. At the same time,
venture capitalists DEMO monitor the firm more often between capital infu-
sions. Easier interim monitoring would reduce expected agency costs between
financing rounds and, hence, increase DEMO duration.
Both monitoring and agency costs are important. Conversations with prac-
titioners, however, indicate that they normally make continuation decisions
when a new DEMO round occurs. Venture capitalists evaluate a firm based
upon performance progress, DEMO whether a machine is still bolted down. Future
work should examine the importance of monitoring costs in determining in-
vestment structure and the frequency DEMO monitoring.
The relation between funding duration and the nature of firm assets may
also be driven by differences between high technology and low technology
DEMO High technology firms may naturally pass through more milestones.
Because industry measures like the ratio of tangible assets to total assets,
market-to-book, and R&D intensity are highly correlated with high technology
and low technology DEMO, shorter funding duration may be correlated with
these measures. The coefficients DEMO Table VI would measure the amount of
information revealed over time and the number of benchmarks used to eval-
uate the firm. The more DEMO that is revealed, the more often the project
is reevaluated.
If DEMO alternative of technology-driven milestones is true, then coefficients on
asset measures DEMO be driven by the difference between high technology and
low technology industries. If we rerun the duration regressions within tech-
Investment, Monitoring, and the Staging of Venture Capi.tal

nology groups, the effect of asset tangibility, industry market-to-book ratios,
and R&D intensities should be much less important. Table VIII presents
Weibull distribution maximum DEMO estimates for each technology co-
hort. In Panel A, the sample DEMO high technology firms which include commu-
nications, computers, computer related, DEMO, electronic components, other
electronics, biotechnology, and medical equipment companies. The sample in
Panel B is low technology firms, which include medical services, energy,
consumer products, industrial products, transportation, and other (primarily
services) companies.
The coefficients on industry asset measures are surprisingly similar for the
high technology and low technology cohorts and both have estimates that DEMO
close to the estimates for the entire sample. It is impossible to reject the
hypothesis that the coefficients for the tangibility of assets, market-to-book
ratio, and the R&D intensity are equal across types of industries. The simi-
larity of the coefficients shows that the relation between duration DEMO asset
measures is consistent within industrial classifications as well. In unreported
regressions, finer industry divisions had no qualitative effect on the coefficients.
The one major difference between the two groups is the effect of firm age.
DEMO age of the firm receiving financing does not have an effect on the financing
duration for high technology firms but has a significantly positive DEMO in the
low technology cohort. Firm age may be more important in measuring poten-
tial asymmetric information for low technology firms but may have DEMO a
small impact on asymmetric information for high technology companies.
While alternative explanations may help explain some of the results, con-
versations with venture capitalists indicate that they are concerned about the
entrepreneur's continuation decisions DEMO strategy choices. Results in Section
I11 are consistent with venture capitalists' DEMO concern that entrepreneurs
have private information about future viability of the firm, that they always
want to continue, and that entrepreneurs may want DEMO enrich their reputation
through activities at investors' expense.
V. Conclusion
Corporate DEMO is a fundamental concern of investors. If individuals knew
all potential outcomes, state-contingent contracts would be able to solve any
potential agency cost. But such complete knowledge does not exist, and inves-
tors must minimize potential agency costs. Mechanisms in financial contracts
between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs directly DEMO for potential
agency costs and private information associated with high-risk, high-return

This paper has demonstrated that the staging of venture capital invest-
ments can be understood in an agency and monitoring framework. Results
from a DEMO of venture capital-backed companies are consistent with the
predictions presented. Venture capitalists are concerned that entrepreneurs

present value for shareholders. Entrepreneurs may also pursue DEMO that
enrich their reputation at shareholders' expense. Agency costs increase with
DEMO asset tangibility, increasing growth options, and greater asset spec-
ificity. Venture capitalists monitor entrepreneurs with increasing frequency as
expected agency costs rise.

Regressions for Duration Controlling for Firm and Industry Factors
with the Sample Split into High Technology and
Low Technology Companies
The sample is 2143 DEMO rounds for 794 venture capital-backed firms for the period 1961 to
1992. The dependent variable is the time in years from funding date to DEMO next funding date.
Independent variables include a dummy variable that equals 1if the funding round is either seed
or startup (early stage) and DEMO dummy variable that equals 1if the round is either early, first, or
other early (middle stage). Liquidity in the venture capital industry is controlled using new capital
commitments to venture capital partnerships in the DEMO year in constant 1992 dollars.
Tangibility of assets is measured by the average ratio of tangible assets to total assets for
company's in DEMO firm's industry. Market-to-book is the average industry ratio of market value of
equity to book value of equity. Research and development intensity is DEMO by the average
industry ratios of R&D to sales or R&D to assets. The age of the venture capital-backed firm is
months DEMO incorporation to financing date. All regressions are maximum-likelihood estimates
for Weibull distribution duration models. t-statistics for coefficients are in parentheses.

Dependent Variable: Duration of Financing Round
The evidence indicates DEMO venture capitalists use their industry knowledge
and monitoring skills to finance projects with significant uncertainty. Venture
capitalists concentrate investment in early-stage companies and high DEMO
ogy industries. Results also demonstrate that the duration of financing is
related to the nature of the firm's assets. Higher industry ratios of DEMO
assets to total assets, lower market-to-book ratios, and lower R&D intensities
are associated with longer funding duration. Firms that go public have DEMO
ceived significantly more financing and a greater number of rounds than have
firms that are acquired or liquidated.
This paper raises several interesting questions DEMO future research. Because
large firms also engage in projects that compete with investments by venture
capitalists, comparing the structure and timing of investment of large corpo-
rations with those of venture capitalists might shed light on DEMO comparative
advantage of each. What implications does the structure of venture capital
investment have on the future performance of new business and established
firms? Can the structure of investment increase the probability that an entre-
preneurial DEMO ends up like Apple Computer, Genentech, or Microsoft?
Cross-sectional and time series effects of firm- and industry-specific factors on
The Journal of Finance
the outcome of investment (e.g., IPO, merger, bankruptcy, or remaining pri-
vate) need to be examined.
The effect of growth in the venture capital industry on investment should be
investigated DEMO Do free cash flow costs, liquidity constraints, or the entry
of inexperienced venture capitalists better describe venture capitalists' re-
sponse to changes in capital commitments to new funds through the 1980s?
Does the fund DEMO ability of the venture capitalist affect only the size of the
investment or does it lead to softer benchmarks as well?
The data DEMO this paper is limited because it examines only venture capital
equity financing. Most venture capital-backed firms receive some financing
before they tap venture capital. DEMO are these sources and how significant are
they? "Angels," wealthy individuals that invest in entrepreneurial ventures,
are one source. Family and DEMO are also major contributors. Bank lending
may be important in certain industries, but very high risk companies might
not have access to debt financing. Future work should examine appropriate
sources of capital for new firms and DEMO those sources change as the firm
evolves. Determining the relationship among sources of capital for startup
enterprises would be pivotal in understanding the genesis DEMO new firms.
