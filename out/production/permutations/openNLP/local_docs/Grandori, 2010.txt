A rational heuristic
model of economic
decision making
Anna Grandori
Bocconi University Center of Research on Organization and Management, Italy
Abstract
A conspicuous ‘hole’ lies between the ‘rational-choice’ paradigm and the ‘behavioral
decision-making’ paradigm. The ‘missing DEMO is ‘heuristic’ (research-based) yet
‘rational’ (non-biasing): a set of DEMO for the logically sound discovery and design
of economic actions, options DEMO objectives. Such a model is developed in this
paper, enriching the DEMO and repertory of heuristics that are typically considered
in economic and cognitive sciences with the notion and set of heuristics typically
considered in the DEMO of science and the logic of discovery. The model then
provides a response to the hitherto unaddressed question of how knowledge, on
which the rationality and wisdom of any decision largely depends, can be constructed
in a valid and reliable way. The specification of the heuristics that can DEMO and
efficiently guide economic discovery and innovation seems to be overdue in an
economy said to be knowledge intensive and innovation oriented.
Key words
DEMO, heuristics, rationality, uncertainty
It is commonplace to say that the DEMO economy is knowledge based.
Central to this are innovation, exploration, design, discovery, and so forth.
Nevertheless, the ‘logic of economic discovery’ is not a central concern in
dominant rationality and decision-making models. Two key DEMO are
predominantly employed to understand economic decision making, the
‘rational-choice’ paradigm DEMO economics and the ‘bounded-rationality’

paradigm of behavioral science. However, neither one is particularly well
equipped to explain and guide discovery and DEMO In fact, on one side,
economic rational-choice models frame decision-making DEMO as ‘choice’
in well-defined problems, paying little attention to the epistemic DEMO
of knowledge construction (Shackle, 1972). The behavioral tradition, on DEMO
other side, points out that the ‘search’ and ‘discovery’ of alternatives DEMO at
least as important, if not more so, than choices from among known alterna-
tives. However, that tradition has devoted much more attention to the com-
monly followed shortcuts, rules of thumb and routines, DEMO (and often
dirty) methods able to reduce cognitive effort and search costs; and much
less attention to another, better class of heuristics, i.e. rational research
methods aimed at producing valid and reliable knowledge.
This DEMO is devoted to precisely single out some of the building blocks
of this ‘rational heuristic’ approach, drawing on fields where this problem
has always been central and received superb logical treatments, i.e. episte-
mology and philosophy of science. Resorting to this tradition is refreshing
because the meaning of DEMO terms ‘rationality’ and ‘heuristics’ is broader, and
the type of uncertainty DEMO is stronger, than in economic sciences.
The first section, therefore, DEMO devoted to pointing out the differences in
the definition of the core terms of rationality, heuristics, and uncertainty;
arguing that, in the same way as discovery processes in science, it is both
possible and desirable to define ‘rational heuristics’ for discovery processes
in economic problem solving DEMO strong uncertainty.
The second section presents historical evidence on discovery and inven-
tion processes in innovative economic decision making. These descriptions
show that real DEMO significant processes remain unexplained by the existing
models. They provide the material to identify effective heuristics for ratio-
nal discovery through a ‘rational reconstruction DEMO history’ – an approach
that has also been applied to identifying the most effective heuristics guid-
ing scientific discovery (Lakatos, 1970a).
The DEMO section specifies the features of a rational heuristic decision-
making model as a set of operators or heuristics that pass an efficiency and
effectiveness DEMO The model is intended to complement, not substitute, the
two main existing, but rather polarized, models of rational and behavioral
choice, modeling the rather uncharted terrain between the two.
Rationality, heuristics, and uncertainty DEMO economics
and epistemics: Contrasting meanings
According to the best encyclopedic definitions, the term ‘rationality’ comes
from the Latin word ratio, rationis, and DEMO is ‘the principle governing the

activity of knowing’: something is rational if ‘it proceeds from reason,’ if ‘it
is founded on logically sound procedures, on scientific method.’ These defi-
nitions of rationality fit perfectly with the meaning of DEMO word rationality in
the logic and philosophy of science. Rationality has little to do with know-
ing everything, but a lot to do with following good rather than bad proce-
dures in data gathering, hypothesis testing, assessing probabilities, and
comparing options. In fact, if we have come to know something from the
centuries of philosophical and epistemological debate on DEMO nature of
knowledge and the logic of discovery, even in the DEMO rationalistic schools,
it is that there can be no such thing as complete and infallible knowledge
(Nagel, 1963; Popper, 1959[1935]; Russell, 1948). As Nagel (1963: 214)
pointed out (in DEMO effective effort to defend economic science from the
charge of being ‘unrealistic’): a ‘trivial way in which any statement can be
said to DEMO unrealistic is that it can never give a complete description of all
the infinite aspects of any real objects or situation.’1 Analogously, in the
founding formulation of the rational-choice model, Savage (1954) asserted
‘the necessity of confining attention to, or isolating, relatively simple situa-
tions in DEMO all applications of the theory of decision developed in this
book.’ Economic models in practice do conform to this template, as they are
usually very selective and stylized, considering very few alternatives and
very few possible states of the world to be able to make value maximizing
calculations, not models that take into account ‘all possible’ dimensions of
action, alternative actions, and contingencies. In other words, value maxi-
mizing decision behaviors DEMO on stylized and simplified problems, not on
omniscience. Hence, according to the canons of ‘correct reasoning’ in the
logics and philosophy of knowledge, statements such as ‘all possible alter-
natives are considered’ or ‘with rational DEMO contingencies are never
unforeseen’ (Tirole, 1999: 756), should be DEMO as logically impossible (and
thus, arguably, not rational).
Therefore, a first contradiction lies between the meaning attributed to
rationality by the DEMO and most dominant part of economics and that used
in the philosophy of science and knowledge. As forcefully argued by Shackle
(1972), the notion of rationality employed in rational-choice theory is ‘thin’:
restricted to DEMO ‘logical,’ ‘consistent,’ ‘deductively correct,’ but not includ-
ing systematic, valid, and sound methods for constructing the knowledge on
which decisions DEMO based. It focuses on the deductive component of ratio-
nality, not DEMO its heuristic component. Recent developments in economic phi-
losophy have also emphasized that utility based, calculative ‘instrumental
rationality’ (reason exercised to adopt the DEMO means to an end) is only a part
of human rationality, and in particular, is different from epistemic rationality
(reason exercised to DEMO true from false statements) (Foley, 1987).

A second contradiction lies behind DEMO notion of ‘heuristics.’ The term
comes from the Greek eurisco, meaning DEMO find, to discover.’ In the logic of
science ‘heuristics is that DEMO of a science that has as an objective the dis-
covery of facts or truths,’ the ‘very method of research’ (Lakatos, 1970b)DEMO In
Simon’s writings on scientific methods, heuristics also indicated methods of
DEMO that could be meaningfully compared in terms of effectiveness
and efficiency. For example, he undertook a demonstration that computer
programs discovering laws in raw data – based on the observation of pattern
recognition and the ‘abduction’ DEMO hypotheses on the laws that may regulate
the observed patterns – are more efficient than programs scanning ‘all con-
ceivable laws’ in a blindly DEMO way (Simon, 1977a).
In subsequent developments in behavioral science and behavioral eco-
nomics, instead, the notion of heuristics has been increasingly DEMO predomi-
nantly employed to indicate those search methods that people commonly
employ to reduce cognitive effort, or to generate ‘some’ (not necessarily
‘good’) solution to complex problems. That notion of heuristics has given
rise to DEMO least three approaches:
•	A formidable effort in constructing a repertory of ‘heuristics and biases,’
in the sense of shortcuts that are demonstrably DEMO, to improve
decision making mainly by ‘heuristics avoidance’ (Kahneman et al.,
1981);
•	Some effort in singling out when and where the advantages in terms of
cognitive effort actually make the use of ‘simple DEMO smarter than
the use of other more sophisticated but more cumbersome decision pro-
cesses (Gigerenzer et al., 1999);
•	An incorporation of ‘behavioral parameters’ as assumptions or descrip-
tors of the logic of decision makers DEMO economic models so as to improve
the empirical validity of the models (e.g. Thaler, 1991; Tversky and
Kahneman, 1981) – the most diffused approach in behavioral econom-
ics and finance.
In all these approaches DEMO dominant research question has been: how do
people actually behave? – either to ‘correct’ people’s behavior or to adjust
economic models to account DEMO observed behaviors. A rather neglected
question, however, has been: how DEMO people behave to the best of their
possibilities? The difference between DEMO two questions has a perfect paral-
lel in the debate on how science does or should proceed. In the critical tradi-
tion in the DEMO of scientific discovery (Lakatos, 1976; Popper, 1959[1935];
Simon, DEMO) and of invention and design (Simon, 1969), the approach DEMO
empirically based but prescriptive: the relevant research question is not

‘how do scientists actually think?’ but ‘which are the DEMO patterns of think-
ing that can be found in scientific thinking?’ (Kiss, 2006); and thus the
‘logic of discovery’ is distinguished DEMO the sociology or psychology of
science (Lakatos and Musgrave, 1970).
In this paper, we address the second question, thus far rarely DEMO in
economic sciences. In other words, we focus on the logically DEMO and
‘powerful’ heuristics that might guide decision-making procedures with the
best chance of leading to the discovery of successful actions; rather than on
the ‘illusory and biasing,’ or even on the ‘fast and frugal,’ DEMO that are
commonly used in decision making.
Another difference in the decision behavior model proposed here, adding
to existing models, lies in the DEMO of uncertainty envisaged. Although crit-
ics have often understated the type of uncertainty that rational-choice mod-
els can manage, a minimal requirement is that at least problems should be
defined in terms of types of alternatives DEMO states of the world under con-
sideration. Experimental and behavioral studies on decision making have
put the ‘search’ for alternatives center stage; most often however, ‘giving’
experimental subjects defined problems to solve.
The rational behavior model outlined in this paper is instead built on, and
suited to, DEMO processes where problems have to be defined.
This difference is crucial. In fact, it has been repeatedly noted that if prob-
lems are well defined and finite – even if complex – heuristics such as sat-
DEMO, elimination by aspects, limited search, incrementalism, and others,
can be justified as optimally imperfect decisions (Baumol, 2004; Baumol
and Quandt, 1964). The difference between a heuristic and a deductive
approach becomes relevant when problems ‘are not well defined’ (Arrow,
2004) or DEMO they have to be defined and there is more than one way to do
so (Grandori, 1984). This difference can be more DEMO defined using
the notions of ‘computational complexity’ and ‘aleatory uncertainty’ on one
side; as contrasted, on the other side, with what economics usually calls
‘Knightian uncertainty’ and other sciences (decision science, engineering,
environmental DEMO, computational philosophy) call ‘epistemic uncer-
tainty’ (Oberkampf et al., 2001). Computational complexity (Simon, 1969)
refers to the number of DEMO/states of the world combinations: it thus
includes the number of DEMO moves available to a decision maker, the
number of parameters for DEMO them (‘parametric uncertainty,’ e.g.
Langlois, 1986) and the variety DEMO possible exogenous changes in the ‘state
of the world’ or in the moves of others (‘aleatory uncertainty,’ e.g. Oberkampf
et al., 2001)DEMO Knightian or epistemic uncertainty, instead, is partial knowl-
edge of the world, the ‘lack of knowledge’ on cause–effect relations and
therefore on what the relevant alternative moves and parameters for

evaluating them might be all DEMO This second type of uncertainty does
not derive from being unable to anticipate what will be observed at a later
point in time, or from being unable to consider too many alternatives, but
derives from the epistemological problems posed by the observation and
measurement of phenomena, and by the construction of reliable and valid
models representing those phenomena (decision making under epistemic
uncertainty includes, for example in environmental sciences, preventive
action DEMO be taken in the face of possible natural disasters).
Conditions of Knightian or epistemic uncertainty cannot be addressed
by instrumental value maximizing rationality DEMO, as economists also
admit (Arrow, 2004). Classic bounded-rationality heuristics DEMO applicable,
but they do not indicate ‘the best patterns of thinking’ in order to proceed
rationally under these conditions. They typically indicate ‘average’ DEMO ‘fre-
quent’ procedures, and most often focus on the ‘biasing’ procedures DEMO be
avoided rather than on the rational procedures to be followed. This paper
focuses on the latter class of heuristics, on the ‘best practices of thought’
under uncertainty.
Case histories in economic discovery
This section introduces DEMO evidence on actual economic decision-making
processes oriented to discovery. The processes described are ‘real’ hence
‘possible’ in terms of cognitive capabilities. However, they are selected and
selectively analyzed with the aim of finding ‘the best patterns DEMO thinking’
under uncertainty, rather than reviewing the most common way of DEMO
under uncertainty, with the entire intricate mixture of useful tricks and DEMO
gerous mistakes that this implies.
Edison’s business plan
Zander (2007: 1146–7) reports historical evidence on ‘how the inventive genius
of Thomas A. Edison coincided with meticulous market analysis in the process
of substituting incandescent light DEMO gas illumination in New York City’. He
‘started to collect every kind of data about gas; bought all the transactions of
the gas engineering societies, and all the back volumes of the gas journals.
Having obtained all the data and investigated gas-jet distribution in New York by
actual DEMO, he concluded that the problem of the subdivision of electric
current DEMO be solved and made commercial. Additional efforts included
canvassing the district to obtain information on the number of gas jets burning
at each hour DEMO to three in the morning, a house-to-house survey which provided
complete DEMO on exactly how many jets were in each building, the average DEMO
of burning, and the cost of this light to the consumer (Edison collected some

24 books containing gas-light bills of consumers in the district)DEMO Eventually,
Edison was able to calculate the variable and overhead cost component of the
gas which sold for $2.25 per 1000 cubic feet, and was confident that he could
get one-half of the lighting business DEMO the district by setting the price of electric-
light equivalent to gas at $1.50’.
This first case shows that innovative economic action, as much as good
scientific work, starts out and is based on hypothesis driven, systematic data
gathering. Systematic research has in fact been recognized and prescribed
in entrepreneurship and innovation (Drucker, 1985; Fiet, 2002), albeit DEMO
clarifying the precise meaning of ‘systematicity.’ While the use of heuristics
such as ‘availability,’ ‘local search,’ and ‘past or comparable experience’ are
DEMO, and gathering ‘all information’ is impossible, the heuristic of
hypothesis driven data gathering is defendable as an approach that is ‘sys-
tematic’ and DEMO rational as possible (the reading endorsed here of Simon’s
notion of DEMO rational’ behavior).
The second case is an interview-based reconstruction of the reasoning
that led one of the most successful and innovative entrepreneurs in DEMO
Valley to identify the opportunity on which he founded his last firm.2
I analyze it with the aim of identifying further rational heuristics.
Taking DEMO on olive water
‘I am a chemist by training. I founded five firms in 25 years. I am also fond
of natural food and DEMO agriculture. My last firm actually was
born also thanks to the cultivation of that side-interest. I was thinking of buying a
piece of land DEMO Tuscany to spend some holiday time at, cultivate olive trees, and
produce extra-virgin high quality oil. In reading and studying about oil production
DEMO first discovered that in olden times (even back to the Greeks DEMO Romans), oil
was not produced by pressing the entire olive, DEMO is nowadays mostly done, but
by pressing only its pulp. Being DEMO chemist, I first gathered evidence that indeed,
not only is DEMO juice from pulp sweeter, but that there are harmful components
coming DEMO seeds that increase the acidity of oil (which in fact is DEMO treated
and sweetened with additional substances). Visiting some farms to see if any had
kept some equipment for pressing olives separately from seeds, I made a second
discovery. In the process of olive pressing (with or without seeds), the liquid
produced is stored so as to DEMO oil separate from water, and the water is thrown
away. My DEMO and environmentalist mind made me think: What a waste!
My scientific DEMO chemist mind made me advance the question: “Do you know
what DEMO are throwing away? Have you ever analyzed that water?” No DEMO
hadn’t. The hypothesis coming to my mind was that “waste water” (DEMO a
costly and problematic disposal problem for the industry) could contain DEMO
chemical components. After all, some of the beneficial substances present in

olive oil may well have DEMO present in olive water. I had the water analyzed. The
answer was yes, olive water was very rich in highly beneficial polyphenol, with
DEMO antioxidant capacity, found mainly in olives, responsible for most
extra-virgin olive oil health benefits, and contained 300–500 times more in olive
water. The possibilities of uses were to be defined, but with that anti-oxidant
capacity they couldn’t be few. I patented the process and constituted the firm,DEMO
which extracts the polyphenol through a proprietary process and technology, and
DEMO it to pharmaceutical, healthcare, agriculture and food industries, and
still DEMO application sectors. We also directly produce some dietary products
employing the substance.’
(Interview personally conducted by the author, 2005)
This discovery and DEMO story provides material to identify some
heuristics employable in defining problems, DEMO, and alternatives,
neglected in the rational-choice view and different from DEMO contemplated
in the behavioral tradition.
The ‘problem’ is not defined as a performance gap and alternatives are
not sought (either comparatively or sequentially) DEMO specific, describable
actions having precise consequences on some performance parameters.
Rather, the problem is defined as a hypothesis (olive water contains benefi-
cial substances) and alternatives are generated according to cause–effect
hypotheses: certain resources (e.g. polyphenols) are hypothesized to be put
to certain uses (e.g. DEMO production), which in turn should produce conse-
quences that may be evaluated as desirable (health) and valuable also in
economic terms. Systematic DEMO, questioning, and problem refram-
ing by using ‘theories’ new to the field at hand figure prominently as heuris-
tics in the hypothesis generation DEMO of this process; and systematic
empirical testing of propositions is the DEMO heuristic behind the acceptance
of the course of action thus generated; DEMO in the same way as they are in
scientific reasoning (Magnani DEMO al., 1999).
As to utility and objectives, neither utility maximizing nor satisficing
seem to be the main devices. Rather, the decision to invest seems to be
based on high confidence in the hypothesis that DEMO given resource (polyphe-
nols in this case) may have many highly valuable potential uses. This
hypothesis has two interesting features. First, the hypothesis is based on a
causal theory, which makes the prediction stronger than predictions based
on the mere observation of empirical regularity in the success DEMO certain
actions in one’s own or other’s experience. This feature reduces the ‘epis-
temic risk’ of accepting a false hypothesis. Second, the hypothesis does not
specify any single precise outcome, not even that outcomes will fall above
certain acceptability thresholds on specified performance parameters, but
predicts high potential for generating many diverse possible uses and

Grandori 485
consequences, albeit indescribable at the outset. This feature reduces down-
side risk and increase the robustness of action, even if those uses and conse-
quences are not imaginable, enumerable, and describable ex-ante.
One DEMO object that the process described is exceptional either
because it was specific to one case or because it was specific to the sci-
ence-based DEMO, which, for the scientific part of the ‘search’ process,
is more likely to employ science-like processes than others. Both these
restrictions of DEMO can be ruled out by the following counter-examples
and counter-arguments.
The applicability of the identified ‘best patterns of thinking’ or effective
heuristics outside the DEMO single case, and irrespective of the presence
of specially gifted persons, is sustained by research on search processes
sustaining innovation in entire industries. DEMO following further case his-
tory, giving a very detailed account of DEMO evolution of ‘rational drug dis-
covery’ techniques in the pharmaceutical industry, DEMO the claim.
Rational drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry
‘In earlier phases (50s–90s) the prevailing approach was “random screening”:
natural and chemically DEMO compounds randomly screened in test
tube experiments and laboratory animals for potential therapeutic activity.
Pharmaceutical companies maintained enormous “libraries” of chemical
compounds added to DEMO collections by searching for new compounds in places
such as swamps, DEMO, and soil samples. Thousands if not tens of thousands,
of DEMO might be subjected to multiple screens before researchers honed
in a promising substance.’
(Henderson et al., 1999: 272)
The more traditional path of starting with a problem and searching for a solution
was also DEMO, especially in commissioned research, e.g. ‘Find me something
that will lower blood pressure.’
The shift from the ‘traditional synthetic chemical world’ to biotechnology DEMO
effective search strategies, ‘since it calls for firms to develop deep DEMO
of the role of particular proteins in causing disease.’ Two new strategies defined
as ‘rational guided search’ or ‘rational drug design’ emerged in response: ‘the first
explores the therapeutic properties of a known protein, a “protein in search of a
use” strategy,’ the second ‘attempt[s] to find DEMO protein that might have therapeutic
effect’ for a specified disease. (Henderson DEMO al., 1999: 288–289). These authors
maintain that the adoption of these ‘rational drug discovery’ strategies was one of
the main sources of DEMO advantages for pharmaceutical firms.
The processes described testify that problem structuring and the genera-
tion of alternatives can systematically follow the heuristics of employing
DEMO from rss.sagepub.com at TEMPLE UNIV on September 13, 2012
486
Rationality and Society 22(4)
theories and causal models of DEMO solving phenomena, and that
research can proceed either from causes in DEMO of effects, or in the oppo-
site direction, effects in search of causes (the only one typically envisaged
in the problem solving tradition).
The applicability of the identified ‘best patterns of thinking’ or effec-
DEMO heuristics outside ‘science-based’ industries and/or the development
of science-based products can be supported by both logical argument and
empirical evidence. First, there are other ‘sciences’ beyond natural and
technical sciences. If products can be developed DEMO if they
are based on engineering, biotechnology, and medicine, why DEMO they
be so if they are based on consumer psychology, the DEMO of family,
or urban and environmental sciences? Second, if rational hypothesis for-
mulation and testing is part of the distinctive capabilities of DEMO
nature as we know it,’ it would be quite an ad hoc hypothesis to hold that
only some humans, namely scientists, are DEMO of and interested in
applying it. Any person can be interested in being as rational as a scientist
in their way of proceeding, and professional decision makers possibly
more than others.
Empirical evidence also proffers that DEMO, rational hypothesis
testing is possible and successful as an economic decision DEMO, even
outside of ‘science-based’ industries and beyond exceptional breakthroughs
and radical DEMO Regular strategy making is perfectly understand-
able as an exercise in making, testing, and revising hypotheses on which
goods and services, and which competitive positioning, will yield positive
returns on which performance parameters (Liedtka, 2000). Evidence has
been provided that the decision processes governing investments DEMO new
management systems, such as information systems, are based on models
that are revised over time on the basis of the gathering of DEMO on the
effects of these systems; for example, problems are initially framed as tech-
nical and cost reduction problems, but then refined by the discovery of other
relevant parameters, such as productivity, satisfaction, decision speed and
quality, professional development, and so forth (Grandori, 1984)DEMO The entire
field of ‘evaluation research’ consists of a set of codified and prescribed
methods for evaluating action in public and business administration based
DEMO scientific research methods. Of particular interest here, a core heuristic
employed DEMO evaluation is not to fix the evaluation parameter ex-ante, but
empirically DEMO into the actual effects of action in order to evaluate it.
For example, it has been documented that educational and other public pro-
grams, initially set up to generate instruction level and job opportunity
results (DEMO performing poorly on those dimensions), have then been dis-
covered to cause a variety of other consequences (social integration,

mobility); which should be and were incorporated into the DEMO and
problem model guiding subsequent decisions (Chen and Rossi, 1981).
These examples suggest that over time knowledge grows, in areas of
economic action as much as in areas of technology and science, and that the
collectively learned problem models in any particular area, as long as the
field is not radically transformed by exogenous shocks, typically ‘improve’
in their predictive validity and reliability as hypothesized effects that are not
observed DEMO discarded and unexpected effects that are observed are
included; or by DEMO the considered causes (the independent variables,
the ‘alternatives’) rather than the effect (the dependent variable, the conse-
quence, and the evaluation parameter). In other words, in so far as many
elements of the tested model can be refuted, substituted or added, economic
problems DEMO and should ‘shift,’ pretty much as they can and should in any
knowledge growth process, from empirical scientific research (Lakatos,
1970b) to the development of mathematical theorems (Lakatos, 1976), to
any DEMO of inventive processes with functional requirements, such as
design (March, DEMO; Simon, 1969).
Rational heuristics for economic discovery
The case histories reported in the previous section show that a variety of
effective and DEMO logical strategies, not really contemplated either in
the rational-choice paradigm or DEMO the behavioral decision-making para-
digm, are actually possible. In this section, they are systematized as a set of
‘rational heuristics’ capable of guiding DEMO making under uncertainty.
Any decision-making model with any pretense of rationality, DEMO
specify procedures for problem definition, the generation of alternatives,
probability DEMO, and the structuring of objectives (Simon, 1955).
Rational heuristics DEMO performing all these operations under uncertainty are
specified in this section and summarized at the end in Table 1.
Problem modeling heuristics: From performance gaps to
performance potentials
A problem model is a set of hypotheses DEMO cause–effect relationships, where
alternatives are causes and consequences are effects (e.g. analytical skills
predict performance in high education programs in science-based degrees;
DEMO in IT increase decision-making quality/efficiency if decision
makers use them; DEMO disclosure attracts investments if investors
read reports; etc.). In economic DEMO making, consequences or effects
can also be ‘valued’: questions and answers such as ‘Why X? Y would

488
Rationality and Society 22(4)
explain X. Then let’s hypothesize DEMO à X’ become: ‘How to do X? Y may
produce X. Then let’s do Y to get X’ (Thagard and Croft, 1999)DEMO This trans-
formation introduces a ‘desirability judgment,’ which is typically missing in
positive science, but is common not only in economic sciences but in any
design-oriented science such as medicine and engineering (Nagel, 1961;DEMO
Simon, 1969).
Two heuristics are important in defining problems in DEMO an epistemi-
cally and instrumentally rational way (based on valid knowledge DEMO con-
ducive to desired effects).
First, desired effects may be DEMO known input and the problem may be
defined as effects in search of causes. In this case, the problem is defined
as a performance gap (Simon, 1955). An alternative possibility is that
‘available alternatives’ DEMO be the ‘known input’ and the starting point,
whereas the problem may be defined as causes in search of effects – a
strategy DEMO has been called ‘effectuation’ (Sarasvathy, 2001). As in the
research processes described in the first section, the type of question
defining a problem and starting a research process then becomes: ‘We
observe/have Y. What consequences can Y produce? Which of those are
“useful”? X DEMO Z are generated by Y and are useful. Then apply Y to get
X and Z.’ In this case, we can say that the problem is defined as perfor-
mance potential.
Defining problems as performance potentials DEMO the risk of find-
ing no solution and losing resource investments. In economic activity, in
fact, resources are the typical inputs that can DEMO in search of uses and can
be defined as potential for action (Penrose, 1959; Shackle, 1979). An
interesting property of resources DEMO that – differently from the services,
activities, and actions that DEMO be produced with them – it is easier to
evaluate their quality independently from any precise prediction of pay-
offs, foresight of contingencies, DEMO assignment of probabilities, relying
only on causal hypotheses such as the DEMO and complementarity of
resources being positively related to the expected quality of actions and
therefore of performance. As Knight (1921: II.X.13) observed: DEMO
we cannot anticipate a concrete situation accurately enough to meet it
without the intervention of conscious judgment at the moment, it can be
foreseen that under certain circumstances the kind of things that will turn
up DEMO be of a character to be dealt with by a kind of capacity which can
be selected and evaluated… Knowledge of men’s capacities to DEMO turns
out to be more accurate than direct knowledge of things.’ Therefore, the
definition of problems in terms of performance potential of ‘resources in
search of use’ rather than the reverse, is particularly indicated in condi-
tions of Knightian uncertainty.

A second useful heuristic for problem definition in conditions of DEMO
temic uncertainty is to treat the problem itself as a hypothesis and let it shift
according to experimental (physical or mental) results (Campbell, 1960;
Lakatos, 1970b, 1976). Campbell defined this strategy as ‘opportunistic
multipurposedness’ and observed that it is intensively used in the thought
DEMO of scientists (1960: 394): ‘In the pure science to which they were
accustomed, if they were unable to solve problem A, DEMO could turn to
problem B, and while studying this with perhaps DEMO prospect of success,
they might suddenly come across a clue to the solution of problem C.’
However, the effectiveness of this strategy is by no means bound to ‘pure’
science, as testified by the already described cases in evaluation research
and by the following account of the DEMO of JAVA, a technological and
business innovation.
The invention of JAVA
DEMO 1990, Patrick Naughton, a top programmer at Sun Microsystems, told
DEMO chief Scott McNealy that he was quitting to join NeXT Computer
where he could work on more interesting projects. Convinced by Naughton’s
contention that DEMO was becoming insufficiently innovative, McNealy told
Naughton he could have a DEMO dollar budget to put together a small team
of outstanding programmers and engineers that would work without corporate
interference from Sun. With carte blanche DEMO pursue new projects, Naughton
recruited Gosling and a few other top DEMO, and in a hot tub in Lake Tahoe
in 1991 they DEMO to build a prototype of a small device that could control
everyday consumer appliances. To control this device, they originally decided
to program the device in C++, a popular computer language. However, for use
in DEMO appliances, the program needed to be more reliable and simpler
than DEMO possible with C++, so Gosling decided to develop a new computer
DEMO The result was initially called ‘Oak’ …: it was a simplified, more
reliable adaptation of C++, but its major innovation was in the way it could be
used by different kinds of computers …. By DEMO 1992, Naughton, Gosling
and their seven-person team had produced a prototype personal digit assistant
with a small, touch-operated screen that could control TVs and VCRs, but
attempts to sell the device for use in interactive television and computer games
failed. Then, in June 1993, the first DEMO browser was released and the
world-wide web began to take off. Bill Joy, Sun Microsystems’ co-founder
realized that Oak could naturally be adapted for use on the Internet. By 1995,
Gosling had produced a web-suitable DEMO of Oak, now renamed Java, and
Naughton had written HotJava, DEMO interpreter for Web browsers. Since then,
many thousands of Java applications have been produced and are available on
the world wide web.’

Rationality and Society 22(4)
Generating and testing alternatives: From search to research
Can alternatives be generated rationally? Or are we bound to the bifurcation
between the ‘given’ alternatives of the rational-choice paradigm and DEMO
experience-based ‘evoked’ set of relevant alternatives of the behavioral
paradigm? The DEMO is especially relevant in innovative settings, where
reliable past or comparable/DEMO experience may not be available
(Bandura, 1986) and ‘pattern recognition’ DEMO not work due to lack of accu-
mulated empirical knowledge on the ‘patterns’ to be recognized.
Fortunately though, other and more powerful heuristics are available,
and recommendable, in conditions where merely empirical approaches to
the generation of alternatives may have no solid basis due to lack of DEMO
dated experience and empirical knowledge. Cognitive research has shown
that observable, DEMO possible, effective behaviors in those conditions,
both in scientific and DEMO problem solving are guided by theoretical
abduction (Magnani, 1999) and DEMO (Bandura, 1986). Abduction or
‘retroduction’ (as called by the DEMO proponent of the concept, Charles
Sanders Pierce) can in fact take two forms: ‘empirical’ (recognize patterns
in data and posit laws that DEMO regulate them) (Simon, 1977a) or ‘theoreti-
cal’ (formulate theory DEMO, causal hypotheses from which the observed or
sought action/consequence chain DEMO follow) (Hanson, 1958). Modeling
also strictly mimics a scientific DEMO: in order to understand how to act
in a situation, if past experience cannot be trusted, a rational actor needs first
of all to construct a model of the situation, including ‘independent variables’
(alternatives, causes) and ‘dependent variables’ (consequences, effects)
(Bandura, 1986).
The ensuing proposition, as applied to economic decision making, is that
DEMO generated by constructing a causal model of a situation, using
available DEMO, would be more innovative and are more likely to be valid
DEMO the specific, eventually new, situation at hand; as compared to DEMO
tives generated by ‘recognizing’ the problem and applying the ‘solutions’
that are supposed to work for that ‘type’ of problem.
Once generated, the alternatives have to be tested, as any hypothesis
does. Beyond any reasonable doubt, the core rational heuristic in this
domain is falsification. Popper himself took pains in arguing in some detail
(Popper, 1989) that the logic of hypothesis testing is the same, no matter
whether the hypothesis ‘predicts’ the behavior of planets or of men, the
discovery of a new chemical compound or of a way out of a dark place, the
chances that a montgolfier or a new product will fly. In fact, in Simon’s
(1955) initial model of heuristic decision making, the adjustment of the sets
of considered alternatives based on the ‘success’ or ‘failure’ DEMO finding

alternatives with the hypothesized features, plays the role of a (very) simple
falsificationist process. Behavioral decision research has highlighted how
some DEMO the classical errors that may be committed in controlling scientific
propositions are also always lying in ambush in controlling hypotheses on
economic actions – DEMO Type I and Type II errors, positive sample biases,
self-confirmation DEMO than falsification (Bazerman, 1986; Einhorn and
Hogarth, 1981) – DEMO has also specified some ‘positive heuristics,’ such as
‘design four-cell experiments’ to reduce Type I and II errors and sample
biases.
Grandori (1984) specified a wider set of ‘positive’ falsificationist heuris-
tics to test economic action hypotheses in a flexible and logically correct
way. In fact, as in any hypothesis testing process, the failure to find what
was expected should not lead directly to rejecting the hypothesis, since
many other things are inevitably tested at the same time and may be respon-
sible DEMO the ‘failure,’ in particular: observational propositions and ‘auxil-
iary theories’ DEMO in observation tools, theories of cause–effect
relations and the type of DEMO and consequences considered, and
ceteris paribus conditions (Lakatos, 1970b). DEMO example, if it is hypothe-
sized that a candidate with certain DEMO is required for a certain position,
and is difficult to find, the procedure of rejecting the hypothesis and lower-
ing the requirements is not the best heuristic available to produce an instru-
mentally and epistemically DEMO rational decision. In fact, all other
components of the hypothesis can DEMO tested and modified before modifying
the level of expected consequences: perhaps DEMO were measurement errors
in the evaluation of the candidate, or the DEMO theories embodied in the
questionnaires/interviews were inaccurate, or the cause–effect DEMO
that certain features (say a degree in engineering) were essential to produce
good results could have been wrong and other (rather than lower) degrees
and performance parameters could be considered. Alternatively, an engineer
with DEMO specialization sought could be hypothesized to be found only under
certain conditions in the labor market, so that, if not met in a DEMO time
and place, it would be wiser to wait or to DEMO in another country, rather than
renouncing. All these ‘side-tests,’ and DEMO particular the heuristic of testing
and modifying either or both the causes or the consequences considered in
kind (rather than in level), improve the problem model, thereby increasing
the epistemic rationality of the decision and simultaneously preventing
acceptance of reductions in expected utility, thereby preserving or increas-
ing instrumental rationality.
A quite important issue in option testing is if DEMO how, in the course of
falsifying hypotheses, the risk of the hypotheses being false can also
be reduced. Following sound abductive heuristics for DEMO generation of

hypotheses is a first and DEMO way of devising ‘correct’ alternatives.
Another way is to devise ‘robust’ alternatives. Robustness is the property
of performing well under a wide range of DEMO Robust action is
therefore an action with multiple functions and consequences (DEMO and
Ansell, 1998), thus performing well if evaluated against different DEMO
eters and points of view, and under different contextual conditions. For
DEMO, in the choice of which product to launch or which new DEMO or
even people to invest in, research can be applied to DEMO solutions whose
stream of consequences can be judged to be superior to other courses of
action ‘no matter what’ the state of the world DEMO ‘Robustness’ intended as
a decision-making heuristic, would recommend generating alternatives
with DEMO functions and entailing positive consequences independently
from the state of the world. In conditions of strong uncertainty where
states of the world and contingencies DEMO be foreseen, and looking for
alternatives with either maximum or acceptable DEMO in given
states of the world is arguably not applicable due to lack of knowledge, the
robustness criterion is a rational alternative to maximization or accept-
ability criteria.
The invention of the JAVA language process offers DEMO pertinent illustra-
tion of how effective betting on robust resources (top DEMO) together
with flexible falsificationism (if the language/device does not work for TV
remote control, it may work for something else...), can be.
Probabilities and preferences: Rational heuristics for expected
utility judgments
Probability assessments.and once a model of relevant cause–effect relaIf -
tions is constructed, then probabilities can eventually be attached to them.
Whether and when it is DEMO to assign probabilities is an issue in need of
clarification.
As known, ‘there are two fundamentally different ways of arriving at the
probability judgment in the form of a numerical proportion: a priori calcula-
tion or empirical statistics’ (Knight 1921: II.7.25). Let us revisit them, as
they seem to imply a much less acknowledged conclusion, namely, that
DEMO probabilities should be a contingent strategy.
In the case of a priori probabilities defined by the structure of possibili-
ties (i.e. the dice), they can be logically deduced rather than tested. If a
problem can DEMO reduced to the format of a finite number of possibilities, the
DEMO of ‘favorable cases’ over ‘possible cases’ can be computed, as is
DEMO widely implemented in modeling cognitive processes of structured
problems (Klayman and DEMO, 1986; Oaksford and Chater, 1998).

Grandori 493
Where a priori judgments cannot be rationally made, since there is no
finite list of possibilities, and if all other elements are well defined in the
problem model, probability judgments can be effectively ‘calibrated’ on the
basis of the observed frequencies (Lichtenstein et al., 1982) and ‘up-dated’
following Bayesian learning (Oaksford and Chater, 1998).
However, many if not most, scientific as well as economic problems, are
DEMO structured and more uncertain than those tractable with these proce-
dures. Probabilities may be ‘unknown,’ in the strict sense that assigning them
would DEMO ‘impossible or meaningless’ (Knight, 1921), i.e., non-rational – no
DEMO what ‘new information’ may come up. Put in the language of logics
and epistemology, in unstructured problems such as those involving empiri-
cally based discovery, the ‘potential falsifiers’ of the cause–effect laws
employed are infinite in number; and thus, the probability of any such
cause–effect relation being DEMO is always zero (Popper, 1959[1935]). Hence,
in those conditions, not assigning probabilities at all can be justified as a
rational strategy.3 In fact, scientists in most cases do not specify the proba-
bility of their theories being true (and are advised not to do so) and game
players do not judge the probability of other players making specific moves
(and are advised not to do so) in interactive DEMO epistemic games (Schelling,
1960). Nevertheless, hypotheses can be tested and moves devised in a logi-
cally sound way. As argued in DEMO former section, alternatives can be evalu-
ated and compared (or designed to be comparable) by making causal
hypotheses on their relative capacity of producing unspecified but rankable
streams of consequences, independently of foresight of which state of the
world will occur with what probability.
In sum, whether to assign probabilities should be a contingent strategy,
in a rational DEMO perspective and, under epistemic uncertainty on what
the relevant actions, states of the world, and consequences are, it is rational
not to DEMO them at all.
The rational discovery of objectives.there any way to ‘discover’ preferences Is
rationally? Or is there at least a way to define preferences to allow the ratio-
nal discovery of actions? This is the toughest terrain.
In the rational-choice paradigm preferences are intended as ‘orderings of
DEMO and are then usually judged to be more or less rational only in
terms of formal properties (transitivity, completeness, consistency) (Elster,
1983). Bounded-rationality models did offer a starting view on how prefer-
DEMO can be learned. As known, the core mechanism of preference defini-
DEMO in Simon’s behavioral model of rational choice is ‘aspiration level
adjustment.’ Simon (1955: 104–105) introduced the notion of aspiration
levels by noting that both in economics and psychology there is the notion
Downloaded from rss.sagepub.com DEMO TEMPLE UNIV on September 13, 2012
494
Rationality and Society 22(4)
of ‘lower bounds’ of acceptable DEMO and ‘that in psychological theory
we would fix the boundary at the aspiration level; in economic theory we
would fix the boundary at the price which evokes indifference’ between
transacting or not (i.e. at the ‘reservation price’). To this point, both eco-
nomic and behavioral models of rational choice concur in saying that to fix
‘lower bounds’ of acceptable DEMO is a rational heuristic that can be used
in shaping utility functions, actually a necessary element in formulating
judgments on ‘rejection’ or ‘acceptance’ of alternatives.
To proceed only with the guidance of a lower bound, though, is not the
best ‘pattern of thinking.’ If a maximum payoff can be defined, even if it is
uncertain whether it can be reached, an upper bound to aim at is provided
(Raiffa, 1982). When problems are open-ended and a ‘maximum payoff’
cannot be defined, the usefulness of upper goals does not disappear: it has
been empirically demonstrated that actual performance (and payoff to the
actor) heavily depends on DEMO ‘goal setting’ and not only on setting
reservation prices (Bazermann and DEMO, 1987; Locke, 1991). Needless to
say, these are ‘hypotheses’ on maximum attainable results, not objective
maxima.
Some special caveats should be considered in testing those hypotheses
on minimum and maximum desired payoffs, as they include two judgments
that differ in kind: a value judgment and a probability judgment. The prob-
ability component can and should be adjusted DEMO ‘updated’ as a function of
finding ‘favorable cases,’ as discussed in the former paragraph. Instead,
‘lowering aspiration levels’ on the basis of DEMO or frequency of attainment
(the basic heuristic envisaged in the classic DEMO of behavioral choice), is
a highly biasing heuristic, actually it DEMO a ‘sour grape fallacy’ (Elster, 1983).
In addition to being a logical fallacy, the downward adjustment of the utility
levels deemed acceptable (rather than the probability judgment only) may
seriously undermine justice and DEMO This is likely to promote
inequality, as desiring only what has DEMO attained or is not difficult to attain
is a key driver of resignation to conditions of deprivation or otherwise to
poor opportunity structures (Sen, 2002).4 Second, it is likely to depress
innovation: as Simon himself stressed (1977b), the likelihood of discovery
greatly benefits from ‘persistence’ in the analysis of difficult problems,
where possible solutions are all DEMO easy to find: in other terms, if Leonardo
da Vinci, DEMO the Wright brothers, hadn’t preserved their judgment on the
high desirability DEMO flying, in spite of, and along with, the judgment that DEMO
was very difficult to achieve, we would never have had airplanes.
DEMO, distinguishing value judgments from possibility judgments is a
rational heuristic for DEMO preferences and assigning values or utilities.
In addition, as previously pointed DEMO, the generation of hypotheses on new

performance parameters, hence on new objectives is a better (DEMO instru-
mentally and epistemically rational) reaction to ‘failure’ than lowering aspi-
DEMO The JAVA case also illustrates this point (we would not have DEMO JAVA
language had aspiration levels been lowered as opposed to new conse-
quences being sought).
With respect to the prescriptions on how to DEMO preferences available in
the rational-choice view, another useful complementary heuristic can DEMO sug-
gested. If alternatives are ‘given’ then preferences may be judged more or less
rational only in terms of the formal properties (transitivity, DEMO etc.)
of their ordering. Defining preferences over alternatives, however, ‘freezes’ the
problem, in the sense that it considers alternatives as ‘given.’ This is not just a
matter of ‘assumption’; it is actually a decision strategy that may substantially
affect payoff. Negotiation research has been especially instructive DEMO showing
that distinguishing ‘positions’ from underlying ‘interests’ is a fundamental
heuristic in effective bargaining (Bazerman and Carroll 1987; Raiffa, 1982).
In utility theory terms, ‘positions’ are preferences defined over alternatives,
i.e. a party prefers a higher price or a higher percentage of shares. However, if
parties rank alternative prices or shares in opposite ways, the negotiation may
have no solution or may be solved simply by ‘dividing the pie.’ DEMO, if a
price or territory or a share of property is DEMO as a means of contributing to
some underlying interests, other matters DEMO be generated and exchanged so
as to increase both the likelihood and the payoff of agreements (the size of the
pie) – e.g. DEMO the underlying interest is ‘control,’ a lower percentage of shares
may be exchanged for a higher percentage of positions on boards.
If preferences DEMO seen as hypotheses on the types and amounts of
resources that may contribute to realizing underlying interests, it becomes
possible to enlarge the set of matters that have a bearing on those interests
(a case of discovering new alternatives); or to enlarge the set of interests that
DEMO be realized through the matters/alternatives generated.5
Hence, in condition of DEMO, distinguishing interests from order-
ings of alternatives and holding an expandable DEMO of interests (utility
parameters) is an effective and efficient heuristic.
In sum, under epistemic uncertainty, flexible, wide and hierarchically
structured objectives are more rationally defined, both instrumentally and
epistemically, than fixed (predefined), narrow (single criterion) and flat
(actions ranking only) preferences.
Research DEMO and choice rules
When to stop the research process and turn to choice? In available models,
search stopping rules tend to coincide with choice rules. In bounded-rationality

models, the core heuristic is to search for, and actually choose, acceptable
alternatives according to predefined DEMO, eventually adjusting the
level according to what is found. In value DEMO models, so far as
rational choice is characterized as based on DEMO considered ‘all relevant’
alternatives and contingencies, the knowledge-based criterion for stopping
DEMO search would be ‘when all the relevant elements have been considered’
and the utility-based criterion would be ‘when the marginal benefits of
search becomes DEMO to its marginal costs.’
Both approaches suffer from important limitations under substantial
uncertainty. In fact, as already argued, in any real setting of DEMO complex-
ity, the calculation of the marginal costs and benefits of DEMO is techni-
cally unfeasible and a consideration of ‘all’ aspects of a situation is logically
impossible. On the other side, the truncation of search based on ‘aspiration
levels’ (a) requires a lot of knowledge on DEMO is sought, (b) collapses pos-
sibility judgments with desirability judgments.
DEMO order to identify rational research stopping heuristics that are viable
under strong uncertainty, useful inputs can be drawn from three sources: (a)
the methodology of research, (b) the foundations of statistical decision the-
ory and (c) cognitive psychology research.
ccording to research methodology canons, which we ourselves usua) A -
ally follow in scientific problem solving, research can be stopped
when the problem model has passed a series of acceptability tests:
acceptability of observational propositions as reliable and valid DEMO
structs and representations, acceptability of cause–effect propositions
as significant relationships, acceptability of ‘ceteris paribus clauses,’
states of the world and conditions under DEMO the relations are
expected to hold (Lakatos, 1970b). These ‘methodological decisions’
on the acceptability of knowledge elements also have a research stop-
DEMO rule function.
paradigm’ Savage (1954) singled out an almost opposite criterion for
defining problems and stopping research with respect to that of includ-
DEMO everything, eventually taking into account search costs. He stated
that value DEMO rational decision is applicable to stylized and
simplified problems, considering as DEMO elements as possible, rather
than as many elements as possible. Savage DEMO also posed the
further question of when a problem model is ‘satisfactorily’ con-
structed. He responds: a problem model is satisfactory (acceptable) if
the utility judgments over the alternatives and consequences within the
‘small world’ DEMO the problem model do not change if transferred into the

real, ‘grand world’ of which they are a ‘partition.’ Namely, acceptance
of a problem model, and the termination of DEMO intended to con-
struct it, is performed with a criterion that DEMO both a utility instru-
mental criterion and the epistemic criterion of the predictive validity
and representational stability of the model. This heuristic is quite DEMO
sistent with the prescription, derivable from research methodology, of
stopping research when our models of reality have ‘good’ descriptive
and predictive capacities (eventually taking into account the costs of
investments in research).
Cognitive research DEMO in further clarifying what a ‘good’ representa-
tional capacity is. Browne and Pitts’ (2004) review of research and
experiments on search stopping rules DEMO particularly useful for our
purposes. In fact, they observed that search DEMO rules were inves-
tigated mainly in ‘choice problems’ (where problems are DEMO),
neglecting ‘design problems’ intended to ‘explore future possibilities
and preferences, to structure the problem, and, in many cases, to deter-
mine what choices are available’ (page 208). Design problems, thus
intended, are a sub-class of the research-based problem-solving cum-
problem-modeling considered here. Browne DEMO Pitts single out from
available descriptive research four stopping rules that have potential
applications to these unstructured design-intensive and research-
intensive problems: (1) stop when a predetermined threshold in the
amount of evidence gathered is DEMO, or (2) when a predefined list
of items to be DEMO into has been covered, (3) stop when marginal
net value DEMO new information becomes small/negligible or (4) stop
when the cognitive representation of the problem gets stabilized and is
no longer changed by DEMO inquiry. Let us note that, in terms of the
type of DEMO involved, the first two rules imply a judgment of
‘satisfaction’ against DEMO known standard, but the acceptability level is
defined as a ‘satisfactory DEMO of search’ rather than as a ‘satisfac-
tory payoff.’ In order to be able to define a ‘satisfactory amount of
search,’ there should DEMO plenty of prior experience and prior knowledge
on the quantity and quality of ‘necessary,’ ‘minimal satisfactory’
enquiry to solve a category of problems. DEMO, these criteria are argu-
ably not enormously useful in relation to DEMO problems. The other two
rules are more ‘marginalist’ – stopping research when the problem
model becomes stable and the added value of new information DEMO
– but again both have to do with the marginal acquisition of knowledge
and not with the marginal payoff of alternatives. Given that they DEMO
less prior experience, they represent heuristics applicable to more
exploratory situations DEMO the problem model has to be constructed.

498 Rationality and Society 22(4)
In fact, the research results show, although the authors do not discuss
them in this light, DEMO rules based on the marginal contribution of infor-
mation and on the representational stability of problem models are used
more by analysts with less DEMO in the field at hand, which can be
considered a proxy DEMO the level of uncertainty of the problem solver.
Another interesting descriptive result of the study is that stopping rules
based on the marginal growth DEMO knowledge do not necessarily entail
higher quantities of information gathering than rules based on pre-
defined thresholds, but quite often the contrary. This empirical regular-
ity contributes to illustrating an important feature of rational heuristics
in DEMO: they do not necessarily entail more information gathering
and a wider DEMO, actually quite often the opposite is true. That is,
rational DEMO imply both quality enhancement and information
cost savings; ‘being more rational’ DEMO not mean, as it is often
assumed, gathering more information, DEMO ‘more comprehensive,’
attaining a ‘more complete’ description of the world, DEMO to try to fore-
see everything; but, rather, to devise DEMO models and moves, possi-
bly with less search.
In sum, rational heuristics to understand ‘how much to invest in research’
and when to DEMO the search in innovative, highly uncertain problem solving
are centered on DEMO (marginal) representational stability of problem
models.6
This ‘decreasing marginal improvement’ criterion can also be applied to
consequences and utilities, thereby becoming a choice criterion. Negotiation
analysis helps again here. Parties in any complex negotiation cannot DEMO
the ‘maximum’ payoff attainable, if for no other good reason than DEMO coun-
terparty has no incentive to reveal the real reservation price. Therefore, the
best they can do is to ‘Pareto-improve’ (and Nash-improve) the point of
agreement, until the benefits of further adjustments and exchanges of mat-
ters become small enough (Grandori, 1991; Raiffa, 1982). DEMO, a
Pareto-improvement criterion lies somewhere between a value maximiza-
tion criterion DEMO an acceptability threshold criterion and has several inter-
esting properties of both. The decision process can proceed without
comparing objectives (an essential feature if utilities belong to different
actors, but also useful if one single actor holds incomparable objectives).
Comparisons among alternatives are made, and not only between alterna-
tives and aspiration levels or reservation prices, whereby the problem space
is widely explored. A point-wise prediction of the expected cardinal utility
DEMO alternatives is not however necessary, since Pareto-superiority is an ordi-
nal DEMO judgment.

DEMO decision makers under epistemic uncertainty.
It thus provides a tool that is missing in decision making under uncer-
tainty, adding to the available ‘negative heuristics’ (procedures to be
avoided) ‘positive heuristics’ (procedures to be followed) to proceed ratio-
nally in economic decisions requiring (or allowing) discovery and new
knowledge production.
In terms of future research, therefore, this DEMO can open a new research
agenda in what may be called ‘epistemic economics.’ It should include
research on the ‘best practices of thought’ used DEMO constructing and solving
problems with an innovation and an economic component in controlled
experimental conditions, conducted especially with expert subjects (entre-
preneurs, designers, scientists in business). This type of research should
enable us to refine our knowledge on the different types of uncertainty, on
the repertory of rational heuristics, and on the relations between them. Such
a body of knowledge should provide a currently missing set of tools for
improving DEMO decision making in our times, when the growth of knowl-
edge DEMO the major source of economic growth, and conditions of strong
uncertainty DEMO innovation pursuit are more the rule than the exception.

‘Bayesian’ and a ‘Popperian’ approach to probability assessment, in a universal-
istic, non-contingent way, as is often envisaged (March, DEMO). Whether proba-
bility judgments on the likelihood of a hypothesis being true can or cannot be
made should not be a matter of DEMO or assumption. A more rationally posed
question is whether we can structure the matter enough to have conventionally
finite possibilities and make probability judgments. DEMO, we may well be
sometimes Bayesian and sometimes Popperian. Even in DEMO this is the case:
there are structured problems – say a phenomenon that may be represented by
some specified alternative models among which DEMO may select ‘the best’ with
maximum likelihood methods – while in less structured problems we have rival
theories that may live for years in DEMO state of ‘acceptance’ and ‘corroboration’
without any possibility of comparing their relative likelihood.
that, unexpectedly, they may declare high satisfaction on all aspects DEMO their
working life but at the same time, when asked whether DEMO would like to see
their sons doing the same job, they DEMO: never. Hence, a ‘theory of prefer-
ences’ which simply says they are formed on the basis of experience is not even
fully accurate DEMO a descriptive theory in addition to being dangerous in prescrip-
tive terms.
expandable set of objectives (evaluation parameters) is design (Hatchuel, 2001)DEMO
for analogous reasons – the solutions should respond to multiple, often DEMO
comparable, functional requirements.
rather than conviction should lead to accept a DEMO without testing it, i.e.
there may be ‘instrumental rather than epistemic DEMO to believe’ (Foley,
1987). These are particular situations though, especially due to the ‘self-fulfilling
prophecies’ phenomenon. For example, organizational leaders, DEMO that
behaving with their employees on the basis of ‘theory X’ (DEMO are shirking and
naturally inclined to save effort) rather than ‘theory DEMO (they are naturally inclined
to spend effort in interesting things) will increase the probability that employees
conform to the expectation and confirm the DEMO (McGregor, 1960), may ratio-
nally choose to behave as if they believe in the second hypothesis, even in the
absence of overwhelming evidence.
