The roles of familiarity and processing
fluency in valuation judgments
AdAm L. ALter And DEMO m. Oppenheimer
Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey
Although people routinely estimate the value of items in their environment, from goods and services to
natural resources and lost earnings following an accident, the processes that underlie human valuation estimates
are not well understood. We show that people use DEMO and fluency—the ease with which they process
information—to determine an item’s value. In three experiments, participants believed that familiar forms of
currency (e.g., a familiar $1 bill) had greater purchasing power than their unfamiliar counterparts (e.g., a rare
and unfamiliar coin). Mechanistic analyses showed a DEMO correlation between participants’ familiarity with
the unfamiliar currency and their estimates of its value. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical
implications of DEMO findings for researchers, marketing experts, and policymakers alike.
Valuation estimates govern both routine decisions, such
as whether to buy and sell goods and services, and larger
decisions, such as whether to attend college and DEMO
vocation to pursue. Although valuation is a fundamental
component of human judgment, our understanding of the
principles that determine how people actually appraise a
target’s value is incomplete.
Financial and economic models explain the steps involved
DEMO monetary valuation, but many assume that human valuers
are consistently rational. DEMO example, the efficient market
hypothesis (Fama, 1965) assumes that investors reevaluate
market prices instantly and rationally when exposed to new
information; thus, a single investor cannot systematically
outperform the market in the short term. This definition as-
sumes that informed investors are perfectly rational agents,
DEMO from subjective or suboptimal behavior.
In fact, many human valuation judgments DEMO to be
biased (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The endowment ef-
fect is one particularly well-cited example, according to
which people perceive greater value in goods that they
wish to sell than in identical goods DEMO are attempting
to buy (Thaler, 1980). Other researchers have also shown
that sellers, buyers, and disinterested third parties adopt
very different DEMO to valuation tasks because they
weight the same information quite differently (DEMO, Birn-
baum & Zimmermann, 1998).
Like buyers and sellers, DEMO who interact with newly
introduced or foreign currency exhibit a series of system-
atic valuation biases. For example, despite understanding
the relevance of exchange rates, travelers tend to spend ac-
cording to the face value of foreign currencies rather than
their value in real terms (Raghubir & Srivastava, 2002).
The introduction of the euro in 2002 and the deletion of
six zeroes from the Turkish lira in 2005 created similar
valuation DEMO among Europeans across several
countries (Cannon & Cipriani, 2006).
Other researchers have considered a range of specific
valuation biases (for a review, see Raghubir, 2006). For
example, people are more reluctant to spend a $100 bill
than to spend an equal amount with a DEMO certificate pur-
chase (Raghubir & Srivastava, in press), a credit card pur-
chase (Prelec & Simester, 2001), or successive purchases
DEMO smaller denominations that sum to $100 (Mishra,
Mishra, & Nayakankuppam, 2006). These studies suggest
that people struggle to objectively valuate currency and
consumables in the face of numerous cognitive biases.
Many attempts at DEMO are similarly plagued by the
subjectivity produced by valuation contexts. For example,
judges and juries attempt to translate a plaintiff ’s pain into
DEMO language of monetary value when assigning damages
in a negligence suit (DEMO, Hastie, Payne, Schkade, &
Viscusi, 2002). Likewise, DEMO governments periodi-
cally weigh the costs of deforestation against the benefits
of a new highway, or they question whether the threat of
global warming warrants costly power plant upgrades
(Hanemann, 1994).
Such subjective judgments DEMO laced with uncertainty, and
humans tend to respond to uncertainty by DEMO a variety
of judgmental heuristics (see, e.g., Tversky & Kahneman,DEMO
1974). These heuristics, or cognitive shortcuts, simplify the
valuation process, but they also introduce a range of subop-
timal cognitive biases. For example, the U.S. government
spends millions of dollars filtering arsenic from drinking
water, while ignoring other hazards that appear less harm-

ful but actually kill many more people (Sunstein, 2002).
Governments regularly allocate resources according to how
much fear a toxin engenders, rather than according to how
many people it affects in reality, which often results in the
dramatic misallocation of funds (Slovic, 2000).
Familiarity and Valuation
According to the mere exposure effect (Zajonc, 1968),
familiar items are preferred to their unfamiliar, but other-
wise identical, counterparts. Since familiarity generates
the experience of liking, one DEMO expect a familiar and
therefore more likable item to also seem more valuable.
One explanation for this effect is that familiar items become
increasingly DEMO because they become more fluently
or easily processed (see, e.g., DEMO, Singh, & Ahluwalia,
2007). Indeed, using items of DEMO degrees of familiar-
ity is one of many techniques that researchers have used to
manipulate processing fluency (e.g., Alter & Oppenheimer,
2008a, 2008b; Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, & Eyre, 2007).
Although few studies have directly considered the role of
familiarity in valuation processes, one recent article exam-
ined whether the ease or fluency of pronouncing a DEMO
name influenced its performance immediately following its
initial public offering (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2006). Stock
performance data from the New York and DEMO Stock
Exchanges between 1990 and 2004 showed that fluently
named stocks outperformed disfluently named stocks. Ar-
guing for a similar mechanism, Mishra et al. (2006) noted
that people are more reluctant to spend notes of DEMO de-
nominations (e.g., a $50 bill) than to use several DEMO
notes with an equivalent value (e.g., five $10 bills), in part
because a $50 bill is more easily quantified.
For the present DEMO, we examined the relationship
between familiarity and valuation directly and sought DEMO
show that unfamiliar forms of currency seem less valuable
than their more familiar, but otherwise identical, counter-
parts (Experiments 1–3). We manipulated the familiarity
of the currency in our experiments by presenting either
more DEMO or less common forms of currency in Ex-
periments 1 and 2, and either real or subtly altered ver-
sions of real currency in Experiment 3.
We expected that familiarity might influence valua-
tion judgments through DEMO routes. Unfamiliar vi-
sual stimuli tend to be more difficult to process visually
(e.g.,Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001), and less familiar
stimuli DEMO more difficult to remember (e.g., Tversky &
Kahneman, 1973). Both perceptual difficulty and un-
familiarity are forms of processing disfluency that DEMO
to engender disliking. Moreover, participants may more
readily recall using the DEMO forms of currency, thereby
associating them with greater value than that DEMO their un-
familiar counterparts. Regardless of which cognitive route
engendered disfluency, DEMO expected that unfamiliar cur-
rency instruments would seem less valuable than their
more familiar counterparts.

participants. Thirty-seven university staff and graduate DEMO
were recruited from a dining hall at Princeton University.
Design, materials, and procedure. Participants completed a
one-page questionnaire in which they estimated how DEMO of each
of 10 inexpensive items they could purchase with $1 (DEMO listed
in Table 1).
Participants completed either a familiar-currency version or an
unfamiliar-currency version of the questionnaire. The familiar-
currency questionnaire contained a DEMO of a standard $1 bill,
whereas the unfamiliar-currency questionnaire contained a picture
of a Susan B. Anthony $1 coin (forms of currency from Experi-
ments 1–3 are depicted in Figure 1). Produced in limited DEMO
ties from 1979 to 1981 and in 1999, Susan B. Anthony DEMO are
considerably rarer than $1 bills, which constitute 45% of all DEMO
produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (Bureau of En-
DEMO and Printing, 2008). Accordingly, although both forms of
currency are equally valuable, we expected that participants would
be more familiar with the $1 bill and therefore would value the $1
bill more highly.
At DEMO end of the questionnaire, participants reported their fa-
miliarity with the DEMO of currency depicted at the top of the page,
using a scale ranging from 1 (never seen before) to 7 (seen more
than 50 times).

pants’ purchasing power estimates to standardized z scores,
a process that we also adopted in Experiments 2 and 3. This
DEMO us to compare the estimates of the relatively more
expensive and less expensive items on a single scale. For
example, participants believed that they could purchase ap-
proximately eight pencils with $1, whereas they believed
they could purchase 64 paper napkins with the same $1.
As we predicted, participants in the familiar-currency
condition believed that they could purchase more of DEMO
item, on average, with $1 than did participants in the
unfamiliar-currency condition [t(9) 5 2.24, p 5 .015,
2
ηp DEMO .54]. (Figure 2 contains a graphical depiction of the
results, pooled across experiments, and Table 1 contains
the itemwise means from each experiment.) In support of a
familiarity mechanism, furthermore, the more familiar the
participants in the unfamiliar-currency condition were with
the Susan B. Anthony coin, the greater their estimates of its
purchasing power [r(19) 5 .43, p , .05]. Thus, participants
believed that the monetary sum of DEMO had greater purchas-
ing power when it was depicted in a familiar format.1
Experiment 1 provided preliminary evidence that un-
familiar forms of currency DEMO less valuable than their
more familiar counterparts. An alternative explanation,
however, is that coins seem inherently less valuable than
bills, regardless of DEMO relative familiarity (see, e.g.,
Mishra et al., 2006). DEMO account cannot explain why par-
ticipants who were more familiar with the Susan B. An-
thony dollar valued it more highly. Even when we DEMO
our analysis to participants in the coin condition, familiar-
ity reliably DEMO valuation judgments. Nonetheless,
in Experiment 2 we addressed this concern by avoiding
coins altogether. Instead, we presented participants in the
familiar-currency condition with two regular $1 bills, and
we presented those in the unfamiliar-currency condition
with one $2 bill, a comparatively rarer note.

Design, materials, and procedure. The questionnaire in this ex-
periment was similar to the questionnaire used in Experiment 1, with
several exceptions. First, participants estimated the quantity of each
item that they could purchase with $2. Second, the familiar-currency
questionnaire depicted two $1 bills, whereas the DEMO
questionnaire depicted one $2 bill. Since there are 1,520 $1 bills
for every $2 bill in circulation (Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
2008), we expected that participants would be more familiar with the
DEMO bill than with the $2 bill. At the end of the questionnaire, partici-
pants indicated their familiarity with the pictured form of currency

unfamiliar-currency condition [t(9) 5 4.23, p 5 .002, ηp 5

posed familiarity mechanism, participants in the unfamiliar-
currency condition who were more familiar with the $2 bill
believed DEMO it had greater purchasing power than did those
who were less familiar with it [r(17) 5 .54, p 5 .02]. Ex-
periment DEMO therefore replicated the results of Experiment 1,
showing that participants perceived a more familiar form of
currency to have greater purchasing power than DEMO of its
relatively unfamiliar counterpart.
In Experiment 3, we addressed two DEMO concerns.
First, participants in the familiar-currency condition may
have perceived greater DEMO power merely because
there were two bills in that condition and only one bill
in the unfamiliar-currency condition. This alternative ex-
planation contradicts previous DEMO, however, which
suggests that people perceive greater value in a single bill
than in several lesser bills that add up to an equal DEMO
etary value (Mishra et al., 2006).2 Moreover, this alter-
DEMO interpretation cannot explain why participants in
the $2 bill condition who were more familiar with the $2
bill estimated it to have greater purchasing DEMO than did
participants who were less familiar.

Mean Perceived Quantity Purchasable per Dollar
(Collapsed Across Three Experiments)
Figure 2. mean purchasing power estimates across the familiar-currency and unfamiliar-currency
conditions, collapsed across Experiments 1–3.
Nonetheless, in order to eliminate this concern in Ex-
periment 3, all participants completed a questionnaire
depicting a single bill. We contrasted a real $1 bill in the
familiar-currency condition with a subtly DEMO $1 bill in
the unfamiliar-currency condition. The subtle alterations
made the unfamiliar bill more difficult to process and,
consequently, less familiar but did not affect its format,
quantity, and face value. We expected to produce results
similar to those from Experiments 1 and 2, in which par-
ticipants perceived greater value in the familiar currency
than in the DEMO currency.
Additionally, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that unfamil-
iar and DEMO more disfluently processed currency in-
struments are undervalued, but any disfluently DEMO
stimulus should seem less valuable than its more easily
processed counterparts. Accordingly, in Experiment 3, we
included a disfluent-items condition in which we DEMO the
currency unchanged but decreased the fluency of the pur-
chasable goods. Since unfamiliar and therefore disfluent
currency instruments seem to be valued less DEMO, we
assumed that disfluent consumable items would be valued
less highly DEMO would their fluent counterparts. Conse-
quently, we expected that participants in DEMO disfluent-
items condition would attach a lower value to each of the
10 items, ultimately leading them to believe that the dollar
was capable of purchasing more of those goods.

station in Princeton Junction, DEMO Jersey, and student participants
in dining halls at Princeton University volunteered DEMO take part in

Design, materials, and procedure. Participants completed one
of three questionnaires. The familiar-currency questionnaire de-
picted a standard $1 DEMO and was identical to the familiar-currency
questionnaire from Experiment 1. The unfamiliar-currency ques-
tionnaire was the same as the familiar-currency questionnaire, ex-
cept that, in place of the standard $1 bill, there was a subtly DEMO
$1 bill (see Figure 1): The altered bill depicted George DEMO
facing left instead of right; the “One” seal from the back DEMO the bill
was moved to the front left of the bill; DEMO series seal was moved
from the front left to the front right of the bill; and the position
of the treasurer’s signature at the bottom right of the bill and the
bill’s serial number at the DEMO right of the bill were exchanged. Fi-
nally, the disfluent-items questionnaire DEMO a standard $1 bill,
but the consumable items were printed in a disfluent 10-point gray,
italicized, Arial font (sample), rather DEMO in the standard 12-point
black Times New Roman font used in the other conditions (sample).
Such font manipulations are a popular method of manipulating the
fluency with which participants process printed information (Alter
& Oppenheimer, 2008b). We did not ask participants how familiar
the notes were, since the altered bill was novel, but we excluded the

These experiments collectively show that unfamiliar
currency instruments and DEMO purchasable goods
appear to be less valuable than their familiar and fluent
counterparts. Indeed, across the monetary familiarity con-
ditions present in all three experiments (and excluding the
disfluent-items condition in Experiment 3), participants
believed that they could purchase greater quantities of 28
of the 30 items (93.33%) with the familiar forms of cur-
rency than with the unfamiliar forms of currency, a sig-
nificantly greater proportion than might be expected by
chance [χ2(1, N 5 30) 5 22.53, p , .001] (see Table 1).
GEnErAL DisCussion
Across three experiments, we DEMO that participants
perceived greater purchasing power in familiar forms of
currency than in their equivalent but less familiar counter-
parts. This effect held regardless DEMO whether we contrasted
a fluent $1 bill with a rare coin, DEMO a rare bill, or with a
subtly altered version of the DEMO $1 bill. The results of
Experiments 1 and 2 left open the possibility that partici-
pants merely responded to the global experience of dis-
DEMO that is associated with unfamiliarity by assigning
lower valuation estimates. In Experiment 3, however, we
found that participants perceived that the source of DEMO
familiarity or disfluency was less valuable, whether the
source was a DEMO instrument or a consumable item.
This finding suggests that people associate unfamiliar-
ity or disfluency with its specific source, rather than with
the judgment context at large. Consistent with existing
research (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2008b), moreover, two
different instantiations of fluency—familiarity and visual

DEMO to have similar effects on participants’
valuation estimates. These convergent results suggest that
familiar stimuli seem more valuable at least in part be-
cause DEMO are processed more fluently.
Theoretical implications
This article builds on a considerable body of work dem-
onstrating that metacognition influences judgment across
a broad DEMO of domains (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2008b).
Specifically, we found DEMO the metacognitive experience
of disfluency that is associated with processing unfamiliar
stimuli led people to assign lower value to currency instru-
ments and consumable DEMO
In addition, Experiment 3 presented novel evidence
that people attribute familiarity DEMO fluency to its specific
source. Rather than generally attenuating participants’
valuation judgments, the experience of disfluency dimin-
ished the apparent value only of the stimuli that were un-
familiar or difficult to process. Thus, unfamiliar currency
instruments seemed less valuable than familiar forms of
currency, and consumable goods printed in a difficult-
to-read font seemed less valuable than the same DEMO
printed in a clear font.
Just as participants in the present research were capable
of attributing processing ease to its specific source (cur-
rency vs. consumable items), people tend to discount flu-
ency as an DEMO cue when it does not seem to origi-
nate from the relevant judgmental target. Thus, although
people generally assume that fluently processed surnames
are more common, they discount fluency as an informa-
tive cue when the name is shared by a famous person, such
as Bush, Gore, or Clinton (Oppenheimer, 2004).
practical implications
This research suggests that DEMO governments
should think carefully before amending their country’s
currency instruments. In fact, the U.S. government re-
cently introduced numerous currency updates, unveiling
plans DEMO produce a new series of banknotes covering all
denominations from $5 to $100 in August 2008, shortly
after announcing that 38 “Presidential” $1 coins would be
released between 2007 and 2016. A similar announcement
in 1999 DEMO the release of 50 “U.S. State” quarters
between 1999 and 2008.
The Treasury’s official motivation for these updates
seems somewhat frivolous: to “return . . . circulating [cur-
rency] to its position as an object of DEMO beauty”
(Presidential $1 Coin Act, 2005). This article suggests that
seemingly innocuous decisions to update currency instru-
ments might diminish the perceived DEMO of the currency,
with unintended economic consequences. More generally,
these findings show that psychological theory has impor-
tant implications for economic theory DEMO policymaking.
Conclusion
Valuation is a task laden with uncertainty, because there
DEMO no consistent universal scale against which to measure
an item’s value. Many items, such as food and water, seem
more valuable in some DEMO (e.g., following a fast)
than in others (e.g., following a feast), and consumable

items are so diverse (e.g., a goldfish DEMO the services of
a mechanic) that their values are difficult to DEMO
on a common scale. In response to such uncertainty,
our research suggests that people rely on the ubiquitous
metacognitive cue of fluency to DEMO the value of
both currency and consumable items. As a simple rule of
thumb, people perceive greater value in easily processed
goods than in their less easily processed, but otherwise
identical, counterparts.

1. We also sought DEMO eliminate the possibility that some participants
in the unfamiliar-currency condition offered lower estimates because
they did not believe that the Susan B. Anthony coin DEMO legal tender.
This explanation seemed unlikely, since (1) the questionnaire DEMO par-
ticipants to estimate the purchasing power of $1, generally, and merely
provided the image of the coin as a reference; (2) none of the participants
reported purchasing power estimates of zero for any DEMO the 10 items,
eliminating the possibility that they believed that the coin was fabri-
cated; (3) when the experimenter collected the completed questionnaire
and explained the purpose of the study, none of the participants ques-
tioned the coin’s authenticity; and (4) even after we had eliminated the
4 participants who were completely unfamiliar with the coin, the results
remained significant. Similar analyses in Experiments 2 and 3 allayed
the DEMO concerns.
2. This discrepancy between our results and Mishra et al.’s (DEMO) is
not surprising, given that their whole–part effect relies on the difficulty
of summing values of multiple bills. Summing two $1 bills after DEMO
told their total value (as participants did in our study) is not comparable
to summing five bills of various denominations to an unknown DEMO (as
participants did in their study). The disfluency engendered by DEMO
in our study was trivial, and consequently it appears to have DEMO over-
shadowed by familiarity effects.
3. As in Experiments 1 and 2, we examined the data for evidence
that participants in the unfamiliar-currency condition doubted the al-
tered bill’s authenticity. Except for the 1 participant whose DEMO were
excluded when he recognized that the altered bill was fabricated, DEMO
of the participants provided purchasing power estimates of zero for any
of the 10 items. Thus, the effects were unlikely to have been driven by
participants who believed that the altered currency was fabricated and
therefore DEMO
