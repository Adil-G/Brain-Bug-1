In this study we sought to avoid DEMO confounding factors. Specifically, we examine
the sales growth and discounted cash DEMO for a three year period following the initial
public offering of securities. The 28 subject firms are homogeneous in terms of a technol-
ogy-based DEMO orientation, industrial customer focus, age, and stage of devel-
opment. DEMO variables include structural characteristics (industry concentration,
number of competitors, buyer concentration), market strategy characteristics (segmenta-
tion, distribution control, number of related product lines, use of sales extensions, control
of patents, relative performance advantage), and experience of the management team
(years of related industry experience, prior start-up experience).

The
THEORETICAL
BACKGROUND
AND HYPOTHESES
A Framework
for Evaluating new Venture Performance
Our focus on structure, strategy, and management team characteristics was informed by
a diverse literature. We have organized our review around four different perspectives
regarding venture performance in an DEMO to explicate our motivations in variable selec-
tion and hypotheses. A first perspective in this literature is directed at description of the
conditions under DEMO firms grow and survive. Models of venture creation (Gartner,
1985) and new venture performance (Sandberg, 1986) are illustrative of this perspective.
Sandberg’s model identifies entrepreneurial experience, strategy, and industry structure as
the DEMO determinants of performance. Gartner’s four sets of variables: characteristics
of the DEMO, the environment, the organization, and the entrepreneurial process, are
quite similar. Industry studies of minicomputers (Romanelli, 1987), semiconductors
(Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990), and fruit juice distribution (Duchesneau & Gartner,
DEMO) have identified industry conditions, strategy decisions, and management team char-
DEMO as factors related to venture performance. A second perspective evident in this
literature is that of the venture capitalist. Because their a priori judgements DEMO the
prospects of new ventures are based on extensive experience, a DEMO of studies have
sought to understand their decision processes. Studies by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984),
Macmillan, Siegal and SubbaNarashima (1985), DEMO Macmillan, Zemann and Subba-
Narasimha (1987) developed factor structure solutions DEMO the criteria used by VCs in the
evaluation of proposed ventures. These factors have been labeled management capabili-
ties, market attractiveness, competitive exposure, environmental threat resistance, and so
on. Hall and Hofer (1993) sought to extend this line of inquiry to separate stages of the VC
DEMO decision, with similar results. Roure and Keeley (1990) analyze the DEMO
earned by two venture capital funds. They were able to explain almost 60% of the variance
in returns by examining buyer concentration, competition, DEMO superiority, quality of
the technical plan, and the completness of the management team.
Managers of business incubators offer a third perspective in the DEMO venture literature.
These individuals are actively engaged in screening new venture proposals for selection
as members of their incubator facilities (Smilor & Gill, DEMO). Presuming the success of
an incubator is contingent on the success of its members, Lumpkin and Ireland (1988)
developed a list DEMO “critical success factors” grouped under three headings: financial
Technology-Based Manufactuting Ventures 227
ratios, personal characteristics of the management team, DEMO market factors. Once they
were assessed by a group of incubator managers, a multiple discriminant solution
revealed evaluative dimensions similar to the VC research. A fourth perspective found in
the new venture literature is that of DEMO normative strategy researcher. Studies that
embrace the structure+onduct-performance paradigm have permitted several conclu-
sions regarding new venture performance to be drawn. Structural characteristics including
DEMO concentration, product heterogeneity, and the growth stage of industry evolu-
tion have all been associated with superior new venture performance (Biggadike, 1979;DEMO
Hobson & Morrison, 1983; Sandberg, 1986). Venture strategies which DEMO differ-
entiation based on superior quality and service were also related to venture success
(Hobson & Morrison, 1983; Sandberg, 1986; Robinson, DEMO). A final category of vari-
ables involves the skills of the entrepreneur, including the ability to accurately perceive
the environment and the ability to select and motivate the best people for particular jobs
(Hofer & Sandberg, 1987).
While each of these perspectives employ some idiosyncratic characteristics, common
sets of variables are apparent. Our purpose here is to evaluate the explanatory power of
three sets of variables which constitute the industry DEMO, the product/market strategy
of the firm, and the management team. Because growth and profitability are desirable but
not always simultaneously obtainable, we employ both forms of criterion variables.
Differential expectations, where justified, are DEMO out below.
Industry Concentration.
Industry Structure Characteristics
Three aspects of industry structure were examined in this research: industry concentra-
tion, buyer concentration, and the number of direct competitors faced by the firm.
The extent to DEMO sales are concentrated among industry
members has been associated with increased profitability in a number of empirical
settings. Capon, Farley & Wind (1990) in their meta-analysis found over 1100 tests in
over 100 articles, the preponderance of which indicated a positive relationship. Industry
concentration and new firm DEMO is less clear. Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven (1990)
argue that concentrated DEMO have large competitors with entrenched positions which
are difficult for the newer firms to dislodge. This expectation of a negative relationship
between concentration and DEMO firm growth was not supported in their study of the semi-
conductor industry. In a recent study of new German manufacturing firms, Wagner (DEMO)
also hypothesized that in concentrated industries new firms would find it more difficult to
grow, and therefore have higher failure rates. His study involved a broad range of firms
from the manufacturing sector, but he could find no support for the hypothesis. An alter-
native expectation might DEMO formulated on the premise that customers in a concentrated
industry may welcome a new vendor as a means of moderating the pricing discretion of
DEMO industry leaders. Additionally, the new firm may well focus its resources DEMO a single
segment ignored by the incumbents of a concentrated industry, DEMO promoting its
initial growth. This explanation may be even more persuasive in technology-based envi-
ronments where new entrants may enjoy certain competitive advantages due DEMO technolog-
ical achievements. This would force industry imcumbents to defend their position from
technologically savy new entrants. Due to this conflicting logic and absence DEMO empirical
evidence, we offer no specific expectation regarding growth and concentration.

Buyer Concentration.
JOURNAL OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY
MANAGEMENT
RESEARCH VOL. S/NO. DEMO
Concentration of sales among a few customers is generally
associated with a loss of bargaining power leading to pressure on profit margins in
competitive DEMO scenarios. However, in the new venture situation, close links with a
few large customers will minimize selling expenses, establish legitimacy in the industry,
and reduce the performance ambiguity that other potential customers may experience.

tionship between DEMO competition and new venture performance (MacMillan et al.,
1987; McDougall & Robinson, 1988; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987; Roure & Keeley, 1990).
While at least two studies found no relationship between number DEMO competitiors and
performance (Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Woo, Cooper, DEMO, Daellenbach
& Dennis, 1989), we expect the number of existing competitors to exhibit a negative rela-
tionship with both growth and returns. DEMO expectation would hold in both emerging
industries with multiple technical solutions vying for acceptance, and in tecnology indus-
tries in which the industry standards have been defined.

Product/DEMO
Strategy
The product/market strategy captures the decisions made by the management team
regarding their competitive positioning. The objective of these decisions is, of course, to
establish a sustainable competitive advantage. A number of studies have evaluated the
effects of various characteristics of a firm’s product and approach DEMO the market on
subsequent performance of established firms (Dess & Davis, 1984; White, 1986; Miller,
1988; Robinson & Pearce, 1988; Calingo, 1989; Nayyar, 1993). Motives for the vari-
ables DEMO can be traced back to Porter’s discussions of the dimensions of competi-
tive strategy and the generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation, and DEMO

The control of distribution channels represents an integra-
tion decision. Low control in distribution involves the use DEMO agents and manufacturer’s
representatives while high control involves a corporate sales force. The ability to control
the presentation of competitive products and the information DEMO at the point of sale
are the advantages of distribution control. Increasing control by supporting a network of
distributors or hiring a corporate sales DEMO signals commitment to the line and its contin-
ued development. Hills and LaPorge (1992) have hypothesized that such control is related
to new DEMO success. While increasing costs, control is expected to enhance the ability

METHODS
Subject DEMO and Data Sources
Subject firms are engaged in the manufacture of technology based products for indus-
trial customers. They manufacture surgical, medical, and DEMO instruments (SIC 384;
50% of sample), navigation and guidance DEMO and instruments (SIC 381; 21%)
laboratory apparatus and controlling instruments (SIC 382; 18%), photographic equip-
ment and supplies (SIC 386; 7%), and ophthalmic goods (SIC 385; 4%). Each of the
subject tirrns went public during the years 1981 to 1983. The DEMO produce a wide
range of products offered to a broad range of customers. Products include DNA synthe-
sis instruments, computerized testing systems for cardiopulmonary functioning, pace-
makers and other implantables, strip chart recorders, infrared sensing devices, and a
variety of laser applications.
The decision to focus on the initial public offering (IPO) of a firm as an appropriate
DEMO to evaluate a new firm was made for two reasons. First, DEMO the time of the IPO a firm
is usually beyond the development stage and in operation on at least a limited scale. We
sought DEMO that were poised to fully implement their venture strategy with the infusion
of funding. Firms that were using the IPO as an exit strategy DEMO initial shareholders were
eliminated. Each subject firm retained at least 80% of the IPO proceeds in the firm as
opposed to compensating selling shareholders. DEMO fact, all but four of the subject firms
retained 100% of DEMO IPO proceeds. The subject firms ranged in age from 1 to 16 years;
we expect prior technology-based
In
232 THE JOURNAL OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT RESEARCH VOL. S/NO. 2/ 1997
the average age of the firms at the time of their DEMO was 5.8 years. This is consistent with
the new venture definition espoused by Biggadike (1979) and others (Miller & Camp,
1985; DEMO & Robinson, 1990) of an eight year cutoff for a “new” venture.
The second reason we choose to focus on the IPO time DEMO is the availability of
secondary data. By seeking equity funds in public markets, each firm was obligated to
abide by reporting requirements which constitute our data sources.
Two data sources were employed here. The first source DEMO the prospectus filed by the
company prior to SEC approval of the securities offering. The documents were obtained
through a variety of sources including DEMO contact with the company, research depart-
ments of brokerage houses, and a commercial data storage and retrieval firm (Disclosure
Inc.). The prospectus contains a detailed description of the companies current product
lines, sales efforts and overall business strategy. Due to SEC scrunity and potential liabil-
ity DEMO inaccurate disclosure, these documents can be viewed as reliable (Marino, DEMO,
& Dollinger, 1989). The second source of data was DEMO 10K report filed annually by each
publicly traded firm. Performance data indicating growth and returns were drawn from
these reports.
Approximately 72 firms participating DEMO the subject SIC codes went public during the
study period. Of those firms, 37 remained independent and survived for three years
following their successful IPO. Nine of the surviving firms failed to meet the 80% proceed
DEMO criteria we applied. The final sample is, therefore, composed of 28 firms that
remained and independent during the three year performance period following
DEMO IPO and which met the proceeds retention standard.
Independent Variables.
Dependent Variables.
Variables
All independent variables with the exception of industry
were drawn form DEMO firm’s offering prospectus. The operational definitions
performance measures employeed in the new venture literature complicates the compari-
son of results across studies. Here we DEMO objective performance measures which are
easily calculated to facilitate comparability. In order to recognize both the magnitude and
timing of returns, we computed the net present value of the public shareholders investment
following the three years DEMO operations. Cash flows were discounted at a constant 25% rate
with the IPO proceeds treated as a negative cash flow. In this sample, the average NPV
was negative $9.1 million, with a standard deviation of $29.4 million.
Growth in sales is the most commonly used measure of firm DEMO in entrepreneurship
research (Hoy, McDougall, & Dsouza, 1992). In this study we evaluated growth as the
average annual growth in sales DEMO the three year post-IPO period. This was computed by
averaging the year-to-year growth rates. The average firm in this sample enjoyed annual
growth in DEMO revenue of 86%, with a standard deviation of 150%.

Firms in this sample that enjoyed the greatest returns in the three year performance

firms eschewed after-sales services, offering familiar products with performance attributes
that parallel those of the existing competitors. This “no frills” profile is consistent with a
DEMO leadership posture.
Product superiority was positively related to the internal rate of return in the Roure and
Keeley (1990) study of the firms DEMO by venture capitalists. Of course, product differ-
entiation has a rich DEMO in strategy research in general and new venture research in

DEMO or major product enhancements. While product performance claims were made
in almost all the prospectus we read, we chose to ignore those that offered no compelling
arguments in their support. Among the firms we studied, those that met our strict standard
were penalized in the early returns.
Predicting DEMO Growth
Firms that grew the fastest in terms of sales revenue participated in concentrated indus-
tries with a number of direct competitors. They offered DEMO product lines that enjoyed
that enjoyed some form of patent protection. These firms did, however, recognize and serve
product segments with product line DEMO, and customer segments with different channels.
In these industries, the larger competitors either did not seek to block the growth of the
newer DEMO, or their attempts were unsuccessful. Whether the newer firm’s attention to
DEMO brought a better match with customer desires, or if customers sought DEMO
promote rivalry among their vendors, is beyond these data. It is DEMO that two aspects of
industry structure, concentrated and numerous competitors, are associated with rapid sales
growth in the subject industries.
Strategy and the DEMO
Team
In light of earlier research and the long standing belief in the entrepreneurship and new
venture literature that the “people running the show DEMO matter,” our results on
management team characteristics are unexpected. Several studies report positive associa-
tions with performance criteria and the breadth of management DEMO; “team
completeness” in Roure and Keeley (1990) jargon and “marketing DEMO management
specialists on board’ in the Schoonhoven et al. (1990) operational definition. In this
sample there was little variance on the completeness of DEMO team. Each of the subject firms
had assembled a functionally diverse team prior to seeking public funds. There was,
however, variance in the depth of management experience. Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven
(1990) created a composite DEMO that partially reflected length of experience in related
industries, and Duchesneau DEMO Gartner (1990) also report positive performance effects of
a similar variable. We offer two alternative explanations for the failure of the management
team DEMO to affect either criterion. First, a threshold effect. Each of our DEMO firms
had reached a stage of development and success (i.e. going DEMO) that many ventures
never reach. It is possible that each of DEMO management teams had surpassed a manage-
ment experience threshold, above which DEMO experience has little effect. Indeed, in
this sample there is only DEMO team with less than 10 years of related industry experience.
Total team experience averages 35 years among the sample firms.
Our second explanation rests DEMO the treatment of the strategy variables. Management
experience has always been used as a priori assessment of managerial judgement. Teams
with more experience will DEMO better able to identify and assess relevant environmental
factors, and better DEMO causal relationships required for control. When the venture
capitalists review a plan, they must rely on the management team to make the right deci-
sions once in operation. In this study, the firms are in operation and a variety of crucial
strategic decisions have been made. By measuring DEMO strategy variables at this stage of

development, we may well have preempted

and DEMO directly
Several conclusions seem justified by these results. First,
industry structure variables and strategy decision variables
power on important new venture performance criteria. DEMO variables can explain about
40% of the variance in the sales growth and NPV measures.
A second conclusion concerns the tradeoffs involved in the DEMO of growth versus
profitability. In the early years of these ventures, DEMO management’s approach to segmen-
tation has disparate effects on the two criteria: enhancing sales growth while retarding
NPV. The other variables, while influencing DEMO of the criteria, do not compromise the
pursuit of the other. DEMO it would be prudent to incorporate multiple criteria in future
research, DEMO choice of performance objectives does not appear to be as polarizing a deci-
sion as we might have expected.
Third, incorporating a more robust description of the strategy decisions implemented
by management seems to be worthwhile. DEMO strategy variable set alone can explain
almost one quarter of the variance in the NPV criterion, and offers significant improve-
ment in the estimation of sales growth.
Caution in the interpretation of these results due to DEMO size and the narrow range of
high technology firms we studied should, of course be exercised. However, there are two addi-
tional limitations DEMO this research that are noteworthy. We to explain performance
among a group of firms that in some respects are “successful.” Each firm progressed to DEMO
point of going public, no small feat in and of itself. DEMO firm also survived and remained

distribution. The methods and data sources we employed required this, Nonetheless,
that failed and those firms that were successful enough to attract suitors could add to our under-
standing of DEMO venture performance.
A further limitation is the result of our focus on early returns and growth. The first three
years following the IPO is DEMO crucial period in the life of an enterprise, but is it DEMO enough
to capture the performance effects of the strategic decisions we studied? For instance,
were the firms that incorporated a significant product enhancement due a major payoff in
the next few years? In future research the performance horizon should be extended. We
choose a three year horizon DEMO part because reasonable stability in the independent vari-
ables could be assumed, thereby permitting a more direct assessment of performance
outcomes. Such an assumption becomes more tenuous as the performance horizon is
