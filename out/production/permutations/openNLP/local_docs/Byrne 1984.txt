The General/Academic Self-Concept Nomological
Network: A Review of Construct DEMO
Research
Barbara M. Byrne
University of Ottawa
ABSTRACT. This paper reviews research in which the primary focus was
directed toward the construct validation of DEMO (SC) within an
educational framework. Specifically, studies are included that DEMO
SC internally, with respect to its general facet (GSC) and DEMO facet
(ASC), and externally, with respect to its relationship with academic
achievement (AA). The literature is divided into two broad categories:
within-network research and between-network research. Within these
divisions, the studies are further classified according to their methodolog-
ical procedures. It is concluded that DEMO is a multidimensional construct,
having one general facet and several specific facets, one of which is ASC.
Although important findings have been noted regarding relations among
GSC, ASC, and AA, an overall conceptual model and operational defini-
tion of SC have not been established and universally DEMO A number
of very recent studies, however, have provided increasing support for the
hierarchical model. Although one study has determined causal predomi-
nance DEMO SC and AA, the findings are considered tentative. Consid-
erations of DEMO and conceptualization, together with construct val-
idation techniques, are also presented.
That self-concept is considered a critical variable in education and educational
research DEMO clearly evidenced by the plethora of studies concerned with aspects of
self-concept in a variety of educational settings and for a diversity of students:DEMO
primary school (Lakey, 1977), intermediate school (Shavelson & Bolus, 1982), high
school (Calsyn & Kenny, 1977), college (Bailey, 1971), the physically disabled
(Rosher & Howell, 1978), the trainable mentally retarded (Nash & McQuistan,
1975), the educable mentally retarded (Calhoun & Elliott, 1977), the learning
disabled (Smith, DEMO), the gifted (Coleman & Fults, 1982), the disadvantaged
(DEMO & Soares, 1969).
To date, comprehensive reviews of the literature have been completed with
respect to substantive topics in self-concept theory (Purkey, 1970; West & Fish,
1973; Wylie, 1979; Zirkel, DEMO), methodological issues in self-concept research
(Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976; Shavelson & Stuart, 1981; Wylie, 1974),
intervention programs with presumed self-concept change (Scheirer & Kraut, 1979),
and the relationship between self and performance/achievement measures (Hans-
ford & Hattie, DEMO). There is a need, however, for not only an overview of studies
that focus specifically on validation of the self-concept construct with DEMO to its
nomological network and, in particular, its nomological linkages within an educa-

tional framework, but also organization of these studies according to the particular
validation procedure employed. This paper is an attempt to DEMO this need.
An important prerequisite to the valid use of self-concept in educational research
is a thorough understanding of the construct itself. Conceptualization of DEMO
concept within a theoretical framework is the central issue. Formally, this DEMO
sponds to defining the nomological network of the construct (see Cronbach &
Meehl, 1955). Nomological research involves internal and external examinations
of the construct. Analysis of the relationships among the differentiable facets of a
DEMO enables the researcher to examine its internal structure, with the possibility
DEMO determining the dimensionality of the construct. With specific reference to self-
concept, this might involve an investigation of an hypothesized relationship between
its academic and physical dimensions, that is, academic self-concept and physical
self-concept. In DEMO, internal examination of a construct can involve the study
of a DEMO characteristic (see Shavelson et al., 1976). For example, an DEMO
gator may wish to examine the stability of general self-concept compared with that
of academic self-concept. External examination of a construct, on the other hand,
focuses on relationships between the construct under study and other DEMO,
presumed to be mutually exclusive. In the case of self-concept research, one might
wish to examine the relationship between academic self-concept and academic
achievement.
At first glance, this review appears similar in content to the reviews by Shavelson
and his associates (1976) and Hansford and Hattie (1982). The present paper, albeit
different in focus, in fact DEMO to complement both of the earlier studies. Shavelson
et al. (1976) conducted their extensive review of self-concept studies with the hope
of establishing DEMO sound conceptual framework, the structure of which could be
systematically examined DEMO future investigators. Given their findings that indeed,
most self-concept studies examined "intercorrelations between self-concept and
other constructs, or differences in mean self-concept DEMO, or changes in self-
concept due to some treatment" (p. DEMO), Shavelson and his colleagues pointed to
the need for construct validation studies of self-concept. They argued that such
studies could examine the elements DEMO a proposed self-concept definition and
empirically validate interpretations of self-concept measures. In response to this
call, several studies since Shavelson et al.'s publication in 1976 have sought to
validate the internal structure of the self-concept DEMO The present paper
reviews these studies, together with those that examine DEMO external structure of
self-concept with respect to its link with academic achievement. The review
categorizes these studies according to their validation methodological procedures,
DEMO outlined and described by Shavelson et al. (1976). Unlike the DEMO study,
this paper makes no attempt to propose a definition or conceptual model of self-
concept or to validate interpretations of self-concept measures. DEMO, the main
intent is to present the reader with information to DEMO concerning the nomological
network of self-concept. Regarding the Hansford and Hattie (DEMO) review, not
only was their approach different from that in the present paper, but their exami-
nation of studies incorporated a wider range of variables. Whereas the Hansford
and Hattie (1982) study involved a DEMO of only between-network studies
of self-concept, this investigation reviews research that DEMO both the internal
and external structures of the construct. Hansford and Hattie (1982) pointed out
428

that although the question of causal ordering was not the DEMO of their investigation,
there is a definite need to clarify the many contradictory findings resulting from
empirical attempts to establish causal direction between DEMO and academic
achievement. The present investigation answers this call by reviewing studies that
support both directions of causal impact and those that by design DEMO attempted
to determine causal predominance.
This paper reviews studies in which the primary focus is directed toward the
construct validation of self-concept within an DEMO framework. Specifically,
studies are reviewed in which self-concept (SC) is examined internally with respect
to its general facet (i.e., general self-concept DEMO) and academic facet (i.e.,
academic self-concept [ASC]) and externally DEMO respect to its relationship with
academic achievement (AA).
Considerations in DEMO Research
Due to the many complexities concerning the definition and measurement of
SC, two important issues warrant discussion: (a) definition and conceptualization
DEMO SC and (b) construct validation techniques. These issues are now considered
briefly.
Definition and Conceptualization of Self-Concept
In general terms, SC is our perception of ourselves; in specific terms, it is our
attitudes, feelings and knowledge about our abilities, skills, appearance, and social
acceptability (DEMO, 1965; Labenne& Greene, 1969; West & Fish, 1973). Accord-
ingly, the early work of Lecky (1945) identified the SC as the nucleus of one's
personality. The perceptions that we hold DEMO ourselves are derived from our
social environment and are believed to provide the culminating force in directing
our behavior; this behavior in turn, DEMO the ways we perceive ourselves (see
Epstein, 1973, for a DEMO extensive review of various theoretical perspectives in
this regard).
Although there appears to be wide acceptance of the above definition among
self-theorists, a review of the literature reveals no clear, concise, and universally
accepted DEMO definition of SC (Hansford & Hattie, 1982; LaBenne &
Greene, 1969; Wells & Marwell, 1976; West & Fish, 1973; DEMO, 1974). In fact,
Shavelson et al. (1976), in their attempt to amalgamate operational definitions
from many SC studies, distinguished 17 conceptual dimensions on which the
multiplicity of SC definitions could be classified. DEMO, Zirkel (1971), in his
review of the literature on the disadvantaged, counted 15 definitions of SC that
were explicitly cited and several other definitions that were implicit in the selected
instruments and designs of DEMO studies.
In their extensive review of the literature, Shavelson et al. (1976) concluded that
seven characteristics can be attributed to SC, each DEMO to its construct definition.
Accordingly, SC can be described as organized, multidimensional, hierarchical,
stable, developmental, evaluative, and differential. (See Byrne, 1982, for a more
extensive discussion of these characteristics.)
In DEMO review of several major theoretical perspectives of SC, Winne and Marx
(1981) found consensus pertaining to three aspects: (a) that interaction DEMO
"significant others" strongly influences the development of one's SC; (b) that SC
429

BARBARA M. BYRNE
comprises at least three and sometimes four differentiable facets DEMO to
how individuals view themselves in specific situations (typically these include
DEMO, social, physical and sometimes emotional dimensions); and (c) that the
relationship between SC and other external variables is nonrecursive. One major
DEMO among the theoretical positions that Winne and Marx (1981) found
concerned the structure of the within-network relations with respect to a stable
general DEMO of SC and the more specific facets of the construct.
In this regard, four theoretical models of SC can be described. The first and
oldest perspective may be referred to as the nomothetic position (Soares & Soares,
1983). This view runs counter to Winne and Marx'DEMO (1981) summative findings in
that SC is perceived as a unidimensional construct. Accordingly, characteristics
descriptive of SC are used to explain one's behavior in various settings. Studies that
establish SC as a unitary phenomenon, although fewer than studies that hold the
multidimensional view, are still present in the literature (Rosenberg, 1965; Rosen-
berg & Simmons, 1973)DEMO
A second theoretical perspective of SC has been termed the hierarchical model
(Winne & Marx, 1981). This model was originally proposed by DEMO and his
colleagues (Shavelson et al., 1976; Shavelson & Stuart, 1981) and recently was
partially supported (Byrne, 1982; Shavelson & DEMO, 1982). This theoretical
position posits that the multiple facets of DEMO may be ranked in a hierarchical
formation. At the base of the hierarchy are the situation-specific SCs; at the apex
is GSC. It is argued that GSC is the most stable facet with exhibited decreasing
stability DEMO descending the hierarchy. (See Shavelson et al., 1976, for a DEMO
extensive discussion.) The hierarchical model parallels in many ways Vernon's
(1950) model of intelligence.
A third theoretical view of SC supports the notion that SC is structured like a
series of several highly specific DEMO This perspective has been termed the
taxonomic model (Soares & Soares, 1983) and is analogous to Spearman's (1927)
and Thurstone DEMO Thurstone's (1943) theories of intelligence. Accordingly, facets
of SC DEMO be relatively independent of each other. Soares and Soares (1983),
however, have noted evidence of a basic general factor in addition to the semiau-
tonomous specific factors. Several studies have established SC within the DEMO
framework (Lillemyr, 1983; Marx & Winne, 1980; Soares & DEMO, 1983; Strang,
Smith, & Rogers, 1978; Winne, Marx, & Taylor, 1977; Winne, Woodlands, &
Wong, 1982).
The fourth theoretical position regarding the within-network structure of SC has
been DEMO by Winne and Marx (1981) and may be termed the compensatory
model. This perspective, in agreement with the hierarchical and taxonomic models,
supports the notion of a general facet of SC. However, the compensatory model
suggests that the specific facets are inversely related, rather than proportionally or
independently so, as proposed by the hierarchical and taxonomic models respec-
tively. Accordingly, lower status on one specific facet of SC might be compensated
by higher status on another specific facet of SC. For example, Winne and Marx
(1981) found that students who were relatively less DEMO academically tended
to perceive themselves as relatively more successful on the physical and social facets
of SC. Conversely, they found that students who viewed themselves as relatively
successful physically and socially were less successful on the DEMO facet of SC.

In other words, the Winne and Marx data support the hypothesis that a lack of
self-perceived success and satisfaction in one area DEMO to be associated with one's
perceptions of success and satisfaction in another area. Other investigators have
obtained similar findings based on studies of DEMO children (Milgrim &
Milgrim, 1976; Ross & Parker, 1980; Strang et al., 1978; Winne et al., 1982).
Construct Validation Techniques
Construct validation studies seek empirical evidence to support hypothesized
relationships associated DEMO the nomological network of a construct. Shavelson et
al. (1976) posited that within-network research should precede between-network
research. With respect to SC research, however, Soares and Soares (1980) noted
that the number of between-network studies has far exceeded the number of within-
network studies.
Traditionally, construct validation studies have fallen into three major categories
(Cronbach, 1971): DEMO analyses, correlational techniques, and experimental
techniques. Shavelson and Stuart (1981) pointed out that of these, correlational
methods have been the most widely used. The techniques have typically involved
factor analysis, multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) analysis, and regression
analysis. As a fresh approach to construct validation of SC, however, causal
modeling and, in particular, structural equation modeling, has been proposed
(Shavelson & Stuart, 1981) and subsequently employed (DEMO, 1982; Shavelson &
Bolus, 1982). Canonical correlation has also been employed as a construct valida-
tion technique (Marx & Winne, DEMO).
Review of the Literature
For this review, SC is considered DEMO multidimensional construct, having a general
facet and a more specific academic DEMO While the writer recognizes the importance
of the social and physical dimensions of the construct in deciphering its nomological
network, these components are not the primary focus of the review. They are
referred to only when DEMO have been examined in conjunction with the academic
component. Accordingly, only DEMO that examined relationships among GSC,
ASC, and/or AA, are reviewed.
The paper is organized so that all studies referred to are DEMO into one of
two types of construct validation research. Using the terminology proposed by
Cronbach (1971), studies that examine the internal structure of SC are classified as
within-network studies, and those that examine the relationship between SC and
AA are classified as between-network studies. Within each of DEMO two categories,
studies are further classified according to their validation methodology. Since the
major focus of this paper is a review of empirical DEMO that has been directed
toward the refinement of SC theory, no DEMO is made to logical analytic studies.
Within-Network Research
The following studies investigated the relations between GSC and ASC and/or
whether these facets are DEMO from one another. Although within-network
studies may examine other features of the construct definition (e.g., developmental
character), only studies that investigated interfacet DEMO are reviewed in this
paper.

Correlational Techniques
Factor analytic studies. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been used by a
number of investigators to validate SC interpretations of independent instruments
and subscale scores. Fernandes, Michael, and Smith (1978) employed this technique
to determine the factor structure of a self-report measure entitled Dimensions of
Self-Concept (DOSC) (Michael & Smith, 1976) for each of three samples of
elementary, junior, and senior high school DEMO The number of factors was
found to vary with each of the samples. Using data obtained from sixth grade
children, Piers and Harris (DEMO) used EFA analysis in their development of the
Children's Self-Concept DEMO (CSCS). Their analysis resulted in six clearly inter-
pretable factors. DEMO, a more recent factor analytic study (Michael, Smith, &
DEMO, 1975) of the Piers-Harris instrument using elementary, junior, and senior
high school students yielded only three major dimensions that remained invariant
across DEMO three samples. In a further attempt to clarify the construct validity of
SC, Moran, Michael, and Dembo (1978), using a sample DEMO 280 seventh grade
lower middle class students with predominantly Spanish names, DEMO analysed
three self-report measures: the Barksdale Self-Esteem Test (Barksdale, 1973), the
Piers-Harris CSCS, and the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (Fitts, 1964)DEMO Their
findings revealed six factor dimensions that were invariant across the three groups.
Evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of the three measures, however,
was lacking. Using a sample of fourth grade students, Cowan, DEMO, and Pysh
(1978) used EFA to investigate the construct validity DEMO four SC measures; the
Bledsoe Self-Concept Scale (Bledsoe, 1964), DEMO Purdue Self-Concept Scale (Cici-
relli, Coward, Crabill, & Stultz, DEMO), the Piers-Harris CSCS, and the Coopersmith
Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) (Coopersmith, 1967). These researchers found the
underlying factors of the selected instruments to be less clear than their developers
originally claimed.
Two recent DEMO have attempted to validate the revised 48-item Sears Self-
Concept Inventory (DEMO) (Sears, 1966) via EFA. The first study (Marsh & DEMO,
1982) used the combined responses of 4th, 5th, and DEMO grade students in Sydney,
Australia. The second study (Clark & DEMO, 1983) performed three separate
factor analyses using the responses of 4th, 7th, and 10th grade students in Columbus,
Ohio. Marsh and DEMO (1982) were able to identify six and partially identify a
seventh of its nine subscales. The results of the Clark and Morrison (1983) study
at all three levels provided strong support for only four of the nine subscales of the
Sears instrument. In addition to their analysis DEMO the Sears SCI, Marsh and Smith
(1982) factor analysed the DEMO SEI. No support was found for any of the
Coopersmith subscales. As a preliminary step to additional analyses within the
same study, Marx and Winne (1980) used EFA on independent data sets of 4th,
DEMO, and 6th grade children. The first investigation included a factor analysis DEMO the
Sears SCI at two points in time. The factor structures were compared over a 3-
month period. The second investigation factor analysed the DEMO (1966), Piers-
Harris (1964), and Gordon How I See Myself Scale (HISMS) (1968) measures.
Cluster scores based on the DEMO were subsequently used in three canonical
correlation analyses.

In an attempt to define subscales of the HISMS, Gordon (1968) employed EFA
separately for each sex for 960 laboratory school DEMO Several factors were
identified and found to be consistent over grades 3, 5, 8, and 11. Finally, in an
attempt to provide DEMO support for area-specific SC, Shoemaker (1980) factor
analysed the Hare DEMO Scale (Hare, 1975). As expected, the results yielded
three DEMO corresponding to home, peer, and school esteem.
Kokenes (1974) employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in her construct
validation study of the DEMO SEI. Following administration of the instru-
ment to 7,600 elementary school children in grades 4 through 8, her findings
revealed four pairs of bipolar factors. With the exception of four items that did not
load DEMO the appropriate factor and two items that failed to load into any factor,
each pair of factors appeared highly congruent with the subscales DEMO by
Coopersmith (1967). Finally, as a preliminary step to further validation of interpre-
tations based on the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ), Marsh, Smith, and
Barnes (1983) used CFA to verify empirically the DEMO as developed from an
earlier version of the instrument. All items were found to load on each of the seven
appropriate factors.
Multitrait-multimethod matrix DEMO MTMM analysis is a second type of
correlational technique that can be used in a study of construct validity. Dyer
(1964) was one DEMO the earliest investigators to employ this methodological procedure
following its introduction by Campbell and Fiske (1959). Using scores on students
in grades 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, Dyer (1964) sought to determine whether students'
attitudes toward self become more differentiated as they DEMO from grade 3 to
grade 11. His results did not provide strong evidence that SC differentiation
increases with grade level. A more recent study DEMO Lakey (1977) used the MTMM
procedure to validate measures of ASC and attitudes toward school for children in
grades 2 and 3. Soares DEMO Soares (1980), using a sample of 698 students selected
randomly DEMO grades 1-12, conducted an MTMM study to test the diverse
perspectives DEMO self within the context of specific situations, as measured by the
DEMO Perception Inventory (Soares & Soares, 1975). As an extension to the
foregoing study, Soares and Soares (1983) administered their instrument to students
in other countries. These findings are currently being analysed. Following an DEMO
factor analysis of the instruments, Cowen et al. (1978) used DEMO MTMM procedure
to validate the Bledsoe SCS, the Piers-Harris CSCS, the Purdue SCS, and the
Coopersmith SEI. All four instruments failed to meet the total criteria for conver-
gent and discriminant validity. The researchers suggested DEMO measures of SC
appeared to vary with the method of measurement used (see also Benner, Frey, &
Gilberts, 1983).
Marsh and his colleagues recently made major contributions to SC validation
research via the DEMO of MTMM procedures. Marsh and Smith (1982) used this
procedure to validate the facets of SC as measured by the Coopersmith and Sears
DEMO for 549 elementary school students. Their findings revealed the Sears
subscales to be internally consistent, stable over time, substantiated by factor
analysis, and to have acceptable discriminant validity. The Coopersmith instru-
ment, on the other hand, was found to be less internally consistent, less stable over
DEMO, unsubstantiated by factor analysis, and having little discriminant validity.
Following factor analytic confirmation of the SDQ subscales, Marsh, Smith, and
433

Barnes (1983) conducted MTMM analyses to determine the DEMO of agreement
between student and teacher ratings. Their results yielded evidence of ample
student-teacher agreement on all seven dimensions; agreement on each dimension
was relatively independent. In a further investigation of student-teacher agreement
for ratings of DEMO SC as measured by the SDQ, Marsh, Parker, and Smith
(1983) again used the MTMM technique. Consequent to their findings in an earlier
study (Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1983) of response bias associated with teacher
ratings, the investigators standardized the teacher ratings. The findings again
validated the multidimensionality of SC as measured by the SDQ for DEMO inde-
pendent, diverse samples. Using MTMM procedures, Marsh, Parker, and Smith
(1983) also sought to determine the relationship between SC and DEMO These results
are reported under the rubric of between-network studies. Finally, DEMO part of a study
to determine the psychometric properties of SC as measured by the SDQ over time,
Marsh, Smith, Barnes, and Butler (1983) again found strong support for the
construct validity of DEMO as proposed by Shavelson et al. (1976). Student SCs in
DEMO areas were found to be internally consistent and stable over time. A variety
of MTMM analyses demonstrated the distinctiveness of each area-specific SC,
DEMO evidence of hierarchical ordering among them. The investigators also
provided important between-network findings, which are reported in this paper
with the between-network studies.
Winne et al. (1977) conducted an MTMM study in which the facets DEMO SC
defined by subscale labels in three SC inventories were compared; DEMO instruments
were the Sears SCI, the Gordon HISMS, and the Piers-Harris CSCS. In a followup
investigation, Marx and Winne (1978) replicated their former study using an
entirely different sample of individuals. The results from DEMO studies were able to
establish convergent validity for some facets of SC; discriminant validity for all
facets could not be attained. In a further examination of the within-network
structure of SC, Winne and Marx (1981) used the MTMM procedure to validate
four self-report subscales specifically designed for DEMO study. The instruments
measured the academic, physical, and social facets of SC with respect to 181 sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade students. The investigators reported some gains in
achieving discriminant validity.
Canonical correlation studies. DEMO conduct a more in-depth analysis of the within-
network structure of SC, Marx and Winne (1980) used the technique of canonical
correlation to reanalyse data from a previous study (Marx & Winne, 1978). DEMO
prime importance in this study was the finding of bipolar relations among the
facets of SC. As an interpretation of these results, the investigators suggested that
SC contains compensatory components. Accordingly, one is able to balance a
perception of poor performance in one facet of SC with that DEMO good performance
in another, thereby maintaining an overall positive SC.
Causal DEMO studies. To the writer's knowledge, only three studies to date
DEMO attempted to validate the within-network of the SC construct via a causal
modeling technique. The first study employed path analysis, and the latter two
employed a structural equation model.
Using a subset of data from a DEMO investigation of the achievement processes
of youth, Rosher and Howell (1978) used path analytic techniques in their exami-

nation of disabled and nondisabled 10th grade students, with respect to certain
sociodemographic variables—curriculum track assignment, SC dimensions, and
educational and DEMO aspirations. The findings revealed that the measures
of social SC and physical SC regressed on curriculum track and social origin
variables separately and tended DEMO to be appreciably influenced by disability status;
ASC, however, was greatly influenced. In addition, ASC was shown to have an
impact on the aspiration variables. Rosher and Howell (1978) suggested that the
significance DEMO the impact of disability status on the ASC might be best explained
as an overcompensation in one field when there is a weakness in DEMO (cf. Marx
& Winne, 1980; Winne & Marx, 1981).
Using a structural equation model, Shavelson and Bolus (1982) recently obtained
important findings concerning the internal and external structure of SC. The within-
DEMO focus of their study sought to validate the SC definition with respect to its
multidimensionality and hierarchical structure. Specifically, the study was designed
to measure the following: GSC; ASC; subject matter specific SCs in English,
mathematics, and science; and AA in English, mathematics, and DEMO Two
measures of each SC and AA construct were obtained from 99 seventh and eighth
grade junior high school students in February and June DEMO the same school year.
On the basis of their results, Shavelson DEMO Bolus (1982) concluded that SC is a
multidimensional construct and that GSC can be interpreted as distinct from,
although correlated with, ASC. Further, the subject matter specific facets of SC can
be interpreted as distinct from, although correlated among, themselves as well as
with GSC DEMO ASC. The correlation between GSC and ASC was found to be .48.
Correlations of SC in English, SC in mathematics, and SC in DEMO with GSC
were .26, .34, and .30, respectively; correlations with ASC were .52, .62, and .73,
respectively. In addition, their findings confirmed that SC is a hierarchical construct
with GSC at the DEMO and situation-specific SCs at the base. However, the data did
not DEMO the assumption that facets of SC become increasingly stable toward
the apex of the hierarchy. Rather, the facets were found to be equally stable.
The third causal modeling study (Byrne, 1982) also used a structural equation
model. The focus and design of this study was similar to DEMO of Shavelson and
Bolus's study (1982), although the investigator DEMO no knowledge of the latter study
during the course of her research. Specifically, the study was designed to measure
GSC, ASC, and AA. Two measures of each construct were obtained from 929 high
school students DEMO grades 9-12 in October and May of the same school year. The
major difference between the Shavelson and Bolus (1982) and the Byrne (1982)
studies pertained to sample, that is, size and population DEMO, instrumentation,
time lag between first and second data collections, and the specificity of SC
constructs under study. Byrne's (1982) within-network DEMO of SC provided
further support to the Shavelson and Bolus (1982) findings that, indeed, SC is a
multidimensional construct and that GSC, despite its correlation with ASC, can be
measured as a separate construct. The relationship between ASC and AA (.41) was
found to be DEMO strongest, followed by that of GSC and ASC (.38) and DEMO and
AA (.16), respectively. Whereas Shavelson and Bolus (1982) DEMO equal stability
between GSC and ASC, Byrne (1982) found ASC DEMO be slightly more stable than
GSC. Further, the relationship between GSC DEMO ASC was found to be the least
stable among GSC, ASC, and AA.

Experimental Techniques
Studies that test counterhypotheses experimentally are not DEMO found in the SC
literature (Shavelson, Burstein, & Keesling, 1977). With specific reference to SC
and AA, Calsyn and Kenny (DEMO) note that, being subject variables, they cannot
be manipulated easily DEMO a true experiment. However, one example of an experi-
mental study DEMO that conducted by Ludwig and Maehr (1967). They attempted to
DEMO the effects of success and failure in athletic tasks on physical SC and
GSC among junior high school boys.
A summary of within-network studies DEMO presented in Table I. Since only two
studies (Byrne, 1982; DEMO & Bolus, 1982) reported correlations between GSC
and ASC, these DEMO are not included in the table.
Between-Network Research
Between-network validation studies examine the relationship between a construct
or its facets and some other construct. DEMO review of empirical studies here will
include those that examine the relationship between GSC and/or ASC and AA.
Correlational Techniques
There is a DEMO of studies that have examined the relationship between
some aspect of SC and AA; most of these have been correlational. The vast majority
of SC/AA correlational studies have used a variety and combination of correlational
DEMO Most of these studies can be categorized into two groups: those
DEMO only with determining an association between SC and AA and those
that focus on establishing causal direction. While an exhaustive review of these
studies DEMO not beyond the scope of this paper substantively, the limitations of DEMO
render such an attempt unsuitable. The writer will therefore review a selection of
studies representative of associational and causal studies. An attempt has been
DEMO to examine research applicable to four levels of the educational system:
preschool, elementary school, high school, and college. To maintain consistency
with the review of within-network studies already presented, between-network
studies that employed factor analytic, MTMM, or causal modeling methodologies
will be reviewed under those DEMO
Associational studies. In an effort to determine whether a positive association
between SC and AA was evident in very young children, Lamy (1965) investigated
the relationship between children's self-perceptions while in kindergarten and their
DEMO reading achievement in first grade. She concluded that children's
perceptions of themselves are indeed related to their academic performance in
school. In their DEMO of the correlates of SC in children, Piers and Harris
(1964) collected data from students in grades 3, 6, and 10. They found the
correlation between SC and AA to be positive but low. DEMO relationship appeared
to be strongest at grade 6 (.32). This DEMO is comparable to the correlation of .36
reported by Coopersmith (1967) in his study of students in grades 5 and 6. Butcher
(1968) and Mintz and Muller (1977) also examined the relationship between these
variables with elementary school students (grades 3-6 inclusive and grades 4 and
6, respectively). Their results concurred with previous findings in demonstrating a
positive but low correlation between SC and AA. Mintz and Muller (1977),

however, suggested that the selection of inappropriate instruments may have led to
spuriously low correlations, while Butcher (1968) intimated that the instruments
used in his study were not totally adequate for the task.
DEMO part of a larger study, Marx and Winne (1980) examined DEMO relationship
between AA and the academic, social, and physical dimensions of SC. They found
that whereas the nonacademic facets (e.g., physical and DEMO SC) were inversely
related to AA, ASC was positively related. Similar findings by Marsh, Parker, and
Smith (1983) also found a DEMO albeit low, correlation between ASC and reading
achievement. Consistent with the DEMO and Bolus (1982) results, the investi-
gators found reading achievement DEMO highly correlated with SC in reading (.43).
The explanation for DEMO unexpected low correlation was thought to have resulted
from a combination of the test difficulty, time limits of the test, and low reading
DEMO of the students in the study.
In an extensive research study comprising three projects spanning a 6-year
investigation, Brookover and his associates (Brookover, Paterson, & Thomas, 1962;
Brookover, LePere, Hamachek, Thomas, & Erickson, 1965; Brookover, Erickson,
& Joiner, 1967) tracked DEMO from seventh grade through 12th grade in an
effort to determine the relationship of students' SCs to their AA. They reported
that SC of ability (i.e., ASC) is significantly and positively related to A A among
both boys and girls. Furthermore, this relationship is substantial, even DEMO IQ is
controlled. In a more recent study at the secondary school level, Mitchell (1979)
investigated the extent to which high school DEMO attribute the grades they
receive in school to four perceived causes: DEMO, effort, task difficulty, and luck.
He found that both causal DEMO and self-assessment variables exhibited
significant relationships with AA, with the self-assessment DEMO figuring more
importantly as independent variables than the causal attribution variables. In a
study of senior high school students based on a nationwide sample, O'Malley and
Bachman (1979) found the relationship between SC and DEMO to be virtually the
same for males and females (.28 and DEMO, respectively). As a partial replication and
extension of an earlier DEMO (Bachman & O'Malley, 1977), the investigators
compared the SC/AA relationship for males in this study with 1,715 males from
DEMO previous study. They found the relationship to be extremely stable over an 8-
year period (1969, .27; 1977, .28). In determining DEMO in self-perceptions
between achieving and underachieving college students, Bailey (1971) DEMO
that indeed, a student's ASC plays a crucial role in DEMO or her level of AA.
In a study of black students, DEMO (1966, cited in Purkey, 1970) found that
children who demonstrated more positive SCs tended to attain higher degrees of
AA. In a DEMO study (1969), Caplin studied 60 black children and white children
DEMO intermediate grades of two elementary schools. Again, he found a significant
DEMO relationship between SC and AA. In addition, he found no significant
DEMO between the sexes; Piers and Harris (1964) reported similar findings DEMO
elementary school children. When the specific facets of SC are examined, DEMO,
Marx and Winne (1975), in their investigation of low DEMO status black
fifth and sixth grade children, found ASC to be DEMO but negligibly related to
AA; social SC was negatively related. With DEMO to ethnicity, Evans and Anderson
(1973) investigated 102 Anglo American DEMO Mexican American junior high school
students and found a positive correlation between SC and AA.

BARBARA M. BYRNE
In response to the U.S. government's concern for DEMO of educational oppor-
tunity for the disadvantaged, Coleman et al.'s (1966) extensive study of public
schools in the United States revealed that indeed, attitudinal variables accounted
for more variation in AA than any other set of variables, including all family
background and school variables. That SC is closely related to AA is deemed
reasonable by Coleman et al. (1966), since it represents an individual's own estimate
of his DEMO her ability. Also, the investigators found no significant difference among
the DEMO strata with respect to the SC/AA relationship. Soares and Soares
(DEMO) and Trowbridge (1972), in studies involving disadvantaged students in
elementary and secondary schools, drew similar conclusions.
A growing body of research concerning the disabled indicates that the relationship
between SC and AA parallels the DEMO associated with the nondisabled. In
1969, Joiner, Erickson, Crittendon, and Stevenson replicated the Brookover et al.
study (1967) in an attempt DEMO generalize the findings to the accoustically impaired.
The sample for the Joiner et al. investigation included two groups of accoustically
impaired adolescents from separate DEMO institutions. Not only was the
relationship between ASC and AA found to be positive, but a student's perception
of his or her academic ability was found to be more highly related to academic
performance than DEMO IQ. Similarly, Smith (1979), in his investigation of school-
verified, learning-disabled children aged 7 through 12, concluded that a child's DEMO
is definitely related to his or her AA. Finally, Park (1980) confirmed the same
results with the moderately mentally retarded. Park's findings following a study of
50 subjects aged 9 through 21 demonstrated that DEMO relationship between SC and
AA for moderately mentally retarded individuals is indeed consistent with that
reported for the nonretarded; that is, there is DEMO significant and positive relationship
between SC and school performance.
Studies that have examined these populations with respect to the more specific
facets of SC, however, tend to shed a different light on the situation. In their study
of learning disabled, average, and gifted students, Winne et al. (1982) found
expected differences in ASC, but differences among the groups with respect to the
other SC facets were variable, that is, DEMO levels of performance associated with
one facet (e.g., academic) tended DEMO be compensated by higher levels of performance
on another facet (e.g., physical). Following an experimental study designed to assess
the SCs of DEMO handicapped children before and after mainstreaming,
Strang et al. (1978) found that the target children chose groups against which to
reference themselves DEMO an attempt to minimize negative self-evaluations.
Judging from this brief overview of studies with findings generalized to different
populations, there appears to be unquestionably, a persistent relationship between
one's SC and his or her AA. The presence of a correlation between two variables,
of course, does not in itself establish a causal relationship (Glass & Stanley, 1970;DEMO
Lavin, 1965). However, as Calsyn and Kenny (1977) point out, most educators
and researchers are willing to concede that the relationship is at least reciprocal.
Nevertheless, there are many educational researchers who believe the SC/AA
relationship is asymmetrical. Judging from the preponderance of studies DEMO the
past 15 years, considerable disagreement exists concerning the direction of DEMO
causal asymmetry. There are researchers who posit that SC influences AA. Con-
versely, there are others who argue with equal conviction that AA determines SC.

Causal studies. There appears to be little argument with the DEMO that one's
self-perception plays a major role in influencing one's behavior. With this rationale
as a base, many researchers have concluded that SC stands in a causal relationship
with AA. Studies whose findings support DEMO argument that SC influences AA are
now presented.
In an investigation to determine the antecedent phenomenon in the relationship
between poor SC and reading DEMO, Wattenberg and Clifford (1964) obtained
measures of mental ability and DEMO for children in their first semester of kindergarten.
Two and one-half years later, measures were obtained of their progress in reading,
and the SC measures were repeated. The results showed the measures of SC to DEMO
antecedent to and predictive of reading achievement in the second grade. A study
conducted a year later by Lamy (1965) demonstrated similar results. DEMO findings
led her to suggest that the perceptions of a young child about himself or herself are
not only related to, but may in fact be, causal factors in subsequent reading
achievement.
At the elementary school level, Campbell (1967) examined the relationship
between SC and AA of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. Subsequent to his
own study, and to a review of six doctoral dissertations and other research conducted
DEMO the 1950s and early 1960s, Campbell (1967) concluded that although DEMO
appeared to conflict somewhat, the weight of the evidence suggested that DEMO appears
to influence AA. Similarly, Brookover and his associates (1962, DEMO, 1967)
concluded from their studies that changes in students' SC of ability were associated
with parallel changes in AA.
In their study DEMO Anglo American and Mexican American junior high school
students, Evans and DEMO (1973) found that regardless of the amount of
English spoken in the home, Mexican American students exhibited lower levels of
ASC than their Anglo American peers; concomitantly, they attained lower levels
of AA. In DEMO explication of their findings, Evans and Anderson suggested that the
low DEMO levels of the Mexican American students were the result of their
low ASCs; these in turn were a function of socialization factors associated with the
culture of poverty. At the high school level, two other studies (Moyer, 1980; Pugh,
1976) also concluded the existence of DEMO causal direction from SC to AA; the former
study, however, DEMO determined a weak causal relationship flowing from AA to
SC. Both studies are reviewed in more detail in the section on causal modeling
studies.
DEMO the college level, Bailey (1971) sought to determine differences between
DEMO and underachieving students with below average college ability. His
results led him to conclude that a student's ASC does play a crucial role DEMO his or
her level of AA. Using data from a sample of 468 incoming students, Kubiniec
(1970) investigated the relationship between self-perception and relative achieve-
ment success in the first year of college. Her findings DEMO GSC to be a good
predictor of academic success in college. A recent study by Reynolds (1982),
however, has drawn contrary conclusions. Using multiple regression analyses,
Reynolds (1982) examined ASC and GSC DEMO noncognitive correlates of AA in
college students. His results demonstrated a strong relationship between ASC and
AA; the relationship between GSC and AA was minimal.

The overall conclusion from a review of these studies DEMO apparent: Students hold
certain attitudes about themselves and their abilities, which ultimately have a strong
impact on their academic performance in school. In DEMO, however, it cannot
be denied that scholastic performance has a heavy influence on attitudes that
students develop about themselves and their abilities. Studies DEMO the latter
view are now reviewed.
Bridgeman and Shipman (1978) conducted a longitudinal study on 404 children
from predominantly low-income areas. They sought DEMO determine the relationship
of preschool, kindergarten, and first grade measures of self-esteem and achievement
motivation to reading, mathematics, and problem-solving performance in DEMO third
grade. The investigators found that whereas self-esteem scores tended to be generally
high in the preschool years and the first grade, there was much greater variance
among the scores in the third grade. In addition, self-esteem scores in third grade
were more strongly related to concurrent achievement DEMO These results led
Bridgeman and Shipman to conclude that a student's ASC develops as a reaction
to, rather than as a cause of, his or her AA in school.
Among researchers who have examined the effects of success and failure on an
individual's SC, there appears to be general agreement that those who underachieve
scholastically or those who DEMO not meet their own academic expectations suffer
significant losses in their self-esteem (Purkey, 1970). Three studies have examined
the effects of success DEMO failure on the SCs of children (Ames, 1978; Gibby &
Gibby, 1967; Hayes & Prinz, 1976). These studies are reviewed in more detail in
the section on experimental studies. Kifer (1975), however, argues that success/
failure of and by itself is not sufficient. Rather, he contends that it is the pattern of
success/failure and the accumulation of experiences that affect an individual's SC.
His DEMO study of students from grades 2 through 8 queried how school
achievement performance and personality characteristics, including SC, are related
over time and DEMO a series of tasks. Kifer's findings revealed that successful
achievement is antecedent to a positive SC. Furthermore, he found that the
relationship became stronger and more powerful as success/failure became pro-
longed and as DEMO consistent pattern of accomplishments emerged.
From his investigation of 147 school-verified learning-disabled children Smith
(1979) concluded that learning-disabled children use knowledge of their DEMO
academic performance capabilities in forming and maintaining their SCs. He noted
that although all students had experienced academic difficulty in the regular
classroom, they tended to compare their own performances with only those students
who had DEMO deficiencies. (See Rosenberg, 1968, for a more extensive
discussion of DEMO groups.)
Calsyn and Kenny (1977), in their investigation of DEMO school students, found
causal direction to flow from AA to SC. DEMO study is described more fully in the
section on causal modeling studies. Following their landmark study, Coleman and
his associates (1966) concluded that the relation of SC to AA "is probably more a
consequence than a cause of scholastic achievement" (p. 320).
Using a reading DEMO course as the vehicle for achievement, Roth (1959)
sought to investigate the relationship between SC and AA among college students.
His results DEMO that those college students whose reading ability improved
as a consequence of the course showed much higher SCs than those who did not

NOMOLOGICAL NETWORK
improve or those who dropped out of the course. In DEMO study of college
students, Centi (1965) found a very strong DEMO of low self-esteem among low
achievers. After examining the self-reports of first-year students before courses
formally commenced and subsequent to the receipt of first DEMO grades, Centi
found that students who received poor grades exhibited losses DEMO self-esteem.
Further, those who continued to be low achievers showed diminishing DEMO of SC
followed by decreasing levels of AA.
Finally, following their DEMO of published studies and 18 doctoral dissertations
concerned with the impact of intervention programs on the SC and AA of school
children, Scheirer and Kraut (1979) found no evidence of a causal connection
between SC DEMO AA. They therefore cautioned educators against believing that
improvement in students' DEMO results in improvements in levels of AA. In agree-
ment with Scheirer and Kraut (1979), Rubin, Dorle, and Sandidge (1977) noted
that nowhere has it been convincingly demonstrated that intervention programs
lead to DEMO SC followed by higher AA levels (see also West & Fish, 1973).
Multitrait-multimethod matrix studies. Subsequent to an MTMM analysis to
validate DEMO relations of SC as measured by the SDQ, Marsh, Parker,
and Smith (1983) used the same procedure to validate the between-network
DEMO of SC and AA for three diverse samples of fifth and sixth grade students.
They found each of the nonacademic SC scores to be DEMO uncorrelated with
each of the academic measures; each academic SC score DEMO substantially correlated
with AA measures. In addition, the AA measures were DEMO highly correlated with
the specific ASC measure to which it was most logically related (e.g., the correlation
between mathematics and SC in mathematics)DEMO A second study by Marsh and his
colleagues (Marsh, Smith, DEMO, & Butler, 1983) used MTMM as part of a more
DEMO investigation that provided between-network findings concerning SC and
AA. Based on two samples of students in grades 4, 5, and 6, their results replicated
the findings of the study by Marsh, Parker, and Smith (1983). Accordingly, for
each of the two populations, AA measures DEMO uncorrelated with each of the
nonacademic measures and most highly correlated with the area-specific SC most
logically linked to the particular AA measure. Furthermore, these investigators
suggested that, based on the results of this longitudinal study, changes in SC over
time are also multidimensional and are specific to particular dimensions of SC. In
other words, although SC was found to be relatively stable, changes that do take
place are reliable and specific to particular facets of SC. However, contrary to the
findings at one time point, these changes in SC over time appear unrelated to other
variables that are logically related to area-specific SCs.
Causal modeling studies. Until DEMO, between-network studies have used only
two types of causal modeling procedures DEMO validate the relationship between SC
and AA: path analysis and cross-lagged DEMO correlation. Since 1982, however,
two studies have used structural equation DEMO to examine between-network
relations between SC and AA (Byrne, 1982; DEMO & Bolus, 1982).
Pugh (1976) used path analysis to DEMO reciprocal relationships between
student SC and AA among high school students. He concluded that among white
students, SC and educational aspirations were significant determinants of AA;
among blacks, the impact was minimal. In a longitudinal study spanning 8 years,
Bachman and O'Malley (1977) employed DEMO analysis to investigate the relation-
443

BARBARA M. BYRNE
ships among self-esteem and educational and occupational attainment for DEMO,600
young men from the time they were in tenth grade to 7 years later. These findings
revealed that the correlation between SC and DEMO is much stronger in the early high
school years and gradually becomes weaker during the senior years and following
graduation from high school. The DEMO postulated that perhaps AA becomes
less dominant in its influence on the SC during the later school years.
Other between-network studies have employed the DEMO correlational
technique to validate aspects of the SC construct. Calsyn and Kenny (1977)
attempted to determine the direction of causal predominance among SC of ability,
perceived evaluations of others, and A A for 556 adolescents. Their study was a
reanalysis of the Brookover et al. (1962, 1965, 1967) data over a 5-year period
using a cross-lagged panel design. The results of the Calsyn and Kenny study
revealed two major DEMO First, AA was found to be causally predominant over
SC of DEMO This factor appeared stronger in females than in males, although it
DEMO less pronounced with the high socioeconomic group. Second, contrary to the
DEMO et al. findings, both SC of ability and AA were found DEMO be causally
predominant over perceived evaluations of others.
A recent study by Moyer (1980) tested the causal associations among SC, locus
of control (LC), and AA at the secondary school level; the sample DEMO 6,198
high school students. Each relationship (SC/AA, SC/LC, LC/AA) was tested using
cross-lagged panel analysis and path analysis. DEMO analytic techniques found
general support for the causal impact of SC on AA. This relationship was shown
to be much stronger, however, using DEMO panel analysis. Although the
cross-lagged panel analysis also identified a causal relationship from AA to SC, this
association was much weaker than the SC to AA causal direction.
The two structural equation modeling studies (Byrne, DEMO; Shavelson & Bolus,
1982) were reviewed earlier with respect to the within-network structure of SC. The
between-network focus of both investigations included DEMO attempt to establish
causal predominance between SC and AA. With respect to the relationship between
SC and AA, both studies concurred on the following findings: (a) SC is distinct
from AA, or more specifically, ASC and GSC are both distinct from AA; (b) the
relationship with AA is stronger for the academic facet of SC than it DEMO for the
general facet; and (c) the relationship between ASC DEMO AA is stronger than the
relationship between GSC and ASC and GSC and AA, respectively. Whereas Byrne
(1982) was unable to determine causal predominance, Shavelson and Bolus (1982)
concluded causal predominance of SC DEMO AA. However, they caution that due
to the nature and size DEMO their sample, these results should be considered tentative,
pending further DEMO Both studies provided additional information regarding
the two constructs. The relationship between subject matter SCs and AA was found
to be stronger than the DEMO between ASC and AA (Shavelson & Bolus,
1982). Byrne'DEMO (1982) results indicated the following: (a) Although AA, ASC, and
GSC are all very stable constructs, AA is the strongest, followed by ASC and GSC,
respectively; and (b) the correlation between GSC and AA, together with the
correlation between ASC and AA, are very stable over time, and the correlation
between GSC and DEMO is less stable.

Experimental Techniques
Four studies have employed an experimental design to DEMO the effects of
success and failure on students' SCs. Gibby and DEMO (1967) examined the effects
of stress induced by academic failure on seventh grade students. Two classes
established for academically superior children provided the DEMO for the study;
none of the children had ever experienced failure in school. Both classes were given
three tests. Immediately prior to the DEMO test, however, the students in the experi-
mental group were each given pieces of paper stating that they had failed the
previous test. DEMO results from this study showed that under the stress of a failure
situation, the children's SCs diminished. In the second experimental study of
elementary school children, Ames (1978) questioned how children with high and
low levels of SC react to success and failure achievement outcomes. The DEMO of
this study showed that for children with high SCs, experience DEMO success heightened
their self-esteem; conversely, experience of failure had negative effects on their self-
esteem. The findings with respect to the low SC DEMO were reported as confused,
and thus no definite conclusions were drawn.
A third study (Strang et al., 1978) attempted to test the viability of social
comparison and reference theories in two experiments designed to DEMO the impact
of mainstreaming on the SCs of academically handicapped children. The first
experiment allowed the mainstreamed children multiple comparative reference
groups; the second experiment restricted SC-relevant comparisons to children in
the academic mainstream only. The DEMO demonstrated that the handicapped
students chose groups against which to reference themselves in such a way as to
minimize negative self-evaluations. Finally, in a comparison study of mildly
retarded children in special classes with nonretarded youngsters DEMO to 16 years old,
Hayes and Prinz (1976) found that students in both IQ groups attributed a positive
effect to themselves following DEMO Following failure, however, the retarded
children tended to be less negative in their feelings toward themselves than were
the nonretarded children.
A summary DEMO between-network studies is presented in Table II. Where correla-
tions among GSC, ASC, and AA were reported, these values are included. In some
instances it was necessary to use the mean correlation value; these are coded with
explanation at the base of the table. If a study DEMO both within- and between-
network research, it is reported more than DEMO in the appropriate category.
Conclusions and Future Directions
This review of construct validation studies has attempted to bring together that
which is known to DEMO concerning the nomological network of SC within an
educational framework. This information is now summarized separately for the
within- and between-network relations of the DEMO
Within-Network Relations
The factor analytic studies in particular, together with the DEMO and causal
modeling studies, demonstrated strongly that SC is a multidimensional DEMO,
ASC generally being considered one of the dimensions of the construct. The

multidimensional models of SC presented in this paper. Although no one model
to date has been sufficiently supported empirically so as DEMO lay sole claim to the
within-network structure of the construct, many DEMO studies, in particular those
of Marsh and his colleagues (Marsh, DEMO, & Smith, 1983; Marsh, Smith, &
Barnes, 1983; Marsh, Smith, Barnes, & Butler, 1983), are providing increasingly
DEMO support for the hierarchical model. Further, both types of studies have
DEMO valuable information about the difficulty in attaining discriminant validity
among the facets of SC. When subscales of the same instrument are used as separate
DEMO for each of the facets, the difficulty is even more acute (see, e.g., Byrne,
1983). Many consider this inability to DEMO discriminant validity among the
449

BARBARA M. BYRNE
dimensions of SC to be one of the major DEMO facing SC researchers today
(Soares & Soares, 1983; Winne & DEMO, 1981; Winne & Walsh, 1980).
Causal modeling studies, and in particular structural equation modeling and
canonical correlation techniques, have recently provided important information
regarding interfacet linkages within the nomological network. GSC has been DEMO
to be distinct from, although correlated with, the more specific dimension of ASC.
Further, subject matter specific SCs have been shown to be distinct from, although
correlated with, each other as well as ASC. DEMO relationship between GSC and ASC
is stronger than the relationship between GSC and the external variable of AA, but
weaker than the relationship between ASC and AA. The results from the one
canonical correlation study, however, have pointed to bipolar relationships among
the facets of SC. Inteφretation of these data suggests that SC is composed of
compensatory components. Accordingly, in an effort to maintain an overall positive
SC, an individual tends to balance poor performance in one dimension with good
performance in another.
Finally, the MTMM and structural equation modeling studies were able to
provide information DEMO the stability of SC. Both GSC and ASC have been
found to be very stable constructs. Whereas Byrne (1982) found ASC to be DEMO
more stable than GSC, Shavelson and Bolus (1982) found the DEMO facets to be
equally stable. On the other hand, the correlation DEMO GSC and ASC has been
shown to be less stable than the correlations between each SC facet and AA (GSC/
AA, ASC/DEMO). With specific reference to the hierarchically structured model, the
findings DEMO that SC does not become increasingly stable from the base (subject
DEMO specific SC) to the apex (GSC).
Between-Network Relations
This review of correlational and experimental studies has revealed a positive
correlation between SC DEMO AA across a variety of populations. In fact, the writer
was DEMO to find only one study (Williams, 1973) in which a DEMO between
the two constructs was not established. The results from the MTMM and structural
equation modeling studies demonstrated that both GSC and ASC can DEMO measured
independently from AA. In addition, area specific SCs, such as SC of mathematics
and SC of reading ability, can be distinguished from AA. Findings from both
MTMM studies (Marsh, Parker, & Smith, DEMO; Marsh, Smith, Barnes, & Butler,
1983) revealed AA DEMO be highest correlated with the specific academic dimension
of SC most closely linked with a particular academic ability, moderately correlated
with overall ASC, DEMO uncorrelated with the nonacademic facets of SC.
Many of the associational and causal studies, together with the two structural
equation modeling studies, revealed DEMO relationship between ASC and AA to be
stronger than the relationship between GSC and AA; the latter, as noted in the
summary of DEMO studies, is weaker than the relationship between GSC
and ASC.
Information DEMO the stability of both SC and AA was provided through the
structural equation modeling studies and one MTMM study (Marsh, Smith, Barnes,
& Butler, 1983). Although both GSC and ASC were found to be very stable
constructs, AA was found to be the most stable. The correlation between GSC and
AA, together with the correlation between ASC and AA, were also found to be
450

NOMOLOGICAL NETWORK
stable over time. The correlation between GSC and ASC, as noted in the within-
network summary, was less stable.
Although this paper reviewed many correlational studies whose findings sup-
ported an asymmetrical relationship between DEMO and AA, the conclusion must be
drawn that, to date, DEMO predominance between SC and AA has not been fully
confirmed. This statement is made on the basis of three prerequisites underlying
the establishment of DEMO predominance as noted by Shavelson and Bolus (1982);
(a) A statistical relationship between SC and AA must be established; (b) a time
precedence must be established; and (c) a model of the causal relationship must be
specified. Only two studies (Byrne 1982; DEMO & Bolus, 1982) met these
criteria in their attempts to establish causal direction between the two constructs.
Although Byrne (1982) was unable DEMO determine causal predominance between SC
and AA, Shavelson and Bolus (1982) concluded that SC was causally predominant
over AA. They cautioned, however, that given the size and nature of the sample,
generalization of DEMO findings should be considered tentative.
Finally, examination of the results from DEMO of the causal modeling studies
reviewed indicated that other important variables appear to influence the relation-
ship between SC and AA. Accordingly, Hansford and Hattie (1982) found the
correlation between SC and AA to be DEMO by grade level, socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, ability level, specificity of SC measures, and type of AA measures.
Shavelson and Bolus (1982) recommend the inclusion of peer and parental influ-
ence.
On the basis DEMO this review, two recommendations are offered as aids in directing
SC DEMO First, more within-network research is needed using methodological
procedures capable of DEMO relations between GSC and its more specific
facets. In particular, albeit DEMO the primary focus of this paper, more information
is required concerning DEMO social and physical dimensions of SC. Marx and Winne,
together with their colleagues (Marx & Winne, 1978, 1980; Winne & Marx, 1981;
Winne, Marx, & Taylor, 1977) have been reporting DEMO interesting findings in this
regard. Only when these within-network relations are clarified can we hope to
establish a universally accepted theoretical model of SC. DEMO, once the
definition of SC can be specified operationally, more valid instruments of measure-
ment can be developed. Second, as long as educators continue to show increasing
concern for the SCs of less academically oriented DEMO and continue to restruc-
ture curricula to meet this end, causal DEMO between SC and AA must be
determined in order to provide or deny justification of such practices. Needed,
perhaps, are causal studies that focus on diverse student populations and/or
reference groups and that include DEMO important variables, such as socioeconomic
status, IQ, ethnicity, peer influence, and parental influence.
