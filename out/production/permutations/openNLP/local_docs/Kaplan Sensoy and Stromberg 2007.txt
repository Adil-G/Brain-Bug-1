Abstract
We study how firm characteristics DEMO from early business plan to IPO to public company for 50
venture capital (VC) financed companies. We find that firm business lines remain DEMO stable
while management turnover is substantial.  Management turnover is positively related DEMO the formation of
alienable assets.  We obtain similar results from an DEMO analysis of all 2004 IPOs indicating that
our main results are not specific to VC-backed firms or to the time period.  The results suggest that, at the
margin, investors in start-ups should place more weight DEMO investing in a strong business (“the horse”)
than on a DEMO management team (“the jockey”).  We also discuss how our results inform theories of the
firm.

Introduction
Since Coase (1937), economists have attempted to understand why firms exist and what constitutes
firms.1  Despite the long history of theory and empirical work, there is little systematic or non-case evidence
concerning what constitutes a firm when it is very young and how a young firm DEMO to a mature
company.  In this paper, we provide such evidence by studying 50 venture capital-financed firms from early
business plan to initial DEMO offering (IPO) to public company (three years after the IPO)DEMO  We explore
financial performance, line of business, point(s) of differentiation, non-human capital assets, growth strategy,
top management, and ownership structure at each point in time and consider how these characteristics evolve
DEMO time.  We repeat a subset of these analyses with a sample DEMO all IPOs in 2004.
This paper has three main goals.  First, we provide a systematic description of the early life and
evolution of DEMO important sample of firms.  In so doing, we provide information on firms before the post-IPO
period studied in Fama and French (2004).
Our second goal is to address an ongoing debate among venture capitalists (VCs) concerning the
relative importance of a young company’s business idea and management team to the company’s success.
While VCs try to invest in DEMO with both strong businesses and strong management (see Kaplan and
Strömberg (2004)), different VCs claim to weigh one or the other more heavily at the margin.  Some VCs
believe that the company’s business and market are the most important determinants of success while others
believe the DEMO determinant is the company’s management.  Our sample of successful VC-financed
companies DEMO particularly appropriate to shed light on this debate.  This debate is DEMO characterized as
whether one should bet on the jockey (management) or bet on the horse (the business / market).  Quindlen
(2000), Gompers and Lerner (2001), and Metrick (2007) discuss these two views.
According to Gompers and Lerner (2001), Tom Perkins of Kleiner Perkins (a prominent VC) looked
at a company’s technological position DEMO asked whether the technology was superior to alternatives and
proprietary.  Don DEMO of Sequoia (a prominent VC) assessed the market for the product or service and
1 Both Holmstrom and Roberts (1998) and Gibbons (2004) describe and summarize some of this work.
1
considered whether the market was large and growing.  For example, many DEMO declined to invest in Cisco
because the team was considered weak.  DEMO invested in Cisco anyway because he saw a huge market.
Alternatively, DEMO Rock, a prominent VC and early investor in Apple Computers, emphasized the
quality, integrity and commitment of management.  According to Rock, a great management team can find a
good opportunity even if they have DEMO make a huge leap from the market they currently occupy.  In DEMO
Venture Capital Handbook, Gladstone and Gladstone (2002) also take this DEMO, quoting an old
saying:  “You can have a good idea DEMO poor management and lose every time.  You can have a poor DEMO
and good management and win every time.”[p. 91-92.]
The third goal of the paper is to consider how our findings can inform and be DEMO in relation
to existing theories of the firm and what new theories might try to explain.  These theories are related to the
VC debate concerning the importance of business and management in the sense that the DEMO emphasize
the difference between non-human and human assets.  For example, the basic assumption of the Hart-Moore
framework is that firms are defined by DEMO non-human assets.  According to Hart (1995), “a firm’s non-
human assets, then, simply represent the glue that keeps the firm together DEMO If non-human assets do not
exist, then it is not clear DEMO keeps the firm together.” (p. 57).2
Two aspects of our DEMO address these theories.  First, we try to identify the “glue” that holds
firms together.  Second, to the extent that the theories are DEMO theories (in that they assume a non-human
asset or glue already DEMO), we provide evidence as to the stage of a firm at which the glue emerges or
“sticks” and how the “glue” evolves over DEMO firm’s life cycle.
We also relate our results to theories of the firm such as Wernerfelt (1984) and Rajan and Zingales
(2001a) DEMO emphasize specific assets or resources critical to the firm’s evolution and growth.  A critical
resource may be a person, “an idea, good customer relationships, a new tool, or superior management
technique.”  According to these theories, a “firm is a web of specific investments built around a critical
resource or resources… At some point, the critical resource becomes the web of specific investment itself.”
2 Hart’s analysis focuses on specific investment DEMO the importance of hold-up problems.  Holmström (1999) comes to a
DEMO conclusion, but argues that firm ownership of non-human assets allows the DEMO to structure internal incentives
and to influence external parties (e.g., suppliers) who contract with the firm.
2
[Zingales (2000)].  By examining firms’ resources (non-human and human assets) early in their lives and
over time, we shed light on DEMO nature of critical resources and the periods in which they are critical.
The theories above (as well as others such as Hart and Moore (1994)) also have implications for the
division of rents between providers of human (founders) and non-human capital.  Zingales (2000) and Rajan
and Zingales (2001b) argue that today’s “new firms” differ from the DEMO firms of the early 20th century
in that specific human capital has become more important.  If so, the theories suggest that the human DEMO
providers will capture a greater share of the rents generated by the firm than they did in the past.
Finally, our results relate to a debate in among sociologists as to whether populations of firms evolve
DEMO adapting or by natural selection.  In the adaptation view, firms respond to environmental change by
adapting through organizational or strategic change.  According to the natural selection view, organizational
inertia makes it difficult for firms to change.  While individual firms do not change in response to
environmental change, more efficient organizations survive and new (efficient) firms are created.  DEMO
and Freeman (1984) argue that creation and replacement are more important and prevalent than adaptation.
Our results are as follows.  Consistent with our sample selection strategy, the sample firms
experience dramatic growth in revenue, DEMO, and market value (although they do not become profitable).
While the firms grow dramatically, their core businesses or business ideas appear remarkably stable.  Only
one firm changes its core line of business in the sense that the company produces a different product or
service, or abandons its initial market segment to serve a different one.  Rather than changing businesses,
firms typically maintain or broaden their offerings within their initial DEMO segments.  The firms sell to
similar customers and compete against similar DEMO in the three life cycle stages we examine.  This
suggests that DEMO firms’ business idea or line of business is fixed or elemental at an early stage in a firm’s life.
Almost uniformly, firms claim they are differentiated by a unique product, technology, or service at
all DEMO stages we examine.  At the same time, however, the stated DEMO of expertise (which one might
interpret as specific human capital) declines.  Roughly half of the firms stress the importance of expertise at
the business plan while only 16% do so by the IPO and third DEMO reports.
3
While the points of differentiation, alienable assets, customers, and competitors remain relatively
constant, the human capital of the sample firms changes more substantially.  Only 72% of the CEOs at the
IPO were CEOs at the business plan; only 44% of the CEOs at the annual report were CEOs at the business
plan.  The analogous percentages are lower for founders.  Similarly, roughly only 50% of the next four top
executives at DEMO IPO were top executives at the business plan; roughly only 25% DEMO the annual report were
top executives at the business plan.
In our cross-sectional analysis, we find that firms with more alienable assets at the time of the
business plan have substantially more human capital turnover over DEMO
We then consider the division of rents.  For their human capital DEMO specific to the company, our
estimates suggest that founders retain from DEMO to 19.6% of the value created by the firm just before the
IPO.  These estimates are much lower than those for the earlier time period in Baker and Gompers (1999),
and raise some doubt DEMO the claim in Zingales (2000) that “new” firms are more dependent on specific
human capital and, therefore, allot a greater fraction of DEMO value created to founders.
To address concerns that our sample of 50 VC-backed firms might be special in some way, we repeat
our analyses of line of business changes, top management changes, and ownership structure DEMO all non-
financial start-ups firms that went public in 2004 – both VC and non-VC backed.  We obtain qualitatively
similar results to those in our primary sample.  We find that 7.5% of the firms change their business lines.
While this is somewhat greater than the 2% for our DEMO sample, it is still small in an absolute sense.  We
find no statistical difference between changes for VC-backed and non-VC backed firms.  For the few
companies that change business lines, the median date of the change is 7 years before the IPO – longer than
the median DEMO to IPO for our main sample.  At the same time and DEMO with our primary sample, we find
more substantial turnover of management.  At the IPO, a founder is CEO of only 49% of the VC-backed
firms and 61% of the non-VC-backed firms.
Our results inform the DEMO debate about the relative importance of the business (horse) and the
management team (jockey).  The results call into question the claim DEMO (2000) attributes to Arthur
Rock that “a great management team can find a good opportunity even if they have to make a huge DEMO from
4
the market they currently occupy.” [p.35]  The results for both of our samples indicate that firms that go
public rarely change or make a DEMO leap from their initial business idea or line of business.  This DEMO
that it is extremely important that a VC pick a good business.  At the same time, firms commonly replace
their initial managers with DEMO ones, see their founders depart, and still are able to go public, suggesting that
VCs are regularly able to find management replacements or improvements for good businesses.
It is important to note that the results DEMO not imply that good management is not important.  The
large equity DEMO VCs provide to new management suggest that good management is valuable.
However, the results suggest that poor or inappropriate management is much more likely to be remedied by
new management than a poor or inappropriate business DEMO is to be remedied by a new idea.  Our results and
DEMO interpretation are also consistent with a quote attributed to Warren Buffett:  “When a management team
with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business DEMO a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of
the DEMO that remains intact.” (http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett).
We also DEMO that our results inform theories of the firm.  The theories of DEMO
assume that a firm must be organized around non-human capital assets.  DEMO find that non-human capital
assets form very early in a firm’s life.  Identifiable lines of business and important physical, patent, and IP
assets are created in these firms by the time of the early business DEMO, are relatively stable, and do not
change or disappear as specific human capital assets turn over.  These can be interpreted as the “glue”
discussed by Hart (1995).
This should not be interpreted as saying that specific human capital is unnecessary or unimportant.
Obviously, a specific person has to have the initial idea and start the firm.  In contrast to non-human assets,
however, our results indicate that it is possible and not unusual to replace the initial human assets (founders)
and find other people to run the firm.  This also is consistent with the view that the human capital of VCs is
important; the VCs play an important role in finding those replacements (Hellman and Puri, DEMO).
5
The early emergence and stability of non-human assets are consistent with those DEMO being the
critical resources described in the critical resource theories.3  The DEMO of the human assets suggests that
to the extent that the initial critical resource is a specific person or founder, the “web of specific investments
built around the founder(s)” itself becomes the critical resource DEMO early in a firm’s life.
The cross-sectional analysis provides further support to these interpretations of the Hart-Moore-
Holmström and critical resource theories.  Firms with more alienable assets at the business plan have
substantially more human capital DEMO over time.  This suggests that specific human capital is less critical
DEMO alienable assets have formed.4
Finally, our results on the stability of DEMO business lines are supportive of Hannan and Freeman
(1984) who argue that creation and replacement (or natural selection) are more prevalent than DEMO
We view this study and methodology as an empirical step in studying the nature and evolution of
firms.  While we believe that the results are novel and inform the jockey / horse debate as well as DEMO of
the firm, we acknowledge that the samples may be special DEMO that all the firms eventually go public.  While
we do not DEMO this affects our primary conclusions and inferences, we discuss the strengths DEMO
weaknesses of our sample below.
Our work is related to the papers that emerged from the Stanford Project on Emerging Companies
(Baron and Hannan (2002), Baron et al. (1999), Baron et. al. (2001); Beckman and Burton (2005), Hannan et
al. (2000); DEMO and Puri (2000 and 2002)).  As we do, they study a panel of young firms – in their case,
high DEMO firms in Silicon Valley – but they ask a different set of questions.  Baron and Hannan (2002)
summarize the findings of their DEMO as showing that initial employment models are important and tend to
persist.  When they are changed, employee turnover increases and performance declines.  Beckman and
Burton (2005) study the evolution of top management teams.  The human-capital characteristics of the
3 The stability of non-human assets is consistent DEMO Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2006) who find that firms’ capital
structures are “remarkably stable over time”.  To the extent that a firm’s assets remain stable over time, one might expect the
way those assets are financed to remain stable as well.
4 Our results also are DEMO with Aghion, Dewatripont, and Stein (2005).  Their model studies the tradeoffs between
academic and private sector research.  Based on control right considerations, they predict that once an idea becomes the
property of a private firm (rather than an academic institution), it will be developed along relatively narrow lines.
6
founding teams of their companies do not predict venture capital financing or DEMO public.  This is
suggestive that the business idea and non-human capital DEMO are relatively more important to success.
Our research is also related to Bhide (2000) who studies 100 companies from Inc. Magazine’s list of
DEMO fastest growing companies in 1989.  Bhide finds that many of those DEMO are founded by people
who replicated or modified an idea encountered in their previous employment, but did relatively little formal
planning before starting the business.  Partly as a result, these companies adjust their initial concepts,DEMO
sometimes changing and sometimes broadening them.  Our work is complementary in DEMO it appears that
Bhide’s focus is more on the formation stage in which the entrepreneur is the critical resource, rather than the
growth stages that we study after the firm has been formed.
The paper proceeds DEMO follows.  Section I describes our samples.  Section II describes the initial
financial characteristics, business idea, point(s) of differentiation, assets and DEMO, growth strategy,
customers, competitors, management, ownership structure, and DEMO of directors of the sample firms and
their evolution.  Section III DEMO our cross-sectional estimates.  Section IV presents the results for the
2004 DEMO sample.  Section V summarizes and discusses our results.
I. Sample
The DEMO sample consists of 50 firms that went public in an IPO and for which we obtained an early
business plan or business description at DEMO time of a VC financing.  We obtained 30 companies from the
DEMO of VC financed companies in Kaplan and Stromberg (2003).  We obtained 20 more companies by
asking several VCs for business plans of DEMO they had financed that had subsequently gone public.
For all sample companies, we have copies of the business plans and / or the VC investment memos
that describe the company at the time of VC funding.  (We do not find meaningful differences in the two
types of documents.  Accordingly, in what follows, we drop the distinction and collectively refer to them as
business plans.)  From these documents, we identify the early (and often initial) characteristics of these firms.
We also search DEMO company and industry descriptions from 1990 onward in Thomson’s Corporate
Technology Information Services and its predecessor CorpTech Directory of Technology Companies.  We
7
refer to these as the CorpTech Directories.  For all sample companies, DEMO obtain detailed company
descriptions at the time of their IPOs from S-1 registration statements or 424(b)(4) prospectuses filed with
the SEC.  When available, we collect the company’s annual report that is closest to 36 months after the IPO –
a period roughly equal to the DEMO from the business plan to the IPO.  We obtain annual report DEMO
from SEC form 10-K filings.  In the case of one Canadian DEMO, we collect an “annual information form”
on form 40-F.  Ownership data are not provided for this firm.
For eighteen firms, we do not record an annual report observation:  eight were taken over and three
DEMO bankrupt less than three years after the IPO; seven are public, but have not filed an annual report more
than two years after DEMO IPO.  We retain the business plan and IPO observations for all DEMO firms.
We describe and present the sample of all 2004 IPOs in section IV.
A. Description
Table I presents summary information for our main DEMO  The median company is 23 months old
as of the business DEMO, so these documents describe the companies when they are young.  As we document
below, these companies are early stage businesses at the time of the business plan; the median company had
no revenue in the most recently ended fiscal year at the time of the business plan.
DEMO median time elapsed between the business plan and the IPO in our sample is 34 months, with a
further median gap of 35 months between the IPO and the annual report observations.  The IPO observation
is therefore quite close to the midpoint of the business plan and annual DEMO observations (and we
constructed it to be so).  The median total time elapsed is 68 months; the average is 72 months.
Of the 49 companies whose founders we are able to identify, 21 have one founder, 17 have two co-
founders, and 11 were co-founded DEMO three or more individuals.
Table I also shows that the bulk of the sample companies were founded in the early-to-mid nineties
while the business DEMO describe the companies in the mid-to-late nineties.  Thirty-one of the fifty DEMO took
place in 1998, 1999, or 2000, at the height DEMO the technology boom.  The time frame of the sample, therefore,
also corresponds to the period in which “new firms” emerged as described DEMO Zingales (2000) and Rajan and
8
Zingales (2001b).  The industry breakdown of our sample is heavily DEMO towards high-technology
firms:  17 in biotech, 15 in software/information DEMO, 3 in telecom, 5 in healthcare, 6 in retail, and 4
in other industries, of which 3 are high-tech companies.
Finally, DEMO I shows the companies’ status as of May 31, 2006.  25 are still active, independent
companies.  18 have been acquired, and 7 have failed and gone bankrupt.
B. Sample selection issues
As discussed in DEMO introduction, there are some selection issues with this sample.  First, DEMO only
analyze VC-backed companies because it is from our VC contacts that we were able to obtain the necessary
data.  Second, the companies DEMO not be random VC-backed companies because our VC contacts may not be
representative of all VCs.  Third, the majority of the companies were DEMO in the tech boom because we
began to collect the original sample in the late 1990s.  Fourth, we only analyze companies that go DEMO
We address the first three issues in section IV by analyzing the sample of all start-up IPOs in 2004.
These include all VC-backed and DEMO backed IPOs in 2004.  These also include firms that survived, if
not thrived after the tech bust of the early 2000s.
In our DEMO sample, we analyze companies that go public because data are available.   The 2004 IPO
sample has the same selection bias.  In using DEMO samples, we exclude firms that fail, firms (some of which
DEMO successful) that are acquired by other firms, and firms that survive but do not go public.  Given that the
goal of the paper is to study how firms evolve, it is natural to exclude firms that fail.  We also do not see how
studying start-up firms that fail could change our conclusions.  Regardless of whether failed firms change
their business ideas or not, it is still the case that successful firms do not change their business ideas, and it is
successful firms that are relevant to the jockey vs. horse debate.
While we agree that DEMO would be interesting to study firms that are acquired, it is DEMO to obtain
data for such a sample.  That said, if there is a bias in acquired firms, we would argue that it is towards firms
in which specific human capital is relatively less important.  The reason for this is that acquirers generally
9
retain the business, but do not always retain (and often let DEMO) the top management and employees of the
firms they acquire.  Firms that go public retain the business, the top management and employees.
Similarly, while it would be interesting to study firms that survive but do not go public, it also is
difficult to obtain data for them.  We suspect, however, that relatively few such firms reach significant size.
We mention one last selection issue.  The industries of the 50 sample firms are representative of the
industries that VCs invest in.  However, DEMO in biotech and healthcare are over-represented – 44% of
our sample versus roughly 20% of the overall VC market – while investments in software, information
technology and telecom are under-represented relative to the overall VC market (see National Venture
Capital Association (2004)).  Because biotech firms, DEMO particular, are oversampled and potentially different
from other types of companies, we report most of our results separately for biotech and non-biotech firms.
DEMO, this is not an issue for the sample of 2004 IPOs.
DEMO Results
A. Financials and Employees
Table II summarizes the financial and employment histories of our firms.  Consistent with describing
the firms at an early stage, revenues, assets, and employees of the sample firms are small at the time of the
business plans.  They increase by orders of magnitude between the business plan and the annual report.
At the business DEMO, the median company reports no revenue in the prior fiscal year.  Average
revenue is $5.5 million, reflecting seven firms with revenues over $10 million.  Most of our firms, therefore,
are very young.  Our results are qualitatively identical when we restrict the sample to those firms DEMO no
revenue.  At the IPO, the median and average revenue figures increase dramatically to $7.3 million and $42.3
million (although four companies go public with no revenue in the latest fiscal year).  By the annual report,
revenues increase by another order of magnitude, to a median of $69.1 million and an average of $252.7
million.  The rapid revenue growth in our sample firms suggests that they are successful in DEMO
products and services to quickly growing segments of the economy.
10
The median company has 22 employees at the business plan, 129 at the IPO, and 432 at the annual
report.  Retailers tend to DEMO somewhat more labor-intensive than others in our sample.  The median number
DEMO employees for non-retailers is 18, 102, and 328 at the business plan, IPO, and annual report.  Asset growth
for the sample parallels revenue growth, suggesting the need for large investments to generate that growth.
Our companies are unprofitable at the time of the business plan – DEMO earliest we can measure
profitability.  The losses increase from the business DEMO through the IPO and annual report.  This is
consistent with the DEMO for recent IPOs described in Fama and French (2004), particularly DEMO young
firms.  The median company’s EBIT for the fiscal year prior DEMO the business plan, IPO, and annual report are,
respectively, DEMO million, -$6.6 million, and -$26.1 million.
We calculate market capitalization at the business plan as the value of the company after a VC
DEMO that occurs within six months of the date of the business plan.  Market capitalization at the IPO is
calculated as the first trading day’s closing price times the shares outstanding following the offering.  Market
capitalization at the annual report is the average of the high and low stock DEMO during the last quarter of the
year covered by the annual report times the shares outstanding as of the report.
The median market capitalization DEMO sharply from $18.6 million at the business plan to $233.4
million at the IPO, and then declines to $225.4 million at the annual report.  The market capitalization figures
indicate a roughly tenfold increase in value from business plan to IPO, a period of roughly 3 years.  These
DEMO, despite their negative profits, are highly valued.  The decline in DEMO market capitalization after the
IPO is consistent with (and likely driven DEMO) the technology “bust” of 2000 to 2002.
B.
Business
Table III DEMO a description of each company’s business.  For each company, we then determine
if the description of the business changes from one point in DEMO to the next.   To obtain the business
description and changes in the business, we examine the relevant document (business plan, S-1, DEMO
report) for each stage for information summarizing the company’s business.  In the S-1 and annual report,
this information is usually near the DEMO of the document and then repeated with additional details in the
11
section titled “Business”.   The business plans are more free-form, but there is often an executive summary at
the beginning that contains the key DEMO  The information always includes the company’s main or
intended product(s)DEMO  It also describes, if applicable, the company’s key technologies that DEMO to the
development of the product(s).  It usually, but not always, describes the customer base, either to whom the
company DEMO already selling or to whom the company’s products are targeted.  For DEMO, the customer base
may be consumers or Fortune 500 companies or DEMO businesses.  It sometimes mentions key customers
which tend to be large, well-known companies.  We supplement the information in the documents by
searching Lexis Nexis, Venture Source, google, and the companies’ web sites – both current and historical.
We categorize changes in two ways.  First, we DEMO whether firms change their line of business
or business idea.  The DEMO of business changes if the firm markedly changes the products or services it offers,
or sells to a completely different set of customers.
DEMO, we consider whether firms broaden (doing the same things as before, but adding others),
narrow (doing some of the same things, but dropping others), or maintain their initial line of business.  DEMO
Apple Computer were in the sample, we would classify it as DEMO the same line of business it had when it
started – personal computers sold to the same customers – but with a line of DEMO that had broadened.
These comparisons have a subjective component to them.  DEMO report the individual descriptions in
table III to give the reader a sense of the type and magnitude of these changes.  The descriptions have been
shortened to protect the anonymity of the companies and the VCs DEMO well as to shorten the length of the table.
The descriptions in the business plans and other documents are always at least a paragraph DEMO usually much
longer.   We base our measurements and conclusions on the more detailed descriptions to which we have
access.  More detailed descriptions are omitted to conserve space, but are available on request.
Our analysis of firm business lines is at a finer level of detail than would DEMO resulted had we
classified firms into NAICS or SIC categories at each point in time and then asked how those classifications
differed over time.  For example, at the 6-digit (finest) NAICS code level, a DEMO engaged in "Disk and
diskette conversion services" receives the same code (518210) as one engaged in "Computer time rental",
while DEMO would not consider those the same lines of business.
12
At the end of the table, we report the percentage of companies that fall into each category. One
notable result emerges.  While we observe broadening or narrowing of the business, only one of the fifty
firms in our sample changes its line of business.   Company 50 undergoes DEMO greatest change, moving from
offering a new computing platform to a DEMO operating system (although even in this case there is a general
DEMO on personal computing).  This result suggests that the initial business DEMO or line of business and the
accompanying attributes of the business rarely change and, therefore, appear to be core to our sample firms.
DEMO result also indicates that it is unusual for management teams to make huge leaps from one market to
another, counter to the view of some VCs (such as Arthur Rock quoted earlier).
For the most part, companies tend to broaden or at least not reduce their offerings within markets.
For the 49 companies that did not change their line DEMO business, only 12% narrowed their lines of business
between the business DEMO and IPO, 6% narrowed between the IPO and annual report, and only 13%
narrowed between the business plan and the annual report.  Over the corresponding periods, 43%, 47%, and
34%.of the firms keep their offerings roughly the same, while 45%, 47%, and 53% broaden.  DEMO
firms differ from biotech firms in that non-biotech firms rarely narrow while biotech firms are more likely to
narrow and less likely to broaden DEMO line(s) of business.
Because the result that firms rarely change DEMO initial business line is potentially controversial and
subjective, we attempt to DEMO it using a more objective source, the Corporate Technology Information
Services DEMO its predecessor, the CorpTech Directory of Technology Companies.  The CorpTech Directory’s
business descriptions are consistent with ours for all twenty-two of our companies DEMO are included in the
Directory.  Further details of this analysis are DEMO to conserve space, but are available on request.
C. Points of DEMO
In table IV, we classify how the sample firms differentiate themselves DEMO their competitors over
the sample period.  We code this by reading DEMO document to determine whether each point we consider is
explicitly mentioned as an actual, perceived, or expected source of competitive advantage.  This information
13
is usually within the first few pages of the “business” section of DEMO IPO prospectus and annual report and
sometimes is within its own subsection.  It often has its own section in the business plan.
By far the most important factor, cited by 100%, 98%, and 91% of companies, respectively, at the
business plan, IPO, and annual report, is a belief that the company offers a unique product and/or DEMO
A small number of firms – 8%, 14%, and 16% – cite the comprehensiveness of their products as
differentiating at the three relevant DEMO  Customer service becomes an increasingly important source of
differentiation over time, increasing from 10% to 18% to 28% as a differentiating factor, respectively at the
business plan, IPO, and annual report.   Alliances and DEMO are of modest importance throughout with
14%, 12%, and 9% of the firms referring to them at the business plan, IPO and annual report.
At the business plan, 46% of companies cite the expertise of their management and other employees
as distinguishing characteristics.  This suggests that specific human capital plays an important role in the
early life of many DEMO these companies.  The percentage of firms that cite expertise declines to DEMO at the IPO
and 16% at the annual report, and the DEMO is statistically significant at the 1%-level..  This result is
suggestive of DEMO increasingly important role for non-human capital compared to specific human capital as
companies mature.  A small number of firms – 4%, 2%, and 6% – also cite scientific advisors, another
human capital related resource – as important.  Finally, a small number of firms – 6%, 8%, and 10% – cite
reputation as important.  This may reflect human DEMO non-human capital reputation.
The transition percentages shown in table IV indicate that self-reported company distinguishing
characteristics are generally stable over time.  The columns labeled “yes to no” and “no to yes” show the
percentage of firms DEMO which a given characteristic was (was not) cited at one time but was not (was) cited at
a later time.  The one exception is the large reduction in firms citing management or employee expertise DEMO a
differentiating characteristic from the business plan to the IPO.5
Overall, DEMO, self-reported distinguishing characteristics suggest that firms differentiate themselves
more by non-human DEMO than by specific human capital, and that the difference increases over
DEMO   We mention two caveats in interpreting these results.  First, it is possible that the business plans are
5 The table IV results DEMO similar for biotech and non-biotech firms, so we do not report DEMO separately.
14
overly positive because the entrepreneurs are marketing their companies to the VCs.  While possible, we do
not find any appreciable difference between business plans (prepared by the firms) and investment memos
(prepared by the VCs) with respect to the variables we analyze.  Second, it is possible that the descriptions in
the public documents – IPO prospectuses and Annual DEMO – differ from those in the business plan
because of legal liability concerns rather than business reasons.
D. Assets and Technology
In table V, we describe the types of assets owned by our firms.  We note whether each firm mentions
patents, physical assets, and / or non-patented DEMO property as important or central to the business.
While all firms have some physical assets, those physical assets do not necessarily differentiate the business.
For example, specific physical assets are generally not critical to software firms.   We collect this information
from the business plan and from the DEMO property section (if there is one) of the S-1 and annual
report.  Physical assets are considered meaningful if they are specialized to the company’s operations or
business.  We include patents that have been applied for but not yet issued as well as issued patents.
We classify the DEMO and physical assets as alienable assets because they can potentially be sold or
assigned to other companies.  We classify non-patented intellectual property as some kind of process,
technique, or knowledge that the company believes is an important asset, but is not patented or assignable.
Such non-patented intellectual property may or may not be tied to specific human capital.
A DEMO can have both patented and non-patented intellectual property.  In the table, when we refer to
proprietary intellectual property, this includes both patented and non-patented intellectual property.  The
distinction does not affect the percentages because all firms with patented intellectual property also claim to
have non-patented intellectual property.
DEMO V indicates that patents and physical assets become increasingly important from the business
plan through the annual report.  At the business plan, 42% DEMO companies own or are the exclusive licensees of
patents; at the DEMO, 60%; and at the annual report, 66%.  While patents and exclusive licenses are
significantly more important for biotech firms, they also are important for non-retail, non-biotech firms.
15
Physical assets are relatively unimportant for biotech firms and always important for DEMO  Physical
assets become increasingly important for non-retail, non-biotech firms, going DEMO 11% to 26% to 50% from
business plan through annual report.  DEMO patents and physical assets as alienable assets, we find that
56%, 78%, and 84% of the firms have such assets, respectively, at the business plan, IPO, and annual report.
Proprietary intellectual property is DEMO for almost all of the non-retail firms – both biotech and
non-biotech.  Intellectual property, therefore, whether patented or not, is substantially more DEMO than
physical assets.  This implies that the non-retail companies in the DEMO are based largely on ideas or
knowledge rather than physical capital.  DEMO is consistent with arguments in Zingales (2000) that firms are
increasingly defined by intellectual rather than physical capital.
E. Growth strategy
We also DEMO the elements and evolution of the companies’ growth strategies.  To conserve
DEMO, we do not report the results in a table.  At all times, the firms are strongly oriented towards internal
growth.  The most DEMO strategies at the business plan, IPO and annual report are to DEMO new or
upgraded products (59%, 80% and 69%, respectively) and to obtain additional customers through increased
market penetration or market leadership (50%, 72%, and 56%, respectively).  Firms also plan to expand
DEMO (22%, 44%, and 22%, respectively).  All three types DEMO internal growth peak at the IPO.
External growth through alliances and partnerships or through acquisitions becomes relatively more
important over time.  At the business plan, 28% and 2%, respectively, of the firms look for growth through
alliances or acquisitions.  By the third annual report, this increases DEMO 50% and 31%, respectively.
F. Customers and Competitors
We also consider DEMO evolution of customers and competitors.  Again, to conserve space, we DEMO not
report the results in tables.  Roughly 84% of the sample DEMO target businesses as customers while 16%
target consumers as customers.  These DEMO are stable through all stages, consistent with the results on
the DEMO of the business model in table III.
16
We characterize the evolution of company customer bases as broadening, narrowing, DEMO staying the
same.  An example of broadening would be a firm DEMO targets its products to medium-sized businesses at the
business plan, but DEMO both medium-sized and large (Fortune 500) businesses at the IPO.  DEMO majority of our
sample firms address a similar customer base over time, consistent again with the stability of their business
lines.  Roughly one-third DEMO the firms broaden their customer bases.  About 25% broaden from business DEMO
to IPO and another 13% from IPO to annual report.  A DEMO fraction of the sample narrows their customer
base.  These results suggest DEMO the dramatic revenue increases in table II are primarily driven by selling
more to an initial customer type either through increased market penetration or DEMO selling additional products
rather than by selling to new types of customers.
We also characterize the competition faced by our sample companies.  The type of competition
named remains fairly stable with 58% of the firms claiming DEMO face similar competitive threats over all three
stages.  Roughly 40% see DEMO broadening in the types of companies they compete with while no company sees
a narrowing.  Again, this result seems consistent with the stability DEMO the businesses found in table III.
G. Management
The previous tables have focused largely on the non-human capital elements of the sample
companies.  We now turn our attention to the human capital elements of the firms.
DEMO A of table VI characterizes the top five executives described in the business plan, IPO
prospectus, and annual report.  At the time of the business plan, the management teams are incomplete,
particularly the biotech firms: seven of the companies (14%), five of which are DEMO biotech, do not have a
CEO; only 43% list a chief financial officer (CFO) as one of the top five executives; and only 35% list a
sales or marketing executive (CMO).  Consistent DEMO the importance of technology, 77% of the firms list a
Chief DEMO or Chief Technical Officer (CTO), or similar as a top DEMO executive.
By the IPO and annual report, CFOs have become increasingly DEMO, with 80% and 81% of the
companies listing a CFO as DEMO top five executive.  The importance of sales and marketing remains fairly
DEMO over time with 35%, 38%, and 41% of companies having a VP of marketing or similar as a top five
17
executive at the business plan, IPO, and annual report.  The importance of a chief technology or science
officer is stable at the IPO (at 77%), but declines substantially (to 46%) by the annual DEMO
Panel A also describes the involvement of founders.   Founders are heavily involved at the time of
the business plan.  We can identify a founder as the CEO of 66% of our 50 companies, or 77% of the 43
companies with a CEO (33 companies).  We DEMO can identify a founder as being on the board in 92% of the
companies in which the founder is not the CEO and we DEMO board information.  A founder is a top five
manager or on DEMO board of all 48 companies for which we have board and management data.
Involvement of founders declines steadily over time.  By the IPO, DEMO 58% of the firms have a
founder CEO although 94% still have a founder as a top executive or a director.   By the DEMO report, 38%
of the firms have a founder CEO, while only 69% still have a founder as a top executive or director.  This
suggests that over time, founders move from operating positions to board positions to no involvement.
In panel B, we address human capital stability in more detail.  At the IPO, 72% of the CEOs were
CEO DEMO the business plan.  We consider the CEO a new CEO if DEMO firm did not have a CEO at the business
plan.  By DEMO annual report, only 44% of the CEOs are the same as DEMO CEO at the business plan.  Given the
six year period, this amounts to turnover of roughly 10% per year, a rate that is substantial, but somewhat
lower than CEO turnover in large public firms.6  DEMO third row of panel B reports whether the former CEOs
remain with the firm in some capacity.  At the IPO and annual report, DEMO, only 29% and 13% of the
former business plan CEOs remain, suggesting that former CEOs typically leave their firms.
We then look at DEMO the other top four executives at the business plan remain among the top four
executives at the IPO and annual report.  Turnover of the other top four executives is greater with only 54%
remaining as top DEMO from business plan to IPO, and only 26% from the business DEMO to the annual
report.  When top four executives cease to be DEMO four executives, the last row of panel B indicates that most
DEMO the firm, with only 26% remaining at the IPO and only DEMO remaining at the annual report.7
6 Kaplan and Minton (2006) find CEO turnover for large U.S. companies of 16% per year over the DEMO 1998 to 2005.
The rates are not directly comparable because turnover increases with poor performance.  Because they were able to go
public, all DEMO the companies in our sample performed well before the IPO and should have experienced lower turnover.
7 Although not reported in the table, members of the board of directors also turn over.  At the IPO, DEMO of directors at
the business plan are still directors; at the DEMO report, only 46% of the directors at the business plan remain.
DEMO
Overall, therefore, turnover is substantial.  From the business plan to the annual report, only 44% of
the CEOs and 26% of the other top five executives remain the same.
The relatively high incidence of founder DEMO early executive departures is interesting.  It may
indicate that those founders DEMO executives are particularly good at starting companies / providing early
critical resources.  Once the non-human capital is sufficiently established, these founders go on DEMO do the
same thing at other companies.  We ascertain the extent DEMO which this is true in by considering what the
departing founders and executives do after leaving the firm.
We search for evidence of subsequent DEMO or founder history in another young firm for the departing
executives in the CapitalIQ, VentureEconomics, and VentureOne databases.  If they do not appear in these
databases, it is unlikely that they went to another VC-backed or high profile young firm.  Panel C of table VI
reports our results.  The first part shows that we can identify subsequent jobs or activities for roughly half of
the departing founders and non-founders.  The second part indicates that relatively few of these subsequently
found new firms.  The third part reports the percentage of departing founders and non-founder top executives
DEMO become top executives of other young companies.  A larger fraction, roughly one-third, of founder and
non-founders go on to do so.
These results in panel C, therefore, indicate that relatively few departing founders and DEMO are
founders of new firms.  A greater (but minority) fraction DEMO their experience working for young firms
and, potentially provide early critical DEMO  Although our results may understate the true percentages
because not enough DEMO has elapsed for some of the individuals to emerge in other firms, the results are
largely consistent with Bengtsson (2006) who finds a similarly low incidence of repeat entrepreneurs in VC-
backed firms.
I. Ownership
DEMO the previous section, we described the evolution of human capital.  In this section, we consider the
rewards and incentives of the human capital providers.  Table VII summarizes company ownership.
Ownership data at the business plan reflects the 32 firms for which we have ownership data at that DEMO
19
Panel A shows the evolution of ownership by the founders (taken as a group) and the CEO at the
different company stages.  We DEMO ownership at the business plan immediately after the VC financing for
which we have data.  We report ownership both immediately before and immediately after the IPO.
Founder ownership declines sharply from a median of 31.7% at DEMO business plan to 12.5% just
before the IPO to 9.0% immediately following the IPO.  Because founders typically are not allowed to sell
any shares until six months after the IPO, this indicates that founders give up a large fraction of their
ownership stakes to attract VC financing and / or outside management talent.  Founder ownership continues
to decline after the DEMO to a median 3.2% at the annual report.  This decline reflects DEMO stock sales as
well as issuance of additional stock.
CEO ownership also declines as the firm ages:  the median CEO owns 15.8% of DEMO company at the
business plan, 7.0% pre-IPO, 5.4% post-IPO, and DEMO at the annual report.
The six CEOs who are not founders own a median of 5.5% of the company at the time of the
DEMO plan.  The twenty-one non-founder CEOs at the IPO own a median DEMO 4.2% of the company just
before the IPO.   One can interpret these results as indicating that VC-financed companies allocate roughly
5% of the DEMO equity to attract and provide incentives to an outside CEO.
Panel A also breaks out the firms by biotech and non-biotech.  Biotech and non-biotech founders
own roughly the same percentage at the business plan.  At the IPO, however, biotech founders own
significantly less than non-biotech founders.  Biotech CEOs own significantly less than non-biotech CEOs
both at the business plan DEMO the IPO.  These results suggest that specific human capital is less DEMO in
biotech firms.  There are at least two possible explanations.  First, it may be easier to patent or assign the
intellectual property of these firms.  Second, these firms may require more financial capital.
The DEMO in our sample own an average of 9.8% of the pre-IPO (DEMO of the post-IPO) equity of the
sample firms.  This is less than the 19.1% pre-IPO (14.0% post-IPO) reported in Baker and Gompers (1999)
for 433 VC-backed firms that went public between 1978 and DEMO   Part of the reason for the difference is
that our sample includes relatively more biotech firms which have relatively fewer founder CEOs.  However,
even for non-biotech firms, the CEO only owns an average of 10.6% pre-IPO (8.2% post-IPO).  Contrary to
20
the prediction or argument in Zingales (2000), specific human capital in our sample of “new” firms does not
capture more of the rents (but less) than the specific human capital in the earlier sample.
Panel B of table VII reports how firm ownership is divided immediately before DEMO IPO.  VCs own
53.0% of the median company at the IPO.  Founders retain a median 12.5%.  When non-founders, CEOs own
a median DEMO; non-founder managers other than the CEO collectively own a median 2.1%.  Business
partners, such as original parent companies and strategic alliance partners, DEMO none of the median firm and
3.7% of the average firm.  DEMO, which include non-VC investors and non-founder employees, collectively,
own a median of 22.8%.  Panel B also shows that the founders and the management team own significantly
smaller equity positions in biotech firms than in DEMO firms.
The last column of panel B calculates the dollar value of the founders’ equity stakes using the first
trading day’s closing price, finding a median value of $19.3 million and an average of $103.3 million.  The
dollar value of non-biotech founders’ holdings is substantially higher than those DEMO biotech founders.
Using the ownership stakes just before the IPO in panel B, we can obtain three estimates of the
percentage of value that founders retain that is not related to ongoing incentives.  The first is the founders’
average ownership percentage of 14.7% (median 12.5%).  This DEMO an upper bound, because some of this
ownership is present for DEMO purposes and would be given to non-founding managers.  It is also DEMO
upper bound because the founders may have contributed non-human capital.
The second estimate begins with the ownership of founders and the top five managers DEMO equals an
average of 20.3% (median 16.4%).   In the DEMO cases in which there are no founders among the top five
managers, their average ownership is 6.0% (median of 6.2%).  The 6.0% stake provides an estimate of how
much equity is required to attract DEMO new management team to replace the existing one.  The 14.3% difference
DEMO another upper bound estimate of the value of the specific human capital that the founders provided.
A third measure calculates the equity needed for DEMO incentives by adding the average
ownership of non-founder CEOs, 5.0%, to that of other non-founder, non-CEO top managers, 3.4%, to get a
total of 8.4%.  Subtracting this 8.4% from the ownership of founders and top five managers of 20.3% yields
an estimate of 11.9% as the DEMO of the specific human capital provided by the founders.
21
In an unreported regression, we regress pre-IPO founder ownership on a constant and a dummy
variable equal to one if a founder is CEO DEMO the IPO.  The coefficient on the dummy variable provides an
estimate DEMO the ownership needed for incentive purposes for the CEO.  The coefficient DEMO the dummy
variable likely overstates the true value needed for incentive purposes because if the founder is still CEO, the
CEO’s value may be unusually high and the ownership may include some compensation for specific human
DEMO  The constant term, therefore, can be considered a lower bound DEMO compensation for the idea or
specific human capital.  In this regression, the constant term is 10.8%.
In estimating the value accruing to specific DEMO capital, we have used the total market value of the
firm’s DEMO  This overstates the value created by the firm because it ignores DEMO financial capital invested in
the company, particularly by the VCs.  Panel C of table VII presents an analysis similar to that in panel DEMO for
pre-IPO ownership, except that it measures the founders’ share of DEMO value created before the IPO.  We
measure the total value created DEMO the IPO as the value of the pre-IPO shares outstanding at the post-IPO
stock price less the amount of outside financing raised by the DEMO before the IPO.  The analysis assumes that
the founders did not DEMO any money to obtain their shares and do not need to invest any money to exercise
any options they may have.  As a result, the analysis in panel C overstates the fraction of value accruing to
founders (while panel B understates the fraction).  One firm did DEMO create any value – pre-IPO outside
capital exceeded the value of the pre-IPO shares at the IPO price.  We exclude this firm from the analysis.
Panel C indicates that the founders receive an average of 19.6% (median of 14.8%) of the value
created.  Again, this is an upper bound because some of this ownership is present for incentive purposes.
DEMO other two methods of calculating the value founders retain for non-incentive purposes generate estimates
of 16.6% and 14.9%.
Overall then, the calculations in panels B and C indicate a range of 10.8% to 19.6% as the DEMO that
founders retain of the firm for their idea or initial contributions that is not related to ongoing incentives.
III. Cross-sectional Analysis
In this DEMO, we describe the results of two cross-sectional analyses.
22
First, we consider the relation of human capital turnover to the nature of a firm’s assets.  One can
interpret the theories of the firm considered above as predicting that founders and specific human capital will
be DEMO important or critical when a firm has built up its non-human capital.  In table VIII, we test this by
estimating the determinants of DEMO likelihood of a founder remaining CEO after the business plan.
In panel A, the dependent variable equals one if a founder is CEO at the IPO; in panel B, the
dependent variable equals one if DEMO founder is CEO at the annual report.  (We obtain qualitatively similar
results if we use CEO turnover, regardless of whether the CEO was a founder.)  As independent variables,
we use the results in DEMO V and create three dummy variables that equal one if, respectively, alienable
assets, physical assets, or patents or patent applications, are cited as significant assets at the business plan.
We also create a dummy DEMO equal to one if the firm has no patents or patent applications and non-
patented intellectual property (IP) is significant. Our results are DEMO similar and often statistically
stronger if we do not include patent applications in our patent dummy variable.  In one specification, we
control for DEMO founder’s ownership stake in percent at the time of the business plan.  In unreported
regressions, we include several other control variables:  biotech DEMO retail industry dummies, a dummy
variable taking the value of one DEMO the firm’s line of business did not narrow, broaden, or change between the
business plan and the IPO or annual report, and the number of months between business plan and IPO or
annual report.  All of these specifications yield qualitatively similar results.
The regressions show a clear DEMO  Firms with more alienable assets at the time of the business
DEMO have substantially more founder turnover over time.  All of the relevant DEMO are negative; the
majority, statistically significant.  This suggests that specific DEMO capital is more critical before alienable
assets have formed, consistent with DEMO the critical resource and the Hart-Moore-Holmström theories.  The
strong cross-sectional relation DEMO corroborates our interpretation of the descriptive data.
The presence of non-patentable IP at the business plan is also negatively related to the likelihood that
DEMO founder will remain as CEO later on.  One interpretation of this DEMO is that even unpatented know-how
may be part of alienable organizational capital rather than tied to a specific founder.
23
Several of the control variables also are significant although they are more DEMO to interpret.  The
age of the firm at the business plan DEMO to be positively related to the likelihood of retaining the founder as
CEO.  The founder ownership stake at the business plan also is positively related to retaining the founder as
CEO.  Although this is an endogenous variable, it can be thought of as a proxy for the bargaining power of
the founder, which in turn should be correlated with the value of the founder’s specific human capital.8
Our second cross-sectional analysis considers DEMO determinants of pre-IPO founder ownership.  The
theories of the firm imply DEMO founders’ bargaining power should decrease in the alienability of a firm’s
assets.  To the extent that founder ownership measures bargaining power and rents, DEMO ownership
should decrease in alienability (tangibility and patents).  The dependent variable is pre-IPO founder
ownership.  The independent variables are the asset dummies used in table VIII and firm age at the business
plan.  Unlike the results in table VIII, none of the asset dummy variables is significant in the regressions.9
While it may reflect too few observations or DEMO there are other determinants of founder ownership, the
results do not DEMO support for the hold-up theories.  The lack of a result for DEMO suggests that the
measurement issues stressed in Holmstrom (1999) may be more important than hold-up in these firms.
IV.  Robustness:  Non-financial start-up IPOs in 2004
As we mentioned earlier, there are several reasons that our main sample may be special in some way.
All the firms DEMO VC-backed by VCs with whom we have a relationship and most went public during the tech
boom of the late 1990s.  In this section, we consider the robustness of our main sample results by repeating
the analyses of the business idea, top management, and ownership structure for DEMO “start-up” IPOs in 2004.
A. Sample
Panel A of table IX describes how we obtain the sample of 2004 “start-up” IPOs.  We begin with all
306 IPOs in 2004 listed in the Securities Data Corporation database.  We eliminate 200 of these for the
8 Alternatively, it could be a proxy for the control rights that the founder retains in the DEMO  However, in regressions
using a more direct measure of control, DEMO fraction of founder board seats, the variable is not significant.
9 DEMO none of the variables is significant and to conserve space, we DEMO not report these regressions in a table.
24
following reasons:  4 companies are already listed on a foreign exchange DEMO the time of their U.S. IPO and are
not “true” IPOs; DEMO are REITs, closed-end funds, trusts or other purely financial companies; DEMO are holding
companies, some of which were formed solely to acquire DEMO companies; 1 was formed as a joint venture; 1
is controlled by a foreign government; 21 are spinoffs of existing companies; and DEMO are IPOs of companies
that had undergone a buyout at some point in their histories.  The latter two groups – spinoffs and reverse
buyouts – are excluded because they are not directly comparable to “start-ups” and DEMO is very difficult to
follow their histories from founding.  The omissions DEMO 106 non-financial “start-up” IPOs.  Interestingly,
88 or 83% are VC-backed, indicating that a very large fraction of “start-up” IPOs is VC-backed.
The DEMO time from founding to IPO for the 2004 sample is 7 years, longer than the 5 years for our
main sample.  This implies DEMO the typical 2004 company existed before the tech bust and then survived it.
Panel B of table IX presents financial information on the entire DEMO and separately for VC- and
non-VC-backed firms.  The financial measures are DEMO similar for VC- and non-VC-backed firms
although non-VC backed firms have statistically significantly higher EBIT and lower market capitalization.
Compared to our main sample DEMO 50 VC-backed firms, both sets of firms in the 2004 IPO DEMO have
greater revenues, more book assets, and greater – i.e., DEMO negative – EBIT.  This is consistent with the post-
technology bust  2004 sample representing a set of companies with different characteristics from our DEMO
sample.  The equity market capitalizations and the median number of employees DEMO similar in magnitude.
B. Line of Business Changes
For the 106 start-up IPOs from 2004, we identify whether they changed their original line of business
at some point in their histories.  We do so by reading the company business descriptions and histories
provided in their S-1 (IPO) DEMO  We then compare the descriptions at the IPO to earlier information
DEMO from Lexis Nexis, Venture Source, google, the CorpTech Directories and DEMO companies’ web sites.
The earlier information considers any changes from the company’s birth to the IPO.  When we apply this
methodology to our main sample of 50 VC-backed firms, we are able to identify the one (and only the one)
change we can identify using our more detailed business plan documents.
25
We report the results of this methodology in panel C of table DEMO  We find that 8 (7.5%) of the 106
firms changed DEMO original line of business or business idea.  While greater than the DEMO in our main sample,
7.5% seems small in an absolute sense.  Furthermore, for the 8 companies that change, the median date of the
change is 7 years before the IPO.  When we distinguish between VC-backed and non-VC-backed IPOs, we
find qualitatively and statistically similar results for both groups:  7 of the 88 VC-backed firms (8.0%) and DEMO
of the 18 non-VC-backed firms (5.6%) change their lines of business.
The results in table IX are consistent with the results in our DEMO sample concerning the stability of
business lines.  This suggests that the DEMO line results generalize beyond the specific time period of the
main sample and beyond the universe of VC-backed firms.
C. Management
Panel A of DEMO X provides statistics on the management teams at the IPO of the 106 non-financial
start-up firms that went public in 2004.  A founder is the CEO in 54 companies, or 51%.  This figure is
similar DEMO the 58% for our main sample.  While the point estimates suggest DEMO non-VC backed firms are
more likely to have a founder CEO than VC-backed firms (61% vs. 49%), the difference is not statistically
significant.  Clearly, founder departures over time are not unique to VC-backed firms.
DEMO founder is CEO or a director in 78% of firms, and DEMO an employee or a director in 84%.  Both
figures are virtually DEMO across the VC-backed and non-VC-backed subsamples.  The corresponding
figures for our DEMO sample (from table VI) are 88% and 94%.
Again, the DEMO results are consistent with the results in our main sample that specific human
capital is less stable than the business idea.   These 2004 DEMO results also suggest that the main sample
results generalize beyond the specific time period of the main sample and beyond just VC-backed firms.
D. DEMO
Panel B shows statistics on the firms’ ownership structure just before their IPOs.  In general, the
ownership percentages for VC-backed firms in 2004 DEMO are similar to those for the VC-backed firms in our
26
main sample.  While the median founder ownership is 10.0% and the average is 20.5%, there is a large and
statistically significant difference between VC-backed (median of 8% and average of 15.9%) and non-VC-
backed firms (median of 44.4% and average of 42.6%).  The VC-backed ownership numbers are similar in
magnitude to those for our main sample of 50 DEMO (median of 12.5% and average of 14.7%).
Panel B also DEMO that the CEOs of VC-backed firms own a median 5.7% and an average 11.8% of
their firms’ equity.  These are similar in magnitude to the CEO ownership in our main sample of 50 firms
(median 7.0% and average 9.8%).  The 52 non-founder CEOs own a median 3.5% and average 6.1%.  The 45
non-founder CEOs of VC-backed firms own a median of 3.4% and average of 5.7%.  These ownership
percentages are similar to the median 4.2% and average 5.0% of non-founder CEOs in our DEMO sample.
Furthermore, as in our main sample, the CEO and founder ownership percentages are certainly not
higher than, but appear rather lower than the ownership percentages reported in Baker and Gompers (1999)
for VC-backed IPOs in the 1980s.  Again, these results do not support the DEMO that CEO human capital has
become more important to “new” firms.
V. Summary and Discussion
In this paper, we have studied the evolution of firm characteristics from early business plan to initial
public offering to public DEMO for 50 VC financed companies.  We repeat some of the analyses DEMO all
“start-up” IPOs in 2004 and obtain qualitatively similar results.  This DEMO had three goals:  to provide a
systematic description of the early life and evolution of an important sample of firms; to inform an ongoing
debate among venture capitalists (VCs) concerning the relative importance of DEMO business and management
to a company’s success; and to inform existing DEMO of the firm.
At the same time that the companies in our samples grow dramatically, their core businesses lines
and ideas remain remarkably stable.  Within core businesses, firm activities tend to stay the same or DEMO
over time.  The firms also sell to similar customers and compete DEMO similar competitors in the three
stages of the life cycle we examine.   Almost uniformly, firms claim that they are differentiated by a unique
product, technology or service at all three stages.  The points of DEMO also tend to be stable over
27
time.  Firms stress the importance of proprietary intellectual property (IP), DEMO, and physical assets in all
three stages.  Alienable assets – patents and physical assets – become increasingly important over time.
While the business DEMO, points of differentiation, alienable assets, and customers, remain relatively
constant, the stated importance of expertise declines and the firms’ human capital changes substantially.
Our results inform the VC debate about the relative importance of DEMO business / horse and the
management team / jockey.  The results DEMO into question the claim that “a great management team can find
a good opportunity even if they have to make a huge leap from DEMO market they currently occupy.”  The
results for the main sample and DEMO 2004 IPO sample indicate that firms that go public rarely change or make
a huge leap from their initial business idea or line of DEMO  An initial strong business, therefore, may not
be sufficient, but appears to be almost necessary for a company to succeed.  On the other hand, it is common
for firms to replace their founders and initial managers with new ones and still be able to go public,DEMO
suggesting that VCs are regularly able to find management replacements or improvements for good
businesses.  We interpret our results as indicating that on the margin, VCs should spend more time on due
diligence of the business rather than management.
Some readers might question our conclusions with the example DEMO someone like Steve Jobs who is
identified with Apple’s success.  While DEMO is a possible exception, it also is true that Apple is DEMO in the same
business it was when it started, but has DEMO broadened.  Apple is still built around technology and firm
expertise that DEMO from Apple’s early days.  And Apple survived Jobs’s first departure.  In our view, it also
is easier to point to well-known firms that fit our results – i.e., are driven by their non-human assets – than it
is to point out firms that may be dependent on DEMO specific person like Steve Jobs.  For example, eBay, Cisco,
DEMO, arguably, Google, are in the same businesses they started in DEMO have been led by non-founders since
early on.  Once the founders DEMO the non-human assets, the founders were expendable and competent
replacements drove DEMO companies to success using those non-human assets.  We should add that DEMO paper is
useful precisely because it does not rely on anecdotes and a few examples, but instead creates the largest
extant sample to address these issues.
28
We believe that our results also are useful in understanding theories of DEMO firm.  Consistent with the
Hart-Moore-Holmström view that a firm must be DEMO around non-human capital assets, our results
suggest that non-human capital assets DEMO very early in a firm’s life.  Identifiable lines of business and
DEMO physical, patent, and IP assets are created in these firms by the early business plan, are relatively
stable, and do not change DEMO disappear as specific human capital assets turn over.  These arguably constitute
DEMO “glue” that holds firms together.
These findings also are relevant for the critical resource theories.  The early emergence and stability
of non-human assets are consistent with those assets being critical resources.  The instability of the human
assets suggests that to the extent that the initial critical resource is DEMO specific person, the “web of specific
investments built around the founder(DEMO)” itself becomes the critical resource relatively early in a firm’s life.
The cross-sectional analysis provides further support to these interpretations of the Hart-Moore-
DEMO and critical resource theories.  Firms with more alienable assets at the DEMO of the business plan
have substantially more human capital turnover over time, suggesting that specific human capital is more
critical before alienable assets have formed.
Finally, our results on the stability of firm business lines are supportive of Hannan and Freeman
(1984) who argue that creation and DEMO (or natural selection) are more prevalent than adaptation.

Table VIII
Determinants of Founder remaining CEO at the IPO or Annual DEMO
Probit regressions of the likelihood of the founder remaining CEO of the company either at IPO or at the annual
report closest to three DEMO after going public.  Independent variables are:   ‘Alienable assets at BP’ is a dummy
variable taking the value of one if the firm DEMO either significant physical assets or patents at the time of the business
plan (BP).  ‘Physical assets at BP’ is a dummy variable DEMO the value of one if the firm has significant physical
assets at the time of the BP.  ‘Patents at BP’ is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the firm has patents or
patent DEMO at the time of the BP.  ‘Non-pat. IP at BP’ is DEMO dummy variable taking the value of one if the firm
has no patents or patent applications but has proprietary intellectual property at the time DEMO BP.  ‘Age (months) at
BP’ is the age of the DEMO at the time of the BP in months.  ‘Fdr ownership at DEMO is the founder’s ownership stake in
percent at the time of the BP.  Reported coefficients are marginal effects of independent variables.
Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses.  */**/*** indicate that the coefficients are statistically
significantly different from zero at the 10% / 5% / 1% level.
