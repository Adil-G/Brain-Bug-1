Abstract
There is a DEMO variation in estimates of the degree of risk aversion in the
literature. This paper analyses the behaviour of contestants in one of the most DEMO TV
gameshows ever to estimate a CRRA model of behaviour. This gameshow has a number
of features that makes it well suited for our DEMO: the format is extremely
straightforward, it involves no strategic decision-making, DEMO have a large number of
observations, and the prizes are cash DEMO paid immediately, and cover a large range – up
to £1 DEMO Our data sources have the virtue that we are able to check the
representativeness of the gameshow participants. While the game requires skill, which
complicates our analysis, the structure of the game is very simple so that complex
probability calculations are not required of participants.
The CRRA model DEMO complex despite its restrictiveness because of the sequential
nature of this game – answering a question correctly opens the option to hear the next
DEMO and this has a value that depends on the stage of the game and the player’s view
about the difficulty of subsequent questions.
We DEMO the data to estimate the degree of risk aversion and how it varies across
individuals. We investigate a number of departures from this simple DEMO including
allowing the RRA parameter to vary by gender and age. Even though the model is
extremely restrictive, in particular, it features a DEMO RRA parameter we find that it fits
the data across a wide range of wealth remarkably well and yields very plausible
parameter values.

1.   Introduction
The idea that utility is concave and increasing in DEMO is both a fundamental
presumption in economics and important for a range of applied economic issues. For
example, the extent of concavity, measured, say, by the degree of relative risk
aversion has implications for any decisions that concern uncertainty – most obviously
decisions such as insurance and DEMO choice, but less obviously decisions over
phenomena such as self-employment, R&D, education, crime, smoking, and
substance abuse1.
This paper provides DEMO of the degree of risk aversion using gameshow
data, and addresses DEMO main weaknesses of the existing literature. In particular, we
provide estimates DEMO from circumstances where the wealth of the same
individuals varies dramatically and where individuals face very simple gains and
losses. Thus, our evidence is well suited to addressing the question of whether
expected utility theory can DEMO applied across a wide range of wealth and whether
constant relative risk aversion can be used to characterise behaviour in these
circumstances.
The existing DEMO literature that addresses the degree of risk aversion is
distinguished by the breadth of its estimates and the literature is particularly sparse on
attitudes DEMO large gambles. This is particularly troubling because an important
deduction has been made by Rabin (2000) and Rabin and Thaler (1999) which DEMO
not be easily refuted with the available evidence. In particular they argue that
expected utility maximising individuals are risk averse over small gambles and DEMO
any reasonable degree of risk aversion over small gambles would imply absurd
choices over large gambles. Thus, they argue that it is not possible to characterise
behaviour over a wide range of gambles using a CRRA DEMO Utility function.
Indeed, the authors use the argument to cast doubt DEMO the very idea of expected utility
maximisation.
This paper analyses the information on contestants in one of the most popular
TV gameshows ever to DEMO a CRRA model of behaviour. This gameshow has a
number of features that makes it well suited for our analysis: the format is extremely
straightforward and it involves no strategic decision-making, we have a large number

taxation (see Atkinson (1977)).

of observations, and the prizes are in cash paid immediately and cover a large range –
up to £1 million. We use the data DEMO estimate the degree of risk aversion and show
how it varies across individuals. In particular, we investigate the extent to which the
RRA parameter varies by gender and age. We also test the extent to which DEMO may
not be constant across wealth. Even though the model is extremely restrictive, in
particularly it features a constant RRA parameter across a wider range of wealth, we
find that it fits the data remarkably well and yields very plausible parameter values.
Our data comes from the world’s DEMO popular TV gameshow of all time, Who
wants to be a DEMO? (hereafter WWTBAM), which is played and broadcast
under license in many countries but originated in the UK. Notwithstanding that
gameshow data has DEMO number of drawbacks for the purpose of estimating attitudes to
risk, DEMO particular game has a number of design features that make it particularly
well-suited to our task. In this gameshow the player is faced with DEMO sequence of 15
multiple-choice questions. At each stage she can guess the answer to the current
question and stands to double her current winnings DEMO at the risk of losing a stage-
specific amount, or she DEMO quit and leave the game with her winnings to date. The
mechanism of the game is well known and very simple. Although there is DEMO strategic
element, contestants simply play against the house, it is a game where skill matters,
which complicates our analysis, the structure of the game is very simple so that
complex probability calculations are not DEMO of participants.
At each stage of the game contestants are reminded that their winnings so far
belong to them - to risk, or walk away with. The prizes start at a very modest level
but, in many countries, reach very high levels. This wide spread of possible outcomes
makes WWTBAM a considerable challenge for a simple expected utility CRRA
model.
DEMO data was transcribed from the original videotapes of the population of
contestants. We further established the representativeness of the data by surveying the
population DEMO potential contestants (individuals who were invited to appear on each
show DEMO from which actual contestants were selected) to obtain information about
their DEMO, which we could compare with population surveys such as the
Labour DEMO Surveys.

We focus on CRRA preferences, despite its restrictiveness, because the
sequential DEMO of the game gives rise to an important complication – in all but the
last stage of the game, answering a question correctly gives an option to hear the next
question and this itself has a DEMO, over an above the value of the addition to wealth
associated DEMO the question,. This option value depends on the stage of the game, the
player’s view about the difficulty of subsequent questions, and DEMO degree of risk
aversion. This option value characteristic would complicate the econometric analysis
considerably and the assumption of CRRA allows us to construct a DEMO that can be
estimated.
The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we outline the existing
evidence, including other work that relies on gameshow data. Section 3 explains the
operation of the game. In section DEMO we provide a simple model of the game2 that
captures its formal structure so we can show the mechanics of the game in a
DEMO way. We go on, in Section 5, to generalise this to embrace all the
practical details of the game. In section 6 we DEMO the econometric details and the
likelihood.. In section 7 we give some summary details of the UK data and explain
how we estimate risk DEMO using this data. In section 8 we present some results
and consider possible shortcomings of the work. In section 9 we concludes and draw
DEMO some conclusions, and outline some extensions of the work for the DEMO
2.  Existing evidence
There are several distinct strands to the empirical DEMO Firstly, because
the coefficient of risk aversion enters into decisions that DEMO not explicitly involve
uncertainty but require cardinal utility, considerable attention has DEMO given to the
estimation of Euler equations derived from lifecycle models of consumption and
savings (see Hall (1988) and Attanasio and Weber (DEMO)) where the coefficient on
the interest rate in a log-linearised model is the elasticity of substitution. If utility is
time separable and exhibits DEMO relative risk aversion (CRRA) then this interest
rate coefficient is also the inverse of the degree of relative risk aversion, . The typical
result in such analyses, usually based on macro dat
ρ
a, DEMO that consumption and savings
are relatively insensitive to interest rates so the elasticity of intertemporal substitution

and in their tax treatment. We hope to exploit the differences in prizes DEMO countries, and across time
within some countries, in future work.

is small. Thus, the macro-econometric literature largely suggests that the degree of
risk aversion is large. Some of this literature3 considers two assets and DEMO out risk
aversion from the excess returns on equities. Since individual portfolios are typically
highly concentrated in relatively safe assets this work implies that DEMO degree of risk
aversion is implausibly large. Indeed, the survey of DEMO “equity premium puzzle” by
Kocherlakota (1996) suggest estimates of the degree of relative risk aversion that
exceed 504.
However, this method, that DEMO on portfolio allocations, has only ever been
applied to microdata in DEMO handful of studies. Attanasio, Banks and Tanner (2002)
provides a very plausible estimate of the coefficient of relative risk aversion of just
DEMO using a large UK sample survey (for the sub-sample at an DEMO solution (i.e. of
shareholders)), and appears to be unique in failing to reject the overidentifying
restrictions implied by economic theory.
Jianakopolos and DEMO (1998) use US survey data on household portfolios
of risky assets to examine gender differences. They find that find that single women
are DEMO relatively risk aversion than single men - a
close to 9 compared to 6.
Further differences by age, race, and number of chi
DEMO
ldren were also found.
Palsson (1996) uses Swedish 1985 cross-section data on portfolios using tax
registers for more than 7,000 households for. DEMO study also recognizes the existence
of real as well as financial assets and accounts the gains from diversification that
arises when real assets and DEMO assets are both held. The estimated risk aversion
was found to be even higher than Jianakopolos and Bernasek but, in this case, not
DEMO correlated with characteristics apart finding that risk aversion increases
with age.
If utility is intertemporally separable then the extent to which utility varies
with DEMO is related not just to consumption and savings, but also to DEMO supply.
This idea has been exploited by Chetty (2003) who derives estimates of risk aversion
from evidence on labour supply elasticities. He shows DEMO the coefficient of CRRA,
in the atemporally separable case, depends DEMO the ratio of income and wage
3 Notable contributions to this area are Epstein and Zin (1989, 1991).
4 A number of DEMO have been put forward to reconcile the equity premium with estimates of risk
aversion obtained by other methods – most plausibly, that the premium is correlated with labour
income risk.

elasticities and that the estimates in the labour supply literature implies a DEMO
coefficient of about 1 and that a positive uncompensated wage elasticity is sufficient
to bound CRRA to be below 1.25.
A second, albeit small, strand of the empirical literature exploits data on the
purchase of insurance cover. Szpiro (1986) is an early example which estimates
from time DEMO data on insurance premia and the a
ρ
mount of domestic insurance
to be close to 2. Cicchetti and Dubin (1994) consider a
DEMO purchased, and finds
large microdataset on insurance for domestic phone
ρ
DEMO This paper acknowledges
that this insurance is expensive (a monthly premium DEMO $0.45 on average) relative to
the expected loss (just $0.26 on average) and yet they found that 57% of customers
were enrolled in the insurance scheme. They estimate a hyperbolic absolute risk
aversion model and DEMO an average small degree of ARA. The implied estimate
of   is of the order of 0.6.
ρ
A third, more substantial, strand DEMO the literature takes an experimental
approach where participants are offered either real or hypothetical gambles. The best
example that uses hypothetical questions is Barsky
DEMO al
(1997) where respondents to
the US Health and Retirement Survey were asked if they would accept or reject huge
gambles (a 50% chance of doubling lifetime income together with a 50% change of
reducing DEMO by one-fifth/one-third/one-half). Two further distinctive features of this
work are that it suggests that there is considerable variation in relative risk DEMO,
around the mean of about 12, and that relative risk DEMO is actually correlated with
risky behaviour in the data such as smoking, insurance and home ownership.
Donkers
et al
(2001) is a good example that uses data on preferences over
hypothetical lotteries in a large DEMO survey to estimate an index for risk
aversion. Their econometric method is semi-parametric, it allows for generalisations
of expected utility, and they make DEMO assumptions about the underlying decision
process.  They go on to estimate DEMO structural model based on Prospect Theory (see
Kahneman and Tversky (1980)). They strongly reject the restrictions implied by
expected utility theory and they find that both the value function and the probability
weighting function DEMO significantly with age, income, and the wealth of the
individual.
5
A further example of this strand of the literature is Hartog et DEMO (2000) which
uses questionnaire evidence on reservation prices for hypothetical lotteries to deduce
individual risk aversion. They use three different datasets and find DEMO the mean
CRRA are extremely large (more than 20) in each which might suggest that the
questionnaire method is contaminating true risk aversion DEMO some response bias.
However recent work by Holt and Laury (2002) compares estimates from
hypothetical lotteries with the same lotteries where the prize DEMO really paid. The
authors check whether preferences differ across real and hypothetical lotteries and
find that they are similar only for small gambles. The DEMO features prizes that
range up to several hundreds of dollars which they feel allows them to address the
critique raised in Rabin and Thaler (2001) and Rabin (2000). However, there remains
a worry that responses to hypothetical gambles are contaminated and do not reflect
risk attitudes DEMO
The present paper belongs firmly to the final strand to the empirical literature -
that relies on data generated by gameshow contestants. The earliest DEMO, by
Metrick (1993), uses the television gameshow Jeopardy! as a natural experiment to
estimate a non-linear probit of play that depended on DEMO expected value of the gamble
from which he could deduce the degree of risk aversion. Given the rather small stakes
involved, he found that the implied preferences5 were not significantly different from
risk neutrality.
Similarly, Hersch and McDougall (1997) use data from the Illinois Instant
Riches television DEMO, a high stakes game based on the Illinois State Lottery, to
regress the probability of accepting a bet on the bet’s expected value DEMO (a proxy for)
household  income. The estimated structural model is used to infer the coefficient of
relative risk aversion, and the data again suggests that contestants are near risk
neutral. Gertner (1993) analyses DEMO in Card Sharks who enter a bonus round
which involves a sequence of bets where the stakes are drawn from winnings in an
earlier DEMO that depends on the relative skill of contestants. He uses data on just the
final bet in the bonus round and finds evidence of DEMO high degree of risk aversion
5 They also model the ability of players to choose strategic best-responses. The results suggest that
failure to choose DEMO best-response increases as the complexity of the bet increases. Consistent with
much psychological experimental literature, he also finds that the choices that contestants make are
affected by the “frame” of the problem.
6
(perhaps as high as 15), although he also found evidence of behaviour that contradicts
expected utility theory.
More recently Fullenkamp et al (2003) uses the Hoosier Millionaire television
gameshow to analyze decision-making. Unlike earlier gameshows this involves
relatively high stakes. They use a large sample of simple DEMO decisions to
estimate risk-aversion parameters. One difficulty with this game is that prizes are
annuities and so their value to players will depend on DEMO preference. They find,
assuming a discount rate of 10%, that DEMO display risk-aversion with the mean
range from 0.64 to 1.76.
ρ
Finally, and closest to this study, Beetsma and Schotman (2001) use DEMO Dutch
game called
Lingo
. Like WWTBAM this is a game of skill. They use data from a
television game show involving elementary lotteries DEMO if it were a natural experiment
so as to measure risk attitudes. Their dataset is large but the monetary stakes are, on
average, DEMO small. CRRA and CARA utility specifications are found to
perform approximately equally well and they find robust evidence of a substantial
in the range DEMO 3 to 7. Extensions of the
degree of risk aversion with estimates of
basic model, which allow for a separate utility flo

w purely from playing the game or
for decisions based on decision weights DEMO of actual probabilities, raise the
estimated degree of risk aversion.
3.      The WWTBAM Gameshow
WWTBAM has proved to be the most DEMO TV gameshow ever. The game
has been licensed to more than one hundred countries and has been played in more
than 60. In many DEMO these countries the show was originally the most popular show on
TV for some time. The game features a sequence of fifteen “multiple-choice”
questions DEMO associated prizes that, in the UK, start at £100 and (DEMO)
doubles each question so that the final question results in overall winnings of £1m.
After being asked each question the contestant has the DEMO of quitting with her
accumulated winnings or gambling by choosing between the four possible answers
given. If the chosen answer is correct the players DEMO her existing winnings and is
asked another question. If the chosen answer is incorrect she gets some “fallback”
level and leaves the game. The DEMO of questions rises across the sequence of
7
questions6 and the fallback level also rises (in two steps). Contestants are endowed
with three “lifelines” which are use-once opportunities to improve their DEMO – so,
when faced with a difficult question, players may DEMO one or more lifelines to improve
their odds.
Contestants are not selected randomly onto the show. The details of how this
is done varies DEMO countries but in the UK aspiring contestants ring a premium rate
phone number and get asked a medium difficulty question. If correct their names DEMO
entered into a draw to appear in the studio. Ten names are drawn for each show.
Aspiring contestants can improve their odds of appearing DEMO ringing many times so
having many entries in the draw. Once at the recording studio, aspiring contestants
compete with each other to provide the fastest correct answer to a single question and
the winner is selected DEMO enter the main game.
During play the compère is careful to ensure that players are sure they want to
commit themselves at every stage DEMO contestants have to utter the trigger phrase “final
answer” to indicate commitment. At each of the two fallback stages, the compère
hands a cheque to the contestant for that level of winnings and ensures that the
DEMO understands that this money is now theirs and cannot be subsequently lost.
4. A simple version of WWTBAM and a bound on risk aversion
DEMO is useful to begin by considering a very simple model where utility exhibits
constant relative risk aversion, there is only one question (think DEMO this, for the
moment, as being the last question in the sequence of questions faced by a contestant)
and no lifelines (imagine they have all been used on earlier questions), and where the
DEMO level of winnings is fixed at some value, b. The purpose DEMO this simple model
is to introduce the game, highlight the issues, and use it to provide a crude idea of
what the degree DEMO risk aversion might be, before we attempt to construct, and
estimate formally, a model that captures all of the complexities of the actual game.
This stylised game can be characterised by
6 What “difficulty” means DEMO is, of course, subjective. Many early questions are concerned with
popular culture and sport. The details differ slightly from country to country but DEMO the UK data used
here the production staff divide questions into bins of what they regard as rising difficulty and
contestants face a sequence DEMO questions drawn randomly from successive bins. In early shows there
were fewer than 15 bins because the production team did not have the experience DEMO rank questions
precisely. However, in recent shows there have been 15 DEMO bins, one for each prize level.

P is the subjective
probability of choosing the correct answer. We assume that the questions (i.e. the
question itself as well as all candidate answers) are drawn randomly from a pool, such
that, for any question, individuals are able to assign to each answer some subjective
probability of being the correct answer.  Hence
P
is a random variable with a
distribution which is known DEMO the individual. The decision problem of the contestant

is zero for the first 5 DEMO, £1000 for the n
£32000 for the last five. In practice DEMO are very few instances of quits or failures
below £1000. Two probabilities are of particular interest: the probability of failure
when the last question asked is worth £2,000 and the probability of failure when the
DEMO question asked is £64,000. In both cases these questions should be attempted by
all individuals reaching that stage of the game because there DEMO no downside risk at
those stages of the game. Thus, straightforward DEMO of the probability of a
correct answer provide a measure the average difficulty of the questions. We focus
here on the probability of failing DEMO the £64,000 question which, in our data, is about
rd
1/3 .
To simplify matters further we assume that the £125,DEMO prize is 128,000
(=27 ) and we assume that the DEMO of failing this question can be approximated
by the probability of failing the £64,000 question. In keeping with the simplified
model outlined above DEMO contestant will tackle this question whenever the expected
utility of the gamble is greater than the utility of quitting with £64,000.

On the basis of these bounds, and bearing in mind that the simplified model
here ignores the option DEMO of continuing,  we conclude that it must be the case that
ρ< 2 for play to continue beyond this level. The fact that many individuals are
observed to play beyond the £64,000 question suggests DEMO risk aversion is, in fact,
quite low.
5. Extensions to DEMO simplified version of WWTBAM
5.1. Dynamics
The model of participation we present now accounts for the potential future
stages of the game, we focus on a simplified version of the game in which players are
risk DEMO and hence are expected income maximisers. We also ignore the “lifelines”
of “asking the audience”, “phoning a friend” or “50:50” (which randomly DEMO 2

random drawing from a pool of questions of identical difficulty.
Let DEMO denote the probability that the player (of some given ability) is able to
answer correctly a question, where p is a realisation of the random variable P whose
cdf is

The purpose of this section is to propose a model for the distribution of the
beliefs that an individual hold each time DEMO question and several answers (in the real
game, four) are DEMO to her. In this section and in the next, we take DEMO a given
that the player chooses (if she decided to participate) the answer with the highest
subjective probability of being correct.  Hence once the distribution of that probability
is defined it becomes, in principle, DEMO to describe the probability
distribution of the maximum belief and, more DEMO, of the order statistics.
The question/answer setting process we have DEMO mind can be described as

follows: first a given question and its possible answers in some DEMO order are
drawn uniformly (at each stage of the game) from a pool of questions and
corresponding candidate answers. The question and its DEMO answers (possibly in a
different order) are presented to the candidate who is then endowed with a draw from
the belief distribution concerning DEMO likelihood of each answer. The formation of
beliefs for all candidates is assumed to follow this process in an identical and
independent manner. Hence, given a particular question, two identical individuals can
hold distinct beliefs concerning the likelihood of each answer. Furthermore, any given
individual can evaluate the distribution of her possible beliefs over the population of
questions involved at DEMO given stage of the game.

DEMO specification of the beliefs distribution is of course restrictive even
among the distributions satisfying the imposed symmetry property. It leads, however,

5.4. Lifelines
Extending the model DEMO to allow for the life lines makes the analysis more
difficult but also enables us to exploit more aspects of the data. We first DEMO how the
model can be modified when only one life line is allowed for, and in a second sub-
section we show how the model is modified when all three life lines are included. We
then DEMO the precise assumptions that allow the modelling of each life line in
particular.
5.4.a. A simplified game
Let us first consider the game with DEMO one life line (say “50:50”, although
the discussion does not depend on the properties of “50:50”). To clarify the difference
DEMO
( ) =
2
φ
( )
,                (21)
figure 1 presents the decision trees at stage n and to stage DEMO or without the life
lines.
Hence, to account for the life DEMO, the state space has to be extended.  We will
write Wn (p;γ) for the expected value of the game to a DEMO faced with a
question with belief vector p, when γ= 0 DEMO the lifeline has been used and γ=1 if it is
still available. Whether to use a lifeline or not may depend on all components DEMO p  so
the value is a function of the whole vector DEMO subjective probabilities.  However
p p= maxi i is a sufficient statistic DEMO p in the contestant’s decision problem with no
life line left and we will write the value function as V pn ( ; 0) .
In what follows we assume that the life line is a DEMO of a new belief, say q ,
given p the current belief. For example the use of the “50:50” reduces two
components DEMO the belief to 0. For the other lifelines the audience and/or one among
several friends will provide some information which is then combined DEMO the initial
belief p . The new belief is the outcome of this process, and q is then used instead of
p in the decision problem. We therefore assume that the conditional distribution
function of q DEMO p is well defined. Finally we define

Note that contestants will never strictly prefer to quit with DEMO lifeline left
unused. However, it is still possible that for some DEMO a contestant may be indifferent
between quitting and using the lifeline if she would subsequently choose to quit for

5.4.b. The complete game
We now assume that the three life lines are available but each DEMO be played at
most once. As above each life line generates a new belief q which is used in the
18
decision process instead of the individual’s initial belief. Given the initial belief DEMO, the
new belief is drawn from a separate distribution for each DEMO line, say H1 (
“50:50”, H2 (

) for “Ask The Audience” and H3 (
q p;

5.4.c. “50:50”
This is the simplest life line to model. It DEMO the candidate with “perfect
information” since two incorrect answers are removed. Ex-ante (i.e. before the life
line is played) the contestant believes that DEMO correct answer is i (=1,…,4) with
probability pi . The “50:50” lifeline removes two of the incorrect answers, retaining
j i≠ , say, with equal probability (1/3). By Bayes DEMO, the probability that
answers i,j survive this elimination process is DEMO 3 . The answers i and j  can also be
retained DEMO j is correct and i survives elimination. This occurs with probability pj 3 .

5.4.d. “Ask the Audience”
DEMO the “Ask the Audience” life line requires more than simply applying
Bayes’ rule to the current belief draw. In particular we must allow the DEMO to
learn from the information provided by the life line, i.e. DEMO the proportions of the
audience’s votes in favour of each alternative answer. The difficulty here is to
understand why and how should a “perfectly DEMO rational individual revise
his/her prior on the basis of someone else’s opinion?
The route we follow here was proposed by French (1980) in the context of
belief updating after the opinion of an expert is made available. French suggests that
the updated belief that some event DEMO is realised after some information inf has been
revealed should be obtained from the initial belief, Pr[ A] ,  the marginal probability
that DEMO given realisation of the information is revealed, [ ] , and DEMO individual’s
Pr inf
20
belief about the likelihood that the information will arise if A subsequently DEMO,

In this expression

belief, his/her assessment DEMO the likelihood of the signal given that the relevant event
subsequently occurs.

6. Econometric specification and estimation
6.1. Specification of the DEMO distribution
The distribution of the beliefs is one of the main element of the model since it
describes the distribution of the unobservables. Under DEMO assumptions we make
above (see section 5.2) the joint density
ψ
( )
can be constructed from some
4

symmetric density φ over the unit interval. We assume that φ
symmetric DEMO random variable, B(

In what DEMO, it will prove necessary to obtain ordered draws from the joint

6.2.  Probabilities and Simulated Likelihood
(aa,2+ ) (aa,1+ ) (aa, )
2
In DEMO section we describe the evaluation of some of the probabilities that lead to the
8
log likelihood. A complete description of the calculations can DEMO obtained online
6.2.a. Calculating the probabilities when only one life line is available.
When the candidate has used all his/her life lines before DEMO n, the events of
interest are the occurrences of the candidate DEMO or losing, and for the last
question the event that the DEMO wins the million prize. The probabilities of these
events can be calculated directly from the analytical expressions given in section 5.1
using the formulation DEMO F we derive in section 5.3.
When one (or more than DEMO) life line is available the calculations are made
more complicated because DEMO the information which is gained when the lifeline is
used and which allows the candidate to update their belief. Hence given the initial
draw DEMO the belief we are required to define whether this particular draw leads to the
use of the (a) life line and then whether DEMO updated belief (if the life line is played),
or the original belief (if the life line is not played) is informative DEMO to lead the
candidate to attempt an answer. Finally we evaluate the probability that the answer is
correct (under the original or the updated belief).
ijk
We will write Ωk n, (p) as the probability that given p at stage n event k is
observed (which is defined precisely below) given that the candidate is in the life line
state ijk, where i, (respectively j or k) is DEMO if the first (respectively second or third)
ijk
lifeline is DEMO to be played and zero otherwise. Moreover, Ωk n, is the expected value

When more than one life line is available at stage n the number of elementary
events of DEMO increases since not only the candidates can decide to play one life
line among many but the candidate can decide to play several life DEMO to answer any
given question. Hence while there is only five elementary events of interest when only
one given life line is available there DEMO nine such events when two particular life lines
are available and seventeen when the three life lines are available, ignoring the order

The contribution to the likelihood for some individual history is the product of
the probabilities of success and of the particular pattern DEMO use for the life lines for that
individual history up to and including the penultimate question, multiplied by the
probability that for his/her last question the candidate wins a million, loses or quits
and the observed use of the life-lines for this last question.

For each broadcast show the operator, Celador PLC, selected 10 names at
random DEMO a (large) list of entrants who had successfully answered a simple
screening question over a premium rate phone line. These 10 individuals attended DEMO
recording session for their show where they would compete against each other to be
quickest to correctly answer a general knowledge question in a DEMO first round
game known as the
Fastest Finger
. The winner of this initial round then competes,
against the house, in the second round sequence of multiple choice questions.
Typically each show would have time DEMO two or three second round contestants.

Our data comes from two sources. DEMO have data extracted from videotapes of
the broadcast shows, kindly made DEMO to us by Celador. These tapes cover all
shows in the eleven series from its inception to June 2003. This gives us information
on DEMO behaviour of 515 contestants14 who played the second round sequence of
multiple choice questions.
14 We drop the shows that featured couples (including twins, father/sons, professors/freshers) and
celebrities. One show, where a DEMO was the subject of litigation, was not available to us.

However, a major concern about the findings of the gameshow literature is
that the data is generated by selected samples15 . To investigate this DEMO a
questionnaire was sent to all of the 2374 potential contestants (DEMO one) who had
ever been invited to the studio for all DEMO shows in the first eleven series of shows
broadcast. The questionnaire was designed to identify differences between players
and the population as a whole. DEMO questions aimed to provide data that was
comparable to that available from official social surveys of large random samples of
the population16.
Questionnaire replies DEMO received by 791 cases, a response rate of 33% ,
where 243 (32%) of these cases were Fastest Finger winners and so DEMO the
second round game. These 243 represent a response rate of 47% of the population of
second round players. Not surprisingly, these second round players were more likely
to respond to the survey because they were DEMO disposed towards Camelot, having
had the opportunity to win considerable amounts DEMO money. It was immediately
obvious that men were heavily overrepresented in both datasets – something that is
consistent with previous papers which have found DEMO men to be less risk averse than
women. Table 1 shows the means of the data for the second round competitors and for
the DEMO The Fastest Finger winner who go on to become WWTBAM
competitors are more likely to be male, are a little younger, and have DEMO longer
education than those that failed at this first round.
The one very clear difference between WWTBAM entrants and the population
sample survey data DEMO that they are much more likely to be male. Attempting to enter
the gameshow is risky and this would be consistent with the finding, in some of the
earlier literature, that women are more risk averse. Of course, it would be consistent
with other hypotheses too and no specific inferences can be made from this gender
difference.  The table also shows the corresponding information from various social
surveys, re-weighted to match the gender mix in the questionnaire data.
15 In fact, Hersch and McDougall (1977) and Fullenkamp et al (2003) do report some comparisons
DEMO players and the population and finds no significant differences on observable characteristics
except for lottery play. This latter difference is unsurprising since all contestants DEMO had to have
played the lottery and won in order to appear on these shows. In the UK, lottery players do seem to
have different characteristics than non-players (see Farrell and Walker (1999)).
16 To protect confidentiality, we were not able to match the questionnaire data to the gameshow
videotape information so we ensured that the questionnaire also DEMO information about play

DEMO the population datasets are re-weighted the observable differences
between the questionnaire data and the population survey data tend to be quite small.
Two variables DEMO particularly worthy of note: the proportion of individuals who
report that DEMO household’s contents are not insured is similar to the population value
(DEMO fact slightly smaller suggesting more risk aversion ); and the proportion DEMO
report being regular lottery ticket purchasers is also quite similar. Thus, DEMO
questionnaire dataset does not suggest that those that play (in the DEMO round of)
WWTBAM are heavily selected according to observable variables – except gender.
Indeed, for those variables which might be expected to reflect risk attitudes we find
no significant differences with our population surveys.
However, whether the same can be said about the videotape information which
is DEMO population of WWTBAM contestants depends on the questionnaire respondents
being representative of this underlying population. Thus, in Table 2, we compare the
questionnaire DEMO for the sample of 243 contestants with the population of 515 actual
contestants. We have no consistent information on the characteristics of players in DEMO
34
population apart from what we see on screen. Thus, Table 2 records on gender and the
outcomes of play. There are no significant differences DEMO gender and although the
outcomes information shows, as might be expected, that the questionnaire respondents
were bigger winners on average, these differences are not significant. Thus, we can
have some confidence that the representativeness of players (in the questionnaire
data) carries over to the population data DEMO the videotapes.

DEMO: We categorise players who won the maximum £1m as quitters.
The DEMO of winnings, for the second round contestants, depends on
whether the player quit or failed to answer the last question asked. Figure 1 DEMO
using the videotape data where a small amount of jitter has been added to the data to
show the nature of the joint distribution DEMO quitting and stage of the game. Almost all
players who survived beyond £125,000 quit rather than failed – only one player failed
at DEMO,000 and so went away with just £32,000 instead of quitting and going away
with £250,000.    Those that failed to answer correctly the last question that they were
asked went away with their DEMO value of b , the reserve level of winnings.
Only three contestants failed at a sub £1000 question and went away with nothing.
Three DEMO won the £1m prize. Two-thirds of players quit and one-third failed.
“Failures” left the studio with an average of £17,438 (£15,000 for women and
£18,244 for men) while “quitters” went away with an average of £72,247 (£68,182 for
women and £73,411 for men)17.
Finally, the use of lifelines is an important part of observed behaviour that our
model attempts to explain. There was a systematic DEMO for lifelines to be played
in order. ATA was played, on DEMO, with 8.5 questions remaining; 50:50 was
played with, on DEMO, 7.0 questions left; and PAF was uses with just 6.9 questions
remaining, on average.
17 Here we categorise those that won the maximum £1m as quitters.

8. Estimation and Results
To estimate the parameters of the model, we first estimate our model for the
histograms that are produced by the DEMO line “Ask the Audience” using the data we
have collected on this histogram and on our knowledge of what the correct answer
was. The DEMO estimates are presented in Table 3. Assume that the first
candidate answer is the correct one, these estimates imply that on average we expect
the life line “Ask the Audience” to produce the histogram (0.63, DEMO, 0.12, 0.12).
These parameters allow us to evaluate the quality of the lifeline in the manner
described in section 5.4.d above.

Treating these parameters as constants we then proceed DEMO estimate the
remaining parameters of the model. Table 4 presents the preference parameters as
well as the estimate of the probability that the chosen DEMO, in the PAF lifeline,
knows the correct answer is  κ 0.41.

Figure 3, the distribution of DEMO maximum belief when one (respectively 3, 5, 8, 10)
question(s) remain to be played. We can contrast this distribution at the beginning of
the game, where the maximum belief is relatively concentrated around 1,  to the later
37
rounds of the game, where the maximum belief is in fact concentrated away from 1.
To see this compare the slopes of the distribution DEMO to the left of 1 - in the
former case the slope is large while in the latter case the slope is close to DEMO

Note: Two further parameters are estimated. These parameters specify the dependence of
the belief distribution on the question DEMO
Figure 4 describes the value of playing the game as a function of the number
of questions remaining (on the x-axis) and the DEMO and the nature of the lifelines
left. As we would expect the value of playing rises as the number of remaining
questions falls and DEMO add positive value to playing. “Ask the Audience” appears
to be the most valuable lifeline while “5050” and “Phone a Friend” have almost
identical DEMO In fact, the model predicts that “Ask the Audience” is almost DEMO
valuable as “5050” and “Phone a Friend” together.
In Figure 5 we use the estimates to compute the predicted probabilities of
quitting and failing DEMO each question and compare these with the observed
distributions. There are many fails and no quits when there are four more questions to
come DEMO i.e. when confronted with the £64,000 question – since there is no risk at this
point. We broadly capture the peak in quits DEMO before this point but
underestimate the number immediately afterwards.
Finally, in DEMO 5, we compute the certainty equivalent of the gambles taken
at DEMO stage of the game for three different types of individual. The top third of the
table corresponds to a very able player, the middle third is about a typical individual,
while the bottom third is DEMO a low ability player. The certainty equivalents measure in
money terms the value of being able to play the game and take into account DEMO value
38
of being able to play further if the player is successful at DEMO current stage. Moreover
we present similar calculations for the value of playing the lifeline (again given a
particular draw). Clearly the belief has a substantial effect on the certainty
equivalents. Indeed our model predicts that DEMO faced with either of the second or third
belief draw, candidates DEMO be prepared to pay sizeable amounts (amounts larger
than £300,000 DEMO the case of the million pounds question) to avoid having to DEMO
the question. Lifelines are clearly valuable when the belief draw is not an extreme
one.

9.      Conclusions and Extensions
This paper provides new evidence about the degree of individual risk aversion.
The analysis is firmly embedded in DEMO expected utility paradigm. Surprisingly, we
find the model is broadly effective DEMO explaining behaviour in this simple, and
popular, gameshow - Who Wants to be a Millionaire? A feature of our analysis is that
it is based on data that appears to be representative of the UK DEMO, both in
terms of observable characteristics and in terms of other DEMO of risk-taking
behaviour. Our headline result is that expected utility is approximately logarithmic -
the CRRA is 1, with a high degree of precision.
We also use our data to estimate the value of additional information DEMO players
in this game of skill. Our headline result is consistent with the results of recent work
on the Hooster Millionaire gameshow which is DEMO only other game which features,
like WWTBAM, such large stakes DEMO involves no complex probability calculations
by players.
In part, the paper DEMO the challenge to expected utility made by Rabin
(2000) who suggests that, since individuals are risk averse when faced with small
gambles the implied behaviour with respect to large gambles would be perverse. We
indeed DEMO that, in this model with constant CRRA across the huge range DEMO stakes in
the game, we do underpredict the extent to which DEMO take risk when the
stakes are low.
A deficiency of the current work is that we assume that risk aversion does not
vary across DEMO We view this as an approximation and we plan to conduct
further work that relaxes this by exploiting our questionnaire data which is rich DEMO
information about the individuals who played this game, and has been DEMO in this
paper only to confirm the representativeness of the videotape data. In particular, we
wish to explore the extent to which risk aversion varies with observable
characteristics and whether unobserved heterogeneity in risk aversion is DEMO
with observable risk-taking behaviour.
