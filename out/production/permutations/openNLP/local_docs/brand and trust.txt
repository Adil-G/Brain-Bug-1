Development and Validation of a Brand Trust Scale
To enrich the limited DEMO recent work existing about relational phenomena in the
consumer-brand domain, the DEMO focus on the concept of Brand Trust. The non-
existence of a wider accepted measure of this concept is surprising due to the fact
DEMO: (1) trust is viewed as the cornerstone and one of DEMO most desired qualities in a
relationship and, (2) it is DEMO most important attribute any brand can own. In this
context, this DEMO reports the results of a multistep study to develop and validate a
multidimensional brand trust scale drawn from the conceptualizations of trust in
other DEMO fields. Multistep psychometric tests demonstrate that the new brand
trust scale is reliable and valid.

The ultimate goal of marketing is to generate an intense bond between DEMO
consumer and the brand, and the main ingredient of this bond DEMO trust (Hiscock 2001
p.1).
Despite increased attention and relevance drawn DEMO the relationship principles in
both theory and practice during the past decade, applications of the relationship
notion at the level of brand have been scant (Fournier 1998). The lack of theoretical
and empirical research on this subject is remarkable due to the fact that relationship
thinking guides DEMO brand management practices to leverage consumer-brand
bonds, especially due to the DEMO unpredictability and heightened competitive
pressures characterizing the current marketplace (Shocker, Srivastava, and Ruekert
1994). Furthermore, on a theoretical level the understanding DEMO consumer-brand
relationships is viewed to have critical importance to the development of marketing
and consumer behavior theories (Miller 1995), and it also has implications to other
relevant areas such as brand loyalty and brand equity.
DEMO idea that a relationship between the person and his/her possessions exists is
not novel (Blackston 1992). In this connection, consumer researchers DEMO
demonstrated that these relationships contribute to the consumers sense of self, DEMO
in turn they may mediate a persons social or identity relationships (DEMO, Belk 1988;
Belk, Wallendorf, and Sherry 1989; Wallendorf and Arnold 1988). Among the few
studies that are informative about consumer-object DEMO undoubtedly
Fourniers research (Fournier 1995, 1998; Fournier and Yao 1997) is a valuable
4
exception in this matter. On the basis of her research, Fournier describes the
relationship consumers have with brands as a multifaceted construct to capture DEMO
richness of the fabric from which brand relationships arise (Fournier 1998)DEMO As such,
what matters in the meaning and, in turn, the construction of consumer-brand bonds
include such aspects as commitment, intimacy, DEMO/passion, interdependence, self-
connection, and brand partner quality.
However, in our opinion, an important facet of this relationship is missing in her
framework. Whether, as suggested by Fournier, the relationship is in essence DEMO
the relationship means, understanding a consumer-brand relationship also requires an
analysis DEMO the consumers trust in the brand. This idea is well illustrated by the
realities of todays current brand management practices and how brand managers
DEMO this concept when defining their brands. For Bainbridge (1997), Kamp
(1999), Smith (2001), and Scott (2000) trust is the most important attribute any brand
can own. MacLeod (2000) considers that DEMO of the vocabulary of modern brand
building use words associated with personal relationship such as trust, and for
Blackston (1992) trust is one component of consumers relationships with brands.
Furthermore, the absence of brand trust in Fourniers (1998) framework calls our
attention despite it has emerged DEMO a key characteristic of a desirable relationship in a
variety of disciplines. Researchers from basic disciplines such as psychology and
sociology view trust as DEMO cornerstone and one of the most desired qualities in any
close relationship (e.g., Rempel, Holmes, and Zanna 1985; Rotter 1980) or DEMO an
5
integral feature of human relations (e.g., Larzelere and Huston 1980). DEMO more
applied areas like management and marketing, numerous authors suggest that DEMO is
an important element of relationships in business environment (e.g., Dwyer, Schurr,
and Oh 1987; Garbarino and Johnson 1999; Hess 1995; Morgan and Hunt 1994).
In summary, trust is an important DEMO affecting human relationships at all
levels (Rotter 1980). Therefore, whether concepts and theories from research on
interpersonal relationships are used to characterize DEMO evaluate consumer-brand
relationships, trust should be analyzed as another facet of DEMO bond between
consumers and brands. Unfortunately, no current scale exists to DEMO trust in a
brand setting.
In this paper, we develop and DEMO a scale to measure brand trust, which we
call the Brand DEMO Scale (BTS). Toward this end, we begin by examining the
concept of trust in studies conducted in different academic fields to understand DEMO
meaning and its main characteristics. Based on this literature review, a DEMO of
brand trust is proposed along with its relevant dimensions. We, DEMO, deal with the
generation of scale items, the research design, DEMO data collection, and the
methodology proposed to assess the psychometric characteristics DEMO the scale (i.e.,
internal consistency and validity). Finally, we discuss the results in terms of their
managerial practice, their limitations, DEMO directions for further research.

CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND
Theoretical Treatment of Trust in the Literature
Trust has received DEMO great deal of attention from scholars in several disciplines
such as psychology (e.g., Deutsch 1960; Larzelere and Huston 1980; Rempel et al.
DEMO; Rotter 1980), sociology (e.g., Lewis and Weigert 1985), DEMO economics (e.g.,
Dasgupta 1988), as well as in more DEMO areas like management (e.g., Barney and
Hausen 1994) and marketing (e.g., Andaleeb 1992; Dwyer et al. 1987; Morgan and
Hunt 1994). Although this multidisciplinary interest has added richness to the
construct, such a diversity of scholarship makes difficult to integrate the various
perspectives on DEMO and find a consensus on its nature. As pointed out by
Bhattacharya, Debinney, and Pillutla (1998), not only do different scholars address
trust concept from different approaches and methods, but they have expressed
inevitable differences of opinion over its nature. More specifically, Lewicki and
Bunker (DEMO) identify three different approaches on how trust is viewed. In contrast
DEMO personality psychologists view of trust as an individual characteristic (e.g., Rotter
1980), social psychologists consider trust as an expectation that is specific DEMO a
transaction and the person with whom one is transacting. Economists and
sociologists, on the other hand, are interested in how institutions and DEMO
reduce incertainty, and in turn increase trust, associated with transactions.
Nevertheless, a careful review of the extant literature makes apparent that most
perspectives on trust agree that confident expectations and risk are critical
7
components of a definition of trust. For example, Deutsch (1973) defines trust as
the confidence that one will find what is desired from DEMO, rather that what is
feared. Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) affirm that trust is the willingness of
a party to be vulnerable to the actions of the another party..., and Barney and
Hansen (DEMO) suggest that trust is the mutual confidence that no party to DEMO
exchange will exploit anothers vulnerability. Therefore, to make the attribution that
DEMO person is trustworthy, there must exist the possibility to show that DEMO or he
is trustworthy (Rempel et al. 1985).
In trusting DEMO the sources of risk are generally related to vulnerability
and/or uncertainty about an outcome. In particular, Blomqvist (1997) associated the
risk perception with a situation of imperfect information because in total ignorance it
is DEMO only to have faith and/or gamble, and under perfect information, there is
no trust but merely rational calculation. Then, uncertainty regarding whether the
other intends to and will act appropriately is the source of DEMO (Rousseau et al.
1998).
Consequently, trust is a psychological state interpreted in terms of perceived
probabilities (Bhattacharya et al. 1998), confidence (Barney and Hansen 1994;
Deutsch 1973; Garbarino and Johnson 1999) or expectancy (Rempel et al. 1985)
assigned to the occurrence of some positive outcomes on the part of the trusting
party. Accordingly, to trust someone implicitly means that there is a quite high
8
probability that this person will perform actions that will result in positive, or at least
non-negative, outcomes for his/her exchange or relational partner.
For the previous theoretical treatments of trust, it is seen that this generalized
expectancy or occurrence probability is based on the dispositional attributions made
DEMO the partner about his/her intentions, behaviors (verbal or nonverbal), and qualities.
In other words, trust is based on the notion that people attempt to understand their
partners in terms of acts, dispositions, DEMO motives that would predict positive
responses (Rempel et al. 1985).
DEMO to the discussion of what these attributions are, each base discipline
DEMO a different type. However, to the best of our knowledge, the different
nature of these attributions results in the distinction of two main DEMO in the
concept of trust, because some of them have a DEMO nature while a technical
or competence-based one characterizes others.
The studies conducted in the psychology area are mainly focused on the
motivational dimension of DEMO concept. This dimension is related to the attribution
that the exchange partners behavior (verbal or nonverbal) is guided or motivated by
favorable and DEMO intentions towards the welfare and interests of his/her partner
(Andaleeb DEMO). Therefore, it reflects the belief that ones partner does not DEMO the
intention to lie, to break promises, ot to take advantage of ones vulnerability. To
refer to this dimension a varied terminology has DEMO used. For instance, Frost,
Stimpson, and Maughan (1978) highlight the term altruism, Larzelere and Huston
9
(1980) propose two qualities of trust: benevolence and honesty, and DEMO et al.
(1985) use the words dependability and fairness.
Inspired by interpersonal research, most channel studies also describe trust in
terms of a set of motivational attributions because it is viewed as a mechanism to
DEMO the potential opportunism in a relationship (Geyskens, Steenkamp, and
Kumar DEMO; Geyskens et al. 1996; Morgan and Hunt 1994).
Nevertheless, DEMO studies in management and marketing literature distinguish
also in the concept a second group of attributions with a technical or competence
nature. The reasoning DEMO this idea is that, in the interactions taking place in
the DEMO field, a certain dependence on delivering expected outcomes and
performing activities DEMO Therefore, to assert that someone is trustworthy it is also
necessary DEMO know his/her capacity and abilities to perform these activities and
produce the desired outcomes (Andaleeb 1992). There are several researchers who
believe that it is appropriate to distinguish this second dimension in the concept DEMO
they use a variety of terms to refer to it. In the channel literature, Morgan and Hunt
(1994) use the term reliability, DEMO (1994), and Doney and Cannon (1997)
mention credibility, DEMO Andaleeb (1992) and Mayer et al. (1995) refer to this
dimension with the concept ability.
In summary, on one hand the motivational dimension of trust is the extent to
which one believes that its DEMO is interested in the ones welfare and interests. On
the other hand, the competence dimension focuses on the belief that the partner has
10
the required expertise to perform his/her activities, carry out his/her obligations or
accomplish his/her promises.
Defining Brand Trust
Drawing on the DEMO mentioned literature we define brand trust as: Feeling of
security held DEMO the consumer in his/her interaction with the brand, that it DEMO based
on the perceptions that the brand is reliable and responsible for the interests and
welfare of the consumer.
This definition is consistent with DEMO relevant components of prior research on
trust. First, brand trust involves DEMO willingness to put oneself at risk, be it through
reliance on DEMO promise of value that the brand represents. Second, it is defined DEMO
feelings of confidence and security. Third, brand trust involves a general DEMO
because it cannot exist without some possibility of being in error. Fourth, it is related
to positive or non-negative outcomes. Fifth, it requires DEMO make dispositional
attributions to the brand such that it is regarded as reliable, dependable, and so on.
In consonance with the literature review, our definition of brand trust also
incorporates all-important facets of trust that DEMO include in their
operationalization such as beliefs about fiability and intentionality.
The fiability dimension of brand trust has a technical nature because it concerns
DEMO perception that the brand can fulfill or satisfy consumers needs. It is related to
the individuals belief that the brand accomplishes its value promise. DEMO our opinion,
11
this dimension is essential for trusting in a brand because if we DEMO a brand as
the promise of a future performance (Deighton 1992), its fiability for the
accomplishment of that promise leads the consumer to trust in the occurrence of
future satisfaction. Underlying this dimension there is DEMO sense of predictability that
the brand satisfies the individualss needs in consistently positive ways. Therefore,
for all its value in conducting day-to-day exchanges, fiability is, at best, a starting
point for describing brand trust.
DEMO second dimension, intentionality, reflects an emotional security on the part
of individuals. It describes the aspect of a belief that goes beyond the DEMO
evidence to make individuals feel, with assurance, that the brand will be responsible
and caring despite the vicissitudes of future problematic situations and DEMO
with the consumption of the product. Convictions on this nature are thus held and
acted on in the present with the confident expectation that DEMO events will probe
them to be correct. Therefore, it is concerned DEMO the belief that the brand is not
going to take advantage of the consumers vulnerability.
The current marketplace provides us with illustrative examples of DEMO above
mentioned circumstances such as the consumer outrage at contaminated Coca-Cola
cans in some Western European countries (e.g., Belgium and France). Although
DEMO corporate response, the companys reaction in guaranteeing no health
problems for DEMO brand users, taking out of the market those problematic units of DEMO
product, and investigating the problem origin could be viewed as the DEMO of actions
12
included under the intentionality dimension. More recently, McDonalds has tried to
prevent its brand value and image from the mad cow disease affecting some DEMO
European countries with an informational campaign guaranteeing the origin and
quality of the meat of its hamburgers.
Far from being exceptional episodes in the DEMO relationship, Birch
(1994) and Patterson (1993) consider that the DEMO complexity of products,
more stringent product-safety legislation, and more demanding DEMO make
these situations frequent occurrences.
In short, both dimensions of brand DEMO reflect different perspectives from which
making subjective probability judgments for a brand to be considered trustworthy.
They arise out of different levels of cognitive DEMO emotional abstraction and allow us
to know what exactly a trustworthy brand is. Borrowing Bainbridges (1997) words:
A trustworthy brand places the DEMO at the center of it world and relies more on
understanding real consumer needs and fulfilling them than the particular service or
product. It DEMO not merely responsive, but responsible.
Taking into account that the meaning DEMO brand trust and its two dimensions have
been borrowed from both psychology and marketing fields, there are substantial
differences between our definition and the ones recently used by Chaudhuri and
Holbrook (2001), and Dawar and Pillutla (2000). First, their view of brand trust
focuses on DEMO perceived performance of the brand. For example, Chaudhuri and
Holbrook (2001) define it as the willingness of the average consumer to rely on the
13
ability of the brand to perform its stated function, and Dawar and Pillutla (2000)
describe brand trust in terms of reliability and dependability. Then, these verbal
definitions are close to the fiability dimension of our definition but the motivational
aspects associated with the concept are ignored. In DEMO opinion, the desire to make
the concept too precise, it may strangle the conceptual richness of the phenomenon.
As such, our definition is more generalizable and has pontentially richer modeling.
Second, in consonance with Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992),
Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001) DEMO the behavioral intention of
willingness into their definition. In our conceptualization of brand trust,
willingness is absent because, according to Morgan and Hunts (1994) arguments,
confidence that a consumer can rely on the DEMO indeed implies the behavioral
intention to rely. Therefore, willingness is redundant DEMO the definition. Furthermore,
most of researchers in different academic fields define trust as a feeling of security
and confidence, and this is the view adopted by us.
Finally, in both studies the authors, probably DEMO it was not the main purpose
of their research, do not DEMO a systematic approach as suggested by Churchill
(1979) for developing measures of construct guaranteeing their content validity and
psychometric characteristics.

OVERVIEW OF SCALE DEVELOPMENT
No research has been conducted to develop systematically DEMO reliable, valid, and
generalizable scale to measure brand trust. Consequently, DEMO objective of the present
research was to develop and test a general measure of this concept.
The development of the scale followed the process DEMO by Churchill
(1979), and Gerbing and Anderson (1988) for DEMO better measures of
marketing constructs. The process began with a careful literature review of prior
research on trust in different academic fields. Based on DEMO literature review, we
have proposed a definition of brand trust and DEMO distinction of two theoretical
dimensions in the concept (i.e., fiability and intentionality). In conjunction with the
literature review, in a second step a series of personal interviews were conducted
with six consumers with the DEMO of enriching the main ideas derived from the
literature review. Each interview lasted from 45 minutes to one hour and the
following topics were DEMO:
1. Each consumer was asked to give a definition or examples of what he/she
considers a trustworthy brand and what characteristics describe DEMO
2. Each consumer was questioned about what can be expected from a
trustworthy brand.
3. An attempt was also made to ascertain the content DEMO of the items
generated from the literature review.
15
As a result we generated a pool of 11 candidate scale items DEMO reflect the
dimensions of brand trust (see Appendix A). All DEMO were evaluated with a five-
point scale anchored at 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree, and two of
the items were negatively worded. Specifically, DEMO and six items were designed to
measure the fiability and intentionality dimensions respectively. In particular, the
intentionality items were referred to the brand intentions as perceived by the
individual when there is a problem with the DEMO with the product.
In a third step, a questionnaire was developed DEMO included (1) the 11-item
brand trust scale; (2) an DEMO satisfaction measure; (3) several items relating to
brand loyalty; and (4) demographic information such as gender, age, and education
level.
DEMO questionnarie was then administered to assess the dimensionality and
reliability of the present measure of brand trust. Measurement items remaining after
these analyses were DEMO to different types of validity (i.e., convergent,
discriminant, and DEMO).
Data Collection and Sample
Data were collected through telephone interviews by a market research firm from
a random sample composed of 293 consumers DEMO reported their personal
experience with a brand in a specific product category. Elimination of incomplete
data resulted in 221 useable surveys. Thirty-two percent of DEMO sample was men and
16
sixty-eight percent was women1 . The median age of these respondents was DEMO
years, and their median level of education was some college.
We DEMO as a stimuli one product category: deodorant. Three criteria guided
this DEMO First, the literature describes this product as an experience product,
DEMO is, a product that consumers must actually experience through consumption to
DEMO its quality and infer whether the brand accomplishes its value promise (DEMO
et al. 1993). Therefore, the uncertainty associated with the satisfaction DEMO the
consumption expectations makes important to look for a trustworthy brand as a
determinant-buying criterion. Second, the participants in the interview process
mentioned that, in general, a trustworthy brand is important when buying and
consuming DEMO hygiene products such as deodorant or shampoo. Third, it is a
DEMO that most people are familiar with, and therefore their experiences with DEMO
product and different brands enable them to provide reliable and valid responses to
the questionnaire.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND ANALYSES
For measurement analysis, we used conventional methods such as item-to-total
correlations and exploratory factor analysis (Churchill 1979), as well as the more
advanced approach of confirmatory factor analysis (Gerbing and Anderson 1988).
Regarding the threshold values of the different DEMO for assessing adequate

17
measurement properties, we followed the suggestions of Anderson and Gerbing
(1988), Bagozzi and Yi (1988), and Bollen (1989).
Exploratory Factor Analysis
We first conducted a series of exploratory factor analyses to examine DEMO the
brand trust items produce the proposed factors and whether the individual items load
on their appropriate factors as intended. Principal component analysis with DEMO varimax
rotation technique was conducted on all brand trust items and no restrictions were
placed on the number of components to be extracted. On DEMO basis of the eigenvalue
greater than 1 heuristic, three principal components DEMO extracted that account for
65.68% of the total variance. Nevertheless, a DEMO observation of the correlation
matrix for the 11 brand trust items suggested the non-convenience of two items to
the analysis due to their mediocre DEMO adequacy (MSA of 0.68 and 0.59). These
items are respectively DEMO [X] is not constant in satisfying my needs, and
Brand [X] DEMO no be willing in solving the problem I could have with the
product. These two items were next deleted, and a final principal component
analysis was performed on the remaining items.
In this second analysis, two principal components with an eigenvalue greater
than one were extracted, which explain 64.44% of the total variance. Both factors
matched those dimensions identified with DEMO literature review, and all their items
had loadings and MSA greater DEMO 0.7.
18
Reliability and Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The remaining nine items comprising the scale DEMO next examined more
rigorously to detect the dimensionality of the concept. For that purpose, a
measurement model was specified to have two factors (DEMO variables) and each
item was prescribed to be loaded on one DEMO latent variable according to the
factor structure indicated in the exploratory factor analyses. We used confirmatory
factor analysis and estimated the model through the DEMO 8.12 maximum
likelihood method (Jöreskog and Sörbom 1996).
The confirmatory DEMO analysis implied the reduction of the items pool to
improve the fit of the measurement model. A completely standardized solution
showed that the brand DEMO items were loaded highly on their corresponding factors.
Therefore, these analyses DEMO a two-factor model of brand trust, 8-items scale
comprised of four DEMO and four intentionality items (Figure 1). Table 1 reports
the DEMO sample of brand trust items, their loadings, t-values and the fit statistics.
Insert Figure 1 about here
Insert Table 1 about here
Overall DEMO estimates of the measurement model suggested that the
hypothesized factor structure reproduced the observed correlations within sampling
error, which thereby indicated a good fit between theory and data. More specifically,
for the model of Figure DEMO the chi-square test was statistically significant (χ2(19)=
19
47.24, p=.00033) but due to its problems related to sample size DEMO (Fornell
and Larcker 1981), other indexes are provided that indicated DEMO reasonable level of fit
of the model. For example, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) and Adjusted Goodness-of-
Fit Index (AGFI) were greater than 0.90; Comparative Goodness-of-Fit Indexes were
also greater than 0.90 in Normed Fit Index (NFI), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI),
Comparative Fit Index (DEMO) and Incremental Fit Index (IFI); Root Mean Square
Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was 0.082, and Standardized Root Mean Square
Residual (DEMO) was 0.040.
Regarding the nature of individual parameters and the internal DEMO of the
model, the loadings of the items to their corresponding DEMO were greater than
0.60, as suggested by Bagozzi and Yi (1988). In addition, the t-values for the
loadings ranged from 10.75 to 15.21, which indicated high significance of the
loadings.
Internal consistency estimates for the brand trust scale (BTS) is reported in Table
1. Composite DEMO, which is a LISREL-generated estimate of internal
consistency analogous to Cronbachs DEMO (Fornell and Larcker 1981), was higher
than the minimum recommended DEMO of 0.60, and in both dimensions of brand trust
it exceeded DEMO preferred level of 0.7 (Churchill 1979).
Other estimates of internal DEMO also were computed. First, average
variance extracted estimates, which assess the amount of variance captured by a
constructs measure in relation to variance DEMO to random measurement error, were
20
calculated. Fornell and Larcker (1981) suggest that a level of 0.50 DEMO greater supports
the consistency among the items in a scale. The estimates for both dimensions of
brand trust exceeded the advocated level. In addition, an examination of the
corrected item-to-total correlations revealed that they ranged from DEMO to 0.66 for
fiability items and from 0.58 to 0.71 for intentionality items.
Taken collectively, item loadings, composite reliability, variance extracted and
item-to-total correlations provided support for the reliability of the BTS.
Consequently, variation in brand trust scale scores can be attributed to the true score
of DEMO phenomenon that exerts a causal influence over all the items. However,
determining that a scale is reliable does not guarantee that the latent DEMO shared
by the items are, in fact, the variables of interest. The adequacy of a scale as a
measure of a specific construct DEMO an issue of validity (Devellis 1991).
Asessment of Validity
After DEMO internal psychometric properties of the brand trust measurement
instrument, we assessed DEMO validity of the scale to know whether brand trust items
measure the intended concept. Because validity is a matter of degree rather than a
DEMO of valid or not valid condition, three different types of validity DEMO
examined. The purpose of these analyses was to demonstrate the capacity of the BTS
for measuring unique dimensions of the concept (convergent and discriminant
21
validity) and that it is related to other consumer behavior phenomena as theoretically
suggested by the literature (construct validity).
Convergent Validity. For a convergent validity check of the BTS, we followed
Bagozzi and Yis (DEMO) suggestions that all items loaded on their hypothesized
dimensions, and the estimates were positive and significant. As Table 1 reports, all
items demonstrated adequate convergent validity. Their loading on the hypothesized
latent variable was significant DEMO p<0.01, and the parameter estimates were 10 to 20
times DEMO large as the standard errors (Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
Discriminant DEMO Evidence of discriminant validity among the dimensions of
brand trust was provided by three different procedures recommended in the literature
as follows:
(1) When a 95% confidence interval constructed around the correlation estimate
between two latent variables never includes value 1 (Anderson and Gerbing
1988).
(DEMO) When the hypothesized two-factor model of brand trust, as shown in Figure 1,
has a significant better fit to the data than DEMO alternative model in which the
correlation estimate between latent constructs is constrained to value 1
(Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
22
(3) When individual average variance extracted for each latent variable exceeds
DEMO squared correlation between both latent variables (Fornell and Larcker
1981).
DEMO results of all three tests are shown in Table 2 and provided strong evidence
that the distinction of two dimensions in the concept is DEMO First, the
correlation between the two dimensions of brand trust (Ф=0.31) was significantly less
than 1.
Second, the chi-square value for the DEMO two-factor model was
compared to the alternative model. There was a chi-square difference statistic
between both models of 90.34 (df=1, p<0.01). DEMO indicates that the hypothesized
two-factor model provided a better representation of the data than did the alternative
model.
Insert Table 2 about here
Finally, as a more rigorous test of discriminant validity, we compared the average
variance extracted with the squared correlations for both dimensions of brand trust.
DEMO the results provided good evidence of discriminant validity. The average
variance extracted was 0.62 and 0.61 for fiability and intentionality dimensions
respectively and both DEMO were higher than the square of the phi estimate
(0.0961).
DEMO
Construct Validity. This type of validity is directly concerned with the theoretical
DEMO of a construct to other constructs. It is the extent to which a measure
behaves the way that, according to the construct it purposes to measure, should
behave with regard to established measures of other constructs (Devellis 1991). In
this sense, for a check of the DEMO validity, we analyzed whether brand trust is
related, as predicted by theory, to satisfaction and brand loyalty.
Regarding its relationship with satisfaction, DEMO is considered that trust evolves from
past experience and prior interaction (DEMO 1993; Rempel et al. 1985). Other
authors also support this DEMO For example, Ravald and Grönross (1996) consider
that it develops DEMO experience, for Curran, Rosen, and Surprenant (1988) trust is
DEMO state of being that develops over time, and Garbarino and Johnson (1999) view
trust as a high order mental construct that summarize consumers knowledge and
experiences. Therefore, as an experience attribute, it is influenced DEMO the consumers
evaluation of any direct (e.g., trial, usage) and indirect contact (e.g., advertising,
word of mouth) with the brand (Keller 1993; Krishnan 1996). Among all of these
different contacts DEMO the brand, the consumption experience gains more relevance
and importance as DEMO source of trust. This is because according to Dywer et al. (DEMO)
and Krishnan (1996), it generates associations, thoughts and inferences that are more
self-relevant and held with more certainty. In this sense, it can be postulated that the
overall satisfaction, as a general evaluation of the consumption experience with a
brand, generates brand trust (Ganesan DEMO; Selnes 1998).
24
Concerning the relationship between loyalty and brand trust, Garbarino and
Johnson (DEMO), among other authors, highlight the importance of trust in developing
DEMO and favorable attitudes. Other authors, such as Larzelere and Huston (1980),
and Morgan and Hunt (1994) refer to its relevance as a central construct of any long-
term relationship. Therefore, in the consumer-brand domain it may be an important
contributor to the kind of emotional DEMO that leads to long-term loyalty
(Hess 1995). Consequently, in addition to the widely supported positive effect that
satisfaction has on brand loyalty (Anderson and Sullivan 1993; Bloemer and Kasper
1995; Cronin and Taylor DEMO), it seems reasonable to expect that the higher the
feeling of trust in a brand the more the consumer is committed to it.
DEMO the discussion above, a theoretical model describing the relationships
among brand DEMO, satisfaction and brand loyalty was specified.
On the basis of measures DEMO consumer satisfaction found in the literature (e.g.,
Anderson and Sullivan DEMO; Churchill and Suprenant 1982; Ganesh, Arnold, and
Reynolds 2000; DEMO 1980, 1993), we used a global measure of satisfaction by
DEMO of a single item: Overall, how satisfied are you with all your consumption
experience with the deodorant brand [X]?.
Regarding brand loyalty, early studies measured it on the basis of repeat
patronage. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Ganesh, Arnold, and Reynolds (2000),
researchers DEMO agree that operationalizing loyalty simply as repeat patronage
is too simplistic and does not capture the multidimensionality of the construct

(Bloemer and Kasper 1995; Dick and Basu 1994; Jacoby and Kyner 1973). In line
with this reasoning, recent measures of loyalty use multiple items including for
example price sensitivity, self-stated retention, and the DEMO of spreading
positive word of mouth (Beatty, Kahle, and Homer DEMO; Bloemer and Kasper 1995;
Dick and Basu 1994). Adapting DEMO measures, we used four related items to
operationalize the consumer loyalty DEMO that describe a generalized sense of
positive regard for, and attachment DEMO the brand (see Table 3).

DEMO correlations in Table 4 provide an initial test of the hypothesized
relationships. All of them are supported at the p< 0.01 level.

For a much stronger test, path analysis (LISREL DEMO) was used for testing the
model and the hypothesized relationhips as DEMO in Figure 2.
Insert Figure 2 about here
The structural model specified overall satisfaction with the brand as the
exogenous construct. The exogenous construct DEMO related to two endogenous
mediating constructs (i.e., dimensions of brand trust: fiability as η1, and
intentionality as η2 ) and these three DEMO were related to the last endogenous
construct, brand loyalty, as η3.
26
As diagrammed in Figure 2, the results indicated support (p<0.01) for 4 of 5
hypothesized paths of the model. Goodness-of-fit statistics, indicating the overall
acceptability of the structural model analyzed, were acceptable: χ2(DEMO)= 169.82
(p=0.00); GFI= 0.90; RMSEA= 0.091; RMSR= 0.046; AGFI= 0.84; CFI= 0.93;
NNFI= 0.91.
The hypothesized path from satisfaction to brand trust was supported.
Furthermore, satisfaction explained a substantial amount of the variance of both
dimensions of brand trust, as the squared multiple correlations (SMCs) reveal:
fiability= 0.61, and intentionality= 0.16. The fact that brand fiability, as perceived by
consumers, relies more heavily on DEMO than brand intentionality does is in
line with Rempel et al.s (DEMO) statements about how trust evolves. According to
their reasoning, the predictability of brand fiability is heavily related to the
consistency of its performance DEMO signaled by the overall satisfaction consumers have
with the brand. In comparison with this dimension of brand trust, brand intentionality
captures the essence of brand trust that is not securely rooted in past experience.
However, in suggesting that past experience (e.g., satisfaction with the brand) is not
an exact barometer of brand intentionality, it would be erroneous to imply that past
experience plays no role.
The results also suggested that brand DEMO has considerable influence on brand
loyalty explaining over half of its variance (SMS= 0.69).
27
In summary, as far as brand trust is positive related to satisfaction and brand
loyalty, which is in line with the theoretical assumptions, DEMO construct validity of
BTS is supported.
Relevance of Brand Trust in the Development of Brand Loyalty
After developing the BTS and proving its psychometric DEMO, a
remaining question of interest is to know the relevance of DEMO trust in the
development of brand loyalty. For that purpose, we DEMO different models of
brand loyalty. These models were sequentially compared to one another on the chi-
square test according to Anderson and Gerbings (1988) suggestions. Nevertheless,
other goodness of fit indexes are also provided.
Specifically, three nested models were estimated: (1) the original model as
DEMO in Figure 2; (2) a constrained model in which the DEMO of the
relationship among satisfaction and brand loyalty (γ31) is constrained to equal zero;
and (3) an alternative model in which DEMO parameters of the relationship among brand
trust and brand loyalty (β31 DEMO β32) are constrained to equal zero.
From a theoretical perspective, these models give alternative interpretations of
brand loyalty development because they differ in DEMO relative importance attributed to
brand trust when explaining the bond between consumers and brands.
On the one hand, in comparison with the original model, the constrained model
identifies brand trust as the primary precursor of brand loyalty in accordance with the
28
Commitment-Trust Theory (Morgan and Hunt 1994). This theory posits trust as a
key variable in the development of an enduring desire to maintain DEMO relationship. On
the other hand, the alternative model is in line DEMO the traditional literature because
it considers satisfaction as the key construct explaining brand loyalty. Consequently,
in this model brand trust is just a DEMO evaluation of the past experience with
the brand that does not have further effects on the commitment toward the brand.
The top portion of DEMO 5 presents the chi-square fit comparisons among the
three models. In a first step, the original model (see Figure 1) was compared to the
constrained model (i.e., with γ31 path equal to zero) and the differences in chi-square
fit between them were not significant. Even more, the constrained models values for
the RMR, RMSEA, and CFI are DEMO identical to those of the original model. In
this situation, the DEMO model is preferred because it is more parsimonious
than the original one. In other words, other things being equal, simpler models are
preferred DEMO complex ones.
Insert Table 5 about here
Next, we compared the DEMO model with the alternative model (i.e., with
β31 and β32 paths equal to zero). According to chi-square difference test the
constrained model DEMO a significantly better fit to the data than did the
alternative model (p< 0.01), and the constrained models fit indices were also DEMO
than the alternative models indices. Moreover, little, if any, more DEMO is
gained with the alternative model as suggested by PNFI values (DEMO for constrained
29
model and 0.71 for alternative model). Then, we note that to accomplish an
improvement in goodness of fit of 8.7% in RMR, 2.2% in RMSEA and 1% in CFI
only a 1% of parsimony is DEMO Therefore, the constrained model is the best
representation of the relationships DEMO satisfaction, brand trust, and brand loyalty.
The bottom portion of Table 5 presents the standardized path estimates for the
constrained model.
In sum, this result indicates that, the presence of brand trust in a model of brand
loyalty offers a better explanation of the bond existing between DEMO and
brands. Our findings not only give support to the idea of the key role played by brand
trust in a model of brand DEMO, but also broaden the list of factors explaining
consumer behavior. Therefore, not to control for the effect of brand trust could result
in DEMO excessive importance to satisfaction in developing a customer base
committed to the brand when, according to the Commitment-Trust Theory (Morgan
and Hunt 1994), trust is a variable closer to the enduring desire to maintain a
relationship in the long-term. As an example of this, Garbarino and Johnson (1999)
have demonstrated that satisfaction and trust play different roles in the prediction of
the future intentions for low and high relational customers.
DEMO
DISCUSSION
Trust has always been an important brand attribute, it is about consumer
believing ‘what I’m buying is what it promises to be’… In DEMO ways, brand trust is
the key to brand development… (Bainbridge 1997).
Despite tremendous interest drawn by trust concept from practitioners and
marketing DEMO, there has been little scholarly research that has explicitly
examined this DEMO in the consumer-brand domain.
Due to the non-existence of widely used and accepted measures of brand trust,
this research represents one of only DEMO few theoretical and empirical examinations of
this concept. More specifically, it DEMO sought to address this void by (1) developing a
multi-item measure of brand trust, (2) assessing its psychometric properties, and (3)
investigating its relational linkage with other theoretically related constructs such as
DEMO and brand loyalty.
Based on the literature review conducted, we have DEMO brand trust as
a feeling of security held by the consumer in his/her interaction with the brand, that
it is based on the perceptions that the brand, as a personified entity, is reliable and
DEMO for the interests and welfare of the consumer.
Regarding the psychometric characteristics of the scale, the empirical evidence
supports the internal consistency, and DEMO, discriminant and construct validity
of the brand trust scale.
31
More specifically, findings from this study give also empirical support for
several relationships suggested in the literature regarding brand trust. Brand trust was
positively DEMO to overall satisfaction, which is consistent wih those opinions
asserting that, as an experience attribute, brand trust is influenced by the consumer
evaluation of his/her consumption experience with the brand. In addition, a positive
relationship was found between brand trust and brand loyalty suggesting the
importance DEMO the former as a contributor to the consumer commitment toward the
brand. Furthermore, the results derived from the comparisons of different theoretical
models of brand loyalty, in which brand trust plays a different role when explaining
brand loyalty, highlight the centrality of brand trust as the main contributor to the
development of a bond between consumers and brands.
IMPLICATIONS OF DEMO TRUST FOR CONSUMER RESEARCH
In 1998 Fournier provided a framework for better understanding the relationships
consumers form with brands. Her intent of breathing new DEMO into brand
management gave opportunities for future research to refine and extent her task.
Toward this end, the present study develops and validates a brand trust scale, which
also gives answer to Chaudhuri and Holbrooks (DEMO) request for measures of this
concept.
Taken into account the different DEMO of Fourniers (1998) Brand Relationship
Quality Construct, this study contributes DEMO a deeper and richer understanding of the
32
notion Brand Partner Quality. This notion covers some aspects related to our
DEMO of brand trust, such as:
(1) the judgments of DEMO brands overall dependability, reliability, and
predictability
(2) a felt positive orientation of the brand toward the consumer (e.g., making
consumer feel DEMO for)
(3) faith that the brand will deliver what is desired, and
(4) security in the brands accountability for its actions.
In this sense, the concept of brand trust would be reflecting the quality of the
brand as a partner.
Although we have been highly DEMO in our study, because trust is not the only
relationship construct DEMO characterizes consumer-brand bonds, consumer research
into a number of important areas DEMO consumer behavior, such as brand loyalty and
brand equity, may be also benefited by this concept.
Brand Loyalty Implications
Trust is viewed as DEMO central variable to the development of brand loyalty (Fournier
1995; Garbarino and Johnson 1999; Morgan and Hunt 1994), due to the conceptual
connections of relationship aspects to the notion of loyalty itself (Fournier and Yao
1997; Sheth and Parvatiyar 1995).
33
Therefore, the development of a brand trust scale breathes new theoretical
perspectives into brand loyalty research because it would help to provide a wider
DEMO and explanation of this particular aspect of consumer behavior. As
pointed out by Garbarino and Johnson (1999), for decades one of the key global
constructs predicting consumer behavior has been overall satisfaction (Anderson and
Sullivan 1993; Bloemer and Kasper 1995; Cronin and Taylor 1992; LaBarbera and
Marzusky 1983; Oliver 1980). This variable has received the bulk of researchers
attention to the exclusion of other important constructs such as trust, which role in
guiding future intentions has become more relevant after the DEMO emphasis to
relational marketing.
Furthermore, due to the more frequent presence DEMO commitment in the studies of
brand loyalty, as an expression of DEMO successful relationship between the consumer
and the brand, the importance of DEMO trust is reinforced by the current relational
approach that characterizes both marketing theory and practice. This approach
enhances the relational connotations of trust and DEMO major proximity to the concept
of commitment when explaining future intentions of consumers (Morgan and Hunt
1994). For Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001) trust and commitment should also be
associated, because trust is important in relational exchanges and commitment is also
reserved for such valued relationships.
34
To that extent, the development of a brand trust scale marks the beginning of a
deeper analysis of the trust-commitment tandem in the brand DEMO domain
against the traditional satisfaction-buying intention paradigm.
Based on the previous discussion, future research is needed to develop a deeper
understanding of the relationship between brand trust and brand loyalty. In line with
the research of DEMO and Munuera (forthcoming) and Garbarino and Johnson
(1999), it DEMO be also interesting to know the different roles that satisfaction and
brand trust play in explaining brand loyalty depending on the different levels of
DEMO risk associated to the product. The fact that the condition for trust to arise
is one of perceived risk (Andaleeb 1992; Mayer et DEMO 1995; Rempel et al. 1985), the
individual would be more DEMO to look for a trustworthy brand as a determining
criterion of the purchasing decision when facing some degree of uncertainty in the
satisfaction of DEMO/her consumption expectations.
On a more general level, there is also DEMO for additional studies that identify and
analyze other antecedent variables affecting brand trust such as brand reputation or
shared values with the brand. Especially DEMO reputation could play an important
role in a model of brand trust because it can signal trust towards the brand among
those individuals who DEMO inexpert with the product category to infer which brand is
trustworthy or not.
35
Brand Equity Implications
Consistent with the widely held idea in the branding DEMO that brand equity
exists because the brand adds utility and value to the individuals decision and
consumption experience, trust is the essence of the value that the brand has for the
consumer. In Richards (1998) DEMO, a strong brand is a safe place for consumers
because it DEMO them to better visualize and understand the offer (Berry 2000),
and face up with the uncertainty and perceived risk associated with buying DEMO
consuming a product. This is also fairly well supported by Sheth and Parvatiyars
(1995) opinion. These authors assert that the logic in the DEMO of the brand is to
transmit trust to the market, especially DEMO the direct contacts between consumers
and companies are not possible. As such, the brand trust scale would make possible
for knowing and understanding the role of brand trust in the development of brand
equity. In this DEMO, it would be also interesting to analyze the role of brand DEMO in
the development of brand equity and its relationships network with the different
assets of brand equity identified by Aaker (1991) and Keller (1993).
Also, as suggested by Chaudhuri and Holbrooks (2001) findings, if brand trust
determines brand loyalty, which in turn influence such DEMO aspects of
brand equity as market-share and relative price, then brand DEMO might be considered
as another brand evaluation technique. Then, future studies DEMO needed to compare
and analyze the convergent validity of the brand trust scale with other measures of
brand value.
36
Finally, as any study further research is needed to replicate and extent our
findings. The fact that scales are established by conventions or agreements DEMO
scientists about a good scaling (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994, p. 24), future research
should test our BTS to establish its validity among DEMO populations and types of
products. This would confirm the validity of the concept used in this research and
help to refine its measurement due DEMO its relative newness.
Of further interest would be the analysis of whether the brand trust scale proposed
accomplishes with different kinds of invariance (e.g., configural, metric and scalar)
when it is used in different DEMO categories. In this sense, the configural
invariance of the proposed scale DEMO indicate whether the brand trust concept has the
same meaning in different product categories. The metric and scalar invariances of
the scale will allow DEMO to compare the mean levels of brand trust in different product
categories. This last aspect is especially important for those companies that have
extended DEMO brands to different types of product, because with this scale they DEMO
know in which product categories their brands are associated to higher or lower
levels of trust.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
Besides being theoretically insightful, our study has several managerial
implications. First, to enjoy the substantial competitive and economic advantages
provided by long term relationships with consumers, companies need to complement
37
their satisfaction programs with other activities focused on building brand trust. This
DEMO is in line with the insights derived from a number of studies of
consumers relationships with corporate brands (Blackston 1992). According to these
studies, there are two components in successful and positive relationships:
satisfaction with the brand and trust in the brand.
In this sense, as far as brand trust is a signal of relationship quality between
consumers DEMO brands, the BTS would contribute to the management of the
relationship DEMO develop toward brands, especially when a direct contact with
companies is DEMO possible.
Second, as Blackston (1992) points out, many corporations act as if only
producing good-quality products and services, which give the corporation a good
image for dependability and reliability, is sufficient to gain the consumers trust.
However, our results suggest that the adaptation of an inherent quality of
interpersonal relationships (e.g., trust) in the relationship between the brand and the
consumer implies that the brand possesses some characteristics that DEMO beyond its
consideration as a mere product. This idea is far from new because the perspective of
the brand as a person has already DEMO proposed by authors such as Aaker (1991),
Chernatony and McDonald (1998) and Fournier (1998), and qualitative researchers
working for advertising agencies and consulting firms (e.g., Blackston 1992).
Consequently, it represents the recognition that brand loyalty and brand equity
can be developed with DEMO management of some aspects that go beyond consumers
38
satisfaction with the functional performance of the product. Therefore, trust is also
acknowledging that the individual is more than just a sales statistic or DEMO client code.
It is also to care about consumers, especially when DEMO unexpected problems with
the product. This imply that companies have also to spend effort in creating and
communicating consumers the correct attitudes and behaviors DEMO their brands.
Furthermore, brand equity is viewed as a fragile asset DEMO it is based on
consumers beliefs which can be prone to shifts due to, among other factors,
unexpected circumstances and problems with the product (e.g., product-harm crises).
Then, as far as the increasing complexity of products, more stringent product-safety
legislation, and more demanding customers DEMO these circumstances occur more
frequent (Birch 1994; Patterson 1993), it is necessary to design mechanisms to
protect brand equity from these circumstances. DEMO such, the brand trust scale
developed in this research might be DEMO tool to manage brand equity because it
provides information related to how supportive and consumer-oriented is perceived
the brand.
Finally, the online marketing environment affects the way consumers view their
relationships with brands (Wendkos 2000), because the anonymity of the internet
makes branding more crucial (Salzman 2000). In this context, then, to add value to
the online DEMO experience and to build consumer loyalty brand trust is
everything, and DEMO brand trust scale would be a strategic tool to manage consumers
relationships with brands.
39
CONCLUSIONS
The construct of brand trust offers another way to account for DEMO
relationships not previously considered by the literature, and also offers new
DEMO on brand loyalty and brand equity research. In line of the scope and
importance of such issues, and the diverse and compelling evidence supporting the
role that brand trust may play in shedding light on these DEMO, the concept of brand
trust has something to offer for an DEMO of consumer behavior.
