An DEMO article' 'examined alternative approaches to the
problem of investment decision under uncertainty. It was shown
there that the various formulations differ essentially in DEMO
the objects of choice (commodities). Two such specifications were
reviewed DEMO detail: (1) The mean, variability approach-this re-
duces the assets or securities traded in the market to underlying
objects of choice in DEMO form of mean-return and variability-of-
return measures which, it is alleged, enter into investors' preference
functions.2 (2) The state-preference (or, more fully, time-state-
preference) approach -which resolves the assets or securities into
DEMO of dated contingent claims to income defined over the
set of all possible "states of the world."
The predecessor article showed that the more familiar mean,
variability formulation has never been completed so as DEMO constitute
an acceptable choice-theoretic structure. If mean-return and vari-
ability-of-return are to be regarded as commodities, the analysis
must go beyond the individual level of decision to show how the
relative "prices" for mean-return and DEMO are
determined in the market. There seem to be rather considerable
difficulties facing theorists who attempt to fulfill this program.4 In
contrast, the state-preference approach was demonstrated to be the

natural generalization of Fisher's theory of DEMO choice,5
into the domain of uncertainty. Where Fisher's objects of choice
are titles to consumption as of differing dates, the generalization
takes the fundamental commodities, underlying all market assets,
to be contingent time-state claims - titles to consumption for speci-
fied dates and states of DEMO world. While various assets may package
these underlying claims into more or less complex bundles, the "mar-
ket-clearing" or "conservation" equations determine prices for the
elementary time-state claims to which asset prices must conform.
DEMO idealizing assumptions, necessary for this formal theoretical
structure to hold, are in some respects akin to those of standard
theory in requiring a DEMO of precision of knowledge or belief as to
preferences and opportunities that is only very approximately true
of the real world. Thus, the theory that results contains uncertainty,
imperfect knowledge as to the state of DEMO world that will actually
obtain in the future, but does not DEMO the "vagueness" we
usually find psychologically associated with uncertainty.
The present article is devoted to an examination of some im-
plications and applications DEMO the time-state-preference approach,
that reveal its power by casting light upon a number of unresolved
controversies. These include: (1) the nature and extent of risk
aversion; (2) whether there is an optimal "DEMO mix" in
financing corporate undertakings (the Modigliani-Miller problem);
and (3) the "appropriate" rate of discount to employ in cost-benefit
calculations for government investments not subject to the market
test.
In the very DEMO illustration of time-state-preference, there
is one commodity ("corn"), only one possible current state (i.e., the
present is certain), and DEMO two possible and mutually exclusive
future states. The objects of choice then can be symbolized: co, cl,
clb - present titles to DEMO of, respectively, current or time-O
corn, corn at time-1 provided DEMO state a obtains, and corn at time-
1 provided that state DEMO obtains. Each individual has an endowment
of such claims, has preference DEMO ordering the combinations
he could possibly hold,6 and has certain opportunities for transform-
ing his endowed bundle into alternative combinations. The possible
transformations DEMO take the form of market trading ("financial
opportunities") or else of physical conversions ("productive oppor-

I. STATE DEMO, RISK AVERSION, AND THE
UTILITY-OF-INCOME FUNCTION
In this section we restrict ourselves to synchronous choice among
claims to consumption in alternative future states; i.e., we are isolat-
ing the problem of risky choice from the problem of time choice.
Under these circumstances the individual's situation may DEMO por-
trayed as in Figure I, which shows an indifference map DEMO financial

market opportunities DEMO be written W = POcO + P1aC1a + P1blb,
where PO, P1i, and Plb are the prices of the respective time-state

ment vector. The 45? "certainty line" connects combinations for
which
Cia = Cib.
The convexity of the indifference curves between the commodi-
ties cla and c1b, which corresponds to one concept of risk aversion,
may be justified by appeal to DEMO general principle of diminishing
marginal rate of substitution that holds for ordinary commodities.
A more convincing defense, perhaps, is the observation of "non-
specialization" that individuals almost universally prefer to hedge
against many contingencies rather than place all their bets on one.
It is of interest to DEMO this formulation to the Neumann-Morgen-
stern utility-of-income function v (cl) that permits use of the ex-
pected-utility theorem in rationalizing risky choice. It DEMO shown
in the predecessor article that a concave v (cl) function, as plotted
in Figure II ("diminishing marginal utility of consumption income")

ditions, if the probability ratio for the two states 7rb/7ra is equal to
the price ratio Plb/Pla, the individual's optimum must be on the
certainty line. This is DEMO consistent with the Friedman-Sav-
age formulation in terms of the Neumann-Morgenstern function,
which under the same conditions leads to the conclusions that a DEMO
gamble would not be accepted and that the individual would be will-
ing to insure at fair odds.8
However, one observes in the world instances of risk-preferring
behavior. Some gambles are accepted at fair, or even adverse odds.
We will be considering in this section alternative explanations for
DEMO phenomenon. First, however, it is necessary to clarify one point
on which error is often committed. Whether a particular contract
is a gamble DEMO, an arrangement moving the individual farther
from the 450 certainty line DEMO or a particular asset a risky one de-
pends not upon the terms of the contract
isolation but upon the individual's
tion. While DEMO stocks are often regarded as riskier than bonds,
their purchase may stabilize an overall portfolio with respect to
the hazard of inflation; i.e., may move an investor closer to the 450
line. Similarly, for DEMO individuals a futures contract may be very
risky, but for a DEMO the same contract is "insurance" rather than
a gamble. The hedger, of course, is someone who starts with a risky
endowment i.e., he has an unbalanced endowed state-distribution
of income - and a contract DEMO an offsettingly
bution of return serves to bring him nearer
The predecessor article also showed

tent with a certain amount of seeming risk DEMO the risk
preference being a kind of illusion due to looking only at the pecun-
iary income distribution. Still, this explanation hardly accounts for
what we observe at Las Vegas, though it may tell us why bachelors
commonly do not buy life insurance.9
A different explanation for the DEMO mixture of risk-avoid-
ing and risk-preferring behavior has been offered by Friedman and
Savage. They argue that in economic activities such as choices of
DEMO, business undertakings, and purchases of securities and
real property, people DEMO prefer both low-risk and high-risk
activities to moderate-risk activities. This is, DEMO, evidenced
by relatively low realized average return (after allowance for un-
successful as well as successful outcomes) on the former categories

low-income class (most particularly, as we DEMO noted, for the upper
end of the low-income segment) is to some extent verified by com-
mon observation: many poor people place long-shot bets, and many
purchase insurance to protect their modest sources of wealth. Ac-
tually, the data cited by Friedman-Savage4 indicate that poorer
people buy proportionately less insurance than other income groups;
furthermore, the fraction of families purchasing insurance seems to
rise smoothly with income. There is thus DEMO indication of a risk-
preferring middle segment. This evidence does not, DEMO, sup-
port their position as against the alternative hypothesis of general
DEMO aversion. The smaller purchases by poorer people may, perhaps,
be DEMO away as due to relatively heavier transactions costs on
smaller policies (DEMO to adverse "loading" of rates) or to pos-
session of DEMO insurable assets in proportion to income.
The behavior implied by the Friedman-Savage hypothesis for
the upper-income group seems somewhat strange. Do we really see
DEMO people failing to insure their major sources of wealth - or,
correspondingly, do we commonly observe them hazarding major
sums on short-odds bets? 6 A possible defense here would be to bring
in the asymmetrical income-tax treatment of gambling and casualty
gains and losses, and the favorable treatment of insurance reserves
-all of which combine to induce rich people DEMO insure more and to
gamble less than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it seems
doubtful whether conservative behavior in these respects was really
uncharacteristic of rich people even before the income tax.
But the DEMO failure of the Friedman-Savage model lies in its
implied behavior for the middle classes. This group, if they be-
haved as pictured, would DEMO plungers of an extreme sort. They
would stand ready, at any DEMO, to accept at fair odds a gamble
of such a scale DEMO to thrust them out of the convex segment and into
(depending DEMO the outcome) the poor-man or rich-man class. In
addition, as we have remarked, it is the individual at the upper end
4. Ibid., pp. 66 f.
5. Rich people would, on any risk-preference assumption, tend to self-
insure (to save the transactions cost) against hazards DEMO losses in-
volving only minor fractions of their wealth. Thus we would expect to see
them often foregoing the purchase of automobile collision insurance. DEMO the
Friedman-Savage assertion implies that they would omit insuring against
potentially great losses such as those associated with accident liability claims,
and physical DEMO or death of the main income-earner. Again their own
evidence does not support Friedman and Savage here.
6. Occasional racetrack betting on favorites, so long as the scale is minor,
means little here. The main DEMO of the Friedman-Savage assumption is that
the rich man is willing, DEMO fair odds, to accept a hazard that (if it eventuated)
would thrust him entirely out of the concave segment -out of the DEMO
class! This requires betting on a scale considered pathological in our culture
(see Dostoyevsky, The Gambler).
INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY 261
of the low-income segment who is most DEMO to take long-
shot bets, and the individual at the lower DEMO of the high-income
segment who is most inclined to take short-odds bets. Thus, the
model would have us believe, the solid risk-avoiders of DEMO society
are only the poorer poor, and the richer rich. Aside DEMO the no-
torious lack of direct confirmation of these assertions, it DEMO of interest
to note how they conflict with observed stability patterns of the var-
ious income classes. With behavior as postulated, the middle ranks
of incomes would be rapidly depopulated, the end result being a U-
shaped distribution piled up at the extremes. Needless to say, this is
not observed.
There is one important observation that should be considered
part DEMO the behavior that needs explaining in constructing a risk-
preference model (DEMO function): Gambling on a scale
at all likely to impoverish is rarely observed in middle- and upper-
income groups. One way to reconcile DEMO observation with the
Friedman-Savage model would be to shrink the middle convex seg-
ment to a narrow range.7 To do this is, however, DEMO lose the main
point of the Friedman-Savage argument, since then risk DEMO
would be the predominant behavior pattern after all.8 And the prob-
lem remains of combining the risk aversion necessary for observed
diversification of assets DEMO purchase of insurance with the existence
of at least a modest amount of gambling at all income levels.9
An easy way out of the DEMO lies in recognizing that many
people take pleasure in gambling per se (i.e., as a consumption
good). A modest amount of pleasure-oriented DEMO would then
not be inconsistent with risk aversion (a concave utility-of-income
DEMO) for serious wealth-oriented activities.' To make this dis-
tinction workable, DEMO, it must be possible to distinguish obser-
vationally between pleasure-oriented and DEMO gambling,
the latter being defined as a deliberate attempt to change wealth
7. At one point (op. cit., p. 92) Friedman and Savage do suggest that
relatively few individuals are in the middle segment.
DEMO Substantial numbers of individuals in the middle segment are neces-
sary to explain the alleged observation of preference for low-risk or high-risk
as against DEMO economic activities.
9. One possible way out would be to assert that the middle segment is
small and, in addition, slides up and DEMO as the individual's income level
changes-see H. Markowitz "The Utility DEMO Wealth," Journal of Political
Economy, LX (April 1952) -so DEMO he is always willing to undertake a small
amount of gambling from his present income level. As in the case of Ptolemy's
geocentric DEMO, when it becomes necessary to incorporate such ad hoc
"epicycles" DEMO save the phenomena, it is time for a new conception.
1. DEMO following may perhaps be an illuminating analogy. Men like to

status. Fortunately, the two motives for gambling are observably
distinct, because they imply radically different wagering procedures.
If gambling is wealth-oriented, it will take the form of hazarding
great sums (DEMO to one's endowment and hopes) on a
single turn of DEMO wheel or flip of a coin. Repetitive gambling at rela-
tively small stakes would be absurd: the law of large numbers
shrinks the variance of the overall outcome, whereas wealth-
oriented gamblers are trying to achieve large changes. While repeti-
tive small-stake gambling does not quite guarantee a DEMO result
near the mean, the likelihood of such outcomes is greatly DEMO;
in any case, the average time required to win the DEMO sum (or lose
the fortune hazarded) will be enormously extended. What we ob-
serve at Las Vegas is, of course, very much DEMO repetitive, small-
stake pattern. The combination of adverse odds and limited DEMO
assures a high probability that the final outcome for the gambler
will be a modest loss - the price paid for the pleasure of DEMO
All this is not to say that we never observe wealth-oriented gam-
bling, but rather that it is not a sufficiently important phenomenon
to dictate the main lines of our theory of risk.2
On our hypothesis, therefore, we expect to see risk aversion pre-
dominating in wealth-oriented activities at all income levels -
thus explaining purchase of insurance all along DEMO wealth scale. We
also expect to see a moderate amount of pleasure-oriented gambling,
again all along the wealth scale. Wealth-oriented gambling will not

DEMO among the poor.3 This is in sharp contrast with the view
of Friedman and Savage, whose theory indicates that wealth-
oriented gambling will be very significant, and concentrated among
2. Some wealth-oriented gambling is based on "hunches" or "inside in-
formation" that, if true, would DEMO the bet a lottery at favorable odds rather
than the adverse gamble it appears -to others! Of course, given the belief
in favorable odds, even a risk-avoider might gamble. There is also strictly
rational wealth-oriented gambling, as in the classic case of the embezzler who
plunges his remaining cash in the hope of being able to straighten out his ac-
DEMO prior to an audit. Here the dollar in hand that the gambler risks is
almost costless, as he cannot hope to salvage much of his illegal taking by
conservative behavior. A somewhat similar argument may partially DEMO
lower-class gambling: the floor on consumption provided by public-assistance
payments -where DEMO payments are liable to be withheld or reduced if the
would-be gambler conserved his assets-permits the individual to gamble
with dollars that do not DEMO represent sacrifices of consumption to him.
Finally, there is the gambling DEMO that would generally be regarded as
pathological; this would be associated DEMO subnormal or aberrant mental
conditions.
3. See footnote above concerning the effect of relief payments (con-
sumption floor) upon the propensity to gamble. DEMO, ill-informed believers

the middle classes. We, on the contrary, would expect to find the
middle classes to be the most insurance-minded. Insurance pur-
chases by the poor would be deterred by the substantially DEMO
transactions cost on the one hand, and the relief floor on DEMO other.
As for the rich, they are likely to possess a DEMO diversity of
assets as to make self-insurance feasible (this consideration being
DEMO somewhat by tax advantages where life insurance
is concerned).
Leaving the sphere of gambling versus insurance, the most
significant class of economic activity, in terms of implications for at-
titudes toward risk, is choice DEMO occupation. Except in the very
highest income brackets, this decision determines DEMO nature of the
major source of wealth. In addition, it is DEMO to insure or di-
versify against certain hazards associated with occupational choice,
such as cyclical unemployment and technological obsolescence.
Insurance is available against DEMO hazards but there will
typically be penalty rates to pay for life or disability insurance in
dangerous occupations. Consequently, on our hypothesis we would
expect to observe relatively low returns in occupations that are
highly secure DEMO teaching and civil service.
In hazardous occupations
such as business entrepreneurship, DEMO would expect higher
returns - even after allowing for injuries and failures. Unfor-
tunately, the evidence available is difficult to interpret

ing will illustrate one of the many problems of interpreting such data as

risky assets. The main problem is posed DEMO the overall swings of the
business cycle, which limit the variance-minimizing DEMO of diversi-
fication by imposing high correlation among security returns - and,
probably even more important, high correlation between overall
property income and overall wage or other personal income. Con-
sequently, and especially because of the intrinsically risky situa-
tion involved in occupational choice, the risk-aversion hypothesis
would predict relatively high average return on procyclical securi-
ties and relatively DEMO on stable or anticyclical securities. This is
borne out by the historically realized yields on equities (highly
procyclical in real terms).5 Comparison of the cyclically unstable
"industrial" equities with the more stable "utility" DEMO pro-
vides another confirmation.6
Thus, a combination of a risk-aversion hypothesis DEMO wealth-
oriented activities with recognition that, for many individuals,
repetitive DEMO gambling (i.e., gambling guaranteed not to
drastically transform the wealth level) is a pleasurable activity,
serves to explain the available evidence. In contrast, the attempt to
explain both insurance and gambling as reflecting a single utility-of-
income function of peculiar shape leads to contradictions in which
DEMO supposed risk-preferring group is first large and then small,
first a stable and then a disappearing element, etc. -and is in
conflict with more direct knowledge about the risk-seeking pro-

equals the present value of debt repayments plus (if the firm DEMO
productive opportunities that lead to an increase of wealth) the
present DEMO of any equity increment. This looks very much like
the Modigliani-Miller theorem. In fact, it is easy to extend this
result, via a DEMO analysis, to decisions under uncer-
tainty so as to validate the DEMO theorem. The ex-
tension is based on the premise that individuals and firms form a
closed system, so that all assets or claims must be held by, and
only by, individuals or firms. Furthermore, looking at the situation
ex post of the production decisions (i.e., after DEMO of funds
to investment), the social totals of each time-state class of assets
must then be constant. What this rules out are "external drains"
of which the most crucial are personal and corporate taxes. DEMO
ruptcy penalties, transactions and underwriting costs, etc., must
also be DEMO
Continuing to employ our simplifying assumption of only two
time-periods (times DEMO and 1), with only one present state but two
future states (a and b), we first develop equations for the firm's
capital input and the distribution of returns.
(1) -qo = do DEMO eo Capital input balance
Here qo is the total of corporate funds committed to investment at
time 0; do is the portion coming from borrowings, and eo the por-
tion from equity funds.9 (In the DEMO article we assumed
eo= 0, all-debt financing being possible under certainty.)DEMO
8. In their paper the assumption is made throughout that the expected
yield on equities exceeds the yield on riskless bonds; they associate the pre-
mium with "financial risk" due at least in part to DEMO of outcome (p. 271).
Modigliani and Miller claim that their DEMO do not depend upon any
assumption about individual risk preferences (p. DEMO); this statement is
correct on the level of the individual (DEMO can maximize asset value regard-
less of personal risk preferences), but on the market level the existence of a
premium reflects the need DEMO balance for compensation to induce bearing of
variability risk.
9. It is assumed that the firm does not consume and has null endow-
ment. DEMO all funds for investment must be obtained from outside, and also

(2) DEMO's financial distributions
qb= dlb + elb
Equations (2) say that all gross asset earnings, in either state, are
fully distributed and DEMO the only recipients are the debt and
equity owners. Here dia is the gross return to debtholders if state a
obtains; the other claims are defined correspondingly. If the debt
is riskless, dia = dib = do (1 + r*), where r* is the promised
interest rate on the bond. If the debt is risky so that in state DEMO, let
us say, dib < do (1 + r*) then elb= 0- since the debt is a senior
claim that must be DEMO first before equity receives any return.
We have here three types of future time-state claims: (physical)
asset claims (qla and qfb), debt claims (dia and dib) and equity
claims (eia and eib). Under the single-price law of markets, unit
claims to the same commodity must sell at the same price. Hence,
unless there are DEMO due to such features as tax status
(excluded by our assumption DEMO), the single price Pia must apply
to qia, dia, and eia -and correspondingly Plb is the price of qib,
dib, and e1b. Taking co as numeraire so that Po = 1, the prices for
the future claims can be written in the form Pia = DEMO/(1 + ria) and
Plb = 1/(1 + rib), where ria and rib are the "time-and-risk" dis-
count rates for contingent future incomes. There is a possible source
of confusion here: it might be thought that the equity claim elb
is "riskier" than DEMO debt claim dib, for example, and so should sell
at a lower price. But risk has already been taken account of in the
DEMO of dib and elb in the example given just above, if
DEMO b obtains so that dib is less than do (1 + DEMO), then the junior
claim elb = 0. Conditionally upon the occurrence of the specified
state, the various claims all become certainties.i
If we define present values of the firm, of the debt, and of DEMO
equity return in the natural way for this problem (ex post DEMO the in-
vestment decision),2 we obtain:

Here again there is a possible source of confusion, in that it might
make use of "internal" funds, we regard such funds as distributed to stock-
holders and returned to the firm for reinvestment.
1. DEMO and Miller describe an "arbitrage" process which has the
effect of enforcing this single-price law (pp. 69-71). While their argument has
been the subject of controversy, it seems unexceptionable under the provisos
of the model here discussed - in particular, under the assumption that the
several types of claim do not diverge in tax status.

Do as compared with Eo, given predominant risk aversion. But since
each form of security is only DEMO package of elementary claims to con-
tingent incomes, market equilibrium requires DEMO the value of the
package equal the sum of the values of the components.3
The Modigliani-Miller Theorem follows immediately from (2)
and (DEMO):
(4) Vo = Do+Eo.
Our formulation makes it possible DEMO observe that the proposition in
question is a special case of a Fisherian theorem. Financing opera-
tions (i.e., market conversions among claims to DEMO) take place
within a wealth constraint-they do not change wealth. In DEMO
familiar Fisherian analysis of choices involving time, the market
value of DEMO productive solution determines wealth; borrowing and
lending can then take place DEMO achieve a different distribution of
timed income claims, but all such DEMO leave wealth un-
changed. In the model considered here, the productive DEMO
determines wealth by the condition VO = X/pk; financing via DEMO
native debt-equity ratios then represent different possible ways of
distributing this wealth over time-state claims. But all the attain-
able distributions have the same DEMO
We may now examine further the significance of the "closed
system" or "no external drains" proviso stated earlier. Let us sup-
pose DEMO there is no corporate tax, but that equity claims are given
DEMO treatment with respect to the external drain of the
personal income tax on the system composed of the individuals and
firms.4 This factor, other things equal, would raise the price (lower
the discounting rate) of an equity claim relative to a debt claim
and also relative to DEMO claims assuming these latter have to be
financed by mixes of debt and equity. Then the single-price law,
for claims conditioned on a DEMO state, could not be applied, and
3. Consider the following analogy. Bread and butter are complements
for most people, and possibly substitutes for some careful calorie-watchers-
but, regardless, a package of bread and butter DEMO competitive equilibrium
must sell for the sum of the bread price and the butter price. Any divergence
could only be due to a possible DEMO of transactions cost, but such costs are
a form of "external drain" assumed away in our model. (The assumption of
competitive conditions DEMO rules out "tie-in sales" as a device for capitalizing
on monopoly power.)
4. The capital gains feature applies to both debt and DEMO securities,
though in practice equity benefits more. The unique advantage to equity is
the opportunity to reinvest via "retained earnings," escaping personal tax in
the process. (In our analysis, the "retention" is DEMO mere fiction- which is not
the whole story, of course.)

DEMO in the public sphere the rate employed for "comparable" in-
vestments in the private sphere. Thus, if a power project would in
the private sector be financed half from debt sources paying 4 per
cent (this being a riskless rate, let us say) and half from DEMO
sources requiring an expected return of 6 per cent, the government
DEMO rate for a comparable project should be the same 5 per
cent the private company must employ. Then the marginally de-
sirable project would, in either sector, yield 5 per cent in terms of

account, the marginally desirable DEMO in the private sphere must
have an expected yield around 8.5 per cent, and so the discount rate
for government investment should be correspondingly higher.) 8
preferences. This point of view can be defended as a way of compensating for
market bias due to private "myopia" or DEMO "selfishness," but it
raises issues beyond the scope of the DEMO criterion. For discus-
sions of this position see 0. Eckstein, "A Survey of the Theory of Public
Expenditure Criteria," my "Comment," and Eckstein's "Reply" in the National
Bureau of Economic Research DEMO, Public Finances: Needs, Sources, and

Failure to abide by this rule leads DEMO obviously inefficient results. If
the government, merely because it can finance DEMO by riskless
borrowing at, say 4 per cent, employed the latter rate in its cal-
culations, the marginally adopted project in the public sector
would yield on the average but 4 per cent while private DEMO
with higher expected yields were failing of adoption.
The opposing recommendation is based upon the contention
that the higher rates required to secure funds DEMO private invest-
ments (e.g., the 6 per cent equity yield in the illustration above)
are a reflection of risk aversion - and DEMO risk aversion is a private,
not a social cost. The possibility of pooling independent risks is
essential to this argument. A.T.&T. can DEMO more risks than can a
small local telephone company; it will DEMO, be able to finance
more cheaply and so to undertake projects DEMO a lower expected
yield than the small company can. The federal government can
pool risks far more effectively than A.T.&T., and so is as a practical
matter quite justified in treating the expected project yield DEMO if it
were riskless. Consequently, the 4 per cent riskless discount DEMO is
the relevant one for its calculations.9 (It should be noted, however,
that the conclusion of this argument only follows in a "second-best"
sense. For, granted the premises, it would clearly be DEMO efficient
for the government to borrow in order to subsidize the higher-
expected-yield private investments - a larger subsidy to the small
telephone company, a smaller one to A.T.&T. - rather than for the
purpose DEMO undertaking lower-yield public investments. Only if this
possibility is ruled out does it follow that lower-yielding govern-
ment investments should be undertaken.)
A DEMO numerical illustration will indicate the incorrectness
of the "pooling" argument within the time-state model developed
here. Suppose the society consists of J identically DEMO individuals
with identical tastes, and let the social endowment consist of DEMO
units of income (say, "corn") in time 0, 150J units in the time-state
la, and 50J units in time-state lb. Let the numeraire Po = 1. Sup-
pose, for arithmetical convenience, that DEMO state-probabilities ira =
7tb = 1/2, and that with this DEMO of consumption opportuni-
ties there is on the margin zero time preference with respect to
same, though in one case the divergence is only between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent and in the other DEMO between 4 and 8.5 per cent.
9. Many prominent theorists have repeated this argument. Among
recent examples are the discussions by P. A. Samuelson DEMO W. Vickrey at
the Principles of Efficiency session, Papers and Proceedings DEMO the 76th Annual
Meeting, American Economic Review, LIV (May 1964)DEMO See also, Robert M.

certainties: thus, the price of a DEMO of future certain income Pi = 1
(and the riskless discount DEMO r1 = 0 per cent) 1 where, of course,
P1 = PI. + Plb. Since by hypothesis there is risk aversion, it must
be the case that the overall value of the time-i endowment DEMO each
person - 150 (Pia) + 50 (Plb) - must be less than the value of
the average holding as a certainty, i.e., less than 100(Pi,) +lOO (Plb)
= 100. (If the prices Pl, and Plb were such that the average hold-
ing certain could be purchased within the endowment wealth
constraint, it would be, given risk aversion.) This requires that
Pa be less than DEMO/2. For concreteness, let Pla = .4, and hence Pib
- .6, thus determining the "impure" time-and-state discount rates
ri. = 150 per cent, and r1b = 66% per cent.
Now consider various investment opportunities, all of infinitesi-
mal scale so that we can hold the price relationships unchanged (the
opportunities are infinitesimal on the social scale, DEMO not necessarily
on the individual scale). It is immediately clear that, in terms of
efficiency, either a private or public project whose DEMO fall ex-
clusively in state la should have these returns discounted at the rate
of 150 per cent. To attempt to make a distinction DEMO public
and private here would be equivalent to charging different prices for
the same commodity - cl5. If the returns all fell in state DEMO, the dis-
count rate should be 663 per cent. For an DEMO yielding re-
turns equally in either state (i.e., an investment whose returns are
certain), the 0 per cent rate would be appropriate. DEMO a project
yielding in the ratio of 3 in state la to 1 in state lb (that is, in the
same proportions as DEMO private and social endowments) the appro-
priate discount (for application to the mathematical expectation of
returns) is approximately 11.1 per cent.3 The appropriate discount
rate would be much lower if, with the same mathematical expectation
of returns, the state-distribution were reversed so as to pay off more
heavily in the less well-endowed state lb (the rate to use would be
minus 9.1 per cent, on our assumptions). In every case, of course,
the "appropriate" discount rate is that which correctly distinguishes

3. This figure is derived as follows. Let x be DEMO scale of return per
dollar invested. We seek the averaged discount rate r* such that the present-
worth calculations in terms of r* and DEMO averaged returns lead to the same
result as the explicit calculation in terms of the state-distributed returns and
the corresponding rla and rlb. We DEMO r* I in the equation:
-1 + 3x/(I + DEMO) + x/(1 + r1b) =-1 + 2x/(1 + x*). With r = 150 per cent
and rib = 66% /3per cent the numerical result in th4 text is obtained.

other hand, if the dollar were returned in state lb the recommenda-
tion would indicate too DEMO a criterion, employing 100 per
cent instead of the correct 66% DEMO cent. The basic reason, of
course, is that the process of taking mathematical expectations con-
siders dollars equivalent when they appertain to equally DEMO
states - but as between two such states, the dollars in DEMO may be
much more highly-valued on the margin than in the other. In other
words, dollars in distinct time-states are different commodities
within the model considered here, and it is as incorrect to average
them as it would be to average shoes and apples.
We may now turn DEMO the "pooling" argument. Suppose it were
possible to pool two projects, one yielding a dollar in state la and
the other a dollar in state lb. Since the pooled return is thus riskless,
it DEMO seem plausible to employ the riskless rate 0 per cent for the
two, viewed in combination. But this is definitely incorrect. If the
two projects were necessarily tied together, then the recommended
procedure would be appropriate. But if they are really separable,

complications such as possible interactions between the DEMO). It
could easily happen that the combination, if forced upon DEMO as a
combination, might be desirable -but that it might be DEMO effi-
cient to adopt one component and not the other, if DEMO could separate
the two. In short, the device of pooling provides DEMO justification
in efficiency terms for adopting what is incrementally a bad project,
if in fact we can adopt the good one separately from DEMO bad.4
Even if the "pooling" argument is rejected, it could DEMO be
maintained that the discount rate on public projects ought "usually"DEMO
to be lower than those of private projects. All that is required to
support this view is that government projects be "usually" (in con-
trast with private projects) such that they pay off in less well-en-
dowed states. For example, a federal irrigation project pays off
disproportionately when there would otherwise be a drought. Of
course, some special argument is required to explain why private
initiative does not exploit such opportunities. DEMO if such oppor-
tunities are not privately exploited, then in fact DEMO "usual" private
investments would not be the comparable ones in the sense required
by the "risky-discount-rate" position.
It may seem surprising, however, that so little can be made of
"pooling" in view of the plausible arguments adduced in its favor-.
One can, in fact, DEMO a model in which the pooling argument
makes more sense, and DEMO will be instructive to compare that model
with ours above. The key is to distinguish between private "states"
and social "states." The idea here is related to a maxim often
(rather too sweepingly) DEMO in connection with life insurance
calculations: "We don't know who will die next year, but we do
know how many!" Similarly, the social total of endowments might
be constant (thus, there is DEMO only one social state, ignoring
distribution) and yet for each individual the endowment might be
uncertain.5 For concreteness, imagine the following situation. If
state a obtains, every odd-numbered individual has an endowment
of 50 and every even-numbered individual an endowment of 150; if
state b obtains the positions are reversed. Let us suppose, in order to
make the case as strong as possible, that the investments available
to even and odd classes of individuals will have returns nronor-
4. Precisely this error is DEMO in the so-called "basin account"
doctrine. This theory, put forward by proponents of certain large river basin
plans, maintains that benefit-cost evaluations of component projects should
be ignored so long as the overall plan DEMO a surplus of benefits over costs.
Federal legislation has adopted this doctrine for the gigantic Missouri Basin
Project. See Report of the President's DEMO Resources Policy Commission,
Vol. 2, Ten Rivers in America's DEMO (Washington, 1950), p. 250.

tionate to their respective endowment distributions. Then DEMO "even"
individuals will, on the basis of risk aversion, DEMO a bias against
the investments available to them, and the "odd" individuals
similarly against their investments - whereas, if pooled, the in-
vestments would tend to become certainties justifying no risk dis-
count.
Consider DEMO of the form requiring a time-0 input of $1,
and yielding a time-i return of $1.50 in an individual's better-en-
dowed and DEMO in his worse-endowed state, the states again assumed
equally probable. If DEMO subjective marginal value of a dollar in an
individual's better-endowed state is .4 and in his poorer-endowed
state is .6 (as before), then each individual would assign a present
worth of - $.10 to DEMO investment opportunity. But if an "odd"
and an "even" DEMO opportunity were pooled, the return
would be certain; at the riskless 0 per cent rate the combination
would have a zero present worth, and so be on the margin of de-
sirability. Here pooling does DEMO sneak in a bad project under the
mantle of a good one. Rather, two projects separately bad (in terms
of private calculations) may become a good project in terms of social
calculations I
A model DEMO this kind is what lies behind the usual "pooling"
argument DEMO the use of the riskless rate for evaluating gov-
ernment investments. The model diverges in two essential ways
from that presented earlier justifying the DEMO of the risky
rate. First is the assumption, already mentioned, that risk is private
rather than social - i.e., that there is only one state with respect to
social totals 6 but more than one DEMO in terms of possible individual
distributions within that total. Second, and DEMO is the really
critical point, is the assumption that markets are DEMO imperfect that it
is impossible for the individuals better-endowed in state a to trade
claims to income in that state against the claims to DEMO in state
b that other individuals would like to sell. In short, the single-price
law of markets must be violated.
Continuing our numerical example, the commodity cl. had a
subjective value equal to .4 for even-numbered individuals and .6
for odd-numbered individuals. If trade were permitted between the
DEMO classes, the two values would have to come into equality.
6. DEMO an unpublished paper, Kenneth Arrow has employed the somewhat
more general DEMO of multiple social states, but where the social in-
comes (endowments) for the several states are uncorrelated with the returns
from incremental investments in the private states. This also leads to the
result that private DEMO are (on the average) socially irrelevant, and so that
market DEMO of return reflecting private risk aversion should not influence the
government's discount rate.
INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY 275
Holding to the assumption that a riskless DEMO claim has unit
present value (PI. +Plb = 1), PI. DEMO Plb would then each have
to equal .5. Then strictly private calculations, without any pooling,
would show that the private investment opportunities of the ex-
ample were on the margin of desirability. The discount rate DEMO the
"comparable" private investments would be 0 per cent, so DEMO pro-
ponents of the so-called "risky discount rate" for evaluation of
public investment would be led by their analysis to the correct 0
DEMO cent rate in this case. In contrast, as we have seen, proponents
of the so-called "riskless rate" - while also correct in DEMO 0
per cent as the discount rate in this case - would be led into definite
error under conditions where private risks are reflective DEMO social
risks.
We may conclude, therefore, that the pooling argument rests
ultimately for support upon market imperfections that prevent
equivalent time-state claims from DEMO at a uniform price, thus
hindering the possibility of private movements DEMO from risky
(unbalanced with respect to state) endowments by trading. Such
imperfections may, of course, be very prevalent. One important
example concerns DEMO whose productiveness has a personal
element. Such an asset may be worth much in the hands of some
Mr. X, but little if traded to anyone else. It will, therefore, be
difficult to reduce the DEMO associated with holding such assets.7
Here is a case where, granted DEMO other conditions in our illustra-
tion above, the pooling argument would DEMO real force. But it is
clear that the argument is incorrect on the level of generality at
which it is usually propounded. If time-state DEMO can be regarded
as commodities traded in perfect markets, the prescription DEMO the
use of the so-called "risky rate" -the discount rate implicit in the
valuation of private projects with the same proportionate time-state
distribution DEMO returns has been shown to be generally correct.
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
To rationalize the process of investment decision under un-
certainty, and to explain the price relationships among risky assets,

both a Mr. X and a Mr. Y. from investing to improve their personal labor
capacities. Yet, the state-distributions of the returns from the two invest-
ments might in combination DEMO a certainty. This would suggest that
Mr. X and Mr. Y form a partnership, so that each has 50 per cent of the

per cent of the benefit of his personal efforts. This possibility would, there-

the very elementary principle of nonspecialization of choice -among
time-state DEMO, leads to the inference that in their wealth-oriented
decisions, and if asset prices represent fair odds, investors seek port-
folios with balanced state-distributions of income. In general,
however, they will not actually achieve perfect balance (zero a),
because the endowments and productive opportunities available DEMO
society are not symmetrically distributed over all the possible states.
(2) As to the unresolved question about the existence of an optimal
debt-equity DEMO for financing corporate investment, the state-
preference formulation leads directly to DEMO set of idealizing assump-
tions ("no external drains") under which all possible ratios are
equivalent in market value. Where the idealized conditions DEMO not
hold, there will in general be an optimal ratio. (3) With regard to
the appropriate discount rate for evaluating government invest-
ments, rather vaguely stated ideas concerning risk aversion as a

time-state preferences. It DEMO shown that the efficient discount rate,

ment often encountered, to the effect that "risk aversion is a private
cost and not a social cost," was shown to be DEMO unless two
restrictive conditions both hold: (a) Private risks exist, but these
do not represent social risks (as when the aggregate social endow-
ment is constant, but its distribution over the individuals varies with
state). (b) Markets are imperfect, so that the single-price law of
markets does not hold for contingent time-state-claims as com-
modities.
Going DEMO the ground covered by this article, there seem to be
considerable DEMO of an operational nature in more direct
empirical tests employing a state-preference formulation. The mean
and the variability of return embodied in a given DEMO of assets are
already only implicitly observable; when the assets are DEMO
instead as packages of claims to incomes in underlying hypothetical
states of the world, the fundamental choice-objects have an even
higher degree of invisibility. Assets ordinarily encountered in capital
markets, such as corporate bonds or equities, represent complex
aggregates of claims to income in an embarrassing multiplicity of
possible states of the world. Nevertheless, in some cases the inter-
pretation may be reasonably clear. Thus, the course of stock and
bond prices since 1929 has certainly reflected investors' changing
views of the probabilities of more and less prosperous states of the
world occurring. Here, as elsewhere, progress will depend upon the
discovery of strategic simplifications that reduce seemingly in-
tractable problems into at least partially manageable ones.8
