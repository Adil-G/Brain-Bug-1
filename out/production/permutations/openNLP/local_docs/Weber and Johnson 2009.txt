Abstract
A full range of psychological processes has been put into DEMO to explain
judgment and choice phenomena. Complementing work on attention,
information integration, and learning, decision research over the past
10 years has DEMO examined the effects of goals, mental representation,
and memory processes. DEMO addition to deliberative processes, automatic
processes have gotten closer attention, and the emotions revolution
has put affective processes on a footing equal to DEMO ones. Psy-
chological process models provide natural predictions about individual
differences and lifespan changes and integrate across judgment and deci-
sion making ( JDM) phenomena. “Mindful” JDM research leverages our
knowledge about psychological processes into causal DEMO for
important judgment and choice regularities, emphasizing the adaptive
use of DEMO abundance of processing alternatives. Such explanations sup-
plement and support existing mathematical descriptions of phenomena
such as loss aversion or hyperbolic discounting. Unlike such DEMO
tions, they also provide entry points for interventions designed to help
DEMO overcome judgments or choices considered undesirable.

INTRODUCTION
JDM: judgment and
decision making
Since its origins in the 1950s, DEMO and de-
cision making ( JDM) research has been dom-
inated DEMO mathematical functional relationship
models that were its point of departure in the
form of normative models. This focus on eco-
nomics and statistics may DEMO led JDM re-
search to underutilize the insights and meth-
ods of psychology. Aided by the recent arrival
54 Weber · Johnson
of neuroscience DEMO to complement
behavioral research, the ﬁeld has started to re-
alize, however, that the brain that decides how
to invest pension money and what car to buy
is the same brain that also learns to DEMO
and categorize sounds and faces, resolves per-
ceptual conﬂicts, acquires motor skills such as
those used in playing tennis, and remembers (or
DEMO to remember) episodic and semantic infor-
mation. In this review, we make a strong case
for the utility of this realization.
JDM reviews DEMO often structured by task
categories, with section headings such as “pref-
DEMO,” “beliefs,” and “decisions under risk
and uncertainty” (Payne et DEMO 1992), and “risky
choice,” “intertemporal choice,” and “social
decisions” (Loewenstein et al. 2007). In con-
trast, our review employs DEMO that might
be found in a cognitive psychology textbook.
It capitalizes on the 50 years of research on
cognitive and motivational processes that have
DEMO Simon’s (1957) depiction of human
decision makers as ﬁnite-capacity information
processors and decision satisﬁcers. Attentional
(in particular, perceptual) and learning pro-
cesses have a longer history of consideration,
with phenomena such as “diminishing DEMO
tivity of outcomes” or “reference point encod-
ing” for perception and the “illusion of validity”
for learning. Affective, memory, and predic-
tion processes DEMO only more recently emerged
as explanations of judgment and choice
phenomena.
We retain some task category distinctions
to organize speciﬁc content where appropriate.
Thus, we distinguish between preference and
inference. Preferences involve value judgments
and are DEMO subjective, such as deciding
how much to charge for an item DEMO eBay. Infer-
ences are about beliefs, such as the judged likeli-
DEMO that a political candidate will win the next
election, and typically DEMO objectively veriﬁ-
able answers. Although this distinction reﬂects
tradition, it may DEMO reﬂect psychological real-
ity. Preferences and inferences seem to draw on
the same cognitive processes.
Our ability to organize our review by psy-
chological DEMO is a sign of the growing

maturity of the ﬁeld. JDM DEMO no longer
simply generates a growing list of phenomena
that show deviations from the predictions of
normative models. Instead, it has been devel-
oping and testing hypotheses about the psycho-
logical processes that give rise to DEMO and
choices and about the mental representations
used by these processes. Although the number
of JDM articles in major social psychology jour-
nals remained DEMO over the past 10 years,
the number of JDM articles in major cognitive
psychology journals increased by 50% over that
period, reﬂecting the increased interest in inte-
grating judgment and choice phenomena with
the frameworks DEMO hot and cold cognition.
New tools have undoubtedly contributed to
this trend. This includes functional imaging and
other neural and physiological recordings, pro-
cess tracing tools (see sidebar Process Models
and Process Tracing), and, DEMO, mod-
eling tools such as mediation (Shrout & Bolger
2002) DEMO multilevel analysis (Gelman & Hill
2007). A focus on psychological DEMO
has guided the decomposition of JDM task
behavior into contributing cognitive processes
and their variation across groups (Busemeyer
& Diederich 2002, Stout et DEMO 2004, Wallsten
et al. 2005, Yechiam et al. 2005). An increased
focus on individual differences has been a no-
ticeable feature of DEMO decision research
over the past decade. Increased use of Web-
based experimentation (Birnbaum & Bahra
2007) allows access to respondents with much
broader DEMO representative variation on demo-
graphic and cognitive variables, with new in-
DEMO about individual, group, and life-span dif-
ferences on JDM tasks, DEMO that are discussed
in the second section of our review. More af-
fordable genotyping has led to examinations
of the heritability of economic traits DEMO trust
(Cesarini et al. 2007).
JDM research attracts public and DEMO at-
tention because it addresses real-world phe-
nomena, from myopic dietary DEMO to ex-
cessive stock market trading. Policy makers
have increasingly utilized JDM theory and re-
sults when designing or changing institutions
(Shaﬁr 2008), the topic of our last major sec-
PROCESS MODELS AND PROCESS TRACING
DEMO models in decision research attempted to explain changes
in judgments or decisions (the “output”) as a result of changes
in information considered (the “inputs”) using tools such as re-
gression and analysis of variance. This approach is problematic
because it considers only a subset of observable behavior DEMO be-
cause different models can predict one set of outputs from a given
set of inputs. Process models help because they consider more
variables DEMO add multiple constraints. By virtue of hypothesiz-
ing a series of psychological processes that precede a judgment
or choice, they make predictions about intermediate states of the
decision maker, between the start and end of the decision (“What
external information is sought out? What facts are recalled DEMO
memory?”). Process models also make predictions about the tem-
poral order of these states (“What will a decision maker think
about ﬁrst, second, etc.?”). Process data are the data used to DEMO
hypotheses about these intervening processes and intermediate
states. They include functional imaging and other measures of
localized brain activation, response times, verbal protocols, eye-
movement tracking, and other information-acquisition tools (see
www.mouselabweb.org).
tion. DEMO recognition that preferences are typ-
ically constructed rather than stored and re-
trieved (Lichtenstein & Slovic 2006) may be
psychology’s most successful export DEMO behav-
ioral economics and the policy community and
illustrates the utility of psychological process
explanations. We now know how, and increas-
ingly why, DEMO of choice options and
task guide attention, and how internal memory
DEMO external information search and option com-
parison affect choice in path-dependent ways.
This not only explains apparent inconsistencies
in choice, but also provides insights and recipes
for decision aiding and interventions, includ-
ing the design of decision environments that
nudge people to construct their preferences in
ways they DEMO not regret after the fact (Thaler
& Sunstein 2008).
Psychological DEMO explanations cast light
on areas obscured in the shadows of statistical
decision-process approaches. For example,
years of work with Egon Brunswik’s lens model,DEMO
which provided valuable insights into the

performance of human decision makers, may
have hidden the important distinction between
automatic and deliberative (controlled) DEMO
cesses and their properties (Schneider & Chein
2003). Process explanations DEMO serve an in-
tegrative function by explaining multiple phe-
nomena, providing DEMO organizing principle for
a ﬁeld criticized for being long on effects and
short on unifying explanations. Judgments and
choices typically engage multiple psychological
processes, from attention-guided encoding and
evaluation, to retrieval of task-relevant infor-
mation from memory or external sources, pre-
diction, response, and postdecision evaluation
of consequences and resulting updating. Dif-
ferent tasks involve these processes to differ-
DEMO degrees. For example, attention accounts
for a larger proportion of response DEMO in
decisions from description, where the decision
maker is explicitly provided DEMO all relevant
information in numeric or graphic form. In
contrast, memory DEMO learning will be more
important in decisions from experience, where
information DEMO outcomes and their likeli-
hood is acquired by trial and error sampling
of choice options over time (see Hertwig et al.
2004). Similarly, affective processes are more
important in dynamic decisions under uncer-
tainty, DEMO analytic evaluations play a larger
role in static risky decisions (Figner DEMO al. 2008).
The last comprehensive Annual Review
article on JDM was published more than
10 years ago (Mellers et al. 1998). Two reviews
since then have addressed special topics, namely
rationality (Shaﬁr & DEMO 2002) and un-
solved problems in decision research (Hastie
2001). Given this time span between JDM
articles, our review had to be extremely se-
lective. Our mandate, to review research on
cognitive processes in judgment and choice,
necessitated the omission of papers that de-
scribe DEMO phenomena without emphasizing
psychological process interpretations. We also
had to limit the scope of psychological pro-
cesses covered. With a few exceptions, we omit-
ted very basic perceptual processes (e.g., cate-
gorization) and processes that go beyond the
individual (e.g., group judgments and decisions;
56 DEMO · Johnson
interdependent, competitive, and strategic de-
cisions; advice giving; social judgments; infor-
mation aggregations; and prediction markets).
We were DEMO to go beyond judgment and
choice processes, not covering problem solv-
DEMO, reasoning, or positive psychology. The bur-
geoning ﬁeld of neuroeconomics recently re-
ceived its own review (Loewenstein et al. 2007).
When multiple papers could have been cited
for a given point, we restricted ourselves to
the most important, innovative, or comprehen-
sive examples, and omitted citations for classic
phenomena.
ATTENTION
Decision makers face a wealth of potentially DEMO
evant information in the external environment
and memory. Given the processing limitations
of Homo sapiens, selectivity is a central compo-
nent of goal-directed behavior. Selective atten-
tion operates at very basic levels of perceptual
identiﬁcation (Lachter et al. 2004). It also oper-
ates at higher cognitive levels, including the ini-
tial perception of the situation and assessment
of the DEMO at hand (framing, goal elicitation),
evidence accumulation (which can be external
or internal, and usually is a combination of the
two), and judgment or choice (determining cut-
offs or decision rules).
A focus on attention as a ﬁnite resource,
requiring selectivity, goes back to the begin-
nings of scientiﬁc psychology. William James
in 1890 DEMO attention a necessary con-
dition for subsequent memory, distinguished
between voluntary DEMO nonvoluntary atten-
tion, and suggested the use of eye move-
ments DEMO track attentional focus. More recently,
Daniel Kahneman (1973) summarized what was
known about attention during the postbehav-
iorist period when attention was DEMO as a “la-
bel for some of the internal mechanisms that
determine the signiﬁcance of stimuli” (p. 2).
Kahneman emphasized capacity limitations and
the selective aspect of attention and distin-
guished between two determinants, momentary
(voluntary) task intentions and more enduring
dispositions such as the (involuntary) orienting

response to novel stimuli. Herbert DEMO
(1978) identiﬁed conscious attention as a scarce
resource for decision makers in the year of his
Nobel prize; Kahneman’s Nobel lecture (2003)DEMO
reiterates that this scarce resource needs to be
allocated wisely and points to automatic (ori-
enting) processes and fast emotional reactions
as means DEMO that end.
Exogenous Inﬂuences
Orienting responses. Some features of the
environment attract attention because respond-
ing to them has survival value. Changes in the
DEMO, and especially the appearance of
novel stimuli, introduce the possibility of op-
portunity and/or threat. Constant exposure to
a stimulus leads to DEMO, i.e., reduced re-
sponding, as things not previously responded to
DEMO likely to be neither dangerous nor promis-
ing. On the other hand, a change in the environ-
ment results in dishabituation and an orienting
response (Posner & Rothbart 2007).
As a result of the orienting response to
changes in the environment, things that vary
automatically attract and maintain attention. A
siren that wails will attract attention longer than
a DEMO that operates at a constant frequency.
This has implications for a wide range of is-
sues, from research design to human factors
and institutional design, with salient continu-
ous changes in the level of key decision vari-
ables as a recipe for keeping people’s attention
on the task, a manipulation perfected by video
games. Arguments by Birnbaum (1983) about
DEMO consequences of within- versus between-
subject manipulations of base rates have re-
cently been revived in the context of quan-
tity (in)sensitivity in protected value tradeoffs.
Bartels & Medin (2007) reconcile conﬂicting
results by DEMO that between-subject designs
lead to quantity insensitivity (e.g., the same will-
ingness to pay to restore the pH level of one lake
or DEMO ten lakes) (Baron & Ritov 2004), whereas
within-subject designs, DEMO attract attention
to variation in quantity, show sensitivity to the
variable (Connolly & Reb 2003).
www.annualreviews.org
Task characteristics. In the same spirit DEMO in-
tegrating across apparently contradictory re-
search results, a range of DEMO tasks and con-
text characteristics have been examined for their
effect of guiding attention and thus decision
weight to different outcome dimensions. Vi-
olations DEMO procedure invariance are one of
the most vexing cases of deviation from nor-
mative models of preference. Selling prices
typically exceed buying prices by DEMO factor of
two, even when strategic misrepresentation is
eliminated, and discounting of future bene-
ﬁts is much steeper when people are asked
to DEMO rather than accelerate consumption
(Kahneman & Tversky 2000). Below, we re-
view information-recruitment mechanisms that
explain how the direction of an economic DEMO
actions (e.g., acquiring or giving up ownership;
switching from immediate to delayed consump-
tion or vice versa) can affect valuation. Relating
such valuation asymmetries to attentional pro-
cesses, Carmon & Ariely (2000) show that de-
cision makers focus their attention on the fore-
gone, i.e., the status quo and its characteristics
attract more attention and thus importance and
decision weight than do other choice options.
Judgment versus choice. It DEMO long been known
that judgment versus choice tasks can direct at-
tention to different characteristics of choice op-
tions, from preference reversal studies of risky
decisions in the 1970s to the theory of task-
contingent weighting DEMO multiattribute choice
(see Lichtenstein & Slovic 2006). Editing oper-
ations DEMO out common outcomes for choices
but cannot do so for judgments, DEMO result-
ing differences in attentional allocation and in-
formation use that translate into differences in
preference. Consumer purchases are typically
the result of choice DEMO among multiple alter-
natives, where alignable features receive greater
attention, whereas postpurchase consumer sat-
isfaction is the result of judging the product in
DEMO, where features that are easily evalu-
ated in an absolute sense DEMO greater atten-
tion (Hsee & Zhang 2004). Many task-detail-
induced DEMO in judgment and choice
can be explained by differences in attentional

focus, although the inconsistencies are not ex-
DEMO due to attentional mechanisms. Most
stable JDM phenomena such as preference
reversals are probably stable because they are
multiply determined.
Description of choice options. DEMO way in which
information about choice options is communi-
cated to decision makers inﬂuences preference
construction through selective attention, even
though variants may be informationally equiv-
alent. One of these ways is the order in which
DEMO are presented. Candidate name order
on ballots, for example, has been shown to in-
ﬂuence preference and voting sufﬁciently to de-
termine election DEMO (Krosnick et al. 2004).
Options encountered ﬁrst capture atten-
tion, leading to reference-dependent subse-
quent evaluations and comparisons (Kahneman
2003). In decisions from description, some out-
come dimension values (namely certainty on
DEMO probability dimension and immediacy on
the delay dimension) are given special DEMO,
i.e., extra attention and decision weight of a
more categorical DEMO continuous nature, as
captured by prospect theory’s (PT) decision
weight DEMO and Laibson’s (1997) beta-delta
model of time discounting. Weber & Chapman
(2005) show that certainty and immediacy
are connected, in that adding delay “undoes”
the special preference given to certainty, and
adding uncertainty removes the special prefer-
ence given to immediacy.
Process of knowledge provision. In DEMO from
description, attention is shared between out-
come and probability information, which are
both explicitly provided. In decisions from ex-
perience, the series of sequentially experienced
outcomes focuses attention on this dimension,
with more DEMO outcomes looming larger
(Weber et al. 2004). The emergent evidence
DEMO rare events get underweighted in decisions
from experience but overweighted in decisions
from description, as captured by PT, can be ex-
plained by DEMO in attentional focus dur-
ing information acquisition (Erev et al. 2008),
because attention directed by both external and
58 Weber · Johnson
DEMO factors has been shown to translate into
decision weight (Weber & DEMO 1997).
Endogenous Inﬂuences
In addition to external inﬂuences, the internal
DEMO of the decision maker guides attention.
Decision makers generally have more control
over their internal states, thus allowing for more
voluntary allocations of attention.
Goals. JDM research over the period of our re-
view has started DEMO interpret behavior in terms
of goals and plans rather than (or DEMO addition
to) utilities (Krantz & Kunreuther 2007). Sur-
vival and economic well-being dictate that ma-
terial goals play an important role in DEMO
plans and decisions. Material goals are respon-
sible for the effectiveness of ﬁnancial incentives
in shaping behavior. However, people harbor
many other goals, DEMO of which relate to non-
material dimensions of the choices made [e.g.,
being defensible (Lerner & Tetlock 1999)],
whereas others relate to the nature of the de-
cision process [e.g., wanting a procedurally just
process (Tyler 2005) or a process that feels right
(Higgins 2005)]. With multiple and often con-
ﬂicting goals in play, selective attention to dif-
ferent subsets of goals has been shown to in-
DEMO how a decision is made and what is
selected (Krantz & DEMO 2007). A range
of factors has been shown to situationally acti-
vate goals or chronically elevate their accessi-
bility, including cultural values of the decision
maker (Weber et al. 2005a), the content domain
of the decision, e.g., risky choices about course
grades versus stock investments (Rettinger &
Hastie 2001), and task characteristics such as re-
quired accountability (Tetlock 2002). Activated
goals determine whether the decision rules used
are deontological (“What is right?”) versus con-
sequentialist (“What has the best outcomes?”)
versus affective (“What feels right?”) (Bartels &
Medin 2007). Ariely et al. (2000) point to the
importance of goals in the context of choices
between different streams DEMO experience over
time. Similar to the discussion above about
quantity (in)DEMO in the context of

protected value tradeoffs, people are more or
less duration sensitive when evaluating expe-
riences over time as DEMO function of how their
attention is focused by how they report their
experiences and why.
Affect as spotlight. Emotions experienced by
the decision maker, in addition to the many
cognitive factors mentioned above, focus atten-
tion on features of the environment that mat-
ter for emotion-appropriate action tendencies.
DEMO perception focuses attention
on either upside opportunity or downside risk
(Chou DEMO al. 2007). Feelings of fear or worry
focus attention on the source of the apparent
threat and ready ﬂight responses (Loewenstein
et al. 2001). Feelings of anger focus attention
on information about motives and DEMO
ity and make decision makers eager to act and
punish. Sadness elicits a desire to change one’s
state, resulting in reduced selling and inﬂated
buying prices, whereas disgust triggers a desire
to purge or acquire less, with the opposite effect
on willingness to pay (Lerner et al. DEMO).
ENCODING AND EVALUATION
One clear ﬁnding from behavioral decision re-
search is that information is acquired by deci-
sion makers in ways not DEMO by normative
models. Goal-relevant and context-sensitive
encoding of information is one of the ways in
which people execute their task with minimal
effort and, perhaps, maximal satisfaction. One
important distinction to make is between in-
formation obtained from a search of external
sources (external search; e.g., when choosing
a cereal by studying product information in a
supermarket aisle) versus information retrieved
from memory (internal search; e.g., when re-
trieving options about which route to take on a
drive home). Most decisions DEMO both kinds
of search. The cereal choice probably involves
recalling how much the previously purchased
brand was enjoyed, and the choice of a route
home uses external retrieval cues and infor-
mation about trafﬁc congestion. The DEMO
tion matters, however, because the properties
of external search (reviewed DEMO this section) are
demonstrably different from the properties of
retrieval from DEMO (reviewed in the next
section on Memory Storage and Retrieval).
DEMO is Relative
Outcomes. The humorist Thurber was once
asked how he liked his new wife. His re-
sponse “Compared to what?” reﬂects one DEMO
prospect theory’s (Kahneman & Tversky 1979)
major insights, namely that evaluation is rela-
tive. This insight continues to gather support,
albeit DEMO more complex ways than formalized
by PT. Since neurons encode changes in stim-
ulation (rather than absolute levels), absolute
judgments on any dimension are much more
difﬁcult than relative judgments. The list of ref-
erence DEMO used in relative evaluation con-
tinues to grow and includes other observed or
counterfactual outcomes from the same or dif-
ferent choice alternatives, as well as expecta-
tions. For example, the range of options of-
fered as potential certainty equivalents has been
shown to affect people’s valuation of DEMO
(Stewart et al. 2003). One important area for
future research DEMO to understand better the se-
lection among reference points and how multi-
ple reference points might be used.
Most discussions of relative evaluation have
DEMO on the evaluation of a single outcome
by comparing it to a reference point, typically
by computing their difference in value. How-
ever, DEMO themselves may be in need
of relative evaluation. If asked how good his
$5000 salary increase was, Thurber probably
would have also asked, DEMO to what?”
Gonzalez-Vallejo’s (2002) proportional differ-
ence model is a stochastic model of choice that
answers this question. Differences in attribute
values DEMO two choice options are normalized by
dividing them by the best (DEMO positive) or worst
(for negative) possible outcome. These propor-
tional DEMO are then integrated across at-
tributes by a stochastic decision process, DEMO
lowing the model to account for a broader
range of choice patterns than other models
(Gonzalez-Vallejo et al. 2003). Normalization

options is introduced

outcomes is used as a

outcomes DEMO by their expected value (i.e.,
risk per unit of return), predicts people’s risky
choices and risky foraging of animals far better
than does the typical nonnormalized measures
of variability or risk (standard deviation or vari-
ance) employed in ﬁnance (Weber et al. 2004).
The DEMO of differences is a cen-
tral concern for relative evaluations. It lies at the
root of Ernst Weber’s 1834 basic law about the
psychophysical DEMO of just-noticeable differ-
ences, which captures the observation that de-
tectable DEMO in visual or auditory signal
intensity are proportional to the starting value,
i.e., need to be larger for larger starting values.
Furlong & Opfer (2008) provide provocative
evidence about the effect of outcome magnitude
DEMO the discriminability of differences. In their
studies of humans and orangutans in the pris-
oners’ dilemma game, changing the currency in
which the usual payoffs for defection or coop-
eration are issued (for humans, dollar DEMO
multiplied by 100 to produce outcomes in cents;
for orangutans, DEMO issued intact or cut into
tiny pieces) increases the rate of DEMO,
presumably because the difference in payoffs for
defection over cooperation is less discriminable
with the larger numeraires.
Probabilities. Traditionally, explicitly pro-
vided probability judgments of events were
thought to reﬂect either a frequentist evaluation
or DEMO expression of a degree of belief. How-
ever, more recent formulations DEMO posited
transformations of explicitly provided outcome
probabilities in choice into decision weights
that are a function of the amount of atten-
tion paid to DEMO different potential states of the
world, which is affected by more DEMO the states’
likelihood of occurrence. Events may attract
greater attention for perceptual and motiva-
tional reasons (Weber & Kirsner 1997). Thus,
small-probability events may be overweighted
by PT relative to their stated likelihood of
DEMO because decision makers’ attention
60 Weber · Johnson
is regressive. In other words, decision makers
pay more equal attention to all possible out-
comes than is warranted by their (typically un-
equal) probabilities, and decision makers linger
at extreme outcomes to assess best- and worse-
case scenarios. DEMO models of risky
choice have provided such a reinterpretation of
the way in which explicitly stated probabilities
are evaluated in choice. They also provide DEMO al-
ternative way to think about risk-averse or risk-
seeking behaviors. In cumulative PT (Tversky
& Kahneman 1992), the subjective weight given
to a given outcome no longer is simply a nonlin-
ear transformation of DEMO objective probability of
occurring, but also reﬂects the relative rank of
DEMO outcome in the distribution of possible out-
comes. Cumulative PT is only one way in which
the evaluation of outcome probabilities can de-
pend DEMO the position of the outcome in the con-
ﬁguration of outcomes (DEMO & Oden 1999).
More complex ways, such as those in DEMO
baum’s transfer of attention model (Birnbaum
2005), have been shown DEMO account for a broader
range of choice phenomena. These attentional
effects become even more important when
choice options contain more than two outcomes
or DEMO the gambles are mixed (Luce 2000,
Payne 2005).
Choice DEMO External Search
Heuristics for risky choice. Brandstatter¨
et al.’s (2006) priority heuristic (PH) tries to
account for many phenomena in risky choice
DEMO simpler ways than do models that involve
tradeoffs, such as PT. DEMO model is notewor-
thy for making not just choice predictions, but
DEMO predictions about response times and infor-
mation acquisition. The PH has been criticized
for its use of discrete measures of error (Rieger
& Wang 2008) and for making choice predic-
tions that are not observed (DEMO 2008).
Johnson et al. (2008) found that although some
implications of the PH were supported, the
critical test, namely that decision DEMO do
not integrate probabilities and payoffs, were
not borne out by DEMO measures. Despite
the mixed empirical support surrounding the

heuristic, the research exchange triggered by it
demonstrates that process predictions and their
tests can improve choice DEMO
Sampling and evaluation in external search.
If we believe that decision makers often attend
selectively to a subset of possible information,
it is DEMO to understand the properties of
such samples, the processes used to DEMO
them, and the consequences these samples have
on decisions.
A class DEMO what might be called middle-level
sampling models ambitiously attempts to de-
scribe a large set of empirical regularities or
stylized facts. Each model has DEMO own set of as-
sumptions about cognitive processes and rep-
resentations and thus makes predictions not
just for observed choices, but also for process
measures such as response times (Ratcliff et al.
2006). Although these models share a concern
with the accumulation of evidence via sampling,
DEMO emphasize different aspects of the decision
process.
Prototypical of a class of models that could
be characterized as stimulus sampling mod-
els are recent DEMO of Busemeyer &
Townsend’s (1993) decision ﬁeld theory (DFT)
to multiattribute choice (Roe et al. 2001) and
to models of DEMO judgments as well as choice
( Johnson & Busemeyer 2005). The key idea in
DFT is that attributes of choice alternatives are
repeatedly DEMO sampled and that evidence
accumulates over samples. This process of in-
formation retrieval, whether from the external
environment or from memory, is assumed DEMO be
independent of the evaluation of the object, i.e.,
is DEMO path dependent. When applied to choice,
DFT posits a race between options, with each
additional acquisition of evidence increasing or
decreasing the valuation for an option, ending
when the ﬁrst option exceeds a preset thresh-
old. In addition to having a closed-form mathe-
matical formulation, DFT can also be expressed
as a multilayer connectionist network and has
been applied DEMO explain context effects such as
the similarity, attraction, and compromise ef-
fects (Roe et al. 2001). By adding a set of po-
tential responses (in a comparison layer) to its
www.annualreviews.org
neural network DEMO, DFT can generate pre-
dictions for several preference reversals (Buse-
meyer & Diederich 2002). DFT (and its decom-
position) has also DEMO a useful framework
to analyze group differences on the Bechara
gambling task, as described below. Computa-
tional considerations have led to a modiﬁca-
tion of DFT that incorporates loss aversion
into the accumulation of evidence (Usher &
McClelland 2004), thus extending stimulus
sampling models to explain the endowment ef-
fect and other JDM phenomena attributed to
loss aversion.
Decision DEMO sampling (Stewart et al. 2006),
another mid-level model, is DEMO interesting at-
tempt to explain several stylized facts with two
simple mechanisms: (a) value is constructed by
simple ordinal comparisons between an object
at hand and consecutive repeated samples of
objects drawn from memory, and (b) the sam-
ples reﬂect the external ecological frequency
of objects. DEMO archival data, these two as-
sumptions are able to reproduce the DEMO value
and probability weighting function and a time-
discounting function that looks hyperbolic.
Decision by distortion. Stimulus sampling
models typically assume samples that are DEMO
biased reﬂections of the environment and are
path-independent. In contrast, two DEMO of
research suggest that choice involves a biased,
and path-dependent, DEMO of informa-
tion. Building on earlier ideas about con-
structed dominance by Montgomery and
Svenson in the 1980s, Holyoak & Simon (1999)
DEMO Russo and colleagues (2000) posit that
choices are speeded up and made with mini-
mal regret by distorting the value of options
to DEMO early-emerging favorites. The exis-
tence of an early favorite leads to subsequent
information being interpreted in a way that sup-
ports that favorite, bolstering its chances of be-
ing chosen (Simon et al. 2004), even for a single
option (Bond et al. 2007). Simply being listed as
the ﬁrst option can cause this distortion of val-
ues and DEMO in choice (Russo et al. 2008),
showing the inﬂuence of attentional focus on
subsequent evaluation and choice.

Inferences from External Search
In DEMO to mechanisms such as availability,
which posit that biases in inference result from
biased representations produced by recall, sev-
eral researchers have argued that such biases can
result from biased sampling of external infor-
mation, either as a function of how the informa-
tion is presented by DEMO environment or by bi-
ases in a search on the part of the decision maker
(Fiedler 2000). For example, the observer of DEMO
conversation, which provides a sampling of the
beliefs of the two DEMO parties, may get a
biased sample of what the participants believe
DEMO a range of Gricean conversational rules
apply restrictions (e.g., not repeating what was
just said). As a result, Fiedler argues, the DEMO
server may well conclude that the conversation
is more hostile than it really is. By arguing that
the observer is insensitive to the bias DEMO the ob-
served sample of beliefs, Fiedler (2000) moves
the DEMO of observed bias from the decision
maker’s memory (as in availability) to the en-
vironment, aided by the decision maker’s lack
of understanding the biased origin of the sam-
ple. Juslin et al. (2007) DEMO applied very similar
ideas to conﬁdence judgments.
Goal and Framing Effects
McKenzie & Nelson (2008) suggest that dif-
ferent semantic frames that might DEMO seen as
logically equivalent (e.g., a glass being half full
or half empty) linguistically transmit different
information because different frames elicit dif-
ferent semantic associates. Fischer et al. (1999)
similarly suggest that different response modes
have different goals and that evaluation dif-
fers to accommodate those DEMO For exam-
ple, prominent attributes receive more weight
in tasks whose DEMO is to differentiate among
options than in tasks whose goal is to equate
options.
MEMORY PROCESSES
Making decisions without recourse to relevant
prior memories DEMO a difﬁcult task and is a topic
62 Weber · Johnson
that has long fascinated writers and ﬁlmmakers.
Memory is necessary for our ability DEMO learn and
to draw on past experience to predict future de-
sires, events, or responses to outcomes. Yet the
connection between properties of DEMO and
judgment and choice has previously been un-
derexplored. During the past decade, memory
considerations have played a more prominent
role in explanations of JDM phenomena, at-
tempting to leverage what we know about mem-
ory to provide insight into the processes under-
lying known decision phenomena (Reyna et al.
2003, Schneider 2003), but this is still a rela-
tively underdeveloped area of behavioral deci-
sion research.
Memory Storage and Retrieval
DEMO accessibility and priming. Seeing a
stimulus results in a transient increase in ac-
cessibility of the representation of that stimu-
lus and related concepts, a phenomenon called
priming, with effects on subsequent mem-
ory access, DEMO, shorter reaction times and
greater likelihood of retrieval. Priming is widely
DEMO in social cognition, where primed atti-
tudes and values shape behavior. DEMO this
paradigm, Mandel & Johnson (2002) demon-
strated priming effects DEMO multiattribute choice.
In a consumer choice task, their selective prim-
ing DEMO product attributes with appropriate wall-
paper on the initial page of an online shop
affected not only choice but also information
search and use.
DEMO is reactive. Unlike computer mem-
ory, human memory is changed by DEMO
at retrieval. Accessing memory both increases
short-term accessibility and changes the long-
term content of memory.
Short-term effects. Studies of anchoring suggest
that priming DEMO accessibility, and conse-
quently preference, can be changed by asking a
prior question, even if the answer to this ques-
tion should be irrelevant to subsequent tasks,
such as using the last four digits DEMO a social secu-
rity number as an anchor for pricing a gamble

(Chapman & Johnson 1999). This effect was
replicated with ﬁne wine by Ariely et al. (2003),
who also show that such accessibility-mediated
anchoring effects are strong and robust and
persist in the presence of signiﬁcant accuracy
incentives, experience, DEMO market feedback.
The selective accessibility model provides sim-
ilar mechanisms and provides evidence that an-
chors make some information more accessi-
ble as measured DEMO reaction times (Mussweiler
& Strack 2001), though accessibility may not
DEMO sufﬁcient to explain all anchoring effects
(Epley & Gilovich 2001).
DEMO effects. Accessing information about
possible choice options not only generates
short-term changes in the accessibility of re-
lated information but also changes memory in
DEMO more permanent fashion, a phenomenon long
recognized in social cognition. In DEMO context
of consumer choice and a line of research that
goes back to the work on the self-correcting na-
ture of errors of prediction, measuring the long-
term effects of purchase intentions on memory
has been DEMO to change subsequent purchases
(Chandon et al. 2004).
Retrieval and DEMO construction. A
recent perspective on preference construction,
query theory (QT; Johnson et al. 2007), sug-
gests that decision makers consult their DEMO
ory (or external sources) with queries about the
choice alternatives, DEMO particular their merits or
liabilities. QT assumes that most tasks suggest
a natural way to the order in which queries
are posed. When one DEMO of components of
a memory structure is queried, the accessibil-
ity DEMO other components that could be response
competitors is temporarily suppressed to mini-
mize intrusions, but with consequences for the
success of subsequent queries for which these
components are legitimate responses. Memory
inhibition as the result of DEMO recall of re-
lated and competing material is one of the old-
est and most developed memory phenomena
(Anderson & Neely 1996). Johnson et al. (2007)
show that QT accounts for the endowment
effect, under the assumption that sellers and
buyers have different query orders, DEMO they
demonstrate the causal involvement of query
order and memory inhibition by making the en-
dowment effect disappear by switching the nat-
ural order DEMO queries. Extending this paradigm,
Weber et al. (2007) show that queries about
reasons supporting immediate versus delayed
consumption are issued in reverse DEMO for in-
tertemporal decisions about accelerating or de-
laying consumption, explaining DEMO well-known
result that people are much more impatient
when delaying than when accelerating con-
sumption. Explicitly prompting queries in the
order opposite to the DEMO occurring one
again eliminates the effect. The task- and goal-
speciﬁc distortions in balance of support that is
generated by QT-predicted and empirically ob-
DEMO memory retrieval interference presum-
ably have the same function (i.e., faster deci-
sions with less postdecision regret) in decisions
based on internal search that predecisional dis-
tortions (discussed in the previous section) have
in DEMO based on external search. Both pre-
decisional distortion of external information
and QT-related biased memory retrieval sug-
gest that the process of preference or DEMO
ence construction is characterized by systematic
path dependency, contrary to the DEMO
of most mathematical models of judgment and
choice.
Consistent with a memory interference ac-
count, Danner et al. (2007) show that three or
more retrievals of a speciﬁc means towards a
goal will succeed in DEMO competing means
for the same goal. It is worth noting that this
“discovery” in social cognition in the context
of habit formation and goals-means DEMO
coincides with experimental practice in proac-
tive interference studies (e.g., Dougherty &
Sprenger 2006). Thus, memory retrieval is one
more way DEMO which goals have been tied more
closely to decision making over the past decade.

s(A)/(s(A) + s(B). Support theory is a rational
model in the sense DEMO it assumes that set B
includes only relevant alternative hypotheses,
i.e., hypotheses that have some probability of
occurring. Since competing hypotheses are of-
ten generated by associative memory processes
from long-term memory (Dougherty & Hunter
2003), irrelevant alternative hypotheses (that
have no possibility of occurring in the context
of interest) may well be generated and may af-
fect probability judgments by occupying valu-
able slots in limited-capacity working memory
[referred DEMO as inhibition failure by Dougherty
& Sprenger (2006)]. Irrelevant alternatives DEMO
working memory may not be identiﬁed as ir-
relevant, referred to DEMO discrimination failure
by Dougherty & Sprenger (2006), who provide
evidence DEMO such failures using a proactive in-
terference paradigm. A negative correlation ex-
ists between individual differences in working-
memory capacity and degree of subadditivity DEMO
probability judgments. The judged probability
of a focal event (e.g., rain) is larger when com-
pared to the implicit disjunction (not rain) than
when it is compared to the explicit disjunctions
(e.g., sunshine, snow, cloudy, all other), suggest-
ing that people with greater DEMO
capacity are able to include more alternative hy-
potheses in the implicit disjunction condition
(Dougherty & Hunter 2003). In combination,
these and related studies suggest that augmen-
tation of support theory with realistic assump-
DEMO about the retrieval and evaluation of al-
ternative hypotheses can signiﬁcantly increase
its predictive accuracy. Dougherty & Sprenger
(2006) also illustrate how measures DEMO individual
differences can help distinguish among hypoth-
esized judgmental processes.
Memory-based heuristics for inference. In
1996, Gigerenzer and Goldstein suggested the
take-the-best (TTB) strategy as both an accu-
rate and easy procedure for inferences based DEMO
memory retrieval. TTB mimics what is known
64 Weber · Johnson
as a lexicographic decision rule in choice, sug-
gesting that good inferences can be made by us-
ing the most diagnostic cue(s) that distinguish
between two alternatives. Knowledge about cue
diagnosticity depends, of course, on DEMO
tive insight about past inferential accuracy. Ini-
tial simulations showed surprising levels of per-
formance for a process that uses such limited
information. TTB DEMO particularly well
when the distribution of cue validities is highly
skewed. However, TTB is not the only heuristic
that does well. Simulations show that heuris-
tics that are even simpler than TTB can do
quite well DEMO the same environments (Hogarth
& Karelaia 2007). Other simple heuristics DEMO as
well or better (Chater et al. 2003) in other envi-
ronments. Examinations of TTB as a descrip-
tive model of memory-based inference DEMO
that it is not universally used, but also not in-
frequently DEMO, describing between 20%
and 72% of inferences (Broder & Gaissmaier
2007). More importantly, use of the strategy ap-
pears to vary in a way that is adaptive given the
environment, with more-intelligent decisions
makers being more adaptive (Broder 2003).
New developments are models that integrate
TTB and full information use along a contin-
uum, speciﬁed by the amount of weight given
to the comparison of different attributes (Lee &DEMO
Cummins 2004), and generalizations that relax
the assumption that decision makers know the
exact cue weights (Bergert & Nosofsky 2007).
A similar story surrounds the recognition
heuristic (RH), posited as a powerful rule for
inference in cases in which only one of two
provided comparison DEMO is recognized,
and applied in tasks such as deciding which of
two cities is larger (Goldstein & Gigerenzer
2002). Initial demonstrations showed good per-
formance over a wide range of domains, but
subsequent studies have delineated boundary
conditions. In a paradigm that teases apart
recognition and DEMO validity, Newell & Shanks
(2004) show that RH is abandoned DEMO recog-
nition is not the most reliable cue. Similarly,
the recognition heuristic is not used when
recognition can be attributed to other causes
(Oppenheimer 2003). Although it is clear that

recognition can be a useful DEMO in inference, the
debate now seems to be whether recognition is
DEMO used as a ﬁrst stage in inference (Pachur
& Hertwig 2006) or whether recognition is sim-
ply one cue in inference that can DEMO integrated
(Richter & Spath 2006) but has no special sta-
tus. In choice, recent work on decision modes
(Weber et al. 2005a) identiﬁes recognition as
a decision mode that uses identiﬁcation of a
choice DEMO as a member of a class of situ-
ations for which a prescribed best action exists,
following in the tradition of image theory DEMO
Lee Beach and work by James March in the
early 1990s.
Work in inference seems to be reaching a
conclusion similar to that of DEMO work in
choice by Payne and colleagues (1992). The
number DEMO processes in the adaptive toolbox is
large, and their use is DEMO to task character-
istics. The interesting questions are how pro-
cessing strategies are selected and when they
succeed and fail. Answers to these questions
DEMO come from explicit models of strategy selec-
tion (Rieskamp & Otto DEMO) and more formal
and detailed models of the role of memory DEMO
forgetting in inference (Dougherty et al. 1999,
Schooler & Hertwig DEMO).
MULTIPLE INFORMATION
PROCESSES
Normative JDM models have an appealing sim-
plicity. With an axiomatic foundation, they em-
ploy a small number of primitives, abstract from
content and context, and give rise to consistent
judgments DEMO decisions across situations. Ini-
tial attempts to make these models psycholog-
ically plausible and better able to describe ob-
served judgment and choice patterns DEMO
with the cognitive revolution in psychology that
used the digital computer as its metaphor for
human information processing and contrasted
algorithmic with heuristic solutions. DEMO
tive model modiﬁcations thus focused on
cognitive shortcuts taken by limited-capacity
information processors. This repertoire of al-
ternative cognitive strategies was ﬁrst investi-
gated DEMO the context of preference by Payne
et al. (1992) and subsequently extended to in-
ference tasks (Goldstein & Gigerenzer 2002).
In the context of preference, affective processes
have recently been added to the list of poten-
tially adaptive strategies (Finucane et al. 2000,
Luce et al. 2000).
The Emotions Revolution
Though successful in many ways, the cognitive
revolution may have been too focused on an-
alytic and computational DEMO The emo-
tions revolution of the past decade or so has
tried to correct this overemphasis by docu-
menting the prevalence of affective processes,DEMO
depicting them as automatic and essentially
effort-free inputs that orient and motivate adap-
tive behavior. Review articles that describe the
role of emotions in DEMO choice and their
effort-reducing potential (Finucane et al. 2000,
Loewenstein DEMO al. 2001) incorporate prior work
on emotional priming by Johnson and DEMO
in 1983 and on psychological risk dimensions
(Slovic 1999). Following DEMO et al. (2006a),
we describe research on four functions of af-
fect: as spotlight (discussed under Attention),
information, common DEMO, and motivator.
Affective Processes
Affect as information. Emotions experienced
while making DEMO decision are incorporated as in-
formation into choices (Schwarz 2002). DEMO
and negative past associations with available
choice outcomes thus contribute to new
decisions. Loewenstein et al. (2001) distinguish
between immediate emotions and anticipated/DEMO
expected emotions. Immediate emotions,
aroused either by task-relevant characteristics
or incidentally, and their effect on judgment
and choice are the topics of this section.
Choice-option–elicited immediate emo-
tions are at the base of traditional economic
DEMO of utility as emotional carri-
ers of value. Positive emotions increase value
and result in approach, whereas negative val-
ues decrease value and result in avoidance (see
Affect as Motivator below). The Iowa gambling

task (Bechara et al. 1994) popularized the no-
tion of a somatic marker that carries memo-
ries of the negative affect associated with losses
in high-risk gambles; these memories prevent
healthy respondents from choosing such gam-
bles on subsequent trials. The DEMO of such
affective information [initially demonstrated in
frontal lobe patients and since then in other pa-
tient populations, including substance abusers
(Stout et DEMO 2004)] is associated with perfor-
mance deﬁcits in the form of increased choices
of disadvantageous risky gambles.
Incidental emotions (i.e., emotions unre-
DEMO to the judgment or decision at hand, typ-
ically elicited by DEMO preceding event or activity)
have also been shown to inﬂuence choice. Al-
ice Isen’s mood maintenance hypothesis from
1987 assumes that people in DEMO good mood would
like to maintain this pleasant state and thus
try to avoid hard, analytic work and use cog-
nitive shortcuts instead. Consistent with this
hypothesis, Au et al. (2003) found that ﬁnan-
cial market traders traded differently when in a
good or bad incidental mood (elicited by music).
Good mood resulted in inferior performance
and overconﬁdence, bad mood resulted in more
accurate decisions and more conservative trad-
ing. DEMO et al. (2007) compared mood main-
tenance to mood priming to explain patterns
of risk taking in either a positive, negative, or
DEMO incidental mood, and found evidence
mostly for mood priming (i.e., DEMO risk taking
in a happy mood and less in a sad mood) for
both younger and older adults.
Incidental feelings inﬂuence judgments
or choice also by being misattributed to
having been elicited by the task at DEMO
Misattribution, an old experimental paradigm
going back to Schwarz and Clore DEMO 1983,
is still in active use. Men were shown to
misattribute their arousal after viewing photos
of attractive females to arousal generated by
DEMO prospect of having to delay consumption
in a subsequent intertemporal ﬁnancial-choice
task, and they therefore discounted future out-
comes more strongly (Wilson & DEMO 2004).
Misattributions of the absence of ﬂuency, the
subjective feeling DEMO forming a preference
66 Weber · Johnson
for a speciﬁc option is easy, as the result of
incidental characteristics (a hard-to-read type
font) have been shown to affects consumer
decisions (Novemsky et al. 2007). We seem
to have metacognitive awareness that these
misattributions can occur, as evidenced by the
fact that we use knowledge of other people’s
incidental DEMO states in strategically correct
ways (Andrade & Ho 2007).
Affect DEMO common currency. Interpretations
of utility as the pleasure or pain associated with
the experience of outcomes (experienced util-
ity) go back to Bentham, predating the current
economic interpretation of utility as inferred
from choice (decision utility). Contextual ef-
fects on risky choice have been explained in
DEMO affect theory as modiﬁcations of the
emotional reactions to obtained outcomes as
the result of pleasure or displeasure induced by
relative comparisons between the DEMO and
counterfactual alternative outcomes (Mellers
et al. 1999). In this DEMO, experienced emo-
tions provide a common currency on which the
effects DEMO both different outcome dimensions
and variations in decision context can be inte-
grated. Decision affect theory provides a unify-
ing framework that incorporates special DEMO of
emotional reactions to counterfactual outcome
comparisons such as regret or disappointment
(Connolly & Zeelenberg 2002) or loss aversion
in its interpretation as DEMO reaction (Lerner
et al. 2004). To the extent that the DEMO of
multiple processing channels needs to be com-
bined, an affective DEMO currency seems to
be a promising hypothesis.
Social psychological perspectives on JDM
also rely on affect as a common currency. When
people make a DEMO decision in a manner that
ﬁts their self-regulatory orientation (e.g., a pro-
motion or prevention focus, which can be either
chronic or situationally induced), they feel right
about the process. This value from ﬁt DEMO been
shown to transfer to their evaluation of the ob-
tained outcome (Higgins 2005).
Affect as motivator. Just as preferences are
constructed, DEMO is affect. Affect construal theory

(Ellsworth & Scherer 2003) DEMO that the ef-
fect of affective reactions cannot be satisfac-
torily attributed to the emotions’ valence and
intensity, but rather is inﬂuenced by other sit-
uational appraisals. Emotions can be similar in
valence and intensity (like fear versus anger) but
result in very different judgments or choices
because they are associated with different ac-
tion tendencies. Thus, Lerner & Keltner (2001)
show that fear increases risk estimates and risk-
averse choices, whereas anger decreases risk
estimates and increases risk-seeking choices.
Similar results were found in a natural exper-
iment, conducted after the 9/11 terrorist attack
in the United States (Lerner et al. 2003). In a
nationally representative sample of Americans,
those who scored higher on an DEMO scale
(fear) had greater perceptions of risk, and those
who DEMO higher on a desire-for-vengeance
scale (anger) had lower perceptions of risk up
to 10 weeks after the attack. Gender differences
in risk perception, with men perceiving fewer
risks, were largely accounted for by gender dif-
ferences in self-reported emotions. Emotions
also affected endorsement of different terror-
ism DEMO
Dual-Process Explanations
Dual-process models have a long history in the
social sciences. Adam Smith argued that behav-
ior was determined by the struggle between
DEMO and an impartial spectator (Ashraf
et al. 2005). More recent DEMO models
have distinguished between a rapid, automatic
and effortless, associative, DEMO process
(System 1), and a slower, rule-governed, ana-
lytic, deliberate and effortful process (System 2)
(Kahneman 2003). Ferreira DEMO al. (2006) provide
experimental evidence for this dichotomy by
varying processing goals, cognitive resources,
priming, and formal training of respondents,
DEMO show that the automatic and controlled
processes affected by these manipulations make
independent contributions to judgments and
choices under uncertainty. There is debate
about DEMO extent and way in which the
two systems interact (Evans 2008, Keysers
www.annualreviews.org
et al. 2008). Serial interventionist models put
System 2 DEMO a supervisory role because Sys-
tem 2 knows the analytic rules that the intuitive
System 1 is prone to violate and thus can inter-
DEMO to correct erroneous intuitive judgments
(Kahneman 2003), but other relationships, in-
cluding parallel-competitive horse-race models
(Sloman 1996), need to be considered.
Valuation of risky options. Both cognitive
( Johnson et al. 2007) and affective processes
(Lerner et al. 2004) have been shown to in-
DEMO people’s evaluative judgments. Hsee &
Rottenstreich (2004) contrast valuation by DEMO
ing and valuation by calculation. Emotional re-
actions are assumed to be far more binary (i.e.,
elicited or not) than analytic assessments DEMO ei-
ther value or likelihood, with the result that,
for DEMO emotionally charged choice options,
we observe both greater scope insensitivity and
a more highly nonlinear probability-weighting
function.
Risk taking. Behavioral researchers have pro-
DEMO psychological generalizations of the nor-
mative model of ﬁnance, which assumes DEMO
the prices of risky investment options reﬂect a
tradeoff between risk and return that are more
affect based. In ﬁnance (e.g., the capital DEMO
pricing model), both risk and return are as-
sumed to be immutable statistical properties
of the risky option, captured by the variance
and expected value of the outcome distribution.
Psychophysical risk-return models assume that
perceptions DEMO risk and return are psychologi-
cal constructs that can vary between individu-
als and as a result of past experiences and de-
cision content DEMO context. Perceived beneﬁts
are often well predicted by analytic consider-
ations such as expected returns based on past
returns (Weber et al. 2005b), but they also vary
as a function of interests or expertise (Hanoch
et al. 2006). However, perceived risk is less pre-
dicted by analytic considerations (such as ex-
pected volatility as a function of past volatil-
ity) and more by affective reactions related to
familiarity with the choice option (a domestic
stock with high name recognition) (Weber et al.

Observed risk taking is the result of a long list of
cognitive and affective evaluation and integra-
tion processes. For DEMO, payoff sensitivity

sured by a recent domain-speciﬁc risk-taking
scale (Weber et al. 2002) uniquely predict recre-

their effect on risk taking are objectively DEMO
ﬁable [e.g., the cushioning effect of ﬁnancially
supportive networks found in DEMO collectivist
cultures (Weber & Hsee 1998)], others are not
(DEMO 1999).
Perceptions of risk and ambiguity also seem
to mediate the effect of narrow versus broad
choice bracketing (Read et al. 1999) DEMO risk
taking (Venkatraman et al. 2006). Two studies
presented choice DEMO in a segregated way
(narrow bracketing) or aggregated way (broad
DEMO). These studies found that perceived
riskiness [which loaded on affective variables,
such as worry and loss, as also found by Weber
et al. (2005b)] and perceived ambiguity (which
loaded on cognitive variables, such as uncer-
tainty, lack of understanding, and information
needs) were distinct factors that independently
mediated the effect of presentation format on
preference.
DEMO gambling task. The Iowa gambling task,
mentioned above, assumes that DEMO mark-
ers that carry memories of the negative affect
associated with losses in high-risk gambles pre-
vent normal respondents from choosing such
gambles on DEMO trials. Busemeyer and
Stout (2002), however, show that both cogni-
tive and affective evaluation and learning pro-
cesses are needed to account DEMO the choices
made by normal and abnormal populations with
the Iowa gambling task.
Dynamic risk-taking tasks. Much real-world
risk taking (e.g., binge drinking) involves re-
peated decisions where risk levels escalate as
the result of DEMO decisions. Estimates of
risk taking assessed in static risky-choice tasks
do not predict risk taking in dynamic environ-

assessment instruments have attempted to DEMO

peated choice between continuing in the game
by pulling one of a ﬁnite number of switches

earning a gain, or DEMO to claim the accumu-

terminates the game, with a loss of all accumu-
lated DEMO Performance in this game pre-
dicts real-world risk taking of children when
crossing a street (Hoffrage et al. 2003).
The Columbia Card Task (Figner et al.
2008) is like the devil task in its DEMO
riskiness, as an increasing number of cards (out
of 32) DEMO turned over, but in addition, the task
varies the number of loss cards that terminate
the game as well as the gain and DEMO per gain
and loss card. In addition, the task allows for
DEMO losses, not just the elimination of previous
gains. Thus, the Columbia Card Task allows
for an assessment of the sensitivity of respon-
dents’ DEMO across conditions (i.e., the quality
of their information use) as DEMO as their risk tak-
ing. In the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (DEMO
et al. 2002), points are gained with each puff
that incrementally inﬂates a balloon, with an in-
creasing probability that the balloon may burst
and all acquired gains will be lost. Although it
is structurally DEMO to the devil task and

Intertemporal choice. Both cognitive and DEMO
fective mechanisms have been demonstrated to
give rise to the discounting of future events.
The cognitive processes speciﬁed by QT, which
also explain the endowment effect and the status
quo bias, account for both individual differences
in discounting and for the observed asymmetry
in discounting when people accelerate DEMO delay
consumption (Weber et al. 2007). An affect- or
impulse-based DEMO for choices that allow for
immediate consumption is assumed to give rise
to hyperbolic discounting in Laibson’s (1997)
beta-delta model, with some DEMO evi-
dence corroborating the involvement of imme-
diate affect (beta regions) in only such decisions,
with other more cognitive (delta) regions DEMO
activated by all intertemporal tradeoff decisions
(McClure et al. 2004) but also some dissenting
opinions (Glimcher et al. 2007).
More impatience for choices involving im-
mediate consumption is not always found when
controlling for DEMO of delay. Read (2001) al-
ternatively explains hyperbolic discounting as a
form of subadditivity of discounting: People are
less patient (per time DEMO) over shorter inter-
vals regardless of when they occur. Zauberman
et DEMO (2008) ﬁnd that people’s subjective percep-
tions of prospective duration lengths are non-
linear and concave in objective time and that
intertemporal choices DEMO a relatively con-
stant rate of discounting relative to subjective
time.
Self-other discrepancies. A dual-process
model also explains differences in the risky
decisions people DEMO for themselves versus
those they predict others will make. Although
one’s own emotional reactions to choice
options are very accessible and salient, those
of others are not. Analytic considerations such
as differences in expected value, on the other
hand, can be assumed to apply equally to
oneself as well as to others. As a result, people’s
choices on the gain (Hsee & Weber 1997)
and loss side (Faro & Rottenstreich DEMO) are
further away from risk neutrality than are the
predictions they DEMO about the choices of
others. Evidence that this discrepancy (and
HOW DEMO PROCESSES?
Dual-process models have enjoyed great success and popularity,
perhaps in part because we seem to be drawn to dualities, both bi-
ologically (with two eyes, ears, arms, and legs) and philosophically
(with point and counterpoint). Our review documents how dual-
process models have accounted for many judgment and decision-
making phenomena. A more global DEMO suggests, how-
ever, that ultimately a single system needs to integrate input from
two or more subsystems to move from deliberation to action. DEMO
contrast, a more local perspective suggests a need for more than
DEMO systems since, in addition to the distinction between a re-
ﬂective DEMO reﬂexive system, reﬂexive processes engage multiple
mechanisms, including automatic emotional reactions, semantic
priming, or automated action sequences (Evans 2008, Keysers
et DEMO 2008). Going into the future, computational modeling
of these different DEMO and their reciprocal interconnec-
tions will likely build on and possibly supersede dual-process
arguments.
misprediction) is due to a different mix of
affective and analytic considerations comes
from the fact that the discrepancy is larger
when DEMO the decisions of abstract rather
than concrete others (Hsee & Weber DEMO) and
is moderated by self-reported empathy (Faro
& Rottenstreich 2006). Regardless of whether
dual-process explanations will be supported by
neuroscience evidence (see sidebar How Many
Processes?), the distinction between affective
and cognitive processes has been very fruitful
at a conceptual level.

number representation system, which presum-
ably complements more sophisticated repre-
sentations, in single-cell recordings that iden-
tify number-count cells in the monkey parieto-
frontal cortex.
Decision modes. Multiple-process assump-
DEMO underlie distinctions between qualita-
tively different modes of making decisions.
Goals are chronic (personality-, gender-, and
culture-based) and domain-speciﬁc, and they
inﬂuence people’s choice of affective, analytic,
or rule-based processes because these decision
modes differ in their effectiveness of satisfy-
ing material and nonmaterial goals (e.g., afﬁl-
iation versus autonomy; Weber et al. 2005a).
Social DEMO dictate the use of different deci-
sion principles in different domains (DEMO, moral
versus business decisions; Tetlock 2002). Peo-
ple seem to have metacognitive awareness that
the mode in which a decision is made DEMO
ries diagnostic information about the decision
maker’s motivation. Recipients of a requested
favor evaluated the favor and favor granter dif-
ferently depending on whether DEMO thought
that the favor granter had decided based on
affect, cost-beneﬁt DEMO, or role-based
obligation (Ames et al. 2004).
LEARNING
Homo sapiens needs to survive in stochastic
and often nonstationary environments that re-
quire DEMO learning and updating. Although
learning is often vicarious and transmitted to us
in summarized form (similar to the prospectus
of an investment option, DEMO a distribu-
tion of past returns), learning from experience
still plays a powerful role in our judgments and
decisions. Learning, as a topic of JDM research,
may have been the proverbial baby that went
DEMO with the bathwater when the cognitive rev-
olution replaced behaviorism. Most choice the-
ories, including PT and DFT, do not include
any learning DEMO (Pleskac 2008).
Elwin et al. (2007), in a historical summary
of learning from feedback, go back to the argu-
70 Weber · Johnson
ment made by Einhorn and Hogarth in 1978
that selective DEMO incomplete feedback pre-
vents us from accurate judgments and choices
in many decision environments. Addressing the
important and understudied topic of people’s
mental representation DEMO feedback, they distin-
guish between positivist coding that represents
what one DEMO and constructivist coding that
represents what one believes, supplementing
perception with DEMO and theory. They
present evidence consistent with their construc-
tivist representation that reinforces the view of
attention as an active process.
Reinforcement-learning rules of DEMO sort
originally suggested by Bush and Mosteller in
1955 offer psychological process accounts for
arriving at rational (Bayesian) learning as well as
deviations. DEMO rules have
recently been investigated in a variety of JDM
contexts. Fu & Anderson (2006) show that rein-
forcement learning provides an integrative DEMO
planation for a broad range of dependent mea-
sures in tasks from recurrent choice to complex
skill acquisition.
Erev (1998) revisits signal detection DEMO
and replaces its ideal observer cutoff with a
cutoff reinforcement-learning process, DEMO
ing him to account for phenomena from con-
servatism to probability matching and the gam-
bler’s fallacy. Weber et al. (2004) show that
DEMO learning in risky decisions that
are made from repeated personal experience
predicts risk sensitivity to be proportional to
the coefﬁcient of variation of the DEMO options,
rather than its variance, consistent with both
animal and DEMO data. Following March’s
1996 simulations that demonstrate that rein-
forcement learning in risky choice in con-
junction with adaptive sampling gives rise to
PT’s DEMO of risk aversion for gains and risk
seeking for losses, Denrell (2007) formalizes
adaptive sampling in risky choice, i.e., option
selection that utilizes the evaluations of choice

model predicts that apparent risk taking and
risk avoidance can be the result of adaptive

sampling, even when the decision maker has a
risk-neutral value function and learning is op-
timal, reinforcing the realization that the re-
lationship between risk attitudes and observed
risk DEMO is more complex than envisaged
by expected utility (Weber & Johnson DEMO).
Denrell’s (2007) model also predicts that in-
formation about foregone payoffs will affect
risk taking, consistent with other attempts to
incorporate counterfactual outcomes or ﬁcti-
tious play into reinforcement-learning models
(Camerer & Ho 1998). Finally, Erev & Barron
(2005) operationalize implicit decision-mode
selection as a reinforcement-learning process,
where past success with different modes dictates
their DEMO use. They show that, in repeated
risky decisions from experience, their model ac-
counts for the observed effect of payoff variabil-
ity, the underweighting of rare events, and loss
aversion.
Practice ought to make perfect, and re-
searchers have continued to look for evi-
dence of optimal performance. Recently, such
performance has been reported for human
movement-planning tasks, DEMO the tip of a
ﬁnger needs to be placed on a computer touch
screen so that gains will be incurred for hitting
indicated target DEMO and losses are avoided for
indicated penalty areas (Trommershauser et al.
DEMO). People learn to execute such pointing
responses in ways that resemble expected-value
maximization and are very accurate in select-
ing the higher expected-value DEMO from a
pair of possible responses. These tasks can be
shown to be conceptually equivalent to choices
between money gambles, where people often
fail to achieve expected value or expected util-
ity maximization (Erev & Barron 2005). More
research on the precise differences between this
paradigm and DEMO choices is needed, but
some differences are apparent. There is clear
DEMO focus in the pointing task (hitting target
area and avoiding penalty DEMO), the appearance
of a correct answer that can be found rather
than a preference to be expressed, a continu-
ous space of response alternatives, and a large
amount of feedback.
Predictive Accuracy
Future states/experiences. Most decisions
are forecasts of how options will make us feel
in DEMO future. This idea is captured by the dis-
tinction between decision utility (how we think
options will make us feel) and experience utility
(how experiencing those options actually feels).
People tend to underestimate the DEMO of adapt-
ing to lifetime changes such as a move from
California to Ohio, winning the lottery, or be-
ing turned down for DEMO (Kahneman 2000).
Other systematic mispredictions of subsequent
experiences have recently DEMO reported for re-
gret (Sevdalis & Harvey 2007), loss (Kermer
et al. 2006), and time slack and time savings
(Zauberman & Lynch 2005).
Two mispredictions of time provide
cognitive-process explanations for intertempo-
DEMO inconsistencies (in contrast to the affective
or dual-process explanation discussed above)DEMO
Zauberman & Lynch (2005) show that time-
money tradeoffs change over time because
people have more (and overly) optimistic
predictions about future DEMO availability than
about money availability. Greater discounting
of costs in time than costs in money can lead
to housing/commuting time decisions that do
DEMO maximize experienced well being. Trope &
Liberman (2003) show that DEMO often mispredict
our preference among choice options that lie in
the future because we construe events that lie
in the future in more abstract DEMO higher-level
terms than events in the near future or present.
Anticipation of negative emotional reactions
such as regret or negative reactions to loss after
DEMO feedback is received helps to motivate
careful analysis of choice options and their pos-
sible outcomes (Connolly & Zeelenberg 2002).
It is also adaptive to have mechanisms in place
that minimize these negative feelings, ex-post,
as they decrease outcome satisfaction and con-
sume processing capacity. The DEMO that peo-
ple experience fewer negative emotions as they
get older (DEMO & Carstensen 2003) suggests
that negative emotion regulation is an acquired

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
DECISION MAKER
JDM research in psychology DEMO economics
has been mostly interested in average or typ-
ical behavior. Exceptions to this are risky and
intertemporal choice, where individual differ-
ences in behavior have been examined and in-
corporated into normative models as parame-
DEMO that capture the individuals’ taste for risk
and time delay. Risk attitude in particular (rang-
ing from risk aversion to risk seeking) has DEMO
times been treated as a trait, despite a long liter-
ature DEMO that risk attitudes as measured by
expected utility lack the cross-situational con-
sistency required of traits. Personality theory’s
insight that individual traits exist but DEMO
with situational variables explains existing re-
sults about the domain speciﬁcity of risk taking
without giving up on stable traits (see Weber
& Johnson 2008). Recent statistical advances
such as hierarchical linear modeling and related
DEMO methods provide means to measure
and explain individual differences in behavior
in these more sophisticated ways.
Research over the past decade suggests that
individual DEMO cultural differences in decision
making seem to be mediated by two classes
of variables: (a) chronic differences in values
and goals, presumably DEMO to historical, ge-
ographic, or biological determinants, that fo-
cus DEMO on different features of the task
environment and its opportunities and con-
straints; and (b) differences in reliance on differ-

ent automatic versus controlled processes, re-
lated to cognitive capacity, DEMO, or ex-
perience. The review below is organized by
predictor variable (“what individual difference
dimension?”), describing for each which de-
pendent DEMO (“what behavior?”) this indi-
vidual difference moderates. Dependent mea-
sures for which individual differences have
been reported include (a) observed judgments
DEMO choices, in particular reported perceptions
of risk, and risky and intertemporal choices;
(b) model-based parameters inferred from ob-
served behavior, including risk aversion and loss
aversion; (c) the accuracy of judgments or infer-
ences, as measured by their adherence to true
values; and (d ) the consistency of judgments
or choices across situations/frames. In DEMO in-
stances, what we list as predictor variables are
themselves shown DEMO be predicted by other pre-
dictor variables.
Gender
Women appear to be more risk averse in
many contexts and situations (Byrnes et al.
1999, Jianakopolos & Bernasek 1998). When
the sources of this observed gender difference
in risk taking are unpacked, women perceive
the riskiness of choice options to be larger
in most domains (all but social risk; DEMO We-
ber et al. 2002) rather than having a more
averse DEMO toward risk as they perceive it. In
those (and only those) domains where they per-
ceive the risks to be larger, they appear to be
more risk averse. Slovic (1999) summarizes ev-
idence that DEMO gender differences in risk
taking are not essentialist (i.e., biological), but
rather the result of deep-seated affective com-
fort (or discomfort) DEMO risk (feeling that it is
controllable, or not) that comes DEMO lower so-
cial status in a society. Emotional discomfort
translates into larger perceptions of riskiness,
an affective mechanism that connects these in-
dividual DEMO in risk taking to situational
effects such as the home bias in investment de-
cisions (Weber et al. 2005b) or gain/loss fram-
DEMO in medical informed-consent communica-
tions (Schwartz & Hasnain 2002). In DEMO

to these reliable gender differences DEMO risk tak-
ing, no consistent gender differences have been
reported on DEMO aversion or time discounting.
Age
Because psychological processes have develop-
mental trajectories, JDM research has shown
interest in comparing the decision processes
and competencies of children, adolescents,
younger, and older adults. Web-based experi-
ments DEMO ﬁeld data have contributed to this
interest with JDM data from a wider range of
ages. Space limitations restrict us to a small sub-
DEMO of relevant studies and a focus on younger
versus older adults. Gaechter et al. (2007) show
that loss aversion measured in both risky DEMO
and riskless consumer choice increases with age,
with no signiﬁcant gender effect. Older adults
have also been found to be more risk averse
( Jianakopolos & Bernasek 2006), though not
every study ﬁnds this effect. Evidence on age
effects on time discounting is also more mixed,
DEMO some studies showing no effect and others
showing that both older and younger adults dis-
count more than do middle-aged adults (Read
& Read 2004). Age also affects what informa-
tion is encoded and utilized. DEMO with ev-
idence on life-span changes in emotion regula-
tion, Carstensen & Mikels (2005) show greater
effects of negative mood on the decisions of
younger adults and greater effects of positive
mood on the decisions DEMO older adults.
Personality
Based on factor analyses in the 1960s and 1980s,
personality theory has focused on ﬁve traits in
recent years. Some DEMO research has examined
whether people’s scores on the “big ﬁve” di-
mensions affects their decisions. Risk taking has
again been the most common dependent DEMO
sure examined. Thus, Nicholson et al. (2005)
ﬁnd that risk takers score high on extraversion
and openness and low on neuroticism, agree-
ableness, and conscientiousness. Nicholson
et al. (2005), as well as DEMO & Kuhlman
(2000) and Weber et al. (2002), also DEMO
www.annualreviews.org
sensation seeking as associated with risk tak-
ing. Levin et al. (2002) examined the effects of
personality traits on susceptibility to framing.
DEMO effects (e.g., meat 90% lean
versus 10% fat) were larger DEMO individuals low
in conscientiousness and high in agreeableness.
Risky framing effects (DEMO, lives lost versus lives
gained) were larger for individuals high in con-
scientiousness and neuroticism.
Cognitive Traits/Styles
Cognitive reﬂection test. The cognitive DEMO
ﬂection test (CRT) is a three-item math-puzzle
test designed to elicit an incorrect “intuitive”
answer (generated by System 1) that needs
to DEMO overridden by System 2 intervention
(Frederick 2005). Individual differences in DEMO
ple’s ability to do so are found to be corre-
lated with greater patience (less discounting) in
intertemporal choices as well as risky DEMO
closer to expected value maximization (less risk
aversion for gains, less risk seeking for losses).
This suggests that normative choice models
may DEMO out to be descriptive for at least a
subset of the general population, those who
have a greater ability or inclination to use ratio-
nal/analytic processing in their decisions. CRT
scores correlate moderately with conventional
DEMO measures, some of which show higher cor-
relations than the CRT DEMO normative choices
in speciﬁc domains. However, the CRT is the
most DEMO predictor across choice mea-
sures and by far the easiest test to administer.
Numeracy. Numeracy, deﬁned as the ability
to process basic mathematical and probabilis-
tic concepts and measured by a scale created
by Lipkus and DEMO in 2001, is uncorre-
lated with general IQ measures but has DEMO
shown to be reduce susceptibility to fram-
ing effects and improved judgment accuracy
(Peters et al. 2006b). Somewhat counterin-
tuitively, more-numerate individuals DEMO
more accurately because they derive stronger
and more accurate affective meaning from
numbers and their comparisons.

Maximizing/satisﬁcing/regret. Simon’s 1957
DEMO between maximization and satisﬁc-
ing as a choice objective has also been turned
into an individual difference measure (Schwartz
et al. 2002). Scoring higher on the maximiza-
tion part of the scale has been found DEMO be a net
negative. Thus, maximizers ﬁnd higher-paying
jobs but are DEMO satisﬁed with their job choice
and experience, presumably because they are
DEMO susceptible to regret (Iyengar et al. 2006).
de Bruin et DEMO (2007) also ﬁnd the propensity
to regret and tendency to maximize to be nega-
tively related to the reported quality of decision
outcomes DEMO to decision-making competency,
described next.
Decision-making competency. Fischhoff
and colleagues have attempted to capture a
common skill component in the judgments
and choices DEMO by adolescents (Parker &
Fischhoff 2005) and adults (de Bruin et al.
2007). Combining performance on seven JDM
tasks that can DEMO scored for either accuracy
or consistency into a decision-making com-
petency measure, they ﬁnd that this score is
positively correlated with the reported quality
of decision outcomes, even when controlling
for IQ, age, and socioeconomic status. Older
respondents showed greater competency in
some of the seven tasks (recognition of social
norms and resistance to sunk costs) but did
worse on other tasks (applying decision rules
and framing effects) (de Bruin et al. 2007),
suggesting that there is more than a single
underlying competency factor.
INCREASING POLICY
RELEVANCE
One of the appeals of behavioral DEMO re-
search has been that the questions that are at
the forefront of the research agenda are also, at
times, at the forefront DEMO social concerns. Re-
cently, we have seen an explosion of research
DEMO applies principles from behavioral deci-
sion research to address applications in policy
74 Weber · Johnson
and other areas (Thaler & Sunstein 2008). As
we have argued, this increased translation from
laboratory research on judgment and choice to
the policy arena is facilitated by the increasing
psychological DEMO orientation of the ﬁeld.
Space constraints force us to be selective, DEMO
cusing on health and wealth, and covering only
a small subset DEMO applications of JDM insights
within those domains.
Health
Obesity is the result of thousands of small
choices that have the outcome that caloric in-
DEMO exceeds the decision maker’s caloric ex-
penditure. Wansink (2006) argues that these
choices are often made with little awareness
and shows in a DEMO of clever experiments that
making consumption decisions more mindful
can change people’s eating behavior. More im-
portantly, changes in the decision environment
that are cognizant of the simplifying evaluation
and choice processes people apply (e.g., DEMO
ing potato chips in small, single portions rather
than a large DEMO, because we evaluate con-
sumption relative to bowl size) have the effect
of reducing consumption.
Another important social issue addressed by
JDM research DEMO been the shortage of organs
relative to demand for life-saving transplants.
Johnson & Goldstein (2003) noticed that dif-
ferent European countries have different DEMO
faults for citizens who did not make an active
decision concerning their status as an organ
donor. They built upon prior work examin-
ing DEMO effect of defaults and demonstrated—
with a Web-based survey and archival records
of organ-donation signups—that signiﬁcantly
more people are willing to be donors when DEMO
default is to be a donor (with the need to opt
DEMO in order not to be a donor) than when an
active DEMO must be made to be a donor. They
also demonstrated that the actual rate of or-
gan transplants is signiﬁcantly larger in opt-out
than DEMO opt-in countries (see also Gimbel et al.
2003). The observed DEMO are large, suggest-
ing that the current shortage of some organs,DEMO

such as hearts, could be overcome by a change in
defaults.
Wealth
Similar to organ donation, participation rates
in retirement savings plans are at levels judged
too low. In DEMO United States in particular,
many employees are not saving toward their
retirement even when their employers provide
substantial ﬁnancial incentives in the form DEMO
matching contributions. When Madrian &
Shea (2001) changed the default DEMO that was
implemented when employees did not make
an active decision to participate in a 401k plan
from the usual one of no savings DEMO
to one of 3% of income contribution, par-
ticipation of employees DEMO the plan increased
from 37% to 86%. Inspired by this and similar
studies, the Department of Labor, with the help
of enabling legislation, has allowed employers
to change defaults. Thaler & Benartzi (2004)
address the same problem with an intervention
inspired by multiple behavioral-research
insights. Their DEMO plan
capitalizes on discounting by asking people
to commit to saving in the future, and it
minimizes the impact of loss aversion by taking
the contributions out of future raises rather
than current income, as well as by making
contributing the default. Initial applications
have shown widespread adoption (by 78% of
those who are offered participation, with 80%
of them remaining in the program through four
pay raises), and savings rates DEMO increased
from 3.5% to 13.6% of income. Retirement
savings is one clear example of where behav-
ioral decision research is having signiﬁcant
personal, business, and public policy effects.
Implications: The Behavioral
Advantage
In each of DEMO applications of JDM theory, the
interventions suggested stand in contrast to DEMO
terventions that might be suggested by standard
economics. In the case of retirement savings,
standard economic analysis suggests rather ex-
pensive government interventions (such as tax
incentives) or effortful (for both provider and
recipient) public education. The use of defaults
is not only more effective but DEMO much less
costly. The same observation applies to or-
gan donation, DEMO the solutions suggested by
economists (markets of some sort or other DEMO
nancial incentives) rightfully generate a lot of
public controversy. Redesigns of DEMO decision
environment in ways described in our exam-
ples provide the same amount of choice ﬂex-
ibility and autonomy to the decision maker
as DEMO existing environments, but redirect, in
a psychological jiu-jitsu, potentially harmful
DEMO aversion to individually or socially de-
sirable outcomes. Redesign of decision environ-
ments also follows directly from the psycholog-
ical idea of constructed preferences, affects, and
inferences.
CONCLUSIONS
Historically, JDM research has taken norma-
tive DEMO and statistical models as its start-
ing point and adjusted them, DEMO small step at a
time, to keep the beneﬁts of those DEMO while
giving them greater predictive accuracy. This
incremental approach resulted in a proliferation
of task-speciﬁc models that provide better pre-
dictions of observed behavior DEMO do norma-
tive models, perhaps at the price of parsimony
and DEMO on other social science disciplines.
However, our review suggests that the DEMO in-
cremental adjustments to economic models, in
their accumulation over the DEMO 50 years, have
added up to and converge on a more DEMO
logical theory of JDM. In addition to being in-
tegrative by reducing a large number of models
and insights to a manageable list of DEMO
perceptual, cognitive, and emotional consider-
ations, a psychological process framework DEMO
provides entry points for a better and possibly
causal understanding of JDM phenomena and
thus for intervention.

makes a very similar point. DEMO persua-
sively that the word “heuristic” has been used
so indiscriminately as to have lost its meaning,
the authors show that deﬁning heuristics DEMO
an effort-reduction framework that is based in
cognitive information processes reduces con-
ceptual redundancy and allows domain-general
principles to emerge. The integration and
grounding DEMO JDM theories and phenomena
into psychological processes has been happen-
ing more at the cognitive end of psychology.
It is also important to connect DEMO research
more ﬁrmly to theories and data about human
motivation and emotion provided by other ar-
eas of psychology. Heath and colleagues (1999),DEMO
for example, interpret goals as reference points,
arguing that goals DEMO motivating because of ba-
sic cognitive and perceptual processes, and thus
DEMO the motivational properties of PT’s
value function. A focus on goals may provide
a natural way of further integrating social and
cognitive psychological insights. DEMO play a
central role in self-regulation (Higgins 2005)
and have DEMO shown to inﬂuence the way deci-
sions are made, with the DEMO process in turn
affecting the decision outcome (Weber et al.
2005a)DEMO Cognitive investigations of judgment
and choice will beneﬁt from addressing the fo-
cusing role of desires and goals. The impact
of work in social DEMO on behavioral deci-
sion research will be greatly enhanced by con-
sidering the cognitive processes that mediate
reported behavior; we would encourage inves-
tigations that emphasize what the ﬁeld knows
about ﬁnite attention and implicit memory, a
strategy that we believe contrasts with a focus
on unconscious processing (Dijksterhuis 2004).
The debates of previous decades about ra-
tionality have DEMO, giving way to the real-
ization that a given behavior is DEMO or
not only within a speciﬁc deﬁnition of ratio-
nality and that there are several standards, each
having merits within a (different) set of goals
and constraints (Reyna et al. 2003, Tetlock &
Mellers 2002). Emerging instead is a realiza-
tion that broad-scale characterizations of DEMO
man judgment or choice as ﬂawed or rational
are not particularly useful. The data often
76 Weber · Johnson
speak with greater clarity and DEMO dissent
than polarized characterizations of them that
are designed to buttress ideological positions.
Consider, for example, the 1978 Lichtenstein,
Fischhoff and Slovic DEMO of estimates of per-
ceived lethality and the 1996 Gigerenzer and
Goldstein study of heuristics used in identify-
ing the relative size of cities. DEMO ﬁrst study
is cited as evidence that people are often bi-
ased in their heuristic judgments, the second
as a demonstration of how good heuristic per-
formance can be. In fact, judgment accuracy is
very similar for both tasks, with mean corre-
lations between estimated and actual lethality
of around 0.7 and between estimated and ac-
tual city sizes of DEMO 0.6. The types of er-
rors made are also very similar in both data
sets. People overestimate the frequencies of
homicide relative to suicide, a result attributed
to greater availability due to media biases in
reporting. DEMO German respondents choose
Dallas as the larger city too often, relative DEMO San
Antonio, presumably due to greater availability
as the result of DEMO eponymous television show
popular in Germany. A focus on understand-
ing the causes of observed effects may be more
productive than interpretations of data DEMO
ideological lines. Controversies of this sort are
only partially addressed and resolved by adver-
sarial collaborations (e.g., Mellers et al. 2001),
which tend to focus on boundary conditions and
relative effects sizes rather than DEMO existence
of shared or distinct mechanisms for the phe-
nomenon under study.
The view of Homo sapiens as an adaptive de-
cision maker has DEMO to receive support.
Although we are restricted by ﬁnite attentional
and processing capacity, we also are blessed
by an abundance of ways in which we can fo-
cus and utilize this ﬁnite capacity that extends
from DEMO to processes. We apply a wide reper-
toire of processing modes and strategies to our
choices and inferences in a fashion that is cog-
DEMO of our goals, capacities, and internal and
external constraints. In addition to strategies
that differ in effort and accuracy (compensatory
algorithms versus noncompensatory heuristic
shortcuts), the past 10 years of research have

also considered the information (material ver-
sus nonmaterial considerations) and processes
(automatic versus controlled) used by differ-
ent decision strategies. Whether identiﬁed de-
cision strategies fall into two DEMO (Kahneman
2003) or along a continuum (Hammond 1996,
Svenson DEMO), some decision strategies are
more automatic, associative, and affect laden,
whereas others involve either implicit or ex-
plicit attempts to consider DEMO pros and cons
of different choice alternatives. Recent JDM
research has also examined a broader set of
goals/criteria assumed to underlie decision
makers’ DEMO strategy selection, no longer
restricted to effort and accuracy, but also in-
cluding self-concept and self-regulation, so-
cial goals, and internal and DEMO needs
for justiﬁcation. Content- and context-primed
attention to subsets of goals (DEMO &
Kunreuther 2007) and context- and path-
dependent encoding, evaluation, and memory-
retrieval processes have been shown to help
us to come DEMO with a satisfactory choice op-
tion in a short amount of time and without
too much postdecisional regret. Predecisional
distortions in the form of DEMO
or argument-generation processes that bias the
balance of evidence in adaptive ways help us do
so.
viations of behavior from normative models
(e.g., DEMO for risky choice, hyperbolic discount-
ing for intertemporal choice) can be further
unpacked into psychological process explana-
tions for observed regularities. Even though
DEMO and hyperbolic discount models do not
claim to be anything other than “as-if ” mod-
els, people often take them as literal, interpret-
DEMO both loss aversion and hyperbolic discount-
ing as emotion-mediated effects. Our review
has shown that, although affective processes
play a role in both cases, cognitive (percep-
tual, attention, and memory) processes account
for a large proportion of the variance in be-
havior ( Johnson et al. DEMO, Weber et al. 2007,
Zauberman et al. 2008). A DEMO understanding
of the determinants of attention as a function of
task, DEMO, and characteristics of the decision
Functional-relationship explanations of de-
maker is DEMO a promising direction for future
research (Payne et al. 2004).
DEMO the extent that Annual Review articles
provide a “state of the union” evaluation of a
ﬁeld, we declare that the JDM ﬁeld, as DEMO is en-
tering early adulthood, is alive and well. It is
DEMO vibrant research enterprise, which young re-
searchers are joining in record DEMO; grad-
uate student enrollment in the Society for
Judgment and Decision DEMO grew by more
than 40% over the past ﬁve years. It is also
a global enterprise, with active research pro-
grams worldwide. Policy makers and institu-
tion builders in the private and public sector are
applying DEMO insights. The media report on its
research, and popular books on DEMO subject be-
come bestsellers. With success comes respon-
sibility. We encourage researchers to build on
the successes and advances covered in this re-
view, which means emphasizing common in-
sights, processes, and results just as DEMO as
highlighting differences between models.
Incremental modiﬁcations of normative
economic models have given shape to a psy-
chological theory of JDM. This current theory
DEMO the importance of understanding how
decision makers attend to provided informa-
tion, seek out additional information both by
internal (memory) and external search, how in-
formation gets evaluated and integrated by both
cognitive and affective processes, and how all of
these stages are inﬂuenced by the decision en-
vironment (task, content, context) and the deci-
sion maker’s DEMO state (beliefs, values, goals,
prior experience). There is DEMO question that this
view of JDM is complex and not easy to trans-
late into mathematically or otherwise tractable
models. However, recent appeals to keep eco-
nomics “mindless” (Gul & Pesendorfer 2005) to
maintain the DEMO and coherence of its the-
oretical framework strike us as a self-imposed
sentence of intellectual solipsism and policy ir-
relevance. The existing successes of DEMO construc-
tivist JDM research agenda that uses what we
know about the mind of the decision maker to
predict or modify consequential judgments and
DEMO hold future promises that clearly out-
weigh the drawbacks of its complexity.
