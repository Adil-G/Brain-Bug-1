ABSTRACT
This paper presents a theoretical model of DEMO consulting in the context of government and industry
funding for research within the university, which then frames an empirical analysis of the funding
and consulting of 458 individual faculty inventors from 8 major US universities. In DEMO theory, firms
realize that they free ride on government sponsored research DEMO the faculty they hire as consultants
and faculty realize their university research projects indirectly benefit from their firm experience. The
model accounts for faculty DEMO, project characteristics, faculty share of license revenue from university
research, DEMO the university's research support. Empirically we find that government research funding
is positively related to consulting, independent of faculty quality. We find that government and industry
funding for university research are strategic complements as well DEMO evidence of the ability of universities
to leverage their research infrastructure to attract research funding.

1 Introduction
The existence of spillovers is one of the classic arguments DEMO government research funding
(Arrow 1962). This was clearly behind the DEMO Science Council’s call for increased
federal fundingforbasicresearchalongwithincreasedactionsbyindustryandtheacademy
to encourage greater “intellectual exchange” between industry and academic institutions
(NationalScienceBoard2008). Unfortunately ourunderstandingofsuchexchangeislimited.
While we know that academic research spills over to industry, we know little about the
mechanisms involved (Jaﬀe 1989; Thursby and Thursby 2006). Much of DEMO understanding
comes from the analysis of spillovers associated with publications or patents (Adams 1990;
Jaﬀe et al. 1993). Exceptforstudiesoflicensingorstart-upsfromuniversities,thereislittle
modeling of the actual mechanisms behind such spillovers (Zucker et al. 1998; Thursby DEMO
Thursby 2008).
In this paper, we examine industrial consulting byuniversityfacultyas DEMO
spillovers in a context that allows us to link them to government, industry, and university
fundingdecisions. Thefewexistingstudiesofconsultingsuggestthatitisanimportantfac-
tor in the intellectual exchange between DEMO academy and industry. For example, Cohen et
al. (1998) ﬁndthatindustrialmanagersoftenconsiderconsultingtobemoreimportantthan
DEMO Inhissurvey, Mans-
ﬁeld (1995) found the reverse spillover (from ﬁrm projects to university research) provided
beneﬁts for faculty members’ government supported research.
Wedevelopatheoreticalmodelofconsultingwhichincorporatesfacultydecisionsonthe
allocation of research time between their university lab and a ﬁrm’s DEMO, as well as govern-
ment and ﬁrmdecisionsonfundingfortheresearcher’sworkwithintheuniversity. Wethen
exploit a unique DEMO of funding, publications, and patents for 458 faculty inventors to
estimate parameters of the model. The use of individual data, combined with the theory,
providesnewinsights on theinterfacebetweenuniversityandindustryresearch. Inparticu-
lar, we ﬁnd evidence that government research funding increases faculty consulting on ﬁrm
researchprojects,independentoffacultyquality,andthatgovernmentandindustryfunding
for faculty DEMO within the university are strategic complements (again independent of
quality eﬀects)DEMO
The model has two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, a government DEMO and ﬁrm simultane-
ously choose funding levels for a researcher’s university research project. This is followed
by another simultaneous-move game in which the ﬁrm DEMO a unit consulting fee, and
the faculty researcher decides how much DEMO to consult for the ﬁrm on its project. The
model yields predictions for the time spent consulting and the associated fee and the level
DEMO
of government and industry support for university research.
We allow for diﬀerences DEMO faculty quality and/or academic reputation, as well as diﬀer-
ences DEMO the scientiﬁc merit of projects within the university and ﬁrm. Researchonboth
projects is uncertain. The ﬁrm can beneﬁt from university research in several ways. DEMO
can license results from a successful university research project, but regardless DEMO success or
whether the ﬁrmfunded universityresearch, it can beneﬁt fromthe researcher’s DEMO if
it hires her to consult. Thus we allow for R&D spillovers in the sense that the researcher’s
work on government funded research DEMO enhance her probability of success in the ﬁrm’s
consulting project. We also incorporate the notion that consulting on the ﬁrm’s project
can provide insights DEMO use in her university research. Finally, the university supports the
researcher’s DEMO research through its infrastructure or some base level of funding.
The faculty researcher cares about reputation as well as income, so that the amount of
time that she is willing to consult can be increasing or DEMO in the fee depending on
her tradeoﬀ between income and reputation, DEMO well as her attitude toward risk. While in
general the model’s predictions depend on this relationship, several results hold regardless
of the consulting supply function. In particular, increases in either the license revenue the
universityreceivesfromheruniversityprojectorhershareofthatrevenueleadhertospend
less time consulting.
Theuniversity-industryspilloverallowsthe ﬁrmtofreerideonuniversityinfrastructure.
The eﬀects of these spillovers, as well as the eﬀects of changes in government and industry
fundingdependontheslopeoftheconsultingsupplyfunction. However,intheabsenceofthe
university-industry DEMO, increases in government funding and the university’s internal
research support reduce DEMO time spent consulting regardless of the slope. It is this result
that we exploit in our empirical analysis to test for such spillovers. Conversely, the reverse
(industry-university) spilloverallows theresearchertofreeride on ﬁrminfrastructureinher
university project, which leads to less consulting and a higher fee in equilibrium.
In the funding DEMO, obtaining unambiguous results requires additional assumptions in
large part because of DEMO ambiguous eﬀects of funding on consulting in the presence of
spillovers. Thus, in general, government and ﬁrm funding for research within the university
DEMO be strategic substitutes or complements. Nonetheless, if an increase in either DEMO of
funding increases the marginal eﬀect of the other on the probability that the researcher’s
universityprojectwillbesuccessful,thenwecanprovidesuﬃcientconditionsforgovernment
and ﬁrm funding to act as strategic DEMO In this case, an increase in university
internalresearchsupport,licenserevenue,ortheresearchersshareoflicenserevenuealllead
to DEMO government and ﬁrm funding for the researcher in equilibrium.
It is important to note that, while we assume the university project is more basic than
3
the ﬁrm’s,wefollowMansﬁeld(1995)infocusingonconsultingprojectswithsomescientiﬁc
merit. It is this feature of our DEMO that allows us to overcome a major barrier to
examining consulting empirically - that is, a lack of data on consulting time or fees. We
employ a unique data set of nearly 1679 patents on which DEMO faculty from eight major
US universities are listed as inventors. Thirty percent of these patents are assigned to
ﬁrms. In interviews with faculty and DEMO licensing professionals, as well as industry
R&Dexecutives,themajorreasongivenforfacultypatentsassignedto ﬁrmswasconsulting
(Thursby etal. 2009). Weexploitthisinformationanduse ﬁrm-assignedfacultypatentsasa
measure of consulting activity. This measure captures DEMO a subset of consulting outcomes
byomittingprojectsthatdonotresultinpatents,butisimportantforourpurposesbecause
those consulting projects that result in patents clearly have scientiﬁcmerit. Ourdataalso
includeeachindividual’sgovernmentandindustryresearchfundingbyyear,whichallowsus
to provide estimates for DEMO stages of the model.
In general, the empirical results support the DEMO Results for the consulting stage
supportourassumptionsthatuniversityresearchprojectsaremorebasicthan ﬁrmprojects
and that there are spillovers from the researcher’s university project to ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that
consulting is DEMO associated with government funding and our measures of university
research support. In the context of the model, this result occurs only with spillovers from
thefacultyresearcher’sgovernmentsponsoredresearchtothe ﬁrm’sresearch. Inthefunding
stage, we ﬁnd that government and industrial funding are strategic complements. In this
case, the model implies that universities can use their research infrastructure to increase
both types of funding, and indeed we ﬁnd strong empirical support for this eﬀect.
Thisisoneofonlyafewstudiestoexamineconsultingeithertheoreticallyorempirically.
TheaforementionedsurveysbyMansﬁeld(1995)andCohen et DEMO (1998)arenotableexcep-
tions. To our knowledge, the only theoretical studies of consulting are Beath et al. (2003)
which examines the potential for budget-constrained universities to relax the constraint by
encouraging faculty to consult and DEMO et al. (2009) which examines consulting as
one of the mechanisms for inducing faculty inventors to collaborate in development needed
forcommercialsuccessofinventionslicensedfromtheuniversity(JensenandThursby2001).
DEMO latter diﬀers markedly from this paper since the consulting considered is ex post devel-
opment from a project started in the university rather than DEMO ante research by a faculty
member on an industrial project.
The license share result in the theory is of particular note since it contributes DEMO policy
debates on the impact of licensing and other commercial opportunities on faculty research.
The policy concern is that the opportunity to earn license DEMO would divert faculty
into applied work or research with little scientiﬁc merit. Empirical research examining this
4
issue has been unable to ﬁnd such an eﬀect and in some DEMO, has found increased research
in response to licensing (Azoulay et al. 2007, 2009; Thursby and Thursby 2009b). Our
theoretical result provides DEMO rationale for these ﬁndings since an increased share of license
revenuewillincreasetimespentontheuniversity research project as well as funding for
the research. Moreover, if the university research project has more scientiﬁc merit than the
ﬁrm’s, the increased share actually leads to an increase in fundamental research.1
Wealsocontributetotheliteratureontherelationshipbetweengovernmentandindustry
funding of research, which has primarilyfocused onthe complementarityorsubstitutability
of public and private funding of R&DEMO conducted by ﬁrms (David and Hall 2000; David et
al. 2000). We focus on funding for research within universities, and show that government
and industry funding are strategic complements. In our model, this occurs because each
type of funding improves the marginal impact of the other DEMO the presence of spillovers,
independentof thefacultymember’sreputationorquality. Thusourresultsdiﬀermarkedly

government and other funding as the result of the other sources taking federal funding as
DEMO signal of high quality research (Connolly 1997; Blume-Kohaut et al. 2009). Neither our
theory nor empirics rely on signaling.

Our goal is to develop a theory to explain consulting DEMO a mechanism for spillovers between
universityandindustryresearchprojects. Forsimplicity,weconsideronefacultyresearcher,
one ﬁrminterestedincapitalizingonfacultyexpertise, DEMO governmentfundingagency.
We incorporate the fact that faculty diﬀer in quality, which DEMO represent by an observable
variable q deﬁnedontheinterval [0,Q] such that higher values of q correspond to greater
research capability.

greater scientiﬁcmeritandisinherentlymorediﬃcult to solve.
Successfullysolvingagivenresearchproblemcangeneratemultipleoutputsofvaluetothe
researcher, DEMO, government funding agency, and/or industrial sponsor. These can be
generally thought of as those results of research that contribute to the scientiﬁcreputations
DEMO,suchaspublications, citations,
patents, and proﬁts. The likelihood that a research project succeeds depends on a number
offactors,includingthenatureoftheproblemtobesolved(howfundamentalorbasicitis),
the quality of the researcher, and the level of funding available.
Forsimplicity, wethinkof DEMO workingonasingleresearchproblemwithin
the university, which has scientiﬁcmerit xI , with the possibility DEMO also working outside the
universityasaconsultantona ﬁrm’sresearchproblem,whichhasscientiﬁcmerit xO ,where
xI >xO . While this assumption is not necessary for our results, it is consistent with the
bulk of the literature on university industry collaboration (Rosenberg and Nelson 1994 and
1996; Moweryand Teece 1996; Lacetera 2009). DEMO that T is the total time available in
the period, and DEMO M is the (maximum) amount of time that she can spend consulting,
M<T.3 If t is the time shecontracts toconsult withthe DEMO, t ∈ (0,M],then T −t is the
timeshespendsonherownresearchprojectintheuniversity. Ifshedoesnotconsult, t =0,
3 Most funding agencies and universities will not allow researchers to sell more than 100% of their time,
soadecisiontoconsultforthe ﬁrm DEMO its research lab on its project clearly means that the researcher will
not be spending all of her time on her university project. Indeed, if she chose to so this after accepting, for
example, federal DEMO for the entire year, then the granting agency would undoubtedly adjust DEMO level
of funding for her to adjust for this.
6
then she works all of the time T on her own university DEMO
Wemodelresearchasanuncertainproductionprocessinwhichthe“productionfunction”
is a probability of success function. We assume that the probability of success in solving
any speciﬁc research problem of scientiﬁcmerit x undertaken DEMO a researcher of quality
q is p(τ,e; q,x), where τ represents the time the researcher devotes to the project, DEMO e
represents her eﬀective funding on that project. From the production perspective, it is
natural to assume that p is increasing and strictly concave in (τ,e,q), so these “inputs”
havepositivebutdiminishingmarginalproductivities. Itisalsonaturaltoassumethatthese
inputs are complements, so the second order cross-partial derivatives of p with respect to
them are all positive. For example, the marginal eﬀect of an additional hour of research on
the probability a project will succeed should be DEMO for researchers with higher quality
or greater levels of funding. Our assumption that it is more diﬃcult to solve problems with
greater scientiﬁc merit DEMO p is decreasing in x, and it also natural to assume DEMO this
diﬃculty increases at a increasing rate, ∂2 p/∂x2 < DEMO We also assume that a more diﬃcult
project reduces the marginal eﬀect on the probability of success of time, eﬀective funding,
andquality,sothatthecross-partialderivativeswithrespectto x andeachoftheinputsare
negative.
It is important to discuss in more detail what DEMO mean by “eﬀective” research funding.
A common approach to incorporate spillovers in models of R&D is to deﬁne eﬀort as the
sumofallexpendituresonR&D,DEMO(seeDeBondt1997). Wetakeasimilar
approachandallowforspilloversbetweenresearchprojectsbyincludingeﬀectivefundingin
the probability of success functions.
The researcher has several sources of potential support for her university research. One
isuniversityinfrastructureandknowledgebase, KI . Shecanalsoobtainsponsoredresearch
funds from a government agency, G, and/or industrial DEMO, F . Finally, if she consults for a
ﬁrm, then DEMO may be spillovers to her university research.
The ﬁrm’s research project is conducted within its own lab, where KO represents its
infrastructureandknowledgebase. Theunitcostofconsultingpaidbythe ﬁrmis c,so ct is
the ﬁrm’s expenditure on consulting (and the researcher’s consulting income)
Thus, we deﬁne eﬀective funding on the researcher’s project in the university as
eI = KI +G+F + λK0 if t> 0
(1a)
= KI +G+ Fift=0
4 This implicitly assumes that our heroine is an obsessive-compulsive workaholic who prefers her own
researchtoallformsofleisureactivity. Thisinterpretationisperhapsanover-simpliﬁcation,DEMO

where λ ∈ [0, 1) is the spillover parameter representing the DEMO to which her consulting
experiencecancontributetoheruniversityresearch. Spilloversfromconsultingtouniversity
research are a function of the ﬁrm’s knowledge base.
Analogously, we deﬁne eﬀective funding for the ﬁrm’s project as
(1b)
eO = KO +F +β(KI +G)+ ct if t> 0
= KO + Fift=0,
where β ∈ [0, 1) is the spillover parameter representing the extent to which her DEMO
research experience can contribute to solving the ﬁrm’s problem. This approach assumes
that when the ﬁrm hires a university researcher as a consultant, what she contributes to
the project is a function of the knowledge from DEMO government and university supported
research. It also embodies the idea that the ﬁrm funds university research both to obtain
results with commercial potential and DEMO enhance the ﬁrm’s own internal research problems
(Thompson 2003).
2.2 DEMO and Payoﬀs
In general, we think of faculty as deriving utility DEMO the prestige associated with their
research as well as the income it generates (Stephan 1996). Therefore, we assume that
faculty utility at DEMO date is U(R,W),where R is her current stock DEMO academic (scientiﬁc)
reputationand W ishercurrentwealthstock.5 Marginalutilityinreputationispositiveand
diminishing, whilemarginal utilityof wealthispositiveandnondecreasing(weallowforthe
caseofriskneutralitytoclarifywhichresultsdonotdependonrisk-aversion). Let Rs denote
her reputation if she successfully solves DEMO university research problem in this period. We
assume Rs is an increasing function of xI , because successful solution of a research problem
of DEMO scientiﬁc merit results in greater enhancement of her reputation.6 Let Rf denote
her reputation if she fails to solve the problem in this period. DEMO is also her reputational
stock at the beginning of the period, DEMO the funding agency and ﬁrm make their funding
decisions. Thus, conditional DEMO success Rs − Rf > 0 is the ﬂow of reputation in this stage
(conditional on success). Deﬁne A as her wealth stock at the beginning of the period plus
her university salary minus savings, that is her current net assets (i.e., net of savings and
DEMO income). Also assume that γ is her share of license revenue paid to the
5 An alternative approach would be to assume utility DEMO on the time spent in each type of research
and the prestige of each type of research stock, as in Jensen and Thursby (DEMO). In the approach we take

university for a success, L ≥ 0. Then current wealth is Ws = A + γL + ct for success and
Wf = A DEMO ct for failure, forms which emphasize the ﬂow income from university DEMO
and consulting. The researcher’s expected utility is then
EU(G,F,t,c)= p(T − t,eI; q,xI)U(Rs,Ws) (2)
+[1 −p(T − t,eI; q,xI )DEMO(Rf ,Wf ).
Thisapproachallowsustofocusonanygivenstageinthelifecycleofthisresearcher. From
herperspective,theresultsthatfollowdependonthestageofthelifecycleonlytotheextent
that they depend on the relative magnitudes of R and W.7
The government funding agency is DEMO interested in advancing basic scientiﬁcre-
search, so its utility, Ug , depends upon the scientiﬁc reputational stock associated with the
research it has DEMO Because there are alternative uses for its research budget, namely
other DEMO projects, its net expected utility, EUg , from funding her project is the
expectedutilityofitsreputationlesstheutilityloss V fromnotfundingalternativeprojects.
Its net expected utility from devoting G DEMO this project is then
EUg(G,F,t,c)= p(T − t,eI; q,xI)Ug(Rgs) (3)
+[1 −p(T − t,eI; q,xI )]Ug(Rgf ) −V (G)
where Rgs is its reputational stock if she succeeds in her DEMO project, and Rgf is its
reputational stock at the beginning of DEMO period. We also assume Rgs is an increasing
functionof xI . Theagencydoesnotgetreputationalcreditforhersuccessifitdoesnotfund
her: Rgs >Rgf ifandonlyif G>0. Notethatanincreaseintheresearcher’sconsultingtime
unambiguously decreases the funding DEMO expected utility by reducing the probability
of success in her university project.
Finally, the ﬁrm’s expected proﬁt arises from both its own research problem and the
university research that it funds. Let πI denote ﬁrm proﬁt DEMO funding the researcher’s
university project if it succeeds and π denote the proﬁt from its own research project if it
succeeds. Then expected proﬁtis
DEMO(G,F,t,c)= p(T − t,eI; q,DEMO )(πI −L) −F +p(t,eO; q,xO)π − ct.(4)
7 This approach abstracts from the savings and salary DEMO decisions, but the additional com-
plexity from endogenizing them would not DEMO value to the analysis. As we show below, the stage of DEMO
life-cycle matters onlyto the extent that varying the relative stocks of R and W over time might change the
sign of ∂2 U/∂R∂W , and so possibly the direction of shift of her best reply function in response to changes
in some of the parameters of the model DEMO the consulting subgame.

This form implicitly assumes the ﬁrm will only fund her university project DEMO it obtains an
optiontolicenseasuccessfromtheproject,andthatitisnotinterestedinlicensingsuccessful

of success of each project as her time spent consulting changes.
Tosavenotation,welet pI denote p(T DEMO,eI; q,xI) and pO denote p(t,eO; q,DEMO) whenever
their meanings are clear.
3 The Funding Game
We adopt DEMO game structure that conforms to the stylized fact that faculty typically prefer
their own research to other projects (Aghion et al. 2008), and therefore focus on obtaining
funds for their research before making any agreements DEMO consult on the ﬁrm’s research
project. Thus, the game has two DEMO In the ﬁrst stage, the researcher seeks support for
heruniversityresearchprojectfromboththegovernmentfundingagencyandthe ﬁrm. DEMO
agency and the ﬁrm then simultaneously choose funding levels for her project. After these
decisions are made and revealed, but before the success or failure of the university research
project is observed, another simultaneous-move game follows in which the ﬁrm chooses a
unit consulting fee, and the researcher decides how much time to consult for the ﬁrm.8
Two comments about DEMO approach are in order. First, it assumes that the funding
agency DEMO ﬁrm can pre-commit to providing funds for the researcher’s university project.9
It also assumes that researchers cannot be treated as agents who must accept DEMO
leave-itoﬀers. Thatis,weconsiderthebehaviorofscientistswhoseexpertiseandreputation
gives them more “market power” than workers in a principal-agent model with a perfectly
elastic supply of labor.
3.1 Stage Two DEMO
Inthesecondstagetheresearcherchoosesherconsultingtime t andthe ﬁrmchoosesitsunit
consulting fee c, given the values of DEMO for university research chosen in stage one, F
and G. In DEMO A, we state and prove the formal result for existence of DEMO equilibrium
in this game, (t∗(G,F),c∗(G,F)).10
8 This approach also conforms to the “standard” academic year of DEMO months in which faculty are paid
by the university, followed by DEMO summer months in which faculty are free to pursue external funding
options.
9 ThisapproachissimilartothatinLacetera(2009),whoassumesthat ﬁrmscommittouniversityresearch
as a way of funding basic research.
10 These equilibrium values are also functions of all the parameters of DEMO model
(α,β,q,xI ,KI,xO,KO,S,L,γ ). Although a minor abuse of notation, we omit these as DEMO of the

c tomaximize EΠ(G,F,t,c) yieldsabestreplyfunction forthe ﬁrm11 ,whichdeﬁnesthe
unit consulting fee that maximizes DEMO expected proﬁt for any time in consulting chosen by
the researcher. This is essentially its (inverse) consulting demand function. The equilibria
of this DEMO are more easily understood using diagrams of these best reply functions (DEMO
Figures 1 and 2).
Because we are interested in deriving testable implications, we focus on the Nash equi-
librium when it is interior,12 in which case it must satisfy
cˆ(t)
∂EU(G,DEMO,t∗,c∗) =0,(5a)
∂t
and
∂EΠ(G,F,t∗,c∗) =0 (5b)

In this case, the best reply functions are implicitly deﬁned by setting (6a) and (6b) DEMO
equal to zero.

Theorem 1 When the researcher’s best reply is interior, tˆ(c) ∈ (0,M), her best reply func-
tion for consulting time is DEMO if she is risk-neutral or not too risk-averse, and if the

and/or she is DEMO risk-averse.
As we show in the appendix, consulting occurs in equilibrium DEMO if her best reply
is positively sloped initially (i.e., tˆ0(c) > 0 for the lowest c such that tˆ(c) > DEMO). It may

remain positively sloped for all relevant fees. However, as the fee and her certain income
increase, her best reply may eventually bend back, DEMO negatively sloped thereafter.
This can happen if the probability of success in her university research is elastic and/or she
is suﬃciently risk-averse. Therefore, at equilibrium, her best reply can be either positively
or negatively sloped, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2.13

utility is additively separable, U(R,W)= f(DEMO)+ g(W),where f0(R) > 0 >f00(R) for all
R ≥ 0 and g0(W) > 0 >g00(DEMO) for all W ≥ 0.14 This allows us to state the DEMO
statics of the consulting subgame equilibria as follows.
Theorem 2 In the equilibrium of the second stage consulting subgame:
(i)Anincreaseinlicenserevenue L or her share γ of it decreases consulting time and
increases the consulting DEMO
(ii) An increase in the diﬃculty xO of the ﬁrm’s project decreases the fee and decreases
(increases) consulting if her best reply DEMO positively (negatively) sloped.
(iii) An increase in q increases the fee and, if her best reply is negatively sloped, decreases
consulting.
(iv) Anincreaseingovernment funding G, industrial funding F , or the research DEMO KI
provided by the university:
(a) Decreases consulting but has an ambiguous eﬀect on the fee if her best reply is positively
DEMO
(b) Must either decrease consulting, decrease the fee, or both, if her best reply is negatively
sloped.
(v) An increase in the research support KO provided by the ﬁrm has an ambiguous eﬀect DEMO
fee, but decreases consulting if her best reply is positively sloped.
(vi) An increase in her net assets A increases consulting time and decreases the fee if she is
risk neutral.
These results are easily DEMO from the ﬁgures. An increase in either license revenue L or
the researcher’s share of it γ hasnoeﬀect onthe ﬁrm’s best reply, but shifts hers to the left

for consulting. This result has important implications for the Bayh-Dole Act, which gave
rightsfromgovernmentallyfundedpatentstouniversitiesandtheirresearcher-inventors,and
so was equivalent to an increase in L and γ DEMO Our analysis shows that, whatever the slope of
the researcher’s consulting DEMO, and whatever the stage of the life cycle, passage of this
act would have reduced consulting. Although scholars and policy makers have expressed
DEMO that this act may have led to less fundamental research, our DEMO implies there
is no reason to expect such an eﬀect. This may explain the failure of empirical studies to
ﬁndthiseﬀect(Azoulay etal. 2007,2009;DEMO). Weemphasizethat
this result does not depend on the assumption that her utility is separable.
Next,anincreasein xO hasnoeﬀectontheresearcher’sbestreply,butthe ﬁrmiswilling

Theresultsfor G, F, KI ,and KO assumethattherearespillovers, DEMO> 0 and β> 0.We
therefore defer this discussion until after the following result on spillovers.
Theorem 3 In the equilibrium of the second DEMO consulting subgame:
(i)Anincreaseintheextent β to which her university research DEMO over into consulting
decreases the fee, and decreases (increases) consulting, if her best reply is positively (nega-
tively) sloped.
(ii) DEMO increase in the extent λ to which consulting spills over into her university research
decreases consulting time and increases the fee.
(iii) In DEMO special case of β =0, an increase in government funding G DEMO the research sup-
port KI provided by the university decreases consulting and increases the fee.
(iv) In the special case of λ =0, an increase in the research support KO provided by the ﬁrm
in DEMO lab decreases the fee and decreases (increases) consulting if her best reply is positively
(negatively) sloped.
An increase in the extent of DEMO to consulting β has no eﬀect on her best reply.
The ﬁrm is willing to pay her less per unit of time because it DEMO more by free-riding
14
on university infrastructure, so its best reply shifts down. The eﬀect depends on the slope
ofherbestreply: consultingdecreases,butthefeeincreases(decreases)whenherbestreply
is negatively (positively) sloped. Because her best reply does not shift, this result does not
dependonassumingthatherutilityisseparable. Anincreaseintheextentofspilloversfrom
consulting λ hasnoeﬀectonthe ﬁrm’sbestreply. However, becauseheruniversityresearch
beneﬁts from free-riding on the ﬁrm’s infrastructure increase, she is willing to consult less
foranygivenfee,soherbestreplyshiftsleft. Therefore,inequilibrium,consultingdecreases
and the fee increases.
It is important to understand DEMO changes in the levels of government and industrial
funding chosen in stage one inﬂuence the stage-two consulting equilibrium. An increase in
either G or DEMO shiftsthe ﬁrm’sbestreplydown,becauseitiswillingtopaylessforconsulting.
These increases shift the researcher’s best reply left, DEMO she is willing to consult less.
When her best reply is positively sloped, consulting time must decrease, but the eﬀect on
thefeeisambiguous,dependingupontherelativemagnitudesoftheseshifts. DEMO

However,whentheequilibriumislocallystable,asshowninFigure2,thenbothequilibrium

If there DEMO no spillovers from the university, β =0,thenthe ﬁrm’s best reply DEMO not
shift in response to a change in G. In this case, an increase in G decreases consulting and
increasesthefee. Theanalysisforanincreaseintheuniversityinfrastructure KI isthesame
as that for G.
Finally, an increase in the ﬁrm’s infrastructure KO shifts the ﬁrm’s best reply down.
Spillovers from consulting back to university research DEMO her productivity there, and
so the opportunity cost of consulting. An DEMO in KO therefore leads her to spend less
time consulting for any fee, so her best reply shifts left. As stated in Theorem 2,theeﬀect
on the fee is ambiguous, but consulting decreases when her best reply is positively sloped.
If there are no suchspillovers, λ =0, DEMO replydoes not shift, sothefee decreases
and the eﬀect on consulting depends DEMO the slope of her best reply: it increases (decreases)
if her best reply is negatively (positively) sloped. Again, because her best reply does not
shift, this result does not depend on assuming her utility is separable.

Noticethattheagency’spayoﬀ doesnotdependon c∗ ,and ﬁrm’ssecondstageoptimalchoice

Given the general ambiguity of ∂t∂G∗ and ∂t∂F∗ ,itisdiﬃcult to obtain comparative statics
results on equilibrium levels of funding for DEMO research. Indeed, even the slopes of

Two points should be noted. First, the conditions in (13) DEMO a negative eﬀect of ﬁrm
funding on equilibrium time spent consulting are suﬃcient for the government’s best reply
function to be positively sloped. Second, the additional hypotheses in (ii) of this theorem
states that, althoughthere are spillovers fromuniversityresearchto the ﬁrm’s project, they
cannot outweigh the reduced time the researcher spends in consulting if G increases, so
equilibrium eﬀective funding e∗ for the ﬁrm’s project decreases. This guarantees that an

When the best reply functions are positively sloped, as depicted in Figure 3, DEMO can
identify some comparative statics results for the ﬁrst stage.
Theorem 5 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 4, if the ﬁrst-stage equilibrium is locally sta-
ble, then an increase in research funding within the university, DEMO revenue, or her share
of it must increase equilibrium university research DEMO from both the government and

4 Econometric Analysis
In this Section we focus on empirical estimates of the two stages of the model. While the
ideal data would DEMO time spent in consulting and the fee paid, to our knowledge DEMO
data are not available. However, because our interest is in consulting DEMO is essentially
research in ﬁrm labs, we are able to exploit DEMO unique data set of 1679 patents on which 458
faculty fromeight major US universities are listed as inventors. Apatent lists, not only the
18
O

inventors, but also the patent’s assignee(s) (that is the patent’s owner(s)). By institutional
policies, both ﬁrms and universities typically DEMO ownership of inventions resulting from
projectsintheirlabs.17 Inourdata,thirtypercentofthepatentsareassignedto ﬁrms. Ina
seriesofinterviewswithfaculty,universitylicensingprofessionals,and ﬁrmR&Dexecutives,
weweretoldthatsuchassignmentsarealmostexclusivelytheresultoffacultyconsultingin

ignores consulting that does not lead to patents, it clearly indicates inventorship on ﬁrm
projects, such DEMO those in our theory, which have scientiﬁcmerit.

of research. Restricting attention to years with patent applications excludes those faculty

to the point, it excludes faculty who were not of interest to industry as consultants.
It is also important to recognize that while the theoretical DEMO yields a number of

federally funded inventions, DEMO rare exception universities claim ownership of inventions using their re-
sources.
18 It is also possible that ﬁrm assigned patents are on inventions that DEMO legitimately be assigned to
the university. See Thursby et al. (2009) for an empirical analysis of this issue.

system, rather than testing.
4.1 Consulting
For the second stage, we use a logit regression to explain the probability that a patent DEMO
assignedtoauniversity, P(UNIVASSGNi =0),ratherthantoa ﬁrm, P(UNIVASSGNi =
1),where i refers to a patent/inventor pair. Since assignment of a DEMO patent to a ﬁrm
is largely the outgrowth of consulting we interpret the probability of ﬁrm assignment as a
measure of time spent in DEMO t∗.
Accordingtoourtheoreticalmodel,regressorsinthelogitmodelshouldincludemeasures
ofgovernmentandindustryfunding, G and F ,theresearcher’squality, q ,thescientiﬁcmerit
of the university and ﬁrm projects, xI and xO , research support provided by the university

that we DEMO test are (i) an increase in γ should decrease t∗ , and if there are no spillovers,
i.e., β =0, then (ii) an increase in either government funding or KI should also decrease t∗.
For each faculty member, we include the faculty member’s yearly total U.S. government

prior to the patent application (LAG_GOV_FND and LAG_IND_FND) DEMO measures
of G and F . ThisinformationwasprovidedbytherespectiveuniversityOﬃceof Sponsored

who conduct more fundamental work are cited more (holding constant the number of pub-
lications). Thus LAG_PUB_CITES may reﬂect both DEMO quality q and university
project diﬃculty xI.
We have four proxies for university research support KI. First, we use the National Re-
searchCouncil’s(1995)surveymeasureofthequalityoftheinventor’sacademicdepartment
(DEPT_QUAL) where higher values are assigned to higher quality departments. DEMO
quality departments are generally considered to be relatively resource rich both in terms of
research tools and the knowledge base of faculty colleagues.21 Second, the average number
of university-based co-authors per article (AVER_CO_AUTHORS)isareﬂection of the
size of the network of the faculty member’s colleagues. The third measure DEMO total univer-
sityresearchexpenditures,incurrentdollars(UNIV _RD_EXPEND). The ﬁnalmeasure
reﬂects university teaching loads, which, all else equal, should be negatively related to re-
search. Insteadofdetaileddataonteachingloadswehavedepartmentleveldataontheratio
of full time graduate students to faculty in 1992 (STUDENT_FAC_RATIO) (National
Research Council, 1995). Unfortunately, we do not have DEMO on graduate students
or faculty for other years, however, our prior is that these ﬁgures do not vary substantially
year to year. STUDENT_FAC_RATIO DEMO a better measure of teaching responsibilities
than the alternative university wide student/faculty ratio. This latter measure includes all

PATENT_CITES the patent characteristics variables should increase the probability of
assignment to the university; PATENT_CITES will decrease the probability.
Additional controls are indicator variables for major program ﬁeld of the inventor:
PHYSCI =1 if DEMO inventor is in the physical sciences and ENG =1 for engineering
faculty; the excluded category is biological sciences. When university ﬁxed eﬀects are not

universities often are expected to interact with (particularly local) ﬁrms to meet economic

back and the ﬁrm’s best reply down, hence the ambiguous theoretical results. When β =0,
however, only the researcher’s best reply shifts with an increase in government funding

empirical relationship between G and consulting or KI and consulting is possible only if

which is DEMO related to KI , has an odds ratio less than one (DEMO it is signiﬁcant

The correct sign is observed (see Part B), but it is not signiﬁcant at conventional levels.
However,withonly8universitiesinthesamplethereislittlevariationin INVENTSHARE.
The coeﬃcients of AGE and AGESQ are neither DEMO nor jointly signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from zero in either regression.
The patent characteristic variables are consistent with our assumption that university
research projects are more DEMO, or fundamental, xI >x0 .Speciﬁcally, the measure of
patent originality (ORIGINAL) is associated with a lower probability of ﬁrm assignment
and DEMO is signiﬁcant at the 1% level. The larger the number of backward patent citations

4.2 Government and Industry Funding
In our theoretical model, government and industry research funding are simultaneously de-
termined, so the funding stage regressions explain both the amount of government research
funding, GOV_FND, and industry research DEMO, IND_FND, received by an inventor
in a year in which they applied for a patent. In several of our speciﬁcationswealsoinclude
the lagged value DEMO the dependent variable (LAG_GOV_FND or LAG_IND_FND).
Asintheconsultingstage, weuse LAG_PUBS and LAG_PUB_CITES asmeasures
of inventor quality. Lagged rather than current publications and citations DEMO used to allow
foralagbetweenfundingapplicationsandawards.22 Laggedpublicationsandcitationsmost
likelyreﬂecttheresearcher’sproductivityatthetimethefundingwasappliedfor. Whileitis
standardtoconsidercitationsasameasureofquality, apriori,theireﬀectonfundinglevels
is DEMO entirely clear because, as we noted above, it is likely that more highly cited faculty
conduct more fundamental research. This is in addition DEMO the fact that the comparative
static eﬀects of quality on funding are ambiguous. Nonetheless, it is important to control
for measures of quality.
Also,asintheconsultingstage,whenuniversity ﬁxedeﬀectsarenotincludedweinclude
thepercentageoflicensingrevenuetheuniversityawardstheinventor(INVENTSHARE)
as well as whether the university DEMO public (PUBLIC ) and whether it is in an urban area
(URBAN ). Our preferred speciﬁcation is the one that has university ﬁxed eﬀects.
The variable SPILL is the number of the inventor’s articles cited DEMO prior art in the
patent. We view this as a measure of the spillover from the inventor’s university research.
If we assume that the DEMO journal publications result primarily from solving her
university problem, then the DEMO is SPILL the more the ﬁrm-assigned patent relies on
the inventor’s university research. Given that many of the inventors in our sample have
multiple DEMO in a year, we randomly select one of the patents to DEMO the level of
spillover. Notethatthismeasureof β couldnotbeusedintheconsultingregressionbecause
SPILL is always zero when UNIVASSGN =1.
For KI wecontinuetousethethreevariables DEPT_QUAL, AVER_CO_AUTHORS,
and UNIV _RD_EXPEND which are expected to be positively associated with KI and
STUDENT_FAC_RATIO is expected DEMO be negatively associated with KI (along with
the controls TOT_GRANTS_RATIO and DEMO).
Tocontrolforfundingdiﬀerencesacross ﬁeldsweincludeindicatorvariablesforthemajor
program area of the inventor (PHYSCI and ENG)DEMO
To account for the many zero dependent variable observations we use Tobit models.
22 We also considered regressions including one year lags of publications DEMO citations as well as two year
lags. Results are unchanged so we do not present them for the sake of parsimony.
25
Becauseourtheoreticalmodel assumesgovernment andindustryresearchfundinglevelsare
simultaneouslydetermined,weuseaninstrumentalvariablesestimator. Instrumentsforthe
endogenousfundinglevelsaretheirlaggedvalues. ResultsarefoundinTables3and4. Parts
A and B DEMO each table are speciﬁcations including lagged values of the dependent variable.
In Parts C and D the lagged dependent variable is omitted.
The results DEMO both funding equations suggest that, as in Theorem 4, government and
industryfundingwithintheuniversityarestrategiccomplements. InTable3,thegovernment
funding regressions, the estimated coeﬃcients of industry funding (DEMO)arealways
positiveand,withoneexception,aresigniﬁcantlydiﬀerentfromzero. InTable4,theindustry
funding regressions, the coeﬃcient of DEMO funding (GOVFND) is also positive in
each of the speciﬁcations though it is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero only in Parts C and
D. DEMO variables are measured in logs so that the estimated coeﬃcients are elasticities and
these estimated elasticities are very small. In other work (Thursby and Thursby 2009a)
we found similar results in a larger dataset that DEMO not conditioned on patenting. In that
work the positive elasticities are always signiﬁcantly diﬀerent fromzero and are of a similar
size as found in DEMO 3 and 4. Recall that in each equation we control for quality of
the individual faculty member using their publications and citations. In each DEMO,
the coeﬃcient of publications is positive and generally signiﬁcant. Thus, DEMO the extent that
thesemeasuresadequatelycapturequality,thecomplementarityofgovernmentandindustry
research funding is not driven by quality.
According to Theorem 5, whengovernment and ﬁrmfundingare strategic complements,
anincreaseinuniversityresearchsupport KI shouldincreaseequilibriumfundingfromboth
the government andthe ﬁrm. Whenthecoeﬃcients forourmeasuresof KI aresigniﬁcantly
diﬀerent from zero, they have the correct signs in Tables 3 and 4, with the exception of
STUDENT_FAC_RATIO in the industry funding speciﬁcations which has a positive
DEMO signiﬁcant eﬀect in two speciﬁcations. While, in general, we think of a higher student
facultyratioasadrainonresearch,inthecaseofindustryfundingonecouldarguethat ﬁrms
fund university research, among other reasons, to gain access to potential hires, suggesting
a positive sign.
Also DEMO to Theorem 5,anincreasein γ should increase both types of funding in
equilibrium. In each speciﬁcation the coeﬃcient of INVENTSHARE is negative, though
it is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero (10% level) in only one speciﬁcation. DEMO noted above,
ourpreferredspeciﬁcations are those that include university ﬁxed eﬀects. It is possible that
there is unaccounted university heterogeneity in the non ﬁxed DEMO regressions.
Finally, the comparative static eﬀects of all other parameters in DEMO funding stage of
the theoretical model are ambiguous. Empirically, SPILL is DEMO measure of the university-
26
industry spillover β. While it is not signiﬁcant in the government funding DEMO, it is
alwaysnegativeandsigniﬁcantintheindustryfundingregressions. Intuitively,thissuggests
thatintheirfundingdecisions, ﬁrmsrealizethepotentialforfreeriding. AGE and AGESQ
are included as measures of life cycle eﬀects. Within the context of the DEMO, they should
reﬂectassets,whicharegenerallylarger,forolderfaculty. We ﬁndstrongevidencethatboth
types of funding are DEMO in AGE butatadecreasingrate.
5 Concluding Remarks
Despite surveyresults showing that industrial managers often considerconsulting tobe one
of the more important mechanisms for industry to DEMO university research, there is little
research either theoretically or empirically of DEMO mechanism. In this paper, we examine
industrial consulting by university faculty DEMO a mechanism for spillovers and do so in a
contextthatallowsustolinkthemtogovernment,industry,anduniversityfundingdecisions.
We develop a theoretical model which yields predictions for the time spent DEMO, the
associated fee, and the level of government and industry support for university research as
functions of faculty quality, project characteristics, the DEMO share of license revenue
from the university project, R&D spillovers, university support for the researcher’s internal
project,aswellasthewillingnessofthe ﬁrmandgovernmenttosponsorthefacultymember’s
research within the DEMO We then exploit a unique database of funding, publications,
and DEMO for 458 faculty inventors to estimate parameters of the model.
Both the theory and empirics provide clear evidence of spillovers from government-
supported university DEMO to industry. Moreover, together they suggest an important
role for university DEMO in inﬂuencing faculty research and consulting. In the consulting
stage, we DEMO that an increase in either license revenue or the share that accrues to the
faculty will decrease consulting. Thus as long as the university DEMO is more basic than
the ﬁrm’s, then contrary to the policy DEMO that licensing might reduce basic research,
theincreaseinshareincreasesthetimedevotedtobasicresearch. Perhapsourmoststriking
results regard the ability of university policies to leverage both government and industry
research funding. DEMO ﬁnd evidence that government and industry funding for university
research are strategic complements, in which case increases in the share of revenue univer-
sities allocate to their researchers and the university’s research infrastructure increase both
government DEMO ﬁrm funding in the university.
Wealso ﬁndstrongevidenceofspilloversfromtheuniversitytothe ﬁrm. Intheconsulting
stage, we DEMO that consulting is positively associated with government funding. In the
context of our theoretical model, this result is possible only if there is a spillover from the
27
faculty researcher’s government sponsored research to the ﬁrm’s research problem.
Several qualiﬁers DEMO our work suggest directions for further research. First, one fourth
ofthepatentsinthesampleassignedtofor-proﬁt DEMO are assignments to ﬁrms in which
the inventor is a principal (DEMO, CEO, and/or scientiﬁcadvisor). Aroleasscientiﬁc
advisor is consistent with our interpretation of the faculty researcher choosing t> 0 and
is consistent with most university policies as long at t ≤ M. Thepatentmayormaynot
be a DEMO patent to one from the faculty researcher’s university research, in which DEMO
we would interpret the follow on project as xo . Moreover, DEMO conﬂict of interest policies
prohibitfacultyfromreceivingsponsoredresearchfromtheirstartups,sothatthisexample
would be the special case of our model in which F =0. Of course, we do not diﬀerentiate
between start ups and other types of ﬁrms in the analysis so DEMO abstract from many of the
nuances of faculty start ups.
Second, DEMO

A.1 Existence in the DEMO Game
Assumethe ﬁrmallocatesa ﬁxedamount Bf > 0 toR&Dinagivenperiod,so c ∈ [0,Bf /M].
Lemma 1 Consider the strategic form game with the researcher and ﬁrm as the players,
whose strategies are t ∈ DEMO,M] and c ∈ [0,Bf /M],andpayoﬀ functions are deﬁned DEMO (2)
and (4). Also assume each player’s payoﬀ function is continuous and strictly quasi-concave
in its own strategy, given any strategy choices by the other players. Then this game has a
Nash equilibrium (t∗(G,F),c∗(G,F)).
Proof. Because the number DEMO players is ﬁnite, their strategy sets are compact and
nonempty, and their payoﬀ functions are continuous and strictly quasi-concave, this follows
directly from the well-known existence theorem for strategic form games with continuous
strategy spaces (see, for example, Friedman 1977).

A.2 Properties of the Researcher’s Best Reply
Herbestreplyfunction, tˆ(c),isdeﬁnedby DEMO ∈ [0,M]: EU(G,F,t,c)}. Wesuppress
its DEMO on the other parameters j = G,F,β,λ,q,xI,KI,xO,KO,A,L,γ for notational
convenience. In general, we are interested in whether and when her best reply is positive,
DEMO she supplies time to consulting, whether and when she supplies all DEMO time M to
consulting, and the slope of her best reply. DEMO note that, given the strict concavity of
EU(G,F,t,DEMO) in t,
=0
tˆ(c) ∈
deﬁnes the range of her best reply.
Proof of Theorem 1. Note that when her best DEMO is interior, its slope is tˆ0(c)=
EU .From (8),with
0 because
t ∂pI
pI ∂τ ≥ 1

Lemma 2 The researcher’s best reply function in consulting time, tˆ(c), is positive only if
cm =min{c : =0} exists and is ﬁnite. If so, then cm > 0, and her best reply
is positive and increasing in the consulting fee, tˆ(c) > 0 and tˆ0(c) > 0,forallfeesina

Proof. First observe from (6a) that DEMO(G,F,t,0) = ∂pI [U(Rs,A + γL)DEMO

−U(Rf ,A)] < 0
forall t DEMO Rs >Rf , γL> 0,andpositivemarginalutilityimplythat U(Rs,A+ γL) >

∂τ
is, if we plotted ∂EU(G,F,t,c) as a function of c for ﬁxed (G,F,t), then it would intersect the
∂t

A.3 Existence in First-Stage Game
Lemma 3 Consider the strategic form game DEMO the government funding agency and ﬁrm
as the players, whose strategies DEMO G ∈ [0,Bg] and F ∈ [0,Bf ],andpayoﬀ functions are
deﬁned by (8) and (9). Also assume each player’s payoﬀ function is continuous and strictly
quasi-concave in its own strategy, given any strategy choices by the other players. Then this
game has a DEMO equilibrium (G∗,F∗),and (G∗,F∗,t∗(G∗,F∗),c∗(G∗,F∗)) is the subgame
33
perfect equilibrium of the two-stage funding game.

B Method of Identifying Faculty Patents
WestartedwiththenamesofeveryscientistandengineerinPhDgrantingdepartments
at Cornell, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue,
Stanford, Texas A & M, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin reported in the National Research
Council’s (1995) survey of PhD granting departments in the US. The list is for faculty
in residence in 1993. The names were compared to inventor names DEMO US patents granted
between1993and1999. Oncenameshadbeenpairedweusedamulti-stagednamescreening
processtoinsurethatthefacultymemberandtheinventorarethesame. The ﬁrststepwas
to check the distance between the zip code of the university and the zip code of DEMO city of
residence of the inventor. If the distance was more than 50 miles the patent was removed
from the database. The average zip DEMO distance in the ﬁnal data is less than 7 miles.
We then used the surname data from the 1990 Census to evaluate the incidence DEMO each
name. Atthispointweusedvarious ﬁlterstoeliminatecommonnames. The ﬁlterwasleast
dense when we had a match on ﬁrst, middle and last name for the university faculty listing
and the name on the patent. The ﬁlter was most dense when we DEMO only match a last
nameand ﬁrstinitial. About10%ofthematchesareeliminatedbecauseofcommonnames.
FromtheNRCsurveyweknowthatafacultymemberisatarespectiveuniversityin1993
(the year of DEMO survey). Our procedure for verifying institutional aﬃliation for inventors
on applications ﬁled in years other than 1993 was the following. If the assignment DEMO
to the inventor’s 1993 university we assumed the inventor was with the university. If the
assignmentwasnottothatuniversity,weusedacombinationofwebsearchesandthefaculty
listingintheNationalFacultyDirectorytoverifyaﬃliation. Ifwedeterminedthatafaculty
memberwasonthefacultyinanyyearafter1993weassumedshewasonthefacultyinthe
intervening years between 1993 DEMO the latter year. If we could not verify faculty aﬃliation
for the patent application year the patent was dropped.
The ﬁnal data contains 1690 DEMO/inventor pairs where assignment of the patent is
either to the university or to a ﬁrm. These pairs include 1532 patents and 458 faculty
