The primary purpose of this article is to clarify the nature of DEMO en-
trepreneurial orientation (EO) construct and to propose a contingency
framework for investigating the relationship between EO and firm
performance. We first explore DEMO refine the dimensions of EO and
discuss the usefulness of viewing a firm's EO as a multidimensional
construct. Then, drawing on examples from the EO-related contingen-
cies literature, we suggest alternative models (moderating effects,DEMO
mediating effects, independent effects, interaction effects) for testing
the EO-performance DEMO
For both start-up ventures and existing firms, entrepreneurship car-
ried on DEMO the pursuit of business opportunities spurs business expansion,
technological progress, DEMO wealth creation. Entrepreneurial activity rep-
resents one of the major engines of economic growth and today accounts
for the majority of new business development DEMO job creation in the
United States (Business Week, 1993). As such, writers in both the scholarly
literature (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1991) and popular press (e.g., Peters &
Waterman, 1982) have argued that entrepreneurship is an essential fea-
ture of high-performing firms.
DEMO scholars have developed numerous typologies to
describe alternate perspectives of entrepreneurship (DEMO, Cooper &
Dunkelberg, 1986; Schollhammer, 1982; Webster, 1977)DEMO These classifica-
tion systems typically depict differences in entrepreneurship as the result
of various combinations of individual, organizational, or environmental
factors that influence DEMO and why entrepreneurship occurs as it does.
Although these efforts have served to point out the various dimensions of
the entrepreneurial process, they have not led to any widely held consen-
sus regarding how to characterize DEMO This lack of consen-
sus has impeded progress for researchers toward building and testing a
broader theory of entrepreneurship, and has made it especially difficult

for them to investigate the relationship DEMO entrepreneurship to perfor-
mance.
To address this problem, this article draws DEMO prior theory and re-
search to make a distinction between the concepts of entrepreneurship
and "entrepreneurial orientation." The distinction is comparable to the
DEMO made in the strategic management literature between content and
process (Bourgeois, 1980). The early strategy literature equated entrepre-
neurship with going into DEMO, and the basic "entrepreneurial prob-
lem" (Miles & Snow, DEMO) was to address the principal question of strat-
egy content, that is, "What business shall we enter?" The answer to this
DEMO determined a firm's domain and guided its product-market rela-
tionships and resource deployments. As the field of strategic manage-
ment developed, however, DEMO emphasis shifted to entrepreneurial pro-
cesses, that is, the methods, DEMO, and decision-making styles
managers use to act entrepreneurially. These include such DEMO as
experimenting with promising new technologies, being willing to seize
new DEMO opportunities, and having a predisposition to un-
dertake risky ventures. The DEMO has been to use concepts from the strat-
egy-making process literature to model firm-level entrepreneurship
(Covin & Slevin, 1989, 1991; Miller, 1983). Five dimensions-autonomy,
innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressive-
ness-have been useful for characterizing and distinguishing key entre-
preneurial processes, that is, a firm's entrepreneurial orientation (EO).
They do not, however, represent entrepreneurship, which is defined here
as new entry. That DEMO, new entry explains what entrepreneurship consists
of, and entrepreneurial orientation describes how new entry is under-
taken.
The essential act of entrepreneurship is DEMO entry. New entry can be
accomplished by entering new or established markets with new or exist-
ing goods or services. New entry is the DEMO of launching a new venture,
either by a start-up firm, DEMO an existing firm, or via "internal corpo-
rate venturing" (Burgelman, 1983). New entry is thus the central idea un-
derlying the concept of entrepreneurship. Evidence of this is suggested by
the large portion DEMO research on entrepreneurship that is devoted to ex-
plaining the corollaries and consequences of new venture activity (e.g.,
Hisrich & Peters, 1989; MacMillan & Day, 1987; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987;
Stuart & Abetti, 1987; Vesper, 1980, 1988; Webster, 1977). Although DEMO
concept of entrepreneurship as new entry is itself a topic brimming with
issues and research questions, in this article we are chiefly concerned
with EO, a corollary concept that emerged primarily from the strategic
management literature.
An EO refers to the processes, practices, and decision-making activ-
ities DEMO lead to new entry. It emerges from a strategic-choice perspective
(Child, 1972), which asserts that new-entry opportunities can be success-
fully undertaken DEMO "purposeful enactment" (Van de Ven & Poole, 1995).
Thus, it involves the intentions and actions of key players functioning in
1996

and Dess

a dynamic generative process aimed at new-venture DEMO The key
dimensions that characterize an EO include a propensity to act autono-
mously, a willingness to innovate and take risks, and a DEMO to be
aggressive toward competitors and proactive relative to marketplace op-
portunities.
All of these factors-autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proac-
tiveness, and DEMO aggressiveness-may be present when a firm
engages in new entry. In contrast, successful new entry also may be
achieved when only some of these factors are operating. That is, the
extent to which each of these dimensions is useful for predicting the
nature and success of a new DEMO may be contingent on external
factors, such as the industry or DEMO environment, or internal factors,
such as the organization structure (in the case of an existing firm) or the
characteristics of founders or top managers. Thus, although some prior
research suggests that the dimensions of an EO covary (e.g., Covin &
Slevin, 1989), we DEMO that autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, pro-
activeness, and competitive aggressiveness may vary independently, de-
pending on the environmental and organizational context. This is consis-
tent with Gartner's (1985: 697) perspective regarding new venture
formation:
The creation of a new venture is a multidimensional DEMO
enon; each variable describes only a single dimension of the
phenomenon DEMO cannot be taken alone . .. entrepreneurs
and their firms vary widely; the actions they take or do not
take and the environments they operate in and respond to are
equally diverse-and all these elements form DEMO and
unique combinations in the creation of each new venture.
In this article, therefore, we argue that (a) the relationship between EO
DEMO performance is context specific and (b) the dimensions of EO may
vary independently of each other in a given context.
The purpose of DEMO article is to provide an integrative framework for
exploring the relationship between EO and performance by integrating
prior theory and empirical findings into a DEMO whole. To this
end, we first endeavor to delineate and refine DEMO dimensions of EO.
Then, consistent with Stinchcombe's (1965) caveat DEMO the impor-
tance of organizational and environmental factors to the success of new
entrants, we propose a contingency framework. Accordingly, the two in-
DEMO objectives of this article are (a) to clarify the nature of the
entrepreneurial orientation construct and (b) to suggest a contingency
approach DEMO frame research questions and further researchers' under-
standing of EO-performance relationships.
DEMO moving on, we briefly address level-of-analysis consider-
ations. The concept of DEMO has been applied to many differ-
ent levels, for example, individuals, groups, and "whole organizations."
One of the reasons there has been little agreement on the nature of
138
Academy of Management Review

entrepreneurship and how it contributes to DEMO is because the
term is used in the context of various levels of analysis. Entrepreneurship
often is thought to be within the purview of DEMO only, because it is
frequently associated with the introduction of a DEMO invention
(Kilby, 1971). It is also considered by some theorists to apply primarily to
the domain of small businesses because they are DEMO for the
majority of economic growth and new-job creation via entry into untapped
markets (Birch, 1979). Recently, there has also been an emphasis on cor-
porate entrepreneurship as a means of growth and strategic DEMO for
existing larger firms (Guth & Ginsberg, 1990). Thus, DEMO is important to
consider the level of analysis that is used in discussing the EO construct.
New entry as the essential act of entrepreneurship DEMO primarily a
firm-level phenomenon. It is analogous to a business-level strategy un-
dertaken by a nondiversified economic unit. Thus, new entry refers to
actions that may be initiated by an individual, a small firm, or DEMO stra-
tegic business unit of a large corporation. As such, this DEMO of
entrepreneurial orientation will focus at the firm/business-unit level. This
firm-level approach is consistent with classical economics in which the
individual entrepreneur is DEMO as a firm. The small business firm is
simply an extension of the individual who is in charge. Applying EO to
the nondiversified business DEMO is also consistent with Schumpeter
(1942), who shifted attention away DEMO the individual entrepreneur by
arguing that entrepreneurship eventually would be dominated by firms
that were capable of devoting more resources to innovation. Addressing
EO DEMO the firm level corresponds to the model used in recent work by
Covin and Slevin (1991), who emphasized the role of entrepreneurship as
firm behavior. In the examples that follow, we have used both small
corporations and strategic business units (SBUs) to illustrate EO concepts.
The DEMO of this article is divided into four sections. First, we
explore DEMO relevant theoretical and empirical literature that relates to the
dimensions of an entrepreneurial orientation. Second, we discuss key
contingencies that often are associated with the EO-performance relation-
ship. Third, alternate contingency models will be suggested for investi-
gating the performance implications of EO relationships. For illustrative
purposes, several examples of contingent relationships suggested by the
literature are proposed in this DEMO In the final section, we suggest
avenues for further theory development DEMO empirical research, and we
discuss how our proposed framework may be DEMO in explaining differ-
ences in entrepreneurial behavior and performance across firms.
DIMENSIONS
OF AN ENTREPRENEURIAL
ORIENTATION
Prior researchers have suggested that there is a DEMO of organizational
processes from which strategic decisions evolve (Hart, 1992; DEMO,
Rasheed, & Datta, 1993). These take the form of patterns or modes that can
be characterized and identified across organizations (Hart, 1992). The
1996
Lumpkin
and Dess
139
dimensions of a firm's strategy-making processes DEMO be viewed as en-
compassing the entire range of organizational activities that involve
planning, decision making, and strategic management. Such processes
also encompass DEMO aspects of the organization's culture, shared value
system, and corporate vision (Hart, 1992; Pascale, 1985). In attempting to
identify DEMO variables that are relevant to organizational modes and mod-
els of strategic decision processes, many researchers have focused on
delineating the dimensions of strategy making. For example, Miller and
Friesen (1978) identified 11 strategy-making process dimensions, includ-
ing adaptiveness, analysis, integration, risk taking, and product-market
innovation. In his study of structural influences on decision-making pro-
cesses, Fredrickson (1986) proposed dimensions such as proactiveness,
rationality, comprehensiveness, risk DEMO, and assertiveness. Hart's
(1992) integrative framework for strategy-making processes DEMO var-
ious dimensions into five "distinctive modes of strategy making": DEMO
mand, symbolic, rational, transactive, and generative. Miles and Snow
(DEMO) considered multidimensional aspects of organizational processes to
formulate a typology that DEMO prospectors, defenders, analyzers, and
reactors.
In a similar vein, we believe there is a fundamental set of strategy-
making process (SMP) DEMO that underlies nearly all entrepreneurial
processes. The study of a firm's entrepreneurial orientation is analogous
to Stevenson and Jarillo's (1990) concept DEMO entrepreneurial management,
in that it reflects the organizational processes, methods, and styles that
firms use to act entrepreneurially. With regard to the DEMO dimensions
of EO, Miller (1983) has provided a useful starting DEMO He suggested that
an entrepreneurial firm is one that "engages in DEMO market innova-
tion, undertakes somewhat risky ventures, and is first to come up with
'proactive' innovations, beating competitors to the punch" (1983: 771). Ac-
cordingly, he used the dimensions of "innovativeness," "risk taking," and
"proactiveness" to characterize and test entrepreneurship. Numerous re-
searchers have adopted an approach based on Miller's (1983) original
conceptualization (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Ginsberg, 1985; Morris &
Paul, 1987; Naman & Slevin, 1993; Schafer, DEMO). For example, Covin and
Slevin (1989) investigated the performance DEMO entrepreneurial firms in hos-
tile and benign environments. In their study of 161 small manufacturers,
"entrepreneurial strategic posture" was measured using a DEMO that
ranked firms as entrepreneurial if they were innovative, risk taking, and
proactive.
Two other dimensions are important aspects of an entrepreneurial
orientation. DEMO first is competitive aggressiveness, which captures the
distinct idea of "beating competitors to the punch," suggested by Miller's
(1983) definition DEMO an entrepreneurial firm. It refers to the type of intensity
and head-to-head posturing that new entrants often need to compete with
existing rivals. Competitive DEMO was highly correlated with
entrepreneurship across all levels of risk in a study that used published
140

risk rankings to compare firms in DEMO and high-risk environments in
Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the
United States (Dean, Thibodeaux, Beyerlein, Ebrahimi, & Molina, 1993).
Another key component of an EO is a tendency toward independent
and autonomous action. Start-up firms must exercise intentionality to
carry forward DEMO specific actions required to launch new ventures (Bird,
1988; Katz & Gartner, 1988). Layers of bureaucracy and organizational
tradition rarely contribute to new-entry activities in existing firms
(Kanter, 1983). Instead, it requires the exercise of autonomy by strong
leaders, unfettered teams or creative individuals who are disengaged
from organizational constraints to lead to new entry. DEMO was the con-
clusion of Burgelman (1983: 241), who found that, in the case of internal
corporate venturing, "the motor of corporate entrepreneurship resides in
the autonomous strategic initiative of individuals at the DEMO lev-
els in the organization."
The next five subsections clarify the dimensions of autonomy, inno-
vativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive DEMO
and offer suggestions for how these dimensions might be studied further.
Although we view each of these dimensions as salient to an EO, our
discussion also reflects the argument that they may vary independently
in a DEMO context.
Autonomy
The history of entrepreneurship is filled with stories of self-deter-
mined pioneers who had a unique, new idea-a better idea-and made
a business out of it. Entrepreneurship has flourished because indepen-
dently minded people DEMO to leave secure positions in order to pro-
mote novel ideas or venture into new markets, rather than allow organi-
zational superiors and processes to inhibit them. Within organizations as
well, it is the freedom granted to individuals and teams who can exercise
their creativity and champion promising DEMO that is needed for entre-
preneurship to occur. Thus, an important DEMO for new-entry activity is
the independent spirit necessary to further new ventures. As such, the
concept of autonomy is a key dimension of an entrepreneurial orientation.
Autonomy refers to the independent action of an individual or DEMO team
in bringing forth an idea or a vision and carrying it through to completion.
In general, it means the ability and will to be self-directed in the pursuit
of opportunities. In an organizational context, it refers to action taken free
of stifling organizational constraints. Thus, even though factors such as
resource availability, actions by competitive rivals, or internal DEMO
tional considerations may change the course of new-venture initiatives,
these are not sufficient to extinguish the autonomous entrepreneurial pro-
cesses that lead to DEMO entry: Throughout the process, the organizational
player remains free to act independently, to make key decisions, and to
proceed.
Discussions of entrepreneurial DEMO in the strategy-making pro-
1996
Lumpkin
and Dess

cess literature often emphasize the role of DEMO behavior, but in
two distinct contexts. Mintzberg (1973) and Mintzberg DEMO Waters (1985)
described an entrepreneurial strategy-making mode, in which decisive
and risky actions are taken by a strong leader. This is similar DEMO Hart's
(1992) command mode and Bourgeois and Brodwin's (DEMO) commander
model, both of which suggest entrepreneurial behavior that is character-
ized by centralized vision and strong leadership. This type of autonomy,
DEMO may be regarded as autocratic (Shrivastava & Grant, 1985), is com-
mon in smaller, owner/manager firms where "the force for DEMO or con-
sistency in action is individual vision, the central actor'DEMO concept of his or
her organization's place in its world. This is coupled with an ability to
impose that vision on the organization DEMO his or her personal control
of its actions (Mintzberg & Waters, 1985: 260, emphasis added).
In contrast, Hart's (1992) integrative framework included a generative
mode, wherein strategy making occurs from the entrepreneurial activities
of organizational members' generating ideas that are passed on to higher
levels of management. Similarly, Bourgeois and Brodwin (1984) described
a Crescive model, wherein strategy is initiated within the organization
via individual entrepreneurship. These models suggest that the impetus
for new ventures often occurs at DEMO levels in an organization (Bower,
1970) and reflect the importance of autonomy to organization members
who might be found in an internal DEMO venture setting. In both
cases, the freedom to act independently is DEMO crucial dimension of EO.
As the previous discussion suggests, evidence of DEMO in firms
may vary as a function of size, management style, or ownership. For
example, in a firm in which the primary decision maker is the owner/
manager, autonomy is implied by the rights of ownership. However, the
extent to which autonomy is exercised in this case may depend on the
level of centralization or the extent of DEMO, and this may be related
to organizational size. In studies of DEMO firms, researchers have exam-
ined the nature and extent of autonomous DEMO by investigating how
centralized the leadership is and how often managers delegate authority
and rely on technical expertise. Miller (1983) found that the DEMO entre-
preneurial firms had the most autonomous leaders. That is, in DEMO sim-
ple firms, high levels of entrepreneurial activity were associated with
DEMO executives who maintained strong central authority and also acted
as the firm's knowledge leader by being aware of emerging technologies
and markets. In DEMO study of decision making by 32 Indian firms, Shrivas-
tava and DEMO (1985) found a similar strong reliance on managerial au-
tocracy among 10 of the firms in which a single key manager was the
DEMO decision making agent. Of these 10 firms, 8 were classified as
"entrepreneurial. "
To promote intrapreneurship (Pinchot, 1985), many large firms have
engaged in changes in organizational structure such as flattening hier-
archies DEMO delegating authority to operating units. These moves are
intended to foster autonomy, but the process of organizational autonomy
142
Academy of Management Review

requires more than a design change. DEMO must actually grant autonomy
and encourage organizational players to exercise it (DEMO, 1979). In some
firms, the process involves champions who promote entrepreneurial ac-
tivity by shielding the new venture innovators from organizational norms
DEMO resource constraints that might cause the new enterprise to be rejected.
Thus, the exercise of organizational autonomy is often characterized by a
two-stage process involving a project definition that is carried out by
autonomous organizational members DEMO a project impetus that is carried
out by champions who sustain the autonomous efforts (Bower, 1970).
Burgelman (1983) found, for example, that initial internal corporate-
venturing efforts were conducted by corporate R&D departments operat-
ing outside the confines of the current corporate strategy. Hart (1991) stud-
ied the autonomous processes of organizational actors by asking
managers the extent to which entrepreneurial efforts based on employee
initiative emerges upward DEMO lower levels to help shape the firm's stra-
tegic direction.
Burgelman (1983) also found that product champions formed the crit-
ical link DEMO project definition and impetus processes. Their role
consisted of procuring resources and creating market interest in the new
project. Thus, in an organizational setting, it is often the champions that
play the most entrepreneurial roles by scavenging for resources, going
outside the usual lines of authority, and DEMO risk taking on behalf
of new ideas and promising breakthroughs (Kanter, 1983; Peters & Water-
man, 1982). Shane (1994a) found DEMO experienced organizational champi-
ons favored efforts to create autonomy via actions such as bending the
rules and bypassing procedures and budgets. These examples may DEMO
vide useful clues for operationalizing autonomy in future studies.
Innovativeness
Schumpeter (DEMO, 1942) was among the first to emphasize the role of
innovation in the entrepreneurial process. Schumpeter (1942) outlined an
economic process of "creative destruction," by which wealth was created
when existing market structures DEMO disrupted by the introduction of
new goods or services that shifted resources away from existing firms and
caused new firms to grow. The key DEMO this cycle of activity was entrepre-
neurship: the competitive entry of DEMO "new combinations" that
propelled the dynamic evolution of the economy (DEMO, 1934). Thus
"innovativeness" became an important factor used to DEMO entre-
preneurship.
Innovativeness reflects a firm's tendency to engage in and support
new ideas, novelty, experimentation, and creative processes that may
result in new products, services, or technological processes. Although
innovations can vary DEMO their degree of "radicalness" (Hage, 1980), inno-
vativeness represents a basic willingness to depart from existing tech-
nologies or practices and DEMO beyond the current state of the art
(Kimberly, 1981). There are numerous methods by which to classify inno-
1996
Lumpkin and Dess
143
vations (see Downs & Mohr, 1976), but perhaps the most useful distinction
is between product-market innovation and technological innovation. Un-
til recently, most research has focused on technological innovativeness,
which consists primarily of product and process development, engineer-
ing, research, and an emphasis on technical expertise and industry
knowledge (Cooper, 1971; Maidique & Patch, 1982). Product-market inno-
vativeness suggests an emphasis on product design, market research,
and advertising and promotion (Miller & DEMO, 1978; Scherer, 1980).
Even this broad categorization may be DEMO to distinguish; however, be-
cause innovativeness frequently represents considerable overlap and
blending of product-market and technological innovation, as in the case
of technologically sophisticated new products designed to meet specific
market demand. In either case, innovativeness is an important compo-
nent of an EO, because it reflects an important means by which firms
pursue new opportunities.
Evidence of firm DEMO may take several forms. In the broad-
est sense, innovativeness may DEMO along a continuum from a simple
willingness to either try a new product line or experiment with a new
advertising venue, to a passionate commitment to master the latest in
new products or technological advances. To DEMO this range of activity,
numerous methods have been employed to measure innovativeness.
For example, in a study of innovative responses to changes in the
environment, Karagozoglu and Brown (1988) asked managers from 56
firms about their willingness to discard old beliefs and explore new al-
ternatives DEMO the way in which they valued and rewarded experimen-
tation. The level of expenditures and number of resources dedicated to
research and development also DEMO a firm's involvement in innova-
tion activities. In terms of human resources, Hage (1980) argued that the
more professionals and specialists in a firm, such as engineers and sci-
entists, the higher the DEMO of innovation. Miller and Friesen (1982) ex-
amined the "technocratization" of firms and found that higher levels of
innovativeness were associated with DEMO reliance on technically
trained specialists. Miller (1987, 1988) used R&DEMO costs as a percentage of
sales to measure financial resources devoted to innovation. Thus, even
though these factors may vary by industry, a DEMO count of financial or
human resources committed to innovation activities may be useful for
operationalizing innovativeness. For product-market innovativeness,
Miller (1987, 1988) asked members of firms to indicate the percentage of
total sales spent DEMO on the costs of initiating and implementing
product-market innovations. Another frequently used marketing-related
method for assessing innovation is to investigate the number of new DEMO
uct or service introductions and the frequency of changes in services or
product lines (Covin & Slevin, 1989; Miller & Friesen, 1982)DEMO
Regarding technological innovativeness, the emphasis shifts to
achieving competencies in the DEMO technologies and production
methods and the development of advanced manufacturing processes.
144
Academy of Management Review

This important aspect of innovativeness is DEMO in most of the studies
based on Miller's (1983) concept of innovativeness, which focused exclu-
sively on the product-market aspect of innovation activities. Subsequent
researchers have endeavored to capture this additional aspect of innova-
DEMO, for example, Zahra and Covin (1993: 452), who focused on "tech-
nology policy," that is, the firm's commitment DEMO "acquiring, developing,
and deploying technology." In this context, firms were asked to rate the
extent to which they emphasize technological development DEMO seek to
build a reputation for trying new methods and technologies. Another ap-
proach that extended efforts to measure innovativeness was used by
Saleh DEMO Wang (1993), who, in a study that compared highly innovative
firms to low innovators, supplemented the Miller-based approach with
questions about efforts to synthesize disparate efforts across functional
lines and flexibility in adapting new DEMO
Risk Taking
The early entrepreneurship literature equated the idea of entrepre-
neurship with working for oneself (i.e., seeking self-employment rather
than working for DEMO else for wages) (Cantillon, 1734; Shane, 1994b).
Along DEMO this type of work came the idea of assuming personal risk.
Cantillon (1734), who was the first to formally use the term entrepreneur-
ship, argued that the principal factor that separated entrepreneurs from
hired employees was the uncertainty and riskiness of self-employment.
Thus, the concept of risk taking is a quality that is frequently used to
describe entrepreneurship.
Risk DEMO various meanings, depending on the context in which it is
applied. DEMO the context of strategy, Baird and Thomas identified three
types of DEMO risk: (a) "venturing into the unknown," (b) "DEMO a
relatively large portion of assets," and (c) "borrowing DEMO" (1985: 231-
232). The first of these definitions conveys DEMO sense of uncertainty and may
apply generally to some types of risk often discussed in the entrepreneur-
ship literature, such as personal risk, DEMO risk, or psychological risk
(Gasse, 1982). As a term DEMO financial analysis, risk is used in the context
of the familiar DEMO trade-off, where it refers specifically to the
probability of a loss DEMO negative outcome. This is essentially the definition
that Miller and Friesen adopted when they defined risk taking as "the
degree to which managers are willing to make large and risky resource
commitments-i.e., those which have a reasonable chance of costly fail-
ures" (1978: 923). Both the notion of high leverage from borrowing and
heavy commitment of resources is DEMO with this definition of risk
taking. Thus, firms with an entrepreneurial DEMO are often typified
by risk-taking behavior, such as incurring heavy debt DEMO making large
resource commitments, in the interest of obtaining high returns DEMO seizing
opportunities in the marketplace.
It can be argued that all business endeavors involve some degree of
risk, such that it is not meaningful to think in terms of "absolutely no risk."
1996
Lumpkin
and Dess

Thus, the range of risk-taking behavior extends from some nominal
level-"safe" risks, such as depositing money in DEMO bank, investing in
T-Bills, or restocking the shelves-to highly risky actions, such as bor-
rowing heavily, investing in unexplored technologies, or bringing new
products into new markets. Beyond this general point of agreement, how-
ever, methods of accounting for and measuring risk vary widely. Brock-
haus, for example, focused on risk propensity, which he defined as
"DEMO probability of receiving the rewards" associated with the suc-
cessful outcome DEMO a risky situation (1980: 513). He used an early version of
Kogan and Wallach's (1964) choice dilemmas questionnaire that assessed
DEMO preferences by presenting respondents with 12 hypothetical situa-
tions and asking them to "choose between a safe alternative and a more
attractive but risky one" (Brockhaus, 1980: 514). Sitkin and Pablo (1992),DEMO
however, in their model of risk behavior, distinguished between risk per-
ceptions, risk preferences, and risk propensity. Their use of the term DEMO
propensity "is consistent with Brockhaus's (1980) conceptualization of the
DEMO, but it does not conform either to his formal definition (which in-
cludes preferences) or to his empirical operationalization (which mea-
sures DEMO, rather than propensities or preferences)" (Sitkin &
Pablo, 1992: 12-13). Instead, they regard risk propensity as a mediator
between DEMO preferences and risk behavior, arguing that "the general
desire to avoid or pursue risks (i.e., risk preferences) does not determine
specific risk behaviors, but rather it affects the general likelihood of a
person's behaving in more or less risky ways (i.e., risk propensity)" (1992:
15). Other factors also may be important to predicting DEMO taking, such as
how the risk problem is framed (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), results of
past risk taking (Thaler & Johnson, 1990), and the ability to perform under
risky conditions (Slovic, DEMO, & Lichtenstein, 1980).
These attempts to more clearly understand risk taking stem, in part,
from researchers not being able to find consistent patterns when inves-
tigating risk taking associated with entrepreneurship. Numerous investi-
DEMO have reported inconsistencies in the risk-taking propensity of in-
dividuals who engage in new entry (e.g., Brockhaus, 1982) and equivocal
relationships between DEMO taking and performance (e.g., Begley & Boyd,
1987). Particularly salient to this study is that most studies of entrepre-
neurially related DEMO taking investigate individuals rather than firms.
This brings up another type of problem with measuring risk, namely that
a risk-averse individual, or one DEMO prefers to study an opportunity thor-
oughly before embarking on it, DEMO not advocate risk avoidance by the
whole firm. That is, an DEMO aversion to a specific new-venture
opportunity may be overcome by either careful study and investigation or
confidence in a good idea. The result may DEMO that, at the level of the firm,
risks are taken DEMO would not be taken by a firm member.
Effectively operationalizing firm-level risk taking, therefore, remains
an area for future development. Presently, however, DEMO is a well
accepted and widely used scale based on Miller's (1983) approach to EO,
146

which measures risk taking at the DEMO level by asking managers about
the firm's proclivity to engage in risky projects and managers' preferences
for bold versus cautious acts to achieve firm objectives. Venkatraman
(1989a) used a similar approach, asking managers the extent to which
they followed tried-and-true paths or tended to support only DEMO in
which the expected returns were certain.
Proactiveness
Economics scholars since Schumpeter have emphasized the impor-
tance of initiative in the entrepreneurial process. Penrose (1959) argued
that entrepreneurial managers are important to the growth of firms be-
cause they provide the vision and imagination necessary to engage in
DEMO expansion. Lieberman and Montgomery (1988) emphasized
the importance of first-mover advantage as the best strategy for capital-
izing on a market opportunity. By DEMO asymmetries in the market-
place, the first mover can capture unusually DEMO profits and get a head
start on establishing brand recognition. Thus, DEMO initiative by antic-
ipating and pursuing new opportunities and by participating in emerging
markets also has become associated with entrepreneurship. This fourth
characteristic of DEMO is often referred to as proactiveness.
The term proactiveness is defined in Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary (1991: 937) as "acting DEMO anticipation of future problems, needs,
or changes." As such, DEMO may be crucial to an entrepreneurial
orientation because it suggests a forward-looking perspective that is ac-
companied by innovative or new-venturing activity. In an DEMO formula-
tion, Miller and Friesen argued that the proactiveness of a DEMO's deci-
sions is determined by answering the question, "Does it shape the
environment (high score) by introducing new products, technologies, DEMO
ministrative techniques, or does it merely react?" (1978: 923)DEMO Later, proac-
tiveness was used to depict a firm that was DEMO quickest to innovate and
first to introduce new products or services. This is suggested by Miller's
description of an entrepreneurial firm as one DEMO is "first to come up with
'proactive' innovations" (1983: 771). Although the idea of acting in antici-
pation of future DEMO is an important component of entrepreneurship,
the idea of being first to market is somewhat narrowly construed. A firm
can be novel, forward thinking, and fast without always being first. Miller
and Camp (1985), for example, in their study of 84 SBUs, found that the
second firm to enter a new market was as pioneering as the DEMO entrant
and just as likely to achieve success via proactiveness. Therefore, DEMO
sistent with Miller and Friesen's (1978) earlier definition, we DEMO with
Venkatraman, who suggested that proactiveness refers to processes
aimed at DEMO and acting on future needs by "seeking new oppor-
tunities which DEMO or may not be related to the present line of operations,
introduction of new products and brands ahead of competition, strategi-
cally eliminating operations which are in the mature or declining stages
of life cycle" (1989a: 949). Thus, a proactive firm is a leader rather than a
1996
Lumpkin and Dess
147
follower, because it has the will and foresight to seize new opportunities,
even if it is not always DEMO first to do so.
In addition to the previous definition of proactiveness, there also has
been a tendency in the entrepreneurship literature to equate proactive-
ness with competitive aggressiveness. The terms are often used inter-
changeably, for example, in the case in which Covin and Slevin (1989)DEMO
explained that their model of entrepreneurial strategic posture consists of
innovativeness, DEMO, and risk taking which they defined as
"characterized by frequent and extensive technological and product in-
novation, an aggressive competitive orientation, and DEMO strong risk-taking
propensity by top management" (1989: 79, emphasis added).
Although closely related to competitive aggressiveness, we feel there
is an important distinction between it and proactiveness that needs to be
clarified. Proactiveness DEMO to how a firm relates to market opportuni-
ties in the process of new entry. It does so by seizing initiative and acting
opportunistically DEMO order to "shape the environment," that is, to influence
trends and, perhaps, even create demand. Competitive aggressiveness,
in contrast, refers to how firms relate to competitors, that is, how firms
respond DEMO trends and demand that already exist in the marketplace. The
two ideas are similar, because, as Porter (1985) suggested, the market is
the playing field for competitors. But proactiveness has more to do with
DEMO demand, whereas competitive aggressiveness is about compet-
ing for demand. Combining DEMO distinct concepts inappropriately may
explain why Stuart and Abetti (1987) found that a variable labeled "stra-
tegic aggressiveness," in which they joined the notions of "first-to-
market" with a "highly offensive" posture, was not useful as a predictor of
new-entrant success.
To further clarify DEMO concepts, it may be useful to consider the
proactiveness continuum. We DEMO that the conceptual opposite of
proactiveness is passiveness (rather than reactiveness), that is, indiffer-
ence or an inability to seize opportunities or DEMO in the marketplace.
Reactiveness, in contrast, suggests a response to competitors. This ap-
proach is consistent with Chen and Hambrick, who stated that "a firm
should be both proactive and responsive in its environment in terms of
technology and innovation, competition, customers, and so forth. Proac-
tiveness involves taking the initiative in an effort to shape the environ-
DEMO to one's own advantage; responsiveness involves being adaptive to
competitors' challenges" (1995: 457). An EO, therefore, involves both pro-
activeness in pursuing opportunities and the will to respond aggressively
to competitors. DEMO Amdahl, when it learned that IBM had introduced a
new product DEMO as they were about to proactively enter the large CPU
market with a lighter, faster machine, responded by returning to investors
to secure DEMO additional $16 million to further upgrade their product line
prior to entry (Cooper, Willard, & Woo, 1986).
Previous researchers have operationalized DEMO proactiveness
148
Academy of Management Review
January
by asking managers about the firm'DEMO tendency to lead rather than follow
in the development of new procedures and technologies and the introduc-
tion of new products or services (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Miller, 1983).
In Venkatraman's DEMO formulation (1989a), he emphasized the scan-
ning aspect of proactiveness DEMO it relates to opportunity seeking and spe-
cifically queried managers if they had "strategically eliminated" opera-
tions in later stages of their firm-life DEMO
Because proactiveness suggests an emphasis on initiating activities,
it is closely related to innovativeness and is likely to covary with it, as in
the case of new-product introductions. Morris and Paul (1987), when they
conducted a factor analysis on a 12-item innovativeness, risk-taking, pro-
activeness DEMO, on the one hand found two main factors, one that cap-
tured both innovativeness and proactiveness and another representing
risk taking. On the DEMO hand, the products and services that firms pro-
actively bring to DEMO market also may be imitative or reflect low innova-
tiveness. This may be the case, for example, when a firm enters a foreign
DEMO with products that are tried-and-true in domestic markets, but
uniquely meet DEMO demand in an untapped market.
The proactiveness dimension of EO most closely resembles the ideas
suggested by Miles and Snow's (1978) prospector DEMO, about which they
stated,
the Prospector's prime capability is DEMO of finding and exploit-
ing new products and market opportunities.... Prospectors
are frequently the creators of change in their respective in-
dustries. Change is DEMO of the major tools used by the Pros-
pector to gain an edge over competitors. (1978: 551-553)
Summaries of studies that report DEMO efforts to measure the Miles and Snow
typology (e.g., Zahra & Pearce, 1990) and recent efforts by scholars to
improve prospector measurement DEMO (e.g., Conant, Mokwa, &
Varadarajan, 1990) also may DEMO useful clues for measuring proac-
tiveness.
Competitive Aggressiveness
Stinchcombe (1965) suggested that young firms are particularly sus-
ceptible to the "liability of newness" and, therefore, must take steps to
establish legitimacy and power relative to suppliers, customers, and
other competitors. Because new ventures are much DEMO likely to fail than
established businesses, many scholars have argued that DEMO aggressive
stance and intense competition are critical to the survival and success of
new entrants (e.g., MacMillan, 1982; Porter, 1985). Thus, competitive ag-
gressiveness is a fifth dimension of entrepreneurship that is frequently
mentioned in the literature.
Competitive aggressiveness refers to a firm's propensity DEMO directly
and intensely challenge its competitors to achieve entry or improve po-
sition, that is, to outperform industry rivals in the marketplace. As
DEMO previously, competitive aggressiveness is characterized by re-
1996
Lumpkin
and Dess
149
sponsiveness, which may take the form of head-to-head confrontation, for
example, when a firm enters a market that DEMO competitor has iden-
tified, or reactive, for example, when a DEMO lowers prices in response to
a competitive challenge. Competitive aggressiveness also reflects a will-
ingness to be unconventional rather than rely on traditional methods DEMO
competing. Examples of this and other forms of competitive aggressive-
ness available to new entrants include adopting unconventional tactics to
challenge industry leaders (Cooper et al., 1986), analyzing and targeting
a competitor's weaknesses (DEMO & Jones, 1984) and focusing on
high value-added products while carefully monitoring discretionary ex-
penses (Woo & Cooper, 1981). Similarly, Porter (1985) recommended three
approaches for aggressively pursuing existing firms: "doing DEMO dif-
ferently," that is, reconfiguration; changing the context, that DEMO, redefin-
ing the product or service and its market channels or DEMO; and outspend-
ing the industry leader. Thus, competitive aggressiveness, which DEMO
to firm responsiveness directed toward achieving competitive advantage,
is an important component of an EO. The importance of this variable as a
dimension DEMO EO was highlighted in a study of the entrepreneurial pro-
cesses of U.S. firms in global markets, in which Dean (1993) found that
competitive aggressiveness explained considerably more variance (37%)
in corporate entrepreneurship than did any other strategy or structural
variable analyzed. Evidence of competitive aggressiveness DEMO take sev-
eral forms. Covin and Covin (1990: 48), for example, asked managers if
they adopted a "very competitive 'undo-the-competitors' DEMO" or pre-
ferred to "live-and-let-live." Activities aimed at overcoming rivals DEMO
include, for example, setting ambitious market-share goals and taking
bold steps to achieve them, such as cutting prices and sacrificing profits
(Venkatraman, 1989a) or spending aggressively compared to competitors
on marketing, product service DEMO quality, or manufacturing capacity
(MacMillan & Day, 1987). The DEMO and speed of new entry also may
indicate an aggressive posture. A "fast-followers" approach often is used
by firms to aggressively bring new DEMO to market. This approach is
accomplished by speeding up the product-development cycle time. Miller
and Camp found that the most successful aggressive firms were DEMO
that did not shy away from broadly defined markets "in terms DEMO the
number, sizes, and types of their customers, as well DEMO the breadth of their
product line" (1985: 99). Scales DEMO by Ginsberg (1985) and Khand-
walla (1977) also were used to focus on the aggressiveness of competitive
processes used by managers to DEMO rivals. Based on a review of the
literature and our analysis of an entrepreneurial orientation, we suggest
Proposition 1: Autonomy, innovativeness, risk DEMO,
proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness are sa-
lient dimensions of an DEMO orientation.

original conceptualization using these three dimensions-which DEMO
and Slevin (1989) have labeled "a basic, unidimensional strategic orien-
tation" (1989: 79)-implies that only firms that exhibit high levels of all
three dimensions should be regarded as entrepreneurial. This approach
may DEMO too narrowly construed for explaining some types of entrepreneur-
ial behavior. Research (e.g., Brockhaus, 1980) suggests that entrepreneurs
may be very cautious DEMO risk averse under certain conditions. Other
research suggests that entrepreneurial firms may benefit more from imi-
tation than from high levels of innovativeness (Nelson & Winter, 1982). In
addition, the development of numerous typologies DEMO entrepreneurial be-
havior suggests that an EO can be best characterized by several dimen-
sions in various combinations. For example, Schollhammer (1982)
DEMO five different types of entrepreneurship: acquisitive, adminis-
trative, opportunistic, incubative, and imitative. Firms employing the ac-
quisitive type of entrepreneurship achieve new entry into markets by
purchasing existing firms. This approach requires little or DEMO innovative-
ness and, if the acquired firm is an established business, may involve
relatively low risk. Cooper and Dunkelberg (1986) suggested that DEMO
paths to business ownership constitute different degrees of entrepreneur-
ship. They agreed that starting a business requires initiative, creativity,
and personal risk taking, but entrepreneurial owners who obtain their
position by promotion or inheritance generally are not required to be
innovative or to assume a substantial degree DEMO personal risk. Webster
(1977) used a mathematical calculation of the perceived payoff per prin-
cipal, that is, the expected financial return to DEMO venture participants,
for classifying different types of entrepreneurial ventures. This approach
makes little reference to the creativity or proactiveness that may be re-
DEMO by entrepreneurial firms and instead focuses primarily on risk.
The previous examples suggest that an attempt to limit entrepreneur-
ial behavior to only those DEMO in which high levels of all EO dimensions
are evident falls short of explaining many types of entrepreneurship.
Although we argue here that all DEMO dimensions are central to under-
standing the entrepreneurial process, they may DEMO in different combi-
nations, depending on the type of entrepreneurial opportunity DEMO firm pur-
sues. Sony and Matsushita provide an example of how two competitors
can differ along dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation. On the one
hand, Sony, well known for its entrepreneurial spirit and R&D skills,
aggressively pursues first-mover advantages from new-product innova-
tion. Matsushita, on the other hand, takes a very different competitive
posture. Its nickname in Japanese is "Maneshita denki," which roughly
translates to "electronics that have been DEMO" Matsushita typically
lets Sony and others innovate, but then takes a leadership position based
on its skills in manufacturing and marketing (Lieberman & Montgomery,
1988). Thus, Matsushita draws on the innovativeness of others to position
itself to be ready to enter a market once rapid DEMO begins. Although
few observers would argue that Sony has a strong EO, we suggest that
1996
Lumpkin and Dess

Matsushita also has a strong EO. That DEMO, it incurs risks through capital
investment in plant and equipment, is proactive by entering markets
early in the product life cycle, and displays intense competitive aggres-
siveness through its strategies that are intended to build DEMO market
share. Therefore,

KEY

CONTINGENCIES
The importance of entrepreneurship DEMO the strategic management of
firms has been widely acknowledged in the strategy literature (e.g., An-
drews, 1971; Chandler, 1962; Schendel & DEMO, 1979). Miles and Snow
(1978) regarded the entrepreneurial problem DEMO a fundamental issue faced
by all firms, the solution to which DEMO an organization's domain, its
product-market relationships, and its resource commitments. Those in
strategic management are concerned with the performance implications
of management DEMO, decisions, and actions at the level of the firm.
Prior theory and research have suggested that an EO is a key ingredient
for DEMO success. There often appears to be a normative bias,
however, DEMO the inherent value in entrepreneurship and an assump-
tion that for new entry to result in high performance, firms must have a
strong entrepreneurial orientation (Collins & Moore, 1970; Covin & Slevin,
1991; DEMO & Waterman, 1982; Schollhammer, 1982; Zahra, 1993). This
DEMO remains largely untested, as suggested by Zahra, who found
that there is "a paucity of empirical documentation of the effect of entre-
preneurship on company financial performance" (1993: 11). To address
this question, we provide Figure 1, an integrative framework for exploring
the relationship DEMO entrepreneurial orientation and performance.
Strategic management scholars are concerned with the relationship
between key variables-(organizational structures and processes and
characteristics of the business DEMO) and performance. In order to
effectively model the EO-performance relationship, the role of contingent
variables will be considered. Contingency theory suggests that congru-
DEMO or fit among key variables, such as environment, structure, and
DEMO, is critical for obtaining optimal performance (Miller, 1988). Fac-
DEMO such as industry and environmental variables, or the structural and
managerial DEMO of an existing firm, influence how an entre-
preneurial orientation will DEMO configured to achieve high performance.
The contingency relationships that we propose also provide a context for
addressing the extent to which dimensions of EO DEMO, under certain

conditions, vary independently rather than covary. Thus, the framework
suggested by Figure 1 presents factors that may affect the relationship
between an EO and performance.
To address these issues, we review EO-related contingencies that
have been suggested in the literature. Then, we present alternative mod-
els to demonstrate how the role of contingency DEMO on the EO-
performance relationship can be investigated.
Identifying Key Contingencies
The entrepreneurship literature, in referring to the causes of entre-
preneurship, often DEMO factors such as managerial style, need for
achievement, and other social or motivational factors. These may be im-
portant corollaries to an entrepreneurial DEMO that help explain a
firm's performance. Similarly, environmental factors, such as dynamism
and munificence, or structural factors, such as the decentralization DEMO
decision making, may influence the performance of firms with an entre-
DEMO orientation. In their model of entrepreneurship as firm behav-
ior, Covin DEMO Slevin (1991) discussed the relationship of strategy, struc-
ture, and environment to the EO dimensions of innovativeness, risk
taking, and proactiveness. DEMO these three dimensions, several re-
searchers have verified the importance of DEMO the EO-performance
relationship in a contingency framework (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1989; Kara-
gozoglu & Brown, 1988; Zahra & Covin, 1995). In one of the few studies to
test a three-way model DEMO environment, structure and EO, Naman and
1996
Lumpkin and Dess
153
Slevin (1993) found support for a DEMO relationship between fit and
performance for organic firms in a turbulent environment whose style was
highly innovative, risk taking, and proactive. In other DEMO that tested
the relationship between contingency variables and individual dimen-
sions of EO, there was also a significant association with performance
(e.g., Covin & Covin, 1990; Miller, 1983, 1988).
Contingency theories have DEMO fundamental to furthering the devel-
opment of the organizational sciences by recognizing the importance of
the alignment or fit among key constructs of interest (Burns & Stalker,
1961; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967; Schoonhoven, DEMO; Venkatraman, 1989b).
Given the centrality of the EO construct, DEMO consider it necessary to in-
vestigate the role of environmental and organizational variables to fur-
ther our understanding of how EO contributes to performance DEMO
Through such a perspective, we recognize the need to go beyond DEMO
investigation of bivariate correlations and examine contingency relation-
ships. Furthermore, Rosenberg DEMO that the introduction of a third
variable into the analysis of a two-variable relationship (e.g.,
EO-performance) helps reduce the potential for misleading DEMO
and permits a "more precise and specific understanding" (1968: 100) of the
original two-variable relationship.
Table 1 summarizes key contingencies that have been identified in
prior research and that are associated with the EO-performance DEMO
ship.
Measuring Firm Performance
In investigating the EO-performance relationship, it is DEMO to
recognize the multidimensional nature of the performance construct
(Cameron, 1978; Chakravarthy, 1986). That is, entrepreneurial activity or
processes may, DEMO times, lead to favorable outcomes on one performance
dimension and unfavorable DEMO on a different performance dimen-
sion. For example, heavy investment in DEMO&D and product innovation may
enable a firm to successfully enter new product-market domains and con-
sequently enhance sales growth in the long run. DEMO, the requisite
resource commitment may detract from short-run profitability. Thus, re-
search that only considers a single dimension or a narrow range of DEMO
performance construct (e.g., multiple indicators of profitability) may re-
sult DEMO misleading descriptive and normative theory building.
Research testing the propositions such as those suggested in this
article should include multiple performance measures. Such measures
DEMO include traditional accounting measures such as sales growth,
market share, DEMO profitability. In addition, indicators of "overall perfor-
mance" would be DEMO in incorporating the firm's goals, objectives, and
aspiration levels (DEMO, 1978) as well as other elements of broader
stakeholder satisfaction. Alternative measures of performance may com-
pete, depending on the size and type of firm and its ownership. For ex-
ample, new firms often are initiated because key players prefer to work

for DEMO rather than take direction from an organizational superior.
This is consistent with a lifestyle approach (Birley, 1987), whereby effec-
tiveness may be DEMO by the most basic type of financial criteria, such
as monthly DEMO flow or mere survival. Thus, a small, privately owned
firm may regard its continued existence as a satisfactory indicator of high
performance, even though it cannot claim to have a strong return on
assets or DEMO in market share. It also may make a conscious decision
not to grow beyond a certain size, in order to maintain control of the
business. Thus, factors such as overall satisfaction and nonfinancial
goals of the owners may need to be weighted more heavily in evaluating
performance, especially among privately held firms.
Other nonfinancial considerations may be important. Factors such DEMO
1996
Lumpkin and Dess
155
reputation, public image and goodwill, and DEMO commitment and satis-
faction of employees may be important to new entrants. Similarly, Zahra
(1993) has suggested that the importance of alternate financial and non-
financial performance measures change at different points in the life DEMO
an organization or new venture. This last point is consistent with Quinn
and Cameron's (1978) finding that the criteria of effectiveness shift DEMO an
organization evolves. Thus, those who investigate the effectiveness and
efficiency DEMO an entrepreneurial orientation need to be sensitive to these
performance criteria.
Alternate Models Using Dimensions of an Entrepreneurial Orientation
Venkatraman (1989b) and Boal DEMO Bryson (1987) have proposed al-
ternative models for investigating the impact of third variables as a
means of exploring contingency relationships. We believe DEMO the mod-
els in Figure 2-moderating effects, mediating effects, independent ef-
fects, and interaction effects-provide a useful framework for gaining
additional insight into the EO-performance relationship. We first concen-
trate on examples of various "third variables" to illustrate how they might
affect the EO-performance relationship. Next, DEMO provide examples of
contingent relationships that incorporate the multidimensional nature of
the EO construct.
These four models have been used previously to provide theoretical
DEMO into the planning-performance (Boal & Bryson, 1987), generic strat-
egies-performance (Dess & Rasheed, 1992), and consensus-performance
(Dess & Priem, DEMO) relationships. We contend, therefore, that our under-
standing of the DEMO link can be further enriched by testing
alternate contingency models based on prior theory and research and the
frameworks suggested by Venkatraman (1989b) DEMO Boal and Bryson
(1987). The alternative models presented here serve DEMO examples of pos-
sible relationships and provide a framework for introducing propositions
that we acknowledge are tentative. We have proposed models that illus-
trate DEMO mentioned relationships in the literature. They are for
illustrative purposes and provide a context in which to draw on real-world
examples.
The moderating-effects model DEMO shown in Figure 2a. In this model,
the form or strength of the EO-performance relationship varies as a func-
tion of organizational structure. DEMO and Stalker (1961) introduced the
idea of organic versus mechanistic organizational structures. From their
investigation of 20 Scottish and British industrial firms, they concluded
that organizations are arrayed along a mechanistic-organic continuum,
which, they argued, constituted "two formally contrasted forms of man-
agement system" (DEMO & Stalker, 1961: 119). Organic organizations typ-
ically are decentralized and informal and have an emphasis on lateral
interaction and an equal DEMO of knowledge throughout the orga-
nizational network. Mechanistic organizations, in contrast, tend to be
highly centralized and formal, and they are characterized by a high

degree of vertical interaction and specialized differentiation between
functions. Khandwalla (1977) DEMO that an EO needs to be associated
with the flexibility inherent in organic organization structures. Similarly,
Covin and Slevin (1991) suggested that DEMO EO should be associated with
low structural formalization, decentralization, and low complexity. Miller
and Friesen (1982) compared the structural attributes of entrepreneurial
DEMO conservative firms. In Covin and Slevin's (1988) analysis of 80 busi-
nesses, the "organicness" of thre wil h r was found to moderate
the relationship between an entrepreneurial decision-making style and
performance. The DEMO of the moderating-effects model suggests that or-
ganization structure must be included in order to correctly specify the
EO-performance relationship. Therefore,
Proposition 3: The relationship between EO and firm
performance will be moderated by the DEMO of an organic
structure. Firms with an entrepreneurial orientation that
ulse an organic strulctulre will have higher performance
relative to those that do not DEMO an organic structure.

The mediating-effects model is illustrated in Figure DEMO In it, EO is

variable. In this example, we suggest that effective integrating activities
and processes intervene in the relationship between EO and perfor-
mance. Firms with DEMO strong EO will aggressively enter new-product mar-
kets and incur greater risks. Such competitive moves will result in their
having to cope with more DEMO and rapidly changing environments.
To deal with such environmental demands, Lawrence DEMO Lorsch (1967),
Galbraith (1973), and others have argued DEMO such resulting differentia-
tion requires a greater use of integrating structure in order to attain su-
perior performance. This is consistent with Ashby's (1956) law of requisite
variety, wherein external complexity should be matched DEMO a corre-
sponding level of complexity in internal processes. Similarly, Kanter
(1983) suggested that integrative thinking is vital when creating the type
of team environment wherein innovative activities are encouraged and
enriched. She argues that
DEMO organizations reduce rancorous conflict and isolation be-
tween organizational units; create DEMO for exchange
of information and new ideas across organizational bound-
aries; DEMO multiple perspectives are taken into account in
decisions, and provide coherence DEMO direction to the whole
organization. (Kanter, 1983: 28)
In DEMO, Miller suggested that such activities would include the
"extensive use of structural integration devices such as committees and
task forces" (1983: 773) and the effective use of rules, planning, and bud-
geting as well as integrating roles for project activity across functions
(Galbraith & Kazanjian, 1986). Also, to integrate activities across business
units within a DEMO, Porter (1985) suggested the term horizontal
organization, which consists of horizontal structures, horizontal systems,
and horizontal human resource practices. DuPont's nonwovens unit pro-
vides an example of a "horizontal organization's" DEMO in spurring
entrepreneurial activity (DuPont Annual Report, 1993). Members of this
unit work in networks and teams to gain insights into potential DEMO,
and they get together with customers or partners to quickly develop them.
Such flexibility enables the nonwovens unit to seek opportunities in a
DEMO of products and markets. For example, this unit worked with Du-
DEMO's automotive unit to evaluate a Tyvekg car cover that was recently
introduced in retail markets. The two units continue to work together to
DEMO an improved product as well as a cover for new cars en route to
dealers. Thus,
Proposition 4: The relationship between EO and firm
performance will be mediated by the use of integrating
activities. Firms DEMO an entrepreneurial orientation

that use integrating activities will have DEMO perfor-
mance compared to those that do not use integrating
activities.
An independent-effects model is illustrated in Figure 2c. In it, EO and
environmental munificence are depicted as having independent effects
on the dependent variable, firm performance. Environmental munificence
may be defined as the profitability or growth rates DEMO the industry in which
a firm competes. This relationship is consistent with the traditional in-
dustrial organization paradigm (Porter, 1981), which posits DEMO the indus-
try within which a firm competes has a critical impact on its performance.
Beard and Dess (1981), Rumelt (1982), DEMO Lieberson and O'Connor (1972)
found that a firm's DEMO context was a significant predictor of perfor-
mance. We also argue that although EO may have an independent effect
on performance, an EO will not interact with the environmental munifi-
cence-performance relationship. One may argue that DEMO or SBUs com-
peting in munificent environments typically will generate additional
slack because of relatively higher levels of profits. Such slack resources
can be DEMO to facilitate experimentation with new strategies and prac-
tices (Bourgeois, 1981), thus enhancing a firm's overall EO. However, we
believe that such processes will not occur unless the firm has effective
integrating mechanisms (Proposition 3) and/or an organic structure (Prop-
osition 4) to facilitate such behavior. In other words, resources, in and of
themselves, will not enhance a firm's EO. Therefore,
Proposition 5: Both environmental munificence and EO
will have an independent effect on organizational per-
DEMO
An interaction-effects model is shown in Figure 2d. In it, character-
DEMO of the top management team (TMT), such as tolerance for DEMO
or need for achievement, are believed to interact to influence firm DEMO
mance. The interaction model is unique because there is no implication of
a main effect on EO (as there is with the moderating-effects model dis-
cussed previously). In this case, only an interaction effect is proposed.
Tolerance for ambiguity has been defined as "the tendency to perceive
ambiguous situations as desirable" (Budner, 1962: 29). Favoring ambigu-
DEMO such as this is likely to be congruent with the type of innovative,
risk-taking behavior suggested by the EO construct. Need for achieve-
DEMO is a person's drive to accomplish difficult tasks and be successful
(McClelland, 1961). This type of drive is consistent with the DEMO
and risk-taking characteristic of entrepreneurship. Prior studies by Miller
and Droge (DEMO) and Miller and Toulouse (1986) found that need for
achievement DEMO with strategy making and organizational struc-
ture. It is important to point out that personality factors (such as tolerance
for ambiguity and need for achievement) tend to be consistent over rather
long periods of time (DEMO, 1984). Behaviors may be reactive to or vary
with EO, but personality will be less likely to exhibit such relationships.
1996 Lumpkin and Dess 159
We believe this distinction raises an interesting DEMO question: To
what extent would a "strong" EO affect various DEMO traits of in-
cumbent managers?
Proposition 6: Tolerance for ambiguity DEMO EO will in-
fluence organizational performance through their inter-
action effect. Firms with an EO, in which managers
have high tolerance for ambiguity, DEMO have higher per-
formance compared to firms with managers who have
low tolerance for ambiguity.
Proposition 7: Need for achievement and EO will influ-
ence organizational performance through their interac-
tion effect. Firms with an EO, in which managers have
a high need for achievement, will have higher perfor-
mance compared to firms in which managers have a low
need DEMO achievement.
These four models should provide additional insight into the EO-
performance relationship. The models also provide an overall framework
for the testing of DEMO theories. For example, we have proposed that
in Figure 2c, environmental munificence would have an independent ef-
fect on performance. However, Covin and Slevin (1989) suggested and
found statistically significant empirical results for the DEMO of environmen-
tal hostility, a similar concept, as a moderator in the EO-performance
relationship. They defined hostile environments as "characterized by pre-
carious industry settings, intense competition, harsh, overwhelming
business climates, and the DEMO lack of exploitable opportunities"
(1989: 75). One could argue that, in hostile environments, resources would
be more constrained and would, in turn, lead to greater control, coordi-
nation, and interlocking of organizational behavior (Pfeffer & Leblebici,
1973). A smaller resource base also would impede experimentation with
new strategies (Bourgeois, 1981) and direct efforts toward conserving lim-
ited resources (Chakravarthy, 1982; Richards, 1979)DEMO Under such condi-
tions, entrepreneurial behavior would be stifled and, even if viable stra-
tegic alternatives were proposed, the allocation of sufficient resources to
ensure their proper implementation would become problematic. Thus, the
scarcity of resources would adversely affect the relationship between a
firm's EO and DEMO This example illustrates the need to test al-
ternate models of the role of third variables.
Entrepreneurial Orientation as Multidimensional: How Relationships
May Differ
We have focused on alternate models for investigating the EO con-
struct DEMO its relationship to performance. However, consistent with
Proposition 2, dimensions of EO may, in fact, vary independently. Accord-
ingly, we provide two examples using Figure 2a to illustrate how rela-
160
Academy of Management Review
January
tionships may differ when the multidimensional DEMO of EO is explicitly
recognized.
Example 1. As was noted, theory DEMO research suggest that an or-
ganic structure provides a desirable structural context for innovativeness
(Covin & Slevin, 1991; Miller & Friesen, 1982)DEMO Thus, the innovativeness
dimension of an EO is likely to be DEMO related to performance when
the setting is organic. However, because structural "organicness" sug-
gests decentralization and low formalization, traditional methods of or-
DEMO control are relaxed. Such an organizational environment
may promote the autonomy and creativity required for innovative behav-
ior. However, an organic structure may negatively moderate the compet-
itive aggressiveness-performance relationship. That is, although an or-
ganic structure may contribute to an atmosphere of creativity, it also may
detract from a firm's ability to focus intensely enough to effectively com-
DEMO with industry rivals. With such a structure, it may be more DEMO
to coordinate and integrate primary and support activities in a firm's
value chain (Porter, 1985). The resulting loose coupling (Weick, DEMO), im-
plicit in an organic structure, may be detrimental to DEMO a firm's
product-market domain. Such is the case with Dell Computer Company of
Austin, Texas-a firm with 1994 sales of approximately $3 billion. "Until
very recently, Dell was a big and growing company with DEMO corner grocery
store style of management" (Mack, 1994: 46) DEMO the structuring of
activities required for a company that had grown so rapidly. Dell was
unable to coordinate its design, manufacturing, sales, and procurement
functions. Not surprisingly, Dell had problems controlling costs, a major
DEMO for a firm competing aggressively for market share in what
has largely become a commodity business. To turn things around, Dell
has hired several experienced managers to rationalize all aspects of its
operations, including supplier reductions and improved inventory con-
trol. There has been one indication of Dell'DEMO successful turnaround: By
January 30, 1994, Dell was enjoying a DEMO jump in sales with a corre-
sponding 27% drop in inventory compared to the previous year. Thus, to
compete aggressively, Dell had to DEMO from its organic "grocery store"
approach. Therefore,
Proposition 8: "Organicness" will moderate the relation-
ship between innovativeness and performance: Among
firms with high innovativeness, greater "organicness"
will be associated with DEMO performance.
Proposition 9: "Organicness" will moderate the relation-
ship between DEMO aggressiveness and perfor-
mance: Among firms with strong competitive aggres-
siveness, greater "organicness" will be associated with
lower performance.
Example 2. Quick DEMO has been increasingly recognized as an
important form of competitive advantage (DEMO & Hout, 1988; Stalk, 1988;
1996
Lumpkin
and Dess
161
Thomas, 1991). A firm following a strategy of quick response may outper-
form rivals through a variety of DEMO means, such as quickly ad-
justing to market conditions or fast DEMO of products and services. The
relationship between proactiveness and firm performance may be en-
hanced if a quick-response strategy enables the firm to successfully DEMO
troduce new products or services. This strategy may help a firm become
a first mover (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988) and provide a source of
sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1992) if imitation and substi-
tution are difficult for competitors. On the one hand, the competitive ad-
vantage of late entrants may be compromised through the diffusion of
new technologies DEMO the industry. On the other hand, a quick-
response strategy may DEMO moderate the relationship between in-
novativeness and firm performance. That is, DEMO strategy that emphasizes
speed of response without giving attention to the developmental activi-
ties and cross-functional coordination (Devanna & Tichy, 1990) needed to
effectively develop an innovative new product or service may cause per-
formance DEMO suffer. Further, a firm that responds too quickly to a new
DEMO may fail to integrate important feedback from the marketplace
that would perhaps have helped it to respond with more effective inno-
vative activities. Apple'DEMO Newton personal digital assistant (PDA) illus-
trates the "downside" of combining quick response and innovation (Ro-
bello, 1994). Apple's DEMO was to quickly ensnare market share by
building customers' expectations as DEMO as possible, thereby increasing
customers' switching costs. However, the product DEMO ex-CEO Sculley
had hoped would correct a 1993 third-quarter loss of $188 million did not
deliver. Sales were only 1% of Apple's revenues, versus the hoped-for
25%. What went wrong? Most of the model's glitches were related to its
lack of promised ability to decipher handwriting. DEMO, Apple could
have benefited by closer coordination among its marketing, R&D, pro-
duction, and engineering professionals. Therefore,
Proposition 10: A quick-response strategy will moderate
the relationship between proactiveness and performance:
Among DEMO that are highly proactive, a quick-response
strategy will be associated with DEMO performance.
Proposition 11: A quick-response strategy will moderate
the relationship between DEMO and perfor-
mance: Among firms that are highly innovative, a
quick-response strategy will be associated with lower
performance.
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
RESEARCH
AND
PRACTICE
DEMO term entrepreneurship is used broadly and applied in many con-
texts. Researchers investigating entrepreneurship are still struggling,
however, with issues such as "DEMO makes a firm entrepreneurial?" "Can
162
Academy of Management Review
January
any firm be entrepreneurial?" "What's the difference between entrepre-
neurship and effective strategic management?" and "When does a firm
cease to be entrepreneurial?" Underlying these issues DEMO the basic ques-
tion, "What is entrepreneurship?" In the interest of addressing this ques-
tion, our goal has been to illuminate one aspect of this broadly used
term-the entrepreneurial orientation construct. By clarifying this DEMO
cept, distinguishing it from the new entry aspects of entrepreneurship,
DEMO using a contingency framework to relate it to performance,we have
endeavored to help guide further theory building in this important area.
As such, we can begin to address other questions related to the nature of
DEMO
For example, to the question, "What makes a firm entrepreneurial?"
we would argue that any firm that engages in an effective DEMO of
autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive
aggressiveness is entrepreneurial. Thus, an entrepreneurial orientation,
as reflected in the organizational processes and decision-making style of
a firm, can be a source of competitive advantage or strategic renewal,
even for firms that are not involved DEMO launching new ventures. In this
respect, an effective EO may be DEMO example of good strategic manage-
ment. This difference, in fact, further highlights the importance of distin-
guishing between the EO aspect of entrepreneurship DEMO new entry. New
entry is the action that distinguishes entrepreneurial behavior from other
types of business activity that might be undertaken to capitalize on DEMO
opportunity. For example, it might be good business to purchase a DEMO
supply of raw materials that suddenly becomes available at a deeply
discounted price, or it may increase efficiency to reorganize a production
capability by outsourcing key components of the process. These actions
reflect insightful decision making DEMO good management practices rather
than entrepreneurship. Defining entrepreneurship as new entry, DEMO
fore, represents a somewhat narrower approach to conceptualizing the
construct than DEMO by Stevenson and Jarillo (1990), who defined it
rather broadly DEMO "the process of . .. pursuing opportunities" (1990: 23). In
contrast, the idea of entrepreneurship as new entry is more encompassing
than the approach taken by Gartner (1988: 26), who argued DEMO "entre-
preneurship is the creation of new organizations." We suggest that new
entry may occur across a range of firms, from individuals to existing
organizations, without necessarily creating a new organization.
The entrepreneurial orientation construct, we believe, represents the
process aspect of entrepreneurship. Future researchers should DEMO
the extent to which such entrepreneurial processes may predict the nature
and success of pursuing opportunities via new entry. Additionally, the
relationship of EO to other key predictor variables such as strategies and
tactics, industry life cycle, and size are fertile areas for future research.
An entrepreneurial orientation may be especially important for small new
entrants that are struggling to DEMO a management team, to organize
resources efficiently, and to develop a strategy. During start-up, an EO
1996
Lumpkin and Dess
163
may be the only thing a young DEMO has going for it until issues of survival
can be satisfied.
Regarding the question, "When does a firm cease to be entrepreneur-
ial?" we would argue again that a firm can choose to maintain an entre-
preneurial orientation throughout its life. We also suggest, however, that
DEMO members of a firm become overly passive or decline to take risks or
exercise creativity in order to capitalize on a market opportunity, they run
the risk of losing the entrepreneurial edge. In contrast, the extent to which
an EO will be effective in a given context may DEMO Both Slevin and Covin
(1990) and Miller (1983, 1988) DEMO that firms can be too entrepreneur-
ial; that is, they may take risks or incur R&D expenses that are not in
accord DEMO the market environment or circumstances in which they are
competing. Thus, DEMO is important to employ a contingency framework to
evaluate what factors may influence the relationship of an EO to perfor-
mance.
The idea that DEMO dimensions of EO may vary independently is con-
sistent with the work of prior entrepreneurship scholars, who have pro-
posed different typologies to characterize entrepreneurship. Schollham-
mer (1982), for example, posited five different types DEMO entrepreneurship:
acquisitive, administrative, opportunistic, incubative, and imitative.
Within each of these categories, the extent to which autonomy, innova-
tiveness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness can
contribute positively to performance may DEMO In the future, researchers
should investigate how entrepreneurial processes influence performance
DEMO the different settings, such as those that Schollhammer suggests. Em-
pirical DEMO may reveal unique configurations of the dimensions of
EO. For example, DEMO (1986) suggested that entrepreneurial activities
fall into two primary categories: DEMO and imitative. Future research
may support the idea that the dimensions of EO fall into two broad cat-
egories that correspond to Baumol's DEMO types where initiating en-
trepreneurship proceeds from high levels of innovativeness and proac-
tiveness, whereas imitative new entry is successful because of an em-
phasis on competitive aggressiveness. Researchers should also investi-
gate whether some dimensions DEMO EO are always present, whereas others
vary depending on the context. DEMO investigators may find, for exam-
ple, that risk taking and autonomy are needed for all types of new entry,
but that innovativeness, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness
are present only under certain conditions. Additionally, DEMO dimensions
may combine to form unique entrepreneurial types. Zahra and Covin
(DEMO), for example, used the concept of an aggressive technological pos-
DEMO, which combines notions of innovativeness and competitive aggres-
siveness.
Although we DEMO argued in this article for the viability of investi-
gating contingency relationships, we also believe that additional in-
sights can be gained by exploring configurations among an EO and other
key constructs. That is, an EO may be more strongly associated with
164
Academy of Management Review
January
performance when it is combined with DEMO the appropriate strategy and
the proper environmental conditions. Such an assertion is consistent with
Miller's (1988) and others' ideas that a configurational framework has
promise for further developing normative and descriptive theory. Addi-
tionally, Lenz, in a study of savings and loan associations, concluded that
"neither environment, strategy nor organizational structure is sufficient to
explain differences in performance . .. organizational performance is de-
termined, in part, by DEMO particular coalignment administrators are able
to achieve" (1980: 220-221). DEMO research by the authors found that
entrepreneurial strategy making, when matched DEMO high environmental
uncertainty and a low-cost strategy, was associated with high DEMO
mance. This was contrary to our hypothesis (Dess, Lumpkin, & DEMO,
1995). One might interpret such a finding as suggesting that even when
competing on the basis of cost, it may be advisable to proactively scan the
environment, take some risks, and innovate. Alternatively, perhaps en-
trepreneurial orientations are not necessarily inconsistent with overall
cost-leadership strategies, unless each is pursued at the extreme. In ret-
rospect, had we viewed the EO as multidimensional, the results and our
interpretations may have provided additional insights. That is, risk tak-
ing and proactiveness may have been consistent with this configuration
but not innovativeness (or other dimensions of EO).
In addition to exploring relationships among EO, strategy, environ-
DEMO, and organizational performance, researchers should investigate
the processes through which entrepreneurial behavior enhances a firm's
competitive position and performance. Such research should DEMO fine-
grained (Harrigan, 1983) methodologies such as intensive field research
DEMO case studies. For example, Burgelman (1983) explored the implica-
tions DEMO induced and autonomous entrepreneurial activities among six
internal corporate-venturing projects and found that autonomous strate-
gic activities often are initiated by individuals at the DEMO levels in
the organization. Fine-grained methodologies also could provide insight
into the role of culture and, in the context of the resource-based model of
the firm, complex social processes (e.g., Barney, 1992) associated with the
dimensions of an entrepreneurial orientation. Finally, such methodolo-
gies also could help to address a more basic question, that is, how to
DEMO the various constructs suggested in this article. For exam-
ple, there DEMO numerous methods employed for measuring the construct
"risk taking" (Baird & Thomas, 1985). What is the best method in the
context DEMO EO? Prior research suggests that entrepreneurs simply don't
"see" DEMO risks that others see, or, alternatively, they see nonentrepre-
neurial DEMO as far more risky. In the future, researchers should help
to DEMO capture such a construct. The same issue is relevant for all
the EO constructs addressed in this article.
CONCLUSION
Exploring relationships between entrepreneurial behavior DEMO per-
formance is very timely, given the competitive conditions faced by DEMO
1996
Lumpkin and Dess

of all sizes in today's economy. DEMO goal has been to build on prior theory
and research in order to (a) clarify the multidimensional nature of the EO
construct and (b) suggest alternative contingency models that we believe
will provide additional insight into the EO-performance relationship. We
encourage research efforts directed at understanding the DEMO
of the EO construct and the role of contingency and configurational ap-
proaches in explaining its relationship to performance. Such efforts will
contribute to DEMO theoretical development in the field of entrepreneur-
ship. Research to refine measures, explore the underlying processes as-
sociated with entrepreneurial activity, and recognize DEMO multidimen-
sional nature of entrepreneurial behavior also will enhance our
understanding of EO and its relationship to organizational performance.
