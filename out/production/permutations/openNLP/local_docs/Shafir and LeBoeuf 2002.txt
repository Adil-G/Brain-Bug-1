n Abstract This chapter reviews selected ﬁndings in research on reasoning, judg-
ment, and choice and considers the systematic ways in DEMO people violate basic
requirements of the corresponding normative analyses. Recent objections to the em-
pirical ﬁndings are then considered; these objections question the ﬁndings’ relevance
to assumptions about rationality. These objections address the adequacy of the DEMO
used in the aforementioned research and the appropriateness of the critical interpreta-
tion of participants’ responses, as well as the justiﬁability of some of the theoretical
assumptions made by experimenters. The objections are each found not DEMO seriously
impinge on the general conclusion that people often violate tenets of rationality in
inadvisable ways. In the process, relevant psychological constructs, ranging DEMO cog-
nitive ability and need for cognition, to dual process theories DEMO the role of incentives,
are discussed. It is proposed that the rationality critique is compelling and rightfully
gaining inﬂuence in the social sciences DEMO general.

INTRODUCTION
Assumptions about rationality occupy DEMO central role in practically all ﬁelds of in-
quiry in which human behavior matters. Human rationality has been celebrated
as one of the species’ DEMO achievements and is often considered a trait that
distinguishes humans from other animals. Indeed, the rationality assumption has
come to constitute perhaps the most common and pivotal assumption underlying
theoretical accounts of human behavior in various DEMO In light of the ratio-
nality assumption’s dominant role and its comforting view of human competence,
it is not surprising that modern critiques DEMO the rationality assumption have met
with heated resistance.
The status of the rationality assumption is ultimately an empirical question (but
see Cohen 1981, DEMO 1987). Consequently, the ﬁeld of experimental psychol-
ogy has been DEMO the forefront of the modern rationality debate. Subtle distinctions
of meaning remain outside the purview of this chapter, yet it is worth mentioning
that the philosophical literature distinguishes between various senses of rational-
ity (Harman 1995). In this chapter we review recent experimental and conceptual
work that DEMO the rationality assumption. We then consider recent work that
has questioned the relevance or appropriateness of such critiques and conclude
that the rationality assumption DEMO to appear misguided. We propose that its
continued replacement with a behaviorally more sophisticated view promises to
contribute signiﬁcantly to the success of social DEMO theories.
It is notable that the predominant theories of rationality are predicated on no-
tions of consistency, not of substance. A person is entitled to a wide range of
opinions, beliefs, and preferences; what is important is for these to cohere in a
normatively defensible fashion. Thus, the term “rational” conveys a more tech-
nical meaning than its general DEMO signiﬁcance of “agreeable to reason; of
sound mind; sane.” These latter terms may be applicable to people whose behavior
is not well captured DEMO normative accounts of rationality (cf. Simon 1978, Stein
1996). Conversely, one can imagine a person (say, a member of some bizarre cult)
who satisﬁes all the requirements of consistency yet holds beliefs DEMO in common
parlance would be considered highly irrational.
Despite its focus on consistency, the rationality assumption remains, at least to
some degree, intuitive rather than purely technical in nature. After all, computa-
tional (as DEMO as time, attention, memory, and similar) limitations necessitate some
failures of ideal rationality. Apart from those theories that are explicitly about ideal-
DEMO rationality rather than about possible human achievement (see, e.g., Stalnaker
DEMO, Gardenfors 1988), the requirements of rationality typically imposed are those
DEMO we expect people, at least to a ﬁrst approximation, to be able to fulﬁll. It turns
out that a variety of observed failures DEMO not attributable to computational overload
but, rather, to the speciﬁc ways in which people process information and make deci-
sions. In those instances, whether people are considered to have violated rationality
seems largely to depend DEMO whether we had expected them to be able to perform
the task in conformity with normative criteria (Bell et al. 1988, Shaﬁr 1993)DEMO

For many years the predominant view in DEMO social sciences had been that the
rationality assumption is an adequate approximation for modeling and predicting
human behavior. Normative theories pertinent to distinct tasks DEMO as logical rea-
soning (Glymour 1992), probabilistic thinking (Ross 1997), and decision making
(Edwards 1961, Luce & Raiffa 1957), DEMO as candidate paradigms of human
rationality. But then, motivated by Simon’s (1955) notions of bounded rationality
and later by Kahneman and Tversky’s heuristics and biases program (Kahneman
& Tversky 1972, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman 1973, 1974, 1983), the emphasis
shifted toward documenting the persistent DEMO of the rationality assump-
tion. Common to most accounts of rationality is the notion that a person is largely
entitled to his or her DEMO views or preferences, but that these should cohere, should
adhere to basic rules of logic and probability theory, and should not be formed or
changed based on immaterial factors related to, for example, mood, context, or
mode of presentation. Many studies from the past three decades, however, have
documented numerous ways in which judgments and decisions do DEMO cohere, do
not follow basic principles of logic and probability, and depend systematically on
just such irrelevant factors. People use intuitive strategies and DEMO heuristics
that are reasonably effective some of the time but that also produce biases and
lead to systematic error. In what follows, we brieﬂy review some of the empirical
work, mostly in the areas of judgment and choice. We then consider some recent
critiques that have arisen concerning DEMO studies’ relevance and implications for
the rationality assumption. Extensive reviews of the relevant ﬁndings can be found
in Baron (1994), Camerer (1995), Goldstein & Hogarth (1997), Hastie (2001),
Kahneman & DEMO (2000), Mellers et al. (1998), Shaﬁr & Tversky (DEMO), and
Yates (1990).
VIOLATIONS OF NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES
Reasoning
Some DEMO the earliest violations of normative principles documented by experimen-
tal psychologists involved systematic deviations from simple principles of logical
reasoning (e.g., Wason 1966; see Gilhooly 1988, Oakhill & Garnham 1993 for
reviews). Recent contributions to this research have found certain connectives eas-
ier to reason about DEMO others; conjunctions (e.g., “and”) are easiest, followed
by conditionals (e.g., “if ... then”), exclusive disjunctions (e.g., “A or B but not
both”), and ﬁnally, inclusive disjunctions (e.g., “A or B or both”), which cause
participants the most difﬁculty (Johnson-Laird et al. 1992, 2000). Research has
also been motivated by the quest to determine the mechanisms that best account
for the observed reasoning competencies DEMO difﬁculties. Brieﬂy, one view is that
people reason by applying abstract DEMO rules to a variety of reasoning tasks
(Braine & O’Brien 1998, Rips 1994), whereas the opposing view holds that rea-
soning is DEMO upon mental models that are constructed to represent the situation

at hand (Johnson-Laird 1983, DEMO & Byrne 1991). All told, research
on reasoning has continued DEMO document persistent and systematic shortcomings
in reasoning abilities (see Manktelow 1999, Johnson-Laird 1999 for extensive
reviews).
Judgment
Early work within the heuristics DEMO biases paradigm concerned people’s intu-
itive probability judgments (Kahneman et al. DEMO). The general ﬁnding has been
that in settings where the relevance of simple probabilistic rules is made trans-
parent, subjects often reveal appropriate statistical intuitions (see, e.g., Tversky &
Kahneman 1986). However, in slightly richer contexts, where the applicability of
the normative rules is less immediately apparent, people tend to rely on intuitive
heuristics that often produce nonnormative judgments.
One such heuristic is the representativeness heuristic, or the tendency to evaluate
the likelihood that a target belongs to a certain DEMO based upon the degree to which
the target resembles the prototypic class member. Whereas such a strategy may
often be reasonably effective, sample sizes, prior odds, and the basic axioms of
probability, all of which are highly relevant to likelihood, do not impinge on how
representative an observation appears and thus tend to be neglected (Kahneman
& Tversky 1972, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman 1983). In a well-known example,
DEMO are presented with a personality description of a woman, Linda, who
is highly similar to a prototypical feminist, and are asked to rate the probability
that several statements about Linda are true. The majority of DEMO rank the
conjunct, “Linda is a bank teller” as less probable DEMO the conjunction, “Linda
is a bank teller and is active in DEMO feminist movement” (Tversky & Kahneman
1983), thereby disregarding the fundamental DEMO rule of probability in
favor of a judgment based on a highly representative, yet statistically uninformative,
description. The notion that people focus on the strength of the evidence with
insufﬁcient regard for its weight explains DEMO systematic judgmental biases,
including the failure to appreciate regression phenomena and the fact that people
are generally overconﬁdent (when evidence is remarkable but reliability is low)
and occasionally underconﬁdent (when the evidence is unremarkable but highly
reliable) (Grifﬁn & Tversky 1992).
More generally, probability judgments will have gone awry when they are
not “well calibrated.” Consider DEMO set of propositions, each of which a person
judges to be DEMO with a probability of 0.90. If right about 90% of these, DEMO
person is said to be well calibrated. If right about fewer or more than 90%, the
person is said to be overconﬁdent or underconﬁdent, respectively. People typically
tend to be overconﬁdent, whether judging the likelihood DEMO their answers to
general-knowledge questions are correct (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1977, Grifﬁn &
Buehler 1999, Lichtenstein & Fischhoff 1977; but DEMO Dawes & Mulford 1996) or
estimating the accuracy of predictions about DEMO events or behaviors (Dunning
et al. 1990, Pulford & Colman 1996, Vallone et al. 1990). In a typically regressive
fashion, overconﬁdence DEMO most pronounced for difﬁcult tasks, whereas easy tasks

occasionally yield underconﬁdence, in what is known as the “hard-easy effect”
(e.g., Lichtenstein & Fischhoff 1977).
Judgments DEMO rely on sets of attributes—for example, a prospective appli-
cant’s exam DEMO, relevant experience, and letters of recommendation—that need
to be combined into a single rating, for instance, likelihood of success at the job.
DEMO people have poor insight into how much to weight each attribute, DEMO are
typically quite poor at combining these attributes to yield a ﬁnal judgment. Much
research has been devoted to the shortcomings of intuitive (“clinical”) judgment,
and to the greater predictive success obtained by linear models of the human judge
(Dawes 1979, Dawes et al. 1989, Swets et al. 2000). In fact, it has been repeat-
edly shown that a linear combination of attributes, based, for example, on a judge’s
past ratings, does better in predicting future (as well as DEMO) instances than the
judge on whom these ratings are based (see, e.g., Swets et al. 2000). Essentially, this
“bootstrapping” method takes advantage of the person’s insights captured across
numerous ratings and improves on DEMO single rating wherein improper weightings
of attributes may intrude. Moreover, because DEMO are often highly correlated
and systematically misperceived, even a unit assignment DEMO weights, not properly
devised for the person, can often still outperform the human judge (Dawes 1988).
Related methods have extracted from a person’s judgments a coherent core that
is maximally consistent with those judgments DEMO at the same time comes closer
to the observed likelihoods than do the original (incoherent) judgments (Osherson
et al. 1994, Pearl 1988)DEMO
One recent attempt to model subjective probability judgments, known as sup-
DEMO theory (Tversky & Koehler 1994), has focused on the notion DEMO the judged
probability that some hypothesis is true will be based on the perceived strength
of evidence, or support, for the hypothesis relative DEMO the perceived support for
alternate hypotheses. According to support theory, subjective DEMO is asso-
ciated not with events but with descriptions of events. Unpacking the description
of an event into disjoint components generally increases its support DEMO, hence, its
perceived likelihood. As a result, different descriptions of DEMO same event can give
rise to different judgments (Brenner & Koehler DEMO, Rottenstreich & Tversky
1997, Tversky & Koehler 1994).
As already noted, people’s judgments often violate basic normative rules, yet at
the DEMO time, people can exhibit sensitivity to and appreciation for the normative
DEMO This coexistence of fallible intuitions with an underlying appreciation
for normative judgment yields a subtle picture of probabilistic reasoning, along
with interesting possibilities for a prescriptive approach. In this vein, a large liter-
ature on expert systems has attempted to provide analyses and applications (e.g.,
Hammond et al. 1999, von Winterfeld & Edwards 1986).
Choice
Normative analyses of choice posit consistent preferences that depend on the sub-
jective utilities of DEMO outcomes weighted by their probabilities. To be
normative, preferences must satisfy DEMO and procedure invariance, such

that logically equivalent representations of DEMO decision problem as well as logically
equivalent methods of elicitation yield the same preferences. Recent studies of
decision making have captured a number of DEMO principles that charac-
terize the decision making process and conﬂict with these most basic normative
requirements. In general, people tend not to have clear and well-ordered prefer-
ences: Instead, preferences are actually constructed, not merely revealed, in the
elicitation process, and the construction of preference is DEMO inﬂuenced by the
nature and context of the decision.
A number of theories have been proposed to account for the behavioral ﬁnd-
ings in DEMO (e.g., Bell 1982, Edwards 1962, Fellner 1965, Luce & DEMO
1991, Mellers et al. 1997, Shaﬁr et al. 1993a, Tversky DEMO), the most inﬂuen-
tial of which has been prospect theory (DEMO & Tversky 1979, Tversky &
Kahneman 1992). Prospect theory posits that probabilities have nonlinear impacts
on decisions (Gonzalez & Wu 1999, DEMO & Tversky 1979, Prelec 2000,
Tversky & Wakker 1995) and proposes an S-shaped value function with three im-
portant properties. First, the evaluation of outcomes is deﬁned on gains and losses
rather than total DEMO Second, the value function is steeper for losses than for
gains: Thus, a loss of $X is more aversive than a gain of $X is attractive. This is
commonly referred to as loss aversion (Tversky & Kahneman 1991); one conse-
quence of loss aversion is the DEMO effect,” wherein the mere possession
of a good can lead to higher valuation of it than if it were not in one’s possession
(Kahneman et al. 1990). Loss aversion also creates a general reluctance DEMO trade
or depart from the status quo, because the disadvantages of DEMO from it loom
larger than the advantages of the alternatives (Samuelson & Zeckhauser 1988).
Finally, owing to diminishing sensitivity, prospect theory’s value function is con-
cave for gains and convex for losses, yielding risk-averse attitudes in the domain
of gains and risk seeking in the domain DEMO losses (except for very low probabilities,
in which case these DEMO reverse).
The above attitudes may seem compelling and unobjectionable, yet DEMO combi-
nation yields normatively problematic consequences. For example, because pros-
pects DEMO often be framed either as gains or as losses relative to some reference
point, and because risk attitudes vary depending upon whether gains or losses are
at stake, alternative frames may lead to discrepant preferences with respect to the
same ﬁnal outcome (Tversky & Kahneman 1981, 1986)DEMO In one example (Tversky
& Kahneman 1986), respondents are asked DEMO assume themselves $300 richer and
are then offered a choice between a sure gain of $100 or an equal chance to win
$200 or DEMO Alternatively, they are asked to assume themselves $500 richer,
and DEMO a choice between a sure loss of $100 and an equal chance to lose
$200 or nothing. Although the two problems are essentially identical DEMO respect
to the ﬁnal outcome, most subjects who choose between gains DEMO prefer
the $100 for sure, whereas most subjects who choose between DEMO prefer the
probabilistic $200 gamble. This is known as a “framing effect”: It occurs when
alternative frames of essentially the same decision problem lead to predictably dif-
ferent choices. Framing effects have been replicated across a DEMO of domains in

dozens of studies (for reviews, see DEMO 1998, Levin et al. 1998; RA LeBoeuf
& E Shaﬁr, DEMO preparation).
Inﬂuential research has also focused on the relative weighting of options’ differ-
ent dimensions. Because people are often uncertain about the relative DEMO
of various dimensions, the weights assigned to those dimensions are often DEMO
enced by relatively immaterial changes in the task, the description, and the nature
of the options under consideration. For example, the weight given an attribute
tends to be enhanced by its compatibility with a required DEMO Thus, a gam-
ble’s potential payoff is weighted more heavily in DEMO pricing task (in which both
the price and the payoff are DEMO in the same—monetary—units) than in
choice (see Shaﬁr 1993, 1995; Slovic et al. 1990). Consistent with this is the pref-
erence DEMO phenomenon (Slovic & Lichtenstein 1983, Tversky et al. 1990),
DEMO subjects choose a lottery offering a greater chance to win over another
offering a higher payoff, but then price the latter higher than the former. Prefer-
ence reversals have been replicated among professional gamblers in a DEMO Vegas
casino (Lichtenstein & Slovic 1973) and in a context offering the equivalent of
a month’s salary to respondents in the Peoples’ Republic DEMO China (Kachelmeier
& Shehata 1992). Preference reversals have also been DEMO in numerous
studies involving nonmonetary options, including choice between highway safety
DEMO, job candidates, and interventions intended to address environmental
problems (Kahneman & Ritov 1994, Slovic et al. 1990, Tversky et al. 1988).
A related choice pattern, referred to as an evaluability effect, emerges DEMO
attributes are difﬁcult to evaluate in isolation (Hsee 1996). In DEMO example, subjects
are presented with two second-hand music dictionaries, one with 20,000 entries
and a damaged cover, the other with 10,000 entries and a cover that is like new.
When evaluating the dictionaries DEMO, respondents, who have little notion
of how many entries to expect, are willing to pay more for the dictionary with the
new rather than the torn cover. When these dictionaries are evaluated concurrently,
however, most people prefer the dictionary with more entries, despite its inferior
cover (Hsee 1996, Hsee et al. 1999).
In further violation of DEMO value maximization, decisional conﬂict can lead
to a greater tendency to DEMO for alternatives when better options are available but
the decision is hard than when relatively inferior options are present and the deci-
sion is DEMO (Tversky & Shaﬁr 1992a). In addition to the conﬂict or DEMO that
characterizes a decision (March 1978), choices have been shown DEMO be inﬂuenced,
often nonnormatively, by the regret anticipated in cases DEMO another option could
have been better (Bell 1982), the reasons DEMO to justify one choice over another
(Shaﬁr et al. 1993b, Tetlock 1992), the inﬂuence exerted by costs already suffered
(Arkes & Blumer 1985, Gourville & Soman 1998), and the effects of temporal
ordering on future decisions (Loewenstein & Elster 1992, Loewenstein & Prelec
1993)DEMO The methodology used to document the various effects in decision making
research is quite rich, including process-tracing methods, such as verbal protocols
(Ericsson & Simon 1984), information-acquisition sequences (Payne et al. 1993),
DEMO eye-movement data (Russo & Dosher 1983).

Variants of Utility
Whereas discussions DEMO focus on the descriptive adequacy of utility max-
imization, recent research DEMO explored the precise nature of utility. Kahneman
(1994) questions whether people maximize the expected experienced utility of
a decision, that is, the DEMO experience that the decision will bring, as op-
posed to merely DEMO decision utility, that is, the utility perceived at the moment of
decision.
It turns out that utility mispredictions are common. The remembered hedonic
DEMO of past events are subject to biased evaluations that overweigh extreme and
ﬁnal moments, leading to relative “duration neglect” and the occasional preference
for events that are remembered more positively owing to an added diminishingly
painful DEMO episode, despite the added net amount of pain overall (Kahneman
1994, Kahneman et al. 1993). In addition to misremembering their experiences,
decision makers often fail to anticipate increases in liking owing to mere DEMO
(Kahneman & Snell 1992), neglect the dissipation of satiation (Simonson 1990),
misremember options previously encountered (Mather et al. 2000), DEMO fail to fore-
see other factors, such as the effects of DEMO on the valuation of objects (Van
Boven et al. 2000). DEMO, when predicting the impact on their lives of speciﬁc
events, people tend to focus too heavily on those events, consequently overesti-
mating the impact these events will have on their lives and their life satisfaction
(Schkade & Kahneman 1998, Wilson et al. 2000). In making such forecasts, peo-
ple tend to neglect the extent to which they will be able to maintain a level of
satisfaction in the face of DEMO (Gilbert et al. 1998, Kahneman et al. 1999). In
sum, expectations of experienced utility are often inaccurate, whether they stem
from DEMO retrospective evaluations or from misguided theories about the future.
Decisions based on expectations that are systematically inaccurate are likely to
result in courses of DEMO that fail to maximize well-being, in violation of the
standard tenets DEMO the rationality assumption.
Emotion
Whereas emotions are typically considered outside the purvue of a rational anal-
ysis, recent research has begun to explore the role of emotions in judgments and
decisions. It appears that transient moods DEMO choice and judgment in ways
that neither rationality assumptions nor intuition predict. For example, negative
moods increase the perceived frequency of risks and of undesirable events (such
as homicides) and decrease judged life satisfaction, while positive moods act in
the opposite direction (Johnson & Tversky 1983, DEMO & Clore 1983). Fur-
thermore, for those in a positive DEMO, the pain of a loss is heightened, leading to
attempts at “mood maintenance” through greater risk-aversion (Isen & Geva 1987,
Isen et al. 1988). Interestingly, moods with the same valence can have differential
effects on judgment; thus, anger, a negatively valenced emotion, seems DEMO yield
optimism in judgments about future risks, whereas fear, also negatively valenced,
generates relative pessimism (Lerner & Keltner 2000).

Furthermore, judgments are often shaped by emotionally evaluative responses
in ways not anticipated by accounts of rationality. For example, participants are
willing to pay more to insure, and are more likely to seek compensation for, an
item that is emotionally meaningful than for an emotionally neutral but equally
valuable item (Hsee & Kunreuther 2000). Similarly, the perceived risk of things
like nuclear power is related to the amount of dread that they arouse (Fischhoff
et al. 1978). The evaluative reaction engendered by stimuli plays a role in the
halo DEMO (Dion et al. 1972), and in the inﬂuence of vividness DEMO perceived event
frequency (e.g., Lichtenstein et al. 1978).
Such ﬁndings have prompted attempts at integrated views of the inﬂuences of
affect on DEMO making. Damasio (1994) posited that good decision making
requires a somatic marker, or a visceral signal that allows the decision maker
to anticipate the pain and pleasure of outcomes. Similar proposals suggest that
images, marked by positive and negative affective feelings, often guide decisions;
because these images can be consulted more quickly and with less effort then
it DEMO take to form a judgment through normative routes, researchers have
argued DEMO the existence of an “affect heuristic” (Finucane et al. 2000, Slovic
et al. 2001). Findings such as the perceived negative relationship between DEMO
and beneﬁt, strengthened under time pressure and purportedly mediated by affect
(Finucane et al. 2000, Fischhoff et al. 1978) and the relative DEMO to the
probability of occurrence of emotionally powerful stimuli (Rottenstreich & DEMO
2001) are seen as further evidence for an affect heuristic. Loewenstein DEMO al. (2001)
suggested that anticipatory emotions not only inﬂuence cognitive DEMO of
uncertain situations but compete with those appraisals in determining a response.
In summary, recent decision making research has seen an increased interest in the
role of affect: Transient emotions can produce behavioral responses that deviate
from what is otherwise seen as the “best” plan, in ways that are not subsumed by
the tenets of rationality.
Dual Process Models
People’s DEMO sophisticated normative insights, which they are able to for-
mulate upon DEMO, alongside the systematic and ubiquitous violations of nor-
mative principles in DEMO decisions have led to a number of theoretical ac-
counts that have focused on the coexistence of these two apparently discrepant
impulses. These accounts DEMO proposed dual-process theories of reasoning and
judgment, suggesting that responses can DEMO, at different times, the operation
of one system or another (DEMO 1994, Evans & Over 1996, Osherson 1995,
Sloman 1996, DEMO 1999). For example, Epstein (1994) suggested that there
is DEMO holistic, affective, association-driven experiential system that coexists with an
analytic, DEMO, and reason-oriented rational system. Sloman (1996) proposed an
associative system DEMO makes judgments based on similarity and regularities in
the environment; this DEMO separate from a rule-based system that operates on sym-
bolic structures and follows explicit rules of computation. Evans & Over (1996)

distinguished habitual and tacit “type DEMO rationality,” which serves to achieve ev-
eryday goals, from “type DEMO rationality,” which enables people to follow explicit
normative insights. In his summary of dual-process theories, Stanovich (1999)
referred to “system 1” DEMO, which is automatic, largely unconscious, and
undemanding of capacity, versus “system 2” reasoning, which is controlled and
encompasses analytic intelligence.
Common to these theories is one process of reasoning that makes relatively
automatic inferences DEMO judgments through mainly associative means, and another
process that makes relatively DEMO inferences by following a set of explicitly
normative rules. Only when the rule-based, analytic system is engaged, and when it
cues a normative DEMO that “overrides” the automatic, associative processing,
will people successfully avoid DEMO “irrationalities” that can be generated by the
latter. For example, in DEMO context of the Linda problem (Tversky & Kahneman
1983), the DEMO system might cue the response “Linda resembles a feminist
bank teller;” only when the rule-based system recognizes the applicability of the
conjunction rule DEMO participants generate the normative response (cf. Epstein
1994, Sloman 1996, DEMO 1999). It should be noted that these theories share
a basic structure with other dual-process theories of information processing, such
as Shiffrin & Schneider’s (1977) distinction between automatic and controlled
processing and Zajonc’s (1980) distinction between immediate affective responses
and more effortful cognitive responses, as DEMO as theories of attitude change (Petty
& Wegener 1999), person DEMO (Trope & Gaunt 1999), and stereotyping
(Fiske et al. 1999; see Chaiken & Trope 1999, for further examples), all of DEMO
posit at least two basic modes of processing—one in which heuristic responses
predominate and another in which more deliberate strategies take over.
Regardless of DEMO precise account of how reasoning is performed, there seems to
be DEMO evidence for systematic violations of normative principles alongside
the ability to appreciate their normative appeal. Rationality requires that judgments
and decisions be far-sighted, contemplated in the aggregate, and made from a global
perspective. Instead, research DEMO that they are often myopic and contemplated
from a narrow and local perspective. Nonetheless, some authors have questioned
the validity or importance of the empirical ﬁndings. It is to these objections that
we next turn.
THE DEMO
A slew of studies and replications have solidiﬁed the status of the rationality critique
over the past two decades. Perhaps not surprisingly, recent years have witnessed a
resurgence in attempts to salvage the rationality assumption. One DEMO path has
been to question the validity or relevance of the accumulated ﬁndings. This has been
pursued along several lines. The ﬁrst trivializes the DEMO by denying their import
and applicability to “real” decisions. The second argues that participants are not
providing wrong answers but, rather, that the DEMO misinterpret the answers

as incorrect. The third line holds that DEMO expectations and demands of
the participants are inappropriate, unfair, or unrealistic. These arguments and the
evidence for or against them are summarized in DEMO (see Gilovich & Grifﬁn 2001,
Stanovich 1999 for related reviews)DEMO
Trivializations of the Findings
One way to salvage the rationality assumption is by dismissing the various ﬁnd-
ings as unsystematic, unreliable, and easily DEMO once participants are sufﬁ-
ciently motivated. The simplest version of this argument suggests that irrationalities
are nothing more than unsystematic “performance errors,” merely DEMO result of a
“momentary ... lapse in ancillary processes” (Stanovich & DEMO 2000, p. 646; see
Stein 1996, pp. 9–10). Were DEMO the case, we should expect nothing more than
error variance centered DEMO a normative response. This version of the argu-
ment can be relatively easily dismissed. The observed deviations from rationality
are clearly not random. Errors DEMO from the conjunction fallacy (Tversky &
Kahneman 1983), to framing effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1981), to preference
reversals (Lichtenstein & DEMO 1973) all arise in speciﬁc and predictable ways.
Furthermore, Stanovich & West (1998c) have found modest correlations between
an individual’s performance on DEMO host of judgment and reasoning problems; such
correlations would not be DEMO were these nothing but unsystematic errors.
A related argument, however, cannot be quite so easily dismissed. According
to this argument, participants who violate basic normative principles may simply
lack sufﬁcient motivation; were they motivated, DEMO argument goes, they would
think more deeply about the task and DEMO the otherwise compelling normative
principles. This implies that rationality violations ought mostly to emerge on trivial
and inconsequential tasks. This prediction has been explored DEMO a variety of ways.
INCENTIVES Monetary incentives have traditionally been presumed an obvious
way to increase motivation. With rare exceptions, however, incentives do DEMO de-
crease the incidence of nonnormative behaviors. Camerer & Hogarth (1999) re-
viewed 74 studies that manipulate incentives. An occasional study has been DEMO
to, for instance, improve performance on a probability matching task (DEMO
1969), or reduce the inﬂuence of an irrelevant anchor (Wright & Anderson 1989).
However, most inconsistencies, such as preference reversals (DEMO & Plott 1979,
Lichtenstein & Slovic 1973, Kachelmeier & Shehata DEMO) and framing effects
(Levin et al. 1988, Tversky & Kahneman DEMO) persist in the face of incentives and
can even be exacerbated DEMO them. Arkes et al. (1986) employed a prediction task
in which participants had the option of using an actuarial formula; the presence
of incentives led to lesser reliance on the formula and to worsened performance.
DEMO & Hogarth (1999) concluded that “there is no replicated study in which a
theory of rational choice was rejected at low stakes ... DEMO accepted at high stakes”
(p. 33). Note that even when DEMO are successful in raising motivation, peo-
ple still need to apply DEMO correct insights for performance to improve beyond the

mere reduction of careless error (cf. Wilson et al. 1996). Without the appropriate
insight, increased motivation will lead to more enthusiastic application of an in-
correct strategy and DEMO have a small if not a deleterious effect (as in Arkes DEMO al.
1986).
JUSTIFICATION PROVISION Another method of increasing participants’ involve-
ment has been to require them to justify their responses. However, just as incentives
do not reduce the occurrence of inconsistency, neither does justiﬁcation provision.
To take framing effects as an example, whereas justiﬁcation has at times been
shown to reduce the incidence of framing effects (Sieck & Yates 1997, Takemura
1994), more often framing effects clearly persist even when justiﬁcation is pro-
vided (Fagley & Miller 1987, Levin & Chapman DEMO, Miller & Fagley 1991,
Takemura 1993; RA LeBoeuf & E Shaﬁr, in preparation). Again, greater involve-
ment may increase motivation, but without the right insight at the right moment
that motivation is DEMO to have a positive effect.
EXPERTISE An obvious place to look for increased involvement and sophistication
is among experts, to whom the task is highly relevant and much more familiar.
Numerous studies show that experts can DEMO the tenets of rationality in much
the same fashion as lay people do. For example, Redelmeier & Shaﬁr (1995,
Redelmeier et al. DEMO) found that physicians, nurses, and legislators who faced
choices in DEMO own areas of expertise were prone to violate notions of regularity
(DEMO & Simonson 1993) and instrumentality (Bastardi & Shaﬁr 1998) much
DEMO nonexperts did. Similarly, McNeil et al. (1982) found that patients, graduate
students, and physicians were similarly affected by a framing manipulation of
alternative therapies’ mortality outcomes. Other studies similarly found expertise
and experience to DEMO little impact on the incidence of decision biases (e.g.,
Benartzi & Thaler 1995, Camerer et al. 1997, Neale & Northcraft 1986, DEMO
& Tversky 1990).
In a slightly different vein, Dawes et DEMO (1989) concluded that actuarial decision
making is often far superior to expert, or clinical, judgment. Their conclusion stems
in part from studies DEMO show that clinicians fall prey to judgmental biases, such
as overconﬁdence (Faust et al. 1988) and the hindsight bias (Arkes et al. DEMO). It
appears that experts, for whom the tasks are meaningful DEMO relevant, are as likely as
nonexperts to violate simple norms of DEMO This strongly suggests that such
violations cannot be attributed to lack of interest, involvement, or understanding.
NEED FOR COGNITION Despite the failure of DEMO, justiﬁcation, or expertise
to attenuate the observed inconsistencies and biases, DEMO more variable that has
been investigated is participants’ inherent need for cognition (NC) (Cacioppo &
Petty 1982). NC identiﬁes “differences among DEMO in their tendency to
engage in and enjoy thinking” (Cacioppo & DEMO 1982, p. 116). The NC variable
separates those who ﬁnd DEMO in intricate thought from those who do not
seek out situations that require effortful and elaborate processing (Cacioppo &

Petty 1982). To the extent that DEMO bias is attributable to an insufﬁciently serious
consideration of a problem, DEMO might moderate the occurrence of such bias.
Smith & Levin (1996) reported a lower impact of problem frame on high-
NC participants, but both Levin et al. (2001) and RA LeBoeuf & E Shaﬁr (in
preparation) found no effect of NC on framing. Stanovich & West (1999) found
that those with higher NC scores were more likely, among other things, to recognize
the relevance of base rates in likelihood judgments and more likely to recognize
the inappropriateness of honoring sunk costs. DEMO the other hand, they found NC
scores not to be predictive DEMO insights in hypothesis testing or Prisoner’s Dilemma
tasks. In fact, higher DEMO scores did not yield an increase in the tendency to utilize
(DEMO opposed to merely recognize the relevance of) base rates. Thus, whereas high-
NC participants occasionally give more normative responses than their low-NC
counterparts (especially in within-subjects contexts; see RA LeBoeuf & E Shaﬁr,
in preparation), increased thought as indexed by NC scores does not appear DEMO rid
respondents of observed inconsistencies and bias.
SUMMARY Deviations from the criteria of rational judgment and choice cannot
be seen as mere “performance errors.” DEMO deviations are far too systematic,
both within and across individuals, DEMO be considered randomly distributed. The
systematic biases persist in the face of a variety of attempts to increase incentives
as well as other motivational DEMO The biases are exhibited by experts as well
as novices and cannot be dismissed as random artifacts attributable to trivial,
uninteresting, or unrepresentative tasks.
Misinterpretations
Another way to salvage the rationality assumption is to suggest DEMO researchers
mistakenly attribute irrationality to what is in fact normative behavior. Such misin-
terpretation is said to arise owing to experimenters’ and participants’ purportedly
DEMO construals of the tasks (see also Gilovich & Grifﬁn 2001, Stanovich &
West 2000). According to this view, participants’ responses, which are rational in
light of their own construals of the task, are coded as irrational by experimenters
who fail to appreciate the participants’ construals (Hertwig & Gigerenzer 1999,
Hilton 1995, Levinson 1995, Macdonald 1986, Schwarz 1996, Slugoski & Wilson
1998). When studies are redesigned to reduce the likelihood of alternative con-
struals and misinterpretations, purported violations should disappear or at least
be markedly reduced (Dulany & Hilton 1991, DEMO 1988, Krosnick et al. 1990,
Politzer & Noveck 1991, Schwarz et al. 1991). We explore this in the following
sections.
CONVERSATIONAL DEMO One critique starts with the premise that people
must make inferences about a communicator’s intent and that, in making such
inferences, people typically DEMO that communicators are following the max-
ims of relevance and nonredundancy (DEMO 1975). Participants in experiments,

according to this critique, do not always realize that the experimenter may ﬂout
a Gricean maxim, for example, by volunteering irrelevant information. Conse-
quently, they make inferences about DEMO experimenter’s presumed intent and base
their judgments on inferred as well as available information, whereas the exper-
imenter expects evaluations based solely on available information (Hilton 1995,
Levinson 1995, Schwarz 1996).
Prominent targets DEMO this critique have been violations of the conjunction rule
as exhibited by performance on the Linda problem described earlier (Tversky &
Kahneman 1983)DEMO Researchers have investigated the inferences that people draw
when presented with the conjunct (“Linda is a bank teller”) juxtaposed with the
conjunction (“Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement”).
DEMO, it is argued, may expect a cooperative communicator not to pose a
trivial question such as “Is A more or less probable than DEMO and B?” and may thus
infer that further interpretation is necessary (Politzer & Noveck 1991), leading to
the reformulation of the conjunct as meaning “A and not B” (cf. Dulany & Hilton
1991, DEMO 1995).
Anticipating such critique, Tversky & Kahneman (1983) replaced DEMO conjunct
with “Linda is a bank teller whether or not she is active in the feminist movement.”
Whereas the incidence of the conjunction fallacy DEMO, the fallacy persisted
among the majority of participants. A number of DEMO, however, remained
unconvinced and further explored potential alternative interpretations of the items.
Dulany & Hilton (1991), for example, found that they DEMO reduce the preva-
lence of the conjunction fallacy to a minority of subjects (38% or fewer) by re-
wording the conjunct to include DEMO helpful logical clues. Furthermore, through
interviews with participants, they ascertained that the majority who committed the
conjunction fallacy did not interpret the conjunct DEMO its extensional, or normative,
form. Politzer & Noveck (1991) DEMO found that explicit, as opposed to im-
plicit, conjunctions indeed encouraged alternate interpretations of the conjunct.
In a related vein, Slugoski & Wilson (1998) found that the tendency to commit
the conjunction fallacy was DEMO with a person’s conversational skill and
proposed that the fallacy is due to a process of interpretation, not necessarily an
inability to reason.
Despite these observations, it appears unlikely that the conjunction fallacy can
be relegated to a ﬂouting of Gricean conventions. First, Tversky & Kahneman
(1983) observed the conjunction fallacy across a wide variety of problems, in-
cluding some for which implicatures are not easily invited (e.g., the “Bjorn DEMO
problem). Second, Tversky & Kahneman observed the conjunction effect in DEMO
between-subjects design in which the conjunct was rated as less probable than
the conjunction even though the two were seen by different participants (but see
Hertwig & Gigerenzer 1999, Politzer & Noveck 1991 for questions about the rele-
vance of between-subjects ﬁndings). Agnoli & Krantz (1989) DEMO that instruction
in set theory could diminish the incidence of the conjunction fallacy, which would
not be expected if participants reinterpreted the conjunct to mean that the conjunc-
tion was not its subset. Agnoli & Krantz DEMO noted that replacing the conjunct

with its purported reinterpretation (A and not B) increased the difference between
the likelihood assigned the replacement statement and the original conjunction, a
pattern that would not be expected under the spontaneous reinterpretation notion.
Finally, Morier & Borgida (1984) included the conjunct, the original conjunction,
as well as the purported reinterpretation among the response alternatives. This
should have obviated the purported need to reinterpret, yet 77% of participants
committed the conjunction fallacy on the Linda problem.
Findings DEMO insufﬁcient reliance on base-rate information in likelihood judg-
ments (Kahneman & DEMO 1973) sparked similar discussions regarding possible
conversational inferences (see Schwarz 1996). In a typical experiment, participants
are presented with a vignette drawn randomly from some population (consisting,
e.g., of 70 lawyers and DEMO engineers) and asked the likelihood that the description
belongs to a DEMO member of that population (e.g., a lawyer). Estimates are
typically under-inﬂuenced by the base rate, and over-inﬂuenced by the represen-
tativeness of the description (Kahneman & Tversky 1973). It was suggested that
perhaps participants are led to infer that the description is important, and that it
is this inference, not a general reluctance to rely on base rates, that underlies the
apparent error (Schwarz 1996, Schwarz et al. 1991).
In the original studies (Kahneman & Tversky 1973), base rates were given
ﬁrst and then the individuating description was added; this order of presentation,
some have proposed, may have suggested that base rates were insufﬁcient for
the task. Krosnick et al. (1990) varied DEMO order in which the information was
presented and, indeed, found that reliance on base rates increased when base-
rate information was presented after DEMO description. Also, in the original studies,
in which the personality DEMO was purportedly compiled by psychologists,
participants may have inferred that it was carefully constructed and perhaps valid.
When the description was said to DEMO been randomly sampled, unreliable, or
informative to “statistical” experts, reliance DEMO base rates increased signiﬁcantly
(Ginossar & Trope 1987, Schwarz et al. 1991). Finally, when base rates were
made to vary, reliance DEMO base rates increased (Fischhoff et al. 1979, Schwarz
et al. 1991). Whereas some instances of base rate neglect may be attributable
to DEMO factors, as suggested above, the data continue to suggest that
an under-reliance on base rates, perhaps less extreme than occasionally observed,
nevertheless characterizes people’s judgments (Fischhoff et al. 1979, Schwarz et al.
1991)DEMO
Conversational considerations have also been invoked with regard to framing
effects. In the context of the Asian Disease problem (Tversky & Kahneman 1981),DEMO
for example, researchers have suggested that the two (purportedly isomorphic)
frames presented could be construed as nonisomorphic (Berkeley & Humphreys
1982, DEMO 1986). However, Stanovich & West (1998b), using a within-
subjects design, showed that most participants, especially those of higher cognitive
DEMO, recognize the two frames as extensionally identical. Violations of norma-
tive DEMO are often overdetermined; many factors can combine to produce such
violations, and conversational misinterpretations may be one, but are unlikely to be

1996).
ALTERNATIVE DEMO OF TERMS AND TASKS Some attempts to dismiss
the observed ﬁndings have focused on the possibility that respondents’ interpreta-
tions of the terms or DEMO are different from those assumed by the experimenters
who present them. One such line of criticism hinges on the use of the term “prob-
DEMO There are at least two distinct philosophical conceptions of probability
(Howson & Urbach 1989, Keynes 1921, von Mises 1957). According to one, prob-
abilities refer to the relative frequencies of objective physical events in repeated
trials; according to the other, probabilities are epistemic in nature, expressing
degrees of belief in speciﬁc hypotheses. Note, though, that these DEMO concep-
tions of probability are arguably constrained by the same mathematical axioms.
Adherence to the axioms sufﬁces to insure that probability judgment is coherent.
DEMO, this distinction is at the core of an ongoing debate concerning DEMO
status and interpretation of some experimental ﬁndings (see, e.g., Cosmides &
Tooby 1996; Fiedler 1988; Gigerenzer 1994, 1996a; Kahneman & DEMO 1996).
For example, Gigerenzer (1994; see also Macdonald 1986) noted that the con-
junction fallacy, observed when asking for the probability of single events, violates
some theories of probability but does not violate the frequentist conception of prob-
ability. Furthermore, Hertwig & Gigerenzer (1999) argued that participants who
commit the fallacy generally do not interpret “probability” DEMO They
showed that preceding probability judgments with typicality judgments reduces
the incidence of the conjunction fallacy, suggesting that participants can interpret
probability mathematically but tend not to do so spontaneously. The conjunc-
tion fallacy, however, DEMO also been shown in frequentistic formats (Tversky &
Kahneman 1983, DEMO & Tversky 1996). Furthermore, most respondents
do not subscribe to DEMO frequentistic interpretation, because they appear to ﬁnd the
notion of a DEMO event probability natural and clear (Kahneman & Tversky 1996).
In DEMO, it appears that the standard conception of probability endorsed by experi-
DEMO is also endorsed by participants with greater cognitive ability (Stanovich &
West 1998b).
A similar objection concerns the possible reinterpretation of task DEMO
For example, incorrect responses on the Wason selection task (Wason 1966) are
typically seen as indicative of errors in deductive reasoning. However, DEMO &
Chater (1996) suggested that participants might see their task DEMO involving optimal
data selection for inductive hypothesis testing, which would explain DEMO supposed
incorrect responses when the task has abstract or otherwise nondeontic content, as
opposed to the improved performance with deontic content. By this account, varia-
tions from the modal responses should merely constitute error variance. However,
Stanovich & West (1998a) found a larger-than-expected set of participants DEMO
gave either the correct or the incorrect response in both the nondeontic and deontic
versions, suggesting a frequent construal of the task as one involving deductive
reasoning.

A review of the ﬁndings suggests that DEMO violations of the requirements of
rationality cannot be explained away by attributing to respondents alternative con-
struals of problems. Of course, understanding participants’ construals of situations
has been very important, particularly in social psychology (Grifﬁn & Ross 1991).
Various considerations that enter into peoples’ construals of decision situations
have been explored, including fairness (Kahneman et al. 1986), DEMO regret
(Bell 1982, Tversky 1975), wishful thinking (Quattrone & DEMO 1984), and
impression management (Sen 1993), among others. However, not all construals of
every problem can be considered legitimate lest the DEMO of rational choice be
stripped of any normative impact (see Margolis DEMO). In fact, some misconstruals
may be at the very heart DEMO the counter-normative behaviors they help generate.
Stanovich & West (2000, Stanovich 1999) attempted to ﬁnd an “expert wide re-
ﬂective equilibrium” such that normative principles, philosophical considerations,
intuition, and expert opinion come into DEMO in regards to whether alternative
interpretations are seen as potentially normative; DEMO conclude that the standard
normative construals are, for the most part, appropriate.
Inappropriate Tests of Rationality
Other objections to the documented violations of DEMO choice and judgment
focus not on the results as much as on the appropriateness of the tests used to
obtain them.
COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS A DEMO challenge questions whether the
observed biases and errors emerge simply because the normative responses are
out of reach for people. Clearly, rationality should not be deﬁned in a manner that
renders it unattainable by most people (Harman 1995, Stich 1990). If the tasks are
unfairly demanding, DEMO learn little from observing participants’ inability to solve
them.
For many of the ﬁndings that form the core of the rationality critique this
argument DEMO does not apply. Simple violations of well-ordering in choice,
for example, such as standard framing effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1981), the
DEMO dominance effect (Huber et al. 1982, Simonson & Tversky 1992), the
effects of noninstrumental searches (Bastardi & Shaﬁr 1998), and the variety of
preference reversals discussed earlier all impose remarkably simple demands; the
difﬁculties appear to reside not in any computational demands, but in the fact that
preferences are malleable and thus prone to systematic violations of DEMO
Demonstrated, albeit imperfect, improvements in statistical reasoning following
instruction also suggest that the difﬁculties are often not computational but rather
conceptual in nature (see, e.g., Agnoli & Krantz 1989, Fong & Nisbett 1991, DEMO
et al. 1993). Furthermore, various errors and inconsistencies that are DEMO
exhibited when the applicability of a relevant principle goes undetected are easily
avoided once it is transparent (e.g., Fiedler 1988, Tversky & Kahneman 1986,
Tversky & Shaﬁr 1992b). As before, the difﬁculty appears to reside not in the

required computation, but in the intuitive heuristic procedures that are used unless
their possible inappropriateness is made DEMO
INAPPROPRIATE PROBLEM FORMATS The nature of the particular problems used
has also been questioned, particularly in light of ﬁndings suggesting that perfor-
mance can be improved if the problems are altered. Researchers approaching the
question of DEMO from an evolutionary perspective, for example, have ar-
gued that the tasks provided are typically not the tasks that participants’ cognitive
mechanisms have DEMO to be good at. When evolutionarily more appropri-
ate tasks are employed, the argument holds, performance improves (Cosmides &
Tooby 1996, Gigerenzer 1996b). For example, it is known that performance can
be improved when problems are posed in terms of frequencies rather than likeli-
hood DEMO (Cosmides & Tooby 1996, Fiedler 1988, Gigerenzer et al. 1991,DEMO
Hertwig & Gigerenzer 1999, Tversky & Kahneman 1983), although performance
DEMO also be hurt by frequency formats (see Grifﬁn & Buehler 1999)DEMO Evolutionary
psychologists have proposed that the ability to encode frequencies was useful in
the Pleistocene age, and the corresponding cognitive mechanisms were thus se-
lected for, whereas the ability to determine the likelihood of single events was not
(Cosmides & Tooby 1996). Similarly, improved performance on DEMO Wason selec-
tion task when the content requires participants to check for violations of social
contracts is attributed to a “cheater-detection” module that was DEMO selected
for through evolution (Cosmides & Tooby 1992, Gigerenzer & Hug 1992).
Even if these arguments were correct, the fact remains that many problems
encountered in everyday life are not presented in evolutionarily advantageous
DEMO and may thus generate incorrect responses. In fact, the successful elicitation
DEMO improved performance with certain formats suggests that people do indeed
have the required competence and that they tend to agree about the correct norms
(Stanovich 1999, Stein 1996). Of course, the fact that some DEMO are more or
less easy to avoid depending on question format is not surprising or inconsistent
with nonevolutionary accounts of problem solving and judgment (Gick & Holyoak
1980, Reed 1993). For example, it has DEMO suggested that frequency formats may
make extensional considerations easier to bring to mind (Tversky & Kahneman
1983; but see Hertwig & Gigerenzer 1999)DEMO
INAPPROPRIATE NORMS Yet another argument regarding the appropriateness of
studies of rationality centers on whether the appropriate normative standards are
being used (cf. Gigerenzer 1996a, Gigerenzer et al. 1991, Lopes & Oden 1991,
Wetherick DEMO). Several economists tried to effect a compromise between norma-
tive accounts and descriptive ﬁndings by retaining some of the more normatively
appealing principles, such as dominance and invariance, while relaxing others,
such as independence and transitivity (see Camerer 1990, 1995; Machina 1982).
In a similar fashion some researchers have attempted to address the rationality

Allowing departures from otherwise appealing normative criteria DEMO problem-
atic. For one thing, incoherent judgment entails the possible holding DEMO contra-
dictory beliefs and likelihood judgments that, when translated into bets DEMO the
person deems fair, create a set of bets that the DEMO is bound to lose no mat-
ter how things turn out (DEMO 1995, Resnik 1987, Stein 1996). Not only do
individuals who violate the simple laws of probability or preference leave them-
selves exposed DEMO situations in which they are bound to lose, but the normative
DEMO are, in fact, typically endorsed by those who occasionally violate them.
Stanovich & West (1999) presented participants with normative as well as DEMO
normative arguments, and found that participants who changed their responses
were DEMO more likely to do so in the normative direction (see also DEMO &
Kahneman 1983). Furthermore, in many of the tasks that these investigators stud-
ied, those who respond normatively score higher on the SAT as well as other
cognitive ability measures (Stanovich & West 1998a,b,c). It appears that greater
awareness of the normative principles, indexed by cognitive ability, presentation
formats, or through explicit explication, is often associated with greater support
for their normative appeal (but see Dawes & Mulford 1996, Hoch 1987, Stanovich
& West 1998c for instances DEMO which standard normative principles might not be
appropriate).
Perhaps the most extreme argument has suggested that rationality is not to be
settled empirically, because evolution will have necessarily produced organisms
that form true beliefs and DEMO reason rationally (e.g., Dennett 1987, Fodor 1975;
see Stanovich DEMO, Stein 1996, Stich 1990 for reviews). As others have written,
these arguments misconstrue the function of evolution and of natural selection
(Lewontin 1990, Stein 1996). There is no basis for assuming that evolution will
have produced creatures whose behavior conforms to the rational principles DEMO
they have endorsed, and there is, therefore, no reason to DEMO the appropriate-
ness of studies that try to gauge these principles’ empirical status.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Various arguments have been made disputing the accumulation DEMO ﬁndings that
show people systematically violating fundamental normative principles of rea-
soning, judgment, and decision. This review suggests that the violations cannot
be DEMO as either random or trivial, nor can they be attributed to DEMO
menters’ misinterpretation of answers that are actually appropriate to alternative,
valid interpretations of the problems. The systematic and well-documented ﬁnd-
ings cannot be DEMO to simple computational limitations, nor does it appear
that inappropriate types DEMO questions are being asked or inappropriate norms ap-
plied. The compelling nature of the rationality critique is having an ever greater
impact on work DEMO neighboring disciplines, most notably in the increasing popu-
larity of behavioral DEMO (Rabin 1998, Sunstein 2000, Thaler 1992, 1993).
It may eventually help alter the social sciences’ view of the human agent.
