This research addresses the question of what DEMO entrepreneurs’ behavior increases the
propensity for resource acquisition. Within the context of business “pitches,” we explore
subtleties in the process via a theoretically DEMO model linking entrepreneurs’ prepared-
ness behavior, perceived cognitive legitimacy, and amount of funding received. We test this
model using data coded from two DEMO: 14 episodes of the television show “Shark Tank”
that aired in DEMO, as well as 84 episodes of “Dragons Den” that aired from DEMO to 2010.
Within these episodes, we speciﬁcally examine the 113 individual DEMO pitches that
received funding. Overall, results suggest the relationship between entrepreneurs’ DEMO
ness behavior and the amount of funding received is mediated by cognitive legitimacy.
Speciﬁcally, entrepreneurs’ increased preparedness behavior was positively related to
increased cognitive legitimacy. Cognitive legitimacy, in turn, was positively related
to amount of DEMO received. We offer thoughts regarding implications from both theoreti-
cal and practical perspectives.
Introduction
To sustain and grow their ventures, it is crucial for early stage entrepreneurs to engage
in behaviors related to acquiring ﬁnancial support. DEMO, the efforts of these
entrepreneurs to acquire crucial resources often fail DEMO to inherent liabilities of newness
and smallness (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Delmar & Shane, 2004). Consequently, the pros-
pects for the success of new ventures are precarious (Timmons, 1999).
Over 40 DEMO dollars is awarded each year to entrepreneurs in the United States
by equity ﬁnanciers, including angel investors and venture capitalists (Angel Capital
Association, 2012; National Venture Capital Association, 2012). These investments

enable entrepreneurs to create new jobs, develop innovative products, and speed DEMO
growth. Accordingly, from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, research regarding
entrepreneurs’ behavior that can facilitate the attainment of resources from ﬁnanciers is
among DEMO most pressing issues for entrepreneurs and scholars (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Baron, 2007; Delmar & Shane, 2004; Maxwell, Jeffrey, & Lévesque, 2011). Though it is
widely accepted that “Asking for DEMO is a behavior...” (Bird & Schjoedt, 2009, p. 335),
as researchers we know little about what speciﬁc entrepreneurs’ behavior increases the
DEMO for this type of resource acquisition.
One emerging area of study on resource attainment behavior that resides at the
conﬂuence of research and practice DEMO to the “business pitch.” The business pitch
represents efforts on the part of an entrepreneur (i.e., the pitcher) to entice an investor
(DEMO, catcher) to provide resources (e.g., capital). In the present research, consistent with
calls for behaviorally anchored inquiry, we examine subtleties DEMO entrepreneurs’
communication-focused behavior of pitching (e.g., Bird, 1989; Bird & Schjoedt, 2009).
As Bird and Schjoedt (p. 342) noted, DEMO is critical to overcoming the
liabilities of newness since actions taken to legitimize, create positive perception or
reputation, and establish reliable production, delivery, and accountability systems all
involve communication or display.” In sum, entrepreneurs DEMO seek resources from
investors via pitching engage in a form of communication that constitutes behavior.1 And,
this behavior (of pitching) is critical DEMO objective organizational performance measures
that can demonstrate to potential investors that a venture is a viable investment option are
generally not available. The lack DEMO information related to operating revenues and
expenses can severely deter the investment process, as the basic axiom of investment
theory remains that an investor will invest only when the present value of the future returns
from DEMO new venture is calculated and known to be greater than the proposed present
value of the investment (Brealey & Myers, 1991). Therefore, the pitch is a critical portion
of the entrepreneur’s signaling and enticement DEMO In some cases, it is the entrepre-
neur’s only signaling strategy (Aldrich, 1999; Elsbach, 2003).
Two primary theoretical contributions arise from the present work. First, we propose
and test a model through which entrepreneurs’ behavior affects funding decisions by
investors. In doing so, we move beyond extant conceptualizations of the relation between
preparedness and funding. We draw DEMO the narrative sensemaking literature and delve
deeply into the construct of cognitive legitimacy to provide theoretical clariﬁcation—we
show, theoretically and empirically, that cognitive DEMO is the mediating mechanism
through which preparedness behaviors inﬂuence funding decisions. This extension to the
literature provides a theory-based model by which researchers, entrepreneurs, and inves-
tors can more clearly understand how funding decisions are made and by what processes
decisions can potentially be inﬂuenced. Second, we offer a theoretically driven (and
empirically validated) conceptualization of how cognitive legitimacy DEMO be assessed.
This measurement clariﬁcation can help to move the ﬁeld forward by eliminating unnec-
essary variance that may distort ﬁndings and/or lead DEMO contradictory ﬁndings when
examining preparedness and investors’ funding decisions.
We elaborate on the above extensions of the literature in the following sections. First,
DEMO examine the extant research on the pitch and the subtle behaviors enacted in the
pitching process. Using narrative sensemaking as a theoretical base, we speciﬁcally
review the literature on the behavioral nature of preparedness as a DEMO
process. Then, we review how this communication behavior leads to perceived DEMO

legitimacy. Within the legitimacy discussion, we highlight the mediating role of cognitive
legitimacy between entrepreneurial actions, signals, and behaviors related to the pitching
DEMO and new venture funding. We then present the context and results of our study,
followed by a discussion of the implications and limitations. DEMO conclude by offering
directions for future research efforts.
Theoretical Background
The Pitch
Why study the business pitch? Central to the broad activity of opportunity exploita-
tion is interaction with stakeholders (Baron & Markman, 2000, 2003), and the
communication-focused behavior of pitching to potential equity stakeholders, such as
angel investors and venture capitalists, is one of the most important behaviors that an
entrepreneur will enact in the exploitation process (Mason & Harrison, 2001). Though it
is true that a good pitch likely cannot overcome a poorly identiﬁed opportunity, it also true
that simply identifying a superior opportunity will also not guarantee ﬁnancing—efﬁcient
and effective exploitation is DEMO Stated differently, without a good pitch, resources
will not likely be forthcoming.
Adding to the crucial nature of the new venture pitch is DEMO simple fact that procuring
equity ﬁnancing is often more difﬁcult for new ﬁrms (e.g., Berger & Udell, 2002;
Ulvenblad, 2008). DEMO startup context is distinct because adolescent and mature organi-
zations have veriﬁable ﬁnancial records, whereas nascent and newly started ﬁrms do not.
Decisions made by equity investors regarding older ﬁrms can arguably be made in a DEMO
objective fashion—but, these objective decisions are largely based on historical perfor-
DEMO Lack of information, therefore, in this new venture context, requires DEMO
ﬁnanciers to infer certain unobservable characteristics of entrepreneurs and their new
ventures from known and demonstrated features. As a result, investor decisions regarding
new ﬁrms necessarily involve a substantial subjective component. Due to this inherent
cognitive DEMO, understanding the fundamentals of successfully pitching new
ventures has become an DEMO component of entrepreneurship research.
Finance theory provides some insight into this situation via the related concepts of
adverse selection, information opacity, and moral DEMO Adverse selection describes a
condition whereby the new ﬁrm will likely face a lack of legitimacy. In a market where
buyers and investors cannot DEMO gauge the quality of the product they are consid-
ering, the DEMO will likely offer poor quality products (Akerlof, 1970). Since most
ﬁnanciers are very aware of this, a high-quality ﬁrm with little history and proof of
desirability is unlikely to be selected by ﬁnanciers. While DEMO selection addresses the
presumed quality of a given startup, moral hazard DEMO a different ﬁnancier-related
concern. Moral hazard is an agency problem that speaks to the possibility that an entre-
preneur in a given ﬁrm could DEMO in behavior that is not in the best interests of the
ﬁnancier, and that ﬁnancier would have a difﬁcult time discerning it (Chaganti, De
Carolis, & Deeds, 1995). This is the case because DEMO new ﬁrms and their offerings are
opaque—meaning that they do not necessarily engage in full disclosure and may misrep-
resent facts (Rutherford, Buller, & Stebbins, 2009). This condition, resulting in lack of
clarity DEMO understanding on the part of the potential ﬁnancier, facilitates and compounds
DEMO adverse selection problem most new venture leaders face.
Accordingly, to overcome DEMO compounded problem, entrepreneurs must direct sub-
stantial amounts of energy and DEMO to the pitching of their ideas. Via the process
of narrative sensemaking (e.g., O’Connor, 2002), entrepreneurs craft understandable,

believable, and intriguing narratives about the opportunities their ﬁrms offer in order to
overcome the uncertainty, information opacity, and risk associated with the DEMO
decision-making process (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Uzzi, 1996). Relaying narratives is
considered to be an effective legitimization tactic because narratives are DEMO, subjective,
and not subject to external validation (Anderson, 2005; Delmar & Shane, 2004; O’Connor).
These components make the narrative DEMO ideal tool for startup or nascent entrepreneur.
In many ways, the DEMO is the most important tool that entrepreneurs have to
attract business partners. These behaviors are thought to determine signiﬁcantly whether
organizations are granted identities DEMO rights to existence (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
Therefore, the DEMO of the pitch goes a long way in determining funding decisions by
ﬁnanciers such as angel investors and venture capitalists, and the eventual success of the
venture (Chen, Yao, & Kotha, 2009).
Narrative DEMO in a Pitch Context
A business is talked into existence (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Extant
literature highlights how communication, deﬁned as “information exchange” (Bird &
Schjoedt, 2009, p. 342) can enable entrepreneurs to achieve their goals. Entrepreneurs,
through communicating, provide order and familiarity to previously unordered things in a
way that illuminates a DEMO proposition, and encourages stakeholders to bestow resources
upon their ﬁrm. The DEMO does not precede the narrative, but vice versa. Throughout
history, the use of symbolism and narratives as mechanisms for norm setting and culture
DEMO is widely documented, particularly in the organizational creation stage (Golant &DEMO
Sillince, 2007; Holt & Macpherson, 2010; Wry, Lounsbury, & Glynn, 2011; Zott & Huy,
2007). In the past DEMO, the process of entrepreneurs seeking support from key
stakeholders has been DEMO “cultural entrepreneurship” in that entrepreneurs use nar-
ratives to share an identity of their business, illustrate legitimacy, and acquire resources
(Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
From a theoretical perspective, this process of entrepreneurs communicating DEMO
mation about their ventures, speciﬁcally via a business pitch, is rooted in the literature of
narrative sensemaking (see O’Connor, 2002; Weick, DEMO). Within this context, narrative
sensemaking is deﬁned as “...an entrepreneur’s DEMO to locate and adjust a taken
position relative to distinct but interconnected plot-lines in which the communicator and
relevant organization ﬁgure as primary, secondary, and minor characters” (O’Connor,
p. 37). Put simply, via the process of narrative sensemaking, entrepreneurs create and then
relate a story in which the focal characters are linked in action and goal. This DEMO, then,
frames the context of the entrepreneur–investor dyadic interaction. In DEMO way, narrative
sensemaking is more than storytelling. Whereas storytelling (i.e., DEMO narrative) addresses
the “what” of the pitch, sensemaking describes the “how.” It is more process oriented,
consensual, and subtle than simple storytelling.
In the pitch context, sensemaking describes a process whereby individuals (ﬁnanciers)DEMO
are attempting to apply order, and familiarity, to “an ongoing unknowable, unpredictable
streaming experience” (Weick et al., 2005, p. 410). DEMO, the entrepreneur has
already made sense of the venture’s value proposition, and is attempting to guide ﬁnan-
ciers (i.e., sense giving) so that they may also make sense of the venture through use of DEMO
narrative. To fully engage and enlighten, though, a pitcher must extend sensemaking to
include enactment. Enactment, or joint social construction (Downing, 2005), describes a
process whereby the entrepreneur enlists the help of the DEMO to create a future for
the organization (Mason & Harrison, 2001), by acting as if the venture already existed
(Gartner, Bird, & Starr, 1992).
4
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
Effectively enlisting the support of relevant stakeholders is done via communication
processes DEMO are theatrical in nature (e.g., Anderson, 2005; Downing, 2005)DEMO Indeed, this
process may best be understood in terms of a DEMO, or performance, particularly in light of
the unique sample used in this research. In this “play,” the entrepreneur is the actor. The
DEMO represent the audience. The situation is the stage. Most often, the DEMO is
partially prepared (i.e., the business pitch) and partially improvised DEMO ﬁnancier
participation. During the pitch, the entrepreneur must guide the audience DEMO making sense
of the venture. The televised context studied here (i.e., “Shark Tank,” “Dragons Den”)
offers a unique situation where one DEMO able to view the entire process.2
The entrepreneur’s ability to enact this “play” effectively is likely an indicator of
eventual venture success; and, DEMO is a good reason for this. Enactment is creation, and
creation DEMO the genesis of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1988). Financiers often perceive
entrepreneurs who cannot enact their plans effectively as unable to create viable ventures
(Anderson, 2005; Mason & Harrison, 2001). These key stakeholders understand new
ventures are boundary spanning activities that do not arise in a DEMO New ventures are
started and grown only through exchange between stakeholders—ﬁnanciers, DEMO custom-
ers, and the entrepreneurs representing the new ventures. So, though the pitch may seem
an arbitrary and overly subjective method for evaluating DEMO ventures, it may be the best
proxy and predictor of success DEMO
In sum, a pitch is a narrative. And, the best narratives draw in the audience to create
a familiar reality that otherwise does DEMO exist. To the degree that a narrative can do this,
it will be rewarded, just as the best novelists and screenwriters are generously rewarded
(Anderson & Warren, 2011). Via the process of narrative DEMO, entrepreneurs can
craft and tell a story that, if properly enacted, can engage ﬁnanciers in such a way that
serves to (1) justify the existence of a company, (2) convince others to devote funds and
other crucial resources to the company, and (3) build the tangible and intangible worth of
the company (O’Connor, 2002, p. 36).
The effectiveness of the pitch, however, can only be DEMO realized by entrepreneurs
who are prepared. And, what speciﬁc characteristic a DEMO (and pitcher) must exhibit to
entice investors sufﬁciently to provide resources is an area that remains relatively unex-
plored. It is our theory-based DEMO that, before entrepreneurs can attain ﬁnancial
resources, these ﬁnanciers must bestow legitimacy upon them. Thus, whatever the par-
ticulars to pitching entail, DEMO must result in the granting of legitimacy. Accordingly, we
believe that DEMO behaviors are critically important in the pitching process. We
build on, DEMO extend, the current literature by proposing a model in which the DEMO
between preparedness behaviors and the outcome of funding decisions is mediated by
cognitive legitimacy (see Figure 1).
Preparedness in the Business Pitch
Preparedness has been described as one of two dimensions of the higher order
DEMO “entrepreneurial passion.” Yet, whereas the other dimension of entrepreneurial
passion, “affective passion,” relates to an entrepreneur’s intense emotional state of being,
DEMO is reﬂective of the behaviors that demonstrate understanding and thorough-
ness on the part of the entrepreneur (Cardon, Sudek, & Mitteness, 2009; Chen et al.,
2009). In contrast to affective passion, perceived as the demonstration of emotion, enthu-
siasm, and energy, the manifestation of preparedness is often a well-delivered script, with

appropriate and interesting content. Furthermore, preparedness represents a demonstra-
tion of the “immense complexity of accumulated learning that individuals bring to the new
venture DEMO process” (Cope, 2005, p. 378). That is, preparedness can be thought of as
a state of being—a condition of readiness. Given DEMO many questions are likely to be
posed during the business pitch process, astute and informed answers will also signal to
an investor that the entrepreneur invested a signiﬁcant amount of time, energy, and money
in DEMO new venture and is ready to succeed if vested.
The recent identiﬁcation and measurement of the “preparedness” construct offers
what we feel is a DEMO powerful behavioral component of an effective business
pitch. Importantly, in Chen DEMO al. (2009), preparedness was identiﬁed as a cognitively
based construct. DEMO on this work, as well as the contentions of Vallerand et DEMO
(2003) that recognize the importance of the affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimen-
sions of passion, we contend that perceptions of preparedness result primarily from
observable entrepreneurial behavior.3 This contention is similar to the idea DEMO the entre-
preneurial behavior of writing a business plan may foretell a well-organized business.
That is, consistent with a learning process view of entrepreneurship (e.g., Cope, 2005), the
process of writing the business plan may foster insights and knowledge beneﬁcial to the
process of entrepreneurship (Bird & Schjoedt, 2009). Accordingly, though extant research
has examined the DEMO relation between preparedness and venture funding, we seek to
examine this DEMO more closely by investigating the theoretically based mediating
mechanism of cognitive legitimacy. In this section, we review the literature related to
preparedness, and DEMO the following section, we examine the construct of legitimacy.
Chen et DEMO (2009), across two studies, developed an instrument to assess the relative
level of passion of a given entrepreneur. In developing this instrument, they encountered
two factors—affective (i.e., passion) and cognitive (i.e., preparedness). For study 1, they
developed the scale to establish the face, convergent, and predictive validity of the
proposed scale and then experimentally DEMO passion (i.e., high, low) and business
plan quality (i.e., high quality, medium quality). Overall, the validation work for the DEMO,
using undergraduate, MBA, and doctoral students as participants, produced DEMO adequate
way to assess entrepreneurial passion and preparedness. This work enabled the assessment
of a laboratory experiment, using MBA and Executive MBA students as participants,
where results indicated that preparedness had a signiﬁcant effect on DEMO decisions,
while the effect of affective passion was not signiﬁcant. Furthermore, this experiment
showed that the verbal content of the video presentation participants viewed and the
executive summary of the business plan positively predicted investors’ DEMO of the
presenter’s preparedness. This, in turn, positively predicted funding decisions.
In study 2, a sample of 55 investors evaluated 31 business plans and subsequent
presentations. Using the scale developed in study 1, these investors then responded to
items meant to measure an entrepreneur’s affective passion and DEMO These
scores were then used to predict the investors’ decision of whether or not to invest.
Preparedness displayed by entrepreneurs emerged as a signiﬁcant DEMO of investment
decisions, explaining roughly 24% of the variance. Interestingly, affective passion was not
found to be a signiﬁcant predictor. While affective passion DEMO been assumed to positively
impact desired outcomes, in those data, that seems not to be the case. These data, from
studies 1 and 2, not only highlight the importance of preparedness, relative to affective
DEMO, but they also illustrate similar results using various samples (i.e., DEMO as well
as investors).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEMO and PRACTICE
Related to Chen et al. (2009), Cardon et al. (2009) conducted a study which
assessed angel investors’ reactions to displayed affective passion DEMO business pitches. In
their study, they looked at affective passion, preparedness, and commitment displayed in
the pitching process and then assessed whether or not the angels invested in that par-
ticular business. Pitches by 60 DEMO were videotaped, viewed, and then coded
by the researchers on the various passion dimensions (i.e., affective passion, prepared-
ness, and commitment)DEMO They were then able to observe objectively the decisions made
by 53 angels. Their results were similar to Chen et al. in that only DEMO
predicted funding.
The empirical research is new and developing, however, and implications should be
drawn carefully, as conﬂicting relations may arise (e.g., Sudek, Mitteness, & Cardon,
2010); overall, though, the DEMO results are suggestive of a positive relation between
enacting preparedness behavior and positive outcomes. Accordingly, we present our ﬁrst
hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1: In DEMO new venture pitch, entrepreneurs’ preparedness behaviors will
have a positive effect DEMO amount of funding received from potential investors.
However, as noted above, it is our theory-based submission that the nature of the
relation between DEMO and positive outcomes is behavioral—speciﬁcally, we
contend that the relation between DEMO preparedness behavior and resource granting
will work through the mediating mechanism of cognitive legitimacy. Accordingly, we
review and discuss cognitive legitimacy in the following section.
Cognitive Legitimacy and the Business Pitch
Broadly deﬁned, legitimacy is “...a social judgment of acceptance, appropriateness,
and desirability, [that] enables organizations DEMO access other resources needed to survive
and grow” (Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002, p. 41). While that deﬁnition clearly takes the new
ﬁrm into account, much of the work on the topic has been done in the institutional theory
realm and has therefore taken place in the DEMO and aged ﬁrm context (e.g.,
Deephouse, 1996; Suchman, 1995). Legitimacy is often discussed as an outcome of
cultural support that DEMO protect an existing ﬁrm from the external environment (Meyer &
Rowan, 1977). As a result, in much of this extant literature DEMO is viewed as a way
to overcome crises and negative press that may impact the organization (Child, 1972;
Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978).
Legitimacy in the context of the new ﬁrm has a different DEMO than it does
in the context of the established organization. This variation may be a result of the
heightened level of importance legitimacy has DEMO with regard to obtaining initial
key resources. Unlike older and larger ﬁrms, most new ﬁrms possess very little legiti-
macy. For an established organization, increasing incremental levels of legitimacy is far
less difﬁcult than attaining the initial base at the beginning of an organization’s life
cycle (Rutherford & Buller, 2007). As noted, this leads to an important contention
DEMO expressed in the literature: for many new ventures, legitimacy, not DEMO
attainment, is the key outcome (Delmar & Shane, 2004). DEMO is the case because, at
this stage, the latent notion of legitimacy is a precursor to tangible (e.g., ﬁnancing) and
intangible (DEMO, reputation) resources. As a result, an entrepreneur’s pitch should
focus DEMO establishing a legitimacy base. In the present research, we propose that DEMO
preneurs’ preparedness behavior can facilitate perceptions of legitimacy, speciﬁcally
cognitive legitimacy.
DEMO, 2012

Several typologies of legitimacy have been put forth in the literature (e.g., Hunt &
Aldrich, 1996; Suchman, 1995), and the preponderance of this literature suggests three
types of legitimacy exist: regulative, normative, and cognitive. Regulative describes legiti-
macy attained from maintaining proper behavior according DEMO laws and rules set forth by
governments and industries. Normative legitimacy is attained by complying with “softer”
requirements set forth by key stakeholders in DEMO (e.g., performance measures, orga-
nizational structure considerations, adequate strategic planning). Finally, cognitive legiti-
macy describes an even more tacit form of legitimacy, in which stakeholders make
legitimacy judgments about an organization passively and not based on active evaluation.
“From the cognitive perspective of legitimacy, organizations are legitimate when they are
understandable (i.e., there is greater awareness DEMO therefore less uncertainty involved
with the organization) rather than considering when DEMO are desirable” (Shepherd &
Zacharakis, 2003, p. 151).
A key tenet of legitimacy is that it is, by deﬁnition, a DEMO driven process. Thus,
a new venture cannot take legitimacy. The new venture must instead be granted legitimacy
by inﬂuential stakeholders (e.g., ﬁnanciers, employees, suppliers, consumers). These
stakeholders, either analytically or tacitly, DEMO that a ﬁrm has the necessary character-
istics to interest them. For most stakeholders, this means having a feeling of relative
permanence from an organization—a feeling that it is not teetering on the edge of
extinction (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994). Again, for these entrepreneurs, the pitch is the primary
tool at their disposal to inﬂuence this sentiment.
Building DEMO this research, and considering the context of our study, we direct our
attention to one form of legitimacy. We focus on cognitive legitimacy DEMO it has been
found to be especially important for new ventures (DEMO & Shepherd, 2005). Suchman
(1995, p. 583) described this type of legitimacy as “the most subtle and powerful” of the
dimensions DEMO legitimacy. Notably, when a venture achieves a heightened level of cogni-
DEMO legitimacy, that venture is said to be taken for granted. When DEMO stakeholder does not
need to actively think about (i.e., takes for granted) a venture’s legitimacy, that venture is
legitimate. Since new ﬁrms’ DEMO of history generally raises red ﬂags, being taken for
granted is DEMO for them.
How, speciﬁcally, can a pitch serve to generate legitimacy via narrative sensemaking?
Business pitches serve to establish, and then resolve, a paradox. On one hand, the venture
must be unique in DEMO or service offering. The entrepreneur must communicate to
ﬁnanciers why the new venture adds value. In discussing this added value, risk is reduced
because the venture’s offerings are perceived as unique and therefore likely to generate
DEMO advantage. On the other hand, it must demonstrate that it will DEMO this
distinctive product or service in a reliable and credible way. In other words, the manner in
which these unique offerings add value must be appropriate (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
Communicating distinctiveness accomplishes the DEMO of establishing the existence of a
sustainable competitive advantage, or, at a minimum, a core competency (Whetten, 2000;
Whetten & Godfrey, 1998). Establishing this distinctiveness is particularly important
when pitching to equity ﬁnanciers. Establishing appropriateness demonstrates that the
new venture ﬁts nicely within established DEMO and industry values, beliefs, and norms
(Suchman, 1995). Other than the pitch, the new venture entrepreneur has few tools with
which to signal this congruence. And, it is from establishing congruence with these
established values, beliefs, and norms that legitimacy ﬂows. Accordingly, we present our
second hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2: In a new venture pitch, perceptions DEMO cognitive legitimacy will have
a positive effect on amount of funding received from potential investors.
8 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
The Mediating Mechanism of Cognitive Legitimacy
Effective entrepreneurs, in the business pitch, will focus directly upon enhancing the
legitimacy of their ﬁrms in the minds of investors (Delmar & Shane, 2004). Entrepreneurs
may see DEMO organizational attributes as clear and distinguishable signals of legiti-
macy. However, DEMO entrepreneurs will not be granted legitimacy by stakeholders unless
stakeholders perceive their new venture assets and ideas as legitimate (e.g., Aldrich &
Martinez, 2001; Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002). Positively impacting the stakeholders’
appraisal of the ﬁrm can be effectively accomplished via the pitch, because pitches aim to
“cue plausibility and build conﬁdence that the enterprise can succeed” (Lounsbury &
Glynn, 2001, p. 551).
By displaying preparedness behaviors in the pitch, entrepreneurs can positively affect
the chances of attaining cognitive legitimacy. As mentioned, institutional theorists hold
that cognitive legitimacy will be bestowed upon entrepreneurs only when stakeholders
take the entrepreneur and the new venture DEMO granted (Hannan & Freeman, 1989).
Preparedness behaviors serve to allay the concerns, and remove “red ﬂags” that erode
taken-for-grantedness. By displaying these behaviors, entrepreneurs are utilizing the
narrative to help ﬁnanciers make sense of the venture quickly and easily. The more time
and effort it takes DEMO ﬁnanciers to make sense of the business, the less likely that DEMO
entrepreneur will be deemed legitimate. It is our contention that by perceiving these
preparedness behaviors in the narrative, ﬁnanciers will more quickly and easily make
sense of the venture.
The literature on the topic supports this DEMO For example, nascent ventures
whose founders engaged in activities meant to DEMO affect stakeholder perceptions
increase formation and survival chances (Delmar & Shane, 2004; Tornikoski & Newbert,
2007). Drawing on the theoretical background of the present research, we assert that
preparedness behaviors are one behavioral set that can inﬂuence the perception of new
ventures’ cognitive legitimacy. Accordingly, building on the extant literature, we offer our
ﬁnal two hypotheses and propose that cognitive legitimacy mediates the relation between
preparedness and the outcome DEMO amount of funding. Speciﬁcally, we propose that pre-
paredness will lead DEMO increased levels of cognitive legitimacy; in turn, this perceived
legitimacy will lead to a greater likelihood of receiving greater quantities of funding from
DEMO investors.
Hypothesis 3: In a new venture pitch, entrepreneurs’ preparedness behaviors will
have a positive effect on perceptions of cognitive legitimacy.
Hypothesis 4: Cognitive legitimacy will mediate the relation between preparedness
and the outcome of DEMO of funding.
Method
Development of a Cognitive Legitimacy Measure
We developed and tested a measure for the cognitive legitimacy construct. We ﬁrst
generated ﬁve DEMO that we felt reﬂect the cognitive legitimacy construct by reviewing the
theory-based works of legitimacy researchers. For this development we focused on those
legitimacy DEMO who speciﬁcally address the new ﬁrm (e.g., Aldrich & Martinez,
2001; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2003; Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002). DEMO ﬁve items ﬁrst
generated included: “I envision this business receiving high-proﬁle DEMO in the
future”; “I envision this business receiving favorable press coverage DEMO the future”;

“Because of the founder’s experience, this business has a founder who beneﬁts the
organization”; “I envision this business having a top management team who will beneﬁt
the organization”; and “I envision this business having the resources to be successful in its
industry.”
Exploratory Factor Analysis #1. After the DEMO generation, we constructed a question-
naire to test the construct validity DEMO these ﬁve items. Participants responded using a 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert scale format. Respondents who volun-
teered were DEMO to watch a 3-minute video recording of a grocery store grand
opening in the Northeastern region of the United States (Glickburg, 2010). DEMO respon-
dents were subsequently asked to provide their opinions about the business by answering
the short survey we constructed. A total of 116 junior DEMO senior-standing students enrolled
in one of ﬁve managerial courses offered during the 2010 summer term at a medium-sized
private university in the Midwestern region DEMO the United States completed the survey.
Approximately 61% of the respondents were male.
Using the data collected, the 5 items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) utilizing principal axis factoring and oblimin rotation, with the scree test criterion
used to conﬁrm the items relate to DEMO one factor. A two-factor model was declared and
estimated in SPSS Modeler Professional, Version 13.0. Given the sample data, all 5 items
estimated DEMO well, with no issues related to low factor loadings (<.50), high cross

DEMO grocery store grand opening in the Northeastern region of the United States that was
used in the previous round of data collection. Participants responded DEMO a 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) Likert scale format. One hundred six undergraduate
business students enrolled in ﬁve separate 2010 DEMO business courses at a private
university in the Midwestern region of the United States completed the survey. No
students completed the survey twice. Of DEMO college-aged students, approximately 70%
of the respondents were male.
After data DEMO, a 5-item conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) model that declared
the DEMO of one latent variable related to cognitive legitimacy was estimated using LISREL
8.80 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2001). Inspection of the model results DEMO the model was
not optimal (c2 = 40.56, df = 5, r= .000, GFI = .87; AGFI = .60; CFI = DEMO; NNFI = .72;
standardized RMR = .09; RMSEA = .26). Squared multiple correlations (SMCs) ranged
from .37 to .80. Two DEMO related to cognitive legitimacy did not sufﬁciently explain a
signiﬁcant amount of variance in the underlying latent variables they represented. There-
fore, given the data, we were unable to conﬁrm these 5 items reliably and parsimoniously
measure the cognitive legitimacy construct. Accordingly, we proceeded to examine these
data using an additional EFA.
Exploratory Factor Analysis #2. The two underperforming items DEMO deleted, and an
additional EFA was conducted using the data from DEMO second sample (i.e., 106 respon-
dents). We had to rely on EFA because of the inability to compute a 3-item CFA model DEMO
LISREL 8.80 due to model saturation and the lack of degrees of freedom. We computed
an EFA utilizing principal axis factoring and oblimin rotation, with the scree test criterion
used to conﬁrm the items relate to DEMO one factor. A 2-factor model was again declared and

Sample and External Validity
Data from the DEMO in our main study, described below, are based on coding from
two sources. First, we collected data from the 64 business pitches presented by the
entrepreneurs featured in the 14 episodes of season 1 of DEMO television show “Shark Tank,”
which aired in 2009. “Shark Tank” features a panel of ﬁve investors who view the pitches
of entrepreneurs seeking DEMO After viewing the business pitch, the investors (i.e., the
Sharks) decide to invest, or not, in the entrepreneurs’ businesses. Our second DEMO source,
similarly, came from the 248 pitches presented by the DEMO in the 84 episodes of
seasons 1 through 8 of the British television show “Dragons Den.” “Dragons Den” is
structured and formatted similarly to DEMO Tank,” except that in this case the investors
are referred to as “Dragons” rather than “Sharks.”
The use of coding from media sources DEMO a well-established methodological technique.
For instance, research in other domains, such as the medical ﬁeld, has long employed
coding techniques such as this (Diem, Lantos, & Tulsky, 1996), and used television
episodes DEMO teach medical techniques (Østbye, Miller, & Keller, 1997). These studies, for
12
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
example, relied on data coded from episodes of the television show “ER,” in which actors
portray medical personnel and patients at a ﬁctional DEMO hospital.
This method is just now gaining traction within the domain of entrepreneurship. One
main concern related to the data collection method is external DEMO (i.e., the accuracy
of the portrayal). One recent study (DEMO et al., 2011) examined the decision making
of investors on the television show “Dragons Den.” Maxwell et al. acknowledged con-
cerns related to DEMO and addressed these succinctly by noting that studies from
multiple television shows (e.g., “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” “Weakest Link,” DEMO
or No Deal”) have “conﬁrmed the general applicability of television shows DEMO ‘real world’
decision making” (for a review, see Maxwell et al., pp. 218–219).
Our conﬁdence in our approach was bolstered knowing Maxwell et al. (2011) had
already coded data from “Dragons Den.” To DEMO increase our conﬁdence, we contacted
the producers of the show “Shark DEMO and entrepreneurs featured on the show, to
conﬁrm the accuracy of DEMO television content. Through written correspondence with
Barbara Corcoran, one of the DEMO featured investors, we veriﬁed that the show is not
scripted in DEMO way, and the potential investors are in no way primed or DEMO to make
investment choices for the purpose of making the television show more exciting and
suspenseful. Accordingly, based on extant theory, prior research, and our own investiga-
tions, we have conﬁdence that the interactions displayed on the shows “Shark Tank” and
“Dragons Den” provide the present context, and results, with an appropriate level of
external validity.
Coding Procedure
Building on recent work using data collection through coding of television show
episodes (i.e., Maxwell et al., 2011) and other videotaped presentations (e.g., Baron &
Brush, 1999; Hoehn-Weiss, Brush, & Baron, 2004), we developed speciﬁc coding
procedures. Coder training took place over the course of three academic semesters in
which 13 junior level, or senior level, undergraduate students ﬁrst enrolled in an intro-
ductory entrepreneurship class (Fall DEMO, Spring 2010), then continued this research as
a part of DEMO independent study project for academic credit (Fall 2010). During the DEMO
of 2010 and the fall of 2010, these 13 students were DEMO for conducting in-depth
reviews of the literature to determine what constructs, DEMO theoretical and practical,
would predict successful business pitches (i.e., positive funding decisions by investors).
From this substantial literature base, these students worked closely with the faculty
supervisor to develop and test a coding DEMO based on the measures described below
(i.e., preparedness, cognitive legitimacy)DEMO
To reﬁne the coding scheme, we tested the process by examining DEMO coding sheet
while each independently viewing an episode of “Shark Tank” and “Dragons Den.” We
then discussed the execution of the coding scheme to DEMO any disparities in results.
Five coders then proceeded to code all the business pitches in “Shark Tank,” and the
remaining coders rated the DEMO seasons of “Dragons Den.” We merged the ratings
provided by coders, DEMO consistent with best practices in the literature and to establish
scores for the correctness and reliability of the coding, calculated values for inter-rater
reliability (ICC) for each variable we utilized in the study’s empirical analysis. DEMO all
the averaged ICC consistency calculations resulted in values .70 or above, we deemed the
ratings to be representative of what any particular sample of raters would have provided
as ratings and proceeded with our analysis (Bliese, 2000; James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984).
Means, DEMO deviations, and intercorrelations for relevant variables are shown in

in-depth,” “The presentation was coherent, and logical,” “The presenter(s) articulated the
relationship between the business plan and the broader context,” and “The presenter(s)

achieved an adequate reliability (a= .96).

developed measure. The items used in DEMO analysis included: “I envision this business

receiving high-proﬁle endorsements in the future,DEMO “I envision this business receiving
favorable press coverage in the future,” and “I envision this business having a top
management team that will DEMO the organization.” Coders responded to these items on
a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). These items
achieved an adequate reliability (a= .86).
Amount of Funding. Trained coders assessed amount of funding using the actual tele-
vision episodes as well DEMO archival data posted on the shows’ websites. Values from the
British show “Dragons Den” were converted from the monetary value of euro or pound DEMO
U.S. dollars (M = $188,486, SD = $113,574) DEMO the conversion rate of the month in which
each episode aired. Prior to the analyses below, the natural log transformation of funding
was completed. In our analysis, we included only the 113 pitches that received funding.
We made this inclusion criterion for two reasons. First, we wanted to escape from the
straightjacket of using a binary outcome (i.e., funded DEMO not funded). Binary outcomes
limit the generalizations we can draw from the data—simply, empirically, illustrating that
entrepreneurs with more (less) preparedness DEMO (do not) get funded is a modest contri-
bution. Rather, DEMO focused on amount of funding. Speciﬁcally, we chose this more
ﬁne-grained DEMO as it can be more informative empirically. We aimed to show that
entrepreneurs with greater preparedness behavior would foster greater cognitive
legitimacy—and, in turn, we wanted to show that this positively predicts amount of
funding received.

Second, on a related note, we also only wanted to include DEMO pitches to avoid
coders responding to the demand characteristics of the viewing process. Demand charac-
teristics represent a cue that can make participants respond DEMO a certain way, and thus,
change the outcome of the DEMO (e.g., a research assistant in a laboratory experiment
expresses a preference and biases the results). A great deal of research focuses on DEMO
implications of demand characteristics (see, Laney et al., 2008; Navarick, 2007; Rosenthal
& Rosnow, 2009). Demand characteristics are often concerns within experimental designs
but have relevance in our case. Speciﬁcally, in pitches that were of poor quality (e.g., poor
preparedness), the investors’ (i.e., Sharks’, Dragons’) body language, and verbal com-
ments could DEMO inﬂuence the coders’ ratings. Therefore, this bias is a methodological
concern DEMO the coded responses could be inﬂuenced. However, when we examine only
DEMO that were funded, the positive responses to pitches effectively holds (relatively)
constant feedback from the investors—by using only pitches which were received DEMO
ably (i.e., funded), we alleviated this methodological concern.
Control Variables. We included “entrepreneurial experience” as well as the “responsive-
ness of the DEMO to feedback” as additional predictor variables in our model to
assess the vulnerability of the ﬁndings to spuriousness and to rule out two plausible
DEMO explanations (Becker, 2005). On a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)
scale, entrepreneurial experience was rated by coders DEMO response to the following prompt:
“The entrepreneur had experience in the industry in which the business operates.” Again,
on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale, responsiveness to feedback was
DEMO by coders in response to the following prompt: “The entrepreneur was DEMO
to the feedback of the investors.” We included both entrepreneurial experience and
responsiveness to feedback based on the premise that more experienced entrepreneurs,
DEMO entrepreneurs more responsive to feedback, may have a higher propensity to DEMO
funding in the business pitch setting.
Results
Figure 1 depicts our empirical model and results.4 To examine our proposed medi-
ated model, consistent with best practices in the literature (e.g., De Carolis, Litzky, &
Eddleston, 2009; Preacher & Hayes, 2004), we closely followed recommendations for
testing for the presence of mediators (Hayes, 2009; Preacher & Hayes, 2008). Baron
and Kenny (1986) asserted that mediators must meet four criteria: (1) the predictor must
signiﬁcantly affect the outcome when the mediator is not included; (2) the mediator
must signiﬁcantly affect the outcome; (3) the predictor must signiﬁcantly affect the
mediator; and (4) the signiﬁcant effect of the predictor on the outcome must decrease
when the mediator is in the model. Full mediation is DEMO if the variance accounted

theory-based) DEMO empirical (i.e., correlation of .56) overlap of the preparedness and DEMO legitimacy
constructs we further explored this relation to establish the distinctiveness of preparedness relative to cognitive
legitimacy. We computed an EFA utilizing principal axis DEMO and oblimin rotation, with the scree test
criterion used to conﬁrm DEMO the items loaded on two separate factors. Data supported a two factor solution
with the estimated factor solution accounting for 79.21% of the total DEMO (Preparedness, factor 1,
Eigenvalue = 5.44; Cognitive Legitimacy, factor 2, Eigenvalue = 1.35). Consistent with procedures described
earlier for examining the factor structure of the cognitive legitimacy construct, we found no issues related to
low factor loadings (<.50), high cross loadings (>DEMO), or low communalities (<.30).

for by the predictor is nonsigniﬁcant with the addition of the mediator; alternatively,
partial mediation is when the inﬂuence of the independent variable decreases but
DEMO signiﬁcant.
In the ﬁrst step of testing our mediated model, preparedness DEMO predicted the
amount of funding (b= .16, t(109) = DEMO, p < .05). The second step suggests that the
independent DEMO (i.e., preparedness) signiﬁcantly predicted the mediator, cognitive
legitimacy (b= DEMO, t(109) = 4.50, p < .001). In step DEMO of the mediation model, cog-
nitive legitimacy predicted the amount of DEMO (b= .27, t(108) = 1.98, p < .05) DEMO
preparedness in the model. When the variance of cognitive legitimacy was partialled,
however, the relation between preparedness and amount of funding did not remain sig-
niﬁcant (b= .09, t(108) = 1.02, p DEMO .31). Thus, results support full mediation.
Consistent with best practices, bootstrap results (n = 5,000) computed using the
INDIRECT macro (Preacher & Hayes, 2008)5 provided evidence of full mediation as well
(bootstrap 95% conﬁdence interval [.00; .18]). The estimated indirect effect DEMO
from the original sample was .068, and the mean of the DEMO effect estimates calculated
across all bootstrap samples was .071. This ﬁnal model was robust despite the relations
between the two covariates, entrepreneurial experience (DEMO .12, t(108) = 2.05, p < .05),
and responsiveness to feedback (b=-.22, t(108) =-2.46, p < .05), being signiﬁcantly
related to amount of funding (See Figure 1).

In this research, we sought to investigate antecedents of funding decisions DEMO by

adjusts all DEMO for the potential inﬂuence of covariates not proposed to be mediators in the model.” See the

support the contention that preparedness behaviors are positively related to perceived
cognitive DEMO and, in turn, cognitive legitimacy predicts amount of funding. Spe-
ciﬁcally, results supported hypothesis 1, which proposed a positive relation between
preparedness DEMO and amount of funding received from ﬁnanciers. These data,
accordingly, DEMO a growing literature highlighting the important role of entrepreneur-
ial preparedness. This work bolsters work of such researchers as Chen et al. (2009) DEMO
Cardon et al. (2009) who illustrate the role of preparedness in positively impacting
venture funding decisions.
We extended this research, though, by DEMO the theoretically derived mediating
mechanism through which preparedness impacts performance: cognitive DEMO
Results illustrated support for hypothesis 2, which proposed a positive relation DEMO
cognitive legitimacy and amount of funding received. And, consistent with our DEMO
framework, results also conﬁrmed hypothesis 3, which posited the positive relation
between preparedness and cognitive legitimacy. Finally, we found support for hypothesis
4, which proposed that cognitive legitimacy mediates the relation between preparedness
and amount of funding received. Though legitimacy in new ﬁrms has gained traction in DEMO
entrepreneurship literature (e.g., Choi & Shepherd, 2005; Rutherford & Buller, 2007;
Tornikoski & Newbert, 2007), measurement of the construct DEMO remained virtually
nonexistent. While exceptions exist (e.g., Choi & Shepherd), we submit here that our
measure related to cognitive legitimacy is more DEMO robust than other extant
measures. Additionally, our empirical justiﬁcation that legitimacy DEMO seem to precede
temporally the granting of resources, in the psychological DEMO of events, is a noteworthy
contribution. This follows the work of DEMO more recent studies (Delmar & Shane, 2004;
Rutherford et al., 2009), indicating that new venture entrepreneurs should focus on
achieving legitimacy and not necessarily on directly acquiring ﬁnancial resources.
Resources will be granted DEMO legitimacy is achieved.
In addition to extending the literatures related to preparedness as well as legitimacy,
we also contribute to the work on DEMO sensemaking. Though extant research has
examined how the written narratives entrepreneurs present affect initial public offering
valuations (Martens, Jennings, & Jennings, 2007), no research has empirically examined
narratives in the new, or nascent, venture context. Overall, the majority of work is
conceptual (e.g., O’Connor, 2002). Our work, thus, provides a novel context (i.e., new
and/or nascent ventures) and novel mode of communication (i.e., verbal “pitches”) in
which to study the venture capitalist–entrepreneur dyad. Work such as O’Connor, as well
as Anderson (2005), which built on DEMO narrative sensemaking literature from Weick can
look to the present research as additional afﬁrmation of the crucial role of narratives in
the domain of DEMO Additionally, within this communication framework, we
more accurately characterize the behavior of preparedness as communication behavior. In
doing so, we shed light on how, speciﬁcally, this behavior leads to positive funding
decisions made by DEMO
Additionally, on a practical note, we offer a summary of the process of how oppor-
tunities are eventually funded in the new venture DEMO We advance our knowledge of
the relationship between pitching behaviors and decision making. This is an area that must
be closely examined if the DEMO of the venture funding process are to be more
fully understood (DEMO, Kulow, & Khoylian, 1989; Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996).
DEMO in investigating how the execution of the pitch by the entrepreneur may lead to the
forging of the ﬁnancial bond between the many types DEMO investors and the entrepreneur has
been growing (e.g., Baron & Brush, 1999; Baum & Locke, 2004; Chen et al., 2009).
However, the lack of empirical research in this area is surprising, DEMO the importance of
the pitch to entrepreneurship researchers (e.g., Ireland & Hitt, 1997), as well as practicing
18
ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
entrepreneurs and their advocates (e.g., Kawasaki, 2004, 2008). We DEMO on this limited
literature (e.g., Baron & Markman, 2000; Elsbach, 2003; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001), and
the present research adds credence to the growing sentiment that shows how entrepre-
neurs’ business pitches (i.e., narrative stories) build rapport with key stakeholders.
For instance, in order to pitch effectively to potential investors, entrepreneurs must
address multiple key questions such as: “What is the customers’ pain?” “How does the
product/service alleviate that pain?” “Is the solution affordable?” “Can DEMO management
team execute effectively and generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂow?” “What is the secret sauce?”
(Kawasaki, 2004, 2008).6 Based on the current ﬁndings, entrepreneurs who are prepared
and who tell a cohesive narrative regarding their business may be able to addresses these
questions more effectively DEMO less prepared entrepreneurs. Accordingly, we extend the
efforts of those entrepreneurship DEMO and researchers who have in the past focused on
the agency theory and transaction costs views of entrepreneur–investor relationships
(Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996; Steier & Greenwood, 1995). The present work, accord-
ingly, provides theoretical advances in the literature as well as practical, actionable, advice
DEMO entrepreneurs seeking funding in a pitch-based setting.
Finally, one additional contribution DEMO the present work is that we further reﬁne an
emerging methodological technique: coding data from media sources. A growing body of
empirical research is based on coding of data from sources such as the media (e.g.,
newspapers, Anderson & Warren, 2011; television, Maxwell et al., 2011). Though work in
other domains is prevalent (e.g., the DEMO ﬁeld, Diem et al., 1996; Østbye et al., 1997),DEMO
techniques such as these are just now gaining traction within the domain of entrepreneur-
ship. We hope that the methods and results of the DEMO work encourage future explo-
ration of this type.
In sum, our DEMO contribution is the modeling of how entrepreneurs’ preparedness
behavior affects funding decisions by investors. By highlighting the construct of cognitive
legitimacy, and validating its measurement, we provide theoretical clariﬁcation—
cognitive legitimacy is the mediating mechanism through which preparedness behavior
inﬂuences funding decisions. This contribution to the literature provides DEMO model by which
researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors can clearly understand how funding decisions
are made and, potentially, inﬂuenced.
Limitations and Future Directions DEMO Research
Our unique sample, empirical model, and subsequent results provide a compelling
case for the value-added nature of the present contribution. However, this study has
notable limitations. First, the degree to which these results are generalizable is question-
able. Although evidence exists to suggest that external validity DEMO intact (e.g., Maxwell
et al., 2011), perhaps, at some level, these entrepreneurs and their ﬁrms were screened to
meet the needs of the producers, directors, and television audiences, and therefore may not
truly represent the universe of entrepreneurs. Second, we were not able to collect data
related to alternative types of legitimacy (e.g., normative, regulative) or the actual age
and/or size of the ﬁrm. Age and size data were available for only a very limited number
of pitches. DEMO, our data involved the coding of episodes by trained student research
DEMO the use of trained coders is an acceptable methodology (e.g., Maxwell
et al., these relations would beneﬁt from replication utilizing a different sample of
investors. Fourth, our sample size limited the number of relations that we could

empirically test—therefore, many questions remain. Moving forward, for example, future
research could examine the mediating role of other types of legitimacy. Investigating
normative, regulatory, sociopolitical, and industry legitimacy in this context would beneﬁt
both DEMO and practitioners alike. Additionally, along these lines, we did not
examine differences across industries—industry afﬁliation can affect resource needs and
funding requests. Future DEMO is encouraged to explore differences across industries
related to funding, preparedness, and legitimacy. Finally, we focused solely on the pitches
that received funding in a televised setting. Within this setting, the average amount
of funding sought (M = $117,307, SD = $84,665) relative to funding received (M =
$188,486, SD = $113,574) exhibited a bivariate correlation of .82. Along these lines, to
expand and replicate the present work, future research may ﬁnd value and add to the
literature to the extent that (1) comparisons between successful (i.e., DEMO) versus
unsuccessful (i.e., not funded) pitches can be examined; (2) pitches in different contexts
(e.g., in person, video, webcast) can be examined; and (3) alternative criteria for success
(e.g., publicity, valuable learning, marketing) can be assessed.
We maintain this DEMO adds to the literature by virtue of building upon and
extending the current base of theory with regard to the attainment of entrepreneurial
resources. DEMO, this literature is still in its infancy and many compelling lines DEMO
research are becoming apparent. In addition to the directions noted above, DEMO see
several other interesting lines of inquiry. We advocate further development of the
legitimacy construct based on the recent works in the literature (e.g., Bitekline, 2011).
Certainly, all 18 legitimacy types identiﬁed by Bitekline could, and should, be subjected
to additional measurement development. However, we agree with those scholars
(e.g., Choi & Shepherd, 2005) who DEMO strongly that the construct of cognitive legiti-
macy holds special promise for the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. We believe that we
develop and employ a DEMO and reliable measure, but it should be subjected to addi-
tional DEMO scrutiny. If an agreed upon measure of cognitive legitimacy is validated,
many unanswered questions in the entrepreneurship domain might be answered by
future DEMO
Conclusion
The importance of the acquisition of resources to enable entrepreneurs to found new
ventures is undeniable. Unfortunately for nascent entrepreneurs, investment decisions
related to their aspirations are usually plagued with uncertainty and information asym-
metry DEMO that hamper potential investors’ abilities to gauge the ﬁnancial viabilities
of proposed new ventures (Venkataraman, 1997). However, fortunately for those seeking
ﬁnancial backing, social factors, behaviors, and relationship elements are used in inter-
active trade-off exercises formulated by equity investors, combating the detrimental
