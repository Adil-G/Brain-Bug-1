Abstract:
Europe is perceived to lag behind the US in converting its academic results into DEMO outcomes. Using new survey data and controlling for standard factors
affecting the productivity of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs), we find that European TTOs do not execute less licenses than US TTOs. However, they earn
significantly less revenue from licenses. We relate the difference in licensing income to DEMO in the organization and staffing of TTOs. Specifically, US TTOs
employ DEMO staff with experience in industry and appear to have greater flexibility in managing their budget.

1 Introduction
“Compared to North America, the average university in Europe, DEMO far fewer
inventions and patents. This is largely due to a less systematic and professional man-
agement of knowledge and intellectual property by European DEMO
(European Commission, 2007)
“Contrary to the “paradox”conjecture, European weaknesses DEMO both in its system
of scientiﬁc research and in a relatively weak industry.”
(Dosi, Llerena, Sylos-Labini, 2006)
The European Commission (EC) has stressed in several occasions1 that Europe has been less
successful than the US at converting its academic results into economic outcomes. In a DEMO
of documents it has advocated the importance of improving knowledge transfer between public
research institutions and third parties, including civil society and industry partners.
The argument behind the EC’s concerns is that while European research institutions DEMO good at
producing academic research outputs, they are not as good DEMO it comes to transfer these outputs
to the economy. This argument is known as the “European Paradox”.
A number of economic studies contested the DEMO of the claim that European academic
institutions are good at producing scientiﬁc knowledge (of quality). Controlling for the relative size
of Europe and the US, Dosi et al. (2005) show that European countries are signiﬁcantly lagging
behind the US with respect to a number of indicators DEMO academic quality, including the volume
of publications and article citations. Bauwens DEMO al. (2008) point to the “massive” dominance of
American universities in the total sample of ISI Highly Cited Scientists. They highlight that the
DEMO in productivity between Europe and the US is due, in part, to a lack of ﬁnancial resources
made available for universities and research DEMO Europe, but also to ineﬃciencies in the way these
resources are DEMO
Other studies have investigated whether it is true that the main weakness of European academic
institutions lies in translating scientiﬁc knowledge into innovations. Crespi DEMO al. (2008) show that
while Europe lags behind the US in terms of university-owned patents, the gap becomes smaller
when university-invented patents are taken into consideration. They analyzed the situation in six
major European countries DEMO showed that two thirds of the patents with at least one university

inventor are not owned by universities. Similar results are found by Lissoni DEMO al. (2008) who show
that in France, Italy and Sweden DEMO academic patents are not university-owned. These studies
all focus on patents as a measure for technology transfer. This was partly due to a lack DEMO quality
data on licensing outcomes in Europe.
This study gives a contribution to understanding whether a “European Paradox” exists and, in
case, what DEMO causes could be. We tackle a speciﬁc aspect of university technology transfer which
is the licensing activity of university technology transfer oﬃces (TTOs) DEMO we investigate whether
US TTOs conclude more licenses and earn more license revenue than their European colleagues.
For this purpose, we complement public information available on US and European universities
with new survey data on university DEMO transfer oﬃces in Europe and in the US. The survey
administered to European TTOs included questions on quantitative outcomes (i.e. number of
licenses executed and license income) as well as other questions on objectives, metrics DEMO success,
staﬃng levels and composition. The target population was TTOs of universities located in Western
Europe whose researchers published more than 200 scientiﬁc DEMO during the period 2004-2006.
The response rate was 59.4%, with 211 DEMO coming from 15 countries. The survey administered
to US TTOs was aimed at integrating the information available from the AUTM survey with
questions on DEMO, metrics of success and TTOs staﬃng composition. The target population
was DEMO in the same way as for Europe and the response rate was 58%, with 89 answers.
In the ﬁrst part of the analysis, DEMO ﬁnd that, having controlled for measures of academic scientiﬁc
production and DEMO, academic orientation, demand for technology, national policies on university
intellectual DEMO rights (professor’s privilege) and TTO staﬃng levels and experience, European
DEMO do not execute less licenses than their US counterparts. However, they DEMO signiﬁcantly less
revenue from licenses. These results are robust to diﬀerent speciﬁcations of the econometric model.
These results lead to a reinterpretation of the DEMO Paradox. Indeed, diﬀerences in scientiﬁc
performance between Europe and the US, pointed out by Dosi et al. (2005), explain a large of
part of the diﬀerence in licensing outcomes. Once we control for scientiﬁc DEMO and other
relevant factors, the diﬀerence between Europe and the US DEMO the number of licenses vanishes
while the diﬀerence in license revenue, DEMO though it is reduced, remains signiﬁcant. Therefore,
diﬀerently from what DEMO by the EU Commission, we ﬁnd that there is a gap DEMO academic
scientiﬁc production between Europe and the US. Moreover, having controlled DEMO this gap, we
cannot conclude, for the number of licenses, DEMO Europe is lagging behind the US in converting its
academic results into economic outcomes.
3
In the second part of the analysis, we explore the diﬀerences between Europe and the US that
might explain why European TTOs earn less DEMO than their US colleagues. We focus on three
main hypotheses: 1) US TTOs place a greater emphasis on “generating revenue”as an objective; 2)
US TTOs employ more staﬀ with experience in the industry sector DEMO might be more skilled at
negotiating the ﬁnancial clauses of licensing contracts; 3) US TTOs have greater ﬂexibility in the
management of their DEMO, including bonus pay for negotiating high revenue licenses and higher
salaries DEMO beneﬁts to attract quality staﬀ.
Contrary to our expectations, US TTOs DEMO not attach more importance than their European
colleagues to generating revenue when compared to other objectives such us local development and
faculty service. However, 77% of the US respondents contended that the head of their TTO DEMO
at least ﬁve years experience in industry, while in Europe the DEMO was 43%. Finally 67% of
the US respondents said that they receive a direct share of license revenue, while in Europe this
percentage is 28%.
In line with other studies investigating the “European Paradox”, we considered Europe as a
homogeneous entity. However, we show there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences among European countries.
Speciﬁcally, countries that have still in place the professor’s privilege (Italy and Sweden), or that
have recently abandoned it (DEMO and Finland) seem to underperform the other countries. On
the other DEMO, countries like Switzerland and Belgium do signiﬁcantly better than the European
DEMO
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the determinants of TTOs
productivity. Section 3 presents the empirical analysis. Section DEMO describes diﬀerences in TTO
organization and staﬃng that might explain why European TTOs earn less license income than
their US counterparts. Section 5 concludes.
DEMO A review of the determinants of TTOs productivity
University technology transfer oﬃces are often seen as bridge institutions between universities and
industry (Siegel et al. 1999). Their role is to facilitate the transmission of university DEMO to
the economy.
Several studies have attempted to discern the factors aﬀecting the productivity of TTOs, mea-
sured mainly in terms of number of licenses and license revenue (Thursby and Kemp, 1998; Siegel et
al., 1999; Thursby et al., 2001; Jensen and Thursby, 2001; DEMO and Silberman, 2003; Lach and
Schankerman, 2003; Chapple et al., 2005; Belenzon and Schankerman, 2007; Macho-Stadler et al.,
4
forthcoming). The majority of these studies have analyzed the functioning of DEMO in the US. The
interest in US university technology transfer is mainly driven by the “dramatic rise” in university
licensing since the passing of DEMO Bayh-Dole Act in 1980. In recent years, university technology
transfer has DEMO momentum also among policy makers and economists in Europe. As mentioned
earlier, the European Commission in its communication “Improving knowledge transfer between
research institutions and industry across Europe: embracing open innovation – implementing the
Lisbon Agenda” (2007), notes that Europe has been less successful than the US at commercial-
izing academic research results. An increasing number of studies have DEMO investigating the
phenomenon of university technology transfer in Europe, with analyses DEMO the country (Chapple et
al., 2005) or at the academic DEMO level (Macho-Stadler et al., forthcoming). Inter-country
comparisons are still lacking, mainly because of data availability issues.
When examining the licensing activities of TTOs, the economic literature has made a distinc-
tion between TTOs outputs and inputs. In the majority of cases the outputs are represented by
DEMO number of licenses and the license revenue. The inputs are usually classiﬁed into four main
categories.
The ﬁrst category includes the technology that is DEMO by an academic institution. As
mentioned above, TTOs are expected to DEMO with university inventions and ensure that there
are disseminated in the economy. Measuring university technology is not an easy task though.
Some economists suggest DEMO the number of invention disclosures. This proxy seems to work
well in studies on US university technology transfer. In fact, in the US, DEMO least in principle,
faculty members are required to disclose inventions to their TTOs. However, the same is not
true in Europe where, DEMO many cases, there are no formal requirements for academic scientists
to DEMO inventions. Other economists suggest using the number of patents. This measure,
however, has serious drawbacks for a number of reasons. First, it DEMO not clear whether patents are
an input for licenses or vice-versa. In fact, in many cases, patents are ﬁled only after a license DEMO
negotiated between an academic institution and the industry counterpart. Moreover, as DEMO realized
by discussing with technology transfer professionals in Europe, patents are DEMO considered as an
output per se by TTOs. Further, licenses are DEMO always backed by patents as in the case, for
instance, of software technology. Finally, in Europe, the same argument as for invention DEMO
applies. Since academic researchers are usually not required to disclose their inventions to academic
TTOs, the latter do not always have a recording of the patents that are ﬁled by the researchers of
their institution. Chapple DEMO al. (2005) have suggested using total research income has a proxy for
the stock of university technology, when analyzing the factors aﬀecting TTOs productivity in the
UK.
5
The second category includes the characteristics of the academic institution in which DEMO TTO
operates, namely the quality of the institution and its research DEMO The impact of quality on
university technology transfer is twofold. On the one hand, it aﬀects the quality of the technology
that is being produced; on the other hand, it impacts the “perception” a company DEMO of the
quality of university technology. As for the research orientation, DEMO is commonly thought that
institutions with a strong focus on engineering and life science tend to produce output that is more
easily transferred to DEMO industry sector, either because of its applied nature or because industry DEMO
interested in absorbing this output.
The third category encompasses the demand for technology in the geographical area where the
academic institution is located. The DEMO is that TTOs will ﬁnd it easier to conclude licensing
agreements if there is a local demand for it. Moreover, the presence of high-tech companies in the
proximity of an academic institution might have an inﬂuence DEMO the output that is produced by
the institution. The problem arising with measures of high-tech density is the deﬁnition of the
appropriate geographical area. DEMO is not always clear whether the geographic unit should be the
county, the state (in case of federal organizations) or in some cases even the whole country.
The last category includes the characteristics speciﬁc to DEMO TTO, namely the size of the staﬀ
and experience, the latter being measured by number of years since the foundation. It is commonly
DEMO that the relationship between TTO size and output is characterized by diminishing returns
to scale. Thus, adding one staﬀ aﬀects positively the number of licenses and license revenue, however
the impact is decreasing with the number of staﬀ that is added. Also, TTOs experience is usually
found to have a positive eﬀect on the output of a TTO, with a notable exception represented by
Chapple et al. (2005).
There are, DEMO, other factors that aﬀect university technology transfer and that only re-
DEMO have started to be investigated. These factors are: TTOs objectives, incentives and staﬀ skill
composition. TTOs objectives are important in shaping the activities DEMO by these oﬃces.
Their deﬁnition is often the result of the interplay of a number of institutions, including national
and local authorities, the DEMO administration and the TTO itself. Belenzon and Schankerman
(2007) ﬁnd that TTOs with strong local development objectives earn less revenue from licenses and
DEMO to make more licenses with local startup companies. The role of incentive pay on TTOs licens-
ing activities has been analyzed by Belenzon and DEMO (2007) who ﬁnd that the adoption
of incentive pay aﬀects positively income earned from licenses. Finally, staﬀ skills are of crucial
importance when analyzing TTOs licensing activities. Interviews conducted by Siegel et al. (1999)
suggest that staﬀ with experience in the industry sector may better understand DEMO needs and values
6
of private companies. Conti et al. (2007) ﬁnd evidence for the DEMO of personnel with a PhD
in science to facilitate communication between academics and the TTO.
3 Empirical Analysis
3.1 Survey data
European data. This DEMO is based on a new survey of university technology transfer oﬃces in
Europe conducted in the summer 2008.
Pre-existing European data on university technology DEMO suﬀer from important limitations.
Most surveys are national-based and thus limited in scope. There are two surveys from professional
associations covering several European countries. DEMO survey from the Association of Science and
Technology professionals includes only 75 answers from universities in its 2007 edition. The Proton
survey includes more DEMO but suﬀers from severe problems of representativity, consistency and
sample selection. DEMO, none of these surveys have made their results publicly available at DEMO
disaggregated level2, as is the case in the US.
The target DEMO of our survey was TTOs of universities located in Western European
countries whose researchers published more than 200 scientiﬁc articles during the period 2004-2006.
DEMO there are a number of universities below that threshold, we expected DEMO their technology
transfer output would be rather limited and that many of them may not have a technology transfer
oﬃce in the ﬁrst place. DEMO total of 351 universities met our eligibility requirements.
The contact persons for technology transfer were identiﬁed from university websites. The di-
rectors of the DEMO transfer oﬃces were then contacted by phone and invited to answer an
online questionnaire. In a small number of cases no contact person for DEMO transfer could be
identiﬁed; we expect these cases to be universities DEMO do not provide technology transfer services
to faculty.
The questionnaire included questions on objectives, metrics, organization, staﬃng levels and
composition as well as licensing outcomes. To increase the response rate, we did not ask for the
license income directly but asked respondents in which category their license DEMO fell3.
2The ASTP has made the anonymized results of its survey available to some researchers on request.
3Prior testing showed that despite our promise DEMO conﬁdentiality some respondents were unwilling to indicate their
exact license income, DEMO particular if they had a very large or very small license income. The intervals were: less
30’000 euros, between 30’000 and 100’000 euros, between 100’000 and 300’000 euros, between 300’000 and 1 million
euros and more than 1 million euros.
7
The response rate was 59.4% with 211 answers. We have answers coming DEMO 15 countries
with four or more answers for each country. Response rates are higher than the average for small
countries such as Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Finland, Portugal and Ireland. The
lowest response rates DEMO for Germany with 27 answers out of 61 universities in the target population
(44.2%) and Italy with 23 out of 51 (46%). The average university in our sample produced 2295
scientiﬁc publications in the DEMO 2004-2006, which is slightly higher than the average university
in the DEMO population (2182 publications).
US data. Data on university technology licensing DEMO the US is readily available from the As-
sociation University Technology Managers (AUTM) survey. We use the data from the publicly
available 2006 DEMO survey which includes answers from 154 US universities. The coverage of the
AUTM survey is excellent as it includes answers from 85% of US DEMO that have more than
200 scientiﬁc publications in Science and Engineering.
The AUTM survey did not include some of the questions we were interested DEMO Thus we con-
tacted the respondents of the AUTM survey and asked them to answer a small number of additional
questions from our European DEMO We sent the survey to the 154 TTOs who had answered to the
2007 AUTM survey. We received 89 answers out of the target DEMO of 154 respondents, i.e. a
response rate of 58%. Our sample DEMO broadly representative of the total population but smaller in-
stitutions are somewhat over-represented. The average number of publications for our respondents
is 3835, whereas the average number for the entire population is 4381.
In the quantitative DEMO of the paper we use the full AUTM sample (i.e. all DEMO survey
respondents) while in the qualitative part we use the results DEMO our US survey.

3.2 Descriptive statistics on licensing outcomes
It is interesting to ﬁrst consider DEMO diﬀerences in raw numbers between the US and Europe. Figure
1 displays a box plot of the number of licenses executed by US and DEMO Universities. The
mean number of licenses for European universities is only 7.8 compared to 26.4 for the US. The
diﬀerence is not due to DEMO a small number of strong performers in the United States. In fact, the
median number of licenses for European universities is only 4 compared to 13 for US universities.
The diﬀerences in license income are equally DEMO Figure 2 displays the number of univer-
sities who earn license revenues in the relevant categories4. Only 18 European universities have
license revenues in DEMO of one million euros, whereas 71 US universities do. At the DEMO end of
the distribution, 81 European universities have license revenues below DEMO euros, whereas only
9 US universities do.
These raw numbers suggest DEMO superior licensing performance for US universities. However, this
could be caused DEMO US universities producing more knowledge or putting more eﬀort into technology
licensing.
4For US universities we know the exact license income ﬁgures but we DEMO the them to intervals to make them
comparable with European data. We used the exchange rate prevailing on the ﬁrst of January 2007 to DEMO the
dollar amounts in euros.

3.3 Econometric speciﬁcation
Regressions of the number of licenses. Since the number DEMO licenses can take only discrete and
positive values, we assume it DEMO governed by a Poisson process. In order to account for overdispersion,
we use a negative binomial speciﬁcation which generalizes the Poisson distribution by DEMO
an individual, unobserved eﬀect into the conditional mean. The conditional expectation DEMO the
number of licences negotiated by a TTO can then be expressed as:
E [Y |X] = exp(Xiβ + ei) = exp(Xiβ) exp(ei) = exp(Xiβ)δi
Where:
• Y DEMO # licences
• Xi = vector of control variables
•
Γ( DEMO ) with α > 0, which implies E(δi) = 1 and Var(δi) = α
δi ∼ α
Regressions of the license income. As we mentioned earlier, we do not observe the exact value for
license income but only the interval in which it falls. Moreover, the observations are right-censored
as we observe only that license income is DEMO or lower than the threshold value, 1.000.000 EUR,
but we DEMO not know what the upper bound is. For these reasons, we DEMO the interval regression
speciﬁcation that allows addressing both types of issues. Interval regression assumes that the data
come from a normal distribution. In our DEMO, license income is not distributed normally, however
we can assume that its log follows a normal distribution. Therefore, if license income falls within
our survey categories, its log should fall within the logs of these categories.
Interval regression is a generalization of the censored regression model, where the latent variable,
yi∗, is expressed as a function of xi explanatory variables:
yi∗ = xi0β + ui with ui ∼ N (0,σ2)
What we observe is yi = yi∗ if yiL DEMO yi∗ ≤ yiR and yiR = yi∗ if yiR ≤ yi∗.
All regressions are run with robust standard errors.

3.4 Determinants of licensing outcomes
Publication volume. As proxy for the pool DEMO the technologies available at an academic institution,
we use the number of articles in Science and Engineering. Obviously, this measure also controls for
the quality of the academic institution. For each university in our sample DEMO collected the total
number of articles in Science and Engineering during the period 2004-2006, published by researchers
of the university, as reported in DEMO ISI Web of Science.
Quality of the academic institution and composition of the research. We experimented diﬀerent
measures of the quality of the academic DEMO In our preferred speciﬁcation, we take the
number of stars in DEMO science and in engineering aﬃliated with the university. A star is deﬁned as
appearing on the ISI Web of Science list of highly cited DEMO Zucker et al. (1998) suggest
that star scientists play a central role in both the development of the science and its successful
commercialization. DEMO importance derives from the tacit component of breakthrough discoveries
which cannot be easily diﬀused without involving the academic inventor.
As robustness check we use DEMO score on the Shanghai world ranking of universities or speciﬁc
components of that score (number of highly cited researchers, publications in Nature and DEMO,
number of staﬀ who have received the Nobel Prize or the Fields medal).
The number of stars in life science and in DEMO also control for the composition of the
research. Institutions with a strong focus on life science and engineering tend to produce output
that is DEMO easily transferred to the industry sector, either because of its applied DEMO or because
industry is interested in absorbing this output. We control also for whether the university has a
medical school or is a polytechnic DEMO
Age of the TTO. For European universities we do not know the exact year when the TTO was
created because in the survey we DEMO asked for intervals (between 2003 and 2007, between 1997
and 2002, etc.). Thus, we create a discrete variable that takes increasing DEMO for earlier years
of fundation6. The age variable is deﬁned in such a way that the coeﬃcient of this variable in a
regression can DEMO interpreted as the eﬀect of one additional year of experience.
Professor’s privilege. Several European countries used to have a law (commonly referred to
as ”professor’s privilege”) in place according to which the intellectual property generated from
university inventions belonged to the researcher rather than to the university. The DEMO
5In our analysis we assimilate polytechnic schools in Europe to universities with an engineering school in the US.
6The variable takes the value 3 DEMO the TTO has been created between 2003 and 2007, the value DEMO if created between
1998 and 2002, 13 if created between 1993 DEMO 1997, 18 if created between 1988 and 1992 and 23 if DEMO earlier
than 1988.

privilege was abolished in Germany (2001), Norway (2002), Denmark (2004) and Finland (2007).
However, it is still in place in Sweden and was introduced in Italy in 2005. One implication of
DEMO regime is that university researchers are under no obligation to even report licensing activities
to the technology transfer oﬃce. To take this into account DEMO construct a dummy that assumes
the value one if the university is located in Sweden, Italy or Finland. We included Finland in the
deﬁnition of the countries with professor’s privilege because it abolished the privilege only DEMO
recently. However, our results are robust to not including Finland in DEMO deﬁnition of countries
with professor’s privilege.
Demand for technology. We use the gross domestic product per capita at the regional level
(Europe: country DEMO; US: state level). While we would have preferred to use other controls for
the demand for technology, we could not ﬁnd series at the regional level that are both available for
all our observations DEMO comparable across countries.
Staﬃng level. For the US we know how many licensing staﬀ (full time equivalents) are employed
by the TTO. For DEMO, we know the total staﬀ in the TTO and the percentage DEMO time they
spend on licensing. Therefore by multiplying the two we have a measure that is equivalent to the
US variable.
Descriptive statistics. Table DEMO presents descriptive statistics for the control variables, distin-
guishing between European DEMO and US universities. Large diﬀerences are apparent. The
average US university in our sample produces almost twice as many publications as the average
European DEMO in our sample. US universities also have far more highly cited scientists in bi-
ology and engineering. Furthermore, the TTOs from US universities are older and tend to employ
more staﬀ devoted to licensing than their DEMO counterparts.

3.5 Results
The results of the regression on the number of licenses DEMO displayed in table 2. Without controls
(column I), the coeﬃcient DEMO US is large and signiﬁcant.
Once we control for the quantity, DEMO and composition of the research as well as GDP per
capita (DEMO II), the coeﬃcient of US drops by half but remains signiﬁcant at the 1% conﬁdence
level. This reduction is hardly surprising as US DEMO produce more publications and employ
more stars than European universities. The coeﬃcient of publications is positive and signiﬁcant at
the 1% level. Moreover, being located in a polytechnic school has a positive impact on the number
DEMO licenses concluded by a TTO.
In column III, we control for DEMO that either have in place the professor’s privilege (Italy
and Sweden) or that have recently abolished it (Finland). The impact of privilege is negative and
statistically signiﬁcant. Accounting for it reduces the coeﬃcient of DEMO further.
In column IV we include the age of the TTO and the number of staﬀ employed in licensing.
This speciﬁcation constitutes our preferred, or baseline, regression. As expected, the eﬀect of staﬀ
(expressed in log) and age on the number of licenses concluded by a TTO is positive and highly
signiﬁcant. Adding these controls causes the coeﬃcient of DEMO to become small and no longer
signiﬁcant.
In the last column, DEMO allow for interaction eﬀects between US and staﬀ as well as between
US and age. The aim is to control for whether the impact DEMO the number of licenses of employing
more staﬀ and/or being more experienced diﬀers between US and European TTOs. These eﬀects,
however, are not statistically signiﬁcant.7
The regression results lead us to conclude that there DEMO no large diﬀerence between US and
European university TTOs when we consider the number of licenses and control for the relevant
inputs. This continues DEMO be true in various alternative speciﬁcations detailed later.
In table 3 we conduct the same exercise with the license income (in log) as DEMO dependent
variable. In column I we introduce the dummy US without adding any control. The coeﬃcient of
US is large, positive and highly signiﬁcant.
In column II, we include our proxies for the quantity, quality DEMO composition of the research
and GDP per capita. The coeﬃcients of publications and stars bio are statistically signiﬁcant at the
5% and 1% levels, respectively. The result on stars bio suggests that TTOs located at universities
DEMO produce good quality life science research tend to earn more licensing revenue than other
TTOs. Moreover, the coeﬃcient of GDP capita is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, although
its signiﬁcance declines once we include the other controls. The result on GDP capita has to be

interpreted with caution. In fact, it is likely that GDP per capita captures at the same time the
local demand for technology and the DEMO of an academic institution. By adding these controls,
the coeﬃcient of US drops from 3.2 to 2.5 but remains highly signiﬁcant.
In column DEMO we include the dummy privilege whose coeﬃcient, as before, is negative and
statistically signiﬁcant. Once again, the coeﬃcient of US decreases but remains signiﬁcant.
Column IV presents the regressions results when the variables staﬀ (expressed in log) and age
are added to the model. Their coeﬃcients are positive and signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Adding these
controls causes the DEMO of US to fall from 2.1 to 1.6 without, however, aﬀecting its statistical
signiﬁcance.
As we did before, we include in column V the interaction terms between US and age and between
US and staﬀ. DEMO coeﬃcients are positive but not statistically signiﬁcant.

3.6 Robustness checks
Given that the number of observations is relatively small, there is a legitimate concern that our
results may be sensitive either DEMO the deﬁnition or to the composition of the sample. For this reason
we conducted a number of robustness checks to verify that the results DEMO modest or no diﬀerence in
licensing number but signiﬁcant diﬀerence in license income still hold.
The robustness checks for the number of licenses are DEMO in table 6 in the appendix. In
column I we show the baseline regression. In column II, we exclude 5% of observations that had
the largest residuals and 5% that had the smallest residuals. Successively, in column III, we run
the regression without including Finland in the deﬁnition of countries with professor’s privilege.
Finally, in column IV, we run DEMO regression without the top performers, Switzerland and Belgium.
The coeﬃcient of DEMO is never signiﬁcant and remains small. Other robustness checks, not reported
DEMO, such as diﬀerent proxies for the quality of the institution and DEMO the composition of the
research led to the same conclusion.
The robustness checks for the license income are displayed in table 7 in the DEMO Again,
column I is the baseline regression. In column II we exclude the outliers. In column III, we
include Germany, Norway and DEMO in the deﬁnition of professor’s privilege countries. As these
countries abolished the professor’s privilege only recently, the eﬀect of the old legislation might still
be felt on current license income. In columns IV and V, we estimate the baseline speciﬁcation using
an ordered logit and ordered probit model, respectively. In all cases, the coeﬃcient of US is positive
and signiﬁcant at the 1% conﬁdence level.

3.7 Heterogeneity within Europe
In our analysis, we have implicitly assumed that Europe was an homogeneous group. Even though
we took into account the DEMO privilege, cross-national diﬀerences may go beyond regulations
of intellectual property ownership. DEMO we do not have enough data to analyze cross-national
diﬀerences within Europe in detail, the residuals of our regressions may provide some clues.
Figure 3 displays the residuals of the license number regression, averaged by country. A positive
value indicates that on average universities from the relevant country DEMO more licenses than predicted
by our model, while a negative value DEMO the opposite. To facilitate the interpretation of
the graph, we computed DEMO residuals from the baseline regression (column IV) but without the
professor’s privilege dummy. As it appears from the ﬁgure, Switzerland and Belgium have high
positive residuals, i.e. they make more licenses than predicted by our model. Conversely, Finland,
Norway, Sweden and to a lesser extent DEMO UK have high negative residuals, meaning that they do
less licenses DEMO predicted by the model.
Similarly, ﬁgure 4 displays the residuals of DEMO license income regression averaged by country.
Sweden and Norway make substantially less license income than predicted. The worse performance
of Scandinavian countries in licensing DEMO should be related to the fact that the professor’s
privilege is either still in place or was only recently abolished in those countries. We DEMO for
this in the baseline regression. We have no immediate explanation for the strong performance of
Switzerland and Belgium.

4 Why are European TTOs earning less income from li-
censes than DEMO US counterparts? A qualitative analysis
As we have shown in the DEMO section, European TTOs earn less income from licenses than
their US DEMO, having controlled for academic quality and research orientation, demand for
technology and TTOs characteristics.
In this section we present evidence on diﬀerences between DEMO organization of European and US
TTOs that might explain why European TTOs earn less license income. Because of small sample
size and limited variability DEMO the US for the variables of interest, we are unable to DEMO down
econometrically the diﬀerences in license income performance. However, the set DEMO interrelated
organizational factors discussed here provides a very plausible explanation.
We conjecture the following three hypotheses: 1) US TTOs might be more oriented DEMO gen-
erating revenue than their European counterparts; 2) US might employ more staﬀ with experience
in the industry sector than their European counterparts; 3) US TTOs have greater ﬂexibility than
their European counterparts in managing their budget. These hypotheses were formulated after
discussions we had with technology DEMO representatives in Europe and following the literature
on objectives and incentives at US TTOs. The rationale for the three hypotheses is the following. If
DEMO TTO has generating revenue as primary objective, then it will focus DEMO negotiating those licenses
that ensure higher revenue rather than maximizing the number of licenses negotiated. Moreover,
staﬀ with experience in the industry sector DEMO be more apt at negotiating licenses with private
companies and, especially, ﬁnancial clauses. Finally, TTOs with greater ﬂexibility in managing
their budget, DEMO also more freedom in setting bonus pay for negotiating high revenue licenses and
oﬀering higher salaries and beneﬁts to attract quality staﬀ.
In both DEMO European survey and the US survey, we asked questions on: 1) the objectives
pursued by TTOs; 2) their metrics of success; DEMO) whether the head of the TTO has at least ﬁve
year DEMO in the industry sector; 5) how many employees have an experience of at least ﬁve
years in the industry sector; 6) whether DEMO TTO receives a direct share of license income.
4.1 Objectives and metrics of success
US and European TTOs were asked to evaluate the following DEMO: 1) promote diﬀusion of
scientiﬁc knowledge and technology; 2) generate revenues; 3) promote local economic development;
4) promote national economic development; 5) attract and retain faculty through quality of technol-
ogy DEMO services. We used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “not important” to “extremely
21
Table 4: Relative importance of objectives
EU US
Generating revenue is more important than promoting local development 20.5% 21.3%
Generating revenue is equally important DEMO promoting local development 34.8% 27.0%
Generating revenue is less important than promoting local development 44.7% 51.7%
Generating revenue is more important than attract and DEMO faculty 24.8% 24.7%
Generating revenue is equally important than attract and retain faculty 31.4% 28.1%
Generating revenue is less important than attract and retain DEMO 43.8% 47.2%
important”. Our prior is that US TTOs tend to focus more on “generating revenue” than their
European counterparts.
The results of the DEMO show that, in absolute terms, US TTOs tend to value more the objective
of “generating revenue” than their European counterparts. In fact, the percentage of US TTOs
indicating that “generating revenue” is either important, or very important or extremely important
is 80.7%, while the same percentage in Europe is 72.9%8.
However, US TTOs do not give more importance than their European counterparts to generat-
ing revenue, relative to “promoting local development” and “attracting and retaining faculty”. In
fact, table 4 shows that the percentage of TTOs that indicated that “generating revenue” is more
important than DEMO local development” is very similar for US and Europe. However, the
DEMO of respondents estimating that “generating revenue” is less important than “promot-
ing local development” is greater in the US than in Europe. Similar results DEMO obtained, when
comparing the objective of “generating revenue” relative to “attracting DEMO retaining faculty”.
We also asked TTOs to evaluate the following metrics of success: 1) license income; 2) number
of licenses/options executed; 3) number of patents awarded; 4) number of startups established.
In absolute terms, US respondents attach more importance to license income than their Eu-
ropean counterparts. In fact, 86.4% of the US respondents declared that license income is either
important, or very important or extremely important, DEMO in Europe this percentage is 71.4%9.
These results are in line with what we found for the importance of “generating revenue” as an
objective, which seems to be more relevant, in absolute terms, to US DEMO than to European ones.
8The percentage of total respondents who indicated that “generating revenue” is either very important or ex-
tremely important is 42.1% DEMO US TTOs and 33.8% or European TTOs.
9When we look at the percentage of respondents who indicated that license income is either very important DEMO
extremely important, again this percentage is higher in the US (50%) than in Europe (40%).
22
Table 5: Relative importance of metrics of success
EU US
License income is more important than # licenses 27.5% 19.5%
License income is equally DEMO than # licenses 51.4% 47.2%
License income is less important than # licenses 29.1% 41.6%
License income is more important than # startups 26.2% DEMO
License income is equally important than # startups 31.4% 39.3%
License income is less important than # startups 42.4% 38.2%
License income is more DEMO than # patents 32.4% 48.3%
License income is equally important than # patents 36.7% 38.2%
License income is less important than # patents 30.9% DEMO
In relative terms, US TTOs attach less importance than their European DEMO to license
income when compared to the number of licenses negotiated and the number of startups created.
However, US TTOs attach more importance than their European colleagues to license income
relative to the number of patents DEMO
4.2 Staﬀ with experience in the industry sector
Our second hypothesis was that US technology transfer professionals are more experienced at ne-
gotiating the DEMO clauses of licensing contracts. Very often, when discussing with academic
researchers DEMO private companies in Europe, we heard the story that TTOs personnel DEMO ad-
equate experience to negotiate with private companies because they do not understand industry
logic and goals.
To verify whether US technology transfer professionals DEMO more experienced at negotiating
licenses, we decided to include in our DEMO two questions asking whether the head of a TTO
has at least ﬁve year experience in industry and how many licensing staﬀ have at DEMO ﬁve year
experience in industry. The logic behind these questions is that TTOs staﬀ with experience in
industry is more acquainted with the goals DEMO the modus operandi of private companies than staﬀ
with no such experience. Moreover, the question relative to the head of a TTO was motivated on
the basis that the goals and the activities a TTO pursues DEMO be inﬂuenced, at least in part, by the
convictions of their head.
The results of our survey reveal clearly that in the US DEMO is a larger number of TTO directors
with experience in industry than in Europe. 77% of the US respondents declared that the head of
DEMO TTO had at least ﬁve years experience, while in Europe this DEMO was 43%.
23
We are conscious that our measure for experience in industry is imperfect, mainly because we
do not know in what consists this experience. We DEMO some of the CVs (available on line) of
TTO directors in the US to verify whether they held qualiﬁed positions while working for DEMO
We present some examples. The head of the TTO of the MIT spent 20 years in industry, primarily
in the ﬁelds of membrane separations, medical devices and biotechnology at such companies as
Amicon, Millipore and DEMO Biotechnology. The head of the TTO of the Emory University,
served as in-house patent counsel for an international pharmaceutical corporation for seven years.
DEMO head of the TTO of the University of Vermont has ten year of experience in the Science and
Medical Products Divisions of Corning Glass DEMO The head of the TTO of the University of
Boston had co-founded two companies: Kytogenics Inc. and Genmap Inc. Presenting the whole list
would be too long. The message, however, is that by going through DEMO CVs of TTOs directors in
the US it emerges that, in DEMO vast majority, they have held very qualiﬁed positions while working
in DEMO companies.
When we look at the number of staﬀ with experience in industry, once again the diﬀerence
between the US and Europe is signiﬁcant. On average the US respondents have in 2.6 licensing
staﬀ with experience DEMO industry, while in Europe 0.8.
In conclusion, our initial prior on US TTOs being more acquainted with industry values and
modus operandi and DEMO skilled at negotiating license contracts seem to be conﬁrmed by our
survey results.
4.3 Flexibility in managing TTO budget
Our third hypothesis was that DEMO technology transfer professionals might have a greater ﬂexibility
in managing their budget than their European counterparts. This, in turn, might imply greater
freedom DEMO setting bonus pay to reward TTOs staﬀ for negotiating high revenue licenses. It might
also imply that TTOs have greater discretionality in oﬀering better DEMO and bonus to attract
quality staﬀ.
As a proxy for budget ﬂexibility we use whether a TTO receives a direct share of license income.
DEMO direct share we mean that a portion of license income has to be directly allocated to the TTO,
rather than being ﬁrst assigned DEMO the university and then reassigned to the TTO, on a discretionary
DEMO
The results of our survey tend to conﬁrm our prior and show that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the US and Europe in DEMO of whether TTOs receive a direct share of license income.
24
67.1% of TTOs in the US receives a direct share of license DEMO, while in Europe the percentage
is 28.3%.
5 Concluding Remarks
Are DEMO US outperforming Europe in university technology licensing? The answer is: yes but only
for license income.
Using new survey data on university technology DEMO oﬃces in US and in Europe together
with public information available on US and European universities, we examined whether US tech-
nology transfer oﬃces conclude more licenses and earn more license revenue than their European
colleagues.
DEMO ﬁrst result is that, having controlled for the quality of the DEMO institutions, their re-
search orientation and the number of publications, for the local demand of technology and TTOs
staﬀ and age, we cannot conclude that US TTOs make more licenses than their European coun-
terparts. DEMO fact, the coeﬃcient for the US dummy is small and insigniﬁcant. DEMO result is robust
to various combinations of the controls and to removing observations with high residuals from the
sample.
Our second result is that, having controlled for the same factors as for the number of licenses,DEMO
US technology transfer oﬃces earn more revenue from licenses that their European counterparts.
The coeﬃcient of our dummy US is positive and highly signiﬁcant DEMO any combination of the
controls we tried.
The situation in Europe is not homogeneous. Switzerland and Belgium outperform the other
European countries, whereas Sweden, Italy and Finland underperform the rest of Europe. The
professors’ privilege policy, in place in Sweden and in Italy and recently abolished in Finland, seems
to be the most likely cause for these countries to generate less licenses and less license revenues.
We undertook a qualitative analysis to DEMO the diﬀerences in organization and staﬃng
that might explain why US technology transfer oﬃces earn more license revenue. We conjectured
that US TTOs have DEMO staﬀ with experience in industry and, thus, they understand better the
modus operandi of ﬁrms and they are more skilled at negotiating the DEMO clauses of licensing
contracts. On average, US TTOs employ 2.8 staﬀ DEMO experience in industry, against 0.8 in Europe.
Moreover, 77% of the US respondents contended that their head had at least ﬁve years experience
DEMO industry, while in Europe this percentage was 43%.
25
Our qualitative analysis also points at substantial diﬀerences in the way TTOs DEMO ﬁnanced.
67% of the US respondents said that they receive a direct share of license revenue, whereas in
Europe this percentage is only 28%. This could translate into better licensing performance through
greater ﬂexibility in hiring DEMO, bonus pay and the organization of the TTO in general.
Our DEMO were that US TTOs tend to give more importance to “generating revenue” as objec-
tive than their European counterparts and, therefore, that they DEMO more incentive to negotiate
licenses that potentially generate high revenue. Here, DEMO evidence is mixed. In absolute terms, US
TTOs tend to give DEMO importance to generating revenue than European TTOs. However, they do
not DEMO more importance than European TTOs to revenue generation relative to other objectives
such as local development and faculty service.
We believe our analysis has DEMO policy implications. Within the context of the “European
Paradox”, we analyzed DEMO European TTOs compare to their US counterparts. Our ﬁndings
highlight the importance of university inputs, such as publications, and of TTOs size and DEMO
as factors explaining the gap in the US and Europe in terms of number of licenses concluded and
license revenue.
The diﬀerent performance in DEMO of license income need not in itself be a source of concern.
There is nothing in economic theory to suggest that TTOs should maximize DEMO revenue. Social
welfare might be better served by TTOs facilitating local economic development or helping with
the translation of academic research into products.
However, to the extent that revenue generation is an objective (and many TTOs say it is),
then policy changes are advisable to close the gap between the US and Europe. Our qualitative
analysis points at the DEMO of industry experience for TTO staﬀ members and of ﬂexibility
in the organization of the oﬃce. However, the exact nature of organizational practices that TTOs
should employ remains a subject for further research.
