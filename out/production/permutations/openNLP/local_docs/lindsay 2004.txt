Do business angels have an entrepreneurial
orientation?
NOEL J. LINDSAY
(Final version accepted 13 February 2004)
This research extends existing theory on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and the EO-
performance relationship of DEMO ﬁrms to business angels. Business angels are
high net worth individuals who invest their own money in early stage, new entrant, high
risk, unlisted entrepreneurial ﬁrms. Because of their investment focus, the environments
they operate in tend to be dynamic and changing where there is a need DEMO them to be
structured organically to respond to uncertainty and change. Underpinning the research is
the notion that business angels need to be consummate DEMO to be successful in
undertaking their investment activities. The research identiﬁed the EO construct as relevant
for describing the decision making activities and processes DEMO business angels. Business
angels do demonstrate an EO. In addition, all DEMO of the underlying EO dimensions
(proactiveness, innovativeness and risk taking) DEMO identiﬁed as being related to the
proﬁtability-growth performance scale used in this research.

Introduction
DEMO studies have focused on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of
ﬁrms and the factors that contribute to the success or performance of those
ﬁrms (e.g. Miller 1983, Miller and Friesen 1984, Covin and Slevin 1991,DEMO
Smart and Conant 1994, Lumpkin and Dess 1996, 2001). EO refers to the
‘processes, practices, and decision-making activities employed by entrepre-
DEMO that lead to new entry’ (Lumpkin and Dess 1996: 136). Measures of a
ﬁrm’s EO have evolved over the last two decades DEMO include proactiveness,
innovativeness, and risk taking (Miller 1983, Covin DEMO Slevin 1989).
This research builds upon previous research into the EO-performance
relationship of entrepreneurial ﬁrms by extending the EO construct and the
EO-performance DEMO to business angels. Business angels are high net
worth individuals who invest their own money in early stage, new entrant,
high risk, DEMO entrepreneurial ﬁrms (e.g. Hindle and Wenban 1999,
Harrison and Mason, 2000, Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000) although
some angel investors invest DEMO later stage entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Mason and

Harrison 2002b). Entrepreneurial ﬁrms ‘engage in product-market DEMO
tion, undertake somewhat risky ventures, and are ﬁrst to come up with
proactive innovations, beating competitors to the punch’ (Miller 1983: 771).
The research is based on the premise that business angels need DEMO be
‘consummate entrepreneurs’ to be successful. Entrepreneurs identify
opportunities and put together the necessary resources to develop those
opportunities (Timmons and Spinelli 2004). Business angels also need to be
selective in identifying business opportunities submitted DEMO entrepreneurs
before making the decision to invest since they are investing their own
money. Business angels face two investment decision error types: making a
decision to invest in a business and the business subsequently does not
DEMO (type I error); and making a decision not to invest DEMO a business and
the business subsequently performs beyond their expectations (type DEMO
error). Because business angels have scarce resources, they are more
DEMO with type I error. They are motivated to avoid bad investments
rather than pick ‘winners’ (Mason and Harrison 2002a).
The aim of this research is to provide insights into the relevance of the
EO construct DEMO examining business angels and the relationships of the
underlying EO dimensions to business angel performance. In doing this,
the research makes a theoretical DEMO by extending the literature
from entrepreneurs to business angels while providing insights for
practising private equity investors and government decision makers.
Obtaining a better DEMO of the determinants of business angel
performance is useful for developing buoyant early stage, informal private
equity markets.
Theory and hypotheses
Figure 1 presents a model for reviewing the relationship of the relevant EO
dimensions (the independent variables) to the business angel performance
measures (dependent variable). DEMO this research, the focus is at the ﬁrm
level. Individual business DEMO are viewed as the ﬁrm. This is consistent
with classical economics where individual behaviour has been identiﬁed as
affecting the strategic orientation displayed by DEMO (Covin and Slevin
1991, Lumpkin and Dess 1996).
Business angels
Business angels are the most prevalent form of private equity investor. Yet,DEMO
they are a heterogeneous group. As such, generalizations about business
angels DEMO be dangerous (Freear et al. 2002). Efforts have been made DEMO look
beyond the generalist ‘business angel’ label to identify more homogeneous
segments within the business angel grouping. This has resulted in a variety
of DEMO being developed (Freear et al. 2002). There appears,
however, to be no universally agreed upon taxonomy.
Traditionally, there has been a domination of middle-aged professional
males in the informal private equity market. In DEMO recent times, younger

people (both male and female) from a variety of backgrounds and with
promising careers have participated in DEMO private equity investments
(Abernathy and Heidtman 1999). Others have found DEMO that many
business angels have previous entrepreneurial experience and that they have
accumulated their wealth through these entrepreneurial activities rather
than through high income DEMO (Mason and Harrison 2002b). Thus,
the proﬁle of business DEMO appears to be both complex and changing.
Business angels are difﬁcult to locate (Mason and Harrison 2002a).
Although some of the more professional and syndicate-oriented business
angels may join associations, most do not (Abernathy DEMO Heidtman 1999).
Many business angels make only one or two investments during their career
although more experienced angels may have multiple investments (Mason
and Harrison 2002a). It seems that the more active business angels DEMO to
invest in additional opportunities but are hampered by a lack of suitable
potential investments (Mason and Harrison 1994, Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson DEMO).
Business angels provide an important service. It is the main source of risk
ﬁnance for many early stage businesses (Mason and Harrison 2002a: 215).
Without business angel resources, many entrepreneurial ﬁrms would not
DEMO and/or reach subsequent stages in the ﬁrm development life cycle.

Entrepreneurial orientation
EO is an essential feature of DEMO performing ﬁrms (Lumpkin and Dess
1996) and is concerned with the discovery and exploitation of proﬁtable
opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman 2000). It involves the organiza-
tional processes, methods, styles, practices, and decision-making DEMO
employed by entrepreneurs that lead to new entry (Stevenson and Jarillo
DEMO, Lumpkin and Dess 1996). New entry involves launching a new
DEMO either via a start-up ﬁrm, via an existing ﬁrm, or internally within a
larger corporation (Burgelman 1983). It can be accomplished by ‘entering
new or established markets with new or existing goods or services’
(Lumpkin and Dess 1996: 136).
EO measures include proactiveness, risk DEMO, and innovativeness
(Miller 1983, Covin and Slevin 1989, Lumpkin and Dess 1996, Wiklund
1999). Deﬁnitions used by Lumpkin and Dess (DEMO) are adopted in this
research to interpret the EO dimensions. Proactiveness DEMO an opportunity-
seeking, forward-looking perspective that involves introducing new
products/services DEMO acting in anticipation of future demand. It does
not necessarily mean ‘ﬁrst to market’ (Lumpkin and Dess 1996).
Innovativeness represents a ‘basic willingness to depart from existing
technologies or practices and venture beyond the current DEMO of the art’
(Lumpkin and Dess 1996: 142). Risk taking involves a tendency to take
bold actions, such as venturing into unknown new markets, committing a
large portion of resources to ﬁrms with uncertain outcomes, and/or
borrowing heavily (Lumpkin and Dess 1996).
These DEMO dimensions make unique contributions to a ﬁrm’s overall
level of entrepreneurial orientation (Miller 1983, Miller and Friesen 1984,
Covin and Slevin 1989)DEMO Researchers also have identiﬁed other possible
elements of EO including competitive aggressiveness and autonomy
(Lumpkin and Dess 1996, Dess et al. 1997). DEMO dimensions, however,
have not necessarily been adopted by other researchers (e.g. Kreiser et al.
2002).
This study uses proactiveness, innovativeness, DEMO risk taking as
measures of business angel EO (Miller 1983, Covin and Slevin 1989).
These dimensions may vary independently of each other DEMO on
speciﬁc organizational and environmental contexts (Miller 1988, Lumpkin
and Dess 1996, 2001). In other words, environmental and organizational
factors ‘inﬂuence DEMO an entrepreneurial orientation will be conﬁgured to
achieve high performance’ (Lumpkin DEMO Dess 1996: 151); they inﬂuence
the extent to which the DEMO EO dimensions vary independently in
inﬂuencing the EO-performance relationship (Lumpkin and DEMO 1996).
Relevance of EO to business angels
Research relating to the EO construct has been developed from the
perspective of the entrepreneurial ﬁrm. DEMO appear to be parallels,
however, between entrepreneurial ﬁrms and business DEMO ﬁrms in the
processes, practices and decision making activities that both DEMO Other

researchers also provide support for similarities between DEMO and
private equity investors in their entrepreneurial pursuits (e.g. Lindsay and
DEMO 2002). Both entrepreneurs and business angels actively search to
identify and invest in business opportunities that will result in their making
substantial proﬁts. DEMO achieve these proﬁts, both groups will look toward
employing innovative solutions DEMO will allow them to obtain an advantage
through the products and/or services offered. Both groups will assume a
degree of risk as they DEMO new or established markets. As such, just as the
EO construct DEMO relevant to entrepreneurs, it also will be relevant in
examining the DEMO processes, methods, styles, practices and
decision-making activities employed by business DEMO as they support the
new entry process through their entrepreneurial activities. Thus,
H1: Business angels will demonstrate an EO.
Contextual factors affecting business angel performance
Environmental and organizational factors ‘inﬂuence how an entrepreneurial
orientation will DEMO conﬁgured to achieve high performance’ (Lumpkin and
Dess 1996: 151). These factors inﬂuence the extent to which the underlying
EO dimensions vary DEMO in inﬂuencing the EO-performance
relationship (Lumpkin and Dess 1996: 152). With regard to business
angels, however, it is suggested that these DEMO contextual factors will almost
always be constant. Business angel environments will be dynamic and
changing and business angel ﬁrm structures will tend to be DEMO
Environmental factors: Business angels generally invest in new entrant
entrepreneurial ﬁrms (c.f. Mason and Harrison 2002b). These tend to be in a
DEMO of permanent transition as they struggle to proceed through the various
growth stages – each stage with its particular obstacles and challenges – and
DEMO always characterized by a shortage of cash to fund their growth.
Business angels, therefore, need to be able to deal with change. This DEMO be
the norm in their micro investment environments regardless of any macro
environmental factors that, if also are dynamic, will only increase the
DEMO and hostility of the environment they operate in.
Organizational factors: Dynamic DEMO uncertain environments tend to
necessitate organic ﬁrm structures (Burns and Stalker DEMO, Lawrence and
Lorsch 1967). Organic ﬁrms are decentralized, informal (DEMO that knowledge
is distributed throughout the organization more or less equally) DEMO have a
ﬂat structure that emphasizes lateral interaction among members (e.g.
DEMO and Stalker 1961: 119).
Business angels have a need to DEMO structured organically. They operate
individually, within small ﬁrm structures, or in small syndicates. This
allows for informal open communication and ﬂexibility in the DEMO they
respond to changing market forces. They need to be able to do this to tap
into deal ﬂow and be able to respond, when appropriate, in undertaking due
diligence and committing resources to investment opportunities.

EO drivers of business angel performance
In view DEMO the perceived constancy of business angel contextual factors, the
following hypotheses DEMO developed around the relevant EO dimensions
(proactiveness, innovativeness and risk taking). These drive performance in
organically structured business angel ﬁrms operating in DEMO and
changing environments.
Proactiveness: Business angels need to be proactive in DEMO for new
opportunities since they do not have a high proﬁle in the market. ‘There are
no directories of business angels, their investments are not publicly
recorded, and most strive to preserve their anonymity’ (Mason DEMO
Harrison 2002a: 216). As such, entrepreneurs looking for early stage private
equity ﬁnance may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to locate these investors. This DEMO
impinge upon business angel deal ﬂow.
In order to facilitate ‘deal ﬂow’ and access potential investments, business
angels need to use their initiative in searching out and identifying potential
investments. Search strategies may include environmental scanning, read-
ing relevant publications, and leveraging off professional and social
networks (DEMO and Heidtman 1999). Although both formal and
informal networks are utilized to tap into deal ﬂow, often investment
opportunities come from informal sources (friends, media, associates, etc.)
rather than from more formal DEMO (accountants, lawyers, etc.) (Van
Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000, Mason and Harrison 2002b).
Regardless of the search strategies employed, exceptional investments
that are potentially high performers often are difﬁcult to identify. In
addition, typically, for a variety of reasons, there are more deals looking DEMO
money than business angels are prepared to fund (Mason and Harrison
DEMO). Business angels are selective because it is their money they are using
(Mason and Harrison 2002a) and many deals presented to them DEMO not
investor ready. In view of this, business angels will be DEMO in searching
for and sifting through the various deals available in the market to identify
the potentially better performing ones. Their investment performance will
DEMO dependent upon their proactive search and evaluation behaviour.
Proactiveness also will extend to protecting their assets after they have
invested. Business angels adopt an DEMO management role in their investee
ﬁrms (Benjamin and Margulis 1996, Mason and Harrison 1996, 2002a).
This helps them to provide constructive input to assist in the development
of their investments as well as for DEMO satisfaction reasons. As such,
business angel proactiveness extends not only to the sourcing of
investments to enhance their selecting better performing investee ﬁrms,DEMO
but it also extends to their hands-on involvement with their investments to
enhance performance. As such,
H2: Business angel proactiveness will be positively related to
performance.
Innovativeness: Business angels are a self select group that, by their nature,
need to be innovative in how they invest and manage their investments if
Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: DEMO:10 22 December 2007
BUSINESS ANGELS ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION 203
their investments are to perform. For example, the nature of the dynamic
environments they operate in will dictate product-market DEMO (Miller
1983). Change is unpredictable in such environments. As such, non-creative/
non-innovative strategies will not be effective. Businesses with more creative
DEMO orientations will tend to outperform other organizational
types in more volatile environments (McKee et al. 1989).
Investments in new entrant ﬁrms are more volatile than later stage
investments (e.g. the track record of the entrepreneurial team will not be
established, the product may be relatively unknown in the market and
hence customer reactions to the product may be relatively DEMO, and
the reaction of competitors to the new entrant will be DEMO unknown).
As such, business angels need to be prepared to DEMO and offer creative
solutions and implement innovative strategies in solving problems
confronted in their investments to enhance investment performance. In
addition, by providing support, they may actually contribute to the EO of
their investees, which DEMO enhance investee performance (Bruining and
Wright 2002, for example, suggest DEMO venture capital/investee support
enhances investee EO). In other words, DEMO will be a
contributing factor to business angel performance. Thus,
H3: Business angel innovativeness will be positively related to
performance.
Risk taking: DEMO angels operate in dynamic environments that are not
risk free. They deal with business and ﬁnancial risk in choosing and
managing their investments to DEMO performance. Many business angels
look for investments in industries where they have a psychic afﬁnity,
expertise or experience to help them reduce their DEMO to market risk
(Fiet 1995) although some invest in industries where they have little
experience (Kelly and Hay 1996, Van Osnabrugge 1998)DEMO In any event,
investment decisions appear to be ‘largely determined by personal rather
than environmental considerations’ (Mason and Harrison 2002a: 277).
DEMO business angels tend to invest in early stage, new entrant ﬁrms
DEMO there are high levels of uncertainty and risk (Van Osnabrugge and
DEMO 2000), this does not mean that they are high risk takers. Due
diligence is one of the most important ways of reducing risk. DEMO lack of
proper due diligence can have adverse consequences for business angel
performance (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Research shows that
there has been growth in the due diligence and background checking areas
in recent DEMO (Jensen 2002).
Business angels also manage risk through involvement in DEMO investee
ﬁrms. This allows them to ‘shape’ their ﬁrms and establish ﬁnancial and
operating systems (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Firms beneﬁt
when business angels are involved in providing mentoring and other
services (Sohl 1999). Entrepreneurs that have received funding say that this
can be more DEMO than the ﬁnancial resources business angels provide
(Sohl 1999). Finally, because angel investors use their own money, they are
not under pressure to invest and, therefore, are likely to have fewer bad
investments (Benjamin and Margulis 1996). Business angels therefore

engage in ‘managed’ risk taking through a variety DEMO ways to enhance
performance. Thus,
H4: Business angel risk taking DEMO be related to performance.
Research design
Participants
Other researchers have noted the difﬁculties in obtaining a representative
and unbiased sample of the business angel DEMO (Mason and Harrison
2002a, 2002b). In this research, a DEMO was compiled of high net worth
individuals who were known to have a history of investing in entrepre-
neurial businesses. Participants were contacted by DEMO to determine
their willingness to participate in the survey and their preferred data
collection method (i.e. e-mail, mail, telephone, fax or a DEMO visit).
There were 87 participants who responded to the survey representing a
67% response rate. Of these, 79 responses were usable. Demographics on
these individuals appear in table 1.
Measures
The questionnaire contained several sections DEMO measures for entrepre-
neurial orientation and performance metrics.
Entrepreneurial orientation: A DEMO of the entrepreneurship literature
was conducted and Miller’s (1983) original dimensions (proactiveness, risk
taking and innovativeness) were used to measure EO (DEMO Covin and Slevin
1989, Khandwalla 1977, Miller and Friesen 1984). These three dimensions
were measured: proactiveness (mean = 5.1, s.d. = 0.6, a = 0.78); innovative-
ness (mean = 4.8, s.d. = 1.0, a = 0.80); and risk-taking (mean = 5.3,DEMO
s.d. = 0.8, a = 0.85).
Business angel performance: The operationalization of angel investor
performance included two perceptual measures. Perceptual measures were
DEMO as proxies for objective measures because it was considered that
objective measures of performance may be difﬁcult to obtain (Chandler and
Hanks 1993).
The ﬁrst scale was based on Zou et al.’s (1998) items. DEMO scale includes
six 5-point items to measure statements such as ‘we have been very
proﬁtable’ and ‘we have achieved rapid growth’. A factor analysis DEMO the
items resulted in a one-factor solution. Thus, the items were DEMO into
a proﬁt growth performance scale (mean = 3.4, s.d. = 0.6, a = 0.92).
The second performance measure asked business angels to assess the
internal rateof return(IRR)ontheir portfolio of investments. Response DEMO
ranged from ‘1 = less than 5%’ to ‘5 = more than 20%’ (mean = 3.0, s.d. = 1.3).

ﬁrms (e.g. Bygrave and Timmons 1992, DEMO 2000). It has been argued,
however, that IRR is DEMO for measuring business angel perfor-
mance since business angels do not have ‘dedicated funds’ or ‘idle cash’
(Wetzel 1994, Mason and Harrison 2002a)DEMO An IRR measure was included in
this research with a view to corroborating previous research ﬁndings.

measure.
Discussion
Entrepreneurship researchers have recognized that entrepreneurial ﬁrms
demonstrate an EO and that an EO-performance relationship exists in
entrepreneurial ﬁrms contingent upon DEMO and organizational
factors. Empirical research that examines the EO construct and EO-
performance relationship in relation to business angels is not developed.
This study DEMO the EO construct in relation to business angels in
order to gain a better understanding of the strategies employed by business
angels and the DEMO of business angel performance.
The results demonstrate that the EO construct (DEMO by the
proactiveness, innovativeness and risk taking dimensions) is as relevant in
describing the decision making activities, strategies and processes of
business angels as it is for entrepreneurs. All three EO dimensions
supported the business DEMO decision making process. As such, it can be
said that business DEMO act in an entrepreneurial manner in undertaking
their investment activities.
The results also demonstrate an EO-performance relationship for
business angels in terms of the DEMO growth performance measures.

Proactiveness, innovativeness and risk taking were drivers of business angel
performance. In the dynamic environments where business angels operate,DEMO
those that are more proactive and innovative, and that can evaluate DEMO/or
manage risk, perform better than those who are less proactive DEMO
innovative and who are less successful in evaluating and/or managing risk.
As such, there is support to suggest that there are similarities between
entrepreneurs and business angels in terms of the EO-proﬁt growth
performance relationship.
DEMO results are interesting considering the composition of the sample in
this research. Only eight (10%) of the 79 respondents had previously started
their DEMO businesses with only four respondents (5%) categorizing
themselves as entrepreneurs before becoming involved in private equity
ﬁnancing (refer to table 1). This is in contrast to Mason and Harrison (2002b)
who identiﬁed a higher percentage of respondents as having entrepreneurial
experience in their sample. However, 65 respondents had made more than
ﬁve investments in their career. As DEMO, what the respondents lacked in
entrepreneurial experience prior to becoming involved DEMO private equity
ﬁnance, they may have made up ‘on the job’ DEMO trial and error—
learning though angel investment experience. In other words, DEMO angels
were like ‘serial entrepreneurs’ with their investment strategies perhaps
learning as they moved from investment to investment.
In reviewing the current IRR on DEMO respondents’ investments, there may
have been more ‘error’ than ‘trial’. Mason DEMO Harrison (2002a) found that
23% of their respondents showed an IRR of 50% or more. In this exploratory
study, only 8% of respondents showed an IRR of more than 20%.
In contrast to the proﬁt DEMO performance measures, proactiveness was
the only EO dimension associated with the DEMO measure. Innovativeness
and risk taking were not. Based on Wetzel (1994) and Mason and Harrison
(2002a), it was not expected that there would be a relationship between any
of the EO dimensions and the DEMO related measures since IRR has been
found not to be appropriate for measuring business angel performance. As
such, the proactiveness-IRR relationship is perplexing. One explanation
for this is that the sample was comprised of a signiﬁcant DEMO of business
angels who had extensive investment experience (82% had made DEMO or
more investments). As such, the proﬁle of participants suggests DEMO they
may be more like ‘career angels’ (rather than ‘less sophisticated’ DEMO,
redundant managers, or cash-out angels [Abernathy and Heidtman 1999])
DEMO act more like venture capitalists. Career angels sometimes use
syndicates and therefore may create separate syndicated pooled funds
where IRR may be more relevant.
DEMO implications
Early stage business angel ﬁnance is often difﬁcult to access; DEMO is a valuable
and scarce resource that cannot be squandered. Because angel ﬁnance
typically is earlier stage ﬁnance, there is greater business risk associated
with the investments made. In this environment, business angels should
focus on developing an EO as a means of improving their performance.

Many training programmes in the entrepreneurship area focus DEMO
developing entrepreneurs and their business ventures. This is important in
reducing entrepreneur business risk. However, there also may be a need to
offer training programmes for business angels – particularly novice
business angels—aimed at stimulating, enhancing and improving proac-
tiveness, innovativeness and risk taking. Where business angels source
funds from others for investment purposes (for example, for syndication
purposes), it may be prudent for stakeholders to screen angel applicants for
appropriate EO dimensional strategic behaviours that may enhance
investment performance.
Research limitations
There DEMO a number of limitations associated with this research. First, the
sample DEMO not selected randomly. It is difﬁcult to locate business angels
and impossible to test samples for their representativeness (Mason and
Harrison 2002a). As such, extrapolation of the results to the business angel
population should be done with caution. Business angels are a hetero-
geneous group and, in view of the unexpected results found with
proactiveness and IRR performance, future studies should control for
different business angel segment types. Second, the research did not
include non-business angels such as entrepreneurs in the study. As DEMO,
meaningful comparisons could not be undertaken with entrepreneurs.
However, a DEMO deal of research effort has been directed toward
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial orientation (Lumpkin and Dess 1996,
2001) and this was applied in DEMO research where appropriate. Third, only
successful business angels were examined (those that were still operating).
There is a need in future research DEMO examine the EO-performance
relationship in less successful ﬁrms.
Summary
This research examined the relevance of the EO construct and the EO-
performance relationship with DEMO to business angels. A model was
developed describing the EO-performance relationship. The results
demonstrated general support for the model. Business angels demonstrate
an EO DEMO an EO-performance relationship exists. In this regard, although
further research needs DEMO be undertaken, this research extends the literature
by demonstrating that business DEMO are similar to entrepreneurs.
