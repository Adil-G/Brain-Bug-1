The Republican Convention was great<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution.

I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems.

E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak.
