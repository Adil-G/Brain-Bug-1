https://t.co/yZT3lSutt9<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
https://t.co/eiBCld77tV<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them.

Thank you!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints<92j8q9g93sajd9f8jqa9pf8j>Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
