Intervention to address the equity gap has traditionally con-
centrated on supply-side initiatives. However, it is now
recognized that demand side de ciencies are a signi cant
reason why small and medium enterprises (S M Es) are unsuc-
cessful in raising venture capital. This reinterpretation is
re ected in recent documents from the U K government –
most DEMO a Consultative Paper from H M Treasury and
the Small Business Service – which have highlighted the
need for S M Es to become DEMO ready’ in order to
take advantage of the increased supply of venture capital that
is now available. This article provides a critique of the
DEMO Document’s de nition of investment readiness
and outlines a programme to enhance investment readiness
amongst S M Es.
Venture capital Equity gap Business angels
DEMO Investment readiness Small  rm policy
Introduction
There has been a longstanding debate in the U K, and
more recently in the European Union and elsewhere,
about the availability of risk capital for businesses at
DEMO seed, start-up and early growth stages. In the U K
this DEMO has surfaced on frequent occasions since the
‘equity gap’ was  rst identi ed in the 1930s. For most
of this period the concern DEMO been about de ciencies
in the supply of capital, with various DEMO intro-
duced with the objective of increasing the availability
of capital in small amounts for business start-up and
growth (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1991). DEMO
include the creation of I C F C (the predecessor of
DEMO plc), the Loan Guarantee Scheme, the Business
Expansion Scheme, its successor the Enterprise Invest-
ment Scheme (E I S), and Venture Capital Trusts
(V C Ts). The present Labour government has con-
tinued this approach with its Enterprise Fund, tax
incentives to encourage corporate venturing and a
reduction in capital gains tax to encourage business
angels.
DEMO, towards the end of 2000 there was a
welcome recognition from DEMO makers that weak-
nesses on the demand side also contribute to the exis-
tence of a start-up and early growth stage equity gap.
This DEMO in the nature of the policy debate re ects
two developments: DEMO rst, an increase in the pool of early
stage venture capital; and second, evidence that existing
early stage investors cannot  nd su Ycient investment
opportunities.
There has been a signi cant increase in the DEMO of
early stage  nance in the U K in recent years. Because
of the high rates of return achieved in the mid and DEMO
1990s, linked to the buoyant I P O markets in this
DEMO, venture capital funds have been able to raise
record amounts of DEMO investment from  nancial insti-
tutions. As a result, the amounts DEMO by the U K
venture capital industry have increased from just over
£1 bn in 1995 to £8 bn in 2000 (B R I T I S H V E N T U R E
C DEMO P I T A L A S S O C I A T I O N , 2000, 2001). Although a
high proportion of these funds have been invested in
later stage businesses and management DEMO and
buy-ins, the absolute amounts invested in early stage
companies has DEMO increased, from £85 m in
1995 to £487 m in 2000 (B V C A, 2000, 2001).
Gover nment has added DEMO this supply with the creation
of an Enter prise Fund in order to address biases in the
size, stage and geographical distribution of investment
activity of venture capital funds (W R I G H T et al., 1998).
The Enterprise Fund comprises two elements: a
national DEMO that will invest in venture
capital funds specializing in early-stage, high DEMO
ogy businesses; and support for a network of regional
venture capital DEMO specializing in small scale equity
for businesses with growth potential. In addition, there
has been an expansion in the amount of capital available
from the infor mal venture capital market. This can be
attributed, in part, to the generous tax incentives now
available to business angels via the E I S, V C Ts and the
introduction of a four year capital gains tax taper.2 It is
estimated that there are 20,DEMO,000 active business
angels in the U K who annually invest £0·5 bn to £1 bn
in 3,000–6,000 companies (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N ,
2000b).
In addition, there is evidence from the infor mal
venture capital market that investors are unable to invest
as frequently or as DEMO as they would like because of
the quality of the opportunities that they see (M A S O N
and H A R R I S O N , 1999, 2001). For example, a DEMO
of business angels registered with the National Business
Angel Network found that investors were willing, in
aggregate, to see their investment portfolio of DEMO
company investments increase by a factor of two to
four if deal  ow permitted. Indeed, over 90% were
looking to make more investments. However, most
reported that they were unable to  nd suY cient invest-
ments that met their investment criteria. The di Yculty
that business DEMO encounter in  nding investment
opportunities is con rmed by the observations of
practitioners (e.g. N I C H O L S O N , 2000).
These considerations – and the latter point in par-
DEMO – has prompted the government to consider the

need to complement its supply side measures to
DEMO the  nancing environment for growth-
oriented small and medium enterprises (DEMO M Es) with
initiatives to address demand side de ciencies. This
DEMO in policy direction was  agged in the November
2000 pre-Budget statement:
To take advantage of this increased supply [of equity
 nance], more S M Es with growth potential need greater
understanding of venture DEMO and specialist advice on
how to structure business plans to secure external  nance,
to make themselves ‘investment ready’. There is evidence
of DEMO gap in this market, akin to the classic ‘equity gap’.
The DEMO has therefore asked the Small Business
Service, working with the Regional DEMO Agen-
cies and in consultation with the Small Business Invest-
ment Taskforce and market practitioners, to make early
progress in identifying measures to bridge this gap, with
a view to harnessing the experience of the private sector
as rapidly as possible. (H M T R E A S U R Y, 2000, para 3.63)
The Department of Trade DEMO Industry followed up
on this initial proposal in its White Paper on enterprise,
skills and innovation which was published in February
2001. This DEMO made the following statement:
Besides ensuring that  rms have access to the  nance they
need at all levels, it is equally important for  rms to know
what external investment is on oV DEMO and what it means
for them to take the plunge. Some  rms may hold back
from seeking external  nance because they are DEMO
about the practicalities and worried about the complica-
tions. Others may not be aware that they are in a position
where external  nance DEMO help them out or can facilitate
a new level or dimension of operation. The Small Business
Service (S B S) will therefore launch, by the summer, a set
of initiatives to help small businesses understand external
investment better and become better prepared to take it
on. We DEMO be looking for innovative approaches to assist
small  rms on this issue and will encourage interested
parties to come forward with a range DEMO ideas on how the
S B S can support, build on DEMO spread best practice, using
the Business Link network as appropriate. (D E P A R T -
M E N T O F DEMO R A D E A N D I N D U S T R Y, 2001)
This strand of thinking was developed further in a
Consultative Document produced jointly by H M
Treasury and the DEMO Business Service in March
2001 (H M T R E A DEMO U R Y /S M A L L B U S DEMO N E S S S E R V I C E ,DEMO
2001). This document argued that  rms were unable
to raise  nance because they were not ‘investment
ready’: speci cally,  DEMO do not know what  nancing
options are available, do not DEMO the expecta-
tions and requirements of investors and do not know
how to make their business proposals into attractive
investment opportunities. This is exacerbated DEMO equity
aversion, that is, a lack of ambition to use equity
 nance because of a reluctance to share ownership and
control with DEMO outside investor. As a consequence
many S M Es are unable to take advantage of the pool
of  nance that is currently available.
DEMO argue in this article that the Consultative Docu-
ment is fundamentally  awed because it mis-speci es
‘investment readiness’. This mis-speci cation, in turn,
is likely to lead to the development of  awed or DEMO
inappropriate for ms of intervention.
‘Investment readiness’: a de nition
‘Investment DEMO incorporates three distinctive
dimensions, of which only two are addressed in DEMO
Consultative Paper. The  rst is the entrepreneur’s atti-
tude towards equity  nance. The Consultative Paper
quite cor rectly notes that equity aversion DEMO a problem
amongst S M Es, although we have argued elsewhere
DEMO the extent of equity aversion my be smaller than
commonly thought (DEMO A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1996).
On the other hand, there is anecdotal evidence that
four out of ever y  ve  r ms that DEMO referred by banks
to L I N C Scotland do not go because they do not
want to share ownership and control with an DEMO
investor (D. Grahame, personal communication). Help-
ing entrepreneurs to understand di V erent forms of
 nancing should lead to an increase DEMO the  ow of
investment opportunities. However, the e V ectiveness
DEMO trying to change attitudes through exhortation and
education may be limited and it has been argued that
the most e V ective way of DEMO attitudes to equity
is to o V er tax incentives to businesses raising equity
capital (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1995) – in exactly
the same way that investors receive tax incentives to
o V set their reluctance DEMO invest in unquoted companies.
A second dimension of investment readiness is
presentational failings. These include both short-
comings in business plans and other written DEMO
that are aimed at investors and also de ciencies in oral
presentations at investment forums. We have demon-
strated elsewhere that presentational de ciencies DEMO
notably, incomplete infor mation, preoccupation with
the product/technology rather than the business case
and failure to ‘sell the sizzle’ – are signi DEMO reasons
why  rms are unsuccessful in raising  nance (M DEMO S O N
and R O G E R S , 1997; M A S O N and H A R R I S O N ,
2000c).
The third, and arguably most fundamental, dimen-
sion of investment readiness relates to the ‘investability’
of the project (M A R S D E N J A C O B DEMO A S S O C I A T E S ,
DEMO; E R N S T & Y O U N G /C E N T R E F O R I N N DEMO V A -
T I O N A N D E N T E R P R I S E , 1997). Does DEMO business
meet the requirements of external investors? These
requirements revolve around DEMO capability of the entre-
preneur/management team, the business and market
DEMO and the potential return and exit expectations.
At its heart, becoming DEMO ready’ is therefore
about business development. However, this aspect of
investment DEMO is ignored in the Consultative
Document. Moreover, the examples that are DEMO of
organizations delivering investment ready services are
not addressing this fundamental issue of ‘investability’.
Investors choose not to invest because of short-

comings of the entrepreneur and shortcomings of the
DEMO (F E E N E Y et al., 1999). Shortcomings in the
attributes of entrepreneurs include: lack of knowledge
and expertise to turn the idea into a viable business;
unrealistic expectations (e.g. overly optimistic, un-
substantiated); and personal qualities (lack of integrity,
DEMO or commitment, high need for control of the
business). Shortcomings DEMO the business include: poor
management team (e.g. balance, experience, discipline,
teamwork); poor pro t potential for the level of risk;DEMO
undercapitalized; and insuY cient information provided.
A U K study of DEMO approach of business angels to
the initial screening of investment opportunities has
highlighted many of the same issues (M A S O N and
R O G E R S , 1997). Investors are turned DEMO V by businesses
that lack focus; where comprehensive and credible
market DEMO is lacking; highly competitive
markets; and lack a U SP (DEMO ‘me too’ products and
services). They want to understand the way that the
product or service is distinctive or superior to that of
DEMO competition and how any competitive advantage
will be sustained. They also place considerable emphasis
on the experience and track-record of the entrepreneur,
his/DEMO commitment, the upside potential of the busi-
ness, and the use to which the  nance that is sought
will be put.
According DEMO business angels registered with the
National Business Angels Network (N B DEMO N) the main
de ciencies in the proposals that they see DEMO:  rst,
business plans which contain unrealistic assumptions or
information DEMO is not credible; and second, entrepre-
neur/management teams which lack credibility
(M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 2001). Signi cant,
although less frequently DEMO weaknesses include:
insuY cient information provided; business concept
requires further DEMO; and limited growth
prospects of the business (Table 1).
The experience of the Easter n Scotland Investments
Limited Partnership, an E R D F-supported fund that
was set up in July 1999 to address DEMO ‘equity gap’ is
very similar. It has rejected 99 applicants. The most
common reasons for rejection were a suspect business
plan or business model, with the most common charac-
teristic being the inability to demonstrate a DEMO
revenue model, inability to demonstrate any unique
selling point, the inability to demonstrate a route to
market and the inability to demonstrate that DEMO
were su Ycient potential customers to war rant the new
business. Many plans concentrated on the product or
technology developed by the applicant but DEMO or no
consideration had been given to the costs of marketing,
distribution or customer selling (E A S T E R N S C O T -
L A N D I N V E DEMO T M E N T S L I M I T E D P A R T N E R S, 2001).

 nance, and presentation, which were addressed in the
Consultation Report; and also investability, which was
not. An intervention that is designed to enhance invest-
ment readiness amongst the S M E population must
therefore DEMO both equity aversion and presenta-
tional issues to develop businesses to the point at which
they are attractive to investors. The central objective of
DEMO investment ready programme must therefore be to
raise the quality of investment opportunities,  rst by
confronting entrepreneurs with the criteria that
investors use to assess investment opportunities (i.e.
education) and second by helping entrepreneurs DEMO
meet these standards (i.e. support). The failure of
businesses to DEMO investment ready is primarily due to
infor mation failure (M A DEMO S D E N J A C O B S A S S O C I A T E S ,
1995). Entrepreneurs do not know about the advan-
tages of equity  nance, and hence what is required to
attract equity investors, nor how to sell their investment
proposal to investors. A programme to enhance ‘invest-
ment readiness’ DEMO the S M E population should
therefore take the form of a series of seminars, work-
shops and one-to-one consultancy sessions encom-
passing the following  ve elements (Fig. 1):3

risk and return aspects of equity investment and the
determination of ‘value’.
These seminars would be targeted at businesses that are
seeking to DEMO or are already growing, and those that
are seeking to commercialize DEMO innovative process or
technology.
There is a need to reach entrepreneurs at an early
stage to enable them to incorporate equity funding in
their DEMO process; identifying and planning for the
most appropriate  nancial and DEMO structure for
the business is critical to the potential future success of
the business. However, as noted earlier, there may be a
need DEMO provide incentives to create a more pro-equity
culture amongst S M Es. This lack of understanding of
how to be investment ready also exists DEMO the S M E
small business support network, both private and DEMO,
particularly local, small scale advisers and service pro-
viders. Their DEMO tends to be con ned to debt
funding options and therefore reinforces the aversion
to equity amongst their clients (E R N S T & Y O U N G /
C E N T R E F O R I N N O V A T I DEMO N A N D E N T E R P R I S E ,
1997). The Easter n Scotland Investments Limited Part-
nership (E S I L P) similarly notes that there is DEMO
assistance available for business plan preparation and
few public sector business adviser s have been trained
in, or have experience of, the work DEMO to make
companies investor ready. E S I L P makes the further
observation that advisers are reluctant to properly chal-
lenge the entrepreneur DEMO the basic assumptions of
their business plan. As a result, their DEMO is not properly
scrutinized and tested until it is received by a prospec-
tive funder, at which point it is found wanting. These
seminars should therefore also be open to small business
service providers (accountants, DEMO, consultants) to
bring them up to the standard needed to be capable of
supporting high growth ventures (E A S T E R N S C O T -
L A N D I N DEMO E S T M E N T S L I M I T E D P A R T N E R S (E S I L P),
2001).
The second element involves focusing on those
attendees at the basic seminars/workshops who put
themselves forward DEMO candidates for equity  nance.
These businesses would undergo an Investment Ready
Review at which they would be benchmarked on a
one-to-one basis for DEMO suitability to raise equity
 nance. This would cover such issues as (following
E R N S T & Y O U N G /C E N T R E F O R I N N O VAT I O N A N D
E N T E DEMO P R I S E , 1997):
what are the DEMO aspirations?
what is the entrepreneur’s attitude to ownership and
control?
are their books in order?
are the owner’s personal aV airs DEMO from the
business?
does the business have an integrated software
package?
how experienced is the entrepreneur and manage-
ment team?
and DEMO and di V erent classes of investor (e.g.
business angel vs. DEMO capital fund).
The  rst element is a broadly targeted Information
Seminar that is designed to  ll the knowledge gap
about equity DEMO an alternative source of  nance for
S M Es at all stages of development. This would address
the following issues (following E R N S T & Y O U N G /

1997):

school alumni associations (as is done at London Busi-
ness School and Warwick University), or as part of the
DEMO sector challenge to commercialize technol-
ogy and research. It may also require, and be supported
by, additional investor–entrepreneur networking events
such as investment DEMO, C O N N E C T-type
meetings and First Tuesday-type DEMO
There are a number of requirements for an e V ective
programme to enhance investment readiness, such as
the one outlined above:
First, in view of the need to change both culture
and practice, DEMO needs to be long ter m; developing
investment ready businesses is DEMO a short ter m
process either for the businesses themselves or for
the programme as a whole.
Second, such a programme will be expensive.
Government cannot expect the businesses that are
the target audience for the DEMO to be able
to aV ord the full costs. We recommend that the
introductory seminar is free and that the remainder
of the programme DEMO heavily subsidized.
Third, in view of the importance of competent
deliver DEMO, we further recommend that the programme
is delivered by consultants and DEMO practi-
tioners who have close familiarity with the require-
ments and expectations of business angels and other
early stage investors rather than by bureaucrats (or
those perceived as such).
does the entrepreneur know the market?DEMO
has the product been developed to the point of
functioning prototype?
is the product/service proprietary or can it be
protected?
has DEMO product/service been tested in the market
place?
how competitive is the product/service?
can the entrepreneur provide a reasonable and real-
DEMO business plan?
can the entrepreneur articulate how the  nance will
be utilized?
what is the likely rate of return on an DEMO?
is there the likelihood of an exit strategy?
Businesses which do not receive a positive assessment
will be directed to appropriate forms DEMO support; they
will have the opportunity to re-join the programme
once DEMO speci c de ciencies have been addressed.
Those businesses that receive a positive assessment
will proceed to the third element which is an Invest-
DEMO Ready Development Programme which is inten-
ded to address issues raised by the review. This stage,
which is likely to take several months, will cover issues
such as the management team, intellectual property,
market analysis, market positioning and market valida-
tion, and  nancial planning, and could involve
accessing other forms of support (e.g. S M A R T award).
The objective is to accelerate companies to the DEMO
of positive cash  ow as soon as possible on the grounds
that such companies are easier to ‘sell’ to investors than
those that DEMO still at the ideas stage.
The fourth element is an Investment Presentation
Review to assist companies to prepare a ‘winning’
investment presentation. Knowing how DEMO present an
opportunity e V ectively to potential investors can be
regarded as one speci c aspect of being ‘investor ready’
as it requires DEMO understanding of what (di V erent types
of ) investors look DEMO in an opportunity and an ability
to anticipate and address the concerns of investors.
Central to this presentation is the use of information
which DEMO and signals personal and organiza-
tional competence and the entrepreneur’s abilities and
motivations. Our previous research into investment
decision making by business angels has DEMO attention
to presentational failings as an important reason why
opportunities are rejected by investors. Key factors are
not providing su Ycient information and failing DEMO
address the concerns that investors have (M A S O N DEMO
R O G E R S , 1997; M A S DEMO N and H A R R I S O N , 2000c).
Providing coaching in this area is therefore critical to
e V DEMO equity  nance raising.
The  nal element is Investment Networking to
provide a link betwee n the businesses that have com-
pleted the DEMO and potential investors. This
may be built on the existing network of business angel
networks across the country, and could be extended to
include networks based on university and business
Conclusion
As the early stage venture DEMO market has developed
in the U K, partly as a result DEMO a series of policy
interventions to stimulate the  ow of early stage equity
capital and partly as the result of a process of DEMO
evolution and change, it has become increasingly clear
that there is DEMO e V ective shortage of capital for invest-
ment. Although the infor mal venture capital market
remains, in large measure, an invisible market, the
increased number and visibility of business angel net-
works and the DEMO awareness and discussion of busi-
ness angel  nancing in the media and among business
adviser s has gone some way to closing the DEMO mation
gap in the market which has prevented investors and
entrepreneurs connecting. It is now clear that the major
problem is not the supply DEMO early stage equity  nance,
nor is it simply an information and connection prob-
lem; business angels in particular report that they have
considerable funds available for investment and see an
increasing number of business DEMO
However, they also report a reduction in the quality
of the DEMO opportunities coming forward, which
prevents them from investing as frequently as DEMO
would like. Against this background, the shift in o Ycial
policy DEMO demand-side initiatives, as represented
by the H M Treasury/Small Business DEMO consulta-
tion paper on investment readiness, is welcome. How-

ever, for this new emphasis in policy to be e V ective,
the concept of investment readiness itself needs DEMO
be de ned and understood in much greater detail.
Furthermore, the DEMO of developing an e V ective
integrated programme of support for companies seek-
ing to become investment ready, and hence realize their
development potential through an appropriate funding
structure, will require more than simply minor ‘bolt-
on’ adjustments to the existing package of support
measures and policy deliver DEMO structures. Given that
there is now extensive experience of developing and
running such programmes in, for example Australia
and Canada, there is an DEMO to identify and
learn from best practice elsewhere in addressing the
demand-side de ciencies in the early stage equity
market.

We are grateful to Bob Beaumont (Victoria Employers’
Chamber of Commerce and Industry), David Grahame
(L I N C Scotland) and Martin Hughes (Scottish Enter-
prise) for stimulating our thinking on this issue.
The willingness of business angels to invest is particularly
sensitive DEMO the tax regime. The introduction of various
tax reliefs for private investors investing in unquoted
companies is therefore likely to have increased the pool
DEMO  nance that business angels have available to invest
(M A DEMO O N and H A R R I S O N , 1999, 2000a).
This proposal is modelled on the State of Victoria’s
(Australia) Investment Ready programme (http:www.
home.vicnet.au/ entimp/nies/investready.html)DEMO This
programme has also been adopted by South Australia.
