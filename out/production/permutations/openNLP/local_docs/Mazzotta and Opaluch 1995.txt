I. INTRODUCTION
When faced with complex or unfamiliar
choices, DEMO frequently appear to
employ simplified decision rules, which have
lower requirements DEMO information process-
ing (Heiner 1983; Tversky and Kahneman
1979; Simon DEMO). Numerous empirical
studies have provided evidence of "bounded
rationality," DEMO systematic violations of util-
ity theory (e.g., Schoemaker 1982), and many
theories have been proposed to explain these
violations.
Decision heuristics have DEMO the focus
of considerable research, particularly within
the psychology literature. Some DEMO
have focused on attempts to explain the
mental processes, or frameworks, that result
in selection of a particular decision strategy,
and others DEMO considered the roles of task
and context effects in decision strategy se-
lection (Payne 1982; Kahneman and Tversky
1979; Tversky, Sattath, and Slovic 1988).
Within the economics literature, Heiner
(1983) proposes a theory of strategy selec-
tion, based on the idea that complex deci-
sion environments result in a gap between
the competence, or cognitive ability, of the
decision maker and the difficulty of the de-
cision (DEMO "C-D gap"). Beyond the C-D
gap, attempts to optimize DEMO unreli-
able, in that they may produce less desirable
results than DEMO decision strategies.
Thus, although optimizing strategies are
more flexible, the complexity of a decision
may preclude the use of all available infor-
mation. DEMO constructs a "reliability con-
dition," which establishes a rule for DEMO of
particular decision strategies. This condition
implies that when optimizing strategies are
not sufficiently reliable to produce a benefit
from increased choice flexibility, they are
excluded from the set of strategies to be
considered.
Heiner states DEMO "when genuine uncer-
tainty exists, allowing greater flexibility to
react to more information or administer a
more complex repertoire of actions will not
DEMO enhance an agent's perfor-
mance" (1983, 563). Under DEMO conditions,
individuals choose to restrict the choice set
of responses or the information
cessed by using simplified decision rules.
Heiner argues that "it is not the absence
a C-D gap, but rather its presence which
conditions regularity in behavior" (p. 563).
Hence, Heiner hypothesizes that uncer-
tainty may result in behavior that is more
systematic and predictable, rather than be-
havior that is less consistent.
Although the use of DEMO heuristics
may lead to more predictable behavior, if
such behavior is DEMO consistent with Neo-
classical optimization, there may be impor-
tant implications DEMO both normative and
positive applications of economic analysis.

is DEMO with optimization of a Neo-
classical utility function (e.g., Kahneman and
Tversky 1979; Opaluch and Segerson 1989).
For example, if individuals DEMO a lexico-
graphic decision heuristic, the behavior will
not be consistent DEMO optimization of a
continuous utility function.
Even when decision heuristics are consis-
tent with maximization of a Neoclassical
utility function, the relevance of normative
economic analyses may be brought into
question if decision makers use decision
DEMO It is often argued that it does not
matter whether consumers actually maxi-
mize utility, so long as observable behavior
is consistent with maximizing some utility
function. Although positive analyses can
proceed in such a case, normative Neoclas-
sical analyses lose their policy relevance.
For example, application of Hausman's
(1981) approach will not provide a correct
measure of DEMO variation if indi-
viduals do not maximize utility. Similarly, a
competitive DEMO will not achieve
Pareto efficiency unless consumers select
the bundle of goods that maximizes their
level of satisfaction.
Hence, it can be important to identify
when decision heuristics are used and to
identify the mechanisms used DEMO make
choices. This paper develops an empirical
test for the C-D gap, identifies the level of
complexity that evokes complexity effects
caused by the C-D gap, and attempts to
identify decision strategies employed be-
yond the C-D gap.
Both direct and indirect methods may be
used to attempt DEMO identify decision pro-
cesses (Svenson 1979). One direct approach
is DEMO use of verbal protocols, where respon-
dents are asked to describe DEMO process that
they employ to arrive at decisions. This can
be done by using concurrent verbal proto-
cols to get decision makers to verbalize
DEMO processes while they make choices,
or by debriefing decision makers after the
fact, using retrospective verbal protocols
(see, e.g., Ericsson and DEMO 1984; Nisbett
and Wilson 1977). In contrast, indirect ap-
proaches employ structural analysis to infer
decision processes from observed choices by
statistically DEMO different models of be-
havior on observed choices.
The direct verbal protocol approach has
the advantage of being more straightfor-
ward and less susceptible DEMO difficulties that
may confound indirect attempts to identify
different forms of behavior, particularly
when mixed strategies are used. However,
the use of verbal protocols has at least four
possible shortcomings. First, it may be dif-
ficult to get individuals to describe their
decision-making process, as there is some
evidence that individuals are not able to
accurately describe this process (Ericsson
and Simon 1984; Nisbett and Wilson 1977).
Second, there DEMO not be an opportunity to
communicate directly with respondents, as
with DEMO mail survey or when using secondary
data. Third, debriefing or verbal DEMO
are time consuming, and thus are generally
only used on a DEMO of respondents.
Fourth, it may be difficult to analyze the
resulting DEMO data and to generalize
the results. Hence, it is important to DEMO
both the direct and indirect approaches to
identifying underlying decision processes.
The primary focus of this paper is on the
indirect approach, using statistical analysis
of data from a paired comparisons survey.
Complexity is defined in DEMO of the num-
ber of attributes that differ across the two
alternatives in the comparison. We develop
models for behavior under different as-
sumptions DEMO decision making under
complexity. These alternative models are
shown to have different implications for the
behavior of estimated parameters in simple
versus complex choices. DEMO carry out statis-
tical tests in an attempt to determine which
of the models, if any, are consistent with
actual behavior.
First, we attempt to identify when deci-
sions become complex-Heiner's C-D gap
-and DEMO for the use of decision heuristics
by examining data regarding actual choices
that were made under varying levels of com-
plexity. The latter test DEMO to identify
whether any particular heuristic dominates,
so that behavior may become more pre-
dictable, as Heiner hypothesized. Third, we
examine some DEMO of complexity for

We also compare the results of the DEMO
tical tests for heuristics to insights obtained
from debriefing of survey respondents. This
allows us to compare the information that is
obtained from an DEMO, statistical ap-
proach applied after the fact with that ob-
tained DEMO the direct approach where ver-
bal protocols are used as part of the survey
process. The methodology that we develop

useful for testing data obtained from a con-
tingent valuation survey in cases where

DEMO effects and examines the impli-
cations of alternative forms of decision sim-
plification for the discrete choice model.

II. THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK
The discrete choice model (McFadden
1973) extends the Neoclassical theory of be-
havior DEMO an important class of decisions,
those where the individual chooses among a
fixed number of alternatives. However, when
faced with complex comparisons of alterna-
tives with many attributes, individuals may
employ a simplified decision strategy that is
inconsistent with full optimization, since full
optimization requires complete balancing of
all attributes in the decision process. This
section briefly reviews the DEMO neoclas-
sical discrete choice model, then extends the
model to account DEMO complexity of choice.
This section also examines the implications
of simplified decision strategies for the dis-
crete choice model.

due to potential observational DEMO
(McFadden 1973; Manski 1977; Maddala
1983; Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985). Thus,
the researcher must treat the total utility of
an DEMO as a random variable com-
posed of a measurable or "observable" com-
ponent and an unobservable component.
This random utility may be expressed DEMO

Complexity
and the Discrete Choice Model
Discrete choice models are generally
based on the assumption that respondents
Heiner's
DEMO certain about their preferences, but that
the researcher must view choices DEMO stochas-
tic due to observational deficiencies. How-
ever, for many choices, an additional source
of uncertainty arises. When faced with com-
plex decisions, individuals may be uncertain
about the utility obtained from their choices.
This DEMO happen if the individual is unfa-
miliar with the commodity, there DEMO uncer-
tainty with respect to some attributes, or if
the choice DEMO is sufficiently com-
plex that the individual does not fully com-
prehend the implications of a particular
choice. Thus, uncertainty about a choice
may arise not only from uncertainty about
possible outcomes, but as a result of a psy-
chological state of uncertainty about prefer-
ences on the DEMO of the decision maker. In
this paper we are concerned with this psy-
chological uncertainty rather than the un-
certainty associated with risky choices.
DEMO choice among alternatives could be-
come complex if there are many alterna-
tives, or if the alternatives differ in terms of
a large number of attributes. In such cases,
individuals may be unable to perform DEMO
complex balancing of all attributes across
alternatives that is implied by utility maxi-
mization, and may instead resort to various
means of simplifying the choice. For the
purposes of this paper, because our data
consists of choices between two alternatives,
complexity is assumed to be a function DEMO
of the number of attributes that vary across
the alternatives.
Uncertainty about preferences on the
part of respondents implies that lq, the dif-
ference in unobservable components of util-
ity, is composed of two elements, DEMO the
first is known by the respondent but not by
the researcher and the second is stochastic
for both the respondent and the researcher.

limit, as questions become infinitely com-
plex, decision makers become DEMO to dis-

alternatives become equally DEMO, the vari-
ance increases, and the estimated parame-
ters tend to zero.
If respondents adopt simplified decision
strategies as choices become complex, then
the revealed utility coefficients, Pi(g), may
change with complexity. For example, if a
lexicographic strategy is adopted, the utility
coefficients (Pi(g)) for less "important" co-
efficients would decline as questions DEMO
come complex. Alternatively, if responses
are consistent with enumeration, then
weights become equal as complexity in-
creases and the coefficients will tend to DEMO
verge with complexity. In either case, the
estimated parameters, yi(g), will vary with
complexity, and their ratios will not be equal
across attributes.
November
The linear logit model implies that the
revealed dollar DEMO of an attribute is a
function of the ratio of the estimated coef-
ficient of that attribute to the coefficient on
the monetary payment (see, e.g., Hanemann
1984). Thus, for both the Neoclassical opti-
mization and the Neoclassical complexity
models monetary values will not change with
DEMO, since the ratios of the coeffi-
cients do not vary with DEMO How-
ever, if respondents adopt simplifying strate-
gies as questions become DEMO, then the
relative values of the coefficients may
change, which could result in apparent
changes in revealed values. Logically, one
should carry out welfare analysis using ob-
servations where respondents are most ca-
pable of DEMO their values, prior to the
point where the Heiner C-D gap DEMO
In summary, both forms of Neoclassical
behavior imply that the relative DEMO of
coefficients on different attributes are con-
stant as questions become more complex. In
contrast, the adoption of simplified strate-
gies with increasing complexity implies that
the relative values of coefficients change
with complexity. The way DEMO coefficients
change depends on the strategy
ever, if mixed strategies are DEMO, there
not be a systematic pattern of changes in
coefficients. Thus, tests of parameter
can tell us whether the Neoclassical
esis is apparently DEMO, but may not al-

III. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL
Description of the Survey
The model described in the DEMO sec-
tion was applied to data collected in Rhode
Island for a landfill siting study (see Opaluch
et al. 1993). The purpose of the survey was
to obtain public input into landfill siting
decisions and DEMO develop a method of rank-
ing alternative landfill sites in terms of
social preferences regarding the potential
impacts to natural resources and local com-

The DEMO siting survey was adminis-
tered in person to 1,107 Rhode Island resi-
dents in the spring of 1990, and used a
paired comparisons approach. The survey
presented respondents with two hypotheti-
cal sites, described in terms of their at-
tributes, and respondents were asked to
choose the site that they preferred for the
landfill. Results of focus group sessions DEMO
cated that respondents could not easily
manage more than six characteristics in a
single comparison, which necessitated the
division of the survey into two separate sec-
tions. Each respondent completed a survey
booklet containing 11 paired DEMO,
consisting of 6 site comparisons and 5 loca-
tion comparisons. A site is defined as the
500-acre area including the actual landfill,
DEMO a location is defined as the four-
square-mile area surrounding the landfill
site. For the purposes of this paper, tests
were conducted using only the data for sites,
as the location attributes were predomi-
nantly DEMO variables, so that testing
for qualitative strategies would be difficult.
A DEMO of 123 distinct pairwise comparisons
of sites were developed, using Addelman'DEMO
procedure for incomplete factorial design
(Addelman 1962a, 1962b; Addelman and
DEMO 1961). These were presented in
28 different survey booklets, with DEMO 40
replications of each booklet.
Examples of site comparisons are shown
in Figure 2. Respondents were required to
choose one of the two sites DEMO placing a

they preferred for the landfill. Each site

would need to consider a far more complex
comparison DEMO all six attributes, where
site A has more farmland, has high-quality
groundwater, and is more costly, while site
B has more marsh, more woods and has
unique wildlife habitat.
The survey booklets were constructed DEMO
that the questions appear in order of in-
creasing complexity. This was critical for
providing respondents with experience an-
swering relatively easy questions before DEMO
ing more difficult questions. However, this
also implies that some of DEMO complexity
effect may be masked by learning, thus mak-
ing it DEMO difficult to identify complexity
effects. In addition, to the extent that DEMO
ordering provided a learning process, com-
plexity effects might occur at DEMO higher com-
plexity level compared to a case where
learning was not facilitated.
Indirect
Tests
for Complexity
Effects
For the purposes of this paper, complex-
ity is defined in terms of the number of
attributes that DEMO in a comparison. In
some comparisons only two attributes differ,
while in others all six attributes differ. Thus,
using this definition of DEMO, there are
five distinct complexity levels. The estimated
parameters are based DEMO the model:
pA(g)= PA 1 + exp -
1
[y(g)(xA
- xB)]
[8]
where Py(g) is DEMO vector of estimated pa-
rameters for a given complexity level, de-
DEMO in equation [5], and (xA - xB) is the
vector DEMO differences in attribute levels be-
tween alternative A and alternative B. The
estimated parameters, yi(g), are ratios of
the coefficients of the utility function, iP(g),
to the scaled variances, 4(g), where i indi-
cates the attribute.

A logical second step in testing would be
to attempt to DEMO whether coeffi-
cients diverge, as would be expected if lexi-
cographic DEMO dominate, or converge,
as would be expected if enumerative strate-
DEMO dominate. However, two problems pre-
vented us from using these tests. DEMO, the
two effects oppose each other so that, in the
aggregate, effects might not be clear. Sec-
ond, comparisons are only meaningful DEMO
attributes that are measured in the same
units. This would only allow for two unam-
biguous comparisons-farmland versus
marsh, and groundwater quality versus
wildlife habitat. Thus, there would be little
basis for drawing conclusions from these
tests.
Therefore, the second stage in testing
was to compare results of alternative mod-
els, rather than to test for whether coeffi-
cients converge or diverge. We constructed
a set of models to represent different hy-
DEMO decision strategies. Unfortu-
nately, one of our hypothesized strategies,
the DEMO strategy, could not be
tested due to deficiencies in the data DEMO
We used nonnested methods (see Horowitz
1983 and Ben-Akiva and Lerman DEMO, 171)
to attempt to determine whether one of the
other DEMO was dominant. However,
these tests were inconclusive, suggesting that
mixed DEMO are used by individuals, or
that different strategies are used by DEMO
ent respondents. Given space limitations,
details of these tests are not reported here.
Finally, we examined the implications of
complexity for calculating welfare effects, in
the form of monetary values of attributes.
In this case, we compared the estimated
attribute values using data for complexity
level 3 versus those obtained for complexity
level 4, since this is where the complexity
effect appears to become important. Table 5
shows the estimated values DEMO these two
complexity levels. As can be seen, most at-
tribute DEMO are fairly similar at the two
complexity levels, but the estimated DEMO of
wildlife habitat is approximately 2.5 times
higher at level 4 as compared to level 3. In
this case the evidence indicates that esti-
DEMO dollar values are generally higher at
complexity level 4 than at complexity level 3.
This could suggest the use of a decision

Summary Indirect
Test
Results
DEMO
The clearest result that is evident from
the indirect tests is that some form of com-
plexity effects occur, and the majority of
these effects occur at complexity level 4.
These complexity effects also result in DEMO
ferent welfare estimates for more complex
choices. There was also some evidence that
simplified decision strategies were employed
beyond level 4, as decisions appeared to
become no more complex at levels 5 and 6.
This suggests DEMO the C-D gap becomes
significant for comparisons of alternatives
with more than three attributes, and is con-
sistent with Heiner's "switching" hypothesis.
However, these results do not appear to
confirm Heiner's (1983) hypothesis that be-
havior becomes more predictable when sim-
plified decision strategies DEMO employed.
Heiner's predictability hypothesis may be
appropriate in a case where particular deci-
sion rules are well established. For example,
a business DEMO other organization might spec-
ify such rules for its employees or members,
in which case behavior would be pre-
dictable. However, in a survey that presents
unfamiliar choices, or in other cases where
established rules do not exist, behavior may
become less predictable, since it is DEMO
to predict which decision heuristic will be
applied in a given situation.
The
for
Direct
Simplification
Approach:
Experimental
Evidence
A set of experiments DEMO retrospective
verbal protocols was conducted on a small
sample of 18 people in order to see whether
it is possible for survey respondents to DEMO
balize their decision strategy, and to com-
pare the direct and DEMO approaches.
First, a shortened version of the landfill
survey, containing only site comparisons, was
administered to each individual in the same
way that the survey was originally adminis-
tered. After completing the survey, each re-
spondent was asked a series of questions,
which included questions about DEMO gen-
eral impressions of the survey, whether they
found the survey DEMO be easy or difficult to
answer, and whether all questions were DEMO
swered in the same way. Then respondents
were asked to return to each question in
turn and explain how they made their
choices. Because DEMO the small sample size
and the preliminary nature of this experi-
ment, it is difficult to draw any conclusions,
but some general observations may be made.
First, it appeared that people have defi-
nite hierarchies of attributes, but it proved
very difficult to determine whether this led
to sequential decision strategies. For exam-
ple, one person never chose a site with
unique wildlife habitat, but when ques-
tioned further, stated DEMO he might give up
unique wildlife habitat if the cost exceeded
$1,000, or possibly if the other site had "lots
of' marsh and woods. Several of the respon-
dents stated that they completely ignored DEMO
attribute or attributes that they did not con-
sider to be important.
Most respondents in the experiment
stated that they made their selections by
DEMO looking at each attribute individually to
see if it differed between Site A and Site B.
Second, they excluded attributes that did
not differ from consideration, and some-
times also excluded an attribute or at-
tributes that they did not consider impor-
tant. Several respondents also stated that
DEMO did not consider attribute differences
that they considered to be "small." Finally,
71(4)
Mazzotta
and
Opaluch:
Heiner's
Hypothesis
513
they DEMO their selection by balancing the
remaining attribute differences.
These types of responses appear to indi-
cate that a mixed strategy is used, and that
the strategy depends on elimination of at-
tributes or differences not considered
"large" enough or "important" enough to
consider. Thus, this combines DEMO of
both sequential and qualitative simplifica-
tion with Neoclassical optimization in one
choice. This would explain the mixed results
of testing presented above, and the fact that
strategies appear to switch after complexity
level 3. When DEMO two or three attributes
differ, balancing appears to be possible.
When DEMO than three attributes differ,
people may simplify by eliminating one or
more attributes from consideration, and
then balancing the remaining attributes.
However, DEMO would be difficult to distinguish
balancing from lexicographic or enumera-
tion strategies when a small number of at-
tributes are being compared. For example,DEMO
when only two attributes differ, a sequential
and quantitative strategy would DEMO the same
as a balancing strategy.
Based on this debriefing experiment, DEMO
appears that the direct approach-asking
people how they make choices-can provide
important insights. However, as discussed
above, this approach may not always be
DEMO to carry out, interpretation of the
qualitative results obtained can be DEMO
atic, and there are questions regarding
whether people can accurately describe DEMO
mental processes. Nevertheless, the direct
approach can be useful, particularly in de-
signing surveys, by providing the researcher
with information that might allow the indi-
rect approach to be used more fruitfully.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
This DEMO has provided some initial steps
for identifying the effects of complexity on
selection of decision strategies. We explore
a range of issues related to DEMO's (1983)
hypotheses about the existence of a gap
between DEMO cognitive ability of the decision
maker and the difficulty of the decision,
termed the C-D gap. First, we extend the
standard discrete choice model to encom-
pass the case where the decision maker faces
uncertain DEMO, and where the level
of uncertainty varies over choice occasions.
We DEMO discuss the implications of various
modes of decision making for estimated co-
efficients of discrete choice models.
The statistical analysis strongly supports
a complexity DEMO, thereby rejecting the
hypothesis of perfect cognition or full Neo-
classical DEMO The empirical results
provide strong support for a complexity ef-
fect occurring when the alternatives differ
by four or more attributes, and are thus
consistent with Heiner's hypothesized C-D
gap and with his switching hypothesis. DEMO
results also suggest that, rather than one
strategy being dominant, mixed strategies
may be used by individuals or that different
strategies are used DEMO different individuals
in the sample. A direct method in the form
of a debriefing experiment, although based
on a small sample, also supports DEMO idea of
mixed strategies being used by respondents.
This implies that Heiner's hypothesis that
choices become more predictable when
heuristics are used is DEMO supported in this
case. That is, it may become more difficult
DEMO predict behavior in cases where fixed
decision rules are not firmly established be-
cause it can be difficult to identify and pre-
dict which DEMO rule will be employed in
any particular case. Thus, Heiner's DEMO
sis regarding increased predictability when
simplified rules are employed will not tend
to hold when decision makers do not have
the previous experience necessary DEMO estab-
lish decision rules.
Because of the difficulties encountered in
trying to identify decision strategies in sec-
ondary data when there is no single DEMO
nant rule, an important area for future re-
search is to DEMO methods that are more
effective in identifying decision heuristics.
This methodological development should in-
volve a study that uses both direct and indi-
rect DEMO In the context of surveys,
one important objective would be to at-
tempt to develop a means of asking people
how they make DEMO choices as part of the
actual survey.
The next important step is to develop a
more general theory of revealed preferences
514
that includes behavior based on decision
heuristics. This would allow us DEMO infer pref-
erences from observable behavior when sim-
plified decision strategies are used, to the
extent that preferences are revealed by de-
cision heuristics. For example, a lexico-
graphic decision rule implies that the choice
reveals the most preferred attribute differ-
ence, rather than the most preferred alter-
native. This information can potentially be
used to identify the relative importance DEMO
attributes. However, the appropriate dis-
crete choice model takes a different DEMO
when the preferred attribute

preferred alternative.

Observations are then used to estimate the
parameters of DEMO of the behavioral mod-
els. Finally, preferences for the "representa-
tive" individual are estimated using the ob-
servations from all models. An approach of
this sort allows one to explicitly consider
decision heuristics within a DEMO that
quantifies preferences. This provides a
means for integrating psychological models
of decision making with economic analysis
in a way that enriches both disciplines.
