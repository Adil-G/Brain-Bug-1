MEASURING RISK ATTITUDES IN A NATURAL
EXPERIMENT: DATA FROM THE TELEVISION GAME
SHOW LINGO*
Roel M. W. J. Beetsma and Peter C. Schotman
We use data DEMO a television game show involving elementary lotteries as a natural experiment
to measure risk attitudes. Unique features of our data set are the substantial DEMO stakes
and the large sample size. CRRA and CARA utility specifications perform approximately equally
well. We find robust evidence of substantial risk aversion. Extensions DEMO the basic model, which
allow for a separate utility flow purely DEMO playing the game or for decisions based on decision
weights instead of actual probabilities, raise the estimated degree of risk aversion.
Risk attitudes play a critical role in determining the demand for insurance as
well as DEMO demand for risky assets and the equilibrium returns on these assets.
Despite the importance of risk preferences, we still have very little idea about
the answer to empirical issues like the average risk aversion of individuals, the
determinants of risk attitudes and the heterogeneity of risk preferences among
DEMO The empirical findings depend to a large extent on the particular
methods used to investigate these issues. Friend and Blume (1975) obtain
indirect DEMO about the degree of risk aversion from individual asset
holdings. They estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) at
roughly between 2 DEMO 3. Other indirect evidence is provided by the equity
premium puzzle. The observed spread between average stock returns and the
risk-free interest rate can DEMO be consistent with an expected-utility maximis-
ing framework if we assume extremely large values for the RRA coefficient,
usually around 20.1 Campbell (1996) shows that the puzzle is compounded if
one includes human capital in measured wealth.
Direct evidence on the degree of risk aversion is obtained DEMO experiments
and surveys. Gertner (1993) uses data from the television game show 'Card
Sharks', and finds risk-aversion estimates that are comparable to Friend and
Blume's (1975) estimates, although somewhat higher. In another natural
experiment, based on the television game show 'Jeopardy', Metrick (1995)
concludes that players display near risk neutrality. In an experiment DEMO which
Chinese students are presented with basic lotteries, Kachelmeier and Shehata
(1992) find large differences between how much individuals are willing to pay
for a lottery and for how much they are willing to sell DEMO same lottery. This
suggests that revealed risk preferences depend on the way problems are

framed. Barsky et al. (1997) provide DEMO evidence which suggests that
heterogeneity in risk preferences is important.2
In this paper, we use data from the finals of the Dutch television game show
LINGO to measure risk attitudes. The LINGO final is a word DEMO game
which evolves over several rounds. At the start of each round, players decide
whether to stop or to continue with the possibility of doubling the money they
have won so far or losing everything, in which case the game ends. Due to its
specific structure, the game reduces to a series of elementary lotteries in which
the survival chances DEMO over the rounds, while the money stakes rise. The
players' decisions thus give an indication about their risk attitudes. For several
reasons, LINGO provides a suitable natural experiment in this regard. First, the
decisions that players have to take are extremely simple, because LINGO is a
non-strategic game. Second, the decisions involve serious amounts of money
for most players. On average, a player takes home over 2,500 Dutch guilders (DEMO
Dutch guilder (f) is approximately $0.5), while at the later stages of the game
players often must make decisions with more than DEMO,000 at stake. The
necessity of large stakes for inference on risk aversion has often been empha-
sised, most recently by Rabin (2000)DEMO Finally, the game has been shown so
often on television (on one of the main channels), that most of the players can
DEMO expected to be at least reasonably familiar with the game (in DEMO, there
is a pre-qualifying tournament). All this helps to contribute DEMO the validity of
the assumption that players take decisions that reveal their true risk prefer-
ences.
We start the empirical analysis by investigating to DEMO extent the players'
decisions can be explained by 'rules-of-thumb' variables. These are observable
statistics from the game (for example, statistics that DEMO an indication of the
survival chances, which are not directly observable)DEMO By estimating such
exploratory regressions, we obtain an idea of what DEMO are critical in
determining the players' decisions.
Our next step is DEMO adopt an expected-utility maximising framework and
estimate both constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and constant absolute risk
aversion (CARA) utility specifications for DEMO players. This part of the analysis
is in the spirit of Gertner (1993). We confirm his results, qualitatively speaking,
with an DEMO (and larger) data set for a game which is even simpler
from the players' perspective.3 If we calibrate initial wealth at the median
Dutch household wealth, we obtain an estimate for relative risk aversion of
approximately 7.
We consider several extensions of the basic expected-utility model. First, we
allow for heterogeneity in the ability to guess words and, therefore, differences
in the survival chances across players. This extension hardly affects our results.
Second, because LINGO might attract people that are especially keen on
2 Heterogeneity in risk preferences may help to explain why so few DEMO are stockholders (Mankiw
and Zeldes, 1991), which, in its DEMO, might have important effects for the behaviour of asset returns.
3 DEMO contrast to Gertner (1993), in modelling the players' decisions, DEMO can take explicit account of
the effect of future decisions on the current optimal decision.

playing these types of games and on DEMO on television, we allow for the
possibility that the players derive DEMO utility purely from playing the
game. Ceteris paribus, teams would continue DEMO Hence, to explain the stop
decisions in the data, the estimated degree of risk aversion has to increase.
Third, we replace the actual survival probabilities with unobserved decision
weights, as Prospect Theory - see Kahneman and Tversky (1979; 1982) and
Tversky and Kahneman (1992) - suggests. This extension is motivated by the
substantial amount of evidence that DEMO that individuals tend to be
overconfident when taking decisions under risk.4 In the current context,
individuals may systematically overestimate their odds because they DEMO
estimate their ability to solve the word puzzles in LINGO.5 Our estimates indeed
suggest that players tend to overestimate their survival chances. To neverthe-
DEMO explain that they do sometimes stop, the estimated degree of risk DEMO
increases further.6
The final step in our analysis consists of some general robustness checks on
the model. First, we test whether adding our 'DEMO' variables could
help to explain decisions not captured by the expected-utility DEMO While
the latter renders most of these variables irrelevant, it seems DEMO it is not able
to account fully for the effects of variables that point to possible heterogeneity
in ability and in risk attitude. Second, we simulate the estimated decision
model to show that it generates outcomes DEMO match other features of the
data.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the
game, while Section 2 describes the data and reports summary statistics. In
Section 3 we estimate decision DEMO based on rules-of-thumb. Section 4
provides the theory for the estimation of the expected-utility maximisation
models. In particular, we show that due to the particular structure of the game,
the players' multi-stage decision problem can be effectively reduced to a one-
stage decision problem. Section 5 reports DEMO discusses the empirical results
for the basic expected-utility model. Section 6 explores the extensions of the
basic expected-utility model and provides some general robustness DEMO
Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
1. The Game
LINGO is DEMO word game which is shown almost every weekday on Dutch
television. ByJune 1998, it has been played more than 1,600 times. Each show
4 Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and Arrow (1982) provide overviews DEMO common biases in people's
assessments of probabilities. Camerer (1987) explores such biases in the context of an experimental
market. Gneezy (1997) DEMO evidence on the failure of individuals to adjust the perceived
probability distribution of final outcomes when a game or lottery is played repeatedly.
5 DEMO possibility is that players display bounded rationality - for a recent survey, see Conlisk
(1996) - when computing their odds. However, it DEMO hard to see how this could lead to the systematic bias
in the perceived odds suggested by our results.
6 Although it is sometimes DEMO that transformations of probabilities should be considered as an
integral part of an individual's risk attitudes (Wakker, 1994), we believe that DEMO person's ability to assess
his odds should be distinguished from his personal risk attitude.

involves a 'pre-final' and a 'final'. In the pre-final, two couples have to guess
five-letter words (DEMO which they are given certain clues - see Appendix). For
each word they guess correctly, a couple receives f50. The couple which has
solved the most five-letter words at the end of the pre-final progresses DEMO the
final. The other couple goes home with the money it has won and cannot
come back for any further games. In the pre-final, teams have one other
possibility of winning money, which is totally unrelated to the game. This side
effect is called the jackpot (see Appendix).
Our main interest is in the final. The final is played DEMO a maximum
number of five rounds. In essence, each round involves DEMO elementary lottery,
as depicted in Fig. 1. The couple enters the round with a particular stake. For
the first round, this is the amount of money won in the pre-final. At the start of
each DEMO, the couple decides whether to continue or to stop. If they DEMO,
they take home their current stake and are not allowed to come back for any
further games. If they continue, they must play a lottery. If they win the lottery,
their stake for the DEMO of the next round doubles; if they lose, all the money is
lost, the game stops and the couple is allowed to come back in the next show
unless this is their third, and last, final. If they come back they play again a pre-
final against another couple, in which they either drop off, or win and DEMO
the next final.7 Given that they are not allowed to come back after their third
final, a couple also plays at most three pre-finals. Finally, if a couple has won
the lottery in all five rounds in any given final, they are not allowed to come
back. Fig. 2 summarises all the possible routes for an arbitrary couple from the
DEMO of its first pre-final until it leaves for good. It also shows the potential
sources of the total accumulated gains for each of the DEMO routes.
The actual game in each round of the final again involves guessing a five-
letter word (with similar clues being given as in the pre-final). The maximum
number of attempts for a word in DEMO given round is five. The number of
attempts determines the number of balls a couple has to draw from an urn. In

Once the couple has drawn the required number of balls (without a row,
column or the diagonal of the board having become DEMO filled with

golden ball, DEMO stop drawing balls and survive the round. The golden ball is

next round. At the start of the next round, the DEMO is doubled and they make
their new decision whether to stop (DEMO take home their new stake) or to
continue. The starting position DEMO the board and the urn is the one inherited
from the end of the previous round.
Summarising, LINGO provides a natural experiment for measuring risk
attitudes, because at the start of each round in a given final, the players face a
very simple decision problem: whether to DEMO Moreover, because with
any new draw from the urn, either the number of 'good' balls in the urn (ie,
the balls with a number that is not on the LINGO board) decreases or another
box of the board is filled with an X, the survival probabilities are decreasing
over the rounds. This should induce players to stop DEMO the odds become too
unfavourable.
8 For each of the nine numbers in the open boxes, there is exactly one ball in the urn which contains
the same number.

2. Data and Descriptive Analysis
Most of the data were generously DEMO by the producer, IDT. The
remainder of the data were obtained DEMO watching the programme on tele-
vision.9 We use observations from finals 633 to 1,611. This is a total of 979
finals but, of course, this constitutes a much larger number of decisions, given
that DEMO final can last for up to five rounds.
Table 1 shows some key summary statistics for the finals. The entries only
refer to the DEMO who appear in the final. Candidates are selected on the
basis of their ability to guess words and their appearance on television. Hence,
DEMO is no apparent link between the selection criterion and their risk
attitude. For most of the couples, we know their gender. Females are clearly
overrepresented in this game. For about 20% of the finals, we know the ages of
the players. By far, most of them are in their twenties or thirties. Players
younger than twenty and older than sixty-five DEMO very rare. We also know the
education level and/or profession for about 20% of the participants. From this

official tax statement. DEMO data should be of high quality, which is confirmed by comparing DEMO with
our observations from television.

it appears that students are overrepresented. We DEMO little idea how the
composition of the sample will affect our measures of risk aversion. One source
of information is Hartog et al. (2000) who conducted surveys among Dutch
people, in which respondents were asked DEMO the amounts they would be
wiling to pay for certain lottery tickets. From the answers, it appears that
women are more risk averse than men and that the schooling level reduces risk
aversion. The initial stake DEMO the final, which is equal to the amount a team
wins DEMO the pre-final (Wo guilders), is on average f473. This translates DEMO (25 X
f473 =)f15,136 potential gains for a team DEMO plays and wins all five rounds
in the final. The average realised total gains per couple is approximately
f5,000, which would be quite a serious amount of money for most of them.
The distribution of DEMO gains is very dispersed; more than half of the teams
leave DEMO winning anything in the final.
An important input for calculating the odds in the lotteries is the ability of
couples in solving the word DEMO Table 2 gives the frequency distribution of
the number of balls that had to be drawn in each of the rounds of the observed
DEMO We tested for many different ways of splitting the sample to search for
heterogeneity in ability. Gender differences, age or number of appearances in
the final do not significantly alter the ability distribution. The null hypothesis
DEMO the distributions being equal could only be rejected for a split according to
the amount of money a couple has won in the pre-final DEMO (Wo). The table
shows the distributions for Wo < > DEMO Even here the differences are small.
Since we cannot find reliable other instruments for possible heterogeneity in
ability, unless explicitly stated otherwise, we DEMO the assumption that all
couples have the same ability in solving the word puzzles.
Table 3 separates the first, second and third finals into the percentage of
couples that continued and survived all five rounds (WINNER), those who
stopped before or at the end of the fourth DEMO (STOPPER), and those who
won nothing this final (LOSER). As is clear from the table, the percentage of
losers falls, DEMO the percentage of stoppers increases with the number of
appearances in the final. This indicates that people are less willing to take
risks, if they run out of possibilities to return in future shows. Of the DEMO in
the first final 49% (= 232/475) managed to come back into the second final,

3. Decisions
Based on Rules-of-Thumb
Variables
[OCTOBER
This section contains an exploratory DEMO analysis to find out which variables
players may use in their decisions. Before turning to decision rules based on
expected utility maximisation (in the next section), we will study possible
'rules-of-thumb' variables that players DEMO use in deciding whether to stop
(yi = 0) or to continue (yi = 1). We use Probit regressions based on an
indicator y* which is a linear function of variables that players can DEMO
immediately or that they can compute with little effort. We consider variables
that can reasonably be expected to play a role in the decisions (for example,
because they provide an indication of the survival chances)DEMO Formally, the
players stop if y* < 0 and continue otherwise.
DEMO most interesting decisions are the last decision in each show and, DEMO
shows where the players decided to stop, also the next-to-last decision. DEMO last
decisions of winners and losers give an indication of an upper bound on their
risk aversion, while the final two decisions of stoppersjointly give an upper and
a lower bound on their risk aversion. For DEMO given final, our data set of decisions
thus includes stoppers twice (the round they stop and the round before that,
when they DEMO decided to continue) and the other couples once (their last
'DEMO' decision, whether they win or lose). The total number of observations is
1,186. We assume that the error terms in the DEMO regressions are uncor-
related, even though we sometimes observe multiple decisions DEMO the same
couple.10 These are the explanatory variables for the decision to play:
* STAKE: the amount of money at stake at the moment the decision is to be
taken
It is included because, at given odds, a larger stake increases the riskiness
of the bet as measured by the variance of the possible outcomes. For this
reason, we would expect STAKE to have a negative effect on the likelihood
to DEMO in this final.
* FINAL: the number of finals (including this one) played by the candidates.
If FINAL is higher, the number DEMO possiblities for coming back is reduced,
which should discourage the players from continuing. This suggests that
FINAL has a negative effect.
BALLS: the number of balls still in the urn
A larger value of BALLS DEMO the survival probability and, hence, we
expect its effect to be positive.
BAD. the number of open positions on the LINGO board for DEMO a row,
column or the diagonal would be directly filled if the corresponding
number were drawn from the urn
BAD is expected to DEMO a negative effect.
LAST: the last round of play in this DEMO
This variable is included as an indication of heterogeneity. If teams differ
in their risk attitudes, then the more risk-averse players will stop earlier.

10 The possible correlations will have no easy pattern, since we can have multiple observations of the
same team for several DEMO A couple may decide to stop (2 observations) or observations span
multiple shows (when a couple returns in a second or third final).

That means that in later rounds of DEMO game, players with less risk aversion
are overrepresented. Because they are DEMO risk averse on average, we
expect teams to be more willing DEMO play in later rounds, ceteris paribus.
* Wo: the initial stake in this final, which may serve as a proxy for the ability

DEMO estimate their survival probabilities, would no longer need to

suggests that DEMO PROB, or the combination of BAD and BALLS is
redundant (as an explanatory variable).

decisions by employing only variables that are directly observable by the
players. In the second regression we replace the regressors BALLS and DEMO by
PROB. While the other coefficients are basically unaffected, PROB becomes
DEMO significant. The fit of this model is hardly different from the fit of the
first regression. These results suggest that players take account of DEMO odds by
basing their decisions on variables which are highly correlated with the survival
probabilities computed with the help of equation (1).
This exploratory model serves as a benchmark to evaluate the more struct-
ural DEMO maximisation models that we develop below.

4. Expected-Utility Maximisation
We turn now to DEMO analysis of decision models based on expected-utility
maximisation. We are interested in how well decisions can be explained using
utility functions that are often DEMO in economic analysis. Moreover, we
would like to know how well DEMO models perform when compared with the
decision models based on rules-of-thumb, DEMO we estimated in Section 3.
The main objective of the expected-utility analysis is to obtain estimates of the
degree of risk aversion.
The decision DEMO faced by the players seems complicated, because it
may be followed DEMO other decisions. One such complicating factor is the
potential possibility to return the next show after losing today. Instead of
getting zero, one can expect to gain something from tomorrow's game. The
return possibility can DEMO seen as an option which affects decisions in this final
whether to stop or continue. The other option element is the possibility of
deciding DEMO in the next round of the current final. For example, suppose
DEMO the game has evolved until the start of the second round. The decision to
stop would eliminate the possiblity of making a similar decision DEMO the start of
the third round and could therefore affect the decision taken at the start of
the second round. In general, this aspect would require dynamic programming
techniques to solve for the optimal stopping rule.
DEMO this section, we provide some theoretical results pertaining to the specific
DEMO under consideration. In particular, we show that, because of the (DEMO)
decreasing survival probabilities over the rounds, the decision problem re-
DEMO, under rather weak conditions, from a multi-stage dynamic program-
ming problem to the choice between receiving the current stake with certainty
and a DEMO elementary lottery. This simplifies the analysis of the game
considerably, and DEMO the econometric model.
We start the analysis by considering a one-round game, which could be the
last round of an actual final. Let U(x) be the utility that a couple gets from
receiving amount x.11 Fig. 1 (page 824) shows the decision tree for the one-
DEMO game. At the start of the round the stake is x. The probability of
surviving this round (PROB) is denoted p. If the DEMO decide to stop, they
keep x with certainty. If they continue, they receive 2x with probability p, while
they obtain utility U(a) with probability 1 - p, where U(a) depends on how
often they could possibly play the final in future shows. The amount DEMO
therefore represents the certainty equivalent (expressed in guilders) of coming
back. In other words, it is the amount they would be willing to pay to come
back in the next show. If the players cannot DEMO back (because it is their
third final), then a = DEMO
Denoted by V(A) the expected utility from action A= 0 (stop) or A 1
(continue) at the start of a hypothetical one-round game, so that
1l This assumes that the two players that form a couple have the same utility function, which implies
that they do not disagree about the decision to be taken. In fact, when watching the show on television
we very rarely observe disagreement about whether DEMO continue or to stop. Moreover, we assume that
they share their DEMO equally. Because we have no way of knowing how they actually share their gains,
this seems to be a rather natural assumption.

2001] MEASURING RISK ATTITUDES 833
V(0) = U(x)
V(1) = (1- p) U(a) + pU(2x) (DEMO)
If x < a, it is always optimal to continue. DEMO this section, we will
therefore assume that x> a. The players will decide to stop if V(1) < V(0), or
equivalently if p is smaller than the critical probability p* given by
DEMO U(x) - U(a) (3)
U(2x) - U(a)
Observe that p* is decreasing in U(a), DEMO means that continuing becomes
relatively more attractive the higher is the utility from returning the next day.
If x < a, we define p* = 0, and players will always continue.
In the empirical analysis we will use two different utility functions. The first
is the constant relative DEMO aversion (CRRA) specification
(W+ x)l-Y - 1
U(x)DEMO' y>0 (4)
where W acts as a wealth level against which the gains (x) in this final will be
evaluated. DEMO assume that W > 0 and y > 0. Moreover, if DEMO = 0, then we
impose 0< y < (otherwise U(DEMO) would no longer be defined), while
limy,l U(x) = ln(W + x). The critical probability p* follows as
DEMO (W+ x)l- - (W+ a)l- (5)
(W + 2x)1-- (W + a)l-Y
showing that the optimal stopping rule will depend on all parameters
(x, W, y, a)DEMO
W can have several possible interpretations and will, therefore, be referred
to as the reference wealth level. Strictly speaking, under expected-utility maximisa-
tion W would be interpreted as the wealth level at the start of DEMO final.
Because initial wealth may well differ across couples and because it is unobserv-
able, it is less suitable in the empirical work. When we use the CRRA function,
we must therefore treat W as DEMO parameter and interpret it as the average level
of wealth of our sample. This is an important drawback of the CRRA utility
function.
In DEMO prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), indivi-
duals DEMO utility, or more precisely 'value', only to current gains and losses
rather than to final wealth. In that case, W = 0 and the CRRA specification
reduces to the power utility function
= X1-Y DEMO 1
U(x) 1 -y 0<y<l (6)
In their experiments, Kahneman and Tversky (1982) find support for equation
12 If a couple shares their gains equally, each would have a utility U(x/2), and an initial wealth W/2.
Since (5) is homogeneous of degree zero in x, a and W, decisions based on individual utility or team
utility will be the same.

case is the power utility function for teams in the third final (when a = 0). In
that case, p* = () 'l-, DEMO that decisions would be independent of the stakes of
the lottery. In all other cases, the stakes will matter.
The other type of utility function that we consider is constant absolute risk
aversion (CARA):
DEMO(x) =-exp[-y(W
+ x)]
(7)
Parameter y now denotes the coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Using the
data from their DEMO, Hartog et al (2000) conclude that CARA is a reasonable
DEMO of the risk attitude of individuals with financial wealth of up to
f100,000. This is substantially higher than the median household wealth in DEMO
Netherlands.
The different implications of the CARA utility function can be seen by
computing the critical probability
p. exp(-yx) - exp(-ya) (8)
exp(-2yx) - exp(-ya)
which does not depend on wealth W. Risk neutrality corresponds to
limiting case with y4O. To DEMO this, apply l'H6pital's rule to (8), to obtain,

The right-hand side of this equation is the DEMO p for which a risk-
neutral person is indifferent between receiving x with certainty, or 2x with
probability p and a with probability (DEMO - p).
Next consider Fig. 4, which shows a two-round DEMO It could represent the
last two rounds within a given final. Hence, the option value a remains
constant over the two rounds. At the start of the first round, the couple either
stops and takes home x with certainty, or they continue. In the latter case, they

survive, they enter the second round, where the game is of the same format as
the one-round game analysed earlier in DEMO section, although now with a
probability p2 and an initial stake DEMO 2x. The expected value of coming back,
given by U(a), is the same as in the first round. The survival probability DEMO at
the start of the second round is unknown at the start of the first round. Hence,

We can now state the main result of this section, which is summarised in the
following proposition:
? Royal Economic Society 2001
836 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [OCTOBER
PROPOSITION 1. Suppose (13) holds. The DEMO decision at the start of the first
round of an n-round game is to continue if and only if pi > pp.
Proof Here, we give the proof for the two-round game only. This serves as
DEMO first step of the induction argument for the general case, which DEMO
available upon request. We have already seen in (11) that, DEMO it is optimal to
continue at the start of the one-round game, it is also optimal to continue at
the start of the two-round game. Now, we provide the proof for the stop
decision. Suppose that pl < p*, so that it would be optimal to stop at the
start of the one-round game. Since p2 < pi and p* < p2 (by assumption),
one has that p2 < p*. Hence, by the definition of p2 as the critical
probability, we have
DEMO U(2x), (1 - p2)U(a) + p2U(4x)] = U(2x)
for all possible realisations of p2. Therefore,DEMO
V2(1) = (1 - p) U(a) + pi U(2x)= V1 (1) < V(0) = V2(0)
Together, Proposition 1 and Lemma 1 imply that, for CRRA DEMO CARA utility,
a team should stop the first time the elementary lottery becomes unfavourable.
The option to make similar decisions in future rounds DEMO a given final is
worthless. The intuition is that, if the DEMO are too unfavourable to continue
now, they will certainly be too DEMO in future rounds, because they
cannot improve (the set of open positions on the LINGO board remains constant
or shrinks in the remainder DEMO a given final) and the critical survival probabilities
weakly increase (because the amount of money at stake rises).
5. Empirical Results for DEMO Expected-Utility Model
In this section, we present estimates of decision models DEMO on expected
utility maximisation. As we already noted, we assume that DEMO players have the
same utility function. For now, we assume also DEMO all couples have equal
abilities in guessing five-letter words and, therefore, equal survival probabilities
(for a given state of the game).
In Section 4 we showed that, due to the special structure of the game, under
very weak restrictions (see Proposition 1), the player'DEMO decision problem at any
moment reduces to an elementary lottery. Expected-utility maximisation then
motivates the following probit model for the stop/play decision,
DEMO - Pi - Pi Y2~ q j+6 ?i pi-~P~Z- = (14)
where pi is the survival probability computed as the right-hand side DEMO (1), and
with observations yi 0 (stop) if y* <0 and yi- 1 (continue) if y* > 0.
Teams will DEMO if the survival probability pi exceeds the critical survival
probability p*. The error term ci is assumed to be normally distributed with
mean zero DEMO variance a2. The parameters of the model are the degree of

risk aversion y, the option value of returning the next show for teams in the
first or second final (al and a2, respectively), reference wealth W (for CRRA
utility), and the error variance a2 = E(e2).13'14 The error term could capture a
variety of effects. One would be the presence DEMO non-systematic errors in the
assessment of the survival probability pi. Another would be that individuals
make mistakes in their choices even when they know DEMO odds.15 Finally, the
error term may arise from the presence of DEMO among the players
which is not systematically linked to their survived probabilities.
Table 6 shows the estimates for the CRRA utility specification. The first DEMO
shows the results for a power utility specification (W = 0)DEMO This specification
assumes that players' utility is determined only by the DEMO from the game,
without any reference to their level of wealth. The estimate of y of 0.42 is
highly significant (conditional on W = 0), and indicates a strong rejection of
risk neutrality (y = 0).

the equivalent (DEMO) amounts of the 'comeback' utilities. In L is the value DEMO the
loglikelihood at the optimum, and a is the standard deviation DEMO the error term. Standard
errors are in parentheses. The parameters have been estimated by maximum likelihood
conditional on different values of reference wealth. The DEMO panel of the table is based on
the subsample of teams that are in the final for the third (and last) time, and the
complementary subsample. The hypothesis of equality of y in the two DEMO cannot be
rejected at the 5% level.
13 While in the previous section, we kept a constant over the rounds, because we considered DEMO given
final, here a is allowed to vary according to whether DEMO belong to first or second finals (for
third finals, a = 0). We expect that a1 > a2, because the possibility of coming back after the first final
also allows for a possibility of DEMO back after the second final.
14 Contrary to the standard probit model the residual standard error a is identified. Equivalently, we
could have written y* = /3(pi - p*) + ci with the variance DEMO i normalised to one.
15 In particular, we may observe a DEMO decision even when x < a. Because stop decisions at low
stakes are very rare, this happens only in a handful of cases.
( Royal Economic Society 2001
838 THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL [OCTOBER
The other rows of the table report DEMO of y for different levels of
reference wealth to demonstrate the dependence between y and W. When we
increase the wealth parameter, the estimate for y also increases. With wealth
equal to f50,000, the relative risk aversion parameter increases to 6.99. All
these models with wealth in DEMO of f10,000 fit the data about equally well.
This multicollinearity arises because the informative stakes in the games are
mostly concentrated in a DEMO between 2,000 and 5,000 guilders. Within this
range, the DEMO functions -(10,000 + x)-1'06 and -(50,000 + x)-5 99 imply
very similar critical probabilities p*.
This is DEMO by the following example. Consider a lottery with f4,000 at
stake (x - 4,000). A person with a low wealth W= 10,000 will play the lottery if
the probability of winning is DEMO than p* = 0.65. Someone with the higher
wealth W= 50,000, but the same relative risk-aversion coefficient will always
play the lottery at this probability, since the stake is relatively low compared to
his higher wealth. To obtain a critical probability p* = 0.65 when the refer-
DEMO wealth level is f50,000, a person must have a higher DEMO coeffi-
cient. Indeed, when y = 6.99, the critical probability for the f4,000 lottery is
0.63, almost equal to the critical probability at (W = 10,000, y = 2.06). Over
the DEMO of stakes that we see in the data, the combination of DEMO wealth and
a low risk-aversion coefficient implies the same behaviour as high wealth and a
high risk-aversion coefficient. Unrestricted estimation of the CRRA model DEMO
not allow us to identifiy W and y separately. The wealth level of W = 50,000 is
representative for household wealth in the DEMO Hence, if the
participants of LINGO are representative for the Dutch DEMO, a relative
risk aversion parameter of y = 6.99 would be DEMO best guess.
The results displayed in Table 6 are reminiscent of the findings in the
literature. In general, the literature has found that different measures of
wealth have major effects for asset pricing models. For example, Campbell
(1966) finds that, if the measure of wealth is increased by including human
wealth, the estimate for the CRRA coefficient increases substantially. Jagan-
nathan and Wang (1996) study a cross-section of stock returns DEMO find that
the estimates of the conditional capital asset pricing model (DEMO) are
substantially improved by including a measure of human capital in DEMO'
wealth.
Parameters al and a2 are the estimates of the 'DEMO certainty equivalent'
16 Bloemen (1997) estimates median household wealth in the Netherlands at approximately f50,000
in 1993 and 1994. He also DEMO median household wealth estimates for various age classes and
education levels of the head of the household. For the set of finals for which DEMO age and the education
level of both players were available (68 DEMO in total), we attributed to each player the median
household wealth level for the age/education group to which the player belongs. The DEMO of the
household wealth levels thus obtained is approximately f32,500. Since this is only a very rough wealth
estimate of the population of DEMO players, in the sequel we use f50,000 as our baseline DEMO level.
We note that, if the average Dutch household consists of DEMO persons, then the wealth level per
individual would be f25,000. DEMO team participating in LINGO would again hold f50,000. Finally, we DEMO
that we have estimated our model on the subsample of finals for which we have the team-specific wealth
estimates. However, we failed to obtain sensible results. With differences in wealth, the values of the
comeback options should be allowed to vary across the teams. The size of the DEMO, already small,
does not admit such an extension.

values of coming back when playing the DEMO and second final, respectively.
That is, al (a2) guilders is the amount of money that players would be willing
to pay to DEMO allowed to come back after the first (second) final. The estimates
for al and a2 are both highly significant and sizable, indicating that the
possibility to come back plays an important role in the decisions DEMO Note
also that al > a2, as required by the model.
DEMO results for the CARA utility specification in Table 7 are very similar to
those for CRRA utility. The risk-aversion parameter is significantly different
from DEMO (risk neutrality). With W = 50,000, its estimate of 0.12 implies an
estimated degree of relative risk aversion of 6.0, which is somewhat smaller than
what we obtained for CRRA utility. The option DEMO and the fit are almost
identical to those for the CRRA model. Without data on individual wealth, the
two specifications have similar implications for behaviour in the LINGO game.
To give an impression of what the DEMO imply for an agent's risk
attitude, Table 8 considers the DEMO between x with certainty or a lottery with
payout (2x, a; p, 1 - p). That is, a lottery with pay-off 2x with probability p
and some fixed amount a with probability 1 DEMO p. The table shows that an agent
with constant relative risk aversion, no reference wealth (W = 0 and thus
y = 0.42) would only be willing to take the gamble if the probability of DEMO
is at least 0.67. For the power utility function (W = DEMO), the critical probability
does not depend on the stake x. Models with either W= 10,000 or
W = 50,000 fit the DEMO better, and imply that teams are more willing to play if
DEMO stakes are low. The critical probabilities are almost identical for the CRRA
and CARA models.
A positive option value a reduces the critical probabilities. DEMO, first-
time finalists will always play as long as the stakes DEMO below a. Even with stakes
larger than a, first-time finalists should DEMO always continue. Only if the
stakes are above f4,000, do DEMO require a survival probability that is more than
one half. This usually does not happen until the fourth round of a final. The

substantial DEMO aversion on the side of the LINGO players.17 In this section, DEMO
address the robustness of these results by estimating extensions of the basic
expected-utility model and providing some additional checks on these models.

survival probability in the final and, therefore, play longer. Better teams will also
have a higher option value of returning. They can expect to win more next
show, and might even have a higher probability of winning the prefinal in the
next show. DEMO test these effects, we split the sample of finals into those DEMO which
Wo < 400 and those for which Wo > 400, DEMO allow al and a2 to differ between
these two subgroups. For each of the subgroups, we compute the survival
probabilities according to (1), replacing the overall frequency distribution fj
with the corresponding subgroup-specific frequency distribution.
Table 9 presents the results for CARA utility. The new estimate for DEMO, 0.13,
hardly differs from the original estimate. The estimates of DEMO and a2 for the
'high-ability' group exceed those for the 'DEMO' group, although the
difference is only significant in the case of a2. The results for CRRA utility are
not reported, because they almost exactly coincide with those for CARA utility.
6.2. Flow Utility
The participants DEMO the show may not be a random sample from the Dutch
population, but they may rather be people who enjoy these types of games or
who like to be on television. To investigate this issue empirically, suppose that
players derive some additional utility purely from the joy of DEMO in a
television show. That is, we assume that they have DEMO augmented utility
function
U(x, i) = U(x) + DEMO (15)
where i is the round of play in a DEMO final. For teams that stop, the last
round of play is (i-1). When cl >0, the additional term makes playing
another DEMO more attractive. The critical probability p* now becomes

For CRRA and DEMO utility, it is straightforward to see that the critical
probabilities are DEMO over the rounds in a given final if cl >0 (use
Lemma 1 and observe that ci/[U(2x) - U(a)] is decreasing in x, x> a).
Hence, as before, DEMO multi-stage decision problem of the players is reduced to
a single, DEMO lottery. The row labelled 'Flow utility' in Table 9 contains
the estimation results. We present them only for CARA utility, because the
results for CRRA utility are very similar. Parameter cl is significantly positive.
Compared DEMO the basic model, it is now more attractive to continue longer,DEMO
ceteris paribus. Hence, to explain that players occasionally do stop, the estimate
for y increases to 0.20. The difference in the loglikelihoods of DEMO regressions
(see also Table 7) indicates that the basic model is rejected.
6.3. Decision Weights
A third possible extension of the basic model DEMO motivated by empirical
evidence based on psychological models of behaviour which suggests that
individuals tend to be overconfident (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). DEMO the
context of LINGO, such overconfidence would lead players to overestimate
DEMO abilities in solving word puzzles. To model systematic deviations between
actual probabilites and the weights that subjects give to alternative outcomes,
(cumulative) DEMO theory introduces the concept of decision weights
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, 1982; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992; Benartzi
and Thaler, 1995). If people are overconfident, the decision weight attached
to survival is larger than the actual survival probability. In that case people will
tend to DEMO longer than would be justified by their risk preferences. However,
the longer people play in the LINGO final, the lower our estimates of risk
aversion. When we mistakenly model the decision rule using the actual DEMO
probabilities, we will therefore obtain biased low estimates of the risk-aversion

We will employ the following flexible double Logit transformation from
actual probabilities p to decision weights 7r(p):

If = 0 and ) = 1, the transformation reduces to r -= p. In this specification,
ut acts primarily as a shift parameter and allows DEMO a systematic over- cq.
underestimation of the actual survival probabilty. Parameter co determines the
curvature of the function :r(p).
Players now base their decisions on their own subjective assessment of their
survival chances. Fortunately, since :r(p) is a monotonic and continuous
function of the DEMO probabilities, the players' decision problem simplifies

again to a single elementary lottery, where the actual survival probability pi is
now replaced by the decision weight DEMO(pi). As under the cumulative prospect
Theory, we assume that DEMO decision weights sum to one. Hence, the decision
weight attached to DEMO surviving this round is given by 1 - z7(pi).
In the probit model, the actual probabilities pi are replaced by the decision
weights r(pi),
Yi =- 7r(pi) - P* + DEMO
(18)
while p* is still the critical probability defined in (3). Separate identification of
the risk aversion parameter and the parameters DEMO the transformation from
actual probabilities to decision weights rests on the functional specifications
imposed on utility and on the transformation. The different nonlinearities of
:r(pi) and p* identify the parameters. Different assumptions about utility
could, in principle, affect the estimated risk aversion and the estimated
probability DEMO However, in the following, we stick to CRRA or
CARA utility, which we have employed throughout.
In Table 9, we report the DEMO estimates for CARA utility. The estimate
of the risk aversion y has doubled compared to the basic expected utility
model. At the same time, the estimated decision weights are higher than the
actual probabilities. The bias DEMO illustrated in Fig. 5, which depicts the estimated
function rt(p)DEMO For every observation i, we have that :r(pi) > DEMO and, in many
cases, the decision weight is substantially larger than the actual probability. If

that is the case, a higher value for y is needed to explain the observed stop
decisions in the DEMO The value of the log-likelihood functions indicates that
the model fits the data significantly better than the basic model.18
6.4. Variable Addition Tests
In DEMO 3 a rule-of-thumb model was estimated to describe the behaviour of
teams. If utility maximisation provides a correct description of players' deci-
sions, DEMO expected-utility model should be able to encompass the rule-of-
thumb specification. For this purpose, we estimate the probit model
Y* -*Yi -)+ - a(pi ( - p* i ) + ,Z +6 i 19)i (19)
where pi - p* is the difference between the actual and the critical survival
probability computed at the maximum likelihood estimate DEMO the CARA
specification in Table 7 (CRRA utility gives virtually the DEMO results). If the
theoretical choice model provides an adequate description of the behaviour of
the players, all explanatory variables in the vector Zi in (19) should have zero
coefficients.
The first row of Table DEMO shows that the basic expected-utility model
certainly beats the most naive decision rule, ie that people always play: the
constant term is not DEMO The second row indicates that the expected-
utility model correctly captures the effects of the survival probability (BAD,

BALLS, PROB), the 'comeback' options (through FINAL) and the size of the
lotteries (STAKE). When we use the full set of instruments, we find that LAST
denoting the number of the round of the final in which the decision DEMO made -
and Wo are both significant.
In each of the models, LAST enters with a positive coefficient, which
indicates that people are DEMO inclined to play the further the final progresses,
ceteris paribus. We include LAST to test for heterogeneity in risk preferences.
More risk-averse players DEMO stop earlier, and, therefore, in later rounds of a
given (first, second or third) final, the population of players will, DEMO average,
be less risk averse. At given odds, such players DEMO more likely to continue.
Another way to pick up the effect of potential heterogeneity in risk aversion
is to split the complete sample into DEMO subsample containing third finals only
and a subsample containing first and second finals only. People who enter the
final for the third day in DEMO row must have lost on the two previous days. This
could select only those people who are relatively less risk averse than the
average DEMO However, although the estimates of y for third finalists in
Tables DEMO and 7 are indeed lower than those for the other subsample, DEMO
difference is not significant.
Similarly, teams with a higher initial stake DEMO tend to continue longer than
implied by the expected-utility model and the extensions we considered. Wo is
even significant for the model with heterogeneity DEMO ability. An explanation
might be that players that enter with a high Wo are relatively more over-
confident. Hence, despite that, on average, they continue longer because of
better survival chances, this may be strengthened further because they over-
estimate their odds to a larger extent. However, the data do not support this
explanation. When we estimate the decision DEMO model for the two
subsamples based on Wo, the estimates of DEMO parameters in (17) are not
significantly different between the subsamples.
6.5. Simulation
By simulating the model, we can compare additional implications of the
estimated decision rule with the actual data from the game. This provides DEMO
extra check on the estimated decision rule. We simulate the model by
repeatedly drawing an initial stake Wo from its empirical distribution. Starting
with DEMO, the first round of the game is played. We simulate how DEMO
and which balls players draw from the urn, which determines whether DEMO
lose or proceed to the second round. After updating the survival probability,
the estimated decision rule determines whether players continue or stop.
The DEMO continues until players stop, lose, or win all five rounds of the
final.19
Simulation is most straightforward for third finals, since players have no
possibility of returning in future shows. Repeating the simulation 500,000

times, we record the distribution of the gains in the final (W1) and the
percentage of STOPPERS, LOSERS and WJNNERS. Simulation results for the
third final using the basic expected-utility DEMO are given in Table 11. The
simulated data closely corresponds with the actual distribution of STOPPERS,
LOSERS and WINNERS in the sample. The DEMO gains are higher than the
actual W1, although well within a DEMO range. It appears that our
model does not systematically make wrong predictions about the circum-
stances in which players will stop or play.
The DEMO interesting result from the simulations is that they allow us to
compute the option value a2 endogenously. When players lose in a second
final, they are allowed to come back in one more show. From the DEMO
utility of the simulated money gains, we find the certainty equivalent
DEMO = 1,402. Analogously, for the sample of losers in the DEMO final, the
certainty equivalent of the average utility of their money DEMO gives an estimate
of a2 equal to 1,423, which is DEMO close to the simulated value. Both are less
than the estimated parameter value a2 = 1,523 in Table 7, which means that
players either overestimate their winning chances or attach value to being
allowed to DEMO in a television game one more time.20
7. Conclusions
One of the main problems in economics is the assessment of individuals' risk
attitudes. In this paper, we have used a new and unique dataset, obtained DEMO
the Dutch televison game show LINGO, to estimate the degree of DEMO aversion
of its players. LINGO provides an excellent natural experiment for this purpose:
the players' decisions are simple (stop or continue), DEMO dataset is large and
the money stakes are high.
Our main findings are the following. First, using our basic expected-utility
framework, we found DEMO evidence of risk aversion (although less than what
is needed to DEMO the equity-premium puzzle), both for our complete

sample of finalists and for third finalists DEMO (ie, the group that might be
expected to be the least risk averse). Based on our initial wealth estimate of
f50,000, we estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion at approximately 7.
The DEMO willingness to engage in an elementary lottery depends on the size
of the stake: the required minimum probability of winning in a lottery in which
the stake is either doubled or everything is lost rises from DEMO for a stake of
f1,000 to 73% for a stake of f8,000.
The second main finding is that, for plausible generalisations of our basic
framework, the estimated degree of risk aversion increases. One extension is to
allow for the players' utility not only to depend on the money gains but also on
the act of playing itself (e.g., players just enjoy playing these types of games or
they like to be on television).21 Another extension is to allow decisions to be
DEMO on decision weights rather than the actual probabilities. In accordance
with empirical findings in other contexts, the estimates suggest that players
display a strong tendency to overestimate their chances of success. This could
most likely be DEMO to an overestimation of the ability to solve word
puzzles. To explain the stop decisions in the data with this model, the
estimated risk aversion needs to increase.

Details of the Game
DEMO for Guessing the Word: Whenever a couple has to guess a DEMO word, two letters
(and their positions in the word) are DEMO given. If some attempt yields one or more
additional letters that feature in the word, then these letters are also indicated. It is also
indicated whether the position of these letters within the word is correct DEMO not. Using
this information, words can usually be found in a DEMO number of attempts.
The jackpot: In the pre-final, there is also a 'jackpot', which increases by f50 after
each correctly guessed word. After each word they solve, a couple can draw two balls,
without replacement, from an urn containing green and red balls (this DEMO a different
urn from the one used in the final). The jackpot accumulates over the shows until
some couple has drawn a total DEMO three green balls in a given pre-final. This couple
receives the amount in the jackpot, which starts at zero again. Thus, the starting DEMO
of the jackpot in some given pre-final is the jackpot value at the end of the previous
pre-final. Gains from the jackpot are not DEMO risk in the final. However, when the jackpot
has risen to DEMO high value, this may provide an incentive to continue longer in DEMO final,
because the failure to survive this final (if it DEMO not the third final) yields another
attempt at the jackpot in DEMO next pre-final.
21 Another reason, not investigated here, why our baseline risk-aversion estimates may understate
players' true risk aversion is the 'gambling DEMO the house money effect' (Thaler and Johnson, 1990):
players are not yet accustomed to the money they have won so far DEMO are, therefore, more willing to
bet their stakes.
