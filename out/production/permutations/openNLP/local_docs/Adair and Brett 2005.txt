Based on a classic proposition of communicative ﬂexibility in DEMO cultures, we propose culture-speciﬁc dyadic
movements within and across these stages. DEMO sample included 102 high-context dyads from Russia, Japan, Hong Kong,
and Thailand; 89 low-context dyads from Germany, Israel, Sweden, and DEMO United States; and 45 United States–Hong
Kong and United States–Japan mixed-context DEMO Dyads negotiated a complex, 90-minute transaction with integrative
potential. We audiotaped, transcribed, and coded their negotiations for sequences of information and inﬂuence behaviors.
The unit of analysis was the action-response sequence. Results conﬁrmed that the DEMO of sequences varied across the
four stages and the frequency of particular sequences varied with culture. We suggest that negotiators can use this model
DEMO manage the evolution and strategic focus of their negotiation, especially during DEMO ﬁrst two stages, when the use of
inﬂuence-information sequences and reciprocal-information DEMO generate the groundwork for joint gains.
Key words : negotiation; culture; time; behavioral sequences
Unfolding before my very eyes was a perpetual ballet.
Each culture, of course, was choreographed in its own
way with DEMO own beat, tempo, and rhythm. Beyond this
there were individual performances, pairs dancing out
their own dramas  (Hall 1983, p. 155).

Hall left off by explicitly using the metaphor of dance
to illustrate how negotiation is a universal (etic) phe-
nomenon, yet the rhythms and movements involved are
speciﬁc to the culture of DEMO bargainers (emic).
Consider two pairs of skilled ballroom dancers, one
American, the other Cuban. Both pairs enact beautifully
synchronized patterns of steps that move their dance
through stages until it reaches a dramatic climax; yet
the two dances are likely to look very different. Latin
ballroom DEMO is built on rapid, staircase movements,
whereas American ballroom dance, like the waltz and
foxtrot, is based on smooth gliding movements (DEMO
1998).Nowimaginethepairsswitchingpartnerstoform

dance, it is likely to lack the DEMO of the same culture
dancing.
We predict that like dancers from different cultures,
negotiators from different cultures will share a holistic
view of DEMO negotiation process that will lead them
throughsimilarcooperativeandcompetitivestages.Like
dancers from different cultures, DEMO also expect negotia-
tors from different cultures to enact different behavioral
sequences at the bargaining table, leading to difﬁculty
in synchronization and inefﬁcient deals. Our research
tests these ideas in four ways. First, we develop a four-
stage model of negotiation that captures the progres-
sion of competitive DEMO cooperative elements over time
in mixed-motive negotiation. Second, we consider that
DEMO particular behaviors that negotiators enact in each of
the stages are shaped, in part, by negotiators’ cultural
backgrounds. Third, we predict the particular stages and
behavioralsequencesthatshouldgenerateefﬁcientdeals.
Finally, we test the universalizability of our hypotheses

With the remarkable growth in cross-border ventures
and the effects of DEMO global trade, researchers
are building a systematic knowledge base devoted to
DEMO cultural differences and their effects on
organizations and management (e.g., Tsui et al. 2004).
What has received far less attention in the DEMO
are the microprocesses, like negotiations, that give rise
to these ventures. To date, much of the research on
cross-border negotiations has focused on identifying the
differences in behaviors that stem from negotiators’ cul-
tural backgrounds. DEMO this paper we move beyond that
emphasis to present a general model of the progression
of negotiators’ behaviors over time, which we examine
by studying the transcripts of negotiating dyads from
four high-context cultures (Hong Kong, Japan, Russia,
and Thailand), four low-context cultures (the United
States, Germany, Israel, and Sweden), and two mixed
cultures (DEMO States–Hong Kong and United States–
Japan). These data provide unprecedented scope for
testing hypotheses about culture, time, and negotiator
behavior. Moreover, because such a design inevitably
generates within-group variance, it provides a very con-
servative test of our hypotheses.
On the practical side, our ﬁndings will help managers
understand how to prepare for and execute successful
global business DEMO An understanding of the
etic negotiation dance coupled with an understanding of
the emic behavioral sequences of the dance in differ-
enttypesofcultureswillallowcross-culturalnegotiators
to advance DEMO negotiation strategically from one stage to
another and ultimately to an optimal conclusion.

represent distinct entities and want to DEMO a good deal

actional negotiations typically pass through four key
stages: relational positioning, identifying the problem,

and support a four-stage negotiation model.
Early theorists hypothesized that most negotiations
begin with a focus DEMO power, with one negotiator trying
to sway the other party (Stevens 1963). Empirical stud-
ies, however, showed that successful negotiators even-
DEMO move away from power and focus their efforts

OrganizationScience16(DEMO),pp.33–51,©2005INFORMS
on coordination and cooperation (Pruitt 1971, 1981).
DEMO a simple two-stage model, the ﬁrst half of nego-
tiation seemed DEMO be more competitive, characterized
by high demands and posturing, and the second half
was more cooperative, characterized by lower demands
and quicker concessions. In recent years, more com-
plex,multi-issuenegotiationsituationsandmoreprecise
behavioralmeasurementtoolshavepromptedresearchers
to expand upon the two-stage competition-cooperation
model. Advocates of a three-stage model describe peri-
odsofspiritedconﬂict,tacticalmaneuvers,DEMO
alternativestoﬁnalagreement(PutnamandJones1982b,
Morley and Stephenson 1977). Empirical investigations
of these models indicate a gradual progression from a
morecompetitivetoamorecooperativefocus.
However, widely accepted theory that negotiation is
mixed-motive (Walton and McKersie 1965, Lax and
Sebenius DEMO) suggests that negotiators do not just
become more cooperative over time. DEMO after getting
informationonthetable,negotiatorsengagedinproblem

as they try to claim value for themselves (Lytle et al.
1999). Recent empirical work suggests that negotiators

to a more cooperative focus throughout the negotiation
(Olekalns et al. 1996, 2004), which argues in favor of
further expanding the three-stage model.
We propose a four-stage model that portrays a more

tion of cultural differences in negotiators’ behaviors at

The model we propose is a sequential-stage model,
a prototype representing the DEMO progression
of complex, integrative transactional negotiations. In a
sequential-stagemodel,changeoccurswhenactorsmove
between DEMO and is evident in behavioral frequency
changes (Arrow et al. 2004)DEMO To study the content of
stages and the transition between stages, DEMO
haveusedboth event-driven and interval-driven aggrega-
tion strategies to determine breakpoints between stages
(Zaheeretal.1999).Becauseeachapproachhasbeneﬁts
and liabilities, the research question is the best guide DEMO
choosing the most appropriate approach.
Researchers using an event-driven approach identify
clusters of similar behaviors within a dyad and mark
a transition when one DEMO ends and another begins
(Holmes 1992, Putnam and Jones 1982b) DEMO look at
group decision paths and subsequent group processes
(Poole and DEMO 1989a, b; Olekalns et al. 2004). The
strength of the event-driven approach is that it cap-
tures both similarities and differences between DEMO
The three-stage negotiation model of problem initiation,
problem solving, and DEMO resolution was developed
using an event-driven approach. One limitation of the
Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral DEMO in Negotiation
OrganizationScience16(1),pp.33–51,©2005INFORMS
event-driven approach is the inability DEMO test general
models. The event approach divides the negotiation into
many phases based on content, and phases can repeat
themselves. Thus, each negotiation DEMO its own unique
progression of phases. The only way a general model
can be built is if content phases evolve similarly across
many different DEMO Yet the very nature of the
event-driven approach, which inextricably links DEMO
and content, makes it difﬁcult to identify general phases
across negotiations DEMO to test for differences in between-
group processes.
In contrast, researchers DEMO the interval approach
relyontheorytoidentifythenumberofstagesandtran-
sition points a priori and then test whether the content
of these intervals ﬁts their theory. This approach typi-
cally DEMO time or number of speaking turns as the unit
todivideintoequalstages.Theintervalapproach,there-
fore, separates stage and content, such that any stage
may be deﬁned DEMO any content. The approach takes
into account negotiations of different length; DEMO quar-
ters of interactions are ﬁrst quarters regardless of the
how long the interactions take. The interval approach
is also powerful in testing between-group DEMO
because it allows comparison within and across compa-
rable stages. Since our research question asks whether
wecancharacterizenegotiationswithafour-stagemodel
and then identify culture-speciﬁc patterns within those
DEMO, the interval-driven approach is most appropriate
for this study.
We propose DEMO negotiators have normative models
of the negotiation process that both inﬂuence how they
begin a negotiation and serve as a benchmark for mon-
itoring DEMO progress. Speciﬁcally, we expect that nego-
tiators will have a more DEMO focus both in the
initial stage, when they deﬁne relationships and DEMO,
and again in the third stage, when they make task-
DEMO arguments to support their offers and claim
value. Negotiators will have a more cooperative focus
both when they are bringing information about pref-
erences, needs, and priorities to light and when they
are in the process of exchanging offers to close a deal.
Thus, we propose a four-stage model of complex trans-
actional negotiations in which behaviors representing
relational positioning, identifying the problem, generat-
ing solutions, and reaching agreement will peak DEMO this
sequential order. In the next sections, we build on prior
DEMO ﬁndings of negotiation processes over time to
arguethatthesestagesaredeﬁnedbydistinctbehavioral
sequences, and follow DEMO evolutionary norm.
Prior research has identiﬁed three types of behavioral
sequences that capture whether negotiators are moving
insync:reciprocalsequences,complementarysequences,
and structural sequences (Donohue 1981, Olekalns and
Smith 2000, Putnam and Jones 1982a, Weingart et al.
1990). As the name suggests, reciprocal sequences
occur when a negotiator responds to a cooperative
35
or competitive behavior with a DEMO similar behavior.
For example, one negotiator asks for sympathy (a
competitive-inﬂuence behavior) and the other responds
with his or her own plea for sympathy. Reciprocity of
competitivebehaviorindicatesamoredistributivefocus,
andreciprocityofcooperativebehaviorindicatesamore
integrative focus (Weingart et al. 1999, Putnam 1990).
Sequences are deﬁned as complementary when a nego-
tiator responds to a cooperative or competitive behav-
ior with a different but DEMO similar behavior.
For example, one negotiator provides some informa-
tion about DEMO priority (a cooperative-information behav-
ior) and the other responds by using that information
in a proposal (also an information behavior). Com-
plementary sequences indicate similar strategic focus,
particularly in international negotiations when parties
DEMO similar intentions with different normative kinds
of behavior (Adair et al. DEMO). Structural sequences
occur when negotiators use behaviors from different
strategic groups. For example, one negotiator makes a
threat (a competitive-inﬂuence behavior) and the other
respondswithanoffer(acooperative-informationbehav-
ior). Structural sequences often indicate one negotia-
DEMO attempt to refocus the other. For example, it is not
unusual DEMO negotiators to use an interest-based coop-
erative response to a power-based competitive behav-
ior to redirect a distributive-minded negotiator (Brett
etal.1998,PutnamandJones1982a).Weusereciprocal,
structural, and complementary sequences to deﬁne four
distinctstagesthatweproposecharacterizetheevolution
of transactional negotiations.
First Stage: Relational Positioning
Empirical studies document the presence of both com-
petitive posturing (Simons 1993, Lytle et al. 1999) and
relationship building (DEMO and Keros 2002, Moore
et al. 1999) in the ﬁrst quarter of a negotiation inter-
action. At the outset, most negotiators know what they
wantandassumetheotherpartywantstheopposite(the
ﬁxed-pie bias) (Thompson and Hastie 1990). Therefore,DEMO
itisnotsurprisingthatnegotiatorsbeginnegotiationsby
testing whether the other party is going to be competi-
tive or cooperative before they begin revealing informa-
tionaboutpositionsandintereststhatshouldmovethem
towardagreementbutcouldmakethemvulnerableifthe
other is competitive. DEMO are two general approaches
to determining relationship in negotiations: Parties can
DEMO a little sensitive information about their prefer-
ences and priorities to signal cooperation and the will-
ingness to develop trust. Alternatively, parties can exert
inﬂuence and establish position to signal a competitive
negotiation.
All of the DEMO and three-stage negotiation models
cited above (Morley and Stephenson 1977, Pruitt 1981,
Putnam and Jones 1982b) concur that most negotiations
begin with competitive, spirited posturing that should
36
be characterized more by inﬂuence than by informa-
tionexchange.Effortstoestablishapowerfulnegotiation
position should DEMO evident in persuasion and inﬂuence
communications.Becausenegotiatorsdonotyethavean
understanding of the other side’s positions, needs, and
interests, it would be difﬁcult at this stage to make per-
suasive arguments that draw on rational argument about
the issues. DEMO, at this early stage, negotiators should
focus on inﬂuence with respect to status and power.
Affectivepersuasionisaninﬂuenceappealbasedonsta-
tus,relationships,andnormativeorothercontextualfac-
tors(AdairandBrett2004,Glennetal.1977).Thiskind
DEMO inﬂuence is particularly characteristic of posturing at
the start of transactional negotiations when negotiators
lack detailed information that can be used in rational
argument.
DEMO sequences of affective persuasion are
indicative of posturing and positioning when negotia-
tors are trying to establish power. Even if most negotia-
tions begin DEMO way, if negotiations are to progress, the
emphasis on power and position must wane over time.
Tocontinuetoengageinreciprocalpersuasionriskstak-
ing the negotiation into a no-win DEMO spiral (Brett
etal.1998).Asthefutilityofreciprocatingaffectiveper-
suasion inevitably becomes clearer, negotiators should
abandon reciprocity and turn to structural sequences
linking persuasion to search for information DEMO each
other’s preferences and priorities. We expect this transi-
tion to structural sequences to begin in the ﬁrst stage of
thenegotiation.Astructuralsequencethatsendsastrong

DEMO
The message that is conveyed is, “I am willing to risk
DEMO information to initiate some cooperation here.”
Weexpectthesestructuralsequencesofaffectivepersua-
sion and priority information to occur most frequently
in the ﬁrst stage of negotiation, when negotiators try to
transitionfromadeterminationofthecooperativeversus
competitive nature of their negotiation relationship and
who is more DEMO to a focus on the substance of
their negotiation.
Hypothesis 1. Reciprocal sequences of affective per-
suasion will be more common in the ﬁrst DEMO of a
negotiation than in the other three stages.
Hypothesis 2. Structural sequences of affective per-
suasion and priority information will be more common
DEMO the ﬁrst stage of a negotiation than in the other three
stages.

OrganizationScience16(1),pp.33–51,©2005INFORMS
Second Stage: Identifying the Problem
As noted above, the ﬁrst negotiation stage is char-
acterized primarily by relational posturing. Yet, when
negotiators inevitably sense that they are not making
progress, they should shift gears and turn their attention
to the issues at hand. Thus, the second stage is marked
byadetaileddiscussionoftheissues.Exchanginginfor-
mation about issues and interests is an integral part of
integrative negotiation. In fact, prior research has found
anearlyfocusoninformationexchange(Donohue1989)
and interests in disputing dyads (Lytle et al. 1999) is
anessentialprecursortoagreement.Frustrationwiththe
posturing and lack of progress that is characteristic of
the ﬁrst stage should move negotiators into the second
stage.
DEMO expect the second stage of negotiation, identi-
fying the problem, to be characterized by reciprocal
exchangeofpriorityinformationasnegotiatorsfocuson
the negotiation issues, options, and underlying DEMO;
build trust; and begin a serious search for an agreement.
DEMO sequences of priority information should
decrease after the second stage, because DEMO informa-
tion about interests and priorities is available, negotia-
tors can DEMO to structuring a deal and claiming value
(Olekalns and Smith 2000)DEMO
Hypothesis 3. Reciprocal sequences of priority
information will be more common in the second stage
than the other three stages of the negotiation.
Third DEMO: Generating Solutions
Again, we expect the evolution of the negotiation itself
totriggeratransitiontothethirdstage.Bynownegotia-
tors should have some understanding of the other side’s
preferences and DEMO and a good sense of whether
agreement is possible. At this point we expect nego-
tiators to begin to make offers. However, we do not
expect that negotiations will remain purely cooperative
untilagreementisreached,assuggestedbythetwo-and
three-stage negotiation DEMO If they did, the majority
of negotiations would result with something DEMO to
the pareto-optimal solution, which we know is not typ-
ically DEMO case (Thompson 1990, 1991). Negotiators are
concerned with both value creation and value claiming
(Lax and Sebenius 1986). And they must balance the
interplay between cooperative and competitive tactics
throughoutthenegotiation(Olekalnsetal.1996).There-
fore, we expect that after priorities and interests have
been revealed in Stage DEMO, negotiators will turn again to
more competitive-inﬂuence strategies, positioning them-
selvestoclaimmoreoftheultimateagreement(Olekalns
and Smith 2000, Wilson and Putnam 1990).
We propose that the third stage of negotiation will be
a distinct, energetic, even DEMO stage, with parties
shifting between a focus on integrating information and
DEMO

OrganizationScience16(1),pp.33–51,©2005INFORMS
is supported by empirical ﬁndings DEMO positional strate-
gies peak two-thirds of the way through a negotiation
(DEMO et al. 1996). At this stage of the negotiation,
partiesbegincraftingoffersbasedontheirowninterests
and priorities and the information they gathered about
theotherparty’sinterestsandprioritiesinStage2.Faced
with an offer DEMO the other party, negotiators’ attention
turnsbacktotheirpowerandposition.Theycomparethe
offer on the table with DEMO goal, their limit, and their
alternatives, deciding whether to accept DEMO reject the
offer,and—ifthelatter—howtopersuadetheotherparty
to improve the offer. We expect persuasion in Stage 3
will rely on rational inﬂuence that appeals to facts or
DEMO (Adair and Brett 2004, Glenn et al. 1977).
The reason is that by this stage negotiators have sufﬁ-
cient information about the DEMO party’s interests and
priorities to use in rational persuasion. For example, DEMO
seller might say, “Your offer is too low—our ﬁnancial
reportsandmarketrankingsforthepastthreeyearsshow
the DEMO is worth much more.” Thus, we expect
the “spirited conﬂict” (Putnam and Jones 1982b) of the
third negotiation stage to be characterized by structural
sequences of offers and rational inﬂuence.
Structural sequences can send different DEMO
A structural sequence of an offer followed by rational
inﬂuence may signal negotiators’ attempts to continue
searching or to delay settlement (Olekalns and Smith
2000). However, a rational argument followed by an
offer may signal the opposite: “Let’s stop arguing and
get this thing settled. Here is my offer.” To use these
sequences, negotiators must have enough information to
makereasonableoffers,butnotsomuchinformationthat
allrationalargumentshavebeenstated.Therefore,these
rationalinﬂuence-offersequencesshouldfollowthesec-
ond stage of priority information exchange but DEMO
theﬁnalnegotiationstage,whennegotiatorshammerout
adealthroughtheexchangeofoffersandcounter-offers.
Hypothesis 4. Structural sequences of rational inﬂu-
ence and offers will be more common in the third quarter
of a negotiation DEMO in the other three quarters.
Fourth Stage: Reaching Agreement
Bythetimenegotiatorsreachthefourthstage,theend—
DEMO agreement or no agreement—is in sight. At
this point, parties work DEMO reduce alternatives and move
toward a ﬁnal decision (Morley and Stephenson DEMO,
Putnam and Jones 1982b). They have exhausted ratio-
nal persuasive arguments for why they should get more
value, but they are still focused on getting a good deal.
Thus, as deadlines loom, negotiators DEMO more offers
and more concessions (Olekalns et al. 1996, Lim and
Murnighan 1994, Moore 2004). In this stage negotiators
reject the other party’s offer by making a counter-offer
ratherthanengaginginpersuasion.Theexchangeofsin-
gle and multi-issue offers in DEMO sequence in the
37
fourthandﬁnalstageofnegotiationservestwopurposes.
By this time negotiators should have sufﬁcient informa-
tion to construct offers and to be reasonably conﬁdent
that an DEMO is possible. So offers in the fourth
stage serve both to reach an agreement and to try to get
as much out of that DEMO for oneself as possible.
Hypothesis 5. Reciprocal sequences of offers will be
more common in the fourth stage of a negotiation than
in the DEMO three stages.
Culture and the Negotiation Dance
Culture is a socially shared meaning system (Geertz
1973, Triandis 1972). Culture is complex; it consists of
a group’s subjective characteristics, for example, values
and norms, and objective characteristics, for example,
artifacts and institutions (Brett 2001, Lytle et al. 1995).
Themanysidesofcultureareevidentinimplicittheories
aboutnegotiationthatguidewhatstrategiesandavenues
are available to negotiators (Brett and Okumura 1998,
GelfandandMcCusker2001,MorrisandGelfand2004).
For example, both cultural values and norms are evi-
dent in a negotiator’s implicit theory that distinguishes
DEMO relative priority of individual versus organizational
goals or the appropriateness of asking the other party
for sympathy. Therefore, although the functional stages
of a normative negotiation model may be universal (or
etic),weexpectsomeofthebehavioralcontentofstages
to be DEMO (or emic). To predict the culture-
speciﬁc aspects of the DEMO model, we turn to
Hall’s(1976)theoryoflow/high-contextcommunication
and especially communicative DEMO in high context
cultures.
Communication norms in Western cultures emphasize
direct communication and are thus, considered low con-
text. In contrast, communication norms DEMO Eastern cul-
tures are indirect and high context (Hall 1976, Gibson
1998). Low-context communication is more explicit,
with meaning clearly contained DEMO the words or the sur-
faceofamessage.High-contextcommunicationismore
implicit, with subtle meaning embedded DEMO and
aroundthespokenorwrittenwords.Extractingmeaning
from high-context communication requires second-level
inferential skills. For example, DEMO I make a multi-issue
proposal,alow-contextnegotiationpartnerwillhearmy
explicitwordsandextractdirectinformationaboutwhat
I want. In contrast, DEMO high-context negotiation partner
may use information in my multi-issue proposal along
withinformationinmypreviousproposalsandmyreac-
tions to her proposals to extract indirect information
about what my relative DEMO are. Social interaction
in high-context cultures hones these second-level infer-
ential skills to a degree unnecessary in a low-context
culture, when people may be willing to ask and answer
questionsdirectly.Ittakesnospecialinferentialskillsto
understand meaning in low-context cultures.
38
In addition to having different preferences for direct
and indirect communication, low- and high-context cul-
tures differ in the ease with which they DEMO switch from
oneformofcommunicationtotheother(Hall1976).We
expect that negotiators from high-context cultures will
be facile with both high- and low-context communica-
tion, whereas negotiators from low-context cultures will
be comfortable with low-context, but not high-context
communication. We propose that this variance in com-
munication ﬂexibility will be evident in DEMO
sequences of strategically similar behaviors that vary
in level of directness. For example, a complementary-
inﬂuence sequence might include affective persuasion,
which is indirect and refers to contextual factors, and
rationalinﬂuence,whichismoredirect,referringtofacts
and information.
Complementary sequences deﬁne a culture-speciﬁc
rhythm of the four-stage negotiation dance. If DEMO ﬁrst
negotiation stage is characterized by positional argu-
ments,high-contextnegotiatorsaremorelikelythanlow-
contextnegotiatorstocombinebothdirect,rationalinﬂu-
ence and indirect, affective inﬂuence in their positional
sequences. If the second negotiation stage is character-
ized by getting information on the table, high-context
negotiators are more likely to combine both direct pri-
ority statements and DEMO information through offers
in information sequences than low-context negotiators
are.Infact,weexpectcomplementarysequencestobea
signature rhythm of the high-context negotiation dance.
High-context dyads should use complementary infor-
DEMO and inﬂuence sequences more frequently than
low-contextdyadsthroughoutthenegotiation.Inmixed-
contextdyads,bothnegotiatorsarecomfortablewithlow-
context communication, DEMO the low-context negotiator
is not accustomed to using or interpreting high-context
communication.Thus,weexpectthathigh-contextnego-
tiators should refrain from using indirect, high-context
communication and should rely on direct, low-context
communication, the dyad’s common denominator. Con-
sequently,high-contextdyadsshouldalsousemorecom-
DEMO information and inﬂuence sequences than
mixed-contextdyads.
Hypothesis 6. Negotiators in high-context dyads will
use more complementary information sequences than
negotiators in low-context or mixed-context DEMO
Hypothesis 7. Negotiators in high-context dyads will
use more complementary inﬂuence sequences than nego-
tiators in low-context or mixed-context dyads.
Concluding the Negotiation
Onewaytomeasuresuccessintransactionalnegotiation
DEMO to tally the net value of the deal for the buyer and
seller to calculate joint gains (Tripp and Sondak 1992).
Joint gains are a measure of the entire pool of resources
negotiators created, not just how well one party did.
Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
OrganizationScience16(1),pp.33–51,DEMO
Prior research suggests two etic steps in the negotia-
tion dance that may help generate joint gains: recipro-
calpriorityinformationsharingandstructuralsequences
of affective persuasion and priority information. We go
further to propose two emic elements that are likely DEMO
facilitate joint gains in high-context cultures: reciprocal
offers and complementary information DEMO
Researchers have found that joint gains go hand in
hand with reciprocal information sharing about prefer-
encesandpriorities(OlekalnsandSmith2000,Weingart
et al. 1999). We DEMO this hypothesis based on our the-
orizing about the way the negotiation process evolves
overtime.Webelievethatreciprocityofpreferencesand
prioritiesisparticularlyimportantinthesecondstageof
negotiations. Recall that during the second stage, par-
ties disclose the information that will eventually allow
them to create joint DEMO Postponing reciprocal infor-
mation sharing to later in the negotiation may mean
that negotiators spend too much time positioning to
develop trust and that DEMO when information is shared
reciprocally, it is less complete or less DEMO understood.
Further, reciprocal priority information sharing should
generate joint gains regardless DEMO a dyad’s cultural com-
position,becausebothlow-andhigh-contextnegotiators
can understand and use information contained in direct
priority statements.
Hypothesis 8. Joint gains will be higher among
DEMO that engage in more reciprocal information shar-
ing in the second quarter of the negotiation than among
dyads that engage in less reciprocal information DEMO
in the second quarter.
Another behavioral sequence that should contribute
to the creation of joint gains is the structural sequence
of affective persuasion and DEMO information. This
proposition is supported by prior research showing that
successful negotiators are able to turn negotiations from
power to interests (Brett et al. 1998). If our hypothesiz-
ing about the emphasis on inﬂuence in DEMO ﬁrst stage is
correct, then negotiators who refocus their negotiation
from DEMO to priorities in the ﬁrst stage will be the
most likely to create joint gains. Again, we argue for an
eticeffect:Structuralsequencesofinﬂuenceandpriority
information early in the negotiation should be positively
relatedtojointgainsregardlessofadyad’sculturalcom-
position,becausebothlow-andhigh-contextnegotiators
needtomoveawayfrominﬂuenceandshareinformation
to reach DEMO optimal solution.
Hypothesis 9. Joint gains will be higher among
dyads that use more structural sequences of affective
persuasion and priority information during the DEMO
quarter than among dyads that use these sequences less
frequently in the ﬁrst quarter.
A third behavioral sequence that should contribute
to the creation DEMO joint gains involves sequences using

offers as information in high-context DEMO Research
indicates that U.S. and Japanese negotiators generate
equivalent joint gains, DEMO that the Japanese make offers
more frequently than the U.S. negotiators (DEMO et al.
2001, Brett and Okumura 1998). This research suggests
DEMO high-context negotiators who reciprocate offers or
use offers in conjunction with priority information can
gain an understanding of each others’ preferences and
priorities. As DEMO direct, priority information, we argue
that using reciprocal offers or complementary offer-
priority information sequences to generate information
must occur early in the DEMO, moving negotia-
tors away from the Stage 1 positional bargaining that
DEMO jeopardize trust and cooperation. Therefore, we
hypothesize that high-context negotiators who DEMO
in reciprocal offers or complementary offer and priority
information in the second stage of the negotiation are
more likely to create joint gains.
Hypothesis DEMO Joint gains will be higher for high-
context dyads that exchange more reciprocal offers in
the second quarter of the negotiation than high-context
dyads DEMO exchange fewer reciprocal offers in the sec-
ond quarter.
Hypothesis 11. Joint gains will be higher for high-
context dyads that use more complementary DEMO
information-offer sequences in the second quarter of the
negotiation than for high-context dyads that use fewer
complementary priority information-offer sequences in
the second quarter.
DEMO
Recall that we are interested in testing both the etic
and emic aspects of a four-stage evolutionary negotia-
tion model. To do this, we parsed each dyad’s negoti-
ation into four equal-length stages, where the length of
a stage was determined by the number of interactions
divided by DEMO The dyad was the level of analysis. To
measure negotiator focus within each negotiation stage,
we used the frequency of different types of DEMO
(A’s behavior–B’s response) as the unit of analysis.
Interacts, contingent DEMO patterns, are the funda-
mental unit of social behavior (Weick 1969). In negoti-
ations, one party acts and the other party reacts, and the
reactionservesasthestimulusactionfortheﬁrstparty’s
subsequent reaction, and so on (Weick 1969). Theoret-
ically, interacts are a more appropriate unit of analysis
than behaviors because they reﬂect patterns of negotia-
tion behavior between members of the DEMO (Brett et al.
2004, Donohue 1981, Putnam and Jones 1982a)DEMO
Sample and Data Collection
Tables 1 and 2 describe the three samples used in the
study. The low-context sample consists of dyads from
four DEMO that have been classiﬁed theoretically and
empirically as low context: Germany (N = 20 dyads),
Israel (N = 18 dyads), DEMO (N = 24 dyads), and the
39
United States (N = 27 dyads). The high-context sam-
ple consists of dyads from DEMO cultures that have been
classiﬁed theoretically and empirically as high context:
Hong Kong Chinese (N = 18 dyads), Japan (N = DEMO
dyads), Russia (24 dyads). The mixed-context sample consists of DEMO = 36 dyads), and Thailand (N =

exercise (Tenbrunsel and Bazerman 1995) about the
sale of syndication (rerun) rights for 100 episodes of
a children’s cartoon, Ultra Rangers. The syndication of
cartoons across national borders is common, because
cartoon characters transcend ethnic identity and speech
is easily dubbed. There were DEMO necessary compo-
nents to a deal: price of each episode, ﬁnancing terms,
and runs (the number of times each episode may be
shown during the ﬁxed ﬁve-year contract). Price was
a distributive issue. DEMO and runs were issues to
trade off (the seller wants payment DEMO front and the
buyerwantsmoreruns).Inaddition,thereweretwohid-
den creative issues: (a) DEMO second cartoon, Strums, was a
compatible issue offering value to both parties; and (b)
different rating expectations offered an opportunity for
DEMO bet or contingent contract (full details on the parties’
positions, limits, and alternatives are available in Adair
et al. 2001).
We assigned participants to roles and gave them

tureplayingthesamerole.Wethenassignedparticipants
to one-on-one dyads, and they had up to 90 minutes to
negotiate. Participants audio recorded their DEMO
Some dyads reached agreement prior to the 90-minute
deadline. After the negotiation, participants reported

with a lecture on negotiation strategy.
Coding and Analyses
As negotiation tapes were transcribed, they were orga-
nized by speaking turn (all of one person’s speech until
thenextpersonbeganspeaking).Foreignlanguagetapes
(Russian and Japanese) were translated and transcribed
by one person, and a person ﬂuent in the pertinent
language monitored this process. Four coders trained
together, then calibrated and recalibrated themselves
as they coded the data over a two-year time DEMO
Coders unitized the data by coding up to ﬁve unique
thoughtunits(subject-verbphrase)ineachspeakingturn
but did not assign more than one code per thought unit
(Weingart et al. 1993). Differences in the number of
thought units DEMO within a speaking turn were recon-
ciled in training and were accounted for in reliability
testing.

From the theoretical perspective we were DEMO a
mixed-motive, deal-making negotiation task with both
distributive and integrative elements (McGrath 1984).
Becausewewereinterestedinhownegotiatorsexchange

task)andexertinﬂuence(relevanttothedistributiveele-
ment of the task), we coded transcripts for DEMO
tion and inﬂuence behaviors. We used the code that
Adairandcolleagues(2001)developedfrompriortrans-
actional negotiation coding schemes (e.g. Weingart et
al. 1990) to capture DEMO and low-context communica-
tion in mixed-motive transactional negotiation. For the
presentstudy,wewereinterestedinfourstrategicgroups
of behaviors: priority information, offers, affective per-
suasion, and rational DEMO To operationalize these
four strategies we selected behavioral codes that ﬁt with

four strategic categories was kappa =071, which is in
the “good” range according to Bakeman and Gottman
(1997).
Priority information is deﬁned as information that
reveals negotiators’ preferences for an issue or priorities
among issues. We operationalized priority information
with DEMO indicators. Direct statements about prefer-
ences and priorities explicitly convey priority informa-
tion to the other party. “Yes” and “no” reactions to the
other DEMO offers also provide information on one’s
priorities, especially if these reactions DEMO tracked over
time. Noting common interests or areas where parties
have different objectives is a third means of conveying

were operationalized with two indicators. Single-issue
offersincludedanyproposalrepresentingonlyoneofthe
ﬁve possible issues in the negotiation simulation. Multi-
DEMO offers included any proposal representing two or
more of the ﬁve possible issues.
Affective persuasion is deﬁned as contextual (i.e.,
referring to social norms or information from the exter-
nal environment, as opposed to facts about the task) or
emotional appeals. We operationalized affective persua-
sion with three codes. First, asking for sympathy is an
appealtotheotherparty’semotionsornormsforfairness.
Second, referring DEMO the status or prestige of oneself or
one’s company appeals to social norms to defer to those
with high power or status. Third, referring to the status
of one’s competitors is also a relational power argument
DEMO
Rational persuasion is deﬁned as appeals based on
task-relevant factors, for DEMO, market data support-
ing the strength of one’s position. We operationalized
DEMO persuasion with three indicators. References to
limits with respect to negotiation issues conveys one’s
inability to make more concessions, and references to
the presence of alternatives (i.e., other potential buy-
ers or sellers) conveys one’s power to walk away from
the table. Argument included informational persuasion
about DEMO one party needed something. Substantiation
included informational persuasion about why the other
party needed something.
Thedependentvariableswerethehypothesizedstrate-
gic sequences, or pairs of actions and responses.
Details on methods for constructing and measuring
reciprocal sequences are reported in DEMO (2003). We
used the same method to code reciprocal priority DEMO
mation,reciprocaloffers,reciprocalaffectivepersuasion,
complementary information, complementary persuasion,
structural priority DEMO persuasion—
and structural offers—rational inﬂuence. In constructing
these sequences, we did DEMO distinguish which behav-
ior was the action and which the response, DEMO our
hypotheses focus on patterns and are not directional.
There were relatively few speaking turns with multiple
thought units (6.8%). However, because DEMO speaking turn
could have up to ﬁve thought units, two speaking DEMO
were occasionally coded as more than one type of
sequence (0.66%)DEMO For example, a speaking turn that
containedbothrationalpersuasionandanoffer,followed
by a speaking DEMO that contained an offer, was coded
as both reciprocal offer and DEMO offer—rational
persuasion.
We aggregated the time series sequence data for each
dyad into four quarters based on the total number of

mation sequences in the second DEMO predicted joint
gains across cultures. Further, as proposed, we identi-
ﬁedseveralculture-speciﬁc(emic)elementsinhowlow-

These ﬁndings DEMO to negotiation research as
well as to emerging research on culture and communi-
cation in the context of interpersonal interaction. The
results extend theory DEMO the evolution of negotiation by
supporting a four-stage model that captures the com-
plexinterplayofcooperativeandcompetitivebehavioral
sequences that characterize mixed-motive negotiation
and by demonstrating linkages between DEMO
sequences in the ﬁrst two stages of the model and nego-
tiation performance (i.e., joint gains). The results also
extend the theory DEMO culture and communication in the
context of negotiation by providing empirical conﬁrma-
tion of predictions based on Hall’s (1976) theory about
theﬂexibilityofhigh-contextcommunication.Below,we

dance, has a universal ﬂow that is enacted DEMO culture-
speciﬁc behavioral sequences.

functional sequences as the unit of analysis, we were
able to identify four distinct negotiation stages. The
focus of the ﬁrst stage was DEMO competitive than later
stages as negotiators contended for power and inﬂuence
using relatively more sequences involving affective per-
suasion than in other stages. The DEMO of the second
stage was more cooperative than the ﬁrst, as DEMO
turnedtotheissuesandreciprocatedpriorityinformation
aboutwhatissuesweremoreandlessimportanttothem.
The focus of the third stage returned to competition,
as negotiators engaged in a dance of offering solutions
and supporting or DEMO them using rational argu-
ments. The focus of the fourth stage was similar to that
of the third stage but decidedly more intense, as nego-
tiators worked toward agreement by building on each
other’soffers.Negotiatorsincreasedtheiruseofrecipro-
cal offers DEMO structural sequences of offers and rational
inﬂuence in the fourth quarter.
Our data generally support the four-stage model we
proposed but also suggest some DEMO and cultural
complexities that we did and did not anticipate.
Results that did not fully support the four-stage
modelwepredictedrelatedprimarilytothefourthstage.
For example, we predicted that structural sequences of
rational persuasion and offers would increase in a more
DEMO
tivefourthquarter.Thethird-quarterpredictionwassup-
ported,butcontrarytoexpectations,structuralsequences
of rational persuasion and offers continued to increase
along with reciprocal offer sequences in the fourth
quarter. Thus, both the third and forth quarters were
characterized by structural sequences involving rational
persuasion DEMO reciprocal offers; the difference was that
these sequences occurred with greater DEMO, i.e.,
represented a greater portion of the overall interactions
inthefourthquarterthanthethirdquarter.Itappearsthat
DEMO distinction between the third and fourth quarters is
less in terms of content of communication than in terms
of the intensity of communications.
We DEMO found some cultural differences that suggest
emic or culture-speciﬁc aspects of our four-stage nego-
tiation model. For example, the increasing frequency of
structural sequences of rational persuasion-offers across
Stages 3 and 4 was primarily evident in DEMO
and mixed-context dyads; in high-context dyads levels
of these structural sequences DEMO in the fourth
stage (supporting our original prediction). Also, the fre-
quency of reciprocal priority information that peaked
in the second quarter DEMO all dyads increased again
in the fourth quarter for low-context dyads. Thus, the
etic characteristics of the fourth stage are an increase
in reciprocal offers; the emic aspects are a decrease
in structural rational persuasion-offers in high-context
dyads and an increase in reciprocal priority information
in low-context dyads. DEMO more culture speciﬁc, or
emic, enactments of our four-stage negotiation model
support prior research suggesting that some types of
interaction are more appropriate DEMO high-context inter-
actions and others are more appropriate for low-context
interactions (DEMO 2003).
It should also be noted that the strategies we coded
did not clearly distinguish a ﬁrst stage for high-context
dyads. There was DEMO one type of interaction that
was signiﬁcantly more common in Stage 1 than in
subsequent stages for high-context dyads. We offer
two possible explanations DEMO this empirical ﬁnding: In
Stage 1, high-context dyads may have engaged in a lot
ofdifferentbehaviorswithoutaparticularstrategicfocus
or sequencing pattern, or they may have focused on a
strategy that was not captured by our code. In other
DEMO, we may need different, culture-speciﬁc codes to
capturetheindirectandrelationalinteractionpatternswe
expect from high-context dyads at the onset of nego-
tiation. For example, the ﬁrst stage of negotiations for
high-context dyads may be characterized more by rela-
tional DEMO building than by affective persuasion. Such
“getting-to-know-you” rhetoric would not be captured
with the code we used and should be considered in
future research.
DEMO our results indicate some qualiﬁcations and
areas for future research, they DEMO generally support
our sequential four-stage negotiation model. Negotiators
movedthroughthesefourstagesregardlessofhowmuch
time they spent negotiating, supporting our argument
46
for a normative, functional stage model of negotiations.
Althoughnegotiatorshadadeadlineof90minutes,some

ourdatasuggestasequentialmodeldrivenbyfunctional
stages rather than time. Our ﬁndings suggest that the
prototypeweidentiﬁedshouldapplytocomplex,mixed-
motive negotiations, regardless of how long the negoti-
ations last.
Our results show that, as predicted, the frequency of
certain DEMO sequences waxes and wanes over time.
For example, reciprocal sequences of DEMO persua-
sion occurred most often in the ﬁrst negotiation stage.
That is not to say that negotiators relied exclusively on
these sequences. Nor do DEMO claim that the ﬁrst stage
is dominated by these sequences. In fact, overall nego-
tiators spend more time exchanging information than
engaging in attempts to inﬂuence the other side. Nev-
ertheless, the data reveal that negotiators’ focus shifts
throughout the negotiation. Rather than a gradual shift
from competition DEMO cooperation as predicted in previ-
ous models (e.g., Putnam and Jones 1982b, Morley and
Stevenson 1977), we documented that the use of coop-
erative and competitive strategies shifts throughout the
negotiation. In this way, the four-stage model we pro-
posed captures the struggle that negotiators experience
DEMO
ting a good deal for themselves.
We suggest that this fundamental four-stage negotia-
tion model is a norm or a prototype that guides nego-
DEMO through an evolutionary process, just as music
and choreography guide dancers DEMO stages to a cli-
max. Dance often follows an ABA or ABAB format
that represents movement between contrasting themes.
Negotiations too have distinct stages DEMO lead to a
climax (Holmes 1992), and negotiators visit contrast-
DEMO themes as they move between the four negotiation
stages. Empirical support of a four-stage negotiation
model bolsters our understanding of the dynamic inter-
play DEMO competition and cooperation in mixed-
motive negotiation.
Culture in the Negotiation Dance
Based on Hall’s (1976) account that high-context com-
municators are skilled DEMO both direct and indirect forms
of communication, we hypothesized and found DEMO
high-contextnegotiatorsusedmoreﬂexible,complemen-
tary information sequences than low-context negotia-
tors.Thus,thedistinctionbetweenlow-andhigh-context

communicationinnegotiationisnotjustinthefrequency
of what is said (Adair et al. 2001), but also in the
scope and ﬂexibility of how DEMO communicate.
By gleaning information on the other party’s interests
both directly from priority information statements and
indirectly from offers over time, high-context negotia-
tors have more choices in how they enact the coopera-
tive stages of DEMO negotiation dance. This suggests that
they may be more able than low-context negotiators to
gatherinformationwithoutsignalingpurecooperationto
the other party through reciprocal priority information
statements.
Inadditiontoourﬁndingswithrespecttocomplemen-
DEMO information sequences, we found that high-context
negotiators reciprocated offers, a culturally normative
behavior (Adair et al. 2001), more and priority infor-
mation less than low-context negotiators throughout
all four stages of the negotiation. Last, high-context
negotiators used fewer structural affective persuasion-
priorityinformationsequencesthanlow-contextnegotia-
tors. These ﬁndings support DEMO prediction that indirect,
high-context negotiators are less likely than direct, DEMO
context negotiators to engage in priority information
sharing.
Our results revealing culturally emic elements of the
evolution of negotiations across four stages and cul-
DEMO differences in how negotiators glean information
in negotiations suggest that negotiators, DEMO dancers,
move in sequences of steps that are associated with a
cultural milieu. “A student of East Indian dance would
not dream of DEMO to learn the intricate steps, the
complex hand gestures, the myriad rhythms of Bharata
Natyam without knowing something about the Hindu
religion, some words in Sanskrit and Hindi, and how
to wear a sari” (DEMO 1982). Because some negotia-
tion processes are also culture speciﬁc, DEMO with
someone from another culture requires understanding
the other party’s communication and interaction norms.
Negotiators in high-context cultures use more diverse
and ﬂuid strategic DEMO than negotiators in low-
context cultures. Just as it will take time for a Cuban,
who is accustomed to the rapid, staircase movements of
Latin social dancing, and an American—accustomed to
smoothwalkingdanceslikethewaltz—togetinsync,it
will take time for cross-cultural negotiators to synchro-
nizetheirmovements.Infact,ourdatashowthatmixed-
context dyads took longer DEMO same-context dyads to
develop patterned behaviors.
Another question for dancers and negotiators from
different cultures is who will adapt to whom. Our
resultsshowedthatmixed-contextdyads’sequentialpat-
terns DEMO more like the patterns of low- than high-
context dyads, which DEMO attributed to the less-ﬂexible
low-context negotiators. Their lack of familiarity with
the sequences that are normative in high-context nego-
tiations means that their repertoires DEMO not contain

47
these patterns. Thus, when confronted with normative
high-context behavior, they responded in unpatterned
ways. We suggest that negotiators’ repertoires of strate-
gic sequences in negotiation are like implicit DEMO,
andinamixed-culturesetting,bothindividualﬂexibility
and dyadic similarity will likely inﬂuence how negotia-
tors enact and/or adjust their behaviors (Resnick et al.
1991).
Negotiation Outcome
What negotiators do in the ﬁrst half of the negotiation
has DEMO signiﬁcant impact on their ability to generate inte-
grative solutions with high joint gains. These ﬁndings
contributetoourknowledgeofprocessesleadingtosuc-
cessfulnegotiationoutcomesintwoways.First,wehave
identiﬁed a particular type of DEMO sequence that
produces high-quality outcomes, namely affective per-
suasion and priority DEMO Second, we have pin-
pointed when these structural sequences and reciprocal
DEMO information sequences should occur to gener-
ate the desired outcome effect. That negotiators must
passthroughthesestagesandenactthesebehaviorsearly
in the negotiation is an important and novel ﬁnding.
DEMO negotiators do not get to priority information sharing
by the negotiation midpoint, joint gains may be elusive.
A four-stage negotiation model therefore offers impor-
tantpredictorsofjointgainswithindistinctstagesofthe
ﬁrst half of a negotiation interaction.
The results also demonstrate that DEMO cultures,
direct priority information sharing is superior to indirect
informationsharingviaoffersforgeneratingjointgains.
Across all four negotiation stages, even high-context
dyads did not glean enough information from recipro-
cal offers or complementary offer-priority information
sequences to maximize their DEMO gains.

Opportunities for Further Research
Thedesignchoicesforthisstudy,includinghowweoper-
ationalized time, culture, and strategic sequences, pro-
vided a conservative test of the hypotheses. We divided
the total number of interactions into quarters based on
the objective DEMO of the length of the negotiation,

doubt generated within-category variance. The concep-
tually meaningful results demonstrate the utility of the

There are several other ways DEMO measuring group
processes and conceptualizing time (see McGrath and
Rotchford1983,Arrowetal.2004)DEMO
support and expand our sequential four-stage model.
Here we mention three: DEMO event-based aggregation
approach, individual conceptualization of time, and
holistic views of time. Negotiators with a longstanding
relationship may move through the ﬁrst stage DEMO rela-
tionalpositioningmorequicklythannegotiatorsmeeting
for the ﬁrst time. An event-based aggregation approach
(e.g., Poole and Roth 1989a, b) could be used to test
factors DEMO as prior relationship that cause dyads to
move through these four sequences with different paces
and/or rhythms. There are also differences in how DEMO
viduals view time; for example, monochronic cultures
have a more short-term and linear view of time than
polychronic cultures (Hall 1983). Particularly in cross-
cultural negotiations, how people conceptualize time
may affect the organization and ﬂow of stages in group
processes(Walleretal.2001).Also,becausestagemod-
els of DEMO assume that change is a function of peo-
ple’s internal clocks, DEMO do not account for exter-
nal forces that may affect processes and transitions.
For example, in models of entrainment, individuals and
groupsrespondtoorganizationalandenvironmentcycles
(Ancona and Chong 1996). Some of these more holis-
tic views of DEMO might help account for variation in
the four-stage model in different organizational con-
texts.Also,wehopethatfutureresearchwillempirically
demonstrate whether a four-stage model describes the
same negotiation DEMO better than a three- or two-
stage model—analyses that went beyond the scope of
this research.
Although we concluded that our mixed-context dyads
did DEMO low-context dance because the high-context nego-
tiators were more ﬂexible communicators than low-
context negotiators, we cannot rule out the facts that
these negotiations occurred in a low-context environ-
ment and in the English language. These DEMO could
have contributed to cuing low-context communication
patterns.Itwouldcertainlybeappropriatetotakealook
at the mixed-context negotiation dance embedded in a
high-context environment and/or in a high-context lan-
DEMO We would look particularly at the reciprocation
of offers over time for evidence that in a high-context
culture, mixed-context negotiators appear to negotiate
likehigh-contextnegotiators.Futureresearchmightalso

vidual negotiators’ sequence initiation and response in

Implications for Negotiators
Conceptualizing DEMO as dance is a powerful tool
to help negotiators understand the interdependent and
temporal nature of the negotiation process. Negotiators
who understand the choreography DEMO the negotiation
dance should be able to use it as a standard to judge the
quality and progress of the negotiation. Just as negotia-
DEMO use their best alternative to a negotiated agreement
tojudgethequalityofasettlementproposal,theyshould
be able to judge, or even manipulate, the progress of
the negotiation by DEMO the type of response their
strategic behaviors are eliciting. For example, DEMO nego-
tiator offering priority information that is answered by
affectivepersuasionwillknowthattheotherpartyisnot
yet ready to move to Stage 2. A negotiator making a
settlement offer that DEMO answered by rational inﬂuence
will know that the other party is not yet ready to move
to Stage 4. On the other hand, a negotiator may be able
to move the negotiation to Stage 4 by DEMO an
offer with a counter offer rather than responding with
rational inﬂuence.
It may be challenging for a single person to negoti-
ate and DEMO the progress of the negotiation simul-
taneously. Yet a designated negotiation strategist, like
in hostage negotiations (Misino and Contu 2002), could
monitor DEMO communication and convey to the primary
negotiatorthetypesofsequencesbeingused:reciprocal,
complementary, or DEMO; the strategies underlying
thosesequences:informationorinﬂuence;andhowmuch
time has elapsed using those DEMO and strategies.
Negotiators who understand the choreography may use
it to identify when a negotiation is headed in the wrong
direction so they can DEMO measures to redirect the con-
versation. Negotiators may also rely on the choreogra-
phy to tell them if they are spending too much time DEMO
a particular stage.
We think that negotiators from low-context cultures
will be disadvantaged in the global marketplace by
their inability to communicate in or DEMO high-
context communication. The question is whether we
can teach low-context negotiators to master the steps
and sequences of a high-context negotiation dance. Can
DEMO negotiator who has been acculturated to low-context
communication learn to infer information from the pro-
gressionofoffers?Certainlyawarenessandpracticewith
high-contextcommunicationiscalledfor,butwilllearn-
ing and ﬂexibility ensue? Although the literature on
training negotiators to overcome their cognitive biases
does not DEMO a basis for optimism (Thompson et al.
2000), unless low-context DEMO learn how to draw
inferences from high-context communications, they will
be DEMO a disadvantage in the global marketplace.

1 Larger patterned DEMO of behavior may also be deﬁned.
A double interact (Weick 1969) would consist of three units
of behavior: A’s behavior, B’s response, and A’s response
to B’s behavior. However, as the length of the sequence
increases, so does the number of different sequences pos-
sible, DEMO with a comprehensive behavioral code the num-
ber of possible sequence combinations increases exponen-
tially and the frequency of occurrence of any one type DEMO
sequencegoesdown.Therefore,theunitofanalysisforstudy-
ingtheevolutionarydevelopmentofanegotiationisatrade-off
against the frequency with which a unit can possibly occur
and the length of the pattern captured by that unit and DEMO
number of different behaviors coded. Using the interact as a
unit of analysis is standard convention in negotiation process
research, and even methods exploring longer chains of behav-
ior have found the interact the most powerful DEMO parsimo-
nious method of measuring dyadic behavior (Weingart et al.
