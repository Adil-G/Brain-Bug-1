Abstract
Imagine that you own a ﬁve-outcome gamble with the following payoffs and DEMO: ($100, .20; $50, .20;
$0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). What happens when the opportunity to improve DEMO a gamble is provided by a
manipulation that adds value to one outcome versus another outcome, particularly when the opportunity to add
value to one outcome versus another outcome changes the overall probability of a gain DEMO the overall probability of
a loss? Such a choice provides a DEMO test of the expected utility model (EU), original prospect theory (OPT), and
cumulative prospect theory (CPT). A study of risky choices involving 375 respondents indicates that respondents
were most sensitive to changes DEMO outcome values that either increased the overall probability of a strict gain or
decreased the overall probability of a strict loss. These results indicate DEMO support for OPT rather than CPT and
EU under various assumptions about the shape of the utility and value and weighting functions. Most importantly,DEMO
the main difference between the various expectation models of risky choice occurs for outcomes near the reference
value. A second study of risky choice DEMO 151 respondents again demonstrated the sensitivity of subjects to
reducing the probability of a strict loss even at the cost of reduced expected value. DEMO, we argue that
theories of how people choose among gambles that DEMO three or more consequences with both gains and losses
need to include measures of the overall probabilities of a gain and of a loss.

The past ﬁfty years have seen much theoretical and empirical work devoted to developing
and DEMO models of risky choice behavior. However, developing a descriptive model of
DEMO decision-making has proven much more difﬁcult than originally assumed. In particular,
“the issue of a suitable descriptive theory for gambles with three or DEMO consequences is
very much up in the air” (Luce, 2000, DEMO 286). This is unfortunate, since many important
decisions involve risky DEMO with multiple outcomes.
This paper provides evidence that any descriptive theory of choice among gambles with
multiple outcomes will need to include measures of DEMO overall probability of a gain and
the overall probability of a loss. Although the psychological meaningfulness of constructs
reﬂecting the overall probabilities of winning DEMO losing may seem obvious, such constructs
are not part of the DEMO expected utility model nor of more recent nonlinear expectation

models such as Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) or Cumulative Prospect
theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). Thus, at a minimum, the traditional expectation
models of risky choice will need to be modiﬁed, when applied to multi-outcome gambles,
to include a component that reﬂects the overall likelihood that one wins or loses with a
DEMO
The paper is organized as follows. First, some notation used throughout DEMO paper is
introduced, along with a discussion of various expectation models DEMO risky choice behavior.
Next, results by Fennema and Wakker (1997), Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981),
and Lopes and Oden (1999) using experimental tests related to that used in the DEMO paper
are discussed. Third, two experimental tests of risky choice behavior DEMO participants
choose which outcome’s value to augment are described. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion of the implications of the results for model DEMO and the methods used to
examine multi-outcome risky decision-making.
1.1. The risky choice task
Imagine that you are faced with a set of two DEMO more gambles (prospects or lotteries) of the
form g j = (x1, p1; ...; xn , pn ), denoting an option that yields outcome $xi with probability
pi , i = 1,..., n, n > 2. Further, arrange the prospect so that the DEMO are ranked from
rleast to best in terms of preference order,i such that outcomes below ri are perceived (coded) as losses and DEMO at or abovex1 ≤···≤ xn . Finally, deﬁne a special outcome
DEMO are perceived as gains. One conclusion that has been reached from the past two or more
decades of decision research is the almost universal DEMO for people to distinguish gains
from losses. It is usual to set ri = 0(a status quo or no change in wealth outcome)DEMO Thus,
agxk <...<amble might have the form (xn , and where the reference outcomex1, p1; ... ; xr , xprr ;may or may not be a realizable outcome.... ; xn , p DEMO ), where x7 < x2< ··· <xr <
Agamble that has at least one outcome above r and at least one outcome DEMO r is typically
referred to as a mixed gamble. When faced with a decision involving the choice between
two or more multi-outcome mixed gambles, how do people decide which gamble to choose?
1.1.1. The expected DEMO model. The classic answer to the question of how people should
select among gambles is based on some form of expectation theory, such as the expected
utility model (EU). At a process level, the DEMO model assumes that the decision maker
proceeds as if he or she ﬁrst assesses the attractiveness (utility) of a potential consequence of
agamble, then weights the utility of that potential consequence of a gamble by DEMO likelihood
of occurrence, then repeats that same process separately for all DEMO outcomes, summing
the weighted utilities over all possible consequences to arrive DEMO an overall (expectation)
utility for each gamble in the choice DEMO, and then chooses that gamble with the largest
expected utility.1 The DEMO of separable valuation implies that the contribution of a “branch”
of the decision tree (a speciﬁc probability-outcome combination) should be independent of
the DEMO of the other branches (Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum, 1992).
The classic assumption is that the utility function used in the maximization DEMO expected
utility is one based on total wealth and is one that is concave (risk averse) everywhere. A
value (utility) function that DEMO based on changes in wealth and that is risk seeking for losses
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE 7
(convex) and risk DEMO for gains (concave) is assumed by Prospect theory (Kahneman and
DEMO, 1979), discussed next.2
1.1.2. Prospect theory. The main “behavioral” alternative DEMO the expected utility model
has been Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), denoted OPT for original prospect
theory. As noted, OPT assumes a value function for outcomes that exhibits diminishing
sensitivity as one moves DEMO from a reference point in either direction (a positive change
or DEMO negative change), implying a concave function for gains and a convex function for
losses. In addition, OPT assumes that the value of each outcome is weighted by a decision
weight π (p) that is DEMO nonlinear function of the probabilities of each outcome. Similar to the
EU model, OPT assumes that the combination of values and decision weights follows the
general bilinear form.
Prospect theory was originally formulated for simple mixed DEMO with at most two
nonzero outcomes. A variation of OPT designed to apply to multiple outcome gambles is
discussed next.
1.1.3. Cumulative prospect theory. DEMO 1992, Tversky and Kahneman introduced Cumula-
tive Prospect theory (CPT). The key difference between cumulative prospect theory (CPT)
and original prospect theory (OPT) is the use of cumulative (rank-dependent) rather than
DEMO decision weights. That is, instead of transforming each probability separately,
DEMO prospect theory transforms the entire cumulative distribution for gains and for
losses separately and adds the results of the gains and losses valuations together DEMO obtain
an overall valuation for a mixed gamble. Note that cumulative prospect theory and other
rank-dependent utility models (Quiggin, 1982) and conﬁgural weighting models (Weber,
Anderson, and Birnbaum, 1992) depart from models DEMO EU and OPT by arguing that the
attention (weight) given to an outcome “depends not only on the probability of the outcome
but DEMO on the favorability of the outcome in comparison to the other possible outcomes”
of the gamble (p. 284, Diecidue and Wakker, 2001). Thus, the valuation of each outcome
of a gamble is no longer a completely separable process.
1.2. A test of OPT vs. CPT
Fennema DEMO Wakker (1997) point out that cumulative prospect theory makes some dif-
ferent empirical predictions in the case of multiple outcome gambles when compared DEMO
original prospect theory. In particular, they argue that original prospect theory (OPT) and
cumulative prospect theory (CPT) make different predictions for how people will respond
to an opportunity to improve a prospect by moving DEMO mass from a poorer outcome
to a better outcome. To illustrate, DEMO the following gamble, originally developed by
Lopes (1993) and discussed DEMO Fennema and Wakker in their experiment 2: The seven
possible outcomes DEMO the gamble are to be determined by the draw of one of twenty-one
lottery tickets. If tickets numbered 1, 2, or 3 are DEMO, one loses $300; if tickets 4, 5, or
6 are drawn, one loses $200; and so forth up to a gain DEMO $300 if tickets 19, 20, or 21 are
drawn. In other words, the outcomes and associated probabilities in terms of the number of
possible tickets are (−$300, 3 of 21; −$200, 3 of DEMO; −$100, 3 of 21; $0, 3 of 21; $100,
8
PAYNE
3of 21; $200, 3 of 21; $300, 3 DEMO 21). Now imagine that you have the opportunity of moving
one ticket (1 of 21) from any lower outcome to an adjacent DEMO outcome. A change of
the highest outcome was not included, so DEMO changes are possible. Which move would
you prefer to make? Subjects DEMO presented with all 15 possible pairs of such moves and
asked to indicate which move of the two they would prefer. Fennema and Wakker DEMO out
that OPT predicts that more subjects will prefer moving the middle outcomes than moving
the extreme outcomes given the assumed shape of the DEMO function. For instance, the
diminishing sensitivity of the loss value function DEMO that the −100 move is preferred
of OPT’s value function is that the 0 move is most preferred and the extreme move fromto the DEMO move which is preferred to the −300 move. For gain outcomes, DEMO implication
200 to 300 is least preferred.
In contrast, the weighting DEMO of CPT predicts that extreme-outcome moves will be
preferred. Since the cumulative form of prospect theory leads to greater decision weight for
equivalent probabilities DEMO they are associated with the extreme outcomes, this implies that
moving DEMO mass from the −300 outcome to the −200 outcome and from the 200
outcome to the 300 outcome will be most attractive. However, given that CPT incorporates
both the value function of OPT as well as DEMO new form of the weighting function, the
predictions of CPT will DEMO on the relative curvature of the two functions. Fennema and
Wakker argue that for the small amounts involved it is likely that the effects DEMO the weighting
function will be stronger.
The results presented by Fennema and Wakker (1997) favor CPT rather than OPT. The
majority of subjects DEMO the extreme-outcome moves for both gains and losses, thereby
supporting both DEMO need to incorporate a weighting function based on cumulative prob-
ability differences and the assumption that for small to moderate amounts the weighting
function DEMO would have a stronger impact on preferences.
The manipulation in Fennema and Wakker involved changes in the probabilities of the
outcomes and thus draws DEMO to those probabilities. What happens when the oppor-
tunity to improve a prospect is provided by a manipulation that adds value to one outcome
DEMO another outcome? A manipulation that adds value to one outcome versus DEMO
outcome is likely to make the gain versus loss distinction of prospect theory more salient.
The focus of our studies, however, is on DEMO more speciﬁc question of what happens when
the opportunity to add value to one outcome versus another outcome changes the overall
probability of a DEMO or the overall probability of a loss.
1.3. Prior tests of adding value to outcomes
The effects on risky choice behavior of adding value DEMO outcomes have been studied several
times over the past decades, e.g., a series of experiments by Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum
(1980, DEMO) and by Lopes and Oden (1999). In the Payne, DEMO, and Crum studies,
choice was studied when both gambles in DEMO pair were translated (shifted) by adding constants
(positive and negative) to all outcomes (a related procedure was used by Lopes and Oden).
Forexample, a typical choice was between the following two gambles: DEMO = (−$85, .4;
−gamble G2 is not a$30, .1; $14, .5) and G2mixed=gamble. In such a case, most people prefer G1. That is, people(−$45, .2; −$30, .5; −$20, DEMO). Note that in this pair of gambles,
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE
9
avoided the gamble (G2) that had no probability of a gain. Now add $60 to all outcomes,
yielding the two translated gambles G1’ = (−$25, .4; $30, .1; $74, .5) and G2’ = ($15, .2;DEMO
$30, .5; $40, .3). In this case, gamble G2’ is not a mixed gamble. The responses shifted
towards being strongly in DEMO of G2,’ the option that had no probability of a loss.
More recently, Lopes and Oden (1999) found that adding a constant to all the outcomes
of a pair of lotteries shifted preferences because DEMO new gambles within a pair had only
positive outcomes. In particular, DEMO were willing to take greater risks when all the
outcomes were positive. Thus, Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981) and Lopes DEMO
Oden (1999) suggest the need to include the probability of a gain or a loss in models of
risky choice for multi-outcome gambles.
DEMO summarize, cumulative prospect theory is an impressive intellectual achievement that
clearly DEMO some data, e.g., those of Lopes (1993) and Fennema and Wakker (1997), bet-
ter than original prospect theory. CPT also provides reasons for some degree of both risk
aversion and risk seeking in DEMO the domain of gains and the domain of losses, which
has DEMO observed. However, although it may be mathematically straightforward to ex-
tend DEMO theory and other forms of expectation theories to more complex gambles
with multiple outcomes by simply extending the summation operation to include all pos-
DEMO outcomes, such an extension misses an important psychological concept, namely the
overall probability of winning (receiving any gain outcome) and the overall DEMO
of losing (experiencing any loss outcome) offered by a gamble. With two or more out-
comes above and below a referent outcome, the overall probability of a loss is given by
p(x1) +···+ p(x j ) for values of x j < r = the DEMO outcome, and the overall probability
of a gain is given byby DEMO, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981), Lopes and Oden (DEMO), and Langer andp(xk ) +···+ p(xn ) for values of xk ≥ r .Overseveral decades, studies
Weber (2001), among DEMO, provide some evidence for the need to incorporate the overall
probabilities DEMO a gain or a loss into models of risky choice for multi-outcome gambles. The
studies reported in this paper extend previous work by adding DEMO to outcomes for pairs
of complex, mixed,gambles.
The ﬁrst study DEMO below investigates where people prefer to add value to an outcome
when they can only add value to one outcome of a multi-outcome gamble. DEMO we argue
below this task provides a way to examine the importance of the overall probability of a
gain or the overall probability of DEMO loss on risky choice behavior, and a way to distinguish
among DEMO expectation models of risky choice under various assumptions about the
form of the value function and the form of the probability-weighting function.
2. Study DEMO
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Stimuli. The gambles used in the present study involve ﬁve outcomes, with at least
two of the outcomes being gains and two of the outcomes being losses. Thus, the weighting
function for the gains and the weighting function for the losses will clearly differ depending
DEMO whether the function is assessed on a cumulative basis (CPT) or separately for each
outcome (OPT).

PAYNE
To illustrate, imagine that you own a ﬁve-outcome gamble with the following payoffs
and probabilities: ($100, .20; $50, .20; DEMO, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). How attractive would
DEMO ﬁnd that gamble if you had to play it for real money? Now imagine that I tell you that
you can change the gamble above in one of two ways. You can add $38 to the DEMO that
pays $100 or you can add $38 to the outcome that pays $0. That is, you can have either one
of the two new gambles: ($138, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; DEMO, .20; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20;
of the two new gambles would you prefer if you had to play one DEMO the two new gambles?$50, .20; $38, .20; −$25, DEMO; −$50, .20). Where would you add the $38? That DEMO, which
Notice that with an addition of value to the $0 DEMO, you also change the probability of
winning some positive amount of DEMO from .40 to .60 without creating the opportunity
for a sure gain.
Now consider the same base gamble ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20),
and imagine DEMO you can change the gamble above in one of two different ways. You can
add $38 to the outcome that pays $100 or you DEMO add $38 to the outcome that pays $50.
That is, you DEMO have either one of the two new gambles: ($138, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25,
add the $38? That is, which of the two new gambles would you prefer if you had to play.20; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20; $88, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). Where DEMO you
one of the two new gambles? While the change from DEMO to $88 might be more attractive
than a change from $100 to $138 in the sense of diminishing marginal value, the proposed
change does not change the overall probability of a positive outcome.
Now turn to DEMO slightly less attractive gamble, again a mixed gamble with ﬁve distinct
DEMO Consider that you own the gamble with the following payoffs and probabilities:
($100, .20; $50, .20; −$15, .20; −$40, DEMO; −$65, .20). How attractive would you ﬁnd that
gamble? DEMO that I tell you that you can change this gamble in one of two ways. You
can add $15 to the outcome where you DEMO $65 or you can $15 to the outcome where you
lose $15. That is, you can have either one of the two new gambles: ($100, .20; $50, .20;
−$15, .20; −$40, DEMO; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$40, .20; −$65, .20).
Where would you add the $15? Notice that in this case the probability of a loss remains at
.60 in the ﬁrst case and moves from .60 to DEMO in the second case.
Lastly, imagine that you own the same DEMO gamble ($100, .20; $50, .20; −$15, .20; −$40,DEMO
.20; −$65, .20) and can add $15 to either the DEMO outcome (−$65) or the intermediate
loss outcome (to a loss DEMO $50 might be more attractive than a change from a loss of $40 to a loss of $25 in−$40). Where would you add DEMO $15? While the change from a loss of $65
terms of DEMO weight placed on extreme outcomes, the proposed change does not change
DEMO overall probability of a positive outcome.
In general, classic EU theory, with the assumption of a concave (risk averse) utility
function everywhere, suggests that you would add to the lower valued outcome in either
DEMO gain or loss domain. OPT suggests that you would add to the intermediate ($0 or
−$15) outcomes. CPT suggests that you would add DEMO to the most extreme outcome
reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992)DEMO More generally, this prediction for CPT will(worst, −$65, or DEMO, $100) given the parameters for the weighting and value functions
be true as long as the curvature of the weight function is greater DEMO the curvature of
the value function.3 Thus, EU, OPT, and DEMO make unique predictions across the gain
and loss domains assuming commonly used parameter values. Whatever the shapes of the
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE 11
value function and the DEMO function, however, the hypothesized importance of overall
probability of a gain or the overall probability of a loss suggests that any change moving
DEMO zero outcome to a gain or a negative outcome to a zero outcome will be particularly
attractive.
2.1.2. Subjects. The 375 respondents were a DEMO of undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents from Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania who were compensated for
their participation in the study. However, there was no compensation directly tied to their
choices. The design was DEMO subjects, with the respondents randomly assigned to one
of four conditions (groups) described in more detail below.
2.1.3. Procedure. First each subject was presented with a single risky option and asked to
rate that option DEMO a scale ranging from −10 (an extremely unattractive gamble) to +10 (an
extremely attractive gamble) in terms of how attractive the prospect DEMO playing the gamble
for real was to the respondent. Scale values of −3, −2, and −1, and of 1, 2, and 3 were
labeled “slightly unattractive” and “slightly attractive” respectively. The purpose of this
DEMO was simply to ensure that the respondent would have thought about the base
gamble when they were asked to consider how to change the DEMO The respondent then
turned to the next page in the survey and read that he or she had the opportunity to change
the previous DEMO in one of two ways.
For one group of respondents this involved a gain base gamble with the following ﬁve
outcomes: $100, $50, $0, −$25, −$50, each outcome having an equal probability of .20.
Respondents in group 1 then had a choice between adding $38 to DEMO outcome that was a
win of $100 or adding $38 to the outcome that was a neither a win nor a loss ($0). The
two modiﬁed gambles were shown to the respondent on the page DEMO he or she was asked
which gamble he or she would prefer to play. Respondents were told that there is no right or
wrong DEMO and that the experimenter was interested only in their opinion about which
gamble of the pair they would prefer to play if they had DEMO play one of the two gambles for
real money. Thus, the DEMO response of interest was a single choice between two gambles.
The order of the gambles within a pair on the page was counterbalanced across DEMO A
second group of respondents did a similar task except that the addition of a value of $38 was
either to the $100 outcome DEMO the $50 outcome (group 2, same base gamble as group 1).
The base gamble for groups 3 and 4 differed in from DEMO in groups 1 and 2 in that the
ﬁve outcomes were $100, $50, −$15, −$40, and −$65, and therefore this loss base gamble
was stochastically dominated by the ﬁrst base gamble. Groups 3 and DEMO did tasks with the
addition of a value of $15 to either the −$65 outcome or the −$15 outcome (group 3); or
the addition of a value of $15 to either the −$65 outcome or DEMO −$40 outcome (group 4).
2.2. Results
2.2.1. Ratings of the DEMO gambles. First, since the subjects provided a rating of either
the DEMO or loss base gamble, it is possible to examine whether the DEMO of stochastic
dominance was supported across subjects. The mean rating for the gamble with zero as the
middle outcome (the stochastically dominating alternative) DEMO 2.78 (n = 217) on a −10 to

+10 scale. The mean rating for the gamble with a −$15 middle outcome (the dominated
gamble) was .78 (positive ratings for the gain gamble was 77%. The percentage of positive ratings for DEMO = 161), a signiﬁcant difference (t = 4.04, p <DEMO). The percentage of
loss gamble was 59%. The fact that the percentage of positive ratings and the overall rating
for the stochastically dominated DEMO was below the rating for the dominating gamble
is reassuring. This difference in ratings for the two base gambles suggests that the subjects
exhibited DEMO least some care when they answered the questions.
2.2.2. Choice of where to add value. Figure 1 provides a summary of the results on
DEMO people prefer to add value. The values in the four cells of Figure 1 for each of the
four groups of respondents are the DEMO of choices in each pair of gambles of the
gamble that should have been preferred under the assumptions of CPT and the parameters
for DEMO weighting and value functions reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). DEMO
reported in each cell in Figure 1 are the numbers of respondents for each condition (groups
1, 2, 3, and 4).
DEMO the cell in the upper left hand corner, reﬂecting the responses DEMO group 1. When
asked whether they preferred the gamble where $38 was added to the $100 outcome or
the gamble where $38 was added DEMO the $0 outcome, the clear majority of the respondents
indicated the DEMO Only 32% of the 105 respondents preferred the gamble consistent
with Cumulative Prospect Theory. Similarly, when respondents in group 3 were asked
whether they preferred the gamble where $15 was added to the loss of $65 DEMO or
the gamble where the $15 was added to the loss of $15 outcome (the lower left hand
corner of Figure 1), the clear majority indicated the latter. That is, only 33% of the 92
respondents in this condition chose consistent with CPT. Both choice proportions (32% and
33%) are signiﬁcantly different from .50 ( p < .01, DEMO test). This pattern of responses
is also not consistent with the EU model under the assumption that the utility function is
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE
13
concave everywhere. Neither is DEMO pattern of results consistent with the EU model under the
alternative assumption of a convex utility function for gains and a concave utility function
DEMO losses. On the other hand, the pattern of responses is consistent DEMO Original Prospect
Theory.
Now consider the cells on the right-hand side of Figure 1 for groups 2 and 4. Cumulative
Prospect Theory predicts a DEMO preference for adding value to the outcome that is the
extreme gain or the extreme loss. The choice proportions are close to .50 in DEMO cases.
Although both Original Prospect Theory and the Expected Utility model, DEMO the assump-
tion of a concave utility function, make slightly different DEMO in these two cases,
both theories predict preferences that are much closer to indifferent, which is basically
what was observed. The value differences between the gambles according to Cumulative
prospect theory are actually slightly greater DEMO the case of the choices facing groups 2 and
4as compared to the other two groups of respondents. However, the deviations from CPT
implied by the choices in the cells on the right-hand side of Figure DEMO for groups 2 and 4 are
weaker and harder to interpret statistically.
A Chi-square test of likelihood of choosing the gamble consistent with the DEMO
of CPT (the more extreme outcome improvement) shows that the pattern of responses was
signiﬁcantly different if the addition of value was to DEMO outcome at or near a reference value
of $0 as compared to when it was either a more moderate strict gain or a more DEMO
strict loss outcome (χ 2 = 12.76, p < .01). Adding a value to one gamble in such as way as
to DEMO increase the probability of a strict gain from .40 to .60 or to decrease the probability
of a strict loss from .60 to .40 DEMO to have been attractive to the respondents in groups 1
and 3. Adding values to outcomes in such a way as not to impact DEMO overall probabilities
of a strict gain or a strict loss was not as meaningful to the respondents in groups 2 and 4.
Finally, there was no indication that it mattered whether one was dealing with adding DEMO
again outcome or adding to a loss outcome. A Chi-square test of the likelihood of choosing
agamble consistent with the predictions of CPT showed DEMO signiﬁcant difference for gains
versus losses (χ 2 = .21).
DEMO summarize, the results from this study clearly support the importance of DEMO value
to outcomes in such a way as to impact the overall probabilities of a strict gain or a strict
loss. The next study DEMO whether the results from study 1 generalize to complex
gambles that do not involve the same probabilities for all ﬁve outcomes. Another question
is DEMO people will still prefer to add value to one gamble in such as way as to decrease
the overall probability of a strict loss DEMO when there is a cost to such behavior in terms of
loss of expected value.
3. Study 2
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Stimuli. The gambles DEMO involved ﬁve outcomes, with at least two of the outcomes
being DEMO and two of the outcomes being losses. Thus, the weighting function DEMO the gains
and the weighting function for the losses will again clearly differ depending on whether the
function is assessed on a cumulative basis (CPT) or separately for each outcome (OPT).

The ﬁrst gamble presented to the subjects in this study DEMO similar to that used in study 1.
That is, subjects were DEMO with the following gamble and asked to rate it on a scale
ranging from −10 (an extremely unattractive gamble) to +10 (an extremely attractive
gamble) in terms of how attractive the prospect of playing the gamble for real was to the
respondent. The payoff and probability values DEMO ﬁve outcomes in the base gamble were
as follows: ($85, DEMO; $65, .05;where they would prefer to add $25 if they could add that amount to one and only one of−$25, .25; DEMO, .15; −$90, .25). Subjects were then asked

outcome or to add $25 to thehave the same probabilities (.25) even through the other three outcomes have different−$25 outcome. Note that in this ﬁrst task both outcomes

G1 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; −$25, .25; −$55, .15; −$65, .25), or G2 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; $0,

and Kahneman (1992), CPT suggests that you would add value DEMO the most extreme bad

more extremechanges the overall probability of losing from .65 to .40. A preference for gamble G2 also−$90 outcome. On the other hand, adding $25 to the least bad outcome

The second task used in this study was a simple choice between the following two
gambles: G3 = ($90, .10; $70, .25; −$20, .20; −$30, .30, −$80, .15) and G4 = ($90, .10;
loss outcome that is $20 better than the DEMO outcome for gamble G4, and the probabilities$70, .25; $0, .20; −$50, .30; −$80, .15). Note that with gamble G3 DEMO have an intermediate
of those two intermediate outcomes for gambles G3 and G4 are both .30. The expected
value of G3 is $1.50. With DEMO G4 you reduce the middle outcome to $0 and thus the
overall probability of a strict loss from .65 to .45. However, since the probabilities of the
middle outcomes for both gambles are only .20, you are giving up $2 in expected value if
you select gamble G4 DEMO G3. The expected value of G4 isfor the weighting and value functions reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992), CPT−$.50. Given the parameters
suggests that you would prefer the added value be associated with the more DEMO, and
more extreme bad outcome (changing a loss of $50 to a loss of $30), i.e., G3. A concern with
the overall probability of a loss, on the other hand, suggests a preference DEMO gamble G4.
3.1.2. Subjects. The 151 respondents were a mixture of undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents from Duke University who were compensated for their DEMO in the study. All
subjects responded to both of the choice problems described above.
3.1.3. Procedure. The task for the subjects or respondents was DEMO very simple. For
the added value task that was similar to the task used in study 1 (choice between gamble
G1 and G2), the procedure was essentially the same. For the problem involving choice
between DEMO G3 and G4, the procedure differed slightly in that the subjects DEMO not
ﬁrst presented with a single risky option and asked to rate that option on a scale. Instead,
the task presented to subjects DEMO gambles G3 and G4 was a simple choice between
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE
15
two options. This was DEMO to see if a similar pattern of results would be found using a
procedure that is more like that used in the many previous DEMO of risky choice behavior.
The position of the gambles in a pair of gambles representing a particular choice problem
was counterbalanced across subjects.
3.2. DEMO
First consider the responses to the adding value task that was most similar to that used in
study 1. When asked to choose where DEMO would prefer to add value, a signiﬁcant majority
of the respondents (59%, N = 151, p < .05, binomial test) preferred DEMO add value to the
4
middle outcome near the likely reference value of neither winning nor losing ($0). That is,
gamble G2 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; $0, .25; −$55, DEMO; −$90, .25), was preferred to gamble
G1to that reported for the task in study 1 where the probabilities for all the outcomes DEMO the= ($85, .30; $65, .05; −$25, .25; −$55, .15; −$65, .25). This pattern of choice is similar
gamble DEMO equal. Adding a value to one gamble in such as way as to decrease the overall
probability of a strict loss from .65 to DEMO seems to have been preferred to adding the same
value to the more extreme bad outcome with an equal probability of occurrence.
Next, consider the responses to gambles G3 and G4. A strong majority of the DEMO
(71%, N = 147, p < .01, binomial test) DEMO gamble G4 over gamble G3. That is,
subjects preferred the gamble (G4) with a middle outcome of $0, and thus lowering the
overall probability of a strict loss from .65 to .45. Gamble G3, on the other hand, was not
preferred even though it had the higher expected value and the higher payoff on both the
more probable DEMO the more extreme bad outcome.
4. Discussion
Overall, the results from DEMO studies clearly indicated that respondents were highly sensitive
to changes in outcome values that either increased the overall probability of a strict gain or
DEMO the overall probability of a strict loss. The simple test of EU, OPT, and CPT that
is offered by giving a respondent a DEMO of where to add value to one of two outcomes
indicated more support for OPT than CPT and EU, under various assumptions about the
shape of the utility and value and weighting functions. However, it is clear that the main
difference between the various expectation models of risky DEMO occurs for outcomes near
the reference value.
As noted earlier, Fennema DEMO Wakker (1997) concluded that their data favored cumula-
tive prospect theory over original prospect theory. Why the difference between those results
and the DEMO results? As suggested earlier, the answer may be found in terms of a pro-
cedural difference between the two studies. Fennema and Wakker’s (1997) experiments
involved moving probability mass from one outcome to another outcome. It is likely that
the Fennema and Wakker procedure focused attention on DEMO Thus, any prefer-
ence for making the probabilities of the extreme DEMO better might have been salient.
In contrast, the present experiment involved DEMO value to one outcome or another. This
procedure may have focused attention more on the payoffs and their associated values,
16
PAYNE
particularly whether the outcomes were gains versus losses. However, while there are clear
differences between the results of Fennema and Wakker (1997) and the present results, it is
worth noting that the present DEMO are consistent with the ﬁndings Fennema and Wakker
report (see their DEMO 4 and 5) that the preference for shifting probability mass from DEMO
more extreme outcome was noticeably less when there was an opportunity to lower the
overall probability of a loss or increase the overall probability DEMO a gain. Also, the results
reported in the present study 2 DEMO that sensitivity to the overall probability of losing can
be found where the probabilities of the outcomes of a gamble are different, and therefore
more likely to be salient. In addition, the results of study 2 indicated a willingness to give up
some expected value (and Cumulative Prospect Theory value) in order to lower the overall
probability of a strict loss. Thus, the present results and the results reported by Fennema
and Wakker both point to the importance of the overall probability of a DEMO or a loss on
risky preferences.
4.1. The zero or reference outcome
It is clear from the present results and those of other researchers DEMO the distinction between
a strict gain and a strict loss is important. What is less clear is what to do about a reference
outcome DEMO is neither a strict gain nor a strict loss. A reviewer of this paper argued that
because the value function in CPT assigns 0 DEMO the reference outcome, it does not matter what
weight is attached DEMO the reference outcome. On the other hand, Luce and Weber (1986) have
proposed a model of perceived risk that distinguishes between the probability of breaking
even, the probability of a positive outcome, and the DEMO of a negative outcome. In
addition, Lopes and Oden (1999) DEMO ﬁndings that suggest people distinguish between a
zero outcome and a strict gain. Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum (1992) also suggest that
people DEMO zero outcomes as distinct. However, more study is needed to determine DEMO,
and how, a zero outcome might impact the assessed overall DEMO of winning or losing.
4.2. Implications for model building
In terms of models of risky choice, the present results are most consistent with SP/A theory
(Lopes and Oden, 1999). A key concept in DEMO theory is the probability of achieving an
aspiration level if a particular option is chosen. That overall probability of a “gain” is coupled
with DEMO dual-criteria decision rule that incorporates a weighted value component (denoted
SP DEMO a balancing of security (fear) with potential (greed)) with DEMO probability of achieving
an aspiration level component (denoted A). One DEMO also be able to incorporate the
importance of the overall probabilities of a gain or a loss into contingent weighting models
such as rank-dependent DEMO conﬁgural weight models (Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum,
1992), DEMO this does not seem straightforward. In particular, the present results suggest
DEMO effect of the rank order preference of outcomes on decision weights is not clear cut.
It is not the case that the lowest ranked DEMO is given the greatest weight nor is it the
case that the most extreme ranked outcome is given the greatest weight, particularly when
outcomes are near the reference value. At a more general level, the present results provide
IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE
17
another set of ﬁndings DEMO that the valuation of gambles is not a separable process
for each branch of the decision tree. Beyond rank order of outcome effects, people do seem
sensitive to the combined probabilities of a gain or a DEMO
4.3. Limits and directions for future research
Given the multiple studies of risky choice behavior that have been undertaken over the
past ﬁve decades, any single set of experiments such as the present one is limited DEMO
because it is not possible in any single set of experiments to cover all the factors that
have been shown to inﬂuence risky choice DEMO For example, one obvious question is
whether or not the effects DEMO in the present study would persist in the face of substantial
incentives. While providing positive payoffs is fairly straightforward, allowing subjects
to lose money is more difﬁcult. In addition, a review of the literature on incentives by
Camerer and Hogarth (1999) suggests that for relatively easy decisions DEMO those studied
in the present studies, real incentives are not very DEMO Nonetheless, repeating this
experiment with the opportunity for “real” gains and DEMO is clearly one direction for
future research. Another area for future research is whether the extremity focus captured
by models such as CPT increases DEMO the number of outcomes deﬁning a multi-outcome
mixed gamble. A hypothesis consistent with the general notion of limited attention capacity
is that the ﬁt DEMO CPT compared to OPT and EU will increase as the number of outcomes is
increased, particularly when adding value to intermediate versus extreme outcomes without
changing the overall probabilities of a gain or a loss.
5. DEMO
Much research on risky decision behavior has focused on the simplest types of “pure” risky
choice options of the form ($x , p, DEMO), where with probability p one receives $x > 0(again)
or $x < 0(a loss) or with probability 1 – p one receives 0 or on simple mixed gambles of
the form ($x , p, −$y). Obviously, with just one non-zero gain or DEMO outcome there is no
distinction to be drawn between the probability of an outcome (gain or loss) and the overall
probabilities of gain DEMO loss outcomes.
Although responses to simple gambles provide insights (see Fox DEMO See, 2003, for
a recent review) it is becoming clear DEMO descriptively the extension from the simplest
gambles to even slightly more complex types of gambles is not straightforward. This is
unfortunate in that many (most?) real world decisions under risk involve gambles that are
likely DEMO be mixed and to involve three or more non-zero outcomes. With multi-outcome
and mixed gambles, e.g., (−$x1, p1; −$x2 p2;$x3 = 0, p3;$x4, p4;$x5, p5), the present
research demonstrates that people are highly sensitive to the combined probabilities of
winning (e.g., p4 + p5) and the combined probabilities of a loss (e.g., p1 + p2).
Clearly there is a value in investigating gambles that are no more complex than nec-
essary to capture key psychological DEMO; however, simple two outcome gambles
that are either purely gains or losses may not be complex enough, as Lopes (1995) has
strongly argued. Gambles involving four or ﬁve-outcomes with at least two outcomes that
18
PAYNE
are preferred to a reference value and at least two DEMO that are not preferred to a
reference value are still relatively simple while allowing for more direct tests of models.
With ﬁve-outcome gambles, the ﬁfth outcome can be at the reference value. The increased
use of DEMO multi-outcome gambles in studies of risky choice behavior may bring our
descriptive theories for such choices more in line with human behavior in realistic DEMO
problems involving risk and uncertainty.

Notes
1. The proceeding provides a “process” story for risky choice behavior. Luce (2000), among others, has argued
that the expected utility model and its many variants are simply mathematical representations for observed
decisions that imply nothing DEMO how the decision was made. However, one can make predictions from DEMO
EU model about how choice will or will not change as a function of changes in the probabilities or payoffs
of the gambles in DEMO decision set.
2. Recently, Levy and Levy (2002) argue for DEMO utility or value function that is also based on changes in wealth
and is risk averse (concave) for losses and risk seeking (convex) for gains.
3. More speciﬁcally, this is true as long as DEMO relationship π (xn )/(π (xn−1 + xn ) − DEMO (xn )) is greater than
(of gains. Given the parameters DEMO the weighting functions and value functions reported by Tversky andV (xn−1 DEMO a) − V (xn−1 ))/(V (xn + a) − V (xn )) holds for a positive amount a and DEMO is in the domain
Kahneman (1992), the π ratio is DEMO 2.39 and the value ratio is about 1.07. A related condition holds for
the loss domain, where the π ratio is about 1.90 and the value ratio is about 1.07.
4. The number of subjects reported DEMO each task differs slightly due to a few missing responses.
