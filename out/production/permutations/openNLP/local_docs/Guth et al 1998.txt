The principal–agent DEMO is often illustrated by the relationship between owners and
managers in modern corporations. Our experimental study considers the problem where the
owner has to DEMO the manager by an employment contract serving the owner’s interest.
The contract specifies a salary and a share of the firm’s profit which depends DEMO the
manager’s effort and stochastic market events. The owner can only infer the firm’s
profitability from the dividend payments. The owner may terminate or DEMO the incentive
contract in later periods. The experiment relies on a parameter specification for which risk
neutral participants would cooperate efficiently, i.e. the owner should design a contract
rendering full effort as optimal. However, we observe contracts for which full effort is not
optimal and effort choices which DEMO not optimal. We observe trust and reciprocity as
important features of behavior which evolve over a multiperiod principal – agent relationship,
but do DEMO carry over to the next game with a new partner. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
INTRODUCTION
The standard example of a principal– agent prob-
lem is the separation of ownership and control in
modern DEMO A large literature on man-
agerial capitalism has been concerned with that
issue.1 It is argued that managers in corporations
with highly dispersed ownership DEMO more discre-
tion in pursuing their own interest even if it
conflicts with that of the owners. In this situation,
incentive contracts can DEMO designed by the owners
to motivate managers appropriately.2 Empirical
studies show that financial incentives are the dom-
inant element in management contracts.3 Al-
though DEMO theory suggests to relate incentive
pay to firm performance or owners’ wealth, there
is no agreement among empirical studies about
the pay-performance relationship. This leads
Jensen and Murphy (1990) to the conclusion that
‘. . DEMO the lack of strong pay-for-performance incen-
tives for CEOs (chief executive DEMO) indicated
by our evidence is puzzling’.4

Experimental studies may help to solve this
puzzle.5 In our experiment participants are con-
fronted with a dynamic principal–agent situation.
It exhibits features DEMO realistic principal – agent
problems like multiple periods, stochastic out-
comes, imperfect monitoring, contract design, lin-
ear reward schemes and downward rigidity DEMO
work contracts. Furthermore, the principal de-
cides on how long the DEMO lasts and the
agent knows more about the state of the enter-
prise than the principal.
The game has multiple equilibria, but we will
nevertheless outline a benchmark solution. We
will compare the experimental behavior with DEMO
solution, since this gives us some guidance for
evaluating results. However, the experiment is not
designed as a test of game theory. Our DEMO
motivation is to provide empirical facts showing
how financial incentives, exclusively DEMO by
most (normative) theoretical studies of principal –
agent problems, DEMO to compete with intrinsic
motivations, both of the principal and his DEMO,
as well as with social norms. We will see that the
players’ trust and reciprocity may be even more
important than relying on DEMO compatibility.

That trust and reciprocity are important behav-
ioral patterns DEMO certain circumstances was
also found in a related experimental study by
Fehr et al. (1997). In this experiment principals
simultaneously offer employment contracts, for at
most one worker, specifying a wage, a required
effort level and a fine which has to be paid if the
agent DEMO found (by chance) to be shirking, i.e. not
meeting the DEMO effort level. In a stochasti-
cally determined order workers can select a con-
tract where there are fewer firms than workers.
The worker then DEMO his effort level which,
finally, is monitored randomly.6
In our DEMO study pairs of players interacted
for several periods before they were matched with
new partners. This allows for reputation forma-
tion and in some DEMO for building up a corporate
identity. Furthermore, the principal has almost DEMO
direct means to monitor the agent. Thus, our
study sheds light DEMO the dynamics of trust and
reciprocity within relationships and across rela-
tionships, which was not investigated by Fehr et
al. (1997). The DEMO of reciprocity on behavior
in principal–agent games is also investigated by
Fehr and Ga¨chter (1997), who focus on the differ-
ence between one-sided and two-sided reciprocity.
Although our experimental game can be varied
by changing DEMO like the stochastic pro-
duction function, the cost function of the DEMO
and the time horizon, in this study we varied only
the DEMO value of the firm which is known to the
agent but not to the principal. By distinguishing a
high and a low value, where the a priori probabil-
ities are common knowledge, the agent with the
high value has the opportunity to hide low efforts.
Furthermore, principal and agent have conflicting
interests in the firm’s value. While the principal
wants DEMO preserve it, since he receives its final
value when the game DEMO, the agent wants to use
it for dividend payments, in case he participates in
these payments via a profit share.
In the section DEMO Design’ we de-
scribe the experiment in detail. Some behavioral
hypotheses are discussed in the section ‘Trust and
Reciprocity’. The section ‘Game Theoretical
Analysis’ DEMO the theoretical results for the
case in which both parties are guided only by
monetary incentives and are risk neutral. In the
section ‘The DEMO Data and Some Stylized Facts’
we present the raw data and some stylized facts,

and in the section ‘Analysis of Effort Decisions’
we analyse the agents’ DEMO decisions in detail.
The last section contains a summary.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The participants were divided into two groups of
players and seated in two DEMO lecture halls:
rooms A and B. Each B(oss) player DEMO the role
of the principal within a principal– agent game
and was paired with an A(gent) player. After
being seated participants received a letter of wel-
come which also assigned them their code num-
ber. DEMO we distributed written instructions7
which informed both players about the rules of
the game and that they would interact for at most
six periods DEMO = 1, 2,...,6.
In period 1 player B, the principal, has to
decide about the linear payment scheme (F1, 61),
the work contract he is offering to player A, the
DEMO The component F1 (in general, Ft ) is a fixed
wage which A receives in period 1 (period t ). It
does DEMO depend at all on what happens in t. The
component 61 (DEMO ) is a profit share (a share by
which player B DEMO in the dividend pay-
ment Pt in t ). In t DEMO 1 player B must offer at least
one contract (F1, ) with 0 5 F1 5 4 and

and can offer at most three contracts of which
one has to be accepted by DEMO A. In later
periods B can increase Ft and/or 6t, DEMO he cannot
reduce either one. Thus, in all periods (Ft, DEMO ) must
satisfy the following restrictions:
0 5 Ft 5 4  Ft ] Ft − 1
and



6t !0, 10 2 , 3 ,

6t DEMO − 1.
When A decides which work contract to accept
he does not know yet the initial value of the firm
(W1). However, it is commonly known that W1 is
low (W1 = 3) or high (W1 = 12) with probability
1/2 respectively.8 After DEMO choice among the of-
fered work contracts, he (but not player B) gets to
know the actual value of W1.
A now chooses his effort level at  {0, 1, 2, 3}
which causes cost

on A’s side.9 Then the current market DEMO at is
determined randomly—with at  {1, 2, 3} and
probability {at } = 1/3, respectively. The result of
the chance move is only disclosed to A. Player A’s
chosen effort together with the DEMO market
state determine the firm’s return Et with Et = atat.
The firm’s profit in t is Gt = Et − Ft. Finally, A
decides about the dividend payment (Pt ). In all
periods Pt DEMO satisfy the following restrictions:
0 5 Pt 5 Wt + Gt if Wt + Gt \ 0
and
Pt = 0 otherwise,
DEMO Wt is the firm value at the beginning of t
with W1 determined as above and
Wt = Wt − 1 + Gt − DEMO − Pt − 1 Öt \ 1.
Thus, the agent is DEMO to choose anything be-
tween no dividend payment at all or, DEMO the other
extreme, running down the firm value all at once.
DEMO firm value can actually become negative since
Gt can be negative in the case of a positive fixed
wage. But, nonetheless the game continues in such
a case. More importantly, notice that player B
neither observes the initial firm value, A’s effort
nor the market state. He only observes Pt and in
general this allows only imperfect inferences
about Wt DEMO well as at.
At the end of each period both players can
compute their period t incomes which are tA =
Ft + 6tPt DEMO K (at ) for player A and B = (1 − 6t )Pt
t
for player B. At the beginning of the next period
(t + 1) player B decides whether or not to DEMO
the fixed wage or the profit share or both. Either
way player A has to take (Ft + 1, 6t + 1)asitis. DEMO
chooses his effort at + 1 and the game proceeds in
the manner described above. Finally, there is a
termination rule which allows player B, at the
start of periods 4, 5, and 6, DEMO end the game. If he
doesn’t terminate the game it ends after period 6,
i.e. at the beginning of period 7.
Player A’s DEMO income is the sum of his period
incomes. Player B gets in addition to the sum of
his period incomes the end value (liquidation
value) of the firm. This is W7 if the game ends
after period 6 or W4, W5,or W6 otherwise. This
completes the description of the game.
Subjects played the game twice against chang-
ing opponents, but keeping their role. We had 64
© 1998 John Wiley & DEMO, Ltd.
participants who were students of economics or
business administration (undergraduates and
graduates). Thus, we collected 32 plays (one for
each DEMO pair) on each trial. Four
subjects, two principals and two agents, formed a
matching group, i.e. in the repetition they were
cross-matched DEMO their respective group.
Thus, the 32 observations of the second trial DEMO
not independent. Part of the statistical analysis
below will therefore be based on the 16 matching
groups.
All monetary values were denoted in so-called
DEMO (Experimental Currency Unit). The value
of one ECU was 0.50 DEMO in game 1 and 1.00
DM in game 2. The experiment took about 3 h.
Average earnings per subject were about 24.50
DM, about US$16 at the time of the experiment
(June 1995) for the DEMO games and included a 5.00
DM show-up fee. In the case of efficient game
playing the expected average earnings were 48.50
DM per subject, which is also the outcome ac-
cording to the game theoretic solution (see be-
low). While mean payments per hour were
relatively low, they were substantially different
between subjects ranging from about 3.10 DM up
DEMO 48.60 DM. Given this and the potential gains
in case of efficient (equilibrium) play, we consider
payment as salient.
After reading the instructions to the game, sub-
jects had to fill out a short questionnaire10 which
asked for a few personal characteristics (such as
nationality, sex, and student year) and, more im-
portantly, contained some control questions to
check whether subjects understood the rules of the
game.
TRUST AND DEMO
In economics one traditionally assumes rationality
and material objectives of the interacting parties.
In our experiment all material aspects are cap-
tured by monetary DEMO Some implications
of rationality based on these monetary incentives
will be derived in the next section. Before doing so
we want to develop two DEMO motives that
may guide subjects’ behavior: ‘trust’ and ‘re-
ciprocity’. Both DEMO generate behavior that is
inconsistent with the implications of rationality
and purely monetary motivation.
As demonstrated rather generally by ultimatum
bargaining experiments (see, DEMO a survey, Roth,
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327 – 341 (1998)
330
W. GUTH
1995), and more specifically by studies of employ-
DEMO relationship (see Fehr et al., 1997), human
decision makers are inclined to respond in kind.
They will invest considerable amounts of money
DEMO order to punish behavior that may be termed
‘greedy’, or they DEMO favorable acts.11 For the
experiment at hand this could occur when a gen-
erous contract, offered by the principal, is re-
warded by DEMO agent via a considerable work
effort.
Responding in kind has been phrased ‘reciproc-
ity’ (see Young, 1986, for an early reference).
Reciprocity as such means that someone’s behav-
ior is reciprocated later on by DEMO else. So,
reciprocity typically relies on sequential interac-
tive decision processes.12 Usually there is a party
moving second which can be said ‘to DEMO
by responding in kind. On the other hand, the
party moving DEMO can be said ‘to trust’ in the
other’s reciprocity, when choosing DEMO action that
makes sense only when it is reciprocated. An
illustrative example for trust and reciprocity is the
experiment by Berg et al. (1995), which, however,
offers extremely high incentives for cooperation
(the DEMO amount is tripled).
In our experiment trust is related to the princi-
pal offering a fixed wage. More specifically, a
higher fixed wage is considered a stronger signal
of trust. One might argue that even DEMO a
high profit share could be termed trust. However,
we think that the most salient way to express trust
is to offer a DEMO fixed wage and no profit share.
Furthermore, we do not yet DEMO trust and
reciprocity as sharp theoretical constructs that
produce unique predictions for a given game.
Rather we propose them as useful labels for ob-
DEMO behavior that carry some intuition. Also,
we like to contrast these motives and the associ-
ated behavior with the implications of rationality
and DEMO monetary motivation, so that our inter-
pretation seems useful.
In the DEMO analysis below, reciprocity
will be measured by the responsiveness of the
DEMO work effort to the size of the fixed wage.
We argue that on the basis of rationality and
purely monetary incentives there should be DEMO
significant influence, while this is called for by
reciprocity.
Trust and DEMO pose some interesting
questions for principal–agent theory.13 Specifi-
cally, an essential DEMO is whether these two
motives can be more important for determining

behavior than marginal monetary incentives on
which normative principal–agent theory is based
(see e.g. Hart and Holmstro¨ m, 1987).
GAME THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
The game is a dynamic game with incomplete
information. It exhibits hidden information and
hidden actions and DEMO has multiple equilibria. In
principle we could apply refinements14 of the equi-
librium concept or the theory of equilibrium selec-
tion15 to narrow down DEMO set of equilibria or even
propose a unique strategy profile as the solution
to this game. But, looking at the data (see below)DEMO
we found a great diversity of plays. Thus, any
unique prediction DEMO necessarily fail. Instead we
will discuss reasonable considerations for the
players’ choices and characterize a simple equi-
librium solution, assuming risk neutral players
who are only interested in their own monetary
wealth. We will refer to DEMO as the benchmark
solution of the game. We will also describe several
quite different game paths which are consistent
with equilibrium behavior to indicate DEMO mani-
fold of equilibria in this game. Although we will
later compare observable behavior with the solu-
tion outlined here, the experiment is not designed
as a test of game theory, but rather to develop a
positive theory of behavior in principal – agent
relationships based on experimentally DEMO
data.
Let us first investigate which dividend payment
Pt in the interval 0 5 Pt 5 Wt + Gt a rational
agent (player A) will select. Clearly, A has no
interest in preserving or even DEMO the future
value Wt + 1, at least for t = DEMO He should therefore
choose P6 = W6 + G6 if this is positive and P6 = 0
otherwise. In earlier periods t B 6 DEMO non-maximal
Pt could be justified since it might cause improved
future contracts (Ft, 6t ) or since one may expect a
higher dividend DEMO in the future. This, how-
ever, does not happen according to the game
theoretic solution. Thus, along the solution path
P* = Wt + Gt
Öt = 1,...,6. (1)
t
When the agent determines his effort at it seems
obvious that his choice depends DEMO the contract
(Ft, 6t ) he faces. Since marginal cost of effort are
1/2 and the expected productivity is 2, a risk
neutral agent chooses at = 3if 6t ] 3/10 and at DEMO 0
if 6t 5 2/10. Thus, given Ft and 6t DEMO agent’s best
reply behavior aˆ t (Ft, 6t ) can be characterized as

Given (2) the principal can induce maximal
effort by an appropriate choice of 6t. Therefore DEMO
the following we will refer to 6t ] 0.3 as an incen-
tive compatibility constraint. Nevertheless, an
agent might choose at = 3 although 6t 5 2/10, if he
expects 6t ] 3/10 for some period t\ t. In other
words, 6t = 3/10 is sufficient, but not necessary for
incentive compatibility in the long run. Notice
that aˆ t does not vary in the fixed wage component
Ft. DEMO a fixed wage will not increase effort in
the short run. Moreover, incentives can eventually
be reduced in the long run. This is possible since
a fixed wage reduces the firm value Wt. Over time
Wt DEMO become negative such that dividend pay-
ments and thereby the agent’s work incentives are
reduced.
We will show below that along the solution
path
DEMO = 3
t 10
holds and thus
a*t = 3 Öt = 1,...,6. (3)
Regarding the principal’s design of the work
contract (Ft, 6t ) suppose the solution path is
Öt = DEMO,...,6 (4)
F* = 0
t
6* = 3
DEMO Öt = 1,...,6. (5)
Paying a positive fixed DEMO or raising the
profit share would cause additional cost on the
principal’s side, but would not increase the agent’s
effort. Reducing 6t results in zero effort according
to (2). Given that (2) holds, DEMO the principal
chooses 6t B 3/10 at all, he should DEMO 6t = 0.
Shares 6t = 2/10 or 6t = 1/10 are clearly subopti-
mal. Thus, it needs to be checked only whether
6t = 0 could increase the principal’s profit. Addi-
tionally, it remains to be shown that the principal
is not interested in early DEMO of the game
along the solution path.
Before we do this we will specify a complete
strategy profile. Notice that (1), (3), (4) and (5)
together with
© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
331
‘No early termination’ (6)
determine a unique path of play which will be the
path of play of our DEMO solution. To show
that this is an equilibrium path we need to specify
supporting behavior at unreached information
sets.
Suppose that at all unreached DEMO sets
(1), (2) and (6) hold as well DEMO
Öt = 2,...,6 (7)
F*t = Ft − DEMO
and
6* = max! 3 , 6t − 1"
Öt = 2,...,6. (8)
t
10
To check that the proposed strategy profile is
indeed an equilibrium one might simply work
again through DEMO discussion of (1) to (5). It
remains to be DEMO that 6t = 0 and early termi-
nation are unprofitable for the principal. If 6t = 3/
10 the agent chooses at = DEMO thereby generating an
expected profit in period t of 6 ECU. Thus, the
principal gets
= 42
(1 − 6t )E {at }at 10 ECU (9)
each period such that 6t = 0 would reduce his
profit. Moreover this implies that he should not
terminate the DEMO Termination is possible in
periods 4 to 6. In such a case the principal re-
ceives the current firm value Wt which is zero DEMO
the time according to Equation (1), and gives up
positive DEMO profits given by Equation (9).
We will refer to this DEMO as the bench-
mark solution. It has a stationary equilibrium
path, DEMO compatibility is satisfied in each
period and maximal effort is chosen always. Thus,
the solution is quite simple and efficient. Notice
further that DEMO to the solution, dividend
payments may be shifted to earlier or DEMO periods
without affecting players’ payoffs. To render the
solution behavior more stable one could rely on
marginal impatience assuring that dividends will
be paid DEMO early as possible.
There are other equilibria, e.g. equilibria with
less DEMO maximal dividend payments and 6t B 3/
10 in early periods. Suppose Pt = 0 and 6t B 3/10
in the first DEMO periods and other than that every-
thing is the same as in the benchmark solution. In
this case it is still optimal for the DEMO to choose
maximal effort in the first two periods. He simply
carries the profits over to the third period and
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327 – 341 (1998)
t
332
pays them out then. It is also possible to construct
equilibria DEMO which the principal pays a fixed wage
in addition to a profit share.
In general, it is not obvious which equilibria or
equilibrium paths are eliminated by certain refine-
ments. The game has rather many information
DEMO and taking care of all contingencies is tedious.
However, one can DEMO see that paying a fixed
wage is excluded by the notion of perfect equi-
librium.16 In every completely mixed strategy pro-
file the behavior DEMO every information set
potentially matters. The agent’s choice of work
effort cannot rationally be conditioned on receiv-
ing a fixed wage. Thus, any equilibrium of the
perturbed game prescribes not to pay a fixed
wage, which establishes the result. Put differently,
paying a fixed wage can only DEMO sequentially
rational at information sets that are reached with
zero probability.
Another aspect one might take into account are
the players’ attitudes towards risk. DEMO far we
assumed risk neutrality for both players. Allowing
for different risk attitudes gives more leeway for
behavior that can be regarded consistent with
DEMO theoretic equlibrium concepts. In the experi-
ment, of course, we could have applied the binary
lottery technique, i.e. paying subjects in lottery
tickets, in order to implement risk neutrality.
However, we did not want DEMO overburden our
participants by introducing another stochastic
event. Besides there is evidence that the binary
lottery technique may be ineffective in inducing
optimal decision DEMO
THE RAW DATA AND SOME STYLIZED
FACTS
The experimental game underlying our study con-
stitutes a rather rich decision environment. It
generated the following DEMO:
 principal’s decisions
– design of initial contract offers
– contract changes
– termination of the game
 agent’s decisions
– selection among DEMO contract offers
– work efforts
– dividend payments.

ET AL.
that exhibits features of DEMO principal – agent
problems like multiple periods, stochastic out-
comes, imperfect monitoring, contract design and
downward rigidity of work contracts. These fea-
tures make the relation between work contracts
and work efforts as studied by DEMO – agent
theory less obvious for experimental subjects.
While we think it is important to study experi-
mental behavior in complex games this creates
DEMO difficulties for the statistical analysis. Within
a rich environment many factors might influence
behavior. Thus, when we try to discover the influ-
ence of one factor we need to control for the
influence of others. We DEMO this in detail when
applying regression analyses to explain the agents’
effort choices.
The analysis of the principals’ decisions is less
thorough. How he DEMO the contract conditional
on his experience within the repeated game seems
an interesting but complicated task. Especially,
here, principals could not reduce any component
of the contract18, and in addition they were al-
lowed to terminate the game in some periods.
Nevertheless, at first, we will DEMO describe
the raw data for all decisions and characterize
some observable features as stylized facts. Most of
these facts rely on mean data and DEMO descrip-
tive statistics, but some are behavioral hypotheses
for which we DEMO test statistics. Thereafter we
will turn to the analysis of effort decisions.
Initial Contract Offers
Eighty-one percent of principals in the first game
and DEMO in the second game offered their agent
more than one contract. The number of offers is
significantly reduced in game 2 (p = 0.059,
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, one-
tailed). More than 90% of principals offered posi-
tive fixed wages, i.e. among the contracts offered
by each single principal at least one exhibited a
positive fixed wage. The DEMO offered fixed
wage is significantly lower in game 2 (p = DEMO,
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, one-
tailed).
All principals, with one exception in game 2,
offered a positive profit share. Game DEMO contracts
were not significantly different from game 1 deci-
sions. However, DEMO fraction of offered contracts
that satisfy incentive compatibility as implied by
Equation (2) is smaller in game 2 than in game 1.
These DEMO are summarized as:

Stylized Fact 1 Contrary to the theoretical analy -
sis, initially offered contracts exhibit substantial
fixed wages and non -incenti6e compatible profit
shares. This holds e6en for experienced subjects, but
experience reduces the number of offers and the
a6erage fixed wage.
Choices DEMO Initial Offers and Self-Selection
Among those agents who received more than one
contract offer (F1, 61) 19% decided for the con-
tract with the highest profit share. All others,
given they had a choice, went for the highest fixed
wage. One can interpret this observation as DEMO
selection by agents. Agents who intend to choose
low effort levels obviously prefer a higher F1. For
this reason one should expect agents who DEMO up
some fixed wage for a higher profit share to
choose higher effort levels. This is actually the
case in period 1 (p = 0.006, Mann-Whitney U
Test, one-tailed). We did not check this DEMO later
periods since the effect of self-selection could be
confounded with other influences.
Stylized Fact 2 Subjects’ preferences for work con -
tracts are DEMO and seem related to their
intended work effort. In part, this DEMO signalled 6ia
self -selection.
Fixed Wages and Profit Shares
Table 1 displays means for fixed wages and profit
shares for each game and period DEMO Profit
shares and fixed wages increase over time which is

not surprising since by the rules of the game they
are not allowed to decrease.
Fixed wages are quite DEMO contrary to F * = 0.
Mean profit shares are below the incentive com-
patible level 6 * = 3/10 in the beginning DEMO
slightly above this level in the end. These observa-
tions lead to:
Stylized Fact 3 In general, work contracts differ
from the benchmark solution. Many principals pay
positi6e and increasing fixed wages. While some
profit DEMO are below the incenti6e compatible
le6el others exceed it. This holds e6en for experi -
enced players.

agents gave up money in favor of their principals.
That experimental subjects hesitate to fully exploit
their strategic advantage DEMO known from other
studies (see the survey of Roth, 1995). However,
looking closer at the data we found that in game
DEMO (game 2) out of 15 (14) agents who reached
period 6 only 2 (1) left a positive firm value. All
others DEMO it down to zero or had already run
it down earlier.
If the initial firm value is high the agent might
signal this—at least DEMO the principal
by choosing rather high dividend payments.19 But
instead average dividend payments are moderate
and a more detailed look at the individual data
DEMO that signalling in this sense hardly oc-
curred. These observations support:
Stylized Fact 5 Contrary to the benchmark solu -
tion, di6idend payments are less than maximal each
period. Agents do not signal a high DEMO 6alue. They
rather seem to a6oid this.
Termination of Games
Only about half of the plays lasted six periods. All
others were terminated earlier DEMO the principals.
Table 3 presents the relative frequencies for termi-
nation, DEMO on reaching periods 4 to 6. It
exhibits a quite sharp increase at the end of both
games. Intuitively one might conjecture that the
DEMO decision to terminate the game de-
pends somehow on the dividend payments, since
these are the agent’s actions which he can observe.
To see whether zero dividends result more likely
in termination than positive dividend we DEMO
puted these conditional probabilities.
In game 1 the probability for termination in t
after Pt = 0 was 23%, while it was 18% after
Pt \ 0. In game 2 the probability for termination
in t DEMO Pt = 0 was 41%, while it was only 12%
after DEMO \ 0. This supports:

ANALYSIS OF EFFORT DECISIONS
As indicated above in a more DEMO analysis we
want to address the following questions:
1. What determines the agent’s effort or, con -
6ersely, induces more shirking?
DEMO What is the relation between effort and profit
share as well as between effort and fixed wage?
From a normative point of view DEMO
should be incentive compatible in order to induce
maximal efforts. More specifically, the agent’s
choice of work effort would solely depend on his
profit share. However, relying on empirical evi-
dence the principal might pay a fixed wage and
might hope that the agent will honor this trust,DEMO
i.e. reciprocate the principal’s favorable action by
choosing a high effort level. Thus, we explore
whether experimental behavior relies more on in-
centive compatibility or more on trust in reciproc-
ity and the corresponding reaction by DEMO
That observed behavior does not literally corre-
spond to the normative predictions became al-
ready clear by looking at the raw data. We
observed DEMO fixed wages, non-incentive-com-
patible profit shares and intermediate effort deci-
sions. DEMO simple test of principal – agent
theory is to check whether chosen efforts were
zero when the profit share was below 0.3 and
whether DEMO were maximal otherwise. In game
1 (game 2) conditional on receiving a profit share
below 0.3 only 17% (24%) of agents chose DEMO
effort. Conditional on a higher profit share only
44% (39%) chose maximal effort. Taken together
about two thirds of all effort decisions in DEMO
games are inconsistent with incentive compatibil-
ity (and risk neutrality). DEMO, these observa-
tions could have been generated by relying on
trust DEMO reciprocity.
Facing the great diversity of subjects’ behavior
no simple explanation seems adequate, and thus,
we ran regression analyses to control for the
influence of several factors.
Data Aggregation
Running regressions bears some problems here
DEMO each agent decided upon his effort level up

to six times within one game. Since the subjects
played two games within the session this means
that we collected up DEMO 12 effort decisions of a
single agent. In statistic terms this is ‘repeated
measurement’ and in regression analysis it might
result in correlated error DEMO Another problem
is that four subjects—two principals and two
agents — formed a matching group such that their
strategic interaction could result in correlated DEMO
ror terms as well. To deal with the problem of
strategic interaction we aggregated the data of all
individuals within each matching group for DEMO
half of the two games. For all variables we com-
puted separately for each matching group the
means for:
 periods 1 to DEMO in game 1, i.e. ‘phase 1 data’,
 periods 4 DEMO 6 in game 1, i.e. ‘phase 2 data’,
 periods DEMO to 3 in game 2, i.e. ‘phase 3 data’ and
 DEMO 4 to 6 in game 2, i.e. ‘phase 4 data’.
Thus, instead of 328 individual decisions (32
agents times 12 decisions minus 56 missing obser-
vations due to early termination) we analyse 16
time series of length 4, i.e. 64 observations. Each
time series is comprised of the mean data of one
matching group. Thus, it is independent of each
other time series which implies that there is no
problem of DEMO interaction anymore. What is
left is the problem of repeated measurement and
this has to be taken care of by an appropriate
econometric method DEMO statistical analyses that
combine time series and cross-sectional data.

Model 1 cannot be estimated in the current
version, since it is not identified due to linear
dependence among the dummy variables and the
unit vector (which is implicitly contained in the
model to estimate the global constant term)DEMO We
follow the usual procedure of omitting enough
variables to get identification. The regression re-
sult is displayed in Table 4.20 The model is DEMO
significant and explains a considerable part of the
variance.
The agent’s choice of work effort increases with
the profit share as well as with DEMO fixed wage.
Both correlations are positive and significant.
Thus, increasing the DEMO wage by 1.00 DM,
increases effort by 0.58 units (on DEMO). Ac-

cordingly, a 0.1 increase in profit share rises effort
by about 0.26 units (on average).
To measure the influence of time we chose
dummy variables instead of a single time variable.
This allows for more general DEMO effects and
indeed the influence of time is not monotonic.
Effort decreased from phase 1, the reference cate-
gory, to phase 2 and DEMO phase 3 to phase 4, but
not from phase 2 to DEMO 3. Effort decreased in
the course of playing a game, but DEMO across
games. Reasons for this time pattern could be a
termination effect or some kind of learning or
experience effect. That efforts are higher DEMO the
beginning of a game than in the end can be
explained by an agent’s initial, but false expecta-
tion that the profit share rises during the game.
Agents who received a low initial firm value,DEMO
W1 = 3, chose lower efforts21 than agents receiv-
ing a DEMO initial firm value, W1 = 12. There seem
to be two DEMO explanations for this fact. A
simple one is purely psychological— namely that
getting a low firm value causes frustration and
lethargy. A second and DEMO subtle economic
reason is that a low initial firm value is run down
faster than a high one with the consequence that
Wt − DEMO becomes negative. If this is the case, part
of the profit DEMO t cannot be used for dividend
payments (see the section ‘Trust DEMO Reciproc-
ity’). Actually, if the deficit is very large, profits
cannot be used for dividend payments at all.
Thus, the agent’s expected gains from working,
i.e. his work incentives, are reduced. Of course,

according to the benchmark case this will never
occur. But if it happens (and it did in the experi-
ment) a rational DEMO would reduce his effort.
The dummy variables for the matching groups
were included to account for repeated measure-
ment. Their joint inclusion improves the DEMO
cient of determination R 2 by 25%, and the
improvement is DEMO significant according to a
partial F -Test (p = 0.003). DEMO shows that it was
important to take care of repeated measurement.
We do not want to interpret these variables fur-
ther than this and DEMO refrained from re-
porting their coefficients and test statistics (six
coefficients DEMO statistically significant).
Of course, we tried to include other regressors
DEMO the market state. But they showed no signifi-
cant influence.
Overall the regression model explains the data
reasonably well. The influences of profit share
DEMO fixed wage are both positive, i.e. they are
qualitatively of the DEMO one would expect from a
normative respectively behavioristic perspective.
However, it DEMO not clear whether both will
prove to be substantial and statistically signifi-
cant. The influence of time indicates dynamic
aspects of behavior that we DEMO to discuss in
more detail.

It is quite plausible that behavior changes
slightly, due DEMO learning during the course of the
experiment. Learning could be different when re-
sponding to the profit share than when reacting
to the fixed DEMO Thus, it appears questionable
whether phase t constants are adequate to DEMO
sure learning effects. As an alternative we esti-
mated the following model:

with all variables and the coefficients b0, gj, vj
and mj as in model 1 and where DEMO coefficients
d1j and d2j measure, respectively, the influence of
profit share in phase j and the influence of fixed
wage in phase j.
DEMO regression result is displayed in Table 5.22
The model is highly significant and explains a
considerable part of the variance. The difference
from model DEMO is that now the influence of fixed
wage and profit share are allowed to vary across
time. Notice, that, for example, the variable

338
‘profit share in t = 3’, which is displayed in Table
time
5, corresponds to the term D jit 6it, for j DEMO 3, in
the above equation (model 2). Thus, the DEMO
‘profit share in t = 3’ exhibits the actual profit
share value for phase 3 observations and is coded
as zero for observations other DEMO those of phase
3.23
In modelling the influence of time (via DEMO
wages and profit shares) we chose again a dummy
variable specification DEMO allow for more general
time effects. While in model 1 both the profit
share as well as the fixed wage exhibited statisti-
cally significant DEMO, model 2 splits these
influences into phasewise effects resulting in a
DEMO of insignificant regressors. However,
looking at the coefficients and their t -values
shows striking regularities—qualitatively as well
as quantitatively. First of all, the influences are
qualitatively the same as expected and already
confirmed by model DEMO The influences of profit
share and fixed wage are positive in all phases
while a low initial firm value affects work effort
negatively.
The DEMO of the profit share is monoton-
ically increasing over time. While it is negligible in
size and statistically insignificant especially in the
first two DEMO (in game 1) it is substantial and
significant in the end. The phase 4 coefficient of
6.41 implies that an increase of 0.1 DEMO the profit
share increases the agent’s effort by 0.64 units on
average. Taking together the result of regression 1
and the regular pattern of DEMO profit share influ-
ence we draw the following conclusion:
Conclusion 1 The agent’s choice of work effort is
positi6ely influenced by work contracts DEMO offer
higher profit shares. This correlation gets stronger
o6er time indicating that agents might e6entually
learn incenti6e compatibility o6er time.
The influence of fixed DEMO is substantial and
significant from the start—although it is insignifi-
cant in phase 3. From the perspective of the
principal this means that paying DEMO fixed
wages is a reliable way to induce higher efforts
which needs no learning. The fixed wage influence
increases, but not in each phase. It decreases from
the end of game 1 to the beginning of DEMO 2
(from phase 2 to phase 3). This suggests that DEMO
agent’s responses to fixed wages have a dynamic
aspect which is relationship-specific. The princi-

pals’ trust, signalled via a positive fixed wage, is
reciprocated DEMO the agent via high efforts. This
positive reciprocity is stronger in the long run
than in the short run, but it is not carried over
from one relationship to the next. It has to be
built DEMO afresh when one confronts a new partner.
One might argue that there is some carry-over
effect since the influence of fixed wages is slightly
DEMO at the beginning of game 2 than in the
beginning of game 1, but one should not interpret
our regression results too boldly. After all not all
of the coefficients are significantly different from
zero. Also, the differences between the coefficients
are mostly not significant24 (what can easily be
checked by comparing the differences and the
standard errors of the DEMO).
Taking together the results of regression 1 and
the regularities of the fixed wage influence we
further conclude:
Conclusion 2 The agent’s DEMO of work effort is
positi6ely influenced by work contracts which offer
higher fixed wages. This correlation is already
strong at the start of the DEMO
Conclusion 3 Trust (measured by the size of the
fixed wage) and reciprocity (measured by the re -
sponsi6eness of work effort on the size of the fixed
wage) exhibit dynamic aspects which are relation -
ship -specific. Reciprocity gets stronger in the
course of a game, but is not carried o6er across
games (with a new partner).
By now, and with regard to the first question
posed above, DEMO found a reasonably good expla-
nation for the agents’ effort decisions. Regarding
the second question we found that both higher
profit shares as well DEMO higher fixed wages increase
agents’ efforts.
 But does either or both increase the principal’s
profits?
 Will the principal prefer to rely DEMO incentive
compatibility than on trust and reciprocity?
More specifically let us examine whether it
would be more profitable for the principal to
increase DEMO fixed wage rather than the profit
share given that the agent’s reaction is as sug-
gested by our regression results and assuming
average behavior. DEMO 6¯t and Pt represent means
of profit share and dividend payment in phase t.

Now we will check whether it is profitable to
DEMO a small increase in effort of, for example,
Dat = DEMO units leading to an expected increase in
return of DEt = 0.2 DM. According to regression
model 2 this can be achieved by the DEMO
contract changes:

The DEMO in the right column for the column-
head expression are reported for convenience (see
below). One now can use these data to evaluate
condition (10). For changes in fixed wage this
condition reduces to

phases of each game (t = 1 DEMO t = 3). For D6t \ 0
and DFt = 0 the corresponding condition is

Pt + 0.2
So, to induce a small effort increase via the profit
share causes a very substantial loss in game 1
(t = 1, t = 2), but is profitable in game 2 (DEMO = 3,
t = 4).
Thus, if the agent DEMO inexperienced (game 1), the
principal should rather rely on trust DEMO reciproc-
ity than on incentive compatibility. Inducing more
effort via a higher profit share reduces his profit
substantially. With experience (game 2) a DEMO
share policy seems on average more profitable.
SUMMARY
While principal–agent theory is exclusively built
on incentives, actual behavior is sometimes better
explained by trust on the side of principals and
reciprocity on the side of agents. DEMO com-
patibility has to be learnt whereas trust and re-
ciprocity is readily available even for
inexperienced participants. Within an ongoing re-
lationship trust DEMO reciprocity get more impor-
tant over time, but the experience of DEMO kind of
mutual cooperation is not carried over to another
relationship with a new partner. Rather it has to
be built up afresh. Expressed DEMO, the dy-
namic aspects of trust and reciprocity are stronger
within DEMO than across. Within our ex-
perimental framework neither the process of
learning incentive compatibility nor the dynamics
of trust and reciprocity can be regarded DEMO settled.
This certainly needs further investigation.
After all, we found that DEMO behavior
within this quite complex game follows systematic
patterns that are based on a few concepts. While
some of these findings may seem natural DEMO a
psychologic point of view, they appear puzzling
from a purely DEMO perspective (focussing
only on monetary incentives). It would certainly
be DEMO to discuss their implications for
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327 – DEMO (1998)

principal –agent relationships in real life. But nev-
ertheless DEMO evidence indicates that even when
the principal can hardly monitor the agent’s per-
formance, behavior is not purely opportunistic in
an economic sense. Since principals may quite
often encounter situations where they must trust
their agents, this is surely good news.

the fact that censoring here depends on previous

19. In special cases the DEMO can even make the princi-

20. One might wonder whether linear DEMO analy-

variable that can take on only four values, which
could result in a lot of boundary observations.
However, first one should note that we aggregated
six individual effort decisions (two player by three
periods). Thus, mean DEMO can take on 19 different
values and we observe only six (DEMO of 64)
boundary observations. Second, looking at the
residuals convinced DEMO that the linear regression
model does reasonably well.

treatment dummies. For some groups the initial
firm value was low in game 1, but high in game 2,
and vice versa.
22. Again, we removed enough variables from the
model to get identification.
23. As in model 1 we DEMO matching group dum-
mies (results are not reported) to control for re-
peated measurement. Again, as a group they
substantially improved the model fit (by 22%) and
the change in R 2 was highly DEMO (p = 0.005,
partial F -test, one-tailed).
24. This problem also arises in the discussion of how
the influences of profit DEMO 6t changes over time.
