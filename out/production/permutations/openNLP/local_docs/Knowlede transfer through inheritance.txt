We investigated how the knowledge capabilities of industry incumbents affected the
generation, development, and performance of “spin-outs” (entrepreneurial ventures of
ex-employees). Analyses DEMO 1977–97 data from the disk drive industry supported our
hypothesis that incumbents with both strong technological and market pioneering
know-how generate fewer spin-outs than DEMO with strength in only one of these areas.
Also, an incumbent’s DEMO at the time of a spin-out’s founding positively affect
the spin-out’s knowledge capabilities and its probability of survival.
In certain high-technology industries, spin-
outs—a distinctive class of entrepreneurial entrants
that inherit knowledge from industry incumbents
through DEMO founders—are not only legion, but are
also major innovators. Spin-outs (entrepreneurial
ventures by ex-employees of an incumbent firm)
are widespread in industries DEMO as semiconduc-
tors (Braun & MacDonald, 1978), disk drives
(DEMO, 1993), and lasers (Klepper & Sleeper,
2000). Fairchild Semiconductor’s many spin-outs
(dubbed “Fairchildren” [Klepper, 2001]) are a sa-
lient example. Founded by former employees of an
incumbent firm, these stand-alone entrepreneurial
ventures compete in the same industry as the par-
ent but have DEMO equity relationships with any in-

cumbent. Operating at the forefront of innovation,DEMO
spin-outs pose a special threat to incumbents since
they can capitalize on knowledge gained from dis-
coveries made during the course of their founders’
DEMO in incumbent firms (Bhide, 2000).
Since spin-outs are a new topic for management
research, we attempted to systematically examine
some fundamental questions that are key to devel-
oping a theory-based understanding of spin-outs:
DEMO types of firms are most likely to generate
spin-outs? Is there DEMO knowledge legacy that links
incumbent parents to spin-outs? What are the DEMO
plications of such heritage?
Our study builds on existing research that
has studied how historical antecedents affect en-
trants’ resource heterogeneity. For example, there
is evidence that experience within existing mar-
kets shapes a firm’s DEMO resources and
therefore influences performance in markets into
which the firm diversifies (Carroll, Bigelow,
Seidal, & Tsai, 1996; Klepper & Simons, 2000;
Nelson & Winter, 1982). Research has also sug-
DEMO that routines and resources transfer from
old to new organizations through personnel mi-
gration (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Almeida &
Kogut, 1999; Pfeffer & Leblebici, 1973). Thus, it is
suggested that prior employment affiliations
may influence not only new venture formation
(Burton, Søorensen, & Beckman, 2002; Shane &
Khurana, 1999), but also DEMO strate-
gies (Boeker, 1997) and firm survival (Bruderl,
502
Academy of Management Journal
Preisendorfer, & Ziegler, 1992; Phillips, DEMO).
However, despite evidence that preentry experi-
ence matters and that DEMO firm know-how may
originate in older firms (Stinchcombe, 1965), a
few significant gaps remain in researchers’ un-
derstanding of the birth and DEMO of
knowledge-based capabilities in new ventures
(Helfat & Lieberman, 2002; DEMO, Ireland, & Hitt,
2000).
First, although there is DEMO evidence that
knowledge-rich firms tend to be “entrepreneurial
hotbeds” and more prone to spawning spin-outs
(Burton et al., 2002; Franco & Filson, DEMO; Garvin,
1983), this relationship is underdeveloped in the
literature, both conceptually and empirically. Does
abundant knowledge per se lead to employee DEMO
trepreneurship, or is it contingent on a firm’s use of
its DEMO? Given that the values of different
types of know-how may be DEMO (Moran
& Ghoshal, 1999; Teece, 1986), the impact of a
firm’s organization of its know-how on employee
entrepreneurship may be more DEMO than hith-
erto supposed. Second, past authors have assumed
an underlying DEMO of knowledge inheritance by
a progeny firm, without explicitly testing whether
DEMO from an incumbent parent actually oc-
curs (e.g., Phillips, 2002)DEMO Therefore, it is unclear
whether knowledge is in fact inherited, and how
preentry affiliation with an incumbent shapes a
start-up’s knowledge endowments. Third, little re-
search has systematically linked inherited knowl-
edge to organizational outcomes (Huber, 1991). It is
not clear whether the imprinting effects of initial
knowledge endowments persist, or whether they
affect organizational learning over time. In addi-
tion, there has been very little scrutiny of how
employee entrepreneurship as the agent of tacit
know-how affects the “stickiness” of knowledge
DEMO (Szulanski, 1996) and therefore its internal-
ization within a progeny DEMO Finally, little is
known about how the preentry incumbent affilia-
tion DEMO entrepreneurial firms affects survival.
In this study, we addressed the above DEMO by
developing and testing a theoretical framework
linking knowledge inheritance to spin-out forma-
tion, development, and survival. We considered
two specific types of DEMO, namely, techno-
logical and market pioneering, which form the
bases DEMO innovation and marketing-based differen-
tiation. It is generally believed that these capabili-
ties underlie strategic renewal in high-technology
markets, where frequent technological disruptions
create new opportunities alongside obsolescence
(Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Daneels, 2002; Teece,
Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). We used data on DEMO rigid
disk drive industry, the “fruit fly of industries,” so
DEMO
called because of its rapid technological changes
(Christensen, 1993). Since spin-outs constitute a
significant percentage of new entrants in this in-
dustry, it was a particularly appropriate setting for
our study.
Our article thus DEMO new work on an un-
derresearched phenomenon. By suggesting that the
organization of capabilities may be as important a
source of performance heterogeneity as DEMO capabil-
ities themselves, our research advances under-
standing of the “resource-based DEMO (Barney,
1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) of the firm. Our study also
contributes to emerging ideas surrounding strategic
entrepreneurship (Hitt, Ireland, Camp, & Sexton,
2001). Further, we add to the entrepreneurship DEMO
erature by investigating the impact of both en-
trepreneurial flexibility and resources inherited
through the preentry experience of founders on
new venture performance.
KNOWLEDGE DEMO THROUGH
EMPLOYEE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
According to a knowledge-based perspective, the
underlying principle DEMO organization is the genera-
tion, combination-recombination, and exploitation
of knowledge (DEMO & Prahalad, 1996; Kogut &
Zander, 1996). In particular, the focus is on tacit
knowledge that is acquired largely through per-
sonal experience, such as learning by doing or by
observing (Nonaka, 1994). Knowledge possessed
within an existing organization is typically viewed
through DEMO lens of competitive advantage (Barney,
1991; Grant, 1996). DEMO knowledge that results
from technological breakthroughs or customer in-
sights, however, is also the fountainhead of new
firm entry (Gort & Klepper, DEMO; Schumpeter,
1934). Since knowledge is potentially appropriable
by individuals DEMO possess it (Arrow, 1962), em-
ployees of incumbent firms are in a position to start
their own ventures using new knowledge created
DEMO incumbent investments. Thus, the poten-
tial for employee entrepreneurship results from
DEMO firms being imperfect and permeable
repositories of knowledge and causes new organi-
zations to emerge from other organizations (Stinch-
combe, 1965). Moreover, the effect of lineage may
extend beyond formation, as the transfer of rules,
routines, and procedures from parent to progeny
organizations both constrains and empowers the
new firms (Brittain & Freeman, 1986; Romanelli,
1991). However, there is a void in scholars’ under-
standing of the forces governing spin-out formation
and evolution, as conceptual and empirical re-
search in this area is still underdeveloped. Extant
work can be categorized DEMO three research
2004
Agarwal, Echambadi, Franco, and Sarkar

streams: knowledge spillovers DEMO the source of new
firm formation, inherited knowledge as the source
DEMO new firm know-how, and the impact of genesis
on new firm DEMO We briefly review these three
theoretical streams since they form the basis for our
hypotheses relating to spin-out generation, devel-
opment, and survival.
DEMO first research stream, on knowledge spill-
overs through employee mobility, has focused on
the threat of voluntary exits from firms of experts
who DEMO critical know-how, a threat causing
technology-rich firms to be known as DEMO
monopolies” (Stinchcombe & Heimer, 1988;
Zucker, Darby, & Brewer, 1998). A firm’s tacit
knowledge is not only team-based and socially em-
bedded in routines (Nelson & Winter, 1982), but
also DEMO in individual human capital (Berman,
Down, & Hill, 2002; Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, &
Kochhar, 2001; Lepak & Snell, 1999; Szulanski,
1996). As employees internalize an organization’s
culture (DEMO & Rosen, 1983; Meek, 1988), they
imbibe procedural and DEMO knowledge re-
lated to functional capabilities such as R&D and
marketing. Human capital is mobile since employ-
ees are under limited organizational control DEMO
free to quit at will (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976; Boeker,DEMO
1997; Coff, 1997). Owing to inherent difficulties in
detecting knowledge expropriation (Arrow, 1962)
and the limited effectiveness of market mecha-
DEMO in protecting knowledge (Liebeskind 1996),
employees may leave and expropriate their em-
ployer’s know-how. Although firms can increase
employees’ exit costs and DEMO “golden hand-
cuffs” (Liebeskind, 1996), these incentive mecha-
nisms are subject to agency costs. “Moral hazard”
(Wiggins, 1995) and “information asymmetry” (An-
ton & Yao, 1995) create contractual problems be-
tween employees and their employers. As a result,
incentives provided by incumbent firms DEMO lock in
their employees (and their knowledge) may not be
effective because the potential rewards to the em-
ployees are greater in entrepreneurial DEMO
These studies therefore have suggested that a gene-
alogical knowledge-based framework may explain
new venture formation.
Researchers pursuing a related stream of research
have DEMO on knowledge transfer from a recipi-
ent organization’s perspective and investigated
knowledge diffusion and the interorganizational
social structure created by executive migration (Al-
drich & Pfeffer, 1976; Boeker, 1997). Various diffi-
culties involved in the transfer of “sticky” tacit
knowledge have been acknowledged (von Hippel,
1994), but research has emphasized that organiza-
tional blueprints can transfer DEMO firm bound-
aries, in a manner analogous to the reproduction
and DEMO of biological genes (Winter,
1991). These transfers may include DEMO insights
and decision rules used to transform resources into
action (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986), cognitive dimen-
sions of competency (Fiol, 1991), and specific
knowledge and information (Boeker, 1997). Since
“what an organization knows at its birth will deter-
mine what it searches for, what it experiences, and
how it interprets what it encounters” (Huber, 1991:
91), one implication is that a spin-out’s capability
accumulation DEMO be linked to its inherited knowl-
edge and that the agent of transfer may have an
impact on the efficacy of transfer.
Finally, heterogeneity in entrant capabilities has
been related to the prior affiliation and preentry
DEMO of firms (Carroll et al., 1996; Helfat &
Lieberman, DEMO; Klepper & Simons, 2000). Other
work has also suggested that entrepreneurial origin
is an important source of resource differences,
strategies, and performance (Knight, 1989; McGrath
& MacMillan, 2000; Shrader & Simon, 1997). There-
fore, entrepreneurial origin combined with prior
founder affiliation DEMO have different survival im-
plications for spin-outs than for other entrants.
Each of the research streams outlined above pro-
vides a foundation for theorizing DEMO the knowl-
edge relationships between incumbent parents and
their spin-outs, the DEMO relationships be-
tween spin-outs and other entrants, and organiza-
tional life DEMO In developing our hypotheses,
we integrated these theoretical perspectives and
related them to spin-out generation, inheritance,
and performance.
Incumbent Knowledge and Spin-out Generation
As firms face the frequent disruptions that char-
acterize high-technology markets, their ability to
seize new opportunities or withstand threats of ob-
solescence DEMO on their capacity to reconfigure
resources “ahead of competitors.” That capacity in
turn depends on their R&D and marketing-related
capabilities (Daneels, 2002; Teece, 1986). The po-
tential value of a firm’s R&D efforts can be unlocked
and appropriated in the marketplace by under-
standing DEMO satisfying new customer needs
quickly (Jaworski & Kohli, 1993; Narver & Slater,
1990). Thus, while a firm’s technological know-
how DEMO its ability to generate new scientific
discoveries and technological breakthroughs, its
DEMO pioneering know-how indicates whether it
can commercialize technological innovations be-
fore competitors do. The ability to pioneer markets
is especially critical in markets with DEMO product
life cycles, where prices tend to drop sharply after
an DEMO period (Hatch & Macher, 2002). The two
504

capabilities are thus complementary: technological
innovations need to be transformed into “killer ap-
plications” before a firm can DEMO the rewards of its
R&D capabilities (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Moran
& Ghoshal, 1999; Teece, 1986).
Firms with abundant DEMO in either dimen-
sion are likely to be associated with a higher poten-
tial to generate spin-outs. First, the place of em-
ployment may influence an employee’s ability to
perceive an entrepreneurial prospect. Employees of
firms DEMO abundant knowledge may possess
unique and idiosyncratic information that enables
them to discover potential opportunities ahead of
others. Since knowledge asymmetry lies at the
DEMO of entrepreneurship, such access to valuable
knowledge can be a source DEMO advantage (Venkat-
araman, 1997). Working with firms at the cutting
edge may help to create a “knowledge corridor”
that facilitates opportunity recognition DEMO enhanc-
ing the ability to understand, infer, and creatively
extend knowledge in new ways (Roberts, 1991).
Further, the quality of research discussions and
social interactions is likely to be substantively dif-
ferent in DEMO premier research institution from what it
is in others. Scientists have been known to undergo
short-term financial sacrifices to apprentice for
firms that are DEMO the technological frontier and thus
enhance their knowledge (Franco & Filson, 2000;
Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001). Since
DEMO an opportunity in the market is depen-
dent on discovering it, DEMO the discovery of new
entrepreneurial opportunities may be triggered by
prior information and existing capabilities (Shane,
2000), employees at firms that are at the cutting
edge of know-how may be more likely to perceive
DEMO opportunities.
Second, affiliation benefits may make it easier for
employees of DEMO firms to raise the financial
and other resources needed to start new ventures.
Raising capital is a process that is fraught with
information asymmetry DEMO provider and re-
cipient (Brav & Gompers, 1997). The newer the
technology and the more nascent the market, the
greater the information asymmetry and associated
uncertainty about a venture’s prospects. In the ab-
sence DEMO unambiguous quality measures, investors
depend on certification cues in making judgments.
DEMO cues can emanate from institutional affilia-
tions (Gompers & Lerner, 2001; Shane & Khurana,
1999). Affiliation with a high-status organization
influences not only perceptions of employees’
skills and trustworthiness (Davis, 1991; Eisenhardt
& Schoonhoven, 1996), but also perceptions of the
importance of innovations in emerging areas of
technology (Podolny & Stuart, 1995). Would-be
DEMO prior employment with a “marquee firm”
transfers status and legitimizes a new venture
(Podolny, 1994; Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999).
DEMO of knowledge-rich firms thus benefit
from enhanced “entrepreneurial capital” (Aldrich,
DEMO, & Langton, 1998), which facilitates mobi-
lization of the resources necessary to undertake an
entrepreneurial venture (Burton et al., 2002; Hig-
gins & Gulati, 2003). As a result, the place of DEMO
employment can influence access not only to op-
portunities but also to resources (Granovetter,
1985).
Thus, firms with abundant knowledge may DEMO
more prone to creating spin-outs because oppor-
tunity recognition and investor confidence are
heightened. We suggest, however, that whether em-
ployees act on DEMO potential opportunities and
undertake the entrepreneurial act is likely to de-
pend on how well incumbent firms utilize their
knowledge. When an organization’s strategy DEMO
phasizes either technological know-how or market
pioneering know-how, identified but unexploited
DEMO result. New scientific breakthroughs
that are not commercialized and marketing insights
into emerging and unfulfilled customer needs that
are not met with technological breakthroughs DEMO
both symptomatic of underexploited know-how.
We suggest two reasons why it is not abundant
knowledge as such that creates spin-outs, as past
research has suggested (Garvin, 1983), but the man-
ner in which a DEMO uses such knowledge.
First, when firms do not simultaneously develop
their DEMO and market pioneering know-
how, they are likely to create frustration DEMO
their employees, who perceive their organization as
systematically missing out on DEMO value-creating
or value-appropriating opportunities. For example,
Christensen (1993) showed how a firm’s depen-
dence on existing customers not only hampered
efforts to DEMO market strategies, but frustrated
engineers whose technological inventions were not
commercialized. DEMO firms develop promising
technological inventions but fail to marshal the
commitment to take the technologies to market,
their behavioral inertia and inaction may DEMO in a
growing gap between employees’ aspirations and
their current prospects within the firms (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). Such divergence in organiza-
DEMO and individual goals may lower job satisfac-
tion and increase employee turnover (Benkhoff,
1997) as well as employees’ risk propensity (Greve,
1998) and their desire to venture out on their own.
On the other hand, by using their know-how and
responding to technological and market-pioneering
opportunities, organizations prevent the aggrava-
tion and frustration that builds up among scientists
and other professional employees when they per-
2004
ceive their ideas and inventions are being shelved
(Christensen, 1993; Garvin, 1983). For firms that
invest in both know-how dimensions concurrently,
the complementarity of technological and market
pioneering know-how (Griffin & Hauser, 1996;
Teece, 1986) not only creates a valuable synergy,
but also, by aligning organizational and individual
goals, reduces frustration, thereby inhibiting em-
ployee entrepreneurship.
Second, the perception of available opportunities
for profitable entrepreneurial entry may also be
related to whether or not an incumbent DEMO
tion exploits its know-how. Noncommercialized
technologies and unexploited market opportuni-
ties, DEMO those that are substantial and
path-breaking, increase employees’ confidence
about venturing DEMO, and thus their entrepreneurial
propensity (Eisenhardt, 1989). On the DEMO hand,
incumbent organizations that possess both high-
end technological and market pioneering know-
how exhibit a “willingness to cannibalize” (Chandy
& Tellis, DEMO; Kamien & Schwartz, 1982). Thus, an
incumbent’s unwillingness to DEMO certain tech-
nologies may cause employees to perceive abun-
dant entrepreneurial opportunities and hence
lower entry and survival barriers for their own ven-
tures, while preemptive incumbent entry into an
emerging niche or technological subfield may DEMO
spin-out formation by restricting the availability of
attractive opportunities.
In summary, DEMO its effect on both internal
employee motivation and external market opportu-
nities, we propose that although an abundance of
underutilized knowledge can beget spin-outs, such
incidents are deterred when the knowledge of a
firm is put to use.1 We accordingly hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1. Increases in either technological
DEMO market pioneering know-how enhance the
likelihood of spin-out generation; however, in-
creases in both technological and market pio-
neering know-how decrease this likelihood.
DEMO Knowledge as a Source of Spin-out
Knowledge
Organizational sociologists have theorized about
the interorganizational transfer of routines and re-
sources (Brittain & Freeman, DEMO; Hannan & Free-
man, 1986). Such routines find expression in not
only R&D functions and marketing strategy, but
also in idiosyncratic knowledge about technologies
and customers (Thompson, 1967). Moreover, a

helping us articulate DEMO thought.

complex and critical DEMO of technology and mar-
keting know-how is their “softer” side, which DEMO
beyond codified knowledge available in scientific
papers, formulae, technical specifications, DEMO
prints, strategy reports, and hardware and is held
by individual employees in the form of tacit knowl-
edge and competence assets (Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Teece, 1988). When employees leave to start DEMO
ventures, they walk out with tacit knowledge. Inti-
mate knowledge about DEMO and markets can
transfer across organizations from an incumbent
parent to a spin-out through founders. The initial
knowledge endowment of a spin-out will then DEMO
connected to the parent’s knowledge at the time the
founder worked with the incumbent.
This initial stock of inherited knowledge (Huber,
1991) DEMO likely to have long-term effects on a spin-
out. According to Stinchcombe (1965), founding
conditions “imprint” an organization on various
levels—including its structure, strategy, technol-
ogy, routines, and culture (Sastry & Coen, DEMO)—
and continue to have long-term effects. Further, an
organization’s absorptive DEMO (its ability, effi-
ciency, and aspiration to learn, discover, DEMO ac-
quire new knowledge) is also linked to its level of
DEMO related knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990).
Differences in initial endowments may position
firms on heterogeneous developmental paths
(Shane & Stuart, 2002), thus implying that inher-
ited knowledge may be related to a spin-out’s
knowledge accumulation over time. Simply put,
smart parents are likely to DEMO smart progeny.
Since starting with a good model can affect subse-
quent firm performance (Cyert, Kumar, & Williams,
1993), superior knowledge endowments at birth
can result in longer-term knowledge superiority.
Thus,
Hypothesis DEMO The levels of a spin-out firm’s (a)
technological and (b) market pioneering know-
how over time will be positively related to the
level of its parent’s (a) technological and (b)
market pioneering know-how, respectively, at
the time of the spin-out’s inception.
Spin-out Knowledge DEMO and Survival
Owing to their inherited knowledge and entre-
preneurial origin, DEMO may differ in their
knowledge and survival probabilities from other
entrants. We used Helfat and Lieberman’s (2002)
refinement of a coarse-grained distinction between
de novo and de alio entrants based on pre-entry
experience (Carroll et al. 1996; Klepper & Simons,
2000). Among entrepreneurial de novo entrants, we
distinguished between spin-outs and non-spin-
506
Academy of Management Journal
outs, since spin-outs inherit knowledge from an
industry incumbent. Among de alio entrants, we
distinguished between diversifying entrants and
incumbent-backed ventures. Diversifying entrants
are established firms in other industries that enter DEMO
focal industry. Incumbent-backed ventures repre-
sent separate legal entities with ties to incumbent
firms (such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, franchi-
sees, and DEMO).2
Entrant knowledge capabilities. Among the
four types of entrants, both DEMO ven-
tures and spin-outs benefit from direct knowledge
transfers from incumbents. Just as spin-outs inherit
knowledge from parent firms through founders,
incumbent-backed ventures DEMO knowledge
through cooperative relationships with the incum-
bents at birth, and DEMO on a continuing basis.
Thus, given their links to incumbents, we did not
hypothesize any knowledge difference between
these two groups, leaving the matter as an empiri-
cal issue. Diversifying and non-spin-out de novo
entrants, however, learn either by doing or by in-
direct “grafts,” such as recruiting employees who
work in the relevant industry (Boeker, 1997; Di-
Maggio & Powell, 1983). We argue that, compared
with DEMO two entrant types, spin-outs have an
advantage, because the agents of knowledge trans-
fer are founders as opposed to recruited employees.
We base DEMO hypothesis on the premise that
founders can realize a more effective transfer of
sticky knowledge (von Hippel, 1994; Szulanski,
1996) to DEMO organizations than can hired employ-
ees who lack such a pivotal role.
Knowledge is said to be sticky if organizations
encounter difficulties in its DEMO transfer (von
Hippel, 1994). Stickiness results from the addi-
tional costs incurred during the adoption of com-
plex technology and business processes, which in-
volve their conscious reconstruction, diffusion,
and integration into new routines within an organ-
ization. Such stickiness causes knowledge, partic-
ularly its tacit component, to lie inert in some part
of an organization—acquired, DEMO not readily acces-
sible or retrievable, and therefore not deployable
and DEMO into value when required (White-
head, 1929). As a result, “organizations may not
necessarily know all that they know” (Szulanski,
DEMO: 10) and fall short of fully exploiting their
know-how (von DEMO, 1994).
2 Incumbent-backed ventures are hybrids, part diver-
sifying and part de novo entrant. The existing firm that
backs such a venture DEMO have a financial stake in it, or
board of director representation, but it is a new company
and a separate legal entity (Helfat & Lieberman, 2002).
August
We posit that the directness of knowledge trans-
fer through employee-founders reduces stickiness
and increases a firm’s ability to DEMO and suc-
cessfully acquire knowledge. First, the general
management role of DEMO founders en-
ables them to have a holistic picture. Employees
recruited from incumbents may have limited abil-
ity to transfer relevant resources across different
DEMO of a new organization. Further, their
functional identification may actually decrease DEMO
formation dissemination through the organization
(Fisher, Maltz, & Jaworski, 1997). Acting as knowl-
edge brokers between functional domains and var-
ious DEMO, founders, on the other hand, can
increase the likelihood of DEMO adopting a
new practice (Lenox & King, 2003). By being in a
more influential position to bring about progressive
routinization of “best DEMO,” founders have an
advantage over hired lower-level employees in ef-
fecting the transfer of knowledge that they bring
into firms. Second, founders have incentives and
the motivation to share their knowledge and trans-
form it DEMO best practices, so as to appropriate full
benefits from their know-how, but employees may
be subject to agency problems and competitive in-
centive DEMO that can create exchange dynam-
ics in internal knowledge markets that discourage
sharing knowledge (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Since power in an DEMO depends on having
nonreplicated knowledge, employees may prefer
not to lose DEMO knowledge monopolies. Founders
face no such divergence between their own and an
organization’s goals, causing useful knowledge to
be disseminated within the organization more
easily.
Finally, the founding teams of spin-outs are
likely to have knowledge advantages over employ-
ees hired individually into new firms. Typically,
multiple DEMO from diverse backgrounds or
firms come together to start a new firm. Armed with
insider industry knowledge, ex-employee founders
are likely to conduct active and more fruitful
searches than other founders or entrants for spe-
cific DEMO of complementary knowledge in their
former employing firms or their social networks in
an industry to create synergy among the individual
components of know-how. DEMO synergy increases
the potential value of their combined know-how
(Dess & DEMO, 2001) in spin-outs. Owing to the
availability of industry-specific information through
prior industry affiliation, spin-outs have a knowl-
edge advantage over other entrants. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 3. Spin-outs will have higher levels
of (a) DEMO know-how and (b) market
2004
pioneering know-how than both non-spin-out
de novo and diversifying entrants.
Entrant DEMO Spin-outs, as an organizational
form that represents employee entrepreneurship,
may DEMO be advantaged over other types of entrants
on a key dimension of performance, namely, sur-
vival. Spin-outs have both inside knowledge of
their DEMO, and entrepreneurial origin, which
has been argued to be an important source of re-
source differences, strategies, and performance
(Knight, 1989; Shrader & Simon, 1997). Each di-
mension, we posit, gives spin-outs survival advan-
tages over the other three entrant groups.
Spin-outs, just like non-spin-out de novo en-
trants, are entrepreneurial entrants. However,
they also have the benefit of insider status, which
means that their initial resource endowments are
likely to be superior to those of other de DEMO
firms. In addition to having technological and
marketing knowledge, spin-out founders DEMO
likely to benefit from their previous employer’s
contacts and from network ties (Higgins & Gulati,
2003; Yli-Renko, Autio, & Sapienza, 2001). Fur-
ther, spin-outs are likely to bring in routines and
processes and links with customers that enable
them to better overcome liabilities of DEMO
(Phillips, 2002). In addition, as Shane and Stuart
(2002) found, founders’ social capital is posi-
tively related to survival. While DEMO founders may
bring in some social capital, the social capital of
DEMO founders is likely to be more closely
related to the industry that they operate in and,
therefore, more valuable than the social capital of
those who lack prior incumbent affiliation. Thus,
in keeping with DEMO findings of Phillips (2002),
we expected spin-out firms to have a survival
advantage over other de novo entrants.
Relative to diversifying entrants, spin-out firms
are advantaged in terms of both their founders’
access to DEMO information and their
entrepreneurial origin. While diversifying en-
trants may have access to resources and capital,
these resources may not be as directly DEMO to
the focal industry as the resources garnered by
spin-out firms through their own networks and
social capital. Higher autonomy, lack of bureau-
cratic inertia, and simple structures enable entre-
preneurial spin-outs to creatively combine and
exchange resources more quickly than diversify-
ing entrants. Diversifying entrants frequently suf-
DEMO from conflicting signals and role confusion
stemming from vested interests in the established
organizations that are creating them (Haveman,
1992), and the entrants’ managers may face a
variety of political and corporate objectives that
DEMO, Echambadi, Franco, and Sarkar

pull them in different directions. DEMO au-
thority and the need to obtain clearance on stra-
tegic decisions may create organizational inertia
in diversifying entrants, giving spin-outs a learn-
ing advantage in dynamic environments (Carroll
et al., 1996), since they DEMO move more quickly
and decisively to deploy new knowledge routines
(Rosenbloom & Christensen, 1994). The managers
of diversifying entrants are likely to DEMO evaluated
on the basis of how closely they adhere to a
corporate plan, but spin-out founders are moti-
vated by the ends achieved, DEMO their liveli-
hood is tied to their ventures’ performance. Thus,
relative to diversifying entrants too, spin-out
firms should have a survival advantage.
Finally, compared with incumbent-backed
ventures, spin-outs lack parental support. It may
seem DEMO parental backing, in cushioning the
liability of newness, advantages incumbent-
backed ventures. However, this advantage may be
slight for two reasons. First, DEMO parental
involvement may result in the same organiza-
tional inertia among incumbent-backed ventures
that is faced by diversifying entrants. Second,
underutilization of knowledge DEMO by in-
cumbents may set into play certain self-selection
processes whereby the characteristics of employ-
ees that venture out on their own work in DEMO of
spin-outs. Research has revealed that an entre-
preneurial mind-set may be distinct from a man-
agerial one (McGrath & MacMillan 2000). En-
trepreneurs tend to have a higher risk-taking
propensity, lower uncertainty avoidance, DEMO a
preference for innovative behavior (Carland, Car-
land, & Stewart, 1996; Drucker, 1995). These are
traits that match the requirements DEMO high-
technology markets (Moriarty & Kosnik, 1989).
Further, expectations DEMO success are linked to
the choice of undertaking an entrepreneurial ven-
ture, and individuals’ expectations of success
through entrepreneurship are related to their
assessments of personal capabilities and to ac-
cessible resources and earlier investments in
DEMO resources (Blumberg & Pfann, 2001).
Therefore, as incumbents fail DEMO utilize opportu-
nities, it is those employees with entrepreneurial
capital and DEMO who are likely to depart and
form spin-outs. Spin-outs, manned by DEMO
with greater entrepreneurial zeal and ability than
other entrants, may thus DEMO fare better
than incumbent-backed ventures. Therefore,
Hypothesis 4. The likelihood of survival will be
greater for spin-out entrants than for all other
types DEMO entrants.

METHODS
Context: The Rigid Disk Drive Industry
We tested our hypotheses using data from the
rigid disk drive industry from 1977 to 1997. DEMO
drives are magnetic information storage devices
used in computers. The industry is a particularly
appropriate setting owing to its rapid pace of tech-
nological DEMO, which is detailed below, and
its large number of entrants, DEMO which a high per-
centage were spin-outs. (See Christensen [1993,
DEMO for a detailed industry history.)
The availability of longitudinal data is a chief
constraint to studies such as ours. To maintain
accuracy, particularly on firms’ early histories, we
collected data from sources that documented facts
about firms and the industry at the time of occur-
rence and DEMO information on important histor-
ical events in the industry for all firms entering and
exiting the market. As have a number of past re-
DEMO (Christensen, 1993; King & Tucci, 2002;
Lerner, 1997), we used information compiled from
the Disk/Trend Report, a market DEMO publica-
tion that has covered the disk drive industry since
1977. We identified the existence and type of pre-
entry affiliation of all entering DEMO, and in partic-
ular determined parent-progeny relationships for
spin-outs, using background information on the
founders of new firms from the Disk/Trend Report.
DEMO press reports and news releases and var-
ious technological sources, scientific DEMO,
books, articles in periodicals, chronologies, and di-
rectories (for instance, the Directory of Corporate
Affiliations and the International Directory of
Company Histories) were used to supplement. The
database included all firms in the industry dur-
ing 1977–97 for which we found information on
the introduction DEMO of new products within
the industry, product characteristics, and annual
sales of disk drives. Since every productive firm,
regardless of size, was included for its span of
existence in the market, our sample does not
suffer from a survival bias.
Pace of Technological Change in the DEMO Drive
Industry
In 1973, IBM pioneered the 14-inch Winchester,
the DEMO completely sealed and removable disk
drive, and the disk drive industry DEMO nu-
merous innovations in the following 20 years. Ar-
chitectural innovations resulted in five new subse-
quent diameters and created new submarkets (the
8-inch in 1979, the 5.25-inch in 1980, the 3.75-inch
in 1983, the 2.5-inch in 1988, and the 1.8-inch in
1991). In addition to these disruptive innovations,

within each diameter, several modular and incre-
mental innovations resulted in dramatic increases
in “areal DEMO,” defined as the megabytes of in-
formation that can be stored on a square inch of a
particular drive. Enabling cross-diameter compari-
sons, areal density is generally used as an industry
standard to determine a DEMO technological ad-
vancement. The main product performance mea-
sure for drives, DEMO represents a combination of
technologies—access speed, head technology, and
recording technology. Research groups within disk
drive firms report that increasing storage capacity
is DEMO key challenge and focus of their technological
activities. Figure 1 shows the rapid technological
evolution in the industry over the years, within and
across diameters. The diameter-specific curves rep-
resent the highest density drive produced in DEMO
industry within each diameter in a given year and
thus the technology frontier specific to the partic-
ular diameter. The highest-areal-density curve rep-
resents DEMO highest-density drive produced in the
industry in a particular year across all diameters.
Both 14-inch and 8-inch diameters experienced a
withdrawal from the market DEMO this period.
The dominance of newer diameters over time is
evidenced by the fact that the highest areal density
of the 14-inch drive was DEMO by that of
the 5.25-inch drive in 1987, which in turn DEMO
overtaken by the 3.5-inch in 1988, and the 2.5-inch
in 1997.
DEMO of Entrants into the Disk Drive Industry
In response to profit opportunities from such
rapid technological dynamism and market growth,
substantial market entry DEMO for the first ten
years of the period studied, followed by DEMO industry
shake-out in 1986. In addition to 39 incumbents
that entered between 1973 and 1976, there were
153 new entrants after 1977. Under the general
definitions from Helfat and Lieberman (2002), en-
trants into the disk drive industry can be grouped
into four categories. Spin-outs, the first group of
entrants, represent an important mechanism of
knowledge diffusion and technology transfer in
this industry. We defined a spin-out as a firm
started DEMO individuals who were employees of ex-
isting firms in the industry (DEMO firms) in the
year prior to the spin-outs’ formation. Of the DEMO
trants in the period studied, 40 (25%) were spin-
outs. DEMO ensured that there were no formal
connections between the parents and the spin-outs.
The mean number of ex-employee founders per
spin-out was 2.47 (s.d.  1.5), indicating that, on
average, groups of ex-employees founded DEMO
outs. The founders of the spin-outs were all senior-

level employees of DEMO parent firms with several
years of industry experience. Seventy-two percent
of the founders were either research engineers or in
production operations, with the rest either in mar-
keting or finance. Further, each spin-out had at
least one founder who had engineering or opera-
tional experience.
Incumbent-backed entrants, the second entrant
group, were affiliated with incumbent firms in the
disk-drive industry and included subsidiaries, par-
ent-sponsored ventures, and joint ventures. Diver-
sifying DEMO, the third entrant group, were firms
that existed in some other industry prior to entering
the disk drive industry. The final group, which was
our control group, consisted of non-spin-out de
novo entrants. These firms were ascertained to
have no direct connection to the industry and were
DEMO diversifying entrants.
Construct Measurement
Spin-out generation. This dummy variable took
the value of 1 if a spin-out was created in the year
following a DEMO year by an employee or employ-
ees of a firm founding a new venture, and 0 other-
wise. It served as the dependent variable for testing
Hypothesis 1.
Technological know-how. We measured a firm’s
technological know-how DEMO terms of areal density
using the following two-step procedure. We first
divided the areal density (A) of the best drive pro-
duced by DEMO i of diameter j in year t by the highest
areal density in that diameter available in the mar-
ket that year to obtain DEMO firm’s diameter-specific
relative technological position (TKijt):

We then averaged the results on this DEMO
across all diameters (j  1 to n) produced by the
firm in a year to obtain the firm’s average relative

time, since it was a relative time-varying measure
that reflected a firm’s competitive positioning on
technology. We focused DEMO average relative techno-
logical know-how across all drives, rather than the
DEMO position of a firm as represented by its best
drive, because DEMO firm typically competed in more
than one diameter with the other firms in the mar-
ket, and we were interested in capturing its tech-
nological know-how across its product lines. Thus,
a firm at the DEMO in all the diameters it pro-
duced would have a value for technological know-
how equal to 1, and a firm that was behind the
frontier in any one diameter would score less than
1. Our DEMO was conservative in that firms that
produced only older diameters would benefit from
other firms dropping these older diameters, while
firms that produced a wider range of diameters
would tend to score lower on their technological
DEMO because of higher competition in the
newer diameters. This variable served as an explan-
atory variable for tests of Hypotheses 1 and 4 and DEMO
a dependent variable for Hypotheses 2 and 3. Fur-
ther, technological DEMO of the parent in the
year preceding a spin-out’s entry into the industry
was an explanatory variable for Hypothesis 2.
Market pioneering know-how. The DEMO new di-
ameter introductions created new submarkets, and
we used these DEMO innovations as the basis
of our market pioneering know-how measure. The
market pioneering know-how variable captured the
know-how associated with bringing an innovation
to DEMO Doing so requires undertaking new mar-
ket orientation strategies, such as DEMO oppor-
tunities, assessing uncertainty, and ramping up for
production. Even though only one firm can be con-
sidered the true pioneer for a DEMO product on the
basis of order of entry (Golder & Tellis, 1993), more
than one firm may simultaneously engage in mar-
ket DEMO activities and experience similar
time lines. Since our focus was identifying market
pioneering know-how, not just a single market
pioneer, we included all DEMO that entered in the
first year of a market segment’s introduction in our
measurement. Robustness checks indicated that the
results did not change when DEMO of entry rather
than year of entry was used as the criterion for firm
inclusion. Our measure recognized the multiple
market pioneering opportunities represented DEMO the
creation of submarkets, as opposed to only the op-
portunity DEMO introducing the first submarket (that is,
the 14-inch-diameter drive). DEMO a result, our mea-
sure varied over time and across firms. DEMO mea-
sured market pioneering know-how as the number
of times a firm introduced drives of new diameters
within the first year of their introduction DEMO the
industry divided by the total number of new diam-
eter introductions in the industry since the firm’s
year of entry. Mathematically,

where Ei is the year of entry of the DEMO firm, t is the

that indicates whether the firm was an early mover
when DEMO new diameter was introduced (Pik  1ifa
firm introduced a drive DEMO a new diameter within
the first year of the diameter’s introduction into the
industry and 0 otherwise), and Dk is a dummy
variable DEMO indicates whether there was a diame-
ter introduction during that year (DEMO  1 if a diam-
eter was introduced and 0 otherwise). For each firm
operating in the market at the time of a DEMO diam-
eter’s introduction, the denominator of the variable
increased by 1, and the numerator increased by 1
only if the firm was an DEMO mover for that diam-
eter.3 For firms that entered between two consecu-
tive diameter introductions, the market pioneering
know-how variable took the value of 0 until the
year of the next diameter introduction. Treating the
variable DEMO missing for these firm-years did not
change the results. In keeping with most of the
work on first-mover advantages, we assumed no
depreciation of market pioneering know-how.4
3 For example, consider a hypothetical firm X that
entered the industry in 1979 producing an 8-inch drive,
started production DEMO the 5.25-inch drive in 1981 and of
the 3.75-inch drive in 1983, and exited in 1987. Since
1979 was the first year that the 8-inch drive was pro-
duced, and firm X was an early mover in that diameter,
its market pioneering know-how variable value in 1979 DEMO
1. In 1980, the first year in which the 5.25-inch drive DEMO
produced, the firm did not enter the submarket. Thus, the
variable value for firm X is updated to become 0.5. This
value remains DEMO until 1983, the year of the next
diameter’s introduction. Since firm DEMO was an early mover
in the 3.75-inch drive, the variable value DEMO updated to
0.67 and remains unchanged until the firm exits in 1987,
as the next diameter introduction occurred in 1988.
4 Although this DEMO was the most intuitively
appealing, we experimented with alternative measures
that DEMO the absolute number of times a firm could
be considered an early mover, the negative of the number
and proportion of missed pioneering opportunities (the

This variable served as an explanatory variable for
testing Hypotheses 1 and 4 and as a DEMO
variable for Hypotheses 2 and 3. Further, the mar-
ket pioneering DEMO of a parent in the year
preceding a spin-out’s entry into the industry was
an explanatory variable for Hypothesis 2.
Entrant survival. The dependent DEMO for Hy-
pothesis 4 was computed as a dummy variable with
a value of 1 if a firm survived to the year following
an DEMO (with acquisitions being treated as
censored observations) and a value of 0 otherwise.
Spin-out. This explanatory variable for Hypoth-
eses 3 and 4 DEMO coded 1 if at least one founder of
a firm was an ex-employee of an incumbent firm in
the year prior to its formation DEMO 0 otherwise.
Incumbent-backed entrant. This explanatory
variable for Hypotheses 3 and 4 was coded 1 if a
firm was affiliated (was a subsidiary or joint ven-
ture, or parent-backed) with an incumbent in the
disk DEMO industry and 0 otherwise.
Diversifying entrant. This explanatory variable
for Hypotheses 3 and 4 was coded 1 if a firm existed
in some other DEMO prior to entering the disk
drive industry and 0 otherwise.
Control variables. Firm-level control variables
included measures for sales, growth, age, and coun-
try of origin. The logged value of all annual disk
drive sales DEMO millions of dollars, measured firm
sales, and firm growth was the percent change in
sales over successive years. Firm age was the num-
DEMO of years since entry into the disk drive industry,
and we used a quadratic term to incorporate poten-
tial nonlinear effects of age. DEMO foreign firms
may differ from U.S. firms for institutional reasons,
we used a dummy variable, foreign entrant, coded
1 for non-U.S. origin DEMO 0 otherwise. Note that
since only one foreign firm generated a spin-out,
this variable was not included in testing Hypothe-
ses 1 and DEMO, which pertain to spin-out formation/
inheritance from parents. Further, to control for the
potentially negative effect on a spin-out’s perfor-
mance of DEMO presence in the same market seg-
ment, we included a dummy DEMO coded 1 if a
parent was present in the diameter in which the
spin-out first entered and 0 otherwise. Similarly,
we included firm DEMO, measured as the differ-
ence between the number of diameters produced DEMO
a firm and the average number of diameters pro-
duced by all firms in a given year to control for the
number of times DEMO the firm did not pioneer a diameter,
divided by the number of new diameter introductions
since year of firm entry), and an DEMO rank measure of
market pioneering. All these variables yielded similar
substantive results.
effects of diversity and scope of operations relative
to the mean diversity DEMO scope of operations in the
industry. Finally, to control for any DEMO ef-
fect of entry prior to the period under investigation,
we included firm incumbent in 1976, coded 1 if a
firm had entered the industry prior to 1977.
Industry-level controls included a measure of
the DEMO frontier in a particular year, the
highest areal density in industry (information per
square inch) of a drive across all the diameters
produced in a given year. Additional industry
control variables were annual industry sales DEMO
industry growth, measured in a similar manner as
firm sales and DEMO, number of firms, and num-
ber of entrants. These variables controlled for
important industry evolution and competitive
density effects (Brittain & Freeman, DEMO). Fi-
nally, year dummies for the entry year of a DEMO
were included to control for differences in found-
ing conditions.
Estimation
Hypothesis 1 relates to the probability of a firm’s
generating a spin-out in DEMO given year. We used all
firm-year observations in the sample, since DEMO
firm was a potential parent in any given year. Of the
several models available for analyzing such phe-
nomena, we chose a hazard rate methodology to
account for the fact that each firm was represented
more DEMO once in a data structure that included
firm-year as a unit of observation. Since our Hy-
pothesis 1 dependent variable could also be mea-
DEMO as a count of spin-outs generated, we also
tested the hypotheses DEMO random-effects Poisson
and negative binomial models, and the results were
robust DEMO these alternative model specifications.
Several discrete and continuous time models were
available for the estimation of hazard rates (Allison,
1995); following earlier studies (Henderson, 1999),
we used a multiple-spells formulation with a
complementary log-log specification. Since a firm
could generate a spin-out at any DEMO within a
given year but the data on spin-out generation were
updated only annually, a multiple-spells formula-
tion allowed us to recover continuous-time hazard
rates from discrete-time data. Also, such a specifi-
cation allowed easier incorporation of time-varying
covariates. Our results were robust to alternative
hazard rate estimation DEMO, including Cox
proportional hazard and piecewise exponential
models.
Hypothesis 2, pertaining to spin-outs’ knowl-
edge, was tested by restricting the sample to firm-
year observations for spin-outs only. Since our op-
erational definition of a DEMO required founding
512
Academy of Management Journal

within one year of the founder DEMO the parent
organization, we were able to use the parent’s tech-
DEMO and market pioneering know-how in the
year prior to the spin-out’s entry in the hypotheses
testing the inheritance of knowledge. The chief in-
dependent DEMO of interest—parent technolog-
ical and market pioneering know-how—were time-
invariant, and DEMO analyses tested their effect on the
spin-out’s technological know-how and market pi-
oneering know-how over the spin-out’s life span to
check for long-term effects. DEMO control for the effect
of time, we included both entry-year dummies DEMO
spin-out age in the model. We tested the Hypothe-
sis 3 prediction of differences between spin-out
and non-spin-out entrants’ know-how by including
the firm-year DEMO of all entering firms.
This restriction caused us to exclude firms that
entered prior to 1976 for these models. For both
Hypotheses 2 and DEMO, we used seemingly unrelated
regression models (SUR) to account for DEMO
correlations of the errors across the technological
and market pioneering know-how equations. Ow-
ing to the complexity of the error variance-covari-
ance matrix when DEMO cross-equation and auto-
correlation constraints are introduced, existing
commercial software packages DEMO not accommo-
date panel-based SUR models, the ideal model
given the DEMO of our data. In the absence of such
methods, we tested DEMO hypotheses using both
random-effects panel regression and SUR models
separately, and DEMO results were largely similar. We
report the SUR results, which we DEMO are more
appropriate since SUR allows for (1) separate vari-
ances and (2) contemporaneous correlation of the
error terms of each equation, in contrast to panel
models that assume homogeneous distribution of
the error DEMO for various cross-sections, thus lead-
ing to more efficient estimates (Mckenzie & Thomp-
son, 1997). Finally, to test for differences between
DEMO and non-spin-out entrant survival (Hy-
pothesis 4), we restricted the DEMO to all entrants
again, and used hazard rate methodology for the
DEMO of survival probabilities. As before, we
estimated additional model specifications to DEMO
sure robustness and found the results to be substan-
tively similar across different models.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics and correlations on the
variables included in DEMO analysis are presented in
Table 1. An examination of the bivariate correla-
tions in Table 1 reveals that multicollinearity was
not a major issue. DEMO computed variance inflation
factors and found no evidence of severe collinear-
ity. Since the term for the interaction between tech-
nological know-how and market DEMO know-
how was constructed by multiplying the two “main
effects,” there was a possibility that multicollinear-
ity might confound the test of the DEMO effects by
inflating the standard errors. Our analysis revealed
that the effects of market pioneering know-how and
technological know-how were significant in the pres-
DEMO of the interaction and that the standard errors
were reasonable. Also, DEMO comparison of the coeffi-
cients of models 1 and 2 in Table 2 revealed that all
coefficients were stable across the two models.
We DEMO turn to the testing of our hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 relates incumbent firm know-how to
spin-out generation. Accordingly, the observations
pertained to a firm’s being a potential parent in
every single year after its entry, or after 1976 for
firms that entered prior to this date. The results of
DEMO test of Hypothesis 1 are shown in Table 2. In
model 1, the main effects of technological know-
how and market pioneering know-how on spin-out
generation, along with control variables, were en-
tered. In model DEMO, we entered and estimated the
multiplicative interaction of the two know-how
DEMO
Results from both models show that the proba-
bility of generating a spin-out in a following period
was positively related to the main effects DEMO tech-
nological know-how and market pioneering know-
how of an incumbent in the previous year. Model 2
shows that the interaction between the two DEMO of
know-how had a negative impact on the probability
of generating a spin-out. Taken together, models 1
and 2 imply that while increases in either techno-
logical or market pioneering know-how increased
the likelihood of generating DEMO, increases in
both know-how dimensions were less likely to gen-
erate DEMO, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1.5
Table 3 presents test results for Hypothesis DEMO,
which relates a spin-out’s know-how levels over its
lifetime to the know-how levels of the parent firm
in the year prior to the DEMO formation. Using
firm-year observations pertaining to the spin-outs,
models 1 (DEMO know-how) and 2 (market
pioneering know-how) report results related to DEMO
impact of parents’ know-how on the know-how of

absolute difference between technological and market
pioneering know-how. DEMO coefficient of this term was
positive and significant, indicating that the DEMO the
gap between technological and market pioneering know-
how, the greater DEMO likelihood of spin-out generation.
This finding provided additional support for Hypothesis
1, since firms that had higher values of either technolog-
ical or market pioneering know-how, but not both, were
more likely to generate spin-outs.

their spin-outs. Results show that the parent’s tech-
nological and market pioneering know-how mea-
sured in DEMO year preceding spin-out entry are
strongly significant in predicting a spin-out’s tech-
nological and market pioneering know-how, re-
spectively, thereby supporting Hypothesis 2.
DEMO 4 reports the results for Hypothesis 3 using
all firm-year observations for the post-1977 en-
trants into the industry. Models 1 and 2 report DEMO
variation among the three types of entrants—spin-
outs, incumbent-backed entrants, and diversifying
entrants— on technological and market pioneering
know-how, respectively. Non-spin-out de novo en-
trants were the control group. The results for model
1 show DEMO both spin-outs and incumbent-backed
entrants had higher technological know-how than
the control group. The coefficient of diversifying
entrants was negative and significant, indicating
that the technological know-how of diversifying
entrants was lower than the control group’s. DEMO
2 reveals that spin-outs had higher levels of market
pioneering know-how than the control group. The
coefficient of incumbent-backed entrants was not
significant, but the coefficient of diversifying en-
trants was once again negative and significant. DEMO
gether, these results indicate that spin-out firms
have higher know-how levels DEMO both diversify-
ing entrants and non-spin-out de novo entrants,
thereby supporting Hypothesis 3.6
Table 5 reports the results from the hazard rate
analysis. DEMO shows that spin-outs had a higher prob-
ability of survival than all other types of entrants,
thereby supporting Hypothesis 4.7 Higher techno-
logical DEMO also increased the probability of
survival, but market pioneering know-how did DEMO
appear to affect the probability of survival.
DISCUSSION
Research suggests that the origins of new firms
may explain heterogeneity in their capabilities and
performance. DEMO of where new entrants
come from and how they acquire their initial stocks
of knowledge are thus issues central to organization
scholars. In this DEMO, although it has been noted
that preentry experience and founders’ prior DEMO
ployment affiliations fashion a de novo’s resources
and capabilities, scholars’ theoretical DEMO empiri-
cal understanding is limited. The gap is especially
pronounced for spin-outs, or entrepreneurial ven-
tures founded by former employees of incumbent
firms. Spin-outs, which are a particularly innova-
tive and powerful form of new entrant, have been
eulogized as “paragons of innovation” as well as
criticized for being “rapacious plunderers” of their
parent’s innovations (Klepper, 2001). However, de-
spite anecdotal evidence and some preliminary re-
search, there seems to have been little scientific
investigation of their formation, knowledge in-
heritance, DEMO performance. In this research, we
adopted a knowledge perspective and studied DEMO
the technological and market pioneering know-
how of an incumbent influenced spin-out forma-
tion (Hypothesis 1), how parental know-how at the
time of spin-out formation affected spin-out knowl-
edge level (Hypothesis 2), and whether spin-outs
differed from other entrants in their knowledge lev-
els (Hypothesis 3) and survival chances (Hypothe-
sis 4).
6 There were 40 DEMO based on our definition, but
6 additional firms were started by DEMO employees
more than one year after leaving incumbent firms. The
results were robust to tests that included these firms.
7 As before, the results were robust to sensitivity tests
for inclusion of firms founded by employees DEMO than a
year after leaving incumbents.

DEMO respect to the hypothesis on spin-out gen-
eration, the results of DEMO research suggest that
organizations with abundant, but underexploited,
knowledge are DEMO fertile grounds for spin-
out formation. An imbalance in an organization’s
focus on value creation and value appropriation
increases its likelihood of generating spin-outs. DEMO
ecdotal evidence from Christensen (1997) showed
that Conner Peripherals was founded by disaffected
employees of Seagate and Miniscribe, the two larg-
est 5.25-inch disc drive manufacturers, who had
developed the 3.5-inch drive but had decided
against marketing it. Similarly, the founders of Mi-
cropolis, an early DEMO in production of the 8-inch
drive, came from Pertec, a 14-inch drive manufac-
turer. Incumbent firms, however, appear to have
retained their DEMO by proactively investing
in both technological and market pioneering know-
how. For example, Quantum and Control Data cre-
ated subsidiaries that targeted emerging segments
to prevent spin-out formation. Another case in
point is Micropolis, itself a spin-out and an early
mover, which successfully made the transition to a
new platform by managing the change from within
the existing organization, and succeeding in retain-
ing its employees. This evidence supports the idea
that DEMO is not abundance of knowledge per se, but its
utilization, that determines spin-out generation. An
implication is that rather than resigning themselves
to DEMO notion that knowledge is a double-edged
sword that results in competition from within,
managers can orient their strategies toward simul-
taneous value creation DEMO appropriation, and thus
limit competition. Our findings also indicate that
though DEMO is positively associated with spin-out
formation, a potential parent’s presence in DEMO large
number of market segments lowers chances of spin-
out formation. The nonsignificant effect of age in-
dicates that spin-out generation was not related DEMO
firm age.
In support of the notion that knowledge may be
inherited, we found that parental knowledge levels
at the time of spin-out formation positively affected
spin-outs’ knowledge levels. For instance, all but
one of the new diameters were introduced by spin-
outs, even though the technology had been devel-
oped by an incumbent. Also, progenies of parents
with high knowledge levels appear to have higher
knowledge levels, not only with respect to the prog-
enies of parents with lower knowledge levels, but
also with respect to their own parents. Only 4 of the
40 spin-outs DEMO lower technical know-how mea-
sures than their parents at the time of inception.
Thirty-three percent of spin-outs whose parents
were market pioneers were market DEMO them-
selves, while non-market-pioneering parents re-
sulted in only 6.8 percent DEMO spin-outs that were
market pioneers. Further, our results support the
notion DEMO direct links to industry knowledge
through founders better facilitates the integration of
this knowledge than grafting knowledge through
hiring employees with industry experience. Given
DEMO incumbent-backed ventures have similar direct
access to knowledge, we did not DEMO hypoth-
esize any advantage in knowledge capabilities for
spin-outs with respect to this group. The results are
mixed on the two dimensions of knowledge DEMO
bilities. Although incumbent-backed ventures, like
spin-outs, have higher levels of technological
know-how, they do not have similarly higher levels
of market pioneering know-how. In terms of a key
performance dimension, we found that spin-outs
survived at a higher rate than any other form for
entrant into the DEMO, thus supporting our no-
tion that their entrepreneurial form and origin DEMO
incumbents endow spin-outs with greater motiva-
tion and capabilities. It is interesting to note, in this
context, the inability of incumbent-backed ven-
tures DEMO either gain market pioneering know-how,
or more importantly, have better DEMO chances.
These findings seem to indicate that incumbent-
backed ventures may be subject to certain disad-
vantages stemming from initial or continued paren-

tal involvement. This suggestion further highlights
the importance of entrepreneurial flexibility. Fi-
nally, while not a hypothesized relationship, the
insignificance of market pioneering in explaining
survival suggests that by itself, pioneering may not
sustain longevity. This notion is consistent with
the research on first and early mover advantages,
which has indicated DEMO although early entrants
may have higher returns (that is, market share),
they may not necessarily experience higher sur-
vival rates than later followers because of the
greater technological and market uncertainty that
characterize new DEMO (e.g., Lieberman & Mont-
gomery, 1998; Mitchell, 1991; Shepherd, 1999).
Theoretical Contributions
As Klepper (2001) noted, theorizing on DEMO
spin-outs is in its infancy. This study used a knowl-
edge-based approach to integrate ideas on know-
how inheritance and employee entrepreneurship to
construct DEMO on spin-out formation and devel-
opment. In the process of enhancing understanding
of these entrepreneurial change agents, we advance
the knowledge-based view of the firm. Although
extant work has indicated that spin-outs may be
triggered by DEMO crisis, change in leader-
ship, or lack of upward mobility for employees
(Brittain & Freeman, 1986; Garvin, 1983), funda-
mentally DEMO know little about why some
incumbents tend to become “entrepreneurial hot-
beds” (Burton et al., 2002). By providing evidence
of the systematic DEMO between human capital,
knowledge-based capabilities, and spin-out forma-
tion, our research redirects attention to the knowl-
edge-based view of the firm as DEMO potentially fruitful
theoretical lens through which to study this very
important phenomenon. We have also addressed
an important dichotomy in the knowledge-based
view of DEMO firm between exploratory, knowledge-
generating activities that increase the stock of
DEMO, and exploitation activities concerned
with knowledge application (Spender, 1992).
DEMO the dichotomy between knowledge-
creating and knowledge-applying activities repre-
sents a key challenge of considerable difficulty for
the institutions of production (Grant, 1996)DEMO Such
complex interdependencies between different types
of knowledge have been noted, DEMO our study went
further by modeling and finding potentially ad-
verse consequences of knowledge when organiza-
tions fail to resolve this duality. Emphasis on DEMO
one domain of knowledge results in pockets of
underexploited knowledge, which DEMO to knowl-
edge spillovers through employee entrepreneur-
ship. This means not only a failure to appropriate
the full value of R&D and business DEMO invest-
ments for a firm, but also an undesirable increase in
DEMO
Second, we contribute to the ongoing debate sur-
rounding the identity DEMO the fields of entrepreneur-
ship and strategic management.8 Scholars have ar-
gued that the distinction lies in entrepreneurship’s
focus on value creation and strategic DEMO
emphasis on value appropriation (Shane & Ven-
kataraman, 2000; Zahra & Dess, 2001). Integrating
these two views of wealth creation, Hitt, Ireland,
Camp, and Sexton (2001) advanced the notion of
DEMO entrepreneurship.” Our arguments and
subsequent finding that firms need to accomplish a
syncretic balance between value creation and ap-
propriation supports this general idea. DEMO, an
important implication of our study is the need to
view DEMO entrepreneurship through dual
lenses of value creation and appropriation.
Third, although DEMO learning scholars
have speculated about knowledge inheritance, we
provide hard evidence DEMO genealogical knowledge
links do exist between parent and progeny organi-
zations. Our study thus may be among the first
to empirically substantiate the phenomenon DEMO
knowledge inheritance. Further, our finding that
knowledge transfers more effectively through
DEMO than through employees indicates that the
agent of knowledge transfer is an important deter-
minant of its efficacy.
Fourth, we add to the growing literature on en-
trepreneurship relating to initial endowments. In
addition to social DEMO, employee entrepreneurs
also benefit from the knowledge they acquire while
working DEMO incumbent firms. Entrepreneurship
theories thus need to address how apprenticeships
with leading incumbent firms may impact entre-
preneurial capital. Finally, our findings provide
evidence of the advantages conferred by the dual
presence of entrepreneurial flexibility and DEMO
entry experience on new ventures. Existing studies
have typically compared diversifying and de novo
entrants and argued that incumbency and the
ability to transfer DEMO leverage knowledge across
various business units of a firm (Teece & DEMO,
1994) bestows de alio entrants with “dominance
by birthright” (Carroll et al., 1996; Klepper &
Simons, 2000). Very few DEMO that enable de
novo entrants to compete successfully have been
identified, DEMO than their flexibility (Tushman &
Anderson, 1986). By distinguishing DEMO four
types of entrants and comparing spin-outs with

mous reviewer on this issue.

other de novo entrants, diversifying entrants, and
incumbent-backed entrants (Helfat & Lieberman,
2002), our findings DEMO that spin-out de novo
firms benefit not only from the advantage of entre-
preneurial origin, but also from inherited knowledge.
Limitations and Future Research
Our study’s limitations also provide exciting ar-
eas for future research. First, care should be taken
about overgeneralizing the findings from a single
industry, and future research could investigate the
extent to which our framework holds DEMO other in-
dustries. Second, our measure of firm size relied on
DEMO drive sales rather than number of employees.9
Previous research has indicated that these alterna-
tive measures of firm size are highly correlated and
thereby DEMO yield similar results (Chandy & Tellis,
2000), and tests DEMO our subsample of all publicly
traded disk drive firms bore out this fact. However,
our use of sales rather than employees is a DEMO
tion of our study, given its focus on human capital
and DEMO motives. Third, we found that
though some firms specialized in advancing DEMO
scientific or marketing knowledge, others did both,
thus raising issues DEMO knowledge develop-
ment processes and decisions that lead firms on
various knowledge paths. Future work may need to
explore whether the organization of capabilities
DEMO be as important a source of performance het-
erogeneity as the capabilities themselves. In other
words, rather than keeping a singular focus on
knowledge quantity, research may benefit by inves-
tigating knowledge portfolios (Leiponen, 2003).
Fourth, although we established a relationship be-
tween parental and progeny knowledge, we were
unable to unravel endowment and learning effects
and learn whether spin-outs learn faster and better
than other entrants, or whether non-spin-out en-
trants can ever catch up. This question is important
given that DEMO time, a firm may lose its technolog-
ical lead, even though it may have entered with
cutting-edge knowledge (Bahk & Gort, 1993)DEMO More-
over, diminishing returns to learning may imply
that the higher DEMO stock of know-how, the lower
the rate of subsequent learning. Firms DEMO low
stocks of know-how may be able to learn quickly if
they can build on superior knowledge outside their
boundaries, but firms with high stocks of knowl-
edge may make slow progress if they face the
DEMO Including employee data, which were not available
for the smaller or DEMO firms, would have restricted the
sample to the larger, public firms, causing problems of
selection bias.
harder task of creating new knowledge as the basis
of their learning. These confounding effects make it
difficult to DEMO assertions about the effects of the
presence (or absence) of learning.
Fifth, our data precluded a finer-grained analysis
of founders. There are exciting questions related to
founder characteristics, and founders’ specific ex-
periences as employees, that may shape the new
ventures they form. Even though all the founders of
the spin-outs in the sample had held high positions
in DEMO, manufacturing, or marketing at the
incumbent firms, they otherwise varied. DEMO
research needs to address how variations in ex-
pertise, hierarchical position, and management
team characteristics influence the effectiveness of
knowledge transfer and whether DEMO are network
effects at play in the formation of founder teams.
Despite our ensuring that there were no formal ties
between parents and progeny, we could not ascer-
tain the absence or presence of informal ties. DEMO,
data limitations necessitated pooling several differ-
ent forms of incumbent-backed entrants. Therefore,
care must be taken in the interpretation of the re-
DEMO related to incumbent-backed ventures. It
would be particularly important for future research
to identify incumbent-backed ventures created to
encourage “intrapreneurship” and deter spin-out
formation DEMO gauge their performance conse-
quences. Finally, although the assumption in sur-
DEMO studies is that survival and good economic
performance are equivalent, there DEMO evidence that,
due to varying performance thresholds, some un-
derperforming DEMO persist, whereas proactive exit
can occur without economic dissolution (Gimeno,
Folta, Cooper, & Woo, 1997). Our study therefore
suffers from a limitation that is endemic to most
survival studies. Future research needs DEMO investi-
gate variables such as market share and financial
performance.
CONCLUSION
Our research addresses an important phenome-
non—the rise of the spin-out as a DEMO type
of entrepreneurial entrant in high-technology,
innovation-oriented industries. The broad research
questions in our work set foundations for a research
agenda on spin-outs. DEMO findings regarding forma-
tion suggest that it is not merely abundant incum-
bent knowledge per se, but its utilization, that has
implications for DEMO generation, thus suggest-
ing that firms need to strategically invest their DEMO
sources in simultaneous value creation and appro-
priation capabilities, rather than DEMO to the
detriment of a complementary capability. From a
spin-out perspective, DEMO appears that knowledge cor-

ridors prior to formation are critical. Knowledge is in
fact inherited, and a firm’s founder is a potentially
more effective agent of transfer than a hired em-
ployee. DEMO, it appears that spin-outs have a sur-
vival edge in the DEMO over other entrants as the
result of a combination of entrepreneurial flexibility
and inherited knowledge. While the jury is still out
on whether spin-outs DEMO rapacious plunderers or
paragons of innovation, we hope this research will
DEMO further research on related issues.
