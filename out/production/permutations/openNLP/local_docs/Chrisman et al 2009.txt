as a r esult o f the different priorities f lowi ng fr om family Influence, even when the two types
of f irms possess comparable levels of resource stocks. Using DEMO ierarc hical r egression to
analyze data f rom a national study of the Small Bu siness Development Center program, we

relationships between d ifferent categories of resource stocks and performance. Specifically,
family firms benefit more from resource stocks based on external relation DEMO while
nonfamil y firms benefit more f rom resource stocks based on functional s kltls.
Introduction
Rece nt eviden ce suggests that family firms DEMO tperform no nfami ly fi nns (e.g.. Ander-
son & Reeb, 2003; McConaughy, Matthew s, & Fialko, 2001; M iller & Le Breton-M iller.
2005); however, t he exact mechanisms and processes that lead to these pe rformance
differences remain to be studied in DEMO Thus, there is a growing recognitio n that a better
understandi DEMO of how family involve ment infl ue nces performance is es sential for progress
in the fi eld of fami ly business (Habbershon, DEMO, & MacMilla n. 2003).
Of the theo retical frameworks availab DEMO to explain t he differences between the per-
fonnance of family and n o nfamil y firms, t he reso urce-based view (R DEMO) of the firm as
conceptualized by Dieric kx and Cool (1 989), Barney (1991), a nd ot hers hold pa rticular
promise (C hrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005; Ha bbershon & Williams, 1999; Habbershon
et al. , 2003). RBV pred icts DEMO hat a finn ' s perfor mance w ill be a ffected not only by the level
and nature o f its resource s DEMO but also by how the resources are deployed and explo ited.
Based on this, res earchers (e.g., Arregle, Hitt. Si rtnon, & Very, 2007; Sharma & Mani-
kutty, 2005; Sirmon & Hilt, 2003) have conce ptual ized how famil y involvement may
produce differences between famil y and non family fi rms in te rms o DEMO the level and na ture

of res ources as we ll as how reso urces w ill DEMO deployed und exploited. However. few
studies have provided em pirical evidence a bout these di fferences a nd how they impact
perfo rmance.
To DEMO this gap in the literature. we utilize Mi ller and Le Breton- Mill er ' s (2005.
2006) 4-C framework to develop hypotheses DEMO how the priorit ies of family fi rms lead
to d ifferences in the configuration of resource stocks t hat affect their pe rform DEMO vis-is-
vis nonfami ly firms. We use data e xtracted f rom a survey cond ucted by the S mall Business
Development Center (SBDC) program in the Un ited States in 2002 to te st the hypotheses.
Our study contributes to the fami ly business literature by pro DEMO a theory-based
res ponse to a ca ll for invest igat ions about how diffe rences between family and no nfamily
fi rms affect DEMO relative performance (e.g.. Chrisman er nl.. 2005: Shar ma. Chris ma n. &
Chua. 1997). We contribute to the development of a theory of the family firm by co ncep-
t ualiz ing and DEMO how family fi rm priorit ies affect the re lationship between resource
stoc ks and firm performance.
In the rema inder of this article. DEMO review the literature and discuss its appl ication to
famil y businesses. Then we d evelop our model and hypotheses. Fo ll ow ing DEMO hat. we present
o ur research methodology and res ults. In the fi nal section. we discuss our findi ngs a nd
their i DEMO tions for theory and future researc h.
Priorities and Resource Stocks
That family firms may embrace differen t p riorities is well accepted by DEMO hers
( Gcrsick. Da vis. Hampton. & Lan sberg. 1997: Shar DEMO et al.. 1997). Prio rities are im por-
tant because they a ffect the types and levels of invest me nts a famil DEMO fi nn makes in
developi ng and ac quiring reso urces over ti me. In tum. these "resource flows" from t he
invest DEMO ts made w ill lead to the accumulation of " resource s toc ks" ( Dierickx & Cool.

or acq uire a DEMO inable co mpetitive adva ntage. d epending on t he extent to which the
resource stocks are va luable, rure, in imitable. and DEMO ble (Barney. 199 1).
Recen tly. a compact framework-the 4·C DEMO was proposed by Miller a nd Le
Breton-Mill er (2005) as a way (0 cha racte rize highly successful family fi rms in terms of
{he ir prio rities. The fou r priorities are: ( I) continuity. the firm's pursuance of lo ng-term
o bjectives: ( 2) c ommand. the freedo m and a bi lity to DEMO a da ptive d ecisions: ( 3) con-
nection. the fi rm' s relationshi p with o uts ide partners : and (DEMO) c o mmunity. the priority
g ive n to building a DEMO roup of committed and motivated people (Mi ller & Le B DEMO
p. 34). A lthough Mi ll er and Le Breton -Miller discuss these concept' s se parately. it is clear
that they do not consider them to be independent. Indeed, those authors argue that it is the
combinat ion of the four priorities thatmake some fami ly DEMO great.
Prio rities conce rning co ntinuity. command . comm unity, DEMO nd connec tio n are not ex-
clusi ve to family fi rms: but the priorit ies of family fi rms may be different from those of
no nfamily fi rms in intensi ty, natu re. and the manner in which they are applied because
family in volvement DEMO ndows famil y firms with d ifferen t characterist ic att ributes and leads
to the pursuit of d ifferent goals (Chrisman er a l.. 2005: Klein. Ast rachan . & Smy rnios.
2005: M DEMO & Le Breton- M iller. 2005). The un ique au n butes. goals. and resu lting
priori ties o f fa mily fi DEMO ca n produce the following im portant consequences.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THE
ORY and PRACTICE
First, if the pri orities of family and nonfamily firms differ, DEMO res ulting re source
s toc ks acc umulated f rom invest ments made according to thes e priori ties s ho uld also DEMO of
a d ifferent type, even if not o f a DEMO category (e.g., a paternalistic rather than a
p rofessional relationship be tween owners. managers. and employees). Se cond, owi ng to
path dependencies and interconnected ness in t he deve lopment and accu mu DEMO of
resources (Barney. 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989), it DEMO be diffi c ult for non family fi rms
to duplicate the resource stocks of family fi rms (e.g., s witching from a DEMO
orie nted cultu re based on professional rel ations hips t o a people-oriented culture based on
pa ternalistic relationships). Third, because family firms have d ifferent priorities based on
different goal s. they are DEMO li kely to diverge from nonfamily fi rms in the manne r in w hich
t hey utilize their resource stocks (e.g., using DEMO to build long-te rm e mployee
comm itment and st ewardship rather than profes sional perfor mance-based criteria to
reduce opport unism). Fi DEMO, diffe rences in the types and a pplication of resource stoc DEMO
between family and nonfamily firms could lead 10 variatio ns in the ir relative performance.
In s ummary, even if fami ly and nc nfamil y fi rms invest in resources t hat are generi-
c DEMO si milar, they may make t heir investme nts in different DEMO, in diffe rent amounts. and
for different purposes (Miller & Le Breton-Mil ler, 2005). Whe n they d o so, fami DEMO and
nonfamily firms may exhibit substantial pe rformance variations even tho ug h the resource
s tocks they possess may be simi lar in DEMO category and amount.
Hy pothesis Development and Model
In t his section. we first discuss what the literature ind icates are the typic al DEMO n-
sh ips between particular categories of resou rce stocks and per formance. We t hen extend
the lite rature by developing hypotheses about DEMO moderating infl uence of famil y fi rm
priorities in terms of continuit y, command, connect ion. and community. The model and
hypo DEMO a re intended to explain why family firms, with similar levels DEMO resource stocks
of a partic ular category will ac hieve higher performance than nonfamily firms. ' The
hypotheses are c onsistent wi th Carne DEMO' s (2005) discuss ion of personali sm and particu lar-
DEMO as sources o f family fi rms' competitive ad vantages and DEMO Breton- Mille r and Miller' s
(2006) emphasis on continuity DEMO command priorities. Finally. we present our model to
s ummarize our arguments and hypotheses.
We focus on three broad ca tegories of resource stoc DEMO t hat firms acc umulate based on
their priori ties of continuity. command. connect ion, and commu nity. The first is external
relationships. defined as resource s toc ks embedded in the social capital a finn DEMO cures over
time through its d ealings with constit uencies outside the organization. We meas ure these
in terms of supplier re lations, loyal customers. banking relationships, and reputat ion.
Second, internal relationships are de DEMO ned as res ource stocks de veloped by investing in
rela tionships with intra-org aniza tional stake holde rs. In this study. these include DEMO ommit-
ted managers. owner-manage r trust, de dicated e mployees . DEMO an act ive board of

fu nctio nal resou rce stocks in this DEMO
Although we reco gnize that the generic and speci fic ca tegories o f resources we study
are o nly a partial list of DEMO possi ble reso urces. they do appear to be representative of both
the primary resources discussed in the literature (Chrisman. Bauerschmidr. & Hofer.
1998) and t he o nes family firms a re particula rly suited to dep loy (Carney. 2005: Habber-
shon & Williams. 1999: Sirmo n & Hill. 2003). As s uggested in the lite rature DEMO described
below. we expect resource s rocks a nd firm perfonn ance 10 be pos itively related (Ba rric k
& Mo unt 1991: Chandler & Hanks. 1994).
External resource stocks are import ant. Organizations mus t know who controls c ri t i-
ca l resou DEMO and how to interact w ith those external s takeholde rs in o rder to maximize
tra nsact io n efficiency and e ffectiveness. DEMO relations hips between an o rganization
and its sup pliers. cus tomers. and other co nstituencies can a lso be thought of as a DEMO n
o f the strength o f its social net works. which are needed to gain leg itimacy and access to
resources (Granovener. 1985). Many studies suggest t hat stro ng external social networks
are DEMO related to perfor mance (e.g.• Karra. Tracey, & Phill ips . 2006: McE vily &
Zaheer. 1999).
Internal resource stoc ks DEMO the form of s trong re lations hips among internal stakehold-
e rs c an facilitate co mmunication. intra- firm learning, and en treprene urial behavior (Ad ler
& Kwon . 2002: Sir mon & DEMO . 2003). Re lations hips that result in inte rnal social capital
will in tum posit ively influence the c reation of human DEMO (Coleman. 1988), and as
social capital is bas ed on DEMO rust. t he risk of opportu nistic behavior wil l be reduced ( Bradacb
& Everett. 1989). For exa mple, re searc h on fa mily fi rms suggests that not o nly can good
DEMO hips between family ow ners a nd fami ly ma nagers improve performance
(Eddleston & Ke lle rrnanns. 2(07). bur also good relationships between family managers
and employees c an foster init iative and DEMO (Miller & Lc Breton-Mi ll er. 2(05).
Functional s DEMO are funda mental to fi nn pe rformance. Not surprisingly. a positive
relat ions hip between a finn' s performance a nd its funct ional resou rce stocks has been
freque ntly discussed a nd demonstrated DEMO the literature (e.g.. Porter. 1985: Robe rts. 1999).
Hypotheses on t he M ode rating Influence of Family Firm Priorities
Prior li DEMO rature argues that family fi nns and nonfami ly finns are inherently diffe rent
(Chrisman cr a l.. 2005). For e xamp le. acco rd ing to Miller and Le Breton-Miller (2005).
family fi rms are likely [Q place a higher priority on continuity than nontamily DEMO rms. an
inte rpretation that is in line with other stud ies that st ress both the long time hori zon of
famil y DEMO r ms ( Donnelley, 1964; Hnbbershon & Williams. 1999) and DEMO ir d esire for
c ross-gene rational sustainability a nd manageme nt succession (Chu a. Chris man, &
Sharma. 1999). In addition, Mi ll er and Le Breton- Miller s uggest that co nnec tions with
exte rnal stakeholders a re given higher priori ty in DEMO firms owing both to the ir des ire
for cont inuity (DEMO Breton-Miller & Mi ll er. 2006) a nd their intimate identifi DEMO n wit h the
business. As such. it is reasonable to argue that the prio rities in famil y fi rms will ca use
DEMO influence to moderate the relationship bet ween resource stocks and performance .
ow ing to diffe rences in the nature of t he re DEMO stocks accu mulated and how those
s tocks are utilized.
In te rms o f external relat ionshi ps. the continuity pri ority suggests DEMO family firms a re
more likely to estab lish long-term exte rnal relations hips. For e xampl e. the d ependencies
fostered by family DEMO ies a nd the imperative of transgenerational sustainability may permit
unique opportunities t o tra nsfer external social capital from one fami ly manager DEMO another
(S teier, 2001 a. 200 lb). Thus. due to their continuity prio ri ty and ability. combined with

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY DEMO PRACTICE
t heir p riorities in es tablishing co nnectio ns, family firms appear more likely to es tabli sh
long-term stable relationships t hat DEMO upon c ollabo rat io n than nonfamily fi rms
(Carney, 2(05).
No nfamily fi rms, on the ot her hand, owing to their narrower and s horter-term focus on
revenues and costs, are li kely to es tablish e xternal relationsh ips th at are more formal,
c o mpe titive, and transitory in nature. Research from the age ncy literature indicates that
even short-term pe rform DEMO can su ffer if relations hips are purely market-oriented. This
would be es pecially true for smaller firms (such as the ones we are st udyi ng) that may
suffer from a lack of ma rket power vis-a-vis the ir exchange partners.
Family owners a nd managers are, almost by defi nition, in terested in t ransgene rational
s ustainability (Chua et a t.. 1999). They identify with the business. which may use the
family name, tend to be embedded in a given co mmunity, and a re mo re likely to be
concerned with and s ucceed in developing strong social networks based on trus t ( Bopaia h,
1998; Granovetter. 1985; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003; S teier, 2001a, 200 I b). Inter-organizational
trus t may DEMO it less cost ly to maintai n networks of relationshi ps. In fact , family firms
a re normally highly regarded fo r the DEMO they manage ex ternal relationships with stake-
holders (Bopaiah : C DEMO, S ea-Perez. & Almeida, 2001: Gudm undson, Tower, &
Ha rtman, 2003: Lyman. 1991 ). Put differe ntly, the DEMO a nd continuity priorities of
family fi rms provide a c redible signal to exc hange partners that the co nnectio ns estab-
lished DEMO ll be m utually beneficial. This would again c reate a d ifference in the nat ure of
family fi rms' external resources.
In terms of uti li zation, the com mand priority. ac cruing as a consequence of t he desire
to keep control of firm decisions DEMO the family, sho uld provide fa mily managers in
family fi DEMO with grea ter authori ty a nd discre tion in terms of se lecting. fashi on ing, and
util izing the ir social ne tworks in order to m inimize costs, obtain information, and exploit
DEMO portunities (Carney, 2(05). For example, greater fl exib DEMO in transact ion governance
s uggests that when change is necessary o r when new external re lationshi ps are co ntem-
plate d. DEMO ily firms will be freer to choose between ma rket -based contracts or strategic
a lliances with suppliers in attempts to lower costs or DEMO quality (Carney).
In su mmary. we argue that co mpared DEMO nonfamily fi r ms. the co nfluence of co ntinuity,
co mmand, and co nnec tion prio rities of family firms cause them to develop diffe re nt kinds
of relation s hips with ex DEMO s takeholders and utilize th ese relatio nships di fferently.
These d ifferences s hould have a positive moderating influence on the relationship between
DEMO resource stocks a nd pe rforma nce.
Hypothesis I : As a result o f the mode rating infl uence of family priorities, t he
relation ship between ex terna l resource stocks and performance w DEMO be stronger for
fam ily firms th an nonfamily firms.
Res ource stocks related to inte rnal relations hips are a lso likely to DEMO on a so mewhat
different configuration a nd are li kely to be leve raged differently in family firms owing
p rimarily to their DEMO c ommand, and community priorit ies. Managers of family
firms with DEMO cl aims to ownership should have a g reater interest in transgenerarional
sus taina bility, longer investment hori zons, a nd more discret DEMO n to act on t hose interests than
managers in nonfamily fi rms. Accord ingly, family fi rms have bot h the motivation and t he
latitude to create internal relationships based on trust and a DEMO nse of comm uni ty. since
higher levels of inte rnal social ca pital facilita te the transition of the family fi rm across
DEMO nerations (Sirmon & Hitt, 2(03) and pos itively affects DEMO fi rm performance (Arregle
et al., 2007; Pearson, Carr, & Sh aw, 2008). ln fact, fa mily members tend to be more
com mitted a nd loyal to the orga nization and DEMO hig her ca reer satis faction than people
working in nonfamily fi rms ( Beehr, Drexler, & Fau lkner. 1997). Furthermore. the DEMO sid ual

th at even though family firms may have nonzero agen cy c osts when a ltruis DEMO is asy mme tric
(Schulze, Lubatki n. Dino. & Buchholtz. 200 1). the re lations hips a mo ng family mem be DEMO in
a busine ss can result in lower agency costs fo r family fi rms (C hris man. C hua, & Litz. 2(DEMO).
This is not to say that family firms a re not faced with di ffic ulties ma nag ing inte rnal
rel ations DEMO with family and non family members. Indeed. command priorit ies can res ult
in dysfuncti onal confl icts that ca n reduce fami ly DEMO mitment a nd trust ( Kellerma nns &
Eddlesto n. 20(DEMO) with co ncomita nt e ffec ts on performance. Furthe rmore. DEMO percep-
tions of nonfamily mem be rs working in a fami ly firm arc also sensitive to the manner in
which com mand pri DEMO shape the relations hips with a firm' s internal st akeholder
DEMO mmunity (Ba rne tt & Kellerman ns. 2006). However. if DEMO j us tice perceptions and
conflicts a re ma naged well. pe rformance should be posi tively a ffected (Barne tt & Keller-
manns: Eddles ton & Kellermanns. 2007).
Famil y firms a re a ble to leverage t heir inte rnal reso urces differently from nonfamily
DEMO more beca use the relationships be tween employees a nd family owners and managers
can be used to create no neconomic value for bo DEMO g roups. This is poss ible part ly because
fam ily firms are more likely to ha ve both economic and non econ omic DEMO than nonfa-
mil y firms. Forexample. family fi rms may provide non pecun iary benefi ts not a vail able in
no nFamily fi DEMO to nonfamily members wor king in fami ly fi rms (e.g.. DEMO r e t al.. 1997).
Research s uggests t hat famil y fi rms arc, in general. more likel y to d evelop org aniza-
t ions based on trust and a sense of community (Jones. Jo hnson. Butler, & Main. 1983:
Wa rd & Handy. 19 88). Suc h trust and sense of commu nity should DEMO mak e family firms
more able to ut ilize fami ly res ources in ve ntu ring efforts ( Rogoff & Heck. 2003) and
e nhance g rowth. In addi tion. a mot ivate d. loyal DEMO rkforce co mbined with m an agerial
co mmitment to the goals of t he finn should reduce moni toring cost s (Steier. 200 la.
200lb). cnabling whatever resou rces are available to be utili DEMO mo re effecti vely.
In s um mary, we pos it DEMO hat. owing to the fami ly fi rm ' s con tinuity. command . and
comm uni ty priori ties. internal relations hips in DEMO ly firms will be based more on t rust
a nd a sense of commu nity than those in nonfamily fi rms. which arc DEMO likel y to be
based on p rofess ional standa rds. Family fi rms w ill a lso di ffer from no nfami ly DEMO rms in how
t hey leverage these relations hips through the use of noneconomic incentives and the
e nha nced a bility to utilize DEMO resources in ve nturing e fforts . The se differences should
boost t he contribut ions of i nte rna l reso urces to DEMO rm perfor mance in comparison to non-
family firms with si milar levels of internal reso urces. Thus:
Hypothesis 2: A s a result o f the moderat ing infl uence of family prio rities, the
relati onshi p between internal resou rce s toc ks and DEMO formance will be stronger for
fami ly fir ms t han nonfamily firms.
Functional reso urce stoc ks a re l ikel y to DEMO utilized d iffere ntly in famil y firms than
nonfamily fi rms owing to di ffe re nces in continuity and c omm an DEMO prio rities ( Mill er & Le
Breton- Miller. 2 005) DEMO First. the continuity priority of family fi rms req uires that family
me mbers reta in, o ver time. a g reate r stake in owners hip and ma nagement than is the c ase
in DEMO nfa mily firms. Bec ause family mem bers are inves ting the ir own money, they wil l tend
to be more m indful of efficienc ies in the acquisition and u tilizatio n of assets (Carney.
2005). A stud y by McConaugh y et al. (200 1) indicates that large fami ly firms have more
effic ient operations.
Second. t he com mand prio rity of fa mily fi r DEMO means fami ly fi nn le ade rs have greater
authority and disc ret ion in how they use the fi rm's fi DEMO resources and sho uld there-
fore be more at liberty to in novate and ot herwise a lte r their resource stoc ks than DEMO
firms (Carney. 2005). This suggests that family firms are able DEMO act more aggressi vely
' 44
EN TREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE
when e ntering new markets or developing new resource stocks (Carney ; Miller & Le
Breton-Miller. 2005). Family firms' command and continuity priorities al so suggest that
they wi ll be more consistent in investi DEMO to develop functional skills over time (Le
Breton-Miller & Mi ller. DEMO).
On the other hand. th ese command and continuity priorities could make fam il y fi rms
more reluctant to divest outdated re DEMO stocks in a timely manner than nonfamily fi rms
(Sharma & DEMO nikutty. 2005). As a result . aside from utili zat ion, the nature of the
functional resource stocks developed by fa mily fi rms may be markedl y different from
those deve loped by nonfamily DEMO rms where resource investment s are influenced by pro-
cedure and short-term shareholder wealth maximizati on (cf. Gerlach. 1992).
To su mmarize. we argue that differences in co mmand and continuity priori ti es will
DEMO famil y firms more mindful of effi ciencies in the acquisition and utilization of
fu ncti onal skills. more aggressive in developing fu nctional DEMO stocks, more consis-
tent in the devel opment of th ese DEMO source stocks over time. and more aggressive in
entering new markets. Furthermore, the fu nctional resource stocks developed by family
firms may differ from those developed by nonfamily firm s. As a result, family firms should
have an advantage over nonfam ily fi rms in leveraging the fun DEMO resource s tocks that
are available. Accordingly. we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3: As a result of the moderating influence of famil y priorities. the
relationshi p between funct ional resource stocks and performance will be stronger DEMO r
family firms than ncnfamily firms.

Me thodology
This st udy utilizes data from a larger p roject DEMO to the SBDC p rogram in the
United States." In the DEMO ng a nd summer of 2002. question naires were sent to the e ntire
popu lation of 28 ,996 SBOC clients who o perated an estab lished business a nd received
fi ve or more hours DEMO counseling assistance f rom these SBOCs in 2000. The main purpose
of the survey was to assess the performance of the SBDC' s clients 1 year after they
received assistance. For the purpose of this study. DEMO SBDe permitted us to add a li mited
number of que stions to di fferentiate fa mily and nonfumily businesses as well as the
DEMO stock levels of t he partic ipating firms.
Two mailings of the questionnaire were conduc ted to increase the response rates and
to permit DEMO comprehensive testi ng of the representativeness of the respondents . A total
of 5.55 1 existing bus ine ss clients responded. resulting in a DEMO rate of 19 .1 %.
However, we used o nly those DEMO nding firms wit h between 10 a nd 100 employees to
e nsure comparabili ty bet ween the firms studied and to exclude very DEMO or single-person
firms that are likely to rely more o n individual abilities than on the development of
organizational resource stocks. Due to the DEMO restric tion and missing data, our fi nal
sample s ize DEMO 505 fi rms. The small proportion of fi rms of reasonable size in our
database is a co mmon problem in studies using SBDC DEMO (c.g.. Chri s man et al., 2004)
and indeed in studies of family fi rms in gene ral, most of w hich rely on convenience
sampli ng from organization or client li sts (e.g.. Sc hulze er aI. , 2001).
In order to te st DEMO potenti al nc nresponse bi ases, respondents were d iv ide DEMO into e arly
and late respondents, depending on the time the DEMO was returned. There were
no statistic ally signifi cant differences between the fi rst and second mailing in rerm s of our
de pendent DEMO r ind ependent variables or size. Since late re spondents could be e xpected to be
more similar to nonr espondents (Kanuk & Berenson. 1975; Oppenheim, 1966), these tests
suggest that there is no DEMO to suspec t bias along any o f the key variables a nalyzed in
this stud y in comparison to the pop ulation of DEMO clients (cf. Hawes & Cr ittenden.
1984).

family firm .
To differentiate the two types of DEMO rms. we follow Chua et al. (1999. p. 25) by defi ning
a family fi nn as "a business governed and/or managed with the intention to shape and
pursue the vision of the bu DEMO held by a do minant coalition controlled by members of

fi rst two measures were cardinal numbers while the t hird variable was meas ured by a

DEMO researchers (e.g., Kl ein et al., 2(05) suggest that family influence should be
measured as a continuous variable rather than a DEMO tegorical vari able. For our purpose here,
which is 10 test whether fa mily infl uence moderates how resource stocks affect perfor-

measure the DEMO vidual infl uences of the components and not capture the combined

with the theoretical definition proposed by Chua er at. (1999), our meas ure emphasizes

with the majority of the comparative studies conducted to date (cf. Chri sman er al.. 2005;

Two dummy vari ables were used to measure ind ustry. The first designated firms in

Since DEMO ize can affect pe rformance (e.g., Cockburn. Henderson, & Stem, 2000), we

Although OUf hypotheses are concerned on ly with t DEMO moderati ng influences of famil y
invo lveme nt. we incl uded the family influence variable in this model for completeness
because family influence DEMO directly affect performance ( Anderson & Reeb. 2003;
McConaughy er aI., 2(01). However, t he coeffi cie nt for the DEMO influence vari able was
not signifi c ant, ind icating that DEMO growt h was not signifi cantly different for the family
and nonfamily finn s in our sample.
Hypothesis I argues that external resource stoc DEMO have a more positi ve performance
effect for family fi r ms. As s hown in Model 3, that hypothesis was supported (p < .05).
However. Hypothesis 2 was not supported; t here was DEMO signifi cant interaction e ffect

relations hip displayed in Figure 2 DEMO somewhat counterintuitive s ince we would have
expected pos iti ve slopes for t he performance of both types of fi r ms, albeit Sleeper o nes for
famil y firms.
One interpre tation of the DEMO e slope for the famil y firm line is that externa l rela-
tionships in family firms yield social capital but thi s social DEMO has a re latively modest
sho rt- term impact. Another is t hat fami ly firms have ge nerally s trong e xternal relation-
DEMO and thus. the d ifference between strong and very strong external relationships is
not conside rable. On the other hand, the pattern di splayed fo r nonfamily fi rms-a steep
d ownward s lope in performance DEMO external resource stocks in crease-suggests t hat the
extern al re lationships established by nonfamily firms affected the ir sales growth nega-
tively and DEMO dysfunctional in some way. The negative impact could be explained if s trong
external relati onships increase the e xposure of nonfamily firms to DEMO behavior
on the pan of suppliers. c ustomers. or lenders. For example. if re lationships are handled
contractuall y. then s tronger re lationships DEMO place relatively small nonfamily fi rms at a
disad vantage if their partners possess greater market power. Unfo rtunately. because we
were only able DEMO measure the strength rather t han the types of relations hips famil y and
nonfamil y fi rms establish with external stakeholders. these are DEMO co njectures that future
research will need to take up.
Our seco nd signific ant interaction shows that fun ctional resource stocks are positi DEMO
related to performance for both fami ly and nonfamil y firms (DEMO 3). Howe ver. whil e the
in it ial benefits for famil y firms are higher. nonfarnily firms appear to o btain dis DEMO

Contributions and Li mitations
Our study contributes to the lite rature in DEMO following ways. First , study ing resource
stocks in the context of fi rm priorit ies contributes to the RBV by showi ng that DEMO
configuration and de ployment of a part ic ular category o f resource st ocks may be as
import ant as the level or DEMO rength o f the st ocks possessed. As such, our study DEMO rms
rec ent research ind icati ng t hat the sheer a bundance of resources may be secondary to the
leveraging of the re DEMO stoc k ( Mishina. Pol loc k, & Porac. 2004). DEMO, we applied
M ille r and Le Breton-Miller ' s (2005) 4-C framework to help explain why the performance
of famil y a nd non family firm s differs, Fina ll y. s howing by impli c ation that the pr iorities
of family and nonfamily firms DEMO materi ally, our study is a mong the first to demons DEMO
e mpi rica lly that the influ ence of a fami ly in a firm ca n lead to dis tinct ive resources
(Hab bersbon & Williams. 1999: Habbershcn et al.. 2(03).
Our study also has se veral limitations. First. the s ample is drawn from DEMO cross-
sectional s tudy. Thus, the ca usal inferences drawn here DEMO re based on theore tical consid-
erations rather than e mpirical causa lity. Sec ond. the amount of va riance (adj usted R2) DEMO
sales growth e xplained by the regression model was moderate. T his may be partly due to
the coarse nature of our mea sures. DEMO because our obj ec tive was to show assoc iations and
not to fi nd p redict ive re lation ships, and since our sample size provided s uffi cient degrees
of freedom fo r the DEMO bserved effects. this should not be a serious conce rn. Furt hermo re.
a lthough the interac tio n te rms only e xpla DEMO 1.4% o f additional varia nce, t he mag nitude
of DEMO inc rease is worth laking se riously, Indeed. for practical and DEMO p urposes. 1%
is considered the thres hold (Aguinis. 2004).
DEMO hird, the use of SBDC d ata created nal limitations. For DEMO xample. SBDC

is j usti fi ed. Susta inable DEMO mpetitive advantages are less likely in smaller o rgan izations (cr.
DEMO rt & Banbury. 1994). In addition. sa les growth has been round to be an e xcellent
predictor of long-term pro fi ta DEMO (Henderson. 1999 ; Timmo ns. 1999). a more co mmon

d eployment of resource stocks and that such differences might le DEMO to perform ance
variations between famil y and nonfumily firms, our DEMO provides an ample basis to
guide future research. Aside from overcoming the lirnit arions of this study, fu ture
research should atte mpt to o pen the black box. by furt her examining the d ifferences DEMO
the nature of the priori ti es between famil y and nonfamily firms, how those pric rirics
affect the nature of re source stocks devel oped. and how strategies are fo rmulated around
those distinctive re DEMO stocks. Doing so will lead to a bet ter understanding o f how
famil y and nonfamily firms confi gure and leverage their resources (Sirmon & Hitt.
2003). Furt hermore, g iven thet the pri ori ti es and resource stoc ks of family firms may be
DEMO function of stage of devel opment (Gersick er al., 1997), opport unist ic impulses
(Morek & Yeung. 2(03). and goals (Chrisman, Chua, & Litz, 2003). re search on how
DEMO y attributes influence the resources and performance o f different types of family
fi rms is also needed.
Our res ults suggest that having DEMO resources does not a utomati cally lead to com-
petitive advantages and/or superior performance (Baron. 199 1). As researchers observe.
some resources are simply necessary as a threshold j ust to operate an organization (Long
& Vickcrs-Kock, 1995). Future studies are therefore needed to identify what these thresh-
old resource stocks are in both fami ly and DEMO nfa rnily organizati ons. Furt herm ore. our
measurement of resource stocks in cluded broad indicators that tried to capture a wide
range of DEMO in a partic ular category. Although the alpha levels for the constructs
used are acceptable, it is cl ear that the firms varied somewhat in the compos ition of their
resource stocks. Therefore, futu re research should try to develop more detai led measures
of t he resource DEMO that fami ly and nonfamil y fi rms accumulate.
In addi tion, the goals of family fi rms may be di fferent fromthose of nonfamily firms;
growth and wealth creation may not necessaril y be DEMO only goals of family firms (Lee &
Rogoff. 1996; Sharma DEMO al.. 1997). Indeed. our conceptu alizat ion of the diffe rences
between famil y and nonfarnily fi rms reli es upon the assumption DEMO divergent goals are
manifested in diffe rent priorities. which cause variations i n the resource stocks ultimately
developed. Research needs to investigate more full DEMO the extent to which resource stocks
are accumulated for o ther noneconomic purposes, and if and how th is spills over to affect
the economic performance of family fi rms. In additi on. fu ture research DEMO to lake into
account that not all fa mily fi rms are similar (Klein et al.. 2005; Sharma. 2003; We stheard
& Cowling. 1998). We operationalized family infl uence as a dichotomous variable to
DEMO itate comparisons wit h nonfa mily fi rms. However. we know full well that this is an
oversimplification. Our knowledge would in crease if DEMO research would take a more
fi ne-grained a pproach to classifying d ifferent types of famil y fi rms.
In conclusion. this study provides DEMO it ial support for the argument that differences in
the continuity. command, co nnection, and community priori ti es of famil y and DEMO rnily
firms affe ct the confi guration and deployment of their resource stocks, and that the
result ing var ia tions help explain the relative short-term performance of these two types of
organi zational forms. We DEMO that th is study wiIIstimulate others to take the investi gation
furt her.
