Sequential Decision Making with Continuous
Disease States and Measurements:
I. Theory
DEMO B. SCHECHTER, MD
The question of whether to perform a continuous DEMO test to assess a continuous valued
health state such as blood pressure or serum cholesterol is explored by decision analysis.
Principal assumptions are that DEMO underlying health state and measurement variability are
both normally distributed, and DEMO the impact of treatment on the utility of outcomes varies
linearly with the underlying health state. Using Bayes’ theorem, an expression for the ex-
pected utility of performing the test is derived and compared with immediate DEMO or
decision to withhold treatment. The calculations can be carried out with a pocket calculator
and a table of the normal distribution. Iterating the DEMO, a sequential decision making
process is developed, leading to a series of no treat/test again and test again/treat thresholds
with which DEMO running average of independently obtained measurements can be compared
to produce stepwise optimal results. The thresholds are readily calculated on a microcom-
puter. Finally, the conjugate-normal-linear model is extended to encompass the correlated
observations that may DEMO made on a single visit. This paper concentrates on the mathematics
of decision making with continuous variables. The companion paper illustrates its application
to DEMO blood pressure. Key words: decision analysis; Bayes’ theorem; conjugate-normal-
linear DEMO; hypertension. (Med Decis Making 1990;10:242-255)
The theory of Bayesian decision making, as devel-
oped, for example, by Savage,’ is designed to help make
such decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Ap-
DEMO this framework to deciding when to order a
diagnostic test, Pauker DEMO Kassirer~ set out the thresh-
old decision-making approach.
Unfortunately, Pauker and DEMO method is not
applicable to hypertension, a common disease of adults,DEMO
for three reasons. First, there is no discrete disease
hypertension: lower blood pressures are associated
with better health and longer life throughout the DEMO
observed in ambulatory patients. Observed blood pres-
sures are continuously, unimodally DEMO over a
broad range. The distinction between &dquo;hypertensives&dquo;
DEMO &dquo;normotensives&dquo; is simply a dichotomization of
a continuum, DEMO the sense that below some
point the costs and risks associated with blood pres-
sure reduction outweigh the benefits.
Second, the &dquo;test&DEMO; for hypertension consists of blood
pressure determination, which does not yield a pos-
itive or negative result but estimates the blood pres-
sure.

somewhat exceptional, whereas repeating blood pres-
sure measurements before DEMO a diagnosis is con-
sidered normal practice and is recommended, to DEMO
limited extent, by national authorities.’ The consid-
erations of these last DEMO paragraphs also apply to
the management of blood cholesterol levels, another
DEMO problem in medicine.
There is therefore a need to apply decision analysis
to situations with continuous health states and con-
tinuous, repeatable measurements. This paper pre-
sents such an application. I describe a specially tailored
conjugate-normal DEMO of such measurements and
health states, along with a model of DEMO relevant util-
ities. From these, an expression for the utility of DEMO
surement before deciding about treatment is derived
and a decision rule formulated. A stopping rule for
sequential measurements is proposed and its impli-
cations DEMO Finally, the model is extended to
encompass correlated measurements obtained over
DEMO time intervals.
Bayesian sequential decision theory is set out in
standard texts, e.g., the brief, lucid exposition of Lind-
gren,~ or the more extensive and demanding exposi-
tions of LaValle’ and DeGroot.~ The purpose DEMO this
paper is to present the material in a style and notation
more familiar to clinical decision analysts, emphasiz-
ing blood pressure as its focus. A companion paper’
appears in this issue; in it, the DEMO rationale for
the assumptions of this conjugate-normal model are
explored and the model is applied to diagnosing di-
243
astolic hypertension. Although formulated and ex-
plained with reference to diastolic DEMO pressure, the
theory is more general, and ongoing work suggests
that it applies with slight modification to cholesterol
as well.

Conjugate-normal Measurement DEMO
It is a commonplace observation that if the same
patient’s blood pressure is measured repeatedly, dif-
fering results will be obtained. The challenge to the
clinician is to make sense of these fluctuating data, to
know when to get more of them, and when to reach
a final decision about intervention.
The following model has been fitted and usefully
applied DEMO diastolic blood pressure in earlier work.8,9
Assume that any patient’s diastolic blood pressure if
measured at every instant would follow a normal
(Gaussian) distribution. The mean
of
that distribution,
denoted x, is a DEMO of that patient which I
refer to as the &dquo;true&DEMO; or &dquo;latent&dquo; blood pressure of the
patient. Any DEMO measurement we obtain, de-
noted y, is a sample of size 1 from that distribution.
If measurements are taken sufficiently far apart in DEMO
that the more persistent factors affecting blood pres-
sure have had a chance to fluctuate, we regard a series
of blood pressure measurements, DEMO, Y2) ..., yn as in-
dependently sampled from this distribution. DEMO
the variance of this distribution by T 2 the probability
distribution function, Fylx, of a test result y conditional
on x is given DEMO:
The right side of equation 1 refers to a normal distri-
bution with mean x and variance T~. Throughout this
paper and its DEMO, the assumption about suf-
ficient time separation between measurements to per-
DEMO us to treat them as conditionally independent is
implicit in the term &dquo;measurement.&dquo; If a device is used
repeatedly in a DEMO span of time during which sep-
arate results could not, for DEMO purposes, be re-
garded as conditionally independent, I refer to those
results as &dquo;observations.&dquo; Observations will be dealt
with near DEMO end of this paper.
For any person, x is unknowable. It DEMO be esti-
mated from measurements, but its precise value can
never DEMO determined. From the Bayesian perspective,
x is a random variable. Empirically, if the entire pop-
ulation of a community were available and an oracle
provided the value of x for each of them, the x’s them-
selves would have a frequency distribution. It is as-
sumed that DEMO x’s are also normally distributed; we
let R denote the mean DEMO QZ the variance of this prior
distribution for x. In symbols, DEMO prior probability
distribution function of X, F 0’ is:
For DEMO Bayesian statistician, the prior distribution
is a subjective opinion, perhaps to be modified by
subsequent measurements. The frequentist may wish
to estimate R, a~2, and TZ from data. Methods for doing
this have been explained elsewhere. 8,10
We can apply Bayes’ theorem to the prior and DEMO
ditional distributions to obtain the posterior distri-
bution of x after a single measurement y has been
obtained. Because both the prior and the DEMO
distributions are normal, the result is quite simple:
BAYES’ THEOREM DEMO NORMAL PRIOR AND
CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Under the assumptions in equations 1 and 2, after
obtaining a measurement result y, and letting r = (y2/
(QZ + r2), the posterior distribution function, F1, for x
is:
More generally, if independent measurements yi, ...,DEMO
y~ have been obtained, let y. denote their mean
(Yi +... +yn)/n, and let Rn = n-r/[l + (n -1)r]. Then the
posterior distribution, F n’, of x after n DEMO
is:
Proof of this theorem can be found in LaValle’ or
DeGmot.~ Some consequences of this are explored in
Schechter and Adler.8
The DEMO qualitative points to emphasize are: 1) the
posterior distribution is again normal, which will prove
useful for sequential decision making; 2) the variance
of the distribution of x decreases by a factor of 1- DEMO
Notice that we always have 0 ~ r < 1, with DEMO
only under the unrealistic condition that Q2 or TZ be
zero. The number r can be shown to equal the test-
retest reliability of DEMO single measurement.&dquo; Values of
r close to 1 reflect nearly DEMO measurement; values
near 0 correspond to noisy measurements that are
pale DEMO of x.
For a given conditional distribution, a family of prior
DEMO that combine with it under Bayes’ theo-
rem to produce a posterior distribution belonging to
the family is known as a conjugate family for DEMO con-
ditional distribution.12 Here the conditional distribu-
tion is normal, and DEMO conjugate family is the class
of normal distributions. When an unknown parameter
and conditionally independent measurements bear
these relationships, as x and y do, it is convenient to
refer to y as a conjugate-normal measurement of x. A
review of the symbols introduced so far (and others
to come later) appears in table 1.

Assumptions about Utilises
EU(untreated natural history) = U(x)
TREATMENT UTILITY
and
Risk of cardiovascular disease increases with blood
pressure. Interventions DEMO lower blood pressure re-
duce the risk; but they carry adverse DEMO of their
own and impose burdens of inconvenience, time lost
for DEMO follow up, and monetary expense on the
subjects. Explicitly modeling all DEMO these effects is an
enormous task, beyond the scope of this DEMO,
and has been explored by Weinstein and Stason. 13 In
part for reasons of mathematical simplicity, and in part
motivated by their results, I instead take the following
holistic approach to the relevant utilities: DEMO the utility,
the numerical expression of patient preference, for the
DEMO history of life with latent blood pressure x is
U(x), I assume that the utility of life with pretreatment
latent blood pressure DEMO and treatment to reduce blood
pressure is U(x) + some DEMO function of x.
One algebraic representation of linear functions is
especially convenient. If x is sufficiently high, treat-
ment will be preferred to natural history; if x is suffi-
ciently low, natural history will be DEMO to
treatment. There is some cutoff value of latent blood
pressure, DEMO, for which the patient is indifferent be-
tween treatment and natural DEMO Above q, the pa-
tient prefers treatment; below q, untreated DEMO is
preferred. This value of q determines the patient’s
functional definition of &dquo;hypertension.&dquo;
The Joint National Committee on Detection, Eval-
DEMO and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC) has, in
essence, recommended that blood pressure be low-
ered when it exceeds 90 mmHg diastolic,3 DEMO effect
prescribing the value q = 90 for all persons. From the
Bayesian perspective adopted here, however, the value
of q should be DEMO from individual patient
preferences and depends upon both external matters
(such DEMO other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases)
and attitudinal factors. Of course, the practical diffi-
culties in eliciting q from the patient should not be
underestimated; the process is approached in the
companion paper.
To complete the specification of the expected gain
in utility from treatment as a DEMO function, a slope
must be identified. This slope, denoted L, DEMO the amount
by which the patient’s preference for treatment over
natural history increases for each unit increase in la-
tent blood pressure. Its units DEMO utiles/mmHg. I am
not aware of procedures for determining overall utility
slopes from patient preferences, though Miyamoto and
Eraker’s work&dquo; parametrically DEMO utility with
quality-adjusted life years is related. In any case, once
DEMO is determined, we can write the expected gain in
utility from DEMO as L~ (x - q). Accordingly, for a
patient with latent blood pressure x:
The assumption of a linear relationship between DEMO
blood pressure and effect of treatment is the most
stringent one in this model. The evidence favoring it
is reviewed in the companion paper.’ DEMO this
assumption would expand the applicability of the
model; for this DEMO I call attention to each use of
linearity in the analysis and indicate the extent to
which it might be dispensable while still preserving
DEMO core of the approach.
Nothing has been said about U(x) DEMO Apart from
using n to denote E(U(x)), nothing DEMO; it will be seen
to be irrelevant to decision making.
COST DEMO MEASUREMENT
Intuitively, one would expect that measuring blood
pressure, by providing more information about the
patient, would lead to a better decision about treat-
ment. Nevertheless, such information comes at a price.
Time, personnel, equipment, records, and space are
allocated to it (for which the patient incurs a charge),
and the patient must give up work or leisure time for
the encounter, and expend time and resources on
travel. The patient will attach some utility cost to these
events. As DEMO the impact of treatment, I do not pro-
pose to analyze DEMO these various burdens combine
to create the utility cost. I simply assume that it is
possible to elicit from the patient the utility cost, C,
of having a blood pressure measurement, with all that
entails.
In this article, a patient’s determination of C is treated
as constant from one occasion to the next. This sim-
plifies the notation, but nothing in the analysis de-
pends on it. By contrast, I explicitly and crucially assume
that C does not depend on x. Based on DEMO explanation
of the constituents of C in the previous paragraph, I
DEMO this assumption is very reasonable.
There is, however, a second encumbrance associ-
ated with measurement not considered above. Al-
though the first measurement DEMO be obtained at once,
equation 1 will be satisfied by subsequent measure-
ments only if enough time passes between them that
long-term determinants DEMO blood pressure can vary.
Subsequent measurements, if any, entail delaying the
treatment decision. The effects of delaying will depend
on
the ultimate treatment DEMO and
the true blood
pressure. For those who are ultimately not treated, the
delay has no effect at all: they continue to receive DEMO
treatment throughout. In an ultimately treated severe
hypertensive, the delay will DEMO, and thereby reduce,
the
benefits of
treatment. In a

blood pressure who might &dquo;mistakenly&dquo; be assigned
to DEMO, the delay attenuates the harm that would
be done, and constitutes a net benefit. In any case, it
seems appropriate to model the effect of a delay as a
reduction in the impact (favorable or unfavorable, as
the case may be) that a decision to treat DEMO have
for the patient. One way to model the delay is by
reducing the parameter L. Let a denote the decrease
in L attributable DEMO delaying the treatment decision for
those who will ultimately be treated. Then,

As with C, the presentation here treats a patient’s a
as constant from one occasion to the next, a notational
convenience not relied upon in the analysis. Also, the
analysis to be presented could proceed just as well
with other formulations of the DEMO effect, e.g., mul-
tiplying L by some constant less than 1. I am aware
of no research results supporting any particular model
of DEMO effect. The essential point is that L is effectively
reduced by delaying.
It is convenient to refer to the totality of assumptions
about distributions DEMO utilities made as the conju-
gate-normal linear (CNL) model.
Decision Analysis under IN Assumptions of the CHL Model
What would we do if DEMO couldn’t measure blood
pressure? The question seems trivial at first, but posing
and answering it will prove useful later. If measure-
ment were DEMO an option, two strategies, TREAT and NO
TREAT
would
be available. This restricted choice is dia-
grammed in the top two branches of DEMO 1. For a
patient with true blood pressure x, EU(NO DEMO(x) =
U(x) and EU(TREATlx) = U(x) + L(x - q). Not knowing x,
we take DEMO over the probability distribution
of x in equation 2. The linear form of L(x - q) makes
this simple. EU(NO TREAT) DEMO n; EU(TREAT) = n +
L~ ( ~, q)DEMO It follows that TREAT
TREAT is preferred if
if R = q.

R <
q, and

If this result seems too obvious to DEMO discus-
sion, consider how things would be if the expected
impact DEMO treatment were, say, L- (x - q) for x > q -1,
but - L for x S q -1. There, the total positive potential
impact of treatment when x > q so DEMO the
minimal negative impact for x < q that even values of
R appreciably less than q would warrant treatment.
Depending on the form DEMO the function, the optimal
decision might also depend on U2 . DEMO linearity as-
sumption considerably simplifies the analysis here and
cannot be totally waived. Nevertheless, any monotone
odd function of x - q would do so far. (f is an odd
function of an expression u if f(- u) = - f(u), e.g. f(u) DEMO
FIGURE 1. Decision tree. The filled-in circular nodes are chance nodes

noted beneath.
u DEMO f(u) = u3.) For more complicated functions, the
suitability DEMO this approach depends on the ease of
calculating what value of R demarcates the decision
between TREAT and NO TREAT when measurement is
not DEMO considered.
Let us now assess the option of taking a single mea-
surement. We will incur a cost C, but we will gain
information. The value of that information can be as-
certained by comparing the DEMO utility of a de-
cision made after the measurement with one made
without it. This is precisely the principle used to de-
duce the DEMO for prior disease probability in
the discrete setting.’ If we choose the measurement
option, the result y will be related to x as in equation
1. Subsequently, our probability distribution for x is
modified in accordance with Bayes’ theorem, as set
out in equation 3: Fl(x) = N(fJ.’ = ry+(l&horbar;r))JL; (l&horbar;r)o~).
Based on the earlier discussion, if R’ turns out to ex-
ceed q, the patient will prefer TREAT; if ~,DEMO = q he or
she will be indifferent; and if R’ < q the patient will
prefer NO TREAT. Thus, if we were DEMO make our treat-
ment decision after one measurement the expected
utility would be:
We must evaluate the expected value of the expres-
sion DEMO if R’ ~ q; L- (x - q) if [L’ > q}, hereafter referred
to as v. First, exploiting linearity, for DEMO given value of
R’, E(LOx-q)) = Lo(,....’ -q). Therefore, E(vlRl) = {0 if
w’ ~ q; L’()JL’ &horbar;q) if li’ > q}. (Again, the derivation will
tolerate relaxation of linearity if the expectation of the

our central DEMO:

unconditional expectation of DEMO, we need the distri-
bution of ~,’ . Now, R’ is a random variable calculated
from the random variable y in accordance DEMO Bayes’
theorem. From equations 1 and 2, we infer that the
DEMO distribution ofy, Fy(y) = N(vL; (T2 + T2). It fol-

Introducing the notation zq to denote (q- pL)/
(Q’~), equation 9 then becomes:
Letting (D denote DEMO distribution function of the stan-
dard normal distribution, we rewrite equation DEMO as:
Accordingly, the decision among TREAT, NO TREAT,
and MEASURE, diagrammed in figure 1, can be made in
accordance with DEMO 5 and 11. Let V(J.L, 0’2, r, q,
DEMO, C) denote Lo-Vr[exp(-Zq/2)/V2TT - z~.4J( - z~)] -
C. The preferred course of action is TREAT, NO TREAT,
or MEASURE according to which of S2, n + L - (ii - q) or
S2 + V(11, Q2, r, q, L, C) is largest. As promised, the
common term DEMO appears in all three expected utilities
and therfore U(x) contributes DEMO to the decision.
Notice that the necessary calculations can be done
with a hand calculator and a table of the standard
normal distribution.
It DEMO be proven that the expression for EU(MEAUSRE)
has certain properties that would be expected from
its application here. Viewed as a function DEMO r or U2
alone, it is monotone increasing. Viewed as a DEMO
of [L, it is symmetric around q. If C were 0, EU(MEASURE)
would asymptotically approach the utilities of NO TREAT
and DEMO for very low or very high values of Vt, re-
spectively. DEMO last property can be grasped visually
from figure 2.

The findings of the DEMO paragraph suggest compar-
ison with threshold decision making for the discrete
case. The thresholds RIO and [Lhi are analogous to the
Pauker and Kassirer2 DEMO in demarcating ranges
corresponding to three options. But lilo and Rhi are
values of the mean of the prior distribution of x; they
are not prior probabilities of disease. Threshold dis-
ease probabilities are closely related: the test thres-
hold, Tt = 4J( (pLi~ - q)/DEMO) and the test-treat threshold,

making thresholds /J-Io and jjLhi DEMO the cutoff value q.
The cutoff value q is the point of indifference between
treatment and non-treatment in terms of the latent
blood pressure. DEMO value is determined from patient
preferences prior to making any decisions. The thres-
hold /J-’s are derived values with which the current
estimate (DEMO is compared in order to reach a choice
among
three actions.
Sequential Decision Making
A sequential decision-making procedure may be di-
vided into two DEMO: a rule for deciding whether
to obtain another measurement or not (stopping rule),
and a rule for choosing between TREAT and NO TREAT
once a decision to stop measuring has been reached
(decision rule). It can be shown that an optimal se-
quential decision-making procedure DEMO use a de-
cision rule that would be optimal if used under
conditions prohibiting measurements.6 In this context
the optimal choice is TREAT if )JL > q, No TREAT other-
wise. It remains to propose a stopping rule.
We have considered whether to obtain a single mea-
surement. DEMO, because the posterior distri-
bution of x is still assumed normal, all of the
relationships among the variables described remain
essentially the same. DEMO are new, updated values
for ii, Q2, and hence for DEMO The delay effects referred
to earlier also necessitate reducing L by a at each turn.
The form of the problem is otherwise unchanged. We
DEMO iterate the same analysis using the new parameter
values. That is, DEMO can use the following stopping rule:
continue to obtain measurements until EU(MEASURE),
as calculated by equation 11 with current parameter
values, is less than both EU(TREAT) and EU(NO TREAT).
DEMO immediate question to pose about any proposed
stopping rule is: are DEMO guaranteed to eventually stop?
We can answer affirmatively. It can be proven that
given the initial values of 0’2 and r, and a sequence of’
values Cn (the cost of the n’th measurement, hereto-
DEMO a constant C), and Ln (the slope of the utility DEMO
from treatment-latent blood pressure line after n -

DEMO for by this stopping rule can be calculated under
very loose assumptions about the limiting behavior of
the ratio Cn/Ln as n grows DEMO A precise statement
and proof, as well as the omitted proofs DEMO other as-
sertions, are found in appendix A.
It would be DEMO if the stopping rule were
spelled out as a schedule of criteria with which the
results could be compared at each decision point. This
DEMO, in fact, be done. Using Bayes’ theorem (equation
3) and applying mathematical induction (appendix A),
after the n’th measurement, the value of the variance

DEMO the value of measurement reliability will be:

measurement, with equation 3’s Rn, the reliability of
the mean of all n measurements! R~ increases towards
1, whereas r~ decreases towards 0 as n ~ 00.) The un-
subscripted a2 and r in equations 12 and 13 refer to
their original values prior to any measurements. The
updated value DEMO li, denoted ~ju~ depends on the mea-
surements, of course, DEMO cannot be determined in
advance. So, after the n’th measurement has DEMO ob-

One might hope that the foregoing has laid out the
optimal strategy for diagnosing diastolic hypertension.
Unfortunately, this is not quite the case. The expected
utility of the MEASURE strategy DEMO calculated by ex-
amining the expected utility of a TREAT vs. NO TREAT
decision made immediately after one measurement.
By sequentially applying the results DEMO have covertly
introduced a fourth option: measure and then re-mea-
sure. DEMO stopping rule requires us to stop as soon as
an immediate decision has greater utility than one
based on the very next measurement. This DEMO un-
dervalues measurement by crediting only its impact
on an immediate decision; it overlooks the possibility
that a decision based on two or three more measure-
ments might be preferable to an immediate decision
even though DEMO decision based on one measurement
is worse. Clearly this could happen if the cost of suc-
cessive measurements decreases.
Perhaps surprisingly, it can also happen when the
cost of successive measurements remains constant. A
complete analysis DEMO this phenomenon is complicated
and cannot be presented here. On a heuristic level,
the value of
n >
1 measurements is derived analo-
gously to that of
1 with Rn = n - r/[l DEMO
(n &horbar; l)r] playing
the role of r. EU(DEMO n TIMES) = H + V(11, 0’2, n-r/
DEMO + (n -1)r], q, L-nocx, n~C) = LQ(DEMO/[1 + (n -1)r])1’z .
[exp(-zq/2)/(DEMO)1’z-zq~(-zq)] - not, where zq =
(q - ~,)/(Q(wr/[1 + (n -1)r])1I2). The DEMO term grows lin-
early with n. The remainder of the expression varies
with n in a highly nonlinear manner. A plot (not shown)
would reveal that for suitable r and small n, the expres-
sion increases faster than linearly in n, but for large n
it tapers off, being bounded above by the expected
utility of perfect information. Therefore, it is possible
for several measurements to be advantageous when
single one alone is not.
This observation is somewhat disappointing. But I
take comfort DEMO four facts. 1) Attempts to find a globally
optimal strategy that DEMO this limitation re-
peatedly lead to recurrence equations I cannot solve.
DeGroot’ provides an extensive discussion of deciding
whether the mean of a normal DEMO exceeds a
critical value under linear loss. That abstract decision
problem is a minor simplification of what has been
undertaken here. DeGroot proves that DEMO globally op-
timal stopping rule for this problem exists. In fact,
given our guarantee of stopping, it can, in principle,
be DEMO by a method known as backwards in-
duction. In practice, however, DeGroot notes that &dquo;it
does not seem possible to develop an explicit expres-
sion for the [globally] optimal sequential decision pro-
cedure.&dquo;DEMO (p. 286) 2) Extensive numerical
experimentation with the current model DEMO per-
suaded me that the suboptimality of the stepwise ap-
proach occurs only for values of ltn within about 1
mmHg of ~hi,n DEMO J.Llo.n and, relative to the differences
in utility among the three DEMO, the incremental
utility achievable by multiple measurements when the
current model DEMO stopping is very small,
typically around 1%. 3) As illustrated DEMO the companion
paper, in practice this model implies that many pa-
DEMO ought to receive a longer series of blood pressure
measurements prior to diagnosis than is currently rec-
ommended.’ Since this stepwise optimal rule errs DEMO
in failing to recommend measurement when it might
be beneficial, my DEMO about current practices
are, if anything, too conservative. Finally, 4) the dis-
crete threshold decision-making model when applied
sequentially exhibits the same DEMO (see appendix
B).

I have repeatedly emphasized that successive DEMO
surements must be sufficiently distant in time to con-
sider them independent, conditional on x. It is natural,
however, to consider obtaining DEMO than one obser-
vation each time a patient is seen; and DEMO
recommendations3 advocate this. While it is unclear
how common a practice this is,8 a decision analysis

of this option would be useful. It would be in the DEMO
of this model not merely to consider a comparison of
a fixed 1 vs. 2 vs. 3, etc., observations per measurement
strategy but DEMO to determine the optimal number of
observations for any given measurement, DEMO might
(and does’) vary from patient to patient or visit to visit.
When observations cluster in time, so that long-act-
ing sources of blood pressure measurement variability
(dietary influences, fluid and cation balances, plugs of
cerumen in the clinician’s ears, etc.) do not fluctuate,
DEMO 1 does not apply. If x is the latent blood
pressure, DEMO if d denotes the net effect of the long-
acting sources of variability, then a series of observa-
tions obtained while d remains essentially constant
exhibits a bias: the mean of the distribution of such
observations is x + d, not x. On a different occasion
(corresponding DEMO a separate measurement), a differ-
ent value of d would prevail. The value of d, a random
variable, is never known. Over DEMO long term, by defi-
nition of x, E(d) = DEMO The key to handling multiple
observations is to recognize that while clustered, cor-
related yis fail to be measurements (as I use the DEMO)
of x, they are measurements of w = x + DEMO Thus, w can
be viewed as the true blood pressure prevailing DEMO
the time span of a single visit. Let us grapple with the
details.
A given observation yi can be analyzed into three
components:
DEMO being the true pressure, d being the net effect of
influential DEMO that change between but not within
a visit, and ei being DEMO net effect of influential variables
that do vary freely within the time span of a single
occasion. This separation into long- and short-term
influences DEMO admittedly somewhat artificial. Clinical
practice effectively defines long-term as more than a
week or two.3 The validity of this is an open empirical
question.
DEMO began by assuming that yi is normally distrib-
uted. Allow me to assume that x, d, and ei are sto-
chastically independent. Assuming DEMO and ei
independent I find reasonable, though not axiomatic;
assuming DEMO and x independent I find compelling; but
to my knowledge neither DEMO has been studied
empirically. Now, a theorem of H. Kramerl5 implies
DEMO, unless one of them is constant, both w and ei
are themselves both normally distributed. Because w
is normally distributed, d = w - x is normally dis-
tributed too. Letting 8’ denote the variance DEMO d, and
EZ the variance of e;, we have the DEMO probability
distributions:
Equations 18 and 19 establish that y is indeed a
conjugate normal measurement of w; equation 20 gives
a prior distribution for w in terms of parameters spe-
cifiable at the outset. The DEMO played by r in the anal-
ysis of independent measurements is now fulfilled by
(Q2 + 82)/(O&dquo;z + 82 + EZ), denoted s. This suggests that the
apparatus already in place DEMO determine the expected
utility of a measurement can be used to determine the
expected utility of additional observations if we ex-
press the utilities DEMO the TREAT and ~ro TREAT options
in terms of w
instead of
x.
Expressing the utilities in terms of w is simple. EU(NO
DEMO) = 0, of course. EU(TREAT) = E(L(x DEMO q)) + Il =
L(E(x) - q) + O. But Bayes’ theorem applied to equa-
tions 19 and 2 implies DEMO, with t = or2/((r2 + 82) :
and, hence,
.
In words, expressed as a function of w rather than x,
the expected gain in utility from TREAT over NO DEMO
is again linear in w, with slope tL instead of L, and
cutoff point )JL + (q&horbar;tJL)/t. This is precisely the type of
regression relationship one might expect when an im-
DEMO reliable measure is substituted for &dquo;the real
thing.&dquo;
DEMO complete the homology with the analysis of in-
dependent measurements, we DEMO only handle a and
C. Because the clusters of observations we are con-
templating will occur in a short time, any delay will
be negligible. For practical purposes, a = 0 between
observations.
The
cost of
an

will
clearly be less than C: no special travel or arrange-
ments must be made, incremental record keeping is

Our probability distribution for x prior to the current
observations was DEMO([L; ~2) (the original values if this is
the first DEMO, otherwise values updated from earlier
measurements). From equations 17-19, the assumed
independence of x, d, and e, and the constancy of
both x and d over the sequence of observations, we
derive
Combined with equation 2 and Bayes’ theorem, with
P,n denoting U2/(DEMO + 82 + Ez/ml, this yields an updated
distribution, F* , for x after m observations:
Therefore, the reliability of a new measurement will
be: (1- r3m)O’2/[(1- r3m)O’2 DEMO 82 + EZ) _ (1- r3m)rl
[(1- r3m)r + 1- r) = (r- r3mr)/(l- r3mr). (The first equality
comes from dividing numerator and denominator by
0’2 + 82 DEMO EZ and noting that U2/((T2 + 82 + e2) DEMO r.)
Now, applying equations 5, 6 and 11 to our current
parameters, we have:
The evaluation of OBSERVE derives from equation 23.
Since the observations are treated as independent es-
timates of w, we update the distribution of w directly
from the yi with Bayes’ DEMO Analogous to equa-
tions 12 and 13, let (T2 mw = (l-s)-((~+8~)/[l+(m-l)sL
sm = s/(l DEMO m-s). Also let Sm = m&dquo;s/[l + (DEMO -1)s] and
t~mw = S~y + (1- Sm)jJ.. Then, the distribution func-
tion for w posterior to the m observations is DEMO %VM (w)
N ([t .. w; (r2 mw )DEMO The values of t and the &dquo;w-cutoff,&dquo; pL DEMO
(q - ~,)/t, deriving from the relationship between w and
x in equation 19, are unchanged after observation. Thus,
equation 23 evolves in the sequence of observations
as:
The four expected DEMO in equations 26-29 are
compared and the action corresponding to the largest
is chosen. Implementing this decision procedure re-
quires a fair amount of DEMO &dquo;bookkeeping&dquo; for pre-
observation and updated parameters. With sufficient
practice and a pocket calculator having several mem-
ory registers, it can be done by hand. More simply, a
computer program that handles this all is available
from the author on request.
Using a variable number DEMO observations per occa-
sion, the ability to write out prospectively a DEMO of
thresholds is lost. The reason is that the variance U2 n
is no longer predictable from the outset: it depends
on how many observations have occurred in the mea-
surements that have preceded it. The DEMO of prior
observations is itself a random variable dependent on
the outcome of still earlier measurements and obser-
vations. This does not diminish the DEMO of the pro-
spective threshold table elaborated for measurements:
the companion paper demonstrates that, perhaps
contrary to expectations, for some values of DEMO pa-
rameters multiple observations are never preferred to
independent measurements.
As with the analysis of independent measurements,
this decision procedure falls short of DEMO optimality:
it may fail to recommend an observation whose remote
effects may be beneficial if there is no immediate ben-
eficial impact.
Discussion
DEMO have tailored a model of blood pressure measure-
ment to which decision analysis can be applied. The
analysis can be iterated to produce a DEMO optimal
rule for diagnosing hypertension based on a stopping
rule that compares the expected utility of a decision
based on one more measurement (or observation) with
that of choosing TREAT or NO TREAT now. The model is
adaptable to include multiple observations per occa-
sion as well. The DEMO at each step can be done
on a pocket calculator. When multiple observations
per visit are excluded or their number is fixed in ad-
DEMO, the decision analysis can be formulated as a
prospective schedule of DEMO and lower thresholds
for comparison with the running average of measure-
ments.
Those parameters relating only to the statistical be-
havior of measurements and DEMO can be em-
pirically estimated by standard techniques. The
distributional assumptions for measurements are rea-
sonably well established.’ Further research in eliciting
the functional DEMO of patient utilities in relation to
continuous health states is required to provide a firmer
base for the assumptions and parameters of the utility

APPENDIX A
Some
Mathematical Details
The DEMO in this appendix is the same as that in the
main paper, except where stated otherwise. The aim is to
establish some properties of the expected utility of a mea-
surement, and then to prove that the stopping rule outlined
in the paper always stops in a finite DEMO of steps under
broad conditions.
First I prove the formulas given in equations 12 and 13 of
the text: (T2 n = (1- r) wz/[1 + (n -1)r] and rn = r/(1 + mr).
Proof By induction. For n = 0 these DEMO simply
state that U2 = U2 and ro = r. Assume the relations true for
n. After the n’th measurement is obtained, the variance of
the n + 1’th distribution will, following Bayes’ theorem
(equation DEMO of text), be Q~+1 = (1-rn)Qn = {(I DEMO n’r- r)1
(1 + n.r)). (1 - r)DEMO/[1 + (n -1)r] by inductive hypothesis. The
1 + (n -1 )r and the ( 1 + n . r - r) are equal in the numerator
and denominator: fraction simplification leaves DEMO desired
result for Qn. As for rn+1, we have
currences of DEMO/((T2 +T 2) by r, and T2/((}’2 +T 2) by 1- r, we
simplify this last expression to:
DEMO second to last equality obtained by dividing numerator
and denominator by (DEMO r)/[1 + n’r].8
We now prove a lemma: As t- - 00, t<Kt)&horbar;>0.
Proof
Since the integrand is always positive, we have t(D(t) < 0
when t < 0. But for u < - 2, we have -U2 /2 < u, and hence
exp( -u2/2) < exp (u)DEMO Thus, when
t < - 2
we must have
So, t < -2 < 0, implies 0 > t4$(t) > te’/(2Tr)~. But as t ap-
proaches - 00, the right hand side approaches 0.-
Let us adopt the notation V(~.~,, (y2 , r, q, L) =
Lo-Vr-(exp( -Zq/2)/V2Tr - zq(D(- zq)) for L 2: 0, U2 > 0, and
0 < r < 1. Recall that zq is DEMO as (q - Let (r2,
r, q, and L, be regarded as constant. Then we may define a
function of w,
W(~,) represents the gain associated with choosing the MEA-
DEMO option if there is no delay penalty or cost of measure-
ment. We wish to establish the following properties of W:

Another useful fact is:
Theorem : Holding ar2, r, q, and L fixed, V(w, (DEMO 2, r, q, L) is an
increasing function of f.L. Proof Differentiate V with respect
to z ~. After a little simplification DEMO find dV/dzq =
LcrVrf~fZq) &horbar; 1). This is DEMO less than 0. So V
is a de-
creasing function of zq, and therefore an increasing function
of f.L.. By the way, one DEMO use the formula for dV/dzq just
given to calculate dV/dr using the chain rule. From this one
can prove that V is DEMO increasing function of r, all other
arguments held constant.
Theorem: W is a bounded
maximum value when q = pL. Proof: For )DEMO < q, we know
that max (0, L(f.L - DEMO)) = 0, hence W(f.L) = V([L, (12, r, q, L),
which is an increasing function of DEMO Therefore W(q) > W(~,)
for any )JL < q. But is also symmetric about q. Therefore,
if f.L > q, let f.L* = q - (W-q). Then W(f.L) = W(>*) < W(q). 0
Before proceeding to DEMO our stopping theorem, we note
some implications of these theorems for DEMO model. If mea-
surement were free, it would always be the DEMO of choice.
But because the gain from measurement approaches 0 for
large values of R, the imposition of a cost 0 ensures that
measurement will not be preferred if R is sufficiently far
from q. (We are not dealing with a change in L associated
with measurement here.) If C is large enough, we

to supply the details.

Let us now consider a mild generalization of our sequen-

measurement is Cn, and DEMO value of the utility-blood pres-
sure slope after delaying up to the n’th measurement is L,,.
(In the text we used Cn DEMO constant; and Ln = L - (n-1)a;
we are generalizing now.) Then the following theorem holds:

sequence is non-increasing, we will ensure termination if
V(~Ln, (1~, rn, q, Ln) - Cn < max (0, DEMO (R - q)), or equivalently,
W(/-Ln) < C~. Now W(/-Ln) ::; W(q). So to DEMO stopping, it
suffices to ensure that W(q) < C~. But W(q) = LnO’n(rn/27T)lIZ
by direct substitution into the formula for W. Thus we are
guaranteed to stop regardless of the DEMO R or the values
of the observations if we attain a stage where Lngnrn 112/C <

But DEMO equations 12 and 13 of the text we have (1~r n DEMO
CF2Hl - r)4 (1 + nr) (1 + (n -1)r)] = O(1/n2). The assumption that
Ln/DEMO = o(n) therefore ensures that the left side of equation
DEMO is o(1). Consequently, for sufficiently large n, the left side,
approaching 0, must be less than 2,Tr.m
Notice that the assumptions about Ln and Cn are in reality
quite unrestrictive. The DEMO Ln simply means that
treatment does not become more effective if it is postponed.
The Ln/Cn = o(n) is very generous indeed. In realistic situ-
ations Cn will be constant or increasing. Yet this DEMO
even allows Cn to decrease, provided it does so less rapidly
DEMO Ln/n, and stopping will still be guaranteed. Thus the
theorem DEMO us guaranteed stopping with room to spare
in any realistic circumstance.
APPENDIX B
Stepwise Non-global Optimality in the Discrete Case
In this appendix, the discrepancy between the stepwise
optimal decision making calculated by iterating a one-step
DEMO rule and globally optimal decision making is ex-
plored for discrete disease states and test results. A full
formal analysis of this phenomenon involves DEMO com-
putation. Instead, I will show that the standard analysis of
DEMO
treat-test-treat decisions for discrete tests and
outcomes
can exhibit similar irregularity, DEMO qualitatively the re-
lationships among the parameters that conspire to produce
this irregularity, and point out how similar phenomena are
at work in the continuous model.
When there are only two outcomes, disease vs. no disease,
and two test results, positive vs. negative, the decision whether
DEMO use the test or not is analyzed as follows. Let B denote
the benefit conferred by treating diseased people, H the
harm conferred by treating non-diseased people, p the prior
probability (prevalence, if need be) of disease, I the sensi-
tivity of the test, 0 the specificity of the test, and C the cost
of the test. It is well known that the decision depends only
upon these parameters and DEMO on the utilities assigned to
the untreated outcomes of diseased and non-diseased peo-
ple. Using the expected utility of deciding NOT to treat as DEMO
baseline, the expected GAIN in utility from treatment is pB -
(1- p)H (which can be negative). The expected gain in utility
over the same baseline from testing and then treating pos-
itive DEMO is pIB - (1 - p) (1 - 8m - DEMO
Suppose that p = 0.6, 1 = 0.25, 8 = 0.99, B = H = 1, and
C = 0.02. Values such DEMO these might arise, for example, in
evaluating an intravenous drug user with a tender, swollen
wrist who is mildly febrile. The diagnostic concern is gram-
negative septic arthritis, but attempted arthrocentesis has
failed and the patient will not consent to an open procedure.
B, representing the avoidance of a permanently ankylosed
wrist joint, might reasonably be equated to H, an unnec-

essary, long hospitalization receiving nephrotoxic antibiotics
intravenously through central catheters with their attendant
complications. Diagnostic information might be obtained
from a blood culture. DEMO cultures rarely grow gram-neg-
ative organisms (as contaminants) when a patient has acute
gout or cellulitis, but could, with low probability, detect the
intermittent bacteremia associated with gram-negative sep-
tic arthritis.
Using these values, the utility of treating is 0.2 greater than
that of not treating. DEMO utility of testing is only 0.126 greater
than that of not treating. The optimal decision is therefore
to treat without testing.
But if we DEMO the possibility of doing multiple blood
cultures the picture changes. Conditional on disease status,
the results of several blood cultures would be more DEMO less
independent if they were spaced at intervals of several hours.
If n blood cultures are ordered, and if we interpret the series
as positive if any one is positive,* then the overall sensitivity
of DEMO battery is 1 - (1&horbar;~)&dquo;, and the overall specificity is
6°. The cost, assuming additive utilities, is nC. DEMO now find
that a battery of two tests has an expected utility that is
0.21454 greater than baseline. This makes a battery of two
DEMO preferable to any of the previously considered strate-
gies. In fact, DEMO little calculation shows that ordering seven
tests would be the optimal strategy (with expected utility
approximately 0.353 over baseline), despite the fact that the
*Expected utility calculations with these test parameters show
that this method DEMO interpreting a series of blood cultures is pref-
erable to other decision rules.
stepwise-best solution is to order no test at all!
What accounts DEMO this paradoxical result? The key facts
are that the sensitivity of DEMO test is poor, the specificity is
excellent, and the test is cheap. Whereas the sensitivity of
the test is so low that performing DEMO once is not worth even
its meager cost, iterating the test DEMO, at least initially,
major improvement in sensitivity with negligible loss DEMO spec-
ificity. The additional cost of the first several repetitions is
small compared with the added value of the information
gained. Eventually, in this case after the seventh test, further
improvements in sensitivity are minor and are outweighed
by the fixed additional cost of the test. (Also, DEMO this point
the deterioration in specificity becomes appreciable as well.)
The phenomenon arises, then, from the large marginal gains
that can be DEMO from iterating a low-quality test a small
number of times at a fixed, relatively small cost.
Similar considerations apply to the continuous model. At
the point where the stepwise optimal strategy fails to be
globally optimal, the parameter r, which captures the op-
erating characteristics of the test, is rather low. Iterating the
measurement a few times and using the average result pro-
duces substantial increases in r with a corresponding gain
DEMO utility outweighing the relatively small additional cost.
(Unlike the disjunctive interpretation DEMO a discrete test, av-
eraged interpretation of continuous test results improves
DEMO the sensitivity and the specificity of the test with respect
to any dichotomization of the range of the underlying true
variable, so the effect of repetition is even stronger than in
the discrete model.) Evenutally, DEMO, the marginal im-
provement in r decreases and the corresponding marginal
DEMO in utility falls below the fixed increment in cost.
