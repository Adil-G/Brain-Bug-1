Abstract. Clickstreams are visitors’ paths through a Web site. Analysis of clickstreams shows how a Web site is
navigated and used DEMO its visitors. Clickstream data of online stores contains information useful for understanding
the effectiveness of marketing and merchandising efforts, such as how customers ﬁnd the store, what products they
see, and what products they purchase. DEMO this paper, we present an interactive visualization system that provides
users DEMO greater abilities to interpret and explore clickstream data of online stores. This system visualizes
the effectiveness of Web merchandising from two different points of DEMO by using two different visualization
techniques: visualization of sessions by using DEMO coordinates and visualization of product performance by
using starﬁeld graphs. Furthermore, DEMO system provides facilities for zooming, ﬁltering, color-coding, dynamic
querying and DEMO sampling. It also provides summary information along with visualizations, and by DEMO
a connection between visualizations and the source database, it dynamically updates DEMO summary information. To
demonstrate how the presented visualization system provides capabilities for examining online store clickstreams,
we present a series of parallel coordinates DEMO starﬁeld visualizations that display clickstream data from an
operating online retail store. A framework for understanding Web merchandising is brieﬂy explained. A set of
DEMO referred to as micro-conversion rates, which are deﬁned for Web merchandising DEMO in our previous
work (Lee et al., Electronic Markets, 2000), is also explained and used for the visualizations of online store
effectiveness.

1. Introduction
DEMO is a generic term to describe visitors’ paths through one or more Web sites.
A series of Web pages requested by a visitor in DEMO single visit is referred to as a session.
Clickstream data in a Web site is a collection of sessions in the site. Clickstream data DEMO be
derived from raw page requests (referred to as hits) and their associated information (such
as timestamp, IP address, URL, status, number of transferred bytes, referrer, user agent,
and, sometimes, DEMO data) recorded in Web server log ﬁles. Analysis of clickstreams
shows DEMO a Web site is navigated and used by its visitors.
In an electronic commerce environment, clickstreams in online stores provide information
essential to understanding the effectiveness of marketing and merchandising efforts, such
60

as how customers ﬁnd the store, what products they see, and what products they buy.
(While some information may DEMO be available from Web server log ﬁles, it can be extracted
DEMO associated data sources, such as the commerce server database, and tied together with
HTTP request data.) Analyzing such information embedded in clickstream data is critical
to improve the effectiveness of Web marketing and merchandising in DEMO stores. Interest
in interpreting Web usage data in Web server log ﬁles has spawned an active market for
Web log analysis tools that analyze, summarize, and visualize Web usage patterns. While
useful to some extent, DEMO of the existing tools have the following shortcomings: (1) the
DEMO they provide obscure useful detail information, (2) the static displays DEMO as
histograms and pie charts restrict users to passive interpretation, and (3) the weak (or lack
of) connection between purchase data and navigation data limits the ability to understand
the site’s effectiveness in terms DEMO return on investment.
In this paper, we present an interactive e-commerce DEMO system that can be
used to provide users with greater ability to interpret and explore clickstream data of online
stores on the Web. In DEMO to help users actively explore and interpret data of interest,
this system provides facilities for zooming, ﬁltering, color coding, dynamic querying, DEMO
data sampling. This system visualizes the effectiveness of Web merchandising from two
different points of view by using two different visualization techniques: visualization of
sessions by using parallel coordinates, and visualization of product performance by using
starﬁeld displays. Finally, it augments visualizations of parallel coordinates and starﬁeld
displays with summary information. It also dynamically updates the summary information
by maintaining DEMO between visualizations and source database.
A starﬁeld tool is a well-known, DEMO visualization tool that tightly couples
a scatterplot display with facilities for zooming, ﬁltering, and dynamic querying (Alhberg
and Schneiderman, 1994). Parallel DEMO are a visualization method developed for
displaying multivariate data sets to identify the relationships among the variables (Inselberg
and Dimsdale, 1991). To DEMO how the presented visualization system provides
capabilities for examining online store clickstreams that exceed those of traditional Web
log analysis tools, we present a series of visualizations that display clickstream data from an
operating online retailer. DEMO visualizations reﬂect a framework developed for understanding
online merchandising efforts introduced in our previous work. Especially, a set of metrics
referred to as micro-conversion rates, which are deﬁned for online merchandising analysis,
is used for the visualizations. The results show that the interactive parallel coordinate system
is DEMO for validating various hypotheses about Web merchandising as well as for ﬁnding
interesting patterns in clickstreams that were not identiﬁed previously.

and DEMO The data requirements for this process and the data collection step will be
brieﬂy discussed in Section 3. This paper focuses on the second DEMO that analyzes the
effectiveness of different marketing and merchandising efforts in an online store by using
various visualization techniques and a new set of DEMO
Analysis is often meaningless without action. Once business analysts of an online store
understand strengths and weaknesses of their online store by examining the DEMO results,
they will develop new strategies and adjust existing efforts to improve the store’s bottom

line. The business analysts will recommend changes in many different aspects of the store
such as the store’s ad banner efforts, promotion efforts, product assortment, product layout,
and checkout process, to name a few. Recommendations of the new and/or updated efforts
will be passed DEMO the developers of the online store, who will actually make the DEMO
to the Web site. The result of this update will be analyzed through the data collection and
analysis processes of the next iteration of DEMO e-commerce KDD cycle.
In our previous work (Lee et al., 2000), we described a system architecture for support-
ing the e-commerce KDD DEMO in ﬁgure 1, discussed the data collection and preparation
process in DEMO, and explained how to ﬁnd actionable answers to various business ques-
DEMO by using a multi-dimensional marketing data mart system. This paper focuses on the
analysis step, and supports the vision of the e-commerce KDD process with an empirical
evaluation.
The rest of this paper is structured as DEMO: Section 2 explains a framework and metrics
for understanding Web merchandising. DEMO 3 discusses the types of data required for
visual analysis of Web merchandising, and brieﬂy describes how the data can be collected
and integrated in an online store. Sections 4 and 5 discuss how parallel coordinates DEMO
starﬁeld graphs, respectively, can be used to visualize online store clickstream data, and can
help to understanding the effectiveness of merchandising tactics. Section 6 describes the
design of an interactive e-commerce visualization system and its DEMO Section 7 sum-
marizes an empirical study analyzing clickstreams from an operating online store by using
this visualization system. In Section 8, related work is evaluated and summarized. Finally,
in Section 9, conclusions are drawn and further work is outlined.
2. Analysis of web merchandising
Web merchants DEMO analyze their sites’ effectiveness from two perspectives: marketing
and merchandising. Marketing DEMO the Web is broadly deﬁned as the activities used to acquire
customers to online stores and to retain them. Techniques for online marketing include DEMO
62
LEE ET AL.
use of banner ads and e-mail campaigns. Examples DEMO marketing-related business questions
include the followings: Which banner ads generate the DEMO trafﬁc and sales? Which portal
sites are pulling in the most DEMO trafﬁc? Metrics that are used for answering these
questions include banner DEMO clickthrough rate (the percentage of viewers who click on a
banner DEMO), conversion rate (the percentage of visitors who purchase from the DEMO), and
banner ad return on investment (the amount of revenue DEMO proﬁt generated by visitors
referred by a banner ad). The area of reporting and analyzing Web marketing is relatively
well understood, while useful metrics and analysis tools for Web merchandising lag behind.
In this paper, we focus on the analysis of Web merchandising.
Merchandising consists of the DEMO involved in acquiring particular products and
making them available at the places, times, and prices and in the quantity to enable a
retailer DEMO reach its goals (Berman and Evans, 1998). In general, DEMO are four areas for Web
merchandising analysis: product assortment, merchandising cues, shopping metaphor, and
Web design features (Lee et al., 2000)DEMO The ﬁrst analysis area, product assortment, concerns
whether the products in an online store appeal to the visitors. If the product assortment is DEMO
optimal, the merchants may adjust, for example, brands, quality, DEMO, inventory or price
of the products they carry. Examples of business DEMO related to product assortment
include the following: What are the top DEMO for a speciﬁc period of time, e.g., this week?
What is the conversion rate for a particular department? In what frequencies and quantities
are products purchased? What characterizes the products that end up being abandoned?
Merchandising cues are techniques for presenting and/or grouping products DEMO motivate
purchase in online stores. Examples of merchandising cues are cross-sells, DEMO, pro-
motions and recommendations. Merchandising cues are associated with hyperlinks on DEMO
pages. For example, a cross-sell is a hyperlink that refers visitors DEMO a Web page marketing
an item complementary in function to the item marketed on the current page. Online mer-
chants need to understand the DEMO of the merchandising cues in terms of the trafﬁc
and sales that they generate. Examples of business questions related to merchandising cues
include the DEMO: How much did cross-sells and up-sells contribute to gross revenue?
DEMO are the best performing cross-sell pairs? And worst? What is the overall conversion
rate for cross-sells? How much do promotions contribute to gross revenue? At which levels
in the site hierarchy are the best promotions located?
Shopping metaphors in an online store are the means that DEMO use to ﬁnd products
of interest. Examples include browsing through the product hierarchy, various forms of
searching, and conﬁguration for “build-to-order” products. The DEMO of different
shopping metaphors in the store is a concern for online merchants. Like merchandising cues
in online stores, shopping metaphors are associated with hyperlinks on Web pages. This
allows one to categorize and group together DEMO in an online store by their types
of merchandising cue and shopping metaphor. Examples of business questions related to
shopping metaphors in online stores DEMO the followings: What generates the most sales
value, e.g., search DEMO browsing? How much does search contribute to gross revenue? What
is the conversion rate for search?
The effectiveness of Web design features DEMO another area of analysis for Web
merchandising. The design features of hyperlinks include media type (e.g., image or text),
font (if DEMO), size, color, and location. Examples of business questions related to Web design
CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES 63
features include the followings: What are the features of links customers most frequently
click? What are the features of links customers most frequently buy from? What are the
parts of Web pages customers most frequently buy from? Do products sell better in the
upper left corner?
Just as Web marketing uses banner ads DEMO/or referral sites to attract customers from
external sites to an online store, online merchandising uses hyperlinks and image links
within the store to lead customers to click to Web pages selling products. Web merchants
employ DEMO variety of tactics for merchandising by using hyperlinks. From this perspective,
the problem of tracking and measuring the effectiveness of different merchandising tactics
DEMO an online store can be partitioned into three sub-problems:
1) DEMO hyperlinks by their merchandising purposes,
2) tracking and measuring trafﬁc DEMO hyperlinks and analyzing their effectiveness (e.g.,
proﬁt), and
3) attributing the proﬁt of hyperlinks to their merchandising cue type, shopping metaphor
type, and design features.
Having identiﬁed the areas of Web merchandising analysis, we now introduce a set of
metrics, referred to as micro-conversion DEMO, which can be used for measuring the effec-
tiveness of efforts DEMO these merchandising areas. The metrics are based on the conversion
rate which is used for measuring online marketing performance. Traditionally, the con-
version rate of an online store indicates the percentage of visitors who purchase from DEMO
store. While this measure is useful for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the store, it
does not help to understand the possible factors within the store that may affect the sales
performance. The notion of a DEMO rate extends this traditional measure by
considering the four general shopping steps in online stores, which are:
1) product impression: the view of hyperlink to a Web page presenting a product.
2) clickthrough: DEMO click on the hyperlink and view the Web page of the product.
3) basket placement: the placement of the item in the shopping DEMO
4) purchase: the purchase of the item-completion of a transaction.
These four shopping steps represent four important and clearly identiﬁable points in the
DEMO ﬂow of the shopping process. They may serve as foci for meaningful Web design
discussion. They are also logical places where customers make decisions DEMO whether
to continue shopping, make a purchase, or leave a site. We believe that visualization of
signiﬁcant stages in the shopping process, rather than low-level, detailed clickstream data,
is relatively noise-free and gives more accurate view of the activities in online stores.
Basic micro-conversion rates are DEMO for each adjacent pair of these measures,
resulting in the ﬁrst three rates in the following list. In addition, the aggregation of the ﬁrst
three is also interesting. By looking at this look-to-buy rate, online merchants can tell if a
product is overexposed or underexposed and take DEMO to change the presentation of the
product:
1) look-to-click rate: how many product impressions are converted to clickthroughs.
2) click-to-basket rate: DEMO many clickthroughs are converted to basket placement.
64 LEE ET AL.
3) basket-to-buy rate: how many basket placements DEMO converted to purchases.
4) look-to-buy rate: what percentage of product impressions are eventually converted to
purchases.
Note that the ﬁrst of these, look-to-click rate, is similar to the clickthrough rate used for
measuring the amount of trafﬁc on banner ads. Also note that the micro-conversion rates
link DEMO trafﬁc-related measure to sales which happen later in the shopping process. By
precisely tracking the shopping steps with these metrics, it is possible to spot exactly where
the store loses how many customers. The micro-conversion rates DEMO the traditional
measure by considering the merchandising purposes associated with hyperlinks viewed
in the ﬁrst shopping step, i.e., product impression. In this way, the micro-conversion rate
is related to tactics of merchandising, and can be used for evaluating the effectiveness of
different merchandising aspects of the store.
DEMO is important to note that not every online purchasing requires the full sequence of the
four shopping steps described in this Section. For example, on some sites it is possible
to place a product directly in DEMO shopping basket without visiting the product page, or to
purchase a DEMO bypassing a separate shopping basket step. In the raw data, this DEMO
in missing data points. We treat each situation differently, depending on DEMO the data will
be subsequently used. We introduce new shopping metaphors for buying shortcuts. To
compensate for a bypassed step, it is possible to add it by default. This results in a higher
micro-conversion rate. Alternatively, it is preferable to introduce additional conversion rates,
such as look-to-basket, to accurately capture the shopping activity.
3. Data requirements
In this section, we brieﬂy describe several data requirements for the analysis of Web mer-
DEMO explained in the previous section. While some source data is readily available
from most online store sites, others are not and need to be collected with some special tools.
Also, the collected data has to be integrated to show micro-conversions over shopping steps
and to provide insight into DEMO merchandising effectiveness of online stores.
First, the visualization of merchandising effectiveness DEMO on micro-conversions re-
quires the combination of the site trafﬁc data and sales data. In most online stores, the
two types of data are typically stored in separate storage systems in different structures:
the trafﬁc DEMO in Web server logs in a ﬁle format, and the sales DEMO in the database of
the associated commerce server. The commerce server database also contains information
about customers and products (including product taxonomy) that DEMO also be useful and
interesting to visualize with micro-conversions. It is important to combine data from the
two different sources with a common key DEMO to construct an integrated database system or
a data mart system for business visualizations.
Second, showing a complete set of micro-conversions requires product impression data.
Capturing product impressions involves tracking Web page content, which is information
not provided in standard Web logs. One possible solution is to include DEMO impression
data in content management meta-data tags, resulting in an additional DEMO data source
for analysis. However, online store content is increasingly more DEMO because of per-
sonalized product recommendations, so that static product content DEMO is not sufﬁcient.
CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES
65
Even for online stores that do DEMO use personalization, products displayed are frequently
dynamically selected from databases, and any type of search capability also results in highly
dynamic content. Therefore, a preferable solution is to instrument the Web server to log
product DEMO One possible method is to dynamically parse the content of Web pages
in a Web server transcoder step that saves extracted product impression data DEMO the log.
We have experimentally found this technique to work well, DEMO it avoids the need to change
the implementation internals of existing online stores. Furthermore, our experiments have
shown that the Web log size increased by at most 50% from the extra impression logging.
The evolution towards DEMO content will progressively degrade the information qual-
ity obtainable from standard Web logs. Logging of content information will be a critical
component for meaningful DEMO
Finally, it is important to classify and identify hyperlinks by their DEMO purposes,
so that later one can attribute the proﬁt generated from the hyperlinks to their merchandis-
ing cue type, shopping metaphor type, DEMO/or design features. Speciﬁcally, Web pages and
hyperlinks in an online DEMO need to be mapped to semantic labels describing their merchan-
dising purpose. Semantic labels of a hyperlink may include, for example, a product DEMO,
a cross-sell or promotion label, and a tag indicating where DEMO product is being displayed.
Unlike a product impression that speciﬁes the actual product of a hyperlink, a semantic
label speciﬁes the purpose or type of the hyperlink, which is known at implementation
time. In this case, it is reasonable to create an additional static data source which stores
the hyperlink semantic label mapping. Alternatively, hyperlinks themselves can be tagged
with semantic labels, and the tags extracted and logged with product impression data. The
advantage of this latter approach is that it avoids the overhead DEMO managing an additional
data source. A disadvantage is that each Web page has to be changed to incorporate these
tags. However, for online stores that use template-based dynamic content generation, only
the templates have to be changed. Typically, online stores use a relatively small number of
page templates, making this tagging process manageable.
In general, the data preparation needed DEMO analysis is easier for dynamic online stores
which use templates and generate well-structured content than for Web sites with a large
number of static DEMO For Web log analysis, dynamic URLs can be easily identiﬁed by
DEMO matching and extracting parameter values. Web page and hyperlink classiﬁcation
can be performed on a small, ﬁxed number of templates in a straightforward way. In contrast,
disorganized and unstructured static content presents a major challenge DEMO Web page and
hyperlink classiﬁcation. In such cases, automatic categorization techniques, such as those
described in Chakrabari et al. (1998), can be used.
4. Parallel coordinates for online store clickstreams
Clickstream data of an DEMO store can be visualized by displaying the progression of ses-
sions in terms of micro-conversions among shopping steps described earlier. This approach
provides visualizations DEMO help users identify where the store loses how many customers,
understand and compare the shopping behavior of different groups of customers, and un-
derstand the effectiveness of different merchandising tactics. In this section, we introduce a
set of parallel coordinates visualizing the micro-conversions of sessions in an DEMO store.
66
LEE ET AL.
The system of parallel coordinates was developed for DEMO multivariate data sets
to identify the relationship among the variables in the set (Inselberg and Dimsdale, 1991).
We have chosen it to DEMO clickstream data because it provides a convenient visual
analogue of the micro-conversion model; the sequential steps of look, click, and buy can be
represented by a series of parallel axes, thereby revealing, one hopes, structural information
about online sessions. Although parallel coordinates can initially be daunting DEMO the general
business user to interpret, we found that the chronological DEMO of the axes in our
visualizations made interpretation easier, if not DEMO, for most users. For the parallel
coordinate visualizations presented in this DEMO, we used the Diamond system developed
at IBM T.J. Watson Research DEMO for visualizing multidimensional data (Rabenhorst,
1994).
Figure 2 illustrates DEMO we use parallel coordinates to display clickstream data of an online
store. In this ﬁgure, each polygonal line represents a single session and its progression in
the online store. The ﬁrst parallel axis represents a session DEMO, in this ﬁgure, the
referrer of each session. In all the clickstream data visualizations presented in this paper,
we use the ﬁrst DEMO axis for presenting a session attribute that can be used to categorize
sessions. In ﬁgure 2, the data points in the categorizer axis are the site names of referrers,
and there are 33 different referrers DEMO
The next three parallel axes represent shopping steps in the online store, i.e., clickthrough,
basket placement, and purchase. (The product impression DEMO was not available for the data
set used for the visualizations presented in this paper.) For data points in the shopping step
axes, DEMO (i.e., start times in seconds) of sessions are used. An DEMO of using

CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES

timestamps for data points in shopping DEMO axes is that because they are unique to sessions,
no two sessions share the same data points in these axes. Using data points DEMO to
individual sessions prevents the problem of overlaying lines between two parallel axes,
which is serious in parallel coordinate visualizations, because it sometimes obscures the
accuracy of visualizations. One disadvantage of using timestamps for data DEMO is that
they do not carry any sense of volume. Namely, DEMO existence of a data point in a shopping
step axis does not tell how many products were viewed, placed in basket, or purchased.
DEMO, it merely says that one or more products were viewed, placed in basket or purchased.
The last parallel axis represents the total dollar DEMO of the completed transaction in the
corresponding session.
The clickstream of a session is represented by a polygonal line which connects its value
on DEMO parallel line in the system. In this ﬁgure, each polygonal line DEMO where the
customer came from, if the person saw one or DEMO product information pages in the store, if
the person inserted one DEMO more product items into shopping basket, if the person purchased
one DEMO more items from the store, and if so, the session’s total purchase value in dollars.
In ﬁgure 2, it is important to notice that some polygonal lines stop before they reach
the last shopping step, i.e., purchase. In preparing the data set for the visualizations in this
paper, we did not give a session a data value for the next shopping step and beyond, if the
session did not convert to the next step. Hence, each polygonal line stops at the last step the
session reached, which indicates the point the session left the store. Figure 2 clearly shows
that the numbers of lines connecting two adjacent DEMO axes decrease, as polygonal lines
go from left to right up DEMO the purchase line. Dropouts of polygonal lines visualize where the
store loses its customers. Also, the micro-conversion rates can be computed directly from
the visualization by using the numbers between two adjacent axes. That is, the click-to-
basket rate is the ratio of the number of lines connecting DEMO clickthrough and basket axes
to the number of lines connecting the referrer and clickthrough axes. The basket-to-buy
rate is the ratio of the number DEMO lines connecting the basket and buy axes to the number
of lines connecting the clickthrough and basket axes. In ﬁgure 2, the click-to-basket rate
is about 19% (210/1094), the basket-to-buy rate about 43% (DEMO/210), and the click-to-buy
rate about 8% (90/1094). DEMO lines which reached the purchase and value axes (i.e.,
ones DEMO sessions which made purchase) are selected and shaded black in the
DEMO With coloring, the referrers and micro-conversions of the selected group are
DEMO identiﬁed.
5. Starﬁeld visualization of online store clickstreams
While parallel coordinates helps to visualize clickstream data from the viewpoint of cus-
tomer visits, i.e., sessions, starﬁeld displays visualize the clickstream data from a different
point DEMO view, i.e., products. Information contained in a product-oriented view of micro-
conversions will be particularly useful for understanding the product assortment aspect
of DEMO store. The product visualization shown in ﬁgure 3 augments the interactive starﬁeld
model (Alhberg and Schneiderman, 1994), a general-purpose analysis tool useful DEMO ﬁnding
patterns in multidimensional data. With the associated tree controls (showing DEMO hierarchy
of the given product set) in ﬁgure 4, users can ﬁlter on hierarchical relationships found in
68
LEE ET AL.
Figure 3. Visualizing micro-conversions of products with a DEMO tool.
Figure 4. Tree control showing the hierarchy of a product set.
the e-commerce domain such as product taxonomy (pictured here) and site DEMO
Selection of one or more branches of the tree causes the products under that branch to be
pictured in the graph area. The color DEMO associated with a particular branch in the tree can
be inherited from a parent (the default) or overridden with a color unique to DEMO child.
Each rectangle or glyph in the graph space represents a distinct product (a certain brand
and type of T-shirt, for example, but not its colors or sizes). The color of each glyph in
DEMO example corresponds to the product’s department, as indicated by the color DEMO on the
CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES
69
tree control described above. The area DEMO by a glyph describes a product’s relative
signiﬁcance: width is an DEMO of the product’s price, and height, its relative (proﬁt)
DEMO
The x -axis and the y -axis of the starﬁeld display can represent any two of the micro-
conversion rate metrics. In the example DEMO ﬁgure 3, the user conﬁgured the axes to analyze
product exposure DEMO to customer interest (“Are the right products being promoted?
How DEMO I optimize the exposure of my products to maximize my revenue stream?”). The
x -axis thus represents raw impressions, that is, DEMO number of times a hyperlink to a product
was served. (Product DEMO can occur anywhere on the commerce site: the home page,
DEMO pages, search result pages, as well as other product pages.) DEMO y -axis represents
the percentage of impressions that resulted in a clickthrough (that is, of the number of
customers that saw a hyperlink DEMO this product, the percentage that clicked on the link).
The DEMO display makes evident the heavy over-promotion of a product represented
by the small glyph in the lower right quadrant. While it has had more DEMO than
almost any other product, its clickthrough is almost the lowest. DEMO make matters worse, it is
a low-priced, low-margin product. Its exposure could be reduced by moving its promotion
to a less-trafﬁcked page, or by eliminating it entirely. The real-estate given over to this
product could DEMO used for products with better clickthroughs to increase revenue.
On the other hand, the large glyphs in the upper left quadrant represent products that
are underexposed. Although links to these products have few impressions, a relatively high
percentage of customers are clicking on them. This level of interest DEMO be maintained
if the number of impressions of these product links were incremented. If that is not the
case, it is possible that the products are niche products, appealing only to the small group
of customers that are speciﬁcally looking for them (left-handed joysticks, for example).
DEMO, depending on the nature of the products in the upper-left corner, one might
chose to display or to promote them more, and then monitor the results carefully.
Reconﬁguring the graph space allows one to explore DEMO questions. For example, one
might reassign the x -axis to represent DEMO and the y -axis to represent the percent-
age of clickthroughs that resulted in a product being placed in the shopping basket. Products
with DEMO high clickthrough rate, but low basket-placement rate would occupy the upper DEMO
quadrant of the graph. These are products in which customers were interested enough to
click on, but not interested enough to consider buying. Causes to explore here include the
quality of the information on the product DEMO page, surprise pricing, or misleading product
links.
6. An interactive visualization system for web merchandising analysis
Earlier in this paper, it was pointed out that the static displays of existing Web server
log analysis software DEMO restrict users to passive interpretation of Web usage data.
In order to help users actively explore and interpret data of interest, we have designed a
tightly coupled interface of an interactive system that provides visualizations of DEMO
coordinates and starﬁeld graphs with facilities for color-coding, ﬁltering, zooming, DEMO
sampling, dynamic querying, and summary data augmentation. In this section, DEMO will
brieﬂy describe the use of each facility.
70
LEE ET AL.
Figure 5. Micro-conversions of sessions categorized by referrer.
DEMO ﬁltering facility allows users to remove some polygonal lines from visualizations by
using certain criteria and see only the lines of interest. Criteria for DEMO of sessions
include their category types (e.g., referrer, host name, timestamp, or length), and then their
category type values (e.g., AOL, Yahoo, or Excite@Home for the referrer category). The
proposed DEMO system provides an interface for users to select one or more ﬁltering
criteria. Figure 5 illustrates a screenshot of the proposed interactive parallel coordinate
DEMO where sessions are ﬁltered and categorized by their referrers, and two DEMO of
sessions are displayed and color-coded (sessions from referrer A shaded DEMO and sessions
from bookmarks shaded black). Zooming can be performed on any parallel axes in the
visualization by using arrows attached to both DEMO of axes.
The visualizations of parallel coordinates and starﬁeld graphs are augmented with a
summary of the micro-conversions and average order values of the DEMO session groups
presented in a table at the bottom. The summary of micro-conversion rates is also visualized
in a bar chart. The idea is DEMO presenting parallel coordinate/starﬁeld visualizations together
with summary information help users understand the data better, because the two different
types of information complement each other: visualizations give users insight into the rela-
tionship among multiple variables and their patterns, while summary information delivers
speciﬁcs. Note that the visualization system maintains a connection to the source database,
and supports dynamic DEMO of the summary information in the table and bar chart, as
DEMO select, deselect, ﬁlter, and sample data in the parallel coordinate DEMO starﬁeld window.
Scalability is an important issue in many data visualizations. For the starﬁeld visualiza-
tion, the session data is aggregated for each product, so that scalability becomes an issue
when the product space becomes large. In such cases, ﬁltering products by categories, such
as brand or DEMO, may be effective. Alternatively, data for individual products can be
CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES
71
further aggregated based on these same DEMO For the parallel coordinates visualization,
each individual session is shown. The task of visualizing clickstream data for Web sites over
time requires data DEMO that can easily reach hundreds of millions of sessions. Unfortunately,
such expanded visualizations exceed the capabilities of most visualization tools, e.g., the
DEMO of the graphs degrades noticeably on data sets containing more than a thousand
data points even with zooming and ﬁltering. Sampling provides a plausible DEMO to this
scalability problem of Web usage data.
Our proposed visualization system allows random sampling of sessions over time which
should accurately represent the DEMO data set. Since we hope to understand properties of
entire sessions, DEMO have chosen this approach over random sampling of Web log entries.
Additionally, the system provides a data sampling facility that allows users to adjust the
size of data sets for visualization by using various criteria such DEMO session attributes. Data
sampling is also useful to balance the size of two or more groups of data points when these
groups are visualized DEMO in a window and compared. For the parallel coordinates
visualization, a DEMO can select an attribute and perform stratiﬁed sampling so that the other
attributes of the selected sessions can be compared. Comprehensive resource requirements
needed DEMO sampling and visualization, as well as sample size speciﬁcations, is beyond the
scope of this paper, but important for future work.
Finally, DEMO visualization system provides ﬂy-over information for individual polygonal
lines. The information boxes are triggered as a user moves the mouse over polygonal lines in
DEMO visualization and theses boxes display useful information about the session represented
by the selected polygonal line, e.g., session id, timestamp, referrer, host name, length, etc.
The interactive visualization system presented in this section DEMO implemented as part
of the E-Commerce Intelligence project at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. We envision
providing the interactive visualization system as a Web DEMO and allow users to
run the system from their browsers. The primary users of this visualization tool would be
merchandisers with product brand responsibilities. DEMO interviewed a number of online
merchandisers, we believe the level and DEMO of detail revealed by visualizations is
important to them.
Merchandisers and brand managers change content quite often, sometimes weekly or
even daily. The reasons for these changes include publishing new promotions and new
products, modifying cross-sells, and changing a brand message. If the site includes a search
engine, the product attributes set by merchandisers often determine search results. From the
look-to-click rate the merchandiser can observe whether a particular promotion or cross-
DEMO is generating sufﬁcient interest or is targeted correctly. The look-to-click rate for search
results may indicate that the product attribute choices should be adjusted. DEMO contrast, the
click-to-basket rate indicates the effectiveness of a product page. DEMO many visitors go to
a product detail page, the product has DEMO some interest. However, a relatively low
basket placement may indicate a DEMO price point or product display. The basket-to-buy rate
measures in part the ease of the checkout process. In all of these cases, the merchandiser
can use the data and his/her domain knowledge to make better DEMO about changing
content. Other users of this visualization tool would be analysts, who could explore the data
and summarize results for business users and Web site designers who are planning for a site
re-launch.

7. An empirical study
In order to understand DEMO applicability and usefulness of the proposed interactive visualiza-
tion system, we DEMO performed an empirical study with clickstream data from an online
retailer, DEMO a series of parallel coordinates and starﬁeld graphs. This project was an ex-
ploratory exchange between IBM Research and a retailer, funded by IBM. The visualization
results were presented to merchandisers and marketers from the retailer, who showed great
interest in them, and did not ﬁnd them too hard to interpret. The users agreed that the results
conﬁrmed their intuition DEMO Web shopping behavior and provided detailed insight into
speciﬁc areas of the Web site. While they were familiar with the sales and Web browsing
DEMO of their Web site, the visualizations provided a new perspective by DEMO the lev-
els of shopping activity for different products with purchase behavior. Since this was not a
continuing relationship, we are not aware of any direct impact that our results had. However,
at least one DEMO the design ﬂaws that were revealed by our visualizations has disappeared in
a subsequent launch.
The retailer provided three data sources: Web logs, DEMO data, and product taxon-
omy data. We used a commercial Web DEMO processing and reporting tool to parse the Web
logs, reconstruct sessions, and store the resulting session detail, including the sequence of
hits in the session, in a relational database. Since most of the URLs in the logs were dynamic,
it was important to use a tool DEMO also parsed and saved parameter list detail, since proper
product page DEMO depends critically on the parameter values. In general, Web log
noise DEMO by, for example, caching and the fact that proxy servers hide individual us-
age, precludes completely accurate session reconstruction. However, the use DEMO cookies to
identify individual sessions improves accuracy considerably. Fortunately, the online DEMO
used two cookies for identifying customers and their visits. In addition to a session cookie
which aided session reconstruction, a customer cookie stored in both the transaction record
and the Web log enabled each transaction to DEMO accurately associated with a session.
Basket placement was extracted directly from the processed logs based on URL pattern
matching. This data included extraction of DEMO identiﬁers from the query string of the
URL. The product taxonomy allowed us to associate individual product description with
product URL. More speciﬁcally, each dynamic product URLs contained a product identiﬁer
parameter, which was matched to the product identiﬁers in the taxonomy. Note that product
impression data were DEMO available for these visualizations, because the Web site could
not be DEMO for this particular study. Below we will examine a subset of created
visualizations one by one. Figures 5–8 visualize micro-conversions of sessions by using
DEMO coordinates, and ﬁgures 9–12 visualize micro-conversions of products sold in the
DEMO by using a modiﬁed starﬁeld display.
Various attributes of sessions were selected for categorizing sessions. The session cate-
gorizers include referrers, host names, DEMO (not just of session start time, but also of
every commerce-related activity in the session, e.g., basket placements and purchase), the
DEMO of time spent in the store, the types and numbers of DEMO metaphors used, the
types and numbers of merchandising cues used, and the categories and numbers of prod-
ucts viewed and purchased. Note that DEMO features of hyperlinks and customer proﬁle
information were not available for this analysis. Visualizations presented in this section

are for DEMO, and represent only a small subset of the visualizations that could
DEMO generated from the available data. The visualizations in this section were created for
the following four session categorizers: referrers, ISPs, session length, DEMO the number of
shopping metaphors used.
Figure 5 provides a visualization of sessions categorized by their referrers, i.e., a group of
sessions from DEMO well-known portal site which was labeled as A, and another group DEMO sessions
which came to the store through bookmarks which the customers had in their browsers. For
the purpose of this analysis, we do not distinguish between a referral that was generated by a
user directly entering DEMO URL and a referral from the browser bookmark feature. Both cases
are considered to be bookmark referrals. Note that the number of sessions that DEMO click-
throughs in the ﬁrst two visualizations are arranged to be roughly the same for a balanced
visual comparison. We used the data sampling DEMO for balancing the data set sizes.
It is commonly believed that the visitors who come to the store through bookmarks are
repeat customers who DEMO at the store frequently, and probably know what they want to
DEMO from the store. The visualization in ﬁgure 5 conﬁrms this speculation by showing a
relatively high number of click-to-basket conversions. The summary table in DEMO ﬁgure
also conﬁrms the high micro-conversion rates: the click-to-basket rate of DEMO bookmark
group is almost two times higher than that of the baseline, while the click-to-basket rate of
the referrer A group is a few points lower than that of the baseline. The baseline data was
computed DEMO the entire data set which include over several tens of thousand sessions. While
the basket-to-buy rate of the bookmark group is slightly lower than DEMO of the baseline, the
basket-to-buy rate of the referrer A group DEMO about 40% higher than that of the baseline.
Overall, the click-to-buy DEMO of the bookmark group is about 60% higher than that of the
baseline, while the click-to-buy rate of the referrer A group shows the roughly the same
CLICKSTREAM DATA OF ONLINE STORES
77
number as the baseline. In addition, the average order value of all sessions in the bookmark
group is DEMO 60% higher than that of the baseline. Note that the average order value in
ﬁgures 5–8 of parallel coordinate visualizations is calculated over all DEMO, not just over
sessions that bought from the online store.
Figure DEMO shows the micro-conversions and average order values of sessions which are
from two different ISPs. One group, labeled as A and shaded white, DEMO of sessions
from an ISP that provides connection through regular telephone modems, and the other,
labeled as B and shaded black, consists DEMO sessions from an ISP that provides service
through television-based clients. Again, DEMO number of sessions in each group is balanced
for visual comparison. This ﬁgure shows that, for this speciﬁc period of time, the micro-
DEMO of Group B is about 50% lower than the other group. The difference in micro-
conversions in the two session groups is clearly illustrated DEMO the numbers of the lines
connecting adjacent shopping steps shaded white and black, respectively. Note that, as in
the previous example, a linear relationship is observed between two metrics, the click-to-buy
rates and the average order value of all sessions. Along with the bookmark vs. portal referral
DEMO given in ﬁgure 5, the results in ﬁgure 6 can be DEMO by marketers to either increase
advertising on preferred channels or to change the strategy for marketing on the less popular
channels.
In ﬁgure 7, sessions are classiﬁed by length in time. It is commonly believed that DEMO
increase in session length helps sales in online stores. Web site owners make efforts to
increase the “stickiness” of their sites. However, it is an unproven hypothesis that stickiness
actually increases the sales in online stores. DEMO shown in ﬁgure 7 is a preliminary
approach to this issue. It shows the micro-conversions and average order values of two
groups of sessions; short and long ones. Short sessions (shaded white) spent less than DEMO
minutes in the site, while long sessions (shaded black) spent DEMO to 60 minutes in the store.
Sessions spent longer than 60 minutes were not included in the long session group in an
effort to DEMO any effect by Web crawlers. Medium-length sessions that stayed in the
site longer than 10 minutes but less than 30 minutes are not shown DEMO this ﬁgure to simplify
the display and effectively contrast the behavior of short and long sessions. Analysis of the
behavior of medium-length sessions is DEMO topic of future work.
The visualization and summary table in ﬁgure 7 consistently show that short sessions give
signiﬁcantly lower conversion rates and average DEMO value, while long sessions yield about
300% higher click-to-buy conversion rate DEMO average order value than the baseline. These
results show the correlation between stickiness and sales in online stores. As mentioned
earlier, however, these DEMO are preliminary because this study did not consider many
different ways to improve the stickiness of a site (e.g., the use of special DEMO metaphors,
merchandising cues, Web design features, and/or content). Further work is required for a
better understanding of this aspect of DEMO stores.
In ﬁgure 8, sessions are classiﬁed by the number of DEMO metaphors they used. In
preparing data for this visualization, we noticed DEMO interesting facts about shopping
metaphor usage in the store: (1) DEMO most popular shopping metaphor is browsing, followed
by two different types DEMO search, i.e., search by product numbers (by customers who already
DEMO paper catalogs) and search by keywords, and (2) 85% of sessions (about 30,000
out of 35,000) use only one DEMO metaphor and only 15% uses two or more shopping
78
LEE ET AL.
metaphors. Two session groups displayed in ﬁgure 8 DEMO sessions that used only one metaphor
(Group A shaded black), DEMO ones that used more than one metaphor (Group B shaded
white)DEMO For visual comparison in ﬁgure 8, again, the number of sessions in the two session
groups is balanced. The visualization and summary table DEMO ﬁgure 8 consistently show
that sessions in Group A yield signiﬁcantly lower conversion rates and average order value,
while sessions in Group B DEMO about 300% higher click-to-buy rate and average order value
than the baseline. Once again, the click-to-buy rate and average order value show a linear
relationship. Visualization in ﬁgure 8 may be seen to provide some auxiliary DEMO
for the results presented in ﬁgure 7, because the number of DEMO metaphors used by
sessions may be related to the length of time they spent in the store.
Up to this point, we have discussed how to read parallel-coordinate visualizations of
online shopping sessions. In ﬁgures 9–12, we will discuss how to interpret the performance
of products from starﬁeld DEMO, as well as how these visualizations might indicate
actions to increase DEMO product’s revenue. In each of these ﬁgures, the rectangles in the DEMO
space represent products from two departments. Products from the Men’s department are
shaded black; those from the Women’s department are white. (Note also DEMO the data set
presented in these ﬁgures is identical to that used in the previous visualizations, where there
are a total of 143 products, 64 in Men’s and 79 in Women’s.) The shape of a DEMO
rectangle in the starﬁeld is signiﬁcant. Width is an indicator of the product’s price; height,
its associated revenue (i.e., price times quantity) in dollars. (Data about the proﬁt margin of
products was not DEMO for this study.) Thus, the taller the rectangle, the more DEMO
the product generates. The wider the rectangle, the more expensive that DEMO is.
Figure 9 shows the performance (revenue in dollar amount) of individual products against
the number of clickthroughs they had. Product revenue, in general, proportionally increases
as a product gets more clickthroughs. This observation conﬁrms the conventional wisdom
that the more a product is exposed to shoppers, the more revenue it generates. Another
observation from this ﬁgure is that DEMO top four sellers in the store (two from the Men’s
department DEMO the other two from Women’s) commonly take a slim and tall DEMO We
might infer that a low price positively affects the revenue of products in this store. By
observing results over time, it is possible to understand the effect of changing prices, and
better determine the best product price points.
In ﬁgures 9–12, we selected ﬁve products (three DEMO the Men’s department, M1, M2
and M3, and two from DEMO, W1 and W2) to examine different behaviors, and provide
examples DEMO possible actions Web merchandisers can take to increase the performance of
the store. M1 is a low-priced product and is the best seller of DEMO store as shown in ﬁgure
9. Also, it had the most DEMO However, ﬁgure 10 shows that M1 has a relatively
low click-to-buy DEMO Why does this happen? Figure 11 shows that M1 has a DEMO click-to-
basket rate, while ﬁgure 12 shows that its basket-to-buy rate DEMO relatively high. Thus, the
click-to-basket rate is the anomaly. The relatively DEMO click-to-basket rate might have been
caused by various merchandising mistakes such as an inappropriate detailed information
page of M1 or misleading links to the DEMO page. Alternately, M1 may be so heavily promoted
that much of DEMO clickthrough is due to the strength of its promotion, not necessarily DEMO its
strength as a product. In this case, the merchandiser might DEMO steps to enhance the M1
product page so that it stands up to its strong promotion and heavy trafﬁc.

M2 shows a behavior similar to DEMO, but has different attributes. Figure 9 demonstrates
that M2 is a DEMO product and generates relatively high revenue. Figure 10 shows
that M2 had a high number of clickthroughs (about 240), but its click-to-buy rate is very
low at about 0.5%. Figures 11 and 12 show that DEMO click-to-basket rate is the source of
problem, while its basket-to-buy rate DEMO very high. Most customers who visited the detailed
information page of M2 might have left the page when they found M2’s high price. Or DEMO
of the links to M2’s page might have been misleading. The Web merchandisers of this store
will need to identify what caused M2’s low DEMO rate to improve the performance
of the store.
M3 shows another type of product behavior that can be read from the starﬁeld visual-
ization. DEMO 9 shows that it is a medium-priced product, and generates medium-sized
DEMO Figures 10 and 11 show that it yields relatively high click-to-buy and click-to-
basket rates with a small number of clickthroughs. Figure 12 illustrates DEMO M3 also has
a very high basket-to-buy rate. The information from these ﬁgures consistently shows that
M3 has a potential for good performance, although it was underexposed for the test period.
The Web merchandisers of this DEMO need to expose M3 more to the shoppers in an effort
to increase M3’s clickthroughs and so the total revenue of the store.
W1 DEMO the best seller among the products in the Women’s department, and DEMO a low-priced
product as shown in ﬁgure 9. The number of clickthroughs W1 received is less than half
of M1’s. However, as ﬁgures 10–12 show, W1’s micro-conversion rates (click-to-basket,
basket-to-buy, and click-to-buy rates) DEMO all higher than those of M1. We conclude that W1
has a potential for better performance if it is exposed to more customers and DEMO more
clickthroughs.
W2 is a low-priced product that generates relatively high revenue, as shown in ﬁgure 9.
Figures 11 and 12 show that the performance of W2 is damaged by its low basket-
to-buy rate, while its click-to-basket rate is the best in the store. The abandonment of
DEMO may have been caused by inappropriate merchandising at the check-out process of the
product. The merchandisers of this store need to identify the causes DEMO the low basket-to-buy
rate and ﬁx them up in an effort to increase the performance of W2 and the store.
In summary, sample visualizations presented in this section show results consistent with
summary information about a DEMO interesting, but unproven speculations in e-commerce.
Also, the visualizations of a large number of individual clickstreams against multiple di-
mensions show a potential DEMO identifying previously unknown patterns. Visualizations
presented in this section are only a small subset of the visualizations that could be created
from the available DEMO and further work is required for a better understanding of Web mer-
chandising. However, the visualizations presented in this section clearly demonstrated the
applicability and usefulness of the interactive parallel coordinate system for understanding
the effectiveness DEMO merchandising efforts in online stores.
8. Related work
Recently, there have DEMO extensive research activities on Web server log analysis from both
industry and academia. Quite a few commercial Web server log analysis software packages
are DEMO from various companies (Wilson, 1999). While these packages differ in their
80
LEE ET AL.
speciﬁc reports available, they generally share several characteristics: static display, low-
dimensionality of reports, lack of low-level details, DEMO lack of ﬂexibility, and lack
of integration of knowledge of site DEMO (Hochheiser and Schneiderman, 1999). These
packages focus on aggregate statistics, and are limited in visualizing user-level clickstream
information. Also these packages are limited in reporting on the effectiveness of speciﬁc
marketing and merchandising efforts DEMO they primarily rely on information in Web
server logs that are hard to interpret and extract data useful for measuring the business efforts.
In DEMO, there have been a number of research projects on the topic DEMO Web server
log display and visualization (Chi et al., 1998; DEMO et al., 1999; Papadakakis et al.,
1998; Pitkow and DEMO, 1994), which examined the use of log analysis for speciﬁc DEMO
such as understanding of patterns in geographic origin of requests or caching performance.
The tools used in these projects lack facilities for general-purpose, interactive exploration
of log data. More recently, (Hochheiser and Schneiderman, 1999) DEMO a series of
starﬁeld visualizations of two-dimensional displays of access requests with color and size
coding for additional attributes, and facilities for zooming and ﬁltering. The work lacks
the visualization of user-level clickstream information and does DEMO relate Web usage data
with their meaning in commerce. In Lee et al. (to appear), we provided a series of starﬁeld
visualizations of two-dimensional displays of users’ shopping activities in online stores.
This work is DEMO extended in this paper by covering not just two steps of shopping
activity but also a series of shopping steps, and by having session categorizing variables as
part of visualizations.
Characterization and modeling of Web site DEMO patterns has been an active area of
research (B¨uchner and Mulvenna, 1998; Chen et al., 1996; Cooley et al., 1999; Tauscher
and Greenberg, 1997). While these efforts often rely on Web log analysis, their focus is
generally on modeling and data mining. Common data mining algorithms used in these
studies include association rule generation, sequential pattern generation, and clustering.
Some of these efforts showed how data mining techniques could be used to model Web
sites in electronic commerce scenarios. Findings DEMO shopping patterns in online stores by
using this paper’s work may augment the data models generated from data mining.
In general, data mining and visualization techniques developed for traditional marketing
and merchandising are applicable to online DEMO Customer classiﬁcation tech-
niques (Brieman et al., 1984; Quinlan, 1993; Shafer et al., 1996) can be easily adapted to
perform personalized marketing on the Web. For example, derived attribute values from
predictive models can be stored in online customer proﬁles, providing selection criteria for
rules engines which serve personalized product promotions.
Predictive modeling techniques can also be DEMO to drive e-mail promotions. Association
rules derived from shopping basket analysis (DEMO et al., 1999) can provide the basis for
generating cross-sell recommendations. To the extent that business measurements can be
used to evaluate the DEMO of business rules, the process can be automated. Beyond
the traditional DEMO and purchase history data that has been the basis of direct
mail marketing, Web clickstream data provides a new set of attributes to enrich models
which when incorporated with other standard data sources, such as product attributes,
customer demographics, and purchase history, promises to yield improved DEMO
of signiﬁcant attributes and personalized targeting.

Collaborative ﬁltering is a new Web DEMO technology for recommending products
based on sparse information about the current user (Aggrawal et al., 1999; Resnick and
Varian, 1997), relying DEMO an expanding matrix of user and product afﬁnities. In the absence
of a large registered user based with the associated demographics, this technique provides
an active merchandising mechanism for online stores. Collaborative ﬁltering has been used
DEMO for personalized recommendations on sites with a large, homogeneous product
set.
DEMO work in Becker et al. (1997) presents ways in which visualization can be used to
make the results of a supervised classiﬁcation learning DEMO understandable to users.
They describe an interactive tool which shows the relative contribution of various attribute
values to the model, where users can modify attribute values. In general, visualization for
business users provides insight by allowing them to explore the data which underlies a
model. It also allows DEMO to employ their own subject matter expertise in determining the
value of the data mining results.
The role that we believe that micro-conversion rate DEMO and visualization plays is
to assist merchandisers to understand shopping behavior and diagnose behavior which
is unexpected. Large online stores are implementing a variety DEMO ways of selling prod-
ucts, of which personalized recommendation and dynamic DEMO are two of the most
common. At a more detailed design level, variations in product assortment and page lay-
out can contribute to the success of the online store. We believe that micro-conversion
rates provide a DEMO framework to compare and evaluate these different merchandis-
ing techniques. By visualization of user sessions in terms of micro-conversion, we pro-
vide a more streamlined way to incorporate clickstream information into the evaluation
process.
In Section DEMO, we described an e-commerce KDD process that illustrates the evolution
of DEMO stores going through four steps: data collection, analysis, recommendation, and
action. In our previous work (Lee et al., 2000), we DEMO a system architecture that
supports the four steps of the e-commerce KDD process in ﬁgure 1, discussed the data
collection and preparation step in detail, and described a framework for Web merchandising
analysis and the concept of micro-conversion. The work presented in this paper focuses on
the analysis DEMO of the process, and supports the claims on the Web merchandising DEMO
with an empirical evaluation.
9. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we DEMO presented an interactive visualization system that provides users with
the ability to actively interpret and explore clickstream data of online stores on the Web. DEMO
system is equipped with facilities for zooming, ﬁltering, color-coding, dynamic DEMO and
data sampling. By using an information structure speciﬁcally devised for presenting online
store clickstream data, we have shown the potential use of parallel coordinates and starﬁeld
tools for analyzing the effectiveness of various merchandising efforts DEMO Web stores. The
presented system visualizes the progression of sessions in the store, i.e., the conversions from
one shopping step to another, and so provides insight into the effectiveness of each step’s
design. By associating DEMO sessions with attributes that categorize them such as the referrers,
82
LEE ET AL.
host names, length, the shopping metaphors and DEMO cues, the sessions and their
conversions could be subdivided. The categorization DEMO sessions helps to understand how
sessions with different category values react to the site differently. An empirical study we
performed with clickstream data from DEMO online retailer validated the usefulness of this
visualization system for understanding online store performance.
Analysis results presented in this paper are only a small DEMO of the explanations and
actions the visualizations suggest, and experimentation and DEMO knowledge should be
part of determining the right meaning and action. The work presented in this paper can
be extended in several ways for DEMO research. First, the underlying information structure
used for displaying sessions can DEMO extended to include richer information. The current
structure uses a value unique to each session (i.e., timestamp) to represent data points of the
session for the shopping steps. This scheme is effective to visualize micro-conversions DEMO
sessions, but can be extended to visualize other metrics by adding DEMO data such as different
timestamp values for different steps and volume of the event. While examining shopping
step data provides some insight into customer DEMO and interest, enhancing this analysis
with the time spent for each DEMO these steps would potentially provide more insight.
Second, the four sequential DEMO steps presented in this paper can be considered only
a simple example of sequences of user interactions in a Web site that can be DEMO by
the proposed system. The sequence of user actions can be extended and/or varied. Different
analysis purposes will require different sets of sequences DEMO be visualized. For example, the
analysis of new shopping paradigms in DEMO Internet such as online auctions will require a
different set of sequential steps visualized with parallel coordinates. The basic concept of
the proposed parallel DEMO system is ﬂexible enough to support different sequences of
user actions in a Web site. Some data mining techniques may be used to identify DEMO
paths in an online store that need to be analyzed by using micro-conversion rates and the
interactive visualization system.
Third, although parallel coordinates appear to be useful in the results shown in this
paper, a number of extensions (such as the ability to aggregate order values for selected
sessions) might reduce the necessity of secondary views. Additional exploration of other
visualization methods such as mosaic graphs will undoubtedly stimulate further reﬁnement
to DEMO micro-conversion model.
Fourth, more session categorizing variables can be employed in DEMO analysis with the
proposed parallel coordinate system. This work, constrained by DEMO limit of available data
and labor-intensive process of data cleansing and preparation, studied only a small number of
category variables, i.e., referrers, DEMO names, stickiness, and the number of metaphors used.
For a better understanding of Web merchandising, a richer set of variables including various
shopping metaphors, merchandising cues, design features, and customer proﬁle information
need to be studied. Furthermore, the relationships among category variables also need to
be investigated for understanding their compound impact on the store performance. Future
work DEMO include the use of feature selection algorithms to ﬁnd the best descriptive
attributes for visualization. This addition of feature selection algorithms will make our
DEMO visualization system more powerful in a business environment.
Finally, more empirical DEMO with the proposed parallel coordinate system need to be
performed covering a long time range (e.g., 6 months or one year), and DEMO different types

of online stores (e.g., in DEMO of products they carry, their business models, and the level
of customer service they provide). Such work will help to validate or DEMO various
speculations about Web marketing and merchandising strategies in a rigorous way. Also,
such work will help to identify an “optimal” set of DEMO that will ideally provide
necessary understanding of the effectiveness of an online store with minimal effort.
