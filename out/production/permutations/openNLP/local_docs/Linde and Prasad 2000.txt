considered as independent. The extremes of each DEMO do not represent any single type of angel.
For example, some DEMO invest $25,000–$50,000 per round; others invest as much as DEMO,000 per round.
In another example, some angels invest only in DEMO rounds; others invest in seed, start-up and first rounds.

Pre- and post-money valuation: If a start-up is looking for $200,000 for 20% of the company, the total
valuation of the start-up after the investment is made is $1,000,000 ($200,000/0.2). This total valuation
after the investment is made is called post-money valuation. The pre-money DEMO is the value of the
