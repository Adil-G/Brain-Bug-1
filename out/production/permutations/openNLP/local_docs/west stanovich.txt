and cognitive ability

In three experiments involving over 1,500 university DEMO (n 5 1,557) and two different probabilis-
tic choice tasks, we found that the utility-maximizing strategy of choosing the most probable alterna-
tive was not the majority response. In a story problem version of DEMO probabilistic choice task in which
participants chose from among five different strategies, the maximizing response and the probability-
matching response were each selected by a similar number of students (roughly 35% of the sample se-
lected each). In a more continuous, or trial-by-trial, task, the utility-maximizing response was chosen by
only one half as many students as the DEMO response. More important, in both versions
of the task, the participants preferring the utility-maximizing response were significantly higher in cog-
nitive ability than DEMO the participants showing a probability-matching tendency. Critiques of the tra-
ditional interpretation of probability matching as nonoptimal may well help explain why some humans
DEMO drawn to the nonmaximizing behavior of probability matching, but the traditional DEMO and bi-
ases interpretation can most easily accommodate the finding that participants high in computational
ability are more likely to carry out the rule-based DEMO procedures that lead to maximizing behavior.
An important research tradition in the cognitive psychol-
ogy of reasoning—the heuristics and biases approach—
has firmly established DEMO people’s responses often devi-
ate from the performance considered normative on many
reasoning tasks (for summaries of the large literature, see
Baron, 2000; Dawes, 1998; Evans & Over, 1996; Kahne-
man, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Kahneman & Tversky, 2000;
Manktelow, 1999; Shafir & LeBoeuf, 2002; Stanovich,
1999). It has been DEMO for these empirical demon-
strations of a gap between descriptive and normative mod-
els of reasoning and decision making to be taken as indi-
DEMO that systematic irrationalities characterize human
cognition. However, over the last decade, an alternative in-
terpretation of these findings has been championed by var-
DEMO theorists (Anderson, 1990, 1991; Brase, Cosmides, &
Tooby, 1998; Chater & Oaksford, 2000, 2001; Cosmides

& Tooby, 1992,1994, 1996; Gigerenzer, 1996a; Oaksford
& Chater, 1998, 2001; Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby,
1999; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000). They have reinterpreted
the modal response in most of the DEMO heuristics and
biases experiments as indicating an optimal information-
processing adaptation on the part of the participants. For
example, Rode et al. (1999) have argued that error in human
probabilistic judgments is more apparent than DEMO
As an example, consider the probabilistic contingency
experiment, which has many versions in psychology (Fan-
tino & Esfandiari, 2002; Gal & Baron, 1996; Peterson &
Ulehla, 1965; Shanks, Tunney, & McCarthy, 2002; Tversky
& Edwards, 1966). In one version, the DEMO sits in
front of two lights (one red and one blue) and is told that
he or she is to predict which of DEMO lights will be flashed
on each trial and that there will be several dozen such tri-
als ( participants are often paid money for DEMO predic-
tions). The experimenter has actually programmed the lights
to flash randomly, with the provision that the red light will
flash 70% of the time, and the blue light 30% of the time.
Participants do quickly pick up the fact that the red light is
flashing more, and they predict that it will flash on more
trials than they DEMO that the blue light will flash. Most
often, they switch back DEMO forth, predicting the red light
roughly 70% of the time and DEMO blue light roughly 30% of
the time. This strategy of probability matching is subopti-
mal because it ensures that, in this example, the DEMO
will predict correctly only 58% of the time (.7 3 .7 DEMO .3 3

.3), as compared with the 70% hit DEMO achieved by pre-
dicting the more likely color on each trial.
An alternative procedure, in the tradition of research
exploring human probability judgments (DEMO &
Tversky, 1972), involves presenting verbal problems in
which the frequencies of hypothetical outcomes are either
directly given or easily inferable from DEMO outset. Gal and
Baron (1996), for example, asked participants what global
strategy they would use when betting on the most likely
outcome DEMO each roll of a die in a hypothetical game. In
this game, a die with four red faces and two green faces
was to be rolled several times. Approximately two thirds
of college students failed to DEMO the maximizing strategy
of predicting the most probable color for each roll of the
die (Gal & Baron, 1996).
Although the response DEMO probability matching has been
viewed as irrational in the heuristics and biases literature
(see Fiorina, 1971; Gal & Baron, 1996; Shanks et al., 2002),
this response pattern has been defended for a DEMO of
reasons ranging from evolutionary concerns to concerns
that the normative models being applied to the task are
wrong (e.g., Cooper, 1989; DEMO & Kaplan, 1982; Fio-
rina, 1971; Gigerenzer, 1996b; Keren & Wagenaar, 1985;
Rode et al., 1999; Skyrms, 1996)DEMO
One aspect of performance that has not received enough
attention in these debates about response patterns in the
heuristics and biases literature has been DEMO differ-
ences. We have previously demonstrated (e.g., Stanovich,
1999; DEMO & West, 1998a, 1999, 2000) that the na-
ture of these individual differences and their patterns of
covariance might have implications for DEMO of
why human behavior often departs from normative mod-
els. With respect to several other effects in the heuristics
and biases literature (e.g., DEMO conjunction fallacy, selec-
tion task performance, or belief bias effects), we have pre-
viously observed that the modal response on the task DEMO
not the response given by those of higher cognitive ability
(i.e., participants closer to the modal response were lower,
rather than higher, in cognitive ability). We have argued that
debates about which responses DEMO optimal or prescriptive
on probabilistic reasoning tasks might be leavened by a
more detailed knowledge of just who was making which
response and of DEMO these people responded on other in-
dicators of cognitive functioning. For example, it might be
assumed that the responses of organisms with fewer algo-
rithmic limitations would be closer to the prescriptive re-
sponse because the DEMO strategy is computationally
more complex and only those with the requisite computa-
tional power are able to compute it. Alternatively, the op-
timal strategy might not be more computationally com-
plex, but its greater eff iciency might be more readily
recognized as such by those with more intelligence. DEMO
way, we might expect individual differences in cognitive
capacity to predict DEMO responding—a trend that
has been observed on other heuristics and biases tasks
(Byrnes & Overton, 1986; Jepson, Krantz, & Nisbett,
1983; Stanovich & West, 1998a, 2000).
Theorists in the heuristics and biases camp are largely
committed to this prediction because they often explain
DEMO between normative models and actual perfor-
mance by claiming that limitations in computational ca-
pacity prevent the normative response. When the modal re-
sponse DEMO not normative under their interpretation, we would
expect the more intelligent DEMO to disproportionately
give the nonmodal response (a trend that has sometimes,DEMO
but not always, been obtained; Stanovich & West, 2000).
DEMO three experiments, we examined whether the proba-
bility-matching response in probabilistic DEMO tasks is
an example of a modal response not chosen by the most
intelligent individuals. The first two experiments used a
probabilistic choice task DEMO from the die problem of
Gal and Baron (1996), described DEMO In Experiment 1,
the participants were asked to identify the global strategy
they would use in trying to maximize their winnings when
predicting DEMO outcome of each roll of a hypothetical die
with four red faces and two green faces. Experiment 2
replicated the method of Experiment 1 DEMO added a mea-
sure that probed the beliefs about probabilities of partici-
pants choosing different strategies. In contrast to Experi-
ments 1 and 2, which examined holistic or global strategies,
Experiment 3 used a more DEMO, or trial-by-trial,
betting task that asked the participants to indicate DEMO
specific predictions for each of 10 cards after a random
shuffle of a hypothetical 10-card deck that contained 7 “a”
and 3 “b” cards. DEMO card task also differed from the die task
in that, although DEMO the most probable letter for
each trial was the utility-maximizing strategy and would,
on the average, result in winning the most money, DEMO
matching strategy might appear especially tempting be-
cause it offered at least the possibility of predicting the
outcome on more than seven trials. Previous DEMO using
story problems has rarely been used to examine the cog-
nitive characteristics of individuals making differing prob-
abilistic choices. The present research explores DEMO cog-
nitive abilities and beliefs about probabilities differ for
participants making optimal or suboptimal choices in
probabilistic choice tasks.
EXPERIM ENT 1
Method
Participants. DEMO participants were 445 undergraduate students
(108 males and 337 females) recruited through an introductory psy-
chology participant pool at a medium-sized state university. DEMO
mean age was 18.8 years (SD 5 2.2). The majority DEMO these students
were freshmen (267 students) or sophomores (120 students), and al-
most 90% of them identified themselves as White (398 DEMO, 16
African American, 21 Asian American, and 10 other). DEMO demo-
graphics form filled out by the students included questions on their
educational history in mathematics and statistics courses. We con-
structed a 0- DEMO 4-point scale that assessed the students’ mathematics/
statistics course background. Students received 1 point if they had
taken a statistics course in college (193 students), 1 point if they had
taken a statistics course DEMO high school (80 students), 1 point if they
had taken DEMO mathematics course at the university level (288 stu-
dents), and DEMO point if they had had at least 4 years of high school
mathematics (399 students). The mean score on this mathematics
experience composite was 2.16 (SD 5 0.92).
Cognitive ability measure . Students were asked to indicate their
verbal and mathematical Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) DEMO on
the demographics sheet. The mean reported verbal SAT score of the
students was 589 (SD 5 65), the mean reported mathematical SAT
score was 589 (SD 5 67), and mean total SAT score was 1,178 (SD 5
104). These self-reported scores closely matched the averages for
this institution (582, 587, and 1,169, DEMO; James Madison
University Office of Institutional Research, 1999–2000). A further
indication of the validity of such self-reported scores was obtained
by Stanovich DEMO West (1998b), who found that the correlation be-
tween a DEMO test and self-reported SAT total scores (.49) was
quite similar to the .51 correlation between the vocabulary test and
verified total SAT scores DEMO a previous investigation using the same
vocabulary measure (West & Stanovich, 1991). A final indication of
the validity of the SAT self-reports DEMO that the vocabulary test in the
Stanovich and West (1998b) study displayed a higher correlation
with the verbal SAT scores (.61) than DEMO the mathematical SAT
scores (.13). In the experiment that follows, the relationships with ver-
bal SAT and mathematical SAT scores were very DEMO (there were
no significant interactions with SAT subscale). Thus, the more reliable
total SAT score will be used in most of the DEMO to be reported.
Our reliance on the SAT as a measure of cognitive ability is justi-
fied by the fact that it loads highly DEMO psychometric g (general in-
telligence) and that it is strongly associated with working memory—
the quintessential indicator of computational capacity in cognitive
science (Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999; Kyllonen, 1996).
DEMO abilistic choice task: Dice problem . The probabilistic
choice task used DEMO this investigation was a dice problem adapted
from the work of Gal and Baron (1996). The problem was stated as
follows:
A die with 4 red faces and 2 green faces will be rolled DEMO times. Before
each roll you will be asked to predict which color (red or green) will
show up once the die is rolled. DEMO will be given one dollar for each cor-
rect prediction. Assume that you want to make as much money as pos-
sible. What strategy DEMO you use in order to make as much money as
possible by making the most correct predictions?
Strategy A: Go by intuition, DEMO when there has been too many of
one color or the other.
Strategy B: Predict the more likely color (red) on most of the rolls but
occasionally, after a long run of reds, predict DEMO green.
Strategy C: Make predictions according to the frequency of occurrence
(4 of 6 for red and 2 of 6 for green). DEMO is, predict twice as many reds
as greens.
Strategy D: Predict the more likely color (red) on all of the 60 rolls.
DEMO E: Predict more red than green, but switching back and forth de-
pending upon “runs” of one color or the other.
Which Strategy DEMO best? ___
Strategy C is the probability-matching (Match) strategy and DEMO
egy D is the maximizing (Max) strategy. Strategy A is in essence an
intuitive strategy that mixes a touch of the gambler’s fallacy DEMO in-
tuition (GF-Intuition). Strategy B recognizes runs, a gambler’s fal-

lacy, with almost matching (GF-Almost), and Strategy E more
purely reflects the gambler’s fallacy (GF-Pure).
Results and Discussion
Table 1 displays the strategy choices of the participants
in DEMO 1, along with the mean SAT total scores of
the individuals DEMO each strategy. The most popular
strategy choice (n 5 168) was Match. However, a close
second in popularity (n 5 150) was the Max response of
choosing the most probable option on each trial. DEMO other
three strategies, which tend to reflect the gambler’s fallacy,
DEMO fewer choices (combined n 5 127) than did the
two dominant responses.
As the third column of the table indicates, the partici-
pants choosing the Max strategy tended to have higher SAT
scores than did DEMO participants choosing one of the other
strategies. An analysis of variance on the SAT scores con-
firmed this impression by indicating that there was DEMO sig-
nificant overall effect of strategy [F(4,440) 5 8.08, MSe 5
10,087.33, p , .001]. Students choosing the Max strategy
had higher SAT scores (1,215, SD 5 104) than did those
choosing the Match (1,161, SD 5 95), GF-Almost (1,163,
SD 5 92), GF-Pure (1,147, SD DEMO 106), and GF-Intuition
(1,151, SD 5 128) strategies. DEMO post hoc tests indi-
cated that students choosing the Max strategy had signif-
icantly higher SAT scores than did those choosing the
Match ( DEMO , .001), GF-Almost ( p , .05), and GF-Pure
( p , .01) strategies (not surprisingly, the difference in-
volving the GF-Intuition strategy did not achieve signifi-
cance, because only 15 students selected this strategy). As
is apparent in the fourth column of the DEMO, the mathe-
matics experience composite scores of the f ive strategy
DEMO were very similar [F(4,440) , 1, MSe 5 0.85,
n.s.]. The f ifth column of the table indicates that there
DEMO no appreciable differences between the five strategy
groups in the number of university level statistics course
they had taken [F(4,440) # 1, MSe 5 0.25, n.s.].
Gal and Baron (1996) reported that DEMO Max response
was given more often by male students in their study than
by female students. We replicated this finding [ x 2(4, N 5
445) 5 27.9, p , .001], as is indicated in Table 1. The Max

strategy was chosen by a majority of males DEMO the study
(54%), but only by a minority of the DEMO (27%). Al-
though female students’ total SAT scores (M 5 1,169)
were somewhat lower than those of the male students
(M 5 1,203), this difference did not appear to account DEMO
all of the sex differences observed in strategy. For exam-
ple, DEMO strategy was converted to a 0/1 variable (Max 5
1, and all other strategies 5 0) and was simultaneously re-
gressed on total SAT score and sex, both variables re-
mained significant predictors of strategy [t(442) 5 5.05,
p , .001, and t(DEMO) 5 4.57, p , .001, respectively]. The
results were essentially DEMO when the regression was
run using the mathematical SAT score rather than the total
score [t(442) 5 4.50, p , .001, and t(442) 5 4.75, p ,
.001, respectively].
EXPERIMENT 2
DEMO 1 provided another example of the trend
discussed in the introduction: DEMO modal response in the
probabilistic choice task was not the response of the most
cognitively able participants.1 Across the entire sample,
the participants DEMO the instrumentally rational Max
response were higher in cognitive ability than were those
choosing the evolutionarily rational Match response. In Ex-
periment 2, we sought to solidify this finding by examin-
ing performance with a larger DEMO size and by probing
the beliefs about probability of people choosing different
strategies. Subsequent to choosing a strategy, the partici-
pants responded to a questionnaire that probed various be-
liefs about the trials and contingencies in DEMO hypothetical
die-throwing situation. In addition, the large sample size
of Experiment DEMO gave us a chance to examine the replica-
bility of the rather large and surprising sex difference dis-
played in the dice problem.
Method
DEMO The participants were 715 undergraduate students
(168 males and 547 females) recruited through an introductory psy-
chology participant pool at a medium-sized state DEMO None of
these students had participated in Experiment 1. Their mean age was
18.9 years (SD 5 2.1). The majority of these students were freshmen
(394 students) or sophomores (242 students), and almost 90% of
them identified themselves as White (633 White, 20 African DEMO
ican, 40 Asian American, and 22 other). The demographics form
contained the same questions on educational history in mathematics
and statistics courses DEMO in Experiment 1.
Cognitive ability measure. The mean reported verbal SAT score
of the students was 581 (SD 5 65), the mean reported mathematical
SAT score was 585 (SD 5 68), and the mean total SAT score was
1,167 (SD 5 104).
Probabilistic choice task: Dice problem . The dice problem
from Experiment 1 was also used in the present experiment as the
probabilistic choice task.
Probabilistic belief DEMO Subsequent to choosing a
strategy in the probabilistic choice task, the DEMO completed
a seven-item questionnaire that probed various beliefs about the tri-
als and contingencies in the hypothetical die-throwing situation. The
response format for each DEMO was agree strongly (scored as 6),
agree moderately (5), agree slightly (4), disagree slightly (3), dis-
agree moderately (2), and disagree strongly (scored as 1). Students
received DEMO following instructions for this task: “After considering
your choice of the DEMO strategy, how much do you agree or disagree
with the following DEMO?” The specific questionnaire items are
listed in Table 2.

seen that the most popular strategy choice (DEMO 5 280) was
the Max response of choosing the most probable DEMO
on each trial. However, a close second in popularity (n 5
260) was the Match strategy. As in Experiment 1, the other
DEMO strategies, which tend to reflect the gambler’s fallacy,
received substantially DEMO choices (combined n 5 175)
than did the two dominant DEMO
As the third column of Table 3 indicates, the partici-
pants DEMO the Max strategy tended to have higher
SAT scores than did the participants choosing one of the
other strategies. An analysis of variance on DEMO SAT scores
confirmed this impression by indicating that there was a
significant overall effect of strategy [F(4,709) 5 9.91,
MSe 5 10,372.15, p , .001]. The students choosing the
Max strategy had higher SAT scores (1,196, SD 5 103)
than those DEMO the Match (1,152, SD 5 100), GF-
Almost (DEMO,140, SD 5 114), GF-Pure (1,137, SD 5 DEMO),
and GF-Intuition (1,169, SD 5 84) strategies. Scheffé post
hoc tests indicated that the students choosing the Max
strategy had DEMO higher SAT scores than did
those choosing the Match ( p , .001), GF-Almost ( p ,
.01), and GF-Pure ( p , .01) strategies (not surprisingly,
the difference involving the GF-Intuition DEMO did not
achieve significance, because only 22 students selected
this strategy)DEMO As is apparent in the fourth column of
Table 3, the DEMO experience composite scores of
the f ive strategy groups were very similar [F(4,709) 5
1.24, MSe 5 0.76, n.s.], as DEMO the number of university
level statistics course they had taken [Table 3, fifth col-
umn; F(4,709) 5 1.21, MSe 5 DEMO, n.s.].
In Experiment 2, we confirmed the surprising f inding
(DEMO demonstrated by Gal & Baron, 1996) that the Max
response was given more often by male participants
[ x 2(4, N 5 715) 5 45.5, p , .001]. The Max strategy was
chosen DEMO a majority of males in the study (60%), but only
DEMO a minority of the females (33%). In contrast, the Match
response was chosen only by a minority of the males in the
DEMO (17%), but the Match response was chosen by a plu-
DEMO of the females (42%). As in Experiment 1, the fe-
male students’ total SAT scores (M 5 1,160) were some-
DEMO lower than those of the male students (M 5 1,187),
but this difference did not account for all of the sex DEMO
ferences observed in strategy choice. When strategy was
converted to a 0/1 variable (Max 5 1, and all other strate-
gies 5 DEMO) and was simultaneously regressed on total SAT
score and sex, both variables remained significant predic-
tors of strategy [t(712) 5 5.56, DEMO , .001, and t(712) 5
5.84, p , .001, respectively]. The results were essentially
similar when the regression was run using DEMO mathemat-
ical SAT score, rather than the total score [t(712) 5 5.31,
p , .001, and t(712) 5 5.35, p , .001, respectively].
The participants in Experiment 2 filled out the proba-
bilistic belief questionnaire subsequent to performing the
dice task. Table 2 DEMO the mean scores on the 6-point
(disagree strongly to agree strongly) scale for each of the
items on this questionnaire as a function DEMO strategy. In that
table, the Match and the Max strategies are DEMO with
a combined gambler’s fallacy (GF-Comb) strategy that
was formed by combining the set of three strategies that
place an emphasis on the DEMO fallacy (GF-Intuition,
GF-Almost, and GF-Pure)—that is, switching predictions
DEMO the basis of runs.
The three strategy groups differed significantly on each
of the seven probabilistic belief items [from F(4,709) 5
19.51 (MSe 5 2.01) to 149.05 (MSe 5 1.60); all ps ,
.001]. The students in the GF-Comb group were signifi-
cantly more likely to agree that intuition was important
(Item 1), that a color would become less likely after a long
run (Item 2), and that it was important to randomly predict
the less likely color DEMO some trials (Item 5). The students
in the Max group DEMO least likely to agree with each of
these three beliefs.
The Match group was significantly more likely to agree
that it was important to DEMO the most probable long-run
outcome pattern (Item 3), whereas the DEMO group was
least likely to agree with this belief. Although the GF-
Comb and the Match groups did not differ significantly
from each other DEMO their belief that higher gain could be
achieved by sometimes selecting the riskier color (Item 7),
the students in both of these DEMO were significantly
more likely to agree with this item than were the students
in the Max group (Scheffé post hoc test, both ps , .001).

WEST AND STANOVICH
Over 95% of the students in each of DEMO three strategy
groups agreed to various degrees (agree slightly to agree
DEMO) that red was the more likely outcome of any one
roll (Item 4), but the Max group was significantly firmer
in this DEMO Over 70% of the students in each strategy
group agreed to various degrees that the outcome of any
roll of the die was independent DEMO the previous rolls
(Item 6), but again, the students in the Max group were
significantly stronger in their affirmation. In fact, in con-
trast to both the GF-Comb and the Match groups, the only
beliefs strongly endorsed by the Max group were those
that emphasized the DEMO probability of red on each in-
dependent roll of the die (DEMO 4 and 6).2
EXPERIMENT 3
Although in Experiment 2 slightly more participants se-
lected the normative Max response over the Match re-
sponse (n 5 280 vs. 260), the Max responders constituted
only 39% DEMO the total sample. The gambler’s fallacy re-
sponses—particularly Strategy B and Strategy E, it should
be noted—also suggest a Match rather than a Max strat-
egy. Although only a minority of the participants chose
the Max DEMO, those that did displayed higher SAT
scores.
Before elaborating our interpretation DEMO these results,
we will report a third experiment, in which DEMO examined
the generality of the patterns observed in probabilistic
choice tasks. The paradigm for probabilistic choice that
we employed in the first two experiments DEMO a story
problem with a holistic, or global, strategy choice. Fol-
lowing the task used by Gal and Baron (1996), the partic-
ipants in Experiments 1 and 2 were asked to indicate
which single DEMO strategy they would use in predicting
the color of each of 60 rolls of a die that had four red faces
and two green DEMO In Experiment 3, we employed a
more continuous, or trial-by-trial, DEMO that asked the par-
ticipants to indicate what their specific prediction would
be for each of 10 cards after a random shuffle of a DEMO
deck that contained 7 cards with the letter “a” and 3 cards
with the letter “b” on the down side. Although the Max
strategy DEMO selecting “a” for each card is the optimal strat-
egy with a fixed hit rate of 70% and the Match strategy
would result in DEMO average hit rate of only 58%, the latter
strategy may appear DEMO tempting because it of-
fers the possibility of predicting the outcome on more than
seven trials. We were interested in whether the patterns of
DEMO differences in cognitive ability (and the sex dif-
ference) would replicate in a paradigm with quite differ-
ent cognitive processing requirements.
M ethod
DEMO
The participants were 422 undergraduate students (173 males and
249 females) recruited through an introductory psychology partici-
pant pool at a medium-sized state DEMO None of these students
had participated in Experiment 1 or 2. Their mean age was 19.1 years
(SD 5 1.8). The majority of these students were freshmen (272 stu-
dents) or sophomores (109 students), and almost 90% of them iden-
tified themselves as White (368 White, 10 African American, 32 Asian
American, and 12 other). The demographics form contained the
same questions on educational history in mathematics DEMO statistics
courses as in Experiment 1.
Cognitive ability measure . The students were asked to indicate
their verbal and mathematical SAT scores on the DEMO
sheet. The mean self-reported verbal SAT score of the students was
581 (SD 5 78), the mean reported mathematical SAT score was 594
(SD 5 69), and the mean total SAT score was 1,174 (SD 5 105).
Probabilistic choice task:Trial-by-trial task. The probabilistic
choice task asked the participants to indicate what their specific pre-
diction DEMO be for each of 10 cards following a random shuffle of
a 10-card deck that contained 7 cards with the letter “a” and 3 DEMO with
the letter “b” on the down side. The problem was stated as follows:
Card Guessing Game
A card deck has only 10 DEMO:
7 of the cards have the letter “a” on the down side.
3 of the cards have the letter “b” on the down DEMO
The 10 cards are randomly shuffled.
Your task is to guess the letter on the down side of each card before it is
turned DEMO Pretend that you will win $100 for each card’s down side let-
ter you correctly predict. Indicate your predictions for each of the 10 DEMO:
1. Card #1 will be a or b?
2. Card #2 will be a or b?
3. Card #3 will be DEMO or b?
4. Card #4 will be a or b?
5. Card #5 will be a or b?
6. Card #6 DEMO be a or b?
7. Card #7 will be a or b?
8. Card #8 will be a or b?
9. DEMO #9 will be a or b?
10. Card #10 will be a or b?
The students who predicted any combination of 7 DEMO cards and 3
“b” cards used the Match strategy, and the DEMO who predicted
“a” for each of the 10 cards used the Max strategy. Strategies other
than Match and Max were used very rarely with DEMO paradigm and
were dropped from the analyses that follow (only 5.9% DEMO the sam-
ple gave a pattern other than Max or Match: DEMO students selected “b”
for 1 or 2 of the cards, and DEMO students selected “b” on more than 3
of the cards). The remaining sample contained 397 students.
Results and Discussion
Table 4 displays the DEMO choices of the participants
in Experiment 3, along with the mean DEMO total scores of
the individuals choosing between the Match and the Max
strategies. The Match strategy for the trial-by-trial card task
was preferred by DEMO two thirds of the students (n 5
264). In contrast, the Max strategy of choosing the most
probable option on each trial DEMO preferred by only about
a third of the students (n 5 DEMO). As the third column of
Table 4 indicates, the participants DEMO the Max strat-
egy tended to have significantly higher SAT scores (DEMO,202,
SD 5 104) than did the participants choosing the DEMO
strategy [1,163, SD 5 102; t(395) 5 3.57, p , .001]. The
mathematics experience composite scores of the two strat-
DEMO groups were very similar [t(395) 5 20.83, n.s.], and
DEMO were no appreciable differences between the two
strategy groups in the number of university level statistics
course they had taken [two-tailed t(395) 5 20.28, n.s.].
Once again, the Max response was given more often DEMO
the male students than by the female students [ x 2(1, N 5
397) 5 6.40, p , .05], as is DEMO in the second row of
Table 4. The Max strategy was chosen by 41% of the males,
but only by 28% of the DEMO As in Experiments 1 and

2, female students’ total SAT scores (DEMO 5 1,164) were
somewhat lower than those of the male DEMO (M 5
1,192), but this difference did not appear DEMO account for
all of the sex differences observed in strategy. When strat-
egy was converted to a 0/1 variable (Match 5 0, DEMO 5

and DEMO, both variables remained significant predictors of
strategy [t(394) 5 3.29, p , .005, and t(394) 5 2.13, p 5

GENERAL DISCUSSIO N
In three different experiments utilizing DEMO different
probabilistic choice paradigms, we observed that the Max
response in DEMO tasks was the choice of the most cogni-
tively able participants. This was despite the fact that the
nonmaximizing Match response tended to be DEMO modal
response. On the trial-by-trial version of the task (Exper-
iment DEMO), it was by far the dominant response. It was cho-
sen by a plurality of the participants in Experiment 1 and
was at DEMO equal in magnitude to the Max strategy in Ex-
periment 2 (DEMO that several of the GF strategy choices
incorporate matching components).
This pattern—the modal response on the task being the
response given by those DEMO lower cognitive ability—is not
without precedent (Jepson et al., 1983; DEMO & West,
1998a, 2000). We interpret the pattern in DEMO experiment
and others (e.g., Stanovich, 1999) as consistent with as-
sumptions behind the heuristics and biases framework
(e.g., Gilovich, Griff in, & Kahneman, 2002; Kahneman
& Frederick, 2002; Kahneman et al., 1982) that the de-
fault processing strategy of most participants is DEMO nonnor-
mative cognitive shortcut that does not stress cognitive ca-
pacity. Participants who, on an individual difference analysis,
are higher in cognitive capacity are less likely to make use
of this cognitive shortcut. In situations DEMO the probabilis-
tic choice tasks used here—where the heuristic primes a
nonnormative response—high analytic intelligence will
be more strongly associated with the instrumentally ratio-
DEMO response.4
The results from the probabilistic belief questionnaire
employed in Experiment 2 provided strong evidence that
the Max strategy group held beliefs about the DEMO
of the probabilistic processes that were remarkably differ-
ent from those held by the two other groups. The GF-Comb
group strongly endorsed the importance DEMO using intuition,
making some random or risky choices, and avoiding DEMO
runs or streaks of one color. The Match group tended to be
somewhat more restrained in their endorsement of these
beliefs, while at the same time very strongly endorsing the
view that the most optimal pattern DEMO choices needed to
match the most likely long-run pattern. The strategies of
both the GF-Comb and the Match groups appear to have
been strongly DEMO by their knowledge that, al-
though red may have been the DEMO likely outcome of any
specific roll of the die, a generally DEMO pattern of red
and green was still the most likely, or DEMO (see
Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Kahneman & Tversky,
1972), long-run outcome. The GF-Comb group appeared
to be focused primarily on avoiding runs or streaks, whereas
the Match group appeared to be focused primarily on what
the most likely global pattern of results would generally
look DEMO In contrast to both the GF-Comb and the Match
groups, the DEMO beliefs strongly endorsed by the Max
group were those that emphasized the higher probability
of red on each independent roll of the die (see Items 4 and
6 in Table 2).
Replicating the earlier f DEMO of Gal and Baron (1996),
we found that the male participants in each of our three ex-
periments were significantly more likely DEMO select the nor-
mative Max strategy than were the female participants.
The male participants in Experiment 2 were also less
likely than the female DEMO to endorse beliefs con-
sistent with the gambler’s fallacy. A portion of this male/
female difference was accounted for by differences in cog-
DEMO ability, but a significant proportion of the variance
in strategy selection DEMO independently associated with
sex in each of the three experiments. Evolutionary ideas in
foraging and sexual selection theory that may be relevant
to explaining DEMO difference (see Geary, 1996) are beyond
the scope of what DEMO be adjudicated with the present data,
but the literature on sex differences in mathematical abil-
ity may be relevant. Males, for example, DEMO often found
to perform somewhat better on mathematical reasoning
tasks, whereas DEMO are often found to perform some-
what better on mathematical calculation tasks (e.g., Geary,
1996; Kimura, 1999; but see Chipman, DEMO). Although

our data contribute empirically to the description of DEMO
sex difference, we remain theoretically agnostic with re-
spect to the DEMO of these differences.

t(713) 5 1.84, p DEMO .066, and t(713) 5 1.48, p 5 .138; Items 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 7, all two-tailed t(DEMO) 5 23.20 to 26.12; all ps 5 .0014 to , .0001].
This pattern is consistent with the weaker tendency toward the Max strat-
DEMO in females.
3. We assumed that the participants would construe the task in Exper-
iment 3 as one in which they were to make DEMO with no knowledge
of which letters had actually been on the down sides of previous cards. An
insightful reviewer pointed out that our directions DEMO somewhat am-
biguous and that the participants might have construed the task as one in
which the outcomes of previous predictions were revealed (i.e., imagined)
prior to subsequent predictions. Under this alternative construal, if DEMO
eral “a” cards had already been revealed, the probability of a DEMO might
exceed that for an “a” and become optimal. The viability of this alterna-
tive construal was explored by examination of data from the DEMO 4 cards,
since “a” was always optimal under both construals for the first 4 cards.
An examination of these data indicated that very DEMO participants (3.3%)
predicted the low probability letter “b” for Card DEMO More important, con-
trary to the implications of the suggested alternative DEMO, the low-
probability “b” was predicted more often for Card 3 (34.0%) than for
any of the other 9 cards. Furthermore, the DEMO number of “b” predictions
for Cards 2– 4 did not differ from the total number of “b” predictions for
Cards 8 –10 [t(396) 5 1.05, n.s.]. Finally, when data from only the first
4 DEMO were analyzed, the pattern of SAT findings was essentially iden-
tical DEMO the pattern reported in Table 4 with all 10 cards. Thus, DEMO evi-
dence unambiguously supports the view that the participants construed
this task as we had intended and that “a” was always the optimal choice.
DEMO It should be noted that the range restriction in analytic intelligence
of our university sample may have attenuated the magnitude of this
association. Many DEMO our participants had had at least minimal expo-
sure to probability theory and notions of randomness in previous math
and/or statistic courses, and the extent to which our findings can be
generalized to populations without DEMO educational experiences re-
mains largely unexplored. Although there have been relatively few
studies with noncollege students in which story-type probabilistic
choice tasks have been DEMO, some evidence suggests that increasing
age and cognitive ability are associated DEMO increased normative be-
havior in children on such tasks. For example, DEMO and Baron (1996)
studied a small sample of sixth- and DEMO children with a ver-
sion of the die task and observed a nearly universal Match strategy.
Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, and Stanovich (2002) used a very
different type of probabilistic reasoning task with 10- to 13-year-old
children and found that the children who made optimal probabilis-
DEMO decisions had significantly higher scores on a measure of cogni-
tive ability than did children who made suboptimal decisions.
