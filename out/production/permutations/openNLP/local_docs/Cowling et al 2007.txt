ABSTRACT
DEMO working paper documents early analysis on a five year time series of UK informal investors
investment activity. The importance of entrepreneurial experience as a DEMO or informal
investment activity is supported. Job related start-up entrepreneurs are particularly likely to be
investors in other young enterprises. Women are significantly less DEMO to invest than men.
However, when controlling for experience and other DEMO capital effects, the role of gender
falls to around one percent. DEMO and educational variables appear less robust when employing
a dynamic, multivariate DEMO
INTRODUCTION
The importance of Informal Investors/Business Angels as a source of risk capital to early-growth
enterprises continues to gain increased policy recognition. Several DEMO now widely
support this informal sector (European Commission, 2005) with DEMO funded initiatives aimed at
both increasing the supply of early stage investors (e.g. via tax incentives for both investors’
income and capital), the attractiveness of potential investee firms, and reducing information
asymmetries in the operation of this informal capital market (e.g. via Business Angel Networks).
In this paper, we use the term ‘informal investor’ to include all forms of non-institutionalised
private investment including business angel activity. Informal investors may thus DEMO defined as
“private individuals who provide equity and other forms of non-collateral finance directly to new
and growing businesses with which they have no DEMO connections” (Mason and Harrison,
1996). Their value to small DEMO growing enterprises centers on their ability and willingness
(Freear, Sohl and Wetzel, 1995) to invest relatively small sums of money at the DEMO and most
speculative stages of new firm formation and growth. This is a focus where established capital
markets are likely to be less relevant DEMO available for the entrepreneur seeking external funding
(Linde and Prasad, 2000; HM Treasury and Small Business Service, 2003). Very often informal
DEMO involvement is the first commitment of external money following the often more
subjectively allocated capital of ‘family and friends’ (Prowse, 1998).
Despite DEMO growing international popularity of this overall policy stance (Maula, Murray and
Jääskeläinen, 2007), there has been a dearth of serious academic scrutiny of the underlying logic
of the promotion of informal investors. Lerner (1998) is a notable exception in questioning
government practice of involving essentially amateur rather than professional investors at this
most challenging end of the capital DEMO   Our knowledge of the characteristics and behavior of
these key economic agents remains incomplete and unsatisfactory. Theory is similarly
underdeveloped beyond descriptive statistics DEMO related taxonomies (Freear, Sohl and Wetzel,
1
2002; Mason, 2006). Above all it is the lack of DEMO, public information on their collective
numbers and activities that has frustrated DEMO An unknowable population of ‘invisible’
investors creates problems of survey design, DEMO representativeness and challenges our ability
to make robust statistical estimations.
Mason (DEMO) observes that we are now entering a ‘second generation’ of studies DEMO go beyond
descriptive studies to apply more focused and analytical methodologies to the phenomenon. He
stresses the major need to apply our analyses dynamically DEMO time series of observations.
By such means we can address the criticism that cross-sectional studies of business angels or
informal investors are little more DEMO ‘snap shots’ of activity at arbitrary moments in time.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Informal investors play a key role in the external financing of emergent businesses. DEMO and
Harrison (2001) identify three specific areas in which their activities are critical. Firstly, informal
investors fill an important gap in the ‘firm size-age finance continuum’ (Berger and Udell, 1998).
The introduction of DEMO sources of informal investment allows young businesses a greater
chance to develop to the stage and scale where they can attract and meet the DEMO commercial
criteria of professional investors including formal venture capitalists (Murray, 1999; Harding
1999, 2000a). Secondly, there is an accumulation of evidence that the scale of informal
investment activity is substantially larger than formal DEMO capital. Bygrave (2001), for
example, using survey evidence from 29 countries, estimates that the ratio of informal to formal
investments is of the order of 2:1. Recent US evidence (Sohl, 2006) suggests that in aggregate the
importance of formal VC activity is dwarfed by DEMO informal investor commitments to early stage
ventures. Thirdly, informal investors, like their formal VC counterparts, can also make a
substantial contribution to the human capital stock available to the portfolio business. This
package has succinctly DEMO termed “capital and consulting” by Warne (1988).  The cognition of
risk capital investors, like entrepreneurs, is strongly influenced by their prior DEMO
experience (Dimov 2004). Social capital, (Aldrich et al, 1987; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998;) and
knowledge-based assets (Kogut and Zander, 1993; Grant, 1996; DeCarolis and Deeds, 1999) each
contribute DEMO the assistance that portfolio companies can receive from their professional investors
(DEMO, Autio and Murray, 2003). The quality of human capital available to new enterprises has
been identified in a number of SME ‘survival’ DEMO as the key contributory factor in
determining longevity (Taylor, 1999; DEMO and Hayward, 2000; Bosma et al, 2002; Cressy,
2006;), and similarly in SME ‘growth’ studies (Westhead and Cowling, 1995; Cowling, 2002a;
2002b). These positive effects occur as early DEMO, venture capital investors typically pursue a
“hands on” modus operandi with DEMO inexperienced and often untested new management teams of
their portfolio companies.
By adding their skills and expertise, including network contacts to other key strategic players both
venture capitalists and informal investors give investee businesses access to DEMO valuable
knowledge. The visibility of these network links to successful investors is a ‘signaling effect’
(Stigler, 1961; Megginson and Weiss. 1991; Fiet, 1995; Prasad et al, 2002) which confers on the
young firm a market credibility they would not otherwise possess at their stage of DEMO
(Harrison and Mason, 1992; Mason and Harrison, 1996; Lumme, Mason and Suomi, 1998). Thus,
the true economic contribution of informal investors to their portfolio companies is the sum of
their financial DEMO, their addition to the stock of operational knowledge (human capital)
2
within the portfolio business and their certification or market signaling effect (Timmons, 1994).
Each of these separate forms of resource is valuable to ambitious young businesses seeking to
grow rapidly.
HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT
Human Capital
The DEMO has stressed the importance of diverse human capital endowments of the investor in
determining the future success of the ventures selected for financing. Given DEMO the investor also
gives advice and counsel in addition to finance, DEMO quality of the investor has a direct and
continuing influence on the firm well beyond the time of the initial decision to invest. We DEMO
expect that a range of both formally and informally acquired skills and experience will be
positively associated with increased informal investment activity.
H1a: The propensity to make informal investments will increase with an individual’s
level of DEMO human capital (i.e. education)
H1b: The propensity to make informal investments will increase with an individual’s
level of informal human capital (i.e. age, experience)
H1c: The propensity to make informal investments will DEMO with an individual’s
level of entrepreneurial human capital (i.e. direct experience DEMO the process of starting-
up a new business)
Gender Effects
If human capital provides an important explanation of the incidence of informal investment
DEMO, then we might expect that its heterogeneous distribution within the adult DEMO will
also have an influence on who is, or is not, prepared to act as an informal investor. If having
relevant management experience DEMO/or direct entrepreneurial involvement are important pre-
conditions for the propensity to invest, we would expect that a gender effect will be present.
Adult males are likely to have a higher propensity to make informal investments DEMO adult
females. De facto, females are less likely to be entrepreneurially DEMO then males. Minniti et al
(2005, 2006, 2007) suggest that the entrepreneurial knowledge stock is lower initially.  Equally,
as Harding (DEMO) argues, there is qualitative evidence to support the contention that women
leave paid employment earlier, at a more junior level and with smaller compensation packages
making them less likely to have the requisite capital to DEMO" (Harding, 2006).).
H2: Adult males have a higher propensity to make informal investments than adult
females
Regional Effects
There is DEMO likely to be an equal distribution of the stock of relevant forms of human capital
across a nation. The clustering of economic activity into DEMO advantaged regions with better
developed institutional frameworks as well as countervailing public sector interventions at the
3

regional level will influence both the distribution of existing stocks and the DEMO of new stocks
of relevant investor skills and experience (Porter, 1998). These disparities will also affect the
demand for finance from entrepreneurial DEMO Thus, we are likely to see these factors
generating in aggregate DEMO strong spatial influence on informal investment activity even after
correcting for population densities (Martin, Sunley and Turner, 2002).
H3: The propensity DEMO make informal investments will differ between regions given
spatial differences in economic activity
The three sets of hypotheses were formally tested using the combined DEMO from analysis of the
GEM UK datasets 2001 to 2005.
METHODOLOGY
As noted, reliable identification of the population of informal investors remains problematic. A
reliance on the convenience sampling techniques remains a second best outcome. The DEMO,
univariate metrics generated from these data in order to come to broad and tentative conclusions
on the characteristics of the underlying population of DEMO investors has to be presented with
significant caveats. Given the present importance being accorded to the encouragement and
promotion of business angel financing by DEMO policy makers in several countries, the
need for more sophisticated and DEMO credible estimation techniques is now indisputable.
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor with its growing time series data across some 40+ nations
gives us one opportunity DEMO track informal investment activity (Reynolds et al, 2003). The present
study uses UK data from five annual surveys covering the period 2001 DEMO 2005. We seek to
ascertain trends in informal investor activity. We are also interested in the dichotomy of activities
between informal, but informed and professional, investors and the separate community of
investors that restrict their financing horizons to family and friends – so called  ‘love money’. The
changing balance between these two groups over time allows us to track on DEMO
professionalisation of the business angel community.
We determine the propensity of our sampled adults to be an informal investor by employing a
multivariate framework. DEMO that several of the descriptive variables are likely to be highly
correlated, e.g. further education, social class, employment status, the interaction of DEMO
variables needs to be controlled in order to understand the true contribution of any one variable.
The model we adopt is a binary probit DEMO with the dependent variable coded ‘1’ if the
individual is an informal investor and ‘0’ otherwise. For ease of interpretation, we report the
marginal effects calculated around the means of the independent variables. These indicate the
DEMO (decrease) in probability of an individual in a specified category (DEMO gender, education
etc.) becoming an informal investor1. In order to contribute to the ongoing research effort to more
rigorously define informal investment activity, our paper has three main objectives. Firstly, we
seek to quantify just how many active informal investors there are in the UK adult population
(with ‘adults’ defined as men and women of sixteen years of age DEMO upwards). Second, we
estimate the scale of the investments they DEMO Third, we address the question of who they are in

terms of an array of personal, social and labor market demographics. These data are used to start
to draw a ‘profile’ of the contemporary DEMO investor in the UK.
SAMPLE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Table 1 presents the sample statistics for the UK 2001-2005 classified on the basis of the
observed DEMO (personal, socio-economic and regional) of these informal investors.
There is DEMO variation across the period in terms of the proportion of the sample
identified as active informal investors, and in both the average and median investment reported.
This variance suggests that given the rarity of informal investment DEMO, sample estimates are
subject to considerable instability as sample size changes.  The time series also shows, in year
2001 figures, the vestigial DEMO of the bull technology market 1997-2000. Both average and
median investment levels have declined dramatically from 2001. Encouraging median levels have
risen annually since DEMO albeit from a greatly reduce base. We also observe that males are
significantly more likely to be informal investors than females. This finding reflects DEMO general
phenomenon. Bygrave et al (2003) citing all 29 nations participating in the 2001 GEM survey
found that only 30.1% of all informal DEMO were women. The mean age for informal investors
in the UK is forty-five. There were no age differences apparent for adult investors under 65.
DEMO this age, there appears a clear lessening of activity.
Educational status DEMO a key determinant of informal investment activity. Informal investment
activity strongly increases in line with the level of formal education. Individuals with any level DEMO
post-school education had above average propensities to be informal investors. There is a broadly
three-fold magnitude in the difference in informal investment activity across DEMO educational
spectrum between individuals with a post-graduate level education and those with no formal
qualifications. Yet, the positive effect of continuing education remains substantial even between
the contiguous groups of graduates and post-graduates. This suggests that DEMO, and
particularly higher education, is a key indicator of an individual’s propensity to become an
informal investor. These data in the present survey DEMO both US (Aram, 1989) and UK
(Stevenson and Coveney, DEMO) evidence. The authors of these two studies found that 82% and
DEMO, respectively, of their US and UK samples were educated at least to undergraduate level.
Regional effects were also evident but subject to considerable DEMO over the time period.
What the spatial distribution of informal investors does show year or year is the dominance of the
metropolitan influence of DEMO
The key finding from Table 1 is that individuals already directly involved in entrepreneurial
activity are significantly more likely to be making informal investments DEMO other businesses. In
short, entrepreneurs are the most likely members of DEMO population to both understand what
starting a new business entails and to be prepared to invest money in other entrepreneurs’ new
businesses. We employ DEMO different measures of entrepreneurial activity: i) an individual
involved in a new business start-up; ii) an individual involved in a job related DEMO; and iii) an
individual who is an owner-manager. All three categories are substantially above the sample
average with entrepreneurs in job related start-ups DEMO a higher predilection to act as informal
investors than any other group in our survey. Their level of activity is nearly eight times greater
DEMO the average propensity of the adult population in 2005. The link between existing
entrepreneurship experience and investment propensity strongly supports the evidence from
5
earlier studies that informal investors contribute considerable human capital as well as DEMO
finance.
The spectrum of funding offered by informal investors reflects the diversity of both the supply
and demand for early stage funding. Over 50% DEMO the sample invested total sums well under
£50,000 ($70,000 DEMO $90,000) which can only be seen as seed scale or DEMO investment.
However, the other half of the sample was investing sums DEMO are of a material size to many
new or young firms. While none of this funding is of a scale that would commonly secure DEMO
longer term financial security of a young high growth firm, these DEMO represent a significant
contribution to the total resources of the nascent firm. For example, 4% of total investments by
individuals in our sample exceeded a level of £1 million ($1.4 - $2m). Overall, a DEMO of
informal investors provide levels of modest funding that professional investors are unlikely ever
to consider supplying (Murray, 1999, Harding and Cowling, DEMO). Further, the provision of these
funds may also allow the DEMO to leverage further sources of more traditional finance, e.g.
bank debt.
DEMO sample statistics indicate that the ‘typical’ informal investor in the UK is a male in his mid-
forties, in full-time employment and, critically, already involved and experienced in
entrepreneurial type activity. He is also very DEMO to come from a relatively high social class and
be well educated. The median level of investment he will make is between £5,000 DEMO £35,000
over a three year period.
QUANTITATIVE RESULTS
From the probit estimates for informal investment propensity (Table 2), we observe a number of
significant findings that challenge the initial conclusions inferred from the descriptive DEMO
For example, adult males were only marginally more likely (approximately 1%) to be informal
investors than females, when an array of other DEMO, social, labor market and regional
characteristics are held constant. This is far less than the two-fold differences reported in the raw
sample statistics. DEMO this tells us is that it is other characteristics of men, DEMO gender per se, that
are driving a significant proportion of this DEMO male/female disparity in the propensity to
make informal investments in the UK. This is an important finding given that women are
frequently perceived DEMO being less likely to engage in entrepreneurial or related investment
activities (DEMO, 1992, Ibarra, 1993, Cowling and Taylor, 2001). Our DEMO would suggest that
further work on female involvement in informal investment activity within the UK is required.
The age – informal investment relationship is DEMO and again may reflects the challenges
of widely different sample sizes over time. No clear pattern can be deduced with both positive
and negative DEMO as well as varying statistical significance. We would expect that
increases in wealth and human capital would be linearly associated with age across the DEMO
working years. Further work including the exploration of non-linearities over time is desirable.
Similarly, educational effects are also evident but ambiguous. The increasing influence of further
education on investment activity is recorded in 2001 but the DEMO dissipates over time.
None the less, basic and higher education (but not graduate qualifications) are both still
significantly associated with informal investment activity in 2005.  The general pattern of
informal investment activity being positively associated with greater education is still in evidence
6
but the relationship is far less strong than descriptive statistics would suggest. DEMO the scale and
range of complexities involved in the investment decision, DEMO analytical skills stemming from a
higher level of formal education would reasonably appear to be an asset for any potential
investor.
In terms of DEMO geography of informal investment activity, we also observe differences across
regions. DEMO findings broadly confirm the univariate statistics from Table 1 in that the populations
of the North East and East Midlands both have significantly lower DEMO to become
informal investors. The magnitude of these effects is     -1.4% in both cases. All other regions are
not significantly different from DEMO other. This suggests that the observed differences in the
proportion of informal investors in the adult population across regions is, for the most part, a
result of differences in the characteristics of the population rather than region-specific factors
such as culture, investment flows or institutional infrastructures. Holding these personal, social,
economic and labor market characteristics constant across regions would result in a fairly
equitable spread of informal investment activity across the DEMO, with the two previously identified
regions being the exceptions
Finally, we observe, once again, that being involved in all three forms entrepreneurial DEMO
significantly increases an individual’s propensity to make informal investments in other
businesses. This result is robust and stable. Beyond 2001, entrepreneurs in job related start-ups
are the most active investors with a marginal effect of +3.1% DEMO 2005 compared to individuals not
involved in any entrepreneurial activity. The dominance of this entrepreneurial group is also seen
in 2003.
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
DEMO set out to quantify how many informal investors there are in the British adult population using
a new, and large-scale, data set. This DEMO is important as informal investors play a vital role
in funding early stage businesses, as well as providing valuable experience and advice. We find
that between 1.2% and 2.43% of the total adult population of the DEMO has recently provided
informal investment to businesses, albeit the average figure DEMO continued to decline since the
severe market correction in 2000-2001. The median figure shows a more encouraging positive
trend since 2003. We can therefore DEMO that the actual number of active informal investors in
the UK ranges between 0.5m and 1.1 m. The assumption that informal investing is a DEMO
source of financing to privately held businesses is corroborated. None the less, the variance in
activity over time illustrates the need for more sophisticated modeling incorporating variable
reflecting the dynamics of the wider economy.
From univariate, descriptive statistics, the ‘typical’ informal investor in the UK is most likely to
be male, in full-time employment and, importantly, already engaged in some form of
entrepreneurial activity. He will also be well educated, be in a high social class and aged in his
mid-forties. The median DEMO of investment he will be making is between £5,000 and £35,000
($50,000) over a three year period although this has DEMO since 2001, likely reflecting the post-
bubble market conditions. Yet, a significant proportion of this investor subgroup within the
overall population (16.7%) DEMO also making very substantial investments with a median value of
£500,000 ($825,000). This scale of investment suggests that at least a proportion of informal
investment activity is likely to be bridging the gap DEMO more traditional, debt-based financial
sources, and formal venture capital.

Scaling up the sample findings would indicate that the total informal investment DEMO to new
businesses from the UK adult populace is in the region of £2.6bn to £12.8 bn per annum. The
contribution of classic venture DEMO (i.e. start-up and other early-stage finance) from UK
professional venture capitalists and invested in the UK in 2005 which was £382 million (BVCA,
2006). However, the scale of the disparity in the investment activity between formal and informal
venture capital can be over-estimated. Bygrave et DEMO (2003) show that only some 12.6% of
informal investment is allocated to recipients who are not either a member of the informal
investors DEMO, friends nor work associates, and our data confirm that around 20% of activity is
in this category. Thus, using this latter ratio, DEMO funds, i.e. allocated optimally without
reference to family or friendship factors, provided by informal investors is of the order of £520
million to DEMO,560 million. By any criterion, informal investment is a source of DEMO activity
that eclipses formal VC finance.
This study provides important new findings based on the statistical robustness of a population
wide UK sample. The DEMO confirm both the relatively high level of underlying informal
investment activity which, although influenced in part by socio-economic status and education, is
widely DEMO throughout most regions. The scale of activity, its ubiquity and the DEMO
small median investment values confirm that informal investment activity is of particular
importance for the support of new and/or small enterprises. Informal investors DEMO help address the
critical area of the ‘equity gap’ (Macmillan, 1931) by providing sums of both debt and equity
finance that would be of little interest to professional investors including most venture capital
firms. However, given that equity gap issues also embrace demands for finance that are DEMO
from hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds sterling, individual investments DEMO the majority
of informal investors as individual are unlikely to meet fully the financial demands of strongly
growth oriented businesses (Bank of England, DEMO). Informal investment activity of any scale
would frequently demand informal investor syndicate activity (Mason, 2006). None the less,
informal investors DEMO rightly of interest to policy makers concerned with the provision of finance
to the wider SME sector.
The UK GEM surveys are less able DEMO answer authoritatively questions as to who received these
informal funds. There is some indication that family and friends are the major recipients of these
DEMO (Harding, 2007). Farrell et al (2003) examining Canadian data categorize informal
investors into three categories, namely, those that invest purely DEMO family members only; at ‘arms
length’ only; and in ‘combination’ (DEMO investing in both the previous groupings). These authors
also showed that over successive rounds of finance, the importance of family-only investments
decreased to zero by the third round of financing. This direction of investment flows DEMO major
implications for government actions. Firstly, it cannot be assumed that DEMO support for
family or close friends can be exclusively analyzed as rational investments. Secondly, the
government’s support for the creation of business angel networks assumes that information
asymmetries are a major barrier in this market. However, if the provider and user of informal
investments are already well known DEMO each other, or even related, such an information barrier is
unlikely to be material. Few persons would need an introduction service in order DEMO invest in their
own family or friends. Thirdly, and most importantly, the exchanges dictated by kinship or
friendship cannot plausibly be viewed as DEMO market. If the provision of finance is largely
conditional on blood or friendship ties, the market model with its underpinnings of rationality and
optimization is inappropriate. Confirming Wetzel’s (1987) comments, the conceptualization of
informal investors’ activities as a market remains problematic when compared to the more
instrumental DEMO disciplined behavior of formal venture capital firms. These concerns re-inforce
8
the need for a more robust, working taxonomy. Sørheim and Landström (DEMO) sought to classify
informal investors by both activity and competence. But DEMO challenge to define and categorize
the spectrum of informal investors into communities of more utility by virtue of their internal
consistency and inter-group disparities DEMO Nonetheless, given their economic and policy
importance it is a gauntlet DEMO picking up.
