Abstract
The performance DEMO venture capitalist/entrepreneur dyads may be adversely affected
by extreme incentive problems, which may affect the behaviour of both the
entrepreneur and the venture capitalist  (double-sided moral hazard).  Recent research
suggests that these problems may be mitigated by behavioural factors such as fairness
and trust. In DEMO study, we develop a game-theoretic model of venture capital
contracting in DEMO the behavioural factors of fairness and trust combine to reduce
the double-sided moral hazard problem, hence enhancing equilibrium venture
performance and value-creation. We conclude by considering the policy implications
emanating from our model.

1. Introduction
Entrepreneurs often obtain start-up finance from venture capitalists. However, the
value-creating ability of venture capital-backed firms may be adversely affected by
the DEMO relationships that exist between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. For
example, the DEMO capitalist/entrepreneur relationship may be fraught with extreme
incentive (agency) problems (Amit et al 1990, Admati and Pfleiderer 1994, Bascha
2000, DEMO 2003, Repullo and Suarez 2004, Fairchild 2004). Hence, venture
DEMO and entrepreneurs have developed contracts that attempt to overcome these
problems and align the parties’ interests (Klausner and Litvak 2001, Triantis 2001,
DEMO 2007).
More recently, it has been recognised that venture-backed performance DEMO also be
affected by behavioural and emotional factors.  The performance of DEMO
capitalist/entrepreneur dyads may be affected (positively or negatively) by reciprocal
feelings of fairness, trust, empathy and spite (Busenitz et al 1997, Cable and Shane
1997, Sapienza and Koorsgard 1996, De Clerq and Sapienza 2001, Shepherd and
Zacharakis 2001, Utset 2002).
Indeed, De Clerq and Sapienza (2001) coin the term ‘relational rents,’ referring DEMO the
value-creating potential of fairness and trust in venture-backed firms. However, DEMO
authors note that “no in-depth analysis has been made of how relational rents might be
created for both parties in the venture capitalist-entrepreneur dyad.”
DEMO observation motivates our analysis. In particular, we develop a behavioural
game-theoretic DEMO of venture capital contracting in order to analyse the combined
impact of fairness and trust on agency problems and venture performance. Our model
develops DEMO literature in two major ways. First, it presents a formal game-theoretic
DEMO
analysis of the effects of fairness and trust on venture performance, hence addressing
the lacuna identified by De Clerq and Sapienza (2001). Second, we identify that
fairness and trust may be related, and therefore, we provide the first formal analysis of
the combined effects of fairness DEMO trust.
Our model consists of three stages; a financial contracting stage (in which a venture
capitalist and an entrepreneur negotiate over their respective DEMO shares), followed
by a performance stage (in which the entrepreneur DEMO value-adding effort in
developing the business).  The entrepreneur’s effort affects DEMO probability of success
of the venture.  In the final stage of DEMO game, the venture capitalist can force re-
negotiation of the financial DEMO (in order to reallocate the equity stakes in the
venture capitalist’s DEMO).
When developing our analysis, we demonstrate that our model has DEMO following
ingredients;
a) Double-sided moral hazard, in the form of the E’s shirking incentives at the
effort stage, and the VC’s hold-up threat at the ex post stage.
b) Fairness norms, which affect DEMO VC’s equity offer, and the E’s effort
incentives.
c) VC trustworthiness, relating to the risk faced by the E that the VC will force
ex post re-negotiation of the contract in her favour.
We further DEMO that factors b) and c) combine to mitigate the double-sided
agency problem, and improve firm performance.
Before proceeding to our model, we DEMO provide a brief review of the key literature
relating to each of our ingredients.

1.1.  Double-sided Moral Hazard in Venture Capital.
The early financial contracting models (e.g., Baker and Gompers 1999) assumed a
pure principal-agent relationship in which the venture capitalist, as principal, suffers
from moral hazard problems DEMO the entrepreneur, as agent. However, Smith (1998)
argues that, since both parties contribute wealth-creating efforts, the performance of
the venture may be subject to double-sided moral hazard problems.
Some researchers have developed double-sided DEMO hazard models (e.g., Houben
2002, Casamatta 2003, Fairchild 2004, DEMO and Suarez 2004) whereby the
entrepreneur and the venture capitalist both DEMO value-adding effort. The double-
sided moral hazard problem exists due to the parties’ incentives to shirk.
In this paper, we consider a different form of double-sided moral hazard. In our
model, the E contributes value-creating effort. Hence, the VC faces moral hazard in
the form of entrepreneurial shirking. After the E has exerted effort, the VC can force
ex post renegotiation of the equity stakes. Hence, the E faces moral hazard in the form
of the VC’s ex post hold-up threat.
Indeed, Smith (DEMO) argues that “the most prominent risk to entrepreneurs is
opportunism. The DEMO for opportunism arises from the possibility that the VC
will attempt to renegotiate with the entrepreneur at a point in the relationship when
the DEMO has diminished bargaining power.”
The VCs ex post hold-up threat is receiving increasing attention in the literature (see
eg; Smith 1998, Repullo and Suarez 2003, Chemla et al 2004, Skeie 2004, Gebhardt
and Schmidt 2006, Bigus 2002, Utset 2002). These researchers note that certain
DEMO
features of the VC contract provide the VC with increasing bargaining power DEMO
time1. This provides the VC with leverage to force ex post renegotiation of the
financial contract in her favour.
The VC’s ex post hold-up DEMO weakens the E’s ex ante effort incentives. Some
researchers  (eg; DEMO 2004) have argued the VC may therefore voluntarily use
contractual methods DEMO commit not to act opportunistically ex post, in order to
strengthen DEMO E’s ex ante incentives. In contrast to contractual solutions, our model
DEMO the role of VC trustworthiness in mitigating the VC hold-up problem.
1.2.  Emerging Research on Fairness and Trust in Venture Capital
The existing financial contracting models assume that entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists maximize utility based on DEMO self-interest. However, behavioral
economists recognize that relationships may be affected by DEMO factors,
such as feelings of fairness and reciprocity (Bolton 1991, Rabin  1993, Fehr et al
1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, DEMO and Ockenfels 2000, Anderhub et al 2001), empathy
(Sally 2001), and trust (Berg et al 1995, Bolle 1995, Huang 2000, Bacharach et al
2001). Furthermore, these feelings may affect the DEMO of negotiations and
performance.
VC researchers are beginning to develop conceptual models of the impact of fairness
and trust on VC contracting and performance. DEMO researchers compare agency
theory (Barney et al 1994) with procedural justice theory (Sapienza and Korsgaard
1996, Sapienza et al 2000, De Clerq and Sapienza 2001, Shepherd and Zacharakis
1 Smith (1998), Bigus (2002),  Repullo and Suarez (2003), and Utset (2002) DEMO note that the VC’s
staging of financing enables the VC to increase her bargaining power over time, resulting in the ex post
hold-up threat. In Skeie’s  (2004) model, the VC’s increased bargaining power, and the ex post threat,
arises form the common feature of vesting DEMO equity payments to the entrepreneur.

2001). The agency theory approach emphasises mechanisms to control venture
capitalist DEMO entrepreneurial self-interested opportunistic behaviour. In contrast to
agency theory, procedural justice DEMO focuses on the perceived sense of fairness in
making decisions.
Lehtonen et al (2004) note that procedural justice theory may be particularly relevant
DEMO the VC/E relationship. The VC/E relationship may be subject to feelings of
unfairness and mistrust. VCs often complain that entrepreneurs are reluctant DEMO share
information (Sapienza 1989).  A person’s willingness to share information and
provide timely feedback may signal his openness and honesty (Sapienza and
Korsgaard 1996). According to PJ, the more one party perceives a procedure to be
fair, the greater they will trust the other party.
Increased trust and communication between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can
create ‘relational DEMO (De Clercq and Sapienza 2001). Open and frequent
communication between DEMO entrepreneur and the venture capitalist may result in an
increase in perceptions of fairness and trust, thus mitigating agency problems
(Shepherd and Zacharakis DEMO).
Procedural justice theory can also be employed to consider the VC’s ex post hold-up
problem. An increase in a person’s perception of fairness DEMO lead to an increase in
commitment to decisions, performance, behaviour and attitude (Kim and Mauborgne
1991, 1993).  This increased commitment, DEMO feelings of fairness, may mitigate the
venture capitalist’s opportunistic post-investment threat DEMO early exit (Shepherd and
Zacharakis 2001, Utset 2002).
8
1.3.  General Game-theoretic Research on Fairness and Trust
In recent years, DEMO economists have begun the task of developing formal
game-theoretic models of fairness (e.g, Becker 1974, Bolton 1991, Rabin 1993, Fehr
and Schmidt 1999) and trust (e.g; Berg et al 1995).
In general, these researchers have modelled fairness by assuming that agents not only
consider their own payoffs in absolute terms, but also in relative terms (DEMO is,
compared to other agents’ payoffs).  Formally, fairness is modelled by including both
absolute and relative payoffs in the players’ utility DEMO
In this paper, we focus on Fehr and Schmidt’s (1999) DEMO of inequity-aversion.
This approach combines envy and altruism; each player dislikes DEMO payoffs,
either in his own, or the other player’s, favour. Fehr and Schmidt model this as
follows. A player suffers a utility DEMO either if her opponent has a higher or a lower
payoff. As a result, players take actions to equalise payoffs2.
Fehr and Schmidt develop a series of models of reciprocal fairness in a principal-
agent context, where reciprocal fairness may induce high wage offers from
management to workers, and high effort levels by workers in response.  Further, FS
test DEMO models experimentally. They provide evidence of reciprocal fairness.
Models of fairness can be developed to include social norms. Huang (2000) considers
the effect DEMO a fairness norm on the equilibrium of a two-player ultimatum bargaining
2 Other fairness models include Becker (1974) who considers pure altruism, Bolton (1991) who
analyses enviable fairness,  and Rabin (1993), in which a player’s reaction to another player’s unfair
behaviour depends upon whether DEMO behaviour is intentional. He considers players’ reciprocation of
perceived nice or nasty behaviour, and he derives a “fairness equilibrium.”

game.  Interestingly, he relates fairness to anger as follows; “In psychological games,
the impact of anger on payoffs depends on endogenously determined DEMO
beliefs about behaviour. The less likely that a party believes that it is going to be
offered the smaller part of an unequal division, the more anger that party will suffer if
such an offer is DEMO Conversely, the more likely a party believes that it will be
DEMO the lesser share of an unequal division, the less anger it DEMO suffer if such an
offer is made.”
Our modelling approach to fairness draws upon Fehr and Schmidt’s inequity-aversion
approach, together with Huang’s (2000) social norm methodology.
Behavioural economists have identified several methods for modelling trust. DEMO
general trust game is based on reciprocity of behaviour (e.g, Berg et al  1995 and
Maccabe et al)3 .  In contrast, Al-Najjur and Casadessus-Masanell (2001) develop a
principal-agent model in which trust DEMO a characteristic of a player, rather than a
reciprocal response.
Our DEMO to trust is closest to Al-Najjur and Casadessus-Masanell (2001). That DEMO,
in our model,  we simplify the approach to by not considering reciprocal trust.
Instead, we focus on VC trustworthiness as a characteristic. That is the VC’s
behaviour depends on her type (trustworthy or untrustworthy), and is not a reaction to
E’s behaviour (that is, DEMO VC does not exhibit reciprocal behaviour).
3 The reciprocal trust game, as developed by Berg et al (1995)  and Maccabe et DEMO, is designed as
follows. The first player (the trustor) chooses DEMO to send money to the second player (the trustee).
The DEMO player then chooses whether to invest this money in a value-adding project. Finally, the
second player then decides how much of the value created to return to the first player. Experimental
evidence of the first player’s DEMO to send money, and the second player’s willingness to return
money, provides support of reciprocal trust.
10
Our model compares with Al-Najjur and Casadessus-Masanell (2001) as follows.
They DEMO a model of trust in agency contracts, whereby an agent chooses DEMO
effort level and then the principal chooses a wage from a bounded interval. The
authors consider two types of principal; trustworthy and self-interested. In contrast to
our model, the self-interested principal chooses the lowest possible wage in the
interval, while the trustworthy principal chooses the lowest possible wage such that
the agent’s participation constraint is just satisfied. In contrast, in our model, the VC
makes an initial equity proposal to the E, and then the E exerts effort. The trustworthy
VC does not force ex post renegotiation of the equity allocation. The trustworthy VC
does. Furthermore, in contrast to Al-Najjur and Casedessus-Masanell (2001), we
consider the combined impact of fairness and trust.
The rest of the paper is organised DEMO follows. In section 3, we present the model, and
solve for the effect of the fairness norm and VC ability on the VC’s DEMO
equity proposal and the players’ equilibrium effort levels.  In section 4, we consider
the effect of the fairness norm and VC ability on DEMO venture performance. In
section 5, we discuss policy implications emanating from DEMO model.  Section 6
concludes with a discussion of future research.
2. DEMO Model
We consider a venture capitalist/entrepreneur financial contracting game in which an
entrepreneur (E) has an idea for an innovative project, and approaches a venture
capitalist (VC) to obtain funding. The E and DEMO VC firstly negotiate over the financial
contract (specifically, they negotiate over their respective cashflow rights in the form
of an equity allocation). DEMO agreeing the contract, the E exerts effort in forming the
11
business and creating value. Specifically, the E’s effort affects the probability of
success for the business (hence, at this stage, we consider moral hazard in the form of
E’s shirking). After the project outcome DEMO realised, the VC has an opportunity to
force re-negotiation of the DEMO in order to re-allocate the equity stakes in her
favour (the DEMO hold-up threat).
We model the negotiation stage as an ultimatum bargaining game in which the VC
makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer of equity to DEMO E (this embodies the idea that the VC
has the bargaining DEMO). The equity offer affects the entrepreneur’s effort
incentives. Furthermore, the DEMO ex post hold-up threat reduces the E’s ex ante effort
incentives. We demonstrate that fairness and trust mitigate these moral hazard
problems. Fairness induces DEMO VC to offer a higher equity stake, which mitigates the
E’s DEMO problem. VC trustworthiness reduces the ex post threat, which further
strengthens DEMO E’s effort incentives.
Our model incorporates the effects of fairness and trust as follows. The E and the VC
are drawn randomly from a DEMO consisting of r ∈
inequity-averse (fair)
VCs and 1 − DEMO self-interested VCs; r reciprocating Es (that is, these Es are DEMO
with fairness, and react to unfair treatment with anger or spite) and 1 − r self-
interested Es.  We denote these types as E i and VC i , with ∈
where S refers
to DEMO self-interested type, and F refers to a fair type.
In our DEMO, fairness and trust are related as follows. We assume that all DEMO the
inequity-averse VCs are trustworthy. Furthermore, a proportion t of the DEMO
interested VCs are trustworthy; and a proportion 1 − t are DEMO We consider
three possible levels of trust; none of the self-interested DEMO are trustworthy, half of
the self-interested VCs are trustworthy, or all of the self-interested VCs are
12
trustworthy; t ∈
1
2
This enables us to consider the combined effects of
increasing societal fairness and trust on venture performance in a DEMO and tractable
way.
Since the VC is drawn at random from a population of r fair and 1 − r self-interested
VCs, the probability of the VC being trustworthy is
= + −
We refer to DEMO as
the expected level of trustworthiness in society. The relationship between societal
fairness and trust is as follows. If  t = 0, T DEMO r. Since none of the self-interested VCs
are trustworthy, there is DEMO direct, one-to-one, relationship between increasing societal
fairness and increasing trust. If t = 1 ,
2
T = 1 + r , with T ∈[ 1
2 2
when r ∈
1].
When t = DEMO, T = 1 for any level of fairness r. Since all DEMO (fair or self-interested)
are trustworthy, the level of fairness is has no effect on societal trustworthiness.
The timeline of the game is DEMO follows;
Date 0:  The Matching Stage: A VC and DEMO E are drawn and matched randomly from
the population. Each player’s fair or self-interested type is revealed to the other
player.  If the VC is revealed to be fair, then the E knows that the VC is trustworthy.
However, we assume that if the VC is revealed to be self-interested, her
trustworthiness is not revealed until date 4.
Date 1:  Financial Contracting Stage: The VC makes a take-it-or-leave-it proposal
relating to the E’s and the VC’s relative equity stakes4. Specifically, the VC offers the

α.
Date 2: Post-contractual Value-creating Stage:  The E exerts effort e.
Effo t is costly, r
and we assume that the cost of effort is
= β 2 ; this represents increasing marginal
cost of effort.
The DEMO has two possible date 3 outcomes, success, in which case the project
provides date 3 income R, or failure, in which case DEMO project provides income zero.
The E’s effort level affects the probability of success P.  We model this as follows;
the probability of success is  P =
γe,
while the probability of failure is
− P
Therefore, at date 2, the expected value of the project DEMO V =γ
eR.
Date 3: Project outcome stage:  At this DEMO, the outcome of the project (success or
failure) is revealed.
DEMO 4: The Ex Post Renegotiation Stage:  After the project’s outcome DEMO been
achieved, the VC has the opportunity to force renegotiation of DEMO equity stakes in the
financial contract, making a new take-it-or-leave-it offer. DEMO assume that only the
untrustworthy type carries out this threat, whereas DEMO trustworthy type does not.
2.1 Analysis of the Game
We note that our game consists of three sequential decisions; a) the VC’s date DEMO
equity proposal, b) the E’s date 2 effort decision, and DEMO) the VC’s date 4 re-
negotiation decision. We solve this game DEMO the standard game-theoretic approach.
That is, we employ backward induction, whereby we solve for the equilibrium
decisions in reverse order, as follows.
14
First, we solve for the VC’s ex post date 4 re-negotiation decision, taking as given the
VC’s date 1 equity proposal and the E’s date 2 effort decision. Then, we move back to
date 2 to solve for the E’s effort decision, still taking as given the VC’s date 1 equity
proposal. Finally, we move back to date 1 to solve for the VC’s equity decision, hence
deriving the equilibrium of the entire game.
2.2: The VC’s date 4 re-negotiation threat.
At date 4, the E has already exerted effort, and the outcome of the DEMO has been
realised. If the project failed, realising income of zero, the VC’s re-negotiation threat
is irrelevant.
If the project succeeded at date DEMO, then, by assumption, the trustworthy VC does not
force re-negotiation, and the E and the VC receive their respective equity allocations,
DEMO and
−α R as agreed at date 1.   If the VC is untrustworthy, then, since the E
R
has already exerted effort, and the outcome R has already been achieved, the VC will
take all of the equity, providing the E and the VC with respective payoffs of zero and
R..
2.3: Date 2  Effort Stage/date DEMO Equity Stage.
For presentation purposes, we present our analysis of these DEMO decisions together in
this sub-section (still using backward induction).
Since DEMO E and the VC are drawn randomly from the population at date 0, we note
that there are 4 possible combinations of types in the VC/E dyad.  We proceed to
solve the game by considering the different combinations. Furthermore, we now
formalise a payoff structure, which DEMO necessary in order to solve the game.
15
2.4. Benchmark Case:
S +
S
We refer to the dyad DEMO which both players are self-interested as the benchmark case,
since this reflects the standard view in economics that agents are strictly self-
interested (homo oeconomicus).
We consider the following expected payoff5 function for the DEMO E;
∏=−

that VC S is trustworthy. The
E can observe that the VC is self-interested, but not whether the VC is trustworthy or
untrustworthy.  With probability t, the VC S is trustworthy, and, therefore, the E will
retain his agreed equity share throughout the game. With DEMO
− t  E has
matched with an untrustworthy VC S who DEMO re-negotiation at date 4, taking all of
the equity. The second DEMO of the payoff is the E’s cost of effort.
In order to solve for the VC’s optimal date 1 equity proposal, we define the VC’s
payoff, as follows;
∏VC
==α
αγ .       (2)
Using equations (1) and (2), we obtain DEMO first result.
5 This represents the E’s expected payoff as at date 2 (when he makes his effort decision). At this stage,
the E knows that the VC is self-interested, and so knows that she is trustworthy with probability  t.
6 This equity share was already agreed at date 1.

the VC’s equilibrium equity proposal is α=

Proof: See Appendix.
Proposition 1 reveals that, in DEMO standard case where both players are self-interested,
the VC offers half of the equity to the E, retaining the other half for herself.
Intuitively, the VC faces a trade-off between giving equity to the E to motivate
entrepreneurial value-creating efforts, and retaining equity for herself. If the VC kept
all of the equity, the E would exert zero effort, and no value would be created (the VC
would hold 100% DEMO a project with zero value). If the VC gave all of the equity to the
E, the E’s effort levels would be maximised, but the VC would hold a zero percentage
equity stake in a high-valued project. The VC maximises her payoff by providing
50% of the DEMO to the E, and retaining 50% herself.  Note that this is the VC’s
optimal equity offer regardless of the level of trust. Increasing DEMO of trust simply
increases the ‘peak’ in the VC’s payoff at 5α =
.
3.2.2.1 Either type of E (EF or EF ) matches with a fair VC  VCF
We define the fair equity proposal, DEMO , as the proposal that equalises expected
payoffs. Furthermore, we define DEMO fair (reciprocating) E’s payoff as follows;

This payoff has been constructed as follows. First, consider the terms in the square
brackets. The first term represents the E’s equity stake when the VC DEMO is trustworthy,
minus a term representing the reciprocating E’s disutility from receiving an equity
allocation α  that is different from the ‘fair’ proposal α .
The sec  term is the E’s ond
F
equity stake of zero minus the E’s disutility from receiving an equity allocation less
DEMO the ‘fair’ proposal. The term r  represents the social fairness norm (as in Huang).
The last term is the E’s cost of DEMO
Using (1),  (2) and (3), we obtain DEMO second main result.
Proposition 2: If the fair VC matches with DEMO type of E ( + , or
+ ), the VC’s DEMO equity proposal is α = 2 , and the equilibrium
3
expected project value is V = γ R
3β . By assumption, VC F is trustworthy.
Proof: See appendix.
Comparison of propositions 1 and 2 reveals that the fair VC offers more equity to the
E than DEMO self-interested VC.  Recall that the fair VC acts to equalise the DEMO
payoffs. Intuitively, the fair VC’s equity offer of  α = 2 compensates the E for his
F 3
18

effort costs. Further comparison of the propositions reveals that expected firm value DEMO
higher when the VC is fair (combined with either type of DEMO) than when both players
are self-interested.  VC fairness is indeed value-enhancing, since the higher equity
offer increases the E’s effort incentives.

Proposition 3 reveals that the self-interested VC’s equity offer is affected by DEMO
anticipation of the reciprocating E’s reaction (in terms of E’s effort DEMO), and is
further affected by the extent of the societal fairness norm.
If the fairness norm is zero r = the self-interested VC DEMO half of the equity to
the E (as in the S DEMO S dyad; see proposition 1) for any level of trust t.   As the
fairness norm increases towards 1, then (if t DEMO 1;  all members of the population are
trustworthy), the optimal equity offer incre  towards the fair VC’s equity offer ases
α* = 2 . For lower levels of t, the optimal equity offer increases more sharply, to
3
compensate the r ing E eciprocat for higher re-negotiation risk).
Similarly, in the F + S dyad, the DEMO of fairness r on firm value is moderated
by the level of trust t. If t = 1, then firm value ranges from  DEMO = γ R when r = 0
4β
(as in proposition DEMO), to V = γ R when r = 0 (as DEMO proposition 2). That is, if all
3β
members of the DEMO are trustworthy, then the self-interested VC’s optimal
equity offer to the DEMO E is merely affected by the societal fairness norm. When the
fairness norm is zero, the self-interested VC acts as she would when matching with a
self-interested E. As the fairness norm approaches unity, the self-interested VC’s
equity proposal is forced towards the fair VC’s proposal.
Comparison of DEMO b) and c) provide interesting results regarding the
relationship between fairness, trust and venture performance when the E is fair.  If VC
DEMO is too low, then no equity offer between zero and unity DEMO induce the
E to exert effort, due to the high re-negotiation DEMO Hence, firm value is zero.

If the level of VC trustworthiness is in a medium range, firm value is actually
reducing in the fairness norm. The intuition is that, as the fairness norm increases, the
reciprocating E feels more indignation at the high renegotiation risk, and reduces his
effort level.
If the level of VC trustworthiness is sufficiently high, firm value is increasing in the
fairness norm.

Diagram 1.
The diagram shows the following. When E S and VC S match (proposition 1), or E S
and VC F  match, venture performance is independent of fairness (horizontal lines).
When E F and VC S match, venture performance is decreasing in fairness for low VC
trustworthiness (proposition 3b), while it is increasing in fairness for high VC
trustworthiness (proposition 3c).

We note that expected venture value is increasing a) in the level of the fairness norm
(as a result of two effects; the self-interested VC is driven to offer a higher equity
stake to the E, and the proportion of fair VCs in the economy increases and dominates
(who both offer more equity, and are trustworthy for DEMO)), and b) in the level of VC
trustworthiness.  An DEMO point to note is that, for any level of fairness below
DEMO, the expected venture value is increasing in the level of trust. DEMO is the opposite
24
case to the VC’s optimal equity offer, where the optimal equity offer was decreasing
in the level of trust. Recall that e
th  VC needed to offer the E higher equity as
trustworthiness reduced in order DEMO compensate the E for the increased re-negotiation
risk.  Diagram 2 suggests DEMO this increased offer is not sufficient to prevent expected
value falling as trust diminishes.
3. Practical and Policy Implications.
We now employ our game-theoretic DEMO to consider practical and policy
implications, with reference to existing research. DEMO considered the combined effects
of fairness and trust on venture performance. We obtained the following results;
3.1. Societal Fairness and Trust.
First, we discuss the exogenous inputs into our model, societal fairness and trust.
There is much evidence (Camerer, 2003) that fairness norms vary considerably across
cultures.7 Using experimental ultimatum bargaining games, Roth et al (1991) found
much similarity in sharing norms amongst subjects in America, Israel, Japan DEMO
Yugoslavia. In contrast, Buchan et al’s (1997) ultimatum bargaining experiment
DEMO a strong sharing norm amongst subjects in the collectivistic culture of
Japan, compared with more self-interested behaviour in America.  Finally, Henrich et
al (2001, 2002) compared experimental ultimatum bargaining results for
Machiguenga farmers in Peru with subjects in the US, and found much more self-
interest in Peru.
7 For a detailed discussion of this point, see chapter 2 of Camerer’s (2003) excellent text-book on
behavioural game theory.  We provide a brief review here.
25
Camerer (2003) also discusses the trust experiment of Buchan et al (2000). These
authors found that Chinese investors were the most trusting DEMO trustworthy, while the
Japanese were the least.
Therefore, the evidence suggests that fairness and trust is greatly affected by culture.
Lehtonen et al (2004) relate culture and venture capital performance, stating that  “we
propose that a culture (geographical context), which does not call for high fairness
and justice (of actions) will increased the risk of opportunistic DEMO on the part
of the VC…. . This could provide Es with a method to evaluate the risk of
opportunistic behaviour based on geographical DEMO
As a policy implication, our model demonstrates that measures to increase DEMO and
fairness in society, and particularly between Es and VCs, would be beneficial for
venture performance (and economic growth). As a practical example, we suggest that
business school education (for example, at MBA level) of VCs and Es should
emphasise the beneficial role of fairness and trust in negotiations and contracting8.
On an empirical level, researchers should test the relationship between different
societies’ fairness-norms and venture capital contracting and DEMO
3.2 Fair and unfair cashflow rights
In our model, increasing societal DEMO resulted in fairer cashflow terms (in the
form of the equity DEMO between the VC and the E). In this section, we DEMO
specific examples of fair and unfair cash-flow rights.
In our model, DEMO increase in societal fairness resulted in the VC offering a higher (DEMO
fairer) equity stake to the E. In reality, the allocation of cash-flow rights subtly
8 Indeed, ethics courses at business schools often employ repeated prisoner’s dilemma experiments to
‘educate’ the students about fairness, trust and cooperation (Gibson 2003). These could be extended to
entrepreneurship classes.
26
depends upon the type of financial instruments employed (for example, equity DEMO
convertibles), and the conditions that the VC may negotiate into the contract, such as
punitive covenants (including anti-dilution and liquidation provisions) that subtly
affect cashflow rights over time.
Firstly, we consider the research into fair and unfair financial instruments (eg;
Hoffman and Blakey 1987, DEMO 2004, Cumming 2005).
Hoffman and Blakey (1987) argue that DEMO usually invest in redeemable preferred
stock or debentures. VCs like this type of instrument because it provides them with an
equity stake in the DEMO of success, and it provides them with debt (and first claim to
the cash flows) if the company fails.  The authors provide DEMO advice to entrepreneurs,
“if you have a choice, try to DEMO the VCs to accept a capital structure that consists
entirely of common stock, because it is simpler and keeps the balance sheet clean.
Chances are, however, that you won’t get them to agree to this DEMO your bargaining
position is extremely strong.”
Tucker (2004) also argues that convertibles, widely used by the VC industry,
represent an unfair financial instrument, and argues that Es should attempt to
negotiate an equity-based financial structure.  Cumming (2005) demonstrates that US
VCs make extensive use of convertibles, whereas Canadian VCs mainly hold equity
contracts. The traditional agency argument is that convertibles can be used by VCs to
control moral hazard DEMO relating to E’s opportunistic and shirking behaviour.
However, Cumming (2005) DEMO, as an interesting counter-argument, that the use
of equity may signal a trusting and fair VC/E relationship. He states, “The high
proportion of straight common equity contracts in Canada suggests that relatively
more trusts DEMO within Canadian VC markets when compared to the US. That is,
common equity places the entrepreneur and the VC ‘on the same team’.”
DEMO
Next, we consider the unfair terms that may be attached to the parties’ cash-flow
rights, such as anti-dilution and liquidation provisions (or ‘ratchets’)DEMO  VCs employ
these provisions to protect their investment. Hoffman and Blakey (1987) advise
entrepreneurs, “VCs’ concern over preserving their capital is legitimate. DEMO the same
time, you should review these provisions carefully to make DEMO that they are fair to
you and any other founders.”
Research has suggested (Hoffman and Blakey 1987, Tucker 20049) that such “unfair”
punitive covenants should be excluded from any VC/E contract, since they may have
the effect of reducing the E’s equity stake over time, potentially damaging fairness
and trust in the VC/E relationship.
In summary, in terms of cash flow rights, it may be argued that performance-
enhancing fairness and trust can be promoted by the VC’s avoidance of convertibles,DEMO
instead focussing on mutual allocation of equity to the VC and E, and by eliminating
onerous punitive covenants, such as anti-dilution rights and DEMO
4. Future Research
Our model has focussed on the effects of social fairness and trust on the fairness of
cash-flow rights and venture performance. DEMO, Kaplan and Stromberg (2000)
identify that VCs and Es negotiate over both cash flow rights and control rights in the
contract.  Further, Cable and Shane (1997) argue that non-contractual factors, such as
DEMO relationships and regular communication between VCs and Es could affect
cooperation and performance.  Therefore, we argue that increasing societal fairness
9 Tucker is DEMO entrepreneur, who obtained VC funding for his venture. In 2004, he conducted a small
survey of Es regarding fair and unfair cash-flow and DEMO rights.
28
may lead to fairer cash-flow and control rights, and fairer non-contractual behaviour,
hence enhancing performance.
We now discuss directions for future research, relating to fair control rights, and fair
non-contractual factors in the VC/E relationship.
4.1: Fair and Unfair Control Rights.
VCs and Es negotiate over their control rights in the venture. Researchers argue that
VCs may need DEMO protect their investment through such control provisions as
performance/forfeiture provisions (DEMO and Blakey 1987). Another control
mechanism employed by the VC relates to staged financing, whereby VCs provide
future rounds of financing if the E achieves certain milestones. Finally, VCs may
negotiate a ‘firing’ clause in the contract, whereby they can remove the E if the
venture fails to meet certain targets (Hellmann  1998).
Although these control rights DEMO be seen as protecting the VC’s investment, they
may be destroy DEMO and trust in the VC/E relationship. Indeed, a debate exists DEMO
the literature whether control rights and fairness/trust act as complements or
substitutes in enhancing venture performance. Cable and Shane (1997) imply that DEMO
are complements (increasing control leads to increase in trust and venture
DEMO). On the other hand, Shepherd and Zacharakis (2001) argue DEMO control
and trust/fairness may be substitutes. An increase in control may actually destroy
feelings of fairness and trust, adversely affecting venture performance.
Tucker (2004) argues that the E often signs over significant negative control DEMO,
leaving him with a feeling of lack of control in the relationship. For example, the VC
29
may negotiate to include restrictive covenants in the contract. These ensure that
DEMO must be sought from the VC when taking most operational decisions. This
may damage trust, adversely affecting venture performance.
Tucker also argues that a fair VC will produce detailed term-sheet running to several
pages, so that much of the negotiation can be conducted before each party legally
commits DEMO each other.   On the other hand, an unfair VC produces DEMO brief term-sheet,
leaving much room for future interpretation. The author further argues that VCs often
employ over-zealous lawyers who build in investor protections DEMO are not needed, or
have been specifically excluded in discussions between DEMO VC and the E. “The result
is a package of documentation which at best offers the investor all the protection they
need while ensuring DEMO E has the authority to run the business; and at worst,DEMO
promotes a bureaucratic approach to operational management, reminiscent of many
much DEMO corporations.”
4.2: Fair and Unfair Non-contractual Factors.
We should consider non-contractual DEMO, not specifically related to cash-flow
rights or control rights. According to DEMO justice theory, procedures that
increase the players’ perception of fairness can DEMO to increased cooperation. Cable
and Shane (1997), and Lehtonen et DEMO (2004) place emphasis on relationship-building
and open and frequent communication as methods of increasing perceptions of
fairness and trust in the VC/E DEMO
Communication provides a potent method of signalling fairness.  VCs typically invest
DEMO new, highly risky ventures, characterised by large asymmetric information
30
problems (Houben 2003). Es normally possess superior knowledge regarding the
technical aspects of the venture, while the VCs have superior information regarding
the potential market conditions. According to standard agency theory, VCs and Es
possess incentives to mis-state or with-hold their private information10.  Therefore,
timely and open communication of accurate information may increase the VC’s and
E’s mutual DEMO of fairness11.
4.3 Dynamic Fairness and trust VC/E Model.
In our model, fairness and trust are exogenously-given inputs which induces fairness
in cashflow terms, and possibly (but not modelled) fair control rights and fair non-
contractual behaviour (such as increased communication and relationship-building),
which, in turn, enhances cooperative efforts and performance.  We do not consider DEMO
dynamic effects on perceptions of fairness and trust over time in the VC/E
relationship.
Utset (2002) provides an inspirational basis for a DEMO research agenda on this
dynamic relationship. He provides a deep and extensive conceptual analysis of the
effects of behavioural factors (particularly reciprocal fairness and anger) on the
dynamic relationship between the VC and the E over time. Utset begins with the view
that the VC, as principal, DEMO to protect her investment from the self-interested
behaviour of the E. Hence, he argues that the VC structures the contract to retain
control over the E’s equity stake and the exit decision.
However, Utset  notes DEMO dynamic and complex nature of the relationship.
10 See Cable and Shane (1997) and Lehtonen et al (2004) for an extensive discussion DEMO the parties’
incentives to mis-state or with-hold information.
11 We argue that this may be analogous to our cash-flow model.  In our model, DEMO fairness-
norms resulted in a self-interested VC offering a more generous equity stake to the E, and the E
responding with more cooperative value-adding effort. Similarly, increasing fairness-norms may
induce self-interested VCs or Es to reveal more (truthful) information, with the same positive effects on
cooperative efforts and performance. Future research will develop our model in this direction.
31
“While the control mechanisms adopted by the VC play an important role DEMO
protecting their investment, they also give VCs great leeway to act
DEMO, and because Es make ex ante transaction-specific investments,
“the VC DEMO threaten to fire the E or use some other form of leverage to appropriate a
greater share of any potential surplus. This si the DEMO opportunism scenario.”
Utset incorporates behavioural considerations into the analysis. Firstly, he DEMO
how Es may enter into a VC contract with over-optimistic expectations of VC
trustworthiness and fairness. As the relationship develops over time, the E may begin
to observe increasing VC opportunism and unfair behaviour. As his DEMO,
overconfident, expectations become deflated, the E may then retaliate with increasing
anger and spite.
As Utset states, “The level of divergence of the E’s original expectations matters,
since it casts a shadow affecting DEMO/E relationships  during the life of the venture…..
. Under certain DEMO assumptions, the E will have an incentive to retaliate
against the DEMO, even if doing so comes at a cost to the E.”
DEMO believe that an important future step in the venture capital research is to develop a
dynamic behavioural model that captures the E’s retaliatory behaviour.
DEMO Conclusion
32
We have developed a behavioural
game-theoretic model of venture
capital/entrepreneur contracting DEMO performance that demonstrates that stronger
fairness-norms result in an increase in the equity stake offered by the VC to the E,
which, in turn, induces higher entrepreneurial effort, and improved venture
performance. We have DEMO discussed the effects of other unfair contractual terms,
such as unfair cash-flow provisions (anti-dilution provisions, ratchets, convertibles),
and unfair control DEMO (such as performance/forfeiture provisions, short-term
employment contracts, tranched financing)DEMO  Further, we have noted that non-
contractual factors, such as DEMO communication and empathetic personal
relationships can promote fairness, trust and venture DEMO
Our model provides a basis for future research. The first challenge is to formally
model these fair and unfair cash-flow and control rights. For DEMO, how do we
incorporate the fair and unfair features of equity DEMO convertibles, as identified by
Cumming (2005) and Tucker (2004), into a behavioural fairness model?
Secondly, we have taken fairness as an exogenous initial input into the game, which
subsequently affects equity allocation, effort levels, and performance. However, the
VC/E relationship is dynamic and inter-temporal. As Utset (2002) and Tucker (2004)
note, DEMO and trust can be damaged over time. We suggest that future researchers
develop a dynamic model, with fairness endogenously derived throughout the game.
Finally, we have focussed on reciprocal fairness, taking trust and trustworthiness as DEMO
exogenous characteristic of the players. In future research, we will incorporate
DEMO trust into our behavioural game-theoretic approach to venture capital
contracting.
