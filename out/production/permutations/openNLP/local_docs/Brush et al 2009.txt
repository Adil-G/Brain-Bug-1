ABSTRACT
Drawing on literature from organizational behavior, strategic change and technology, we examine
the new ventures’ readiness DEMO funding by angel investors, using a unique dataset of 334 firms
DEMO sought investment from a prominent angel group located outside of Boston, DEMO during 2007-
2008.  Findings suggest that tangible, objective characteristics are important during the first
decision-making stage, but that intangible, subjective new venture DEMO may be critical
during subsequent decision stages.  Interestingly, location remains significant throughout the angel
investment decision-making process.  Implications are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Angel financing is defined as “[i]nformal venture capital-equity investments and non-collateral
forms of lending DEMO by private individuals . . . using their own money, directly DEMO unquoted
companies in which they have no family connection: (Harrison & Mason, 1999).  It plays a crucial
role in financing growth-oriented DEMO by filling the gap between informal family and friends
and more formal institutional (venture capital) investment (Harrison & Mason, 1999; Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). Angel financing “is one of the most common, but least studied
methods, to finance new ventures” (Wong, 2002)DEMO  The Center for Venture Research estimates that
angels invested $19.2 billion DEMO 55,480 companies in 2008 (http://wsbe.unh.edu/cvr), the DEMO
Venture Capital Association assesses the impact of angel financing to be $100 billion in the
United States, while the institutional venture capital market is less than half this size at $48.3
billion (Wong, 2002).
DEMO significant portion of research on angel financing explores the determinants of angel
investing (Freear, Sohl, & Wetzel, 2002; Harrison & Mason, DEMO).  Extensive studies consider
the supply side of the equation and DEMO angel financing using an agency theory or social
psychology lens to explore different aspects of the investment process, such as deal generation,
screening, valuation, deal structure, monitoring, and exit (Maula, Autio & DEMO, 2005).
Research investigates the expertise of angel investors (Carter & Van Auken, 1992), information
processing (Sudek, Mitteness & Baucus, DEMO), decision-making processes (Wong, 2002), and
investment practices (Wiltbank & Boeker, 2007).
Comparatively less research focuses on the demand side DEMO angel finance.  Most of it focuses
on bootstrapping behaviors (Carter & Van Auken, 2000; Winborg & Landstrom, 2001).  Other
work DEMO attention to activities that legitimize the venture by obtaining licenses, paying
DEMO and building trust (Mason & Harrison, 1999).  Less is DEMO about the characteristics,
strategies and behavior of new ventures that are positioning to be considered for investment by
angels or angel groups (Mason, 2006).  Considering that there are more than 330 angel groups DEMO
the US and Canada, more than 260,500 individual active angels DEMO more than 55,000 companies
are funded by angels each year, DEMO better understanding of the factors influencing the positioning

and timing of the request for funding would be of interest http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org).
In other words, what are the factors that determine DEMO a venture is ready for angel funding?
We address this question and frame our research around the concept of “readiness”.  The
concept of readiness has been used in the organizational behavior literature, in work on strategic
change and in research on technology.  The organizational behavior literature investigates
readiness relative to organization members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change and
DEMO factors that can catalyze or influence transformative change (Eby, Adams, DEMO &
Gaby, 2000).  In the strategic change literature, the concept of readiness explains the extent to
which organization assets, processes and demonstrable activities indicate the organization is ready
to move from a current DEMO to a new desired end state (Kaplan & Norton, 2004).  Finally, the
notion of technology readiness is defined as an individual’s DEMO to accept or use new
technology (Parasuraman, 2000) or the DEMO readiness for commercialization or transfer
(Heslop, McGregor, & May, 2001).
In the context of a new venture seeking funding from an DEMO or angel group, a judgment
about “readiness” for funding is quite DEMO  The entrepreneur(s) decide the new venture is ready
to scale, and that they are ready to move the venture forward, despite DEMO risks and uncertainty in
the process.  Similarly, the angel investor(s) makes a determination as to the readiness of the
venture to grow based on the team, the operations and customer base, and skills DEMO competencies
of the organization and assess the investment risk and returns.  DEMO angel investor(s) assessment of
the venture will determine the readiness DEMO move to the next level, and this is often based on DEMO
potential to scale the business, risk/returns and time to exit (Sudek, 2006). Importantly, the
entrepreneurs’ perception of readiness to scale DEMO move forward may be quite different from the
investor’s perception of readiness.
To better understand the readiness phenomenon, we used a unique dataset of 334 firms that
sought angel investment from the members of a prominent DEMO investment group located outside
of Boston, MA during 2007-2008.  We organized our data around the concept of organizational,
strategic and technology readiness.  These three aspects are quite similar to the general categories
used in DEMO research; characteristics of the start-up team, characteristics of the new venture-
market and financial characteristics, and characteristics of stage of technology development.  DEMO
rest of our paper is organized as follows: first we discuss DEMO investing and then review the
literature on the angel investing and on the concept of “readiness”.  From this we derive a set of
hypotheses, move to a discussion of our methodology, our findings and conclude DEMO
implications and suggestions for future research.
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Readiness
The concept of readiness is explored in several different literatures, including organizational
behavior, DEMO, and technology.  In the organizational behavior literature, readiness is used DEMO
investigate organization members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change and considers
factors that can catalyze or influence transformative change (Eby, Adams, Russell & Gaby, 2000).
Readiness for change generally begins with an individual’s perception of the benefits of change,
perception of the risks of failing DEMO change and perceived external demands of the change
(Armenakis, et al, 1993; Prochaska, et al, 1994).  Self-efficacy and confidence in coping with
change as well as job characteristics also influence an individual’s DEMO readiness (Prochaska,
et al, 1997; Armenakis et al, 1993).  Perceptions of readiness for change are not necessarily shared

by individuals in the same work unit or organization, because people perceive their environments
differently.  Some studies explore the extent to which individuals are in an action stage and ready
to move forward even though there are DEMO and benefits to the process (Cunningham, et al, 2002;
DEMO, et al, 1994).  Finally, the characteristics of the organization and the structure and
policies that are needed to support and reinforce DEMO climate conducive to change for the effort to be
successful have also been examined (Eby, et al, 2000).
Strategic readiness assesses how well prepared a company’s people, systems and
organizational culture is to carry out its strategy (Kaplan & Norton, 2004).  It is argued that
strategic readiness is defined by the human, information and organizational capital, or the
intangible assets that are the foundation for strategy.  This DEMO piece provides a
methodology for assessing strategic readiness for change.  Pennings DEMO Harianto (1992)
examined technological innovation in the consumer banking industry DEMO a corporate
entrepreneurship perspective.  They concluded that continuous skill development promoted
DEMO for strategic corporate venturing in the future.  Ash and Burn (2003) explored the
management of internet-enabled ERP applications in six international organizations.  DEMO key
finding was that cultural readiness, measured as low risk aversion, leadership and open
communication, was positively related to success.  A key DEMO of strategic readiness has to do
with urgency in terms of time available to implement the needed strategic changes (Armenakis, et
al, 1993).
Technology readiness is different from organizational and strategic change.  In one view,
technology readiness is a measurement system that allows for comparison DEMO maturity between
different types of technology (Mankins, 1995).  In DEMO related research stream, researchers
investigate the readiness of technology commercialization and DEMO by constructing a model of
factors that lead to success (Heslop, et al, 2001).  Referred to as a cloverleaf model, four factors
are deemed important; strength of technology, market attractiveness, commercialization avenues
and management support (Heslop, et al, 2001).  Other research DEMO the psychological aspects
of customer reactions to company technologies in products and services (Parasuraman, 2000).
This study created an index, Technology Readiness Index (TRI) which measures an individual’s
readiness to use new technology DEMO general using four personality traits: optimism, innovativeness,
discomfort, and DEMO  Those with optimism and innovativeness and little discomfort and
insecurity were DEMO likely to use a new technology (Parasuraman, 2000).  Other DEMO examines
the role of human capital in the role of technology diffusion across countries, whereby building
skills and capabilities at the individual level is a pre-requisite for technology development (Lee,
2001).
Readiness and the Angel Investment Decision-Making Process
While there is a long tradition of research DEMO angel investing, recently research has begun to
focus on the angel DEMO decision-making process.  Much of that research focused on
developing and testing DEMO set of criteria on which investors make their funding decisions.  Factors
DEMO as capitalization (Feeney, Haines, & Riding, 1999; Van Osnabrugge, 2000; Mason &
Harrison, 2000), evidence of marketplace acceptance (DEMO & Guild, 1996, Sudek, 2006),
patent protection (Mason & Harrison, 1999, Haar, Starr & MacMillan, 1988) and human DEMO
such as skills (van Osnabrugge, 2000, Paul, Whittam, & DEMO, 2007), industry experience
(Bachher & Guild, 1996; Feeney et al, 1999; Sudek 2006) and track record (van Osnabrugge,
DEMO; Sudek, 2006) have been found to be significantly associated with DEMO investment. Clark
(2008) extends this research by examining sets of softer skill sets such as impression management,
finding that some opportunities were DEMO pursued based on a poor presentation by the

entrepreneur.  In addition, Maxwell, Jeffrey and Levesque (2009) examined over 150 interactions
between entrepreneurs and potential investors.  They found that to make their initial business
judgments, angels use a shortcut heuristic to reduce the number of available investment
opportunities.
We believe that an investigation of the DEMO of readiness from the perspective of the new
venture can enhance our understanding of the process of obtaining angel financing.  When an
entrepreneur  DEMO a proposal to an angel investment group, he or she has DEMO a determination
that the venture is ready to grow.  In terms DEMO organizational readiness, this would mean that the
new venture is ready DEMO change; in that it has a capable team with previous experience DEMO that
the key management roles are filled (Van Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000; Wong, 2002).  Ventures
showing strategic readiness would be those ventures that already have an investment in the
business and hence have DEMO stronger resource base (Freear, et al 2002).  Further, businesses
operating in an attractive market and having a track record of customers DEMO reflect strategic
readiness, as would the stage of the product development (Wong, 2002).  Technology readiness
would be characterized by those businesses DEMO have intellectual property (IP) that is protectable
in some way (DEMO & Mason, 1999).
In essence, the entrepreneur(s) have DEMO that the venture is organizationally,
strategically and technologically ready for angel investment.  Research about angel investor
decision-making suggests that in the proposal screening stage, all three aspects of readiness would
be important to passing the screen (Sudek, 2006).  Hall and Hofer (1993) showed that VCs put
more weight on aspects of the opportunity during the screening DEMO, while Haar, et al (1988)
found that angels were DEMO in management’s ability and market potential.  Mason and
Harrison (1999) DEMO that the most common reason for deal rejection was due to entrepreneurial
team, marketing and finance.   Having a management team or a revenue stream is an indication to
potential investors that the new venture has DEMO the initial research and development phases
(Wong, 2002). Hence we suggest:
H1a: New ventures that are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
DEMO: New ventures which are strategically ready are more likely to pass DEMO administrative
review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H1c: New DEMO which are technologically ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
Above, we posit that all three characteristics of readiness are necessary to move the
entrepreneurial new venture DEMO the angel group decision-making process.  However, once the
new venture passes the administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making
process, we believe that the equal emphasis on all three readiness characteristics shifts.  As the
new venture moves into the next phases of the decision making process, the screening committee
and then the entire angel group reviews the new DEMO to determine the new venture’s readiness
to be seriously considered as an investment opportunity (Sudek, 2006).  It is at this point that the
decision-making criteria shifts from an emphasis on the whole firm to DEMO focus on the individual
entrepreneur(s) and his or her organization, as first the screening committee and then the entire
angel group conducts DEMO more detailed analysis to determine whether the new venture has potential
to turn its proposed product or service into a viable and profitable business.

Brush et al.: GROWTH-ORIENTED VENTURES AND THE PURSUIT OF ANGEL FINANCING
This focus on the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial team is consistent with long-standing
DEMO in the entrepreneurship literature.  Early research by MacMillan, et al (DEMO) shows that
both angels and VCs weight the entrepreneur and new DEMO team (NVT) more heavily in the
investment decision than the opportunity and its market potential.  Van Osnabrugge and Robinson
(2000) find that entrepreneur enthusiasm and trustworthiness are top criteria in determining
funding, while Feeney, et al (1999) find that more active angel investors tend to focus on owner
attributes as opposed to less active angels who focus DEMO business attributes.  Sudek (2006) reports
that management team trust and DEMO were top criteria in determining investment by angels
in a California study.  Wong (2002) argues that intangible factors such as entrepreneur’s prior
experience may provide signals to alleviate investor uncertainty. Further, investors may feel more
secure investing with entrepreneurs who have a previous track record of starting DEMO growing a
business.  Finally, Maxwell et al (2009) suggest that after the initial phase in the angel investment
process, decision heuristics are abandoned and angel investors adopt a more complete and likely
more subjective DEMO of criteria to further evaluate investment opportunities.   Hence we
hypothesize:
H2a. New ventures which are organizationally ready are more likely to pass DEMO screening
committee review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H2b. New ventures which are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the
presentation DEMO of the angel investment decision-making process.
METHODOLOGY
Data Collection and Coding Procedure
Data for the study came from the investment proposals (N = 334) submitted to a large angel
financing group located in the Northeast over a two-year period (2006-2007).  The firms applying
for angel funding DEMO new and small ventures, which were on average less than five DEMO old
(mean = 4.81 years) and had fewer than 10 employees (mean = 9.80).  About half of them (47%)
operated in the technology sector of the economy and almost two-thirds (63.88%) DEMO from New
England.
The angel group had a four-step decision process.  DEMO investment proposal was reviewed by
an administrative committee which made a decision to “desk reject” the proposal or to move it on
to a DEMO committee presentation.  Ventures successful in passing the screening presentation
were invited DEMO present to the larger group of investors.  Those successful at the DEMO group
presentation were in turn able to enter the due diligence process. The angel group provided us with
the pool of investment proposals submitted DEMO the period, the desk reject decisions, screening
committee decisions and outcome of the formal presentations.  The investment proposals were
between one and five pages in length and offered detailed information about the qualifications of
the DEMO team, the nature of the business, the amount of capital sought, cash flow, and the
intended use of the funds, as well as a variety of additional product, intellectual property, market,
and DEMO projections.
To generate the dataset, two trained research assistants independently coded DEMO investment
proposals, following a specific coding scheme developed by the principal DEMO, which
consisted of sixty-four categories.  We then calculated interrater reliability, DEMO the
kappa procedure in STATA, and utilized the linear weighted Cohen’s DEMO statistics for the
ordinal categories.  The percent agreement across the coding DEMO ranged between 76.19%
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 30 [2010], Iss. 12, Art. 2
and 91.30%, well above the recommended .70 threshold (Stemler, 2004).  Coding inconsistencies,
which occurred infrequently, were resolved by one of DEMO three study coauthors.
Measures
The dependent variable for this study was a four-level ordinal variable which captured whether
the angel group decision was to DEMO reject” the proposal, accept the proposal for screening,
accept the DEMO proposal for presentation, and accept the presented proposal for due diligence.
DEMO specifically, if the new venture was desk-rejected, the outcome of the angel investment
process was coded as “0”; if the new venture passed the desk-rejection stage, the outcome was
coded as “1”, if the DEMO venture passed the “small group” screening presentation and was invited
for a presentation in front of the larger group, the outcome was coded as ”2”, and if the new
venture passed the “big group presentation” and was moved to due diligence, the outcome was
coded as”3”.
Organizational readiness was captured by three variables: the number of employees of the new
venture (self-reported), the number of people on the top management team (calculated as the tally
of managers listed in the proposal) and DEMO top management team’s industry experience (extracted
from the “Management” section of DEMO proposal and coded as “1” if the team had industry
experience and “0” otherwise).  Strategic readiness was captured by four self-reported variables: DEMO
binary measure of whether or not the company had current customers, DEMO ordinal measure of the
level of new product development (“concept”, coded as “1”, “prototype”, coded as “2”. “product
in development”, coded as “3”, “product ready”, coded as “4”, and “revenue generated from sale
of product”, coded as “5”), expected revenues in 2009,  and the new venture’s pre-money
valuation. Finally, technological readiness was captured by a binary measure that reflected
whether or not the new venture had intellectual DEMO in the form of a patent or patent-pending
technology, trademark, or proprietary technology.  The variable was extracted from the
“Competitive Advantage” section of the investment proposal.
We controlled for industry and firm-level factors which prior DEMO research has found to
impact the angel financing process.  Descriptive statistics DEMO correlations are presented in Tables
1 and 2.
Statistical Procedure
To test for the effect of factors that determine the progress of the new DEMO through the
subsequent rounds of the angel financing process, we implemented DEMO sequential logit (seqlogit)
procedure in Stata.  This model estimates the effect of the explanatory variables on the
probabilities of passing a set DEMO transitions.  The user can specify any decision tree as long as DEMO
level of the dependent variable can be reached though one and only one sequence of transitions
(Buis, 2007).  In our case, DEMO new venture passes through a series of eliminations: desk-rejection,
small-group DEMO, and outcome of the presentation to the larger angel investment group.
DEMO each stage (level) of the outcome can be reached through one and only one sequence of
transitions, seqlogit is an appropriate statistical technique.  Compared to a simple logit analysis,
sequential logit acknowledges that the entire choice set is not considered simultaneously.  On the
other hand, DEMO we know the highest achieved stage of the investment decision, we DEMO
reconstruct the entire progression of the new venture through the investment process.
The statistical output shows the estimated effect of the explanatory variables on DEMO likelihood
of passing through each sequence of transitions specified in the decision tree.  The effect is

Brush et al.: GROWTH-ORIENTED VENTURES AND THE PURSUIT OF ANGEL FINANCING
reported as an “odds” ratio (together with the corresponding standard errors), or the ratio of the
odds of an event occurring in one group DEMO the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a
DEMO estimate of that ratio.  An odds ratio of 1 indicates that DEMO condition or event under
study is equally likely to occur in both groups.  An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates a positive
effect of the explanatory/control variable, whereas an odds ratio less than 1 indicates a negative
relationship.
RESULTS
The results from the sequential logit estimation (Table 3) suggest that at the first transition
(desk-rejection), one of DEMO three measures of organizational readiness (the size of the top
management DEMO) significantly increases the odds of passing through this elimination stage.
This, Hypothesis 1a receives partial support.  Two of the four measures of strategic readiness
(presence of current customers and stage of product development) are DEMO and positively
associated with the odds of passing through the desk-rejection stage.  Pre-money valuation shows
a significant negative, albeit non-substantive association (odds ratio very close to 1).  Thus,
Hypothesis 1b receives mixed support.  Intellectual property, a measure of technological
readiness, significantly improves the odds of passing through the desk-rejection stage.  Thus,
Hypothesis 1c is supported.
At the second and third transition sequence (“Small Group Presentation” and “Big Group
Presentation” columns in Table 3), none of the measures of DEMO readiness is
significantly associated with the outcome variable.  Thus, Hypotheses 2a and 2b fail to receive
support. From the control variables, location was a significant factor throughout all transition
sequences specified in the model.  Being located in New England significantly improved the odds
of passing the desk-rejection, screening, and big group presentation stage of the investment
process.
DISCUSSION
Changing Investment Criteria
Our list of investment criteria used by early stage investors DEMO similar to that found in other
studies.  In considering the factors DEMO likelihood of moving past the desk reject stage, we
had partial DEMO for organizational and strategic readiness and full support for technology
readiness.  DEMO partial support for organizational readiness follows previous work finding the
importance of human factors such as skills (van Osnabrugge, 2000, Paul, et DEMO, 2007).  The partial
support for strategic readiness on the angel’s decision to move is in line with studies by Haar, et al
(1988) and Wong (2002).  The full support for our DEMO about the importance of
technological readiness (which we operationalized as the DEMO of intellectual property
protection) follows past research as well. (Haar, DEMO al, 1988; Mason & Harrison, 1999).  This
suggests that our research provides important empirical validation to the findings of other studies
DEMO early stage investors.   On the other hand, our predictions regarding DEMO primacy of
organizational readiness in the screening and full presentation stages did not hold up.  While
previous research emphasizes the importance of the qualities of the entrepreneur (Feeney, et al,
1999; Wong, 2002; Sudek, 2006) it appears that other factors make more of a DEMO  Given
previous research both in venture capital and angel investing, it can be expected that the
entrepreneur(s)’ presentation and social skills DEMO also be important (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush &
Baron, 2004; Clark, 2008).
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2010
7
Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 30 [2010], Iss. 12, Art. 2
While we are encouraged by the convergence of our findings relative to DEMO work on angel
investing, it is apparent that the criteria seemed DEMO change as new ventures went through the angel
investment decision-making process.  DEMO, at the administrative review leading to accept or
desk reject, it was tangible and often quantifiable decision-making criteria that were significant.
This suggests DEMO for the administrative review, there is a set of criteria that DEMO administrative
team is looking for, and if the firm meets many DEMO those, then they are moved forward in the
process.  One example, with respect to organizational readiness, is that the variable “size of DEMO top
management team” was highly significant. When we look more closely at this measure of
readiness, it is clear this is an easily quantifiable measure.  In addition, if angels use the size of the
top DEMO team as an indication of whether or not the key management roles are filled (Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000; Wong, 2002), DEMO the administrative team making the move
forward/desk reject decision has a quick litmus test of both the entrepreneur and the organizational
capability of DEMO new venture.
As we looked at the data for the firms who were successful in making it through the first stage
in the decision-making DEMO and into screening, we noticed that the decision criterion for
advancing DEMO subsequent stages is different.  No longer were control variables such as DEMO to
Consumer (BtoC), and the amount of capital sought, organizational variables such as the size of
the management team, strategic variables such as current customers, stage of product development
and pre-money valuation and technological variables such as intellectual property, significant.  As
the new venture moves DEMO the subsequent decision phases, it appears that tangible, objective
criteria cease to be the drivers of angel decision making.  It is plausible to surmise, then, that
intangible, subjective criteria would increase in importance.  DEMO the angel investors increase their
level of scrutiny, they start to DEMO for less quantifiable intangibles, such as the trustworthiness,
(Sudek, DEMO) commitment (Erikson, 2001), and passion (Chen, Yao & DEMO, 2009; Sudek,
Miteness & Cardon, 2009) of the top management team.  Further, this raises questions about the
role of perceptions DEMO how this may influence the angel investor evaluation (Sudek et al, 2006)
and the ability of the entrepreneur(s) to manage impressions or perceptions (Hoehn-Weiss et al,
2004).
Therefore, we suggest DEMO at the first stage of consideration where the group administrative
team makes “accept or desk-reject” decisions, readiness is comprised of tangible, objective
investment DEMO  However, as the firm moves through the angel investment decision making
process, readiness takes on less tangible and more subjective dimensions which may be more
observable in the entrepreneur(s)’ presentation.  The lack of significance for team size or
experience over other aspects of readiness suggests DEMO social skills such as impression
management, persuasiveness, ability to think on your feet, to answer questions and to listen to
advice may outweigh the measurable factors (Hoehn-Weiss et al, 2004; Clark 2008).  DEMO, the
role of self confidence and self perception as it is DEMO with readiness is of interest given that
entrepreneurs seeking equity funding perceive themselves as more persuasive than outside
evaluators (Hoehn-Weiss, et al, 2004).
The Importance of Location of the New Venture in all of DEMO Phases of the Angel Investment
Decision-Making Process
While our findings suggest that the investment criterion changes as new ventures progress
through the angel investment DEMO process, the importance of location remains
constant.  This does support previous findings suggesting that location is important at the time of
investment because DEMO serving on the board would like to have the venture accessible (DEMO
& Rogers, 1997).  However, from the perspective of early DEMO readiness assessment, this is

Brush et al.: GROWTH-ORIENTED VENTURES AND THE PURSUIT OF ANGEL FINANCING
significant at the submission stage.  In other words, just to pass the DEMO reject stage, location
becomes an aspect of consideration.  New ventures that are seeking angel investments are in the
very early stages of development.  They typically have exhausted their initial sources of capital,
which often DEMO from friends and family, but are not ready for the large DEMO infusions
provided by professional venture capital firms.  Empirical evidence suggests that DEMO this stage of
development, firms search locally for additional sources of DEMO (Wong, 2002).  Private angel
investors who are willing to DEMO in early stage ventures often form a localized bond of trust with
the management of the new venture, which decreases the necessity for formal control mechanisms
such as board seats and staged investment.  However, in DEMO absence of a formal control
mechanism, informal monitoring becomes increasingly important DEMO angel investors seek to keep
an eye on the progress of the new venture.
In addition to providing essential venture funding, angel investors are also known for their
willingness to get involved in the new venture, either by joining the management team or by
giving advice to the DEMO  These “non-financial motives” are a very strong secondary
consideration for becoming DEMO business angel, as it is well known that business angels seek DEMO
contribute their experience and knowledge to their investments (Mason & Harrison, 2000).  Given
that the desire to be involved in the entrepreneurial process is an important reason why private
investors choose to become angels, location of the new venture becomes critical.
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The objective DEMO this paper was to use the concept of readiness to explore the new ventures’
readiness for funding by angel investors.  The findings suggest that even though entrepreneurs
may believe they are ready for funding, in reality they might be driven more by a sense of urgency
than readiness.  Readiness is perceptual and as this research illustrates, what the entrepreneur
deems as an organization ready for outside funding may be very different from DEMO the angel
investor perceives.
Because of this gap in perception, there DEMO a few things that the entrepreneur can do to ensure
that they are ready to move into the angel process.  Given the importance of objective decision-
making criteria in the first round of decision making, entrepreneurs seeking angel financing should
at a minimum, make sure they are technologically, organizationally and strategically ready.  What
this means is that they must DEMO some sort of intellectual property (patent pending, patent,
trademark), they must have a more fully formed management team with experience, they should
have a product in the advanced stages of development, as well as some established customer base.
In addition, they should have realistic projections about the amount of capital they are seeking.
Without these baseline firm DEMO conditions, they will not have a chance of making it to
DEMO screening stage. For ventures with smaller entrepreneurial teams, higher cash burn, fewer
customers, initial stages of product development and lack of intellectual property, the urgency for
funding may be great and they may apply for angel funding too early, and hence be desk rejected.
Importantly, our DEMO suggest that those entrepreneurs who make it past the screening stage
need to pay attention to intangible factors.  Readiness at this stage is not the same as urgency for
funding, or having the base line factors such as a fully fledged top management team
(organizational), customers and a developed product (strategic) or intellectual property
(technological).  Instead, the components of readiness include other intangibles as perceived by
angels.  Therefore, entrepreneur(s) should spend time learning about the biases and subjective
DEMO of angel investors prior to attending a face-to-face screening session. Finally, DEMO
importance of location as a discriminating factor between those that move past desk rejection stage

suggests that entrepreneur(s) need to carefully consider when submitting outside their geographic
area.  The risk of desk rejection may increase proportionately to the distance from the angel group
location.
While we are confident in the DEMO of our findings, there are a number of limitations to
this DEMO  Our data are based solely on the information provided to the DEMO group by the
entrepreneur.  It does not include information that would DEMO uncovered in later stages of the
investment decision-making process.  Therefore, while we believe that our insignificant findings
for the second set of hypotheses DEMO because the decision-making criteria have changed, we need
additional data collection DEMO verify that contention.  Future research could employ different data
collection techniques, such as interviews and discourse analysis, which explore the entire decision-
making process so we can better understand the shifts in emphasis at each DEMO of decision-
making.  The data are also limited to one angel DEMO located on the east coast of the United
States.  Research has DEMO possible differences in investment patterns between east and west
coast angel groups.  Future research could include angels from other areas so that we could see if
our ideas hold in different settings.  Finally, data for DEMO research were collected in 2007-2008.
For the most part, this was DEMO the current recession.  What effects the recession has had on
private DEMO investing are not likely to be captured in these data.  Combining DEMO data with
information from the time-period of the recession would allow us to capture the effects of broad
economic changes on the angel investment DEMO
Limitations notwithstanding, this paper offers a preliminary examination of the readiness
DEMO in the angel investment process by phase.  We break the decision DEMO process up into
well defined decision stages, to give us a DEMO analysis of the process.  We find that all
aspects of readiness DEMO important at the first, administrative decision making juncture but that
these DEMO embodiments of readiness fade in importance as the new venture moves through the
decision making process.  Interestingly, however, the location of the new venture remains
consistently important; suggesting that while other criteria may change, DEMO to the new venture
remains of paramount import to the angel investor.  Future research that collects data from all of
the stages of the decision-making process would enhance our understanding of the angel
investment process.
