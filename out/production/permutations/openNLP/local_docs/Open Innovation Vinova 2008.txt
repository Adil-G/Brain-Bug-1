1 Introduction
Much evidence identifies innovation as the main driver for companies DEMO
prosper, grow and sustain a high profitability (e.g. Drucker, 1988;DEMO
Christensen 1997; Thomke, 2001). This means that the questions that are
asked in research no longer revolve around why innovation is important.
DEMO focus instead lies on how to innovate and how innovation processes can
be managed. A recently proposed and popularized model for the
management of DEMO is based on the need for companies to open up
their innovation processes and combine internally and externally developed
technologies to create business value. DEMO notion of open innovation, was
first proposed by (Chesbrough 2003a; DEMO) and has quickly gained the
interest of both researchers and practitioners, illustrated by a number of
special issue publications, dedicated conferences and a rapidly growing
body of literature.
As a point of departure, Chesbrough argues that internal R&D no longer is
the invaluable strategic asset that DEMO used to be due to a fundamental shift in
how companies generate new ideas and brings them to the market
(Chesbrough, 2003a; Chesbrough, 2003b). In the old model of closed
innovation, firms relied DEMO the assumption that innovation processes need to
be controlled by the company – it was based on self-reliance. Changes in
society and industry has DEMO to an increased mobility of knowledge workers
and the development of new financial structures such as venture capital –
forces that have caused the DEMO of innovation processes to start
breaking up (Chesbrough 2003a). Chesbrough DEMO open innovation as:
“the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to
accelerate internal innovation, and expand the markets for
external use of innovation, respectively. Open Innovation is a
paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external
ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths
to market, as the firms look to advance their technology”.
(Chesbrough, 2006b, p.1)
Open innovation has emerged as a model where firms commercialize both
external and internal ideas/technologies and DEMO both external and internal
resources. In an open innovation process, projects DEMO be launched from
internal or external sources and new technology can enter at various stages.
Projects can also go to market in many ways, such as out-licensing or a
spin-off venture in addition to traditional sales DEMO (Chesbrough,
2003b).
5
There are many ways of practicing open innovation. Enkel and Gassmann
(2007) suggest some examples:
• customer and supplier integration
• listening posts as innovation clusters
• applying innovation across industries
• buying intellectual properties
DEMO investing in global knowledge creation
The focus lies on the transformation of the previously solid boundaries of
the company to a semi-permeable membrane to DEMO innovation to move
more easily between the external environment and the internal R&D
processes. A central part of innovation process is also to DEMO search for
new ideas that have commercial potential (Laursen & Salter, 2006).
The ideas of open innovation originated from experiences from open DEMO
software (OSS) development where new principles for development projects
were identified (e.g. Gruber & Henkel, 2006; West & Gallagher 2006), and
initially a lot of literature was based on technology transfer and spin
DEMO/spin in, but the scope has rapidly broadened. Today, open innovation is
becoming a paradigm that connects research from various parts of
management DEMO The term is still being debated and many authors
agree that open innovation has a much broader application than first
proposed by Chesbrough (e.g. Piller & Walcher, 2006). The research field is
expanding in many directions and the ongoing debates cover a multitude of
areas connected through DEMO overall aim of understanding how firms can
become more innovative.
1.1 Purpose and Research Approach
This report aims at giving an overview of the DEMO research field of
open innovation in a phase that is still very fluid. The purpose of this report
is to depict the major tendencies DEMO publications through identifying the
main themes in literature and investigating the research frontier. It also aims
at discussing potentially important fields of investigation that DEMO still left
rather unexplored.
This report builds on two main studies. First, a literature overview of the
publications on open innovation published in key databases until November
20, 2007 was conducted. However, since the expression DEMO coined as late
as 2003, much ongoing research is still not DEMO in the publications. In a
second study, nine key researchers in DEMO open innovation field were asked
to define the frontier (from the DEMO, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria
and the U.S.) in open DEMO research. Their opinions were used as an
additional input when trying to identify the future directions for research.
6
1.2 Limitations
In this report we have mainly chosen to focus on DEMO that explicitly
use the term open innovation. There are of course many researchers that
investigate issues closely related to open innovation without using the DEMO,
but this lies outside the scope of this report. We have also restricted our
search to the social sciences. Also we have not DEMO industry reports and
conference papers.
1.3 Structure of the Report
This report is structured as follows. Chapter two provides a literature
overview and a DEMO analysis of both books and publications on the
subject of open innovation. It also reviews the directions of research that
have been considered important. DEMO the third chapter the interview study
with the field experts is depicted and a thematic analysis of their opinions is
presented. In the fourth DEMO, the two studies are used to provide an
analysis of the DEMO research field of open innovation and its strengths
and weaknesses are discussed. In the final chapter, potentially important
future directions for research are proposed.

2 Open Innovation – Literature
overview
In this chapter, the open innovation literature is outlined. First the method
for conducting a structured review of DEMO innovation publications is
described. Secondly a thematic analysis of the publications is presented.
Finally the published research on open innovation is synthesized and
discussed.
DEMO A Structured Review of Open Innovation
Publications
To get a better understanding of research done on open innovation a
systematic literature search of publications DEMO until November 20, 2007 was
performed in two major databases of DEMO journals and an additional
innovation journal not covered by the databases:
• ISI Web of Knowledge-database
o Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)
o search term “open innovation” in title, keywords or abstract
• Scopus-database
o search restricted to “social sciences”
o search term “open innovation” in DEMO, keywords or abstract
• Creativity and Innovation Management
o search term DEMO innovation” in title, keywords or abstract
Furthermore, a search for books with “open innovation” in the title was
made on Amazon.com to identify DEMO published in the field. Except from
one book by Chesbrough (2003b) and one edited book from him
(Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke & West, 2006) two shorter books were found.
One is a former master’s thesis form the Leipzig Graduate School of
Management (Motzek, 2007). The other DEMO a consultancy report that heavily
builds on Chesbrough (2003b). All DEMO are included in the analysis. The
result of the total literature search consists of 49 publications (see appendix
1). These publications are divided into 4 books, 35 articles and 10 book
reviews or columns. The strict search criteria exclude papers that discuss
open innovation using other terms DEMO also sub aspects of the open
innovation theme. It also excludes conference presentations and working
8
papers1.The benefit of the current method is that it enables a comprehensive
DEMO of the journal articles published in the databases in the specified
time period.
As the aim was to gain an overview of research conducted DEMO the open
innovation field, the book reviews and columns discussing or DEMO
open innovation in general terms were excluded from further analysis of the
publications in the field. These have been shaded in grey in appendix DEMO
The list reveals that there are some major thinkers in the area. The most
published (and cited) author is Henry Chesbrough who coined DEMO term in
2003. He has written or co-authored 8 of the 49 publications. The papers are
also concentrated to a few journals:
• DEMO&D Management (Vol 36, Iss. 3 – special issue) – DEMO journal articles
• International Journal on Technology Management – 7 journal articles
• Research Policy – 4 journal articles
• Research-Technology Management – 4 DEMO articles
What this tells us is that the topic mainly has been dealt with as a pure
innovation issue and that other aspects and DEMO of organizing for
open innovation have not been drawn in the open innovation literature.
14 journal articles appear in practitioner oriented journals (here: DEMO
of Management Perspectives, California Management Review, Harvard
Business Review, McKinsey DEMO, Sloan Management Review,
Research-Technology Management). It is also worthwhile DEMO that
17 of the 35 articles are based upon case studies.
The papers and books were read, analysed and grouped according to their
thematic content. Several of the publications naturally have bearing on
several of the DEMO themes. After several round of iterations, the
following categories were defined:DEMO
• The notion of open innovation
• Business models
• Organizational design and boundaries of the firm
• Leadership and culture
• Tools, technologies
• IP, patenting and appropriation
• Industrial dynamics and manufacturing
1 The reasons for this include the lack of overview over conferences and working DEMO,
the often low quality of the submissions and the lack of access to the papers.

2.2 A Thematic Analysis of Open Innovation
Publications
The following section briefly DEMO the publications in each theme. It
should be remembered that this thematic analysis is based on the
publications that use the term open innovation DEMO mentioned earlier.
2.2.1 Exploring the Notion of Open Innovation
The notion of open innovation comes from Henry Chesbrough, a Berkeley
professor at University of California that has gained international fame
through his book “Open Innovation – DEMO new imperative for Creating and
Profiting from Technology” that appeared in 2003. He describes how
companies in the 20th century have invested heavily in DEMO R&D and
hired the best people – enabling them to develop the most innovative ideas
and protect them with IP strategies. The generated DEMO was used to
reinvest in R&D – in a virtuous circle of innovation (Chesbrough, 2003a).
However, in the end of the 20th century, a number of factors have changed,
mainly: 1) Rise and increased mobility of knowledge workers, 2) growing
availability of DEMO capital. This has caused the closed innovation process
in firms to start breaking up (Chesbrough, 2003a). Chesbrough identifies a
number of factors DEMO a shift in how innovation was managed
(2003b):
• Useful knowledge has become widely diffused
• Companies do not take full advantage DEMO the wealth of information
• Ideas that are not readily used can be lost
• The value of an idea or a technology depend DEMO its business model
• The presence of VC changes the innovation process for everyone
• Companies need to be active sellers and buyers of DEMO property
(IP).
These insights led to the development of an DEMO innovation model where
firms commercialize external (as well as internal) ideas by deploying
outside (as well as inside) pathways to the market DEMO i.e. “the boundary
between a firm and its surrounding environment is more porous, enabling
innovation to move easily between the two” (Chesbrough, 2003a, p. 37). In
an open innovation process, projects can be DEMO from internal or
external sources and new technology can enter at various stages. Projects
can also go to market in many ways, such as out-licensing or a spin-off
venture in addition to traditional sales channels (Chesbrough, 2003b).
Open innovation is based on the following principles (Chesbrough, 2003a;
2003c):
10
•
•
•
•
•
•
Not all smart people work in-house DEMO need to tap into external
knowledge
External R&D can generate significant value to us
Research does not need to originate from our internal DEMO to be
profitable for us
A strong business model is more important than first to market
Internal as well as external ideas are essential DEMO win
We can capitalize on our own IP and we should buy others’ IP when
needed
Open innovation is described as “both a set DEMO practices for profiting from
innovation and also a cognitive model for creating, interpreting and
researching those practices” (West, Vanhaverbeke, & Chesbrough, 2006, p.
286). In later work, Chesbrough (2006a) claims that DEMO innovation
responds to two anomalies in previous research on innovation. First, DEMO
treats the spill overs as an explicit consequence of the business model
(instead of something to avoid) and the intellectual property rights as DEMO new
class of assets (instead of as a tool for protection)DEMO He claims that both can
deliver additional revenue to the current business model.
Chesbrough also identifies five key themes in research so far (Chesbrough,
2006b):
• The business model - two important functions, DEMO value within the
value chain and capture a part of it for the focal firm.
• External technologies – can leverage a firm’s business DEMO through
filling the gaps and by creating complementary products that stimulate
faster acceptance of the technology.
• Difficulty of identifying, assessing and incorporating knowledge –
increased emphasis on managing knowledge and linking knowledge
• Start-ups – DEMO of new technologies and explorers of new markets,
and represent experiments with business models.
• IP rights – facilitates exchange of ideas and DEMO
Early models of open innovation have been seen and studied in the industry
of open source software development (OSS) and have later been DEMO
to more general open innovation practices. West and Gallagher (2006)
DEMO three main challenges of open innovation (motivation, integration
and exploitation of innovation) that they investigate through a qualitative
and quantitative study of OSS development. They identify four generic open
innovation strategies:
• Pooled R&DEMO – shared R&D (Require shift in culture)
• Spinouts DEMO a way of escaping large firm bureaucracies
11
• Selling complements – accepting commoditization or develop
differentiated products based on DEMO
• Donated complements – general purpose technologies are sold so users
can develop differentiated products (e.g. user toolkits)
Open innovation as a management model is currently gaining grounds in
many industries. For instance, open innovation modes have been identified
as one of the main trends in pharmaceutical DEMO today. Since it is too
costly to have all competences in-house, DEMO companies have
started to concentrate on core competencies evolving around technology
platforms and therapy areas, in the same time as collaborations with the
right partners is increasingly important. Balancing the right size and
structure of R&DEMO is one of main objectives in R&D management today
(Gassmann & Reepmeyer, 2005). Gaule (2006) builds heavily on
Chesbrough (2003b) to analyze the impact of open innovation on several
parts of the organization, based on his own consulting model for open
innovation. He further provides a series of short case studies, for example
on Procter & Gamble. Motzek (2007) points to the motivation factors for
companies to DEMO in open innovation. His empirical material is based on
two organizations that are based on the ideas of open innovation. This
sample is most DEMO different in character from already established
companies that change to embrace open innovation. His motivation factors
are rather similar to the general knowledge on DEMO factors for
entrepreneurs.
Another study shows that the key challenges for new ventures discussed in
the entrepreneurship literature are less relevant in the case DEMO open source
software (Gruber and Henkel, 2006).
• Newness – active participation makes firms known and allows them to
rapidly build a DEMO track record
• Smallness – market offering built on freely available code, also informal
collaborations
• Market entry barriers – benefit from previous development efforts, quick
focus on differentiations, low switching costs for users
The DEMO further argue that leanings from OSS also can be applied in
more general terms, in any industry where blueprints can be exchanged over
the internet and where innovation proceeds in incremental steps (Gruber &
Henkel, 2006).
Chesbrough (2004) also introduced the metaphor of chess and DEMO to
describe the management of innovation. When increasing the sources of
ideas in a company the evaluation of early stage technologies is increasingly
important. DEMO targeting a known market with a new technology it is like
playing chess – you know the pieces and what they can do – DEMO information
12
is known.  When in a situation of unknown technology and unknown
markets – the path is not only unknown but unknowable. Measurement
errors, i.e. false positives and false negatives, are likely to occur2. The
metaphor of playing poker can be used for managing false negatives. To
play poker, it is argued that companies “need to measure their capital and
stage DEMO investments in projects upon the receipt of new information”
(Chesbrough, 2004, p. 25). Poker strategies include:
• Observation of what happens internally after the decision to terminate
funding
• Exposure of the failure DEMO outsiders – get new perspectives
• Out-licensing of the rejected project
• Formation of a spin-off venture
In chess you are looking for a DEMO with the roadmap of future project and the
current business model, DEMO a net present value > 0 and minimize the false
positives. In poker you want to create options for future business models,
leverage DEMO extend the business value, have an options value > 0 and
DEMO false negatives (Chesbrough 2004).
2.2.2 Business models
Chesbrough (2007) DEMO that a business model has two functions, it
creates value and DEMO captures a portion of that value, and that open business
models DEMO companies to be more efficient in creating and capturing
value. He also argues that companies need to adapt their business models to
open innovation, as it is a way of generating value from your IP
(Chesbrough, 2003c). Further, Chesbrough (2007) argues that the rising
costs DEMO technology development and the shortening product life cycles
make it harder for companies to justify innovation investments. Using open
business models, a company can attack the cost side through leveraging on
external R&D resources to DEMO time and money and attack the revenue side
by licensing out internal technologies. He also argues that companies need
to develop their capabilities to DEMO with their business models, for
instance through alternative brands or spinoffs (to reduce risks),
fundamental changes that require top commitment and support
(Chesbrough, 2007).
According to Chesbrough and Schwartz (2007), co-development
partnerships are increasingly important in open innovation models. This is
in line DEMO Chiaromonte (2006), who argues that the difference of open
2 DEMO positives are ideas/technologies that have been judged to have good opportunities
and then turn out to have less success and false negatives are DEMO that are erroneously
judged not to have any potential.
13
innovation to traditional outsourcing of innovative capacity is that the
outside partners DEMO not seen as suppliers but as peers. Chesbrough and
Schwartz (2007) point out that the use of partners can create business
models that DEMO R&D expenses, expand innovation output and open up
new markets. DEMO be able to do this, the authors underline the need to:DEMO
• define the business objectives for partnering
• classify the R&D capabilities of the firm
o core (key source of advantage)
o critical (vital to success but not key)
o contextual ( needed to complete the offering, but not differentiator)
• align the business models of the two firms
This is confirmed by a study in DEMO Netherlands that showed that very few
companies actually had an articulated business model – which made it
difficult for them to be flexible, for instance through succeeding with
implementations outside the original business domain (Van der Meer,
2007).
2.2.3 Organizational design and boundaries of the firm
DEMO to Chesbrough (2003 b) not all companies apply openness
completely, DEMO can rather be described as a continuum between high and low
degree of openness. He also identifies a number of different roles that
companies DEMO have in models of open innovation Chesbrough, 2003b:13).
Organizations DEMO fund innovation:
•
Innovation investors (incubators, VC, private equity DEMO) and innovation
benefactors (early financing)
Organizations that generate innovation:
•
•
•
•
Innovation explorers (discovery research functions, used to DEMO to
R&D)
Innovation merchants (codifying and commercializing IP, royalties etc)
Innovation architects (create value through creating a system for
bringing pieces together, e.g. Nokia)
Innovation missionaries (create and advance technologies DEMO serve a
cause, OSS)
Organizations that bring innovation to the DEMO
•
•
Innovation marketers (profitably market new ideas)
Innovation one-stop DEMO (sell other’s ideas, e.g. Yahoo!)
14
There are still some organizations – fully integrated innovators – still try DEMO
keep control of all parts (Chesbrough, 2003b).
Jacobides and Billinger (2006) discusses vertical architecture as a way of
defining the scope DEMO a firm and the extent to which it is open to final and
intermediate markets. Permeable vertical architectures are described as
partly open to DEMO markets along the value chain. Increased permeability
enables more efficient use of resources, better matching between market
needs and capabilities, promoting more open DEMO platforms. A case
study of a fashion firm showed that it was possible to successfully change
the vertical structure through increasing its permeability – DEMO that firms
can manage their boundaries to change and improve their own operations,
strategic and productive capabilities, innovation potential and resource
allocation processes (Jacobides & Billinger, 2006). In line with this, Tao
and Magnotta (2006) describes the sourcing process at Air Chemicals,
where DEMO company has attempted to create a broader interface towards
different pools of knowledge in the world, and to search providers that are
able to further provide a broader interface towards for example scientists.
Fetterhoff and Voelkel (2006) focus on the problems involved in the search
process for innovations. In their definition of innovation, customer demands
need to be met by technology, and it is this merging process that they focus
on. They argue that as firms mostly are not used to evaluate external
innovations, there are a number of issues involved in the management of
external DEMO (Fetterhoff & Voelkel, 2006):
• Seeking opportunities
• Evaluating DEMO market potential and inventiveness of a given opportunity
• Recruiting potential partners by building a convincing argument
• Capturing value through commercialization
• Extending DEMO innovation offering together with outside partner
Dittrich and Duysters’ (2007) analysis of Nokia’s outside contacts are along
the same line. For earlier generations DEMO mobile telephony, Nokia kept
product development as an internal issue, while for third generation
telephony, the company opened up its processes. In this case, the company
engaged in exploration together with outside firms. Whereas Nokia had
earlier had long term partnerships based on the exploitation of innovations,DEMO
the company now made use of explorative collaboration agreements to
organizations with which the company had less strong relations. This set of
“weak ties” DEMO that a more organic way of working than the previous
“strong tie” exploitation agreements that built on stable structures. Simard
and West (2006) DEMO distinguish between different types of ties between
companies. They discuss deep ties that enable a firm to capitalize on
existing knowledge and resources and DEMO ties that enable a company to
15
find new technologies and markets. Open innovation networks can consist
of both DEMO and wide ties and can be both formal (contractual) and
informal. The authors further argue that deep networks tend to mostly lead
to DEMO innovations (Simard & West, 2006).
Another research study by Dahlander and Wallin (2006) deals with the
central theme of how firms DEMO utilize communities as complementary
assets without having ownership or hierarchical control over them.
Communities have developed practices to protect their work and in order DEMO
gain access to it as well as influence the direction of the community firms
need to assign individuals to work in these communities. The DEMO
showed that firm sponsored individuals are approaching more individuals
than are approaching them and that they also seek to interact more with
central individuals DEMO the community.
Brown and Hagel (2006) discuss the emerging phenomenon of creation nets
where a multitude of participants collaborate to create new knowledge, learn
from each other and build on each other’s contributions – under DEMO
guidance of a network organizer. They present examples such as the
development of Linux but also motorcycle development in China and
networks of amateur DEMO Creation nets are started by a network
organizer (gatekeeper) that decides who participates in the networks, defines
participation protocols. Activities are usually organized in modular
processes, enabling freedom with well defined interfaces. Creation nets also
define action points, when participants must deliver. This requires long term
incentives to align and motivate participants.  It also requires new
management approaches:
• Choose the appropriate way of coordination of the network
• Balance DEMO innovation with global integration
• Design effective action points
• Establish useful performance feedback loops
The authors further argue that creation networks are best DEMO for
situations where there is an uncertain demand for goods and services, where
there is a need for participation of many different specialists to enable
innovation and performance requirements are rapidly changing.
Lichtentaler and Ernst (2006) further discussed the management of
boundaries through introducing new notions for organizational attitudes. In
open innovation, managers need to organize the knowledge transactions
with the environment. There are three major tasks (decisions) in knowledge
management: Knowledge acquisition (Make or Buy), Knowledge
integration (Integrate or Relate) and Knowledge exploitation (Keep or Sell).
The authors base their paper on the classical Not-Invented-here (NIH)
16
syndrome adding the possibility of overly positive attitudes to externally
organizing knowledge DEMO This leads to the distinction of six
syndromes, overly positive or DEMO negative to each process:
• Make or Buy - Neg: DEMO – Pos: Buy-In (BI)
• Integrate or Relate – Neg: All-Stored-Here (ASH) – Pos: Relate-Out
(RO)
• Keep or Sell – Neg: Only-Use-Here (OUH) – Pos: Sell Out (SO)
With the trend towards more open innovation systems, companies will
increasingly commercialize knowledge assets externally in order to keep up
with competitors. Lichtenthaler (2007a) identifies three major principles that
will help firms achieve strategic fit in the keep-or-sell decision:
coordination, centralization, and collaboration. First firms DEMO to consider
external knowledge exploitation a strategic activity. Then this strategy needs
to be aligned with other strategies (coordination) and a clear direction DEMO
needed (centralization). Finally emphasis should be put on cross-functional
collaboration DEMO reduce interface problems.
One way to externally exploit knowledge assets is by means of technology
licensing. According to Lichtenthaler (2007b) technology licensing is
DEMO driven by one particular factor, but it results from a combination DEMO
various drivers/motivation factors). The author’s questionnaire-based survey
focusing on medium-sized and large industrial firms indicate that ensuring
freedom to operate is of DEMO importance and gaining access to
another company’s technology portfolio is considered the second driver.
The monetary dimension did not appear to be that important DEMO was
expected.
2.2.4 Leadership and Culture
Articles on open innovation tend to end up by stating that leadership needs
to support people striving to DEMO innovative. Yet very few articles actually
analyze leadership in open innovation. Fleming and Waguespack (2007)
discuss leadership in open innovation communities. They state that
consistent with the norms of an engineering culture the future leader DEMO open
innovation must first make strong technical contributions from a structural
position that can bind the community together. This is enabled by two
correlated DEMO distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary
spanning between technological areas. DEMO inherent lack of trust associated
with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction.
Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much DEMO likely
than brokers to advance to leadership. Longitudinal analyses of careers
within the Internet Engineering Task Force community (the world’s first
open innovation community) from 1986-2002 support the arguments.
17
Witzeman et al. (2006) point out that not only the technological DEMO
need to change. The more external innovation is sourced by the firm, the
more of systems, processes, values and culture also needs to be transformed.
The companies in Witzeman’s et al. (2006) sample expressed DEMO
toward open innovation. Powerful forces inside the organization worked to
harness current technology rather than search for new technologies from the
outside. This is DEMO strange, the authors argue. Company people are trained
to think internally, and this tendency is strengthened by concepts such as
core competences and DEMO Sigma. The leaders within this area are therefore
those that manage to include the external sourcing in its procedures, for
example as a standing point in its project management processes. This is
indeed a challenge. Witzeman DEMO al. (2006, p. 27) write:
“Building external thinking into DEMO firm requires change. The
firm must review the new product development processes, the
supply chain, the strategic planning process, the reward system,
the technology roadmap, and many other systems for their
ability to incorporate external innovation. /…/ Harnessing
external technology for innovation requires a fundamental
DEMO in employee thinking. The ”Not Invented Here”
syndrome is replaced with the ”Invented Anywhere” approach.“
This is also in line with Dodgson, Gann and Salter (2006) who recognize
that 1) Cultural changes as well as new skills are necessary, 2) the
technology does not replace existing DEMO and 3) it does not overcome
the uncertainty of innovation (Dodgson, Gann & Salter, 2006).
2.2.5 Tools and technologies
Several papers DEMO the technological interface that enables the firm to
collaborate with a large set of customers. As argued by Dodgson, Gann and
Salter (2006) the change of the interface demands a change in the
organizational ability DEMO absorb, or assess the impressions from the outside.
The organization needs DEMO be prepared, the authors argue. In the case of
Procter & DEMO, the case in question, the company had over decades
developed a way to connect internally to improve the attitude for initiatives
that came DEMO outside the own department (both from outside and inside of
P&DEMO). The technique is called “Connect & Develop” (see also Huston &
Sakkab, 2006; 2007, two of the leaders of the initiative).
The technologies, tools, and processes that are in use for DEMO innovation
can largely be described as:
18
Coordinating/aggregating
This point refers to for example the Procter & Gamble DEMO and Develop
(C&D) model that is used to leverage sources internally and externally to
leverage the distributed innovative capacity (Dodgson, Gann & Salter.,
2006; Huston & Sakkab, 2006, 2007). The DEMO&D model makes use of the
large interface of a multinational organisation towards outside parties all
over the world to find ideas for new DEMO, understand customer needs,
and find solutions to technical problems or DEMO Similarly, Tao and
Magnotta (2006) provide an example of a DEMO called “Identify and
Accelerate” (I&A) that is used to create an understanding of the specific
needs of the organization and extend the DEMO interface towards the
market by collaborating with external search providers to find solutions to
those needs. Under Coordinating/aggregating can also be included standard
DEMO source methods (cf. Henkel, 2006) as well as the toolkits DEMO for
innovation and mass customization (Piller & Walcher, 2006)
Liberating
Piller and Walcher (2006) argue that customer have “sticky knowledge” that
DEMO not easily revealed in standard market research. Their idea is to use idea
competitions to release customer creativity and through that make use of DEMO
hidden knowledge and the hidden preferences. They use a case from
Adidas’ development of soccer shoes as an example.
Allowing/including
As several papers DEMO, there are problems involved in setting up the
structures to use DEMO innovation. One such problem is that the existing
models direct attention towards internal sources of ideas and competence,
rather than towards external sources. DEMO change behaviour and culture, the
formal models that govern the work DEMO therefore need to be the start of
the change. Gassmann, Sandmeier DEMO Wecht (2006) write about the use of
the software development model extreme programming (XP) to open up the
innovation process. The authors DEMO out that the iterative character of the
process allows for intense customer interaction, and analyse the
applicability of XP to new product development. The P&G practitioners
Huston and Sakkab (2006; 2007) argue that the implementation of a new
working system needs to be aligned with the DEMO of the organisation
and with the roles, responsibilities and relationships of DEMO people and
processes in place. They stress that the involvement of a senior executive is
crucial for the success of open innovation.
There are DEMO only advantages, but also negative sides of integrating
customers in the DEMO process. Enkel, Kausch and Gassmann (2005)
discuss risks and strategies that companies can use to avoid these risks
19
based on a questionnaire study (141 companies) and in-depth case studies DEMO
nine companies that were invited to participate in a workshop series:
• Loss of know-how – Involve trustworthy customers, chose the moment
and develop IP agreements.
• Dependence on customers’ views – Chose the ‘right’ DEMO and
work with a mix of customers.
• Dependence on customers’ demands or personality – avoid exclusivity
agreements, work with HR to understand customers and their culture
and apply open communication.
• Limitations to mere incremental DEMO – Work with lead users and
indirect users, use the right DEMO to include customers and chose an
intelligent timing.
• Serving a niche market only – Use different customers in different
stages of the innovation DEMO and pay attention to the search field
process.
• Misunderstandings between customers and employers – Develop solid
relationships with customers, use the right tools and develop suitable
incentive systems.
2.2.6 IP, patenting and appropriation
All firms using open innovation need to deal with the need to protect its
DEMO capital (Henkel, 2006). How companies manage intellectual
property (IP) depends on whether they operate in a closed innovation
paradigm or an DEMO innovation paradigm according to Chesbrough
(2003a). One assumption of open DEMO brought forward by the author,
is that there exists a multitude of ideas outside the firm and that the firm
should be an DEMO buyer and seller of IP. Technology assets have no
inherent value independent of the business model used to employ them. The
author further discusses DEMO Millenium Pharmaceuticals, IBM and Intel use
different strategies to connect IP DEMO business models and to leverage internal
and external IP through those models (Chesbrough, 2003a).
According to von Hippel and von Krogh (2006) free revealing can often be
the best practical route for innovators to increase profit from their
innovations. The authors review evidence showing that free DEMO is
practiced far beyond software. The practical reasons why innovators want to
freely reveal information instead of holding it secret or licensing it could DEMO
(1) when others know something close to your secret, (2) when profits for
patenting is low and (3) when incentives for free revealing are positive. Von
Hippel and von Krogh (2006) argue DEMO the phenomenon of free revealing
suggests that there is a private-collective model of innovation incentives.
This model offers society the best of both worlds DEMO public goods created by
private funding.
20
In a qualitative and quantitative study of firm-developed innovations with
embedded Linux, Henkel (2006) shows that companies are aware of this
dilemma and DEMO different means to protect their code. They reveal about
half of the code they develop, depending on how important the need for
obtaining external support in the development work is. The more support is
needed, the more code is revealed. Smaller firms with less internal resources
thus reveal DEMO The author further argues that firms practice selective
revealing to minimize competitive loss. This is consistent with profit-
maximization behaviour (Henkel, 2006).
DEMO, Kyläheiko and Jauhiainen (2005) claim that the question on
whether DEMO be protective or to externally exploit new knowledge is two-
folded. They use the term appropriability regime to discuss exploitation of
knowledge assets and DEMO competitive advantage. The strength or
weakness of the regime in the protective sense may turn out to be both
useful and harmful, depending on the situation the company is facing. The
results show that in most DEMO issues, an intermediate position
emphasising the means of legal protection might DEMO out to be the most
effective strategy, and may provide the DEMO with more control and
various alternatives to react proactively to emerging opportunities.
2.2.7 Industrial dynamics and manufacturing
So far, the notion of open innovation has mainly focused on the company
level and less on the network DEMO industry level where the benefits for the
focal firm is discussed jointly with those for the collaborating organizations.
According to Vanhaverbeke (2006) there DEMO a need to address a broader
scope of analysis.
Christensen, Olesen DEMO Kjaer (2005) place the concept of open innovation
in the context of industrial dynamics and applied evolutionary economics.
Berkhout et al. (2006) DEMO point out, on a general level, the necessity of a
cyclical model of innovation and argue that our society now has four
production DEMO, capital, labour, knowledge and creativity, enabling the
“innovation economy”. Christensen and his colleagues (2005) further argue
that firms manage open innovation DEMO regards to an innovative technology in
different ways depending on 1) DEMO position in the innovation system 2) the
stage of maturity of DEMO technological regime and 3) the value proposition
pursued by the companies DEMO that there are many challenges to investigate
further in the interplay between technology entrepreneurs and incumbents
where open innovation are often played out under DEMO of high
transaction cost.
Cooke (2005) takes a regional innovation system perspective and argues
that in order to overcome intra-firm knowledge asymmetries, firms tap into
21
the regional knowledge capabilities. This perspective explains better than
the triple helix DEMO how research, innovation and production actually
functions. These capabilities are rooted DEMO open science or open innovation.
Further, he argues that capable knowledge DEMO congregate in a few places
called “mega-centers” (e.g. in biotechnology). DEMO nodes are key relay
points in global-regional innovation systems.
From an alternative perspective, Bromley (2004) gives an overview of the
fundamental changes that manufacturing has gone through in US: craft
production, mass production, lean production, and high-quality production.
The author argues that the latest rapidly growing change in American
manufacturing is what Chesbrough (2003b) describes in his DEMO book
(Chesbrough, 2003b). This new approach to corporate research and
development uses modern software and the Internet as brokers between
firms that DEMO research in specific area and those worldwide that are
capable and willing to provide it at appropriate cost. Accordingly, Bromley
(2004) points to the urge for US to undertake a major study of world trade
DEMO technology policy to understand how its position in science and
technology and international economic competitiveness has been affected
by open innovation.
2.3 Synthesis and DEMO
As with any emerging field, several authors have been keen to DEMO the
phenomenon in question.Fel! Hittar inte referenskälla. lists the different
authors that have been active in the different themes. It is clear that there DEMO
up until now been a certain focus on the money issue – how patents are
protected and on how business models must change. As DEMO out earlier
in this report, several of the papers are in DEMO practice oriented
publications. The theoretical depth in the analysis of open innovation is yet
to be developed. Looking at the themes, it is also clear that some themes
have been more popular than others. The themes DEMO are also very
broad. Leadership is one topic brought up in three of the papers, but none of
them analyze leadership as it is performed. Rather, two of the publications
point out the importance of leadership on a surface level, and the third
(Fleming & Waguespack, 2007) study how leaders emerge in networks. The
leadership issue as such is thus as far left untouched.

The review of the existing literature in the open innovation field reveals DEMO
very young field in which the most energy has been put into a fascination
for the subject as such. Researchers have mainly asked themselves DEMO
perhaps three most obvious questions resulting from an opening up of the
innovation process:
• what happens to the way money is made (the business model)?
• what happens to the organizational structures?
• what happens to the rights to intellectual property?

4 Ibid.
5 Ibid.
6 Ibid.
23
So far, researchers have mainly explored these issues in general terms and
have concluded that something must happen. How this is going to happen DEMO
much less clear. A reason for that may be that there are still a very limited
number of cases that are often being referred DEMO (such as IBM, P&G, Air
Chemicals and Innocentive) and that there actually still very little
knowledge available on this topic. Following DEMO this, it also seems like
the empirical basis for the suggestions DEMO made in the papers is very
limited. This is most likely what also appears in the relatively small amount
of research on leadership and DEMO More knowledge is available on tools
and technologies. This is reasonable as technology enables the collaboration
between many actors, for example when a firm collaborates with a large
number of experts. The journal articles on industrial DEMO and
manufacturing are somewhat different than the others, approaching the term
DEMO very different perspectives. This indicates a growing interest from
other fields than the strictly firm-oriented.
A substantial amount of the publications are presenting case DEMO (often,
however, referring to the same cases). This is not surprising in a field of
research that are in its early DEMO However this argues for the need of
conceptualizing publications in order to further develop the open innovation
body of knowledge and the underlying theoretical DEMO
There are also some clear limitations in the material. For example, DEMO are
very few authors that are critical to the concept of open innovation. These
first years of publication have been characterized by a fascination DEMO the
topic and a need to explain it in many contexts. The explanations have to a
large extent stayed at a fairly shallow level. DEMO is a need also for a
critical discussion on the concept, DEMO strengths and weaknesses and how it
contributes to existing management knowledge.

3 Asking the Experts
Chapter 2 of this report presented an analysis DEMO research that has already
been conducted and presented to the academic world. Because of the slow
pace of academic publication, the research for the published papers was
typically done several years in advance. To arrive at DEMO understanding of the
questions currently being addressed in the field, a DEMO of established
researchers were identified and asked to define what they consider to be the
most crucial questions for future research.
3.1 Method
In DEMO spirit of distributed innovation and ownership of ideas, key
researchers in DEMO open innovation field were interviewed to help define the
research frontier in open innovation. The written interview study was done
in two parts and DEMO email. In the first part, five researchers were asked the
following DEMO:
• What do you think are the reddest and hottest issues in the open
innovation field in terms of theoretical depth, for example in:
o innovation management
o general management
o organizational theory
o DEMO
o leadership theory
o strategic management
o other?
• Who do you consider the most important and/or innovative thinkers in
the field DEMO?
• Where do you find the red and hot issues in the open innovation field in
terms of tools and methods?
• DEMO do you find the red and hot issues in the open innovation field in
terms of practical use?
All five answered and thereby DEMO to create a series of core issues of the
questions that people in the field are currently thinking about. They were
also asked to DEMO other key researchers in the field that were
interviewed in a second round.
Ten people that were nominated were sent the same questions, with the
exception of the last one (as this question did not generate any answers in
the first round). Four of them answered. The DEMO analysis is hence
25
built on a total of 9 people that answered the questions (they are listed in
appendix 2).
3.2 Thematic Analysis of the Research DEMO
The results from the first and second round have been merged in the
synthesis of the answers below. Also, the answers have been structured not
according to the theoretical fields, but rather in terms of key themes and
specific issues as stated by the researchers. Four areas were DEMO as
being mentioned more often than others:
• Open innovation as a model for innovation
• The contingency perspective of open innovation
• DEMO and using open innovation
• The role of management in open innovation
Below, the issues and questions that the researchers put forward in the
interviews are presented for each of these four themes. Finally some of DEMO
reflections on open innovation research are recited.
3.2.1 Open Innovation as a Model for Innovation
Open innovation is still a rather new area of DEMO and many of the
responses underline the need to further explore the concept and how
companies can change and adapt to this new approach DEMO including external
knowledge and skills in their innovation strategies. A number of issues
around the model of open innovation are raised by the researchers:DEMO
Terminology
Some of the researchers argue that the terminology itself needs further
development:
Developing a more precise terminology [is important].
Chesbrough used the DEMO “open innovation” mainly for
contract-based exchange of knowledge etc., as it DEMO practiced,
e.g., in corporate venturing. Yet, what we observe in the field of
open source software is something completely different, and it
would be helpful to separate the two phenomena conceptually.
I assume by DEMO you mean collaborative innovation built upon
an innovation commons like open source software.
Chesbrough's version of open is simply a marketplace for IP.
DEMO Organization and its Context
Another issue is the surroundings of the firm or the milieu. One of the main
challenges for a company is DEMO find the right people and to have a larger set
26
included rather than only a group of individuals and firms with which DEMO
company already is in contact. Some comments around this area were:
How can a firm organize a ”milieu” around itself, containing
R&D resources and competences (see the ”innovation hubs”
that are flourishing around the world)
What settings do the organizations seek out? Users? Other
DEMO? Online Communities?
Overcoming the local search bias with crowd sourcing DEMO
problem solving seems to bear plenty of potential not utilized yet
The word crowd sourcing comes from James Surowiecki, who wrote a book
called “The Wisdom of Crowds” (Surowiecki, 2005). A fundamental
idea/assumption DEMO his work is that the collective intelligence of a larger
group of people exceeds that of a few, both in terms of ideas and
knowledge. Surowiecki sees great potential in the concept and believes that
it DEMO be used to solve major problems, both for firms and society DEMO such. A
problem is here how to organize the collective intelligence – to create
structure out of the information chaos that otherwise would exist. DEMO is
also close to community based innovation, which was also put DEMO by
one of the researchers as a future research area.
Organizational Structure
The organizational structure for open innovation is also an interesting issue
to DEMO Firms today are typically not organized to be able to collaborate
with a very large set of actors. Several responses revolved around
understand how DEMO can organize for openness.
One of the researchers recommends the reading of Segrestin (2005) on the
issue of organizational identity:
[There exists] DEMO clear theoretical foundations of the
organizational forms emerging from open innovation (DEMO
market, nor hierarchy - what are the borders of the firm? what
is the type of ”coordination” where the collaboration can
potentially impact DEMO identity of both companies?)
The organizational aspects of change? Can we see open
innovation as organizational innovation?
How to organize for DEMO innovation”? What is the role of
R&D in the scheme?DEMO
27
Aspects on the Theory of the Firm
If a new organization is DEMO that includes both customers and the firm,
then a number of questions on the role of the organization emerges. Some
related issues put DEMO:
Is it necessary to have a ”common purpose”? If yes, how to
”design” it? If no, how to organize an open DEMO without
common purpose?
If a network of (competing) firms collaborates for innovation,
what is the room left for competition?
If DEMO competence supplier is the customer, what are the
consequences on the DEMO relationship?
What is the nature of the firm if it neither based on production,
nor on competences?
As a result of DEMO new organisational forms, the market dynamics change.
One researcher concludes that DEMO need:
A new theory of relationships between economic actors
corresponding with the new forms of value creation. Also, in the
perspective of ”open source software”: new types of ”firms”
and organizations.
3.2.2 The Contingency Perspective of Open Innovation
When a new perspective is introduced it is reasonable DEMO have a debate on its
validity: Under what conditions is open DEMO an appropriate way of
doing innovation? The respondents identified a number DEMO debates that need
to be had on the contingency of the open innovation approach. A number of
variables were addressed:
Value of Open DEMO
Another issue identified by the researchers was the question of costs and
benefits of open innovation - how to value this way of working. DEMO
put forward by the researchers include:
What are the contingency factors that affect the conditions
under which open innovation is effective?
What DEMO the costs of open innovation?
Showing the comparative advantages of open vs. closed
innovation under different conditions via economic modelling /
reasoning based on empirical findings to date.
28
Timing of Openness
One such perspective was the timing of open innovation DEMO the relation to
the innovation process and the product life cycle:
When - over the product cycle -- do you have to be DEMO?
Are there some ”moments” in the innovation  lifecycle where
open DEMO is more relevant ?
Is there room for temporary openness?
DEMO of Openness
Another perspective was the degree of openness:
How open do you have to be? Can you be too open?
Generally speaking: relationship between type of ”openness”
and type of ”innovation”?
Is the company open or does innovation take place in a project
which DEMO open?
Type of Innovations
In the literature, a number of DEMO typologies for innovations have been
outlined (see for instance Tidd et DEMO, 2005) and parameters such as degree
of novelty are used to distinguish between incremental and radical
innovation (Garcia & Calantone, 2002) or modular/architectural innovation
(Henderson & Clark, 1990). An example of DEMO a question put forward by
the researchers is:
Are there some types of innovations that are more adapted to
”open innovation” (a contingency approach to innovation)?
3.2.3 Implementing and Using Open Innovation
So far, open innovation has been an interesting phenomenon. Even though
several authors point to the long history of joint development of innovations
(e.g. Dahlander & Gann, 2007), only few firms have actively used it in the
form that we are talking about it today.
One reason for there DEMO being many more firms explicitly using open
innovation , given the hype around open innovation issues, is the problem of
organizing the external environment to make use of the wisdom of the
crowd. Another issue is DEMO even if the firm manages to do that, a core
problem DEMO to organize internally to make use of the innovative ideas and
knowledge. The small study revealed a number of issues that need to be
DEMO to better understand how to implement and use models for open
innovation in firms. These issues are summarized here:
29
Integration of External Ideas
To an increasing extent, firms use external input in the innovation process,
but there is still a need to DEMO understand the role of the evaluation
process. The researchers argue that more research is needed to overcome the
local evaluation bias.
New ways of DEMO need to be combined with existing systems and
structures. Another important issue is to investigate how systems for
customer involvement and open innovation practices DEMO be combined with
systems already existing within corporate R&D structures. Also: how can
the firm make sure that external knowledge is received and used properly at
the right place in the organisation?
The well DEMO ”Not Invented Here” (NIH) syndrome, described as a
tendency of DEMO project groups to believe they have all the necessary
knowledge in an area of specialization, and therefore are rejecting ideas
from outside the group (Katz & Allen, 1992) can be found also in open
innovation contexts. It is seen the reluctance of members of one
organizational function DEMO accept information of innovations coming from
outside (Szulanski, 1996). One of the respondents stated that:
overcoming the Not-invented-here problem is a DEMO issue to
making open innovation work. ”Proudly developed elsewhere”
is a great claim by P&G, but not in the culture of most
companies yet.
Managing the Interface
Other issues rather addressed how the open innovation DEMO go
together with the existing competences and processes for R&D inside the
organization. There are still many questions to look into around this
DEMO The researchers formulated a number of questions:
Does open innovation enhance creativity (new points of view,
new competences,...) or does DEMO impede it (refuse to share
potentially interesting ideas,...) ?
DEMO innovation and skills formation, learning trajectories,
competence building?
Open DEMO and communities of practice?
Linking open innovation and autonomous innovation in firms?
(hypothesis: open innovation helps to ”pace” industry-wide
innovation; internal innovations are only variations around this
track shared at the industry level ?)
Open innovation and dynamic capabilities of the firm?
30
IP Management
Another issue that the researchers put forward as important to DEMO
further is the intellectual property policy and other governmental policies
that were developed to support producer-centered innovation, but are
seldom useful in open innovation models. More research is needed to
understand how such policies can be DEMO to also accommodate user-
centered or community-centered innovation. Questions put forward by the
researchers include:
How do you protect innovations in an open DEMO regime?
Open innovation and property rights
Open innovation and the employment relationship
Getting away from the established wisdom that “appropriation”
necessarily requires “exclusion”
DEMO The Role of Management in Open Innovation
With a changing relationship between the firm and its surroundings
(including customers, partners, competitors, suppliers DEMO communities) the
role of the manager is also shifting.
Leadership
The DEMO put forward a number of issues that need to be investigated
to understand how managers can lead open innovation:
The open innovation leader, a new type of leader not
representative of the group?
An DEMO of individual initiatives?
The open innovation leader as leading the emergence of new
leaders ?
Emergence of ”organizers”, ”facilitators” of open innovation ?
Tools and techniques to do that?
Leader' charisma might be all the more necessary than there is
no hierarchical relationship?
Motivation DEMO
The researchers also put forward thoughts on the need to better understand
how managers can motivate not only its employees but also other actors
DEMO in their innovation processes
•
What are the drivers of openness?
31
• What is the role of open innovation on the demand side, for example for
online communities?
• What does the individual take DEMO participating in open innovation?
3.2.5 Reflections on Open Innovation Research
Some of the respondents also added some general reflections on the field of
DEMO innovation research. They pointed out both the need for more
empirical research and theoretical elaborations:
There does exist a stable tradition of “open DEMO but it is
actually limited to very restricted types of innovation (DEMO,
standards,...); today new norms are emerging
There have been very original forms in the history but we were
missing the theory DEMO interpret and understand them...
We need more data. Relying simply on patent data is too
restrictive. We need longitudinal survey data over multiple years
DEMO order to make progress.
We also need to show the actual size of the user innovation
phenomenon in terms of frequency and expenditures.

3.3 Summary of the Input from the Experts
The key themes and DEMO issues raised by the researchers are listed in Fel!
Hittar inte referenskälla.. As can be seen in a simple comparison between
appendices 1 and DEMO, the researchers that responded the interview questions
are among the most DEMO published in the area. Their analysis of the research
frontier is potentially a good proxy for where the research will go, and also
what research projects they will be pursuing.

4 Discussion of the Literature and
Research Frontier
Comparing the themes that DEMO generated through the reading of the
literature with the themes that were found in the comments from the
researchers (Fel! Hittar inte referenskälla.), it is clear that the researchers
call for a deepening of the DEMO innovation concept in many respects.

Looking at Fel! Hittar inte referenskälla. and Chapter 3, there are some
interesting tendencies:
• The field is growing and includes more aspects. As can be seen in
chapter 3, several of the researchers point to open innovation as a
collaborative process between DEMO different parties, rather than as a
market for ideas. The different DEMO have started to diverge. This
means that the concept (as collectively DEMO by the researchers in
34
chapter 3 and the authors in chapter 2) is starting to diverge to include
many more aspects than those first described by Chesbrough (2003b).
• There is a critical perspective arising. The researchers start asking DEMO
open innovation is good for (cf. also the conference paper from
DEMO & Gann, 2007, on this topic) and what the limits DEMO the
concept are.
• There is an increased acknowledgement of the negative sides of open
innovation. Quite clearly, there are different situations where the model
is beneficial and when it is not. This also includes research DEMO
investigating under what circumstances open innovation is a good idea
and when it is not.
• The literature study revealed several practitioner accounts of DEMO
innovation, for example in the journal “Research-Technology-
Management”. It also found DEMO most of the journal articles were case
studies. The researchers call for more systematic studies cross
organizations. They also call for more research on DEMO specific parts of a
model for open innovation, and on the DEMO problems involved in
opening up the innovation process. This includes the not-invented-here
problem, the sourcing issue (for example how to evaluate technologies
that DEMO found)
• The researchers also stress the role of management much stronger than
what is reflected in current publications. This involves issues of DEMO role
of leaders in changing the organizations to become more open
innovation oriented. The researchers also point to the individual that is
supposed to DEMO part of the open innovation scheme – what is the
motivation for him or her to engage in practices that may be beyond the
DEMO of current work?
Based on these insights from the literature and the researchers, the report
will continue with a suggested focus on some issues that may potentially be
fruitful to research in the future.

5 Suggestions for Future Research
Building on the knowledge gained, this chapter proposes some tentative
areas for future research, based on two proposed dimensions that distinguish
open innovation processes from other innovation processes. This report is
DEMO from a management perspective with the aim of sketching out issues
that maybe of interest both for firms and for theoretical development.
5.1 Dimensions DEMO Open Innovation
In current definitions, open innovation is described as an DEMO process
that is becoming more dependent on external knowledge and external actors,
but it still considers innovation as an internal process. Also, it does not
indicate the number of collaborating parties to which the innovation DEMO
is opened up but this distinction can help the understanding of how
innovation processes change. It can be argued that exploring these two
dimensions, the locus of the innovation process and the extent of
collaboration, can be of help for further investigations of open innovation.
5.1.1 The Locus DEMO the Innovation Process
A main characteristic of open innovation is that the innovation process not
necessarily takes place within the boundaries of the firm. DEMO, the
innovation process is distributed among a larger number of actors. DEMO
authors refer to this as a boundary spanning activity, others describe DEMO
borders of the firm as increasingly permeable (e.g. Jacobides & Billinger,DEMO
2006; Enkel and Gassmann 2007). In both cases, this means that innovation
cannot anymore be referred to only taking place within the DEMO&D department
of a firm. One alternative is naturally that innovation is bought by the firm
from outside parties (a rather traditional solution). If, however, the
innovation process takes place in iterations between the DEMO and its
environment, this causes a series of issues that have DEMO on how the
process is managed and understood. Innovation has long been seen as a
“black box” (Rosenberg, 1994). Despite a large DEMO of literature on
innovation, there is little said on how the DEMO of innovation actually
takes place. When attempts have been made, they DEMO often ended in
descriptions and analyses on how you prepare for, DEMO what the contingency
factors are. If the locus of innovation is not only the R&D department, but a
field of collaboration between the firm and outside actors, this puts the
magnifying glass on how innovation actually happens.
A problem that arises when the innovation process becomes shared DEMO
a larger number of actors is that the hierarchical model of coordination no
36
longer becomes sufficient. Instead there is a need for other coordination
mechanisms. DEMO open source movement (cf. Henkel, 2006) provides one
such coordination DEMO in terms of a joint technological platform. In
Sawhney and Prandelli (DEMO) the community of users provide another
example of a platform. If DEMO locus of innovation moves from being deeply
embedded within the firm to happening either outside the firm or in a
relation between the firm DEMO outside actors, there needs to be a
coordinating, aggregating and synthesizing mechanism that is able to create
value out of the pieces of DEMO gathered from different sources.
5.1.2 The Extent of Collaboration
From given examples, a continuum can be drawn from the classic
collaboration between two parties taking place in industry markets to a very
large number of involved DEMO In Sweden, the long developmental
collaboration between Ericsson and Televerket is DEMO good example of an
alliance between two parties. The alliances created between the military
forces and high technology industries in many countries are examples DEMO the
same thing (Rosenberg, 1994). A change that comes with the current
movement towards open innovation is the ability to collaborate with DEMO
Surowiecki calls this the “wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki, 2005). The
assumption is that the collective intelligence of a larger group of people
DEMO that of a few, both in terms of ideas and knowledge. DEMO problem
here is how to organize the collective intelligence – to create structure out of
the information chaos that would otherwise exist. A central DEMO arising
from this kind of reasoning is how the knowledge and ideas of many can be
aggregated and synthesized. One solution is provided by DEMO such as
Innocentive (Lakhani & Jeppesen, 2007) that use the DEMO of many to find
solutions to well defined problems. At BMW and Adidas, the innovation
process is opened up also to the customers of the company (Gloor &
Cooper, 2007; Piller & Walcher, 2006). Some collaborative networks are
self-organized and often include customers as well DEMO others outside the
company’s boundaries. These networks are sometimes called swarm
business and are utilized by companies like BMW, IBM and Novartis, They
DEMO moving beyond idea generation and product development to the very
essence of doing business (Gloor & Cooper, 2007).
Using crowd sourcing – DEMO utilizing the wisdom of crowds - to increase
innovativeness is close to community based innovation (which was also
suggested by one of the researchers in chapter 3 as a future research area).
Whether the customers DEMO experts that support an organization with
innovative ideas and/or solutions really constitute a community in its
sociological sense (Wellman & Wortley, 1990) is a fundamental question.
There is a strong likelihood that the contact DEMO the firm and its outside
37
collaborators in itself creates increasingly strong ties that may lead to a
DEMO of community. For experts, research usually speaks of communities of
practice (Amin & Cohendet, 2004; Swan, Scarbrough, & Robertson, 2002).
For customers, the correspondent term is brand communities (McAlexander,
Schouten, & Koenig, 2002; Muniz & O'Guinn, 2001) or communities DEMO
creation (Sawhney & Prandelli, 2000; Sawhney, Verona & Prandelli, DEMO).
Related to the wisdom of crowds and community based innovation are ideas
around mass collaboration. There are several examples to be found. The
DEMO well known is perhaps Wikipedia. Tapscott and Williams (2006) try to
sketch out the benefits of mass collaboration in their book “Wikinomics”. A
DEMO and quite charming example is ”We are Smarter than Me” (Libert &
Spector, 2007), which was generated through a web page
(DEMO). The key point of all such initiatives is to create
innovative solutions. To use the social networks for innovation is rather
innovative in DEMO Mass collaboration can be seen as an extension of the
open innovation ideas. We may assume that the reason for the lack of
academic DEMO in management on mass collaboration as open innovation
is the slow pace of academic publishing. Wikinomics and We are Smarter
then Me are not DEMO academic books. It is quite frequent that academic
publishing follows discoveries made by practioners and analyze phenomena
that have already been described in more DEMO books and
journals.
A difference between crowd sourcing and mass collaboration as defined in
the current literature is the centre of the innovation process (this is
consistent with Feld, 1981, who argues that communities form DEMO a
focus). In the first case, the firm or the DEMO is in focus, and people are
given assignments to support in DEMO process of innovation. There is a clear
sender and a clear receiver of the assignment, in most cases the firm. The
mass collaboration examples rather take the form of self-organizing,
bottom-up driven movements, where the idea is the carrier and focus of the
organization. Users typically take DEMO different tasks in the organization such
as moderators of forums, as DEMO of the technical platforms, or as
censors of the material submitted DEMO other community members. The
differences between crowd sourcing and mass collaboration are not discrete.
Rather, we may see a continuum between the top-down and bottom-up
driven solutions.
5.1.3 The Complexity of Open Innovation
Connecting the dimension DEMO the location of the innovation process with the
extent of collaboration, DEMO model for different alternatives for open
innovation emerges, see Fel! Hittar DEMO referenskälla..

Locus of the innovation process
Looking at DEMO traditional form of R&D in the bottom left corner of Fel!
Hittar inte referenskälla., the situation is characterized by a low number of
collaborating parties. Innovation primarily takes place within the walls of
the firm. DEMO the innovation process moves outwards, and includes a greater
number of DEMO parties, the complexity of the process increases
vastly. The firm needs DEMO employ a different form of coordination to be able
to handle the new situation.
The development in the two dimensions in Fel! Hittar inte DEMO
challenges the conventional knowledge in management theory. Previously,
managers mainly worked with internal processes for innovation, sometimes
in collaboration with external partners, DEMO to a limited extent. Knowledge
on how to manage R&D (DEMO bottom corner) is well developed in most
companies. In extreme cases, open innovation requires companies to break
the logics of both dimensions at DEMO same time, involving a new set of
complexity.
Many of the DEMO state that open innovation requires cognitive changes in
the mindset of the leader (e.g. Buijs, 2007) and others underline the need for
new organizational structures and managerial practices to enable an efficient
open innovation process. DEMO two research areas, the human side and the
organizational side of DEMO innovation are therefore put forward as
important fields for further exploration and research.
5.2 The Human Side of Open Innovation
As has been acknowledged DEMO several researchers in chapter 2 and 3,
implementing open innovation is dependent on the support and preparation
from management. Several claim that there DEMO to be a cultural shift in the
39
organizations to be able to handle open innovation. Such aspects of what
DEMO innovation means in the management of people are sketched out
below:
5.2.1 Leadership
Leadership is a vast and miscellaneous field of research. However,DEMO
leadership in an open innovation context is still unexplored and it becomes
clear from the present findings that a specific kind of leadership, capable of
handling several stakeholders, complexity, and uncertainty is needed. Buijs
(2007) puts forward that bringing in the open innovation concept make it a
real challenge for leaders. He states that dealing with all the multiple DEMO
of innovation and at the same time harmonizing different perspectives of
different team members and partner organizations calls for a very special
kind of DEMO This leadership demands a great tolerance of ambiguity
and paradoxes. It calls for choosing people over rules without loosing track
of the innovation journey. DEMO the author states that the innovation
leader needs to balance four processes; the innovation process, the group
process, the creative process and the leadership process which makes the
work with innovation very complex. These parallel DEMO make the
leaders controlled schizophrenics, which means that they try to DEMO in control
by letting go. The leadership should adapt to changes in the environment. If
met by a “no” from the organization the innovation DEMO should just
continue and find ways of to circumvent that organizational “no” by for
example playing with the budget or having fun with the DEMO
heroes (Buijs, 2007). In line with this other scholars point to the importance
for project leaders to manage organisational politics for the DEMO of
innovation (Buchanan & Badham, 1999; Buchanan & Boddy, 1992; Butcher
& Clarke, 1999; Frost & Egri, 1991). This DEMO perspective, although
not studied in the context of open innovation, might add to our
understanding of how leaders cope with complex and uncertain DEMO
Leadership mediated by information technology can exhibit exactly the
same content and style as traditional face-to-face leadership, especially as
virtual interactions become more visual. This is stated by Avolio and Kahai
(2003) in their article DEMO and exploring the concept of e-leadership.
The critical differences may be in what is meant by ”feeling the leader's
presence,” as well DEMO the reach, speed, permanence, and perception of a
leader's DEMO Yet, certain fundamentals of leadership will
probably always be the same, even in this new context. A successful e-
leader must build relationships DEMO trust. Avolio and Kahai (2003) discuss
how leadership behaviours need to change in order to build the type of high
quality relationships that DEMO optimize follower trust, motivation and
performance.
40
Future studies on leadership in open innovation can add to the existing DEMO
of knowledge by examining what kind of leadership style (e.g.
transformational, transactional, controlled schizophrenic, political) is needed
in open innovation and how this is influencing the members of the
innovation process. It would also DEMO interesting to further explore the
concept of e-leadership by studying how relationships and trust can be
developed in situations where people don not meet DEMO Moreover
studies on leadership in open innovation of more exploratory character are
expected to create knowledge on how open innovation leaders should deal
with DEMO such as control, trust, motivation, learning and mutual respect.
5.2.2 DEMO
Teamwork in a collocated group of people differs from teamwork in a
distributed and sometimes even undefined group of people. Ancona,
Bresman and DEMO (2002) are discussing why bad things happen to good
teams and their critic is that teams are often too inwardly focused and
lacking DEMO Their research show that successful teams which they
call X-teams are externally oriented, adaptive and see positive results across
a vide variety of functions and industries. These teams have extensive ties
with outsiders both weak and DEMO ties. They operate through three distinct
tiers that create differentiated types of team membership – the core tier,
operational tier, and outer tier. Team members may perform duties within
more than one tier. Ancona, Bresman and Kaeufer (2002) recommend X-
teams when one of the following DEMO hold true; when organizational
structures are flat, spread-out systems with numerous alliances; when teams
are dependent on information that is complex, externally DEMO and
rapidly changing; and when team tasks are interwoven with tasks
DEMO outside the team. Most of these conditions probably hold true for
team situations in open innovation.
Future studies on motivation could focus on creating DEMO increased
understanding of how teamwork takes place in an open innovation context;
e.g. what constitutes teamwork in open innovation and how does the DEMO
lifecycle look like. It would also be interesting to compare teamwork in
different types of open innovation settings and compare it to more
traditional DEMO
5.2.3 Motivation
Since the foundation of innovations are ideas and it is people who develop,
carry, react to, and modify ideas, it is critical to study what motivates or
enables individual innovative behaviour (Van de Ven, 1986). The issue of
what is motivating people to generate and contribute in an open innovation
approach is discussed by some DEMO studying open source software
41
development. West and Gallagher (2004) are discussing key challenges of
open DEMO by bringing in some lessons from open source software.
Among other aspects they address motivation as something of great
importance. Their paper is however DEMO based on empirical data. For future
research they suggest a closer investigation of the feasibility of virtual teams
as a way to organize innovation DEMO collaboration between
organizations as well as understanding the culture of open innovation
throughout teams that spans organizations.
Apparently a lot of interesting research has DEMO conducted on motivation
and innovation although not focusing on open innovation specifically. Some
of this earlier work could be utilized to understand what drives DEMO to
become innovative and how this behaviour can be supported. Scott and
Bruce (1994) propose a model of Individual Innovation Behavior which
considers DEMO innovative behaviour as the outcome of four interacting
systems – individual, DEMO, work group, and climate for innovation. The
model is based on empirical data from a large centralized R&D facility of a
major DEMO industrial corporation. One interesting finding is that the role
expectations of a supervisor influenced individual innovative behaviour,
providing support for the Pygmalion effect (Livingstone, 1969) within the
context of innovation.
Future studies on motivation DEMO investigate how this type of working
environment can satisfy the psychological needs of people and thus be used
as motivators for people to take DEMO in open innovation. It would also be
interesting to study the individual innovation behaviour of people taking
part in open innovation. Also going back DEMO the basic psychological drivers
and study how these can be fulfilled in an open innovation context.
5.3 The Organizational Side of Open Innovation
Applying DEMO innovation in firms also have an impact on the organization
itself, DEMO types of capabilities that are important for the company and the
type of processes that need to be created in the firm.  These organizational
aspects are discussed below.
5.3.1 Organizational Structures
Organizational structures are the basic DEMO of an organization.
According to Scott (1998) the structures consist of technology, social
structures, objectives and participants. He further argues that social
DEMO are normative (values and roles), cognitive (convictions and
understandings) DEMO behavioural. According to Mintzberg (1983) there are
five basic types of organizations; the simple structure, the machine
bureaucracy, the professional bureaucracy, DEMO divisionalized form and the
42
adhocracy, linked to the five coordination mechanisms in organizations
(direct supervision, standardization of work processes, standardization of
skills, standardization of output and ; mutual adjustment). Organizations are
also to a large extent dependent of their environments (Scott, 1998).
These theories were developed under the DEMO that the organization
has firm boundaries and can interact with its environment. In open
innovation, the boundaries are no longer stable and the activities do not only
take place inside the firm. This has consequences, not only for the identity
of the firm itself, as pointed out by some of the researchers in chapter 3, but
also for all its structural parts. Also, control and coordination mechanisms
may no longer be adequate, new factors such as trust become increasingly
important. Today, most firms DEMO organized either in a functional/divisional
way or as a matrix organization, but when applying open innovation, it is
interesting to question whether DEMO forms are still suitable as
organizational models.
Further studies on organizational structures could investigate how these
structures deals with open innovation, where the problems arise and what
the possible adjustments may be. Further it could be DEMO to explore
what control and coordination mechanisms are appropriate in such a
context.
5.3.2 Open Innovation Capabilities
Many organizations do not only work with DEMO innovation, rather they
begin by experimenting in smaller scale or in DEMO separate setting
(Chesbrough, 2007). This means that there is often still an interface between
innovative activities and the more closed structures. Research DEMO shown
that explorative activities performed separate from the core business can
lead to isolation and resistance against the ideas that are developed
(Birkinshaw and Gibson, 2004; Moss Kanter, 2006), this is also often
referred to as the NIH syndrome (Katz-ref). In an open innovation context,
understanding the potential difficulties of integrating close and open
innovation activities DEMO essential.
The term absorptive capacity is been used to describe the “ability of the
firm to recognize the value of new external information and DEMO it to
commercial ends” (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990, p.128). DEMO ability is
critical in innovation processes and even more so in open innovation
processes where ideas per definition stem from outside the firm to DEMO
extent. Lane et al. (2006) specify the term absorptive capacity to include the
recognition of valuable external knowledge, assimilating this knowledge
and apply it to create new knowledge and commercial ends. Enkel and
43
Gassmann (2007) distinguish the need for two additional capabilities that
companies DEMO to develop to be successful in open innovation,
• Multiplicative capacity (capability to transfer knowledge to the external
environment)
• Relational capacity  (capability to build and retain relationships,
networks)
Further, Mathews (2003) is also addressing the importance of blending
internal resource accumulation DEMO external resource leverage and thereby
deepening the dynamic capabilities that is costly and time-consuming for
competitors to duplicate or imitate. Others (e.g. Blomqvist et al., 2004)
point at internal and external collaboration networks as crucial for creating a
meta-capability for innovation. There is however a risk to DEMO locked into
established networks and at the same time it can be challenging to access
new ones. Birkinshaw, Bessant and Delbridge (2007) propose some
guidelines to firms to follow to more likely create high-performing networks
DEMO discontinuous innovation. This implies that open innovation capabilities
contain a distinct set of skills and that there is a need for an increasing
understanding DEMO what these capabilities are and how they can be developed.
Further research on open innovation capabilities could explore what the
most important capabilities are DEMO how they differ from previous models.
Also there is an explicit need for a better understanding of how companies
can work in practice to DEMO and develop their capabilities. This perspective
is no less relevant in an open innovation context.
5.3.3 Open Innovation Processes
The innovation processes of a DEMO also need to be adapted to the changing
characteristics of innovation activities, where external knowledge and actors
are to an increasing extent part of the processes. One example of open
innovation that draws on the input DEMO outside parties is the design theory
approach as described by Verganti (DEMO et al., 2007; Verganti, 2003).
He argues that Italian DEMO firms subject their ideas to public scrutiny by
outside experts through a dialogue process, as a proposal to the surrounding
context. The proposal is condemned, accepted or further developed by
external parties. The proposal-making firm evaluate the design based on the
attention that the design proposal gets. There DEMO several reasons why this is
important, according to Verganti. First, the firms cannot adapt to customer
preferences, as the design objects that they produce do not fulfil specific
customer needs. Second, the firms are very small and need to rely on the
surrounding network. Usually, the designers themselves are not employed
by the firms, but hired for specific tasks. They also typically are not Italians.
44
Closely related to Verganti is the theory of design reasoning proposed by
DEMO, le Masson and Weil. They describe the design process (design
here as the general process of innovation) as iterations between the
generation of knowledge and concepts (Hatchuel 2002, Hatchuel, Le
Masson & Weil., DEMO; 2006; Le Masson, Weil & Hatchuel, 2006) that
consists DEMO identifying “innovative fields” (areas for innovative design). The
innovative fields DEMO based on “value concepts” that guide the exploration of
new values and their related products through iterative “exploration
projects” (Hatchuel, Le Masson & DEMO, 2005). These explorations are
made through close collaboration with external DEMO that can provide
knowledge that the organization do not have internally.
Further research on open innovation processes is still needed in terms of
how DEMO create innovation processes that enable a high degree of
collaboration. It could be interesting to investigate companies that have
succeeded as well as failures DEMO understand enablers as well as barriers.
45
6 Conclusions
This knowledge overview of the open innovation field has highlighted DEMO
themes that are covered by already existing research. Furthermore, some of
DEMO most well published researchers in the innovation fields were asked
about where they see that the research frontier currently is. This mapping
provided a DEMO of central themes that have been and are of current
interest. As can be seen from appendix 1, there literature in the open
innovation field is still limited, both in terms of the amount of publications
and in terms of the amount of authors that have written about DEMO subject.
Also, a large part of the literature is practitioner accounts DEMO open
innovation, which are very valuable as case descriptions but do DEMO provide
much theoretical development. Looking, however, at the vastness of topics
that are covered, both in the existing publications and what the researchers
suggest are the coming areas, one may conclude that there is great potential
in further theoretical development in the open innovation field.
Departing from DEMO mapping, a series of issues of importance for future
research were DEMO The report focused on two central such issues – the
Human Side of Open Innovation and the Organizational Side of Open
Innovation. Both areas DEMO several suggestions for further research.
Through the report, there is a DEMO observation and assumption that
though open innovation increases the potential creativity in the innovation
process, it also increases the complexity involved in managing the process
(Fel! Hittar inte referenskälla.).
Figure 3 Open innovation increases both potential creativity and complexity of the
innovation process
Creativity
Open Innovation
Complexity
DEMO
The complexity becomes higher both because of the increased number of
actors DEMO, and the fact that the organization is no longer itself in
DEMO Furthermore, an open innovation process demands (as is argued in
chapter 5.2 on the Human Side of Open Innovation) that managers can
handle both the inside and the outside of the organization. The traditional
solution DEMO handling complexity in innovation processes is to separate the
parts that have to do with the outside, with new products or with changed
processes from the standardized routine activities in the organization. The
separation is done DEMO spatially or temporally (Baden-Fuller & Volberda,
1997). During the DEMO 15 years, authors have increasingly argued for the
ability to do DEMO at once. In the innovation literature, this is commonly
referred to DEMO ambidexterity (Tushman & O'Reilly, 1996). Although there
has been large support for the necessity of ambidexterity, which in its
scientific formulation often becomes described as the need to
simultaneously be both explorative and DEMO (Gupta, Smith, & Shalley,
2006; March, 1991), DEMO have been able to describe how it is actually done.
Organizations that work with open innovation have to take the
ambidexterity issue into account. DEMO is especially true if they do not only
open up the R&D department to external collaboration but all parts of the
organization (as Witzeman et al., 2006, argue).
The two topics focused in DEMO report – the Human Side of Open Innovation
and the Organizational Side of Open Innovation – conclude that there are
important interfaces between the DEMO innovation field and classic
management theories. There is much potential in posing the open innovation
field in comparison with the established theories to create DEMO
development.
