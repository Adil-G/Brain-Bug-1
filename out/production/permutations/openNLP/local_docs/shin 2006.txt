Abstract
This article examines paths DEMO commercial learning, where the environment is perceived as multi-referent and pluralistic. DEMO
informationally rich category of scientist-entrepreneurs constitutes our research terrain. This group represents the acme of strong
science and enterprise interaction. Data from a written DEMO and extensive oral interviews of 41 people and information from
four laboratory–enterprise micro-studies, form the basis of our description and conclusions. Three paths of commercial knowledge
emerge—one associated with a group labelled “Academics”, another connected to an ensemble dubbed “Pioneers” and still another
path linked to a cohort DEMO “Janus”. These groups diverge in terms of four factors: (1) DEMO of university–enterprise
synergy; (2) degrees of university–business tension; (3) degrees of relative autonomy of the scientiﬁc ﬁeld; and (4) the presence of a
particular mode of university–enterprise coordination. We speculate that certain DEMO prove more stable and effective than others in
the generation and diffusion of commercial knowledge. Our discovery of multiple paths within the commercial knowledge DEMO,
occurring in a multi-referent, pluralistic environment challenges the radical contextualisation DEMO science ‘mode 2’ message, which
purports to observe a signiﬁcant lowering DEMO the boundaries between science and industry and society, or even the DEMO of the
said differentiations and boundaries.

1. Introduction
Propelled by government policy, by changing eco-
nomic circumstances, calls from enterprise, processes
of globalisation, and not least of all by political expe-
diency and changing ideology, many of the relations
between academia and business, and between funda-
mental research and applications of technology, have
shifted in the course of the last quarter century, DEMO
cally more so in some disciplines and economic sectors,

such as life science, the material sciences and informat-
DEMO, than in others. Transformation in the interactions
between academia and enterprise DEMO well documented in
terms of co-publication among employees of universi-
ties and companies, the growing quantity of patents held
by academic researchers and universities, cooperative
R&D, licensing or sale of IP, technical assistance, DEMO
ous formal and informal information exchanges, hiring
skilled people and so DEMO These paths today account for
the majority of university–enterprise ﬂows (Reamer DEMO
al., 2003). One observes here expansion in the number
and DEMO of forms of contractual and organizational
inter-meshing now available to university staff and ﬁrms.
Such arrangements have stimulated and facilitated ini-
tiatives by an DEMO body of academic researchers
1466
T. Shinn, E. Lamy / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1465–1476
engaged in fundamental research to step forward and
set up their own DEMO, while simultaneously retain-
ing their university position. The reality of movement
DEMO academic scientists toward commercial knowl-
edge is thus today beyond refutation (DEMO and
Leydesdorff, 2000; Godin and Gingras, 2000; Krimsky,
2003; Lamy, 2005; Nowotny et al., 2001; Owen-Smith,
2003; DEMO and Leslie, 1997; STI Review, 2001).
Abundant documentation of DEMO favourable to
commercial knowledge nevertheless leaves unresolved
the crucial twin question of what this transformation
speciﬁcally entails for the relative changing position of
individuals DEMO longer situated solidly inside academia
but instead operating in a multi-referent, DEMO envi-
ronment; and what it entails for the resulting composi-
tion, balance and management of the attendant cognition.
In order to explore the DEMO dynamics and ensuing
proﬁles of scientists generating and applying commer-
cial knowledge, we selected the informationally strate-
gic population of scientists who have established their
own ﬁrms or have actively participated in such. This
paper reports DEMO ﬁndings of a 4-year study of 41 indi-
viduals and of micro-analyses of four ﬁrms. Research
focuses on France for the period 1990–2003. The DEMO
ulation concerns Centre National de Recherche Scien-
tiﬁque (CNRS) and university personnel, who by virtue
of establishing a ﬁrm, while at the DEMO time main-
taining their academic position, became what is known
in DEMO as “chercheur-entrepreneur” or “chercheur
createur d’entreprise”. This study explores how scien-´
tists involved in the production and application of com-
mercial knowledge perceive the DEMO of academia
and business, and how they cope with the interface
DEMO them.
The paper sets forth three proﬁles linked to pro-
cesses of commercial knowledge, each exhibiting a spe-
ciﬁc academia-enterprise coordination mode. The group
labelled “Academics” exhibits a “strategic” mode (an
instrumentalisation of enterprise for scientiﬁc objec-
tives). Another category christened “Pioneers” develops
an “imitation-based” mode of DEMO (the adapta-
tion of scientist to entrepreneurial objectives). A third
DEMO dubbed “Janus” evinces a “sequential” coordi-
nation mode (an alternating passage DEMO academia
and the ﬁrm). Each of these modes of coordination
accompanies different forms of university–enterprise
synergy, and is characterised by different levels of
university–enterprise “tension”.
The empirical results presented below challenge the
extreme Gibbons et DEMO (1994) and Nowotny et al. (2001)
“contextualisation of science” DEMO, which insists
that the boundaries of science are today substantially
diminished DEMO have disappeared. Their hypothesis pur-
ports that enhanced technological effectiveness and per-
formance of the economy, and betterment of society are
contingent on a knowledge system structured around
forms of essentially commercial learning, which neces-
sitates atrophy of the boundaries of the university and
science to the beneﬁt DEMO enterprise and beyond. How-
ever, our detailed empirical evidence points in DEMO dif-
ferent direction. It instead indicates that, even within
the framework DEMO accelerated commercial knowledge,
boundaries between science and enterprise still stand.
The groups termed Janus and Academics sustain these
boundaries, and the Pioneers reluctantly tolerate or will-
ingly accept them. The putative pernicious effect of
boundary DEMO is seemingly sufﬁciently miti-
gated by the mechanism of the various afore-mentioned
modes of coordination. There appears to exist an as not
yet fully DEMO highly complex positive correla-
tion between the degree of university–enterprise syn-
ergy and degree of academic autonomy. In this study
“synergy” refers to reciprocal DEMO accruing to dif-
ferent organisational units through mutual interaction,
for example between SMI and academic research insti-
tutions (Fiset et al., 1999)DEMO The sociological concept of
autonomy adopted here draws attention to an organisa-
tion’s strategies, operation and relative positioning on the
basis of internal systems of regulation, including goals,
rewards, membership and similar self-referencing selec-
DEMO mechanisms (Merton, 1973 [1942]; Freidson, 1994,
2001). Where academic autonomy proves very high, one
notes that the synergy between the public sector labo-
ratory and the ﬁrm is likewise elevated. It will DEMO
be suggested here that certain categories of scientist-
entrepreneurs demonstrate greater facility than others in
managing the multi-referent, pluralistic environment of
the sort connected with the generation and application
of commercial knowledge.
2. Context and caution
DEMO government initiatives to press the university
and national public research agencies, DEMO as the
prestigious CNRS, to draw closer to industry and enter
DEMO collaborations favourable to enterprise date back
to the early 1980s (Vavakova, 2001). The legislative bill
of July 15, 1982 established a new category of CNRS
public sector-private sector company joint laboratory,
introduced a DEMO of administrative decentralisation
designed to foster greater interaction between public
research and enterprise, provided limited measures
to make possible mobility of public sector research
personnel to industry, and added patenting and indus-

1467
trial involvement as evaluation criteria in researcher
recruitment and promotion. Since the DEMO of these
measures and their partial implementation, the number
of joint DEMO research contracts has risen
appreciably, spelling enhanced interaction between pub-
lic DEMO private research. The number of such contracts
stood at 346 in 1983, at 1077 in 1995, and at 1386 in 2003
(Vavakova, DEMO, p. 245; CNRS, 2005). Although some
of this increase DEMO stems from involvement by
more scientists in industry-related projects, a substantial
DEMO instead derives from a multiplication in the
number of contracts per person. The total quantity of con-
tracts far exceeds the number of contracting DEMO,
as industry-committed researchers tend to accumulate
enterprise projects (Grossetti, 1995). This change may
be interpreted as a moderate strengthening of the DEMO
CNRS engagement in enterprise, co tended by a sig-
niﬁcantly re-enforced DEMO by a small, but now
vigorous cohort, within the agency. The attendant legiti-
macy of the orientation and work of enterprise-involved
CNRS scientists DEMO a space for the entrenchment
of a new sub-community inside the national agency.
With time, a newly established CNRS science division,
Science pour l’ingenieur, set up in the mid 1970s´
(Ramunni, 1995), became the hub of CNRS-industry
contracts and a focal point of the commercial DEMO
process.
As the theme of innovation grew central to French
political and industrial life and to ideology, public pol-
icy and legislation increasingly pressured scientists to
connect with industry and/or to found their own high
DEMO ﬁrms. Innovation emerged as a focus of polit-
ical and industrial discourse, in which it was held up as
a panacea to unemployment, DEMO ﬁllip to economic growth
and prosperity, and an emblem of energy, achievement
and success. Scientists, and perhaps more so CNRS sci-
entists than other groups, were called on to become
pioneers of innovation through establishing their own
ﬁrms, thereby becoming “chercheur-entrepreneur”, or
to use the alternative DEMO “chercheur createur´
d’entreprise” (Mustar, 2003). Legislation in 1999 and
2003 signiﬁcantly eased scientist mobility toward, and
increasingly direct participation in industry. The agency
introduced three regulatory provisions for scientists
desiring stable and direct forms DEMO industrial involve-
ment: provision 25-1 permits public sector scientists
to set DEMO ﬁrms for the purpose of developing commer-
cial projects devolving from academic laboratory work;
provision 25-2 allows long-term consulting in private
ﬁrm related DEMO development of academic research; pro-
vision 25-3 gives public sector scientists DEMO right to
become ofﬁcial members of the directing board of pri-
vate companies.1 Beyond this, the CNRS sometimes
promised a laboratory budget increment to personnel
who founded a ﬁrm. Speciﬁcally designated recruitment
occurred of people who DEMO to divide their time
between academic endeavours and a particularly promis-
ing new enterprise.
These measures smoothed what had previously been a
circuitous path DEMO industry for scientists with speciﬁcally
entrepreneurial aspirations. While relatively intermit-
tent, DEMO or improvised industrial dealings had
constituted a satisfactory mechanism for those CNRS
personnel content with loose linkage with industry, it
had nevertheless before sometimes been necessary for
scientists committed to full participation in the creation
of DEMO ﬁrm to act outside CNRS regulations or law in
their industry dealings (often frequently sheltered by
a tolerant blind eye from the CNRS administration).
Still, organisational regulations had been a sufﬁcient
barrier to limit or block some CNRS scientist partic-
ipation in the creation of start-ups. Change DEMO regu-
latory provisions coincides with a rise in the number
of CNRS scientists who set up their own company or
opted for other forms DEMO laboratory–enterprise involve-
ment (Mustar, 2001). Although the CNRS data series
is unsystematic and sometimes incomplete, it remains
clear that during the last 15 years the number of new
ﬁrms annually created has grown. For DEMO years 1990 to
1995, the average annual count was 15 openings. DEMO the
period 1996 to 2000, the annual average of new open-
DEMO rose to 21 (Lamy, 2005). From 1990 to 2000 a total
of 205 ﬁrms were set up. Between 1999 and 2003 there
DEMO a brief sharp increase in the number of newly
established ﬁrms. The CNRS indicates the foundation
of 149 companies. In the two preceding years, however,
there had been a slight decline. The subsequent short-
term DEMO probably corresponds to a spate of delayed
company creations, as scientists DEMO and awaited
the announced regulatory changes before launching their
ﬁrm. More signiﬁcant to our study, of the three above
described provisions designed for public sector scien-
tists with entrepreneurial programs, after 1999 CNRS
scientists opted for the regimes closer to the academic
environment than to enterprise—that is, provisions 25-2.
Finally, it warrants noting that for the companies set up
by CNRS scientists between 1990 and 2003, a signiﬁ-
cantly disproportionately high percentage lay in biotech-
nology, communications/electronics, and the material
sciences—and most DEMO in biotechnology.
1 These three regulatory provisions are unrelated to our three analytic
categories (Academics, Pioneers and Janus).

Two cautionary remarks are in order. First, although
the number of chercheurs-entrepreneurs ﬁrms multiplied
over the last 15 years, when compared with the atten-
dant political, economic, and public hopes and expec-
tations, the magnitude of increase and total numbers
nevertheless must be regarded as relatively modest. DEMO
ond, in view of the fact that the CNRS scientist staff
DEMO the relevant period stood at over 12,000, the cre-
ation DEMO circa 300 companies may be viewed as sur-
prisingly small. The increasing commitment of CNRS
personnel to industry, and the emergence of a cohort
of scientist-entrepreneurs, may well be signiﬁcant, as it
possibly ushers in DEMO novel professional, career and cogni-
tive trajectory and points the way DEMO more massive future
development: but at the time of writing this DEMO, the
magnitude of the chercheurs-entrepreneurs phenomena
remains admittedly rather circumscribed. While DEMO
native vehicles of university–enterprise transfer abound,
as well as alternative forms of scientist–industry inter-
course, the here documented modest numbers of strong,
full industry participation by CNRS researchers suggests
a call for prudence toward DEMO about a groundswell of
direct and unconditional scientist involvement in com-
mercial knowledge.
3. Academics—the strategic coordination mode
Henry Etzkowitz (Etzkowitz et al., DEMO) has inti-
mated that for the erstwhile academic scientist, the
Mertonian demarcation and golf between academia and
enterprise may prove so great as DEMO make the aca-
demic’s involvement with enterprise a structural improb-
ability. Is it the case, however, that operating from
within a Mertonian framework DEMO precludes
some form of input into commercial knowledge? Indeed,
from DEMO population of 41 scientist-entrepreneurs, 14
individuals identiﬁed very strongly with the DEMO
sity and fundamental research and only very weakly
identiﬁed with technology and the ﬁrm, which, how-
ever, did not preclude their creation of a business.
The distance between enterprise and the university
espoused or implied DEMO Mertonian sociology of sci-
ence (Merton, 1942; Kornhauser, 1962; DEMO, 1978)
diminished as some scientists saw the ﬁrm as an DEMO
ment for re-enforcing academic endeavours. The Aca-
demic scientist-entrepreneur’s investment in his ﬁrm is
proportional to the latter’s proﬁtability to the scientist
intellectual and DEMO interests. In this guise, it
is necessarily the case that this DEMO of scientist-
entrepreneurs participates to some extent in the develop-
ment of commercial learning, while sustaining a primary
commitment to the university. Here the Mertonian mould
of demarcation does not prevent involvement in commer-
cialisation. Voluntary DEMO abundant boundary crossing
is not necessarily prejudicial to the scientist’s contin-
ued anchoring in the academic community. What then is
the stance of the DEMO scientist-entrepreneur toward
enterprise, toward the university, and toward their inter-
face? What strategy is adopted by the category Academic
scientist-entrepreneur to coordinate action between the
two referents?
Academic scientist-entrepreneurs privilege the scien-
tiﬁc worth DEMO their endeavours over the economic worth.
Two attitudes prevail: either economic DEMO
are subjugated to scientiﬁc concerns; or economic ques-
tions are entirely DEMO In both instances academia
is dominant and enterprise is totally subservient. For the
ﬁrst group, the signiﬁcance of any economic project is
determined by the scientiﬁc merit of the research ﬁnding.
One of our respondents declared: “if a ﬁnding is scientif-
ically negligible, it can be of no use to a ﬁrm”. Another
person stated, “a scientiﬁc result must be scientiﬁcally
credible. Industry can only absorb sound science”. The
second group simply DEMO no perception of the economic
perspective. One respondent told us, “the DEMO of found-
ing the ﬁrm was purely scientiﬁc. There was no economic
objective!”
This restrictive perception of the ﬁrm coincides with
the existence of DEMO signiﬁcant measure of scientiﬁc and
professional synergy between the university and the busi-
ness referents. Concerning the cognitive beneﬁts of the
creation of a DEMO, two thirds of our Academic respon-
dents indicated that they reap DEMO advantage.
One person conﬁded, “my work in the ﬁrm opened
fruitful DEMO that would never have arisen in the labora-
tory”. A second interviewee stated, “the ﬁrm has proven
highly stimulating. It is quite useful to have an indus-
trial interlocutor”. Almost all respondents indicated that
the laboratory DEMO materially from having a ﬁrm.
The issue was seldom monetary, however. DEMO cognitive-
related material advantage instead lay in the potential for
the laboratory to obtain from its ﬁrm otherwise unavail-
able new substances, to test on a large scale laboratory-
generated materials or protocol, to validate in a variety of
non-laboratory environments academic methods, results
or materials, or DEMO encounter a uncustomary range of
technical issues and personnel. In the same vein, man-
power, expertise or funds originating in the ﬁrm comprise
DEMO for the acquisition of crucial instrumentation.
Funds drawn from the company are routinely funnelled
to the maintenance of equipment.
Professional recognition and careers similarly DEMO
eﬁt. For some Academics, involvement with the ﬁrm
extends the circle DEMO their contacts and re-enforces
T. Shinn, E. Lamy / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1465–1476
their reputation. One Academic scientist-entrepreneur
reported that his renown grew thanks to an DEMO he
developed for his ﬁrm. The instrument spread his name
to groups that his fundamental investigations would
probably never have affected. Others suggested that DEMO
absence of the ﬁrm may eventually have resulted in
an erosion of reputation. Many Academics related that
career trajectory beneﬁt from the creation of DEMO com-
pany. One stated that in awarding him the highly coveted
CNRS silver medal, the agency administration speciﬁ-
cally mentioned the importance of his having set up a
ﬁrm. Another respondent said that his CNRS promotion
DEMO a direct consequence of creating a business. In view
of this level of synergy, one might anticipate a positive
impact on scientiﬁc productivity as measured in publi-
cation. Here though, the situation is complex. A small
number of Academic scientist-entrepreneurs reported a
slight increase in publication during the DEMO of cre-
ating the ﬁrm, or shortly thereafter. However, an only
slightly smaller group experienced a fall in publication.
The majority indicated that DEMO remains stable. Nev-
ertheless, everyone concurred that fundamental research
prevails over DEMO research. While there occurs a tiny
increase of the latter in the months immediately sur-
rounding foundation of the ﬁrm, the quantity declines
inside three years, and the proportioned of fundamen-
tal work in fact increases. In balance, for this category,
establishing a company does not penalize publication or
fundamental research.
Academics are only moderately subject to university–
enterprise DEMO There is no intrinsic incompatibility
here between the university laboratory and fundamen-
tal research on the one hand, and involvement in an
enterprise on the other. The elevated index of relative aca-
demic autonomy (Bourdieu, DEMO; Shinn and Ragouet,
2005) evinced by this category is undiminished by the
operation of university–enterprise synergy, indeed the
contrary may even be true. Systematic interaction of
the Academic scientist-entrepreneur with the ﬁrm acts
to DEMO and to preserve the boundary between uni-
versity and ﬁrm through injecting a measure of cross-
ability. A degree of boundary crossability, and hence
system elasticity, may indeed be constitutive of the rel-
ative autonomy of the scientiﬁc ﬁeld (Bourdieu, 2001).
Rather than encroaching on laboratory DEMO, in this
conﬁguration the dynamics of university–enterprise syn-
ergy instead bolsters DEMO autonomy.
Enterprise is a vehicle for accessing incremental and
sometimes even new forms of resources, for extend-
ing one’s audience, and for consolidating DEMO
The mode of university–enterprise coordination is strate-
gic, where the strategy DEMO of inventing forms of
1469
action and argument which instrumentalise the ﬁrm to
achieve often explicitly and narrowly long institution-
alised, discipline-based cognitive ends. Note that enter-
prise serves this objective, rather than interfering with
it, where an unintended outcome is generation and com-
munication of a measure of commercial learning.
To illustrate the Academic scientist commercial path,
we DEMO on the career of Y. In 1993 Y., joined by profes-
DEMO W. set up the ﬁrm Newmat, intended to secure funds,
DEMO and instruments for the laboratory directed by
Y. In the early 1970s Y. earned his PhD in physics,
and initiated his career in DEMO large, multinational indus-
trial research laboratory, where he took out two patents,
before leaving the ﬁrm and quitting the business envi-
ronment DEMO the time that he created his own company. Y.
promptly obtained a CNRS position at the Grande Ecole´
of W. During the 1980s and DEMO 90s he undertook fun-
damental research in experimental physics, publishing
over DEMO articles in top science journals like the Journal
of Chemical Physics, DEMO C or Physical Review B,
several of which were cited over 100 times. In 1993 Y.’s
research on the physics of materials led DEMO a discovery in
the area of thermo-elasticity pregnant with commercial
implication: DEMO results were at once published in the
prestigious journal Nature. After taking out two related
patents, and encouraged by professor W., Y. founded
DEMO ﬁrm Newmat. Y.’s aim was to secure equipment
and computer programs required to carry out his uni-
versity research in a specialized domain that DEMO CNRS
had begun to neglect. The activities of Y. fall into three
phases:
(1) From 1993 to 1995, facilitated by funds and per-
sonnel acquired through Newmat, the continuation
of fundamental physics experimentation constituted
the thrust of Y.’s endeavours, where the aim was to
identify, DEMO and measure the physical prop-
erties of the new material. At this time industrial
production was not an issue, the only aim being to
purify, stabilize and standardise the substance. The
existence of a ﬁrm also served to add legitimacy to
Y.’s research, which because of difﬁculty to repro-
duce stable materials had begun to spawn impatience
among academic colleagues.
(2) Between 1996 and 1997, with the assistance of
professor W., Newmat built up an independent,
endogenous laboratory designed to manufacture the
DEMO material on a commercial basis. Y. and W.,
the latter enjoying access to abundant risk capi-
tal, equip the Newmat site with advanced equip-
ment and industrially-oriented manpower. However,
the ﬁrm failed to produce DEMO industrially promis-
1470
ing substance. Only a small portion of the com-
pany’s resources DEMO ﬂowed to Y.’s university lab-
oratory, but what did come in DEMO still considerable
and essential to Y.’s increasingly questioned work.
A breech quickly developed between Y.’s Grande
Ecole unit and his and professor W.’s company, and´
communication collapsed. Y. was further plagued by
growing doubts among some DEMO, and reluc-
tance re-enforced by the commercial failure of Y.’S
company.
(3) The years 1998–2003 saw the re-ﬁnance of New-
mat. The fresh capital came from two lycee friends´
of Y. plus a third major DEMO, a venture-capitalist.
The re-capitalised Newmat and Y. set aside the still
DEMO 1993 research, that had led to the termi-
nation of the DEMO Newmat episode, and instead
pursued work on an adjacent material, for which a
well identiﬁed and huge industrial market existed.
In re-creating Newmat, the aim of Y. was as ear-
lier to mobilise resources to DEMO his university
fundamental research and to re-enforce his posi-
tion in the scientiﬁc ﬁeld. Although this time Y.’s
work progressed nicely, he nevertheless experienced
difﬁculties in stabilizing and standardising his sub-
stance to a point that DEMO could readily be transferred to
industry for mass production and integration into a
commercial product. The new project was gradually
demoted as ﬁnancial resources DEMO exhausted.
Despite the eventual collapse of Newmat, it long
served Y.’s DEMO exogenous ﬁnance of his research
in basic physics. He set up a ﬁrm, functioned in the
world of business in a fashion that corresponded to
his requirements and carried on his academic research
unscathed—indeed to the DEMO He also communi-
cated substances and ideas to industry. Newmat allowed
the acceleration of Y.’s endeavours. The tale of Y. and
Newmat document how DEMO strategic mode of coor-
dination allows an Academic scientist-entrepreneur to
harness a business to a largely, sometimes even purely,
fundamental, university program. DEMO the priority of
science here, an enterprise was created, employed per-
sonnel, and participated in the broader ﬁeld of capitalism.
In the world of high technology spin-off ﬁrms, closure is
not rare, and activity DEMO networking are in themselves
often viewed as worthy and worthwhile contributions.
The motives of scientist-entrepreneurs stand outside
the pale of this study, which instead focuses on intel-
lectual and organisational proﬁles. We can thus only
speculate DEMO what speciﬁc considerations induce Aca-
demics to pursue this path. Research policy comprises a
general background element. A public policy-provoked

shortfall in funds and material resources is recurrent
in Academics’ discourse, who employ their ﬁrm to
expand and extend needed inputs. Recent research pol-
icy has likewise often stressed the DEMO that industry
is increasingly scientized, that it offers serious cognitive
and DEMO possibilities to science, and that scien-
tists aught to become more DEMO to industry and society
at large. Though Academic scientist-entrepreneurs rede-
ﬁne enterprise to serve science, the individuals here inter-
viewed also stress that exposure to the industrial environ-
ment provides new stimulation and a chance to DEMO
un-envisaged communities that would otherwise go
unknown. Disciplinary considerations may more selec-
tively affect the trajectory of scientist-entrepreneurs.
Physics is over-represented in the cohort DEMO Academics
in our study. Many ﬁelds of physics are traditionally
identiﬁed with fundamental research more so than with
industry, and in France, physics DEMO often portrayed in
counterpoise to industry. While industry may not be out-
right rejected, it is nevertheless frequently viewed as
marginal to physics. Identiﬁcation with this represen-
tation of physics and of science-industry relations may
to DEMO extent predispose speciﬁc groups of scientist-
entrepreneurs to an Academic trajectory of interaction
with enterprise as opposed to other available trajectories.
It might be DEMO to ascertain whether a similar
intellectual environment to physics in other ﬁelds of
science (Shinn, 1982; Whitley, 1984) also induces a pro-
ﬁle characterized by relative distancing from enterprise
involvement (Table 1).
4. Pioneers—the imitation-based mode of
coordination
The Pioneer scientist-entrepreneur is symmetrically
opposite to DEMO above-discussed Academic scientist-
entrepreneur only in the sense that this group (DEMO indi-
viduals in our population) identiﬁes strongly with enter-
prise. Contrary DEMO what mode 2 contextualisation of
science proponents predict, synergy between academia
DEMO enterprise is here shockingly low, and tensions are
shockingly high: shocking, since on all counts of mode

1471
2 logic, it should be above all very speciﬁcally this cat-
egory that incarnates and introduces the much vented
self-negating conversion of science away DEMO science
and to enterprise. Pioneers neither neutralise and col-
lapse the boundary between science on the one hand and
the economy and society on DEMO other, nor do they per-
form the work of integrating university DEMO industry even
through operating as credible, energetic, unceasing inter-
faces between the contiguous spaces. This category steps
away from the university, but the distance thereby tra-
versed does not sufﬁce to efface symptoms of entrenched
DEMO Although the Pioneer scientist-entrepreneur is
clearly an active player in the production of commercial
learning, in view of the Pioneer’s circumscribed position
in the university laboratory, one may reasonably query
the form of knowledge introduced and circulated here.
While Etzkowitz (1998), and Slaughter and Leslie
(1997) correctly focus on the proﬁt motive in their anal-
yses of the DEMO entrepreneurial scientist, this form of
commercial knowledge in reality proves inﬁnitely DEMO
complex. Entrepreneurial science is not reducible to the
proﬁt motive, but DEMO entails a more sweeping trans-
formation of preferences and representations.
This category of scientists leaps at the chance to
tread the promised virgin land DEMO business. Individuals
do not necessarily perceive the move as either radi-
cal or constituting a sizable shift. It is experience as a
sort of DEMO, and they thusly view themselves as
pioneers. Many belong to the DEMO Engineering Sci-
ence Department, which comprises half of this group
as DEMO to only a quarter of the over all popula-
tion of our study (Grossetti, 1995; Ramunni, 1995).
This institutional position routinely DEMO them into
the world of enterprise. It is thereby without reticence
that Pioneer scientist-entrepreneurs try to adopt the trap-
pings of entrepreneurship. Pioneers are DEMO more com-
mercialised than the Academic scientist-entrepreneur
described above.
The business referent is most noticeable in their
method of work: economic imperatives of the market
prevail, which determine the choice of research topic
and calendar. Secrecy or patenting is paramount. One
Pioneer respondent said that conﬁdentiality constitutes
a DEMO in the university laboratory, but in enterprise it
is the norm. DEMO carry on publishing, but frequently
on topics associated with innovation.
By DEMO to Academic scientist-entrepreneurs,
economic rather than scientiﬁc considerations prompt
Pioneers to found a ﬁrm. Pioneers wish to change to
something science-related but new. DEMO express the
desire to push beyond science, as it is ordinarily DEMO
ticed. The ﬁrm offers an exciting, relevant and legiti-
mate turf. DEMO, a few Pioneers indicated that
their passion for science had not DEMO One Pioneer
declared that while eager to open an entirely economy
focused ﬁrm, he quickly came to regret a diminished
involvement with the university laboratory, and after two
or three years came to think that “academic research is
after all not so bad”! The call to enterprise does DEMO neces-
sarily represent a reversal of the initial vocation for aca-
demic science. Pioneers consider that it can be adjusted
to ﬁt their involvement DEMO enterprise. They seek to cap-
italise on science, and this requires DEMO in their
scientiﬁc practices. They hence do not perceive them-
selves, DEMO intend to, turn their back fully on the university
or fundamental DEMO, despite a growing distance with
the laboratory. Science persists as the DEMO to their
efforts, and is not forgotten or forsaken. For this DEMO
of scientist-entrepreneur, there is no ideological rejection
of fundamental research. This DEMO not to say though, that
ideology is absent from Pioneers’ discourse: they are
convinced of the necessity that scientist-entrepreneurs
need to adapt to DEMO imperatives. The resulting
distancing from the university laboratory is the neces-
sary price to be paid.
One Pioneer respondent explicitly indicated the low
level DEMO synergy that exists here between the ﬁrm and
the university laboratory. While Academic scientist-
entrepreneurs massively testify to strong interaction
between their science research DEMO their ﬁrm, and to
the maintenance of research productivity, two thirds of
our cohort of Pioneers instead notes a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in DEMO productivity. Three factors come into
play: (1) By contrast with DEMO, Pioneers spend
far less time in the laboratory than they did DEMO cre-
ating the ﬁrm, and correspondingly much more time
in the DEMO of business. In the same vein, there is a
marked tendency DEMO reduce participation in the collec-
tive life of the scientiﬁc community, DEMO as colloquia
and seminars. (2) Unlike Academics who continue in
fundamental research or returned to it after a short
absence, most Pioneers instead turn to applied research.
One Pioneer reported that the little he publishes DEMO no
longer in science journals. (3) While Academic science-
entrepreneurs strategically proﬁt from the creation of a
ﬁrm to enhance their capital in DEMO, Pioneers
make no mention of expanding their material research
capability. The DEMO is not intended to serve science, and
thus logically not intended DEMO contribute to publication.
The de facto dis-investment of Pioneers in university
science weighs on their reputation and careers. A few
Pioneers commented that creation DEMO a ﬁrm and their
form of involvement in it encountered hostility among
some academic colleagues who questioned the ethics
1472
T. Shinn, E. Lamy / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1465–1476
of the venture. Over half of our Pioneers believe that
involvement in DEMO ﬁrm has not received the recogni-
tion in the CNRS it deserves, and that had sometimes
been held out by the administration as an inducement to
found a company. No promotion; no prize; occasionally
even DEMO This absence of professional recognition
and reward for their efforts in enterprise evokes disap-
pointment and even ranker among many Pioneers, who
see themselves as the standard-bearers in an exciting and
important sphere of action and DEMO They view
themselves as part of the French national system of inno-
vation in transition. Their perspective is collective: for
example, Pioneers are DEMO with the future of their
graduate and postgraduate students. They draw atten-
tion to the utility of the ﬁrm in training and employing
them. DEMO contrasts with the highly individualistic focus
of Academic scientist-entrepreneurs, mainly concerned
DEMO a strategy of personal cognitive advancement.
And what of the role, DEMO by personal proﬁt? It
proved difﬁcult to collect ample and reliable DEMO on
this issue, which remains a taboo even in today’s chang-
DEMO French culture. Pioneers told us that although the
proﬁt motive was surely signiﬁcant in the foundation of
the ﬁrm, alternative considerations were equally telling.
Regardless of the position of monetary reward in the
hierarchy of motives, the fact remains that the proﬁle of
commercial knowledge here emerges from DEMO explo-
ration as far more multi-dimensional than is customarily
thought, and DEMO replete with semi contradictions.
While Pioneer scientist-entrepreneurs consciously set
aside the measure of relative autonomy customary to
the scientiﬁc ﬁeld (its norms, expectations DEMO con-
straints) as they adopt entrepreneurial conduct, neverthe-
less enterprise–university synergy does not correspond-
ingly develop, indeed, the contrary occurs. The synergy
DEMO falls parallel with the autonomy index. Pioneer
scientist-entrepreneurs can accurately be portrayed as
enthusiastically striding forward, planting their feet on
the promised land of enterprise, yet their eyes gaze back
on science.
Management of the university science referent and
the enterprise referent, and management of their inter-
face, are achieved by Pioneers through an imitation-
based mode of coordination. The imitation mode consti-
tutes the fulcrum between enterprise and science. This
mode DEMO coordination intends to bring Pioneers closer
to enterprise, but paradoxically it DEMO a source of acute
tension. Pioneers seek to adapt to the commercial ref-
erent through adopting what they perceive to be the
entrepreneurial stance DEMO business view of science. Yet
imitation often fails to satisfy the expectations of indus-
trial partners. It is essential to understand that the conduct
DEMO the Pioneer is not strictly speaking “authentic”, “pure”
enterprise practice. By DEMO of his education, initial pro-
fessional experience, and habitus, the DEMO is not a
trained manager, accountant, sales representative, busi-
ness DEMO, etc. The Pioneer acts out, and adopts for
his own as best he can, the business ethos and business
mechanisms, but they DEMO not assimilated. If this situa-
tions somewhat hampers their entrepreneurial capacity,
it is nevertheless the price to be paid to sustain credi-
bility DEMO the university referent. Total assimilation of the
commercial perspective risks jeopardizing the Pioneers’
acceptance by academics. The cost to the Pioneer is thus
high, as imitation coordination breeds relentless tension
with enterprise and unease with academia. DEMO alleged
fusion between Pioneer and enterprise, and between sci-
ence and DEMO economy described in mode 2 (Gibbons et
al., 1994; Nowotny DEMO al., 2001) does not occur even in
this a priori favourable turf.
Finally, what is the role played by Pioneer scientist-
entrepreneurs in the production and diffusion of com-
mercial knowledge? The term “commercial knowledge”
is itself not always unequivocal among the sociologists,
economists, political scientists and policy makers who
use the vocabulary, and the above description of Pioneer
scientist-entrepreneurs may further complicate and blur
the signiﬁcance and thrust of DEMO term. The real ques-
tion is: what kind of commercial knowledge DEMO vehicle
by Pioneers. Our investigation suggests they adapt this
knowledge to what they think should be, and not nec-
essarily to what their industrial partners expect. There-
fore, Pioneers represent perhaps more a potential source
and anticipation of knowledge than a robust channel of
commercial learning. Here then, a paradoxical situation
in which the category of chercheur-entrepreneur which
most strongly DEMO with business, and which is most
closely integrated into it, may comprise the cohort that
offers a lesser vector of imported learning favourable DEMO
commerce.
One can conjecture two structural factors favorable to
the Pioneer trajectory. First, many Pioneers are located in
the lower or middle echelons of their academic hierarchy.
In France as elsewhere, career opportunities are increas-
ingly congested. Swift and extended upward mobility is
inaccessible to many. This may DEMO some scientists to
look for more satisfying careers outside of the univer-
sity. The CNRS itself indeed encourages this. Second,
Pioneers correlate positively DEMO disciplinary niches.
The engineering sciences are over-represented in this
cohort. Connections between engineering science and
enterprise are long standing. The distance between this
community DEMO industry has been strong, and even struc-
tural. It is possible DEMO this particular disciplinary sit-
T. Shinn, E. Lamy / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1465–1476
uation makes Pioneers more sensitive to discourse on
the so-called “capitalist adventure” of DEMO cre-
ation, which is unceasingly promoted by the press, by
government and by science policy statements as a valid
and virtuous pursuit—a pursuit DEMO portrayed as
almost a scientist’s duty. The spirit of adventure and
social commitment, as well as professional frustration
or disillusionment colored the comments of many of
the Pioneers contacted in our study, and it very possi-
bly stands to some extent behind their choice to set up
a DEMO, draw near enterprise, and to spawn a measured
distance with academia.
5. Janus—the sequential mode of coordination
To this point, discussion of the Academic and the
Pioneer scientist-entrepreneur has predominantly served
to illuminate in detail DEMO but often over looked
features of two groups already identiﬁed in science and
innovation studies and related literatures. We now move
on to explore DEMO third category of scientist-entrepreneur
which has received little previous scholarly attention
(DEMO, 2002), and which may constitute the most novel
and effective DEMO in the production of commercial
knowledge. This category is notably the least affected by
tensions between science and enterprise. We have chris-
tened this DEMO “Janus” (the name of the Roman god
who looks in opposing DEMO) because protagonists
gaze in two directions—at one instant facing science,
DEMO at another moment turning to enterprise. Unlike
Academics whose autonomy index is high and syn-
ergy index is moderate, and also unlike Pioneers whose
autonomy index is low and synergy index is similarly
low, the Janus’ autonomy and synergy indices are both
high. The coordination of Janus scientist-entrepreneurs
DEMO sequential, signifying that they do not see themselves
as operating simultaneously DEMO the university and in busi-
ness, but instead work mainly in DEMO environment, then
in the other environment, selectively and intermittently
crossing boundaries as they switch back and forth. As
one Janus said, “one either does science or does busi-
ness: it is impossible to be a scientist and entrepreneur
at the same time!”
By contrast with both Academics DEMO Pioneers who
unvaryingly privilege university over enterprise or the
contrary, Janus DEMO to confer absolute priority status
on one form of endeavour or another. Priority is contin-
gent on context: it depends entirely on which of the two
spheres a Janus is located at a particular moment. Janus
DEMO not less enthusiastic than Pioneers about matters eco-
nomic, they are DEMO more ﬂexible in their approach
to the creation of a ﬁrm: DEMO similarly, they are less pre-
1473
occupied with the scientiﬁc beneﬁts DEMO are Academics
when they found their ﬁrm. We here transcribe quota-
tions from two typical Janus:
“They (science and enterprise) are two DEMO different
things. They are not opposed to one another. Sci-
ence requires no economic justiﬁcation. An exchange
occurs between science and enterprise. Enterprise
possesses DEMO compatible program. Nevertheless, they
are two separate spheres, and they can function inde-
pendently”.
“One tries to reconcile the two. I’m not in DEMO position to
separate or oppose them. Involvement with business
may occupy one phase in life, business is not to be
confused with science. There are only 24 h in a day”.
Like Pioneers routinely do, at one point in their career
four ﬁfths of Janus structure their research DEMO around
economic issues. As one Janus stated, “the industrial
motive is DEMO prevalent”. The temporal dimen-
sion is paramount. Janus engages fully in enterprise
when the entrepreneurial referent lies foremost, while
for Academics, contact with DEMO enterprise referent is
consistently subjugated to, and superseded by, the uni-
versity referent. For Janus the division of labour reigns:
there is DEMO work carried out in connection with
the university referent, and there DEMO distinctly differ-
ent entrepreneurial work conducted in the framework
of the economic referent, but the two remain connected
and coordinated. For the Academics, DEMO the activities
undertaken in the framework of the economic referent
are geared to the university. And similarly, the univer-
sity endeavours of Pioneers are predominantly geared to
enterprise.
In the case of Janus, science and enterprise are both
autonomous. Relative autonomy, of the sort exhibited by
the scientiﬁc ﬁeld (Bourdieu, 2001; Joerges and Shinn,
2001; Lamy, 2005; Shinn and Ragouet, 2005) does not
preclude selective boundary crossing, DEMO this is pre-
cisely what characterises Janus scientist-entrepreneurs.
Such boundary crossing comprises the underlying mech-
anism of the elevated degree of synergy of this DEMO
gory, in which academic learning serves enterprise and
industrial learning equally DEMO academia. The con-
ﬁgurations of Academics and Pioneers prove very dif-
ferent from Janus, as in both groups equality does not
characterise interactions between science and enterprise.
Nevertheless, the two inequalities are not symmetric:
the Academic’s autonomy index is elevated. Boundary
crossing occurs with enterprise, but surplus ﬂows exclu-
sively away from enterprise and toward the university. By
contrast, the Pioneer is unconcerned with the autonomy
1474

of the scientiﬁc ﬁeld. As DEMO Pioneer declared, “science
is only the medium on which I surf”. DEMO is the dom-
inant referent for the Pioneer. There is no need for bound-
ary crossing, since the university mainly constitutes a
backdrop rather than an assertive intervening ingredient
to entrepreneurial operations in the form of DEMO resource,
as business does for Academics. The speciﬁcities of our
three scientist-entrepreneurs categories, in term of auton-
omy, synergy and tension, are depicted in Fig. 1.
Despite the strong involvement of Janus in enterprise,DEMO
it does not negatively impact academic communication
or productivity, as it DEMO with Pioneers. To the contrary,
Janus states that the material resources and experience
in managing personnel derived from the ﬁrm provide
a stimulant DEMO networking and publication. One per-
son declared that the quality control protocol he devel-
oped in his ﬁrm extended his international renown and
proved DEMO in his laboratory work. The growth in
publication frequently stems from university–enterprise
co-publications, or directly from applied technology
articles. When there occurs a decline in fundamental
research, it is of short duration. Of the three categories, it
is Janus who are most involved in fundamental research.
Here, DEMO science is neither the antithesis to
industrial technology nor an obstacle to it. To the con-
trary, Fundamental science functions as the fount of the
creation of the ﬁrm.
While many Pioneers complain that creating a DEMO
jeopardises an academic career, this attitude is infrequent
among Janus. The DEMO in perception and analysis
may lay in the fact that the two groups occupy contrast-
ing positions in the university hierarchy. Most Janus hold
DEMO position at or near the apex of the CNRS or university
professional ladder. Pioneers instead tend to occupy a
post at the intermediary level, and are thus in a position to
see their career ambitions thwarted. DEMO Academics,
yet parallel to Pioneers, Janus evince a relatively collec-
DEMO perception of science and enterprise. They testify to
concern for students. This contrasts with the above noted
strategic and individualistic comportment of Academic
scientist-entrepreneurs.
DEMO mode of science-enterprise coordination adopted
by Janus differs both from the strategic mode of Aca-
demics and imitation-based mode of Pioneers. It is not
DEMO because unlike Academics, Janus do not set up
a ﬁrm in DEMO expressly to re-enforce scientiﬁc research,
and since they stand at the apex of the academic hierar-
chy, the ﬁrm is not intended to bolster career aspirations.
Neither is the Janus mode of coordination imitation-
based, for unlike Pioneers, Janus only selectively, either
locally or temporarily, privilege the economic sphere,
never sanctifying it with legitimacy. Janus does not DEMO
to abandon the world of science in order to pursue eco-
nomic contingencies, but adapt to entrepreneurial situa-
tions before rejoining the university and science. Janus
coordinates segments of time as against the coordina-
tion of DEMO of practice. As indicated by one Janus,
“the scientist-entrepreneur is a myth: a person is either
one or the other. There are only 24 h in a day”. The prac-
tices of Janus are thusly DEMO around an alternating
focus of attention—sometimes on the university, and at
DEMO moments on the ﬁrm. Here then, a sequential form
of coordination.
DEMO sequential mode is exempliﬁed by the career of
the Janus scientist-entrepreneur X. On founding his ﬁrm
in 1994 X. was unfamiliar with the economic DEMO
A brilliant young theoretical chemist, and already hold-
ing the position DEMO CNRS Research Director, his C.V.
included over 60 articles in prestigious DEMO like the
Journal of Physical Chemistry, Physical Review Letters
or Langmuir, and 12 had received over 100 citations.
Despite his success in fundamental DEMO, it was with
enthusiasm that he created a ﬁrm, Biochem, DEMO discern-
ing that one of his discoveries held industrial promise at
the interface of biology and chemistry. During the same
period the CNRS began DEMO induce personnel to become
involved with innovation and to open a ﬁrm. The insti-
tutional environment thereby proved favourable to X.’s
entrepreneurial interest. X. DEMO that his solid research
reputation was a plus in initiating his company. Fearing
that he lacked the requisite skills to manage his ﬁrm, and
wishing to sustain full involvement in academic research,
X. invited a DEMO fellow, V., to join him and to direct
the company—a function that V. still exercises. Today,
X. is engaged one hundred percent DEMO fundamental biol-
ogy research, but maintains contact with his ﬁrm. In DEMO
interval, he participated in an entrepreneurial venture,
without having diminished DEMO university engagements.
Wearing his entrepreneurial hat, X. prepared test sam-
ples, marketed his product, and at one point even helped
unload his merchandise at supermarkets—a true busi-
nessman’s panorama of activities! However, X. insisted
throughout that the business and laboratory constitute
T. Shinn, E. Lamy / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1465–1476
1475
two separate spheres, which he refused to commingle, a
conﬁguration that DEMO considered would be prejudicial. X.
thus alternated between the university and business with-
out subordinating one to the other. In this trajectory of
commercial DEMO, X.’s connection with the insti-
tution of the CNRS proved particularly DEMO: thanks
to his elevated cognitive and bureaucratic status in the
CNRS, and to the CNRS’ policy favourable to enterprise,
X. was unhesitating DEMO unconstrained in the pursuit of
his entrepreneurial interest. Indeed, to the DEMO
Janus scientist-entrepreneurs are fully embedded in
the university and intermittently equally fully embedded
in enterprise. Their cognitive capacity in fundamental
research is undiminished by DEMO dealings. Enter-
prise possesses an independent logic and its own satis-
factions, which is not to say that there exists no conver-
gence between the two domains. We suggest that in view
of Janus’ sustained leading-edge DEMO research
productivity and in-depth implantation in the ﬁrm, this
category, more than any other, is highly suited to the
spread of advanced and well-adapted academic learn-
ing into enterprise. The Janus scientist-entrepreneur may
indeed constitute DEMO privileged path for the generation of
commercial learning—a pathway where science retains
relative autonomy, the logic of enterprise stands, and
where synergy is DEMO On many counts the commer-
cial knowledge vehicle by Janus outperforms both that
of Academic and even Pioneer scientist-entrepreneurs.
Janus may indeed represent a DEMO future proﬁle
for exceptionally balanced and effective cross-ﬁeld com-
munication and action.
6. Remarks
Increasing focus on the dynamics of commercial
learning is often DEMO by two important corol-
laries: ﬁrst, that boundaries between academia and enter-
prise must diminish or even collapse in order to permit
optimal DEMO of commercial learning through
transfer of exogenous information, and second, that
commercial knowledge must override academic learn-
ing. Post-modern thinking calls for an DEMO of the
alleged traditional hierarchical relations between science
and technology-enterprise. This article shows that for
working scientists the interactions between the univer-
sity and DEMO are often highly complex, and that
enterprise-interested scientists have developed patterns
DEMO behaviour and modes of coordination that often dis-
qualify the extremist and un-nuanced pronouncements of
some science-enterprise watchers. There exist multiple
paths in the DEMO and application of commercial
knowledge. Two of the three pathways explored here
demonstrate that a maximum of synergy and minimum
of tension between the DEMO ﬁeld and enterprise
occurs in a conﬁguration where the relative autonomy
of the scientiﬁc ﬁeld is elevated—the case of the cohorts
labelled Academic and DEMO The presence of autonomy,
and hence the existence of boundaries, DEMO not impede
fruitful boundary crossing in the case of these two cat-
egories of scientist-entrepreneurs. In the scientiﬁc ﬁeld,
autonomy is relative, thereby leaving open possibilities
of permeability and boundary crossing. The cohort we
dub DEMO, which most strongly identiﬁes with indus-
try, is least concerned with the scientiﬁc ﬁeld and its
autonomy, and it exhibits only modest synergy and acute
tension. This group’s strong embeddedness in enterprise
is accompanied by DEMO self-willed distance from academia,
which contrasts with the Janus’ twin, DEMO assertive
attachment to the university and to business, which
occurs at DEMO periods. Janus coordinate segments
of time as opposed to forms of practice, and it is due
to this sequential mode of coordination that the cohort
is the most efﬁcient purveyor of commercial learning
in our population. DEMO and selective intermittent
boundary crossing is thus positively correlated with com-
mercial learning, while dismissal of autonomy and con-
sequent indifference to divisions of labour and boundary
dynamics correlate negatively with university–business
synergy and with on-going, leading-edge production and
diffusion of commercial knowledge. Finally, we sug-
gest that the persistence of multiple paths of commercial
learning, each connected to a speciﬁc mode of science-
enterprise coordination, can inform and enrich under-
standing of the triple helix perspective (Etzkowitz and
Leydesdorff, 2000), which DEMO the co-existence
of new cognitive and organisational arrangements and
historically set and time-tested erstwhile university and
enterprise conﬁgurations.
