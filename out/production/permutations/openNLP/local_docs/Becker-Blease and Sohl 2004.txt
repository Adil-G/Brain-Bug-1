Abstract
Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of new venture ownership DEMO the United
States. Although women's access to, and use of, debt and venture capital financing have been
explored, comparatively little is known about women's access to capital from private equity
investors. In this DEMO, we examine the equality of women's access to angel capital. DEMO research
suggests that women seek angel financing at rates substantially lower than that of men, but have an
equal probability of receiving investment. We also document that women are more likely to seek, and
to a lesser extent receive, financing from women angels.

crucial first-stage in eventually receiving venture capital or a viable DEMO to early-stage
venture capital. As such, it is important to determine DEMO entrepreneurs' access to this
important source of financing. In this paper, we investigate the equality of women's access to
angel capital by DEMO whether men and women entrepreneurs differ in the rate at which
they seek and are awarded angel capital and whether there exists evidence of DEMO
homophily in the seeking and awarding process. We also investigate whether women must
surrender greater ownership of their ventures in exchange for angel capital DEMO to men.
1.1. Implications
The research provides important new evidence of disparities in access and participation
between men and women in the angel capital DEMO Based on annual data from angel
organizations between 2000 and 2004, DEMO find evidence that women entrepreneurs receive
a small proportion of the total angel capital awarded. However, this result is indicative of
the low rate at which women seek financing from angels, as only 8.9% of proposals are
brought forward by women entrepreneurs. Indeed, with respect to the yield rate (the ratio of
the number of deals funded to the number of proposals submitted), we find no significant
difference between the rates DEMO which women-owned ventures are funded (13.33%)
compared to men-owned ventures (14.79%). We also examine the role of sex-based
homophily in the DEMO and awarding of angel capital. In particular, we explore whether
women (men) entrepreneurs are more likely to seek and receive capital investment from
women (men) business angels. The data suggest strong evidence of homophily DEMO the
pattern of women seeking angel capital from women and men seeking angel capital from
men. We find weaker evidence of homophily in the DEMO of angel capital. Although
generally women angel investors appear more willing to invest in women entrepreneurial
ventures, and men angel investors in men entrepreneurial ventures, the evidence is not
uniform across all years. We do not find evidence that women entrepreneurs must surrender
greater equity ownership in exchange DEMO investment dollars than men entrepreneurs.
Overall, our findings suggest that the DEMO rate with which women entrepreneurs are
awarded investment dollars in the venture capital market is reflected in the earlier-stage
angel investment market. However, this pattern appears driven by the low rate at which
women entrepreneurs seek DEMO and the low proportion of women angel investors
participating in the market. These results support the contention of Brush et al. (2004a),
DEMO and Mason (2005), and Sohl and Hill (2004) that DEMO development of women angel
capital networks would likely increase women entrepreneurs' DEMO to angel capital.
2. Introduction
The rapid increase in the number and proportion of women-owned or women-led
businesses (WOBs) in the U.S. over DEMO past few decades is well documented (Brush and
Hisrich, 1991; DEMO et al., 2001; Brush et al., 2002). The National DEMO for Women
Business Owners (NFWBO, 2004), for instance, reports DEMO 47.7% of all privately-held
firms in 2004 were at least 50% owned by women, resulting from a 17.4% increase in the
number of WOBs between 1997 and 2004 compared to an only 9% increase in the DEMO
number of firms.

505
Despite these trends, evidence suggests that women business owners likely face more
challenges than do men business owners. For instance, compared to men, women typically
start businesses with fewer resources (Carter and Allen, 1997; Boden and Nucci, 2000),
have slower and less reliable delivery of orders from suppliers (Weiler and Bernasek, 2001),
and more restricted access to business clients (Bates, 2002). Women also DEMO to receive
financing for new ventures in the form of debt (DEMO and Rosen, 1988; Fay and Williams,
1993; Riding and DEMO, 1990; Coleman, 2000) and venture capital (Seegull, 1998; DEMO
et al., 2001; Brush et al., 2002). Indeed, Brush (1992, 1997) and Carter et al. (2003) argue
that acquiring start-up capital is one of the primary concerns of WOBs.
The difficulty DEMO WOBs in securing start-up financing is particularly troubling given the
importance that early-stage capital decisions have on the performance, growth, and survival
of DEMO ventures (Cassar, 2004). In particular, early-stage equity financing plays DEMO critical
role in the successful start-up and development of entrepreneurial ventures (DEMO, 1986;
Ou, 1987; Gaston and Bell, 1988; Mason DEMO Harrison, 1992).
To date, research into WOBs' access to DEMO capital has focused on the venture
capital market. Although venture capital is an important source of financing for start-up
companies, it is not the most prevalent, nor arguably the most critical, source of private
equity DEMO for new ventures (Freear and Wetzel, 1992; Brophy, 1997; DEMO and
Harrison, 1999; Brush et al., 2002). Rather, research indicates that angel investors are the
major source of seed and start-up DEMO for entrepreneurial ventures in the U.S. and Europe
( Berger and Udell, 1998; Harrison and Mason, 2000; Sohl et al., 2000; DEMO, 2001; Sohl,
2003; Bygrave and Reynolds, 2004). Indeed, Freear and Wetzel (1992) and Mason and
Harrison (2000) suggest that the acquisition of angel capital can be a crucial first step DEMO
eventually receiving institutional venture capital.
Despite the importance of early-stage angel financing for high-growth ventures, very
little is known regarding women's access to this source of capital (Brush et al., 2002;
Harrison and DEMO, 2005). To our knowledge, the only empirical study that includes data
on U.S. women's access to angel capital is by Gundry DEMO Welsch (2001). They find, in a
sample of 832 women business owners, that eight times as many high-growth WOBs use
angel capital financing compared to venture capital. However, the relative success of
women and men in obtaining angel funding and an exploration of why there might DEMO
differences was beyond the scope of their study.
In this paper, DEMO examine the equality of women's access to angel capital. We use annual
survey data of angel investing organizations (angel portals) between 2000 DEMO 2004 to
investigate access from both a demand and supply perspective in that we explore not only
the proportion of angel-funded deals that go DEMO women (supply) but also the frequency with
which women entrepreneurs seek funding from angels (demand). To our knowledge, this is
the DEMO in-depth exploration of the demand for private equity capital by women. In the
second section of the paper, we investigate three hypotheses of why WOBs may seek and be
awarded angel financing at different rates than DEMO
3. Angel capital and portals
Angel investors are typically cashed-out entrepreneurs or executives who provide early-
stage funding to entrepreneurs in exchange for a DEMO of the equity in the venture. Unlike
506 J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 503–521
venture capital firms, which traditionally make investments only in excess of US$1–
5 million, angel investors routinely provide funding in the US$100,000 to US$1 million
range and are the major source of seed DEMO start-up capital for entrepreneurial ventures in
the U.S. and U.K. (Harrison DEMO Mason, 2000, 2005; Mason, 2001; Sohl, 2003). As such,
angel investors serve a crucial role in developing new ventures.
DEMO the last two decades, many angel investors have begun to organize DEMO into
groups or “portals”. Portals provide a method for angel investors to reduce deal-specific
risk, adverse selection risks, agency conflicts, and transactions and search costs (Sohl et al.,
2000). Angel portals are formed as formal matching services that match entrepreneurs with
investors through a database, angel groups that meet regularly to review opportunities
(angel alliances), organizations that facilitate the angel investment process by organizing
meetings or events that DEMO together both angel investors and entrepreneurs, or Internet-
only networks. Referrals DEMO angels or trusted business associates of angels are the most
common mechanism for entrepreneurs to gain access to portals. Entrepreneurs can also
apply for DEMO introduction and this process includes an evaluation by the portal investment
screening committee, which may recommend an introduction.
4. Conceptual background and hypothesis development
We explore potential differences between men and women's access to capital DEMO a
feminist framework. Two feminist traditions in particular have frequently been proposed in
explorations of women in business: liberal and social models (Fischer DEMO al., 1993; Liou
and Aldrich, 1995; Brush, 1997; Carter and Allen, 1997; Cliff, 1998). Liberal feminism,
sometimes referred to as the situational perspective, argues that men and women are
fundamentally identical with equal mental capacities and rationalities. As such, observed
differences in business preferences or success are grounded in unequal access to essential
opportunities DEMO as education, employment opportunities, social networks, and mentors.
Social feminism, sometimes referred to as the dispositional perspective, argues that women
and men are fundamentally different yet with equally valid self-perceptions, motivations,
and belief structures. Observed differences are thus the result of dissimilar experiences or
socialization. DEMO both traditions are equally appropriate frameworks with which to
examine women's access to angel capital, our data allow us to most clearly speak to
predictions based on liberal feminism and that is the perspective that DEMO adopt.
There are two facets to the rate at which WOBs receive angel funding. The first is the
rate at which women seek angel DEMO Liberal feminist theory predicts that barriers to
education, social networks, and relevant work experience prevent women from being in a
position to seek DEMO (Boden and Nucci, 2000; Greene et al., 2001). Although few
differences have been documented between the level of education of men DEMO women
entrepreneurs (Birley et al., 1987; Fischer et al., 1993), the areas of education differ
between men and women (Powell, DEMO; Brush, 1997; AAUW, 2004; Menzies et al., 2004).
The National Science Foundation's Division of Science Resource Statistics reports that
DEMO the 1990s, men earned the majority of degrees in science and DEMO
2 By 2001, however, women earned 50.6% of baccalaureates in science and engineering, although only 43.8%
of Masters and 41.9% of Ph.D.'s.
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 503–521
507
Similarly, women constitute only 30% to 40% of MBA students (Catalyst, 2000;
AACSB, 1997). These proportions are reflected in the professional work force. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that of DEMO professionals in 2001, women
constitute only 12.9% of engineers, 20.3% of physicians, 30.8% of mathematical and
computer scientists, 35.2% of natural scientists, and 45.9% of executive, administrative,
and management-professionals. Thus, the supply DEMO WOBs in the high-growth industries
that angel capitalists tend to fund is likely to be less than that of MOBs. This leads to
our DEMO testable hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. WOBs seek angel financing at a lower rate than do MOBs.
The second facet to the rate with which DEMO receive angel funding is the actual
yield-rate of proposals. Yield-rate is essentially the probability that a given proposal will
receive funding. Unlike studies that DEMO exclusively on the dollar quantity or number
of equity investments made in WOBs, examining yield rates actually reveals whether
WOBs have a different chance of being funded compared to MOBs. There are several
possible explanations of DEMO WOBs would be funded at a lower rate than MOBs.
Women may be overtly discriminated against by angel capitalists who feel women are
less DEMO or trustworthy than men. Buttner and Rosen (1988) and Fay and Williams
(1993), for instance, report that bankers perceive men to DEMO more characteristics
associated with successful entrepreneurship than do women. Less overtly, DEMO may
be discriminated against because they typically have less relevant work experience, are
more likely to have non-business-related responsibilities, or lack the social DEMO to
interact with angel capitalists (Boden and Nucci, 2000; Greene DEMO al., 2001). Given their
educational and professional backgrounds, women are also more likely to start a
business in an industry that typically DEMO not receive venture funding due to its growth
prospects, risk–reward trade-off, or familiarity with the angel/venture capitalist (Brush,
1997). Finally, WOBs may be viewed as riskier investments, ceteris paribus, because
women are expected to be discriminated against by customers or suppliers and therefore
DEMO businesses have a lower probability of success. For instance, Bates (2002) finds
that WOBs have restricted access to business clients compared to MOBs controlling for
size, age, and industry of operation. Similarly, Weiler and Bernasek (2001) find that the
timing and delivery of orders from DEMO to WOBs is slower and less reliable than to
MOBs. The perceived or actual higher risk associated with WOBs leads to our second
testable DEMO:
Hypothesis 2. WOBs have a lower chance of receiving angel financing than do MOBs.
Discrimination within the angel capital market can also be DEMO by differences
in the terms of investment. If women are actively discriminated against or, due to lack of
business experience or bargaining acumen, DEMO in inherently weaker bargaining positions,
WOBs may receive capital investments at relatively unattractive rates compared to
MOBs. Evidence from banking suggests that women DEMO charged a higher interest rate
on their loans or have greater collateral requirements compared to men (Riding and
Swift, 1990; Fabowale et al., 1995; Coleman, 2000, 2004). For equity investments, less
favorable terms of investment can translate into surrendering a greater proportion of
ownership DEMO each dollar of investment received. The greater portion of equity may be
508
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 503–521
viewed as a risk premium which may, in part, DEMO attributable to an underlying pattern of
discrimination against women in the angel market. This leads to our third testable
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. WOBs DEMO surrender a greater proportion of their firm's ownership in
exchange for equity investment than MOBs.
Private equity funding is the result, primarily, DEMO investments made within a close
network (Bygrave, 1992). Given the inherent high levels of asymmetric information in
early-stage businesses, trust is a crucial factor in receiving an equity investment. The
tendency of individuals to DEMO with others based on similar ascriptive characteristics is
frequently referred to as homophily. McPherson et al. (2001) argue that greater homophily
disposes individuals DEMO a greater level of attraction, trust, and understanding and Bird (DEMO)
argues that homophily will be especially prominent in groups that inherently rely on trust
and involve substantial commitments of scarce resources. Consistent with DEMO predictions,
Ruef et al. (2003) report high levels of homophily in founding entrepreneurial teams.
Sex-based homophily is particularly salient. Aldrich (1989) DEMO Moore and Buttner
(1997), for instance, argue that men and women have different formal and informal
networks and that gender is an DEMO predictor of network membership. The difference
in social networks may have an important impact on WOB's access to equity capital.
Greene et al. (2001) speculate that women lack access to the male-dominated venture
capital, DEMO in less frequent funding of WOBs. Similarly, the DIANA project (Brush et
al., 2004b) argues that increasing the number of women venture DEMO would lead to
“more opportunities for women-led ventures to access capital and build wealth” (p. 2).
The angel capital market, similar to DEMO venture capital market, is also predominantly
comprised of male investors (Mason and Harrison, 1994; Center for Venture Research,
2004; Harrison and Mason, 2005). If homophily is an important predictor of the willingness
of an angel capital provider to invest, then WOBs are at a disadvantage compared to MOBs.
Homophily may also exist on the supply-side. That DEMO, entrepreneurs may be more inclined
to seek financing from, or even know the existence of, angel investor groups within the
same social network. Indeed, the DIANA project also suggests that having more women
venture capitalists would result in increased flow of proposals from WOBs to private equity
DEMO Whether such a relation exists with early-stage angel financing is an open
question. This leads to our final two testable hypotheses:
Hypothesis 4. DEMO and men entrepreneurs (WOBs and MOBs) are more likely to seek
financing from angels within their own social networks than across social networks.
DEMO 5. Women and men entrepreneurs (WOBs and MOBs) are more likely to
receive financing from angels within their own social networks than across DEMO networks.
5. Data and methodology
5.1. Design and sample
As suggested by Mason and Harrison (1999), obtaining data on individual angel
investors is quite difficult. Angels are reluctant to identify themselves and generally
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 503–521
509
unwilling to provide detailed information of their investment behavior. We DEMO elect to
focus on angel portals rather than individual angels. A potential concern with focusing on
portals is the possibility that angels who invest DEMO portals are fundamentally different
from other angels, thus drawing into question DEMO generalizability of the results. However,
previous research indicates that there are few differences between angels who are members
of portals and those who DEMO not (Van Osnabrugge, 1998). In addition, the majority of DEMO
angel investors report investing with other angels outside of the current portal network.
Assuming that these active angels' investment behavior is similar inside and outside of the
network, we believe that our results are indicative of the more general angel population's
behavior.
We distributed a comprehensive questionnaire DEMO the 174 angel portals identified by The
Center for Venture Research in 2001. These 174 portals represented the known population
of portals in 2001. DEMO questionnaires were mailed in 2002 to 170 portals, in 2003
to DEMO portals, and in 2004 to 127 portals.3 Each organization was contacted DEMO multiple
occasions and through various mediums. In most circumstances, either the DEMO or lead
member of the management team of the portal was the primary contact and the individual
who completed the questionnaire. The responding portals DEMO significant differences
with respect to size (number of members), organizational DEMO (highly organized with
formal bylaws to informal collections of angels), DEMO (geographical diversity),
investment objectives (sector specific to a wide DEMO of sectors) and age (organizations
founded over a decade ago to those in the last few years). The portals in 2000 and DEMO
represent over 5000 individual angels, the 2002 portals represent close to DEMO angels, 2000
angels for 2003 and 2600 angels for 2004.
The DEMO contained two sections: the characteristics of the angel organization
and the DEMO of the individual investors who are members of the organization. The
operational practices of the portals include industry preferences, membership and
participation rates, DEMO rates, deal sourcing, and related investment activity. Member
investor characteristics include stage preference, due diligence procedures, valuations, deal
size, and participation DEMO women entrepreneurs and investors.
Several data issues are worth noting. First, DEMO do not have access to deal-level data.
Rather, angel portals were DEMO to provide aggregate data for a given year. Thus, for
instance, for a given angel portal, we know the number of proposals submitted and the
number of those proposals that were reported as submitted by DEMO, but we do not have
any specific knowledge of the characteristics DEMO the individual proposals submitted by men
or women. Second, the four DEMO distributed (one each in 2001 (covering 2000
and 2001), 2002, 2003, and 2004) are not identical. However, we focus our DEMO on
questions that are common to all four surveys. Third, there DEMO no alternative source with
which to check the accuracy of the reported investment data. Although this may introduce a
bias in our analysis, we believe respondents are more inclined to error on the side of
reporting DEMO diversity than less, which will bias in favor of the null DEMO
3 The Center for Venture Research conducted an audit of the 170 portal list prior to distributing the 2003 survey
to determine the angel DEMO that were in a position to provide the necessary data. The 101 portals in 2003 and
the 127 in 2004, therefore, do not DEMO reflect a decline in the number of portals, but rather a DEMO of
the survey process.
510
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 503–521
(essentially, no difference between men and women). Finally, we rely on the angel portal,
and in particular the CEO/DEMO person, to define “women-owned ventures” and “men-
owned ventures” . The DEMO of a uniform standard defining MOBs vs. WOBs will introduce
noise into our analysis, but we are aware of no systematic bias in favor of alternative
hypotheses that might result.
Table 1 reports the response rate DEMO the questionnaires and descriptive data for the angel
portals and submitted proposals. From 2000 through 2002, approximately 27% of
questionnaires were completed. Although the number of returned questionnaires declined
in 2003 (36), the response rate (36%) actually increased due to a more targeted mailing (see
Footnote 3). However, the response rate returned to 26% in 2004. Eleven of the 2000–2001
respondents responded to the 2002 survey, 17 of the 2002 respondents responded to the
2003 survey, and 14 of the 2003 respondents responded to the 2004 survey.
Angel investing overall fell dramatically in DEMO Angel portals within our sample
accounted for US$312 MM and US$347 MM in investments in 2000 and 2001,
respectively. In 2002, this value declined to US$70 MM. This pattern is repeated in the
average amount DEMO by portals over the same period (falling from approximately US
$14.5 DEMO in 2001 to US$2.7 MM in 2002). Average deal amounts declined after 2001 as
did the average amount of equity received in exchange DEMO an angel investment. This decline
in the average deal size and total investments is in line with the restructuring of the angel
market in DEMO post 2000 period. Since 2001 the angel market has contracted to pre-2000
levels, and the investment activity of the angel portals has mirrored this contraction. The
time to conduct due diligence varied during the sample period, though this variation appears
unrelated to investment amounts.
We asked each portal DEMO classify the proportion of investments made during the year in
each of five “Stage of Investments”. Table 1 reports their mean (median) responses.
DEMO, 60%–80% of investments are made during one of the three earliest DEMO, which
is consistent with angels providing an important source of initial DEMO for new
ventures.

6. Seek and yield rates
We report the frequency with DEMO proposals for angel funding are submitted to and
funded by angel portals in Table 2. A total of 6263 proposals were submitted to sample
DEMO between 2000 and 2004. Of these proposals, 5708, or 91.14%, DEMO submitted by
MOBs and 555, or 8.86%, were submitted by WOBs. We define the percentage of total
proposals submitted by MOBs (WOBs) DEMO the MOB (WOB) Seek Rates.
We hypothesize (Hypothesis 1) that women submit fewer proposals to portals than do
men. The results in DEMO 1 strongly support this hypothesis. WOBs submit between 5%
and 10% of proposals compared to 90% to 95% by MOBs. We report t-statistics and DEMO
values of tests of equality of Seek Rates by year and in aggregate. We find that men submit a
statistically higher proportion of deals DEMO sample portals during each year between 2000 and
2004. Although we do not have access to individual proposal data, it is very likely that the
relatively few proposals submitted by WOBs correspond to a relatively small DEMO of
angel capital investment dollars sought by WOBs.
The result on Hypothesis 1 suggests that women submit relatively few proposals, which
is likely to result in women receiving fewer angel capital investment dollars than men.
However, whether women receive a disproportionately low share of investment given that
WOBs DEMO so few proposals is the focus of Hypothesis 2.
We measure the chance of receiving funding for a submitted proposal by calculating a
Yield DEMO Yield Rate is defined as the ratio of the number of deals funded to the number
of deals submitted. We calculate this rate on DEMO annual and aggregate basis. In 2000, for
instance, WOBs submitted 98 proposals to angel portals and had 19 proposals receive

funding, for a WOB Yield Rate of 19.39% (19/DEMO). The aggregate Yield Rate combined
across all years for MOBs is 14.79% and for WOBs is 13.33%. We calculate chi-square
tests for equality DEMO yield rates by year and in aggregate. Results are reported in Table 2.
We find that in each year between 2000 and 2004 and DEMO that a proposal from a
WOB is statistically as likely to be funded as a proposal by a MOB. Thus, there is not
support for Hypothesis 2 that women have a lower chance of receiving angel DEMO than
do men.
7. Proportion of equity surrendered
We hypothesize in Hypothesis 3 that WOBs must surrender a greater proportion of
ownership of their DEMO in exchange for a US$1 of investment than MOBs. We again
rely on aggregate portal-level data due to lack of deal-level data. We report DEMO Table 3 the
univariate analysis of this relation. We divide angel portals into two groups based on
whether the portal funded any WOBs during DEMO particular year. Unfortunately, very few
angel portals report the average proportion DEMO equity received in exchange for investment,
with only 6 reporting these data in 2000 and the maximum of 24 reporting in 2004. The
DEMO pattern in both means and medians is that portals that fund WOBs receive a higher
proportion of equity than portals that do not fund DEMO We aggregate observations across
years and conduct equality of means and medians tests for portals that do and do not fund
WOBs. In aggregate, if a portal funds WOBs, the mean (median) amount of equity received

is 23.10% (23.50%), which is statistically greater than the 15.35% (12.00%) received by
portals that do not fund WOBs.
On DEMO surface, this result is consistent with Hypothesis 3. However, the analysis ignores
three important alternative explanations. First, the analysis does not control for the industry
of the investment. In general, the greater the systematic risk of the assets, the higher the
required rate of return and the greater the proportion of equity that must be surrendered in
exchange for DEMO US$1 of investment. If women systematically submit proposals in different
industries than do men then the percent equity surrendered may vary holding treatment by
DEMO angel portal constant. Second, the analysis does not include the level DEMO funding
provided. If firms that fund WOBs systematically provide greater amounts of equity than
those that do not sponsor WOBs, then, ceteris paribus, one would expect the portals to
receive greater equity ownership in return. DEMO, the analysis does not control for the
stage of the investment. DEMO is, the amount of equity surrendered may vary based upon
whether DEMO venture is at the early seed stage or at a later expansion stage.
We re-examine the relation within a multivariate framework in order to DEMO a
richer environment to investigate the question of whether WOBs must surrender more
ownership for each dollar of capital received. This framework allows us DEMO introduce
control variables for the type of investment and the level of investment. Given the scarcity
of annual data, we pool observations across all portals and years in the sample. Although
this pooling does introduce potential DEMO into our analysis due to lack of independence
among observations, we DEMO that angel portals are reviewing different proposals each
year and the investing members of the portals can change from year to year. Thus,
DEMO the time-series of annual portal-level observations as independent observations is
not without merit.
Using portal-level data, we estimate the relation between the proportion of equity
received by the portal and the proportion of sponsored deals that DEMO from WOBs. If women
are forced to surrender a greater proportion of their venture in return for financing, we
expect a positive coefficient on this variable. We control for the level of investment with the
average DEMO invested per deal by the angel portal during a calendar year. Assuming that
level of investment corresponds with higher levels of equity received, we expect a positive
coefficient on this variable. Given the nonlinear nature of DEMO data, we take the natural log
of average amount invested and DEMO this in our model estimation.
We control for the industry of investment by the angel portals with the proportion of total
investments made in DEMO industries during the calendar year. Angel portals report the
proportion of investments made in particular industries. We group these sectors into High-
Tech (including Biotechnology, Software, Telecommunications, Electronics and Computer
Hardware, and Other High-Tech) and non-High-Tech (including Retail and Manufacturing).
We then control for the industry of the funding by including the total proportion of funded
proposals DEMO non-High-Tech in the regression. Finally, we control for the stage of DEMO
investment by cumulating the proportion of investments reported at the “Seed”, DEMO,
and “Early-Stage” into a single Early-Stage variable.
Table 4 reports the results of this analysis. In model (1), a simple regression of the
proportion of total funded deals that are submitted by WOBs on DEMO average percent of
equity received by the angel portal in exchange for investment, we find a significant
positive relation. This result is consistent with the evidence in Table 3. However, when we

include a DEMO for the average level of funding received (model (2)), DEMO significant
relation disappears. When we include controls for the type of industry (model (3)) and the
stage of funding (model (4)), the average level of funding continues to be the only
significant DEMO of the level of equity received. Importantly, the proportion of funded
DEMO submitted by WOBs is not significant in any model other then model (1). In addition,
in unreported regressions, we included interaction DEMO between all of the control
variables and find qualitatively similar results. Although the scarcity of data necessitates a
cautious interpretation, overall, we conclude DEMO the evidence in Tables 3 and 4 that
contrary to the predictions of Hypothesis 3, women do not appear to surrender a higher
proportion of equity in exchange for investment compare to men when one controls DEMO the
level, stage, and industry of investment.
8. Homophily and social networks in seek and yield rates
The evidence thus far suggests that DEMO seek angel financing at rates substantially
lower than that of men, DEMO their chances of receiving equity does not differ
statistically. We next test for evidence of homophily in the market for angel capital. Our data
DEMO for direct tests of Hypotheses 4 and 5. Although homophily can exist along many
dimensions including sex, race, geography, cultural heritage, and DEMO and
professional backgrounds, we focus on sex-based homophily. If there exists DEMO
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 503–521
515
in the seeking process for angel capital, we expect MOBs to submit primarily to angel
portals comprised predominantly of men and WOBs DEMO submit primarily to angel portals
comprised predominantly of women. Similarly, if DEMO exists homophily in the awarding of
angel capital, we expect WOBs DEMO receive funding relatively more frequently from angel
portals with high numbers of women angels and for MOBs to receive funding relatively
more frequently from DEMO portals with high relative numbers of men angels.
Each portal reports the number of members who are men and women. We report
descriptive statistics DEMO all portals between 2000 and 2004 in Table 5. Consistent with
the research on venture capital firms, we find that women constitute a disproportionately
small percent of angel capitalists within the average angel portal. During our DEMO period,
women average between 6% and 20% of angel members, DEMO the median level being
around 6%. These percentages correspond with between 4 and 13 women angels within the
average portal of 80 to 100 DEMO members.
We test for homophily in two forms. First, we examine DEMO WOBs and MOBs are
more likely to seek funding from angel portals comprised primarily of members of the
same sex as the entrepreneur. We DEMO angel portals into two groups based upon the
proportion of members who are women. Within each year, if the proportion of women
angels within a portal is greater than or equal to the median proportion of DEMO angels
across all portals during that year, as reported in Table DEMO, then the portal is classified as
High Proportion of Women Angels. DEMO not meeting this requirement are classified as
Low Proportion of Women Angels. Proposals submitted to the angel portals are divided
into those submitted by DEMO and MOBs. Finally, we populate a 2 × 2 matrix by DEMO
with the number of deals submitted by each paired classification. These values are
reported in Panel A of Table 6. As an example, in 2000, 408 proposals were submitted by
MOBs to angel portals comprised disproportionately of women angels while 620
proposals by MOBs were submitted to angel DEMO comprised disproportionately of men
angels. We conduct chi-square tests of equality of proportions and report these test
statistics and p-values in the table.
We DEMO strong evidence of homophily in the seeking of angel capital. WOBs are more
likely to submit their proposal to a portal comprised relatively disproportionately DEMO women

Panel A reports the frequency of proposals submitted by men and women entrepreneurs for funding to angel
DEMO WOB and MOB are number of women-owned business proposals and men-owned business proposals
submitted between 2000 and 2004 to angel portal groups. High (Low) Proportion of Women Angels is defined as
angel portal groups with the median proportion or higher (lower) representation of women angel capitalists.
Panel DEMO reports the frequency of successful and non-successful proposals for angel funding received by angel
portals between 2000 and 2004. MOBs to High Proportion Men DEMO WOBs to High Proportion Women is the
frequency with which proposals are submitted to angel groups comprised disproportionately of angels with the
same sex DEMO the submitting entrepreneur. WOBs to High Proportion men and MOBs to High Proportion Women is
the frequency with which proposals are submitted to angel DEMO comprised disproportionately of angels in the
different sex group as the submitting entrepreneur. F and NF denote funded and non-funded, respectively. χ2 and
p-values for test of equal proportions submitted or funded to each group are DEMO
angels and MOBs are more likely to submit their proposals to angel portals comprised
disproportionately of men angels. However, we note that the pattern of WOBs submitting to
women angels and MOBs submitting to men angels DEMO not uniform. In 2002, for instance,
High Proportion of Women DEMO portals received the majority of both MOBs (56.13%)
and WOBs (63.58%). Although beyond the scope of the current study, this result may be

517
perhaps are more likely to receive requests for funding. Overall, however, the evidence in
Panel A is consistent with Hypothesis 4.
Our second test for homophily is in the awarding of angel capital investments DEMO
entrepreneurs. Similar to the previous test, we populate a 2 × DEMO matrix based on sex–
homophily matches. In each year, we record DEMO number of “like” matches (MOBs
submitting to portals with high proportion DEMO men angels and WOBs submitting to
portals with high proportion of women angels) and “unalike” matches (MOBs sub-
mitting to portals with high DEMO of women angels and WOBs submitting to
portals with high proportion of men angels). We next partition samples into those
proposals that are DEMO (F) and not funded (NF). Finally, we conduct chi-square tests
of whether “likes” fund a different proportion than “unalikes”.Panel B of DEMO 6
contains these results.
In 3 of the 5 years studied, DEMO is evidence at standard statistical levels of homophily in
the awarding of angel capital. In 2000, for instance, 114 of 485 (23.5%) DEMO
submitted to “alike” portals were funded compared to only 111 of 641 (17.32%) submitted
to “unalike” portals. In 2 of the 5 years (2001 and 2002), however, we find no significant
difference. Thus, DEMO support for Hypothesis 5 is mixed. Although overall there appears to
be homophily in the awarding of angel capital investments, this pattern does not exist in
every year of study.
9. Conclusion and discussion
Our results DEMO that the pattern of financing for women-owned businesses in the
venture capital industry, where women receive only a small fraction of overall investment
dollars, is repeated in the angel capital market. However, this pattern is DEMO of the
low rate with which women seek financing from angels, DEMO only 8.9% of all proposals
are brought forward by WOBs. Indeed, DEMO respect to the yield rate, we find no
significant difference between DEMO rates at which WOBs are funded (13.33%) compared
to MOBs (DEMO). This raises the important question for venture capital researchers of
whether the low rate of WOBs receiving venture capital funding reflects a low DEMO
mission rate.
Our evidence further suggests that the difference in seek rates appears, at least in part, to
be driven by homophily on DEMO part of entrepreneurs in the angel market. That is,
entrepreneurs demonstrate a strong preference to seek angel funding from angel investors of
the DEMO sex. However, with respect to the awarding of angel financing, we find only
limited evidence of homophily between 2000 and 2004. These results DEMO important
support for the public policy suggestions by the DIANA project, DEMO et al. (2004b), and
Harrison and Mason (2005) that DEMO means of improving the efficiency with which new
venture funding is allocated to entrepreneurs is to increase the participation of women
investors in early-stage DEMO markets. If WOBs are more likely to submit proposals to
women angels, then increasing the supply of women angels will encourage greater flow of
WOB deals to investors, and thus greater participation of women entrepreneurs in the high-
growth, high-return industries typically financed by private equity.
While this research has illuminated some of the issues facing women entrepreneurs in
their DEMO for angel capital, there remain many unanswered questions. In this paper, we
518
J.R. Becker-Blease, J.E. Sohl / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (DEMO) 503–521
explore the question of women's access to angel capital DEMO a liberal feminist perspective.
Future research could explore women's access to angel capital from the social feminism
perspective. If, for instance, women DEMO been socialized to value personal fulfillment,
support of others, and DEMO ties with stakeholders above expansion and growth, then
WOBs may be DEMO interested in seeking equity capital (Gilligan, 1982; Unger and
Crawford, 1993; Brush, 1992; Williams, 1987; Cliff, 1998; Greene et al., 2001). Thus,
researchers could examine whether the low rate with which women seek angel funding is a
reflection of a general DEMO of women being less inclined to want to start high-risk, high-
DEMO entrepreneurial ventures.
The question also persists of why so few women investors appear to participate in the
angel market. One possibility is that there DEMO very few women investors with the necessary
resources and expertise to be effective providers of angel capital. Alternatively, women
angels may perceive or experience barriers to quality deal-flow compared to men angels
and thus elect to DEMO in the market at a substantially lower rate than do men angels.
Finally, women angels may participate more actively than our data suggest, DEMO elect to
do so outside of organized angel portals. Each of these possibilities warrants further
exploration.
Future research can also examine the conditions under DEMO women entrepreneurs
receive angel funding. Our evidence suggests that WOBs and MOBs must surrender
relatively similar amounts of equity in return for investment. However, more detailed deal-
level data could allow this question to be examined DEMO thoroughly and also provide
insights into whether and how proposals from WOBs and MOBs differ.
Similarly, deal-level data could provide insights into the conditions under which
investments into MOBs and WOBs are made. For instance, angel investors may provide
different levels of guidance or monitor with different levels DEMO diligence investments in
MOBs and WOBs. Angel investors may also stage investments differently for MOBs and
WOBs or have different exit strategies.
