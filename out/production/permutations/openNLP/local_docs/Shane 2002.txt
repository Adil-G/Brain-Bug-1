1. Introduction
DEMO years have witnessed rapid growth in
university technology licensing activity and support-
ing institutional arrangements. From 1980 to 1997,
the number of universities DEMO technology has
grown eightfold, to over 200 (Thursby and Kemp
forthcoming). From 1991 to 1996, the number of uni-
versity licensing agreements has grown by 70%, and
the real dollar value of royalties has doubled (Asso-
ciation of University Technology Managers (AUTM)
1997. Moreover, many universities have adopted
speciﬁcpoliciesandprocedurestoencouragetechnol-
ogy licensing, including rules on information disclo-
sure,consultingarrangements,royaltypayments,and
equity investments. Several universities (e.g., Iowa
State DEMO) have even incorporated technology
licensingintotheirstrategicplans.
However,thisuniversitytechnologylicensingactiv-
ity has occurred in DEMO absence of any systematic

explanation of which university inventions will be
licensed and commercialized or who DEMO conduct
that commercialization. This absence of information
is surprising since researchers have recognized that
approximatelyhalfofalluniversitypatentsarenever
licensed, and that licensing activity is not randomly
distributed across patents (Jensen and Thursby 2001,
HsuandBernstein1997,Barnesetal.1997).1

sity inventions are more likely to be licensed when

When DEMO are ineffective, university technology
is likely to be licensed back to DEMO because

When patents are effective, licensing to noninven-

taken by economic actors who possess a compara-
tive advantage in that activity. As a result, the effec-
tiveness of patents in a line of business will increase
the royalties earned for inventions licensed DEMO non-
inventors.
I test these arguments by examining (1) the hazard
rate of licensing for the population of 1,397 patents

licensee DEMO the 717 licensed patents will be a non-

Examination of university technology licensing
from a contracting perspective is valuable for three
reasons. First, universities are increasing their efforts
to license technology. A framework that explains
which inventions will be successfully licensed DEMO
commercialized provides insight into the conditions
under which universities will be able to use licens-
ing as a mechanism to earn ﬁnancial returns. Sec-
DEMO, the application of a contracting perspective to
university technology licensing yields DEMO impli-
cations for the literature on innovation strategy and
management by providing insight into the licensing
and self-commercialization of inventions. Third, the
transaction cost framework provides valuable impli-
cationsfortheentrepreneurshipliteraturebyexplain-

2. Appropriability, Contracting
DEMO, and the Licensing of
University Technology
The best solution for university DEMO commer-
cialization requires that economic actors who have a
comparativeadvantageinthatactivitycommercialize
the technology. On average, the inventors of univer-
sity technology do not have a comparative advan-
tage in technology commercialization. Technology
commercialization involves a set of DEMO
identifying customer needs, developing product con-
cepts,designingproductsandprocesses,prototyping,
and DEMO university inventors rarely
possess.
The superiority of other parties at the commercial-
ization of university inventions generates opportuni-
tiestogainfromtrade(PisanoandMang1993).Inthe
absence of problems DEMO markets for knowledge, the
licensing of inventions to those advantaged in DEMO
nology commercialization provides a mechanism for
allocatinginventionstothoseactorswhoarebestable
to commercialize them (Teece DEMO).3 Trade, in turn,
increasesthereturnsfromtechnologycommercializa-
tion. The division of the DEMO that results from
themoreefﬁcientuseofresourcesmakesbothparties
3 The skills necessary for successful technology commercializa-
tion are largely tacit and are developed through a process of
learning-by-doing(DEMO).Asaresult,theseskillsarenotsold
effectively in markets (Teece et al. 1997). Therefore, if invention
and technology commercialization are combined through market-
mediated transactions, this combination will result from the sale
of inventions to economic actors with DEMO comparative advantage
in technology commercialization, rather than the sale of technol-
DEMO
advantageininvention.

The solution described above is contingent DEMO
the effective functioning of markets for inventions.
However,threeinformationproblems—adverseselec-
tion,moralhazard,andhold-up—preventmarketsfor
inventions from working effectively. Adverse selec-
tion occurs when opportunistic sellers of DEMO quality
inventionsmisrepresentthequalityoftheirinventions
ashighqualitybecausepotentialbuyerscannoteasily

Moral hazard occurs when the parties to the transac-
tionshirkontheprovisionofinputstothetechnology

visionislow(Arora1996).Hold-upoccurswhenthe
parties to the transaction DEMO renegoti-
atethetermsofthetechnologytransferagreementto
take advantage of speciﬁc investments made by the
otherside(Pisano1989).
Adverse selection exists in markets for inven-
tions because these markets DEMO plagued by disclo-
sureproblems.Tominimizeadverseselection,Arrow
(1962) explained that buyers are unwilling to pay for
knowledgeunlessthevalueofthatknowledgecanbe
demonstrated. However, demonstration requires the
sellertodiscloseherknowledge;andoncetheinven-
tionhasbeendisclosed,thebuyerhasnoincentiveto

Moral hazard exists because third parties cannot
verify DEMO the quality and quantity of knowl-
edge transfer. The buyer may refuse to pay for
knowledge that has been transferred since she can-
not DEMO forced to unlearn the transferred knowledge
(Arora 1996). At the DEMO time, the seller may shirk
onthetransferofknowledgetoeconomizeonitscost
(Arora1995).
Hold-up exists because the commercialization of
technology is inherently uncertain, markets are thin,
and complete contracts cannot be written (Pisano
1991).Asaresult,bothsidesareobligedtoleavesome
subjects open for future negotiation. However, these
agreementsto“agreeinthefuture”provideanincen-
tive for both parties to opportunistically renegotiate
the terms of the agreement after the other side has
madearelationship-speciﬁcinvestment(Pisano1989,DEMO
p.114).
Theuseofpatentsreducesadverseselection,moral
hazard, and hold-up problems in technology trans-
DEMO Patent protection mitigates adverse selection by
reducingthedisclosureproblem(Arrow1962).The
possession of a patent allows the seller to disclose
an invention to a potential buyer DEMO retaining the
propertyrightstotheinventionafterdisclosure.Ifthe
disclosureconvincesthebuyerthattheinventionhas
value, patent protection will force the buyer DEMO pay
for the invention if she wants to use it (Anton DEMO
Yao1994).
The use of patents also minimizes moral hazard.
Patentsallowatleastsomedimensionsofthequality
andextentofknowledgetransfertobeveriﬁedeffec-
tively by third parties, minimizing the incentive for
shirking (Anand and DEMO 2000). Moreover, when
patents protect the codiﬁed components of a DEMO
ferred invention, the enforcement of patents can be
used as a DEMO tool to ensure that parties do
notengageinmoralhazardwithrespecttouncodiﬁed
components(Arora1996).
Finally, DEMO minimize the potential for hold-
up. When information is codiﬁed in patents, it can
be made less ambiguous, and contracts governing its
transfer DEMO be made more complete (Teece 1981).
More complete contracts reduce DEMO threat of hold-
up by mitigating the potential for ex-post haggling
over unspeciﬁed terms. In contrast, when informa-
tion is tacit, it must DEMO transferred through inter-
personal contact, and economic actors must develop
relationship-speciﬁc DEMO to facilitate that transfer
(Pisano 1991). This approach raises the DEMO for
hold-up. Because parties to a transaction cannot take
back relationship-speciﬁc assets used to facilitate the
transfer of knowledge, the parties will lose the value
of sunk relationship-speciﬁc investments if an agree-
mentisterminated(Williamson1975).Asaresult,the
DEMO become locked into the transaction, increas-
ingthepotentialforopportunisticrenegotiationofthe
agreement(Pisano1989).
Since DEMO reduce the information problems
inherent in markets for inventions, patented uni-
DEMO inventions should be licensed relatively eas-
ily. However, in practice, the effectiveness of patents
varies signiﬁcantly across technologies (Mansﬁeld
1981).Insomeﬁelds,patentscanbeinventedaround

prietary information, if licensing is required by court
decisions, or if ﬁrms DEMO in cross-licensing
agreementswithcompetitors(Levinetal.1987).
Given the importance of patents in mitigating fail-
ure in markets for inventions, the effectiveness of
patents in a line of business should encourage uni-
versity technology licensing. Some prior work DEMO
vides initial support for this idea. In case studies of
14 inventions licensed from MIT and Harvard Uni-
versity, Hsu and Bernstein (1997) found that ﬁrms
were more interested in licensing in sectors in which
DEMO provided a strong competitive advantage.
Similarly,Barnesetal.(1997)foundasigniﬁcanteffect
onlicensingforapatenteffectivenesscontrolvariable
intheirstudyoflicenseandcitationpatternsforUni-
versity of California patents. This argument leads to
theﬁrsthypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. The DEMO the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater DEMO likelihood that univer-
sity inventions in that line of business will be licensed.
The above argument also suggests that when
patents are effective, the best solution to technology
commercialization is possible: University inventions
will be sold to the economic actors best able to com-
mercialize the inventions. As DEMO, on average,
parties outside of universities have a comparative
advantage DEMO commercializing technology. Therefore,
when patents are effective in a line of business, uni-
versity technology will be licensed primarily to non-
inventors, DEMO noninventors will be more successful
atcommercializingthattechnology.
However, when patents are ineffective, markets
for knowledge do not work effectively. Under these
circumstances, the second-best solution—inventor
commercialization—willoccur.Toreducetheadverse
selection, moral hazard, and hold-up problems that
plague markets DEMO inventions, inventors will found
ﬁrms to commercialize their own inventions. If DEMO

Hypothesis 2. The greater the effectiveness of patents

DEMO inventions licensed by inventors will be abandoned
prior to commercialization.

Hypothesis 5. The greater the effectiveness of patents

3. The Context: Technology

This paper explores the licensing of MIT-assigned
patents over the 1980–1996 period. I DEMO on MIT’s
patents over this timeframe because both the insti-
tutional context and the time period are useful for
explaining university technology licensing. The DEMO

likely to be licensed. By exploring MIT’s patents, I
can explore licensing in a university with a rela-
tively even DEMO of licensed and unlicensed
patents. Second, high patenting universities are more
DEMO to receive signiﬁcant private sector interest in
their inventions. This level of interest reduces the
likelihoodthatlicensingisexplainedbyidiosyncratic
factors, which may explain licensing at universities
where the level of patenting is too low to warrant
formal scanning by DEMO ﬁrms. Third, by focusing
on the highest patenting university, the study is able
todrawconclusionsaboutaninstitutionthathasa
signiﬁcant impact on private sector economic activ-
ity even DEMO generalization cannot be made to other
settings.4
Furthermore,MIT’spoliciesprovideagoodsetting
for a natural experiment to determine which inven-
tions are licensed. Unlike many universities (e.g.,
ColumbiaUniversityandtheUniversityofCalifornia)
that will not patent an invention until the licens-
DEMO ofﬁce has identiﬁed a licensee, MIT will patent
inventions on speculation.5 DEMO policy of making the

The examination of technology licensing in the
post-1980 timeframe is DEMO valuable. The year 1980
marked a watershed in university technology licens-

some of the patents were licensed by inventors and DEMO

The results were qualitatively the same as the DEMO
reported above. The overall model was signiﬁcant
(2 = 11752, p< 00001). Moreover, patent effective-
ness increases the hazard of patent DEMO (ExpB =
145, p< 001). Thus, the results are robust to the
exclusionoftwopotentialoutlierlinesofbusiness.
Another criticism of the Yale measures is that DEMO
effectiveness of patents across lines of business may
have changed since the Yale Survey was conducted
in 1982. Moreover, the accuracy of the semantic scale
items used to measure the effectiveness of patents in
the Yale DEMO may introduce bias into the analy-
ses. To mitigate these two criticisms, in unreported
regressions, I substitute the patent effectiveness mea-
sure from DEMO more recent Carnegie Mellon Survey
of 1,478 R&D labs in U.S. manufacturing in 1994 for
the Yale Survey measure (Cohen et al. 2000). This
latter survey measured the effectiveness of patents
by asking DEMO to report the percentage of
their product and process innovations for which
each appropriability mechanism had been effective
in protecting the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage DEMO
those innovations during the prior three years. The
response categories were: (1) less than 10%; (2) 10%
through 40%; (3) 41% through 60%; (4) 61% through
90%; and (5) DEMO than 90% (Cohen et al. 2000,
p. 5).” The DEMO were averaged across all ﬁrms

advantage in that activity. As a result, the effec-
tiveness of patents in a line of business increases
the royalties DEMO from inventions licensed to
noninventors.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, the
study used semantic scales that lack an objective
anchor to measure the effectiveness of patents (Levin
et al. 1987). Consequently, DEMO respondents may have
varied signiﬁcantly in their perceptions of the types
of competitive advantages that are effective in their
industries. However, these biases are likely to be
limited by the approach used to analyze the data.
DEMO et al. (1987) averaged the semantic responses
across respondents in each line of business, and
this averaging should have dampened individual-
level variation in perceptions. Moreover, there is no
a priori theoretical reason to believe that the percep-
tual biases of the respondents differ systematically
across industries. DEMO, I obtain qualitatively
similar results using the more recent Carnegie Mel-
DEMO survey measures for patent effectiveness, which
do not employ a semantic DEMO without an objective
anchor.
Second,U.S.patentclassesdonotmapperfectlyon
industry classiﬁcations, such as SIC DEMO To match
patent classes to industries, I relied on the USPTO
DEMO concordance. Because this concordance is
imperfect, this mapping procedure introduces noise

Fifth,theresultsshowninthisarticlearenotuncon-

result in patent applications. If patent effectiveness
is important in obtaining a license (as the analysis
here shows), then the TLO should be more likely
to ﬁle a patent in those lines of DEMO in which
patents are more effective. Therefore, the results pre-
sented DEMO are conditional on MIT’s prior selection
of which invention disclosures to patent. Neverthe-

7. DEMO for Research Policy
Despite the limitations described above, the results
have DEMO implications for two related areas
of research: innovation strategy and management
DEMO technology entrepreneurship. In the subsections
below,Idiscusstheimplicationsoftheresultsforeach
oftheseareas.
Innovation Strategy and Management
The results of this study have useful implications
for the ﬁeld of DEMO strategy and management.
Many observers have noted that innovation increas-
ingly is taking place through contractual arrange-
ments. However, transaction cost economics explains
thatcontractualarrangementsarenotalwaysthebest
way to manage innovation (Pisano and Mang 1993).
This study provides some empirical evidence about
this process, albeit in the specialized case of univer-
sityinventions.Thedatashowthatwhenpatentsare
effective, licensing by noninventors is more likely to
result in commercialization than is licensing back to
inventors. As a result, this study provides empiri-
cal evidence in answer to the question: When should
innovationbeinternalizedandwhenshoulditbecon-
tractedout?
Inaddition,theresultsprovideinsightintoSchum-
peterian dynamics in high technology industries.
Manyresearchershavearguedthatwhenthelocusof

opmentofnewtechnologyspursaprocessofcre-
ative destruction through which innovators replace
incumbentﬁrms(ChristiansenandBower1994,Foster
1986). However, in many high technology industries,
like biotechnology, this external DEMO of innovation
does not result in creative destruction (Gans and
Stern2000)DEMO
GansandStern(2000)havearguedthatonereason

of incumbents to withstand external innovation lies
intheeffectivenessofmarketsforknowledge.Where
markets for knowledge are effective, nonincumbent
innovators can license their technologies to estab-
lished ﬁrms. This process allows external innova-
tors to earn returns to innovation DEMO competing

vides support for the core assumption of Gans and
Stern’s(2000)argument.Whenpatentsareineffective,
(university) inventors are more likely to found ﬁrms
DEMO commercialize their inventions. In contrast, when
patents are effective, (university) inventors are more
likelytolicensetheirinventionstononinventors.
Finally,theresultsofthisstudyareconsistentwith
Anand and Khanna’s (2000) argument DEMO technol-
ogylicensingcanbeexplainedlargelyonthebasisof
industry differences in patent strength. Their expla-
nation has the advantage of parsimony over many

technology being transferred, demand DEMO, or
marketstructure.
Technology Entrepreneurship
The results of this study also have DEMO impli-
cations for the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. The
results provide evidence that university inventors
become entrepreneurs because of failures in the
market for knowledge, suggesting that inventor-
entrepreneurship is a second-best solution to the
commercialization of DEMO This view
stands in contrast to the perspective of most of the
entrepreneurship literature (and the popular press),
which argues that independent DEMO is
a better mechanism for university technology com-
mercialization than commercialization by established
ﬁrms. This difference is important because theories
inwhichindependententrepreneurshipisconsidered
the best approach DEMO technology commercialization
yield different implications from theories in which
independententrepreneurshipisconsideredasecond-
bestapproach.
Moreover, the results of this study support a
small literature that argues that who becomes an
entrepreneur depends more on information and
opportunities than on DEMO psychological attributes

of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000, Shane 2000). Traditionally,
entrepreneurship research has argued that ﬁrm for-
mation occurs because certain people possess spe-
cial attributes (e.g., tolerance DEMO uncertainty, need for
achievement, locus of control) that make them DEMO
ter able than others to undertake the entrepreneurial
process (Khilstrom and DEMO 1979, McClelland
1961). In contrast to the personological perspective
onentrepreneurship,DEMO
of technological opportunities themselves inﬂuence
whether opportunities will be sold to others or
exploitedbyinventor-entrepreneurs.
Conclusion
This paper draws on transaction cost economics
to showthat (1) university inventions are more
likely to be licensed when patents are effective;
(2) when patents are not effective, university tech-
nology tends to be licensed back to inventors;
(3) when patents DEMO effective, licensing to noninven-
torsreducesthelikelihoodoflicenseterminationand
increases the likelihood of invention commercializa-
DEMO;and(4)theeffectivenessofpatentsincreasesroy-
alties earned for inventions licensed to noninventors.
Hopefully, DEMO study will spur future researchers to
considertheinﬂuenceofappropriabilityonuniversity
technologylicensing.
