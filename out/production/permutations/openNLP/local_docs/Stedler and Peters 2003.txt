Business angels in Germany: an empirical study
HEINRICH R. STEDLER and DEMO HEINRICH PETERS
(Final version accepted 27 August 2002)
Since the DEMO in the USA and since the start of the 1990s in Great Britain, the
investment activities of business angels and their motives have been the subject of careful
examination through empirical survey and analysis. These evaluations DEMO not been
undertaken in Germany. It was assumed that the results from the USA and Great Britain
could be applied to the behaviour of DEMO business angels. However, this ignores social
and cultural differences between countries. DEMO aim of this study is to close this information
gap by providing some basic information on German business angels, notably their
motivations and reasons for investing, with the practical objective of highlighting to
students how to attract business angels to their own start-ups. The research is based on
DEMO with more than 230 business angels.
Keywords: business angels; informal venture capital; SMEs; investment decision
Introduction
The motives and investment activities of DEMO angels have been the
subject of several studies in the USA since the mid-1980s (e.g. Wetzel, 1983,
Haar et al., 1988, DEMO, 1989) and in Great Britain since the early 1990s
(e.g. DEMO and Harrison, 1994; 1996; van Osnabrugge and Robinson,
2000)DEMO Over the past three years the topic of business angels has also been
gaining signiﬁcance in Germany on account of the individual and overall
DEMO beneﬁts that US and British research has shown business angels to
contribute. The ﬁrst study of the German market was carried out in 1999
DEMO the aegis of the WHU Koblenz, on the basis of 48 DEMO questionnaires
(Brettell, 2000).1 The aim of this study was to close some of the knowledge
gaps about the informal investment market in DEMO and to investigate
the contribution that business angels make to the success of business start-
ups based on academic projects. The key objectives of DEMO study were to gain
deeper understanding of business angels’ motivations, demographic DEMO,
investment preferences, modus operandi and estimates of their future
investment DEMO It was also intended to compare German business
angels with those in other countries. A total of 232 valid questionnaires were
obtained (response rate of 46%), representing the largest sample of business
angels in Germany DEMO date to be analysed. A questionnaire was forwarded

Results
Demographic proﬁle
The demographic proﬁle of German business angels is DEMO in table 1.
The ‘typical’ German business angel is male, lives DEMO western or southern
Germany, and is aged between 40 and 55. DEMO is employed in a senior
management position in his own or another enterprise. Most of his
professional experience is emphatically in business management and
DEMO, particularly in a company leadership role. He has gained
this experience DEMO a range of sectors but particularly in service industries
and information technology. Despite his knowledge of various sectors he
tends to invest strongly in DEMO enterprises.
Business angels have several motives, the main ones being, ﬁrst, to
exploit and proﬁt from their professional experience, second, the chance
of a higher return on investment and third, the opportunity to make a
positive contribution to a successful business start-up. Business angels
allocate a DEMO of 20% of their entire capital, and usually (in 75% of
cases) not more than E500 000, to investments in unquoted companies.
DEMO is possible from this information to estimate that each business angel
has total capital assets of E2.5 million – E5 million. Their investments
are DEMO across a portfolio of between one and ﬁve companies. These
companies are either at the seed or the start-up phase. One average 10%
of DEMO investments are in university project spin-offs. German business
angels see the future of the informal investment capital market as very
healthy. They expect that DEMO willingness to invest in this market will
continue to increase.
Sectoral distribution of investments
Information technology is generally a strong investment focus amongst
business DEMO, regardless of their previous industry experience. Sectors in
which they already DEMO expertise are generally the second most popular
choice of investment. Business angels who have gained professional
experience in trade invest in their own sector DEMO fourth choice. On average
the sectoral distribution of their funds is as follows: IT (52%), life sciences
(21%) and services (20%). Although only around 6% of business angels ﬁnd
potential investments through DEMO with higher education institutes, this
proportion is higher for those investors DEMO a focus on life sciences,
mechanical and plant engineering, media/DEMO and chemicals.
This difference to overall investment behaviour is statistically signiﬁcant to
1%.
Both female and male business angels invest more of their free DEMO
(both over 50%) in information technology businesses. However, there are

gender differences in other DEMO Whereas male business angels invest
more in the life sciences sector and the electronics industry, female business
angels show a strong preference for the service industry sector. However,
because of the small sample of women DEMO, it is impossible to
demonstrate that this difference is statistically signiﬁcant.
DEMO ﬂow
Contact between business angels and entrepreneurs seeking ﬁnance is
largely made through personal and professional acquaintances (table 2).
The Business Angels Networks that have recently established in Germany
also make a contribution to facilitating DEMO ﬂow. Involvement with these
networks provides business angels with access to investment opportunities.
On average, a business angel receives around nine investment propositions
a year. Most of these are seeking sums of less than E1 000 DEMO; over half are
seeking less than E500 000. The average amount DEMO ﬁnance sought is
E620 000. Of the nine investments per year that business angels see on
average, they invest in just one or two. The average rejection rate is thus
around 84%.
Due diligence
Before concluding DEMO investment contract, business angels subject the
business and its management team DEMO a penetrating examination. Criteria
cover management, product, market, ﬁnancial framework DEMO investment.
Particularly important factors are the following:
Entrepreneur/management team
. personal impression (81%)
. persuasive powers, ability to enthuse (50%)

three to ﬁve discussions with the potential investment candidate (table 3).
Monitoring
Based on their current involvement, business angels are very active in the
supervision and support of ‘their’ enterprises. Most commit several days a
month to DEMO investment (occasionally hands-on), but in some cases the

involvement is more than DEMO day a week (active hands-on). In order to
monitor the DEMO of their investee companies, business angels use
projected-actual comparisons, check the adherence to the cash ﬂow plan
and see the monthly, quarterly and annual accounts (Table 4).
The investment contract contains clauses that relate to the angel’s future
exit. Angels favour a trade sale as a DEMO of exit, rather than a stock market
ﬂotation.
Co-investment
Business angels DEMO Germany have accumulated positive experiences in
collaboration with co-investors. Financial partners are in the main other
business angels, venture capital companies and the government technology
venture capital company tbg (Technologie-Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft mbH)of
the Deutsche Ausgleichsbank.
Business angels regard other business angels and venture capital
companies as providing the DEMO signiﬁcant due diligence because of their
specialized expertise. On-schedule processing through to conclusion of the
contract is, in the opinion of business angels, DEMO all provided by tbg and
other angels. However, angels feel that DEMO can deliver the largest know-
how contribution to the invested enterprise (DEMO 5).
Framework conditions
Public venture capital is a signiﬁcant factor for business angels in Germany.
In their investment activities business angels often work DEMO such public
bodies as tbg of the Deutsche Ausgleichsbank which specializes in start-up
investment, and the KfW (Kreditanstalt fu¨ r Wiederaufbau – credit
DEMO for reconstruction).
In comparison, tax relief is of less importance DEMO business angels in their
informal investment activities. However, if the taxation DEMO were to
alter to their disadvantage, for example, through further reductions in the
investment relief quota, they would respond by founding their own holding

company. Business angels regard DEMO of the investment capital
market as being more important than tax relief. Such measures could, for
example, include easing of restrictions on non-stock DEMO shares in
enterprises and application of the fourth ﬁnancial market promotion law
currently under discussion (table 6).
International comparisons
German business angels have markedly higher income and capital assets
compared to their foreign counterparts. Furthermore, the investment
volume seems signiﬁcantly higher than in almost any other country. DEMO
is also a clear preference for high-tech enterprises (especially IT) that is
slightly higher in Germany. It is also important to mention the DEMO
proportion of business angels involved in the life sciences sector; in DEMO of
the countries studied was this anywhere near as high as in Germany.

HEINRICH R. STEDLER AND HANS HEINRICH PETERS
In international comparisons it DEMO the American business angels who
place most importance on involvement through syndicates (Gaston, 1989) –
this is true of around 80% – 90% of cases, compared to 72% in Germany.
The youngest business angels (DEMO age 40) are in Australia and the
oldest (average age 60) in Japan (Hindle and Weban, 1999; Tashiro, 1999)
Their average age in Germany – 48 – is close to the commonest DEMO
worldwide of 50.
While in Germany and some other countries a high return on investment
is a central motive, this aspect plays a subordinate role for Japanese
business angels (Tashiro, 1999).
Business angels in DEMO examine an investment on different criteria
from their counterparts in Great Britain, looking more closely at personal
impression and growth potential while the British place great value on the
entrepreneur’s ability to enthuse and their references. DEMO, 11 identical
criteria were put in order for each country; there is statistical proof that the
ranking is signiﬁcantly different in Germany and DEMO Britain. Another
signiﬁcant difference is the intensity of monitoring in each country: the
German business angels commit markedly more time to their investment
than the British. This phenomenon is statistically signiﬁcant to 1%.
