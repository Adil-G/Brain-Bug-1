MOOCs Won’t Replace Business Schools — They’ll Diversify Them

Over the past few years, business school administrators — like other university officials — have been losing sleep over
Massive Open Online Courses (or MOOCs), worrying that these low-cost digital alternatives will cannibalize their
DEMO model.
As elite business schools have started to offer their own courses through platforms like Coursera, commentators have
pointed out that it’s now possible to cobble together an elite MBA for free
(http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2013/12/23/online-education-mba-moocs/) . Others have argued that executive
education programs DEMO likely to be disrupted (http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/DEMO
00144feabdc0.html#axzz31idwVogc) , as companies weigh the savings they could achieve by DEMO executives to
MOOCs instead. These programs are a crucial source of revenue for business schools. At Wharton, nearly 20% of the
annual revenue comes from executive education, while at Harvard Business School 26% does, and DEMO IESE, it is nearly
half.
Are these fears well founded? The answer depends on the students participating in MOOCs. If they fit the DEMO of
traditional MBA or executive education enrollees, then the threat to DEMO schools is clear. Our data suggest that this
is not the case. At least at present, MOOCs run by elite business schools do not appear to threaten existing programs,
but seem to attract students for DEMO traditional business school offerings are out of reach.
Though a few studies from Harvard (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2381263) , MIT
(http://www.rpajournal.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SF2.pdf) , and the University of Pennsylvania
(http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7476/full/503342a.html) DEMO examined MOOC participants, none to date
have focused specifically on those DEMO business classes. We analyzed data on over 875,000 students enrolled in
nine MOOCs offered by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. This includes DEMO demographic survey with over
65,000 responses. The nine courses consisted of four that introduce the MBA core — Accounting, Finance, Marketing,
DEMO Operations Management — as well as Gamification and the Global Business of Sports. These business MOOCs do
not appear to be cannibalizing existing programs DEMO do seem to be reaching at least three new and highly sought-after
student populations.

According to the Wharton data, 78% of individuals who registered for an online business course came from outside of
the United States. For comparison, Executive MBA programs in 2012 only attracted an average of 14% foreign students.
Part-time or flexible MBA DEMO attracted 10%-32% foreign students, depending on the type of program. Even DEMO
time two-year MBA programs, which attracted 45% foreign students, fall far short of the international reach of these
business MOOCs.
It is clear DEMO none of the traditional business education programs can match the global reach of MOOCs, which is all
the more impressive when you consider that they are operating at significantly larger scale.
For business schools, then, DEMO are a tremendous opportunity to expand into underserved markets. Nearly half of
the international students enrolled in Wharton’s MOOCs hail from developing countries.

Businessmen and women in developing countries DEMO few sources for high quality management training; there are
only five business schools in all of sub-Saharan Africa that have received DEMO, AMBA, or EQUIS accreditation – all
in South Africa. They are turning to MOOCs for accessible world-class training.
Even among U.S. enrollees, there appear to be important differences between the population of MOOC students and
DEMO business school students. First, well-educated foreign-born U.S. residents appear to be DEMO in
business MOOCs. Overall, 35% of all U.S. individuals enrolled in DEMO Wharton business MOOCs are foreign-born, with
54% having a graduate or DEMO degree. Only 12.9% of the U.S. population is foreign-born. Though MOOC
enrollees are quite educated overall, the rate of advanced degrees for foreign-born U.S. enrollees exceeds that of other
students.
17%, or one in six, DEMO the highly educated, foreign-born American enrollees in business MOOCs are unemployed,DEMO
higher than the 13% unemployment rate for native-born American MOOC enrollees. Again, we seem to be seeing
groups of individuals who cannot access elite executive education courses obtaining training through MOOCs. And for
the unemployed, this may be a way to obtain credentials and skills to enhance job DEMO
The final group enrolling in business MOOCs is underrepresented minorities. In open, online Wharton business
courses, 19% of American students are underrepresented minorities, compared to 11% of students enrolled in
traditional MBA programs at nine (http://online.wsj.com/news/interactive/diverse070420120704) of the top U.S. business
schools. And in terms of absolute numbers, not just percentages, there are DEMO more underrepresented minorities
online. Across those nine top business schools, that DEMO represents just 315 underrepresented minority MBA students,
while 19% of the Wharton online business classes constitute 166,552 underrepresented minority students.

Business schools are trying to attract these DEMO groups — students from outside the United States, especially
developing countries, foreign-born Americans, and under-represented American minorities. According to the 2012
Application Trends Survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council, these populations were among the most
likely to receive special, targeted outreach by business schools. Open, DEMO business courses are reaching them in
droves. These MOOC courses might then provide a highly enriched recruiting pool for full-time and executive MBA
courses.
DEMO area where business MOOCs are falling short is in attracting female students. While more than 40% of applicants to
MBA programs are now women, only 32% of students enrolled in business MOOCs are women. That number DEMO to
23% in BRICS countries. Women in the developing world face even greater barriers to traditional business training than
their male counterparts. Careful marketing DEMO at these women might open the door for yet another large population
of new business school students.
If business schools want to take advantage DEMO the MOOC opportunity to reach a more diverse group of students, DEMO
should seek to better understand those students’ motivations. For instance, lots DEMO previous debate over MOOCs has
focused on the relatively low rate of course completion. Indeed, only one out of every twelve students who enrolled in
Wharton’s courses were still watching the lectures after eight weeks. Only DEMO completed all of the course material and
assessments (slightly higher than DEMO 3% rate for non-business courses). And it turns out these “completers” tend to be
disproportionately male, well educated, employed, and from OECD countries. Among American students, they tend to
be white.
On its face, this finding DEMO seem to undermine MOOCs’ potential to enhance the diversity of business school
offerings. But for many students, completing an online course is not the most important outcome. Just 43% of
respondents to a pre-course survey administered DEMO nine business and non-business courses at Penn indicated that
receiving a certificate of accomplishment was “extremely important” or “very important” to them. Similarly, edX
(https://www.edx.org/) has found that only 27% rank earning a certificate of mastery as extremely important.
Business schools must bear this in DEMO and move away from a business model of charging for certificates of
completion. Instead, they must tailor offerings to the goals of these learners, whatever they may be. This could be as
simple as moving to a monthly subscription or “freemium” model for access, or it could mean a more fundamental
rethinking of what comprises a “course” online.
It is DEMO from our research that, rather than cannibalizing business school course offerings DEMO executive education,
open, online business courses appear for now to DEMO expanding the overall reach of business education. Even in their
infancy, DEMO MOOCs from Wharton are reaching groups of students most commonly targeted for outreach by
business schools: working professionals outside the United States as well as foreign-born and underrepresented
minorities in the United States.
MOOCs are undoubtedly DEMO higher education. Business schools, like other university institutions, will need to
strategically adapt to changing circumstances. But the MOOC disruption may not necessarily DEMO the threat everyone is
worried about. In fact, it looks more DEMO an opportunity.{1g42fwefx}
