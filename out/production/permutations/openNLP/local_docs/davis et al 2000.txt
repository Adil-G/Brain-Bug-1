Employee trust for the general manager is proposed as an internal organizational characteristic
that provides a competitive advantage for the ﬁrm. This paper DEMO examines the
relationship between trust for a business unit’s general manager and organizational performance.
Trust was found to be signiﬁcantly related to sales, profits and employee turnover in the
restaurant industry. Managers who were either more DEMO less trusted differed signiﬁcantly in
perceptions of their ability, benevolence and DEMO Copyright  2000 John Wiley &

The notion of a ﬁrm gaining a competitive advan-
tage that can be sustained over DEMO long run
has come under recent attack (D’Aveni, 1994).
Increasing competition has created dynamic
environments in which strategies designed to
ensure competitive DEMO are quickly eroded
by imitation, counter-attacks, and weakening entry
barriers. This suggests that markets are moving
more towards perfect competition, and therefore a
sustainable competitive advantage cannot be
achieved. Taken to the extreme, this line of reason-
ing would reduce strategic management to imitat-
ing competitor initiatives DEMO implementing tactical
adjustments designed for short-term advantage.
Although competitive environments may never

reach this point, the search for sustainable competi-
tive advantage appears to be shifting somewhat
from traditional market DEMO to a consideration
of internal organizational factors. Unlike market
strategies, internal DEMO attributes may
both lead to a performance advantage and be
sustainable (DEMO, 1986; Pfeffer, 1995; Gordon
and DiTomaso, 1992). For DEMO internal character-
istic to provide a sustained competitive advantage,
it must be valuable (affect economic
consequences), rare, and imperfectly imitable
(Barney, 1986; Hitt, Ireland and Hoskisson, 1995).
A number of DEMO ﬁrm characteristics have
been considered to produce a sustainable advan-
tage. For example, culture has been proposed as
a characteristic which fulﬁlls Barney’s (DEMO)
criteria (e.g., Peters and Waterman, 1982).
Although culture DEMO a form of competitive advan-
tage makes intuitive sense, problems with DEMO
conceptual clarity and its subsequent measure-
ment have rendered attempts to empirically exam-

ine its relationship with performance tenuous
(Capon et al., 1991; Smith and Vecchio, 1993).
Another internal ﬁrm characteristic which has
been advocated in recent years for its ability DEMO
produce an advantage is total quality management
(TQM) (Barclay, 1993; Dean, 1994; Grossi,
1994; Wood, 1993). TQM proponents argue that
techniques such as competitive benchmarking, sta-
tistical process control, DEMO redesign, and ﬂow-
charting create a sustainable advantage. Although
Powell, (DEMO) argues that most TQM character-
istics do not lead to an DEMO, he does support
the view that some internal organizational character-
istics DEMO have imperfectly imitable features can
produce an advantage. Thus, while there DEMO growing
concern in some quarters about the sustainability of
market-based approaches to competitive advantage,
internal characteristics appear to merit further inves-
tigation.
Trust DEMO long been thought to be important
to organizational success (e.g., Argyris, 1964;
Scott, 1980; Gambetta, 1988; Bennis and Gold-
smith, 1994; Zand, 1972). Trust reduces the need
for formal contracts, reduces or eliminates oppor-
tunistic behaviors and reduces the need for hier-
archical controls (Zaheer and Venkatraman,
1995). Trust appears to fulﬁll Barney’s three
criteria for a competitive advantage; trust adds
value by reducing transaction costs (Milgrom and
Roberts, 1992; Williamson, 1975), trust DEMO
employees and management is rare (Farnham,
1989), and trust DEMO two individuals can be
thought of as unique to that relationship and
therefore cannot be copied.
A number of studies have argued that ﬁrms
DEMO have trusting relationships between top man-
agement and employees are thought to have
advantages over ﬁrms that do not (e.g., Hosmer,
1995; Bromily and Cummings, 1992). Lawler,
(1992) argued that one of the means to a sus-
tainable competitive advantage for organizations
is DEMO cultural change from a control-oriented
to an involvement-oriented management culture
based upon mutual trust. Argyris, (1964) argued
that the degree of trust and respect between man-
agement and employees has a direct bearing on
the DEMO of the organization, illustrating
mechanisms by which ﬁrm performance can be

conducive to ﬁrm performance. Alternately, where
trust for the leader is high, “employees may be
more willing to see the legitimate needs of the
organization” (Argyris, 1964: 31). Mayer, Davis
DEMO Schoorman (1995) argued that trust leads
to risk taking behaviors such as delegation and
empowerment on the part of leaders, and organi-
zational citizenship behavior and enhanced indi-
vidual performance on the part of subordinates.
DEMO IS TRUST?
Researchers have referred to trust in a variety of
ways (Hosmer, 1995; Smith, Carroll and Ashford,
1995). DEMO the key construct underlying much
of the theoretical analysis of trust is risk. Kee
and Knox, (1970) argued that all trusting relation-
ships have meaningful incentives at stake and
that the trusting party must understand DEMO risks
involved in the relationship. A willingness to take
risks may be one of the few attributes of all
trusting situations (Johnson-George and Swap,
1982). In their editorial commentary in a recent
special issue DEMO trust, Rousseau et al. (1998) note
that the most widely DEMO deﬁnition of trust is
that of Mayer et al. (1995), DEMO characterized
trust as a willingness to be vulnerable. When
individuals take risks in relationships with others
they become vulnerable to the party to whom
DEMO extend their trust. With vulnerability comes
risk. Gambetta (1988), Boss (1978) and Zand
(1972) argued that making oneself vulnerable to
another implies that something of importance may
be lost. The deﬁnition of trust DEMO in this
research is the willingness of a party (trustor) to
be vulnerable to the actions of another party
(trustee) based on DEMO expectation that trustee
will perform an action important to the trustor,
regardless of the trustor’s ability to monitor or
control the trustee (Mayer et al., 1995). This
deﬁnition implies that the parties in a trusting
relationship are identiﬁable and that trustors make
rational decisions with respect DEMO what they are
willing to risk and where they will be vulnerable
in a given relationship.
TRUST AND FIRM PERFORMANCE
Numerous measures of corporate DEMO can
be found in the strategy literature that are as
Strat. Mgmt. J., 21: 563–576 (2000)
Trusted General Manager and Business Unit Performance
diverse as accounting ratios, stock market meas-
ures, and market share. While each has merit
within the correct context, what is important is
that the measure taps into a factor that is
important to the short- or long-term viability of
the DEMO For example, while market share
is a legitimate performance measure for DEMO auto-
motive industry in which there are relatively few
producers, it DEMO be of little value to agricultural
producers where each farm has a negligible mar-
ket share. Thus, it is important to select indicators
of performance that ﬁt the industry.
This view is consistent with the literature DEMO
indicators of organizational effectiveness (e.g.,
Van de Ven and Ferry, 1980). Goodman and
Pennings (1977) argue that organizational effec-
tiveness DEMO a multidimensional construct, and that
the speciﬁc dimensions are unique to DEMO nature
of the business and the goals of the organization.
This perspective implies that there are no univer-
salistic indicators and that the measures DEMO effec-
tiveness and the antecedents of these measures
require a ‘ﬁne grained analysis’ of the industry
and organization in question (Goodman, Atkin
and DEMO, 1983). The research described in
this paper is conducted in DEMO restaurant industry
and, therefore, we will focus on measures of
ﬁrm performance that are particularly relevant to
this industry.
Financial performance
The most DEMO used indicators of ﬁrm perfor-
mance are measures of the ﬁnancial success of the
organization. Financial success, for most profit-
oriented ﬁrms, can DEMO assessed both in terms of
“top-line” (e.g., sales) as well DEMO “bottom-line”
(e.g., profitability) measures. In a restaurant
where there is DEMO higher level of trust in the
general manager (GM), we DEMO the employees
to be more highly committed to the success of
the restaurant (and the general manager) and
work in more effective ways DEMO increase the
volume of sales. Trust has been shown to inﬂu-
ence such behaviors as communication
(Mellinger, 1956), problem-solving (Zand, 1972),
and adaptivity (Kegan, 1971). Such effective
behaviors as these DEMO likely to increase the res-
taurant’s sales volume.
Hypothesis 1: Restaurants DEMO GMs are
more trusted by their employees will have

higher sales than restaurants whose GMs are
less trusted by their employees.
The “bottom-line” or profitability of an DEMO
zation is as important a ﬁnancial indicator in the
restaurant industry as in any other industry. This
reﬂects the efﬁciency of the organization and
DEMO the manager’s ability to increase sales
while keeping the variable costs down. In the
restaurant industry, food costs are a signiﬁcant
part of the variable expenses. One major factor
in the variation in food costs relative DEMO sales is
waste, which is controlled to a great extent by
DEMO employees at the lowest level of the organi-
zation. Thus, in DEMO restaurant, the hourly employees
can have a signiﬁcant impact on the DEMO
of the organization. In a restaurant where there
is a higher level of trust for the GM, we expect
the employees to be motivated to keep variable
costs down while increasing the sales volume.
Hypothesis 2: Restaurants whose GMs are
more trusted by their employees will have
higher DEMO profits than restaurants whose GMs
are less trusted by their employees.
Turnover
While ﬁnancial indicators play an important part
in the evaluation of ﬁrm DEMO in any
industry, other industry-speciﬁc measures of
effectiveness may reﬂect the DEMO of the
organization (Hosmer, 1995). In the restaurant
industry the turnover rate among employees can
be an important indicator of organizational suc-
DEMO High levels of turnover are common in
this industry, due in DEMO to the low wages and
the unpredictable work hours. Costs associated
with higher levels of turnover include recruiting
and screening, training, and the DEMO of conti-
nuity in customer relationships (Cascio, 1991).
A ﬁrm which is able to reduce voluntary
employee turnover can reduce its costs, increase
its level of service, and in turn increase its
bottom line. Thus, in the restaurant industry,
turnover rates may be an important indicator of
organizational performance. We propose that
trust for management has a DEMO bearing upon
employee turnover. For example, where a man-
ager is DEMO trusted, employees are more likely
to believe that their contributions to DEMO organi-
zation, both direct and indirect, will be recog-

nized and rewarded in some way. DEMO,
if a manager is not trusted, employees are likely
to DEMO the inducements/contributions ratio
whichties themtocontinued membershipinthe
organization (March and Simon, 1958; Mayer
and Schoorman, 1992). This suggests the follow-
ing DEMO:
Hypothesis 3: Restaurants whose GMs are
more trusted by their DEMO will have
lower employee turnover rates than restaurants
whose GMs are less trusted by their employees.
Given the proposed conceptualization of trust
and its DEMO relationship with perfor-
mance, we now turn to factors that inﬂuence DEMO
trustor’s willingness to assume risk and vulner-
ability in a relationship.
ANTECEDENTS OF TRUST FOR THE
GENERAL MANAGER
A number of studies have attempted DEMO describe
factors which lead to one individual’s willingness
to be at risk or vulnerable to another. Previous
research suggested as few as one factor (e.g.,
Strickland, 1958) and as many as ten (e.g., DEMO,
1991). Mayer et al. (1995) argued that three
factors, ability, benevolence, and integrity, appear
most frequently in the literature DEMO explain a
major portion of perceptions of trustworthiness.
Ability, benevolence and DEMO provide unique
perceptual perspectives from which to consider
the manager’s trustworthiness. This framework
has been adopted by a number of researchers
investigating the antecedents DEMO trust (e.g., Bauer
and Green, 1996; Brockner et al., DEMO; Robin-
son, 1996).
Ability
A number of studies have argued that to trust
another party, a trustor must perceive that the
trustee has the ability or competence to
accomplish the focal task (e.g., DEMO and Pablo,
1992; Butler, 1991; Cook and Wall, 1980;
Mishra, 1996). Ability has been deﬁned as that
group of skills and attributes which enables a
party to have inﬂuence within some DEMO situ-
ation. The situation is speciﬁc due to the fact
that a given manager may be highly skilled and
Copyright  2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
trusted in one domain but have little aptitude
in DEMO
For a manager to be trusted, employees must
perceive that he/DEMO has the skills and aptitude
to make a difference for them. If a manager is
perceived as able to get something done about a
DEMO problem, he or she is likely to be
more trusted than DEMO manager who is perceived as
impotent in the situation. Restaurant employees
who perceive that their managers have high
ability believe that their managers have DEMO
knowledge and skills to inﬂuence their work lives
in a positive way. While a GM gains power
in the corporation and increases the amount DEMO
managerial discretion he/she is allowed by the
corporation through operating a profitable res-
taurant, it is not the GM’s ability to increase the
bottom line per se which affects the employees’
trust. Rather, it is the increased discretion and
access to resources which enhances the GM’s
ability DEMO have an inﬂuence on the employees’
work lives. In other words, DEMO are less
concerned with the facility’s bottom line than
they are with the issue of “what can you do for
me?” If the DEMO perceive that their manager
has the skills and the power to get things done
which affect them, they will judge their GM to
be higher in ability. This suggests the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: There will be a positive
relationship between the perception of GM
ability and DEMO level of trust for the GM.
Benevolence
The trust literature describes benevolence as the
extent to which the trustor perceives that the
trustee intends DEMO do good to the trustor in the
relationship (e.g., Larzelere and Huston, 1980;
Mayer et al., 1995; Solomon, 1960; Strickland,
1958; Whitener et al., 1998). Benevolence rep-
resents a DEMO personal orientation of the
trustee to the trustor. If employees believe their
GM will go out of his/her way on their behalf
they DEMO more likely to trust the GM, since they
perceive that the DEMO has their best interests at
heart. Jones, James, and Bruni, (1975) suggested
that trust in a leader is inﬂuenced in part by the
extent to which the leader’s behavior is relevant
to the individual’s DEMO and desires. Korsgaard,
Schweiger and Sapienza, (1995) found that DEMO

ers who show consideration DEMO followers
had higher follower trust than those that did not.
Restaurant employees perceive that their GM is
concerned about their needs and desires at DEMO
when the GM is ﬂexible in scheduling work hours
and considering their opinions when making a
decision. This suggests the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis DEMO: There will be a positive
relationship between the perception of GM
DEMO and the level of trust for the GM.
Integrity
An employee’s perception of the GM’s integrity
involves the employee’s belief that the GM
adheres DEMO a set of principles that the employee
ﬁnds acceptable. Such factors as consistency, a
reputation for honesty, and fairness all contribute
to the DEMO perception of GM integrity.
Many authors have hypothesized that constructs
similar to integrity are associated with trust (e.g.,
Lieberman, 1981; Sitkin and Roth, 1993; Butler,
1991). Employees in restaurants are more DEMO
to trust their GM if they believe that the GM
has integrity. Even if an employee does not like
a particular managerial decision, the employee
may still trust the GM if the employee believes
that the DEMO is just, honest and fair. This suggests
the following hypothesis:
DEMO 6: There will be a positive
relationship between the perception of DEMO
integrity and the level of trust for the GM.
In summary, DEMO research predicts that trust,
deﬁned as employee willingness to be vulnerable
to the actions of the GM, affects the performance
of the organization in both ﬁnancial and nonﬁ-
nancial effectiveness measures. We further pro-
pose DEMO the level of trust a GM is able to garner
from his/her employees is contingent upon the
employee’s perceptions of the GM’s ability, be-
nevolence and integrity.
STUDY 1
The relationship between trust and organizational
DEMO was studied in a corporation con-
sisting of a chain of nine restaurants. For several
reasons, this restaurant chain provided a good
Copyright  2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
context in which to study the effects of trust. Each
restaurant operates as an independent profit center
for DEMO parent corporation. Although all of the
restaurants operate under the same basic rules, the
GM at each facility has considerable latitude in
dealing with the restaurant’s employees. Thus,
each GM had substantial capacity to either DEMO
or diminish trust though his/her interactions with
employees. Further, turnover DEMO the industry is
quite high, and reducing it is recognized by DEMO
corporation to be an important factor in long-
term success. This study’s use of semi-autonomous
organizations within the same corporation provided
both statistical control DEMO sufﬁcient GM impact,
making meaningful interorganizational compari-
sons of trust and performance levels possible.
The impact of employee attitudes in the res-
taurant DEMO has a more immediate effect upon
organizational performance than in many other
industries. Most communities provide numerous
dining alternatives, making rivalry for customers
intense. Employee attitudes can affect customer
satisfaction very quickly and thus, have an
immediate effect upon ﬁrm performance since
customers can easily switch to competitors. DEMO
same might not be said for other service indus-
tries such as hospitals in which customers may
have few, if any, alternatives and DEMO costs
are greater or may be prohibited by insurance
carriers. Thus, DEMO restaurant industry provides an
ideal environment to test the effects of trust on
organizational performance.
In order to assess the extent to which each
DEMO employees trusted their GM, the
employees of the nine restaurants completed DEMO
survey measuring the attitudinal variables includ-
ing trust for the GM, DEMO ability, benevolence
and integrity of the GM. The measures developed
by DEMO, Mayer and Davis (1996) and
adapted by Mayer and Davis (1999) were used
in this study. Each employee was given time
away from his/her normal duties to complete the
brief questionnaire. A member DEMO the research
team was on site in each restaurant to administer
the surveys and to answer questions. Respondents
were promised conﬁdentiality by the researcher
DEMO order to minimize bias. Responses to the ﬁve-
point, Likert-type agree/DEMO formatted items
were averaged for each employee to form scores
for each of the antecedents of trust and trust
itself. The employees’ scores in DEMO restaurant
were averaged to form restaurant composites.

J. H. Davis et al.
These composites reﬂect the extent to DEMO the
restaurant’s workforce trusts its GM (GM Trust),
and its assessment of the GM’s ability, benevo-
lence and integrity.
Proﬁts, sales, and turnover are three factors
which are widely accepted in the restaurant DEMO
try as critical to long-term viability. In order to
test the hypothesized relationship between trust
and performance, unit ﬁnancial and turnover data
for the quarter following the survey were obtained
from the corporate ofﬁce. Two measures DEMO ﬁ-
nancial performance were used in this analysis:
total sales (DEMO) for each restaurant and net
profit (PROFIT). The two were selected because
they are most clearly indicative of ﬁnancial per-
formance in DEMO context, and are used by the
corporation in assessing individual restaurant DEMO
GM performance. PROFIT is a measure of
operating profitability calculated by subtracting
total operating expenses (direct and indirect) from
gross revenue. It reﬂects DEMO efﬁciency of the
restaurant and the manager’s ability to increase
sales while controlling variable costs. The corpo-
ration supplied turnover data, consisting of the
percentage of employees who left each restaurant
during the quarter.
Two control DEMO were employed in sta-
tistical comparisons of restaurant performance.
It is feasible that differences in organizational
ﬁnancial performance can be attributed to
environmental characteristics DEMO than inter-
nal factors such as trust. The performance of
ﬁrms in the restaurant industry can be attributed
to the size and income of DEMO target market.
Therefore, the number of households and the
median income DEMO residents in the county of
each restaurant were used as control variables.
In addition to these measures of the environ-
ment of the restaurant, a structural variable,
physical size of the restaurant, was used as a
control measure in the analyses of SALES as
a dependent variable. DEMO each of the
restaurants in the chain was similar in size,
small differences could account for variance in
sales. Size was measured as DEMO square footage
of the restaurant.
RESULTS
A total of 371 employees completed the trust
survey. This comprised 61.8% of the total popu-

lation of the chain’s employees. The DEMO
Trust score for employees in the corporation was
3.27 on a ﬁve-point scale (s.d. = 0.71).
In order to conduct the analyses of the relation-
ship between Trust and SALES, PROFIT and
turnover (Hypotheses DEMO), it was necessary to
aggregate the measure of Trust to the restaurant
level. In order to support this aggregation we
conducted a one-way DEMO of variance on the
individual reports of Trust by restaurant. This
procedure allowed us to test whether the between-
group variance was greater than DEMO within-group
variance for the measure of Trust (Goodman,
Ravlin, and Schminke, 1987; Yammarino, 1990;
Yammarino and Markham, 1992). DEMO analysis of
variance yielded a signiﬁcant F-ratio (F = 4.139,
DEMO , 0.001) indicating that there was greater
agreement within restaurant than DEMO res-
taurants, and justifying the aggregation of this
variable to the DEMO level. The intraclass
correlation of 0.11 likewise suggested low associ-
ation between restaurants (Hays, 1988). These
results allowed restaurant performance to be
DEMO in relation to the aggregated measure
of GM trust. The average GM trust by restaurant
is presented in Table 1.
Is trust for the DEMO related to performance?
Two statistical approaches were taken to examin-
ing the relationship between GM trust and per-
formance. The ﬁrst consisted of DEMO of mean
differences between restaurants with high trust
and those with low trust. The second approach
utilized multiple regression analyses that included

control variables. Each approach DEMO advantages
and limitations as noted below.
Tests of hypotheses at restaurant level
For each of the hypothesis tests of the relationship
between GM trust DEMO restaurant performance,
the analyses were conducted at the restaurant
level. The aggregated measure of trust for the
GM was related to measures of DEMO and
PROFIT. Given the small sample size at this
level of aggregation (n = 9), we split the sample
at the median score for GM trust. This yielded
a subgroup of restaurants in which the DEMO was
trusted and a subgroup in which there was lower
trust. A natural break in restaurant trust scores
occurred at the median trust level, between the
fourth and ﬁfth restaurants rank ordered by trust
score (see Table 1). Therefore, the top four
(restaurant #’s 7, 5, 4 and 8) and the bottom ﬁve
(#’s 9, 1, 3, 6 and 2) restaurants were grouped
and designated high trust DEMO low trust groups
respectively. We then compared the measures of
ﬁnancial performance in the High Trust and Low
Trust restaurants using a directional (one-tailed)
t-statistic. Results of these hypothesis tests are
presented in Table 2.
DEMO ﬁrst hypothesis examined the relationship
between GM trust and restaurant sales. It was
hypothesized that restaurants with higher trust
would have signiﬁcantly higher sales DEMO those
with lower trust. The t-test comparing the average
of the high trust group with low trust group on
SALES was signiﬁcant (t = 3.46; p , 0.01). This
indicates that restaurants with higher trust had

higher SALES, which supports Hypothesis 1. A
similar analysis was used to test Hypothesis 2,
which compares the net profits of high trust
DEMO with low trust restaurants. The differ-
ence in PROFIT was statistically signiﬁcant in
the hypothesized direction (t = 2.76; p , 0.05).
DEMO with high GM trust had higher net
profits than those with low GM trust, supporting
Hypothesis 2.
The third hypothesis examined the effects of
GM trust on employee turnover. The difference
in turnover between restaurants with DEMO GM
trust and those with low GM trust was marginally
signiﬁcant (DEMO =−1.63; p , 0.10). This result pro-
vides some support DEMO Hypothesis 3, that more
trusted GMs will have lower turnover. It DEMO likely
that the effect of GM trust on turnover has a
longer time lag than that for ﬁnancial measures,
and we will explore DEMO possibility later in the pa-
per.
Regression analyses with control variables
A second approach to testing these hypotheses
utilized multiple regression analyses where each
DEMO the dependent variables was regressed on GM
trust, with the addition DEMO number of households
and median income as control variables (see
Table DEMO). For the regression model with SALES
as the dependent variable, DEMO size of the res-
taurant (measured in square feet) was entered as
an additional control variable. This allowed us to
control for the DEMO of the restaurant as well as
to directly examine the effect of size on sales.
Although these regression analyses provide the
advantage of a DEMO sophisticated analysis of the
effects of trust on the dependent variable, DEMO
must be interpreted with caution in that the ratio
of observations to variables violates most pre-
scriptions of what is appropriate. This violation
will DEMO to inﬂate the observed variance
accounted for by the models.
In the regression model testing Hypothesis 1,
GM trust was a signiﬁcant predictor DEMO SALES
(t = 2.83, p , 0.05) while controlling for DEMO
holds, median income and size. It is interesting
to note that DEMO size variable was also signiﬁcant
(t = 2.25, p , 0.05) indicating that size does play
a role in the total sales of the restaurant. In the
test of Hypothesis 2, GM trust was statistically
signiﬁcant in predicting PROFIT (t = 2.42,
p , 0.05). The control variables did not account

means tests, both hypotheses related to ﬁnancial
DEMO were supported. The regression
analysis examining turnover showed no signiﬁcant
relationship between GM trust and turnover. Thus
Hypothesis 3 was not supported by the DEMO
analysis. This is in contrast to the ﬁndings in the
means tests which showed a marginally signiﬁ-
cant relationship (p , 0.10) in DEMO directional test.
The weaker ﬁndings regarding turnover, and
our own observations DEMO the time frame related
to decisions by employees to voluntarily terminate
employment, suggested that we should examine
the relationship between GM trust and turnover
over a longer period than one quarter. We, there-
fore collected data over an additional quarter and
re-examined the relationship between GM trust
and DEMO In the same test of the mean differ-

was signiﬁcantly related DEMO employee turnover
(t =−2.29, p , 0.05). A similar analysis for the
measures of ﬁnancial performance, also yielded
signiﬁcant relationships for both SALES (t = 3.14,
p , 0.05) and PROFIT (t = 2.44, p , 0.05)
although the change in magnitude of the relation-
ship was not as great as that for turnover. These
DEMO suggest that the effects of GM trust on
ﬁnancial performance may be more immediate
and more robust than the effect on employee turn-
over.
DEMO data presented above indicate that res-
taurants with the higher levels of GM trust were
also those which attained the higher levels of
sales DEMO profitability, and lower levels of turn-
over. These results, taken together, present a con-
sistent pattern of support for the view that GM
trust is an important predictor of ﬁnancial per-
formance and employee turnover DEMO the res-
taurant industry.

Can managers change levels DEMO trust?
The preceding results provide evidence for a
relationship between the trust a GM garners from
his/her workforce and the restaurant’s perfor-
DEMO across a variety of measures. If the res-
taurants of more trusted GMs perform higher, it
is important to consider what the GM can do to
enhance his/her employees’ level of trust. In the
following DEMO, we examine whether employee
perceptions of GM ability, benevolence and integ-
rity are associated with trust. We hypothesize
that a GM can inﬂuence DEMO by inﬂuencing the
perceptions of these three factors.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis using LISREL 7
was performed to test whether the items measur-
ing factors DEMO trustworthiness can be differentiated
from one another. Results of that analysis are
presented in Table 4. Examination of the ﬁt indi-
ces reveals that DEMO three-factor model ﬁt the data
well. The comparative-ﬁt index (Bentler, 1990)
was 0.98 for the proposed model, which indicates
an acceptable ﬁt. The single-factor model, rep-
resenting that the items all reﬂect a global vari-
able, did not ﬁt the data nearly as well based on
any of the ﬁt measures (e.g., CFI = 0.84). A DEMO
Square difference test conﬁrmed that the proposed
three-factor model provided a signiﬁcantly better
ﬁt (p , 0.001) than the one-factor model.

ables DEMO a single, restaurant-level number

GM trustworthiness. Thus, the following tests are
conducted at DEMO individual level of analysis.
Table 5 presents means, standard deviations, cor-
relations for trust and the hypothesized ante-
cedents and reliability coefﬁcients. The DEMO
lation of GM trust with GM ability was 0.56
(p , DEMO), with GM benevolence was 0.60
(p , 0.001) and with GM integrity was 0.66
(p , 0.001). Each of these relationships is sta-
tistically signiﬁcant, thus supporting Hypotheses
4, 5 and 6. DEMO results suggest that general
managers can improve their employees’ trust by
improving their employees’ perceptions of their
ability, benevolence and integrity.
The data in Table 5 also indicate that the inter-
correlations among the antecedent variables DEMO
large and raise the question of the combined
predictive power of these variables. In order to
examine this question a multiple regression analy-
sis DEMO conducted with GM ability, GM benevo-
lence and GM integrity as DEMO of GM
trust (Table 6). The multiple regression analysis
indicates DEMO the three variables account for 46
percent of the variance in GM trust. The multiple
R is 0.68, which is statistically signiﬁcant
(F DEMO 103.95, p , 0.001). GM benevolence and
GM integrity are DEMO signiﬁcant as indi-
vidual predictors while GM ability is not. The
failure of GM ability to reach statistical signiﬁ-
cance is possibly due to DEMO high levels of multi-
colinearity discussed earlier.
It should be noted that the theory on which
this research is based conceptualizes trust, ability,
benevolence and integrity as perceptual variables,
and therefore requires that they DEMO measured
through self-reports (Mayer et al., 1995). While
efforts were made to ensure that relationships
among variables were attributable to sources other
DEMO common method variance, common source
bias may be a limitation of DEMO analysis and the
results should be interpreted cautiously.
STUDY 2
One remaining question that has not been clearly
answered is the direction of causality DEMO GM

have presumed that this is the logical theoretical
direction, the evidence in this study is far from
deﬁnitive. An argument could be made, for
example, that high organizational DEMO

Although the dependent variables in this study were
collected in the quarter following the measurement
of DEMO trust, the stability that is likely in both
variables makes it DEMO that prior performance
affected the level of trust in the next time period.
In fact, this feedback loop between performance
and trust is anticipated in the model of trust pro-
posed by Mayer et al. (1995).
In order to further investigate the causal direc-
tion between GM DEMO and performance as well
as to verify the relationships observed between
these variables we returned to the same organi-
zation three years later to DEMO to replicate the
ﬁndings with respect to GM trust and perform-
ance. For Study 2, data collection was limited
to the measurement of GM trust and the three
performance variables described earlier. This
allowed us to DEMO Hypotheses 1–3. The data
collection procedure and the instruments used
were the same as those described for Study 1. As
with the earlier study, the performance measures
SALES, PROFIT and turnover were collected at
the end of the following quarter.

RESULTS
A total of 381 employees completed the survey
in Study 2. DEMO represented 47.1% of the total
number of employees on the restaurant chain’s
payroll as of the time of data collection. As with
the ﬁrst DEMO, data collection occurred on site,
across all shifts. Over 90% DEMO the employees
workingonthe dayof data collection completed
the survey. The average GM trust score across the
9 restaurants was 3.22 on a ﬁve-point scale. DEMO
measure of GM trust was aggregated to the res-
taurant level in order to test the hypotheses regard-
ing restaurant performance. A one-way analysis
DEMO variance examining whether the between-group
variance was greater than the within-group vari-
ance (Goodman et al., 1987; Yammarino, 1990;
Yammarino and DEMO, 1992) supported this
aggregation (F = 3.79, p , 0.001). The average
GM trust score by restaurant, and the resulting
trust ranks are presented in Table 1.
Changes in high- and low-trust restaurants
DEMO interesting aspect of replicating the original
study in the same sample of restaurants is that it
allowed us to examine the changes that had
DEMO in the level of trust for the GM and the
extent to which membership in the high- and
low-trust groups changed over the three DEMO
Of particular interest was the fact that ﬁve of the
restaurants had changed GMs during this time,
while four of the restaurants had DEMO same GM.
Table 1 presents the GM trust scores for both
studies as well as the amount and direction of
change that was observed DEMO GM trust in each
restaurant. It is interesting to note that the largest
changes in GM trust occurred in the restaurants

that changed GMs. In DEMO, the three largest
changes in GM trust (and 4 of the 5 largest
changes) were in restaurants that changed GMs.
A comparison of the change scores between res-
taurants that changed and those that did DEMO
change GMs showed a statistically signiﬁcant
difference (t = 1.90, p , 0.05).
In the restaurants that changed GMs, the
changes in GM trust were not all in one direction.
In three restaurants GM DEMO increased, while in
the other two they decreased. This result is DEMO
sistent with our observation that GMs changed
for a variety of reasons, ranging from a promotion
to a corporate job, to being ﬁred DEMO the organi-
zation. The evidence that a change in the GM is
linked to the largest changes in trust suggests
that trust is based DEMO on the relationship with
the person who is the GM, and DEMO with the
performance of the restaurant.
Will the trust-performance relationship
replicate?
As with Study 1, the hypotheses were tested
by comparing the mean differences in SALES,
PROFIT and turnover between the high-trust and
low-trust DEMO Measures of performance
were not available for one of the restaurants (DEMO)
in the sample because the restaurant was closed
shortly after the data collection. The remaining
eight restaurants were divided evenly into high-
trust (#’s 1, 4, 5 and 8) and low-trust (#’s 2, 6,
7 and 9) groups based on the study 2 GM
trust data.
There are statistically signiﬁcant mean differ-
ences on SALES (t = 2.22, p , 0.05) and PRO-
FIT (t = 2.79, p , 0.05), supporting Hypotheses
1 and 2 (see Table DEMO). There is no signiﬁcant
mean difference in turnover, and Hypothesis DEMO is
not supported.
Regression analyses were also conducted fol-
lowing the strategy used for Study 1 including
the number of households and median income DEMO
control variables, with size as an additional con-
trol variable for DEMO These data are presented
in Table 7. In the analysis of SALES, GM trust
is a signiﬁcant predictor (t = 4.19, p , 0.05) with
none of the control variables accounting for sig-
niﬁcant variance. For PROFIT, GM trust is a
signiﬁcant predictor (t = 4.49, p , 0.05). In this
equation median income was marginally signiﬁ-
DEMO (t = 2.20, p , 0.10) but number of house-
DEMO  2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
holds was not signiﬁcant. DEMO Hypotheses 1 and
2 were supported in the regression analyses as
well. In the model for turnover, neither GM trust
nor any of the control variables accounted for
signiﬁcant variance in the dependent variable.
Hypothesis 3 DEMO not supported.
The results of the hypothesis tests in Study 2
are consistent with those of Study 1. GM trust
is a signiﬁcant predictor DEMO ﬁnancial performance
for both SALES and PROFIT in both studies.
The results for turnover were mixed. Although
there was evidence for the relationship in DEMO
1 this was not observed in Study 2.
DISCUSSION
This research represents one of the few attempts
to empirically examine the relationship between
trust DEMO a given GM and organizational perform-
ance and effectiveness. Does trust produce a com-
petitive advantage? If so, can it be sustained?
DEMO study found a signiﬁcant positive relation-
ship between trust and restaurant performance.
Thus, a GM who can garner higher trust from
the ﬁrm’s workforce gains a competitive advan-
tage over rival ﬁrms. If the results obtained DEMO
the current research can be replicated in other,
diverse settings, DEMO the question of sustainability
becomes pertinent.
If trust is a signiﬁcant determinant of ﬁrm
performance as suggested in this research, then
knowing the factors that lead to trust is critical.
As hypothesized, the relationships found between
trust for a GM and employee perceptions of the
GM’s ability, benevolence and integrity were
found to be signiﬁcant. This supports the assertion
that DEMO is affected by these three characteristics
(Mayer et al., 1995). These results suggest that
ability, benevolence and integrity provide a solid
foundation for understanding how to build trust.
These are speciﬁc, perceptual variables on which
a manager could focus attention and thereby
improve trust. A manager DEMO increase his/her
perceived trustworthiness via behaviors and tac-
tics which improve the workforce’s perceptions
of the three trustworthiness factors. Likewise, if
a ﬁrm chooses to build a strategic advantage
based upon trust, this theoretical foundation
appears to merit consideration as a heuristic for
modeling management training programs DEMO
trust-building.

While the DEMO of this study support the
hypothesized relationship between trust and per-
formance in the restaurant industry, further analy-
sis is necessary to examine its generalizability to
other contexts. The measures of performance (net
profits, sales DEMO turnover) were selected because
of their importance to this industry. Other DEMO
formance measures, particularly market measures,
must be examined to determine DEMO the
hypothesized relationships hold. Likewise, the
factors which have been shown DEMO promote
employee trust for general managers in the res-
taurant context must be examined further.
Finally, a note of caution with respect to the
interpretation of ﬁndings is appropriate. The theo-
retical model of trust proposed DEMO this paper
suggests that GM trust is a causal antecedent of
organizational performance. However, it is
important to note that although the results
reported in this paper provide clear evidence of
a relationship between trust and DEMO, the
Copyright  2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
data cannot provide conclusive evidence of the
proposed causal direction. Although the analysis
of DEMO changes between Study 1 and Study 2
does suggest that trust is more closely related to
the relationship with the GM than to previous
DEMO of restaurant performance, and supports the
view that trust is antecedent DEMO performance, this
evidence is not sufﬁcient to rule out alternate
explanations. DEMO, future research that replicates
these ﬁndings and is able to use DEMO research
and analytic strategies such as time-series and
structural modeling is necessary to fully resolve
the issue of causal direction.
