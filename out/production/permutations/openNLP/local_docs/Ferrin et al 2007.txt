Drawing on the diverse literatures of game DEMO, negotiation, interper-
sonal trust, and interorganizational relationships, the authors develop a
theoretical model of the relationships among trust, monitoring, and coop-
DEMO in interpersonal and intergroup interactions. They use the concept of
isomorphism as a basis for developing this theory, observing that although
the constructs may differ in structure across levels, they may still have sim-
ilar functions. They also argue that a more explicit distinction between own
and other’s DEMO, own and other’s monitoring, and own and other’s cooperation
is critical for better understanding the relationships among trust, monitoring,
and cooperation. By making this distinction between own and other and by
drawing on four DEMO literatures, the authors provide greater precision in
how trust, monitoring, DEMO cooperation are defined, and they provide a more
comprehensive and variegated DEMO of the relationships among the constructs
through the development of specific research propositions. They conclude with
potential contributions of the model for future research DEMO practice.

Rgroup cooperative behavior, in the ability of constructs such as trust andesearchers have had a long-standing interest in interpersonal DEMO inter-
monitoring to influence cooperative behavior, and in other relationships that
DEMO exist among these three constructs. Cooperation is crucial for the sur-
vival of organizations (Barnard, 1938), and trust and monitoring are fre-
DEMO recognized as important precursors of cooperation. Trust has been
cited as the variable that has perhaps the strongest influence on interpersonal
and group behavior (e.g., Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975). And moni-
toring is a DEMO managerial activity for procuring cooperative behavior (e.g.,
Mintzberg, 1973). Indeed, the three constructs are of central importance in
many interpersonal and intergroup work activities, including leader-subordinate
relationships, management-worker relations, and the interpersonal and inter-
group negotiations that facilitate internal resource allocations, coordination
of production activities, and numerous other activities. Given their impor-
tance, it is DEMO surprising that the three constructs feature prominently in
literatures such as game theory, negotiation, interpersonal trust, and interor-
ganizational relationships.
Although it might be reasonable to assume that the relationships among
the three constructs are DEMO straightforward, a more penetrating analysis
reveals that a surprisingly large number DEMO propositions can be developed to
describe the relationships among the variables, DEMO some of these seem to be
inconsistent with one another. For example, researchers have frequently pro-
posed that trust and monitoring lead to increased cooperation (e.g., see Dirks
& Ferrin, 2001; McAllister, 1995; DEMO, 1998). Yet researchers have also
noted that: (a) trust may be a consequence rather than a determinant of coop-
eration (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Ross & LaCroix, 1996); (b) monitoring may
reduce cooperation (Kramer, 1999); (c) trust and monitoring DEMO be alterna-
tive determinants of cooperation (McAllister, 1995), which suggests that they
may interact as determinants of cooperation; (d) trust may create the very
conditions under which malfeasance (i.e., reduced cooperation) becomes
possible (Granovetter, 1985); and (e) monitoring reduces trust (Strickland,
1958), which (f) may then reduce cooperation (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996).
These inconsistencies reveal a lack of understanding about several aspects of
the posited relationships: What is the nature of the relationships (e.g., direct
or moderated)? What is the valence (i.e., DEMO or negative)? And what is
the direction of causality?
Yet there is another critical cause of this lack of understanding that has
DEMO any systematic attention: Research has not adequately distin-
guished between one’s DEMO and the other’s trust, monitoring, and coopera-
tion. To provide an abstract example, party A may cooperate with party B

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 467
because: (DEMO) A trusts B (A has confidence that B has integrity and hence will
behave cooperatively), (b) B trusts A (A wishes to honor B’s trust by coop-
erating rather than competing), (c) A is monitoring B (therefore, A knows
that B is behaving cooperatively), (d) B is monitoring A (therefore, A has
DEMO opportunity to benefit from competing), (e) A cooperated in the past
(and A’s behavior has become habituated), and (f) B cooperated in the past
(and A is now reciprocating B’s behavior). In this example, A’s cooperation
can be predicted by own and other’s trust, own and other’s monitoring, and
own and other’s past cooperation.
DEMO distinction between own and other provides an opportunity to develop
a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the relationships among
the variables and a more DEMO specification of interdependencies that exist
in dyadic relationships. Yet it also adds complexity. First, it effectively dou-
bles the number of variables from 3 to 6, which greatly increases the number
of ways the variables may influence each other. Second, because own trust is
usually correlated with other’s trust within a dyad (and similarly, own and
other’s cooperation, and own and other’s monitoring, are also correlated
within dyad), the explicit recognition of interdependency implies empirical
designs that include nonindependent observations and therefore DEMO violate
regression and ANOVA assumptions (Kashy & Kenny, 2000). Thus, it will be
important not only to formulate propositions that directly address issues of
“own versus other” but also to consider how future empirical DEMO can be
designed to operationalize and test such propositions without violating the
relevant analytical assumptions.
Our objective of providing a fuller understanding of the DEMO
among trust, monitoring, and cooperation in interpersonal and intergroup
relationships presents both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity
should be obvious: As will be noted below, studies of the relationships among
trust, monitoring, and cooperation have been conducted in at least four litera-
tures: game theory, negotiation, interpersonal work relationships, and interor-
ganizational relationships. However, DEMO in each literature have for the
most part been conducted in isolation from studies in the other literatures.
Consequently, there are considerable opportunities for cross-fertilization
across areas. But we also recognize and will address one significant DEMO
in this undertaking: We must establish whether the definitions and research
DEMO of the constructs are sufficiently similar across the four literatures to
justify cross-literature and cross-level theory development. For instance,
interpersonal-level theories of trust, monitoring, and cooperation are some-
times used to hypothesize intergroup effects, DEMO adequate consideration
of the ability of the theories to generalize across levels. We therefore explicitly

recognize and address another important challenge in DEMO undertaking,
namely, that we must consider whether the constructs have DEMO causal
effects at different levels even if they have nonidentical structures (DEMO,
Tosi, & Cannella, 1999).
In sum, we will DEMO a detailed theoretical model that distinguishes
between own and other’s trust, DEMO, and cooperation and attempts
to capture not only the nature of DEMO relationships among the constructs
(e.g., main vs. moderated effects) but DEMO their valence (positive vs. neg-
ative effects), their potentially recursive DEMO, and their applicability at
multiple levels (interpersonal vs. intergroup). We hope that the model will
provide insight into the relationships among the DEMO of interest and
also stimulate future research. Accordingly, we will conclude DEMO an
agenda for future research to be conducted to validate and extend the
model.
Theoretical Foundations
We will begin by considering how the constructs DEMO been researched in
four literatures—game theory, negotiation, interpersonal work relationships,
and interorganizational relationships—and the extent to which the constructs
have similar definitions DEMO research contexts across these literatures. Next,
we will highlight several research issues and unanswered questions across
these literatures. We will then set out DEMO approach for theory development,
followed by formal development of testable research propositions.
Key Concepts
Cooperation and the mixed-motive context of interpersonal and inter-
DEMO relationships. In interpersonal and intergroup relationships, parties
often have motives to DEMO cooperate and compete with each other, to max-
imize the collective DEMO yet also maximize their self-interest at the
expense of the collective interest. Individuals and groups therefore experi-
ence benefits as well as risks from DEMO with one another. This is
the essence of the mixed-motive social dilemma (e.g., Dawes, 1980).
Accordingly, the interdependence that exists in DEMO settings is a boundary
condition of our analysis.
Game theory researchers are interested in understanding factors that influ-
ence cooperation in social dilemmas. This DEMO frequently been operationalized

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 469
in the DEMO dilemma game, in which players’ moves are considered coop-
erative or DEMO to the extent they advance collective rather than selfish
interests (e.g., Deutsch, 1958). Similarly, negotiation is often defined as a
form DEMO joint decision making in which two or more parties resolve their
nonidentical interests (e.g., Neale & Northcraft, 1991). In mixed-motive
negotiation research, negotiators have simultaneous interests to compete and
cooperate, and researchers often DEMO whether negotiators use cooperative
versus competitive behaviors (e.g., sharing information truthfully vs. lying)
and the extent to which a cooperative outcome is DEMO (i.e., the extent to
which the decision satisfies the collective interests of the negotiators).
Scholars in the interpersonal trust literature often hypothesize DEMO in
contexts such as interpersonal work relationships and negotiations, trust
will DEMO to numerous cooperative behaviors and outcomes such as job per-
formance, DEMO citizenship behaviors, and cooperative agree-
ments (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001, 2002). Such behaviors can be considered
cooperative because they advance collective DEMO (those of the organi-
zation as a whole, subgroups within the organization, or work colleagues)
rather than the selfish interests of the individual. Finally, the interorganiza-
tional relationships literature examines relationships between or among
firms such as joint venture or strategic alliance partners. In this literature,DEMO
the level of the parties’ cooperation, defined as the extent to DEMO a party
will pursue mutually compatible interests rather than acting opportunisti-
cally, is a crucial dependent variable (e.g., Parkhe, 1993).
Trust. DEMO is often defined as a belief or confidence that one party has
about another party’s characteristics that may increase willingness to take
risks and DEMO help “solve” the social dilemma. Interorganizational trust
differs from interpersonal trust in terms of the referent (a group of individuals
composing the referent organization) and the origin (a group of individuals
who may share an DEMO toward the referent organization; Zaheer,
McEvily, & Perrone, 1998)DEMO Scholars in the negotiation (Ross & LaCroix,
1996), interpersonal DEMO (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), and interor-
ganizational relationships (Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997) liter-
atures have observed that trust (sometimes referred to as perceived
trustworthiness) can be defined as DEMO belief or confidence about another party’s
integrity (including reliability, predictability, DEMO dependability) and/or benev-
olence (including goodwill, motives, intentions, DEMO caring). Representative
definitions in these three literatures that utilize one or more of these dimen-
sions are provided by Dirks (2000), McAllister (1995), Kimmel, Pruitt,

Magenau, Konar-Goldband, and Carnevale (1980), Schurr and Ozanne
(1985), Ring and Van de Ven (1992), and Zaheer et al. (1998), among others.
Game theory researchers DEMO used conceptual definitions of trust that are less
specific but still consistent with those above (e.g., “trusting and friendly atti-
tudes”; Deutsch, DEMO).
In defining trust as “an individual’s or group’s belief that another indi-
vidual or group makes efforts to uphold commitments, is honest, DEMO does
not take advantage given the opportunity,” Cummings and Bromiley (DEMO,
p. 303) explicitly allowed that trust can be an interpersonal DEMO intergroup
belief. Their definition is also consistent with the integrity and benevolence
dimensions cited above. Therefore, we will adopt this as our conceptual
definition of trust.
Monitoring. In this article, we focus specifically on monitoring, DEMO form of
control that has been frequently examined across the four literatures.
Monitoring is defined as behaviors conducted by one party to gain informa-
DEMO about another party’s level of cooperation. Monitoring is considered a
critical element of formal control because it provides parties the possibility of
determining whether DEMO have been deviations from agreed-on rules
(Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005). Across the four research streams, such
information is considered important for a variety of reasons. In particular, it
provides information about a partner’s behavior that can foster cooperation,
and it allows one to protect one’s DEMO by detecting competitive behavior.
Game theory researchers argue that the ability to monitor a partner’s behav-
ior is an important determinant of cooperation (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981),
and researchers have examined the effects of DEMO information about a
partner’s past behavior and parties’ delays in reacting to such information as
determinants of cooperation (e.g., Kollock, 1993). Negotiators frequently
engage in reciprocity, that is, they use their knowledge of DEMO partner’s past
behavior to determine their own behavior (e.g., Lewicki, DEMO, & Barry,
2006, p. 223), which suggests that information obtained through monitoring
is an important determinant of cooperation. The interpersonal trust DEMO
has defined control-based monitoring as behavior that reduces the uncertainty
inherent in a situation (McAllister, 1995). Finally, in interorganizational rela-
tionships it has been recognized that monitoring is used to gain information
about another DEMO level of cooperation and also to control the other party’s
level of cooperation (Nooteboom et al., 1997; Parkhe, 1993).
In sum, it appears that, at least at a conceptual level, there is DEMO
consistency in how trust, monitoring, and cooperation have been defined
across the four literatures. Of course, we do not contend that these are the only

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 471
definitions of DEMO, monitoring, and cooperation that exist. In fact, there is a
DEMO of consistency in how the three constructs are defined within each of the
literatures. For example, in each of the four literatures, trust DEMO sometimes
been conceptualized or operationalized as a behavior; in the interpersonal
DEMO literature, trust is sometimes defined as an intention; and in three of the
four literatures (all except interorganizational relationships), trust is also
examined as a personality variable. Similar variations exist for definitions of
cooperation DEMO monitoring. Scholars in each of the literatures have recog-
nized these inconsistencies, and the inconsistencies remain an important focus
of research. Resolving these inconsistencies is far beyond the scope of this
article. Instead, we simply contend that the three constructs, as defined in this
article, are a DEMO of research in all four literatures. This enables us to draw
insights from various research streams, compare and contrast those insights,
and develop conclusions that may contribute to multiple areas of research.
Research Issues and DEMO Questions
Across the Four Literatures
Early game theory researchers (e.g., Deutsch, 1958) argued that trust was
an important determinant of cooperation. However, rather than defining trust
as a perceptual variable distinct from cooperation, this research operational-
ized trust as cooperation and then interpreted the emergence of DEMO
behavior as a manifestation of trust (Bigley & Pearce, 1998; DEMO & Knox,
1970). Although researchers have observed that information about a partner’s
behavior influences cooperation levels (e.g., Kollock, 1993), game theory
studies typically treat information about past behavior as a constant or DEMO
experimental manipulation. One logical next step in this literature will be to
conceptualize and operationalize trust as a perceptual variable so that the rela-
DEMO between trust and cooperation can be better assessed theoretically
and empirically. A second worthwhile step will be to consider monitoring as
a potentially voluntary DEMO so that researchers can examine the effects
of monitoring on cooperation and examine how monitoring might vary in
response to factors such as trust DEMO cooperation.
Different theorists have adopted different positions and perspectives on
the role of trust in negotiation: Although trust is often considered a precondi-
tion or determinant of cooperation, it is sometimes considered a consequence,
and sometimes it is actually equated with joint gain (Ross & LaCroix, DEMO),
suggesting that research is needed to better understand the relationship
DEMO the two variables. Regarding the last point, Ross and LaCroix (1996)
specifically note that research is needed to understand how well measures DEMO

472 Group & Organization Management
“trust-as-cooperation” correspond to perceptual measures of trust. DEMO in game
theory research, negotiation studies typically do not vary negotiators’ DEMO to
obtain such information through monitoring. Finally, research on the rela-
DEMO between trust and cooperation in intergroup negotiations is nearly
nonexistent (see DEMO, 1996, for a notable exception).
Within the interpersonal trust literature, there is equivocal evidence for
the proposition that interpersonal trust produces cooperative behaviors and
outcomes such as citizenship behaviors, performance, information sharing,
DEMO cooperative negotiation behaviors and outcomes (Dirks & Ferrin,
2001). DEMO also note that trust may be a consequence of coopera-
tion rather than an antecedent, yet it is difficult to draw firm conclusions
about the direction of causality because most studies use cross-sectional
field data (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). And as will be discussed below, monitor-
DEMO is considered a potentially important variable in this literature, yet there
DEMO disagreement about whether it increases or decreases cooperation, and
there is DEMO about how it may interact with trust.
In interorganizational relationships, trust DEMO monitoring are potentially
important determinants of cooperation (e.g., Nooteboom et al., 1997; Parkhe,
1993), yet the interrelationships among trust, monitoring, and cooperation
are not yet established. Parkhe (1993) recognized that trust may be an out-
come as well as a determinant of cooperation DEMO called for more research to
examine the direction of causality. As in the interpersonal trust literature, there
are unresolved arguments about how trust and monitoring might combine to
influence cooperation (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005; Das & Teng,
1998). There are also unresolved levels issues: Researchers sometimes use
interpersonal-level theories, and tests of those theories often operationalize
trust as an individual informant’s report rather than a group-level construct.
Finally, we have thus far treated the four research areas as distinct. It is
DEMO to note that the literatures have substantial overlap. For instance,
game theory provides a theoretical foundation for the other three areas; reviews
of game theory are found within the negotiation (Bazerman, Curhan, Moore, &
Valley, 2000), interpersonal trust (Bigley & Pearce, 1998) DEMO IOR (Parkhe,
1993) literatures. Negotiation researchers often draw on the interpersonal trust
literature (Ross & LaCroix, 1996), and interpersonal and DEMO trust are
sometimes studied in the negotiation context (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001; Polzer,
1996). And researchers recognize that developmental processes of interorgani-
zational relationships include negotiation, assessments of the other party’s level
of cooperation, and the development of interpersonal and intergroup trust (Ring
& DEMO de Ven, 1992). It is also notable that, at an abstract level, the research
contexts are very similar across the four areas: They comprise dyadic (inter-
personal or intergroup) relationships in which parties are simultaneously

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 473
motivated to DEMO and compete in a situation of uncertainty and risk. In
this situation, the parties often have an opportunity to monitor each other’s
behavior, DEMO and past behavior provide a basis for forming and updat-
ing one’s trust in the other, and one’s trust in the other may influence future
monitoring and cooperation within the relationship.
In sum, the literatures focus on common phenomena—trust, monitoring,
and cooperation—in research contexts that are highly similar. Yet each lit-
erature has its own preferred analytical approach (i.e., the laboratory exper-
iment in game theory and negotiation; the cross-sectional DEMO study in
interpersonal trust and interorganizational relationships), favored level of
analysis, and unresolved questions. What is needed is a more comprehen-
sive theoretical model that can integrate findings from the different research
areas to provide DEMO more holistic view of the relationships among trust, mon-
itoring, and cooperation.
The Structure and Functions of Trust, Monitoring,
and Cooperation in Interpersonal and
Intergroup Relationships
The above discussion suggests that trust, monitoring, DEMO cooperation
may have similar causal effects at the interpersonal and intergroup levels
despite the fact that the three constructs represent collective phenomena at
the DEMO level versus individual phenomena at the interpersonal level.
This suggests that the constructs may be isomorphic; that is, they may have
different structures, yet similar functions (causal outputs), across levels
(Klein et al., 1999). This distinction between the structure and function of a
construct DEMO a useful tool for developing theory at multiple levels. The
structure of a collective construct differs from an individual construct in that
a collective DEMO can be understood as a series of events and interactions
among constituent elements (e.g., individuals) that enable collective phe-
nomena (e.g., group trust) to emerge. Importantly, constructs do not need to
have identical DEMO to have similar functions (Morgeson & Hofmann,
1999). According DEMO Morgeson and Hofmann (1999), there are several
advantages to focusing DEMO functions rather than structure in the early stages
of multilevel theory development: The approach enables one to better under-
stand the nature of complex collective phenomena but in a language that is
readily understandable; an understanding of a construct’s function can pro-
vide insight into the construct’s structure; and, importantly for our analysis,
an understanding of function may allow one to integrate across levels of
analysis.

474 Group & Organization Management
Accordingly, in our theory development, we DEMO focus on the functions
of the constructs rather than their structure. As we develop the propositions
below, the similarity in functions across levels will often be self-evident
because the logic supporting the proposition can readily apply DEMO both the
interpersonal and intergroup levels and/or because the proposition has been
previously posited at both levels. Therefore, we will consider functional
similarity on an exception basis: In our proposition development, we will
specifically DEMO those propositions for which logic or past research
suggests a lack of functional similarity across levels.
In the interest of tractability, in our theorizing, we assume that the par-
ties to the relationship are relatively equivalent in power, status, and
resources. Obviously, this will not always be the case. Therefore, in the dis-
cussion section, we will consider DEMO differences in power and resources
might affect our predictions. In the following sections, we first consider the
determinants of cooperation, then the determinants DEMO trust, and finally
the determinants of monitoring. These three sets of DEMO are
summarized in Figure 1.
Determinants of Cooperation
Trust. In mixed-motive situations, cooperation is inherently risky because
one’s partner has the motivation, and DEMO the opportunity, to exploit the
cooperative behavior. Trust is argued to DEMO cooperation because a
party who believes the partner is trustworthy will develop a higher willing-
ness to risk, and therefore in conditions of risk, the party is more likely to
engage in risk-taking behavior (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). One common
rationale for this effect is that trust increases one’s confidence that the other
will act cooperatively rather DEMO opportunistically, which then increases
one’s own willingness to cooperate (Das & Teng, 1998, 2001).
There is substantial support for this idea. DEMO noted above, early game
theory researchers hypothesized but did not actually DEMO the effect of
trust on cooperation because trust was assumed to be a manifestation of coop-
eration. Negotiation researchers have found that trust leads DEMO more coopera-
tive negotiation behaviors and more integrative negotiation outcomes in
interpersonal and intergroup negotiations (Lewicki et al., 2006; Ross &
LaCroix, 1996; Taylor, 1989). Dirks and Ferrin (2001) present evidence DEMO
cooperative behavioral outcomes such as organizational citizenship behaviors
are positively related to interpersonal trust, although they note that the effects
are relatively mixed and weak. And Parkhe (1993) argues that as trust grows,
alliance DEMO are increasingly willing to put themselves at risk, for

example through intimate disclosure, reliance on the counterpart’s promises,
or sacrificing present rewards for future gains.
Proposition 1a: Own trust increases own cooperation.
A party’s cooperative behavior may also be DEMO by the partner’s
trust. We argue that this is likely to be so for two reasons, one normative and
one instrumental. First, trust DEMO a normative element: Parties recognize,
internalize, and feel bound by values of fairness, cooperation, and reciproc-
ity, which may induce each other into cooperation (e.g., Koeszegi, 2004;
Madhok, 1995; Parkhe, 1998). Thus, a party who has earned another’s trust
will DEMO bound to honor that trust and therefore behave cooperatively rather
than competitively toward the other. Second is an instrumental reason:
Greater sanctions are DEMO reserved for individuals or groups who, in
behaving competitively, violate another’s trust; therefore, concern about such
sanctions may further encourage cooperation in DEMO to another’s trust.
Specifically, in a relationship in which trust has DEMO been built, competi-
tive behavior would be viewed as unexpected, it would be considered a vio-
lation of the positive expectations that are DEMO essence of trust, and therefore
it would call for retribution or DEMO In contrast, if trust is not already pre-
sent in the DEMO, competitive behavior is less likely to be considered
unusual or a DEMO of trust. Recognizing this, a party who is contemplat-
ing whether DEMO behave in an exploitative or competitive manner should rec-
ognize that the sanctions will be greater in the presence of other’s trust than
in DEMO absence of other’s trust.
Proposition 1b: Other’s trust increases own cooperation.
DEMO some scholars have offered a dissenting view. They have noted that
the additional opportunities for joint gain that are created by trust may also
DEMO incentives for one partner to capture a larger proportion of that gain
(Zaheer et al., 1998). Also, the very presence of trust establishes the condi-
tions for its abuse (Granovetter, 1985; McEvily, DEMO, & Zaheer, 2003).
For example, a trusted partner may DEMO inclined to compete not only because
of the increased incentives but also because of a belief that the malfeasance
will go undetected because of DEMO trust. In essence, what we are arguing is
that other’s trust DEMO have a positive (Proposition 1b) and negative
(Proposition 1c) effect on own cooperation. As will be noted in the discus-
sion section, for certain paths in our theoretical model, valid arguments can
be developed for positive and negative effects, and the extant research is not

sufficiently conclusive DEMO determine the precise nature of the effect. In all
likelihood, this DEMO that contingencies exist that cause the effect to be
positive in some situations and negative in others. Accordingly, in our
research agenda, we DEMO emphasize the importance of research that seeks
to uncover such moderators and test their effects.
Proposition 1c: Other’s trust decreases own cooperation.
Monitoring. Although monitoring is frequently cited as a determinant of
cooperation, researchers have not always recognized that it can serve at
least two roles. First, it can provide information about the other party’s
behavior, which is critical in a social dilemma because cooperation, by def-
inition, requires that parties DEMO their behavior. Early game theory
researchers realized that, lacking evidence that DEMO counterpart will coop-
erate, the most rational individual strategy is to DEMO, which suggests
that monitoring may be an important determinant of cooperation. DEMO mon-
itoring activities, such as prearranged progress reports and milestone dates
(Powell, 1996), increase the speed and reliability with which alliance part-
ners learn about each other’s actions and ultimately are able to reciprocate
DEMO other’s cooperative behavior (Parkhe, 1993).
Of course, whether own DEMO has a positive or negative effect on
own cooperation depends in large part on the findings of monitoring. If
through monitoring one finds that DEMO other is behaving competitively, one
may “fight fire with fire” and DEMO in response, or one may even with-
draw from the relationship. DEMO, there are several reasons to expect
that monitoring is more likely DEMO uncover cooperative behaviors than com-
petitive behaviors. First, research indicates that DEMO tend to demonstrate
unusually high levels of cooperation in early stages of relationships (Kelley
& Stahelski, 1970). If monitoring is present early DEMO to detect such cooper-
ation, then there is a strong likelihood DEMO the cooperation will be recipro-
cated (own monitoring will increase own DEMO). Second, the
expectation of monitoring can itself can lead to DEMO cooperation
(Proposition 2b below). As we discuss later in the DEMO, so long as that
monitoring is considered appropriate, it is likely to encourage cooperation.
And third, it is unlikely that successive monitoring will continue to uncover
successive competition over time. Essentially, a discovery of competitive
behavior in an interdependent relationship will usually cause one to either
renegotiate DEMO to gain assurance that the other will behave more
cooperatively in the future (in which case future monitoring should uncover
future cooperation) or DEMO from the relationship entirely.

Proposition 2a: Own monitoring increases own cooperation.
Monitoring’s second role is that it may influence another’s behavior, that
is, act as a control mechanism. In a social dilemma, the greatest DEMO from
competition occur when, over an extended period, one party is able to com-
pete while the other cooperates. This is most likely DEMO occur in the absence
of monitoring because monitoring would allow the cooperating party to rec-
ognize and sanction the competitive behavior. Thus, as one’s monitoring
increases, the partner’s returns to competitive behavior should decrease, caus-
DEMO the partner to become more cooperative. It has been noted that if strate-
gic alliance partners have frequent opportunities to monitor one another, they
are likely to perceive that the returns on exploitation will be reduced DEMO
exploitation is likely to be discovered at an earlier stage (Nooteboom DEMO al.,
1997; Parkhe, 1993). Monitoring is also used to address interpersonal-level
social dilemmas. For example, in the workplace managers perform a variety
of monitoring behaviors, such as standing over their employees, checking DEMO
on them, and observing them, to ensure that they are working toward the
company’s objectives rather than their own selfish objectives (Perlow, DEMO).
Proposition 2b: Other’s monitoring increases own cooperation.
However, monitoring may also decrease cooperation. Parties may be moti-
vated to cooperate with one DEMO because of intrinsic factors (e.g., not vio-
lating another’s expectations) DEMO well as extrinsic factors (e.g., individual
gain). When individuals think their behavior is under the control of extrinsic
factors such as monitoring, their intrinsic motivation to perform the behaviors
the monitoring was intended to DEMO may actually be undermined (Kramer,
1999). In essence, the intrinsic reward from behaving in a positive way derives
in part or DEMO from knowing that one has chosen to behave in that way, DEMO
because the behavior is voluntary, it represents a positive manifestation of
DEMO nature and identity. If, on the other hand, one views the cooperative
behavior as motivated by some external control mechanism, the behavior can-
not be viewed as very indicative of one’s nature and identity, and therefore the
internal motivation to perform the behavior is impaired. And because DEMO
control mechanisms such as monitoring are nearly always imperfect for
procuring cooperative behaviours (one’s boss cannot monitor 100% of one’s
behaviors), the impairment of internal motivation is likely to result in a net
decrease in DEMO behaviors.
Proposition 2c: Other’s monitoring decreases own cooperation.

Interaction of DEMO and monitoring. Several authors have noted that par-
ties may rely on trust, monitoring, or some combination of the two to procure
cooperation. DEMO discussion thus far suggests that trust and monitoring jointly
and independently contribute to cooperation (Das & Teng, 1998). Ouchi
(1979) offered DEMO potentially different view with his observation that “people
must either be able to trust each other or to closely monitor each other if they
DEMO to engage in cooperative enterprises” (p. 846). This suggests that DEMO and
monitoring may interact: As trust increases, monitoring is obviated; DEMO mon-
itoring increases, trust is obviated. At the interpersonal level, it can be argued
that people must be able to either trust or DEMO each other if they are to
engage in cooperative enterprises (McAllister, 1995). Consistent with this
argument, Bromiley and Cummings (1995) argued, “You should spend less
to monitor highly trustworthy individuals than less trustworthy individuals”
(p. 230). Similarly, Parkhe (1998) observed that trust DEMO a less significant
role, and less trust is required, in situations in which a company possesses rel-
atively complete, accurate, and timely DEMO about a partner firm. And
Bijlsma-Frankema and Koopman (2004) recognized that many of today’s
organizations must choose between traditional command-and-control
approaches and more DEMO forms of control such as trust-based gov-
ernance. Thus, trust and DEMO may function as substitutes or alterna-
tives for each other. Specifically, DEMO higher levels of trust, monitoring is
unlikely to have much effect DEMO cooperation. But for lower levels of trust,
monitoring is likely to have a stronger effect on cooperation.
Proposition 3: Other’s trust and other’s monitoring interact as determinants of own
cooperation. As other’s trust increases, other’s monitoring will have a weaker
effect on own cooperation; as other’s trust decreases, other’s monitoring will
have a stronger effect on own cooperation.
Cooperation. Researchers often recognize that cooperative behavior is
self-perpetuating, principally because of the tendency of parties to recipro-
cate their partner’s behavior. Perhaps the most DEMO finding in game
theory research is that cooperative behaviors, when reciprocated, tend to
spiral into ever higher levels of cooperation (e.g., Axelrod, 1984; for
selected reviews of the game theory literature, see Dawes, 1980; Komorita
& Parks, 1995; Messick & Brewer, 1983; Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). Game
theory researchers have found that if cooperative behavior can be estab-
lished early, parties tend to lock into this behavior (Pilisuk & Skolnick,
1968). The dynamics of reciprocation are also recognized in several theories,
such as social exchange (Blau, DEMO) and social influence (Cialdini, 2001),

480 Group & Organization Management
which, along with game theory, have DEMO used to explain why people in
interpersonal work relationships and negotiations are inclined to recipro-
cate each other’s cooperative behaviors. In addition, the process of devel-
oping cooperation in strategic alliances has been described as iterative:DEMO
“The level of cooperation increases with each agreement between the same
partners” (Powell, 1996, p. 60).
Proposition 4: Other’s cooperation increases DEMO cooperation.
Determinants of Trust
Monitoring. A party’s efforts to monitor a partner’s behavior may
adversely affect the party’s feelings concerning their relationship (Ghoshal
& Moran, 1996). Consequently, by undertaking behaviors to monitor a
partner, a party might actually reduce its level of trust in the partner. DEMO the-
oretical basis for this prediction is provided by self-perception theory
(DEMO, 1972), which posits that individuals use their own past behavior DEMO a
source of information for understanding their own attitudes and beliefs.
Strickland (1958) reported that participants developed lower levels of trust
in subordinates DEMO they were experimentally directed to monitor more.
And venture capitalists’ trust in entrepreneurs has been found to be nega-
tively correlated with frequency of DEMO in lab and field settings
(Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996).
Note that self-perception theory is an inherently intrapersonal phenom-
enon; therefore, the DEMO argumentation might be considered likely to
apply only between individuals (i.e., at the interpersonal level). However,
our earlier observation that less DEMO is required when one has adequate
information about a partner (Parkhe, 1998) suggests that groups as well as
individuals, who have the DEMO to monitor their partner, may have a lower
motivation to develop DEMO in their partner. Put simply, if a party is primar-
ily DEMO about being exploited and the party has the ability to monitor
the partner’s behavior to a substantial degree, then the party can be assured
that if any exploitation occurs or is about to occur, it can be responded to
extremely rapidly. For instance, the party can threaten to retaliate or the
party can withdraw from the relationship before harm can DEMO done. By reduc-
ing this downside risk, trust becomes relatively irrelevant, and therefore the
party may devote little time or effort into even DEMO trustworthiness. For
instance, the party may not take the time or DEMO to carefully consider the
trustworthiness of the partner, either by reviewing DEMO partner’s past behav-
iors performed toward the party itself or by reviewing the partner’s past

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 481
behaviors toward DEMO others. Without devoting this time to consider trust-
worthiness, the party DEMO unlikely to build a high level of trust in the partner.
Proposition 5a: Own monitoring reduces own trust.
Yet monitoring may also signal low trust and thereby breed mistrust
(Cialdini, 1996). A party may DEMO a partner’s monitoring behavior as an
indicator of low trust. If one were subjected to heavy monitoring from a part-
ner, it would be reasonable to infer that the partner is highly concerned about
being exploited. DEMO suggests that the partner has few positive expectations
about the party’s behavior, which can easily be equated to a belief that the
partner has little trust in the party (Das & Teng, 1998; Zand, DEMO). Because
parties are naturally motivated to reciprocate trust (Proposition 8), the mon-
itored party may then develop lower trust in the partner. Furthermore, for-
malized management control systems (which would include but not DEMO
limited to monitoring) appear to damage trust because they undermine the
DEMO of value congruence, convey disrespect, and threaten the monitored
party’s sense of professional autonomy and competence (Sitkin & Stickel,
1996). Consistent with these arguments, employees have been found to trust
superiors less when they perceive that the superiors’ monitoring is intended
to control their behavior (Etchegaray & Jones, 2001).
Proposition 5b: Other’s monitoring reduces own DEMO
Yet a strikingly different conclusion about the effect of other’s monitoring
on own trust can be found in the work of Bijlsma-Frankema and van DEMO Bunt
(2003). In a qualitative and quantitative study of manager-subordinate DEMO
tionships in a hospital setting, they hypothesized and found that the DEMO
of managers’ monitoring was positively related to subordinates’ trust in the
managers. In this research setting, subordinates viewed their managers’ mon-
itoring as a demonstration of care, which enabled the managers to provide
feedback on performance, appreciate good work, and provide support and
guidance. In contrast, managers who monitored infrequently were assumed
to be aloof and uninterested in their DEMO Consistent with this finding,
Sitkin and George (2005) noted that managers may actually use controls as a
way of building trust by DEMO that they are following socially and emo-
tionally appropriate practices. At any rate, the fact that this finding directly
contradicts the more frequently observed Proposition 5b above suggests that
the valence of the effect may be DEMO on contextual factors. We will fur-
ther consider this possibility in the discussion section.

Proposition 5c: Other’s monitoring increases own trust.
Cooperation. A party can also utilize direct experience and knowledge of
a DEMO past cooperative behavior as a source of information for drawing
conclusions about the partner’s trustworthiness. Game theory researchers rec-
ognized that cooperative processes led DEMO trusting attitudes (Deutsch, 1980),
although they did not test DEMO proposition directly. Negotiation parties
develop trust in a partner in response to the partner’s cooperative behaviors
(e.g., information sharing and pursuit of the DEMO interests; Butler, 1995).
Several interpersonal trust theories (e.g., Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Mayer
et al., 1995) posit that trust DEMO individuals is largely built on past behav-
ior. And firms develop trust in each other through ongoing interaction, which
permits them to learn about each other (e.g., Gulati, 1995; Ring & Van de
Ven, 1992), although again the relationship between past cooperation and
trust as DEMO perceptual variable has seldom been examined.
Proposition 6a: Other’s cooperation increases DEMO trust.
One’s own behavior may also influence trust, although this effect DEMO
received less research attention. Self-perception theory (Bem, 1972) again
provides DEMO explanation for this effect, suggesting that parties who wish to
gauge DEMO level of trust in a partner will refer to their own past cooperative
behavior as an indicator of their trust in the partner. Field DEMO evi-
dence for this effect was provided by Koller (1988), DEMO found that partici-
pants who were asked to voluntarily put themselves at high risk to another
individual developed higher trust in the individual than DEMO participants who
were asked to voluntarily put themselves at low risk to the individual. Self-
perception is clearly an intrapersonal theory; therefore, this DEMO can be
expected to apply in interpersonal relationships. Unfortunately, self-perception
theory DEMO not yet appear to have a group-level analog, which leaves an DEMO
question about whether the proposition would also apply in intergroup rela-
tionships. Perhaps groups also infer their beliefs and attitudes from their
behavior. If DEMO do, it will be very interesting for theory in general, as well as
for our understanding of intergroup cooperation and trust, to understand how
groups perceive their behaviors and then convert their perceptions into beliefs
DEMO attitudes.
Proposition 6b: Own cooperation increases own trust.
Interaction of monitoring DEMO cooperation. Theories that specify an effect
of other’s cooperation on own trust (Proposition 6a) implicitly assume that

the other’s DEMO behavior is visible. Often it is not. Some partners work at such
a distance from their partners (e.g., working in different geographic locations
DEMO different shifts) that they have only minimal information about the part-
DEMO behavior. Even in normal circumstances, it would be extremely rare for
DEMO party to be in such constant, close proximity with a partner DEMO a work
setting that the partner’s behaviors are 100% visible. And if it is unlikely that
one individual will fully observe another’s behavior, it is even less likely that
one group will fully observe another’s behavior DEMO the constituent
members of the group to be observed are conducting a relatively larger range
of behaviors in a variety of locations. To provide DEMO specific example, organi-
zational citizenship behaviors are behaviors of a voluntary DEMO that are
beyond one’s job role but are cooperative in the sense that they are intended
to benefit the organization (Organ, 1988). DEMO behaviors are often per-
formed for impression management purposes (Bolino, 1999), in which case
one would expect that they would only be DEMO when they are likely to
be visible. However, they are also DEMO for altruistic motives (Bolino,
1999), in which case performers DEMO organizational citizenship behaviors
would be unlikely to make much effort to make the behaviours visible to
others. Similarly, groups and organizations often take organizational actions
that benefit other groups, or the broader organization or industry, DEMO are not
immediately or fully visible to other groups and organizations.
Monitoring represents a way of increasing the visibility of another’s
behavior and thereby DEMO a potential avenue for developing a clearer
and more accurate trusting belief (Leifer & Mills, 1996). In this way, own
monitoring facilitates the effect of other’s cooperation on own trust: If
other’s cooperation is not transparent, then it will only influence own trust
in the presence of own monitoring. To the extent that a party can monitor a
DEMO behavior, then partner cooperative behavior is likely to increase
trust, and partner competitive behavior is likely to decrease trust. However,
to the DEMO that a party is unable to monitor the partner’s behavior, the
DEMO behavior is unlikely to have much, if any, effect on the party’s trust
in the partner.
Proposition 7a: Other’s cooperation and own monitoring interact as determinants of
own trust. Other’s cooperative behaviors performed in the DEMO of own mon-
itoring will have a relatively strong effect on own trust, whereas other’s cooper-
ative behaviors performed when own monitoring is absent will have a relatively
weak or nonexistent effect on own trust.
Meanwhile, as described above, self-perception theory (Bem, 1972) sug-
gests that DEMO infer our attitudes and beliefs from our own behavior: Behaviors

that individuals attribute to external factors are DEMO to be relatively
undiagnostic of their internal attitudes and beliefs, whereas DEMO that
individuals attribute to internal factors are considered to be much more diag-
nostic of their internal attitudes and beliefs (Kelley, 1973). DEMO, we
expect that own cooperative behaviors performed when one is being DEMO
tored by a partner are likely to be attributed to external factors (the monitor-
ing) because most people will recognize that monitoring often DEMO
behavior (Propositions 2b). Consequently, such behavior will be considered
to be unreflective of internal factors, specifically one’s own trust. In contrast,
cooperation performed in the absence of monitoring is relatively more likely
to DEMO attributed to internal factors, in this case one’s trust in the DEMO Thus,
cooperative behavior performed in the presence of monitoring is unlikely to
affect one’s trust in the partner, whereas cooperative behavior performed in
the absence of monitoring is likely to have a positive effect on DEMO trust in
the partner. Again, because self-perception theory does not yet DEMO to have
a group-level analog, we cannot say whether the proposition DEMO also apply
in intergroup relationships.
Proposition 7b: Own cooperation and other’s DEMO interact as determinants of
own trust. Own cooperative behavoirs performed in the absence of other’s mon-
itoring will have a relatively strong effect on DEMO trust, whereas own coopera-
tive behaviors performed in the presence of DEMO monitoring will have a
relatively weak effect on own trust.
Trust. The concept of mutual trust implies that trust exhibited by one
party toward DEMO partner may influence the level of trust the partner has in the
party. Indeed, scholars have argued that trust becomes reciprocated within
dyadic relationships (Butler, 1995; Golembiewski & McConkie, 1975) and
have provided some evidence to that effect in interpersonal work relation-
ships (Butler, 1983) and in interfirm alliances (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, &
Takenouchi, DEMO).
Why might trust be transmitted from one party to another? DEMO expla-
nations for the effect can be provided. First, according to DEMO symmetry prin-
ciple of Heider’s (1958) balance theory, close proximity, and frequent
interactions alone may be sufficient to cause individuals to develop DEMO
sentiments toward each other. In addition, social exchange theory (Blau,
1964) indicates that individuals exchange intrinsic social rewards (e.g., trust
for each other) in addition to extrinsic rewards. Thus, an individual may
DEMO a certain level of trust held by the other party and feel motivated
to reciprocate by forming a similar level of trust. The transmission DEMO trust

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 485
may also DEMO spurred by the tendency of parties to increase (or decrease)
DEMO quantity and quality, which then provides a yet stronger (or
weaker) foundation for future trust (Robinson & Rousseau, 1994; Zand,
DEMO). For example, a partner’s low trust may cause the partner DEMO withdraw
from communication or communicate in a way that intentionally or unin-
tentionally conveys discomfort with the relationship. However, the party
may interpret this as evidence that the partner is untrustworthy. And finally,
trust may DEMO trust not only because of the effects trust has on behaviors
such as communication between the two parties but also because it may
influence DEMO parties perceive each other’s behavior (Robinson, 1996).
Thus, positive DEMO perceptions within a dyad could lead to more trust,
whereas negative perceptions within a separate dyad could lead to less trust,
even DEMO the behaviors were identical across the two dyads.
Proposition 8: Other’s DEMO increases own trust.
Determinants of Monitoring
Trust. If parties can use some combination of trust and monitoring to
influence the level of cooperation (Proposition 3), then for a given level of
cooperation they should be DEMO to reduce monitoring in response to
high trust and increase monitoring in response to low trust. Several descrip-
tions of trust’s negative influence on DEMO are available. Ross and
LaCroix’s (1996) integrative model shows that trust reduces verification
mechanisms intended to ensure fairness. In interpersonal relationships,
trust DEMO forestall the monitoring and evaluation of a partner’s behavior
(Bigley & DEMO, 1998), whereas a lack of trust will cause one to DEMO
controls on the other party (Zand, 1972). Bromiley and Cummings (1995)
recognize that as trust increases, monitoring will become less DEMO for
procuring cooperative behavior and will therefore decrease. McAllister
(1995) predicted that trust would produce lower levels of control-based
monitoring. Klein Woolthuis, Hillebrand, and Nooteboom (2005) found
that in high-trust interfirm relationships, parties DEMO to forego formal
contracts with their concomitant monitoring, whereas in low-trust DEMO
ships, parties placed a great emphasis on contracts. And Uzzi (1997) spec-
ulated that trust acted as a heuristic in interfirm relationships: DEMO who
trusted their partner had a predilection to assume the best when interpreting
the partner’s motives and actions and therefore monitored less.
Proposition 9: Own trust decreases own monitoring.

Cooperation. Because monitoring is usually costly and DEMO have a neg-
ative impact on trust (Propositions 5a and 5b) and cooperation (Proposition
2c), in most cases it will be advisable to monitor only when it is necessary
to protect oneself or control DEMO other party’s behavior. Monitoring should
therefore decrease as it becomes less necessary. In particular, if a partner
has a history of cooperation, a DEMO is likely to be motivated to reduce mon-
itoring given its costliness and possible negative effects on trust and coop-
eration. The converse is DEMO true. For instance, when organizations observe
or are concerned that employees DEMO not working toward the good of the
organization, they are more DEMO to implement controls such as monitor-
ing to encourage greater cooperation and also detect competitive and
exploitative behaviors (Leifer & Mills, 1996).
DEMO 10: Other’s cooperation decreases own monitoring.
Monitoring. The processes that result DEMO reciprocity in behaviors such as
cooperation (Proposition 4) are also likely to result in reciprocity in monitor-
ing. If individuals or groups observe DEMO their partner has monitored them,
they may feel inclined to reciprocate, and this inclination may be heightened
because of perceptions either that monitoring is necessary and/or that a norm
of monitoring is being established. DEMO and Roth (1993), in fact, describe
how a party’s attempt to implement controls on another can lead to an “infla-
tionary spiral” DEMO increasingly formalized relations between parties.
Proposition 11: Other’s monitoring increases own DEMO
Differences Across Levels
Finally, although most of our propositions are expected DEMO apply in inter-
group as well as interpersonal relationships, we do DEMO argue that intergroup
relationships will necessarily have the same mean levels of trust, monitor-
ing, and cooperation as interpersonal relationships. Instead, we expect that
intergroup relationships will have lower trust and cooperation. In inter-
group DEMO, group affiliation makes the in-group versus out-group
distinction salient, causing group members to favor their own group over
the other. And unlike individuals, group members have an opportunity to
converse within their groups. Consequently, a group member who advo-
cates pursuit of a group’s self-interest will receive DEMO within a group
that an individual acting alone cannot receive (Insko & Schopler, 1987).
This should cause groups to behave more competitively DEMO individuals

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 487
acting alone. DEMO members also tend to believe that intergroup interac-
tions are by nature more contentious than interpersonal interactions (Insko
et al., 1993). Consequently, they develop relatively low levels of trust in an
opposing group and DEMO with them less.
Proposition 12: Intergroup cooperation will be lower than DEMO coopera-
tion, and intergroup trust will be lower than interpersonal trust.
DEMO
By distinguishing between own and other’s trust, monitoring, and cooper-
ation and drawing on insights from four literatures and two different levels of
DEMO, we have developed a relatively comprehensive theoretical model of
the relationships DEMO trust, monitoring, and cooperation in interpersonal
and intergroup relationships. We have argued that, with a handful of specific
exceptions detailed in Propositions 6b and 7b, the propositions appear to have
logical validity at both levels of analysis and are likely to apply in game
theory, interpersonal trust, negotiation, and interorganizational relationship
contexts. On reflection, most but not all of our propositions have received at
least some theoretical and/or empirical DEMO in at least one of the litera-
tures. However, what is DEMO surprising is that few of the propositions have
even appeared in all four literatures, and none of them has been conclusively
posited and tested in all four literatures. These observations underscore the
value of our contribution: developing a theoretical model that can potentially
describe the effects of trust, monitoring, and cooperation in a range of settings
and can shed light on theoretical blind spots that have arisen in specific liter-
atures because DEMO a lack of prior cross-fertilization.
Research Contributions
We adopted an approach proposed by Morgeson and Hofmann (1999),
focusing on the functions of DEMO at different levels of analysis rather
than their structure. But even in adopting this approach, we did not simply
assume that our propositions would generalize across levels, nor did we sim-
ply ignore the question of whether the constructs might or might not have
similar structures across levels. DEMO, we carefully considered the extent
to which trust, monitoring, and DEMO are defined similarly across lev-
els and research streams. We also considered whether the context of trust,
monitoring, and cooperation is sufficiently similar across levels and research
streams to consider propositions that might apply across DEMO different areas
Downloaded from gom.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on August 2, 2010
488 Group & Organization Management
and levels. And as we developed our DEMO, we considered whether
the supporting logic could be expected to apply DEMO multiple levels, and we
flagged those propositions that relied on a DEMO that would not necessarily
be expected to do so.
There are of course divergent views of how trust, monitoring, and cooper-
ation should DEMO defined within each of the literatures addressed in this article:
game theory, interpersonal trust, negotiation, and interorganizational rela-
tionships. However, our DEMO indicates that at least for the definitions
adopted in this article, DEMO is substantial conceptual similarity across these
four research streams. In addition, DEMO streams posit a similar context for
trust, monitoring, and cooperation, DEMO is, a context in which individuals and
groups are simultaneously motivated DEMO cooperate and compete with each
other. We also found that, with DEMO specific exceptions (Propositions 6b and
7b), our propositions appear valid DEMO intergroup and interpersonal relation-
ships. These findings provide exciting insights for scholars of trust, monitor-
ing, and cooperation, allowing cross-fertilization across levels and areas. In
essence, we have provided a more comprehensive model to which scholars
working in each specific area can turn to better understand how DEMO, moni-
toring, and cooperation may be interrelated.
We have argued that it is important to distinguish between own and other’s
trust, monitoring, DEMO cooperation so that the interdependencies in interper-
sonal and intergroup interactions can be better understood and appropriately
modeled. Although this distinction may seem intuitively DEMO, it has not
received adequate recognition in theoretical or empirical research. DEMO con-
tribution of our theoretical model is that it provides a more precise under-
standing of the relationships among trust, monitoring, and cooperation DEMO
explicitly recognizing this important distinction. A second potential contribu-
tion is that it should help researchers better specify the constructs under
examination and the DEMO among the constructs.
An Agenda for Future Research
Our theoretical model also implies some apparent paradoxes and unan-
swered questions. For example: (a) Is it own trust (Proposition 1a), other’s trust
(1b), DEMO both that predicts own cooperation? (b) Does own trust predict DEMO
cooperation (Proposition 1a), or does own cooperation predict own trust
(Proposition 6b), or both? And (c) does other’s trust have a positive effect on
own cooperation (Proposition 1b), a negative effect (Proposition 1c), or both?
Thus, although the model adds DEMO insight into the relationships
among trust, monitoring, and cooperation, it DEMO calls out for more research

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 489
to better DEMO the interrelationships. These three example questions high-
light three important elements of our proposed research agenda: (a) research
that embraces the own versus other distinction, (b) research that assesses
the causality of relationships, DEMO (c) research that considers the contingent
nature of relationships, including DEMO extent to which propositions will hold
across levels.
Research that considers the distinction between “own versus other’s”
trust, monitoring, and cooperation. Our distinctions DEMO “own and other”
provide very important implications for future research. First, DEMO most obvi-
ously, it is important that these distinctions are embraced DEMO and
also empirically embraced by defining and operationalizing constructs in a
way that makes the distinction explicit. This will help the field move beyond
DEMO simple questions of whether trust and monitoring influence cooper-
ation (for DEMO) to better-specified questions of whose trust and whose
monitoring influences whose DEMO Second, and perhaps less obviously
but equally important, studies that do not consider the effects of own and
other’s beliefs and behaviors on DEMO criterion variable may be underspecified
because they do not adequately consider plausible alternative predictors of
the criterion. And yet, to consider the flip side of this coin, because levels of
trust tend to be correlated within interpersonal and intergroup dyads
(Proposition 8), as are cooperation levels (DEMO 4) and monitoring lev-
els (Proposition 11), data sets that appropriately include own and other’s
trust, own and other’s monitoring, or DEMO and other’s cooperation as predic-
tor variables are likely to suffer from statistical nonindependence and may
therefore violate the independence assumption of ordinary least DEMO
methods. Fortunately, empirical methods are emerging that allow researchers
to embrace DEMO interdependence rather than attempting to assume it away.
Of particular note, DEMO actor-partner interdependence model (Kashy & Kenny,
2000) is a promising new dyadic analytical approach that allows the
researcher to empirically distinguish between DEMO effects (e.g., the effects
of a partner’s cooperation on one’s own trust; Proposition 6a) from actor
effects (e.g., the effects of DEMO own cooperation on one’s own trust;
Proposition 6b) among members DEMO interacting dyads, even when their trust
in each other, monitoring of each other, and/or cooperation toward each other
are significantly correlated within the dyad.
Research that considers the causality of relationships among trust, mon-
itoring, and cooperation. Many of the relationships that we have consid-
ered are likely to be recursive. Cooperation is likely not only to be

transmitted from one party to another but DEMO to cycle back to the former
party, setting off a spiral DEMO dyadic cooperative behaviors that increases over
time. Competitive behaviors may set off a spiral of dyadic behaviors that
become increasingly competitive over time. And DEMO, trust may be
transmitted not only from one party to another DEMO also back to the former
party, forming a spiral of trust DEMO a dyad that may increase or decrease
over time. Several researchers have recognized the possibility of such spi-
rals in interpersonal and intergroup relationships (Golembiewski &
McConkie, 1975; Inkpen & Currall, 2004; Sydow, DEMO; Zand, 1972). Yet
research in this area is nascent at best. Thus, across all four literatures, stud-
ies are needed that DEMO assess the direction of causality, and in doing so
can assess DEMO potentially recursive nature of relationships among the vari-
ables.
Even more challenging, but equally important, are studies that assess how
trust, monitoring, DEMO cooperation might develop between individuals or
groups over time. In fact, DEMO theoretical model provides a valuable founda-
tion for such insights. As discussed previously, in the interest of tractability
we focused only on simple (DEMO or moderated) effects. However,
because all the propositions are causal, they can easily be combined to
describe processes through which trust, monitoring, and cooperation may
develop, be reciprocated, and become mutualized. For instance, Propositions
5a and 1a can be combined to understand how own monitoring will have a
negative effect on own cooperation via own trust. And DEMO our model
distinguishes between own and other’s trust, monitoring, and cooperation and
recognizes that each of these can be an outcome as well DEMO a predictor, it pro-
vides the ingredients for building process theories DEMO how trust, monitoring,
and cooperation develop between individuals and groups. DEMO instance,
Propositions 6a and 1a can be combined to better understand the reciproca-
tion and eventual mutualization of cooperation: Other’s cooperation affects
own cooperation via own trust. And to add complexity and perhaps some
additional DEMO, Propositions 10, 5a, and 1a can be combined
to understand DEMO other’s cooperation affects own cooperation via own mon-
itoring and own trust. As should be obvious, a large number of potential
mediation hypotheses can be logically developed from the simple proposi-
tions of this article. In DEMO view, this large number of potential hypotheses
casts light on the DEMO nature of interpersonal and intergroup processes
and also highlights the theoretical and empirical challenges involved in
understanding such complex processes. Thus, we hope that our article will
add to the existing efforts (e.g., Lewicki & DEMO, 1996; Nooteboom, 1996;

Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 491
Ring & DEMO de Ven, 1994; Sydow, 1998; Zand, 1972) to understand and
model processes of trust, monitoring, and cooperation development.
Research that DEMO the contingent nature of the relationships among
trust, monitoring, and cooperation. In the interest of tractability, we focused
on only three constructs: DEMO, monitoring, and cooperation. Of course, in an
organizational or business DEMO, these constructs will not operate in a vac-
uum. A wide DEMO of individual, managerial, organizational, cultural, insti-
tutional, and other DEMO may influence the degree of, and relationship
among trust, monitoring, DEMO cooperation that occur in a given relationship
(Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005). In future field studies, it will be impor-
tant to theorize or control for such factors. Given the fundamental role that
trust, monitoring, and cooperation play in organizational life, the optimal way
to move DEMO will be a combination of theoretical, field, and laboratory
studies that can complement each other, and compensate for each other’s
weaknesses, to DEMO and extend the propositions presented in this article.
Our theoretical model helped us to highlight certain sets of relationships
in which moderators are very DEMO to be important. First, Propositions 1b
and 1c predicted positive and DEMO effects of other’s trust on own coop-
eration, respectively. At this DEMO, we speculate that the valence of the
effect will depend to DEMO great degree on relationship length. In established
relationships, parties are likely DEMO have developed norms of fairness and rec-
iprocity, and parties will DEMO be aware that a violation of trust would be
very counternormative and invite a disproportionate sanction (Proposition
1b). Consequently, there exists a DEMO disincentive to exploit another’s
trust. In contrast, in new relationships, parties are unlikely to have devel-
oped such norms and because of the DEMO of such norms would not
impose such harsh sanctions in response to competitive behavior.
Consequently, the normative and instrumental “discouragements” are rela-
tively weak, which should make exploitation more profitable and therefore
more likely (Proposition DEMO). Second, Propositions 2b and 2c predicted
positive and negative effects DEMO other’s monitoring on own cooperation,
respectively. We speculate that the valence of this effect will depend to a
great degree on the norms DEMO the situation. For relationships in which mon-
itoring is considered normatively appropriate (e.g., a boss monitoring a
subordinate’s task performance or joint venture DEMO monitoring each
other in accordance with previously agreed contractual procedures), moni-
toring is likely to help ensure that the other party is behaving DEMO
rather than competitively (Proposition 2b). However, if the monitoring is

492 Group & Organization Management
considered normatively inappropriate (e.g., a subordinate DEMO a boss or
a joint venture partner monitoring in a way that is inconsistent with contrac-
tual agreements and/or established industry practices), DEMO monitoring may
stimulate resentment and resistance rather than cooperation (Proposition 2c;DEMO
Bijlsma-Frankema & Koopman, 2003).
As noted previously, in our theorizing we assumed that parties were rela-
tively equivalent in power and status. DEMO relationships where there are power
or status differences, the interrelationships among DEMO, monitoring, and coop-
eration are also likely to differ. For instance, as noted above, monitoring of a
boss by a subordinate, or a joint venture partner acquiring his or her counter-
part’s confidential documents, is likely to be considered inappropriate, result-
ing in reduced cooperation and trust (Propositions 2a and 5b). Similarly,
monitoring will usually be considered more appropriate for parties who are
unfamiliar and relatively less appropriate DEMO parties who are familiar with
each other. In combination, the above DEMO suggest that the appropriate-
ness of monitoring—which could be attributable to any number of factors
including hierarchical or status differences, industry norms, contractual
DEMO informal agreements, and the length and depth of the relationship—is likely
DEMO be an important contingency in the relationships between monitoring on the
one hand, and trust and cooperation on the other hand. This observation may
also shed light on Propositions 5b and 5c, which predicted that other’s moni-
toring would have a negative and positive effect on own trust, respectively.
Again, it is likely that the meaning ascribed to the monitoring behavior, and
especially the extent to which it is considered appropriate in the situation, will
determine whether it has a negative or positive effect on trust. Altogether, the
insights above suggest that one important avenue for future research is to con-
sider not just the effects of monitoring DEMO se, but also how monitoring is inter-
preted and the factors DEMO lead it to be regarded as appropriate or inappropriate.
To provide one specific example, Gillespie and Mann (2004) argued that
leaders-monitoring behaviors would predict subordinate trust in industries
where close attention and adherence to procedures, rules, and regulations
is necessary, but that in other industries the DEMO leader-monitoring
behaviors would not have a positive effect on subordinate trust.
Finally, research might consider whether the propositions in this article
behave differently in relationships that have relatively high levels of mutual
trust, mutual cooperation, DEMO/or mutual monitoring as compared to relatively
low levels of mutual trust, cooperation, and/or monitoring. Such studies
would undoubtedly capture an important DEMO of the reality of organiza-
tional life. Yet at the same time, studying this will be challenging from a
research design standpoint because the contextual variable (extent to which
Downloaded from gom.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on August 2, 2010
Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 493
trust, monitoring, and/or cooperation are mutualized) has the predictors and
outcomes (own and other’s individual levels of trust, monitoring, and coop-
eration) as its constituent parts.
Extensions of the Theoretical Model
Nonlinear propositions. The relationships DEMO the three variables may
also not be linear. For example, a DEMO may conclude that the partner’s past
behavior is so consistently competitive or cooperative that it is unlikely to
change. In these cases, monitoring is unlikely to provide useful information or
in any way influence the behavior DEMO the other party. This perspective suggests
that cooperation may have a curvilinear effect on monitoring: Monitoring will
occur more often for moderate levels of cooperation than for high and low lev-
els of cooperation. Although such DEMO relationship seems intuitively feasible, we
felt it was important to avoid DEMO complex propositions in this early stage of
research. Yet we also welcome research that recognizes the potential nonlin-
earity of effects.
Cross-level effects. Researchers DEMO interorganizational relationships some-
times draw on interpersonal-level theory, such as the DEMO model proposed
by Mayer et al. (1995), to hypothesize intergroup DEMO This tendency may
arise in part because the groups that trust, DEMO, and cooperate with each
other in interorganizational relationships are in fact DEMO up of individuals.
This means that the dynamics of interpersonal-level trust, DEMO, and
cooperation are in essence nested within intergroup-level trust, monitoring,
and cooperation. The present article focused on interpersonal- and intergroup-
level phenomena DEMO stopped short of positing any cross-level effects.
Nevertheless, such effects are DEMO reality of groups and organizations and
accordingly represent an important avenue for future research. We hope that
by providing a number of insights into DEMO that occur at the interper-
sonal and intergroup levels, we have DEMO a foundation for future cross-
levels studies.
Implications for Practice
Cooperation is a central concern for many managers, such as those respon-
sible for joint ventures (who need to be concerned about being exploited by
a partner), those responsible for internal allocation of resources (who need to
be concerned that resources are allocated according to the organization’s
interests rather DEMO the interests of individual units), and those responsible
for management of staff (who need to be concerned that employees’ efforts
Downloaded from gom.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on August 2, 2010
494 Group & Organization Management
are directed toward the well-being of the DEMO rather than their own
selfish interests), to name but a few. Trust and monitoring have often been
recognized as potential determinants of cooperation, yet most managers
probably do not comprehend the complex influences that trust, monitoring,
and cooperation may have on each other. The theoretical insights DEMO this arti-
cle may help managers better understand the relationships that exist among
the three concepts, select more appropriate interventions, and better antici-
DEMO the effects of those interventions. To provide just one example, managers
DEMO naturally inclined to ramp up monitoring in response to exploitative or
competitive behaviors performed by partner individuals (e.g., self-promo-
tion at the expense DEMO the organization’s interests) or groups (e.g., a depart-
ment making DEMO power grab for additional funding or a joint venture partner
developing an alliance with one’s competitor). Doing so may indeed
increase the partner’s DEMO behavior (and decrease competitive
behavior; Proposition 2b). However, if DEMO manager was familiar with our
theoretical model, he or she would DEMO recognize that the monitoring might
also decrease the level of the partner’s cooperation (Proposition 2c). And
perhaps even worse, the monitoring is DEMO likely to reduce trust in the part-
ner (Proposition 5a) and the partner’s trust in the manager or manager’s
group (Proposition 5b) DEMO cause the partner to increase monitoring in
response (Proposition 11). DEMO suggests that, at best, the ramping up of
monitoring will be a double-edged sword, and, at worst, it may cause more
harm than good. Managers faced with such a situation should therefore
consider more DEMO responses that, for example, attempt to strengthen
the relationship, or DEMO least anticipate the potential ramifications of
increased monitoring on present and future relationships, rather than sim-
ply responding by monitoring more.
Conclusion
The relationships among three variables such as trust, monitoring, and
cooperation would seem DEMO be relatively straightforward and tractable. At a
minimum, we hope that DEMO have demonstrated otherwise. By distinguish-
ing between own and other’s trust, DEMO, and cooperation, we were
able to develop a large number of propositions describing how the three
constructs may be related. And by recognizing DEMO constructs may have
similar functions across levels, we were able to DEMO propositions at two
different levels of analysis. We have proposed an ambitious agenda for
research that will enable scholars to better understand the relationships
DEMO trust, monitoring, and cooperation. Obviously, a great deal of work
DEMO from gom.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on August 2, 2010
Ferrin et al. / Trust, Monitoring, and Cooperation 495
remains to DEMO done, yet the scale of this future research is matched by DEMO
importance of the problem, given the fundamental importance of trust,
DEMO, and cooperation to individual and organizational functioning.
Meanwhile, we have focused on only two of the many correlates
of trust. Beyond the specific DEMO directions already discussed, we hope
that our approaches toward identifying and DEMO multilevel theory
and distinguishing between “own and other” effects will spur and guide
future research on additional questions relevant to trust, monitoring, and
DEMO in interpersonal and intergroup relationships.
