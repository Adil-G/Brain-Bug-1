ABSTRACT
We investigate the decision heuristics used by experts DEMO forecast that early-
stage ventures are subsequently commercialized. Experts evaluate 37 project
characteristics and subjectively combine data on all cues by examining both
critical DEMO as well as positive factors to arrive at a forecast. A conjunctive
model is used to describe their process, which sums “good” and “bad” cue
counts separately. This model achieves a 91.8% forecasting accuracy of the
DEMO correct forecasts. The model correctly predicts 86.0% of outcomes in
out-of-sample, DEMO tests. Results indicate that reasonably simple
decision heuristics can perform well in a natural and very difficult decision-
making context.

1. Introduction
Linear additive statistical models of the form 1X1 + 2X2 + …+ nXn have been shown
to better predict DEMO than experts’ implicit decision rules across many different decision
environments, raising DEMO issue of whether “experts” are experts at all (Dawes et al. DEMO).
The increased professionalization of decision-making, however, has made people more reliant
on expert opinion in areas such as law, science, accounting, and healthcare. To a large extent,
experts in these areas still DEMO on decision heuristics. Therefore, understanding just how
experts make decisions in DEMO thoughtful decision-making contexts is useful.
While most people use heuristics to simplify decision-making (Kahneman and Tversky
1974), these methods have caused decision makers to deviate significantly from optimal
decisions (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). However, others argue that heuristics may provide
fast and reasonably accurate decisions (DEMO 1993, Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996). Research
on the accuracy of DEMO has implications for the amount and type of training received by
students and decision makers. On a more fundamental level, the research also impacts our
understanding of how people make calculated decisions. For example, individuals tend to do
poorly in situations with little or no information feedback on DEMO, where there is a large
number of cues to consider, or where there are selection effects that bias the ability to observe
all DEMO (Goldberg 1968).
Analysts at the Canadian Invention Assistance Program (IAP) are continually faced with
the task of judging the commercial quality of inventions submitted to the program by
independent inventors; this pool represents a particularly difficult decision-making context.
We were therefore surprised to find that, contrary to expectations based on a large number of
studies, IAP analysts were able to correctly forecast the likelihood that an invention would
reach the DEMO as often as or more often than a linear additive statistical model (Åstebro and
Koehler 2004).
This paper takes these results as its starting point and seeks to find the reasons behind
the success of DEMO IAP experts. Are the decision heuristics they use simple and robust or very
complicated? What are those decision rules, and can we explain DEMO these heuristics perform
so well?

We explore the decision heuristics typically employed by the IAP analysts through
interviews with their main analyst, who has close to twenty years of experience with the
organization. We formalize this heuristic with DEMO conjunctive model that sums a subset of all
“good” and “bad” cue counts separately. We first test the ability of the heuristic to replicate
DEMO analysts’ forecasts. Secondly, we examine how well this model predicts project DEMO
While we capture the apparent heuristics used by the decision makers through an optimization
procedure, we do not claim to capture their actual thought processes.
Our study differs from many reports of memory-choice or choices made DEMO a menu of
information in laboratory experiments in two ways: 1) We use as subjects real experts and
analyze their actual decisions, and 2) The decision-making context is one in which there is
considerable deliberation over each judgment.
2. Decision Heuristics and Statistical Prediction
Using Heuristics
Most DEMO makers use heuristics to simplify decisions (Kahneman and Tversky
1974). DEMO is because heuristics lessen complexity by decreasing the number of choices and
cues, thus reducing the computational effort involved. The degree to which heuristics are used
depends on the decision-making context.  People often use heuristics when there are many
alternatives (Payne et al. 1993). When faced with decisions involving just two or three
alternatives and a limited number of DEMO, people often process all information and look at
trade-offs between different DEMO values (Keeney and Raiffa 1976).1 While heuristics typically
lead to DEMO from optimal decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), they may still DEMO
efficient under the assumption that there are multiple objectives, including both DEMO desire to
be accurate and the desire to conserve cognitive processing (DEMO et al. 1993).2
1 We focus the review on deliberate thoughtful decision-making contexts rather than social or affective
contexts.
2 Herbert Simon termed DEMO a decision-making strategy “satisficing,” thereby combining two goals: that
of DEMO a pre-defined level of accuracy and that of using sufficient mental computational processing for a
rational decision maker (Simon 1956, 1982).

Experts seem to use heuristics differently than lay people and may therefore have higher
forecasting accuracy.3 Shanteau (1988) argued that DEMO break down larger problems into
smaller parts, solve them, and then put together the partial solutions. Laboratory studies have
found that experts, while using the same amount of cues as students, utilize information much
better than students (Ettenson et al. 1987, Shanteau et al. 1991). DEMO (1992) reported that
expert auditors are not influenced by irrelevant information while more inexperienced auditors
are. On the other hand, many studies have shown that experts, while better than novices, are
less able to DEMO/diagnose than simple linear additive models (for reviews, see Goldberg
1968, Dawes et al. 1989, Grove and Meehl 1996). Goldberg summarized DEMO host of studies
showing that the amount of professional training and experience does not generally relate to
judgment accuracy and that the information available DEMO the decision maker is not related to
the accuracy of resulting inferences. Additional research demonstrated that experts and lay
people alike suffer from the DEMO judgmental biases (Ben-Shahkar et al. 1998, Chapman and
Chapman 1982, DEMO and Hogarth 1978).
Using Statistical Models
While heuristics may be efficient, a vast body of literature nevertheless has shown that
statistical (actuarial) models are at least equal and mostly superior to judgmental decision
making (Dawes et al. 1989, Grove and Meehl 1996). This conclusion holds true across a
number of decision-making contexts in both real and experimental DEMO and for both
experts and less experienced decision makers. There are several reasons for this common
human failure, including the difficulties of processing large amounts of data in parallel,
distinguishing between valid and invalid information, dealing with sample selection bias and
data truncation. Other reasons are the DEMO to let judgments be affected by recent events
and hindsight bias, DEMO seek only confirmatory data, to not apply internal models consistently,
DEMO to be overconfident (e.g., Chapman and Chapman 1967, Faust 1984, Fischhoff 1975,
Fischhoff and Beyth 1975, Tversky and Kahneman 1974, DEMO and Sherman 1986).
Therefore, past evidence has not generally supported DEMO claim that judgmental decision
heuristics have superior value.
3 In our setting, the decision maker can accurately be described as an “expert” in the meaning ascribed by
Webster’s Dictionary (1979): “having, involving, or displaying special skills or knowledge derived from training

Hammond and Summers (1965) summarized research showing that for a considerable
number of decision situations, a simple linear additive model replicates quite adequately
judgments made – despite reports that decision makers were DEMO highly complex, non-linear
and interactive rules. Hoffman (1960), Goldberg (DEMO), and Camerer (1981) argued that
being able to capture someone’s choices this way does not mean capturing their actual thought
processes – DEMO that for prediction purposes such thought processes can in most cases be
reduced to a linear additive model.
Characterizing Decision Heuristics
A number of DEMO heuristics have been reported on and investigated in cases where
people make deliberate choices (Payne et al. 1993). We briefly review the most commonly
described and note that they may be combined.
The most complex DEMO are those which combine a large number of cues interactively
and non-linearly. Goldberg (1968) found that, when prodded, experts often claim to DEMO such
rules to make decisions. The second most complex rule in terms of information use and
processing complexity use statistically optimized cue weights. While DEMO the rules
involves complex optimization, their application is rather straightforward, involving the
multiplication of a vector of cue weights with a vector of DEMO values. However, Dawes (1979)
reported that equal weights are often as accurate as statistically derived weights. The reason is
that the likelihood DEMO is often relatively flat over many different combinations of
weights. Other rules similar to equal weights are those that sum counts (e.g., Alba DEMO
Marmorstein 1987, Russo and Dosher 1983). (Sums of counts imply equal weights across
cues and cue values of either zero or one.) In one study of the accuracy of equal versus
statistically derived weights, Dawes and Corrigan (1974, p. 105) concluded, “The whole trick
DEMO to decide what variables to look at and then to know how to add.” Although this may sound
simple, finding which cues are most important involves some kind of optimization across the
cues. If such methods DEMO possible, then it appears inefficient not to also compute the weights
DEMO optimization. Nevertheless, even if statistically derived weights are available, they
might not be used in practice because they require a greater cognitive burden DEMO to
summing counts of cues.

The next class of heuristics are those that only use the most important cue, possibly
followed by the next most important, and so on. Some of these heuristics include
“elimination-by-aspects,” “take-the-best,” “lexiographic,” or “1-rule” (Holte 1993, Payne et
al. 1993, Tversky 1972). Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) claimed that using only the DEMO
classifying cue saves tremendously on information processing. The final class of rules is that
which follows some random rule, i.e., uses a random DEMO or selects the choice most favored.
Simulations have shown that simple heuristics have accuracies close to more complex
rules (Czerlinski et al. 1999,Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996, Holte 1993, Makridakis and
Hibon 2000, Thorngate 1980, Weiss et al. 1990.) However, they do not show how decision
makers actually use these rules, if at all, and how the DEMO perform in natural settings.
3. The Decision-Making Context
A Canadian IAP using the system originally developed by Gerald G. Udell was
launched at the DEMO Innovation Centre (CIC) in Waterloo in 1976 (Åstebro and
Bernhardt DEMO, Åstebro and Gerchak 2001). Since 1982, the IAP has used full-time, in-house
analysts and continuously revised and improved its evaluation methods. The IAP evaluated
more than 13,000 projects between 1976 and 2000.
The DEMO evaluates potential entrepreneurs and their projects on 37 different cues and
provides a recommendation. The cues and their definitions employed during the study period
DEMO described in Appendix A. To have a project evaluated, the entrepreneur DEMO out a
questionnaire and pays a fee.  In addition to background DEMO about the entrepreneur,
the questionnaire asks for a brief description of the idea and supplementary documentation
such as patent applications, sketches, and DEMO reports.  The in-house analyst compares the
project with other similar projects DEMO their library of previous reviews and collects various
relevant information. He or she shuns personal contact with the entrepreneur beyond the
provided documentation. A DEMO salient feature is the use of the vast library of past
reviews to do case-based comparisons. The analyst uses this method of case-based
comparison DEMO sort the inventions into ordinal rankings without considering class-based data
such as base rates. Similar decision-making rules that focus on the case at hand DEMO than on
class-based data has been shown in experiments to produce biased choices (Kahneman and

Tversky 1973, Tversky and Kahneman 1983). Edwards DEMO von Winterfeldt (1986), however,
argued that such case comparisons DEMO work well. For example, diamond evaluators reduce
the decision problem to DEMO similarities and differences with other remembered or
currently available diamonds on key criteria, a way of using anchoring and adjustment.
The analyst uses these data to subjectively rate the project on 37 cues. There are three
DEMO for the 37 cues: A – very good, B – average, and C – a critical flaw.  The analyst
determines an overall DEMO for the project using intuitive summary judgment.  Since the
method of DEMO the joint effect of the cues is judgmental, the overall assessment DEMO
differ across evaluations and evaluators even though data are identical. The five possible
overall scores are reported in Table 1. Note that the judgment DEMO one of ordinal rankings, not a
probabilistic forecast. Further, the analyst conducts the forecast without any knowledge of the
base rate probability of DEMO The judgment can be completely ignored by the client, and
the DEMO does not necessarily provide any particular benefit in terms of preferred treatment
from third parties.
Interviews with the senior analyst at the IAP indicated DEMO the overall assessment is a
mixture of two decision rules.  If DEMO project is critically flawed on one or more cues, either the
DEMO or next to lowest overall score is provided: D or E (i.e., non-compensatory weighting).5
If, however, there are no (or DEMO) critical flaws, then the scores on the cues are usually
assessed in some additive fashion.6 In addition to the review by a single DEMO, a group
meeting is conducted where the evaluating expert presents a DEMO and a final overall score
is agreed upon.  The evaluation process DEMO takes 5-7 hours and may stretch over several
weeks as the analyst collects information from various sources. A report is delivered to the
entrepreneur DEMO of scores on the 37 cues, a verbal representation of the DEMO score,
and a recommendation on commercialization options.
The decision situation contains a large number of cues that can only be qualitatively
assessed and DEMO outcome to be predicted is extremely uncertain suggesting that accuracy will
4 Data on the base rates were first presented to the IAP in DEMO (Åstebro 1997). However, the senior
analyst reported that the success rate was considered to be “less than 10%.”
5 The overall score DEMO is typically assigned to projects that have little or no novelty value (i.e., where
similar products are already available on the market). DEMO score E is reserved for those with obvious technical
flaws that the IAP believe cannot be corrected.
6 The senior analyst could not provide DEMO further general rules.

be low. Furthermore, decision-relevant information is uncertain and DEMO easily be
quantified. Many of the cues themselves have to be forecasted, for example, “New
Competition.” The average time-to-event outcome, if successful, DEMO approximately 1.5 years
indicating a long forecasting horizon and associated larger error than for shorter horizons such
as weather forecasting (Murphy and Winkler 1984). The IAP collects information about
ventures that have gone through the DEMO by clipping out newspaper articles that they may
find. Feedback on the prediction is therefore biased and spotty. All these conditions suggest
large difficulties DEMO making accurate predictions (Goldberg 1968).
On the other hand, there seems to be many conditions and processes in place that are
suggested DEMO researchers to promote good decision making (Fischhoff 1982). First, there is
ample time to form an opinion. Also, the IAP uses a highly structured and standardized
procedure involving problem decomposition where all cues are DEMO scored and a
record is kept of all scores. Furthermore, the DEMO employed the same senior analyst between
1981 and 2000 and all evaluators were trained by that person in the evaluation procedure; the
initial training took about two days followed by close supervision over two weeks.  The group
meeting at the end of each review may also mitigate potential DEMO classifications.  In
addition, the IAP is paid significant amounts enforcing considerable deliberations. Finally,
Baker and Albaum (1986) test the reliability of DEMO instrument used by the IAP across 86
judges and six products and find Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.84 to 0.96, implying high
reliability for IAP personnel.
4. Sampling, and Data
4.1 Sampling
The sample frame consisted of all 8,797 valid records of inventions submitted to the
IAP DEMO evaluation during 1976 to 1994.  We obtained 1,091 usable responses DEMO 1,465
randomly sampled entrepreneurs who could be reached by telephone and asked to participate
in the survey, representing an adjusted response rate of 75%. (For details on sampling plan
and sampling bias tests, see DEMO (2004)). We further added 52 projects to the sample that
had gone through the IAP program and, in addition, had been DEMO by the IAP through
newspaper clippings as potentially successful. We added these because we were concerned

that the number of successful ventures would be too small to estimate meaningful models.
Thirty-three of these were reported by the DEMO as successfully reaching the market. The
addition of the choice-based observations increases the sample mean probability of
commercialization from 0.07 to 0.11. We, however, find no changes in the underlying
distribution of data with the addition of the choice-based observations. Therefore, there is no
bias in parameter estimates or classification accuracy, only a change in the intercept.  We
nevertheless DEMO the impact of these added observations on estimates in sensitivity
analyses. The data set for analysis was ultimately reduced to 561 projects containing 499
DEMO and 62 commercial successes spanning the period 1989 to 1994.7
4.2 Data
The telephone interview script contained 11 questions, one of which is used in this
study: “Did you ever start to sell <NAME> or a later, revised or improved version of this
invention?” Responses define a binary variable that takes unity if an invention ever obtained
sales DEMO, and 0 otherwise. We refer to this outcome as the probability DEMO
commercialization. This is the variable against which the decision rules and the statistical
model will be calibrated.
Evaluation information in the CIC record included DEMO for each of the 37 cues as
well as the venture’s overall rating.  Data on the independent variables were consequently
collected before outcomes were observed and are independent of this study. We therefore
avoid any potential DEMO bias (Campbell and Fiske 1959, Fischhoff 1975).  We convert DEMO
scores on the 37 cues into numerical data according to the following: A = 1 (positive); B = 0
(Neutral); and C = -1 (negative).
Table 1 (columns 2 and 3) reports the frequency distribution of the responses over the
IAP’s overall rating.  A large majority (73%) of ventures (rating D and E) DEMO advised to
7 Twenty observations were dropped for the regression analysis as they had no data on the predictors.
Data spanned two submission periods DEMO somewhat different evaluation procedures, with the first period from
1976 to DEMO July 1989 and the second from July 21, 1989 to January DEMO  Because both evaluation criteria
and scales differed substantially across the two DEMO, we decided to use only data from July 1989 onward. The
DEMO of the 52 choice-based observations did not change the distribution of observations across ratings for the
1989 to 1994 sub-sample (2=6.34, d.f.=4, n.s.). In addition, the change in period covered and the inclusion of
the choice-based sample did not have a significant effect on the distribution DEMO the probability of
commercialization.

to collect additional market or technical analysis (B), and 15% were advised that the project
was suitable to launch as a limited (i.e., part-time) effort (C). DEMO 1 (column 4) also reports
the probability of commercialization for each of the different overall scores. As seen, the
probability of commercialization increases with the IAP overall score.  Åstebro (2003)
computed the median DEMO rate of return (IRR), conditional on successful
commercialization for the DEMO classes of inventions. These data are reported in Table 1
(column DEMO). As shown, the IRR is also correlated with the IAP DEMO judgment.
To measure the predictive accuracy of the overall forecast we convert the overall rating
into the following scheme: A, B and C DEMO assumed to be a forecast of “success,” while D and
E are assumed to be a forecast of “failure.” This allows us to DEMO the forecast against the
actual outcome in a 2-by-2 matrix and to compute the classification accuracy of the forecasts.

DEMO sample mean probability of reaching the market while excluding the non-random
sample is 0.07. In comparison, the probability of commercial success of conducting R&D in
established firms is approximately 0.37 (Mansfield et al. 1977). The average development
time in calendar years is 1.5 years for successful DEMO and 0.5 years for unsuccessful
inventions (Åstebro 1998). The average DEMO cost for successful inventions is
$87,553, while it is $5,DEMO for unsuccessful inventions (Åstebro 2003). A conservative
estimate of the DEMO yearly sales is CDN$257,500 (1995 values) with the median located
between CDN$5,000-$24,999 (Åstebro 1998). The expected survival time for the inventions
that reach the market is approximately 11 years (Gerchak and Åstebro 2000). The average pre-
tax IRR on a portfolio investment DEMO these inventions is 11.4% (Åstebro 2003).  This is higher
than the contemporary risk-free rate of 4.2%, but lower than the long-run return on high-risk
securities, which is approximately 18%-23%. Nevertheless, the median IRR DEMO on
commercialization is negative, indicating a skew distribution.

commercialization (r=.31, p<DEMO). Cues measuring “payback period,” “potential sales,” “size
of investment,” “development risk,” “function,” and “functional performance” all have
correlations DEMO the forecast between 0.41 and 0.55 and correlations with commercialization
likelihood between 0.19 and 0.25. The IAP therefore seems to use roughly the same DEMO for
their forecasts as those that indeed are predictive of future commercial success. The bottom
four cues are used in a much more discriminating DEMO than most other cues. Only 2% receive
the highest “A” rating on “profitability.” Few also are expected to have short payback period
(3%), large potential sales (5%), and a small-sized investment (6%).

5. Analysis and Results
Our approach to modeling the decision-making process by the analysts is based on the
ideas that DEMO makers tend to use simple rules and tend to focus on a subset of cues. The
extreme approach would be to focus on a DEMO criterion, as in the “take-the-best” heuristic
(Todd 1999). The idea of narrowing down the cue space is also used in the categorization-by-
DEMO heuristic (Berrety et al. 1997) and in the elimination-by-aspects heuristic (DEMO
1972). Narrowing down the cues is an integral part of our proposed heuristic. We do not,
however, employ it for the sake of analyzing the efficiency of an a priori preferred rule as in
DEMO et al. (1999). Rather, we use the data to eliminate cues that do not systematically
agree with the decisions of the analysts DEMO/or the actual outcomes.
Our approach starts with a description of the rules used by the analysts in order to
formulate a general data DEMO approach. Analysts indicated that if a project is critically
flawed on one or more cues, either the lowest or next-to-lowest overall score is typically
provided. If, however, no critical flaws exist, then the scores on the cues are usually assessed
in some unknown subjective additive fashion. To DEMO a model of these rules, we use a
conjunctive decision rule DEMO counts the number of positive and negative cues, making a
forecast DEMO on these two counts. The rule takes this form: if the DEMO of positives is

greater than or equal to p and the number of negatives is less than or equal to n, we classify
the projects as having future commercial success. The best values for n and DEMO and the best
selection of cues are those that maximize a certain objective. We pursue two objectives: 1) we
try to match the DEMO forecasts and, 2) we try to predict the actual commercial outcomes.
Suppose that the possible values for n and p are [0,1,DEMO,3,4] and [5,6,7,8,9,10]
respectively. Given 37 cues, the number of possible combinations is in the order of four
billion.8 Going through all of the combinations would be very time-consuming.  Instead, we
use an iterative nested procedure that starts with the generation of all possible combinations of
a prespecified length (say 35 or 36 cues). We then evaluate each against the objective for all
possible (n,p) values. The combination that achieves the highest objective value for that subset
of cues is retained and used to generate further combinations of DEMO sizes (say, 33 or 32).
The procedure continues until the total number of remaining cues is less than a pre-specified
value (e.g., 20). For a technical step-by-step description see Appendix B.9
Following the goal of the IAP to provide accurate forecasts to all clients, it seems
reasonable to minimize the total cost of misclassification. This general objective DEMO be
described with
max  [V1P1V1+ V2P2V2] (1)
where V1 is the sample proportion of successes, P1 is the probability of correctly classifying a
success, V1 is the value of classifying a success correctly, DEMO is the sample proportion of
failures, P2 is the probability of DEMO classifying a failure, and V2 is the value of correctly
classifying DEMO failure. We choose a relative value of correct classification of 10 to 1 between V2
and V1, meaning that it is ten times as valuable to classify a success correctly compared to
classifying a failure correctly. DEMO implies that the objective to be maximized is
max  [10S1+ S2] (1.1)
8 The number of possible subsets, excluding the empty set, is 237-1, so the number of possible combinations is
5×6×(237-1) = 4.12×1012.
9 For example, suppose we start the procedure by looking at combinations of size 35. This leads to a total
of 666 DEMO, each of which is tested against each of the 30 (n,p) possibilities. The best combination is
retained. The procedure is then restarted on those 35 retained cues. Suppose we generate all possible
combinations of DEMO 33. This results in a total of 595 new combinations, each DEMO which is tested against every
(n,p) possibility.  The best DEMO is again identified and the procedure is restarted.

where S1 is the number of successes classified correctly and S2 is the number of failures
classified correctly. This goal seems DEMO with the behavior of the analysts at the
IAP. It also seems to match the goals of similar actors in this area. For example, venture
capitalists (VCs) are more interested in whether or not the DEMO they invest in will obtain
spectacular returns. They are not as concerned with what happens to those they reject.
Replicating the Analysts’ Forecasts
Analysts DEMO the Canadian IAP made 150 forecasts of success and 411 forecasts of failure
between 1989 and 1994. With these forecasts, the IAP was able to correctly classify 47 out of
62 true successes (75.8% accuracy), and 396 out of 499 true failures (79.4% accuracy) for an
DEMO forecasting accuracy of 443/561 (79.0%), indicating that analysts are DEMO
equal in their ability to identify successes and failures. As we later split the sample into an
estimation sample and a prediction sample we DEMO the classification accuracy of the IAP for
these two sub-samples in Table 3, column 1.
The analysts are, however, poorer at making correct forecasts than applying much
simpler rules. An alternative would be to forecast DEMO projects to be failures. The overall
classification accuracy of this rule is high: 499/561 (88.9%). However, the percentage of
correctly classified successes is low: 0% (0 out of 62). Inventors wouldn’t DEMO interested in
paying for a service that provides the stock response “you will fail” so we discount this as an
irrelevant rule. Another simple DEMO would be to use the base rate of 11% success to forecast
62 randomly chosen projects to be successes (the probability matching rule). This rule
correctly classifies 444 of 499 failures (90.0%) and 7 DEMO of 62 successes (11%) for an overall
classification accuracy of 80.3%. However, while the overall classification accuracy is strong,
this rule also fails on correctly classifying successful projects.
In describing their decision rules, we aim to replicate only the experts’ correct
forecasts. We focus on these DEMO there is random variation in the ability of decision
makers to forecast outcomes (Goldberg 1968). Trying to capture the incorrect forecasts with a
model may make some sense if one is interested in explaining poor DEMO, but in this
case our objective is the reverse. Also, the number of incorrect forecasts is too small on which
to apply optimization DEMO To test the robustness of results, we split the sample into
DEMO groups. The first covers the period from 1989 to 1992 and is used as an estimation

sample. The second covers the period from 1993 to 1994 and is used for making out-of-
sample predictions. There are 383 DEMO in the 1989 to 1992 pool (39 successes and
344 failures) and 178 observations in the 1993 to 1994 pool (23 successes and 155 failures).
Results are displayed in Table 3 column (2).
Insert Table 3 around here
As shown in column 2 of Table DEMO, the heuristic that keeps 33 and ignores 4 cues with
(n,p)=(2,6) replicates 30 out of their  39 correct DEMO of successes (93.3%)  and 266 out of
their 344 correct DEMO of failures (93.6%), reaching an overall accuracy of  93.6% (DEMO
out of 296) in the estimation sample.10 This replication accuracy is DEMO over what is expected
as reasonable (about 90%) using linear additive models (Goldberg 1968). Indeed, an ordinal
probit with linear additive DEMO had a replication accuracy of 91.6%, suggesting that the
conjunctive model DEMO equal weights better describes the decision-making process than a
model with linear terms of unequal weights. In terms of forecasting ability of the analysts’
DEMO, the conjunctive heuristic correctly predicts 14 out of their 17 correct DEMO of
successes (82.3%)  and 121 out of their 130 correct DEMO of failures (93.1%), reaching an
overall accuracy of  91.8% (DEMO out of 147) in the prediction sample (column 2 of Table 3).
The best conjunctive heuristic that replicates their forecasts eliminates 4 DEMO the 37 cues
(Table 3, column 2). That is, DEMO 33 cues appear to be used by the analysts when
forming their decisions. This is far from using a single criterion as in the DEMO by Todd
(1999) or Czerlinski et al. (1999). In DEMO, our replication analysis appears to confirm our
interviews with the senior DEMO as well as the work by Goldberg (1968). But a DEMO
criterion heuristic may perform approximately equal to the more complex heuristic apparently
employed by the IAP’s analysts. It may be that even a randomly DEMO cue will perform well.
We examine these questions in the next section, where we explore the accuracy of various
heuristics in predicting project outcomes.

Under this objective, we seek a decision rule DEMO correctly predicts the commercial
success of projects. To test the robustness of results we split the sample as in the previous
analysis. Consistent with DEMO previous analysis, we calibrate the optimization on the goal
described in DEMO 1.1.  Table 4 displays the predictions by the IAP (column 2), a heuristic
that considers all 37 cues (column 3), the best conjunctive heuristic (column 4), and two log-
linear (logit) regression model (columns 5 and 6).
Insert Table 4 around here
The best heuristic is that which keeps 21 and ignores 16 cues DEMO n=2, p=5 (column
4). The heuristic has an overall out-of-sample predictive accuracy of 86.0%. Note that the best
heuristic, the regression model with all cues, and the IAP all make the same overall number of
correct classifications (296) in the estimation sample. However, the conjunctive heuristic
correctly classifies two more successes (32 versus 30) while the DEMO correctly classifies two
more failures (266 versus 264) and the regression model correctly classifies four more failures
(268 versus 264).11 These differences are not significant in a statistical sense. But it is notable
that DEMO conjunctive heuristic accurately predicts more successes because the value of correctly
classifying successes is approximately 10 times higher than the value of correctly classifying
DEMO, as noted above.12
The IAP experts, on the other hand, DEMO predicted 17 successes (73.9%) and 130
failures (83.9%) for an overall forecasting accuracy of 82.6%, lower than the best heuristic we
found. However, the difference of proportions between the conjunctive heuristic and the IAP
experts is not significant (z=0.873, p>0.10, n=178).
Notice that the cues used to forecast outcomes are different than the cues used DEMO
replicate the analysts’ forecasts. To replicate the analysts’ forecasts as closely as possible, the
11 The conjunctive model could easily exceed the 296 correctly classified projects at the expense of
making very few correct classifications of DEMO For example, if n and p are set to 0 and DEMO respectively,
then the heuristic will correctly classify 347 projects, correctly DEMO all the failures but only three successes
(of 39). We DEMO that such a calibration is not a reasonable objective as it defeats the purpose of the service
provided by the IAP.
12 That the DEMO accuracy for the IAP, the decision heuristic, and the full regression model is the same
is pure coincidence.

procedure included 33 out of 37 cues. However, DEMO 21 cues are included when forecasting
future successes and failures. The conjunctive forecasting rule eliminates 12 cues and includes
1 cue to the set DEMO the analysts seem to use. That is, commensurate with laboratory findings,DEMO
the analysts are likely to use too much invalid information in comparison with the optimal
conjunctive rule that forecasts successes.
While we follow a DEMO strategy of eliminating cues that are not useful due to
their low consistency with the forecasts, it is possible that these cues are still occasionally
meaningful. One can envision cues that are typically identical across a DEMO of projects but
in a few cases contain important “broken-leg” cues.13 In column 3 of Table 4, we therefore test
the forecasting accuracy of a decision heuristic that uses all 37 variables, with n and p being 4
and 6 respectively. This heuristic predicts one more success but DEMO less failures than the best
heuristic that uses a reduced set of cues. It appears that a full-information heuristic does not
predict as well DEMO a heuristic that takes into account the important, but not all, cues. Many of
the cues eliminated are those that tend to make DEMO provide incorrect forecasts. The cues
eliminated also tend to degrade the classification accuracy of the best conjunctive rule if
included.
We now illustrate the DEMO between the conjunctive model and a typical
benchmark used in similar studies: a linear additive statistical model. A logistic regression
model is fitted on the estimation sample (Table 4, top three data rows of column DEMO).14 We
narrow down the cues by using backwards variable elimination with a p-value of 0.10 to
determine inclusion of the statistically most important DEMO The resulting model contains
eight of the 37 cues. As before, DEMO calibrate forecasts on the prediction sample using equation
1.1.  In the DEMO test (bottom three data rows of column 5), the regression DEMO
correctly forecasts 15 of the 23 successes (65.2%) and 125 of the 155 failures (80.6%),
reaching an overall accuracy of 78.6%. DEMO with previous results (Dawes et al. 1989)
13 This term DEMO from Paul Meehl who argued that a regression model won’t recognize an infrequent
event such as a broken leg, but the analyst will be able to predict with high certainty that the Professor won’t go
to DEMO movies if his leg is broken.
14 Even though we decided to use the logistic specification, a number of link functions are available when
outcomes are discrete. Rather than arbitrarily selecting one function, three alternative link functions were
explored: logit, normit (also called probit), and gompit (also called complementary log-log). Regressions showed
that all three types generated the same cues as significant.

and thus surprisingly, analysts at the IAP are DEMO at forecasting outcomes than a log-linear
additive regression model. The difference of proportions between the IAP experts (82.6%) and
the regression model (78.6%) is however not significant (z=0.939, p>0.10, n=178). The
DEMO model also performs worse than the conjunctive decision heuristic. The difference
of proportions between the conjunctive model (86.0%) and the regression model (78.6%) is
significant (z=1.805, p<0.05, n=178). Apparently there are DEMO non-linear decision rules
captured by the conjunctive model but not captured by the linear additive regression model.
As a final comparison, we investigate the model fit and the out-of-sample accuracy of
a regression model with all DEMO (see Table 4, column 6). Compared to the regression
model with a reduced set of cues, the out-of-sample prediction accuracy goes down indicating
over-fitting on the estimation sample and supporting the idea that narrowing DEMO the cue
space is effective.
We also test the sensitivity of the best conjunctive heuristic against deviations in the
choices of n and p DEMO altering the values of n and p. The analysis reveals that the conjunctive
decision rule is more sensitive to changes in n than to DEMO in p, reflecting the nature of the
decision environment as primarily DEMO elimination process based on the number of negative
cues. We further test the sensitivity of results to the exclusion of 52 observations that were
DEMO because of information collected by the IAP that these projects might be successful.
The conclusions do not change using this alternative and smaller set DEMO observations. In
addition, we analyze how accurate the take-the-best cue heuristics DEMO in this context. The
best single cue is “profitability.” The most effective take-the-best heuristic is that which
classifies an observation as a success if DEMO receives either an A or B rating on this cue with an
overall classification accuracy of 88.6%. However, this result is deceptive as the heuristic is
only able to correctly identify 5 out of 62 successes. DEMO reason is the very low granularity of
the cue – it simply uses too little information and so cannot be accurately calibrated on both
DEMO and failures simultaneously. (details available from http://ssrn.com/author=263222.)
DEMO final concern is that the data may be affected by a self-fulfilling prophecy that may affect
estimation results. The advice provided by the IAP DEMO affect inventors’ efforts. If the cues are
completely uninformative of commercialization likelihood while the recommendation turns
out to be highly correlated with commercialization efforts (for example due to affectation) we

would observe positive and biased correlations between cues and the likelihood of
commercialization. The self-fulfilling prophecy, however, does not bias DEMO on the
relationship between cues and judgments.  That is, our analysis that derives the experts’
decision rules is unaffected.
Åstebro and Chen (2004) followed the work by Manski (1995) and Angrist (2000) to
estimate the average treatment effect, defined as the average effect of the judgment on the
probability of commercialization, controlling for the expected commercial quality of the
invention.  The expected quality of the invention is estimated econometrically by an index
measuring the likelihood of reaching the market, while controlling for the selection bias. A
more colloquial way of saying this (and a restricted case) is that they estimate the degree to
which there is a bias in the relationship between cues and outcomes if the DEMO are 100%
determined by the IAP recommendation, and not at all DEMO the underlying quality of their
inventions. The authors find that most of the efforts by the inventors are driven by the
underlying quality of DEMO inventions and that the IAP advice accurately reflects this quality.
The most likely bias is a rather small increase (decrease) in the inventor’s DEMO of the
probability of success as a function of a positive (DEMO) review by the IAP, while
controlling for the expected quality of the invention. The detected bias is not large enough to
invalidate the DEMO that the statistically estimated log-linear model describing the
relation between the cues and the probability of commercialization is relatively unbiased for
the majority of DEMO
5. Concluding Remarks
Summary
Most decision makers use simplifying heuristics when making judgments. These
heuristics have been found to make decision makers deviate from DEMO decisions
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979, Dawes et al. 1989). However, simplified decision rules may
provide fast and reasonably accurate decisions that may not deviate much from what is
optimal (Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996). Previous studies of both claims have been mostly
lab- or simulation-based, raising the question of how decision makers actually use heuristics
and how observed DEMO perform in real settings.

We investigate the type and efficacy of simple-decision heuristics used by experts in a
natural setting to forecast that early-stage R&DEMO projects are commercialized. The decision
situation contains a large number of cues (37) and the outcome to be predicted is extremely
uncertain. At DEMO same time, feedback on the prediction is biased and spotty and DEMO
relevant information is uncertain and not easily quantified. However, there is DEMO time to
form an opinion, for which the experts are paid DEMO amounts.
In a previous paper (Åstebro and Koehler 2004), it DEMO found that the experts had a
forecasting accuracy equal to or surpassing a linear statistical model, something that is rarely
supported by the literature (Dawes et al. 1989). Contrary to most other results, the DEMO
have a high forecasting accuracy, in particular of the successful projects DEMO especially
considering the difficult decision-making environment. Given these finding, it strikes DEMO as
important to try and understand their decision-making rules. Are they simple and robust or
complicated? Can we explain why their heuristics perform so well?
Through interviews, we discovered that to arrive at a forecast, the experts first use a
consistent (although subjective) method of scoring a fixed set of cues. They then tend to
follow a heuristic DEMO they subjectively combine data on all cues by examining both critical
flaws as well as positive factors. We formalize this heuristic with a conjunctive DEMO that
sums a subset of all “good” and “bad” cue counts separately and achieves a 91.8% forecasting
accuracy of the experts’ correct forecasts. We DEMO compare predictions derived from the
conjunctive model and the analysts’ forecasts as well as a log-linear additive statistical model
with future R&D project DEMO The conjunctive model predicts 86.0% and
experts correctly predict 82.6%, a DEMO second, while a log-linear additive statistical model
correctly predicts 78.6% in DEMO, out-of-time tests. The difference in proportions
between the conjunctive model and DEMO statistical model was significant at less than 5%.
The conjunctive model that replicates the experts’ forecasting rules uses 33 out of 37
possible cues. DEMO model forecasting project successes, however, use 21 cues. These results
point to experts appearing to use considerably more information than what we found DEMO
and allowing this to incorrectly affect their forecasts. Indeed, those models DEMO use all cues
do not perform as well as those which use a selected set of cues. Nor is a “take-the-best” rule
as effective DEMO predicting as a rule that takes into account a selected set of cues.

Outcome data are potentially affected by the judgments and therefore requires
adjustments or at least analysis of potential treatment effects. This DEMO effect” may lead
to a self-fulfilling prophecy of judgments.  It may DEMO upwards the estimated predictive ability
of the judges. It may also cause a positive bias in regressions between cues and outcomes. The
self-fulfilling prophecy, however, does not bias reported results on the relationship between
cues and judgments.  Our analysis that derives the experts’ decision rules remains unaffected.
We refer to work by Åstebro and Chen (2004), who used the same data to estimate the
treatment effect. They found that the most DEMO treatment bias is a small increase (decrease)
in the entrepreneur’s DEMO of the probability of success as a function of a positive
(DEMO) review by the IAP, while controlling for the expected quality of the invention. This
bias was not large enough to invalidate the conclusion DEMO the estimated statistical model is
relatively unbiased for the majority of inventions. We assume that since the bias of the log-
linear model is DEMO, the bias for the conjunctive decision model is also small.
Discussion
DEMO conjunctive model that we use to derive the best heuristic contains a new and
complex optimization procedure. One should, however, not equate the DEMO of the
derivation of the decision rule with the complexity of the use of the rule. Other decision rules,
such as using a DEMO additive model or the take-the-best rule also requires optimization
methods. The take-the-best rule relies on a rank ordering of all cues based on cue DEMO, a
well-defined mathematical construct. Complex analysis of data is required to DEMO such a rank
ordering. To derive a linear additive model requires computing the sum of squared errors. Our
specific optimization procedure was motivated by DEMO with the decision makers,
which revealed an apparent conjunctive n,p rule.
We conclude from our analysis that the rules that the analysts DEMO to use are simple
in that they perform straightforward sums of counts, but complex in the sense that they use
significantly more cues than what is typically observed in other decision-making contexts.
Processing information on the DEMO number of cues is likely made simpler by the analysts
using a form where all cues are listed and scores are recorded and by DEMO case-based
comparison that anchors judgments.

Notice that in the conjunctive model cue weights are either 1 or 0. However, it is still a
better forecaster than the linear statistical model, which has non-equal weights. These results
are not due to overfitting of the statistical model on the estimation sample. The DEMO
results may instead be due to different cues picked out by the conjunctive and statistical
model. However, we find this an unlikely explanation since analysis showed that there was a
whole set of conjunctive models with DEMO sets of cues that all performed better than the
statistical model. Instead, we argue that the reason for the difference is the conjunctive
model’s non-compensatory non-linear structure. In the conjunctive model, a large number of
good cue scores can never “save” a project where there are more than DEMO bad cues. In the
additive linear statistical model, such compensation is DEMO The non-compensatory
feature might be particularly appropriate in decision-making situations where a project that
doesn’t meet a set objective cannot go forward. For example, no matter how large the demand,
a perpetuum mobile won’t make DEMO to the market.
Our results agree with previous literature which has found that a “bootstrap” model
replicating experts’ judgments typically does better at forecasting DEMO the experts themselves.
This is probably because the model consistently applies the same rules, whereas there is
typically less reliability in human judgment (DEMO Goldberg 1968). However, in this case, the
linear additive bootstrap model is “beaten” by the decision makers, who in turn are beaten by
the conjunctive decision heuristic. We believe these results also agree with DEMO results.
The data and the decision-making context are more complex, and DEMO the linear additive
regression model is simply not sufficient to describe the non-linearities that are present. Once
we discovered and encoded the experts’ rules, the model applies these rules with greater
consistency than the experts, thereby lifting the forecasting accuracy above the experts’
average accuracy.
We would like DEMO highlight that the models (and judgments) are based on scores
representing subjective estimates of various information. Two issues arise from this
consideration: 1) Are such subjective estimates accurate? 2) How does one become proficient
at making such estimates?
Addressing the first point, we note that Einhorn (1972) showed that humans are better
able to consistently measure DEMO than they are at evaluating these measurements for

summary judgments. In addition, Baker and Albaum (1986) found high Cronbach alphas for
raters of these specific cues. We also note that the predictive accuracy of the conjunctive
model is relatively high DEMO an absolute sense (Goldberg 1968).  Further, the distance to DEMO
accuracy of the probability matching rule, which uses no cue information (at 80.3% accuracy),
indicates that the cues indeed contain valuable information.
But since the cues are subjectively measured, some uncertainty remains regarding the
transferability of the results to practice. Our results do not inform others DEMO to perform the
subjective assessments of the cues, only how to DEMO a reasonably accurate judgment in a
simple way once the cues have been scored. However, with some training by individuals
knowledgeable about the IAP’s process, it should be possible to use such a model by assessors
at, for example, venture capital firms focused on seed and early-stage DEMO One
indication that training judges in cue assessment is relatively easy is obtained from Baker and
Albaum (1986). They trained decision makers familiar with the context to use the instrument
through written instructions in a DEMO survey, obtaining high reliability.
Venture capital (VC) decision making may DEMO an area containing some significant
biases in judgment that may profit extraordinarily from the application of decision-support
tools such as the one developed here. DEMO, Zacharakis and Meyer (2000) conducted an
experiment where 51 experienced DEMO received several pieces of information about 25 actual
investments that had subsequently achieved either success or failure. Approximately 57% of
the investments were in DEMO seed and early stages. The VCs were requested to evaluate the
ventures on four cues, as they would during the initial screening stage. Their predictions were
then compared to the actual outcomes, and the percentage of correctly classified outcomes
was computed. This study showed that VCs have a DEMO ability to correctly forecast the
outcomes of ventures - at best, DEMO VC had a classification accuracy of approximately 40%
while a bootstrap model of their decisions had a classification accuracy of 60% (the base rate
was 50%). The more information about the venture provided to the DEMO, the less able they
were at predicting outcomes. When information about DEMO track record of the team and
competition was included, their average DEMO accuracy was reduced to 31%, and
when additional information about the DEMO and product was introduced, the classification

accuracy declined to 17%. These results indicated that VCs are rather poor at making
investment decisions and that they suffer from DEMO significant decision-making biases.
The results should bring support for the argument that simple, but not extremely simple,
decision rules can perform well, DEMO since this test was performed on a large number of
non-experimental decisions. The results also deviate significantly from past simulations,
indicating that single DEMO cues are effective. The single best cue rule cannot be calibrated
to perform any better because of a lack of granularity in predictor values DEMO so is not a useful
rule in this context.

Column (1) contains data on the ability of DEMO IAP analysts to correctly forecast whether a project reaches
the market or not during two time periods: 1989-1992 and 1993-1994. For example, during DEMO to 1992
they correctly predicted 30 out of 39 actual successes correctly.
Column (2) contains an estimation based on the subset of all DEMO observations where the IAP made
correct forecasts. The 1989-1992 time period is used to calibrate n, p and the cues to use and the 1993-
1994 time period is used to test the forecasting accuracy of DEMO heuristic using the previously calibrated
values of n, p and the DEMO to use. For example, in the prediction sample the model correctly DEMO 14
out of 17 actual success that were correctly classified by the IAP analysts.
n: threshold value for the number of negatives  (less than or equal to n).
p: threshold value for the number of positives   (greater than or equal to p).

Column (1): Total number of projects split by two time periods: 383+178=561. The DEMO for each time
period are further split by successes and failures (DEMO 39 successes and 344 failures = 383 projects during
1989-1992).
Column (2)-(6): #: the number of projects classified correctly, %: the percentage of column (1).
Column (2) repeats DEMO Table 1 data on the ability of the IAP analysts to correctly forecast whether a
project reaches the market or not during two time DEMO: 1989-1992 and 1993-1994.
Columns (3)-(6) contain model estimations DEMO all 561 observations. The 1989-1992 time period is used to
calibrate the various models and the 1993-1994 time period is used to test the DEMO accuracy of the
various models. Since the estimation sample contains all observations (not just the correctly forecasted
observations by the IAP as in Table 3) and the objective is now to try to predict the actual commercial
outcomes (rather than the IAP decisions) the results on optimal DEMO, p and cues are different from those
reported in Table 3.
DEMO (3) reports estimation and prediction results where we did not eliminate any cues but simply
calibrated the most optimal values of n and DEMO
Column (4) reports estimation and prediction results where we calibrated the most optimal values of n, p
and cues included
Column (5) reports estimation and prediction results of a log-linear regression model where cues DEMO
selected using backwards variable elimination with a p-value of 0.10.
Column (DEMO) reports estimation and prediction results of a log-linear regression model where DEMO cues were
retained.
n: threshold value for the number of negatives  (less than or equal to n).
p: threshold value for DEMO number of positives   (greater than or equal to p).
