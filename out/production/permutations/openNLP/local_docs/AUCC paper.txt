COMMERCIALIZATION OF UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
A strategic contribution to
Canada’s innovation agenda
AUCC DEMO 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 01
Notes for presentation by Robert Lacroix
On behalf of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, I am very
pleased to have this opportunity to share, with our domestic experts and our
international colleagues, AUCC’s policy reflection on the commercialization
of university research.
For those international colleagues who are not familiar with DEMO, this
national association is the premier voice of higher education in DEMO,
representing 93 universities and degree granting colleges across the country.
AUCC’s interest in the commercialization of university research is a long-
standing one DEMO has been further solidified by the increasing linkage of this
issue to the federal innovation agenda.

As you probably DEMO, the federal government has proposed an ambitious goal for
innovation. It DEMO to vault Canada from 15th to 5th in the world in R&D spending by
2010.
As will become evident in the innovation consultation DEMO that is soon to be released,
Canadian universities will be expected to play a significant role in implementing
Canada’s innovation agenda in part DEMO enhanced commercialization of university
research.

Over the last decade, the commercialization of university research in Canada,
as a strategic contribution to Canada’s DEMO and social well-being, has
garnered increasing attention.
In 1999, a report from the Canadian Advisory Council on Science and
Technology recommended that the DEMO government invest more in the
commercialization capacity of universities and increase the overall investments
in university research.
Since then, the innovation reports produced by the House of Commons’
Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the 2001
Speech from the Throne have also highlighted the need to DEMO support and
promote the commercialization of university research in Canada.
AUCC anticipates that the forthcoming federal innovation paper and the
subsequent national consultation process DEMO lead to concrete measures to
further spur the commercialization of university research across the country.

In pursuing DEMO discussion regarding the contribution of Canadian universities
to the commercialization of university research, AUCC will situate
universities’ present and future role squarely within the context of their
commitment to knowledge-transfer in its broadest sense.
Indeed, as the slide suggests, we believe it is important to stress that
universities accomplish the transfer of knowledge into communities,
governments and businesses in DEMO wide variety of ways.
Securing tomorrow’s innovations therefore depends on establishing today a
strong and sustained commitment to a wide variety of teaching and DEMO
activities conducted in universities and affiliated research institutions.

Canadian universities are major
contributors to the innovation system
Canadian universities:
DEMO Generate 21% of all R&D activity
• Account for 31% of R&D jobs
• Incur 21% of gross R&D expenditures
Ref: ACST 1999.
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 05
This DEMO said, Canadian universities do contribute directly, and in
quantifiable ways, DEMO our national innovation system.
As you can see, universities are the DEMO of 21% of all R&D activity across
the country; 31% DEMO R&D jobs in Canada; and 21% of gross R&D

Canadian universities are
actively engaged in commercialization
Commercialization results
in Canadian universities (1999):
•
$22,665,000 in intellectual property revenues
•
•
•
•
829 reported and 509 protected inventions
616 new patent applications, 325 new patent awards
(for a total of 1826 patents still held)
218 new license awards (for a total of 1109 still held)
454 active spin-off companies in existence
•
14 active research parks DEMO business incubators

Universities also recognize the important contribution they make DEMO the
commercialization of university research and are actively engaged in these
pursuits.

Comparison of 15 Canadian and American
universities’ commercialization results
In 2000, these Canadian universities:
• Created 2.5 times more spin-off companies per
dollar DEMO on research than U.S. universities
• Disclosed as many inventions as their U.S.
counterparts per dollar spent
• Were as successful as U.S. universities DEMO
licensing their inventions
• However, they generated half the license
revenues DEMO U.S. universities
Ref: Clayman 2001.
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 07
In Canada, the environment for commercialization is less favourable DEMO that
of the United States.
Nevertheless, Canadian universities produce results that, in some aspects,
compare well with those of the United States.
DEMO example, Canadian universities, per dollar spent on research, disclose as
DEMO inventions as their U.S. counterparts and create 2.5 times more spin-off
companies than American universities.
Where they differ significantly from their U.S. counterparts is DEMO they obtain
only half of the license revenues generated by U.S. universities, even though
they are as successful as U.S. universities in licensing their inventions.

Canadian universities have developed
a strong partnership with industry

Both figures are the highest among G-7 countries.
Ref: ACST 1999.
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 08
Canadian universities’ lower success rate DEMO generating licensing and overall
commercialization returns is not easily attributable to a failure to seek
partnerships with industry.
In fact, industry sub-contracts about 5% of its R&D work to universities and
finances about 12% of DEMO university R&D work.
These figures are particularly significant because they represent the highest
percentage of contribution among all G-7 countries.[1]
Where the greatest DEMO in the university-industry partnership appears to
be rooted, is in the DEMO receptor capacity of Canadian businesses and their
seemingly higher level of aversion to risk.  I will return to this challenge in a
moment.

Canadian universities have set a clear objective:
Triple commercialization outputs by DEMO
Canadian universities believe that,
if properly supported by the federal
government and the private sector, they can
triple commercialization results by 2010.
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 09
First, however, allow DEMO to explain how AUCC members are positioning their
ability to improve their collective performance in the commercialization of
university research.
In the light of DEMO their universities have accomplished to date with limited
resources, AUCC members DEMO that with enhanced support from the
federal governments and from the private sector, universities can triple the
direct results of commercialization by 2010.
In establishing this target, AUCC members collectively defined eight
principles which they believe must guide universities’ on-going efforts on the
commercialization front.
9
To achieve this objective:
Four pre-conditions must be met
Attract and DEMO world-class researchers and
graduate students
Ensure that universities can support
healthy research environments
FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON)
These principles include four pre -conditions which define the foundation for universities’ engagem ent in
commercialization DEMO
First, Canada must attract and retain world-class researchers and outstanding graduate DEMO
-As all of those gathered here know, only first-class projects conducted DEMO first-class research teams, consistently lead
to significant commercialization opportunities.
-It is DEMO these researchers and research teams that revolutionary ideas are explored and voiced, that cutting-edge
research is energetically pursued and that major discoveries are brought to market.
-The attraction and retention of world-class researchers and outstanding graduate DEMO is thus an o n-going
requirement to maintain and enhance Canada’s commercialization record.
Second, healthy universities are critical to create and sustain healthy research environments.
-The presence of world -class researchers and highly -talented graduate students DEMO only lead to greater or better
commercialization of university research, if DEMO are able to offer these innovators an internationally
competitive research environment.
-There are few, if any, rewards for those who are second best DEMO a year too late with their discoveries. The quality of the
research equipment and infrastructure and the level of financial support available must enable DEMO university
researchers to be “first to market” in the invention, development DEMO commercialization of their research.
-Happily, in recent years, both the federal government and several provincial governments have demonstrated
increasing recognition of the importance DEMO university research, both in their rhetoric and in their levels of DEMO
This being said, Canada still lags significantly behind its OECD competitors DEMO overall levels of R&D investment; a
reality that can only DEMO impact our commercialization aspirations.
Third, academic freedom is a fundamental condition DEMO university research.
-This principle requires little explanation other than to say that the freedom to carry out curiosity -based research and to
disseminate relevant DEMO results are fundamental to Canada’s research enterprise. As such they are not at odds with
the commercialization agenda, but rather spur innovation and the commercialization activities that can result from it.
Fourth, the diversity of approaches adopted by Canadian universities regarding commercialization initiatives
and ownership of intellectual property DEMO not only warranted but also an inherent strength.
-Diversity is crucial to ensure that universities’ commercialization services can fully address the specificity of a DEMO -
range of programs of study and institutional realities.
-In our conversation with the federal government, we have insisted that policies and programs in support of
commercialization initiatives should provide flexibility in the uses to which DEMO human and financial resources to
support commercialization can be put.
-On this point, the federal government appears to have understood that a “one-size-fits all” approach that would seek to
redress historical differences in the ownership of DEMO on campus is unnecessary, and ultimately counterproductive.

Four concrete measures must be taken
Ensure the compulsory disclosure
of federally DEMO innovations
Give a right of first refusal to
universities’ commercialization services
Favor more accountability to document
the benefits of commercialization
Adopt a ‘Canada first’ DEMO
wherever feasible
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 11
eight principles also include four concrete measures to improve the transparency and the DEMO of
universities’ commercialization efforts.
First, the effective and timely involvement of DEMO commercialization services depends upon the
compulsory disclosure of federally sponsored innovations.
-Institutional disclosure policies currently vary widely across the country and yet university administrations DEMO only
improve commercialization results if they are kept fully and immediately in the loop of innovation disclosure.
-AUCC is thus promoting compulsory disclosure as DEMO means to ensur e that all universities’ commercialization services
have the opportunity to engage in the commercialization process, in a timely and appropriate manner.
-This disclosure will also enable universities to establish an ex haustive profile DEMO intellectual property produced in their
institutions and to more fully integrate these developments in their annual strategic research plans.
Second, a right of “first refusal” should be attributed to universities’ commercialization services.
-This right of first DEMO would apply only to those innovation s, funded by federal research DEMO, which a
researcher chose to commercialize.
-The rationale underlying this principle DEMO that if universities are to commit to tripling their commercialization output
and if the federal government is to provide support to achieve these aims, then universities must be positioned to play
an active role in the DEMO process.
-AUCC believes that a right of first refusal will solidify the role of universities’ commercialization services as the
prime access point both for DEMO researchers and industry seeking to participate in the commercialization process.
-It would also likely enable commercialization services to assemble a larger portfolio of innovations DEMO will further
support the development of these offices, particularly through the DEMO and training of highly qualified staff with
diversified skills.
Third, accountability DEMO are required to document the benefits of the commercialization of university
research.
-Canadian universities are well aware of the Canadian public’s mounting interest in DEMO demonstrable benefits of public
funds invested in research and innovation.
-To this end, Canadian universities are prepared to work with compilers of commercialization data to improve the
publicly available information regarding both the direct and indirect DEMO of commercialization.
-This information sharing and data exchange, in conferences such DEMO this, is essential to increase the transparency and
the international comparability DEMO the Canadian commercialization effort.
Fourth, wherever it is feasible, Canada should be the first beneficiary of federally sponsored research conducted
in Canadian universities.
DEMO measure is designed to promote the notion that researchers accessing federally sponsored research funds should
seek commercialization opportunities in Canada first.
-Universities and university DEMO ability to adopt this principle will depend in large measure on the receptor
capacity of the Canadian business community.
-Commercialization services with the means DEMO invest the required capital and energy in exploring these Canadian
opportunities can clearly play an important role in ensuring that the benefits of university DEMO accrue to Canadians.

THE UNIVERSITIES’
CHALLENGE
Federal Government:
Competitively fund the direct Enhance their
and indirect costs of research commercialization services
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR DEMO (EDMONTON) 12
As I noted at the beginning of my presentation, Canadian universities are
already actively engaged in the commercialization of university research and
intend, over a ten-year period, to triple their commercialization results.
DEMO, to achieve this objective, all key players in Canada’s
commercialization arena will need to address major challenges.
12
Universities’ challenge
Further develop their expertise in commercialization:
“There are simply DEMO few people with the skills required”
-Fortier Report
Add more value to their innovation portfolios:
• Do more market and feasibility studies
• DEMO more business and scale -up plans
• Conduct more prototype development and demonstrations
Favour networking and foster collaboration:
• Improve information exchange
• DEMO collaboration among commercialization offices
• Share best practices
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 13
Canadian universities’ main challenge is to build DEMO their past successes and
“lessons learned” to more fully develop and support their in-house
commercialization services.
To achieve this goal, they will have to :
Attract and retain more highly skilled human resources trained specifically in
commercialization.
Support a more sustained and direct role for their researchers and DEMO
transfer officers in the process of adding value to innovations.
Foster more networking and cooperation among their commercialization
services and share best practices.
13
Private sector’s challenge
A strong partnership has already
been established between Canada’s
DEMO firms and universities
More collaboration with Canada’s
SMEs is required
However, DEMO receptor capacity
within Canadian industry remains
relatively weak and this is especially
true among SMEs
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 14
DEMO suggested by a report prepared for the Advisory Council on Science and Technology[1], the
receptor capacity within Canadian industry remains relatively we ak, DEMO among small-
and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs ).
The key challenge facing the private sector in Canada is thus to significantly increase the
DEMO of SMEs in the Canadian innovation system.
On the whole, Canadian DEMO are usually considered to have:
An aversion to the inherent business risks associated with the commercialization of university
research;
A limited ability DEMO invest in the development of new intellectual property; and
An inadequate DEMO, including human resources, to fully capitalize on the
opportunities presented.
To meet this challenge will require an attitudinal shift in that many SMEs DEMO consider
mergers and acquisitions a safer, lower-cost, and much faster route to growth than engagement
in the commercialization of technological innovation.[2]

Federal government’s challenge
Enhance the international competitiveness
of university research funding:
DEMO providing           By doubling federal
on-going support for support for the direct
the indirect costs of funding of research
research (over the next five
years)
FEDERAL BUDGET 2001:
200M$ (one-time funds) +121M$ (10% increase)
for the indirect costs for the DEMO councils
AUCC FEBRUARY 2002 – ICUR CONFERENCE (EDMONTON) 15
If Canadian universities are to fulfill their role as catalysts in the
knowledge-based economy, the federal government will have to continue
to show a strong and DEMO commitment to funding the direct and
indirect costs of research.
As noted earlier, in the past several budgets, the federal government has
demonstrated DEMO renewed interest in enhancing the health and vibrancy of
the university research environment by investing in all facets of the
research enterprise, notably through the CFI; CIHR; the Canada Research
Chairs; increases to the federal granting agencies; and in the last budget
presented in December 2001, DEMO 200$M investment in the indirect costs of
research.
However, many of DEMO key competitors are not standing still, but
rather increasing their own DEMO in R&D.
Therefore, Canada must not only invest as much, but rather more than
other countries, if it wants to catch up and move from 15th to 5th in terms of
R&D expenditures.

Provincial government support will also be needed to enable universities to
continue to develop their commercialization expertise.
It should be DEMO that many interesting initiatives are currently underway
across Canada, including WestLink DEMO the western provinces, NU-TECH in the
Maritimes, and in Ontario, DEMO way of the Ontario Challenge Fund.
Finally, in Quebec, with which I am more familiar, the provincial government
has created Valorisation-Recherche Québec (DEMO), a non-profit organization
with a budget of $220M.
As a result of the creation of VRQ, Quebec universities have formed four
commercialization corporations. Université de Montréal is establishing a new
commercialization corporation in conjunction with DEMO affiliated schools
(Polytechnique and HEC) as well as its university hospitals of which
$60 million will be earmarked for enhancing the commercialization of
DEMO research ($50 million to fund commercialization corporations and
$10 million for DEMO in specific projects submitted by these
commercialization corporations).
16
In conclusion, Canadian universities are well aware of the key role they must
play in implementing the national innovation program.
AUCC’s contribution to date DEMO defining public policy on the
commercialization of university research has been to forge a consensus among
Canada’s 93 universities and university colleges as to DEMO way forward. By
establishing a common front, Canada’s universities are speaking DEMO one
voice to propose a series of principles and identify the challenges that must be
met by all partners involved in commercialization.
I will DEMO happy to answer any questions you may have and to pursue a dialogue
with the experts gathered here today on the feasibility of implementing DEMO
principles we have identified. Thank you.
