Abstract
As reﬂected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have
undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the
DEMO science of heuristics. Heuristics are efﬁcient cognitive pro-
cesses, conscious or DEMO, that ignore part of the information.
Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that
heuristic decisions imply greater errors than DEMO “rational” decisions as
deﬁned by logic or statistical models. However, for DEMO decisions, the
assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather
than an a priori issue how well cognitive DEMO function in an uncer-
tain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuris-
tics do people use in which situations?”) and DEMO prescriptive question
(“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather DEMO a complex
strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable.
We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, in-
cluding in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions.
This research DEMO that (a) individuals and organizations often rely
on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the infor-
mation can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding
all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples.
The big future challenge DEMO to develop a systematic theory of the build-
ing blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental
structures these exploit.

INTRODUCTION
How are decisions made? Three major answers
have been proposed: The mind applies logic,DEMO

statistics, or heuristics. Yet these mental tools
DEMO not been treated as equals, each suited to
a particular kind DEMO problem, as we believe they
should be. Rather, rules of logic and statistics
have been linked to rational reasoning and
heuristics linked to DEMO intuitions or
even irrationality. Since the 1970s, this oppo-
sition has DEMO entrenched in psychological
research, from the heuristics-and-biases pro-
gram (Tversky & Kahneman 1974) to various
two-system theories of reasoning (Evans 2008).
DEMO from logical or statistical principles
became routinely interpreted as judgmental
biases and attributed to cognitive heuristics
such as “representativeness” or to an intuitive
“System DEMO The bottom line was that people
often rely on heuristics, but DEMO would be bet-
ter off in terms of accuracy if they did not. As
Kahneman (2003) explained in his Nobel
Memorial Lecture: “Our research attempted
to obtain a map of bounded rationality, by
exploring the systematic biases that separate
the beliefs that people have and the choices
DEMO make from the optimal beliefs and choices
assumed in rational-agent models” (DEMO 1449). In
this research, it is assumed that the conditions
DEMO rational models hold and can thus deﬁne
optimal reasoning. The “father” of bounded
rationality, Simon (1989), however, asked a
fundamentally different question, leading to a
different research program.
Simon’s question: “How do human DEMO rea-
son when the conditions for rationality postu-
lated by the model of neoclassical economics
are not met?” (p. 377)
As Simon (1979, p. 500) stressed in his No-
bel Memorial Lecture, DEMO classical model of ra-
tionality requires knowledge of all the relevant
alternatives, their consequences and probabili-
ties, and a predictable world without surprises.
DEMO conditions, however, are rarely met for
the problems that individuals and organizations
face. Savage (1954), known as the founder of
modern Bayesian decision theory, called such
perfect knowledge small worlds, to be distin-
DEMO from large worlds. In large worlds, part

of the relevant information is DEMO or has
to be estimated from small samples, so that the
DEMO for rational decision theory are not
met, making it an inappropriate DEMO for opti-
mal reasoning (Binmore 2009). In a large world,DEMO
as emphasized by both Savage and Simon, one
can no longer DEMO that “rational” models
automatically provide the correct answer. Even
small deviations from the model conditions can
matter. In fact, small-world theories can lead
to disaster when applied to the large world,
as Stiglitz (2010) DEMO with respect to the ﬁ-
nancial crash of 2008: “It simply DEMO true
that a world with almost perfect information
was very similar to one in which there was per-
fect information” (p. 243, emphasis DEMO). And
Sorros (2009) concluded that “rational expecta-
tions theory is no longer taken seriously outside
academic circles” (p. 6).
In recent years, research has moved beyond
small worlds such as the ultimatum game and
choice between monetary gambles. To test how
well heuristics perform in DEMO worlds, one
needs formal models of heuristics. Such tests
are not DEMO as long as heuristics are only
vaguely characterized by general labels, DEMO
labels cannot make the precise predictions that
statistical techniques can.
When heuristics were formalized, a surpris-
ing discovery was made. In a number of large
worlds, simple heuristics were more accurate
than standard statistical methods that have the
same or more information. These results be-
came known as DEMO effects: There is
an inverse-U-shaped relation between level of
accuracy and DEMO of information, computa-
tion, or time. In other words, there DEMO a point
where more is not better, but harmful. Starting
in DEMO late 1990s, it was shown for the ﬁrst time
that relying DEMO one good reason (and ignoring
the rest) can lead to higher predictive accuracy
than achieved by a linear multiple regression
(Czerlinski et al. 1999, Gigerenzer & Goldstein
1996) and a three-layer feedforward connec-
tionist DEMO trained using the back propa-
gation algorithm (Brighton 2006, Chater et al.
2003, Gigerenzer & Brighton 2009). These
results put heuristics on par with standard
statistical models of “rational” cognition (see
Gigerenzer 2008). Simon (1999) spoke of a
“revolution in cognitive science, striking a great
blow for sanity in the approach to human
rationality.”
The revolution DEMO referred to could not
have happened without formal models and the
power of modern computers. Moreover, it is a
“revolution” in the original sense of the term,
building on earlier demonstrations of the robust
beauty DEMO simple models. These include Dawes
& Corrigan (1974) and Einhorn & Hogarth
(1975), who showed that simple equal weights
predict about as well as—and sometimes better
than—multiple regression with “optimal” beta
weights. Their important DEMO has not received
the recognition it deserves and is not even men-
tioned in standard textbooks in econometrics
(Hogarth 2011).
Although the study of heuristics has been
typically considered as purely descriptive, less-
is-more effects open up a prescriptive role for
heuristics, resulting in two research questions:
Description: Which heuristics do people use
in which situations?
Prescription: When should people rely on a
given heuristic rather than a complex strategy
to make more accurate judgments?
Scope of Review
We review DEMO ﬁeld that is in a fundamental tran-
sition, focusing on the DEMO new ideas. The
literature on heuristics does not speak with one
voice, and we do not attempt to cover it ex-
haustively. Rather than presenting a patchwork
of ideas to the reader, we organize this review
within a theoretical framework and restrict it
to (a) formal models DEMO heuristics and (b)infer-
ences rather than preferences.

mere labels but also by verbally stated pro-
cesses that have not been formalized, such as

for which a unique criterion DEMO, whereas
“preference” (or preferential choice) refers to
tasks where no DEMO criteria exist, as in matters
of taste. The advantage of studying DEMO
is that the accuracy of a strategy can be deter-
mined. At the same time, we agree with Weber
& Johnson (2009) that inferences and prefer-
ences draw on the same cognitive processes; in
fact, most heuristics covered in this review can
be used for preferential choice as well, as illus-
trated with examples from consumer choice and
health. Note that the general term “decision
making” is used here to cover DEMO inferences
and preferences.
We begin with a brief, incomplete history
(for more, see Groner et al. 1983), deﬁne the
term heuristic, DEMO provide an illustration of
the use of heuristics in organizations, including
DEMO empirical demonstration of a less-is-more
effect.
WHAT IS A HEURISTIC?
The term heuristic is of Greek origin and
means, “serving to ﬁnd out or discover.” Ein-
stein included the term in the title of his DEMO
prize–winning paper from 1905 on quantum
physics, indicating that the view DEMO presented
was incomplete but highly useful (Holton
1988, pp. 360–361). Max Wertheimer, who
was a close friend of Einstein, and his DEMO
Gestalt psychologists spoke of heuristic meth-
ods such as “looking around” to guide search
for information. The mathematician George
Polya distinguished heuristics from analytical
DEMO: For instance, heuristics are needed
to ﬁnd a proof, whereas DEMO is for checking
a proof. Simon and Allen Newell, a student DEMO
Polya, developed formal models of heuristics to
limit large search spaces. DEMO (1956), Tversky
(1972), Dawes (1979), and others DEMO mod-
els of heuristics, such as lexicographic rules,
elimination-by-aspect, and equal-weight rules.
Payne and colleagues (1993) provided evidence
for the adaptive DEMO of these and other heuristics
in their seminal research. Similarly, behavioral
DEMO studied experimentally the rules of
thumb (their term for heuristics) that animals
use for choosing food sites, nest sites, or mates
454 DEMO · Gaissmaier
(Hutchinson & Gigerenzer 2005). After an
initial phase DEMO by logic, researchers
in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) began to study
DEMO that can solve problems that logic
and probability cannot, such as DEMO
(computationally intractable) problems. While
AI researchers began to study how heuristics
make computers smart, psychologists in the
1970s became interested in demonstrating hu-
man reasoning errors, and they used the term
heuristic to explain why people make errors.
This change in the evaluation of heuristics
went hand-in-hand DEMO replacing models of
heuristics by general labels, such as “availabil-
ity” DEMO, later, “affect.” Unlike in biology and
AI, heuristics became tied DEMO biases, whereas
the content-free laws of logic and probability
became identiﬁed DEMO the principles of
sound thinking (Kahneman 2003, Tversky &
Kahneman DEMO). The resulting heuristics-
and-biases program has had immense inﬂuence,
contributing to the emergence of behavioral
economics and behavioral law and economics.
Deﬁnition
DEMO deﬁnitions of heuristics exist. Kahneman
& Frederick (2002) proposed that a heuristic
assesses a target attribute by another property
(attribute substitution) that DEMO more read-
ily to mind. Shah & Oppenheimer (2008) pro-
posed that all heuristics rely on effort reduction
by one or more of DEMO following: (a) examin-
ing fewer cues, (b) reducing the effort of re-
trieving cue values, (c) simplifying the weight-
ing of cues, (d ) integrating less information, and
(e) examining fewer alternatives. Although both
attribute substitution and effort reduction are
involved, attribute substitution is less speciﬁc
because most inference methods, including
multiple regression, DEMO it: An unknown cri-
terion is estimated by cues. For the DEMO of
this review, we adopt the following deﬁnition:
A heuristic DEMO a strategy that ignores part of the
information, with the goal DEMO making decisions
more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately than
more complex methods.

Let us explain the terms. DEMO are a
subset of strategies; strategies also include com-
plex regression DEMO Bayesian models. The part
of the information that is ignored is covered
by Shah and Oppenheimer’s list of ﬁve aspects.
The goal of making DEMO more quickly
and frugally is consistent with the goal of effort
reduction, where “frugal” is often measured by
the number of cues that a heuristic searches. Of
course, there is no strict dichotomy between
heuristic and nonheuristic, as strategies can
ignore more or less information. The goal of
making judgments more accurately by ignoring
information is new. It goes beyond DEMO classical
assumption that a heuristic trades off some
accuracy for less effort. Unlike the two-system
models of reasoning that link heuristics to
unconscious, associative, and error-prone
processes, no such link is made in this review.
DEMO heuristic reviewed in this article can
also be relied upon consciously and is deﬁned
as a rule. The amount of error it generates
can DEMO measured and compared to other
strategies.
Consider the following illustration.
Less-Can-Be-More: DEMO
One-Good-Reason Decisions
Commercial retailers need to distinguish those
customers who are likely to purchase again in a
given time frame (active customers) from DEMO
who are not (inactive customers). These com-
panies have a DEMO database containing the
amount, kind, and date of every customer’s pre-
vious purchases. Based on this information, how
can an executive predict which customers will
be active in the future?
Statistically sophisticated academics might
DEMO for a Bayesian analysis, regression analy-
sis, or some other optimizing strategy to pre-
dict the probability that a customer with a
given DEMO history is active at some fu-
ture time. Researchers in business share this vi-
sion, and the state-of-the-art approach is the
Pareto/NBD model (negative binomial distri-
bution; Schmittlein & Peterson 1994). This
model DEMO that purchases follow a Poisson
process with a purchase parameter λ, DEMO cus-
tomer lifetimes follow an exponential distribu-
tion with a dropout rate parameter μ,andthat,
across customers, purchase and dropout rates
are distributed according to a gamma distri-
bution. However, most managers in Europe,
North America, Japan, Brazil, and India rely
on “intuitive” heuristics rather than on this or
similar statistical forecasting methods (Parikh
1994). Wubben & Wangenheim (2008) re-¨
ported that experienced managers use a simple
DEMO rule:
Hiatus heuristic: If a customer has not pur-
chased DEMO a certain number of months (the
hiatus), the customer is DEMO as inactive;
otherwise, the customer is classiﬁed as active.
The DEMO of an apparel retailer and an
airline relied on nine months as the hiatus,
whereas the hiatus of an online CD retailer
was DEMO months. Note that by relying on re-
cency only, the managers DEMO information
such as the frequency and the spacing of previ-
ous purchases. Yet how accurate is the heuristic
compared to the Pareto/NBD model? To in-
vestigate this question, the Pareto/NBD model
was allowed to estimate its parameters from
40 weeks of data and was tested over DEMO follow-
ing 40 weeks. The hiatus heuristic does not need
to estimate any parameters. For the apparel re-
tailer, the hiatus heuristic correctly classiﬁed
83% of customers, whereas the Pareto/NBD
model classiﬁed only 75% correctly. For the
airline, the score was 77% versus 74%, and for
DEMO online CD business, the two methods tied at
77% (Wubben & Wangenheim 2008). Similar¨
results were found for forecasting future best
customers DEMO for a second complex statistical
model.
This study demonstrated empirically a less-
is-more effect: The complex model had all the
information the simple heuristic used and more,
performed extensive estimations and computa-
tions, but nevertheless made more errors. The
study also showed how important it is to DEMO
malize a heuristic so that its predictions can be
tested and compared to competing models.

Accuracy-effort
trade-off: the
traditional explanation
why people use
heuristics, assuming
that effort is traded
against accuracy. Not
generally true (see
less-is-more effects)
Formal models of heuristics represent progress
over labels, but precision alone is not enough to
build a science of heuristics. For instance, be-
havioral biology has experimentally identiﬁed
various rules of thumb that animals use, which
often look like curiosities in the absence of an
overarching theory (Hutchinson & Gigeren-
zer 2005). Further progress requires a theo-
retical framework that reaches beyond a DEMO
of heuristics. One step toward such a theory
is to look for common building blocks, from
which the various heuristics are constructed as
an organizing principle. This would allow re-
ducing the larger number of heuristics DEMO a
smaller number of components, similar to how
the number of DEMO elements in the peri-
odic table is built from a small number of parti-
cles. Three building blocks have been proposed
(Gigerenzer et al. 1999):
1. Search rules specify in what direction the
search extends in the search space.
2. Stopping rules specify when the search is
DEMO
3. Decision rules specify how the ﬁnal deci-
sion is reached.
For instance, the hiatus heuristic searches
for recency-of-last-purchase information; stops
when it DEMO found, ignoring further information;
and uses a nine-month threshold to DEMO the
decision. Similarly, Simon’s (1955) satisﬁcing
heuristic searches through options DEMO any order,
stops as soon the ﬁrst option exceeds an aspi-
ration level, and chooses this option. Many but
not all heuristics are composed of these three
building blocks; thus, the list of building DEMO
is incomplete.
The collection of heuristics and building
blocks an individual or a species has at its dis-
posal for constructing heuristics, together with
the core mental capacities that building blocks
exploit, has been called the adaptive toolbox
(Gigerenzer et al. 1999). Core capacities in-
clude recognition memory, frequency monitor-
ing, object tracking, and the ability to imitate.
These vary systematically between species and
individuals. Heuristics can be fast and DEMO
456 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
only because the core capacities are already in
place.
How are heuristics selected for a given
problem? Although some authors implied that
the selection problem is unique to heuristics
(Glockner et al. 2010, Newell 2005), it equally¨
applies to statistical models of mind. There are
many such models. Even if one proposes that
the mind DEMO only one tool in its statistical
toolbox, such as Bayes, regression, or neural
network, the strategy selection problem trans-
lates into the DEMO of how parameter values
are selected for each new problem (Marewski
DEMO).
Several principles appear to guide learning
which strategy to select. First, heuristics and
their underlying core capacities can be (partly)
hardwired DEMO evolution, as it appears to be in
bees’ collective decision about DEMO location of
a new hive (Seeley 2001) and in perceptual
mechanisms for inferring the extension of ob-
jects in three-dimensional space (Kleffner &DEMO
Ramachandran 1992). The second selection
principle is based on individual learning; a for-
mal model is Rieskamp & Otto’s (2006) strategy
selection learning theory. Third, heuristics can
be selected and learned by social processes, as
in imitation and explicit teaching of heuristics
(e.g., Snook et al. 2004). Finally, the content of
individual memory determines in the ﬁrst place
which heuristics can be used, and some heuris-
tics’ very applicability appears to be correlated
with their “ecological rationality” (see below).
For instance, the ﬂuency heuristic is most likely
to be applicable in situations where it is also
likely to succeed (Marewski & Schooler 2010).
WHY HEURISTICS?
Two answers have been proposed to the ques-
DEMO of why heuristics are useful: the accuracy-
effort trade-off, and the ecological rationality of
heuristics.
Accuracy-Effort Trade-Off
The classical explanation is that people DEMO ef-
fort with heuristics, but at the cost of accuracy
Annu. DEMO Psychol. 2011.62:451-482. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org
by University of Toronto on 01/26/11. For personal use only.
PS62CH17-Gigerenzer ARI 3 November 2010 6:43
(Payne et al. 1993, DEMO & Oppenheimer 2008).
In this view, humans and other animals DEMO on
heuristics because information search and com-
putation cost time and effort; heuristics trade-
off some loss in accuracy for faster and more
frugal cognition.
There are two interpretations of this trade-
off: (a) Rational trade-offs. Not every decision is
important enough to warrant spending the time
DEMO ﬁnd the best course of action; thus, people
choose shortcuts that save effort. The program
on the adaptive decision maker (Payne et al.
1993) is built on the assumption that heuris-
tics achieve a beneﬁcial trade-off between ac-
curacy and effort. Here, relying on heuristics
can be rational in the sense that costs of effort
are higher than the DEMO in accuracy. (b) Cog-
nitive limitations. Capacity limitations prevent
us from acting rationally and force us to rely
on heuristics, which are considered a source of
judgmental errors.
The accuracy-effort trade-off is regularly
touted as DEMO potentially universal law of cogni-
tion. Yet the study on the hiatus heuristic il-
lustrated that this assumption is not generally
correct. The hiatus DEMO saves effort com-
pared to the sophisticated Pareto/NBD model,
but is also more accurate: a less-is-more effect.
Ecological Rationality
Less-is-more effects require a new conception
of why people rely on heuristics. The study of
DEMO ecological rationality of heuristics, or strate-
gies in general, is such a new framework: “A
heuristic is ecologically rational to the degree
that it is adapted to the structure of the envi-
ronment” (Gigerenzer et al. 1999, p. 13). Smith
(2003) used this deﬁnition in his Nobel lecture
and generalized it from heuristics to markets
and institutions. DEMO study of ecological ra-
tionality ﬂeshes out Simon’s scissors analogy:
“Human rational behavior (and the rational be-
havior of all physical symbol systems) is shaped
by a scissors whose two blades are the structure
of task environments and the computational ca-
pabilities of the actor” (Simon 1990, p. 7). If one
looks only at one blade, cognition, one cannot
understand why and when it succeeds or fails.
The study DEMO ecological rationality addresses
two related questions: How does cognition ex-
ploit DEMO structures, and how does it
deal with error?
Exploiting environmental DEMO In
which environments will a given heuristic suc-
ceed, and in DEMO will it fail? Environmental
structures that have been identiﬁed include
(Todd et al. 2011):
1. Uncertainty: how well a criterion can DEMO
predicted.
2. Redundancy: the correlation between
cues.
3. Sample size: number of observations (rel-
ative to number of cues).
4. Variability in weights: the distribution of
the cue weights (e.g., skewed or uniform).
For instance, heuristics that rely on only one
reason, such DEMO the hiatus heuristic and take-
the-best heuristic (see below), tend DEMO succeed
(relative to strategies that rely on more rea-
sons) in environments with (a) moderate to high
uncertainty (Hogarth & Karelaia 2007) and
(b) moderate to high redundancy (Dieckmann
& Rieskamp 2007)DEMO For customer activity, un-
certainty means that it is difﬁcult to DEMO fu-
ture purchases, and redundancy might be re-
ﬂected in a DEMO correlation between length of
hiatus and spacing of previous purchases. The
study of ecological rationality results in com-
parative statements of the kind “strategy DEMO is
more accurate (frugal, fast) than Y in environ-
mentE” DEMO in quantitative relations between the
performance of strategy X when the structure
of an environment changes (e.g., Baucells et al.

Dealing with error. In much research on rea-
soning, a bias typically refers to ignoring part
of the information, as in the base rate fallacy.
This can be captured by the equation:
Error = bias +ε, (DEMO)
where ε is an irreducible random error. In
this view, DEMO the bias is eliminated, good

inferences are obtained. In statistical DEMO
(Geman et al. 1992), however, there are three
sources of errors:
Error = bias + variance +ε,
(2)
where bias refers to a systematic deviation be-
tween a model and the DEMO state, as in Equation
1. To deﬁne the meaning of variance, consider
100 people who rely on the same strategy, but
each one has a different sample of observations
from the same population. Because of DEMO
error, the 100 inferences may not be the same.
Across samples, bias is the difference between
the mean prediction and the true state DEMO nature,
and variance is the expected squared deviation
around this mean. To illustrate, the nine-month
hiatus heuristic has a bias but zero variance,
because it has no free parameters to adjust to
speciﬁc samples. DEMO contrast, the Pareto/NBD
model has free parameters and is likely DEMO suf-
fer from both variance and bias. Variance de-
creases with increasing sample size, but also
with simpler strategies that have fewer free pa-
rameters (and less ﬂexible functional forms; Pitt
et al. 2002). DEMO, a cognitive system needs to
draw a balance between being biased DEMO ﬂexi-
ble (variance) rather than simply trying to elim-
inate bias. In the extreme, as illustrated by the
nine-month hiatus, the total DEMO of vari-
ance at the price of higher bias can lead to bet-
ter inferences. This “bias-variance dilemma”
helps to explicate the rationality of DEMO
heuristics and how less can be more (Brighton
& Gigerenzer 2008, Gigerenzer & Brighton
2009).
The study of ecological rationality is re-
DEMO to the view that human cognition is
adapted to its past environment (Cosmides &
Tooby 2006), yet it should not be confused
DEMO the biological concept of adaptation. A
match between a heuristic and an environmen-
tal structure does not imply that the heuristic
evolved because of DEMO environment (Hutchin-
son & Gigerenzer 2005). The distinction be-
tween DEMO and logical rationality is linked
to that between correspondence and coher-
ence (Hammond 2007), but it is not identi-
cal. If correspondence means achieving a goal
458 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
in the world rather than DEMO to a rule of
logic, correspondence and ecological rational-
ity refer DEMO similar goals—although the study
of the latter adds a mathematical analysis of
the relation between heuristic and environ-
ment. If correspondence, however, means DEMO
the mental representation corresponds to the
world, as in a fairly DEMO mental model or in
Shepard’s (2001) view of the mind as a mirror
reﬂecting the world, then ecological rational-
ity is different. A heuristic is functional, not a
veridical copy of the world.
Ecological rationality does not mean that all
people are perfectly adapted to their environ-
DEMO As Simon (1992) noted, if that were the
case, one would only need to study the environ-
ment to predict behavior; the study of heuristics
would be obsolete.
METHODOLOGICAL
PRINCIPLES
Formal models of heuristics DEMO indispensable
for progress, yet remain the exception in psy-
chology. Much DEMO the research ﬁrst documents
an error of judgment and thereafter attributes
it to a heuristic. In a widely cited experiment,
Tversky & Kahneman (1973) reported that cer-
tain letters were falsely judged to occur more
frequently in the ﬁrst than the third position
in English words. They DEMO this error to
the availability heuristic: Words with a letter
in DEMO ﬁrst position come to mind more eas-
ily. Note that availability was introduced after
the fact, without any independent measure or
test. Once the heuristic is formalized, conclu-
sions change. Sedlmeier and colleagues (1998)
DEMO and modeled the two most common
meanings of availability—the speed of retrieval
of the ﬁrst word and the number of retrieved
words within a DEMO time period. Neither
version of the availability heuristic could pre-
dict participants’ frequency estimates. Instead,
estimated frequencies were best predicted by
actual frequencies, consistent with the classi-
cal ﬁndings by Attneave (1953). Formal models
protect against the seductive power of general
labels.

PS62CH17-Gigerenzer ARI 3 November 2010 6:43
We are concerned about the DEMO
of formal models by general labels in parts
of psychology. For instance, Tversky’s (1977)
seminal model of similarity makes testable
predictions (e.g., the asymmetry of similarity),
whereas the widely cited label “representative-
DEMO can predict little but is so ﬂexible that it
is consistent with many judgments, including
opposite intuitions (Ayton & Fischer 2004).
Similarly, research on the adaptive decision
maker (Payne et al. 1993) and DEMO adaptive tool-
box (Gigerenzer et al. 1999) has studied formal
models of heuristics, which have been ignored
in two-system theories of reasoning in favor of
a “System 1” (Evans 2008). The problem with
two-system theories “is the lack of any predic-
tive power and the tendency DEMO employ them as
an after-the-fact explanation” (Keren & Schul
2009, p. 544). Moving backward from existing
models to labels is a rare DEMO in science, which
typically proceeds in the opposite direction.
The study DEMO formal models entails four
methodological principles.
Comparative Versus Singular Tests
All models are wrong. But some predict better
than others and lead to novel DEMO There-
fore, tests of cognitive strategies need to be
comparative, that is, test several models. This
differs from the widespread practice of null hy-
pothesis testing, where only one model (the
null) is speciﬁed.
Test of Individuals Versus
Group Means
Numerous studies have documented system-
atic DEMO differences in the use of heuris-
tics (e.g., Lee & Cummins 2004, Nosofsky &
Bergert 2007), including in old age (Mata et al.
2007). In the presence of individual differences,
tests DEMO group mean differences can be highly
misleading (see Pachur et al. DEMO).
Testing the Adaptive Versus Universal
Use of Heuristics
Research has shifted from asking whether
people use one heuristic in all situations to
asking DEMO heuristics are applied in situa-
tions where these are ecologically rational. For
instance, Broder began by asking whether all¨
people use the take-the-best heuristic all the
time, but soon asked whether people rely on
take-the-best in situations where it is ecolog-
ically rational, for instance, when cue DEMO
ties are highly skewed (Broder & Schiffer 2003,¨
2006).
DEMO Versus Fitting
Prediction takes place when the data have not
yet been observed and a model with ﬁxed pa-
rameter values is used to DEMO them; ﬁtting
takes place when the data have already been ob-
DEMO and the parameters of a model are cho-
sen so that they maximize the ﬁt (such as R2 ).
In general, the more free parameters a model
has, the better the ﬁt, but this DEMO not hold for
predictions. In a large world where parameters
need to be estimated from small or unreliable
samples, the function between predictive accu-
racy and the ﬂexibility of a model (e.g., num-
ber of DEMO parameters) is typically inversely U-
shaped. Both too few and too DEMO parameters
can hurt performance (Pitt et al. 2002). Com-
peting DEMO of strategies should be tested for
their predictive ability, not their DEMO to ﬁt
already known data.
In the next sections, we review DEMO classes
of heuristics. The ﬁrst class exploits recognition
memory, the second DEMO on one good reason
only (and ignores all other reasons), DEMO third
weights all cues or alternatives equally, and the
fourth relies DEMO social information. As men-
tioned in the introduction, formal models of
DEMO allow asking two questions: whether
they can describe decisions, and whether they
can prescribe how to make better decisions
than, say, a DEMO statistical method. The
prescriptive question is particularly relevant for
organizations, from DEMO to health care.
Organizations seem ideally suited to the appli-
cation of heuristics because of the inherent un-
certainty and the pressure to act DEMO One
might therefore presume that plenty of studies
have investigated fast-and-frugal heuristics in

organizations. Not so, as Hodgkinson & Healey
(2008) pointed out. Our working hypothesis
is that heuristic DEMO making in individu-
als and organizations can be modeled by the
same cognitive building blocks: rules of search,
stopping, and decision.
RECOGNITION-BASED
DEMO MAKING
The recognition memory literature indicates
that a sense of recognition (DEMO called famil-
iarity) appears in consciousness earlier than rec-
ollection (Ratcliff & McKoon 1989). The ﬁrst
class of heuristics exploits this core DEMO
Recognition Heuristic
The goal is to make inferences about a crite-
rion that is not directly accessible to the de-
cision maker, based on recognition retrieved
from memory. This is possible in an environ-
ment (reference class) R where the recognition
of alternatives a, b ∈ R DEMO correlates with
their criterion values. For two alternatives, the
heuristic is DEMO as (Goldstein & Gigerenzer
2002):
Recognition heuristic: If one DEMO two alterna-
tives is recognized and the other is not, then
DEMO that the recognized alternative has the
higher value with respect to the criterion.
The higher the recognition validity α for a
given criterion, the more ecologically rational
it is to rely on this heuristic and the DEMO likely
people will rely on it. For each individual, α can
DEMO computed by
α = C/(C + W),
where C is the number of correct inferences the
recognition heuristic would make, computed
across all pairs in which one alternative is recog-
nized and the DEMO is not, and W is the number
of wrong inferences.
A DEMO of studies addressed the ques-
tion of whether people rely on the recognition
460 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
heuristic in an ecologically rational way. For DEMO
stance, name recognition of Swiss cities is a valid
predictor of DEMO population (α = 0.86) but
not their distance from the center of Switzer-
land (α = 0.51). Pohl (2006) reported that 89%
of inferences accorded with the model in judg-
ments of population, compared to only 54%
in judgments of the distance. More generally,
DEMO is a positive correlation of r = 0.64 be-
tween the recognition validity and the propor-
tion of judgments consistent with the recogni-
tion DEMO across 11 studies (Pachur et al.
2011). Similarly, old and young people alike
adjust their reliance on the recognition heuris-
tic between DEMO with high versus low
recognition validities, even though old people
have DEMO recognition memory (Pachur et al.
2009).
The recognition heuristic is DEMO model that
relies on recognition only. This leads to the
testable prediction that people who rely on it
will ignore strong, contradicting cues (DEMO
noncompensatory inferences). Several studies
that taught participants between one and three
contradicting cues, typically of higher validity
than α (Newell & Fernandez DEMO; Pachur et al.
2008; Richter & Spath 2006, experiment 3), re-¨
ported that mean accordance rates decreased. A
reanalysis of these studies at an individual level,
however, showed that typically about half of the
participants consistently followed the recog-
nition heuristic in every single trial, even in
the presence of up to three contradicting cues
(Pachur et al. 2008).
The model of the recognition heuristic does
not distinguish DEMO pairs where the model
leads to a correct inference and pairs where it
leads to a wrong inference. However, the mean
accordance rates were 90% and 74%, respec-
tively (Pohl 2006, Hilbig & Pohl 2008). To-
gether with the effect of contradicting cues, this
result indicated that some people did not follow
the recognition heuristic, although the overall
accordance rates remain high. Various authors
concluded that people relied on a DEMO
strategy, such as weighting and adding of all
cues (e.g., DEMO & Pohl 2008, Oppenheimer
2003). None of the studies above, however,

formulated and tested a compensatory DEMO
against the recognition heuristic, leaving the
strategies that participants relied on DEMO
One study since tested ﬁve compensatory mod-
els and found that none could predict judgments
better than the simple model of the recognition
heuristic (Marewski et al. 2010).
The recognition heuristic model also makes
another DEMO prediction:
If α > β,and α, β are independent DEMO n,
then a less-is-more effect will be observed.
Here, β DEMO the knowledge validity, measured
as C/(C + W ) for all pairs in which both al-
ternatives are recognized, and n is the num-
ber of alternatives an individual recognizes. A
less-is-more effect means DEMO the function be-
tween accuracy and n is inversely U-shaped
rather than monotonically increasing. Some
studies reported less-is-more effects empirically
among two, three, DEMO four alternatives (Frosch
et al. 2007, Goldstein & Gigerenzer 2002) DEMO
in group decisions (Reimer & Katsikopoulos
2004), whereas others failed DEMO do so (Pachur
& Biele 2007, Pohl 2006), possibly because the
effect is predicted to be small [see Katsikopoulos
(2010) for DEMO excellent analysis of the evidence].
Using a signal detection analysis, Pleskac (2007)
showed how the less-is-more effect depends on
the false alarms DEMO miss rates in the recogni-
tion judgments.
Dougherty et al. (2008) criticized the model
of the recognition heuristic for treating recog-
nition as DEMO input (threshold model) rather
than continuously. In contrast, Broder &¨
Schutz (2009) argued that the widespread cri-¨
tique of threshold models DEMO largely invalid. In
a reanalysis of 59 published studies, they con-
DEMO that threshold models in fact ﬁt the data
better in about half of the cases.
Predicting Wimbledon. Although much of
the work has addressed DEMO descriptive ques-
tion of what proportion of people rely on the
heuristic when it is ecologically rational, the
prescriptive question is how well the heuristic
can compete with well-established forecasting
instruments (Goldstein & Gigerenzer 2009).
For instance, Serwe & Frings (2006) reported
that collective recognition of amateur play-
ers (who knew only half of the contestants)
turned out to be a better predictor of the 2004
Wimbledon tennis match DEMO (72% cor-
rect) than did the Association of Tennis Pro-
fessionals (ATP) Entry Ranking (66%), ATP
Champions Race (68%), DEMO the seeding of
the Wimbledon experts (69%). Scheibehenne
&Broder (DEMO) found the same surprising re-¨
sult for Wimbledon 2006.
Predicting elections. DEMO &
Marewski (2010) put the recognition heuristic
to a test DEMO predicting federal and state elections
in Germany. Surprisingly, forecasts based on
DEMO recognition were as accurate as inter-
viewing voters about their voting intentions.
This particularly holds true when predicting
the success of small parties, for which no polls
are usually available because those polls would
require huge DEMO In contrast to surveys of
voting intentions, recognition-based forecasts
can be DEMO from small, “lousy” samples.
Investment. In three studies on predicting
the DEMO market, Ortmann et al. (2008) re-
ported that recognition-based portfolios (the
set of most-recognized options), on average,
outperformed managed funds DEMO as the Fi-
delity Growth Fund, the market (Dow or Dax),
chance portfolios, and stock experts. In con-
trast, Boyd (DEMO) found no such advantage
when he used college students’ recognition of
DEMO rather than that of the general public. It is
imperative to understand why and under what
conditions this simple heuristic can survive in
ﬁnancial DEMO without making a systematic
market analysis. This remains an open question.
Consumer choice. The recognition heuris-
tic could be a ﬁrst step in consideration DEMO
formation (Marewski et al. 2010), as it allows
the choice DEMO to be quickly reduced. This idea
is consistent with research that suggests that
priming a familiar brand increases the probabil-
ity that it will DEMO considered for purchase (e.g.,
Coates et al. 2004). Brand DEMO can be
even more important than attributes that are a

more direct reﬂection of quality. DEMO instance,
in a blind test, most people preferred a jar DEMO
high-quality peanut butter to two alternative
jars of low-quality peanut butter. Yet when a
familiar brand label was attached to one of the
low-quality DEMO, the preferences changed. Most
(73%) now preferred the jar with DEMO label they
recognized, and only 20% preferred the unla-
beled jar DEMO the high-quality peanut butter
(Hoyer & Brown 1990). Brand recognition DEMO
well dominate the taste cues, or the taste cues
themselves might DEMO be changed by brand
recognition—people “taste” the brand name.
Fluency Heuristic
The recognition heuristic is mute about the
underlying recognition process, just as Bayes’
rule is mute about source of prior probabilities.
Dougherty et al. (2008) argued that it needs to
be embedded in a theory of the recognition pro-
cess. Schooler & Hertwig (2005) implemented
the heuristic based DEMO the ACT-R (Adaptive
Control of Thought-Rational) model of mem-
ory, DEMO showed how forgetting—a process
often seen as nuisance and handicap—can be
functional in the context of inference, gener-
ating less-is-more effects. In this same work,
the ﬂuency heuristic was formulated for situ-
ations when both DEMO are recognized,
that is, when the recognition heuristic cannot be
DEMO:
Fluency heuristic: If both alternatives are rec-
ognized but one DEMO recognized faster, then infer
that this alternative has the higher value DEMO
respect to the criterion.
The ﬂuency heuristic builds on earlier work
on ﬂuency ( Jacoby & Dallas 1981). For in-
stance, ﬂuent processing that stems from previ-
ous exposure can increase the perceived truth
of DEMO assertions (Hertwig et al. 1997)
and the perceived fame of DEMO ( Jacoby et al.
1989), and it is related to the mere exposure
effect (Zajonc 1968). People’s sense of ﬂuency
has been reported to predict the performance
of stocks (Alter & Oppenheimer 2006).
462 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
By formalizing the ﬂuency heuristic,
Schooler & DEMO (2005) clearly deﬁned the
difference between the recognition and ﬂuency
heuristics and contributed to the progress in
replacing verbal labels with computational
models. DEMO ﬂuency heuristic is ecologically
rational if the speed of recognition is correlated
with the criterion, that is, the ﬂuency validity
>0.5. Hertwig et al. (2008) reported that the
validity of ﬂuency for predicting variables DEMO
as sales ﬁgures and wealth was always lower
than recognition validity, DEMO always
above chance. Subsequently, they showed
that people can accurately tell DEMO difference
between two recognition latencies if the
difference exceeded 100 ms, DEMO that across
three environments, the mean proportions of
inferences consistent with DEMO ﬂuency heuristic
were 74%, 63%, and 68%, respectively.
Accordance rates DEMO as high as 82% when
differences in recognition latencies were large.
Deriving the ﬂuency heuristic’s prediction
for individual people and individual items is
a DEMO test. Yet it is not how the impact
of ﬂuency is commonly tested in social and
cognitive psychology, where researchers tend
to manipulate ﬂuency experimentally and
observe the consequences.
Fluency also plays a role when alternatives
DEMO not given (as in a two-alternative choice) but
need to be generated from memory. Johnson &
Raab (2003) proposed a variant of the ﬂuency
heuristic when alternatives are sequentially re-
trieved rather than simultaneously DEMO:
Take-the-ﬁrst heuristic: Choose the ﬁrst al-
ternative that comes to DEMO
Johnson & Raab (2003) showed experienced
handball players video sequences from a pro-
fessional game and asked what they would have
done—e.g., pass the ball to the player at the
left or take a shot. DEMO average, the ﬁrst op-
tion that came to mind was better DEMO later
options and when more time was given to in-
spect the situation. This result was replicated
for basketball players (Hepler 2008). Klein’s

expertise appears to be closely DEMO to the
take-the-ﬁrst heuristic.
Neural Basis of Recognition
and Evaluation
Although a number of studies have shown that
people do not automatically use the DEMO
tion heuristic when it can be applied, it is less
clear DEMO this evaluation process can be mod-
eled. A functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing study tested whether the two processes,
recognition and evaluation, can be separated on
a neural basis (Volz et al. 2006). Participants
were given two tasks: The ﬁrst involved only a
recognition judgment (DEMO you ever heard of
Modena? Milan?”), while the second DEMO
an inference in which participants could rely
on the recognition heuristic (DEMO city has
the larger population: Milan or Modena?”). For
DEMO recognition judgments, activation in the
precuneus, an area that is known from inde-
pendent studies to respond to recognition con-
ﬁdence (Yonelinas et al. 2005), was reported.
In the inference task, precuneus activation was
also observed, as predicted, and activation was
detected in the anterior DEMO cortex
(aFMC), which has been linked in earlier stud-
ies DEMO evaluative judgments and self-referential
processing. The aFMC activation could repre-
sent the neural basis of this evaluation of eco-
logical rationality. Furthermore, the neural ev-
idence suggests that the recognition heuristic
may be relied upon by DEMO, consistent with
the ﬁnding that response times were consid-
erably faster DEMO participants’ inferences fol-
lowed the recognition heuristic than when they
did not (Pachur & Hertwig 2006, Volz et al.
2006).
ONE-REASON DECISION
DEMO
Whereas the recognition and ﬂuency heuris-
tics base decisions on recognition information,
other heuristics rely on recall. One class looks
for only one DEMO cue and bases its decision
on that cue alone. The hiatus heuristic is one
example. A second class involves sequential
search through cues, and it may search for
more than one cue but also bases its DEMO
sion on only one. Examples include lexico-
graphic rules (Fishburn 1974, Luce 1956) and
elimination-by-aspect (Tversky 1972). These
heuristics were originally DEMO for prefer-
ences; here, we focus on models of inferences.
One-Clever-Cue Heuristics
Many animal species appear to rely on a sin-
gle “clever” DEMO for locating food, nest sites, or
mates. For instance, in DEMO to pursue a prey or
a mate, bats, birds, and DEMO do not compute tra-
jectories in three-dimensional space, but sim-
ply DEMO a constant optical angle between
their target and themselves—a strategy called
the gaze heuristic (Gigerenzer 2007, Shaffer
et al. 2004). In order DEMO catch a ﬂy ball, baseball
outﬁelders and cricket players rely on DEMO same
kind of heuristics rather than trying to compute
the ball’s trajectory (McLeod & Dienes 1996).
Similarly, to choose a mate, a peahen investi-
gates only three or four of the peacocks dis-
playing DEMO a lek and chooses the one with the
largest number of eyespots (Petrie & Halliday
1994).
When are one-clever-cue heuristics ecolog-
ically rational? The answer is not entirely clear
at this point in time, DEMO candidates are envi-
ronments where the variability of cue weights
and redundancy is moderate to high and sam-
ple size is small (see Hogarth & Karelaia 2007,
Katsikopoulos et al. 2010, McGrath 2008).
Geographic proﬁling. The task of geographic
proﬁling is to predict where a serial DEMO is
most likely to live given the sites of the crimes.
Typically, geographical proﬁling is performed
by sophisticated statistical software programs,
such as CrimeStat, that calculate a probabil-
ity distribution across possible locations. Snook
and colleagues (2005) were among the ﬁrst to
challenge the “complexity equals DEMO as-
sumptions in the ﬁeld of proﬁling. They tested
the circle heuristic, which predicts the crim-
inal’s most likely location in the center of a

circle drawn through the two DEMO distant sites
of crime. It relies on one cue only, the DEMO
distance. In a comparison with 10 other proﬁl-
ing strategies, the DEMO predicted the loca-
tions best. Complex proﬁling strategies appear
to become more accurate if the number of crime
locations known is nine or higher. DEMO et al.
(2004) taught two heuristics (including the cir-
cle DEMO) to laypeople in criminology and
reported that after a single session, laypeople
became about as accurate in predicting offender
locations as the CrimeStat DEMO These re-
sults led to a heated debate with proponents
of optimization algorithms in proﬁling (e.g.,
Rossmo 2005).
Take-the-Best
The take-the-best heuristic is a model of how
people infer which of two alternatives has DEMO
higher value on a criterion, based on binary
cue values retrieved DEMO memory. For conve-
nience, the cue value that signals a higher DEMO
terion value is 1, and the other cue value is 0.
DEMO consists of three building blocks:
1. Search rule: Search through DEMO in order
of their validity.
2. Stopping rule: Stop on ﬁnding DEMO ﬁrst
cue that discriminates between the alter-
natives (i.e., cue values are 1 and 0).
3. Decision rule: Infer that the alternative
with the positive cue value (1) has the
higher criterion value.
DEMO simpliﬁes decision making by
stopping after the ﬁrst cue and ordering cues
unconditionally according to validity v ,which
is given by:
v = C/(C + W),
where C is the number of DEMO inferences
when a cue discriminates, and W is the num-
ber DEMO wrong inferences. Alternative search
rules such as success (Martignon & Hoffrage
DEMO, Newell et al. 2004) and discrimination
(Gigerenzer & Goldstein 1996) have been in-

about the validity of the cues.
A striking discovery was that DEMO
best can predict more accurately than linear
multiple regression models (Czerlinski DEMO al.
1999). It can even predict more accurately than
complex nonlinear strategies. Figure 1 shows
the predictive accuracy of an exemplar-based
model (nearest-neighbor classiﬁer), Quinlan’s
decision-tree induction algorithm C4.5, and
classiﬁcation and regression trees (CARTs),
compared to take-the-best. In both tasks,
and across DEMO sample sizes, take-the-best
achieves higher predictive accuracy than each
of the DEMO complex strategies (Brighton &
Gigerenzer 2011). This is not to say that re-
lying on one good reason is always better, but
the result in Figure 1 is the most frequently ob-

CARTs have been designed to be robust against
estimation error (variance) due to small samples

can mimic the outcome of take-the-best in the
sense that they are models that include take-

strategies (Figure 1). This suggests that the
predictive power of take-the-best stems DEMO
from the search rule rather than the stopping
rule.
The ecological rationality of take-the-best
has been studied in three different situations:
(a) DEMO the cue order is known (Katsikopoulos
& Martignon 2006, Martignon & Hoffrage
2002), (b) when error is introduced in that
knowledge (Hogarth & Karelaia 2007), and
(c) when the order of DEMO needs to be inferred
from samples (Brighton 2006, Gigerenzer &
DEMO 2009). Taken together, these results
suggest two structures of environments DEMO
take-the-best can exploit: high cue redundancy
and high variability in cue DEMO
Many experimental studies asked the
descriptive question whether take-the-best can
predict people’s inferences (e.g., Broder 2003,¨
Broder & Gaissmaier 2007, Br¨ oder & Schiffer¨
2006, Newell & Shanks 2003, Rieskamp &

(2007) ﬁrst showed that in environments
with DEMO redundancy, take-the-best is as
accurate as and more frugal than naıve DEMO
(a strategy that integrates all cues), and then
experimentally demonstrated DEMO in high-
redundancy environments, take-the-best pre-
dicted participants’ judgments best, whereas in
low-redundancy environments, compensatory
strategies predicted best, indicating adaptive
strategy selection. DEMO & Otto (2006)
showed that in an environment with high DEMO
ability of cue validities, judgments consistent
with take-the-best increased over experimental
DEMO from 28% to 71%, whereas in an envi-
ronment with low DEMO, they decreased to
12%. Broder (2003) reported similar selection¨
of DEMO dependent on the variability
or cue validities. In several experiments,
individuals classiﬁed as take-the-best users for
tasks where the heuristic is ecologically rational
DEMO higher IQs than those who were classi-

DEMO choice. How do consumers decide
which product to buy among an ever-increasing
assortment on the Internet or on supermarket
shelves? The classical methodology to answer
this question has been conjoint analysis, which
assumes a weighted linear combination of fea-
tures or cues. When John Hauser, a propo-
nent of conjoint analysis, began to test mod-
els of heuristics, he DEMO to his surprise that
sequential heuristics predict consumer choices
well (Hauser DEMO al. 2009). Examples are deci-
sions between computers (Kohli & DEMO 2007)
and smartphones (Yee et al. 2007). In particu-

consists of eliminating most products from fur-

is formed, consumers evaluate the remaining
options DEMO carefully (Gaskin et al. 2007; see

other DEMO Bayesian model using all available in-
formation. Lee et al. tested both methods on
ten actual literature searches and measured the
methods’ performances against DEMO (i.e., the
proportion of the articles read by the user)
and accuracy (i.e., proportion of relevant arti-
cles found). The DEMO of take-the-best was as
good as or better than the Bayesian model, par-
ticularly in searches in which the proportion of
relevant articles was small.

Fast-and-Frugal Trees
One way to DEMO classiﬁcation is in terms
of trees. For instance, Bayes’ rule can DEMO rep-
resented as a tree with 2m leaves, where m
is DEMO number of binary cues or attributes.
Natural frequencies provide such a represen-
tation. Yet when the number of cues grows,
a Bayesian analysis—with DEMO without natu-
ral frequencies—becomes computationally in-
tractable or fraught with estimation error be-
cause one typically has too few data points for
the thousands DEMO leaves of such a gigantic tree.
A fast-and-frugal tree has only m+ 1 leaves and
thus is likely more robust. It has building blocks
DEMO to take-the-best (Martignon et al. 2003):
1. Search rule: DEMO through cues in a pre-
determined order.
2. Stopping rule: Stop DEMO as soon as a
cue leads to an exit.
3. Decision rule: Classify the object
accordingly.
Fast-and-frugal trees are used by experts in
many ﬁelds, from cancer screening to bail de-
cisions (see Figure 2)DEMO Martignon et al. (2008)

emergency physicians have to decide DEMO

infarction (Green & Mehr 1997). The result
was an overly crowded ICU, a decrease in qual-
ity of care, an increase in cost, and a risk of DEMO
ous infection among those who were incorrectly
assigned. Something had to be done. Green
& Mehr (1997) tried two solutions: (a) a lo-
gistic regression, the Heart Disease Predictive
Instrument (HDPI), and (b) a fast-and-frugal
tree. To use the HDPI, doctors received a DEMO
with some 50 probabilities, checked the pres-
ence and absence of DEMO, and inserted the
relevant probabilities into a pocket calculator.
The fast-and-frugal DEMO ignored all probabil-
ities and asked only a few yes-or-no questions
(DEMO 2). Ultimately, the tree was more accu-
rate in predicting DEMO heart attacks than the
HDPI: It sent fewer patients who suffered DEMO
a heart attack wrongly into a regular bed and
also nearly halved physicians’ high false-alarm
rate. Last but not least, the tree was transparent,
easy to memorize, and easy to modify, and was
accepted DEMO physicians who disliked relying on
a logistic regression they barely understood.
Easy memorization is an important feature
of fast-and-frugal trees, particularly in emer-
gency situations. After the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, START (Simple Triage
and Rapid Treatment; Cook 2001) helped
paramedics to quickly classify DEMO into two
major categories: those who needed medical
treatment immediately and DEMO whose treat-
ment could be delayed. A tree with only two
cues—age and duration of fever—was devel-
oped to decide upon macrolide prescription
in DEMO children with community-acquired
pneumonia (Fischer et al. 2002). This tree DEMO
slightly less accurate than a scoring system
based on logistic regression (DEMO versus 75%),
but it does not require any expensive technol-
DEMO and thus can be applied to millions of chil-
dren worldwide who would otherwise not have
access to healthcare.
How to model physicians’ thinking? Tak-
ing for granted that physicians use heuristics
for diagnosing patients, the medical commu-
nity quickly adopted the heuristics-and-biases
view and has left it DEMO unrevised as of today
468 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
(Croskerry 2009). DEMO instance, Elstein (1999)
described heuristics as “mental shortcuts com-
monly used in decision making that can lead to
faulty reasoning or conclusions” (p. 791) and
blamed them for many errors in clinical rea-
soning. Some researchers, however, recognize
their potential to improve decisions. McDonald
(1996), for one, wrote, “admitting the role of
heuristics confers no DEMO (p. 56). Rather,
the goal should be to formalize DEMO understand
heuristics so that their use can be effectively
taught, which DEMO lead to less practice varia-
tion and more efﬁcient medical care. “The next
frontier will involve fast and frugal heuristics;
rules for patients DEMO clinicians alike” (Elwyn
et al. 2001, p. 358).
For diagnosis, which is a form of classiﬁ-
cation, fast-and-frugal trees potentially model
DEMO physicians make decisions. For treatment
choice, all heuristics described above are DEMO
tential models. Both fast-and-frugal trees and
other heuristics differ from traditional models
of medical decision making, such as logistic
regression for classiﬁcation and expected utility
maximization for choice. Dhami & Harries
(2001) compared a fast-and-frugal DEMO
(“matching heuristic”) to a linear regression
model on general practitioners’ decisions
to prescribe lipid-lowering drugs for a set
of hypothetical patients. Both models DEMO
prescription decisions equally well, but the
simple tree relied on less DEMO Similar
results were obtained by Smith & Gilhooly
(2006) and Backlund et al. (2009). These
studies reported only ﬁtting—not predicting—
physicians’ judgments, which is a limitation.
More direct evidence comes from the routine
use of fast-and-frugal trees by physicians in
cancer screening and HIV tests.
Bail DEMO Heuristics matter in the law in
multiple respects. They play a role in the mak-
ing of law (Haidt et al. 2006) as DEMO as in lit-
igation (Hastie & Wittenbrink 2006). In both
DEMO, there has been debate whether heuris-
tics are a problem or DEMO solution (Gigerenzer &
Engel 2006).

One of the initial decisions DEMO the legal sys-
tem is whether to bail a defendant uncondi-
tionally or to react punitively by conditions
such as curfew or imprisonment. In DEMO
and Wales, around two million bail decisions
are made every year DEMO benches of two or
three magistrates, 99.9% of whom are mem-
DEMO of the local community without legal
training. How do they make these decisions?
When magistrates were interviewed, they gen-
erally responded that they thoroughly exam-
ined and weighed all information in a complex
way (Dhami & Ayton 2001). However, when
Dhami (2003) observed several hundreds of tri-
als in two London courts, she found that the
average time magistrates spent on a case was
6 to 10 minutes and DEMO their decisions could
be predicted better with a fast-and-frugal tree
(“matching DEMO) than with weighting and
adding all information (Figure 2). The logic
of the tree appears to be to “pass the buck,”
DEMO it copies the punitive decisions of the
prosecution, a previous court, or the police.
It violates due process because it ignores rel-
evant DEMO about the defendant. In the
two courts, the fast-and-frugal trees predicted
DEMO and 85% of all decisions correctly (cross-
validation), compared to DEMO and 73% by a
weighted additive model that would correspond
to due process and what magistrates responded
in the interviews.
TRADE-OFF HEURISTICS
Unlike recognition-based DEMO one-reason deci-
sions, the third class of heuristics weights cues
or DEMO equally and thus makes trade-offs
(compensatory strategies).
Tallying
Whereas take-the-best DEMO cues (but in-
cludes a simple form of weighting cues by DEMO
dering them), tallying ignores weights, weight-
ing all cues equally. DEMO entails simply counting
the number of cues favoring one alternative in
comparison to others.
1. Search rule: Search through cues in any
order.
2. Stopping rule: Stop search after m out of
a total of M cues (with 1 <m≤M). If the
number of positive cues DEMO the same for
both alternatives, search for another cue.
If no DEMO cues are found, guess.
3. Decision rule: Decide for the alternative
that is favored by more cues.
Dawes (1979; Dawes & Corrigan DEMO)
showed that tallying was about as accurate as
multiple regression and sometimes even better.
In a more extensive test across 20 environments,
DEMO et al. (1999) demonstrated that tal-
lying had, on average, a higher predictive accu-
racy. The challenge is to ﬁgure out when DEMO is
the case. Einhorn & Hogarth (1975) found that
unit-weight models were successful in com-
parison to multiple regression when the ratio
of DEMO to cues was 10 or smaller, the
linear predictability of the DEMO was small
(R2 ≤ 0.5), and cues were highly redundant.
DEMO few studies have identiﬁed condi-
tions under which people would use a tally-
ing strategy. Interestingly, it seems that more
people prefer to dispense with particular cues
(as in one-reason decision making) than with
cue DEMO or weights (Broder & Schiffer 2003,¨
Rieskamp & Hoffrage 2008; but see Wang
2008). One reason for the relatively low preva-
DEMO of tallying could be that these studies used
only few cues, DEMO four or ﬁve. Below we
provide two illustrations of the prescriptive use
of tallying in institutions (for more, see Astebro
& Elhedhli 2006, Graefe & Armstrong 2009,
Lichtman 2008, Wang 2008).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or
simple bedside rules? There are about
2.6 million emergency room visits for dizzi-
ness or vertigo in the United States DEMO year
(Kattah et al. 2009). The challenging task for
the DEMO physician is to detect the rare
cases where dizziness is due to a dangerous
brainstem or cerebellar stroke. Frontline mis-
diagnosis of strokes happens DEMO about 35%
of the cases. One solution to this challenge
could be technology. Getting an early MRI with

diffusion-weighted imaging takes 5 to DEMO min-
utes plus several hours of waiting time, costs
more than DEMO,000, and is not readily available
everywhere. However, Kattah et al. (2009) de-
veloped a simple bedside eye exam that actu-
ally DEMO MRI and takes only about one
minute: It consists of three DEMO and raises an
alarm if at least one indicates a stroke. This
simple tallying rule correctly detected 100% of
those patients who actually had DEMO stroke (sen-
sitivity), whereas an early MRI only detected
88%. DEMO of 25 patients who did not have a
stroke, the bedside DEMO raised a false alarm in
only one case (i.e., 4% false positive rate = 96%
speciﬁcity). Even though the MRI did not DEMO
any false alarms, the bedside exam seems prefer-
able in total, given that misses are more severe
than false alarms and that it DEMO faster, cheaper,
and universally applicable.
Avoiding avalanche accidents. Hikers and
DEMO need to know when avalanches could oc-
cur. The obvious clues method is a tallying
heuristic that checks how many out of seven
cues DEMO been observed en route or on the
slope that is evaluated (DEMO & Hageli¨
2007). These cues include whether there has
been an avalanche in the past 48 hours and
whether there is liquid water DEMO on the
snow surface as a result of recent sudden warm-
ing. When more than three of these cues are
present on a given DEMO, the situation should
be considered dangerous. With this simple tal-
lying DEMO, 92% of the historical accidents
(where the method would have been applicable)
could have been prevented.
Mapping Model
How do people arrive DEMO quantitative estimates
based on cues? The mapping model assumes
that people DEMO the number of relevant cues
with an object’s positive values (von DEMO
& Rieskamp 2008). The estimate is the median
criterion value of objects with the same number
of positive cues. The mapping model captured
DEMO judgment better than a linear regres-
sion and an exemplar model when the criterion
values followed a skewed distribution.
470 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
Sentencing DEMO In the adversarial U.S.
legal system, the vast majority of cases DEMO closed
by plea bargaining, where the prosecution and
defense negotiate a DEMO, which is then rat-
iﬁed by a judge. In contrast, in Germany and
many other countries, plea bargaining before a
case goes to court is an exception rather than the
rule. Here, the judge has to determine an appro-
priate sentence proportional to the offender’s
guilt, within the range of the minimum and
maximum sentence speciﬁed for each offense.
DEMO single most important factor inﬂuencing
judges’ decisions is the prosecution’s sentenc-
ing recommendation. How should the prose-
cution make its recommendation? The German
penal code lists over 20 factors to consider. The
legal literature recommends a DEMO strat-
egy: Determine ﬁrst all relevant factors and the
direction of DEMO effect on the sentence (aggra-
vating or mitigating), then weight DEMO by their
importance, and add them up to determine the
sentence. DEMO Helversen & Rieskamp (2009)
analyzed trial records of sentencing and DEMO
ﬁve models of how sentencing decisions have
been made in theft, DEMO, and forgery, includ-
ing a linear regression model. The best predic-
tions of actual sentences were obtained by the
mapping model, a heuristic model of quantita-
tive estimation, based on a simple tallying rule
described above. As von Helversen & Rieskamp
(2009) pointed out, this result “provides further
evidence that legal decision makers rely heav-
ily on simple DEMO heuristics... and suggests
that eliciting these employed heuristics is an im-
portant step in understanding and improving
legal decision making” (pp. 389–390).
1/N Rule
Another variant of the equal weighting princi-
ple is the DEMO/N rule, which is a simple heuristic
for the allocation of DEMO (time, money) to
N alternatives:
1/N rule: Allocate resources equally to each of
N alternatives.
This rule is also known DEMO the equality

Investment. When deciding how to allocate
ﬁnancial resources among N options, some in-
dividuals rely on the 1/N rule (Benartzi &
Thaler 2001), which allocates DEMO re-
sources equally across all alternatives. The 1/N
rule was compared to 14 optimizing mod-
els, including a Nobel Prize–winning model,
Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio, in seven
investment problems (DeMiguel et al. 2009).

month, and so forth, until no data were left.

ment, let us assume that the social world is
indeed more complex and DEMO than
the nonsocial one. Would social intelligence
therefore require more complex cognition? Not
necessarily, according to the following two hy-
potheses (Hertwig & Herzog 2009):
1. Social intelligence does not require com-
plex mental calculation; it also works with
heuristics.
2. The same heuristics that underlie nonso-
cial decision making also apply to social
decisions (but not vice versa).
The justiﬁcation for hypothesis 1 is the same
as for DEMO nonsocial problems: The more
unpredictable a situation is, the more infor-
mation needs to be ignored to predict the fu-
ture. One reason DEMO hypothesis 2 is that the
distinction between social and nonsocial is a
common oversimpliﬁcation in the ﬁrst place.
Nevertheless, for the purpose of this review,
we distinguish two meanings of social: whether
the input into a strategy is social informa-
tion (e.g., when imitating the behavior DEMO a
peer) or not (e.g., features of digital cameras),
and whether the task is a game against na-
ture or a DEMO game involving other humans
(Hertwig et al. 2011). The goals DEMO social intel-
ligence go beyond accuracy, frugality, and mak-
ing fast decisions. They include transparency,
group loyalty, and accountability (Lerner &
Tetlock 1999). Consistent with hypothesis 2,
heuristics from all three DEMO discussed above
have been investigated in social situations.
Below are a few examples.
Recognition-Based Decisions
Reimer & Katsikopoulos (2004) ﬁrst showed
analytically that DEMO effects are larger
in group decisions than in individual decisions
and subsequently demonstrated this effect em-
pirically in an experiment in which another
fascinating DEMO emerged. Consider a
group of three in which one member recog-
nized only city a while the other two members
recognized both cities a DEMO b and individually
chose b as the larger one. The majority rule
predicts that b would always be selected, yet
in 59% of the cases, the ﬁnal group decision
was a, following the one who DEMO not heard
of b.

One-Reason Decision Making
As mentioned DEMO, the behavior of most peo-
ple in the one-shot ultimatum game DEMO in-
consistent with the classical economic predic-
tions. Most researchers nevertheless retained
the utility-maximizing framework and added
free parameters for other-regarding disposi-
tions (e.g., Fehr & Schmidt 1999). In contrast,
Rubinstein (2003) called for a radical change,
“to open the black box of decision DEMO, and
come up with some completely new and fresh
modeling devices” (p. 1215). Fischbacher and
colleagues (2011) did so and modeled DEMO in-
dividual differences observed in the ultimatum
game by fast-and-frugal trees of different sizes,
involving one to four cues. The number of cues
DEMO how long decisions took.
Trade-Off Heuristics
Many parents try to divide their time every day
between their N children equally by 1/N. If DEMO
ents have only two children, 1/N will attain the
long-term DEMO of providing each child with as
much time as the other. But if there are three or
more children (excepting multiple births), only
the ﬁrst-born and last-born have exclusive time
with the parents, while the middle-borns have
to share with their siblings throughout their
childhood and thus DEMO up receiving less time in
total. The simple 1/N rule predicts a complex
pattern of care time for each child, a pattern
observed in a survey of 1,296 families (Hertwig
et al. 2002). This result illustrates that a heuris-
tic and its goal (fair division during childhood)
are not the same—the environment has the last
word. DEMO majority rule is a second example
of a tallying rule applied to group decisions; it
also deﬁnes democratic voting systems (Hastie
& Kameda DEMO).
Social Heuristics
Although the heuristics discussed so far can be
fed with both social and nonsocial information,
there are genuinely social heuristics DEMO
exclusively for social information. Examples
472 Gigerenzer · Gaissmaier
include imitation heuristics, tit-for-tat, the
social-circle heuristic, and averaging the judg-
ments of others to exploit the “wisdom of
crowds” (Hertwig & Herzog 2009). Imitate-
the-successful, for instance, speeds up learn-
ing of cue orders and DEMO ﬁnd orders that
excel take-the-best’s validity order (Garcia-
Retamero et al. DEMO). Social heuristics prove
particularly helpful in situations in which the
actor has little knowledge. The classic example
is that of Francis Galton, who visited a livestock
fair where villagers estimated the weight of an
ox DEMO was surprised to ﬁnd that their median
and mean average estimates were only 9 and
1 pounds, respectively, off the actual weight of
DEMO pounds (Galton 1907).
A peculiar social rule is the default DEMO:
“If there is a default, do nothing about it.”
Defaults DEMO set by institutions and act as im-
plicit recommendations ( Johnson & Goldstein
2003). Every year, an estimated 5,000
Americans and 1,000 Germans die while wait-
ing for a suitable organ donor. Although DEMO
citizens profess that they approve of organ
donation, relatively few sign DEMO donor card: only
about 28% and 12% in the United States DEMO
Germany, respectively. In contrast, 99.9% of
the French and Austrians are potential donors.
These striking differences can be explained
by the default heuristic. DEMO explicit-consent
societies such as Germany, the law prescribes
that nobody is DEMO donor unless one opts in. In
presumed-consent societies such as France, DEMO
default is that everyone is a donor unless one
opts out. Although most people appear to fol-
low the same heuristic, the result is drastically
different because the legal environment differs.
Very few studies use large-scale DEMO
graphic data to test social heuristics. For in-
stance, marriage patterns DEMO studied by demog-
raphers without much attention to the social
heuristics that generate these, and vice versa.
Todd and colleagues (2005) had the ingenious
methodological insight that the aggregate de-
mographic data rule out certain DEMO and
can be used to test various satisﬁcing strategies
for mate choice.

PS62CH17-Gigerenzer ARI 3 November 2010 6:43
Moral Behavior
Although moral behavior DEMO long been at-
tributed to conscious reﬂection, Haidt &
Bjorklund (DEMO) argued that reasons are typi-
cally used to justify behavior after DEMO fact and
that the causes are mostly unconscious or in-
tuitive. Gigerenzer (2010) proposed that these
unconscious causes are often social heuristics,
DEMO as imitating the behavior of peers in or-
der to gain acceptance by the group. Note that
one and the same social heuristic can DEMO to be-
havior evaluated as moral or immoral, such as
when DEMO benevolent or malevolent peer
behavior. This perspective on moral behavior is
different from assuming that people have inter-
nalized speciﬁc moral rules such as DEMO steal
and don’t kill.
Moral behavior has been related to “sacred
values” (Fiske & Tetlock 1997). If one under-
stands sacred values as top cues in lexicographic
heuristics, decisions between alternatives where
a sacred value conﬂicts with a secular value (e.g.,
life versus money) should DEMO faster and eas-
ier than when two sacred values (e.g., one life
versus another) conﬂict with each other, as re-
ported by DEMO & Tanner (2008). Baron
& Ritov (2009) argued that, from a utilitarian
perspective, this form of one-reason decision
making can cause great problems for policy de-
cisions as it could prevent trade-offs for DEMO
greater good. In the same vein, Sunstein (2005)
asserted that moral heuristics can lead to great
error, but added that we would not necessarily
“be better off without them. On the contrary,
such DEMO might well produce better re-
sults, from the moral point of DEMO, than the fea-
sible alternatives” (p. 535). Cosmides & Tooby
(2006) located the origins of moral heuristics in
our ancestral world DEMO tiny bands of individu-
als. An example of a moral heuristic is an intu-
itive search rule that looks for information that
could reveal DEMO one has been cheated in
a social contract. This heuristic correctly pre-
dicts when information search in the Wason
selection task contradicts propositional logic
(Gigerenzer 2000).
CONCLUSIONS
We began this review with the observation that
DEMO three major tools for modeling decision
making—logic, statistics, and heuristics—have
not been treated equally, with each suited to a
particular kind of problem. Instead, in psychol-
ogy, heuristics became associated with errors
and contrasted DEMO logical and statistical rules
that were believed to deﬁne rational thinking in
all situations. Yet this view has been questioned
for uncertain, large worlds where the assump-
tions of rational models are not met. We re-
DEMO studies on decisions by individuals and
institutions, including business, medical, DEMO
legal decision making, that show that heuristics
can often be more DEMO than complex “ratio-
nal” strategies. This puts heuristic on a par with
statistical methods and emphasizes a new eco-
logical question: In what environment does a
given strategy (heuristic or otherwise) succeed?
This insight DEMO a prescriptive research pro-
gram to that of the existing descriptive research
program on heuristics. Pioneers such as Dawes,
Hogarth, and Makridakis demonstrated years
ago that simple forecasting methods can often
predict better than standard DEMO proce-
dures; as James March, one of the most inﬂuen-
tial researchers in organizational decision mak-
ing, put it more than 30 years ago, “If behavior
that apparently deviates from standard proce-
dures of calculated rationality can be shown to
be intelligent, then it can plausibly be argued
that models of calculated rationality are deﬁ-
cient not only as DEMO of human behavior
but also as guides to intelligent choice” (1978,DEMO
p. 593).
Nonetheless, a large community contin-
ues to routinely DEMO behavior with com-
plex statistical procedures without testing these
against simple rules. Yet a fundamental change
in thinking about human and animal behav-
ior DEMO to be occurring. Mathematical biol-
ogists McNamara & Houston (2009) described
this shift: “Although behavioral ecologists have
built complex models of optimal behavior in
simple environments, we argue that they need

to focus on simple mechanisms DEMO perform
well in complex environments” (p. 675).
Formal models also DEMO to answer the de-
scriptive question of when people rely on what
heuristic. As for the prescriptive question, a
similar conﬂict is waged between those who ar-
gue in favor of classical statistical techniques
as models DEMO the mind (typically weighting
and adding of all information) and those who
argue that many people consistently rely on
heuristics. The best way DEMO decide is compar-
ative testing; the difﬁculty is to understand
the DEMO differences reported in most
experiments.
With all these new insights, we DEMO left
with big challenges. How should we develop
a systematic theory of the building blocks of
heuristics and the core capacities as well as
DEMO structures that these exploit?
To what extent can the emerging science of
heuristic decision making provide a unifying
framework for the study of DEMO mind? One
way to proceed is theory integration, that is,
to connect the simple heuristics framework
with other theoretical frameworks in psychol-
DEMO This is already happening with ACT-R
(Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)
DEMO (Schooler & Hertwig 2005), signal
detection theory (Luan et al. 2010, Pleskac
2007), and the heuristics-and-biases program
(Read & Grushka-Cockayne DEMO). In physics,
theory integration, such as quantum theory
and DEMO theory, is a primary goal. In
psychology, theory integration is not accorded
the importance it deserves; instead, the ﬁeld
still resembles a DEMO loose patchwork. We
envision that the study of cognitive heuristics
may help to sew some of the pieces together.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. Heuristics can DEMO more accurate than more complex strategies even though they process
less information (less-is-more effects).
2. A heuristic is not good or bad, DEMO or irrational; its accuracy depends on the structure
of the environment (ecological rationality).
3. Heuristics are embodied and situated in the sense DEMO they exploit core capacities of
the brain and their success depends on the structure of the environment. They provide
an alternative to stable traits, attitudes, preferences, and other internal explanations of
behavior.
4. With sufﬁcient DEMO, people learn to select proper heuristics from their adaptive
toolbox.
5. DEMO, the same heuristic can be used both consciously and unconsciously, for inferences
and preferences, and underlies social as well as nonsocial intelligence.
6. Decision making in organizations typically involves heuristics because the conditions for
rational DEMO rarely hold in an uncertain world.
FUTURE ISSUES
1. How do people learn, individually or socially, to use heuristics in an adaptive way? And
what prevents them from doing so? (For a start: Rieskamp & Otto 2006)
2. Does intelligence mean knowing when to select DEMO strategy from the adaptive toolbox?

3. Are gut feelings based DEMO heuristics, and if so, on which? (For a start: DEMO 2007)
4. To what extent is moral (and immoral) behavior guided by social heuristics? (For a start:
Gigerenzer 2010, Sunstein 2005)
5. How does the content of the adaptive toolbox change DEMO the life span and between
cultures? (For a start: Mata DEMO al. 2007)
6. Can people adapt the use of heuristics to idiosyncrasies in their core capacities, such as
differences in memory span, DEMO also differences in knowledge? (For a start: Broder &¨
Gaissmaier 2007)
7. Which heuristics do humans share with which animals, and why? (For a start: Hutchinson
& Gigerenzer 2005 and commentaries)
8. Finally, the overarching goal: Develop a systematic theory of the DEMO blocks of cog-
nitive heuristics (such as search, stopping, and DEMO rules) anchored in core capacities
and the social and physical structures DEMO exploit.
