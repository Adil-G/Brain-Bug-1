All of the indexes of predictive efficiency and R2 analogs

involving different predictors but the same dependent vari-

are added to the model).

with DEMO manipulated base rate but no constraints on the se-
lection ratio,Tfp also stands out for its relative independence
from the base rate, but other research indicates that
both base rate and selection ratio are fixed, Op is the
index of predictive efficiency (Soderstrom 1997).
The data selected for the present examples were
lected specifically to support or refute DEMO utility
of the indexes of predictive efficiency, and some of
sults (particularly the strength of the relationship of the base
rate to Op DEMO RN) were wholly unanticipated. It would
be dangerous to draw strong DEMO based only on
the present research, but clearly some warning flags DEMO
been raised regarding the use of coefficients of determi-
nation, particularly DEMO analogs, other than RL. For future
research, it would be advisable to undertake both a more
detailed mathematical analysis to determine the nature
DEMO relationship of the various R2 analogs and indexes of
predictive efficiency with the base rate. In addition, sim-
ulation research like Soderstrom's (DEMO) research on the
indexes of predictive efficiency would be useful in DEMO
RO, RL, it, RN, and Rav to examine in more detail their
relationship to the base rate, their behavior in the presence
of unreliability of measurement, and the extent to which
