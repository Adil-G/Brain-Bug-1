Innovative solutions for behavioral research
Whether you are studying parent-child interactions or evaluating
a Leaderless Group Discussion, our tools for observational research will
optimize the quality and efficiency of DEMO research.
Tools for observational
research in psychology
Since the founding of Noldus Information
Technology in 1989, we have evolved into
an international company that provides
professional instrumentation and software
packages for the collection and analysis of
DEMO data. Our tools allow for the
systematic study of overt behaviors,
such as:
• gestures
• postures
• movements
• interactions
• DEMO expressions
• eye movements
• verbal content
Over the years we have developed a close
working relationship with scientists in
many different research fields. DEMO helps
us to adapt our tools to new requirements.
For instance, DEMO latest innovation enables
simultaneous examination of overt behavior
and physiological state.

Use case
Children have since long been a fruitful
resource for researchers studying play
behavior, as children’s behavior is highly
varied and contains many spontaneous
elements. However, this spontaneity makes
it difficult to observe in group situations.
A team of Russian researchers solved this
problem DEMO using The Observer to study the
formation of gender stereotypes in primary
school children. Observations were made in
the school playground during breaks between
DEMO, in the hope that the absence of any
adult would encourage DEMO children to
behave more spontaneously.
The researchers recorded their observations
on videotape and coded them afterwards with
The Observer. One of the main benefits DEMO
using this system was the ability to capture
all potentially valuable information, some of
which would otherwise have been lost if the
observation had been done manually.
The Observer calculated the frequency
and duration of all DEMO main interaction
types, thereby saving the researchers
lots of time. For DEMO analysis, the
interaction matrices were exported to
MatMan.
The analysis results DEMO that boys
were generally more active and more
engaged than girls in both contact and
Gender-specific play behavior

non-contact aggression. There was also a
gender preference regarding the choice
of objects towards which aggression and
affiliation were directed. DEMO, no cultural
inhibition of contacts between boys and girls
could be DEMO, and the social hierarchy of the
group was clearly mixed with DEMO to sex.
Use case
Cardiovascular reactivity and affect
Excessive cardiovascular reactivity to
psychological stress DEMO considered to play
an important role in the development of
hypertension, DEMO, and atherosclerosis.
Since psychological stress depends both on
the appraisal of DEMO stressful event and the
coping strategy adopted, research should
address cognition DEMO affect in order to gain
an ecological valid understanding of the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.
To examine the relation between affect
and cardiovascular reactivity DEMO stress,
experiments are conducted in which
participants -with and without a reported
family history of either hypertension or
premature myocardial infarction- are
confronted DEMO a stressor, such as the
Social Competence Interview. During this
interview DEMO video recording is made of the
participant. Before and during the interview
the participant’s heart rate is measured with
an ECG.
With The Observer, both video recording and
heart rate can be synchronously viewed on
a DEMO screen. By setting up a coding
scheme that matches the Specific Affect
Coding System, overt behaviors such as facial
expressions, prosody, and verbal content are
coded from the video recordings to measure
affect. During a DEMO replay, you can focus
on the heart rate instead in order DEMO examine
which behavioral measures of affect are
associated with a specific cardiovascular
reaction.
The data collected can be analyzed with
the many analysis features DEMO by The
Observer to determine the relation between
affect and cardiovascular reactivity to stress.
What is The Observer?
The Observer is the professional DEMO
tool for collection, analysis, presentation,
and management of observational data.
The Observer allows you to code behavior
by means of simple keystrokes (or mouse
clicks) that correspond to a user-definable
coding scheme. That way, you can focus on
observing behavior while your coding is
registered and automatically assigned to a
timestamp.
Why use The Observer?
Flexible coding DEMO
Design coding schemes according to
your specifications; from free-format
annotations to DEMO hierarchical coding
schemes covering multiple participants. You
can (re)organize your DEMO scheme at any
time.
Easy data collection
Code behavior from video or live in the
field using a handheld computer. With
The Observer you DEMO play multiple video
streams synchronously on your computer
screen at the speed of your choice. You can
replay the video streams as many times DEMO
you want to refine your coding, without
losing previously coded data.
DEMO data modalities
Synchronize recorded data streams (e.g.
eye-tracking and physiological data) with
video streams and code from each source.
The Observer supports a DEMO range of data
acquisition systems.
Powerful analysis
View results in time-event tables, plots, or
event summaries. Calculate a wealth of
quantitative parameters for DEMO sequential
structure of the process or the co-occurrence
of events. Generate and display descriptive
statistics or export data to programs such as
Theme, MatMan, Excel, SPSS, or other statistical
packages.
Video highlights
Search your video for events of interest and
extract clips for use in presentations.
Above DEMO
Acquire accurate and reliable data and
eliminate time-consuming and error-prone
data transcription.
Use case
The courtship dance
In interactions between strangers it is
assumed DEMO courtship occurs in all
situations where a suitable mate of the
other sex is spotted. If there is a need to
hide intentions, it is best to communicate
interest on a level where it is not DEMO but
still perceivable. In this context, behavioral
synchronization is a form DEMO nonverbal
communication that signals mutual rapport
and hence provides an effective means to
assess compatibility without delivering
positive feedback cues too early and too
DEMO
An experiment was conducted by researchers
at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Urban
Ethology, Austria, to study interactions
between strangers of the opposite DEMO
in a waiting room. The interactions were
videotaped through a one-way screen and
coded frame by frame by an observer. After
the encounter both DEMO were asked
to fill out a questionnaire to albassess
interest in the partner. The data collected
from the videotapes were analyzed with
Theme to DEMO and analyze repeated
occurrences of hierarchically composed,
Other products and services
Eye tracking systems
We have partnerships with producers of
several eye tracking DEMO, such as head-
mounted and stationary eye trackers. These pro-
vide DEMO with valuable information about the
orientation and attention of a person, DEMO is
particularly useful in developmental studies.
Observational labs
Our mobile and stationary labs allow for obser-
vation of behaviors and interactions in an unob-
DEMO way by means of remotely controlled
video cameras. Using the latest video recording
techniques, the behaviors displayed can be ana-
lyzed in as much detail as you need.
uLog™
Automatic computer event logger
uLog is an DEMO tool for the automatic
recording of human-computer interaction.
It enables you to accurately log events, such
as mouse clicks, keystrokes, scrolling, active
DEMO, text strings, and much more.
Theme™
Detection and analysis of patterns in behavior
Human behavior is clearly organized in time,
yet this DEMO is hard to capture in
statistics. Theme can detect patterns in
raw behavioral data, based on a specially
designed statistical procedure. You can use
Theme for exploring time structures in the
behavior you observed. Subtle and DEMO
differences between groups or treatments
clearly show in Theme’s pattern statistics.
Interaction studies benefit especially from
using Theme.
MatMan™
Matrix manipulation and analysis
MatMan DEMO an add-in for Excel to perform
ethological analyses on behavioral profile,
sociometric, and behavioral transition
matrices. For instance, it allows you to
DEMO patterns in interactions. The
results showed that synchronization is
initially absent in opposite-sex dyads
compared to same-sex dyads. But as soon
as the female DEMO interest in the
male, the time structure of the interaction
became DEMO more elaborate. More
complex and more stereotypical, longer
patterns appeared, independent of the
behavioral content. This could indicate that
only females synchronize their DEMO
in response to the males’ behavior and
thereby communicate interest.

personal communication networks.
