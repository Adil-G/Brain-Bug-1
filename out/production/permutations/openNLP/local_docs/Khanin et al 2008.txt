ABSTRACT
In this paper, we review the literature on venture DEMO (VCs’) investment criteria from
its early beginnings (Wells, 1972; DEMO, 1975) to current studies (Silva, 2004; Khanin,
2006)DEMO We identify the most important decision criteria of investment in new ventures
discussed in the literature, such as top management team, market, product, risk, deal and
competition. In addition, we focus on the ongoing debate that can be traced in the literature as
to whether management DEMO or product/market attributes play the most prominent
role in impacting VCs’ decision to invest. We show that while VCs themselves typically
believe that DEMO capabilities matter more than any other factor, in-depth studies of
VC DEMO making show that other characteristics, such as market growth rate and
DEMO competition, may play a more important role. Furthermore, VCs often couple the
criterion of management capabilities with that of the level of protection DEMO competition.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this paper, we summarize the evolution of DEMO VC investment literature from the earliest
dissertations on the subject written in the 1970s (Hoffmann, 1972; Wells, 1974; Poindexter,
1977; DEMO, 1976; Benoit, 1975; Dorsey, 1977) to the most recent publications (Shepherd and
Zacharakis, 2002; Silva, 2004). Throughout this DEMO, we are asking two main questions: (1)
what are DEMO main groups of investment criteria utilized by VCs to make the decision whether or
not to finance a new venture? (2) Which of these criteria plays the most prominent role? We
conclude that the VC investment literature is split between those who argue that in contemplating
their DEMO decision VCs mostly rely on the criterion of management capability and those
who propose that market size, growth rate and product quality play a more important role than
management capability. Furthermore, the criterion of management capability often is not used on
its own but rather is tightly linked DEMO some other important parameter, typically, with
competition.
INTRODUCTION
Extant research has identified a number of key investment criteria used by VCs for evaluating
DEMO business proposals, and has established their relative importance. Specifically,

these studies have shown that the size and DEMO of the market (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984);
management capabilities DEMO functional skills (Wells, 1974); the uniqueness of a product or
service (Fried & Hisrich, 1994); market acceptance of a product DEMO the degree of competitive
threat in the marketplace (MacMillan et al., 1985; 1987: Muzyka et al., 1996) are among the
topmost DEMO criteria in a VC’s repertory.
In this paper, we summarize the DEMO findings of the VC investment literature and analyze their
practical implications for VCs. We also make suggestions as to ways of improving the quality DEMO
literature dedicated to VCs’ investment criteria in ways that would make it more relevant to
investors – from VCs to business angels (wealthy individuals providing seed money) and
corporate units specializing in financing of new ventures.
THE MAIN INVESTMENT CRITERIA IDENTIFIED IN THE REVIEWED STUDIES
Top Management Team (TMT)
Many studies singled out a plethora of management-related investment criteria DEMO VCs use to
decide whether to provide a venture with initial funding. Thus, most studies have shown that
VCs evaluate whether senior management is competent. Some scholars (Wells, 1974)
differentiated among management functional skills: general, marketing, financial and
manufacturing. Others focused on management expertise and DEMO (Fried & Hisrich,
1994). Scholars have argued that VCs DEMO choose not just competent but also seasoned
managers (Robinson, 1987; DEMO, 1994) on the basis of their track record, experience and
DEMO from prior places of employment. In addition, researchers have demonstrated that DEMO
consider top management’s psychological characteristics and cognitive capabilities, such as
perseverance, commitment, attention to detail, and high risk tolerance (Wells, 1974 DEMO,
2003). Separately, many studies have discovered that VCs are DEMO about the ability of
senior management to act as leaders and be recognized as leaders by their team members
(Robinson, 1987; Kaplan & Stromberg, 2000). According to some studies, VCs typically assess
the DEMO of a management team, for instance, VCs prefer when a management team is
balanced, i.e. it is composed of people with complementary functional backgrounds,
competencies and skills (Muzyka et al., 1996, Bachher, DEMO).
Market and Market Growth
Extant studies have revealed that VCs are primarily concerned about whether there is sufficient
access to the market targeted DEMO a venture (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984); whether a venture satisfies
an existing market need or stimulates a new need in an existing DEMO (MacMillan et al., 1985;
1987); whether a market is sufficiently large so that a venture has a chance to achieve
profitability DEMO/or whether the market is growing fast enough (Muzyka et al., 1996). In addition,
Shepherd (1999) and Shepherd et al. (2000) have derived several concepts regarding market
conditions from the economics literature, and demonstrated that VCs may utilize such criteria as
“key success factor stability” (VCs examine if requirements necessary for achieving success in
the market change slowly or rapidly).
Product
Many studies have established that VCs DEMO evaluate the quality of a venture’s product
using the following criteria: DEMO the product unique or sufficiently differentiated compared to
competitors’ offerings (Muzyka DEMO al., 1996)? Is the product proprietary (MacMillan et al., DEMO;
Small Business Institute® Research Review, Volume 35, 2008
_____________________________________________________________________________________________                              189
1987; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998)? Does DEMO functioning prototype of a product exist (MacMillan
et al., 1985; DEMO)? Will a product allow a venture to obtain a competitive advantage due to its
apparent superiority over the competitors’ products or services (Fried and Hisrich, 1994;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998)?
Risk
Scholars have established that in evaluating prospective investments VCs identify various types
of DEMO they may need to tackle with regard to a particular venture. Thus, MacMillan et al. (1985)
have identified five types of risk DEMO examined by VCs: 1/ competitive risk; 2/ bail out risk;
3/ investment risk; 4/ management risk; 5/ implementation risk. MacMillan et al. (1987) outlined
five somewhat different types of risk: 1/ management risk; 2/ competitive exposure; 3/
inexperience risk; 4/ viability risk; 5/ cash-out risk.
Returns
Numerous studies have demonstrated that VCs are extremely concerned about whether the
projected returns from investment DEMO a venture will be sufficient to justify a venture’s funding
(Poindexter, 1975). At the same time, some scholars have pointed out that VCs do not quite trust
entrepreneurs’ “overoptimistic” projections regarding future returns, and pay more attention to
the market’s estimated growth rate and whether a DEMO satisfies an existing or emerging
market need (MacMillan et al., 1985; 1987; Zacharakis, 1995).
Exit
A number of studies have shown that VCs investigate some conceivable exit choices before they
invest (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). Since VC funds have a limited life span (DEMO, up to ten
years), VCs are concerned whether or not DEMO will be able to timely liquidate their investment
(MacMillan et al., 1985). Thus, VCs may or may not fund a venture depending on their estimates
of the likelihood and timing of anticipated exit alternatives (Kaplan & Stromberg, 2000).
Deal
Another important consideration for VCs is the quality of the deal. Thus, according to several
studies, VCs DEMO be keen on a venture, but will invest in it only DEMO they are guaranteed a certain
equity stake at an attractive price (DEMO, 1975; Muzyka et al., 1996).
Strategy
MacMillan et al. (1985; 1987) have first shown that VCs separately analyze a venture’s DEMO
(for instance, its positioning vis-à-vis competitors) as one of their DEMO criteria. Other
researchers have similarly observed VCs using venture strategy as a criterion (Muzyka et al.,
1996).
Customer

Most extant studies of VCs’ investment criteria did DEMO include customer’s approval as a separate
investment criterion. Instead, scholars have DEMO the role of market acceptance of product
(MacMillan et al., 1985; 1987). Some more recent studies, however, have emphasized that VCs
separately analyze the customer’s perspective (Silva, 2004), that is, whether customers in a
particular sector will be likely to endorse a product DEMO whether senior management has
developed a true understanding of their prospective customers.
Competition
Several studies have established that VCs carefully assess the extent of DEMO threat in an
industry sector before they decide to invest. Thus, DEMO et al. (1987) discovered that two
underlying factors have been consistent predictors of VCs’ financing decisions: a) market
acceptance of a new DEMO; and b) the degree of competitive threat.  Hisrich and Jankowicz
(1990) pointed out that VCs consider the odds that a venture will be able to hold off competition
and whether competitors would be likely DEMO immediately target a venture as soon as it enters a
market sector. In addition, Zacharakis (1995) showed that VCs take into account the number and
relative strength of competitors in a target market. Shepherd et DEMO (2000) demonstrated that
management competence and the degree of competitive rivalry are two most important criteria in
VCs’ evaluations of new ventures. Similar DEMO have been shown to hold true in more recent
studies (Khanin, 2006).
CONCLUSIONS
There has been a considerable debate in the literature DEMO regard to what type of factors –
management capabilities, market/product DEMO or the level of protection from
competition – provides the most prominent decision making criterion for VCs. Practically every
scholar came out on either DEMO or the other side of the debate.  Intriguingly, some authors have
expressed disparate opinions on the issue in different studies. Thus, MacMillan et al. (1985)
asserted that the entrepreneur’s (“jockey’s”) characteristics impact more VCs’ investment
decision than the quality of the product (“horse”) whereas DEMO et al. (1987) claimed
exactly the opposite.
Several studies contended that they have improved prior understanding of the VC investment
process by showing DEMO VCs, in fact, are more concerned about the product/market
characteristics than managerial skills (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998) or that managerial skills are
less important than the market potential or the assessment of environmental DEMO (Tyebjee and
Bruno, 1984). The conclusion that the quality of the entrepreneur may be less important to VCs
in making their investment DEMO than VCs themselves may think is a major discovery of the
VC investment process and decision criteria literature. Nevertheless, some authors describe
managerial characteristics as the decisive factor (Muzyka et al. 1996, Knight, 1993), and the
time-honored debate continues.
We propose that the arguments as to DEMO managerial skills and competencies or product
market characteristics and/or the level of protection are more important for VCs in their decision
making should DEMO be dismissed as idle or fruitless. The fact alone that each new spiral of
research has examined this subject from a somewhat different angle DEMO to its significance.
Dorio’s dictum (Sandberg, 1986; Sahlman, 1990) DEMO VCs prefer to finance a more qualified
(“A”) person with a worse (“B”) project than a less qualified (“B”) person with DEMO better (“A”)
project has entered the industry’s lore and acquired DEMO status of conventional wisdom. This may

explain why VCs typically exaggerate the importance they DEMO to managerial qualities in their
responses to surveys. In-depth studies, however, show that management capability is typically
coupled with some other important criteria, such as market size and growth rate as well as
competition (Zacharakis, 1995; Shepherd et al., 1999).
