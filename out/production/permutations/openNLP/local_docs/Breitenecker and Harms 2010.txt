In quantitative research, analyses are generally made DEMO a geographically defined population
as the study area. In this context, DEMO relationships between predictor and response variables
can differ within the study area, a feature that is known as spatial heterogeneity. Without
analyzing spatial heterogeneity, a global model may not be correct, and there may be DEMO
spatial boundaries in the generalizability of the findings. The authors discuss how the method
of geographically weighted regression (GWR) can be used to DEMO the study area, and
illustrate the utility of GWR for empirical DEMO in entrepreneurship research. Future
entrepreneurship research can benefit from analyzing whether conflicting evidence may be
due to spatial heterogeneity and from applying GWR in DEMO exploratory way.
Keywords: spatial heterogeneity; entrepreneurship; start up rate; geographically weighted
regression
n entrepreneurship research, spatial aspects can play an important role in many analyses,
I such as the diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 1983), market entry of firms (Debarsy &
Dejardin, 2008), and the role of regional characteristics in shaping entrepreneurial activity
(Karlsson & Dahlberg, 2003). However, even though georeferenced data and suitable soft-
ware packages are becoming increasingly available (Anselin & Florax, 1995), DEMO field has
not yet embraced methods for spatial analysis. For example, DEMO that analyze an entre-
preneurial phenomenon in a geographically defined population in a specific country may
implicitly assume that the results are the same DEMO all parts of that study area. However, many
researchers do not DEMO use statistical tools to support this homogeneity assumption.
If this homogeneity assumption is violated, the relationships between predictor variables
and a response variable vary between different local study areas, which create spatial het-
erogeneity (Anselin, 1988). When spatial heterogeneity exists, analyses can be influenced
by counterbalancing (e.g., effects that cancel each other out) or dilution (e.g., averaging dif-
ferent size effects). Therefore, a model that assumes constant parameters across the study
area would not be valid. By using local DEMO analysis as a ‘‘spatial microscope’’

DEMO this article, we demonstrate how entrepreneurship research can benefit from recogniz-
DEMO spatial heterogeneity. First, we discuss the importance of including spatial heterogeneity
DEMO entrepreneurship research through an analysis of the literature. Then, we introduce DEMO
geographically weighted regression (GWR) as a tool to detect spatial heterogeneity. An
illustrative analysis demonstrates how by investigating spatial heterogeneity, counterbalan-
cing and dilution effects can be avoided. Researchers who use this method may help DEMO
reconcile conflicting evidence in entrepreneurship research.
Addressing Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepreneurship Research
Consequences of Inadequately Dealing With Spatially Heterogeneous Study
Areas
Entrepreneurship research, as a discipline, analyzes how the process of venture creation is
shaped by characteristics of the person, of the venture, and of the environment (Davidsson,
2005). A key element of the environment is the DEMO location, because location influ-
ences the process and the results of DEMO creation. For example, studies on cluster dynamics
and systems of innovation (Carayannis, Assimakopoulos, & Kodo, 2008) and the local dynamics
of DEMO (Julien, 2007) highlight the location-specific nature of entrepreneurship.
This location-specific DEMO of entrepreneurship can be understood as a ‘‘spatial condi-
tionality,’’ which describes how features of the environment can influence the strength
and/or DEMO direction of the relationship between a predictor variable and a response variable.
Although contingent relationships in entrepreneurship research at the industry level have fre-
DEMO been found (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), it is likely that heterogeneity also exists at a
regional level, because industry contingency factors may be unequally distributed in space.
Table 1 illustrates the consequences of spatial DEMO in quantitative research. The
table indicates whether spatial heterogeneity does or does not exist in the observable envi-
ronment and if it has been DEMO
If spatial heterogeneity exists, but it is not analyzed, then the implicit assumption of the
researcher is that spatial homogeneity exists, an assumption that can lead to erroneous
results. For instance, positive and negative relationships between predictor and response

variables in local study areas may cancel each DEMO out, creating a counterbalancing effect.
A weaker form of counterbalancing effects DEMO when variations in the strengths of rela-
tionships are averaged over a study area, without a change in direction, producing a dilution
effect. DEMO and dilution effects may be strongest when no spatial differentia-
tion of a heterogeneous study area is undertaken. However, these effects may also emerge in
finer-grained analyses when the study areas are not specifically based on DEMO
heterogeneity.
If spatial heterogeneity does not exist and is not part of the selection criteria either then the
spatial boundaries of the analysis remain DEMO In these circumstances, the researcher
can only imply that the findings DEMO true for the whole study area but cannot demonstrate
it. When spatial heterogeneity exists but is not detected by an adequate analysis, a type II
error is made (rejecting the true null hypothesis of no spatial variation). When a dedicated
analysis of spatial heterogeneity leads to no DEMO, a stronger claim for the general-
izability of the findings over DEMO study area can be made. If spatial heterogeneity exists
and is discovered then dedicated techniques of spatial econometrics are appropriate.
Techniques such as spatially DEMO regression models (Anselin, 1988) can be used
to analyze the DEMO of the predictor variables with the response variable in a
spatial context. If spatial heterogeneity does not exist but the spatial heterogeneity
analysis leads DEMO an erroneous result of spatial varying local associations between pre-
dictor and response variable, a type I error occurs (retaining the false null DEMO of
no spatial variation).
Potential Approaches to Deal With Spatial Heterogeneity
By delineating spatially homogenous study areas, researchers can avoid counterbalan-
cing and dilution effects and can provide information on the geographic scope of the DEMO
eralizability of their findings. Now, the question arises as how researchers DEMO actually
identify those homogenous study areas. As a starting point for spatial analyses, researchers
are likely to use official statistics describing administrative statistical units such as Nomen-
clature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS, Eurostat, 2009) and select local study areas
within the broader study area ex ante. In principle, the inclusion of interaction effects with
dummy variables that represent those regions could solve the issue of spatial heterogeneity.
If the DEMO term with the regional dummy variable were significant, this could
be DEMO as a change in the slope of the relationship between predictor and response
variables, thereby modeling structurally different relationships. Another strategy could be
to run several regression analyses, each of which is based on data from a specific local study
area, and compare the results. Differences between the regressions in terms of signs
and values of the regression coefficients would DEMO structurally heterogeneous
relationships.
However, the ex ante selection of the local DEMO areas is exacerbated by: (a) the large
potential number of DEMO study areas, (b) limited theoretical knowledge, and (c) potential
interdependencies between study areas. These issues, as discussed in the following para-
graphs, may persuade researchers of the need to apply methods specifically suited to iden-
tify spatial heterogeneity.

Breitenecker, Harms / Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepreneurship Research 179
First, the DEMO of regional units per country can be quite large. For example, DEMO are 93
study areas at the local area unit (LAU) level in our analysis in Austria. For researchers who
wish to assess spatial DEMO in a national context via the inclusion of regional dummy
variables in moderated regression, this number of units would result in a model with a high
degree of complexity and a low degree of freedom, which would be difficult to interpret.
Second, as an alternative to resorting to regional dummy variables, researchers could
include regional-specific variables as moderator variables. For example, researchers could
use the unemployment rate or regional income directly as moderator variables. However,
without first testing whether spatial heterogeneity is present, the results would be unclear.
A concern to researchers is the comprehensiveness DEMO the incorporated moderators and the
degree to which spatial variability in total can be explained. Although this approach would
be suitable to identify heterogeneous DEMO, the main deterrent is the need for a theoretical
justification in DEMO moderator variables. Because the impact of the environment on the
entrepreneurial process is complex (Julien, 2007) and not well explored, many regional
DEMO have yet to be fully developed from a theoretical perspective.
Third, DEMO data are sampled from a specific local study area, the recognized DEMO
istics of adjacent regions can also influence the relationships between predictor and
response variables of that region. This phenomenon may influence inference statistics and
DEMO the significance of the results to be reported incorrectly. The influence of adjacent
regions is particularly relevant in entrepreneurship research. Because entrepreneurs are
characterized DEMO innovative and proactive behavior (Miller, 1983), their actions may not
only be influenced by the resources and opportunities in their ‘‘home regions’’ DEMO also
by the resources and opportunities of neighboring regions as well. For example, rural entre-
preneurs may do business in adjacent urban areas. If the impact of the neighboring urban
region on entrepreneurial behavior is stronger DEMO the impact of the rural region’s own
characteristics, then an ex DEMO characterization as ‘‘rural’’ would not match the true beha-
viour of enterpreneurs in that region.
A Literature Analysis on the Recognition of Spatial Heterogeneity DEMO
Entrepreneurship Research
To assess how spatial heterogeneity is recognized in entrepreneurship research, we
investigated quantitative studies that analyze determinants of new firm formation. New firm
formation is the number or the proportion of new firms that DEMO created in a given area dur-
ing a given time. We acknowledge that these studies cover only a facet of entrepreneurship
research. However, because the response variable can only be operationalized in terms of
geographic boundaries DEMO data are often only available on a specific regional level, we
DEMO that these studies are particularly likely to incorporate spatial heterogeneity.
As a starting point for our literature analysis, we used key word searches for studies with
‘‘new firm formation,’’ ‘‘new business formation,’’ ‘‘new venture DEMO,’’ ‘‘start-up
activity,’’ and ‘‘firm birth’’ in the titles as well as in the abstracts of five leading entrepre-
neurship journals (Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, Entrepreneurship Theory
and Practice, Journal of Business Venturing, Journal of Small Business Management,
Small Business Economics) from 1998 to 2008. Additionally, journals from the field of
regional science such as ‘‘Regional Science’’ and ‘‘Annals of Regional Science’’ were
Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at DEMO OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

searched and relevant articles were included. We then DEMO the reference sections of the
identified articles for additional studies. The search resulted in 40 articles from 14 journals
analyzing the relationship between regional DEMO variables and the rate of new firm
formation.1
The resulting 40 studies exhibited one of three approaches to recognize spatial heteroge-
neity: (a) an implicit approach, (b) a level approach, and (c) DEMO structural approach. Twenty
articles defined the population at a national or regional level. As such, this practice implied
that the results might be different in areas other than the one studied, but there is no varia-
tion within the study area. In more than a third of the DEMO, researchers recognized that
location might influence the level of the response DEMO For example, the urban incuba-
tor hypothesis states that the level DEMO start-up activity may be higher in urban areas than in
rural areas (To¨dling & Wanzenbo¨ck, 2003). When using this hypothesis, researchers may
account for this systematic difference by using a spatial dummy variable (Brixy & Grotz,
2007).
In only three studies (Fritsch, 2004; Reynolds, Storey, & Westhead, 1994; van Oort &
Atzema, DEMO), the researchers recognized that the location affects the structure of the rela-
tionship between predictor and response variables. These researchers indicated there may
DEMO spatial heterogeneity involved in their studies. When considering the results, the DEMO
studies showed how the recognition of spatial heterogeneity can lead to more fine grained
results.
Recognizing there may be spatial heterogeneity between countries (Reynolds et al.,
1994) or between parts of a country (Fritsch, 2004), methodologically, these researchers
defined local study areas ex ante and calculated separate regressions for local study areas.
Both studies showed that the DEMO of the relationship between predictor variables and
new firm formation differs between local study areas, thereby providing evidence for dilu-
tion effects.
Van Oort and Atzema (2004) analyzed how the impact of predictor variables on DEMO firm
formation differs between local study areas such as macrozoning regimes (DEMO, core, inter-
mediate, and peripheral areas of national economic activity) or connected and unconnected
regimes (areas that are connected/unconnected by commuter streams). By comparing sep-
arate regressions, they showed that the results differed depending on the local study area
chosen. In contrast to the DEMO two papers, van Oort and Atzema (2004) introduced a spatial
DEMO model that takes into account spatial dependence in the estimation of the model para-
meters. They also introduced test statistics, using a spatial Chow-Wald test, to demonstrate
that the local study areas identified are indeed structurally different. Overall, however, our
review of the literature shows that most DEMO do not currently deal with spatial
heterogeneity.
Using GWR to Detect Spatial Heterogeneity
The recognition of spatial heterogeneity is promising for entrepreneurship research.
However, currently most studies do not attempt to identify structurally heterogeneous study
areas. DEMO this section, we illustrate GWR, a technique that can be used to detect spatial het-
erogeneity. We outline the statistical foundations and apply DEMO on an example drawn

from entrepreneurship research. In the discussion and in the example, we follow a three-step
approach: (a) GWR model estimation; (b) calculation of parameter variability; and (c) anal-
ysis of relationship stability with a Monte-Carlo test.
DEMO the GWR Model
Prior to GWR analysis, it needs to be DEMO whether a key assumption of a global model,
that is spatially independent error terms, is violated. If this is the case (Moran DEMO statistics, Doh
& Hahn, 2008), spatial autocorrelation exists, and DEMO may be due to spatial heterogeneity
(Brunsdon, Fotheringham, & Charlton, 1999). Hence, a GWR model must be estimated.
As an extension of the classical linear regression model, GWR considers the spatial variation
of the relationships between response and predictor variables as well as their spatial DEMO
dence. In a GWR model, the parameters are allowed to vary DEMO the entire study area, while
being estimated on a local level. DEMO, GWR presents a local model where the para-
meters are not DEMO to one level, as is accepted practice in classical global models. DEMO
the GWR approach, we estimate the association between response and predictor DEMO for
each region of the study area, as such, the GWR can be used as an explorative tool to detect
spatial variability (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2000). When the variables do not
demonstrate spatial variability over the whole study area, a global model would be valid. For
other variables, a localized regional structural variable has to be identified. By incorporating
interaction effects with these structural variables into the model, the problem of spatial
heterogeneity may be solved. The GWR model can DEMO written as

where (yi; xi1, ... , xiK) are observations in region i (i ¼ 1, ... , N) of the response variable y

coordinates, such as the longitude and the latitude (ui,vi) of its centroids (Fotheringham

In spatial data, it cannot be assumed that DEMO are spatially independent. Regions
that are closer to each other may have more in common than regions that are more distant;
therefore, the observations are spatially dependent (Doh & Hahn, 2008). Tobler (1970,
p. 236) has formulated this spatial phenomenon in the first law of geography: ‘‘Everything
is related to everything else, but near things DEMO more related than distant things.’’ If spatial
dependence is present, it DEMO to be considered in a regression model. GWR considers spatial

more weight than DEMO region that is farther away. In our illustrative example in the next sec-
tion, we use a bisquare kernel. This kernel function is written as

where dij is the Euclidian distance between the centroids of region i and region j (Fother-
ingham et al., 2000). In the local GWR estimation procedure of region i, only regions j
inside a predefined radius or bandwidth h (dij < h) are included. Thus, the bandwidth h
determines how many neighboring regions should be considered for the local estimate. The
DEMO can be fixed or can vary with location i. When a fixed bandwidth h is used, the
number of observations that are considered for the local model varies with each region. An
alternative is an adaptive DEMO function with varying bandwidth hi. In this case, the num-
ber DEMO considered regions in the local estimates is held constant. The optimal bandwidth hi
can be found by minimization of the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC; Brunsdon,
Fotheringham, & Charlton, 1998).
Determining Parameter Variability
Second, once the local GWR parameters have been estimated, summary statistics (minimum,
maximum, median) of the local parameter estimates can be used DEMO check whether sign changes
of parameter values over the whole study area exist. The variability of the local parameter
estimates can be measured by DEMO standard deviations of the local parameter estimates b^ik :

where b^k is the mean of the N local parameter estimates of variable DEMO including the intercept
(k ¼ 0, ... , K). The smaller the standard deviation SDk, the stronger is the evidence of a
constant influence of the parameter k over the whole study area. Brunsdon DEMO al. (1998) sug-
gest comparing the standard deviations SDk with the standard errors of parameter estimates
of the global model to determine the DEMO of spatial variability. If the standard deviations
exceed the standard errors, DEMO is evidence of spatial heterogeneity.
Testing Spatial Stability
Third, the significance DEMO spatial variation in the relationships between response and
predictor variables must be analyzed. To test for spatial instability of a global model, para-
metric tests (Brunsdon et al., 1999; Fotheringham et al., 2002) or independent Monte-Carlo
tests can be applied.
The Monte-Carlo test begins with the DEMO hypotheses that a global model is valid and
that the local parameter estimates b^ik do not vary with the location i for variable k. DEMO set
of L GWR estimations (e.g., L ¼ 999 permutations) DEMO permuted attribute values over the
study area are performed. For each permuted estimation, the standard deviation SDkl (k ¼ 0,
... , DEMO; l ¼ 0, ... , L) is computed (Fotheringham et al., 2002). The set of L standard devia-
tions SDkl for each of the (K þ 1) local parameter sets generates a DEMO distribution for
the parameter variability of variable k. If the standard deviation SDk0 from the original
model (the correctly located case) is an DEMO value of this sampling distribution (p <

.05, one-sided DEMO), then the hypotheses of a constant parameter over the whole study area
has to be rejected (Fotheringham et al., 2002).
A DEMO value can be calculated under the null hypothesis that the local parameter does not
vary over the study area. The p value is then DEMO proportion of standard deviations SDkl,
which are higher (more extreme) than the standard deviation SDk0 of the correctly located
case out of DEMO SDkl. Hence, it is given by 1 – R/(L þ 1), where R is the rank of SDk0 out of all
DEMO and L the number of permutations.
An Illustration
Motivation and Global Model Estimation
In entrepreneurship research, the analysis of factors that influence the annual number of
new start-ups is of great importance for both researchers and DEMO makers (Audretsch &
Fritsch, 1994). By understanding the factors DEMO explain start-up rates, policy makers are
able to compare regions and DEMO on policies to increase start-up activity. Table 2 pro-
vides an illustrative overview of the factors that we have used in the analysis that DEMO
Table 2 demonstrates how the theoretical discussion and the empirical evidence on
almost every predictor variable point in different directions. A possible way to DEMO the
conflicting theoretical arguments and empirical evidence would be to identify whether there
are regions where one or the other hypothesis holds. This approach DEMO avoid counterbalan-
cing and dilution effects, while at the same time DEMO the generalizablity of the find-
ings. First, local study areas that DEMO homogeneous with regard to a relationship under
investigation need to be identified and analyzed to discover the underlying causes of poten-
tially diverging relationships.

We illustrate the application DEMO GWR as a tool to discover spatial heterogeneity with the
example of an analysis of factors affecting start-up activity in Austria during 2006. As DEMO
response variable, the start-up activity is measured by the labor-market approach DEMO stan-
dardizes the number of start-ups against the economically active population (DEMO &
Fritsch, 1994). As independent predictors, the exit rate (number of firm exits divided by
number of existing firms), the DEMO unemployment rate in 2005, the average net income
in 2005, the average firm size in 2005, the population density at the beginning of 2006, and
the proportion of resident aliens at the beginning of 2006 are considered in the model. Data
at the regional level of 93 DEMO counties are provided by the Chamber of Commerce and
Statistic Austria, DEMO the analysis was performed with the free statistical environment R
Version 2.8.0 (R Development Core Team, 2008). The GWR estimation function in DEMO is
provided by the software package spgwr Version 0.5-4 (Bivand & DEMO, 2008).
First, we compare the results of the GWR with an approach that does not consider spatial
heterogeneity. The comparison model is DEMO global linear regression model. The global model
yields an R2 value of about 0.655, which represents an adequate fit. In the global linear
model, the coefficients for exit rate (0.488), for unemployment rate (0.224), and for average
net income (0.841) are significant and positive. DEMO global model indicates that these vari-
ables have a positive relation with start-up activity over the whole study area, where for
average firm size there is a significant negative relationship with start-up activity
(1.092). No significant effect could be identified for the population density or the propor-
DEMO of resident aliens (see Table 3). However, the Moran I statistics (Doh & Hahn, 2008)
show that the assumption of DEMO linear model of an independent error term is violated.
Therefore, we DEMO consider spatial dependence in the analysis and must apply the spatial
regression approach GWR.

Estimating the GWR Model
To investigate spatial heterogeneity, we followed the three-step framework discussed in
the previous section. First, we estimated a GWR model. The adaptive bisquare kernel func-
tion (see Equation 3) was used to calculate the DEMO weights. The adaptive bandwidth of
the kernel was determined by AIC optimization that resulted in an optimal solution that con-
sidered 62.4% of the DEMO (about 58 of 93 counties) for each local regression model.
The summary statistics of the local parameters demonstrate that the estimates for most
DEMO variables change sign across the study area. Comparing the minima and maxima
of local parameter estimates of the intercept, the exit rate, the DEMO rate, the aver-
age net income, the population density, and DEMO proportion of resident aliens indicate that
the direction of the relationship with the start-up rate (the response variable) varies in
Austria. These findings DEMO spatial heterogeneity (see Table 3).
To visualize how the local DEMO parameters change over the study area, the GWR results
can be DEMO on a map (see Figure 1). A GIS system, such as the product family from
Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. or components DEMO the statistical environment
R (R Development Core Team, 2008) can DEMO used to produce this kind of visualization. The
level of local parameter estimates are indicated by the gradient of the lines, for example, DEMO
higher (lower) the parameter value, then the higher (lower) DEMO the corresponding slopes.
Negative local parameters are illustrated by a negative slope, whereas positive parameters
are indicated by a positive slope. We used gray coloring to indicate when the local
parameters are significant at the level DEMO 5%, and white if they are not significant.
For example, the local parameters for the exit rate in Figure 1B range from –0.408 DEMO
eastern Austria to 1.471 in western Austria. Although there is a significant positive global
effect, we detect a significant positive relationship in eastern Austria and a significant neg-
ative relationship with the start-up activity in the DEMO Similarly, we found sign changes for
the impact of the unemployment DEMO (min. ¼ –0.282, max. ¼ 0.398), the average net
income (min. ¼ –0.111, max. ¼ 1.347), the population density (min. ¼ –0.085, max. ¼
1.606), and the proportion of resident aliens (min. ¼ –0.345, max. ¼ 0.026). In the cases
of DEMO average firm size, we did not detect sign changes but a DEMO variation of the
strength of the relation with the response variable. The minima and maxima of local para-
meters for the average firm size DEMO –1.678 and –0.799, respectively. The findings indicate
that a neglect of DEMO heterogeneity in a global model can lead to erroneous results due to
counterbalancing or dilution effects (see Figures 1A–G and Table 3).
In addition to the local GWR parameters, we also plotted local goodness of fit statistics
for each region i, the local R2 . This plot provides information about whether the fit is ade-
quate over the whole DEMO area. The local R2 values are between 0.522 and 0.817. The fit
measures show that the model has an adequate fit over the whole DEMO area, with a better
model fit in western, northern, and DEMO Austria (see Figure 1H).
Determining Parameter Variability
Second, local parameter variability is assessed by calculating the standard deviations SDk
of local parameters. DEMO compared the standard deviations with the standard errors of para-
meters in the global model to determine the degree of spatial variation following Brunsdon

et al. (DEMO). The standard deviation of the exit rate with 0.623 is about 2.9 times the stan-
dard error of the global model with 0.215. DEMO, the standard deviation of unemploy-
ment rate (0.220) is about DEMO as high as the standard error of the global model (0.102)DEMO
The standard deviation of the average net income and the average firm size also exceeds the
standard error by a factor of 1.8, and 1.2, respectively. Only the standard deviations of pop-
ulation density (0.360) and proportion of resident aliens (0.087) are less than the standard
DEMO of the global model with 0.416, and 0.088, respectively. Thus for four of seven vari-
ables and including the intercept, a high degree of variability can be reported. These find-
ings are further indicators of DEMO heterogeneity (see Table 3).
Testing Spatial Stability
Third, to test the significance of local parameter variation, a Monte-Carlo test (based on
DEMO ¼ 999 permutations) was performed. To obtain independent test statistics, we ran the test
procedure for each of the seven variables including the DEMO separately. The standard
deviations for the exit rate and the unemployment rate have the highest values in compar-
ison to their resulting sampling distributions. DEMO, the p values for these standard devia-
tions equal 0.000, the differences in the local parameter estimates of these variables are
significant, and the varying relationships across Austria have to be considered. For local
parameters DEMO average net income, population density, proportion of resident aliens, and
DEMO firm size, no significant spatial variability could be found (see Table 3).
Conclusion and Implications
Contributions of the Recognition of Spatial Heterogeneity DEMO Entrepreneurship
Research
In this article, we have discussed the phenomenon of DEMO heterogeneity and illustrated
that entrepreneurship research can benefit from analyzing the heterogeneous or homoge-
nous nature of a study area by avoiding counterbalancing and DEMO effects. In addition,
entrepreneurship research can benefit by unambiguously establishing the geographical
boundaries of generalizability. The identification of spatial heterogeneity is challenging,
DEMO only a few papers discuss this important concern. Methodologically, we have DEMO
how spatial heterogeneity can be identified by using GWR. Finally, we DEMO that
researchers should become aware of potential spatial heterogeneity in their specific study
areas.
By recognizing the importance of spatial heterogeneity, several contributions to entre-
preneurship theory can be drawn from our example. First, when testing a theory in the con-
text of a spatially heterogeneous study area, a researcher might erroneously not reject the
null hypothesis (no effect), while in observable reality, nonrejection may be attributable
to the counterbalancing effects of structural relationships in some local study areas. In our
example, the overall effect of the proportion of resident aliens on start-up activity is DEMO sig-
nificant in the complete study area represented by the global model. However, the propor-
tion of resident aliens is negatively significant in the western and central parts of Austria. If

a researcher wanted to test the impact of DEMO proportion of resident aliens in the whole coun-
try, implications about DEMO insignificance of the variable based on the results from the global
model area would be misleading. By avoiding these kinds of misleading interpretations,
DEMO spatial heterogeneity can enhance theory in the area of entrepreneurship.
Second, DEMO different local study areas are characterized by a different strength of the rela-
tionship between predictor and response variables, dilution effects can result in a value of
the overall model that does not represent the values DEMO specific local study areas. The effect
detected in a global model would be weaker or stronger than in some local study areas. In
this DEMO, the coefficient for the impact of average net income on new DEMO formation in
the global model was 0.841 (significant at p < DEMO). However, Figure 1D indicates that
significant relationships exist only in DEMO Austria, while in western Austria, the relation-
ship in the majority of study areas are weaker and nonsignificant (in a few cases even neg-
ative). In cases where entrepreneurship theory is concerned with the DEMO strength of
association of predictor and response variables, the detection of DEMO strengths of rela-
tionships (even without a change in sign), DEMO a broader study area, the recognition of
spatial heterogeneity will contribute DEMO the field.
Third, by unambiguously identifying homogeneity, stronger claims for generalization can
be made. In the global model, the relationship between average firm size and start-up activ-
ity was significant, and GWR showed how this effect is present in all local study areas.
Therefore, counterbalancing and dilution effects are not present and the results of the global
model are DEMO in Austria as a whole.
Finally, the analysis of spatial heterogeneity DEMO well suited for exploratory research
(Fotheringham, 1992). If spatial heterogeneity is detected, questions about the mechanisms
that cause the observed parameter variations can be asked. For example, why is it that the
positive impact of the average net income is stronger in northeastern Austria than in DEMO
western Austria? Are cultural issues behind this finding, or is it due to a different industry
structure? Fotheringham et al. (2002, p. 252) sum up the exploratory nature of GWR by stat-
ing, DEMO could be thought of, in fact, as a ‘spatial microscope’. The surfaces of para-
meter estimates from GWR raise new sets of questions DEMO the general issue of
parameter variations and the validity of global statements.’’
Additional Applications of Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepreneurship
Research
In our illustrative example, we showed how spatial heterogeneity could contribute to
the analysis of new DEMO formation. In this example, the primary goal was to identify the
DEMO of structurally similar local study areas. In the following example, we DEMO
how spatial heterogeneity can be applied in the analysis of moderating relationships in
the context of culture.
One area of entrepreneurship research that has DEMO considerable attention is the
investigation of the impact of culture on the entrepreneurial process (e.g., Garcia-Cabrera &
Garcia-Soto, 2008). Culture, which can be defined as ‘‘a set of shared values, beliefs, and
DEMO behaviours’’ (Hayton, George, & Zahra, 2002, p. 33) can play a role in analyses of
the sources of country differences through DEMO measures of entrepreneurship,

Breitenecker, Harms / Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepreneurship Research 189
characteristics of individual entrepreneurs, and on corporate entrepreneurship (Hayton
et al., 2002).
In a model of the association between culture and entrepreneurship, Hayton et al. (2002)
argue that cultural values can moderate the relationship between the institutional and eco-
nomic context and entrepreneurship. For example, while a munificent economic environ-
ment is in principle supportive to entrepreneurship, individuals whose cultural values
predispose them to act entrepreneurially will generate more entrepreneurial results than
DEMO whose cultural values are not entrepreneurially predisposed. To analyze these mod-
erating relationships, researchers could in principle identify culturally homogenous regions
and use resulting regional dummy variables or indicators of cultural dimensions as modera-
tor variables. DEMO, it may seem easy to identify culturally homogenous regions because
the DEMO of national cultures (Hofstede, 1991) implies that cultural differences are DEMO
to national boundaries. However, cultural values can vary in a study DEMO, not only in a
national context but also in a regional DEMO (Garcia-Cabrera & Garcia-Soto, 2008).
Cultural values exacerbate the ex ante delineation of study areas, particularly in the con-
text of multinational cultures and multicultural nations. In addition, cultural values may not
only be influenced by the cultural heritage of a group but also by institutional and DEMO
factors of groups that surround them (Tan, 2002). Moreover, DEMO an ethnically homoge-
nous group may differ in terms of motivation, DEMO, and other variables (Cardon,
Shinnar, Eisenman, & Rogoff, DEMO), which could give rise to unexpected complex contin-
gencies. Consequently, DEMO who wish to analyze the impact of culture on the rela-
tionship between context factors and entrepreneurship could profit from GWR, a tool that
considers the spatial variation of the relationships between response and predictor variables
DEMO well as their spatial dependence. GWR will identify structurally heterogeneous local
study areas and researchers can assess whether cultural differences may be the source DEMO
potential variations.
Concluding Remarks
In addition to the analysis of new firm formation and culture, entrepreneurship research-
ers can benefit from the recognition of spatial heterogeneity in any analysis characterized
by unclear boundaries of study areas DEMO/or unexplored conditionalities that are spatially
bound. Although the analysis of spatial heterogeneity is beneficial for entrepreneurship
research, potential drawbacks of GWR should not be overlooked. Although in many data
sets, spatial information is readily available, the need for georeferenced data makes primary
data collection more costly. Software for GWR is available (e.g., GWR3x at http://ncg.nui-
m.ie/DEMO/GWR/software.htm), however, diligent spatial analysis is still arduous. Addition-
DEMO, particular regional values may be used for multiple local estimations in DEMO
Therefore, multicollinearity may arise (Wheeler & Tiefelsdorf, 2005), which DEMO GWR
more suitable for exploratory rather than confirmatory analyses.
The explicit consideration of spatial heterogeneity has the potential to contribute to the-
ory creation DEMO testing in entrepreneurship research as well as in other areas of the social
sciences. An increased awareness of spatial heterogeneity will lead to exciting DEMO research
questions and results. We hope that this contribution sensitizes entrepreneurship scholars to
